5.0,4/29/2019,"Had a reservation for 6, came at 6:30, they still honored it and sat us at a nice table at the far end of the restaurant, not exactly in front of the fireplace but still close enough that we could see its glow against the walls and the ceiling. It was very nice. Warm and inviting. Told the waiter we needed to eat quick, as we had somewhere to be at 7:30, and ordered Gnocchi with squash, chestnut, sage, arugula and truffle oil; Duck Breast with farro, fennel, bergamot and roasted brussels sprouts; Broccoli Rabe cooked in a calabrian chili with some parmesan crisps sprinkled on top; and Shrimp crusted with spaghetti squash, which might have been the highlight of the whole meal. For drinks my wife had Gold Rush, which was bourbon with lemon and honey -- and tasted, to me, like a kind of alcoholic lemonade -- and I had the White Russian, which was made with Ketel One or Grey Goose (I can't remember), and had a thick rim of cream sitting above the liquid that my wife drank when I left it untouched in my glass. Both drinks were very good. In all, we got out of the restaurant in about 45 minutes, which was not nearly long enough, as we'd have normally sat around and enjoyed the atmosphere more. As it is, the Lamb's Club is a beautiful space; the aforementioned fireplace, the red banquet booths, Art Deco lamps and the walls with photos of famous people looking out at you as you dine. The whole thing feels like money and it is -- I mean, the bill was just north of $200. But I didn't mind, as the food was delicious and the space was wonderful to be in, even if it was for only a short period. I'd happily dine again, either for a business meal or nice night out with friends.",0,0,0,Paul C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0

1.0,4/21/2019,"Yuck ! The service was good . Was there for Easter Brunch , and the brunch while presented nicely was over priced for nothing. No omelette station , not many choices of anything. Very small under stocked raw bar . Basically I ate cake for $86 a person. The set up was also ridiculous... basically seated in a bar up some stairs , constantly bumped into ... just not worth it .

3.0,4/7/2019,Decided to come here prior to the Harry Potter show on Broadway. Ambiance was nice. The decor is Art Deco. Our waiter was thorough and knowledgeable. He was well versed with the menu and gave some great recommendations. The lobster a la plancha was flavorful and rich with oregano and paprika. The curry crab salad was much more then what I anticipated. It was absolutely delightful. The boulevardier drink had Campari liqueur and sweet vermouth which gave it quite the kick. It was just like a negroni. Overall this was a great pre theater dining experience.,1,0,1,Becky V.,"New York, NY",3,20,57

4.0,3/14/2019,"Came for a late dinner with some work friends and we really enjoyed ourselves. I don't think I would be a regular, but I'd recommend it until I've scored a few better places.Had an old fashioned and the drinks were spot on. The waiter was about perfect in his white tuxedo jacket. I thought I was something special! He was very good as we were obviously clueless.The garlic/onion bread was awesome. It would be a bad sign if that didn't go well.The smoked trout deviled eggs were a fantastic app! The group who tried the oysters were very pleased. The steak tartare went quickly. It was good, but just not my thing.I had the Cappelletti which was just ""divine"". I don't know what that means, but the word just fits! It was awesome. I should have ordered sides or a salad, because it was lonely and I was still hungry. It consisted of a sweet sauce of braised beef, carrots, scallion and pistachio. It was very good.Go here for a late dinner that will be a treat. Just make sure you order the whole meal.",1,0,0,Robert M.,"Austin, TX",16,751,310

5.0,3/5/2019,"Typically my husband and I stop by The Lambs Club for drinks, however, we decided to stop in for brunch and I am sure glad we did! The service at The Lambs Club is always impeccable! When we were seated we were asked if we would like to order an adult beverage, my husband ordered the Bellini and I had the Bloody Mary, the Bloody was very unique due to the fact that the ice cubes are made with their Bloody Mary mix which is great because the drink never gets watered down.We started our meal with the canelés which were super flavorful! And the banana and passion fruit filling hits the spot.For our main dishes I had the Mediterranean breakfast and my husband had the pancakes; my dish was great and the hummus was perfect! My husbands pancakes were cooked perfectly and had a very unique flavor.During Sunday brunch you can listen to live jazz music and the ambiance is just perfect!

4.0,2/7/2019,"The restaurant week menu looked really good so I gave it a shot. Unfortunately my dinner partner was sick so I came alone. The vibe is retro elegant with old time photos, fireplace and red leather seats. First I was brought a plate of 5 Everything style rolls with butter. I was anticipating a 3 course meal so I didn't want to fill up but wanted to try it. Well, things did not go according to plan because only a few seeds remained on the plate. DO NOT skip the bread!!! My app was the Winter Salad, a chilled plate of lentils, freekah (wheatberry), spaghetti squash, chili (not spicy) with a light green goddess dressing, a wonderfully balanced starter of taste and texture. Next was the main course of Duck Confit, 2 legs that fell apart as soon as my fork touched it, topped with tart and sweet braised figs. It sat atop unnoticeable parsnip purée and escarole. My waiter had suggested a side because he informed me they really weren't substantial so I ordered the fingerling potatoes and was walloped by the $14 price tag on the bill, they were delicious and fed 2, but still. Dessert was not an option at that time because of my bread debacle so I asked to take home the carrot cake which was very moist and rather creamy, not cakey, very delicious. Upon receiving the check I was also given a small bag of homemade popcorn which was rather forgettable. Service was pleasant but nothing special.",3,1,4,Monica D.,"Rochelle Park, NJ",197,328,916
4.0,1/30/2019,"Review for a private event only: I planned and hosted an event on behalf of a client here and had a wonderful experience from start to finish. All of the event staff were very helpful. Monika and Mary were exceptional in terms of providing quick responses via email and accommodating last-minute changes. The night of the event, we had three servers in our private dining room for 20 people, more than enough to graciously serve everyone in a timely manner, plus ensure my guests never had empty glasses. In addition to the servers, we had a private dining manager present the entire night who made sure everything was going to plan. The food wasn't necessarily as good as what I was expecting from GZ, but the service was exactly what I'd expected and more. Highly recommend looking into either of the private dining rooms downstairs if you're looking to entertain and impress a small group of guests. (Logistically, the south room is well decorated, very comfortable to entertain and seat 20 people, acoustics are good as well).",1,0,0,Allison M.,"San Francisco, CA",95,87,7
2.0,1/27/2019,"My husband and I were only in New York for a few days and wanted to enjoy great food at a restaurant within walking distance post performance  at the Schoenfeld theater ( Come from Away musical) I have followed Geoffrey Zakarian for years on the cooking channel so was really looking forward to visiting his restaurant! What an expensive disappointment- our first clue was the restaurant was eerily empty( yes 10:00pm but this is New York City on a sat night) the employees with the exception of the busboy( who worked his tail off) acted like we were a bother and seemed oblivious to their customers .Our waiter forgot to bring my wine and someone else had to bring it ( we were a whopping party of 2). Despite the restaurant being really slow it took a long time between courses. I was thinking this must be because everything was prepared fresh. I ordered the beef and pasta dish' my husband the sole ($68 ) . My husbands sole was cool to warm when it finally came and he had to send it back( my husband rarely complains) . My food was warm but I was too hungry to send it back- I probably should have because it took so long for the sole to come back warm, that essentially I ate alone, and then my husband ate belatedly alone. Food was good not great and overpriced. Waiter insensitive to customers and not concerned. When we went to pick up our coats from the hostess who was on the phone and sitting all evening she had suddenly disappeared We stood for several minutes with a couple waiters and the bar tender not noticing- finally the busboy who seemed to be the only one working much came over and gave us our coats! I was happy to tip him and we did the tip the waiter 18% but lord knows why--Geoffrey you need a lot there but first and foremost you need a manger and your staff needs training in customer service. I wish differently but fdont see how this place is going to make it with all the competiton We will never be back . Mb",0,1,0,Mary B.,"Dayton, OH",0,1,0
5.0,1/6/2019,"We had a great pre-theater experience at the Lambs Club upstairs bar. Our waiter was very attentive, noticing that we had a bit of a time crunch to see Network (right across the street, so the Lambs Club was the perfect choice).We shared the bean and ricotta salad (yummy, plenty of fresh, crisp beans, and delicious citrusy dressing), tuna l'occidental (also yummy, thin-sliced rare tune with rich tonnato), and fingerling potatoes (yummy, too).

5.0,1/4/2019,"I can't say enough about the Lambs Club. I am a HUGE fan of the Chef/Owner, which led to our first visit. Our first dining experience here was nothing short of spectacular. The only thing that could have made it better would have been meeting the Chef himself. I HIGHLY recommend requesting the Chef's tasting menu with the som's wine pairings.

1.0,12/25/2018,"We were very disappointed and totally outraged with our experience today at the Lamb's Club. We had 11AM brunch reservations for 13 on Christmas day. We arrived early and were the first to be seated in the restaurant. We ordered drinks and then promptly ordered our meal. The drinks took 30 minutes to come out... and it was at that time that the waiter informed me that one of the specials, the lobster bloody mary, was unavailable. I was not only disappointed to find out that they were out of the lobster special, but that it took 30 minutes for them to tell me about it. I ordered the regular bloody mary, which was medium in quality at best... even with their touted frozen tomato ice cubes. The bad service didn't end there... after an hour and 15 minutes without our food, or the appetizers, we started to notice that EVERY other table in the restaurant, all of which were empty when we arrived, had received their food. So, we contacted our waiter (who we decided at this point appeared to be high) and he gave us an unsatisfactory explanation... finally, a manager came over and said he'd look into it. An hour and 45 minutes after sitting down, the food finally came out, and that was the entrees... never did get the appetizers. Thanks to the VERY delayed service, we had to cancel our plans to attend Christmas mass at St. Patrick's for 1:00pm. This was extremely disappointing and an unnecessary downer on our Christmas day. It was also obvious that the food was rushed once they realized that they screwed up our meal. The eggs benedict plates at the table were terrible... cold in the middle and improperly poached eggs. The house smoked pastrami hash, which is what I had, was really delicious... but was served piping hot, like it was zapped real quick in the microwave. This made it difficult to appreciate what would otherwise would have been a fantastic plate. We received a half-assed apology from the manager and no discounts or other concessions on the $1000+ bill. All in all, a terrible experience that ruined our plans for Christmas day in New York. BOTTOM LINE: What should have been a great and relaxing Christmas brunch was ruined by terrible service and careless management. Not so Merry a Christmas at the Lamb's Club.",10,1,0,Matt R.,"New Orleans, LA",562,548,315
2.0,12/18/2018,Tried eating here twice while staying at the hotel.  Reception and bar Staff are both poorly trained.  The room service is adequate so I assume the food is ok.  But definitely not worth the staffs attitude.  Mixed drinks were poorly made at the bar.,1,1,0,Rod G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,15,0
3.0,12/16/2018,"Sadly, this restaurant has gone downhill. The food is still good but the service was slow and indifferent. The Somm was engaging but the waiter was like Casper the ghost.

4.0,12/16/2018,"Finally made it to the Lambs Club. I went in for a pre theatre dinner because I had 8 pm tickets to see King Kong on broadway. I've always been a huge fan of Geoffrey Zakarian. I met him at Miami food and wine festival and watch his shows so I was excited to try his restaurant.I ordered the lobster as my entree and I was not disappointed. Very well done and the spiced butter on the side was a nice little twist. I actually sat upstairs at a table in the bar area which ended up being a great choice! Less stuffy than downstairs and a very chic ambiance. It was the perfect vibe for a nice dinner before a broadway show and night out on the town. I was slightly disappointed with the dessert and that's the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5.

2.0,12/8/2018,"As I sit here on the train eating my cold but delicious steak from the lambs club with two spoons because the servers helper said he couldn't find and was too busy to find me a plastic fork for my $75 meal that I had to take to go, because it took two hours to get our food...I decided to write my review.  We made a reservation for 5:30 and arrived at 5:15 with our party of 7. We were seated within minutes.  We were given water right away and that's where it ended.  A good 20 minutes of servers bustling by until we were greeted by our server and a good 20 minutes later til we got our first drink.  Was hoping to get at least 2-3 drinks in before leaving.  We informed our server that 6 of us had to leave at 7:30 for a show and I had to leave at 7:15 to catch a train.  She said ""should be no problem.  Appetizers came out right away.  The server was very nice but so slow with drinks and dinner... likely not her fault but knowing our time constrictions could have been more attentive.  Second round of drinks ordered and they came not til about 6:45.  At that point still no food.  At 7 we told her I had to leave in 15 minutes.  She said she would check.  About 5 minutes later our food came.  Promptly asked for a to go box and stressed I needed it quick and with utensils the guy disappeared.   He finally came back with my food and no utensils.  I said I need utensils I have to eat this on the train.  Again he disappears.  I asked the host for utensils.  Nobody interested in finding utensils for my steak that took two hours to get from the time we sat down.  Finally the guy returns with two spoons and napkins and said they were too busy and he couldn't find a fork.... not sure but if I was working in a high end restaurant and my customer just waited that long for dinner and drinks totaling over $100 for one person I would have handed them a fork from the table.  So disappointing from a restaurant that we were expecting sooo much more from.  Previously a server myself and currently a business owner... a mere conversation from the server to say the kitchens and bar are really backed up maybe you don't order this or that or just get apps... just so disappointed to spend soooo much money on a meal and not even enjoy it.  Atmosphere, drinks and food were fabulous but the overall experience was so poor.  Thank goodness I dined with amazing friends ... who walked into their show with zero minutes to spare.  You can do better Lambs Club.",8,2,1,Jen H.,"San Francisco, CA",2,71,130
5.0,12/8/2018,This was my first visit to the Lambs club. Prior to dinner we had a drink at the upstairs bar.It felt like a step back into time. A time when bars were elegant and live music played. The Art Deco decor and classic furniture is perfect. Dinner was just as good. We were going to the theater after dinner and the waiter and staff kept this in mind. The pre fixed menu was excellent with many choices. My table tried almost everything on the menu and each was very good. A beautiful fireplace roared and the crystal glowed. Again it was a step hack into time. A time when restaurants were run professionally and waiters are Top in their professions. In one word - no two words- timeless and chic! We will be back!

The Ceasar Salad was not good at all. I am not a fan of fish but can tolerate some fishy undertones to make a dish stand out. All I tasted on the salad was fish everywhere. The dressing was not good, the chicken on it was mushy. The lettuce was very crisp and fresh, which was the only upside of this dish. The Amish Chicken was much better. The stuffing was ok, not overly flavorful. The best part of the dish were the leeks and saffron on the bottom. The chocolate dessert was ok...best part was the caramel sauce but it wasn't enough for my liking.

Their table side beverage cart service is such a fun and elevated option. A special thanks to our server Daniel who was amazing. Also, huge thanks to Jay, the general manager for anticipating our needs and making my friends birthday a night to remember. They both provided five star service that exuded luxury and refinement but was warm and relaxed at the same time. The service was elegant without feeling pretentious.

Not only was the food amazing -- try the scallops, you won't regret it -- but the service was also on point. A few key notes to make: - The interior is beautiful and classy, with wood paneling, white tablecloths, and jazz playing in the background. You feel like a special person just walking in.- The service is attentive, responsive, and friendly, especially for event planning. While working with them to set up the dinner, we changed plans a few times and had some special requests, which they handled with smiles and care. - The food, again, is fantastic -- the burrata was unique and delicious, the Amish chicken enjoyable, and the scallops were buttery and super soft. Unbeatable. - The bar downstairs is also something to speak of; they have non-alcoholic cocktails for those who do not imbibe and they're *great*, much more interesting, memorable, and accommodating than damn near anywhere else I've gone.

4.0,8/25/2018,"Selected this celebrity chef restaurant for an after theater dinner.  Had a Saturday night 7:15pm reservation and was quite surprised that when we were seated there was only one other couple in the restaurant.  Yes, this is the theater district and many could have 8pm tickets but I would expect the restaurant to be more filled with pretheater diners.  After about 10 minutes for the next hour and a half we were there we had the whole restaurant to ourselves.  Obviously this led to a pleasant quiet dinner and a staff, which I am sure is always responsive, being focused on our every need.  The food itself was somewhat disappointing.  The dry aged steak tartare was so heavily seasoned that the beef flavor was lost.  The sweet corn soup was tasty but the sweetness of a diver scallop placed in the chowder was overwhelmed by the sweetness of the corn.  For main courses, I had the Peking duck breast.  Though beautifully plated and seasoned well, the skin of the breast was soggy and not what you would expect in something called Peking duck.  The Gnocchetti Scampi was a portion better suited as an appetizer for two rather than as a main course.  Overall, though good and creative, we were disappointed as the execution of the meal was not what you would expect from an iron chef.",0,0,1,Stuart B.,"Brick, NJ",35,184,0
1.0,8/22/2018,"After so many disappointing business meals, I think I've officially given up on this place. The atmosphere is great, especially for the theater district. But the food is overpriced and rarely more than average in quality, if not slightly below. But it's always the service that gets me. Today, for breakfast, I was seated in the worst possible location, despite the fact restaurant was hardly filled and despite the fact I had a reservation. I was given undrinkable, bottom-of-the-pot coffee and had to request fresh. And though both myself and my guest were specific in some of our requests (rye toast for me, blueberries with his oatmeal for him), they were initially ignored. And even after asking a manager to assist, my toast order was never corrected. This would be bad enough in a run-of-the-mill diner. But in a place that charges $25-42 for most breakfast entrees/specials, it's inexcusable. And this is pretty much what happens on every visit. Again, the atmosphere is nice.

We came here for the Restaurant Week menu and had the burrata tomato salad which was ok, the Amish chicken and the deconstructed cheesecake. Loved the Amish chicken last year but they changed the dish this year. The spiced cumin jus it comes with is the best part of the dish, but overall was a bit too salty. The cheesecake and sorbet were ok, but I'd rather go down the block for a slice at Junior's. The best part of the meal was the bread.",0,0,1,Nicole R.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",79,37,13

We ordered desert with 30 minutes left before we needed to leave, cheesecake and ice cream (neither of which requires cooking) and ended up having to request for these to be refunded as they still were not delivered by the time we needed to leave.

4.0,6/6/2018,"We were in town on Anniversary Weekend to see ""Escape from Margaritaville"" and had our pre-show Brunch here. The interior is gorgeous with dark paneling, swanky red booths with white tablecloths, art deco light fixtures, show biz portraits on every wall, and a big old fireplace.Being in the theater district, and being owned by a big time chef/celebrity (Food Network's Geoffrey Zakarian), NYC pricing is front and center here, but my $20 Lobster Fra Diavolo Bloody Mary with Sriracha was worth every penny. It had so much shredded lobster meat in the glass, I ended up with forkfuls at the end of the drink. Oh, and by the way, the ice cubes were made of frozen Bloody Marys, not plain old frozen water. That was great - the drink never got diluted ! Our party of three ordered from the Brunch menu: an Egg and Cheese Sandwich with Applewood Smoked Bacon, Cheddar, and Tomato Confit for $20, an Avocado Tartine with Shallot Confit, Feta Cheese, and Sunny Side Eggs for $20, and for me the House Cured Smoked Arctic Char with Cremè Fraîche and Caperberries on Bread or Bagel for $25.The food looked gorgeous and we all enjoyed our meal.Two quibbles though, the Avocado Tartine was advertised as being served with Sunny Side eggs, but came with poached eggs. No big deal, but I was surprised to see a disconnect between the kitchen and the menu on the preparation. I am sure there are some crabby people out there who would have pitched a fit over this.Also, the amount of fish on my $25 Arctic Char plate yelp.com/user_local_phot… was incredibly small. There was maybe enough to fill one half of the bagel. But the plate did look great, and tasted even better, but the portion size of the fish really underwhelmed me, especially at $25.We ended our meals with Assorted Petit Fours ($12) and La Colombe House Blend Drip Coffee ($7). They were a great combination. The dessert order included a duo of four items -marshmallow cubes, green jellied cubes, chocolate cakes and macarons.The Lambs Club offers live music, and we really enjoyed being entertained by the Redux Jazz Orchestra featuring Olivia Chindamo. We heard lots of great jazz standards, and some cool vocals and scatting by Olivia. The music volume was perfect -loud enough to be heard and low enough so you could have conversations at your table.So all in all we had a wonderful brunch experience at the Lamb's Club.",8,1,4,Dan R.,"Simsbury, CT",1775,2408,36884

I had never  heard of this restaurant and in my constant desire to find a reasonably tasty  restaurant in the theatre district decided to try this one. Don't!!! It is grossly overpriced, the waiters very inexperienced and the food mediocre. The waiter that delivered my kale salad had his thumb in it, the fish (salmon)was good, if a bit overcooked, but it had a tasty sauce. However, the vegetables the fish sat in were soggy and obviously reheated and crispy at the ends. Not sure how you achieve that, but they managed.The water bottle which i did not ask for was $10.00.  I let it go, thinking that at least it was clean. The place has the feel of a new restaurant in the 1950s. Why bother updating, you have an unsuspecting audience that is always looking to have dinner in the neighborhood. Buyer be warned.

We went to the Lambs Club as a pre-theatre dinner back in 2012. We were set to see Wicked so we booked dinner at the Lambs Club leaving a three hour window for dinner to ensure we made it to the show on time. Needless to say, that did not happen, but that wasn't even the worst part of our experience. We arrived at The Lambs Club excited to try the famed Jeffrey Zakarian's food. We ordered the tasting menu, but added on the chocolate soufflé since we had seen so many things about Jeffrey's soufflés. Not only was there a 1 hour delay between our second and third course (where our wine tasting was never refilled and we were not asked if we wanted any other drinks), but the dinner was so behind that instead of bringing us the chocolate soufflé we ordered, the staff brought out a molten chocolate lava cake and told us it was the soufflé we ordered. Clearly they knew we had no time to complain and probably assumed that we wouldn't know the difference, but unfortunately for them, my mother is a chef and was dumbfounded by the entire scene.

1.0,2/13/2018,"I came here with my boyfriend during restaurant week and I was looking forward to this dinner just to conclude that I was beyond disappointed with our experience here at The Lamb's Club. After we visited Tom Colicchio's Riverpark restaurant (which by the way, amazing food, service, atmosphere, and overall experience- highly recommend), I had anticipated The Lamb's Club to be just a little bit better. I don't write much reviews on Yelp but this one really deserved its own in my perspective. If I could give it zero stars, I definitely would. See below for our overall experience:Upon entering the second floor for our reservations, there was a live jazz band performing. We were then greeted by the host who was not very friendly and later seated us at a table in the back that was extremely wobbly. We had to repeatedly ask the servers for a table wedge. The first time we asked the manager and she just completely forgot. The second time we asked another server whom to no surprise, forgot as well. Both of them were just walking past our table completely ignoring our requests but they were happily helping the other guests. Mind you the restaurant wasn't even busy at all by the time we got there, how can they BOTH forget?! I understand if the restaurant was really busy but it wasn't. We had to again remind the server about this and I was already beginning to get annoyed at this point about their service here. Then, the food comes. I understand this is restaurant week and this was ""supposed"" to be a somewhat fancy and expensive restaurant but geez the portions were extremely small! The food was just mediocre. Honestly nothing there with a WOW factor. The plating of the dishes looked as if they just randomly threw a few things together (my boyfriend is a private chef so I've definitely seen way better presentation). We waited for maybe about 20+ minutes for our dessert to come. While waiting, a runner/busser angrily sprinted past our table cursing underneath his breath but loud enough for me to hear. I thought that was really unprofessional. Overall, there were no clear communications between the staffs and everyone look as if they didn't want to be there to begin with. To end this on a sour note, we asked for the check and we had to sit there like idiots for 15 minutes just to pay and leave because again they forgot our check!!!! The live jazz band was just so loud that it gave me a headache and I couldn't wait to just they the hell out of there. At this point I was beyond annoyed and complained to one of the runner/busser because there was only one server there the whole night and she had been talking with the other guests at another table for at least 10 minutes while leaving us and the guests at the other tables waiting for help! All I was offered was an apology and then finally our check came. Overall, the service was just horrible!!! Seriously whatever food they made there, we could all simply make ourselves at home. Guys, please just save yourself the disappointment and avoid coming here. With so many better restaurants in NYC, don't even bother with this one. Again, if I could give it zero stars, I would.

The chocolate, burnt marshmallow, and crumble with peanut butter ice cream made for a nice finish.Cheesecake (4 stars): This was another interesting deconstruction that was rather light. Flavor was definitely there, just not as good as the mousse.Overall, this place served up some great food for restaurant week. My friend and I couldn't believe how kitschy and cheesy this place is with the decorations and all that, but I guess that's what you get near Times Square.

I don't know how many people order them but its a great throwback to yesteryear.  They have hand carved ice which outlast the drink such as in the Gold Rush cocktail - the purpose is that, to chill the drink without diluting it.  The Pimms Cup and Dark & Stormy are also some drinks to order.

3.0,12/20/2017,"I wish I could give establishments 5 stars for atmosphere separately. It's swanky with a cool Mad Men-esq vibe to it. Being both modern but classic and old school at the same time. Nice pulled away booths, a chic art deco bar. Men aren't necessarily dressed up to the nines in suit coats and it still left a casual enough atmosphere to just come out here in your button down polo and blue jeans and a nice ole frock (maybe not your sweatpants). We started our evening off right with a really smoky nice dark red wine from Napa Valley. The complimentary bread served to us was out of this world. Flaky and fell apart, still warm, buttery, covered with poppy seeds. It almost reminded me of a loaf version of a popover. If Geoffrey Zakarian kept churning these out to me all night long, I'd be a happy camper. Ordered the special Lamb slider (that was really the size of a full burger) as part of the Somms and Sliders deal a month or two ago. The burger I ordered medium rare and came with a fried pickle layer on the bottom with a piquillo pepper marmalade and covered with manchego cheese. The flavors were great - the biting sharp cheese with the spicy-sweetness but the lamb itself was very bland, under-seasoned meat and super dry and over-cooked to well done. Maybe lamb is a bit trickier to cook for a slider or burger. But for being the famous Lamb's Club I was under-whelmed. Overwhelmed by strangely the bread. French fries were just okay but appreciated the Sir Kensington ketchup and mayo condiments as a nice little fancy touch to the evening.",4,2,7,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",843,1384,11457
3.0,12/18/2017,"Apologies for the long review, but you will put a strain on your nerves dining at the Lamb's Club. Simply put, the atrocious service takes away from the genius of the food. Let's start from the beginning. We arrived promptly for our 7pm reservation on Saturday and we were greeted nonchalantly by the hostess. She asked us to wait in the lounge as they set up our table. Ten minutes pass, then 20, then 30, then 45. Not once did the hostess check on us, or offer a cordial ""I'm sorry for the wait."" We had guests with us, so rather than venture to another restaurant, we spoke with the hostess and only then, did she begrudgingly seat us (an hour into the wait).  Shockingly, once inside, we noticed that half the dining room was empty. Why was there a wait if the restuarant was empty? Her reply was absent of accountability, as she stated ""it is out of my control."" Once seated, we tried to salvage the night. But unfortunately, the lackluster service continued (the food review will come soon, I promise)!  We were seated at a booth next to the kitchen. And each time the kitchen doors opened, waiters raced by our table with hot plates, within inches of our guest sitting in the corner seat. Not to be pretentious, but the last thing we wanted was for our friend to have a beautiful chiffon top ruined by a splatter of velouté. We asked to be reseated at one of the empty tables. Shortly thereafter, we could hear a member of the wait staff exclaim, ""don't tell me how to do my job!"" As sensational as all this sounds, I assure you this is far from exaggeration. The unprofessional antics at this point offered as much comedy as an SNL sketch.Fast forward another 30 minutes, we were still sitting in the ""timeout corner"" without food nor drink. Simply forgotten. This was the breaking point, and we asked to speak with the manager. Aftering sharing our feedback with him, he said ""I will see what I can do about the table,"" and he left as quick as he came. Finally, success! We were reseated. The booth was wonderful, as was our new waiter, Daniel (who was probably the only one who smiled to us, versus the scowl of our first waiter who abhorred us because we complained). Now, the food (which I will keep short because by now, I'm mentally and emotionally exhausted). The Filet Mignon was perfectly cooked, and the Short Rib mashed potato side was good enough to be it's own dish. We particularly enjoyed the Nero pasta, generously adorned with crab meat and wafting with sweet scents of the ocean. The cocktails were also delectable, specifically the Manhattan and Moscow Mule. And the deserts were also delightful, with the star of the menu being an innovative Baked Alaska with a semifreddo center. Despite all the tasty bites, however, the evening was ruined the minute we walked into the restaurant. No matter how exceptional the food was, it is not worth the sub par service at the Lamb's Club.",9,5,3,Chase B.,"San Francisco, CA",27,176,313

Tipped her well hoping things would improve her evening.  It was our turn for dinner in the main dining room-a nice room with a large fireplace and several empty tables.  We were promptly seated by the kitchen door-really?! Plenty of room with plenty of better tables.  Again, 3 women, did that have something to do with it?  We made the best of it by ordering broadly from the menu and a bottle of sparkling in an attempt to brighten the experience.  The food was fine - it did get better when we ordered another bottle of wine that finally got the wine stewards attention since it was something I doubt too many order or know.  Other than his appreciative attention and conversation the overall experience wasn't worth the time or money.  Food was nothing special along with what I've already mentioned. We were extremely pleasant since I don't believe in making a scene but we probably should have especially since the bill came to well over $400.  The entire time we were there, there were lots of open tables-the kitchen door my friends-the kitchen door.",0,0,0,Jane C.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,10,0

Server staff needs a lot more training, aside from being completely inattentive, anyone that voices concern with food allergies will surely get very ill.

4.0,11/15/2017,"So I made my reservation with a little trepidation given how mixed the reviews for Lamb's Club were, but I'm awfully glad I did. We had a lovely meal here. First, the space itself is clubby and cozy and welcoming from the start. We were seated near the fireplace, which was a delight on a cold evening. The staff was welcoming and attentive and made sure we would have plenty of time before our theater time. Cocktails were great although a little pricey, and the wine list had loads of choices by the glass with a range of prices. I was pleased to see orange wines but did not know any of the ones on the menu. The Sommelier was helpful and not the least bit snooty, and I was pleased that she steered me to something that was not the most expensive glass. I also liked that the menu was not overwhelming. We opted to order from the full menu instead of the 3 course prix fixe, even though that was a great deal at $60, because my husband and cousin were attracted to the duck and I wanted the pasta with crab. I thought the starters were expensive for portion size ($25 for the tuna and the hamachi crudos, each of which only had a few pieces of fish), but the plates were gorgeous and the fish was delicious. Mains were more reasonably priced for a restaurant in this part of town and again, great. The duck may have been the best I've ever tasted, and my pasta was well seasoned and loaded with crab. We had a little mishap in that the waiter only heard one of the duck orders, but since we had loads of time and one duck order on the table that could be shared while the other was prepared, it really wasn't a big deal to us, but it clearly was to the staff, which could not stop apologizing. We were brought extra glasses of wine, and they comped the second duck order, even though we said it was not necessary. By that point, we were all stuffed but had to try a dessert. We all shared the chocolate bar, and it was a perfect bite for the four of us. We decided we will come back on a night when we do not have theater tickets to try the chefs 5 course tasting menu ($105, but the whole table needs to order it). Honestly, the only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is that, as the restaurant filled up, it got very loud. Two of us are a little hard of hearing, so to me, that was a negative.

Walking up, it doesn't look like much, but once inside, in my opinion, it's very nice. The house made drinks are delicious. The menu is perfectly balanced. From Crab Benedict to a New York favorite, THE EGG SAMICH! The biscuits were my favorite. The stuffed French toast was top notch. The hash brown bites were very tasty. Dessert was amazing and very tasty. Oh! And the three piece band playing Skat Jazz with a well taught jazz singer. Soft and sultry voice. Set a great mood. GO! Enjoy.

2.0,7/24/2017,"We've been huge fans of Geoffrey Zakarian from his food network endeavors, but sad to say our excitement at eating at his restaurant was quickly tempered. The service was fantastic, though a little slow (20 mins for our appetizer), but unfortunately the food quality did not justify the prices. Appetizers: We were brought bread and butter, though the bread was cold. Our steak tartare was good, though mustard really overpowered the dish, and why plate haphazardly alongside a stack of lettuce? The italian burrata was also decent, but nothing special. Main course: my date got the lobster dish, which was quite tough. I got the salmon dish, which was good, although the saffron was overpowering. I am glad that at least the skin was crispy and the salmon moist. Dessert: Fudge bar - decent, though the vanilla was too strong and tasted alcoholic. We had high expectations for this restaurant, but in retrospect should have listened to the reviews. $175 for two people for a lackluster dinner was a big disappointment. I wonder how involved Zakarian is with this restaurant, because this did not meet expectations at all.",1,1,0,Andrew U.,"Philadelphia, PA",5,39,31
3.0,7/22/2017,"We at the upstairs Lamb Clubs Bar, which was practically empty on a summer Friday night.   The atmosphere was pleasant.  They have great booths with round tables that could hold 6-8 people for a group meal.  We had a 9pm show to attend across the street and our reservation was at 6:45 so we were totally unrushed.  As we chatted, the waitress came by a couple times to take our drink order before we had looked at the menu, and she was totally patient with our lack of progress.  We ordered the cheese plate while we decided, and then she came back and asked for the balance of our order, which included a hot appetizer, the arancini.  Oddly, the arancini and cheese plate then arrived at the same time.  Both were delicious.  The cheese plate, $22, included small servings of at least 5-6 cheeses, as well as quince paste, comb honey, and bits of fruits.  It came with a cranberry nut bread, which was also good.  The arancini were a bit over the diameter of a quarter and were served in a tasty mustard sauce.  We also had a mini-loaf of bread -- the regular bread basket -- that seemed to be house-made, like a loaf-shaped double height focaccia, but a bit too salty on top for my taste.As a main dish, i had the agnolotti pasta with marscapone and australian black truffle.  By itself, it didn't have a lot of flavor, so I requested parmesan cheese (which had not been offered) and I was brought a little bowl of cheese.  With the cheese added, the dish was delicious.  One would have thought that the dish would have had more flavor to begin with, but the net result was good.  I thought the portion was rather small for $32, which presumably was a function of the truffles (not that I could taste them).  My friend had the shrimp salad, which had 5 big shrimp for $25.  She also had a mixed drink from the specialty menu, $19 (!).For dessert we had the petit fours plate, which came with two each of a delicious pistachio macaroon, two blueberry gel-filled white chocolate candies, two strawberry gels, and two rich chocolate sandwich cookies.  Delicious.Bottom line, I was happy with the meal, but at this price point, I should have walked away wowed, not just happy.  Wheelchair accessibility notes:  We ate at the bar on the second floor, but there is an elevator.  One also needs to take an elevator to get into the building to begin with.  It exists, behind a door to the left as one enters from the street.  I think that first elevator only goes to the first floor (where the dining room is) and then one has to transfer to a second elevator to get to the second floor.  Not sure about that.  There is a wheelchair accessible stall in the second floor women's room and the sign on the men's room door also indicated that there was a wheelchair stall there.  The stall itself is large and supplied with bars, but the wall-mounted toilet was quite low, which might be difficult for some people to get up from.  The sink is built into a count, so a wheelchair user could access it.  I don't recall the location of the towel dispensers.",0,1,0,Meg S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,137,0
2.0,7/20/2017,"Cook or con!?! Chef, it's time to come back and do a thorough quality check. We had a private function in the private room last night and was very disappointed in the food. The short rib was inedible. You couldn't even cut it. The salmon was grossly overcooked with some funky sauce that looked like mustard and tasted like yuck - did anyone taste that sauce? The bread was fair. The gazpacho was good but a little too sweet. The only thing that was decent was cheesecake to finish the meal.  Lovely room. Fine waitstaff. Seriously though, a quality check is overdue!My recommendation would be to go to the upstairs bar for some jazz and decent appetizers. Such a cool place.

5.0,7/13/2017,"One of the best lunches ever. REALLY good food. I'm very leery of celebrity chef restaurants and have been disappointed by several of food network star's restaurants. The Lambs Club was a wonderful surprise. We ate upstairs in the bar and it is a beautiful and very comfortable room. It's kind of deco and would fit in inside the Chrysler building. The staff was friendly and helpful. We were dressed very casual and no one seemed to mind. Thee of us ate and all three loved everything. The house cured pastrami was outstanding and the sandwich came with a tray of condiments for the sandwich, mustard, pickle slices, cartelized onion, red kraut, all excellent. The potato salad was amazing with just the right bit of herbs to really elevate it way above what you'd expect from potato salad. Gazpacho was pureed smooth and perfect for a hot humid day and the winner of the lunch was a Agnolotti pasta with marscapone and australian black truffle. It was one of those rare dishes that really make you step back and think and appreciate the flavors. A few glasses of rose and it was a perfect lunch.",1,0,0,Martin H.,"Maryville, TN",16,149,1

5.0,5/15/2017,"I will admit that I was a bit skeptical when my husband wanted to take me to another Mother's Day brunch. Especially after my experiences in the past at other restaurants. Well this experience was more than I could ask for. We were seated on time, which is very rare, today and were immediately welcomed by a nice waiter that quickly got us drinks while we listened to the performing band. My daughter had a really good time and spent moments capturing our day with social media. I think she had more fun than me and I was delighted by all the smiling faces and service. We were then guided to another room that other delicious bites which I wasn't expecting. I consider myself to be fairly picky about food, But today it was tasteful without being overly seasoned. During our intermission a gentleman named Tevon stopped by and introduced himself to us. He was pleasant to speak with and stopped by our table several other times to see that we were having a good time. Most of the time when my husband and I go out, no one besides the waiter is around, so this was so nice to see and he seemed to take a genuine interest in our experience.

1.0,4/11/2017,"We were so looking forward to our after theater dinner at The Lambs Club - at least until we arrived.  Rather than write a lengthy review, I will cut to the chase.  The service, from the front door to the server, busser, runner is just awful.  No one really knows how to do their job.  There is virtually no hospitality.  Our server was completely incompetent and totally lacking in any personality.  Bussers had no idea how to properly buss a table.  No one ever noticed the empty cocktail glasses, used flatware and side plates, and there appeared to be no one in charge - or no one who cared.I believe my reservation included some notes - something about it being my birthday!  The server was certainly unaware of this (and pretty much everything else and appeared at the table after our entrees were cleared with the check book in her and and asked, 'would you like anything else?"".  I asked her, 'what else is there?"".  She looked confused so I asked her, ""do you serve dessert here?""  She said, ""yes, would you like a dessert menu?"".The room could be attractive if not so bright.  Our food, though extremely small portioned, was quite good.  Clearly I am not the only one disappointed by  The Lambs Club.  3 Stars is not high praise!  I've had better experiences at Mr. Zakarian's other restaurants include Georgie in Beverly Hills.If you'd like to see how it's all done correctly, take your staff to dinner at Le Coucou.  A small price to pay for a whole lot of learning.It's odd how an entire day can be ruined by a terrible after theater dinner experience.",7,1,0,Don F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,7,0
3.0,4/9/2017,"I've been here twice, once for pre-theater dinner and once for a normal dinner. I can say without reservation that this is primarily a pre-theater dinner place, because that's apparently the only thing they know how to do well.Our pre-theater dinner experience was very good. Letting them know you're going to a show puts you on their fast-track -- both with the kitchen and generally, with the service. However, last week I decided to treat my Mom to a dinner here at 6:30 pm. This experience was far less satisfactory, starting right at the door, having to repeat my name a ridiculous 4 times for the maitre d. Who apparently refused to say the simple words, ""I'm sorry, I didn't get that, could you please spell it out for me?"" Instead, he just stood their quietly looking up the reservation. Over and over again. Until finally he understood the last name. (Been to thousands of restaurants in my lifetime and this is the first time my last name was an issue.)Seated at a great table in the middle of the restaurant with a beautiful view of the fireplace. Very warm dining room with the fire going and completely full of people.Wait more than 5 minutes before we were even acknowledged by someone on the waitstaff. Not a good sign. No menus, no water, nothing. Just us staring and talking with each other, awkwardly waiting. And waiting some more...Finally our waiter shows up, no name given, and asks if we would like ""Sparkling or still?"" Actually, I'd like tap, because NYC tap water comes from upstate and is perfectly fine to drink. But in an effort to bump up his tab, he didn't offer that as a third choice (although later, we saw other tables were offered it just fine). Our waiter was rude and completely standoffish the entire evening.He gets us some menus. Another 5 minutes later, the water finally arrives. Another 5 minutes after that -- 15 minutes into our seating, mind you -- we're finally offered to have our drink order taken! No apologies, nothing. Just, ""Hey, I'm doing YOU a favor by waiting on you.""Drinks take an excruciating 10 minutes to arrive. We're nearly a half hour into our experience, and we finally have something to drink other than water. Wow, awesome! Thanks!ANOTHER 10 minutes later, our waiter deigns to wait on us and take our food order. We are warned that the Dover sole we ordered will take extra time to prepare. Finally, a warning about the wait that is actually accurate and appreciated. The food -- as it was on our first visit -- was delicious and without complaint. Everything was done to our liking, and the Dove sole was truly exquisite. We also ordered a few desserts, and by that time -- after 8 -- the restaurant was completely cleared out with only a handful of other tables still eating. (As I said, this is clearly a pre-theater dinner place). This restaurant is not some place I would go again, as the service is just too poor and without apology. The waitstaff -- of which there are many -- seem completely to disregard things like delays and waiting on their customers in a timely and thoughtful manner.

We were immediately asked if we were going to a show and what time (8pm Hamilton). After being seated, the waiter already knew about our show. He suggested the 5 course tasting menu ($105/person). Note that they DO NOT have the pre-theater menu that is on their website for $60. The service was ok. They did a great job keeping the water glasses full and asked if we wanted more bread (get the bread! It's amazing!). All of the food we had was good:-Yellowfin Tuna Crudo, my favorite of the night. But they only give a plate of 5 pieces and with two of us a fight commenced over the last one. I won as I was paying for the meal (since the boyfriend paid for the hotel)-14 oz Creekstone New York Strip au Poivre, this was my boyfriends meal. He said this was probably the best steak he had ever had. Perfect cook and temp. -Crispy Skin Corvina, my meal. Was very good. Perfectly cooked and falling apart. The crispy skin was amazing. The two pieces of gnocchi were amazing...wish there was more instead of the rutabaga.-Sides of Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower. The sprouts were soo crispy and good. The pairing with apple slivers was amazing. Definitely going to try that at home. The cauliflower was an experience. So many flavors and so good.My only complaint was that the wait time between ordering and our starter of the crudo seemed to be extremely long!

What was truly appalling was the service. Generally, I care way more about the food than the service, but there was no way the food could make up for it in this case. We went here with a group of seven for a pre-show dinner. The waiter forgot my appetizer, which was fine, but only the tip of the iceberg. Two in our group have Celiac disease, and they ordered the gluten free pasta. They were told only when everyone else's entrees arrived that they didn't actually have gluten free pasta. She then asked for a steak without the sauce on it, and the steak came with sauce on it. She ordered ice cream and specified that it shouldn't have a cookie in it, and it came with a cookie in it. All of this could have been tolerated if our server was apologetic or even nice about it, but he just kept insisting it wasn't his fault and by the end, he literally wasn't even speaking to us. Add in some weird confusion about two of the waitstaff asking us if we wanted to see the sommelier before we actually got to speak to the sommelier, courses arriving at staggered times, not getting things we asked for like butter or water, the coat check losing the tags on our coats, and just general miscommunication between the staff, and this was a bewilderingly bad experience.

If you want a TV/celebrity chef, go to a Batali place or Marc Forgione (hell, even the most recent Bobby Flay place is supposed to be pretty good). If you don't fit into any of these categories, you only have the choice of thousands of other restaurants. Depending on what you order, things can be excellent to average, but I can't say any one dish will make you say ""wow.""  The prices are pretty much what you should expect.  Have never really had a problem with service.",3,3,0,Chris K.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,333,8

The wine we chose (Alain Graillot Crozet-Hermitage 2012) had marble size pieces of sediment. When we told sommelier about this she shrugged and said ""sorry.""  Service was fine otherwise.

1.0,1/5/2017,"My steak was over-cooked. I asked for medium rare. Didn't want to send it back because it took too long to get to the table in the first place. With all the gristle in the steak, it probably only had about 20% digestible meat. The meat was so tough that my jaw was sore from chewing. When I commented my displeasure to the waiter, he went in the back as if he was going to express my displeasure. He never came back; he went about tending to his other clients. WIERD... I got his attentions and asked him to find out my $50 steak was so tough. He came back and told me that the chef said that I must of got a cut from an animal that was stressed. Then he went on to tell me a story about Japanese cows that are massaged and have music played for them so that their meat is really tender but that those steaks could cost $250. Again... WEIRD.

3.0,12/27/2016,"This is my third visit to the Lambs Club and it was, overall, enjoyable.  But, again, the execution could use some work and there were a few strange experiences.Let me kick right off with the weirdest wine experience I think I've ever had.  We asked the khakis and tennis shoe-clad sommelier for help with the wine, explaining that three of us were having fish and one was having lamb, and that we were happy to order a bottle plus a glass for my lamb-eating friend if he felt that was best.   He then asked if we had a preference for region and price range, where by my table agreed to ~$100 for something from Italy.  Like that, he took the wine list from my hands and disappeared, without saying a word. No recommendations, no options. Five minutes later, he came back to the table with an already-opened bottle and poured away for all of us.  He never presented the bottle to us, explained what the wine was, where it was from, etc.  Of course, I had no idea how much it cost, although I did give him guidance, as I stated (it wound up being $110, so fine, it was on budget).  I called him back and asked what I was drinking and he literally read the label verbatim and then left.  REALLY weird.  I don't think anyone of us, all who are frequent fine dining patrons, had ever experienced anything like that.  I mean, at least tell me what I'm drinking!The food was very tasty on this evening, but they execution was a bit off.  We ordered the Dover Sole for two, which was beautifully prepared, but it took 15 minutes from presentation to table delivery, which left the fish totally cold.  My friend's lamb was also tasty, but it was way overcooked for medium-rare, bordering on medium-well.   The flavors of the burrata, kale salad and pasta were all excellent.  The Baked Alaska was a great finish, but the Chocolate-something dessert left a lot to be desired.Also, if you look at my previous years' reviews, you'll see that they seated us very late.  This was the case again.I don't quite get it.  Great food, but the ultimate delivery is just off.  I think that was probably our last visit.",4,5,0,Chris U.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",73,235,111

1.0,10/24/2016,"A family member set up a dinner reservation at the Lambs Club to celebrate our engagement that happened earlier that night. While we arrived in very high spirits, we unfortunately left disappointed due to the service.They had a minor miscommunication when they brought us up to the second floor to be seated and realized our table was not actually ready yet, so they had us stand and wait for a few more minutes. Once they were ready, they noted our party wouldn't be able to sit at one table and a few people would need to sit at a booth nearby. We thought it was a very reasonable request given our group size. Our parents didn't mind sitting in the booth, but my fiance asked if we could add a chair to the table so he and I could at the end and sit strategically between the two groups. One of our waitresses, Stephani, looked visibly annoyed by his request and asked if he really wanted to do that, implying how inconvenient it would be. I already suspected she wouldn't be the most gracious of servers, but I waved it off immediately because I was busy still feeling the aftereffects of being newly engaged. Unfortunately, it didn't get any better. Our waitress Stephani continued to be unreasonably rude almost the entire time she had to interact with our table and even rolled her eyes in front of us. It was a bit bewildering.We were all hopeful that our meals would be the silver lining to the dinner service. Our prix fixe menu started off with delicious appetizers that had us excited for the rest of the meal, but it was all downhill from there. After the apps came and went, we waited nearly an hour more to receive entrees that were barely warm. None of those who ordered steaks actually received it the way they asked for it to be cooked. One friend received a well-done steak (and had ordered it medium-rare) finally mentioned something, and the manager came to our table immediately and apologized, which was much appreciated. Our friend did get a new steak, but it came about 30 minutes after everyone else finished eating. Amazingly enough, the sides to our entrees also came around this time too.It was well noticed that Stephani's behavior changed dramatically after the manager spoke with us. She was suddenly very sweet and expressive, acknowledging our proposal for the first time in the two hours we had been there and raving about the complimentary desserts coming because of the steak mix-up. Our desserts still came almost 45 minutes later. We really couldn't understand how everything was so poorly-timed throughout dinner when the restaurant was nearly empty.Our guess about Stephani having some weird issue with us was confirmed soon after: my sister actually overheard her complaining to someone else in the bathroom about our table. She called us ungrateful for not finishing all of the complimentary desserts. What was supposed to be a great dinner to celebrate our engagement ended up being a bit of a buzzkill due to the service. We all did our best to ignore some of the issues we experienced at the Lambs Club, but it was the dismal service we just couldn't wrap our heads around. Guess who was nearby the exit and made sure to make eye contact and roll her eyes at us as we left? From start to finish, the unprofessional service was simply unacceptable.My sister also complained about the experience and was told she'd receive a call to address our concerns about the service, but no one ever called.",21,15,8,Michaela D.,"Chicago, IL",111,13,5

With a jazz band playing in the small room, I'm sorry the band didn't just play music, which would have been  preferred to the singing.Since it was brunch, the menu was very limited.  My husband ordered scrambled eggs, hash browns and bacon with a glass of orange juice. I ordered the egg white frittata with chard and herbs. I mentioned to the waiter that I'd like a glass of heavy red like a syrah and he brought a taste of a Sicilian red, but it was far too light. He offered a glass of Beringer Cabernet, which I declined, as I stay away from $10 bottles of wine. I advised that I'd have water with my meal, which he ignored, and brought a wine menu. He opened the page with wine by the glass.  However, the waiter definitely left the impression that he wasn't enjoying finding a wine that I'd like. Ultimately, I selected a glass of red from Tuscany.The meal came out and it was fine, but nothing spectacular. While there were fresh herbs on the frittata, you couldn't taste them. We decided to finish and leave, but the waiter was no where to be found. So, we waited ... and waited. After ten minutes of sitting there, we finally asked for our waiter, who kept himself in the kitchen. We asked him for the check and, again, he was gone another ten minutes. We just wanted to get the hell out of there, but he and our check were no where to be found. A second time, we had to ask for him. He finally came with our check.

What a nice upscale place for a date. When we were seated, in a large luxurious booth, we were given specials and water refills instantly. The bread served was amazing. It was mixed with other grains and sesame seeds. So buttery and moist, we had to order a second helping. We still talk about the bread and how delicious it was to this day. We each ordered the three course meal, which sounded like the best deal on the menu. I ordered to start the Italian Burrata appetizer. It was presented in what looked like a small ball of mozzarella and ricotta cheese along with strings of lettuce, peppers, and a little bit of a pesto green sauce on the plate. Very tasty. Next I ordered a New York strip steak with shallots. Cooked perfect to my liking. Finally for dessert, ordered the ""Fudge Bar."" Oh my goodness.. it was heaven. A long chocolate bar filled with a chocolate mousse and white cream next to a dollop of creamy ice cream.

It definitely stood out among the many choices in NYC. Well, it stood out this past Sunday morning, as well, but for other reasons. It was a terrible experience! We made reservations for brunch, timed to enjoy the Broadway performance they advertise on their website. We were seated right away. Then we sat. Another couple was seated. We sat. Staff shuffled around, several stood outside the dining room at the host stand. We sat. Somebody appeared to take the couple's order who came in after us and disappeared. We continued to sit. Finally, we were able to get the attention of the hostess, who said she would take our order and did. Eventually the coffee came out - a half hour after we were seated - followed by the food, both delivered by runners. Nobody refilled the coffee, nobody checked on the food. We never had contact with anybody who could be called a waiter. Never! We did see a waiter at other tables but never at ours. My food was delicious, as it has always been in the past. My friend's potatoes were cold in the center but he ate them anyway (who was there to complain to, anyway?). But the meal was so overshadowed by painfully bad service. And the Broadway performance? They arrived 20 minutes late and took another 20 minutes to set up. We got to hear them practice as we left. This place is a far cry from my favorite breakfast spot of the past.

3.0,8/5/2016,"We would think that at $42. plus a drink ($21) plus tax and tip for Restaurant Week, a restaurant could and would make an effort to put its best foot forward to show what it can do and, hopefully, convert Restaurant Week diners into permanent customers.The Lambs Club failed on all counts.The low ingredient cost menu was chicken, fish or pasta.  Preparation was adequate but certainly not memorable.  Of particular negative note was the bland salad dressing (first course).While the service was attentive if slow, the selected 2nd floor venue was very noisy and unpleasant.We rate the experience at 3* and do not plan to return.",1,4,0,Nora C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,31,0

We went for brunch and we were majorly disappointed ($200 for two people) later. Very bad service. We had to beg our waiters to give us water and sparkling water. At one point, I poured myself our bottle of sparkling water that was on our table and the bus boy came over to scold me for doing that. Weird.Then our food order was incorrect. An entire ingredient was missing out of the omelette - small menu, seemed hard to mess up or leave an ingredient out. And they took away my entire meal to fix this error.The Bloody Marys had frozen Bloody Mary ice cubes that would not melt, so we couldn't drink our drinks. At the end, our waiter told us we were all settled since we had paid ahead of time. Then he ran out while we were walking out to tell us he charged us wrong and we had to give our credit card again. Very poor experience. Will not be returning.",3,5,0,JJ B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0
3.0,6/24/2016,"On our last day in NYC, hubby and I stopped here for breakfast before heading to the airport.  It was conveniently located a few doors down from our hotel, which was one of the prime reasons for our visit.  However, my sister had also eaten here (dinner, though) on her NYC trip the previous year and she really liked it.  So we had high hopes.For starters, I had a mocha. It was very good.  Not bitter like some that I've had.  It important for me to point that out because I can be very hard to please when it comes to my coffee.  I don't want it to taste too much like coffee.  I know, weird.There were several items on the menu that looks good to me but I finally settled on the Eggs en Cocotte.  I'd never had this type of dish and when I pulled up photos on a Yahoo image search it showed cute little egg dishes in ramekins.  (For real, look it up.)  What I ended up getting is this ginormous metal dish.  So not necessarily a bad thing, although definitely not as cute.  Inside it was filled with San Marzano tomatoes, capers, pecorino and fennel.  It was suuuuuuper savory and tomato-y, and for me personally, just too much for breakfast.  Hubby fared much better with his Huevos Rancheros, which definitely was a savory dish but in a better way.I did enjoy the bacon and hash brown potato cake, though.  In fact, I would've been okay with just eating that.  Actually, throw in a plate of biscuits and gravy and I'm good.It's hard to judge a restaurant based solely on a breakfast experience, but I have to be fair.  It was good.  Food was fresh and tasted nice, but it just wasn't what I was looking for.  I do know that if/when I have another trip booked to NYC, I would definitely come here again but for dinner next time.  I think we would fare much better.",1,3,0,Dianna S.,"Joplin, MO",255,443,59

These guys and gals, men and women, in their power suits and stylish dresses, with nice hair and expensive accessories, who look like they belong in these blood-red, mock art deco surroundings, reek of the sleek executive suites and corner offices they just came from. And suggest the concerts, benefits and Broadway shows they will soon be departing for. And I, midwestern rube that I am, just sit down among them at the comfortable bar. The bartender-ess is very friendly and spends a good amount of time vigorously stirring my martini. Which is very drinkable. And $22 (before tax and tip).

5.0,5/29/2016,"We went to dinner here last night to celebrate a friend who recently passed the Bar. The four of us enjoyed lovely cocktails made by Patrick at the gorgeous 4-seat bar in the lobby. Patrick made us each a delicious cocktail from the menu and then was kind enough to make us a special cocktail that we had the recipe for - Turn of the Century. He did an incredible job and really set the tone for what was to be a fantastic evening that none of us will soon forget.  For dinner, we were seated at a cozy circular booth and champagne was presented to us (my husband mentioned that we were celebrating and asked if the champagne could be brought just after we sat down - and the staff was more than accommodating). Not only was the champagne super cold and the best I have ever tasted with wonderful tiny bubbles ... But it was opened by saber!  Yes!  By saber!  We were blown away by this fabulous and celebratory gesture and will definitely remember it forever.  I wish I had gotten the name of the sommelier (that's the only name I don't think I got), but he was wonderful. Also fantastic was Yvette who was effervescent and charming and who made sure we had everything we needed the entire evening. And there were many servers who just appeared at all the right times, but who were also never intrusive and just sort of did their magic and disappeared - only to reappear at exactly the right moment. That is a service style that is a fine art and pretty rare to find these days. Our food was excellent. The flavors were incredible and unique and exciting -- all the things you want when you take a night off from the kitchen to go out and celebrate something very special. This was my second time eating here and I have been really impressed both times. The restaurant isn't in a part of town that a New Yorker like me usually hangs around in (Times Square area), but it is a very stylish and beautiful Deco oasis in the bustling Times Square/Theater District area.

The wait staff was extremely snooty and had no interest in pleasing us because we were young and didn't look like we had money to blow.

The brunch menu isn't very adventurous, but it's superbly well-executed by a high-quality kitchen. I asked for my scrambled eggs prepared well-done, and they actually listened.

The main course was alright, I didn't know what to order so the waiter recommended the duck Latka with fresh greens. I ate it but it wasn't phenomenal. It lacked flavor but I enjoyed it. I followed up with dessert which was incredible. I ordered the semi freddo mango sorbet with tapioca and garnish of pineapple, excellent!

Best burratta and grilled octopus I've ever had. They give you really crusty bread to spread the walnut and pancetta marmalade and burratta on- amazing. The grilled octopus was perfection- definitely something you have to try. We also got the tuna tartar, which was very good but nothing like the burratta and octopus. The entrees were a different story. I was deck dog between the striped bass or Delmonico steak- I got the striped bass and it was a mistake. Nothing on the plate stood out. It was good, but disappointing after how good the appetizers were. She got the corzetti pasta, which was super salty. Again it was good but nothing crazy.

1.0,4/19/2016,"This was unequivocally the worst service I've ever had in my life. Friends and I were in town for a wedding and the restaurant was referred to us by the concierge at the JW down the street. We started off by ordering a modest bottle of cab. When the wine arrived, my friend tasted it and the bottle was bad. We all took a sip of the wine and there was absolutely zero question that there was something wrong. It was extremely sweet with a port-like taste and tasted more like a dessert wine. Given that this was all the first time any of had actually sent a bottle back we were all somewhat perturbed to begin with. We'd apologized and when they sent the sommelier back over to the table he'd openly disagreed and told us that it was a naturally sweet wine and that there wasn't anything wrong with it. The awkwardness and uneasiness of the interaction was something we could all get past but the real issue presented when the bill came. There was a $50 fee for water so we politely brought it to the waiter's attention and she said that we'd ordered distilled. We were all taken aback and she said that she'd get the manager. When Richard (manager) arrived we explained the situation and the fact that we were asked if we'd like sparkling or ""normal distilled water."" He told us that he couldn't help us and that we should have paid attention when the staff presented the options. Further, he'd added that, ""we should be aware of this when we're at a nice restaurant."" Not only was he extremely insulting to us as we explained the lack of communication with the water but he'd also denounced his own staff. We had an extremely friendly waiter named Stephen whom Richard the manager referred to as ""just a bar back"" as we tried to highlight our satisfaction with the meal and Stephen's professionalism. I could go into much more detail but the point of our dissatisfaction had everything to do with Richard's extreme lack of professionalism. Our bill was around $400 and we were absolutely not looking for any concession. I'm awestruck that Richard is a manager and based on our interaction with him and the sommelier, would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",2,4,0,Adam F.,"Chicago, IL",152,2,0

For example, the fish course.   One dish stood out apart from the rest, the lamb.

I got to the restaurant at 605 and I had a 3 course meal and was in my chair at the theater at 7 PM. The staff here really knows what they are doing. We arrived and our coats were taken right away. We were escorted to our table and about two minutes later the waiter came by to bring us menus and ask us what type of water we would like and, also to ask what time our show was.We were told we would not have time for a proper appetizer and then entree so we ordered an appetizer (the tuna tartar) and our entrees (the duck and the spicy crab spaghetti). Also we ordered our drinks, we both got the ""smokin' margarita"" as it contained egg whites and we were intrigued by this fact. Bread was brought by next and I wish I could remember what they said the bread was made with but it reminded me of everything bagel bread. It was warm fluffy and delicious. I would have had another roll if I had time. The tuna tartar was amazing. I love tuna tartar and I order it often BUT this tuna tartar blew me away. It was so fresh and had a taste that made me want to keep eating I could have definitely had a whole order myself.Duck is not my usual order but my friend who accompanied me likes duck and being that we were at a fancier place, she wanted to try it. The duck was great not that I have much to go off of but I enjoyed it.I ordered spicy crab spaghetti. I'm Italian, I eat pasta like its my job - I do not order pasta out unless it is something I know I will not be getting at home. I however knew this was Geoffrey Zakarian's restaurant and if I was ordering pasta it was not going to be like anything I had ever had before. It was not. This spaghetti was spicy and lemony with fried shallots. There were so many flavors that went together so perfectly. I can't even begin to explain the journey my tastebuds were taken on tonight - but it was fantastic. Our plates were cleared and we were given dessert menus. I'm a sucker for dessert. I just can't say no. This menu did not disappoint. The first item on the menu was a chocolate crêpe cake, I knew that my search was over. We ordered and the cake was brought out 2 minutes later in a beautiful presentation. But who cares about presentation - I was disappointed by the size of the piece of cake because I wanted more. I wanted to take it home and let my whole family try it. I wanted it to be my birthday cake. I would come back to the lambs club for dessert only if I could.

The food was delicious and generous: tuna tartare was fresh, Italian burrata was creamy, pork belly was tender and the sauce not too strong, the scallops were flavorful, and the desserts weren't too sweet. The service wasn't particularly friendly but was nonetheless very good, never rushing our courses and always attentive. The ambience is lively and cool. Definitely recommend a visit to the Bar.

3.0,1/24/2016,"Summary:  Decent spot for a relaxed conversation and meal.  Food is adequate. Service better. Let them know if you have a theater reservation, as this speeds it all up.Atmosphere:  There is the Lambs Club downstairs and the Lambs Club Bar upstairs.  They serve similar food.  The decor downstairs is retro red upscale, Hollywood regency. Upstairs is similar, but just not quite as posh looking.  Seating for 2 tops is a bit awkward along the railing.  If you have a four top the seating along the booths is slightly better.  It's fine once you are settled in, but chairs angle strangely.Service:  Huge props to the team work.  They were attentive and professional.  The food was slow coming out, but at the same time, when it was presented, it was warm and well provided.The Food:  This was the restaurant week menu and I would say it was rather average.  Edible and fine, but not exciting.Avocado soup - nice broth with avocado chunks. It tasted fine, the avocado was fine as was the beef broth.  I just couldn't figure out why they should be together.  It almost reminded me of a tortilla soup, but that soup, i know why the avocado is there.  - 3 stars.Hamachi tostado - Not bad.  It was good, but I can't say it sang to me the song of fish on bread as it can do in more of a Japanese restaurant. - 3 stars.Burger and fries - The bread and fries were quite nice on the burger.  The burger meat is pretty good. But I ASKED FOR MEDIUM!!!  There is somewhat sick rumor that medium rare is the right way to cook all meat.  I really don't care how many famous chefs go around trying to proliferate this nonsense.  Fact of the matter is, when you grind meat up, your intention is to then have it come together again in a mass. If you cook it medium rare, it's not just about how much blood flavor remains, it's about the texture you create and if you're not medium (slightly red, but not bloody red) then you've just completely ignored a major element of food enjoyment... TEXTURE.  Does Lamb's club deserve this diatribe. No, Actually most burger joints are guilt and really... the NY Times probably deserves this diatribe.  so with that... I would say... not a bad burger and nicely fresh cut fries 4 stars. Scallops -- oddly unmemorable - 3 starsPineapple dessert - My friend was not a fan, but I was impressed with how the chef removed the acidity and masked the sharper pineapple to bring out the apply aspects of the fruit.  4 starsThe Chocolate Dessert - Actually pretty good, though I think nutella with a hazelnut on top seems a bit too silly.  4 stars.  The nutella was unnecessary and feels cheap in texture just use a dark chocolate sauce instead.",3,3,0,May L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",617,466,229

It wasn't even our actual waiter who took our order. The food was the next disappointing part. It arrived quickly but for the cost of the food it certainly wasn't worth it.  I had soup and pasta.

2.0,12/20/2015,"The prices at this restaurant advertise one thing, and what you receive is...not that. My experience at Lamb's Club would have been a 3 star experience if the price would have been half ($34 per person, not $68), so for $68 a person, not including $50 Bloody Marys, and GZ's name on the door, I expect 5 star service or better. Right away I noticed my knife was dirty. Not what I expect from a celebrity restaurant. I was with my in-laws and lady, and our server came over promptly and took our drink and food orders. Overall the service was OK, I guess, there were A LOT of guys refilling water and clearing plates constantly, which sounds good in theory, but in reality it's awkward and chaotic. The food came out in about 25 minutes, which is borderline too long considering the items we ordered weren't long ticket-time items, but everything looked ok. I had the Lamb's Club burger. Again, it was OK, nothing great or unique. The fries were good, crispy and seasoned well, and the ketchup had a nice zing to it. However I ordered my burger medium rare and it was more like medium well, sadly. Throughout this catastrophe, GZ was sitting in the dining area a few tables over from us, so he either doesn't know or doesn't care. My guess is the latter as I'm assuming this place makes money hand over fist. Overall, I would not recommend this place, considering the cost. If you're a tourist and just want to eat in a celebrity restaurant in Times Square, by all means, they will take your money. However, if you want to experience a celebrity restaurant that is run to perfection by people that know what they're doing, and for much cheaper, then I suggest you get back on the subway and head to 59th and go to Landmarc.",11,8,0,J.C.

The small room and red chairs are cozy, but its always bustling. We went before our show and it was very crowded, but I loved it. I would recommend making a reservation as we did if you are going around that time. I started with a beet salad. I usually dont like beets, but everything around the beets sounded good so I chose it. It was one of the best specialty salads I tasted ever in life and I would eat one every day if I was talented enough to put one together myself. I chose the NY Strip for dinner. It came with perfectly caramelized shallots, but only two. I could have made a meal of them. The boyfriend had one of their pastas, which by the way are served as ""sides,"" but still plenty to eat. I saved the best for last....the Panna Cotta. It had a dollop of ice cream, grape sorbet, meringue, and pear. Everything about this dish was superb! Tangy, tart, sweet, crunchy, everything...it left us wanting another order. So we went back the next night, right before close and grabbed another one.

3.0,11/18/2015,"It's hard to give a fair review of a restaurant when the service was abysmal, the food was above average, and the price was what I expected for a NYC restaurant, but I'll try.Not living in NYC, I visited the Lambs club with my family before a Broadway show to celebrate the umpteenth anniversary of my mothers 30th birthday.  We picked the Lambs club based on availability, online reviews, and its proximity to the theater.  The only reservation that was available was 5:15pm, which we figured would give us plenty of time to sit down, enjoy our food and make our show.  Please note that the restaurant opens at 5pm.As we arrived we were immediately sat, in was appears to be a hidden gem from the moment you walk in.  It is very elegant and to a degree upscale.  A scene that was not expected from the outside.  However, it was after we sat down the troubles began.  Unannounced to us, there were 3 different menu's for us to choose dinner from, and it took the waiter 20 minutes to bring us them.  By far, the best deal came from the pre theater menu, and thus, the majority of my family ordered from it.  The thing was, it took around 30 minutes for our server to take our drink order, and another 15-20 before he took our food order.  The table next to us actually sat down 15 minutes after us and had their main meal before we had even ordered.  When our soup came out it was the next major debacle.  We had three soups and one salad ordered.   The soups came out with their fixings (Broth missing) and were placed in front of us.  The broth is poured table side, however no broth had been poured.   These bowls with fixings sat in front of us for 15-20 minutes until the server arrived with the broth.  Trust me its hard to sit a restaurant for over an hour, have food placed in front of you and not touch it because it was completed for 15-20 minutes.  I wouldn't taunt my dog like this, let alone guests at a restaurant.  I had asked for the manager but he never showed.  Around 6:45 we finished our soups, and our main course arrived.  I ordered a steak and it was cooked perfectly medium rare with great salt and seasoning.  Sadly, the steak was cold.  Luckily the manager had stopped by to ask how everything was.  I was really about to blow my lid, but as it was my mothers birthday and we were running out of time till our show, i kept my calm.  I spoke to the manager about our experience, but all he cared about was the could steak to which he responded ""there were 200 people in the restaurant and if I wanted another it may be some time.""   I don't think he realized by now that several tables that arrived 30-45 minutes after us had already finished their entire meals.  Frustrated and angry, I went ahead and ate a cold steak.  The manager went ahead and comp'ed my meal for having to deal with a cold steak so I must appreciate them for doing this.  Overall the food was above average.  Nothing extraordinary, but better than average.  The service was well below par, especially when you are one of the first to arrive and the service can't keep up.  As far as the price is concerned, I love to eat out, and I'd say for it's location, although its a little pricey, its not too bad.Would I recommend, I would say be cautious and prepared for a bad service experience.  As far as the food goes, I'd go ahead and recommend for pre theater event.",1,6,0,Eric J.,"Clifton, VA",0,3,0

I checked in with the reservation desk and I was informed that my party was there - I was led into the dining room to be seated with someone who was not my husband.

So I conveyed that information with the fumbling crew and I just proceeded upstairs myself. Arriving upstairs at first, my spouse tells me the second floor host had trouble finding the reservation. Having a show to catch we proceeded to be seated. Our server was professional and very nice. Dinner was delicious - everything we ate was great. At the end of the meal our server gave us a dessert menu - we contemplated getting something and a manager I'm assuming - came by, never asked if we wanted dessert and took our menus. The server came by and inquired if the manager took our order - we said no and said he never gave us a chance. She was embarrassed and we decided to just get the check.

We ordered a couple of drinks each because guess what? It's 5 o'clock SOMEWHERE!!! These drinks are not typical. You dorm just throw some booze shake it up and serve it. They are creations and truly yummy! My boyfriend compared every cocktail after that to what he had there. Egg white frost on top of a drink? Not a drink you get anywhere. In addition to drinks we got the calamari and the meatballs. . So. Good !! I'm bummed we didn't eat a full meal because I have no doubt I would be thoroughly satisfied.

Of particular note is Sunday Jazz Brunch, which is amongst the best I've found in a decade in NYC from the food to the Bloody Mary's (try the one with lobster), the food (the omelette and the pressed egg sandwich), and the music-- a simple trio of bass, guitar and voice covering classics and modern songs in a nice mix. For dinner, if you're looking for something fast and slightly more reasonable try the bar room upstairs (the burger!) or for dinner try the duck or the Delmonico steak which rivals the version of that dish from its namesake off Wall Street.

The beautiful space, with a gorgeous (and huge) 18th century fireplace, is housed in a historic landmark building that was a former home of the members-only thespian society, The Lambs.      The food is reliably outstanding. Most recently, my party had the following, all of which was delicious: Beet salad (served with gravlax), crispy skin black cod, duck breast, NY strip steak (for those of you who end up asking for medium at steak houses when you really want medium rare, please note that they will actually serve it at the correct temperature that you asked for so no need to modify you steak orders to compensate for that). As for sides that the table can share, you MUST try the chickpea frites - delicious. Parisienne gnocchi is also an excellent side dish.      They also have a terrific sommelier (AJ Ojeda-Pons) who was also voted #1 best-dressed sommelier by Penfolds/GQ Magazine (who knew that was a thing?).

Dress code seemed to be business casual as a baseline.  Gents were all collared shirts,some included sport jackets.  All and all, really good place and we will return for sure.",12,0,0,J C.,"Morris Plains, NJ",0,16,1

The waiter said he'd be right back with the wine list. He forgot. I reminded him. He took my wine order and started to walk away. I had to remind him to take my husbands drink order.

5.0,8/12/2015,"We came here last night with my boyfriend for the Restaurant Week and were not disappointed. We always pick different things off the menu to try as much as we can and this time we did the same: Burrata and arugula salad were fantastic - fresh and full of flavor. I think that the salad was my favorite of the whole meal - light, bright, flavorful and summery. Another thing that you absolutely have to try - gnocchi. Just trust me. For the main course we had chicken and pasta. Sooooo delicious! The skin on the chicken perfectly crispy and salty (which is great with the little garnish of veggies it comes with) and the meat itself cooked perfectly. Fresh homemade crab pasta was fantastic - not fishy (which doesn't bother me but was a big plus for bf) and on a creamy-oily side (as it supposed to be!). As for desert - if it was appropriate to lick the remaining off of the plate in a public environment - I would. Perfect balance of rich, sweet and light.Portions were perfect for when you have a 3 course dinner - to fill you up and leave satisfied rather than stuff to death and roll out in a food coma.The cocktails we had were very tasty.Not sure why there were negative comments about the service.

2.0,8/6/2015,"I didn't know the Lambs Club existed until I was invited to a private dinner in one of the upstairs rooms.  This place is just an art deco visual delight...every inch of it!   From the concierge desk, to the lighting, the massive fireplace, to the lobby bar.  I couldn't wait to come back and when my friend's bd rolled around I knew just where to take him.The delight was really diminished by the Grim Waitress.  She was more well equipped to work in a mortuary, so serious, never a smile.  Even though I had dinner reservations she gave us snack menus.  It took almost 15 minutes to wave a bus person over to bring us dinner menus.  When I asked if there could be a substitute for the grain in the dish I ordered...She said ""No...we're really busy.""  Really busy with what?  Customers?  I'm a customer.  Come on...even the corner diner is more accommodating. The service was extremely poor throughout dinner. I was really disappointed about that because I thought I found a new go-to place.  Also, I ordered a monkfish dish which was very dry.  I didn't want to complain about the food or service and put a damper on my friend's birthday, but it was not good.  I was planning to come back to dine in the main room but I think I will pass.  I think this place is more suited just to enjoy cocktails, dessert and the live music.

There were several tables not near the noise that were unoccupied. We mentioned our complaint to the waitress, who just apologized. We mentioned it to the maître de on our way out, who said ""yes, the party had twice as many people than expected"" then added ""your next visit will be nicer"". Very inappropriate response in my opinion. We asked to see the manager, but after waiting for him/her for 10 minutes without showing up, we gave up. (This might have been their strategy).

4.0,8/4/2015,"Cool place overall. I came and had the theater prix fixe menu a couple of weeks ago and it was delicious. The dishes were well presented and you could tell a lot of thought went into the execution. For the appetizer I had the green asparagus gazpacho. It was cool and it had a nice summery flavor to it. I ended up dipping the bread into the gazpacho to finish it off (side note: the bread was so good at Lambs club)! My friend ordered the Italian burrata and I had a couple of bites. Next time I come here, I'll definitely order the burrata. It was creamy and light and the flavor of strawberry and onion were balanced perfectly over the cloud of burrata. For the entree I ordered the crispy skin black cod. It was perfectly cooked and deliciously flaky. The skin on the cod was wonderful although a tad heavy on the salt. I would order this again. For the dessert I had the vanilla custard with white asparagus ice cream. Talk about whimsical! White asparagus ice cream! It was a little strange and not your average flavor but it was definitely a good experience. Overall the meal was delicious and very modern.

5.0,6/22/2015,"For me, walking into Lamb's Club I felt like I should be in an episode of Mad Men. To start - the service is excellent - from the coat check and hostess to every server - I cannot say enough good things. The ambiance - swanky and sophisticated. First things first - we ordered some smart cocktails. My first - an Autumn Bonfire - tasted a little like an apple pie in my mouth. My second - a gold rush. What I love - the giant ice cube sitting in the middle of the glass. I was the only one who ordered an app in my party - I ordered the burrata - I checked the menu to try to remember exactly what was on it and it seems they must change the ingredients seasonally because the burrata on the menu now is different from the one I had 2 months ago. The burrata I had was served over a small bed of greens - it may have been watercress then as well. A small crostini of sorts - and a few more things that I wish I could remember it all - but it was just so refreshing and light with every bite. There were so many different textures between creamy, crunchy, soft, hard - and every kind of taste you can imagine in one bite - it was awesome. For dinner - I thought I was set way ahead of time on what I wanted - we all were set on wanting this cavatelli dish - then our waiter was describing this tortellini dish to the table next to us and my mouth actually started watering - I had to have it. We settled on me ordering the tortellini, my sister ordered the amish chicken, and her boyfriend ordered the cavatelli - all delicious!Cavatelli - the sauce was jam packed with flavor, and the lamb sausage was both sweet and savory all at once. The cavatelli itself did not sit too heavy - it was wonderful.The Amish Chicken - not only beautiful to look at the dish, but just heavenly to eat. It had a beautiful little foam on top of the chicken. The chicken was probably one of the most juicy chickens I have ever tasted in a restaurant. The Tortellini - stuffed with braised veal - which was so tender and flavorful. Tortellini well cooked. It had a delicious cream sauce with some olive oil that broke through. It was so good.

The food was OK, but less than special. Big problem: the jazz quartet singing and playing extremely loud in a room that was much too small for their volume.  We had to shout at one another to speak and be heard.  Horrible.Then, since brunch was served in an unappetizing flash, we had lots of time to kill.  So, we went to the bar area to have a glass of wine.  Surly, unfriendly staff there.Big dissapointment.  Why go back?  No reason.  Sayonara.",3,5,0,John B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,1,0

1.0,5/26/2015,"My girlfriend and I eat out on an almost daily basis. We frequent various types of restaurants ranging in styles, class and quality. It's one of the things we love best about living in New York. We often research and browse Yelp reviews for new places to eat. However, neither of us has actually written a review, despite experiencing some amazing meals at some incredible places. It's unfortunate that my first review, is a negative one.We've all experienced negative reviewers who are overly critical and whose comments are unfair. I have rarely been so dissatisfied with an establishment that it'd warrant a disrespectful or douchebaggery review, but when my girlfriend leaves a restaurant in tears because of how the staff treated her, The Lambs Club is lucky that my only reaction was a negative review.This past Memorial Day weekend, my girlfriend and I decided to stay in the city and enjoy a bit of a staycation. We reserved a table for two at The Lambs Club hoping for a bit of upscale dinning before catching a show later that evening. After reviewing the wine list, my girlfriend wasn't sure of what she'd like, so she asked what on their list was most comparable in taste to a Chardonnay or White Zinfandel. We realize these are not the fanciest of wines but these are wines she happens to really enjoy. Our waiter went to check with their sommelier (their ""wine guy"") who then proceeded to make-fun and mock my girlfriend not realizing our table was in direct earshot.He continued to repeat ""White Zinfandel? White Zinfandel? Really?"" In a snobbish, disrespectful tone you'd expect from the stereotypical wine guy. He made it clear our selection was subpar and was astonished we'd order anything close to a White Zinfandel. Dick.We asked to speak to the manager, who was quick to defend their sommelier and dismiss the situation as a misunderstanding. He did ask what he could do to make things better and an apology from Señor Wine Guy would have been a good start, but how comfortable would we really have been sitting through dinner in their establishment after that?We were looking forward to enjoying a delicious meal but were treated unfairly instead.

1.0,5/9/2015,"I am so disappointed to give The Lamb's Club 1 star due to being a fan of Chef Geoffrey Zakarian.  We came here our first night in NYC to celebrate our anniversary. I wish it was a more enjoyable experience than what it was.  We were seated in the upstairs dining room. We were greeted by our server and supplied with food and drink menus. Then we were greeted by our server, but someone totally different. We were confused. This continued our entire time there, one server would take our food order, but the other would take our drink order. It was confusing because we weren't sure who to ask if needed something. Now let's talk about the service.  Even though we supposedly had 2 people waiting on us, the service was absolute crap. The time between I finished my entree and when my plate was actually picked up was about 20 minutes.  Both of the servers would walk by our table and not even acknowledge the empty plates or empty water glasses or my empty beer glass which was sitting there empty for about 35 minutes empty.  We then decided to order dessert, it took another 20 minutes for the server to get our dessert. When it was time to cash out, it took 7 minutes from the time the server took our credit card to come back with the receipt. Both servers were very inattentive and neglectful.  I can't remember the last time I've experienced this bad of service in a fine dining establishment.  Servers should remember that tips are not mandatory, and that half-assing your job does not entitle you to the normal 20% tip. As far as the food goes, I had the NY Strip and it was cooked to my liking and it had a very flavorful sauce, very good. For dessert I ordered the carrot cake.  I was definitely disappointed in what was brought out based on the price. This place needs to get their service staff in check.

The bar is a small 6 stool bar outside the restaurant in the hotel lobby (as if I didn't feel like an outsider already). Bottom line, food was good...nothing spectacular.

2.0,3/13/2015,"This place is definitely to avoid..So we paid $100 per person for food only and what we obtained was poor service (the waiters had no idea who ordered what, and the waiting times were very long) and food I would expect from a deli!The burrata appetizer was just plain with popcorn, and while it was good its a big stepdown from the more traditional insalata caprese.For the entree I chose the ricotta civatelli and that was just a joke! Overcooked, overgreasy and oversalty pasta I would return in any deli..Desert was ok at best.Overall avoid this place where the food really isn't on par with the prices, unless dining in some kind of trendy and noisy nightclub is you thing.

3.0,3/4/2015,"Another restaurant I decided to take advantage of for restaurant week. I like the place itself...very swanky, sexy, low key....My dining partner and i had the hamachi and burratta to start. The hamachi had a very off taste- perhaps it wasnt the freshest? I did not enjoy it, the burratta was alright. I have had much better. For our entrees we had the cod and the duck...Duck makes me nervous but it was definatelly the better of the two... The cod was good. Simple, straightforward with a nice white bean puree to accompany it.Normally desserts do not interest me but it was definately the highlight of the meal. That chocolate mouse is heavenly! Kuddos to the pastry chef ;)The wine list makes no sense to me..I have never seen such high priced wine all around.

1.0,2/24/2015,"I had the worst experience here. My fiancé and I were visiting NY  for Valentines day weekend. We made dinner reservations here for a late dinner( around 10:45) on Valentines day as we saw a show before that. We got seated to a table with no server ware, no  napkins or anything.  We ordered our appetizers and asked our waiter for utensils he then responded that its finger food and we don't need it. We said we still wanted it and with a smart grin on his face he walked away and brought us utensils without any napkins. I then had to ask another server for lap napkins.  We then ordered out entrées for dinner. After around 30 minutes of waiting I asked  our waitress what was taking so long. She said they were working on it. After around 50 minutes we couldn't find our waitress and asked if we can just get the check because it was ridiculous we hadn't gotten our dinner yet.  She then explained that they ""lost the ticket"" in the back for our food order and they just started making it again. At this point we were so fed up we wanted to leave. They didn't even offer to comp any of our  drinks or appetizers or even discount it and we left and had a  slice  pizza at one of the local pizza places as it was already midnight and we were starving.

1.0,2/18/2015,....more like The Golden Girls Club.  My wife and I ended up here for lunch over Valentine's Day Weekend and we're still not sure why Geoff Zakarian chose to create a retirement center instead of a restaurant.  Stay away.....stay far far away unless you want to spend an hour and a half you'll never get back on food that's overpriced.  The stuffy vibe combined with the ridiculous lounge singer was just too much.  Side note...when you advertise a menu online you should probably honor it and have the same menu available for customers.  Brunch shouldn't be served all day.  It's not lunch and people under 70 may not want omelets at 1pm... especially when you advertise a completely different lunch menu that actually looked decent.That being said...the coat service was impeccable...lolI'm sorry GZ...you've been CHOPPED,3,5,0,Ryan T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,10,0
3.0,2/16/2015,"A cushy Midtown spot that caters to theater-goers and financiers alike, The Lambs Club is one of those swanky old Midtown institutions. While it can feel a bit stuffy, the Pre-Theater menu pricing is incredible and offers an array of good food options. I opted for the regular menu, but good to know that there is such a great dinner deal. I started with the Spanish Octopus a la Plancha, which was excellent. There was a very generous portion of Octopus, which was the perfect amount of chewy, and featured fantastic flavors. I then had the Slow Cooked Atlantic Halibut, which felt light and healthy. I could have done with a little more curry and zest, but the halibut dish as I had it is more of a safe crowd-pleaser, particularly The Lambs Club crowd. For dessert, I of course had the Ice Creams & Sorbets, and I was completely satisfied with.While the food was great, the service was a bit slow. Whenever we needed our waiter or sommelier, it took a while to flag them down. The time between courses was manageable, but on the slower side.

Apparently yes! The ambiance inside this restaurant is classy but not stuffy. For the appetizer my friend ordered the Winter Squash Soup which she enjoyed but upset that it was not enough. I went with the cured and raw Glazed Torchon of Foie Gras with walnut, radish, pomegranate mustard and a tasty Brioche bun ....at $26 this Foie Gras was superb and well worth the price! In fact I enjoyed my appetizer more than the entrée! For the entrée I ordered the Amish Chicken which was delicious with a good amount of chicken to eat (I was surprised and even had to give some to my friend because I couldn't finish it all...too bad I can't say the same for the foie gras...damn it!). My friend ordered the Ricotta Gnudi ...let's just say it was: ""she used the bread to clean off her plate""-that-good!

The food is beautifull presented and good; duck great according to the one eating it, great halibut according to those eating and I had a spaghetti with great pasta and overly spicey sauce, little taste. The salads were ok, not enough flavor or dressing on the one where we said be generous. Bread really good. The desserts were mediocre at best. tiny scoop of homemade ice cream, micro peach dessert--is this for those who live in microapartments? We would come back but wish you had more dishes for those not into eating raw lamb or beef or tuna, for normal eaters? But definitely worth a try..

Every single guest that sat on my floor was gone before 8, thats the routine. That being said me and my date had a dinner reservation at 6:15. We both had the three course menu and it some how took 1hour and 45 minutes to get all 3 of our courses or 35 minutes per serving. That is way too much time to be waiting! The food was not up to the price. The steak had a lot of grizzle and fat on it. I literally discarded 1/4 of it. The churrizo was like eating 2 chips with a fork. Our waitress was not good. Quiet, shy, and towards the end of our meal we literally had to get up and ask other servers to search the establishment for our waitress. 10 minutes later she was found and dealing with other upset guests and we found out the credit card machine was not working.

My only negative comment (and what prevented me from giving this otherwise wonderful restaurant five stars instead of four stars) is that I ordered the autumn squash soup. Bowl came with veggies already in it and then the waiter poured the broth into the bowl. The soup was delicious and was presented beautifully but for $16 a bowl, I expected the broth to at least fill half of the bowl. It did not. Broth was just enough to barely cover the bottom of my bowl. In hindsight, I should have said something but the waiter looked at me like that was the normal amount of soup. (Hard to believe.)

We got the older waiter mentioned in a previous review- accent, salt and pepper hair. Yeah, he's terrible. He comes up to the table and just hands you the drink menu- no introduction, nothing.  He asked if we wanted sparkling or still water, and then proceeded to bring us the wrong one, which isn't a big deal to me if you were at least friendly.  He wasn't. As mentioned before, the set up here is odd- a main waiter in a white jacket and tons of others in black that show up and serve or take orders. They run on top of each other- we were asked for our drink order twice from different people. It's kind of chaotic. If there were any specials (most likely a special on a Saturday, no?) no one informed us of them. Our waiter showed up with dessert menus, and when asked what he recommended, responded, ""it's all so different, I don't give recommendations."" WTF? I overheard another patron asking about a main course, and the waitress responded, ""I don't know. I've never tried that."" Come on people! What kind of restaurant are you running here?  WAY TO SELL IT.  Are they so busy that they just want to get away from you as fast as possible? I'm stumped. We decided to tip like octogenarians as punishment- only 15% - why you gotta force me into grinch mode around the holidays? The food: the tuna tartar was a little fishy- that was off putting. The ox tail angolotti was subtlety flavored, but the best dish we had.  I enjoyed the filling- a hint of ox tail, a hint of wine, but I think the food here is a bit tortured and over complicated.  Why not actually put some ox tail in the dish instead of pureeing it into ""ox tail essence?""   My husband thought the gnudi was, ""meh"" and the sauce a bit too salty. He enjoyed the spice cake, which came with little mounds of spiced marshmallow. The pear crisp was ""interesting""- basically a little square of custard and small diced squares of pear, tiered with hard, caramelized sugar squares- the whole thing was maybe 2 inches by 2 inches and again, tortured and over complicated.  I hated the fact that the sorbet next to it melted to leave a puddle on the plate, but I love that the judges on Chopped constantly critique other chefs for plating ice cream in this way, because it melts and makes a mess! Hypocrite much?  Last note: the portions are very small.  I am by no means a ""big eater,"" and I'm a small person, and the portions just sated me- I was not ""full.""

1.0,12/7/2014,"I certainly didn't go into this meal thinking I'd walk away from it wanting to give it such a terrible review, but that's what happened. First off, the food was absolutely delicious, which you'd expect from a restaurant with such a prestigious celebrity chef owner. However, the service -- which to me comprises a huge part of the experience -- was absolutely horrendous. It all started off ok as we arrived a few minutes before our reservation time, a party of 4. The hostess guided us to coat check and then lead us to a waiting area where we were quickly offered drinks. This was a great start. We were then lead to our table and the drinks were transferred and delivered to where we were now sitting. A waitress came to the table about 5-10 minutes after we were seated which seemed a little long. Rather than introduce herself or welcome us, she simply asked if we were ready to order. I had to ask if there were any specials. After ordering appetizers  from this woman another man came over and seemed to take over our table. Again, he didn't acknowledge us in any manner, just picked up where our waitress left off, but this seemed to be the operating procedure at this place. After taking our order, he condescendingly advised us not to order the spaetzle as a side dish because others were getting pasta. It was said, almost in a way as if we didn't know what we were ordering. Which we did and were fine with ordering. This was the beginning of our group feeling as we were being judged for being younger (in our 30s) than most of the other parties seated. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The food runner did an excellent job announcing each dish and correctly setting them. Drinks had been empty for 10 minutes, and we were not offered another round for the duration of our visit. Nobody checked in to ask how our entrees were. Dessert menus were handed out after plates were cleared. Still drinks were not offered nor was anything even remotely attempted to be up sold as we ordered dessert -- after dinner drink, cordial, Etc. Dessert was finished and we went from being poorly handled as a table to invisible. 30-35 minutes passed before we finally flagged down our rude waiter who brought us a check. At this point I asked to speak to a manager. I believe his name was John and let me tell you what a personable man this guy was. He didn't even hold eye contact when listening to my feedback. He apologized, but not in a  seemingly concerned way, more in a ""I'd like to just shut you up now"" kind of way. He left the table and had a conversation with the waiters involved just next to our table. To me, addressing the staff in front of us was totally unprofessional. Our waiter then dropped off the check which was appropriately discounted -- the one right thing besides the food the restaurant did. But at no point did the waiter say he was sorry or wish us a good evening. I wasn't looking for a discounted check, as justified as it may have been. I wanted a wonderful dining experience, where service was up to the standards I would expect at a restaurant owned by a respected chef such as GZ. It's too bad, I was really looking forward to trying his other restaurants. Now here I am posting about this.

1.0,12/3/2014,"This is just a bad hotel restaurant, period. And, I really wish I had read Cleo's review before going.  But I naively thought to myself: ""this is Zakarian's restaurant, surely it's good?"" Big mistake.Oh, where do I start?  We had theater plans, so we got there early to have a nice leisurely dinner.  I don't like to rush a kitchen and I like to enjoy my food, so I gave myself a good 2 hours to eat. Well, we sat down and a few minutes later this man (who I later found out was the ""captain"", so much more on that in a bit) comes up to our table and says ""do you know what you want to eat?"". JFC! How about: ""I'm Bob, would you like to start with some cocktails?"" Just a thought.  Not to mention he said nothing about the specials or the standard things one expects to hear about at a damn restaurant.  That's when I started to notice what this ""captain"" business was about. There are a few of them in white jackets in charge of taking your order and a sea of black shirted minions running around doing everything else.  It's a weird system that I imagine harkens back to a time when people put on their finery and went out for Chicken a la King.  So, we shoo el capitán away with a drink order, because for God sakes I can see how this is going to go from here and I need a cocktail.  At this point, I think the restaurant might just redeem itself because I watch a beautiful plate of pasta walk by me and then I squeal in delight as a truffle is shaved over it. Ah, fresh truffles over pasta is my kryptonite.  I announce to my dining companion that I am definitely ordering that because it smelled so good!So why the 1 star you ask?  Because I never got to order that damn dish. After cocktails arrived, whatshisface came back to again ask what we would be eating.  I prodded him for specials, which he recited with all of the enthusiasm I usually reserve for describing dental procedures. And then he gets to that pasta special. Again it sounded amazing, and as I'm about to say ""I'll take it!"" He lowers his voice and in a condescending tone reserved for that sales lady in Pretty Woman (Google this young'ins) he informs us of the price of the dish. If condescension could actually drip, we would have been sitting in a puddle. Are you kidding me??!! I was being paranoid you say? Well I watched him recite the specials with actual enthusiasm and no mention of price to a couple next to us.  But then again, everyone knows two women out for dinner don't have any money to spend. What with it being the height of Chicken a la King and all, we were just lucky to leave the typing pool in time to make dinner and then get permission to go have a girl's night without the boys.  The. Worst. So we order and our food arrives in less than 10 minutes.  We hadn't even made a dent in our cocktails.  I swear it takes them longer to nuke the food at Olive Garden.Here's what I ended up eating: The Burrata-it was fine, but I don't understand why there was a chicharrón on my plate.  It was under-seasoned and unimpressive. And I'm Mexican so I know what they're supposed to taste like.The Arancini-very tasty. But you could probably fry up a paper towel and it would taste fine. Jk. I'm just bitter. It was actually nice and melty on the inside and the sauce was great.  I don't know what the sauce was because sweaty overwhelmed busboy didn't know what it was and whatshisface never came back to check on us.My dinner companion had the Halibut and it was way overcooked. Which is impressive considering how quickly it arrived at the table.We shared the pear dessert and I really liked it. However, my dinner companion found it too light and didn't much care for it.  Then again, morale was very low by now. We then sat there until it was time to leave and almost died when we saw that the bill had the suggested gratuity with check boxes next to it.  Classy...If you did not personally experience the Carter administration (or think Mad Men shows ""the good old days""), please avoid.",7,9,1,Felisa R.,"Houston, TX",4,38,4
4.0,11/29/2014,Enjoyed a wonderful special birthday dinner here last night.  Clearly there are special touches in the way the cocktails are served in the way the ice is made so that it does not melt right away.  Hamachi & octopus appetizers were outrageous - so much flavor & just the right amount of tenderness.   For entrees I had the nudi with king crabs legs that was so tasty & my husband enjoyed the bolognese.   Service was impeccable and the vibe of the place was 40's art deco with jazzy music.  It was sort of quiet when we dined at 8:30 pm - seems like the crowd had left for the theatre.  A really enjoyable and special experience!,10,0,4,Cat M.,"Allamuchy, NJ",321,232,695

The food was ok, but the service was consistently extremely slow, with long delays to take our orders, deliver the food, or bring us the check. The third time was the most annoying, because we had been assured that we would get out in time for the 8:00 show 10 minutes away. At 7:45 they still hadn't brought dessert, and we had to urge them to bring us the bill.Also, the Lambs Club was extremely noisy. At dinner, we couldn't even hear each other across the table.

Beautiful, immaculate restaurant that just screams GZ if you know anything about him from the food network. My husband and I came for the pre theatre dinner. I had the burrata, whitefish, and fennel. Hubby had the corn soup, NY strip and chocolate gateux. We split the ricotta gnudi which was their special that day. I was pleased with my meal overall, however it started out on a negative note when I found a hair in my burrata after the first bite. Fortunately, our server was very gracious and apologetic. He brought out a new dish immediately and comped our drinks and the gnudi. I was impressed by how the situation was handled. The gnudi was mind blowing and definitely the best bite of the night. Everything else was just Ok, nothing amazing. I didn't actually like the fennel cake at all. It was waaaay too sour, even with the greek yogurt sorbet. We each had one of their specialty drinks, and I also had a vodka gimlet. After watching GZ whip up cotcktails on the Kitchen and IC, I was hoping to have my mind blown, but they were just OK.

Mapeet was very professional and helpful.  One at the Red Door Spa, Richard, gave me a quick tour - the spa is lovely with a great exercise room, small pool and hot tub.  All beautifully decorated and very serene.  Richard too was very professional and offered excellent guidance on a gift.  A visit to this lovely location for breakfast turned out to be a delight to the senses and I left feeling I had visited a very special  art-deco mixed with a modern edge museum.",3,0,1,Candice K.,"Port Tobacco, MD",277,74,17
2.0,9/15/2014,"Pretty disappointing overall. Had high expectations and everything fell short. Our Negronis were missing Vermouth so it was just a big gulp of gin and Campari. The service was strange, to say the least. Our waiter explained what an appetizer was. Huh? He also showed us our wine bottle and then disappeared for 15 minutes. Wish I could say the food made up for the uneven service. We had the Amish chicken which I'm pretty sure was poached. It looked really unappetizing on the plate but tasted okay, not very well seasoned though. The bucatini was incredibly salty and I can usually handle my salt. Steak was well prepared but with just a large piece of meat on the plate and nothing else for $40, it was pretty weird. Our server should have explained it came with nothing. The lamb was very good however. Can't say I'd ever return. Too bad because it's an interesting place with lots of history but I should have known better since it was practically empty on a Sunday night.",0,1,0,Stina P.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,49,0
4.0,9/10/2014,"Have you met the chef?! The one and only Geoffrey Zakarian! I wish I can replay my experience again. Although I can't visit this lovely place, I will give you a mental tour of my dinning experience to all of you hungry viewers. I went to this restaurant on a Tuesday evening. I was seated the second I told them the name of the party I was under. I am a native Californian, so when my business partners told me that they are having a business dinner on a tuesday night; I thought we would have a a whole restaurant to ourself, but boy was I wrong. This place was filled. Table to table was filled with people wearing formal attire (business formal)When the hostess showed me to my table, everyone at my party was seated and had drinks in front of them. The server instantly came to my side and took my drink order. I felt like a lonely soda drinker while everyone was sipping on apple martinis and upside down Manhattans. Judging by the beautiful designed drinks and the way my business partners were behaving I could tell everyone was starting off the evening with some fun with they're cups. The server came to our table and asked us if we would like to see the menu or if we wanted him to read to us. I was famished and exhausted from earlier in the day that I ignored the menu and asked him for his recommendations. He presented Spanish Octopus a la Plancha as the appetizer. It took me a few bites and I finished the course. I found that as a mediocre dish, but there was two things that  I did like about that dish and that was the saffron taste and the smoked tomatoes. During the read out loud, Kim, one of the partners, suggest we share a dish together, so our server recommended the New England Monkfish. I started wondering how we would share that dish together. My wondering stopped when I saw the food runner brought two plates to our table which was identical.  I was thrilled for listening to Kim for ordering the same thing. My dish was cooked perfectly. A took several small bites from my dish and didn't notice any fishy smell to it (I loved it!) I also had a good amount of heirloom tomatoes which was blissful. Lastly for desert I told the server to ""wow"" me, and of course he would bring me a dish made up of goat cheese in. To my surprise and to my coworkers it was a wonderful way to end the evening with a few sips of they're finest Thé des Sources (lets just say a tea you'll want over and over again.)Now as for my overall feeling about the place. I loved the fact that the restaurant gives you a good feeling about dressing up and having dinner at a formal restaurant. I think the prices was pretty crazy, but again the chef is a hot shot so of course the prices would be pretty up there. The food was delightful and the vibe of the place was great.

2.0,9/6/2014,"What a disappointment. Had heard good things from friends, but our meal did not live up to the hype. My husband's steak was so tough he could barely cut it.

4.0,7/21/2014,"As a huge fan of Zakarian, I was really looking forward to dining at the Lambs Club. Just listening to him on Chopped makes me melt. The man is genius. We had the pre-theatre menu which offered three courses for an amazing $50 per person. For starters we had the Gem Lettuce salad and the sweet corn soup. The large juicy English Peas made that salad happen. I enjoyed both but the sweet corn soup had so much depth and so many layers of flavors, it was like AXIS on a Thursday in the late 90s at midnight. Just fabulous! For the main course, I had the New York Steak which was perfectly cooked. So tender and juicy. And substantial. I expected a much smaller cut considering the price of the menu. Nope, it was a real piece of meat. And I know my meat. My partner had the Amish Chicken. It was so succulent. The cherries came out in the sauce and the dish was exciting. At first it looks basic but then you get the flavors in your mouth and it's a friggin fiesta. For desert we had the dark chocolate vodka cake and the fennel cake. I enjoyed very much the fennel cake. The Greek yogurt sorbet was the star. Overall, this was a great experience. The only negative to it was our waiter who had something up his ass.

3.0,7/21/2014,"3.5 StarsThis place has been on my radar for awhile as a place I wanted to try as Zakarian always seems to kick ass on any Food Network comp he enters and his food always looks delicious.  However, as the Yelp ratings were only so so, I kept putting it off until I noticed they were doing restaurant week, so headed over for lunch. We shared everything so I can provide input on a few dishes.Apps:Richard's Soup - Tasty, light broth, good texture to the zucchini, barley soaked up a lot of flavor.  Good, but nothing special.Tuna Tartar - very good, clean flavors, what I expect for a good tartar. Came with a delicate mustard seed sauce which I felt could have been just a touch less muted.Meal:Sirloin burger - ordered medium rare and actually got a great medium rare (hate restaurants that don't understand MR!). Was very juicy, and a lovely cheddar. Presentation was a bit odd, toothpicked the pickle to the top of the burger for some random reason.  Fries were meh. Chatham Cod - decent sear on the fish, harrisa vinaigrette was well conceived with a nice tartness combined with a bit of sweet.  Overall decent dish, but I've had some really great fish recently and this wasn't on that level..Dessert:Lemon Pound Cake - Yum. That sorbet is hella good. Mousse - I only had a bit as I'm not a big chocolate person, but I was impressed with one bite I took.Service:On point and attentiveAmbiance: Summary:Overall a good meal, but also a forgettable meal. Nothing wowed me and I won't be craving any of those dishes.  I already had lowered my expectations after reading Yelp reviews, but I feel like I still expected something more to stand out for a Zakarian joint?  I think if I had to pay normal prices I'd have expected a lot more, but perhaps they don't put as much effort into the restaurant week menu, who knows.

1.0,7/19/2014,"We went to the Lambs Club for Saturday brunch. Our reservation was for 1PM. We were seated in the bar area which is a pretty large area upstairs. To our surprise there were only 2 other customers in the entire room. This was a gorgeous summer day in NYC. How can any good restaurant be empty at 1PM? That was a good clue for the meal to come.We tried their lobster bloody mary cocktail and the grapefruit cocktail. Not bad but definitely very pricey. The complimentary bread and butter was good. However our main brunch was a total let down. I ordered the omelette with mushrooms and swiss chard. It was such an ordinary and bland omelette that I am certain I can make better myself. The swiss chard was chewy and the whole dish hardly had any seasoning. My husband had the strawberry stuffed french toast. He says it was good but not exceptional as was expected from a restaurant run by a celebrity and iron chef. Also the french toast had strawberry jam but no fresh strawberry on the plate. After asking if this was actually strawberry french toast, our waiter actually did bring out a bowl of some fresh strawberries. So kudos to him but not the creator of the dish or the chef.For the money we paid at this restaurant for our brunch, we could have enjoyed a much more delicious meal at a number of other establishments in the city for much less.

5.0,6/16/2014,"Here's my update for the second go-around with The Lambs Club.After I posted my negative review, I was contacted by their GM.  He apologized about our horrible first experience with them and offered us a gift certificate and asked us to come back.  We were a bit hesitant at first, but we decided to go back....and boy are we glad we did!This time around, we were seated immediately upon arrival and greeted by the staff and promptly by our waiter, John.  John was a very animated and upbeat character, who went through the menu with us.  We placed our orders with him, and then were greeted by Michael, the GM.  He again apologized for what happened to us the first time and presented us with a menu signed by Chef Zakarian himself.  That was a great touch.  He told us to enjoy our dinner and we absolutely did.The bread they put on the table was so warm and soft and delicious.  I would have eaten the whole basket, but we had so much food coming, so we didn't want to spoil our appetite.  For appetizer, we had the Wagyu Beef Tarter and their crudo special, Hamachi in olive oil and tomato water.  Both were so tasty.  We also ordered pasta.....Cacio e Pepe and house made Gemelli with Squid Ink.  OMG.....cacio e pepe was exactly how I remembered it from our trip to Italy.  Absolutely phenomenal.  I think I could have eaten 3 plates of that and that alone.  Gemelli was delicious too...it was a good touch to have the squid pieces mixed in with the pasta.For the entree, we had Colorado Lamb and the Black Bass.  The lamb was cooked to perfection in 2 different ways.  The loin was cooked perfectly medium and so tender.  The braised shoulder of the lamb just melted in our mouths.  The black bass was also prepared nicely with this mushroom sauce that we both wanted to lick off the plate (but we didn't...needed to stay somewhat classy).  We couldn't decide on the dessert, so we decided to share 3 between the two of us.  I know I know....this is not the first time we've done this and this won't be the last.  Tahitian Vanilla Panna Cotta was paired with white asparagus ice cream which was out of this world!  You get hit with a taste of asparagus right away, but then it turns to this sweet creamy ice cream with a hint of vanilla.  Yum.  We also had the Strawberry Mousse which came with lemon poppy seed cake and buttermilk sorbet.  Delish!  Last but not least, the Fennel Cake....which came with lemon curd and greek yogurt sorbet.  This was my BF's favorite...he loves fennel.  The lemon curd was tart and sweet, and I absolutely loved it!We're so happy that we gave it a go at a second shot....this time around the service was wonderful, staff was friendly, our waiter was fun to chat with and his service was impeccable.  The food was phenomenal and absolutely gorgeous to look at and delicious.  Thank you, Michael, for reaching out to us and making sure we came back for a wonderful experience.",4,1,2,Yukie P.,"Oceanside, NY",18,122,172
1.0,6/2/2014,"Let me start out by saying that I love NYC. I'm not from New York but I find comfort in it, being that I was born and raised in Vegas. I'm also an industry employee and I feel I have a full understanding of customer service (empathy included). My boyfriend and I have dined at this establishment once before in 2012. I have been raving about our experience for two years and was so excited when I knew I would have time to catch a train to New York and finally eat where I've been craving for two years. I will say I was not in fantastic business or theatre attire but I'm still a customer ready for a second round of an excellent dining experience.  I do not know our server's name (he never mentioned it but I have found this to be normal for some fine dining establishments), but he was an older gentleman with salt and pepper hair, tan skin and a thick accent.  I feel he snubbed us based on a physical/appearance profile. His whole attitude and demeanor held a sense of irritation with every interaction he had with us. He never checked back with us when our meals were served, never smiled, and barely made eye contact. I engaged more with the bussers/runners/table setters more than my server.  Drinks were delicious (they were suggested by the manager), and overall restaurant appearance was clean and classy. Lastly, I waited 30 minutes for the check and was then informed by a manager that guests had to inquire for the check because many international guests found it disrespectful if a server asked them if they were ready to close. Okay, fair enough. But, as a server, would you not inquire for additional items after dessert which would give the guest an opportunity to inquire about the check? Yeah, none of that was done. My food would have been excellent if the disdainful service hadn't left a bad taste in my mouth. I tipped 18%-20% because I thought the staff he should be tipping out deserved it. In short, I left the restaurant in a worse emotional state than entering it.  This is the opposite of what should happen from any dining experience let alone one that cost $200. I will only recommend this restaurant if they don't have the same unfortunate luck of sitting in our server's section.",6,2,0,Carisa M.,"Las Vegas, NV",81,11,1

Fish was expertly prepared and in my opinion I won the food ordering war.   I was in the mood for cocktails and ordered the Lamb's cup with was fantastic.  They also have one of the best wine lists I've seen so this is the place to play.  The Dark Chocolate Gateaux dessert with spiced chocolate creme brulee was heavenly.  I had the absolute pleasure of also meeting the man himself, Geoffrey Zakarian,  while we were dining.  Which really was a bucket list item for me as I am his biggest fan.  He was wonderfully gracious (I might have been a tad scary ticking across the restaurant fastly in my pencil skirt to catch him before he left).  He kindly obliged me for pictures which I declined my husband be in.  But thank you husband, man of my dreams, for this absolutely delicious dinner where I drooled over another man.  I'll attempt to be objective and tell you that even if I hadn't met the man, this was an absolute 5 star dining experience with a menu that is diverse and interesting and a wine and tea menu that matches it.  Enjoy!",13,6,6,Madi F.,"Round Rock, TX",615,368,1775
5.0,5/20/2014,"I had a wonderful meal at The Lambs Club! The bright red booths and dark walls give a bit of a dramatic atmosphere that definitely feels a bit club like. Food was incredible. We shared the lobster and the lamb loin. We shared the SpanishOctopus a la Plancha with Saffron Pain Perdu, Smoked Tomato, green Olive, and Chile. The octopus was perfectly tender and the ingredients served with it gave it so much flavor. We also shared the Fresh Spaghetti alla Bottarga with Chiles and Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Simple yet really beautiful in the flavors. A wonderful dish and we licked the plate clean! For entrees we shared the lamb loin and the lobster, again both were perfect. The lobster was so delicate and buttery. The loin was a lovely medium rare. Dessert is not memorable.

4.0,5/11/2014,"It's about the food and wine here - that gets 4.5 stars. We made last minute reservations which landed us in the mezzanine section. The food was beautifully prepared and very well executed. Our young waitress was attentive & charming; she seemed well trained, knowledgeable and helpful. She guided us to very solid wine-food pairings. Veuve Ambal and Steininger Grüner Veltiner paired nicely with amazingly flavorful, tender and perfectly cooked grilled octopus, spot on al dente spaghetti in a creamy fondu-like sauce (perfectly sauced) and English pea salad (fresh, crisp, well dressed, flavorful and perfectly balanced). We shared a dover sole (for two) which was absolutely delectable, lightly sauced, and cook to perfection. Scottish king salmon was fresh, medium rare and well liked by a 12 year old. Chick-pea fries accompanied by a mouth-watering eggplant sauce (I don't like eggplant, but loved this) were brought to the table compliments of the chef. We added two side dishes: spaetzle cooked with a smoky bacon preparation and roasted cauliflower. Petit fours were a delightful end to a memorable meal. The setting in the theatre district naturally attracts a pre-theatre crowd, so the space clears out before 8 PM. We were not especially enamored of the retro decor or ambiance; it seemed cool (read: not warm) and not particularly welcoming to us. Although clearly a pricy dining experience, we would return and recommend to others because of the well executed and superior food preparation and wine pairing.

4.0,4/30/2014,"After being contacted by management and offered both a refund on our bad experience and a gift card toward a future experience, I returned today with 2 of my colleagues.We were greeted promptly, had our umbrellas and coats checked, and after only a few minutes wait we were seated. (Again, we had reservations, but were a few minutes early-but our table was prepped promptly and we were seated right away.)Drink orders were taken quickly and bread (SO GOOD) was brought to the table. After some discussion, we sorted out our orders and the server took them promptly.Service was attentive and friendly--my colleague even got a high-five for choosing the best starter (the octopus, and it was scrumptious). And the food remained amazing. Everything really was absolutely delicious, and I can definitely see returning here for client lunches and special occasions. The wine recommendation was spot on, as well.This really just isn't the place to go if you are in a hurry. Lunch still lasted about 2.5 hours--but this time it was because we were having wine, starters, main courses, dessert, and coffee, and not because we felt forgotten. The pace was almost always appropriate. Most importantly, people checked in with us along the way, so we didn't feel lost in a sea of diners.The few moments where it felt off were (1) in between ordering and the arrival of the starters--but again, nothing excessive and nothing I'd really complain about after the first bite of that salmon tartare, and (2) after they picked up the check before they brought out the cards and receipts for signatures--I have no idea why this took so long, but the restaurant had basically emptied so perhaps it was a shift change, but someone came by to check on us and we let him know what we were waiting on and he went to check for us.It's interesting to me how hit or miss the experience is--based on looking at others' reviews--and I can't help but think with a few tweaks they could patch those gaps entirely and be out of this world.That said, this place is absolutely worth a visit and I'll be back--I'll just make sure it's when I have time to savor the entire experience and not worry about the occasional pauses.",3,4,0,Joetta G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",149,219,30

1.0,4/14/2014,Really was expecting more. My girlfriend wanted to eat at an iron chef restaurant in New York so we booked a dinner here while in the city for a show. The staff were friendly and professional and the room is nice in a clubby retro way. The food though left a lot to be desired. I really expected flavorful well executed dishes but they all fell short. The Dover sole was bland and poorly seasoned. The tuna tartare and steak tartare were both bland and flavorless. The bread on the table was definitely the highlight. For the price (I have no problem paying for a quality meal) I felt ripped off. Really amateurish for what should have been a really nice dinner. Maybe I would feel happier if the busboy hadn't spilled a glass of water on my girlfriend but the quality of the food was still mediocre.,5,2,1,Eric R.,"Flourtown, PA",8,130,2
4.0,4/2/2014,"We love Geoffrey Zacharian and had been here before for a cocktail class but first dinner here. Look at the menu prices before heading into this placeThe food was very good - the highlight were the appetizers, I had chicken liver pate which was delicious, my husband had the arancini balls, which I thought were too salty but he loved. I got the lamb, it was very well done and tender, perfectly seasoned. My husband got the New York strip which we thought was a little overcooked. The petits four were really outstanding (which is something because they're usually just pretty average cookies elsewhere) The cocktails here are delicious, I sent one back because it was too sweet but the second one was perfect. The service was NOT the best, our waiter came around about every 20 minutes and never to ask how we were doing or anything. He took our order....brought our food...dessert menus and the check (all of which we had to flag him down for because he was nowhere nearby) They took FOREVER to take away our empty plates once we were done, they also took a very long time to bring our food. Mind you, the restaurant was maybe 1/3 full (Monday) - maybe they have less people working the kitchen on Monday? I don't know but the thing is, when you're paying $200 for a meal this is not the kind of service you expect. Still, the food was very good (but not splendid) and the ambiance is very nice.

5.0,3/27/2014,My wife and I finally had a chance to dine at this beautifully appointed restaurant. It turns out that it is owned by Iron Chef Geoffrey Zakarian. His menu offers a wide selection of interesting dishes. My wife's celery root soup which was very velvety on your palette. I started with the Spanish Octopus a la Plancha. I love grilled octopus but this was the best I have ever eaten. On this particular evening the Chef had a unique spin on Beef Wellington. He offered this classic dish with braised short ribs. Delicious. My wife opted for the flown in daily Diver Sole. Cooked to perfection. Desserts were amazing. The profession service staff seemed to really enjoy working in this dining room. Unobtrusive but there when they were needed. After dinner we when up to their mezzanine bar for a nightcap to listen to some jazz.

5.0,3/18/2014,"This is my third time visiting the lambs club and can attest that it's the most consistently exceptional dining experience I have had thus far in New York. This is the kind of place where deals get made and significant others wooed- if you come here during the week and avoid the theatre crowds you will be in for a treat. Not to mention that even the third time the food is absolutely delicious.Try the chicken liver mousse if feeling adventurous for a magnificently paired arrangement of flavors, or the arancini di riso as a starter. The New York strip has emerged as my favorite dish and is highly recommended if you are in the mood for beef otherwise Spanish octopus is also great. I rave about lambs club to co workers and friends alike simply because the staff makes such a concerted effort to make sure you have a great experience. Again, this is a place I would never hesitate to bring clients or my significant other to thanks to the excellent food and service the entire staff provides ( they have a professional sommelier who curates everything on the list and makes rounds throughout the restaurant ) and more specifically- john who is thus far my go to guy when I am out for a special dinner in New York ( trust that he will move mountains to make you and your guests feel special). 5 star will be back again.

Food was good, I quite enjoyed the tartare, and surprisingly the stars of the dinner were the bread and the grilled romaine hearts that came with my cod dish. The duck dish verged on too salty. Of the desserts we had, the panna cotta as a whole was better than the flourless chocolate cake. The mango(?) sorbet didn't pair particularly well with the rich chocolate of the cake.

The hostess on the main floor was really sweet and mentioned that there was live music upstairs - SCORE. That music is the only reason this place gets 2 stars and not 1.After I was seated, I waited for 25 minutes for a server to take my drink order. The place wasn't even busy, there were maybe 3 other tables there. The drink arrived in about 10 minutes, which was fine compared to how long it took for someone to even come to the table. I ended up ordering the maccheroni appetizer, which was a great size for an appetizer but nothing special. I also tried their oysters, again, nothing to rave about.My drink had been empty for another 20 minutes before the server thought to ask if I wanted another. Luckily, the drinks were strong enough for me to forget how annoyed I was with the slow service.I probably won't be back, but it's a good spot for decent food and great live music if you have plenty of time and don't mind terribly slow service.",1,0,0,Jelena S.,"Denver, CO",60,100,33

Amazing trick, I've never seen such a poor display of poached eggs.

You will pay $6 for a cup of tea, which in my case was NEVER delivered to our table after multiple request - the waitress finally admitted that they couldn't find it in the basement (must have been eaten by the rats, mice and cockroaches). A bloody marry which is nothing special will run you $19. You will pay about $8 for a cup of Greek yogurt. Omelets are not cooked in a normal fashion and appeared to be made in a high speed blender based on the amount of ""fluff.""To end on a positive note the decor is great if your a dominatrix who loves red leather and big fireplaces with fake logs.

The waiter never returned to refill our wine glasses and when he did, he offered us the wine menu to order again. He had forgotten about the wine sitting in the ice bucket. Since our reservation was at 5:00, it wasn't particularly busy but we mentioned right off the bat that two of us were going to a 7:00 show. Upon receiving our delicious desserts, we asked for the check. It arrived at 6:25 and then we couldn't get our waiter to take our credit cards until 6:35. At 6:45, we stood up to get his attention. When he returned, he failed to bring our copies only the restaurant's copies. I spoke to the manager  and he was solicitous but it was too little too late. The service is awful!

1.0,10/30/2013,"I'm sorry to say my experience last evening was rather awful. Two of the four of us had a 7 pm theater curtain so we make our reservation for 5 pm to ensure a meal that was not rushed. When I arrived at 5 minutes to 5, one friend was waiting at the bar, enjoying a $16 ($18?) martini. I ordered a glass of wine from the steeply-priced wines by the glass list (a low-end one @$16, many prices were in the $20s and one was $50. Moreover, it was not a generous 'pour'). The third person arrived and decided not to order wine off this list (a little put off I thing by the steep prices) but wait until we were seated and ordered a bottle. The four of us all decided to order from the very limited pre-theater, prix fixe menu, assuming it would be simpler and certainly more economical....that $68 entree price for the sole sure caught my eye! I started with the squash soup. It was prettily presented....a garnished bowl, empty of soup, awaiting to be poured by the waiter. He did, and I enjoyed the very small amount he served very much. Very tasty, though could have been warmer, and left me wanting more. To be honest, the other appetizer was the tuna, and none of my dining mates commented one way or the other. Then came the halibut....which all of us ordered (again there are only 3 choices on the pre-theater menu). It was good...not sublime but quite nice.. But it was cold, and everyone else's was as well. Yes we should have brought it to the waiter's attention at the time but we just ate it....we had our theater curtain schedule to stick to. Meanwhile the bottle of wine we ordered was poured to three of us, while I was finishing the glass I'd gotten at the bar (after stopping the waiter from pouring me some from the bottle, into the different wine already in my glass! I'm no wine snob but that should be obvious.)  The waiter then never came back to refill our glasses. Finally, after sitting with an empty glass for 20-30 minutes, I flagged him down and asked for some wine. He brought me the wine list! I pointed out that we should still have some in our bottle as he had only poured three glasses! He did ""find"" it. But really, the wine service was shockingly bad for a restaurant of this so-called caliber. Dessert was lovely...if again, very small portioned. The final insult though was how long it took us to get our credit cards back after asking for the check at 6:30. Two requests, reminders of our curtain time, nothing. We finally had to stand up at 7 minutes before 7pm, as if we were leaving to get their attention. Then they bring the credit card slips to be signed, but only the restaurant copies, no copies for us. All in all, it was an extremely disappointing dining evening.",5,1,0,Janet W.,"Glen Rock, NJ",1,9,0

Room is lovely, all deco chrome and leather and a big cozy fire place to seduce you , I wanted to love it. I ordered the burrata starter which was indeed very tasty but since this place commands such high prices ( Dover sole for 68.00?!!, 99.00 for an appetizer with truffles? ) I think I can be picky about the presentation. It was served  in a small metal sauce pan.. Cheese with some pesto, that doesn't need to be cooked was slapped down on the table in sauce pan ? Wtf? It was awkward to serve myself by digging in the sauce pan for a hunk of cheese that I couldn't see. Since I can't imagine having someone over for dinner and setting their food in a saucepan in front of them I asked the waiter , he said the chef thought it was elegant served that way. Um no.Second I had the squash soup for 16.00. Let me tell it was a very delicious two bites of soup. I really am not exaggerating .the waiter placed an empty bowl in front of me and poured the drops of soup out from a bud vase size Carafe. It was so shallow it instantly cooled and my spoon could not be submerged in the measly depth. I felt duped and swindled after eating there.We did see Stephen fry fresh from the theater dining there , so there was that.

I was really looking forward to going here and had reservations a month in advance. I let the restaurant know that I'm gluten-free ahead of time; while they don't have anything specifically marked gluten-free on the menu I figured a place of this caliber would have no problem accommodating me. Unfortunately our waiter seemed almost entirely unfamiliar with the menu and wasn't sure what gluten even was. After finally figuring out what I could order I went with a few different small plates. The bitter greens salad was so salty I couldn't even eat it, the squash soup was just okay. After our small plates were done we were told the roast chicken we ordered would take another 45 minutes before it was ready so in general the meal was paced really poorly and the service was confusing and awkward.

Came here and it happened to be restaurant week, the hostess never mentioned that the restaurant week menu is only served upstairs and seated us downstairs. That being said I'm not a huge fan of set menus so we were ok with this part of the evening. Unfortunately the service was quite slow while the restaurant was almost empty. We had to ask for bread, water, cocktails, and for our waiter to come take our order. The appetizers in general were a disappointment but the oysters rockafeller were definitely the worst of the bunch. While the plate is decorated with rock salt it seemed that the kitchen had doused the oysters in far too much. They came out cold and too salty to eat. After mentioning to our server that these were definitely off, he said he would ask the kitchen. We never heard any feedback or got an answer to our complaint and instead he kept them on the bill! The entrees were much better but overall I don't see myself going back or recommending it to friends.

2.0,9/19/2013,"Meh, nothing to rave about. Came for dinner with my beau who wanted to try it. Walking into the place, it definitely had a 50's art deco vibe with bordello red and funeral black, not really my taste, kind of kitsch and it also gave off a boy's club vibe which as a female I didn't care for. Mainly business dinners going on with lots of suits and not many women at all, so right there it just had a weird atmosphere.The complimentary bread was very tasty. My date ordered the beets appetizer which was also good. Then it went downhill. My darling beau is a meat-eater and ordered the NY strip medium rare. I ordered the roast cod. Both were underwhelming. My cod lacked real flavor and was a bit overcooked, it was on a bed of polenta which was fine, just nothing special. The steak was more medium well and also lacked a grilled flavor you would expect. The morells were very tasty so that gave the meat a bit more oomph at least. The best part I think was the side order of spaetzle which I could easily have had a huge bowl of! Creamy with bacon and scallions, but I wouldn't come here just to have a side order. The worst came when I ordered a regular, standard, everyday coffee with milk. No big whoop, right? Waiter comes and pours it, then puts a small silver pitcher of milk. I pour the milk and go to drink it ----owwwww! Scalding hot and my tongue was on fire! I then look to see smoke rising from the coffee and my date notices that the silver pitcher of milk is hot too! Hot milk for hot coffee? I realize that is the way it may be done in Europe, but no warning or anything, that is not what I expect here in NYC!  I asked the waiter for a glass of ice water since I burnt my tongue on the coffee and he apologized and brought some over. The manager also came over and I asked him if it was standard to heat the milk and he said of course it was like I was some coffee neophyte. The waiter came over with a complimentary plate of Petits Fours (helllo, I just burnt my tongue! I can't taste anything! Bring some complimentary wine to forget my hot lingua!)They took off the coffee from the bill and we went on our way. Side order of spaetzle and nothing else.

1.0,8/16/2013,"A friend wanted to try Lamb's Club for Restaurant Week, and I was happy to oblige.  Upon reviewing the RW dinner menu and comparing it to the a la cart, I went with the latter.  There wasn't much I wanted to try on the RW menu, and the the dessert choices are rather unappealing and mundane.  Mushy v. mushy, (vanilla panna cotta or chocolate mousse), neither thank you.Food:  My friend had a good meal off the RW menu.  I chose a few appetizers and a desserts off of the a la cart menu - mixed feelings.My Vermont burrata was great - flavorful, light (for a cheese), and presented well.  The roasted artichoke I ordered was a disaster.  I the dip on the side was essentially a spiced mayonnaise, and the artichoke it self was extremely dry, with only a little butter and no other flavor.  I felt like I was chewing at plastic and swallowing sharp fibers.  The artichoke way the was roasted was between crispy and soft, which meant it was inedible.  I left all but a few petals as I found them on the plate. The apple crisp dessert I ordered was a little overly sweet, but edible.  I definitely needed the dessert portion since the artichoke was a nonstarter.Service:  Be warned, you may fall asleep at the table because this restaurant will keep you there much later than you would expect.Our waiter took quite a few minutes to get to our table, despite the restaurant being mostly happy hour goers when we arrived.  We were able to browse the wine/cocktail menu while waiting, but when he arrived, he only ask which type of water we wanted and did not take our drink order.  It was another long wait until he came back for drink orders at which was also when we were ready to order food.  However, he scurried off to put in the drinks before we ordered food.More than 45 minutes passes until he took our food order.  It took another 10 minutes for bread to arrive, which we were surprised to receive because we had waiting so long.Our table of 6 people finished two trays of bread while waiting 30 minutes for our appetizers to come out.  The entrees took another 30-45 minutes after that.The desserts were fortunately ordered and brought out relatively quickly (15 minute wait for all cold desserts).As we wrapped up our meal, we split the meal between credit cards and cash.  We never received any change for the cash, and I'm surprised the waiter thought he should have received a 25% tip.  At that point, we decided to let them take the $15 change and ran out of the restaurant.  All in all, we were at the restaurant for over 3 hours for no good reason.  Never again!",3,0,0,Amy T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0
3.0,8/9/2013,"Baaaaaaah humbug. The first thing I realized about this place is that it has an identity crisis of sorts. While it's called ""The Lambs Club"", this restaurant has no relation to ""The Lambs"" Club, the famous club for those in the 'the-ay-ter' that boasted such members as Cecil B. Demille, Lionel and John Barrymore, Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Rodgers and Hammerstein, and Fred Astaire, among many others.. The only relation, really, is that for the better part of the 20th century, the building this restaurant was in was home to that club. The building has since been completely renovated and turned into a hotel, and this restaurant took on the famous name. Through what I'm guessing was a legal settlement of some kind, disclaimers around the restaurant and Web site make sure you know that there's no connection between the old Club and the restaurant. Still, as a fan of old Hollywood and old Broadway, I definitely anticipated being in the same space where the greatest actors of the last century congregated. Plus, I've made a point that I want to try out restaurants of all the Iron Chefs. I've been to Morimoto (amazing), and Mesa Grill (good), and while I'm mortgaging the house to prepare for a trip to Del Posto, I figured I'd give Geoffrey Zakarian's joint a try. Sadly, I wasn't very impressed. Since it was Restaurant Week, we sat upstairs in the mezzanine where it was very loud and very crowded. I could hardly walk without bumping into a waiter or a patron. A random selection of modern and oldies rock music was playing so loud I could hardly hear my wife from across the table. I should say the waiter was very, very nice to us, but I also have to say that I noticed quite quickly that he seemed to be suffering from a pretty bad case of halitosis. So much so that my wife from across the table could smell his breath as well. I don't want to be mean, but on the other hand, it's something I really didn't expect at a supposedly upper scale restaurant, and it didn't do wonders for my appetite. Our entrees were like a Tale of Two Cities--it was the best of entrees, and it was the worst of entrees. My wife had the hangar steak, while I had the Long Island Duck. Both were cooked to near perfection--the steak was the perfect consistency with a wonderful slightly crisp char on the edge, while the duck leg was infused with amazing flavor and had an amazingly crisp skin on it.  Unfortunately, the sauce that came with the steak didn't do the steak any favors--it was a strange flavor that was slightly sweet and didn't complement the steak at all. Similarly, the sauce that came with the duck was actually congealed by the time it got out to me, so much so that I could peel a thin layer of it off my plate. And it was so salty I wondered if someone accidentally spilled a whole salt shaker onto my plate. As others have said, the service was a bit too slow for my taste, and the portions were a little small. I'm someone who likes to use Restaurant Week to try out places I'd like to go again over the year. But while some parts of this meal were spectacular, there was just too much about the overall experience that turned me off.

Between the smooth texture of the scallops, buttery nature of the grilled polenta, tzaziki-like sauce, tomato relish, and little balled up/ strips of veggies, every point of my pallet was tantalized. Some of the service. The bartenders, hostesses and sommelier were all wonderful.Atmosphere. Hip, art deco vibe, although a bit uncomfortable. Fun music.Lows:Food quantity.

We were very excited, especially with the delicious bread. I ordered an iced tea that came with cubes made of iced tea so it would not get watered down. Then it went downhill from there. We waited over and hour for our appetizer! The waiter kept saying that the appetizer would be coming out soon, but never did. He rarely checked in with us and no one would refill our water glasses until we asked them repeatedly.  I'm also curious if there was only one waiter for the evening?? The manager approached us after it started to be over an hour for an appetizer - explaining that he was sorry and we would be getting a free meal from this. The explanation we got for the poor timing of our food was that the ticket may have gotten lost and it happens to 1 in 5000 customers.  Interesting statistics.  The salmon tartare was delicious but it was hard to enjoy after having waited so long.  We waited another half hour after our entree.  At this point  we were ready to leave.  The main dish was not great. I got the duck leg - which was overcooked and my boyfriend got the hanger steak, which he did not enjoy. As another person commented on yelp, the chocolate mousse dessert was lackluster.  I wouldn't mind the taste except for the ridiculous pricing for it.  They forgot to bring out the side of asparagus we asked for, so we let it go since it would have taken too long.I would not suggest this restaurant to anyone. I saw many others waiting more than a half hour for their check!

I have to start with the bad because if you read nothing else of this review, at least you will go prepared...The service was the greatest downfall of this restaurant. You better go with a dining companion you really like because you will be here a while! They were entirely inexperienced and disordered, had no knowledge of the wines they were serving from the tasting menu (you would think they at the very least tried the wines, right?) and at multiple points, not one member of the staff could be found on the dining room floor. I expect MUCH more from a restaurant of this caliber. Especially given the prices they charge. This is a sticking point that might make me not want to go back. Our waiter was nice, but didnt know how to actually wait on tables. At least the order came out right. Oh, the little things...Now, the good...Geoffrey Zakarian's genius came through once again in the food. APPS: King Salmon Tartar: Fresh fish, nice slightly acidic sauce that was just creamy enough to make it feel decident Burrata: The olive oil they chose to finish the dish was delicious.A tad bit on the small side, but maybe that is because the cheese was stellar and I wanted more! The stainless pot vessel they chose for the burrata was odd which made it hard to eat. The pine nuts were unnecessary. Dinner: Hangar Steak: If you dont get this when you are there, you will regret it. This perfectly cooked piece of chargrilled happiness was abundant in spices and well balanced with the frisee and mashed potatoes. I cant say enough good things about this dish. Although, it came with sugar snap peas which I didnt even touch nor understood the point of having there. Scallops: I dont do scallops but I heard they were delicious. I enjoyed the pieces of buttery grilled polenta on the plate though. Dessert: They lost points with this. Mine must have been in the freezer for 5 days before they served it.

I would have liked some hot pastries, while all of these were room temperature, but they were still all delicious.For the mains we got the Stuffed French Toast ($15) and the Lambs Club Burger ($21), for a perfect combo to share of salty and sweet.The french toast was really really good - not too overwhelmingly sweet, with nice crispy edges.

2.0,6/20/2013,"This is a beautiful place but the service and stinginess on our visit last night were outrageous at this price point.  This was our second visit and we had a wonderfully perfect meal here in February.  Now to this time which was last night.We sat down and my wife looked at the wine list.  At this time the waiter wanted to tell us the recomendations from the menu. We told him to come back in a minute.  When he came back we gave him a drink order.  My wife wanted Chardonnay and the ones by the glass were $26 and $38.  She chose the lesser price and when it arrive the pour was very stingy.  Obviously we interrupted our waiter by ordering drinks because he came to take our order he wanted to skip the aforementioned recomendations which we had to ask him to tell us about.  We ordered and he did not inform us that we needed to order sides.  The problem with this was that a $60+ piece of Dover sole came with nothing else at all on the plate.  Not a thing.  My wife asked for the sauce on the side which was brought but there was still sauce on the fish.  The food was tasty and the pacing was fine (we were going to a show) but the waiter was out to lunch and they skinned us on every item as far as getting anything for the money was concerned.  At the end of a $250 dinner for two we had coffee and tea.  I asked if my wife could get a piece of biscotti with her tea and the waiter offered me the petite fours which were $10 on the desert menu.  So we felt cheated and realized that the only time the waiter asked if we needed something was when my wife's wine glass was empty.  Her response to whether she wanted another $26 glass of wine was ""you wish"" which the waiter didn't hear.  The final straw was dessert or the lack thereof. We were handed dessert menus and took a look. The waiter came back and offered us tea or coffee which we ordered and instead of asking us what we wanted for dessert he picked up the menus and walked away.

4.0,6/9/2013,"For New Years' Eve, I had the opportunity to head down to New York City and experience the city for the first time. Now, the trip was relatively short and with that, the opportunity to make a serious dent into my NY culinary wish list pretty slight. We had to pick and choose a few selected spots to try while there. The big dinner of the trip took place at the Lambs Club, located just off Times Square at Broadway and 44th street in the Chatwal hotel. The draw for me to the Lambs Club was that it is run by Geofrrey Zakarian. If you watch any amount of the Food Network, Zakarian is a chef you have seen. He is one of the more recent Iron Chef winners and a chef whose style of cuisine really appealed to me. It is described as modern American and I think that it the right way to characterize it. This was definitely a meal I was looking forward to.The restaurant is, according to the website, a 90 seat space but honestly it feels a lot smaller than that. The room has an amazing Art Deco look with red banquets, dark panel walls, beautiful standing lamps and a fireplace with black and white head shots of famous people from the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s all around the room. Add to that amazing jazz and crooner music as well as some low lights and it makes for a nice sophisticated and intimate experience. And I haven't even talked about the food yet.The dinner service is a fixed price 3 course meal with options of additional sides for a price. Prior to your selection, you receive a small amuse-gueule - a marinated cherry tomato. Nice and sweet, a good way to start the meal. Add to that my drink of choice for the evening - a gold rush cocktail (12 yr old bourbon, honey syrup and lemon juice) and we have a good beginning.As a starter, I selected the Spanish Octopus a la Plancha with squid ink pain perdu, spiced short rib and black garlic. The octopus was perfectly prepared with none of the chewiness that you fear to get. The short rib was nice and flavorful and the pain perdu was quite good - the squid ink didn't overpower the rest of the dish which can be a concern. As a main, I went with the Long Island Duck Breast with turnips, figs, huckleberries and coffee molé. Don't the chance too enough to eat some duck so I jumped on the opportunity. The duck breast was perfect - the crispy exterior without the meat being dried out. The figs and huckleberries added a nice sweetness to the dish. Very well done.For dessert, the Chestnut Opera cake grabbed my eye. Nice, sweet and light cake to finish off the meal. The candied chestnuts provided a nice spiced element to the dish.The Lambs Club was a great experience and a wonderful to start my time in New York. The entire experience, from the food to the decor to the wait staff, was top notch and worthy of your consideration next time you visit NY. It may cost you a good penny but will be worth your while.Cheers!",1,0,0,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",76,165,0

We ordered several appetizers to share: arancini (delicious), shishito peppers (they were good and sometimes spicy, but they came out kind of cold), roasted nuts (delicious and well flavored with herbs), french fries (nice and crispy), artichokes (mediocre- not very meaty- would not recommend).Overall, it was a great space to have drinks with co-workers and I would definitely come back.  My only caveat would be that the menu there is pretty pricey- so not the place to go to if you're not willing to spend $16-18 on a cocktail!",0,0,0,Jina M.,"Manhattan, NY",13,25,0

2.0,2/5/2013,"I was thoroughly disappointed with the service and wait staff! I went for RW last night for my birthday. I chose the Lambs Club because of Geoffrey Zakarian's Iron Chef reputation which was sadly portrayed. The service was extremely slow and the waitstaff was no knowledgeable with the menu.  I explained that I have a gluten allergy and cannot have any gluten in my food, which is pretty common these days. The server kept saying ""I think"" when I would ask if the dish was gluten free so I politely asked him to check with the chef because I could get sick. He did and I ordered and all was great. I asked for a different dessert since both options were cake, and again, it's my birthday...I wanted a dessert! After waiting over 15 minutes after finishing my meal to get dessert, an ice cold bowl of ice cream arrived with a pastry crisp stuck in one of the scoops. I looked at it and asked if it had gluten and the server mumbled and stammered just to respond and said ""It may have a little gluten. I'm not sure, but that's ok, right?""  Are you kidding me???? I previously explained I was allergic to gluten and couldn't have it. How on earth would that be okay? I didn't want to wait another 15 minutes for a replacement so I ate the scoop of ice cream that was not near the crisp. Needless to say, I very disappointed and would not recommended this to anyone else.

2.0,1/27/2013,"I was truly disappointed in The Lambs Club. Here's a rundown of what I had, and my thoughts on all components of the meal. Let it be noted I went to the restaurant during Restaurant Week (RW). Also, keep in mind the restaurant wasn't very busy. I'm not sure if food, and service is downgraded during RW.BreadIt was a delicious salty and super-soft sesame bread. Our party of four enjoyed every last bit of bread, then much to our surprise another loaf was delivered. We ate this one cautiously, and left a piece behind. When the third mini loaf arrived we left it untouched. They were trying to fill us up on bread!WineWe ordered the wine pairings. Each glass was poured stingily. I took tiny sips to make it last. I will say the desert wine they poured was delicious.HamachiThe crudo of hamachi with jalapeno lacked the promised kick of pepper. However, it was extremely clean in taste.Short RibI've had a better, and less expensive short rib at Brother Jimmy's of all places. The Lambs Club's short rib was a wolf in sheep's clothing; it looked moist on the outside thanks to a lovely glaze but it was terribly dry. I had to drink a lot of water to make it go down. I ate it because I paid for it, and didn't dare complain lest something happen to my food in the kitchen.Chocolate MousseWhile it was tasty it reminded me of something I made for myself as a child. Lackluster.ServiceWhile the people who delivered our food, and removed our dishes were pleasant and fast ... our waiter was a jerk. He acted as if he was too good to serve us, and always had a smarmy look on his face. He checked on us once during the entire meal. We had to wait 45 minutes and asked three people before we got our check. We still left an 18% tip.

However, only two people in our party got their coats checked without having to ask around. Then, we had to ask 3 times to get the waiter to come over and take our drink order. Everyone in our party got the wine pairing with our meal, but the waiter only explained what our dessert wine was. Also, they brought us dessert before our appetizers came (clearly intended for another table), but our waiter never apologized for the mistake. The most disappointing thing though was after waiting a long time between our appetizer and main course, my duck came out lukewarm at best. The Hamachi appetizer was great. Dessert was unmemorable.

4.0,1/23/2013,"RW Review:  In which they execute a RW menu well:  That is, I want to and will return.Our RW reservation began pleasantly enough with a drink downstairs at the lobby bar.  Unable to finish my glass before the clock struck ""time to eat"", the lovely bartender places our wineglasses on a tray and followed us upstairs to the Bar Room (where RW was being served).  Check in at the hostess stand, coats whisked away.  Led past the art deco bar and the trio of jazzing singing angels to our table for two.  All is decked out in red and art deco and leather.  Is that even a description? Drink wine.  Chat with waiter.  Drink water.  Peruse menu.  Good job on the menu, RW.  I felt like I was offered a taste of what the restaurant normally serves, with slightly less luscious touches.  I went with the hamachi crudo, my companion had the vermont burrata to start.  OK, it should be important to note here that ""boquerones"" = chopped pieces of sardine.  My faulty spanish had me thinking bocadillas.  Oh well.  Both were excellent--mine purposefully with fish, hers purposefully picked out.  The other option was a salad, and it looked hearty.Main courses were the short ribs for both of us.  The cod looked pretty good, but I can't resist a short rib on a cold blustery night.  Here folks, is the kicker.  I was eating a RW meal that I didn't finish--not because it wasn't good, but because I was getting full and I couldn't wait to get my mouth around my nommy dessert.  Also on offer was a duck leg terrine for entree.  We ordered a side of fries, since I assumed I would be hungrier and would want fries for dessert.  They were also quite delish--crunchy salty goodness.Dessert for me was a honey pistachio cake like substance topped with greek yogurt ice cream.  It was amazing.  The tangy ice cream (which tasted like philadelphia style ""plain"" ice cream) melted into the sweet pistachio honey cake.  You did not feel like there was a perfunctory serving of sweet here.  This was GOOD.  The port from the wine pairing was the perfect end.  We also had the wine pairing ($25) and the pours were very generous, although that might have had something to do with someone flirting with the waiter a wee bit.  He was so cute and nice, we couldn't help but have some fun with him.  We also had the regular menu at our table, which I totally forgot to look at because I was so excited by the RW menu.  So, yes, this place is normally kinda spendy but I'm looking forward to returning on my expense account.",3,1,1,Kelly T.,"Minneapolis, MN",325,809,9

2.0,1/20/2013,"I  wanted to write about my recent Restaurant Week dinner at the Lambs Club Bar Room.  I had a friend who always wanted to go to The Lambs Club as they are a tv fan of Geoffrey Zakarian.  I have never been interested in going but saw they were participating in RW so decided to make us reservations. I have been to my fair share of RW lunches and dinners over the years and have also been to most of the top restaurants in the city (Per Se, Jean Georges, Le Bernardin, etc).  In all my years of dining out I never had this happen I felt like a second class citizen.  I'm not sure if it was because they just didn't want to be bothered with RW or if it was pink hair and tattoos (but this is NY and it has never been an issue).  I'd love your input.I returned the reservationist's call to confirm dinner at which time they asked if I would be participating in RW.  I said most likely  but was not sure.  I figured my friend would as I was treating and they did not want to take advantage.  I was not sure if I would since I usually can't have a dessert since I am intolerant to dairy which is in many desserts and their RW menu was not online so I did not know if I would like the options.When we arrived at the hostess desk and gave my name they did not ask to take our coats or show us a coat rack, they did not seat us, they as again if we would be participating in RW.  I say again possibly depending on the menu.  They immediately handed me the RW menu as we stood there at the desk waiting for me to choose....seriously? It was so strange and I felt totally pressured.  I asked her do I have to decide now, she says yes.  I say why is there different seating for those participating in RW. She says yes (we are already in the Bar Room not their dining room).  I asked to just be seated in the RW section and be given a regualr menu as well.Looking over the menus I decide to go with the RW menu and just skip the dessert I ordered the crudo and the shortribs with port cabbage, my friend had the salad, cod and pistachio cake.  I told the waiter I cannot have dairy and to please check with the chef that the shortribs would be ok.  I say I would also do the cod if there was dairy in the shortribs (which I did not think there would be) and that they could exclude any sauce or garnish and I would just take just the protein. The waiter comes back and says that my only option is the duck.  I do not like duck (and was pretty surprised that the chef could not cook a piece of cod or shortribs without dairy) .  I as for the regular menu back, I briefly look at it and just ask the waiter to ask the chef  what entree would be able to be prepared without dairy (I did not want to keep going back and forth and other than duck or lamb I would have eaten any of the entrees).  The waiter returns says the chef will make the shortribs...now I'm worried first you couldn't now you can.  What will I be eating?The food was fine except my friend's salad had pieces of lettuce so big they had to be cut to be eaten.  I also thought I had walked into a person using the toilet when I went to the rest room.  I opened up the door and saw someone squatting down, I let out a little surprised sound and started to apologize as she said no come in.  I realized it was just the bathroom attendant.  She sat squat against the wall the whole time talking on the phone.  They won't take your coat but will have a ladies room attendant (who did not move from her place).Just don't do Restaurant Week if you are going to treat you patrons as second class guests.",0,0,0,Natalie K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

4.0,12/14/2012,"Of the multitude of NY restaurants for my one dinner in the city in 2012 (and maybe last if the Mayan calendar ends the world) I picked the oddly named Lambs Club. I was drawn here because of its location near Grand Central Station, its bar menu (I was eating alone), the chef went to college to study economics (just like me), and, I hate to say this, the publicity caused by Mr. Zakarian being an Iron Chef (gasp!!!).I sat at one of the many bar tables with the sounds of the live jazz trio which filled the room. The bar is upstairs while the regular dining room is on the first floor. The bar has a separate hostess stand from the dining room.The limited selection of wines by the glass at the bar immediately drove me to the high-priced cocktail list. I had the St. Jacques which was described as ""bourbon, cognac, chartreuse, fernet, lemon"". It forgot to mention that there was also egg white and cinnamon which made the drink full and lush. The incomplete descriptions would be a trend with the menus.Because my home state of California banned foie gras, I feel the need to order it whenever possible. It's like Bill Cosby's joke when you tell a child not to play with matches, the first thing the kid does is play with matches. But unlike a child who gets burned, the foie terrine was an incredible dish. It was loaded with side ingredients like granola, apricot fruit peel, diced celery, persimmon-olive puree, and walnut bread. Regardless of the combination of items in each forkful, the flavors played perfectly with each other with bites that could be salty, refreshing, fatty, or bitter.The sautéed scallop and compressed pork belly entrée was another multi-component dish, but not nearly as successful. It tasted fine, but didn't have the dynamic playfulness of the foie. The execution was also a touch off. The scallops were cooked to different doneness. The pork belly wasn't as tender as most along with soggy and mushy skin instead of the classic crispy skin. The guanciale and potato ""ravioli"" didn't taste like pork cheek and the ""ravioli"" was an odd and completely incidental ""skin"" placed over the potatoes. If the scallop and pork wasn't enough, deep fried smelt was also added to the dish (another ingredient not mentioned on the menu). I'm not sure why they were needed and seemed like a plating mistake.The bill came with suggested 18% or 20% tips. This is not a complaint because they were based on the pre-tax amount. I don't know if this is a normal practice in NY, but in Los Angeles the suggested tip is based on the amount that includes tax. And when sales tax is 8.75% in LA, that's padding the tip by a couple more bucks. By the way, I tipped 22% because the service was exceptional.",2,1,2,Brian U.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1798,109
2.0,12/10/2012,"The food alone is 4/5 stars. Unfortunately our waiter made our experience 1/2 stars.  Upon our arrival we checked our coats and decided to head to the upstairs bar for pre-dinner cocktails... The drink were amazing, the lamb cups was delicious it had bits of watermelon in it, the moscow mule used fresh ginger. After drinks we headed downstairs for dinner....  We were seated at a red booth, this was not the most comfortable as the table was oversized and I did not have a place to put my feet.  Everytime i left the table had to be moved so i could get out. However the decor and ambiance was delightful. The bad started: I had order a bottle of wine from the waitor upon our seating..... 45 minutes and appetizers later, we decided to cancel the bottle of wine, there was only 2 of us and we did not want to smash thru the bottle when it came. I also asked the waiter a question about the menu and he did not know the answer and never answered it. After about 30 minutes between courses ( a long gap) and waiting to be acknowledged by our waiter, we needed the check ... after all it was Saturday night and we had additional plans.. The waiter never came after 50 minutes of waiting we decided to ask the hostess for the check..... Due to the service I cannot recommend this restaurant. The worst service of my life... Wish i had my wine to enjoy my dinner. The wait was unacceptable.Food:Amazing... We ordered the tuna tartare and steak tartare for the appetizers. The steak tartare came with country bread, it was extremely flavorful and probably the best steak tartare I ever ate. For entrees we had the sea scallop with pork belly and the Duck. The Sea Scallops were cooked perfectly, 3 large scallops and 2 pieces of delicious melt in your mouth pork belly.  The duck had a coffee and chocolate mole sauce with grilled figs and juniper berries... Medium rare and delicious, although I wish the skin was a little crispier. Dessert: The chocolate souffle is the way to go, it was almost like a lava cake and came with a vanilla and  chocolate chip ice cream it was also paired with sour cherries to cut the sweetness. The Pistashio cake was also very good, the cake was dense but was paired nicely with a tart greek yogurt sorbet. Would have been 5 stars if our experience was not ruined by the waiter",0,0,0,Danielle B.,"Garnet Valley, PA",20,164,22
4.0,12/5/2012,"So we ended up going here because of Chef Geoffrey Zakarian, having watched a lot of Food Network over the Thanksgiving break. After all, watching the food network just makes me wish I were eating the food shown on-screen, and an Iron Chef's restaurant gives you that opportunity! What's not to like?On a whim and with a birthday coming up, we got reservations for two people two days before the actual visit without any trouble. You can make reservations really easily online, which is a big plus for me, as I don't like talking on the phone.The staff was very professional- there's a coat check at the entrance, and the person managing the 'front desk' (or whatever you call the podium you first go to in a restaurant) was super friendly- we chatted on the way out. It seemed like a waiter was stopping by our table nearly every minute to refill water, take away a plate, give us another course- they were unobtrusive but we felt very taken care of. The waiters taking our orders and giving us menus were friendly and very helpful if you wanted to hear more about something.We each got a cocktail. The Lamb's Cup is DELICIOUS. The Gold Rush was also yummy, but there's so much going on in the Lamb's Cup that it's more impressive- there's ginger and deliciousness and it will disappear very quickly.Food breakdown:The menu is prix-fixe, so you're getting one appetizer, one meal, and one dessert. Choosing is terribly hard!-The day we went, there was a 'gift from the chef' that was a shot of mousse that tasted a bit like clam chowder, with mushrooms and apples and whatnot. A great way to start the meal! There was also some very soft bread with some butter that was just the right consistency for spreading. The waiter offered us a second basket but it was hard enough to eat everything else already.-The Spanish Octopus was really good. I've never had octopus that wasn't really chewy and hard to eat before, but this was tender and very interesting.-Oysters on a half-shell were pretty much what you'd expect- delicious with an interesting sauce to put on top, but I feel like it'd be pretty hard to mess those up. Still, delicious, and a waiter materialized to give me a towel to wipe my hands with the second I touched the lemon.-The Duet of Colorado Lamb was the best-cooked lamb I've ever had. I'm not a lamb person, but my boyfriend loved it, and the duo is one tender, tougher bit and one super soft part, and the sauce is amazing.-The sea scallops were delicious. (I do love me some scallops, though.) I saw someone on here complaining that you only get three, but scallops are pretty heavy, in my opinion, (especially after three other items) and they came with two blocks of pork belly that absolutely melted in your mouth. -Dessert is small, but we were pretty thankful for that because we were so stuffed. Each of ours came with some ice cream that seemed much fresher than something most restaurants would just scoop on top of whatever they were serving.-The chocolate souffle is delicious. If you are at all a fan of flourless cakes or that sort of thing, GET IT.-I had the opera cake, which doesn't have very strong flavors but is full of interesting subtle stuff (there's a note of ginger in the cake! And the ice cream goes with it really well!)You can dress fancy, but I saw some people in jeans and a nice top there as well, and it's a bit dark, so no-one seemed out of place. Most of the people there were businessmen or just very stylish, though. Chef Zakarian showed up at the table next to ours for a bit, so that was a fun sighting. Overall, it's a bit too pricey/far from Brooklyn to be in a rush to go back, but it was a great experience, and I'd bring people from out of town there, or go back to try out the bar.",1,0,0,Michelle B.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,20,0

3.0,9/23/2012,"Sept 2012Context: we had a group of five on a Thursday at 7pm with reservations Three of us arrived early, about 6, for drinks at the small downstairs bar. We felt particularly underdressed given the crowd but we never felt snubbed by the staff.Atmosphere: this is a formal place that has an old boys club atmosphere where you can imagine deals being made. Decor is red and black. You walk into a small bar area but there is a much larger bar upstairs that was filled with people in suits the night we were there. The dining room is black banquets arranged around a central fireplace with red accents. Waiters are in suits and there are lots of them. This place felt like one where people dress stylish.Service: we were greeted with reserve at the bar. And the assumption we knew nothing about cocktails or their components. So, the drinks were thoroughly explained to us. They have about 10 signature cocktails, the lambs cup being their specialty. They also have several beers and wines by the glass. We tried two cocktails which the bartender mixed in front of us. Service in the dining room is almost too much. It wasn't unusual to have four people at our table of five bringing plates or taking them. Waiters open the door to the bathroom for you, fill your water and wine. The only time the service disappeared was when we wanted our bill.Food/drinks: at the bar, we had the house cocktail which is muddled cucumber with gin, ginger, st Germaine and lots of soda. It's served in a tall Collins glass over ice, so it dilutes quickly. It's easy to drink and refreshing rather than heavy on the alcohol. The cucumber dominates and it's muddled so much you get little pieces as you drink. Mine was served with the stirring spoon which was cool, but another in our party didn't get that at the table so maybe that's only at the bar. The second cocktail was chartreuse, ferret branca, bourbon, egg whites and lime. This was heavy on the alcohol and served up in a martini glass. It's very well balanced and sippable. We had turnbull Cabernet Sauvignon which was a rich, fruit forward red.  I give the drinks at the bar five stars!For food it is a three course prix fixe with sides extra. Although they broughtt us three sides, compliments of the house (French fries, green beans and corn). Our starters were a peach, tomato burrata salad and corn soup. The peaches, frog hollow, were exquisitely ripe but there were maybe three cubes, tomatoes were good and the buratta was lsuh and smooth but the service was so small.  The corn soup is poured at table over freshly cut corn in the bowl. It was fine but the corn flavor was not prnounced, maybe the season had passed. Our entrees were the pacific king salmon and delmonica steak which comes with a big up-charge. The salmon is served rolled with tiny little potato balls. The salmon had almost no flavor and was a disappointment. We love pacific king salmon so we were surprised at how overlooked and bland it was. The little potato balls were tastier. The steak was huge and served with a few whole shallots. Steak was tasty with dry grainy texture and cooked medium rare as ordered. Fries were fresh cut and fine. Beans were bright green with a nice crunch.  There are only aout six entree options, so its worth checking out the menu before you go. Desserts were often not as expected. An apple tart was two very slim tuile like cookies with apple purée and cream between them, the size of a silver dollar; the lemon pound cake with sorbet was like a dried out sponge cake kind of with no lemon flavor. Sorbet was intensely fruit flavored but lacked a balancing sweetness. By far, the favorite was the chocolate souffle, which to give the waiter credit, is what he recommended.  The food was a disappointment but maybe this isn't a place you go to for the food? Maybe it's the atmosphere? Or the overwhelming service? Or the sense of million dollar meetings that seems to pervade the place?",3,0,0,Vivek V.,"San Ramon, CA",33,328,84

We ordered the caramelized mushroom and parmesan omelet, turkey club sandwich, and chicken cobb salad. The presentation of the chicken cobb salad was gorgeous.

I could only eat half because it was so big. The turkey is very juicy and flavorful - not dry at all. I forgot to ask them to leave off the sprouts, but there weren't too many of them so I didn't mind them. Bacon and avocado are always welcome additions.

Geoffrey Zakarian made it a point to come out to greet his guest and even take pictures- which I thought was an awesome touch, but then as he made his way from table to table, he completely bypasses our table.

Started with their signature lambs salad, the waiter kept raving about it. My salad was drowning in dressing which was a bit sour for me. The greens were very basic nothing interesting mixed in. The summer salad was nice but nothing outstanding!The sea scallops were cooked well but again nothing special, I have had the same scallops in many of my travels. The dover sole there was a surcharge of $18.00 which they don't tell you, it's funny but the sauce was very simple and the fish was way too salty, you would think it would be a nice balance but it really did not work.The wine pairing tasted better than the food which should have complimented each other but that did help the meal taste better.By now, I was so ready for dessert. The pistachio cake was very delicious but do not get the steam chocolate cake.Ending with a cup of coffee. That hit the spot!!The service was excellent!

4.0,7/22/2012,"One of my very best friends is an absolute sucker for Chopped. Geoffrey Zakarian is one of his absolute favorite judges, and he had a huge hankering to test out his cuisine for his birthday. I can't usually pay the tab for something so indulgent, but I couldn't resist. Our party of five arrived promptly at 7, where we were seated at this cozy circular table in the corner. The darkness of the room made it look like we were creepily dining in the shadows, but that was fine since we were eating like slobs throughout the meal. Surrounding us (along from well-dressed men in suits and their mistresses) were black-and-whites of stars from classic cinema. That slight touch really made it feel like we were dining with the stars. Our servers floated around us every now and then to magically greet us with cocktails, amuse bouches, and never-ending baskets of bread. They knew it was my friend's birthday, too, so they each made a point of it to wish him a happy birthday when they came to our table for the first time. Really stand-up service. Now, the second-to-star of the meal was the food. I got to taste a good chunk of the items on the menu, so I'll just make this simple. GOOD- Baby Octopus Puttanesca - the spicy tomato sauce perfectly complimented the charred octopus; the squash blossom pesto also gave the dish that needed sweetness that would usually be missing and missed.- Oysters on the Half Shell - sure, oysters and oysters. However, they were served with this chili ketchup that brought the typical oyster dish to another level.- Sea Scallops - first off, the three scallops they serve are HUGE. With the two fatty blocks of pork belly, it's the ideal entree size.- Delmonico Steak - seriously, the best steak I've ever had.- Broccoli Rabe - perfect complimentary side dish to anything you order, although you'll probably be full and won't need it by entree's end- the bread - despite the overabundance of it that they give you, you're going to want to eat it all. - Honey Pistachio Cake & Dark Chocolate Torte - overall exceptional desserts (unless if you're not a fan of Greek Yogurt Sorbet on top of your cakes...acquired taste)BAD- the fois gras amuse bouche & Fois Gras Parfait - maybe my distaste for strong salt flavors makes me not keen of the delicacy, but the way the gras lingered on my palette even after the last swallow was not amusing.

I was expecting terrific service and excellent food as the tradeoff, and while our meal was good and the service was decent, it  just didn't quite measure up to expectations.- Appetizer (Beef Tenderloin Tartare) was good, not great- Main course (Chesapeake Bay Soft Shell Crabs) was good, not great- Dessert (Dark Chocolate Torte) was spectacular- Wine (one glass of white, one glass of red) was extremely curious, to say the least. The wine list is very long, but it is arranged in a strange fashion that is difficult to follow (were the pages in my book out of order?). And, there's nary a bottle on the whole list that is even remotely reasonably-priced. So, not being able to find a reasonably-priced bottle, we switched to wines by the glass...but my friend struggled to find a glass of white that she liked (turning down the first two) and I was served a red (Cune, Viña Real ""Oro,"" Rioja Reserva 2005) that: a) was poured into a small glass, and b) was served quite cold! (52 degrees to be exact!) I've had fruity or less sophisticated reds that were best served slightly chilled--they need not always be at room temperature--but this was ridiculous. My glass of Rioja was actually colder than my ice water! It ruined the taste of the wine.- Service...I tried communicating with my waiter about the size of my wine glass. He didn't understand. He kept referring to the size of the pour. It was a strained, awkward conversation, with him eventually explaining that they serve single glasses of red in a small glass and use larger, more traditional red wine glasses for bottles. He never adequately addressed the temperature. For a brief moment, the sommelier passed by quickly and barked out, ""52 degrees.""

4.0,3/12/2012,"Rightfully praised and delicious? Absolutely. On the stuffy side and unapologetically pretentious? Yes, again. But I guess that's to be expected from the slick, silver-haired Manhattan giant who dons turtle-shell glasses. The interior was actually quite pleasant with a huge, inviting fireplace and red leather booths that bring you right back to old New York. As you're sitting there, you can just imagine high-power ad execs from the '60s schmoozing with clients over a lunch of scotch neat or straight-up martinis. The only unpleasant detail was the servers, of which there was an army. Dressed in either black or white suits, it was difficult to tell who was supposed to be doing what, but nevertheless, they were equally annoyed that we weren't carelessly shelling out $300+ for a bottle of wine. Believe it or not, we were there for the food and smart enough to resist the urge for $15 cocktails when the same could be found around the block for under $10. After one beer a piece, we were ready to start our feast, despite the cold glares from our waiter.Service aside, the food was spectacular. Grilled octopus and oysters to start, followed by the best pork chop I've ever had (or ordered), and concluded perfectly with a decadent chocolate pot de crème. And the biggest surprise of all....the portions! Typically at restaurants of this caliber, the entrees are meant to tease you, offering barely enough to afford a few bites, let alone share, and never enough to leave you full. That was thankfully not the case at The Lambs Club. Both the appetizers and entrees were normal -sized with enough to share and make us hesitate at the thought of dessert, which left us with no regrets when it came time for paying the bill.Read more at: nycnovice.wordpress.com",1,0,1,Kristen L.,"New York, NY",157,17,0

We opted for the ""theater"" pre-fix menu for $47 and an additional $25 for the wine pairing.  Pre-fix + fancy wines + a guy that looks kinda like Zakarian = freak-out ::Steve motioning with his hands with deer caught in head lights look::Me: What!? Is HE here?!Steve: ::nods::As we both had our major freak-out moment, our waitress Deena laughed and said she could have him come over to our table.  I couldn't even swallow my bite of my Atlantic cod if I wanted to. (don't worry; I totally finished my plate in a shameful way - I used the amazing sesame bread that came to the table and licked the plate clean)Zakarian: So, how's the food?Omg, are you kidding me?!  You made it!  YOU MADE IT!!!! Do you KNOW who YOU are?!?!  I gushed to him as to how I love him (guilty) and I might have said out loud that I would leave Steve for him (guilty too...I hope I didn't say that out loud; he'll never know).  We asked for a picture and he couldn't have been more down to earth.  At least Steve was able to say congrats to his Iron Chef victory, while I think I was quietly fighting back utter tears of joy.  What a down to earth, modest, and darn good looking man!  For SHAME this place having 3/5 stars!  BLASPHEMY!!!  If you're not a Zakarian fan, I guess you just don't get it.  Amazing food, delicious wine, romantic atmosphere, and walking distance to anything you could ever want in NYC; yeah...I'll be back; either alone or with my beau.Loving you Zakarian....loving you....",3,12,2,Jaclyn C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1216,896,1227

3.0,1/15/2012,"To celebrate my re-induction as an Elite Yelper, we decided to splurge and hit The Lamb's Club. No, not really. Actually we're in a sort of ""financial and caloric austerity moment"" (so European!) and it was really bringing us down (after only 5 days. We are weak). So we hit The Lamb's Club. It was decidedly not financially nor calorically austere. Be forewarned.Now, I don't usually review a place after just one visit, or complain about prices. But given the prices - a second visit to the restaurant is unlikely. It's a super classy room. You'll feel better if you wear your fancy pants. It's a pre fixe menu - $68 for three courses. So not toooo bad? Only you know how much you're comfortable with spending. Sides are $9 and tiny. And the food was lovely. But here's the thing: we like to drink. Before dinner, during dinner and after dinner. In The Lamb's Club, that will more than double your bill. The wine and liquor is, on average, at least 25% more than other comparable Manhattan bars, restaurant and lounges. I suppose we could drink less, but why should we have to? It's part of the experience. That said - here's the ironic part - we would go back for cocktails. I know, I know, I just railed about the prices. But that's for liquor. (and lets be honest - at $68, for me anyway, food needs to be more than lovely. It needs to curl my toes) The cocktail list is up there - but on par with its ilk, like $16-20. That, I can handle. Cause the list is gooood. So here's my advice: Are your parents rich? Take them to the restaurant. They'll be impressed that you're such a grownup. Are you looking to impress a date?

The service is impeccable, to be expected at any Zakarian eatery. I opted for the grilled octopus appetizer and was not disappointed. Cooked the perfection, this dish was both flavorful and succulent. The aged delonico steak entree was equally pleasing with wonderful marbled fat that added intense flavor. For dessert, I selected the banana bread pudding. I could taste the bourbon and I savored every spoonful.

3.0,1/5/2012,"I got my bf into Chopped and Iron Chef so when he got a nice xmas bonus he suggested coming here so we could geek out for Zakarian, even though we typically don't go for hyped-up places.  Reading all the reviews, I tried to convince myself that the majority were written by cynical, spoiled snobs (no offense) who get to eat too many fancy meals on their company dime, and that I would surely appreciate Zakarian's exquisite cuisine and come home feeling it was worth every penny.  Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.  Either I'm one of the cynical snobs, or The Lambs Club is accurately over-hyped.  Was the food good?  Definitely.  Was it $68 three course prix fixe good?  Not really.  To begin with, I was disappointed that no specials were offered as I hadn't truly had my heart set on anything on the menu.  We shared our appetizers, the grilled quail and crispy kale salad, which started the meal off optimistically as both were yummy and unique enough to seem fine dining-y.  Then we split our entrees, lamb loin and sirloin steak, which were both very good but simply not the best meals we've had, especially for the price.  I've had many, many better steaks. The best bite I had was probably the crispy little chorizo cakes that came with my lamb, and then I did enjoy having a cheese plate for dessert since, like Zakarian, I prefer savory over sweet desserts.  B said his favorite part of the meal, hands down, was his dessert: Honey Pistachio Cake w/Candied Pink Pistachios and Fromage Blanc.  I didn't taste it, but like every part of the meal, it did look beautiful. Yes, the ambiance was very nice.  We sat right next to the huge fireplace and I felt like I could look over and see Don Draper eating a steak.  Service was fine, though my glass of wine teetered on empty too many times.  It was hard to ignore what this place really is: a hotel lobby restaurant near Times Square, where even the bathroom attendants seemed so bored with the hype that they didn't even try handing me a paper towel for a tip.  All in all, I expected much more.  If the price were lower - say, $40 for the prix fixe, max - my review would probably be a lot better.  For $68, I expect a foodgasm, not just a very good meal.  If you're like me and only splurge on rare occasions, this isn't the place to do it.",2,0,1,Sherri M.,"Brooklyn, NY",214,384,148

Rather than ask us, they got a recommendation from CA friends with a pied-à-terre in Manhattan.  So you now know to whom this place caters.  The basic idea is that the old Lambs theatrical club building (Sanford White landmark) redone into a sleek hotel for the international set.  The decor is a modernist revision of art deco -- the chairs are comfy and red leather.  Think men's club or speak-easy.  The place was quiet -- only a few tables occupied -- we were there early on a Sunday night.  But even if packed, the wood paneled walls and leather will keep the noise down. As suggested by reviewers on Open Table and Yelp -- we had to ask for the prix fixe menu -- when we did the waiter looked at his watch and said that it ended at 6:30 (it was 6:35 -- he realized this was silly and brought them).  At $44 the offering is a reasonable value but like most prix fixe menus the choice were less than exciting.  I had oysters -- one of which was bad, did I mention it tasted awful -- alright I know August doesn't have an ""R"".  My chicken was great and the lemon tart looked good.

4.0,7/12/2011,"New Yorkers don't seem to think that much of the Lambs Club based on the reviews here, but as a frequent business traveler to Manhattan, I'd put the Lambs Club towards the top of my Midtown list, and snobs will have to get over the fact that it's Midtown west all the way over near Times Square.The main thing you pick up from LC is the decor, which made me expect Andy Warhol to sit down with us at any moment.  You have to check out the pics.Service was decent and friendly.The cocktail list was solid with a couple of innovative drinks -- although more refreshing than alcoholic -- my wife did enjoy them as fresh concoctions. The wine list was also solid but not notable and not too costly by NY standards.  We enjoyed four courses, taking a smaller plate approach:  salad, some sashimi kind of dish, a heavy main dish and actually dessert as well.  Frankly most of these were interesting but not memorable.We had the basic LC salad and grilled octopus:  just a salad but the octopus was flavorful with lemongrass, something I'd not tasted with octopus before.Then we had Tuna Tartare:  nothing particularly interesting but good qualityFor main dishes:  Lamb Loin and Bass.  Fish quality was good and the lamb loin was full of flavor, I'm still wondering what a piquillo pepper is, but I enjoyed the dish.",1,0,1,Rich V.,"Atlanta, GA",332,303,759

4.0,6/6/2011,"(Bar review only)Lamb's Club gives cocktail enthusiasts yet another option for historically lamentable midtown/ Times Square area. The upstairs bar is unsurprisingly beautiful: as upscale hotel cocktail bars tend to be lovely given the large budget and professional interior designers- not to mention ample space.  All expected elements are present here: a soaring ceiling, a modern feel with a nod to art deco past, a barman straight out of central casting.  Also present are the prices that feel somewhat inflated at $15- $18 per cocktail; but have become the standard for this neighborhood.That being said the drinks were here were superior to the other area cocktail bars I've visited.  The bar is not the most well- stocked bar I've seen- but they have more than the basic requirements. The menu has some interesting concoctions, although I opted for some classics.

We had a pretty insane spread in front of us and the dessert certainly didn't fall short on expectation. For taste, my favorite was the Chocolate Pot de Creme... amazing flourless cake! For visual flavor, you GOTTA order the Turtle Sundae. Not a chocolate fan? You can't miss with the sorbet. It definitely has the old school feel that they were going for.

4.0,2/25/2011,"Do you remember the opening scene of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom? The one with a Mandarin rendition of ""Anything Goes"" in a nightclub?That's what came to mind when entering the Lambs Club, a place that transports the senses back in time to the 1930's when Art Deco was modern and waitstaff wore white jackets. (And unemployment was high, the economy ailing and geopolitics were heating up. Why, deja vu all over again?)This review is strictly for drinks and small plates at the bar.After entering the Chatwal hotel, you'll climb a flight of stairs and make your way to the bar and restaurant. This is a huge historic space that makes you think King Kong will be appearing outside the window.The bar itself features some very interesting light fixtures that resemble skyscrapers. It's the kind of bar where a napkin is unfurled before drinks are presented, effective white glove service without actual white gloves.No silence of the lambs here, however. There was background music (sounded like bhangra, of all genres) but it was respectfully low that made conversation easy. The actual Lambs Club was the first professional theatrical club in America. Members included Chaplin, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Irving Berlin and more. The building was the actual home of this club so you are not only drinking but drinking in history.Cocktails are in the $15-$18 range. They are designed by Sasha Petrsake and tend towards the classics: Old Fashioned, Strawberry Gimlet, White Russian, Gold Rush to name a few.I opted for a hays fizz, complete with absinthe rinse. Alas Baudelaire's Fleur Du Mal did not flow from my pen after consumption but this was still a good drink. Snoop Dogg's Gin and Juice was more appropriate given the other ingredients.Next up was the Lambs Cup, advertised as being better than a Pimms. Those are fighting words as I'm a Pimms player myself.It's effectively a Pimms Cup...without the Pimms. And without the Pimms, it succeeds as a worthwhile cocktail but does not surpass the original Pimms Cup in my humble drinking opinion.Eating while drinking usually assists in being able to drink more. Lambs Club offers up a light bites menu from which I sampled the calamari, prosciutto and melon and warm house roasted nuts.The surprise of the night was definitely the roasted nuts. Roasted with rosemary and sea salt, the nuts included the under-represented filbert. And they were great to munch on while imbibing. A cheese plate is available, as is grilled octopus, a club salad, shrimp cocktail and more, readily explained in the menu.For those who work in midtown, this is an excellent option for a time traveling drinking experience.

The venue is extremely attractive and the lounge area looks like old theatrical glamour and the dining room is also stunning with a huge fireplace and cushy red leather chairs. The experience fell apart when I decided to have the steak, I am a steak lover and have certainly had virtually every cut of meat available. So I was a bit surprised when fully one quarter of my steak was fat. I piled it up in the corner of my plate and mentioned it to our waitress. She then told the manager who came over promptly and it seemed to me he was very rude. Instead of saying he was sorry and would i prefer something else, he implied I lacked knowledge about meat preparation and how this cut always had this much fat. I disagreed and he left. I was not asking for any money to be taken off the bill but rather to let them know. The service other than that was excellent and our waitress was very fully informed on the menu but the attitude from the manager soured our experience.For fifty dollars for a steak I expected better quality.Wines by the glass were generously poured. the roasted cauliflower was very salty as well.The venue deserves better and more exciting food.",0,0,0,Kay W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,4

3.0,12/26/2010,"Ate here on Christmas Eve. Restaurant is very elegant and the vibe reminds me of what it probably felt like in the roaring 20s in Hollywood. The wood burning fireplace in the restaurant creates an intimate atmosphere. The seating (leather banquets) are comfortable and if you are lucky enough to have a corner table, it is an impressive sized space. The bar area in the front is also very cool and a good spot to spend 10-15 mins before the meal.The menu is a combination of fish and meat. I went for the White Gazpacho and the Bass. The soup was obviously served cold and the portion was on the skimpy side. They poured the soup into a bowl that could have held about 10x the portion that was actually served. This exaggerated the small portion. The bass was very tasty and the portion fair in size. For a $30+ piece of fish it was a decent portion.I enjoyed the meal but was disappointed in the personality of the staff. The waiter(s) were not warm at all and it made for some uncomfortable interactions. I can't attest to the personality of the staff on a non-holiday night, but on this night, it was rather unfriendly.

1.0,10/30/2010,"Before the rest of the review -- why one star?  Because this restaurant does the worst thing a crushingly expensive restaurant can do: be visibly, willfully, and utterly unapologetically cheap about something.After a convivial dinner with a big party of people, with hosts who were generous with the wine list, shellfish platters, etc., came the dessert.  I ordered the cheese plate.  It was (literally) two tiny slivers of nothing-special cheese accompanied by a dab (like, half a teaspoon) of marmelade, on a fairly large dinner plate.  This was maybe 25 cents of food cost, for which I am sure my hosts were charged $15 dollars.  (All the other desserts enjoyed by my fellow diners were perfectly substantial.)  Funny enough, this cheese ""plate"" was accompanied by six toast points -- four more (at least) than the two slivers of cheese would require.  I asked the waiter if perhaps the toast point count was correct while the cheese-slice count was not.  What he was supposed to do was say ""oh, must have been a mistake"" and come back with a reasonable portion.  If he somehow lacked that authority he was supposed to chat of the manager who would have made it right.  What did happen, instead, was the server took a frosty look at me and asked if I would like him to take away the excess toast points, and then turned his back and walked away.  (Arrogance he came upon because of a fixed gratuity for the party, since that's conduct that would have deserved a penalty if the tip was discretionary.)If the kitchen and servers feel that they can treat a big business-dinner party like this, I shudder to imagine how they roll when they it's a family of European tourists dining apres-theater, or a pair of 20-somethings dining out on a Restaurant Week menu.",8,2,2,Matthew D.,"Scarsdale, NY",4,339,0

3.0,9/14/2010,"A few weeks ago, I went on vacation and I left my cat, Moxie, with my friend Mala. To thank her, I promised her dinner. With the opening of The Lambs Club inside the Theater District's Chatwal Hotel, I seized a great opportunity to attend the inaugural weekend with Mala. Originally designed by Stanford White in 1905, The Chatwal is a ritzy venue to stage the debut of Geoffrey Zakarian (Town, Country) and David Rabin's (Double Seven, Los Dados) new posh art-deco eatery. The Lambs website states that the ""history of The Lambs Club extends back to early 19th Century England when a group of lively folk of the theatre and arts frequently visited their friends, Charles and Mary Lamb. In the spring of 1869, a men's theatrical and dining club was formed in London and named in their honor. Christmas week of 1874 a companion club was formed here in New York by one of the London Lambs, Henry Montague: That first meeting was at the original Delmonico's Blue Room on 14th Street. Portraits of this popular, handsome matinee idol hang in the Clubhouse."" The Lambs were incorporated in 1877 and began a tradition which continues today in its current location on 51st Street. The restaurant, a bi-level gem, not officially connected with The Lambs, is highlighted by French designer, Thierry Despont's, glamorous red leather banquettes, torchiere lighting, and a grand limestone fireplace that will be a guaranteed hit during the winter months. Adjacent the entrance to the restaurant is a small classy bar that serves its own customers as well filling the restaurant drink orders. A larger, plush lounge is located upstairs. The cocktail menu was designed by none other than mixologist extraordinaire Sasha Petraske (Milk & Honey, Little Branch). His retro-classic cocktail menu features libations from a bygone era but not bygone prices. Each drink goes for $18 a pop. That was beyond my limit, on principle. So, I opted to wait until we sat down for dinner and then sampled the luscious and sweet Hungarian Oremus Tokaj..but also at $18. A table for two can nearly spend $100 on drinks before one bite of food is eaten in this joint. Mala and I ordered a large bottle of Hildon Still Water ($8). When we finished our glasses, they accidentally refilled them with tap water..tisk tisk. After viewing the menu, Mala didn't want me to spend too much on her, therefore, she just ordered an entree and a side. I was aware that Executive Sous Chef Joel Dennis (Adour Alain Ducasse) was running the kitchen. When I saw that Veal Sweetbreads were on the menu, I knew they would be prepared in the classic French technique...and I was right. They were completely scrumptious, cooked to perfection in a Peppered Veal Jus with Grilled Treviso ($19). For our entrees, Mala ordered the Loup De Mar (European Sea Bass) with Lemon Sauce and Roasted Baby Artichokes ($26) and I selected the Wild Striped Bass with Fennel, Lemon, Olives and Tomato ($29). We each tasted each other's dish and then smiled at each other sheepishly. The plates were prepared well, but there was nothing exciting about them. The adequate execution was about as good as I've had at weddings in a reputable banquet hall or on a cruise ship. Also, someone on the wait staff needs to learn the difference between a fish knife and a butter knife. The side dishes, as well, were a bit pedestrian. Slightly overcooked and dried out Fingerling Potatoes ($8) were not aided by limp chanterelles. My weakly presented and slightly bland Tomato Zucchini Gratin with Roasted Thyme ($8) faired little better than its disappointing accomplice. By the time we finished our main courses, the room had filled up with a lively mix of young and mostly well-dressed groups and older couples dining alone in seemingly apparent stoicism. Later, I did have the lovely pleasure of meeting the charming Gail Simmons (Food & Wine, Bravo's TOP CHEF) who was dining with her husband and friends. On the whole, the service was mostly competent, amiable and prompt and any small lapses I'm sure will be remedied as time goes on. Chef Zakarian has hired Executive Pastry Chef Elishia Richards (Esca) to concoct the desserts ($10). My Deep Dish Lemon Tart with Lemon Confit, Light Meringue and Chamomile Broth was really no better than one can find at a good Upper West Side cafe at less than half the price. But, we were stunned into silent stillness by the silky smooth Bittersweet Chocolate Pot De Crème with Brachetto Sabayon. It was absolutely divine as we scraped the bottom of the cup. One star for the satisfactory cuisine, another for the swanky decor and polite service, one more for the rapturous Pot De Crème dessert. Dinner for two with wine, extra sides and tip was $185.",4,0,3,The Jedi Foodi E.,"New York, NY",333,107,515
4.0,9/9/2010,"I just paid a fortune for dinner, but then I would not spend a fortune for anything else. This place felt like an old school Hollywood club meet Citizen Kane's mansion....art decoed out with a gigantic fireplace that warmed up the dark walls and red leather seats. I was greeted by a doorman and walked straight into a crowded bar, but the hostess kindly guided me upstairs to reveal another bar that had more seating for me to wait for my party to arrive. So might I say 18$ for a cocktail was quite a bold gesture! The Lamb's cup, similar to a Pimm's cup was quite tasty....but I still am having trouble justifying the price!As an appetizer we ordered oysters, which was served up on a steel platter filled with ice and seaweed. with 3 different sauces. I liked all of them! :) The bread was AMAZING, warm, crispy on the outside, puffy and tender on the inside, a nutty flavor with the sesame seeds and poppy seeds that were spread throughout! I could eat this and die happy! A plate of vegetable crudite with an unusual assortment of cauliflower, scallions, and radishes were immaculately placed around a little dipping sauce, which didn't overpower the vegetables! As a first course, I chose the Foie Gras...this was a terrine served cold with a side of fig fig jam and fresh figs...very good, but I do love warm seared ones much better. The bread was toasted and served table side in a well thought manner. My entree was the Loup de Mer. A white fish served with artichokes....I paired this dish with a Sauvignon Blanc from the lovely Kiwis Down Under. It was delish! A nice crispy skin and when eaten with the artichoke hearts with the citrus sauce underneath, there was some sort of dance on my palate. I had the pleasure of trying the seared sea scallops with was cooked to PERFECTION! I was a little held back by the foamy garnish but this time it actually worked! Oh and the porcini mushrooms did a wonderful deed to compliment the scallops so well! YUM!

The food was really what showcased the talent.  The two of us shared the raw scallop with uni and olives, beef tartare to start.  The beef tartare was definitely amazing.  The country bread it comes with is a great compliment.  The little salad with the pickled mushrooms was also tasty.  The scallop dish was nicely presented, but a little over powered by the olives.  Then the for our main courses we split the lobster roll and the heirloom tomato salad.  Both of these dishes were spectacular.  The heirloom salad was a great interpretation of a Greek Salad.  The salad had a litter of tomatoes, some burrata but also feta, olives and cucumbers as well as pickled onions.  All this played well together in a school yard sense.  Then the star of the show, the lobster roll.  Butter poached lobster is not the norm for a lobster roll, but this warm lobster roll served on a toasted buttery roll with a little mayo and a side salad was to die for.  The lobster itself was so delicious it didn't even need the roll.  I kinda wanted to go swimming with the lobster in the butter poaching liquid.  It was that good.  Dessert was very refreshing.  The chocolate pudding was just okay.  But if you get a chance to try the granita with lime and watermelon mint and vodka, you won't be disappointed, especially since they don't plan on keeping this on the menu past the season.  Damn, I wish it could be summer all year long just for this refreshing dessert.  Service will work out any hiccups, like bringing out the entrees while we are still working on our first course.  But ultimately, we had a very pleasant server.  She was a little timid, but ultimately really nice.  Looking forward to trying other meals here at the Lambs Club.  This is a great upscale choice for lunch while in the area of Times Square.",4,2,3,Caesar R.,"Somerville, MA",915,946,20
