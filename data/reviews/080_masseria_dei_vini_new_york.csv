5.0,4/20/2019,"Good service, the food was very nice. Prices were not too bad. The champagne was tasty, I liked the atmosphere of the place. Staff was very attentive but would also let you sit and enjoy your meal and won't bother you much unless you ask for anything. Not too crowded for a Friday afternoon. Would come here again.",0,0,0,Marie Z.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",24,3,0
5.0,4/7/2019,Loved this place! We started with the Buratta which was great. The server recommended a bottle of italian red wine that we were not familiar with but it turned out to be fantastic. I ordered their homemade fresh fettuccine with white wine garlic sauce with shrimp which was so good! My wife ordered the salmon which of course i stoleA bite from and it also was amazing. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for really good italian food. Its not the sexiest ambiance but its also not bad...,0,0,0,Philip N.,"Palm Desert, CA",20,41,4
1.0,4/1/2019,"I knew, before setting foot here, that this pre-theater-crowd-catering faux -authentic Italian-adjacent eatery was a mistake. Friends who LIVE in the neighborhood--and thus should have had the wherewithal to suggest something halfway decent in Hells Kitchen--invited me, so I decided to check my preconceptions at the door, but when I asked our waiter what sort of mixed vegetables were in the whole wheat ziti sauce, and his response was ""mixed vegetables,"" I died inside a little. ""Do you not know what kind of mixed vegetables?"" I asked, helping this surly charlatan to admit that, no, he did not. That (and other unfortunate exchanges) might have been chalked up to dinner theater--everyone was on their way to or from a broadway show, after all--except that the food was as bad as any stage prop. Why did I order ravioli, when I knew in the depths of my soul that a box of frozen little envelopes of mystery cheese in sad red sauce would arrive, the box replaced by a plate? I was forced to then eye my dinning companions' entrees, and actually feel grateful--grateful!--I hadn't ordered the truffle pizza, which looked like a repository for everything the restaurant had discarded. Then there came a moment where I thought I spied the proprietor of Masseria del Vini, looking a little forlorn at the sight of his own garbage pie and his terrible life choices, and the curtain fell over that evening's performance, only to begin again tomorrow.

Our waiter's name is David. He's so Italian, and so adorable, and so great! The food is all homemade. Everything is made on the premises. The pastas, breads, breadsticks (the best we've ever had), sauces, and the desserts. I am very Italian  and I'm very picky about my Italian food - and this place is off the charts fantastic! We all feel like we are at homeMany people got the more complicated dishes such as chicken scallopini, pasta with truffles, etc. I got the homemade spaghetti with the homemade tomato sauce. Absolutely fantastic! I had The best ice cream tartufo I've ever had for dessert!  Even coffee is on point!   Now we are going to a Broadway show and out afternoon could not have started more wonderfully then at this spectacular restaurant!

1.0,3/6/2019,"I had a TERRIBLE experience at Masseria Dei Vini. My husband made a reservation and took me here for our anniversary. We were sat at some bogus table all the way in the back where we had no space and the wait staff kept bumping into us. Food was mediocre at best.When we tried to pay the bill with our gift card, they told us it was expired (it was not, it was 1 year old). We challenged them on this and they changed their story to ""It's actually not expired, but it does not have money remaining on it."" (It had never been used). We challenged them on this and asked them to show us their gift card records, to which they actually admitted that they don't actually have access to gift card sales records. We were forced to pay, and they promised they would reimburse us after their ""book keeper"" looked into the gift card sale the following day. That did not happen...We had to follow up for 3 weeks with the restaurant's manager(s) and book keeper because no one would call us back. I must have called the restaurant 10+ times and even tried going there in person showing proof of the gift card purchase before they finally reimbursed me. The managers were straight-up ignoring me until they realized I was not going away.Such a terrible experience. What should have been a wonderful evening was turned into a miserable experience by the staff, and they did not even have the decency to fix the problem in a timely or professional manner. The restaurant actually still owes me ~$50 because the gift card was more than the price of the dinner.",1,0,0,Joey F.,"Manhattan, NY",2,15,0

We started our mean with two glasses of wine and the polpettine alla fontelina as our first course, the appetizer was so tasty and full of flavor! For our main courses I had the gnocchi verdi which was in a cheese sauce(simply amazing!) while my husband had the special of the evening- pappardelle with lamb he said that the dish was heavenly and really hit the spot! We ended the meal with two desserts; the tiramisu and the torta di ricotta both dessert were fantastic and a great way to end the meal.If you are in the Hell's Kitchen area I strongly recommend checking out Masseria Dei Vini, you will not be disappointed!

Thank god for reservations.We were greeted by the host at the entry who quickly took our gates and seated us quickly to our table.Our server was a very friendly and enthusiastic gentlemen who gave us recommendations on food, the specials etc. We started off with a bottle of red that we share.For the appetizers, I ordered the burratta which i absolutely absolutely loved. The cheese was just lovely. My husband ordered from the specials which was a something with mussels and he really enjoyed the dish.For the main, the severer suggested me the Truffle risotto which was one of their specials for the night. I would rate this a bit low cause i am nit a very big fan of risotto and was confused between the ravioli and this. And the server made it sound so nice with mushrooms and truffle. It was well balance and flavored no doubt, but just not for me.My husband ordered the Spaghetti all Nero which was an absolute delight! Highly recommended. we ended the date with a beautiful Tiramisu. On our exit they gave me a rose, which were giving to all the ladies, for the Valentine specials, which i thought was a very nice touch. Goes on to show how much effort and thought they put in details. Great place to go for date. Impeccable service and rich food.",0,0,0,Anisha R.,"Manhattan, NY",171,308,1230

2.0,12/12/2018,It's a pretty place bustling and loud for the most part.  The prices are quite high with a steak at $85 and a salmon dish enough for four bites at $32.  Fried Calamari appetizer with shrimp and scallops at a whopping $25.  Anyhow the past dish was $27 and not large and the salmon even though ordered medium came out well done and dry.  The service seems lacking for the price points of this restaurant.  It should be five star and it's three.  I would say there are so many Italian restaurants they need to up their game.,1,0,0,Lara F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,47,0

We recommend this to all our friends visiting from Honolulu, Hawaii.Very nice ambience with a whole wall displaying their wine bottles! A perfect place to have a nice dinner!We started off with the special appetizer of the day: silky soft Buratta cheese, thinly sliced proscuitto and perfectly ripe quartered tomatoes on the side. They even provide an exquisite bottle of Olive Oil so you can drizzle it on your bread!My daughter ordered their famous Spaghetti Al Nero Con Vongole Veraci. Homemade squid ink spaghetti with fresh baby clams in a rich garlic but a very light white wine sauce. It was amazingly delicious!!! I was hesitant to try some of hers since the black spaghetti throws me off but it was cooked al dente! The baby clams were so fresh and juicy! I would definitely order this for myself next time!I had the Pappardelle Alla Bolognese because i love fresh pappardelle pasta. Home made fresh wide and thin Fettuccine Pasta with Homemade Meat Sauce. It was fabulous!The pasta is so fresh and soft with a nice serving of meat sauce. I wish it was tossed together with the sauce so that the noodles wouldn't clump together in a pile at the bottom of my plate. Oh well, still my favorite!The service was Excellent tonight! Thank goodness! The last time my daughter came with her boyfriend to celebrate their anniversary, she felt unwelcomed! :(Tonight, we were served a complimentary appetizer of fried zuchini which was such a pleasant and welcoming surprise!

He spoke really close to my face, was aggressive, and made me very uncomfortable. When I asked for parmesan for my chicken dish, they said no, because it doesn't ""go together"". When I protested, they said ""okay"" but that they would only put it on the side. Ok, fine. Then, the guy comes over and again refuses to give me any.

5.0,7/31/2018,"Absolutely the best Italian restaurant in New York City. I've been coming here for years and it does not disappoint. It is a bit pricey but totally worth it if you love fresh Italian food and want to treat yourself to an amazing dinner in the city.They get busy during dinner time and so it might be worth it to make a reservation. Their bar is first come first serve and full service so if the restaurant is full and your party is 2-3 people, getting a spot at the bar is great.I'd recommend starting with the burrata appetizer followed by the squid ink pasta dish. Their burrata is always fresh and creamy on the inside, just as it should be. The squid ink pasta is kept simple with a garlic and white wine sauce. It's hard to find squid ink pasta and this place does it perfectly. The pasta is chewy and tastes a bit like salty fish. If you like seafood and pasta this is not something to pass up.The servers are incredibly knowledgeable and answer any questions you might have. The bartenders are super friendly and take the time to talk to you. One time the bartender even let me try a couple different drinks. This place is great for groups, dates, and special events.

I am going to live by myself for the first time ever besides school dorms. Exciting and scary at the same time. The restaurant is fine dining, but neat, personal and kind. I went in in T-shirt and sneakers, but the staff didn't make me feel any different from those well dressed guests, which I really appreciated. I tried two specials - burrata cheese, cured beef and tomato to start, and grilled branzino for entry. The fish was the best of the kind that I have ever had, juicy, fatty and light, flavored by baby tomatoes and olives. For dessert, I had flourless chocolate cake and chocolate ice cream (in exchange for vanilla ice cream). The cake was light, sandy, nutty and loose in texture. The ice cream gave it the moisture and made it melt.As I thought I am stepping into a new dream, I learned someone from a past life is getting married.

2.0,6/18/2018,"Given the generally positive reviews, my husband and I hoped this place could be a new neighborhood favorite for a somewhat upscale dinner without having to wait in line or make a reservation for Marea.  We stopped by on Sunday night for dinner and unfortunately were disappointed.Because we arrived at the restaurant on the later side of the evening, we each had pasta (squid ink with clams and veal ravioli) and shared a side without ordering any appetizers.  My squid ink pasta was supposed to be in a white wine sauce but was mostly just olive oil and light on flavor, and there were multiple pieces of clam shell or sand that I had to pick out of the dish or my mouth as we were eating.  Both dishes were good enough for dinner but not anything I would return for.  We shared a side of broccoli rabe and, for $14.95, was very similar to $6.95 broccoli rabe anywhere else.  I would give the food 3.5 stars.  For the overall price of pasta here, we could've had a more enjoyable pasta dinner at Marea a few blocks away.More importantly, the service was very inconsistent.  The host/manager and some of the service staff were warm and inviting, while others were very nonchalant.  When we asked for the check, there were only 2 other tables at the restaurant.  It took almost 15 minutes for us to have our check, not to mention another several minutes to run our card.  Multiple staff members were standing by chatting casually while we were waiting for our check.  Is only one person and no one else permitted to bring a check?  The person who brought our check seemed to have split his time between chatting up the 2 larger parties in the restaurant then disappearing into the back.  Each time he walked by our table he would tell us to wait longer before we even had a chance to speak.  It felt like it took longer for us to get and pay the check than it did to eat the whole dinner!The larger parties seemed to have been enjoying themselves so perhaps this place is a better fit for large group special occasions rather than dinner for two.  Conclusion is we don't plan on coming back.",0,0,0,Jenny W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,36,4

Our server was probably the most frustrating of it all. He was frantic the whole time and pretty much ripped the menu out of my husbands hand. He also didn't offer us any specials. I only overheard another server listing them AFTER we ordered. I was so annoyed. We had to ask the bus boys for the bread, the cheese, soda because our server was just staring out the window the whole time. It was so bizarre. We had the Capricossa pizza as an appetizer and it was just ok. The bottom was so thin and raw I couldn't even pick up a slice. I had the shrimp ravioli for dinner and the sauce was watery and needed salt. I really didn't eat it and of course the server wasn't concerned when he cleared a full plate back to the kitchen. He didn't speak to us, didn't introduce himself, and looked visibly annoyed when we asked for a few mins to order. I really should have complained while I was there. The star of the night was my husbands choice, the squid ink pasta. That was really good - what I should have gotten. The flourless chocolate cake for dessert was alright.

5.0,3/20/2018,"I did a takeout from them through DoorDash. Here are my observations:1. The food arrived exceptionally well packaged. the Pizza had its own plastic bag that was large enough so it could be carried flat (wider more expansive bag I presume). The dessert (cake) was packaged in a different plastic bag and the ice cream in a different box from the cake. Finally the gnocchi was also packed separately and had ample Parmigiano cheese. packaging 5/52. The pizza - I asked for no meat, which is an exception to the item I ordered, which is what I got - table stakes, but god knows how many times people get things wrong. The pizza was delicious - thin crust and clearly made by someone who knows their pizza (a chef, not a cook). If you are looking for an authentic Italian pizza, don't think twice. On the flip side, if you are looking for a 'NY' or 'American' type pizza with crazy amounts of cheese and enormous portions, this is not the pizza for you.3. The Gnocchi - soft, cloud like, exceptional sauce - these were some of the best Gnocchi's I have had in a while, and I know my Italian food. I took my first bite (after the pizza) and went 'I never bother with writing reviews, but these people deserve the effort, they are making food they can be proud of, not just churning dishes'4. The Almond/Chocolate cake + Ice cream was perfect ! Not too sweet, not overwhelming, very well balanced and with a nice almondy taste. The ice cream was good Vanilla (nothing special, but not bad/cheap either). Again - I felt like I am in Italy getting proper Italian food, and you can't ask for more.Overall - looking forward to going for a meal there. Clearly there is someone in the kitchen who knows what he/she is doing and is on top of things. Bravo !",0,0,0,Israel H.,"New York, NY",6,7,0

I always get a little nervous about trying a new restaurant, especially an Italian​ one but we hit the lottery with this one, it was just such a great time all around!  What a great experience dining at this very authentic Italian restaurant in NYC.  The salads, beet, and artichoke with avocado were fantastic as were our pasta dishes.  The lightest ravioli, delicious Orrichiette and amazing sauce on a shrimp/ Artichoke triangular agnolotti.  The attentive staff was charming from our great waiter Issac, our bus boy Luigi and GM Alessio!  We felt like we had traveled to Italy without the 8-hour plane ride.  The restaurant was hip, had a nice vibe and we could hear each other talking.  desserts were on point, like a trip to Amalfi!  Fabulous Lemon cake!  We can't wait to go back it was such a fantastic evening!  Thank you all.",2,0,1,Buonarotti G.,"Washington, DC",18,249,642

Went here for pre-Opera dinner and left very satisfied. My wife and I shared the pappardelle di bolognese and the pork chop with sliced black truffles. The pork chop was juicy and tender and the black truffles were the perfect complement. The waiter recommended the ricotta cheesecake for dessert -- it was sensational.

I've had better Italian places by a long shot and went for a friend's birthday so brought some cake and there was a $5 per person cake charge. Absolutely not. I ordered the squid ink pasta and it was so bland, tasteless..ridiculous. It was supposed to be cooked with garlic, zero garlic in sight and seriously tasted like plain pasta with an undertone of sea water. The clams were over seasoned so if you ate the pasta and the clams together, it kinda balanced out. Didn't finish over half of it. Didn't take it home. Not good.

Came here for a romantic date night before going to see the tree, there's nothing like Christmas in the city!  We got there a little before our reservations so we had a drink at the bar, I had a Riesling and my boyfriend had a cab-both very good and we got complimentary breadsticks-also good! We were promptly seated and greeted for our reservation where we got a complimentary bread basket with a lentil and olive oil mixture-very different than usual but also very tasty! We ordered a bottle of Pinot noir and the eggplant cakes for appetizer-they were good but basically eggplant parm-3 mini cakes over sauce and cheese-for like $22. My boyfriend ordered the minestrone soup, which was a sizeable portion and seasoned to perfection. For entrees, I ordered the papparedelle bolognese and he got the veal ravioli with mushrooms-the ratio of mushrooms to ravioli was a little excessive. He didn't love this dish and I agree, it was subpar, lacking in flavor and portion size. My dish was scrumptious and enough for both of us (my bf was still hungry after his small dish). The service was on point but overall there was really nothing on the menu that sets this place apart from other Italian restaurants so it's not really worth the price.

Quite simply, we were in heaven from the minute we arrived at the bar and taken care of by Andrea, and then in the dining room with Gino as our server.  I know a little about wine, but will always take their lead with the wine selection  (especially Tuscan varietals) and what is tasting well on the menu.  Andrea is a budding young sommelier from Florence or thereabouts.  I highly suggest that you seek him out when visiting this restaurant.  This would definitely be the choice for my last meal, no question...thank you gentlemen!",0,0,0,Rolf D.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",96,50,8

Half of our party showed up 20 min early and our table was ready. However, we decided to sit at the bar until the rest of our friends arrived. Immediately, I knew we were in an authentic Italian venue as the manager, bartender and several patrons were all speaking Italian.

2.0,10/1/2017,"Buzzy atmosphere which was nice. The entrees (salmon; pasta special) were very well prepared, both in presentation and flavour, high marks there. However the appetizers (eggplant polpettini; friend zucchini) were disappointing, tasting of oily cheese (polpettini) and oil (zucchini). And not delicious olive oil, just cooking oil. The zucchini were served as superthin matchsticks rather than fritters, which seemed to add to the problem. It was basically all (oily) surface area with nothing inside.  Tomato sauce with the eggplant however was good. Tartufo for desert was attractively presented but tasted  chalky; supermarket level ice cream rather than the richer flavour one expects from a good Italian. Good wine. The atmosphere was detracted from by the fact that we had to experience the entire staff delivering the happy birthday song nine (we began counting after the third) separate times during our meal. It's nice that people want to come here for their birthday I guess? - but it began to feel like we were in a kids' party venue, a bit of a Chuck-E-Cheese situation. Do they offer some big birthday discounts or something? Also, it was sufficiently cold that I had to put my jacket back on for most of the meal despite being seated half way down the restaurant (away from the front windows); perhaps they hadn't made the transition from summer to fall yet with their temperature regulation. My second biggest gripe (I'll get to the kicker in a hot second) is that the service made us feel very rushed. Our waiter seemed displeased that we were not ready to place our order when he first came round (although we had swiftly put in an order for an aperatif, we were not just sitting around taking up space); when our starters came out they came out literally in the time it took for someone to walk to the kitchen and get them (i.e. they were not prepared in response to our order; whether they were fresh at the time or had been waiting under hot lights for someone to order the right thing, I don't know); and when we'd been eating our entrees for what someone presumably deemed ""long enough"" we were practically harassed to declare ourselves done. I was asked I think six times by four different staff members in the space of about eight minutes if I was done - apparently the fact that I still had quite a bit of food on my plate was a sign that I wanted it boxed rather than that I was, you know, still eating, which one would imagine would be the more obvious inference. Once I caved and gave them my plate, desert menus were on the table in the same moment. It was like they just couldn't wait to get that cheque on the table and see the back of us. I should note, we had come in early (having made a reservation) and there was absolutely no suggestion made when reserving or at any other time, that we should be out by a certain time, in order to facilitate a later seating. If that's a requirement I can respect that, but it should be articulated up front rather than making your guests feel like an imposition by taking their time over their meal. Nor were we ordering the cheapest things on the menu and nursing them an inordinately long time -- although even if we had been, we're still your guests and shouldn't be made to feel like an inconvenience). If you're going to see a show this could feel like attentive service. But if you're trying to enjoy your meal in a more relaxed way - as we made clear we were - it's a sour note.My crowning gripe - which may not apply to others, but I find rather unforgivable - is that I ordered, specifically, a decaf coffee at the end of my meal. The only reason anyone ever orders decaf coffee is because caffeine keeps them up all night which as we all know is a horrible feeling. That is just not a mistake a restaurant should make. Obviously it's not on par with giving, say, someone with a peanut allergy peanuts -- but if someone specifically flags a no-no substance for them, you should be very careful not to serve them up a nice steaming cup of it unawares. I am confident in saying what I was given to drink was not decaf. I could feel within thirty minutes that I was wired, and when I went to bed, endured about four hours of my brain manically chattering at me, despite being exhausted and so very much wanting to sleep. I'm not the tossing and turning type, and can recognise what caffeine in my body feels like.The result of all this endless caffeinated tossing and turning?

3.0,7/2/2017,"We had an early reservation before a show, so we arrived for an early dinner when the restaurant had not filled up yet. It is a small but lovely space which lends to a more formal but comfortable atmosphere.The menu had a lot to offer, but since it was early none of us was starving and we stayed with just a pasta dish. We ordered Triangolo Ai Gamberi E Carciofi (shrimp raviolis in a light tomato sauce), Pappardelle Alla Bolognese, and Spaghetti with Clams. The pastas were all light and fresh. The Bolognese had a deep slow cooked flavor and the light tomato sauce on the raviolis paired nicely with the rich filling. They have a well selected wine by the glass menu and I had a great glass of Rose with dinner that I really enjoyed. My only complaint was our server, who seemed annoyed with questions about the wine and menu, the restaurant was not busy as we were there early, so it was clear he just was not interested in interacting with our table.",1,1,0,Susan A.,"Chicago, IL",1,129,135
5.0,6/29/2017,"Masseria De Vini is a beautiful Italian restaurant that you will want to dress up for. We made dinner reservations here and you can be seated before your whole party arrives. They serve bread with olive oil and lentils before your food comes out. We started with fried zucchini and grilled baby octopus. The fried zucchini were thinly sliced and gently seasoned. I was surprised to love it so much. The grilled octopus laid on a bed of onions. It was a little salty for my taste but still lovey. For the main course I had the squid ink pasta with clams. It was delicious. The pasta is cooked perfectly with just enough bite to it. The clams are also big. I would definitely recommend this if it is your first time coming here. For dessert we ordered cheesecake and panda cotta. Both desserts were served with a side of vanilla whipped cream and strawberries. The vanilla whipped cream was amazing! You can really taste the vanilla and it is not too sweet. The cheesecake was light and fluffy. The panda cotta was the same as well. The desserts are lightly sweeten and very airy. You must order them!Other things to note: Staff walk around with pepper and parmesan for those who want. If you want to bring your leftovers home, the waiter will pack you food and have it ready for you in the front with the hostess. You get a ticket number for you food pick up.

1.0,4/19/2017,"Came back for a birthday dinner with four total people. The only person to enjoy their meal got the pasta and shrimp special while the two other standard menu pasta dishes tasted like frozen dinners and both didn't finish their meals. The veal had nice fresh chopped tomato salad on top but the veal itself lacked seasoning and was bland. My wife ordered a glass of red wine, referring to it specifically by the name listed on the menu (Toscanini Sangiovese/Cabernet blend). When the waiter brought a light colored wine she questioned if it was the right one. The waiter insisted it was correct and upon receiving the bill we say that we were charged for a Rose, so not what was ordered. It would have been fine except the wine wasn't good and it wasn't what was ordered. We also couldn't inform the waiter of any of these issues as he did not return to our table until the meal was over. To add insult to injury, my wife and father both separately asked to have a piece of cake with a candle brought to the table (one called ahead and the other confirmed at dinner). Although confirmed, this did not happen until after we paid the check and a member of our party had to remind them again before I tried to leave.

2.0,4/19/2017,"We were just here for my husbands birthday with my in laws. Such a disappointment. I called the day before to preorder dessert to surprise my husband with and reconfirmed the surprise dessert when we arrived. The woman I spoke to was very nice and helpful, however that's where the good experience ended. After we were seated we ordered drinks. I ordered a glass of red wine (rosso toscana) and was served rose. I said this to the waiter and he said ""no that's what you ordered"" and walked away. It didn't help that our waiter REAKED of b.o. The experience didn't get better from there. All of the food tasted freezer burned and was entirely under seasoned. Every dish we had was a bland, disappointing array of food. No one in our party came close to finishing their dish but our waiter never reappeared to ask how everything was and when he did come to clear our dishes he didn't seem at all surprised that no one had eaten their dinner, or at least he didn't inquire as to why our plates weren't touched. He asked if we wanted dessert, we said no (*wink wink*), assuming the dessert we preordered was on its way. It was not. He brought us the check, we paid and awkwardly loitered at our table waiting for it. After a few minutes my mother in law got up to inquire and several minutes later dessert was served. It was the only good thing we ate there so I'm glad we stuck around for it.

First off, my whole party had not arrived yet, but by the time a third of us arrived, the hostess was welcoming and showed us to our seats. Our table was already set and ready to go. Our waiter was patient and also great with helping me select the perfect wine for our meal. We ended up getting two bottles of wine which complimented our dishes, very well. For starters, the bread - especially the focaccia bread, is amazing! Fresh, soft, and wonderfully chewy - it went well with the olive oil-infused lentils. We also shared the Polpettine Al Fontelina (eggplant cakes with tomato sauce & basil) and the Terra Mare (grilled baby octopus & cuttlefish over an exquisite fava bean purée and onions). The fava bean purée was creamy, perfectly seasoned, and overall, the dish as a whole was harmonious. For my meal, I ordered the Orecchiette Alla Barese which was slightly too salty for me, but overall, I loved the dish. The brightness of the broccoli rabe, the sweet-spicy sausage, and the perfectly al-dente, cooked pasta - it was quite delicious. The other highlight of the night was the Gnocchi Verdi Al Tallegio e Raddichio. I hate cheese & most dairy products, but I had to try this dish because everyone at the table was raving about how soft and like butter, the gnocchi was melting in their mouth. The cheese sauce was very aromatic and almost vinegary, but my friend took most of the sauce away, and gave me a gnocchi. What I ate cannot be accurately described by my words, but it was amazing. I felt like I was eating a piece of tasty, chewy rice cake, but not as chewy as a Korean rice cake (dduk), because before I could chew too well, the gnocchi started melting in my mouth. Overall, the highlight of my birthday dinner meal was the melody of the Terra Mare with the focaccia bread, but the best part was being able to share the night with my dear friends.",3,0,2,Hannah L.,"New York, NY",74,179,97

As I waited I had a full fill of water and was approached for any drinks (I ended up ordering a glass of wine), and even though my friend was about 30 min late they let me sit there and wait anyway. For app I got the calamari with roasted herbs which were delicious, though the portion was admittedly smaller than I expected (I'm used to the much larger portions elsewhere but obviously prepared differently). Then I got the fish (broiled sea bream) with roasted peppers and potatoes that tasted very fresh. For dessert I got the lemon custard sponge cake that was honestly the highlight of my day - it was sooo good, not too sweet or custard-y yet satisfied my sweet tooth, especially the lemon creme that came with the cake.

I ordered the baked calamari appetizer and was very satisfied- it was cooked to perfection and the flavor was very delicious and balanced. I also had a bite of my mom's burrata- quite delicious. I ordered the pappardelle de la bolognese, which was wonderful- the pasta was obviously homemade and very delicious and tender (I was surprised it wasn't al dente, but it worked) and the sauce was flavorful and the perfect texture for the pasta. I was very happy, but I do slightly regret not ordering the squid ink pasta after seeing how beautiful it looked on the next table over. The only complaint was our waiter- he was a little aggressive and pushed my father to buy a slightly more expensive bottle than he initially selected. He also charged our table for tequila shots (which we certainly did not order.) We did not notice the charge until after we left the restaurant and management refunded the charge, but I still did not appreciate the sneakiness.",3,1,2,Courtney B.,"Seattle, WA",324,352,18
4.0,1/26/2017,"Went to Masseria del Vini for a girls night out and was happy with the meal. As soon as you walk in, the wall directly behind the hostess is a floor-to-ceiling wine display. The restaurant is open and airy and was surprisingly bright so it was the perfect ambiance to catch up with friends. A wine boasting restaurant, there was a large selection and surprisingly they had some reasonably priced bottles and glasses. Bottles started at $40 and went up from there. However, although the restaurant had a full bar, they did not provide a cocktail menu which was a little off-putting for non-wine drinkers. For appetizers, we shared the burrata which was supposed to come with prosciutto, however, the server told us the restaurant was out for the night. Not sure how an Italian restaurant in Manhattan runs out of prosciutto by 8PM (dinged one star). We still tried the burrata vegetarian style and it was very good and enough for four of us for an appetizer. For my entrée I tried the cheese ravioli which was just as delicious as the burrata. It was also a good size and I left feeling satisfied and full. For dessert we tried the tiramisu and the cheesecake which was more than enough for the four of us. The cheesecake wasn't sweet and tasted like custard so I wouldn't recommend that again, but the tiramisu was out of this world delicious. The restaurant is definitely on the pricier side especially given its Columbus Circle location. Three glasses of wine, shared appetizer, one entrée each, and two shared desserts came to $81 per person including tax and tip.If possible, I would probably give this restaurant 3.5 star due to the burrata/prosciutto mix-up, lack of a cocktail menu, and the unappetizing cheesecake dessert. However, the food was delicious and the server and service was really great so it gets 4 stars from me. I would return with some wine lovers.",1,0,0,Priya S.,"New York, NY",219,155,94

Within five minutes of ordering our food, it arrived even before we had the opportunity to enjoy our wine or the delicious bread basket. Therefore, we felt very rushed throughout the whole dining experience even though the restaurant was not particularly crowded.While the gnocchi was delicious and very rich, we were disappointed with the pizza. The pizza was advertised as having ground sausage. Unfortunately, the pizza we received, did have very good broccoli rabe and cheese on it, but the sausage was cut into large pieces, had absolutely no flavor or seasoning, and tasted as it if had been reheated and was not freshly prepared.Even though the atmosphere and gnocchi were good, we were hoping for an enjoyable and relaxing evening, but we ended up leaving feeling very rushed and disappointed with the pizza.",2,1,0,Ali B.,"Bergen County, NJ",1,9,0

2.0,1/14/2017,"Given the stellar reviews, I was expecting much more from Masseria dei Vini. Upon arriving at the restaurant, we discovered that our dinner reservation coincided with a wedding celebration, which occupied a large table in the middle of the dining room. The hostess checked us in, and then proceeded to ask if we'd prefer to wait forty-five minutes for the event's conclusion. Assuming that this wedding party didn't just wander into the restaurant unannounced, why didn't the hostess call us beforehand and offer to reschedule? Instead, they waited until we had already committed to Masseria dei Vini and gathered there without any alternative arrangements in place.And because we didn't have a table booked elsewhere, we decided to keep our original reservation, despite the circumstances. The hostess, as well as another gentleman (possibly the manager or owner?), assured us more than once that they would ""make up for it."" However, nothing was done to compensate for the inconvenience.The wedding guests were so loud that my party could barely engage in conversation, even though we weren't sitting far from each other. Our waiter had to walk over to us individually and crouch down to hear our orders. I requested the Minchiarieddhi Te Farru dell' Ortolano, whole wheat ziti pasta with mixed vegetables in a tomato sauce. Whole wheat pasta wasn't available that night, so they substituted with a different kind of pasta.Overall, my meal was pretty average; I anticipated greater flavor from the vegetables, which included carrots, broccoli, and squash. Unfortunately, the sauce didn't accomplish much flavor-wise either. At $21.50, it was far overpriced. Masseria's menu now offers this same dish for $23.50.Everything about our dinner was either frustrating or underwhelming. I'm not likely to return.",2,3,0,Daniela L.,"New York, NY",374,155,37

It's a bit overpriced for the food in my opinion and would probably rate this 3.5 stars. It's not bad, but I expected to be more wow-ed by this place. I've eaten at a few other Italian restaurants and Mario Batali restaurants and have enjoyed those more.From the outside this place looks pretty fancy, with white linen tablecloths and napkins, dim lights and a wall of wine bottles, but I didn't find it to to be snooty or stuffy. Don't feel like you have to get super dressed up to come here. Obviously don't come in workout gear but if you came in jeans and a nice top you'd be fine.The pasta ranges from $22-28 for the most part, and they have a decent selection of just proteins (steak, fish, duck) if that's what you want to eat. They'll give you a nice basket of complimentary bread with 3 different things (focaccia, French bread, and breadsticks) I got the squid ink pasta with crab and shrimp with a light tomato sauce. While it was good, I didn't quite find it amazing or wishing I had more when I was done with the dish. The portion size was at least decent and I wasn't hungry when I finished dinner. My boyfriend got the salmon and it was good, and also decently-sized, but wasn't really wow-ed by it either.Overall, this was a decent Italian place but not somewhere I'd go back again and again.

1.0,1/7/2017,"We were a group of 6 Italians that decided to travel from Atlanta GA to NYC to spend the night of Christmas Eve and eat some good and authentic italian food.So, we searched thoroughly  and in large advance for a good italian restaurant, in the end we booked our table at Masseria dei vini. (BIg MIstake)Our reservation was for 9.15pm. We all got there on time, but the hostess told us we would have to wait for about 10/15 mins.That was totally fine to us, we seated at the bar, ordered some drinks and after ONLY 40 minutes (!!!!!) our table was ready. Fine, nobody complained about that, we all work in the food industry and know that sometimes, especially during holiday season things don't go according to our plans.As soon as we seat the waiter come to us saying we only could order one item each from the menu because the kitchen was closing in 5 mins.Whaaaaat? While waiting, because we knew the kitchen closed at 10pm, my husband expressed his concerns to the hostess, who answerd ""we will not close until you guys get to eat""!At that point, we were angry and very disappointed, actually they were forcing us to eat, not what we wanted, but what they wanted us to!!!!We asked to talk with the manager.Carlo came to us saying ""things are like that, there is nothing I can do"" and walked away.We were all astonished by his attitude!!Everybody was hungry and was already too late to go look for another place to eat, so we didnt walk out.We ended up ordering just pasta and two pizzas. Pasta was ok, nothing nearly close to the italian flavors, just orecchiette with rapini, sausage and about 10 garlic cloves roughly chopped inside. My husband asked for a tagliatelle alla bolognese that came all stick together, which may be normal for fresh homemade pasta, but in an upscale restaurant you have to make sure that does not end up in a customer plate!!The manager sent a bottle of the cheapest prosecco to the table, a couple of appetizers and desserts on the house.The bill came to our table with a 50%off.But, all his attempts to fix his lack of professionalism and customer service, sending the waiter once with the prosecco bottle and then with the desserts, without even apologize for the ain, we were, and still are, too disappointed about this experience.Our Christmas Eve dinner was ruined!!!The only positive aspect of this restaurant was the waiting staff, very kind and attentive.Carlo ti consigliamo di cambiare lavoro!",5,5,1,Caterina S.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,0

5.0,12/24/2016,"Lovely restaurant in a strange neighborhood. Our server was extremely attentive and went out of his way to answer our questions and check back on us. Of course the chef split the appetizer into two plates when we said we would share, and all the dishes we tried were fantastic. I recommend the veal scallopini for a light meal.

5.0,12/18/2016,"A friend and I decided to come on a whim because we were in the Columbus Circle area and Yelped ""Italian"" and this place was right around the corner. I felt a little under-dressed because I was in denim shorts and a tank but everyone else looked a lot more put-together. It's not like anyone gave me weird looks or anything and you definitely don't need to dress nicely to come in here (I don't suppose you'll be kicked out if you wore flip flops), but it's just something to think about. My friend got the orecchiette pasta with broccoli rabe and sausage and I got the squid ink pasta with clams. I'm completely amazed by the efficiency of this restaurant because I kid you not, we ordered our food and it came out in 5 minutes. I swear. We literally took two bites of the complimentary bread and our food came out. We were so surprised--in a good way, of course! Especially because the quality of the food was not compromised. In fact, we both though the food was superb--we finished everything. Just wow. We didn't order any drinks but it would be great to order a glass or two of wine to go with our lovely meal.",8,3,5,Christy W.,"San Francisco, CA",1726,403,1728

5.0,12/14/2016,The service was on point. Everyone was friendly and accommodating. The complimentary bread was delicious!The frisée salad was probably the best thing I've ever tasted from an Italian restaurant. I actually ordered two because I had to have more after finishing the first one. Going back to the west coast tomorrow and I knew I'd be thinking about this salad for a very long time. I ordered two pasta dishes that were good. I usually stay away from ordering pasta but felt obligated to since we were at a nice Italian joint in New York City. I probably would have been happier ordering the fish special of the day. The desserts were top notch. We had the tiramisu and the custard.

Ordered the very well made hand crafted negroni (with illegal mescaline).  That made me feel slightly mysterious ;)Ordered the orchiette which was out of this world and the sautéed spinach which I would say was just ok. Not bad, Just not memorable.  Artichoke salad was very original and very rich. Not light but savory and satisfying. I recommend it.And their sister restaurant on the west side.

A very nice touch.For starters, ordered a bottle of Montepulciano Abruzzi $45 along with their appetizer special Burrata for 2 $34.50. The cheese and tomatoes were simply delicious. Main course featured Spaghetti Nero (black ink) paired with clams $25.50 and Petto D'Antara (sliced duck breasts cooked medium paired with risotto). Both dishes were exceptional.

After we were seated, we waited at least 20 minutes for anyone to greet us. The server went through several specials with us, and proceeded to take our appetizer order. He rudely asked me which of the three appetizer calamari dishes I would like, even though he saw me open the menu to select the fried calamari from menu, and not one of the other calamari dishes he ""mentioned."" It was a very passive-aggressive move on his part. I told him I had been waiting so long and was so hungry that I just couldn't think straight.We sat without any wine for another 20 minutes. Wine arrived as main courses did (the food literally came out in six minutes). We ate, and just wanted to get the heck out of there. The food was very good despite the front-of-house f*ups.

If you like it make sure you top it with generous amounts of fresh grated parmesan and black pepper. Good ambience, and fast service and most of the things we ordered were good. I wish the bread that was served was warm and with a nice dip instead of some lentils which did not have too much flavor. The bread sticks were great though and I couldn't stop eating them. We ordered calamari appetizer, which was okay - nothing special about it and wouldn't order it again. It is served with few calamari, some shrimp and average tasting marinara. All the entrees we got were great though, which includes the chicken entree (Bocconcini Di Pollo Al Vin Cotto) and another pasta my friend ordered which I am sorry I don't remember.

I had gotten the red snapper special and my boyfriend, the porkchop special last night. Neither of us had any complaints. Cooked beautifully. The wine list is also great.

The branzino was presented whole initially and then filleted for me on a plate. I guess you can't go wrong with this typical Mediterranean meal but it was definitely a pleasant experience with the setting and service. Every table was occupied and the restaurant had a nice buzz / decibel levels allowed for conversations. This restaurant is worthy of repeat visits - need to try the pastas.

1.0,7/29/2016,"I've tried three times now and still don't understand. How does this place get such high ratings?? If you want to spend an exorbitant amount of money for mediocre food, come here. If you want food that has some modicum of flavor and at reasonable prices, try any other Italian restaurant in the neighborhood. At the same price point you can go to Gabriel's (amazingly better food and ambiance) or A Voce (ditto) or Bello (my current favorite) or for less money and better food you can go to Bocca Di Bacco or Briciola, both of which kill the sterile, doctors' office ambiance found here. Most importantly is price. Tonight I spent $20+ for a ""burrata"" appetizer (awful- 1) it needed salt, pepper and better quality ingredients and 2) don't try to trick your customer serving mozzarella as burrata) and $30+ for a pasta entree (literally a bowl of noodles with tomatoes, basil and mozz) that the chef recommended be eaten without pepper or cheese added. I recommended to the chef that salt or Pecorino Romano be added if they wanted to serve an edible dish.

All of us ordered wine, entrees, dessert and coffee the bill was $250.00 which was fine. Halfway through enjoying our entrée, the waiter whispered in my ear that the manager asked that we hurry up, they have to turn the table. I was shocked and figured I was on a T.V. Show like ""What would you do,"" I asked him to depart or send the manager over. When he brought the dessert with coffee he also brought the bill and asked if I could pay for it now to speed things up. I tried to hide what was going on from my dinner guests, but they were confused and I was embarrassed. Wanting to give the manager a chance to respond, two days later I called back and spoke to the General Manager and told him what happened, he said he would look into it and call be back within 48 hours, he never called me back.

5.0,5/9/2016,"This restaurant exceeded my expectations (and from reading reviews, my expectations were already high). We chose this spot because it was conveniently located near Jazz at Lincoln Center. But it's also an incredibly delicious meal with excellent service. The hosts were prompt and friendly. Our server (I think his name was Enzo) was fantastic. He made sure the courses were spaced appropriately and came by multiple times during the meal to check on us and to pour more wine -- we never had an empty wine glass for more than a minute or two. And the food? Delicious. Combine that with the upscale atmosphere, and this turned our to be an excellent choice.

4.0,5/3/2016,"Came here on a weekend night with a large group and our table was ready for us upon our arrival, no waiting. We ordered drinks, appetizers, entrees, and desserts - the whole shebang.

Notable dishes personally for our group included fritto misto del golfo (fried shrimp and calamari), costoletta di vitello alla milanese (veal chop), trancio del salmone (grilled salmon). The tartufo for dessert was really great too. Portions are definitely for 1 person, not big family style portions.Food: 4.5/5 Service: 4/5The only thing that wasn't great was the difference in prices on the bill and on the menu. Unfortunately we didn't realize until too late that some of the prices of the entrees were a few dollars more than as listed on the menu. Not sure if maybe prices changed but the menus weren't changed to reflect that, or if we were just charged extra.

I called the restaurant the next day to inform them of this mishap and all they had to say was ""we're sorry that happened to you"". Given that I am a non-confrontational person, I sort of just accepted that apology. But in hindsight i spent $150+ only to have my mother's birthday ruined...I was at least hoping they would give us the meal for free, or  offer us another meal on the house.

I think the wait staff was confused as we had 3 different waiters ask us if we wanted to order drinks when it is clear we had drinks at the table. We finally got our waiter in order and he gave us the specials and other information- It originally appeared like he wasn't paying attention because we would ask him for something and he walked away. The food was delicious...I ordered the chickpea soup (YUM!) and the Pappardelle pasta with the tomato sauce (I thought the Pappardelle pasta was a little thin but good).

Great selection of authentic homemade pasta dishes like triangular ravioli stuffed with shrimp and artichoke & the half moon ravioli stuffed with veal in a mixed wild mushroom sauce. We couldn't decide on which so our waiter Reid said why decide I'll serve you a half portion of each. Great idea and both tasted amazing. Veal Milanese so tender and Orecchiette with  broccoli rabe and sausage another standout. This is a great place, and has many other options. They even imported a wood fire pizza oven from Naples Italy to make their large selection of pizza pies. All desserts are made in house...

4.0,3/5/2016,"I'm so glad a place like this opened up in my neighborhood! The bottom line about this place is that they serve high quality food at reasonable prices. In terms of cost - they're not quite at the level of fine dining pre fixe menus. For dinner most dishes will be in the $20-$30 range. What's amazing about the price point is that the food and ambiance are reflective of a much more expensive establishment. As such, Masseria Dei Vini is an amazing value for a upscale night out.I highly recommend their homemade pastas. I've tried the squid ink spaghetti with clams and it's truly divine. The garlic white wine sauce is deliciously buttery and perfectly balanced. They don't skimp on clams and you'll be pleased with the pleasant plate arrangement. You also can't go wrong with the pappardelle alla bolognese or the orecchiette alla barese. This will be new go to spot for a nice night out in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood!

As an appetizer we had the eggplant cake and the stuffed mozzarella cheese, which were good, but a pit more seasoning on the eggplant would have been nice.As an entree I had the grilled chicken and my friend the veal. My chicken was pounded so thin, that it tasted very light. The atmosphere is posh and the waiters were attentive.

I am not big on pizza,, but do like truffles so it worked for me that there was enough of the truffle flavor and that the cheese was of a higher caliber than much of the pizza out there. We moved to shared salads and the beets and greens salads were excellent. Fresh ingredients make such a big difference and these were fresh.  The dressing was vinegar based but light enough to enjoy and cleanse the palate with a nice refreshing touch.  The enree for me was the Spaghetti Al Nero Con Vongole which worked better than I thought it would.  A little on the salty side with the dark pasta but at the same time it accentuated to taste of the clam sauce.

4.0,1/17/2016,"We were visiting NYC for one night and wanted to dine at a classy and reputable Italian restaurant. Masseria Dei Vini appeared on our Yelp search. We looked at the reviews and menu and booked our reservations via Open Table for 6:15 on a Friday night. Beautiful restaurant! Their service was excellent from the moment we entered. Our waiters were very friendly and attentive. I tend to ask for food suggestions and they were eager to answer. In fact, everything we ordered came suggested by our waiters!We started with a bottle of wine. I can't remember the name but I thought the price was okay, being that we were at a nice restaurant in NYC. The wine was good, especially when paired with bread from their awesome basket. There were several types of breads....but we really enjoyed the bread sticks and even asked for extras to take with our leftovers. A lentil sauce came with it and that was different.We ordered:Lobster Salad - This was a special of the day. It was very light with generous amounts of lobster. Cavatelli Ai Frutti Di Maree Purea Di Piselli - (Translation) Coffee bean shaped pasta with a mixed seafood sauce, on a bed of pea purée. Yummy! The pasta was unique (coffee bean shape as noted) but good and the sauce was heavenly. There were assorted pieces of seafood and the pea purée on the bottom added a different flavor to this dish. Not too rich, which was good. Presentation was beautiful. The Night's Special: Shrimp and Zucchini Pasta. The pasta was different, it was smoked and somewhat tubular in shape but very gummy. I loved the sauce and the shrimp but I would've preferred a different pasta. Dessert: Cheesecake. It was light and good but I wish I ordered the Tiramisu. Our waiter suggested this and we weren't raving about it. The conclusion to our evening was rather odd. Our dinner lasted longer than we anticipated because my friend and I were enjoying the moment. So the manager came over and literally but politely kicked us off the table. He said the next party had been waiting (it was 8:40 and their reservations were at 8:15). I totally understand that they needed to turn over the table but I thought it could've been addressed in a different manner. My friend, who used to work in the food industry, said that she would've handled it differently and ask the patron to continue at the bar, a drink on her if needed. We left having mixed feelings about the evening. The food and service were excellent, so I'll just leave it at that....",8,1,1,Kanoe I.,"Honolulu, HI",564,166,682

2.0,1/2/2016,"Having dined at their sister restaurant La Masseria several times in the past, I really was looking forward to my first dinner here. Sadly, it will be my last. Masseria Dei Vini took over the space that used to be Whym. However, they have done extensive renovations which merged the two rooms and made the restaurant feel more spacious. An open Pizza oven is next to the bar. Overall, the decor is pleasant and the noise level, though loud, is tolerable when the restaurant is full. On to the food. My beet salad was acceptable. The various components of the dish were at variable temperatures which can be expected with the beets being cold, the potatoes and carrots being room temperature and the goat cheese puff being slightly warm. But somehow, the sum was less than its parts. It was OK but distinctly inferior to the other similar salads I've had recently. My dining partner had the Romaine Salad with pear, walnuts and gorgenzola dressing. My dining partner said it was good except the walnuts tasted stale. For our second course my dining partner had TRIANGOLI AI GAMBERI E CARCIOFI, which the menu describes as ""Homemade Triangular Shaped Ravioli stuffed with Shrimp and Artichoke, in a light Tomato and Shrimp Sauce."" My partner said that the various components of the dish didn't mesh together as a whole, and the portion wasn't worth the price charged. I had the BOCCONCINI DI POLLO AL VIN COTTO, FUNGHI E CIPOLLOTTI, Chunks of boneless chicken with Mushrooms & Shallots, in a red wine sauce. The chicken tasted sweet as if it had been marrinated in a sweet marinade. The dish certainly did not taste ""Italian"". I've read reviews that say that this restaurant is ""authentically Italian"". Having been to Italy 4 times and dined and several ""authentic"" Italian restaurants throughout the world, I strongly disagree. The main reason for my 2 star rating is the service, which has to be among the worst I've experienced in years. We were greated at the door, the hostess acknowledged our reservation, and we were brought to our table. At no point did they offer to check out coats. The server brought the menu and wine list. My dining partner ordered a cocktail and we ordered our meal. 5 minutes later, our appetizers arrived. We had yet to get bread. In an ""authentic"" Italian restaurant, bread is the first thing that arrives to the table. We were nearly finished with our appetizers when we finally got the opportunity to ask for bread. At this restaurant, a plethora of staff hurry too and fro, to and fro, yet the service is incredibly inattentive. Our entrees arrived, and my dining partner desired to order a glass of wine, yet no staff ever came to the table until we were done with our entrees. The staff at this restaurant are focused on getting things off the table and getting things to the table, but seem to have no understanding of communicating with the diners during the meal.  I witnessed one waiter awkwardly serving a bottle of wine to an adjacent table while the restaurant sommelier was impeccably serving a probably more pricey wine to another table. When my dining partner's entree was complete, the staff removed the plate and cleaned the crumbs from the table. When I finished my entree later, the staff removed the plate and presented us with the dessert menus, never bothering to clean the table. Then they wanted to bring coffee before offering us dessert. Authentic Italian restaurants bring dessert first and coffee is always the last course. Sadly, a major disappointment.",2,2,0,Bob G.,"JAMAICA, NY",17,213,400

Waiter told us they were for one person each but we easily split both dishes. The salad was good, nothing stood out about it. The meatballs though were wonderful. Two large meatballs with marinara and cheese on top with great flavor. Definitely recommend. For the entrée I got the Gnocchi with radicchio and cheese sauce. Not a huge portion, but with the apps and bread (not the biggest fan of the lentil oil dipping sauce) it was plenty of food. The pasta had a nice flavor balance between the cheese and radicchio. I was a bit concerned it would be really heavy, but it wasn't at all. I'm thinking next time I go I'll order the bolognese though because based on those meatballs they make a mean meat sauce. Overall atmosphere was really nice. Very comfortable, plenty of room between the tables.

I have had the pleasure of dining here for lunch twice - once at the bar alone, and once with my man in the dining area.First, it is beautiful inside. Clean lines, impeccably clean, tasteful decor. Gorgeous from top to bottom. Even the power room is gorgeous and sparking clean. Second, the service. Top notch from the hostess to the busser/water server to the server. Polite, knowledgeable, friendly, attentive (but not breathing down your neck either). They don't rush you - this is a real Italian experience.Third, excellent wine choices, by the bottle and by the glass (quite an impressive, extensive list, I might add). And finally, the food. Oh, the food...a cornucopia of deliciousness. It begins with the bread basket...with the added pluses of perfectly seasoned Italian crackers and a lentil dipping oil. You would think you died and gone to heaven. But, don't overfill here...the best is coming. Try the mozzarella (imported from Italy), tomato, prosciutto and basil appie...melt in your mouth! Then, the Crudo Del Giorno...raw fish of the day. Outstanding! My favorite pasta / entrée: Pappardelle Alla Bolognese...homemade fresh wide fettuccine pasta with homemade meat sauce. Holy cow, are we in Puglia, Italy? Oh, no, we are in NYC! What a bargain at $17.50! My guy ordered the Paccheri Al Sugo Di Tracchiole...large rigatoni pasta with short rib ragout. Again, TDF! Note, they also have an authentic Italian pizza oven - I want to give their pizza a try next time...but, I am so in love with the Pappardelle it may never happen.

The portion of a signee steak was like 3 ibs totaling of 6 ibs for both of us. I mean how can anybody assume we to eat all that meat into our stomach?

Our waiter was friendly, accommodating, funny, and helpful. We were provided a basket of three types of bread- crusty Italian bread, a hearty whole wheat bread, pillowy focaccia, and grissini. To accompany this we were provided a savory Tuscan-inspired olive oil lentil tapenade with garlic essence that whet the palette without being too heavy.We moved on to the mushroom risotto with chanterelles and truffles. The flavors in this dish were so intense, umami, rich, that my heart actually began to race. It was creamy, but the risotto itself was served pleasantly al dente. Not for the faint of heart. Talk to your doctor to make sure you are healthy enough for this kind of activity. It was that good.Our carne was an earthy, tangy blend of both light and dark meat chicken sauteed with onions in a dark red wine reduction. I'm usually not crazy about chicken, because face it, chicken is bland, but the chef's pairing of both light and dark meats basted in the reduction made me look at chicken again in a whole new light.For desert we had a refreshingly light lemon sorbet with fresh berries that were sweet, ripe, and full of juice.Yum.

3.0,8/7/2015,"Where do I begin?  Wednesday evening was the third time I've eaten here.  The first two times we were very happy.  However, we were there for lunch, and there were half the people there, thus leading to better service, more carefully prepared food...etc.  We even took the time to talk to the manager to tell them how much we enjoyed the food.Wednesday was the most expensive disappointment I think I've had in NYC.  We ordered specials, which generally can be a few bucks more than the entrees on the menu.  And I'll get back to that in a bit.  What came as an appetizer for the table was a 12"" pizza with 5 scallops wrapped in bacon and some kind of cream sauce, cheese, and mushrooms.  Meh.  The cream sauce was very thin with not a lot of flavor, the cheese slid right off the pizza when you took a slice, and the crust was a little soggy from the thin cream sauce.  Entrees were also from the specials menu.  Soft shell crab and the chilean sea bass.  I took a taste of the crab and it was just ok.  Was actually quite disappointed.  My partner and I both had sea bass and it was, again, just ok.  The cuts of fish were what seemed like scraps, overly breaded, with a single jumbo shrimp on top.  Just ok.  But this is NYC...which has become the land of ""just ok"", so I thought nothing of it.  Until the bill arrived.  That pizza was 30 bucks, and the entrees were $36.50 each.  Had the quality of the food met the price, you'd see no complaints from me.  But I was simply blown away by how expensive this was.  Maybe it was because they were busy...but still that was no excuse for such poor food quality at such a cost.  3 stars.  The first two times there was delightful.  But stick to the menu.  Be careful of the gouging on the specials.  They're really just not that good.  I absolutely hate writing negative reviews.  But this was kind of not cool.  For what I paid for that dinner, I could have gone somewhere I REALLY love.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",1,1,0,G F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0

Attentive (yet not overbearing) service.  Everyone speaks Italian, which made the entire experience pretty authentic in terms of Italian wine bars/eateries.  I noticed a few servers tasting a wine on the other side of the bar, which was refreshing...ya gotta drink it in order to give good recommendations!

The service was very friendly and attentive, the timing of food was spot on. Oh the food! It was delicious. We weren't starving so we skipped the appetizer, but our entrees were amazing! My friend had one of their pizzas, just enough for one really hungry person or for two people to share after having a salad. I had the Spaghetti al Nero it was light, substantial, and delicious! We weren't going to get dessert until we saw the menu, so we went with the tiramisu. Amazing!

4.0,6/30/2015,"KenScale: 8.0/10I'm always a sucker for good, classic Italian food. Masseria dei Vini is a new Italian restaurant from the team behind La Masseria in Midtown West (which I had never been to) showcasing the cuisine of Puglia region in southern Italy. I went on a recent visit to check out the food there and overall was very satisfied with the classic food coming out from the kitchen.I would say the food at the restaurant is probably closer to traditional than modern, but that doesn't mean the food is boring or pedestrian. I enjoyed grilled baby octopus and cuttlefish so much on a bed of fava beans puree. The octopus and cuttlefish was cooked very nicely, and I loved the fact that they weren't over-seasoned but rather worked with the puree for a rustic yet satisfying flavor. The restaurant has a selection of pizzas, and the tartufo nero pie with mozzarella, fontina, parmigiano and black truffle was a winner, again with modest seasoning that helped enhance the flavor of black truffle. I found the squid ink spaghetti with baby clams, garlic and white wine sauce to be a little bit too oily even though the noodle was cooked with nice firmness. For the main dish, we went for the oven roasted whole branzino (the menu shows sea bream but the server offered branzino with the same style) served in a cherry tomato sauce with olives and capers, and I really liked the perfectly cooked fish that wasn't heavy to my liking. For dessert, simple panna cotta of vanilla and strawberry flavor was serviceable to end the meal.The restaurant is located in a somewhat obscured neighborhood on the border between Hell's Kitchen and Columbus Circle (my dining companion who lives in Upper West Side didn't know this place existed). It has a classy Italian vibe and the service was attentive and professional. Getting a reservation wasn't overly challenging, and but the restaurant was starting to fill up in the course of my dinner. There is an extensive wine list with emphasis of course on Italian selections. Masseria dei Vini is a classic Italian restaurant that I think would work pretty nicely for pre- or post-theatre options if you have a Broadway show to catch in the evening.",6,1,2,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

As soon as you walk in you leave the 9th Avenue grit and enter a nicely decorated, tasteful and cheerful place with moderately upscale decor that is lively, but not too loud. Service is attentive but not intrusive. Our waiter was there to help with our ordering, and there was always someone to pour water or wine, someone to remove plates and bring clean flatware for the next course.The food was very good.

5.0,4/20/2015,"This restaurant was absolutely excellent. Right away, I knew we were in good hands as many of the staff were speaking Italian to one another. The Chef I believe is from Bari, and Puglian influences made their way into the menu. The restaurant was busy on a Thursday night, but we managed reservations through Open Table. As soon as we arrived, we were seated immediately. Service was excellent. The waiter (Reed) had personality and was well-versed on the menu, Italian culture/food, and wine. The staff also paid attention to the pacing of the meal, which I appreciated because I hate finishing one course and having the next in front of me before I can even put down my fork.The décor has a modern, classy feel. Lots of people in suits. It was fitting for the part of town (midtown West, near Lincoln Center, Time Warner Center, not far from the theater district). This does not look like Nonna's Italian restaurant.The menu was fantastic with so many great options, it was almost difficult to choose. They also have pizza, which is made in the Neapolitan tradition with a proper oven and procured ingredients. The crust took me right back to being in Naples - thin but soft so it almost pulls apart. Pizza's are personal size, in keeping with Neapolitan style. Mine came with mozzarella, pork cheeks and a light tomato sauce.We also shared a generous portion of fritti misti (mixed fried seafood - think calamari, scallops and shrimp). You could tell that the fish was hand-dipped in flour and lightly fried. Very good, and the marinara on the side had a nice sweet flavor with a healthy addition of garlic.The wine list had excellent choices and also fairly priced bottles (there were several reds in the $50 - $80 range, which is quite good for NYC, especially considering the quality of their selection).I would highly recommend this place to tourists and locals alike.

5.0,4/2/2015,"Masseria Dei Vini does all things wonderful that start with a ""p"".  Like pasta, pizza, and perfect dinner date with my fiancé.  Okay, so that last one is a stretch but it doesn't make it any less true.  On my ongoing hunt of homemade pastas I found myself at the doors of Masseria Dei Vini.  A largely spaced restaurant with a bar on one side and a wall of wine on the other.  The restaurant was dimly lit and bustling with activity on a Saturday night.  In keeping with all things that start with ""p"", we started dinner with 2 ""pre-entrees"" (also called appetizers).  We tried the Terra Mare, grilled baby octopus and cuttlefish.  It was one of the most tender and well cooked cephalopods I've had in a long time.  Soft with tons of moisture and not overpowered by salt or other seasonings, just the octopus' and cuttlefish's briny flavor with a dash of lemon juice.   We also ordered their Carpaccio Di Manzo, a well plated appetizer of thinly sliced raw beef, slices of parmesan cheese on top with arugula and hearts of palm. The arugula and hearts of palm were fresh.  The raw beef was so thin it almost felt like the meat would melt in your mouth.   Somewhat like a salad, it's an excellent alternative if you're looking to try something different.  Next we dined on the Calabrese Pizza.  Made with tomato sauce, mozzarella and sweet Italian sausage and a spicy Calabrian spread sausage called N'Duia.  It was a new experience for me since I had never tried N'Duia before.  It's an interesting sausage since you can literally take a knife and spread it on bread, almost like you would with any paste like substance.  The sausage has this aromatic, feel good on your tongue spicy flavor and not the make your eyes water and cry, like you haven't since you were a child, spicy.  The pastas were just superb.  From the texture of the pastas to the flavors of the sauce, I was truly blown away by their caliber of food.  Lets start with the Pappardelle Alla Bolognese, your standard and very common pasta known by most people who eat pasta regularly.  Well, odds are you haven't tried anything similar to this version of Pappardelle.  The wide fettuccine pasta is homemade, so that alone is a huge score for me.  The width of the pasta was not as wide as other Pappardelles I've tried before.  It was much narrower but made paper thin.  That paper thinness made the pasta a lite and flavorful bite with every forkful.  The pasta itself had a wonderful eggy flavor.  Other places tend to make the Pappardelle wide, huge and thick with a doughy flavor.  The meat sauce was well blended into the pasta folds and not dolloped onto the top of the plate.  I originally ordered the Spaghetti Al Nero Con Vongole, but my fiance saw my dish, tasted my dish and ultimately swapped my dish for her own.  Before I parted ways with the homemade squid ink spaghetti, I was able to get several delicious bites in.  The garlic and white wine sauce consisted of a buttery flavor that added a great aroma and a balance to the lightly salty squid ink spaghetti.  The clams were fresh and held onto a great amount of their briny moisture which coated the pasta.  I will definitely return someday and hopefully get a full plate to myself.I don't recall the last time I pecked at such phenomenally platted provisions of food.  Overall, I had a perfectly planned place to pig out on some pleasantly presented pizza and pastas.",7,3,3,Louis N.,"New York, NY",375,218,459

5.0,3/20/2015,"I loved everything about this spot - overall it is a charming, authentic Italian restaurant and a great addition to its neighborhood!Eat - For appetizers, I had the I Cucuzielli Fritti (crispy fried zucchini), basically shoestring zucchini fries, which were deliciously salty and satisfying. I also had the Insalata Di Carciofi (artichoke salad, with avocado, pistachios & parmesan cheese), which was not your typical dinner salad - the avocado was the base, giving this dish a creamy, but light texture. All of the ingredients combined superbly well into a great starter salad (without any salad!). For dinner, I ordered the Pappardelle Alla Bolognese (fettuccine pasta with meat sauce). It was a well done, traditional and very filling Italian dish - the pasta was a perfect al dente and I would expect no less from this place. Sip - I sat at the bar and was contemplating the drink menu when I saw the bartender make a ""homemade"" dirty martini by muddling olives and using the muddled olives as the olive juice - on a whim, I tried one and you could definitely taste the difference.

The staff were all very attentive, and I recall my boyfriend making a comment that he was trying to finish his glass of water but couldn't because they would refill it before it was even half full. Also, I am on a search for the best spaghetti in New York and this place would definitely make the top 3 (to note, I've also had Scarpetta's and I personally think this place beats theirs). It was perfectly al dente and the fresh tomato and basil sauce was to die for. So when we were finishing up the meal, we heard a guy from the table next to us complain about the music saying that he can only hear the beats and not the melody.

At first glance, the appetizers looked pricey, but they proved to be worth every penny. My beef carpaccio was perfection -- sliced paper thin and laced with parmesan. My husband's crab appetizer, a special, was superb, and my daughter had nothing but praise for her romaine/ gorgonzola salad. The pasta and pizzas that followed were terrific as well. The quality, inventiveness, and freshness of the food never wavered. Our server (Reed) was knowledgeable and utterly delightful, but never hovered. What I especially liked about this place was that while the food was some of the best I have eaten in New York, there was not a shred of pretentiousness . We had friendly exchanges with our server, the manager, and the busboy (including shared photos of the king crab in the kitchen!). In short, we had an evening of fine food AND fun.

2.0,1/29/2015,"I am perplexed by the rave reviews of this place.  On the plus side, the service is excellent and everyone is super nice and polite.  The space is nice, not too cramped and not too loud.  Since it's new, it was easy to get a table, and they seated us promptly. However, unfortunately the food is just so-so, and doesn't warrant the prices they charge.  Starting from the top: I am doing a dry January so I asked for a non-alcoholic drink.  Masseria's bar has just the most basic mixers -- grocery store sodas, seltzer, etc.  This basic approach to food and drink was evident throughout our meal. I had a salad starter -- their signature salad Masseria.  It was not horrible just tasteless, with a gross roasted red pepper draped across the top. For an entree, I had salmon, which was also tasteless, with grilled zucchini in a strange but very heavy cream sauce (why would you do that to zucchini???), and mashed potatoes with so much butter and cream as to be virtually inedible. If I had to summarize the food, it's striving to be a notch up from your standard southern Italian fare, but not quite there.  Heavy, but with the flavor stripped out, and some strange choices.  The one food bright spot was the dessert - tiramisu, done the way tiramisu should be done, and therefore, delicious.  Also, extremely generous portion (two of us could not finish it). They also have a very nice bread basket with lots of starchy stuff for breadaholics like me.  I know this place is new so I hope they are able to iron out the kinks...",2,1,0,Tamara L.,"Croton-on-Hudson, NY",1,43,36
4.0,1/27/2015,Was looking for a restaurant near Lincoln Center for a Saturday night. Found this place on Yelp. The space has a clean elegance and warmth. Had 6:15 reservations for 2 but arrived at 6:00 and was offered a table (even though my guest had not yet arrived). The table was exactly as I'd requested when I made the online reservation. The service was attentive and efficient without being intrusive. I felt welcomed from the moment I entered the door. There's an extensive wine menu. Our meal delicious. We had the sole special topped with a jumbo (no lie) shrimp and the seafood ravioli. Dessert was a chocolate almond cake and ice cream. All in all a wonderful dining experience. We'll be back.,0,1,0,Kayo D.,"New York, NY",0,1,0

5.0,1/25/2015,"I dined here yesterday night with my girlfriend and a couple of friends upon recommendation of a dear friend of mine that works at La Masseria in Times Square.The restaurant is nice, modern and well managed. With a reservation for 6:00 pm, we were seated right away, and served a delicious focaccia with bits of Parmigiano Reggiano and salame to taste while looking at the menu. I must say that the olive oil they serve is top quality. I have rarely experienced such good quality in Italian restaurants in New York.Got the Torcicoda Primitivo del Salento, one of my favorite red wines because of its thick body, and started with the burrata over arugula salad and an octopus carpaccio, tasty and gentle at the same time.I shared two entrees with my friend, the risotto with scallops and asparagus and a grilled swordfish sided with potato puree and sauteed spinach, both exquisite. I have also tried a bite my girlfriend's (incredible) fresh fettuccine with eggplants, mozzarella and fresh tomato sauce.Ended dinner with a (real) espresso and amaro Lucano.Prices are fairly appropriate given the high quality of the food and the impeccable service. Our waiter, Reed I guess, was with us all the time and accommodated all our requests.Great restaurant, great meal in a great ambiance. Strongly recommend this place, it's a 5 minutes walk from the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, which makes it the perfect candidate for a meal before the opera or other exhibitions. I have tried many Italian restaurants in New York, being Italian native, and this goes in my top 5 list without doubts.",0,2,2,Angelo T.,"Jersey City, NJ",18,22,1
2.0,1/24/2015,"I think most of the reviews on this new restaurant are fake.  Why do new places feel the need to do so?  I had high hopes as this is right next to my apartment and I watched them build out the space.  Shared two dishes and neither was very good.  First, the squid ink pasta with fresh clams.  Pasta was nice but the clams had a bitter and unattractive taste to them.  Second, the Mama Mia pizza that some other reviewers raved about.  The dough is not good - way too chewy.  Over server was over eager and aggressive.  I'm willing to come back to try something else on the menu as it is close and the wine list was interesting.",7,1,0,John O.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,984,44
4.0,1/20/2015,"Tasty food. Excellent service - servers will ask and deliver food and drinks even though you may not be in their ""area"".  Ordered veal Milanese - excellent. Not greasy. Crunchy. For a spicy palette you may want to speak to the manager to make sure you get what you want. Like dry hot peppers from Italy, etc. will come again.",0,1,0,Robert E.,"Boca Raton, FL",12,3,0
5.0,1/18/2015,"From the call to make the reservation through paying the check, this was an awesome meal and an overall great dining experience!  The staff are utmost professionals, attentive and very nice.  And the food, oh mama mia, the food!!!  We had a variety of apps and entrees which we all thoroughly enjoyed including Chef's signature dish Veal Milanese and did not disappoint.  The prices are decent for this area and the portions are satisfying.  Our party of four promised to go back even though three of us live outside of NY and are food snobs.  It is miraculous to ever get consensus among us about food but this place did it.  They knocked it out of the park!  Thanks to our awesome waiter Isaac and MDV!",1,0,0,Darla C.,"Montclair, NJ",0,25,1

They've only been open about 3 weeks, and the place was packed! It is much more an Italian restaurant than just a wine bar, and we loved everything about it! Reasonably priced, as well.

5.0,12/29/2014,"My wife and I had dinner there last Saturday night. I was told by the concierge at the Marriott Marquis that the restaurant had only been open for a week but was another restaurant from the better known La Masseria.From the time we walked through the door the evening was special. First, the decor is clean and modern, which we both like. We were able to get a table at the front of the restaurant which was set off by itself (unlike many restaurants where you sit elbow to elbow with strangers). The staff was outstanding. From the greeting at the entrance through the entire service. Tomasso and his team, and there was a team, was there when necessary, but otherwise, allowed my wife and I to enjoy the evening.Unable to select a moderately priced wine, I asked Tomasso for his recommendation. Ultimately, we ended up with a nice Sangiovese that was on the 2014 Wine Spectator top 100....what a choice at $38!OK, lets get to the food. The starters of the home made mozzarella and tomato, and my carpaccio were good, The entree's were, in our opinion, outstanding. My wife enjoyed the risotto of the night which was shrimp and saffron. My ravioli of veal with a mushroom sauce was tasty, leaving me wanting more. The evening ended with a great desert, cappuccino and limoncello on the house which really was a nice end to an enjoyable visit to NY.",2,1,0,Kevin C.,"Westford, MA",0,3,0
4.0,12/28/2014,Wonderful meal and impeccable service!  You would never know they had not been open very long.  Accommodated my motley family crew and their various dining needs.  90 year old grandma and 11 year old foodie devoured the shrimp and artichoke ravioli.  They kept my wine glass full!

5.0,12/20/2014,"Had a great meal at this new Italian spot.  The service was awesome.  To start with, the bread basket has a great assortment of breads and breadsticks. I'm a sucker for great breadsticks. We had a mozzarella and tomato appetizer which was creamy and delicious. I had the risotto of the day, a salmon risotto, and it was excellent.  Excellent is actually not adequate enough.. it was so good that I was in heaven every single bite.  The deserts... Omg!  The ricotta cheesecake was awesome and the specialty cake was also delicious. I plan on going back soon! A gem in the neighborhood.",6,0,5,Ryan H.,"New York, NY",264,14,26
