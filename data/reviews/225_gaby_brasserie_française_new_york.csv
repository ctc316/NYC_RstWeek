3.0,1/12/2019,"Regretfully, the three stars for this hotel restaurant are apparently apropos.  The weekend brunch menu seemed appealing and with ten or so tables occupied, I thought I'd give it a chance.  But as others have noted, the meal was comparatively banal and the service sluggish.  If you're not in the mood for uninspired and greasy, you'd do well to avoid the croque madam.  Sigh.  I should know better.  Always check the Yelp reviews first...",0,0,0,Tony A.,"Alameda, CA",0,15,1
1.0,12/25/2018,"I don't even know where to begin.....We were in NYC for Christmas and wanted to have a nice dinner. We were specifically looking for a French restaurant with duck on the menu. After reviewing many options I called Gaby Brasserie to inquire if they were serving a prix fixe menu or their normal menu. A gentleman on the phone confirmed they would have both options so I booked a reservation. Upon arriving at the restaurant we were promptly greeted and seated and presented with a prix fixe menu. I asked for a regular menu and was told prix fixe was all that was available tonight...there was no duck on the prix fixe menu!!  We should have left then but were all hungry and didn't want to hassle with finding somewhere else on Christmas night.  The 3 course prix fixe menu was pretty basic with choice of either a soup or salad, an entree, and desert. Choices were limited with a single soup (lobster bisque), single salad (caesar), 3 entree options (filet mignon, chicken, salmon), and 2 desert options (cheesecake and cream brulee). It also included a champagne toast. The lobster bisque was bland and contained very little meat. The 6 oz filet mignon was cooked well but hardly seasoned and the glaze lacked flavor.  The green beans that accompanied were over cooked and bland while the mashed potatoes were good. The cheesecake was ok. Honestly I've attended weddings with a better menu selection. It's also hard for me to reconcile the cost of $115 based on the quality and portions provided. Service and ambiance were seriously lacking. Our server was aloof and absent the majority of our meal. I didn't have an option to order a drink after the champagne toast until our entree was being served.  Our children's entree was served at the same time as our soup which left them finished and waiting on us to finish our entree once they arrived. To top it all off they were playing rap/hip-hop over the speakers which was odd and out of place. Worst of all...no duck for Christmas!!",1,0,0,Robert F.,"Flagler Beach, FL",1,18,0
5.0,12/16/2018,"We went here before Hamilton (!), and it was. Murphy's Law kind of night. Mix up on reservations, our fault, too late arrivals, and hitting it right before the theater rush. The service was outstanding, they were extremely attentive (and patient, thank you Tim) despite the theater rush, the food was quite good, the wine was great and the list was comprehensive. I'm not sure what the expectations are of the people who gave some of the crappy reviews, but based on my experience last night, they might want to try again. I was very happy, and so was the rest of the party, even though we had to race out of there before we finished dessert. I would like to go again another time :-)",1,1,1,Lisa P.,"New York, NY",5,79,1

During the restaurant week they switch the brunch menu to a one with a very limited choices, also they charge extra $20.00 per person for mimosa's. The spinach salmon salad did not have spinach in it. The usual eggs Benedict or steak and eggs were not available instead, we got grits with poached eggs, strips of fried chicken over waffles.

The confirmed my booking the day before and we walked in and we're seated immediately. This is a part of the Sofitel hotel so it was a mix of brunchers and hotel guests having breakfast. The space is very nice and we had several wonderful waiters tending to us! They kept the bloody Mary's (a little spicy but tasty and strong) and mimosas flowing for the entire time we were there. A nice breadbasket filled with yummy French breads (ask for the jam and they will bring a tower of French jams and honey). Included in our brunch was an app and an entree. We had:AppsMini bagel and lox (so good lots of luscious smoked salmon)Avocado toast w/smoked salmonFrench Onion SoupStrawberry Brie saladAll were amazing! Entrees 3 steak and eggs and I had a croque madame.  The steaks were thin ny strips but cooked perfectly. The croque madame was enormous and came with a basket of fries that were insanely yummy. Then we had French press coffee (one pot each!) and we were incredibly stuffed. It was a good value without the special. The staff was so professional I think they need mad props from management.

And I ordered ROASTED CAULIFLOWER PURÉE (Belgium endives, smoked arctic char roe, croutons) now that I think about it, I don't recall if there were croutons but it was delicious! Full of cauliflower flavor and the char roe made it even better.My fiancée had the shrimp & grits, which was delicious! His daughter and I had the brunch burger. We asked for rare burgers and the bacon jam made it full of flavor. We were amazed.As for dessert, fiancée had the sweet french today and we had the lava cake.

5.0,4/22/2018,"In the mood for brunch? In the mood for an authentic French brasserie? Well, then head to Gaby. Located in the luxurious Sofitel Hotel, Gaby can be reached through the hotel lobby, or via separate entrance on East 45th Street. No matter how you enter, you will be impressed. The decor is stunning, and the restaurant spacious. I frequent Gaby for brunch, but lunch and dinner are most likely an equally enjoyable experience. Gaby is also overlooked in one way; it is an excellent place for brunch or lunch before a Broadway matinee. The Theatre District is a short stroll away. My last time at Gaby was excellent. My friend and I came for brunch and both ordered the three course Brunch Prix-Fixe. It is also possible to order a la carte. It starts with a basket of delicious breads and pastries, including baguettes and croissants. For the appetizer, I had the bagel and lox. It was marvelous. The bagel, which was freshly baked, came with a generous serving of lox. It was served the way I like best, with cream cheese and tomato on the side. My friend had the avocado toast, which looked spectacular as well. I did not try it, but my friend was quite a fan. For the entree, I had the ""American Classic"". It was consisted of two eggs any way, bacon or sausage, and potatoes. I had it with eggs over easy and sausage, and it was just what I had been seeking. Perfect brunch. My friend had the eggs Benedict. Very good indeed.  The meal comes with coffee or tea. Get the coffee, which is out of this world. They make it in a French press, which does it best. You can also have unlimited brunch drinks, such as mimosa and Bloody Mary, throughout the meal, for an additional fee. Not only are the food and decor excellent, the service is too. Every waiter is extremely attentive and friendly. They truly made the brunch experience even more enjoyable. The hosts and hostesses are also friendly. We were seated at a window table overlooking 45th Street last time. The waiter David is especially friendly and always asks how I am. I strongly recommend you come to Gaby. It is truly a culinary star in New York, both in French cuisine and overall. It certainly disproves the old rule about hotel restaurants being sub-par. Whether you come for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or especially brunch, you will love it. I hope you enjoy Gaby as much as I always do!",0,0,0,Matthew A.,"New York, NY",1,17,19
1.0,3/21/2018,"Had a very unpleasant experience. Went for dinner prior to the show. The service was very slow. The waiter was annoyed with any question about the dish ( and we had couple very basic ones). French onion soup was pretty good, Caesar salad ok, octopus appetizer tasteless. When it came to main course duck was pretty good, salmon mediocre at best.... But when sea bass was brought out... There was a fishy smell coming from the fish.... A small bite confirmed our concerns... The fish was not fresh... Not just a different way of cooking the manager was trying to assure us later. When the 2 dishes were taken back by a bus boy who apologized and offered us to order something else, our waiter did not even bother to come up to the table and sent the check via another person. The answer was simple since the 20% gratuity was added automatically for party of 5.... When we decided to inform the manager about our experience she believed that the situation was handled properly since we were not charged for the spoiled dishes... And as I said before, suggested that different patrons have different tastes?!?... Really. Overall, overpriced tourist trap with presence on eclectic food and upscale service...

2.0,2/21/2018,"Was very hard to rate this place - 2.5 stars overall.Atmosphere: 3.5, cool vibe walking in.Service for waiter in the black shirt:  2 Service by the other beige uniformed guys and hostess: 4Food, for it's inconsistent showing, 2.5 starsHad high hopes for the restaurant week menu as they offered veal cheeks, scallops, chicken, and branzino!  And they offered some good  appetizers - Duck and Prosciutto salad, cauliflower puree, and house salad. Sadly, the descriptions didn't translate into the final dishes (and they were out of veal cheeks)!  The good: Diver Scallops entree (the scallops were seared to a nice caramel brown and just Al dente). Plating was presented well. And I enjoyed the Trifle dessert, aka bread pudding with boysenberries and cherries (just slightly too cold on the temperature side, like it was just out of the fridge, it should have been served room temp in my opinion). Great combo nonetheless.The decent: The Appetizer - Duck Prosciutto, the spinach was leafy and dark with a nice tang on the dressing. The duck slices while few, had a nice smokiness about them, just a tad too much fat.The bad: the mustard white wine chicken, too dry on the outside of the chicken, plating was sloppy, and the veggies were limp and over cooked. The risotto was too Al dente, which I believe should never be described as such. Like rice, it should never be hard/firm, it should be soft and palatable. This seemed undercooked to me. And the French toast dessert, burnt and had hard edges - it lacked flavor despite the powdered sugar on top.  The vanilla ice cream it was paired with tasted icy, rather than sweet - perhaps freezer burn?  But the glazed pears accompanied with it were very enjoyable. That was the only ingredient that tasted good from that dessert.Service was okay but unexpected  -- as I thought the ""waiter"" in the black shirts should've been doing the work. But it was not the case. I was better served by the Spanish gentleman in the beige uniform and the hostess. (Why was the hostess taking orders and serving food and checking on the kitchen?) I assume they were short staffed.Manager or someone in a fancy suit checked on us but I didn't have any complaints as we just got served, otherwise I probably would've told him a few things.

Sofitel is a ""luxury"" hotel and Gaby's is a pretty upscale breakfast location.  They venue had plenty of room I didn't feel like we were all crammed together.

My husband had eggs benedict (second time, both times he liked it) and the avocado toast (topped with a tartare) that was AMAZE.ING. The avocado toast appetizer on the brunch menu is a must-have. I ordered a spinach and goat cheese omelet and it was very good. Husband had bottomless mimosas for $20, which worked out to about $7/mimosa - good deal. The mimosas were delicious, I only had one but it was great and I'm not a big mimosa fan. It's a solid choice for brunch if you're staying at the Sofitel.

I didn't say anything because I didn't want to sounds like a picky eater. We ate our dinner and went to the show. Around 9pm I started to feel really nauseous, I waited till the show was over as much as I could. I ran to the bathroom and started throwing up A LOT. When we got home and I called Gaby's and the manager answered. I told him I had eaten there and had gotten sick from the octopus, he said it was too soon to have symptoms and that no one else had complained. I told him it was that because my husband was also feeling sick and it was the only food we shared. I told him so no one else would get sick. He wasn't very courteous about the situation.

2.0,8/19/2017,"I was in NYC for 3 nights last week and stayed at the Sofitel. Strictly business trip and really like the hotel. Gaby is a totally different story, however. First, I have been coming here for many years and have gone to Gaby primarily for breakfast meetings. Usually very good if you can stand the very high prices. This stay I was extremely disappointed in the food and service. Example, scrambled eggs looked like they'd been done without scrambling-- yes, I know. And arrived on my plate like a gob of dough and to make matters worse they were brown. The butter had browned so the eggs did as well. My client ordered the French Omelet - like note I've ever seen. Usually light and fluffy, thin wrap filled with gooey wonderful cheese. Not so this time. Again, a big brown blob of eggs, very think and unappealing. ELast, my colleague and I had been running all day so we decided to have a cocktail in the bar and grab dinner at Gaby. Restaurant Week in NYC so it seemed appropriate. Drinks exceptional. Marie the bartender is fantastic. Anyway, after drinks we headed to Gaby and were seated. The waiter finally came over, asked me if we wanted wine, etc. I noticed two different Pinot on the list and asked to taste both. He gave a brief description and I asked, since they were both French and not familiar to me, "" which one is heavier?""He replies, "" I told you...."" well I was a bit ticked at the attitude and ordered something different. We basically didn't see him the rest of the dinner service. The other help filled in. Very weird. And unprofessional.The food. We both ordered a corn soup Special and the 6oz filet.e"" The soup arrives about 15 minutes later-- cold. Again, no waitere . A manager comes over and asks how we like the soup. I say, ""fine"" but it would have been nice to have it explained on the menu. No mention it was cold. He says,"" sorry, your waiter was to tell you at time of order""-- well maybe if our waiter was present that would have happened. 20 minutes after soup the filets show up. Ok, 6oz isn't big but these looked smaller. They were tough, very chewy and had zero flavor. We both had 2 bites -- inedible. The problem was no one came to check on us. 15 min goes by and the same manager comes over and asks how we're doing. I told him the food was inedible. I asked if it was grass fed beef. He said, yes, and I asked why the menu didn't describe it that way. He had no explanation- was apologetic and offered to get us something else. At this point we thanked him ( he was gracious and pleasant) and decided we dint want new Mains. Got the bill and scooted.Next day at checkout I asked for them to remove the food portion of the bill. I explained and there was no issue. I really think it should have been handled by the restaurant not the front desk. I hope the management fix the food and service issues.

3.0,2/23/2017,"I attended my first Yelp Elite event here and I must admit I was initially hesitant because of the three and half star rating, but it's a new year so what the heck! I tried it. My overall restaurant experience was top notch from start to finish but the food itself was so-so. Upon arrival the hostess checked my coat and escorted me to the designated area for the event. I immediately approached the bar where the server greeted me and thoughtfully explained the various alcohol based offerings for the evening. He even took the time to tell the group about the Coravin used on the Chardonnay. It's a genius system that allows drinkers to enjoy a glass without having to down the bottle for fear of spoiling. Have to get one of those. It's amazing! Nonetheless, I digress... Before I knew it the food started to arrive. Each time a new course was introduced, the waiter provided a detailed description of the dish's ingredients and we were left to enjoy the chef's creations.The presentation of each of the 11 courses was incredible, but the freshness of some of the seafood was below par. I was particularly turned off by the cornmeal fried oysters and scallops which I couldn't finish because of the pungent taste. However, the fried brussell sprouts with green apple shavings, lamb chops over risotto, panko fried shrimp, and salmon were my favorites. This chef really knows how to pair a sauce/reduction and garnish with the appropriate meat or seafood.Was slightly disappointed that none of the courses included a dessert. Our menu ended with a traditional French style dried fruit and cheese plate. I will definitely use the Yelp elite discount to try a sweet treat.

I ordered the French Onion soup and my other half ordered the Blueberry Pancakes....Let's just say I am a connoisseur of French Onion soup for at least the last decade of my life....I was hoping by the great menu description that I had made the right choice....In my opinion the perfect bowl of french onion soup has a large portion of melted cheese to start with:-) Unfortunately after receiving my entree at the table without even tasting It I instantly knew I probably had made the wrong choice and after the first bite it cemented that thought....The soup course was lacking cheese, flavor and size....I can't say I would reccommend this dish to anyone but I will say that the blueberry pancakes tasted excellent with the real maple vermont syrup they serve them with.  To be honest I am not sure I would stop back by this restaurant when I am back in NYC but it wasn't a disaster..it just wasn't solid...In my opinion you would think the restaurant in the bottom of the Sofitel would be on point and unfortunately this place wasn't.",0,0,0,Shawn M.,"Atlanta, GA",160,345,58

As a result I've had about half the menu and don't get any criticisms you'd find - it's modern American meets French fare and while it isn't cheap, it isn't exactly expensive by American standards. Furthermore the food and service are great (if you can ever work with Leo, he's the absolute best in the business, and I say this having eaten at an alarming amount of hotel restaurants let alone restaurants) - really, even in a crowded night things are swiftly delivered. there's something to be said for the quality of the food too. The filet mignon is borderline sous vide perfect yet pan fried, the lobster fresh and tasty, and the wine/cocktail selection and delivery fantastic. It's a shame that apparently doing the classics properly is enough to make Yelpers mad.

When I got there, I was so excited to see that they even had ""De-Light"" cocktails as well!  I ordered the Roland Garros (60 calories and $9), which was made with basil infusion, cucumber, fresh apple, lime juice, and Perrier. It was very refreshing - definitely a good summer drink although I still enjoyed it on this 2-degree day.For my meal, I ordered the poached cod (231 calories and $29) off the De-Light menu.  It was quite tasty, although small. I'm not sure if it was small because it was on the De-Light menu, or if all of the restaurant servings are small. My sister also ordered off the De-Light menu, but she ordered the duck (270 cal and $30). It was super tasty and came with a yummy bulgar.  The staff was very attentive - almost TOO attentive. I felt like we had three waiters because the water guy, our actual waiter, and sometimes the hostess would clear our plates or ask us if we needed anything. We were asked by two different people if we wanted dessert (no), and then a third person brought us a dessert menu. A similar thing happened with drinks. I don't really feel like this is a complaint because they were certainly looking out for us, but it did get a little confusing. Since this is in a hotel, getting to the bathroom was an experience.  I had to leave the restaurant, go into the lobby, get in an elevator down to the basement, walk by the fitness center and around the corner into the bathroom.

Even after tipping them (yes, at a work event) they still would only have one tray at a time...of one item....The bar is really pretty, it's huge and marble. I cannot comment on prices, but I glanced at a few menus and it seems a bit inflated...though not totally out of the realm of Manhattan or a high-end hotel. I probably wouldn't choose here to eat out of my own accord, but it was fairly crowded with diners both times I was here.However, following both receptions, we visited Point Break both before and after for beer pong and cheap bar food. Ahh, the joys of being a recent college grad.Or not so recent, in some cases. But some things never change.",0,0,0,Chrissy C.,"Jersey City, NJ",335,405,17
2.0,1/19/2011,"Making the review short.. Ok and pricey!We had a friend out of town visiting and were going to Rockefeller and end up passing by this place and looked nice so we thought it would be a great place for Brunch. End up a ok eggs bennie and nothing special and Pricey. Not sure if we didn't order their special but I don't recommend .. too expensive and nothing special. What I love about Ny is that we have so many options expensive and inexpensive. I don't see the reason to pay more if is worst than simple inexpensive places.. this is one of them in my opinion that is! =)Love Clinton St bakery , Norma's breakfast /brunch much better!",1,0,0,Suzana U.,"New York, NY",12,176,475
3.0,5/12/2010,"I was not expecting a tremendous amount, but was still let down somewhat.The food choices here are inscrutable -- food bearing little resemblance to its descriptions on the menu.Tapenade accompanying the bread is always a good start in my book, but the markups on the wine list set that in the wrong direction.The goat cheese salad was a ball of goat cheese in a philo dough purse accompanying a big, thinly sliced piece of cucumber, spindled and stood upright.  Decent tasting, if perplexing.The main -- a seafood risotto -- was simply not a seafood risotto.  It was a medium-ish grilled cod fillet sitting on top of some chewy long-grain rice (basmati, maybe) -- not caranoli or arborio, and no way shape or form with the mouth-feel of a conventional risotto.  It wasn't bad for what it was, but it was not what I expected or felt that I had ordered.",2,0,1,Matthew D.,"Scarsdale, NY",4,339,0
2.0,12/9/2009,went there for lunch nothing to brag about the service really needs some work it took them over 1 hour and 15 minutes to bring us or food but I had to get back to work so i was forced to take my lunch in a boxI went there based on other review ratings but i was sadly disappointed.I wont be going back there again the food was ok again nothing to brag aboutRegardless of how good food is at a restaurant if the service is so poor you wont be able to enjoy your meal because you are so annoyed with the service always looking for your waiter oh and finally its way over priced for what you get,1,0,0,Sam F.,"Nassau, NY",3,103,6
4.0,11/25/2009,"Went for a business lunch last week. It was noon, and we were the first table to be seated at the main dining area. The decor was very nice. Something like the room in rich people's houses that nobody ever uses. The food was very good. I had the crab cakes, which were good, and the aioli was very good. Monkfish was cooked well. Definitely a great meal. A little pricey for lunch, but who cares I didn't pay.",0,0,0,Wes D.,"Manhattan, NY",5,49,1
3.0,7/30/2009,"My coworkers and I stopped by here for a few drinks after I read on Yelp that it's a hotel bar.  Well, it's really more of a restaurant.  But it wasn't crowded at all, and they were actually accommodating when we sat down in the dining room and said we'd like to do drinks-only.  They even brought over the bar food menu for us.We had a few drinks; they have a good by-the-glass wine selection.  We also tried some bar food, which was halfway decent.  The normal menu looked interesting.  Overall the prices are on the high end, and it's probably a better place to grab a drink or two with a small group.",1,0,1,Deborah H.,"Boston, MA",246,720,0
4.0,6/24/2008,"I hope you have a corporate card, because Gaby's is not cheap.  On the plus side, they have a pretty decent selection of wines by the glass, it's usually not too busy (except weeknight evenings as the big- and little-wigs of MMC traipse over from across the street).  Try the cheese plate and don't forget to ask for the olive tapenade that comes with the bread basket.",1,0,0,Alison M.,"Paramus, NJ",165,125,1
4.0,11/29/2007,"Came here for a drink w/a coworker who was staying here.   Cute hotel bar.  Service was great and the wine was superb.  I had one of the white wine flights and my coworker had a red wine flight.  The bartenders give you a lot considering we ordered flights.  Olives and little cheese breadsticks/cookie type things are complimentary.  Great thing is it's not too loud in here, unlike most bars, so you can have a good conversation without screaming.",3,0,3,Michelle H.,"New York, NY",191,497,6
4.0,9/20/2007,"Yeah - hotel restaurant. However, my monkfish was delicious! I was here on a business lunch so I couldn't enjoy myself as thoroughly as I might normally (i.e. no alcohol and I couldn't attack the breadbasket in the usual fashion). I ordered the monkfish with porcini mushrooms in butter sauce. It was very yummy! Also there was a table full of really good looking men behind me having some sort of business lunch as well. I purposely sat myself in the seat with my back to them though because I didn't want to be distracted. That was a pity too. I can't believe I've reached that kind of maturity level as well. I actually voluntarily chose to focus on my business meeting rather than stare at hot men for an hour. Gold star!",4,6,5,Tina M.,"Brooklyn, NY",53,73,0
5.0,7/12/2007,"Having ordered a steak that came with an unappetizing side, I asked my waiter to exchange the pommes frites for something that sounded better.The waiter, horrified, quickly clarified: ""The pommes frites are not french fries! They are more than that. Believe me, you will not be sorry."" We smiled at each other. And he was right, I wasn't sorry.Later that night, having noticed I hardly touched my creme brulee, he asked for the opportunity to bring me another dessert.I love myself some Gaby.",3,1,3,Angela N.,"Paris, France",108,291,7
4.0,4/30/2007,"We stayed in the Sofitel and this was our breakfast experience both mornings.  The wait staff was very polite, and the food was spectacular.I had both the Salmon benedict and the Gaby Omelette, both of which were cooked perfectly.I might not go out of my way to head there, as the price of the food was a little high, but if you stay there, I firmly recommend it.",1,1,0,Jeff L.,"Seattle, WA",74,94,0
4.0,12/9/2006,"Underneath the Sofitel, this is definitely a hotel restaurant.  But I must admit I do like hotel bars and restaurants sometimes.  The bar area is pleasant and not crowded.  The windows of the restaurant are floor to ceiling and open out to the sidewalk.The food was very good, although the tables by the wall were a little wide. Nice for space, but man the person sitting across from you felt like they were a mile away.  I'd get a middle of the floor table next time.Overall not bad for a quick bite in midtown, and not too far from Grand Central or Times Square either.",1,0,2,David S.,"Cupertino, CA",16,37,0
