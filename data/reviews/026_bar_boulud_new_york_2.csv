1.0,4/27/2019,"We had made a reservation several weeks in advance.  We asked for a booth and indicated that it was our anniversary.  The restaurant called to confirm and we reiterated our request.  We arrived  a few minutes early and were taken to a table in the back on a banquette accommodating 6 tables and right next to a large noisy party.  We asked why, when we had a reservation and there were parties of two seated in the booths and there were empty booths, we were seated at this unacceptable table.  She replied that those people had been seated earlier.  We were not late and we had a reservation - how is that acceptable?   We left and went to Fiorello's where we were treated graciously, even without a reservation.",0,0,0,Joan T.,"Miami, FL",4,9,1

We were dining pre-theatre and they got us in an out quickly without feeling rushed. Service was definitely top notch. The only two things I was disappointed with: wine list was expensive with few moderately priced options, and they forgot that we had a birthday at the table, despite having asked the bday person's name even when reconfirming.",0,0,0,Justin H.,"Boston, MA",0,2,0
4.0,3/6/2019,"Came here for restaurant week and it was well worth it. The portions were pretty big and they gave us enough fries to feed two families. I ordered the pate and burger and my friend ordered the mussels. The burger was good but nothing too fantastic. The pate was creamy and paired well with the bread, there was just so much of it! It wasn't melt in your mouth and not the best I've tasted but still top notch. I'm not a fan of mussels but it came in a huge pot. The curry was all at the bottom so it didn't coat majority of the mussels and you had to dig your way through to see it. Overall cute place and close to Central Park. Would go here to catch up with friends or on a date that's not too fancy but not super casual either.",0,0,1,Jasmine C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9,60,29
5.0,2/25/2019,"Fantastic. Had a really great experience here. I ate with my Dad a few nights ago and we both really enjoyed the night!We started with the large charcuterie with six different pates (all of which were fantastic - our favorite being the headcheese and the duck), some ham, pickled veggies, and delicious sourdough bread. This was honest to god the best pate spread I've ever had!I got the Faroe Island salmon cooked medium rare and it was honestly probably the best salmon I've ever had. The skin was really crispy and the meat was super flavorful and perfectly cooked. On top of the bed of lentils made for a GREAT dish.My dad had the cassoulet (made by a visiting chef I believe) which was exquisite and perfectly seasoned. The textures and flavors were excellent.For dessert got the gateau basque (almond custard cake) and I thought it was a lovely end to a great meal. Great time and definitely will be coming back!",0,0,0,Thomas E.,"Manhattan, NY",294,259,228
2.0,2/16/2019,"We came for dinner because of an event at Lincoln Center. Unfortunately it was Valentine's Day so they only offered an $85 prefix menu. Mostly everything about the food was underwhelming. The chicken in the coq au vin was good quality but the skin was totally soggy and the dish only had two shallots and two mushrooms to it total and the ramekin of side spaetzle was only half full. We also ordered the artichoke risotto which is described as: crispy Artichoke, parmesan, jus gras, scallion. There was no scallion, the artichoke was not peeled correctly so we had multiple inedible parts to pick through, and the rice itself was overcooked to the consistency of soup. It was pretty disgusting. We started with the Pâté de Canard which was pretty good, but was it actually duck? Debatable. The oysters were good (earned the second star on this review).

Unfortunately, they were out of the lobster omelette, so I got an herb omelette and my son got the quiche Lorraine.  Both out of this world. The potatoes melted in my mouth and the hash browns were perfectly cooked inside and out.   The service was very attentive and always on top of refilling water and coffee.

3.0,2/8/2019,"Boulud, from the famed Daniel Boulud. There are many locations, and because of this, it showed. There wasn't anything extraordinary about this place that stood out, but I really can't remember anything 'bad' either. So I'd say this place is average. In a city with many great restaurants to pick from, I probably wouldn't crave to come here again. In hindsight, I should have known better than to take a recommendation from a man sitting at a shared table with my co-workers and I, trying to make small talk with us (eventhough he was pleasant).",1,1,1,Jeanette I.,"Torrance, CA",83,97,40
1.0,2/6/2019,"I'm absolutely disgusted by my first (and last) experience with this restaurant... I took my step-mother out, this afternoon, to see Peter Jackson's documentary on WW1; and she suggested we go to Bar Boulud, afterwards, for lunch. Reluctantly, I agreed. So, we placed our orders, and sat there for thirty minutes waiting for the food to arrive -- in spite of the place being literally empty. The food finally came to us (warm, not hot). And it really wasn't that good. Finally, our server brought the bill, and overcharged us by more than 30 dollars (which I didn't realize until I had already walked ten blocks away from the place). So, after enduring terrible service and eating mediocre food, I had to walk ten blocks back to the place to get them to correct their gross mistake in the bill.If I had gone to some slop-slinging Greek diner... the food would have been just about the same (seriously), and the service would have been TREMENDOUSLY better.

4.0,1/17/2019,"Hubby and I got the 3-course Pre-Theater special, to have more options as our first time here; And I, in a French restaurant. Started with the complimentary bread slices, which went well with the butter (or maybe I was just already hungry). For starters, the Winter Salad was light but with good flavor; While the Chicken Liver Mousse was airy-buttery on toast... I love that it didn't have the overpowering liver taste, yet you know that it's liver. I even ate it with the remaining comp bread slices -it's that good, specially with the Compote! For Main, Hubby got it good with the Cassoulet... a lot of complementing flavors from the Duck, Pork Belly and Beans; Filling too because of the good serving size. My Quenelle Brochet wasn't though; I guess it's Fish made into mousse... good flavor with the Sauce, and felt like a lighter hard-boiled egg white; It didn't come with any carbs, therefore just felt like a 'tizer. Desserts were great to clean the after-dinner palate; Hubby enjoyed the Assiette de Fromages (Cheese plate, with grapes, and sweet bread), and I, the Opera Gateau.",0,0,0,Cheche A.,"Woodside, NY",20,1,10

3.0,1/2/2019,"We came here on a whim before seeing a matinee show at Lincoln Center. I know that any restaurant by a touristy location, such as Lincoln Center, is going to have inflated prices, but, for example, $6 for a regular coffee seemed excessive. I also got the waffle, which was good, but neither the small portion size nor the taste was so amazing that I felt it was worth $17 plus tax and tip.All that said, the hostess and waitress were very pleasant, and our food came out quickly.

1.0,11/18/2018,"I'm not one to write reviews on Yelp as I usually use it to find good places to try. However after an awful dining experience at Bar Boulud I find myself compelled to leave one. My husband and I live in the neighborhood and found ourselves craving French food this weekend, we usually go to Cafe Luxembourg in the neighborhood on these occasions but decided to give Bar Boulud a try. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a friendly hostess and given a table at the back of the restaurant (which is huge - if you want cozy/ romantic this is not the place). We were then greeted by our waiter who was unfortunately extremely rude, had an air of superiority and was over bearing throughout the whole meal. We asked for recommendations on what to have on the menu and he said ""he didn't do that"", also when asked for wine recommendations his response was ""are you asking me to pick your wine"". Overall a painful experience with a server who was truly one of the worst I've ever encountered and clearly did not want to be there.On to the food, we had the charcuterie board to share which was actually pretty good and I enjoyed, slightly overpriced in my opinion. For the main course we had the dry aged NY strip which I asked for medium/rare and the boudin blanc. I've had dry aged strip before and 1) the steak didn't not taste like dry aged strip and 2) is was over cooked and no where near the medium rare which I ordered. Unfortunately I did not want to have a confrontation with the rude waiter so I paid $45 for a steak which I would never recommend to anyone and was over completely overcooked. I will say that the boudin blanc was delicious and I clearly made a poor decision (no input from the waiter) on the steak. We didn't want to stay in the restaurant any longer or have to deal with the rude waiter anymore so we paid for the over cooked steak, cocktails and wine and left straight after dinner.",0,0,0,Sarah G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0

I will note that we had a reservation but there was still a wait to sit outside, the hostess told us we would have to put our name on another list. Not sure if it's something you can and should specify over the phone but we didn't realize it was an option. We sat inside, the dining area has a large eye catching curved ceiling.

5.0,9/8/2018,"After another stellar experience, I could not help but feel like leaving another review.  My parents were in town this weekend, and I had the hardest time thinking of someplace to bring them to, on their last night in town.  They are traditional in their Vietnamese ways, and they are quite picky when it comes to eating out.  They will often go to places and say, ""oh it is just x, y, and z - it's not that hard, etc.""  So I listened to my instinct and decided to take them to a place that my guy and I have enjoyed numerous times (as evidenced by my last review here).  I figured ""why try to impress them with anything complicated?  If I like what I like, then it should work for them too...maybe."" Turns out, Bar Boulud was the perfect place to take my parents!  I think besides the food, which I already knew would be delicious, I was most impressed by the service this visit.  The whole staff from the hostess to the servers and the somm were great.  But our waiter Marko was really quite fantastic.  He gave us the patience for me to explain and translate the menu to my parents.  He knew to come around when we were ready to order.  He then patiently elaborated on one of the menu items, in case we were expecting something other than what the menu indicated (without our prompting, but still really appreciated because my parents were expecting something what I thought the menu said).  My parents even remarked on the service, as well as the food!  WIN!I did not yet take a chance to meet the Manager of Guest Services, but I am so so glad that I continue to love this place, every time I come.  My guy and I will continue to give our money to this place of establishment, every time we have a need for amazing food around Lincoln Center!",0,0,0,Helene T.,"Manhattan, NY",125,27,3

Unfortunately when I got my dish I felt the same way. There was a ton of liquid at the bottom of the dish. Not sure why But it was tasteless and unappealing. The vegetables in the dish or relatively flavorless as well. The salad that preceded the main dish was an ordinary salad you get in a Diner.

We shared a bistro salad, lightly dressed with feta and an olive tapenade.    There were two small tomato halves on the plate as well, wish there had been a few more.For my main, I ordered the grilled sea bass.  It was delicious!  Prepared with a ratatouille base and what I believe were small squares of polenta.  The fish was perfectly broiled and exactly partnered with the vegetables.My daughter ordered the ""Frenchie"" burger, rare.  The burger came with a generous serving of fantastic french fries.  It was topped with pork belly and a fat slice of raclette cheese.  It was rich and decadent and very delicious.  With all of our sharing, we still didn't finish the burger.For dessert we shared a chocolate ""cake"" which was plated in the shape of a twix bar (with the taste of a flourless torte).  It was dressed with exceptional whipped cream and what tasted like frozen yogurt in chocolate crumbles.We so enjoyed out time at Bar Boulud.  Restaurant week provided us a wonderful opportunity to dine in a certain kind of casual elegance that we otherwise, would not!",0,0,0,Kerrie D.,"Portland, ME",277,483,1015

4.0,7/3/2018,"Excellent French bistro with great food, a solid wine selection, and a casual, relaxed ambiance.  It's literally across the street from the Met Opera/Lincoln Center so it's a great place to grab a pre- or post-show bite.  We came for a late dinner after catching an ABT performance at 9:30 pm and were seated right away in a comfortable booth.  It's a popular venue for those seeing a performance and it was still pretty busy even at 10 pm!  They also offer patio seating.Some food highlights:1. Lyonnaise salad: Perfectly poached egg over dressed frisee, sliver of chicken liver and thick-cut lardons.  The tart vinaigrette was a good foil for the smoky lardons.2.  Nicoise: Solid version of the classic with seared yellowfin tuna, anchovy, olives, half an egg, tomatoes, and haricots verts, tossed in a creamy aioli.  The haricots verts were cooked perfectly - which is actually a challenging feat - many places will serve almost raw which I absolutely hate.3. Canard a la cerise: Excellent cherry glazed duck breast served medium rare with a crispy skin and flavorful, juicy interior.  It is served with a side of quinoa with pistachio pieces and sauteed onions, radishes, and duck jus.  This is a must-try!4. Boudin Basque: Solid blood sausage served with a celery root purée and glazed, roasted apples.  The sausage was flavorful and paired well with the apples.Our food was also preceded with a set of Gougeres which were great: light and fluffy with perfect balance of bread & gruyere topping.  The bread basket was also solid but a pretty standard version.Service was very good - attentive but not overbearing.Definitely worth a visit if you are by the Lincoln Center!",3,1,3,Danan R.,"New York, NY",924,1915,85

We were here for lunch.  We were greeted by a lovely Hostess who took us directly to our table in the back of the restaurant. The restaurant was beautiful. It looked like a wine tunnel with gorgeous lighting. They offered a prefix lunch. If you ordered two courses it was $28. With three courses it was $36. So we ordered the two courses which was a gorgeous salad and a piece of sea bass. It had wonderful presentation and it was delicious. Afterwards we ordered a fruit platter to be shared but it wasn't on the prefix menu. If we had known, we would have ordered the three courses because that little small platter of fruit was $14 which definitely wasn't worth it. There were a few grapes, and sour blackberries, a handful of blueberries, a couple of strawberries which were all cut in half to make them look like a lot on the plate. Very disappointing. Our coffees were included. So lunch was $85 per couple. However our service was excellent.

2.0,4/25/2018,"Pretty disappointing from the moment we walked in.  We decided to come early to have a drink at the bar prior to our 8PM reservation.  The bartender (younger white guy) was pretty off-putting in how he spoke to us.  My date asked for a martini and while I understand this restaurant focuses on wine I was really in the mood for a tequila on the rocks (and planned to save wine for dinner).  When I asked him what kind of tequila they had he looked at me like I had a third eye and quickly went over the short list of tequila as though I was wasting his time.  At 7:45 a hostess came over to us and said there is a table available now if we are ready.  She posed it as a question but it was clear she wanted us to sit down right then and there.  We were not yet done with our charcuterie and cheese plate and honestly didn't feel like moving yet.  However, she stood there with menus in hand and was waiting for us to get up.  We asked if we could bring over our dish for which she seemed bewildered that we would even ask.  She responded with, ""Yes..that should be fine"" and then looked at the bartender for help on moving our dish.  Just felt awkward.  The entire service when we sat down at dinner made us feel rushed.  It also felt very in-personal.  The waiter spoke to us very quickly and didn't really seem like he cared if we were enjoying our experience.  It felt more like he just wanted to flip the table for the next party.  The food itself was very good however I would not come back just based off the service.  Its unfortunate as I had very high hopes for this spot.",1,0,0,Andrew F.,"New York, NY",3,200,0

The city that allegely never sleeps!). The waiters were very friendly, professional and accomodating. However, the manager was NOT at all friendly, and was somewhat abrupt to the staff who took our orders. He denied the waiter to take certain orders and to recommend only the basic items. It was obvious that we were not welcome by the manager and truly showed that he wanted us out ASAP. We did order the ""Charcuterie"" which was excellent. I ordered the Boudin Blanc but appeared to be over cook (possible left over from a surplus since it came to me almost instantly). The wine selection offered is quite excellent for this type of restaurant. Overall impression was, good food that could/may have been excellent if given the time to prepare and for the clients to enjoy it. If they were so much in a hurry to close early, because of lack of clients (the only ones beside us, was a young couple at the bar that left after hearing the manager's remarks to the waiters with respect to our request/order...), then they shoud have refused us ""politely"" upon our entrance and we would have understood.

5.0,3/12/2018,"Daniel Boulud is an extraordinary chef renowned the world over.  He has appeared in countless television shows throughout his career that undoubtedly many food aficionados know him by name.  This larger-than-life French chef has made a name for himself in the culinary world and I was excited to try one of his iterations in NYC.  I must admit that from the very first time I had known about Chef Boulud from the early seasons of Top Chef, I wanted to dine at one of his restaurants.  Fortunately, that desire has come to fruition in the form of Bar Boulud.  I hope that you will indulge me in describing my culinary experience there.Having made an early dinner reservation, I walked into the restaurant when service was yet busy.  Immediately, I noticed the cavernous design which is reminiscent of a subway tunnel.  The warm glow of the brown color scheme is complimented by the generous use of wood furniture.  I guess the intent is to make the guest feel right at home yet transport them to a more elegant setting as if dining at a café in Paris.Moving on to the food at hand, the evening for me began with the pate grand-mere.  A beautifully done pate consisting of chicken liver and pork along with cognac was meant to be spread onto two slices of rye bread.  The fatty, umami taste of the pate really was the perfect opening to the concerto that followed.  Entrée came in the form of braised beef bourguignon.  A beef dish that had been stewing in red wine to achieve a level of tenderness that was simply divine, and later joined by root vegetables and mushroom to add some culinary harmony. It was filling, yet not heavy--dare I say it tasted like what grandmas would cook in quaint French villages.  As for dessert, the server's recommendation was the citron pavlova. This light, airy concoction of lemon curd, torched meringue, and pistachio chantilly ended the meal with no encore required.Coupled with the service, my first visit at Bar Boulud was a wonder gastronomic experience.  It's certainly not an every day restaurant to visit, but for those rare moments when the need to indulge oneself hits, a visit to Chef Daniel Boulud's restaurant is certainly worth a thought.",8,1,6,Dexter V.,"Santa Rosa, CA",825,537,4286

I rolled out hours later stuffed to the brim with pâté, so all in all not a bad state of being on a Wednesday night. Since pâté was the mission of the day, we went with the large charcuterie plate, fries, and wine. The wine list by glass isn't extensive, but the sommelier was approachable and enthusiastic, and the Julie Benau Picpoul de Pinet he recommended was very nice - dry and crisp, with apple. While we're on this topic - when you go downstairs to the bathroom, enjoy the wine cellars on the way - very cool. Despite my usual preference of ham for charcuterie plates, the array of pâté offered was dazzling. Aspic is featured heavily in the pâté here, and it added a very interesting texture that I quite enjoyed, though I still favor the smoother country styles. To my surprise, despite how much I love duck and foie gras, the standouts for me were the more traditional styles: the pâté de campagne (pork jowl), pâté grand-mere (chicken liver), and the lamb tajin terrine (lamb, but also had chunks of sweet potato). The fries reminded me of McDonald's fries in the nicest way possible (lol). One slight hiccup of the evening was the complimentary cheese bread delivered at the start; my friend doesn't eat cheese and I limit my dairy intake due to intolerance so it was weird that they asked about our dietary restrictions after that was served.

They have a large outdoor space as well which I believe does not take reservations, so walk-ups have a good chance at landing seating. That all said, the service (mostly speed) can occasionally be inconsistent. Sometimes the kitchen just gets slammed and communication back to the tables is non-existent about the delays. In the end, staff does the right thing in terms of apologizing for extensive delays and buying a round of drinks, but the occasional frustration could be appeased with better communication.

3.0,7/23/2017,"Decent French restaurant with average prices. Around 30 for an entree. Escargot was between mediocre and good. Tarte flambee was a boring looking flat bread but had awesome flavor. I had the leg of lamb. The flavor was really really good but the cook of the lamb was a little overdone for my taste. We all shared our entrees and the duck breast was awesome. Again the cook of the duck was a little more rare than I usually like. The loup de mer was branzino and it was delicious. I think the star savory dish was surprisingly the grain salad. It was filled with grilled squash, zucchini, 3 different kinds of tomatoes and the creamiest cheese (I think it was burrata or mozzarella or something) you could ever wish for. The grain itself was maybe farro?? Doesn't matter, it was just good.Finally the dessert. They unfortunately didn't have the chocolate souffle, but I got the Opera Coupe. It was basically a chocolate coffee ganache with like a chocolate crumble and whipped cream and espresso ice cream. A lot of small elements that brought the whole thing together. It was like an upscale ""dirt"" chocolate pudding that everyone used to make as kids (you know where you crushed the Oreos and added little gummy worms?). Really nostalgic.

2.0,7/2/2017,"A bit torn here given a previous experience that was very pleasant and we really enjoy other Boulud venues, but our last visit was mixed to say the least.  Stopped by for a casual early dinner before a jazz set.  On a warm summer day, the air conditioning was struggling to keep up, and staff were fanning themselves and speaking of the warmness to the manager.  Otherwise the space is cozy and inviting, and includes outdoor seating for nicer days.In terms of food, we shared:- Lyonnaise Salad ($19):  Decent flavors, but the chicken liver was a tad aggressive, more than I was expecting.  Make sure you like liver if you order this salad, it has larger pieces.- Potato Gnocchi with Chanterelles and Sweet Corn ($26):  Quite disappointed at this dish, which turned out to be served in basically a creamed corn style sauce that was overly sweet.  The Gnocchi were unfortunately very heavy, not at all light and airy as expected, particularly for a summer dish.  What really did this dish in was the overall sweetness, it seemed even beyond the corn some additional sugar was added.  Very strange, as I previously enjoyed the pasta here.- Frenchie Burger ($23):  Still excellent, it is very decadent with pork belly confit, roasted tomato compote and raclette cheese, served with a large portion of frites.  Cooked to perfection and very moist.  I think this is one of the better burgers in the city and recommend giving it a try.Would have changed our salad and pasta if ordering again, as we found this combination of dishes particularly heavy, especially the gnocchi.  Our waitress was of little help in offering suggestions about what we selected.  In fact, she constantly tried up-selling, for example trying to push ordering two appetizer courses of the Gnocchi ($32) versus sharing one main course of the same dish ($26).  We also got a long-winded sales pitch on rose served from a magnum on special ($20/gl) versus the menu's regular rose ($12/gl).  Pretty annoying.Overall, the concept is great and the space is nice, we have had a nice time here before...but our last experience has left me a bit more hesitant.  Might be a while before we give this one another go.",0,0,1,D.

3.0,6/27/2017,"The food is very good, close to excellent. Good enough that I'd probably try it again, and hope that we had an off night in terms of the service. The main problem was the speed (or rather slowness) of service -- after taking our initial drink orders, we kept waiting and waiting to place our food order, which didn't happen until 40 minutes into our seating -- a pretty major problem given that we were all opera/theater-bound, and causing us to have to positively gobble the food down when it finally started coming. In the midst of the wait too order food, we also waited a ridiculously long time for the bottle of wine we ordered. When the sommelier finally brought the wine, she showed it to us -- and then disappeared from the table for another 5-10 minutes. I finally saw her at the back counter opening the wine, pouring herself a full ounce or more, tasting it, and then eventually bringing to us. I have *never* had a sommelier open and taste the wine that I'd ordered out of sight from the table, and certainly not a glass of that size. I was too nonplussed to say anything, but for what we paid for that bottle of wine, we'd just given the sommelier a $5 tasting. (We didn't even particularly like the wine and were unhappy that they would list a sweet dessert-wine Vouvray on the menu without noting it as such. Having had and enjoyed many dry Vouvrays, that's what I was expecting. In general, the wine list is very French-leaning and rather overpriced...) At that point, we asked again about ordering our meal, and she left, then finally came back and took our order herself. I don't know what had happened to our waiter, though he did come around later.

The space is rather open, and even though the restaurant was pretty full, it was not loud. However, there is construction going on outside and so everything is marred by the scaffolding.They do have some generic brunch options that are just eggs and carbs, but they have far more of a lunch menu with their traditional Mediterranean fare.The trout roe dip was delicious with the dill potato chips, and they brought more chips when we ran out. The lamb burger I had was absolutely delicious and certainly something I would recommend.

Meanwhile, my guest had been seated at arguably the worst table in the place (the 2-top at the top of the stairs in the back, by the busing station at the end of the bar). Seriously? In an empty restaurant? The hostess immediately moved us when I asked her to, and laughed and said my companion must be a very nice person to have sat there.

One of the members at our table had the scallops which arrived rubbery- assume it was sitting under the heat lamp for too long perahps?Service: Now this is where Bar Boulud really dropped the ball.  Despite having a reservation-- 4-5 tables (half of which didn't even have a reservation, who walked in AFTER our group) were sat before us-- we were LITERALLY the only people standing at the front of the restaurant and had to ask the ""assistant hostess"" to please seat us since there was literally no one else left standing around.  Then when the actual main hostess sat us, she absolutely refused to give us a booth, saying it was ""reserved""-- okay we understand- but to our dismay-- the booths- there where 2, were left open the whole entire time we were there-- a good 2 hours!  Even beyond that, the hostess was so dismissive in her manner it was as if she was paying us to be there, not the other way around.  Lastly the waitress, whom we have had before, made us feel like it was a lot of trouble taking our order-- just not very pleasant in general.  Maybe she had an ""off night.""  All in all, compared to Lincoln or even Shunlee, for this level of service I am not sure if Bar Boulud is worth the trouble- pity because I love their cocktails.",0,1,0,Sky A.,"New York, NY",4,79,2
5.0,4/23/2017,"We really dig Bar Boulud.  I'm slightly claustrophobic, so some preliminary reconnaissance online had me a little worried about the restaurant's iconic swooped ceiling, but, in person, it's roomier than I had imagined.  The room is very chic, though the wine blot art on the south wall is a love it or hate it kind of thing.  The stone walls are really cool (take a close look at them to see how they're designed), and help to diffuse the din, which can be pretty heady, especially with the aforementioned swooped ceiling.  Many have commented on the restrooms shared with Boulud Sud, and the really cool wine cave.  Definitely worth a trip downstairs.BB's obviously an asset to the Lincoln Center neighborhood - it's great for a pre-theatre prix fixe, or a post-theatre dessert, we've cheerfully done both.  They also hosted my parents' 50th anniversary with great aplomb, and instinctively knew what I meant when I asked for a little extra love for the 'rents. The staff made them feel like a million bucks. In the Danny Meyer age, Daniel Boulud's staffs seem to have grown in warmth, but keep an enviable crispness to their exchanges with patrons. I've found the service, invariably, to be exceptional. The cocktails are quite tasty, and the wine list is spectacular (as well as divided up in an intriguing way).   One cool (though slightly pricey) feature of the wine program is the frequent opening of magnums (or larger) for sale by the glass.  We had an extremely boutique Barmès Buecher riesling from magnum once, and it was quite a treat. The staff is very knowledgeable about wines that marry well with the interesting cuisine of BB, many of which are from off the beaten path. The food: if you don't love charcuterie (we'll never be friends), you can still find much that's delicious to eat, but I strongly encourage you to take advantage of the Gilles Verot offerings, which are fabulous.  The boudin blanc with white truffle are especially good, and all the patés and jambon and the like are fabulous.  Additionally, the à la carte menu is lots of fun - gussied-up renditions of much classic French fare, served with a sense of advocacy and pride, and, again, paired with some really incredible wines. We often feel quite comfortable putting ourselves in the staff's hands with wine selection and have never regretted it.Desserts are always a hoot, as we've come to expect from Daniel Boulud's restaurants.  There's a lot of native intelligence in their design and presentation, and I will confess without shame that, a couple years ago, I had the same pistachio raspberry tart with a rose milkshake three times in a row.  I also have to confess to being a little perplexed by Bar Boulud's average rating here.  We've visited with ambitions for meals both casual and special, and they've never delivered anything less than a wonderful experience.",0,0,0,David R.,"Bethlehem, PA",1,32,163

3.0,4/2/2017,"Food is on par with what I would expect from a Boulud establishment, although the menu is not as exciting as some of the other Boulud restaurants.We came most recently for a private party, so the menu was more limited.  Of the appetizers, the beet salad was good but not very differentiated, but the beef tartare was pretty good.  Of entrees, I enjoyed the trout grenobloise -- very healthy portion of fish and meat was tender, and the pairings of the sides and sauce complemented the fish well.  However, the duck breast a l'orange was disappointing, especially since there was a price supplement for that dish.  The sauce was quite good, but the duck itself was overcooked and dry and tough.  For dessert, I really liked the entremet chocolat-cacahouete; the crunch of the biscuit was perfect.  I didn't try the gateau basque (almond custard cake), but heard others say they didn't enjoy it as much.Service was surprisingly inattentive for a private party; perhaps because we were in a private room so servers couldn't see us (although there might've been a camera in the room) and react as quickly when we needed something.  For example, almost everyone was out of wine in their glasses, and we had many unopened bottles left, yet no one came to refill the glasses for a long time; we actually tried to help ourselves but there was no wine opener.Anyway, overall this is a good restaurant option if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here.",1,0,1,Yvonne C.,"Manhattan, NY",76,383,987

I never knew I liked chicken liver till I had it here and the caramelized onions and toast were wonderful. The omelette is possibly the best omelette I've ever had. I didn't even know it was possible for an omelette to be so good. And oh the chocolate cake, that was amazing. I even loved the pink ice cream it came with.

2.0,3/2/2017,"I've been a customer of Bar Boulud's since it opened, and both it and Boulud Sud are my two ""go to"" restaurants for post-theater dining after a LC performance. For the first time, I was disappointed with Bar Boulud, a restaurant that was so consistent in its casual, high quality experience. Two gripes: First, my guest and I ordered wines by the glass, and the pour was, frankly, embarrassingly stingy  -- for a $22 glass of Franck Balthazar, no less! I should have requested to see the manager or posted a pic on social media to memorialize the incident, but didn't do either. Second, one of my favorite dishes is in New York City is the Salade Lyonnaise. It continues to be delicious and crave-able, but the portion appears to have been ""downsized,"" without a similar reduction in price. The plate it was served in appeared smaller than previous times, and almost seemed more like a side salad portion. It, two glasses of wine and the small charcuterie board were the ideal, quick late night meal for two. No more. This time, we both left a little hungry... I do hope you reconsider the above constructive criticisms; I would genuinely be sad if I had to cross Bar Boulud off my list.",0,0,0,tom c.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,0

The service was amazing- they were very attentive but not too hovering.

What we had: Mesculin salad- just your average salad, but very well presented with perfectly shaved carrots and radishes.Chef's Charcuterie small platter- nice light dish. The meats were amazing but the French ham was definitely my favourite. It also came with some pickled vegetables and warm bread. Duck chestnut rigatoni- this pasta was really good.

4.0,2/13/2017,Not sure the reason for a 3.5 star average rating. This place is a close 5 star restaurant. Elegant setting with some cute seating for those solo patrons or those in a group or just for the romantic couple. Long and we'll lit with a curved ceiling that you feel like you're in a wine cellar. Wine is the key decor here but the pricing needs to be lower. A nice selection (23 page wine and spirits list) and while everyone was drinking I felt they really needed more lower priced options for both bottles and glasses of wine. The service was stellar. The bread awesome and we sat down to a set of muffins as a gift from the chef. Had the pate with gherkins and pearl onions which was very nice and the mushroom soup was elegantly served in a small bowl and both were delicious. The artichoke risotto and pork shoulder were very good but needed a tad less salt for the pork and more roasted apples. The rice pudding with huckleberries and chocolate bomb were also excellent although pairing the risotto and then the rice pudding was a bit too much rice And just left us way too bloated and the ice cream with the chocolate could have been served in a better flavor (such as whiskey Versus the pistachio). These are just minor quibbles as this was a very satisfying meal and definitely a place to return to especially when warmer and they have their outdoor seating.,1,0,0,Steve P.,"Irvington, NY",14,150,7
4.0,2/10/2017,"My first foray in the Boulud brand, will beckon a second.The setting is something of a Lincoln Center corridor meets D.C. subway station, with high arched ceiling above the railroad layout run of 2-4 seater oak booths, high and low tables to appeal to different dining experiences.  The bright lighting and color scheme of soft yellows appeal to a lunch experience, but the excellence of the food more than makes up for the space. This is, after all, more of a wine bar-centric eatery than a formal dining arena.  On the liquid side of the table, you can find a wine suitable for your taste and budget from around $10/glass and up and there's also a decent selection of scotch ($20+).The Winter 2017 Restaurant week ($42 trois-course) menu was equally refined as the standard menu, but the wife and I parted ways here.  We did however shared a cast iron baked plate of escargot which simmered in a garlicky, pesto-like oil.  This was my first snail, so for a protein that splits its texture with a mushroom and clam, I'd give it a thumbs up.  If I remember my math, this is an order of a half dozen, but you are shorted three slices of toasted baguette.  Please fix!Ultimately, I came craving a quacker and I had the pleasure 2-3 appealing selections to choose from.  The appetizer menu serves a small or large plate of rigatoni with butternut squash, mascarpone, and duck bolognese.  I thought I'd stop here, but my waiter recommended I opt for the traditional Duck a L'Orange for a meatier preparation.  I couldn't argue with that.  This was one of those times I didn't clap back at an overzealous waiter and I'd owe him a hug if I did. BEST DUCK BREAST I've experienced!  Impeccable crispy skin, chewy layer of adipose and tender medium rare meat underneath.  There were some fancy sweet and yellow potato cylinders which I ate just to create an absence of duck for me to crave my next bite.  I appreciated the tempered citrus and sweetness in the orange marmalade sauce as a quiet pond for the duck breast to float in.Our other entree, a RW special called Provencal Seafood Bourride, was a seafood medley in a saffron, garlic aioli broth.  If none of those peak your interest everything you're doing about dinner is wrong.  The grayish-green broth deserved a better look and as refined as the flavor was, we didn't know what to do with the broth other than soak it up into table bread.This was a birthday dinner for me, thus if you know me is not complete without a Carvel Ice cream cake with chocolate crunchies!  An otherwise sweet ending was accompanied by a grotesque $10/person cake cutting fee.  Multiply that by two and we would have paid more for the CUT than the CAKE itself!?  I would not hesitate to shell out Benjamins for the food here, but pricing a service like that seems disproportionately unacceptable.Although this is not a place you'd want to have your cake and eat it too, the service from our friendly waiter to a knowledgeable sommelier was very accommodating and a meal at Bar Boulud is worth a taste of French-American cuisine particularly for a lunch date around a Lincoln Center event, shopping in Columbus circle, or a walk through  Central Park.",3,0,1,Rinku K.,"Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, NY",37,166,53

In fact all of the bread was quite good, but the cheese things were otherworldly delicious. Our appetizers were all quite good. The French Onion Soup was one of the best I've had. Where the meal fell for me was the artichoke risotto. The texture was almost porridge like and for me the canned flavor of the artichoke hearts simply didn't work with it. I topped it with the black truffles they were offering but it was just a waste of flavor. I've had a lot of risotto the past few months and this was easily the most disappointing. The steak was quite good and the chocolate dessert was divine. The service was also very good.

4.0,1/31/2017,"Having had a rather poor restaurant week meal just a few days ago at another well-known restaurant, I encourage you to pay a visit to Bar Boulud. Somehow through the years, Restaurant Week has come to mean poor or uninspired food and lackluster service. A clever well-meaning marketing ploy meant to fill seats during the winter and summer doldrums, many restaurants seem to have decided that they didn't need to put their best food out or provide great service. It's become more of a cattle call at some restaurants. Not so at Bar Boulud. We walked in on a whim last night not sure if they'd have a table. They weren't slow but still managed to find us a couple of seats in the back at one of their communal tables. Not once during the course of our meal did their professionalism slip. To be sure this isn't Chef Bouluds' most formal dining room, but you wouldn't know that from the service. Polite, attentive and unobtrusive, the entire service staff did a great job. From the moment we arrived to when we walked out (to at least 4 ""thank you and good-night"") we were made to feel welcome and at home. As we had hoped, the food was well prepared and presented. A velvety mushroom veloute was wonderful on a cold winters evening and the pate grand mere was a sturdy classic. Artichoke risotto was expertly cooked with the rice giving up that perfect little al-dente bite and their take on the french classic Choucroute with braised pork shank, kraut and roasted apple offered a deliciously satisfying bite. Desserts were no throw away either. The Chocolate and Hazelnut Bombe was beautifully presented and perfect for all chocoholics while the Riz au Lait was creamy and decadent with it's ring of pistachio cream anglaise and poached huckleberries. We enjoyed the meal so much that we went next door to Epicerie Boulud and brought home sandwiches for our two sons.

As far as the service, on par with the food.  I wish I remembered her name, but the server was both friendly and helpful.  She was young and had a cool tattoo, that's all I remember.  And please keep in mind this is Valentine's day, so a lot of places have that get in and get out mentality.  This is not one of those places.  We were there until 1:45, and only left because we needed to get to a play.  The place was packed, but we were never rushed.   We walked in with five star expectations, and they handily met them.",2,0,0,John M.,"Wantagh, NY",1,257,5

1.0,12/10/2016,"My husband and I ate here last night pre-ballet. I had read some mixed reviews but thought 'how bad can it be. It's classic French bistro fare with Daniel Boulud's name attached to it'. How wrong I was. We ordered escargots to start. They came out 4 minutes later and were clearly microwaved (and over-microwaved at that). They were tough and the sauce was burned so you couldn't dip your butter. Basically--dry and very chewy. Then approximately 5 minutes later, to make the experience even worse, a server came and literally grabbed my plate of bread and a sad, lone escargot and swapped it out for my main as I said 'I'm still working on that bread'. He ran off with it. Do not expect good service. They really seem to want people in and out as quickly as possible. Now for the reason I give this place 1 star---I ordered the blood sausage, my husband the Frenchie burger. When it came out the presentation was impressive but when I took my first bite it was cold and had spots of hot areas. Clearly it was microwaved (they seem to love microwaving food here). My husband tried it and agreed. We called our server over and told him, he said he would take it back to the kitchen and tell the chef. Less than five minutes later he returned with the same exact plate (fork stab and all) that I had complained about. They had just heated it up in the microwave again. I asked them to take it away and just nibbled on bread and shared my husband's burger. This is truly unacceptable at any establishment, let alone a Daniel Boulud one. The food wasn't fresh, was quite bland and the service just as awful. When we asked to speak to the manager she wasn't really too apologetic and simply said they would take it off the bill.

3.0,10/31/2016,"So I came back to Bar Boulud and I am updating my review. Just for reference, in my original review I gave this place four stars because the hamburger was great and the atmosphere was upscale with a good crowd.This weekend I tried the charcuterie board and the foie gra. The charcuterie board was very bland. You get a few pieces of meat that resembles bologna (i.e., different meats combined together). There were also a few pieces of ""Parisian ham"" or something that tasted just like Boars Head ham (not bad, but nothing special). The taste was just way too subtle for me.Dissapointed, I ordered the foie gra which I always love. Well, it turns out that the foie gra comes imbedded in a piece of meat like the ones in the chacurterie board and you can barely taste it (I actually couldn't taste the difference between this and the meats in the chacurterie board).Someone next to me ordered a salad and that looked good. But this place is famous for meats, so that's what you order here.",0,0,0,Speedy G.,"Jersey City, NJ",1,75,1
1.0,10/20/2016,"First of all, let me say the food here is very good. I had the coq au vin. My friends had the bavette steak. All good. But, the restaurant works really hard at making this a miserable dining experience.We started with an incredibly pushy sommelier coming to us several times to ask if we had chosen our wine...coming back every 3 minutes - 3 times.) I finally had to ask him to suggest something after the two choices we made were met with ""We're out of that wine"". This then turned into going north of the $100 mark for a bottle of red.  Then, our dinners took ONE HOUR to be served. There were plenty of empty tables so no idea of the delay.We had a 17 year old with us who pleaded not to order dessert because he didn't want to have to wait!!

The presentation of the food was old school French, which I actually kind of like. The small charcuterie board had some decent bites but overall the none of the flavors were anything particularly spectacular. The pastas were actually quite nicely prepared. The gnocchi was absolutely perfect. The basic flavors of the duck orecchiette were very strong and defined. I have no idea what the purpose of the mascarpone was on that dish because it added a certain level of blandness to the contrasting bright flavors of the bolognese. The moules frites were a great choice and we finished with a nice mouse dessert. The service was a bit slow, brisk, and inattentive but I'm willing to chalk that up to a busy weekend night although I didn't leave with a warm fuzzy feeling toward our waiter.",0,0,0,Kasia G.,"Philadelphia, PA",99,170,364

IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT I ordered the Frenchie Burger. I LOVED IT. The prom belly confit added a nice richness to the burger that was perfectly balanced and not to heavy alongside with the angus beefBut the true highlight... was the Pommes Aligot. Cheese and mash potatoes by itself is a killer but together???? If it was tinder I would super like. PURE HEAVEN. The combination of the cheese and the potatoes was absolutely perfect- creamy and rich all around. Everyone in my table couldn't stop talking about the mouthgasm that followed with every bite! Oh better yet..  The executive chef Alexander Burger came over to our table to check on us and we couldn't stop telling him how wonderful the Pommes Aligot. It was such an experience!

I didn't have the  heart to ask for salt, but honestly how can you make bland moules frites? Garlic, lemon, and wine should equal flavor explosion, but it was a tragic waste of bivalves. Similarly, the caper-coated beef tartare was my absolute dream on a plate... Until I tasted it. Just tasted like the radicchio used as a vessel to eat it with. Tragic!

My boyfriend and I made reservations and arrived 30 min late, which they still accommodated on a busy Friday night in NYC so I guess that gives them some brownie points. We ordered the small cold charcuterie sampler and to be 100% honest the flavors were very bland. It tasted very pre made or like it had been sitting out for a couple hours. We dismissed it as perhaps just a bad appetizer choice and I ordered the coq au vin chicken and my boyfriend ordered the blood sausage. Unfortunately both of our entrees still lacked the flavor profile and freshness we were hoping for and tasted more like something I would imagine you would get from a chain like Olive Garden. Our sever was inattentive and was not efficient in clearing our small table at all as we changed courses.

However, not to pass on the opportunity, we decided to still go ahead and order some food to share. First of all, they have this croissant/cheese puff like bread that was totally addicting and we could not stop eating. We ordered oyster, market salad and escargot fricassee persillade to start.

4.0,8/13/2016,"After walking past it so many times and wondering why it was always bustling with customers, I finally got to try Bar Boulud thanks to restaurant week prices! The restaurant's interior is unique, calming and beautiful. You feel like you're in an elegantly lit tunnel of sorts! That probably doesn't sound too appealing, but I promise the interior is actually nice. Restrooms are located downstairs, and I again found myself admiring the decor.I got the following off of the prix fixe menu: Salmon Rillette, Roasted Corn Risotto, and Blackberry Financier. Afterwards, I also got chamomile tea. Because I was so hungry when I ordered, I glazed over the menu and impulsively chose the Salmon Rillette; as such, I didn't realize the salmon would be on top of a piece of toasted rye. Being gluten free, I couldn't eat the rye, and so the salmon tasted a bit too salty. But that's not the chef's fault! The Salmon Rillette wasn't anything mind blowing, but it was still quite good. I think the best way to describe it is to say that it was basically a tuna tartare, but with salmon.The Roasted Corn Risotto was tasty as well! The smooth, unprovocative flavors felt nurturing for my soul and stomach. The star ingredient - the corn- was sweet, soft, and so very juicy. I was initially a bit unnerved by how much olive oil there was in the plate, but I grew to like the taste of the olive oil. It isn't so overpowering that you want to gag - the chili oil roasted peppers and scarred scallions help balance out the flavors.I made the same mistake with desert as I did with the appetizer and ordered a gluten-heavy menu offering. While I couldn't eat the actual blackberry financier, I did like the curious and innovative toppings on the blackberry financier (i.e. popcorn and sweet corn), and I also loved the brown butter ice cream! As a side note, I had a bite of my friend's pan-seared mackerel and must say it was one of the best mackerel dishes I have ever had. I'm generally not a fan of mackerel because the mackerel has a certain scent that I don't particularly like, but I couldn't detect it here at all. The mackerel was also superbly tender, yet moist. Don't get the argulua salad (appetizer option) though, as it is just your normal argulua salad - unless you like that!",1,0,1,Gahee L.,"New York, NY",253,103,96
3.0,8/8/2016,"Bar Boulud is a great brunch spot!We met our best friends there for Sunday Brunch this past Saturday and had a lovely time. The space has a wine bar feel to it. Most of the staff is very friendly and helpful. The reason I say most, is because our friends were late and I stood outside to see if they were confused by the several Boulud restaurants in a row and went into the wrong one. A male maitre de asked me (rudely) if he could help me. I politely said, I was okay.Our waitress was great, we had:- avocado toast with poached egg - delicious- eggs florentine - very good- eggs with sausage - tastyAnother negative was the cleanliness of the main floor restroom.

I have been to Daniel's other restaurants and have had a much better experience. But, this past Sunday was pretty bad.We ordered from the Restaurant Week menu. For her entree, my mother ordered the steak, well-done. Yes, many chef's hate to make a steak well-done but they will do it for a paying customer. About 45 minutes after our order was in we still hadn't received our appetizer. When we asked our server he said that because she ordered well done steak it will take much, much longer. Hmmm. What does her steak have to with our chilled soup? And, well-done takes about 2 minutes longer for the strips of steak. OK. Whatever. We waited another 25 minutes while other tables that came after us were eating their appetizers and main meals.I asked my mother if she wanted to leave and go to the Smith (which is always good) but she decided to wait it out. Then the soup came (1hour and 10 minutes after we arrived). It was a cold soup so it's doubly confusing why this took so long. And, it wasn't very good. If we weren't starving by that point it would have gone unfinished. The entrees were delicious but came about 20 minutes after we were finished with our soups. The servings were small.And then desert. My mother specifically asked what kind of ice cream was served and told our server she couldn't eat chocolate. He assured her it was strawberry. Well, you guessed it. It was chocolate. After sending it back, she ordered what I ordered (I can't even remember what it was because it was that unmemorable). And there you have it. A frustrating, expensive (it was only expensive because of the mediocrity--if the food and service were good the price would have been fine) and 3 hour long meal.

Really, $5.50 for a small cup of brewed coffee? That's an absurdity, even for Manhattan. This is an example of really taking advantage.

The charcuterie /pate appetizer was beautifully presented, with a small mason jar of cornishons and a nice slice of pate. And my son's snail appetizer--presented in a cast iron 'plate' where each little indentation held a snail covered in a light pesto--was proclaimed as delicious.   Entrees included perfectly glazed and nicely cooked, tender duck breast (a la carte), gnocchi that was light and sauced with a well-seasoned pesto, and a pork tenderloin cooked medium as requested. Desserts were yummy--a brownie (blondie) topped with peanut butter mousse with a dollop of ice cream went down easily, but the real star was the fruit tart.  We sat outside on a lovely spring evening (on the ""Boulud Sud"") side and appreciated the attentive service.  While we did have to ask our wait staff to speed up our meal and remind them that we had a curtain to catch, they hustled a bit more to bring our desserts and check.

I really enjoyed my last call gin cocktail. I requested grapefruit cooler instead of lime and was shocked to see the drink come out a translucent green. I was informed that Bar Boulud's grapefruit mixer was indeed green--interesting!(?) Citrus Ile Flottante, a poached vanilla meringue soaked in coconut lime creme aingalise, was very good. Again, shocked, that the meringue was actually soft and spongey versus crispy and airy, but loved it nonetheless. Creme really made the dish. Madeleine cookies were also much better than I had anticipated.

I thought this was a really lovely dessert. They have an excellent wine selection and we thoroughly enjoyed the wines we had.I'm rounding down from a 3.5 because while the food was executed perfectly I felt like I was comparing the dishes to better similar dishes I had in the past. With almost every plate I had a better version of it elsewhere. Also I felt like we were rushed throughout our dinner, even when I had food on my plate. It's a 3, an A-OK on the spectrum of fine dining scene. I would still recommend have checking out their prix fixe lunch/dinner if you're in the area.

2.0,2/24/2016,"Came here for Restaurant Week for Summer 2015. First, you can sit inside or outside. It was a chilly day so we opted for inside, but quickly regretted it. The inside of the dining room is one long passageway with the bar on one side and a row of small tables on the other. It is pretty casual, but not the most open, pleasing floor plan.The best part of the meal was the chocolate dessert, everything else fell short of expectations. We started with a soup and a meat plate, both were okay at best. We then went to the skate wing and risotto/pasta for our entrees. The risotto/pasta was soggy and bland and not visually appealing at all. The skate wing was overcooked, and disjointed in the flavor palette. The chocolate dessert was pretty good but the other gelato dessert was too sweet. Overall, pretty disappointed by the food.

The sommelier was the highlight of the night i have to say. He was so helpful and so knowledgable. It was not the head sommelier, and i forgot to ask his name, but his recommendation about the Jura wine was excellent. the small plate of charcuterie was ok, but nothing memorable, the escargots were ok, but the persillade was dry. The coq au vin was a total miss, and the chef needs to read the reviews since all of us think the same. The oriechiette au lapin is seriously a joke. there are like 4 peices of small rabbit, and it is drowned with a flavorless sauce.

2.0,2/10/2016,"""When the check with the tip is approaching $500 for four people at a freaking French Bistro, it better be a f***in' memorable meal.""My friend's quote that I've been trying to digest (pun completely intended) since the four of us had dinner at Bar Boulud on a very mild Saturday evening in February. And I still think I need some Alka Seltzer. This was not the review I was expecting to write -- or ever wanted to write.But it's never too late for a little discipline and objectivity when it comes to these matters. I admittedly walked into Bar Boulud full of anticipation and -- dare I say -- a bit star struck. But my knowledge of Daniel Boulud, in reality, is purely second hand reviews, official biography, and television appearances depicting a seasoned chef who seems like a nice guy.  And certainly a chef with undeniable skill and pedigree -- someone who paid his dues, excelled beyond most others, and richly deserves to enjoy the fruits of his labors at this stage of his career and life.So I stared at the online menu for weeks in advance -- ""what do I get, what do I get, what do I give up"" -- completely uncertain about a decision even as I was sitting down in a timely fashion for our reservation. And then I was handed the real menu -- a shabby relic encased in crinkled and somewhat hazy plastic...the kind of plastic that your old Aunt used to cover her living room couch in back in the 1970s.But -- on to the offerings.  No surprises.  Everything online was on there.  For the four of us, we order the escargot, tartare, and black/white sausage sampler.  A pretty good start.  Escargot, flavor-wise, was familiar and hard to mess up...garlicky, tender snails, but the little potato croquettes were remarkably bland in desperate need of salt. Tartare packed some flavor. Boudin sampler -- just okay.  Small portion for $30 (and I usually don't take price into consideration); the noir not unlike some well-sourced morcilla that I could warm up at home. The blanc was blanc.Mains:  My wife had the Frenchie burger for $23.  Ordinary.  I had the mussels -- small portion and very ordinary (as were the frites). My one friend had the Coq au Vin, which she thoroughly enjoyed, though we all felt the lardons were a bit square and chunky and, given their chewy, greasy, fatty bite, could use additional rendering. I personally thought the dish needed more sauce on the plate, as well.  And my other friend had the pasta with rabbit ragu.  And we had a first:  I have never been at a table where one of my dinner companions needed to send a pasta dish back because -- wait for it -- the pasta wasn't cooked enough.  And he was right -- that stuff was crunchy.  Even the most rigorous fan of al dente could not deny that those noodles were crunching like pretzels. They returned the dish a tad more cooked -- but just barely.  Most certainly a reheat (in contrast to the waiter confirming, ""okay so you want the same dish prepared but the pasta should be cooked more.""  Yes was the answer....but a new dish was not prepared...the old dish was repaired...sort of...not).Desserts and coffee were subsequently ordered, and much to our regret.  The sporadic service to this point just simply disappeared. We were all finished with our coffees long before a hint of anything sweet showed up.  We were ready to cancel the order when the guy came out with plates in hand.  And we accepted them.  I think sometimes we are too nice.Having enjoyed a great day in the city (""Book of Mormon' matinee -- it's funny as hell, but be prepared to take a joke no matter who or what you are or believe!) and incredible weather for February in NYC, we left saying good things to each other about the meal. But the benefit of a good night's sleep and 20-20 hindsight brought some much needed and justified perspective.  It's been a lot of years since Le Cirque for Chef Boulud. He commands an empire, not a kitchen, these days.And it pains me to say that what we experienced is not something he would be proud of.  Said another way:  Bar Boulud can and should do better.  Much better.",1,0,0,Abominable D.,"Manhattan, NY",2,20,0
3.0,2/9/2016,"Bar Boulud has that classy feel. The restaurant is seemingly glazed by an eternal sepia filter, its walls lined with Georgia O'Keefe-ian wine residue ""paintings"" and a circular table circumscribing a tree planted in the back. The prices of the items scream ""fancy"" as well, with burgers costing $23 and a sausage plate running over $30. But you expect those things when coming to a Boulud restaurant. You come for the service, the tastes, and the ambiance. Unfortunately, the service was one area that they could work on. We arrived close to on time for our reservation, but had to wait 20 minutes before they took our order. The server filling our water was super attentive, but the guy taking the order was nowhere to be seen. When we did finally get to order, we had the cold meat plate to share (small size) and ordered our respective entrees. For the four of us, the small meat plate was perfect, perhaps because we were filling ourselves silly with the free bread, ranging from dark, wild grains to a cheesy swirl bread (I'm not 100% sure they call it that...). The Frenchie burger I had was great - the cheese was melted straight onto the patty and the bacon pieces were great. I loved the perfectly cooked French fries as well. The Escargot I tried was okay, but maybe I just don't like that dish in general. The black and white combination sausage dish that my friend got was plated beautifully, but looked pretty small.We had originally gone to check out their Restaurant Week menu, but changed our minds when the options seemed pretty limited and restrictive.

1.0,2/5/2016,"We had eaten here before a month or so ago and it was nice. So after the ballet at the Lincoln Center last night we thought it would be the perfect place to go. The reason I'm giving it one star is that our waiter was very unhelpful and surly strange towards us. There was a whole palaver involving a bread basket. People who had walked in after us were busily tipping back their wine, eating the bread in their bread baskets. We just sat and sat with empty glasses and empty plates. When we finally flagged him down and ordered I asked for bread, we were hungry hadn't eaten dinner and it was past 10pm , he brusquely said 'it's coming' . It didn't. So I asked again. Then 4 slices of granary bread turned up. None of the rolls or the tiny baguettes everyone else had been given. Who knows what as going on. I asked him why and he said the bread was still being baked. Which was nonsense since the people before us and the people after us had all been given the good 'special' bread selection. There was only us with the bread for the bird feeder slices. It was all very strange. He got my drink wrong and overcharged us by $50. He didn't apologise about that - just slapped the new bill down on the table. The food isn't that stunning. You can get way better, way cheaper in other restaurants in the city.

If restaurant week is meant to showcase what the place can offer and have customers going back, I'd say Bar Boulud is certainly doing it wrong. The food was underwhelming to say the least. My wife's Cauliflower soup was good as was my pate, but it went downhill from there on. The entrees were lacking in flavor or punch. The duck confit I got was quite bland. My wife's gnocchi was just meh and didn't taste of anything. And dessert at the end was a confused mix of flavors.

4.0,1/23/2016,"Bar Boulud was good, but the food was not as good as at Boulud Sud, its sister restaurant around the corner. We ordered from the restaurant week menu. The cauliflower soup was the best thing in my three course meal. It had pine nuts and raisins in it, which made it dramatically more fantastic than any regular soup - delicious! I could've eaten a big bowl of it. The cod was good, but it was almost cold (like it wasn't hot as if it had just come off the stove or out of an oven) and it was just a tad bit undercooked. I should've ordered the duck or steak instead. I tasted my friend's gnocchi and it was actually amazing! I am usually not a fan of gnocchi, in fact, it would be the last thing I would order, but this was the best gnocchi I've ever tasted, it was served with brown butter and whole hazelnuts - really good, I'd highly recommend it.Dessert was a miss for me. The chocolate cake had too many weird and competing flavors. The passion fruit in the cake tasted out of place, the hazelnut was overpowering and the cocoa ice cream was a bit bitter. Not a sweet dessert, just a weird combination of flavors. Shame to mess up a simple chocolate cake. Service was decent, but the server totally forgot our coffee order. Wine by the glass selections were limited. The restaurant is a long, narrow submarine-like space. Tables are very close together.

You can taste when something is not seasoned correctly, or needs more salt, overcooked, undercooked, and when you eat at fine establishments regularly, you expect more than your local bodega. Perhaps, I ate on an 'off-night' or maybe the chef was sick, either way, I wanted more flavor, more perfection! But the dessert was amazing! We shared this chocolate dish.

No crispy char on the outside or any of that salty goodness that comes with better-cooked meat. My wife had the lamb which was tastier than mine, but still not knocked out of the park.

Once they finally acknowledged we were there we order quickly, the Croque Madame and Croque Monsieur, which is basically a ham sandwich with melted cheese inside and on the outside (gruyere cheese). I had also asked for a mint lemon aide which wasn't delivered to me until after way through eating my sandwich. Ok, the food.

2.0,8/25/2015,"Okay let's begin.  First off service while professional and courteous, it's tough to shake that it's quite obvious that every person working there hated their job.  For a Saturday late brunch, was expecting it to be busier but judging by the food and prices it's clear as to why.  I paid 26 dollars for two eggs, two tiny piece of bacon and an undercooked sausage.  When I pointed out that the sausage was cold in the middle and clearly undercooked which is disgusting to begin with, the waiter apologized, took the plate and came back two minutes later with the destroyed sausage basically reheated but still not cooked properly.   Perhaps this was just an authentic French experience but in my opinion there are just way too many places with better service, better food and better prices.  The Bloody Mary was very good on the flip side, and the eggs florentine looked good.  Overall, can't recommend this place although o truly enjoy the prepared foods next door which is why I suppose I expected more from this swanky decor and same ownership.  Stick to the take out next door I say.",0,0,0,Doug R.,"Manhattan, NY",160,68,0
5.0,8/14/2015,"An amazing, incredibly good restaurant. I'd gone with a friend thinking we'd catch the last night of RW, but as soon as we sat down and looked at the menu, we decided to go ala carte. There were just so many more appetizing things on that menu, and we're glad we did. Started off with two glasses of wine - a beaujolais that was a bit sediment-heavy but good, and a crisp rose that my friend loved. Appetizer was a shared dish of the aioli de homard, the half-lobster with garlic sauce. The lobster was delicious, as was the dip, and the quail egg was unexpectedly good. My friend ordered the Frenchie burger, and utterly loved it, especially the slice of pork belly. I had the moules frites, which were some of the most delicious and tender mussels I've ever had, and the frites were pretty darn good too. Had the chocolate caramel tart for dessert, which was a bit odd, in our opinion. The tart itself was delicious, but the caramel inside was a bit too sweet, and the accompanying pretzel ice cream was almost unbearably salty. Mixing it together into a soup wasn't pretty, but made the flavors meld a bit better.

5.0,8/2/2015,"When you go to a Boulud restaurant, you instantly get the feeling like Daniel Boulud is truly a ""Chef's chef"".  Almost like a Dean / Head Instructor of a good culinary institute, you see the culinary mastery in the food and presentation.I originally went for Restaurant Week, but ultimately decided on going with the a la carte menu because I just had to try the coq au vin, and also their head cheese.Ever since I saw coq au vin on Alton Brown's ""Good Eats"", I have been eager to try it, and figured to try it professionally made before attempting to make it myself.  Now that I had it at Bar Boulud, I might have been too spoiled to ever want to make it myself.The bread, head cheese, and coq au vin, were all really good, but if I had to pick a winner, it would be the coq au vin.And last thing to point out: the food is surprisingly very filling.  Don't be fooled by what looks like medium-sized portions.  If you are hungry, you will get fed.I made the job for the dishwasher very easy.  I cleaned every plate and basket.",2,2,1,Lee S.,"Weehawken, NJ",203,174,51

Light, healthy, and flavorful accompanied with roasted sunflower seeds and cherries. Main dish was okay - I got the skate fish.

4.0,8/1/2015,"Nice place for a post-Lincoln Center matinee dinner.  Based on the food and service we experienced directly, I'd rate Bar Boulud 3 1/2 stars.  The extra 1/2 star is for the thoughtful food runner/bus boy who brought a cup of water to a service dog who's client was dining at one of Bar Boulud's sidewalk tables.  It was hot out so the dog seemed to enjoy the water.It was restaurant week but we ordered off of their a la carte menu.  Food was slightly better than average.  Hubby had the escargot and dayboat scallops with barley risotto.  I had the warm asparagus app and the Atlantic halibut.  Desserts - gateau basque and the chocolate-caramel tart - were on the small side and not very exciting - expected more for $14.  I really appreciated getting loose chamomile tea leaves thought instead of a tea bag.  Service from the gentleman in a suit was very attentive.  Then our server showed up about half-way through our dinner; he seemed harried and alittle distracted.  Tables for two were tightly spaced.We'll probably return because the restaurant is in a convenient location for Lincoln Center events and beause I want to try their classic Coq au Vin dish.",0,1,0,Aly Y.,"Morristown, NJ",12,268,12

5.0,7/6/2015,"My husband and I came here for dinner last night after watching The King and I at Lincoln Center. We previously dined at Café Boulud and didn't really have expectations for this restaurant, so we were pleasantly surprised at how happy we were with the meal. The food is delicious, but the service is what makes this restaurant exceptional. Our waiter, Shane, was helpful and attentive but not over bearing. My husband has a peanut and tree nut  allergy and he took great care to ensure that his meal didn't contain any allergens. We decided to share a small charcuterie board and both have the $45 pre-fixe dinner. We each also ordered a wine flight which consisted of 3 different wines (we got 1 red and 1 white flight).Kyle, the maître-d/sommelier, personally came over to serve us our wine and tell us about each. She was very informative and patient with my questions about the wines. She also gave suggestions on which wines we should pair with each course. She also checked on us throughout our meal and even treated us to a sample of the wine of the night. As far as the food, the charcuterie platter was ok. We've had better but it was a nice start to our meal. For our appetizer, my husband had the arugula salad and I had the chilled corn soup. Both were good, but weren't our favorites. My husband got the coq au vin for his entrée which was rich and filling. His favorite part was the hand made pasta. I got the durade (fish) for my entrée. The skin was perfectly crisp, while the flesh was still moist. The accompanying vegetables were buttery and delicious. The only part I didn't enjoy was the peanut romesco. I couldn't taste it since it was more of a garnish on the plate. Before our desserts came out, Kyle came back with another treat. She had a muscat wine she wanted me to drink to with my strawberry macaron and a sherry to accomapany my husband's chocolate cake. Both desserts were fabulous alone, but the wines really complimented each.We were truly impressed by the attentiveness of Kyle and were glad that she was so kind and helpful.

Right across from Lincoln center.  Seemed fairly disorganized when we entered and wanted to sit at an outside table.  The seating was eventually handled and pleasant and the menu selection for brunch was just ok.  We settled on a Greek salad and pancakes.  They could not accommodate chicken with the Greek salad. That was ok.but not too ok for the server to act like we insulted the chef.  So 1 beer, coffee ( had to try to find the server several times for a refill) a tuna salad Nicoise, and the bill, with tip was over $70.  Really not even close to getting our monies worth in service or food.  The pancakes were good.  But three very very thin crepes would not satisfy a 10 year old. And I am not even close to being a 10 year old. Could have used another 5 pancakes to have a satisfying meal.  The service was a bit less than ok.  We live a couple of blocks from the restaurant.  Always wanted to try it.  Now we feel that it is just another tourist trap in Lincoln Square.  A shame.",2,0,0,James D.,"Manhattan, NY",1,39,0

My boyfriend and I were on our way into the city for errands and decided via Open Table as we riding through the tunnel to just book Bar Boulud since both of us have not been.The experience overall was very pleasant. We were greeted with smiles and had checked in our coats almost immediately. The Matrie D had escorted us to our booth table, and not too long after by our servers asking us what type of water we preferred. If you're looking for upscale yet casual, Bar Boulud definitely fits the bill. Their SAINT JACQUES ESPAGNOLE is amazing! If I could put it in unrefined terms, the dish tastes exactly like Pork Fried Rice from your local Chinese take out. The resemblance is quite comical, yet so comforting! They are best known for their CHARCUTERIE board, which is probably the heftiest, most priciest one I've known to eat. If you're into that stuff, their rabbit and pork pate is the best out of the three.Is it worth the money?

The portion was pretty good, I would have loved a bit more meat and less spinach but that is the story of my life and always my complaint.  The hollandaise sauce was on point and poached eggs were drippy just the way they should be.The home fries were delicious - tiny little potatoes smashed just enough to get flattened out.  Bacon well, you know how I feel about it, I think Jim Gaffigan once said ""you know how good bacon is?

The space is trendy but intimate, the decor contemporary without being cold. I especially loved the framed art on the wall: wine-stained tablecloths with subtle captions indicating what kind of wine each rusty red blot is (very cool and unique!). We sat in a cozy booth at the back of the long restaurant and started with a bottle of Chablis and sparkling water. Our server was delightful, knowledgeable and friendly. We began our meal with various appetizers: fresh Cape Cod oysters, spring garlic soup, asparagus, and a small charcuterie board. Their various pates are outstanding - I could have made a meal just of this board. For entrees we had the Frenchie burger, the paella, and the morel-stuffed chicken. Everything was absolutely perfect - I love ordering simple dishes at such renowned restaurants as Bar Boulud because they elevate something as humble as chicken and mushrooms like no one else can.

The staff was very accommodating when we requested a seat change and we got our night started in a cute booth in the back.Their menu had a variety of options and we ordered the pate and soup for an appetizer, fish and chicken for entrees, and the Lanka cotta and chocolate cake to finish. The winner of the appetizers was the pate. The accompanying toppings gave crunch and pucker to the salty starter, and the tasted bread added the final texture element. My soup was tasty, but I felt the flavor got boring after the third bite, although I did appreciate the seeds on top.My fish entree was the winner of round two. A hefty piece of cod on a bed of split peas, it was the perfect Friday night meal. The chicken didn't have as much flavor, and the sides weren't as exciting.Desserts were both tasty, but I felt my chocolate cake trumped the panna cotta. The ranges of textures and flavors were the real show stoppers: smooth, creamy, sweet, crunchy, salty, saucy, cold, gritty. It felt like eating a deconstructed Mexican sundae, and I loved every bite.Service was decent throughout the experience.

4.0,4/8/2015,"Bar Boulud was the perfect place to catch up with a friend over cocktails and amazing food on the first warm day of the spring. We arrived right after work and had no problem getting a table outdoors, which was surprising considering that reservations are taken up to one month in advance. Since I arrived first, I gave the hostess my name and told her my friend was going to arrive in 15 minutes, and that I wanted to have an outdoor table if possible. Remarkably the hostess offered for me to sit down immediately and wait for my friend, which is very rare in NYC, since most restaurants, especially fancy ones make you wait for your whole party to arrive before being taken to a table and being sat. I was astounded and took full advantage of this!After my friend finally arrived, the waiter waited to come over for several minutes before taking our drink order. He started the night by apologizing for ignoring us, which was a little weird, but I guess also nice? Since we were so busy catching up instead of looking at the menu, we had no idea what we wanted to order when the waiter came back for our order. After asking his recommendation on items, we still weren't sure because so many dishes sounded amazing. He gave us more time, and then returned to ask for our orders, and when we still weren't 100% sure, he kind of made fun of us.To start, we shared the Aiolo de Homard salad, which was half of a lobster accompanied with a huge assortment of vegetables that were all so fresh and colorful. The visual appeal of this salad was amazing because there was every color of the rainbow present on the plate. The salad was extremely easy to share because of how it was served in an almost vegetable platter type of arrangement, where each vegetable was grouped together in its own area with sweet garlic dip in the center. I would highly recommend this salad because of the quality of vegetables and freshness that it has.My one complaint would be that we were enjoying the salad so much and taking our time with dipping each vegetable into the sauce that when our entrees were ready, we were still enjoying the salad and weren't finished. Instead of them leaving our dishes in the kitchen and checking on our status, our dishes were brought out near our table with the waiter rushing over to us to tell that our dishes were ready and that we needed to finish our salad. He literally stood over us as we both grabbed the last few vegetables from the plate before it was taken away. I have never experienced something like this at a restaurant before. Normally dishes are held in the kitchen and kept warm until the table is done with their starter.For my entree, I ordered the Fleischschnecke de Lapin, which was braised rabbit, rolled inside of a pasta shell. Inside the shell there were many layers of pasta with rabbit in-between each layer. It was almost like a lasagna type of consistency, but French style and way better! It was extremely rich and flavorful with the sauce being very savory and creamy. Each bite was like eating a slice of heaven. The sauerkraut that was on the plate was a nice palate cleanser and a fresh addition to the dish to make each bite new and delicious! I am still thinking about this dish days later!My friend had the Saint-Jacques ""Espagnole"", which was also very delicious. The scallops were crusted with chorizo and gave the scallops a very hearty pork flavor.For dessert, we ordered one that we loved, and another one that was only ok. Based on the suggestion of our waiter, we selected the Pudding au Chocolat, which was probably one of the best chocolate desserts that I have had in a while. It was warm and served in a pool of melted ice cream, while also being topped with the ice cream. The bread pudding had a hint of cinnamon in a Christmas kind of spicy way. It was delicious! The Salted Caramel Ice cream that was on top of the chocolate pudding was fresh and full of the caramel flavor. The poached pears were sweet and helped offset the richness of the dessert by bringing a fruit element to the mix. When raving to waiter about this dessert, and asking him if he has had it often, we learned an interesting fact about it. The restaurant bakes these cakes in a square shape because square shaped cake bakes with more moisture. They then cut the square into a circle for visual interest and the wait staff gets to eat the cut off corners. Our second dessert was only ok, and was made with a vanilla meringue cake sitting in the center of a green tea anglaise. It was more on the bland side, and not very rich and exciting. This dessert would be for someone looking more for a cold, refreshing, fruity dessert. This dessert wasn't bad, but compared to the Chocolat Pudding, nothing can compare and nothing can ever be close!Bar Boulud was amazing besides some minor service issues, but nothing that I can't look past. My friend and I really liked our second waiter who had the Australian accent because he was super attentive and nice!",0,0,0,Carlen M.,"Manhattan, NY",370,97,473
4.0,3/24/2015,"We experienced Bar Boulud on a recent trip to NYC.  It's across from Lincoln Center and as we were attending a performance there it was convenient.  We made a reservation for 11:30 so the menu at that time was mainly lunch and brunch fare.We were shown to our table and then it seemed  awhile before we were approached by a server.  I finally caught the eye of one and she came over and answered questions about the food.  So right away, I would say that the service in this restaurant borders on leisurely.  It was a Saturday morning, so I guess many New Yorkers welcome that aspect of late morning dining.On to the food:  Two of us chose Frenchie burgers----a burger with pork belly confit on a black pepper roll.  There was a bit of a mix-up about the doneness of the burger and I had to send mine back because it was cooked medium-rare instead of medium-well.  But it was remedied and the burger was nicely flavored and moist.   The fresh cut fries are a nice plus---and an extra order was brought with the correctly cooked burger!   Others ordered quiche and another----the roast beef sandwich.  They were both nicely presented and pronounced to be delicious!Desserts were an updated version of Ile Flottante---very light and citrus flavored, clafoutis, and an assortment of sorbets----chocolate-banana-malt,  honey, and my very favorite blood orange!   Coffees and espressos followed.   Another interesting aspect of this restaurant was the wine cellar in the lower level.  It would be fun to come here in the evening and have dinner and sample one of the many bottles that were lining the stairway walls!   We'll definitely be back on another visit to NYC!",2,0,1,Mary A.,"Charleston, SC",11,246,0

If you are looking to share your dining experience with friends, this is not the place to go.Moving past the cramped table situation, I would say we were all completely underwhelmed by the food. This is a true story of a an executive chef using their ""name"" to pump out less than mediocre dishes at premium prices. From the pork belly and Pâté course, straight through to the main dishes we were less than impressed. The only two appetizers worth a mention was the squid ink and the steak salad.

2.0,2/24/2015,"I met a friend here on Sunday night for dinner. It was my first time coming here and I was pretty excited to be trying a new restaurant. I ordered the Aioli De Homard an appetizer that was $20. It was basically a salad with fresh seasoned vegetables ( they were delicious), one small lobster tail ( a little disappointed at how small it was but it was cooked to perfection), a creamy aioli sauce ( soooooooo good) and a quail egg. I never got my quail egg which was VERY disappointing consider that was the main reason I ordered the dish. I had never had a quail egg before and was anxious and excited about trying it for the first time. Very disappointing to see something advertised as part of a dish, pay $20 for it and not receive what you ordered and were expecting!!!! Our server was very friendly and did a fantastic job! We had a beautiful bottle of red wine and a delicious bottle of exquisite champagne. My friend had the duck and he devoured it. I wish I had ordered that instead cause it looked delicious. We had a side of fries which we had to send back because they were cold. Over all I really enjoyed myself. The decor was nice, and the staff was very friendly and accommodating.

For entrees, the favorite was the lentil dish served with a perfectly poached egg and ricotta. The cod with mushy peas was fine but not great.However, the desserts were outstanding, particularly the passion fruit panna cotta.

2.0,2/9/2015,"Bar Boulud is fine. It serves its purpose as a pre-theater meal, but prices were a little higher than the value of its food and service.My partner and I had reservations, but were left standing by the entrance for several minutes as they decided where to seat us. For a restaurant with a large front-of-the-house staff, they seemed to have a lot of trouble communicating with one another about priorities or patrons.Once we were seated, it took a long time to get water, which ended up coming after our wine and appetizers arrived. We both ordered from the Prix-Fixe menu--which is, admittedly, not a bad deal for an NYC prix-fixe French dinner. I had the pâté to start, which was fairly mediocre (lacking in fat and seasoning), and my partner had the soup, which was well-seasoned but cold. I have a special place in my heart for properly-heated soup, and was very sad to take a bite of cold puree. When the pâté was delivered to my table, the waiter tilted the plate to set it down and didn't notice that he dropped two marinated onions in my lap. The complementary bread, while nice and crusty, was also cold. Should have been kept under a heat lamp or near the kitchen. It came with butter, but we were given no knives. A couple next to us seem to have the same problem, since they kept handing their knife back and forth across the table.For the main course, I had the duck confit, and my partner had the house-made cavatelli with charred tuscan kale, hen of the wood, béchamel, parmesan cheese. The description of the cavatelli was much better than the pasta itself, which was ultimately under-seasoned and made from a poor dough. It snapped under your teeth like plastic supermarket gnocchi, and while the mushrooms were cooked well, the kale was undercooked and the sauce was bland. My duck, on the other hand, was very well cooked, and a good safety dish to remember if you ever come here. The skin was done perfectly, and it came with delicious roasted potatoes and an eggplant puree. Really nice pairing. A tad overly salty, and a bit cold, but very tasty.For dessert, I had the lemon curd with mascarpone sponge and thyme ice cream. The mascarpone I could have done without--it truly was a sponge--but the ice cream and curd were very pleasant. The ice cream in particular had great flavor. My partner had the chocolate cake with candied walnuts, caramelized pears, and maple ice cream. Ice cream was tasty, but didn't taste of maple. Should have just called it vanilla. Cake was dry and overly sweet. Taken as a whole, the meal filled us up but wasn't anywhere near as good as we had hoped, or as the prices suggest. The duck was very good, but everything had something off about it, and almost all the warm foods needed to be hotter. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone; would suggest trying somewhere else near Lincoln Center for your next pre-theater.",1,0,0,Jean-Luc B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,15,0

3.0,2/2/2015,"Expected so much better from a Daniel Boulud restaurant.  This is really a 2.5 to 3 star review.The atmosphere is tired (even for a restaurant that opened in 2008):   the menus (under plastic! Surely, you can print out paper menus ...) were wrinkled and old looking; there were food stains on the wall next our booth/table; the place mats were fraying; the wood serving tray for my dessert was water stained and peeling; my husband had spotlight shining down into his right ear/right eye; the wine stain photos along the wall were most certainly something a man thought of (no woman would something that looks like ""that"" on a wall) - although, I do like the concept; the paint duo on the wall looks dingy, etc.  This place needs someone to pay attention to details (and lots of them).I had expected the food to be better too -- it was just okay.  We ordered the prix fixe, 3 course menu.  The cheese gougeres weren't very fresh.  Not crispy, light exterior you (I) want.  These were mostly tepid to cold in temperature, a little chewy, and even a little too salty.  My squash soup had a nice, silky texture and came in a cute, small French terrine-type bowl filled to brim (I wish other places would follow this lead, as it keeps the soup warmer, longer) but it was a bit bland in flavor.  My husband's pate appetizer was just ""okay"" in his view -- it came with dry, over-toasted, bland bread (he used some of the bread from the bread basket).My poulet roti - was a chicken breast with skin and a couple of crisp, thinly sliced potatoes on top, along with a butter infused jus, a divine poached garlic and eggplant puree (and I hate eggplant) and about the ugliest looking potato slices I've seen.  The sliced potatoes were gray in color and were greasy - I didn't eat more than one bite.  The chicken was mostly dry and flavorless -- I asked for more of the garlic eggplant puree to liven it up.My husband' s homemade cavatelli with hen of the woods mushrooms, kale and a parmesan garlic sauce was just okay, as well.  The cavatelli was a little too dense, but was cooked to a nice al dente.    The cheese was unevenly distributed throughout the dish; there were too many mushrooms; it just wasn't a very well balanced dish.  it was also served way too hot when it first arrived.My husband thought his chocolate cake square with honey ice cream and pears was the best of the lot.My vanilla ice cream with caramel sauce on the side and butter cookies were fine.The wine service is weak, despite the nice wine list.  Upon ordering, the server didn't offer a sommelier and then proceeded to describe the different Burgundy regions but could not describe the specific wines (we know about the different regions).  And, the woman who came over to pour towards the end dumped the end of the bottle in my glass despite my asking her not to because ""i didn't want the dregs"".  She told me ""oh, those are ""drops from heaven"""". Huh??I specifically told her I didn't want any of the sediment.  She then replied, well there won't be any in this bottle ... well, come to the bottom of my glass there's a decent layer of sediment ... so, I showed her my glass and explained (nicely) that this was why I asked her not to pour the end of the bottle in my glass.  She then condescendingly put her arm around me and told me that that's the risk ""you take"" when ""you"" pour the end of the bottle -- brilliant! - as I told her (again) that's why I didn't want her to pour the end in my glass.  She then replied -- well, that's what our wine service does -- pour the entire bottle.  I explained that we eat at many nice restaurants and had not typically encountered such a blanket wine service ""policy""; when I told her that I felt the wine service at Bar Boulud needed improvement, I receive a snarky ""I'm terribly sorry.""  Very poor customer service, in my view.Someone should better train their wine staff (or any of their staff taking wine orders or pouring wine).  I expected much better from a restaurant owned by Mr. Boulud.The food service was fine, until the end when our server went missing for some time.With all of the great food in NYC - we won't be back.",1,1,0,Dana R.,"Seattle, WA",45,470,0

5.0,12/2/2014,"Not sure if we benefited from the last reviewer's experience (see below), but our Sunday night at Bar Bould should serve as a universal model for first-class handling of a misstep followed by awesome recovery.We arrived in the crush of post-""Nutcracker"" crowds and the sort of general crankiness you sense at the end of a four-day Thanksgiving holiday. It was a last-minute impulse; we had no reservation, but luckily got a two-seater up front.Water and bread came soon after we did. So did our waiter Will, who guided us to excellent wine and beer selections with our meal. The place was nutso busy, yet drinks arrived quickly. 15 minutes later, the entrees followed. But what's this? My husband got his perfectly cooked medium-rare burger; I got the wrong order.In an instant, waiter Will came over to apologize -- and I mean, apologize. He said he would put in a rush for my pork ravioli. Then the front-of-house manager came over and apologized. He said firmly, ""We will make it up to you.""Eight minutes later, the ravioli arrived. A word on the entrees: if you're wondering how a burger is worth $23, check out Bar Boulud's awesome heap of sirloin, raclette, pork belly plus crispy fries that melt in your mouth. The ravioli ($28) was silky and thin, filled with succulent ground pork and accompanied by a minimal savory sauce, diced butternut squash and roast walnuts. Both dishes were ample for dinner.Halfway through the meal, our waiter came by to apologize again and poured me another glass of wine, gratis. Good enough! But no, we're not done. At meal's end, he announced something else was coming -- which turned out to be a trio of sorbets (intense, smooth, low-sugar) AND floating island dessert (blancmange, vanilla sauce). Is it wrong to wish your order was mishandled here every day?We've eaten at very expensive places in this town and can't imagine better (or more munificent) atonement for a fairly small error.

3.0,11/27/2014,"I reserved a table for one for the prix fixe Thanksgiving meal at Bar Boulud, looking to treat myself when away from family on a special day. The food was spectacular, but the service was disappointing enough to turn me off from the venue in the future.After being seated at the bar despite having reserved a table in advance, I met my server (the only staff member who was earnest and wonderful during the experience) and made my order for the evening, requested my drink, and excused myself to the washroom. On returning, all sign of my setting was gone, replaced with a setting for two for a new couple waiting to be seated.I sat down, and the manager quickly approached me as though to subdue a threat, asking why I was seated and what I was doing there. I had to explain to her that I had already been seated there, that I had already ordered, and that they had taken away from me what I had been in the middle of drinking. Her response was incredibly underwhelming- a curt apology that sounded like I was inconveniencing -her- more than she was me. A tip: If your front-of-house manager is so insincere and rude when dealing with conflict that you, as a patron, fear her returning to you, your service is unforgivable. On paying my check, receiving my coat, and departing the manager avoided making eye contact and did not inquire to the meal nor give a single good word like the staff was consistently providing to the other guests. From beginning to end, I was treated like I was unwelcome.This is especially disappointing because the food overall was a VERY strong presentation! The day's soup was balanced beautifully, the turkey moister than I expected roasting could produce, and the side of stuffing brilliantly seasoned and honestly? Exciting.

1.0,11/6/2014,"Actually worth ZERO stars. Reviews of bad restaurants take time and space from reviews of good restaurants, so I have long avoided writing them except in rare circumstances when the restaurant was fraudulently cashing in on a reputation once, perhaps, earned, and then allowed to rot into ruin. People are sucked in by the old hype, and then they get treated to dreary food, insultingly poor service, and annoying vibes. We can make it short: Bar Boulud on Broadway in Manhattan is clueless, crass, careless, and ridiculously pretentious. The dining room is a cramped tunnel and architecturally cold and ugly; the furnishings are uncomfortable; the hosts are like robots, taught to talk and fake a smile but not to feel; the waiters are ill-trained, slower than escargots, ignorant about food, but in their favor, they at least have the humility to be sorry for their incompetence. The kitchen is breathtakingly mediocre, at best.As an example: a $20 half-lobster salad with aioli garlic sauce for lunch. A small lobster is boiled, allowed to sit around in liquid until all its juices and flavor run out,  the tail is cut in half (and the flesh courteously bite-size sliced, a good thing if the lobster was properly chewy, which it wasn't), and served with a small glass cup of aioli that is so bland it makes tap water taste spicy. The vegetables (small carrots, Brussels sprouts, onions, zucchini and something else unidentifiable) were fairly fresh and nicely cut but poorly par-boiled, drained of all flavor, and served in sad little piles around the plate as if nobody cared. The coffee, at $5.50 per serving, is tepid, weak, and, as with everything else, sans flavor. There is also an unpleasant and often annoying attitude about the place that strikes you as you walk in --- a feeling of people who, as they say in Michigan, are ""putting on the dog"" and serving up canned Alpo for goose liver paté and truffles. There are some really admirable French restaurants in New York City now, but Bar Boulud is not one of them. Chef Boulud ought to drop by sometime and eat what his namesake kitchen cooks up and his joint serves: he would blush with shame, if he any longer cares.",5,2,2,Barnard C.,"Manhattan, NY",46,8,2

We got a meager 3 slices of mediocre bread (toasted) with our pate. They used to have excellent, fresh bread, but I guess not after their bakery closes. None of the three waiters walking by noticed that it was by far not enough bread, and we almost felt uncomfortable to ask for more. Service took a long time till they made first contact anyway. Unfortunately, the menu isn't the same as the one online anymore, so we didn't get to try the promising corn soup. Drinks are actually really fantastic every time, but took a while to come out. We were there late and it wasn't too busy anymore, so there's no excuse. It's too sad their cocktail list is so short and changes a lot.This is obviously a great spot for after the opera - which is the 'audience' (or victims?) they count on. A little upperclassy, quasi-chic place with a nice deco. But it was my third time there and every time, something was a little bit off.

The best parts were the bread and the dessert - but we soon realised that my friend's dessert (blueberry marmalade with mascarpone mousse and thyme) was missing a component.

3.0,7/2/2014,"Bar Boulud is a restaurant and watering hole across Broadway from Lincoln Center, which aims to attract the chic and would-be chic. Thus, it offers delicious food, in diminutive portions, at elevated prices. Service varies from attentive to neglectful. Our waiter, for example, gave us good service -- whenever he was able to tear himself away from two attractive young women who were seated at the far end of the bar -- that is. The cuisine could best be described as French precious. Boudin noir, for example, was nothing like the well-stuffed blood sausages one remembers from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana. Here, the dish consisted of three small, garnished, too-soft, blood-based blobs. Beef cheek terrine was solid and satisfying. A dish of veal cooked two ways plus sweetbreads was tasty but small. A side order of tomatoes (4 thick slices), requested by our companion -- who was disappointed not to find tomatoes in her salad -- was delivered reluctantly for $9. The wine-by-the glass list was OK but limited. Desserts were the strong suit here. Fortunately, whatever background music was playing was unobtrusive.

The food was lovely, from the breadbasket (the French really do know the value of good butter) to the Coq au Vin (which I finally learned how to pronounce). Prices were high, as I expect from a Daniel Boulud restaurant near Lincoln Center. However, for the price of the menu items, I feel like I should have received much better service. Our server was absent for long periods of time, a few things we requested were not brought, and I did not get the heart-aflutter feeling that I got at Daniel.

5.0,6/26/2014,"Fantastic prix fixe menu.  Very balanced.  Great work bringing out the flavors in the ingredients rather than creating complex new ones.  The creamy corn soup was the perfect cold summer soup, playing on the buttery and silky nature of corn and controlling its sweetness to let its natural flavor shine through.  The salmon entree with simple baby vegetables executed with technique and great produce.  The gateau de pistache au citron might have been the highlight of the meal.  Great texture, beautiful presentation, delicate, but with more complex and multifaceted aromas than the rest of the meal.  For $45, a very solid dining experience in a casual and relaxed setting.  (A little sidenote regarding another reviewer's mention that this restaurant is not a good option for pescatarians and vegetarians.  The prix fixe had one pescatarian and one vegetarian appetizer and entree option.  I asked the waiter if any of these dishes had meat not disclosed in the menu and they didn't.)",1,0,0,Kelly S.,"Concord, MA",7,71,4

Nothing incredible though.Appetizer - The country pate on toasted bread was pretty good. The pate was more of a solid, hard cake than the paste I was used to, but it was still good (although not the most flavorful pate I've had).Main - The croque monsieur was really good. The bechamel cheese they use really complements the house-made ham. This is grilled cheese on another level. My friend had the quiche, which was also amazing.Dessert - The Ile Fottante was good, and a nice, light finish to the meal.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this place to someone unless ""money"" is just a vague concept of some large numbers to you. There was nothing wrong with any of the courses, but nothing stood out as being mind-blowing - you can find a good quiche at a bakery, and the croque monsieur, while amazing, is merely a (well-made) grilled ham and cheese sandwich.

1.0,6/19/2014,"Everyone in our party had been to Bar Boulud previously and had good experiences. Unfortunately, between the abysmal service and mediocre food, none of us will be returning.As soon as we arrived, we were told we would be seated immediately as they were already setting up a table. However, as we were being led to our table, we were stopped in our tracks by another staff member and were rudely told to go back to the front. We could hear her say that she wanted the walk-in party that had arrived after us to be seated at our table ""in the front"" and to put us at another table in the back. I'm not sure if it was because he was a prominent person (he was) or just a regular, but we stood awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant and waited as they sorted it out and yes, put us in the back. It wasn't that we minded where we sat; we just thought it was rude that they would stop us in the middle of being seated to blatantly give away our table to another party - that had arrived after us - and was clearly a priority. If they wanted to do that, they really should have been more discreet and communicated better amongst themselves in the first place.The service didn't really improve after that: while we appreciate that our water glasses were constantly being filled (by someone other than our server), we were hardly able to get the attention of our server to ask for anything else. And our dishes were salty, save for one, which happened to be bland. Very disappointing and way overpriced for what it is.I'm not sure why the food and service have gone downhill, but it really is too bad.

3.0,5/21/2014,"Perhaps it was foolish of me to suggest dinner at Bar Boulud, especially during Restaurant Week; having already been to a range of Daniel Boulud's restaurants, from his three-Michelin star flagship to the pared down db bistro moderne, I should have known that there wasn't much that could have surprised me. But when opportunity calls, who can turn down an invitation to dinner? Thus, on a weekday after work, a few friends and I headed towards the UWS, curious to see what the restaurant would offer.There's something startlingly tunnel-like about the dining room; the majority of the seating is against one elongated passageway, which has the bar one one side and a row of tables on the other. While there are some tables spread out towards the front and back of the restaurant, it's a layout that clearly came about more for utility than for aesthetics. It's nonetheless a relaxing environment, one that guests can feel comfortable entering, whether they're wearing jeans and a t-shirt or business formal attire. We were promptly seated on time for our reservation and after a quick skim of the menu (most of us had already researched it prior), we made our orders with ease.After a few starting bites of bread, the meal began with the Soupe de Pois Cassés. The peas had been puréed to a creamy, almost silky consistency and topped with a bacon-infused cream and a wafer-like cracker, it was a simple, yet satisfying bowl, perfect for the chilly weather. I also have to give credit for the fact that it was neither over nor under-seasoned, an easy thing to do when making soup in large batches.The entrée, the Onglet de Boeuf Grillé, kept to the same trajectory as the prior course. The dish featured a portion of grilled hanger steak layered over sautéed market greens and a side of roasted yukon gold potatoes; the steak, while cooked to the requested medium, was a little too dry and sinewy. I was also thrown off by the market greens, which were served whole and became quite a feat to cut and layer onto a fork. The addition of a ""diable"" sauce, which hinted strongly of Worcestershire sauce and white wine, was a nice touch, complementing the beef well.And for dessert, the Crème Fraîche Gâteau was an obvious choice for me. Presented in a thin rectangular strip, it inserted a layer of meyer lemon crémeux into the hazelnut dacquoise base; a dotting of toasted hazelnuts on top and a scoop of Torrone ice cream on the side finished off the dish. The meyer lemon was a much needed contrast of acidity against the other heavier elements, and as a whole, the dessert was well-balanced and a reliable fall-back for those that didn't wish to order the chocolate mousse or the sorbet.In hindsight, Bar Boulud might be best considered as a pre or post-theater meal given its proximity to the Lincoln Center. While there wasn't anything particularly memorable or outstanding about the dishes I tried, that isn't to say that the meal fell short, either. There are times a dependable, reliable restaurant is the best option and in that respect, Bar Boulud fits the bill precisely.",10,5,4,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

Since I'm cutting back on dairy, when I asked for no cheese with my omelette, the waiter asked me if I had a dairy allergy. Then he was really considerate and came over to suggest another dish. I ended up getting the seared tuna salad. The fish tasted fresh and was nicely crisp on the outside and slightly cooked on the inside. The watercress and avocado tasted fresh as well.

1.0,4/3/2014,"I was so ready to like this place because it is convenient to travel to, the hostesses were cute and accommodating and the interior reminded me of BUTTER --- I love an arch. But alas, the food and the service were less than underwhelming.Came here a few months ago (I think around March 21st):Our wait to even have our drink orders taken was significant enough to give me and my dinner companion (who happens to be a medical professional) the chance to determine that the art work on the walls resembled troubling melanomas, which is not something one wants to think about before eating a meal.When our server --- I think her name was Katie but she looked like a Becky-Sue --- finally did arrive, she promptly took my drink order and returned with a half-emptied low-ball glass of what was supposed to be my amaretto sour.Of course I looked at her like she just landed on the planet because she essentially served me a drink that looked like it was already enjoyed by someone else's lips!She explained herself saying, ""Oh no one drank your drink, this is how the bartender measures the drink in the glass; everything is measured in the correct proportions.""Clearly Becky-Sue aint had a clue who she was talkin' to.Amaretto Sours are my signature drink: I always order it when I dine, so I know what it's supposed to look like when it is presented to my eyeballs. I was highly insulted because it appeared as though Becky-Sue was trying to play with my intelligence, trying to pass-off a half-drunk drink to me and then had the nerve to expect me to pay full-price for it.Becky-Sue messed with the right one. I told her, ""OK, I'm not drinking a drink that looks like it was drunk by someone else. I don't know if you or the bartender took a few swigs before you brought this to me, but you can take this back to the bartender and be sure to remove it from my bill.""In situations like this, I would normally summon management, but I did not want to make too much of a scene. My inquisitive nature afforded me intel behind the shoddy, curt and downright rude service from Becky-Sue.Apparently, BS ---what fitting initials for her--- was scheduled to leave Bar Boulud permanently in 4-days, hence her ""give less than a damn"" attitude about the service she was rendering customers, namely me.

4.0,3/19/2014,"This review is for brunch only. We went in a group of 5 on sunday for brunch. I was meeting up with a school friend after a really long time. Ambience and Decor: Nice place to spend your sunday morning. The atmosphere was very vibrant yet relaxing. We were seated in the back area. Food:I took the 3-course prix fixe. Its for $32 and is a steal at that price. A-la carte menu seemed a bit pricey. In addition to the 3 courses, they also offer a croissant and coffee. I ll take that! I order the granola (pretty good, gulped it down in 3 mins), croque madame (oh my god so delicious), and the almond pastry (meh, could have done without). We ordered the bread basket for the table (its good, though i have had better croissants and pain au chocolat). My friends ordered the frittata (they thought it was pretty yummy) and le boucheron (looked extremely nice and is going to be my order next time i visit). 3 out of 4 people (other than the one who ordered) were eyeing it like anything. Hubby was not eating eggs that day, so he ordered just cheese. Very few (only cheese, fruit dessert and granola) options are available for non-egg eating vegetarians. I wouldn't go there if I am one.  Drinks: They had freshly squeezed orange juice and it was very yummy. Sometimes, I order freshly squeezed juice and it doesnt feel like it really is fresh or even freshly squeezed. They seemed to have a good selection of cocktails. Service: Nothing to talk about. The waiter was ok, a little uptight. They did allow 2 of my friends to take a seat before the rest of us arrived, which was nice of them. Summary: My overall rating is higher than the yelp rating. That says a lot, given i am a strict reviewer and would generally rate either at par with or below yelp rating. So, this says a lot.

However, I'm slowly realizing that in reality - my friends and I are actually barbarians who chat loudly and cackle like hyenas, so we knew we couldn't stay.

3.0,2/26/2014,"It was for the 1950's, guitar-like romantic music that gave me a company in my lunch at the tunnel-structured, relaxing space of the French modern bistro of Bar Boulud.  I was escorted to my titan wooden table and chair, after a smile from the hostess that welcomed my presence.  The decor with its theatrical dimmed lighting hinted for a pleasant nap to the mind from the forever busy chic life on the Upper West Side's sidewalks.  The space utterly spoke for the romance of Paris and the vibrant, yet classy, modernity of Manhattan.The Salad De Cresson--watercress, poached leeks, cucumber, tarragon and shallot dressing--was well deserved.  I like my salad to have the right amount of dressing; i.e. not too dry, and not soggy by all means, and that was what I was served.   The tanginess and smokiness of the combination allured my appetite into breaking the social roles to dip the heavenly bread, which was served with a side of butter, into the remains of dressing, pushing the presence of an Italian attitude of enjoying left-over sauces.  And the poached leeks were nothing but an amusing affair!     I did not know what to expect from a silver top cover placed over my entrée that had not been lifted, since I was in the men's room (excuse moi!) that was stylish in its cottage-y, Japanese-like minimalistic vibe.  There I arrived to the table, and there was my Gnocchi De Carottes reveled.  The intense army-like green color of the pasta with hints of orange-y looking sauce, freshly appearing carrots and scattered chickpeas--some were fully cooked, while others were crisped--made the dish feel just as another meal served while enjoying a cozy night at home before a favorite T.V. show.  After my first bite to the gooey gnocchi, my taste buds forced the departure of the aforementioned feeling and the arrival of a brilliant main course.  The mellow, yet tasty pasta was supported by the powerful presence of its semi-hard chickpeas, and the visiting sweetness of the carrots.  The light spicy kick at the back of the throat, together with what felt to be a sauce made with orange and herbs--among other things--was the right closing to each and every bite.  The much enjoyed visit could have been completed with more stability of table host availability-which seemed to have changed every five minutes depending on convenience, and with serving the chocolate tart without the clear taste of egg whites and lemon that was presented through the creamy dots topping the dessert.  On another front, the lemon sorbet could have been served right after the main and before serving the dessert (for taste changing purposes, of course), rather than having it neighboring the chocolate cake.(Review of Bar Boulud Lunch Visit on Tuesday, February 18th, 2014.  The Review Should Read as 3.5 Stars).",1,0,0,Victory O.,"Manhattan, NY",5,15,217

2.0,2/24/2014,Having just come off of two spectacular meals at Boulud Sud I had high hopes. But this was one disappointment after another. First the only table they would offer us was right up front on the aisle where the waiters and busboys constantly walked by. There were half a dozen booths available in the back but they made us wait 20 minutes before they would give us one. And when we left there were dozens of empty tables and booths. No idea why they made us wait. This was restaurant week...three courses... and like I did at Boulud Sud on Valentines Day and again at lunch during restaurant week I asked if I could choose my dessert after the meal. Nope ...I was forced to choose up front. The appetizers were not veggie friendly (I eat fish but not meat) so I had only one choice ...the salad. It was quite tasty. The bread was decent but not great. The main course was a choice between a pasta and fish and chips. I went with the fish and it was really mediocre. My boyfriend had the pasta and it was tasty but not spectacular. The desserts were also good but not great and actually too large. The waitress was sweet but very amateurish for a fancy restaurant. The bill... $118 + tax and tip. His cocktail was $19 and my wine was $14. And the wine was pretty poor. All in all...the kind of meal you walk out of feeling really stupid for spending so much money. But Boulud Sud was exactly the opposite.. I couldn't wait to try it again. Oh well...live and learn.,0,0,0,Beth Z.,"New York, NY",0,10,4

4.0,2/9/2014,"#foodiechats This French bistro didn't disappoint.  They boast a nose to tail menu. I didn't see any tails on it, but the venison and the duck breast looked appealing.  Our plates came out looking very...empty.I order venison and duck a lot, so I have a lot of places to compare these dishes against. The duck breast: huge plate with 4 delicious chunks of duck breast, placed diagonally with a lot of distance between them.  It gave me this slight feeling that they split one dish into two. Visually speaking.  The skin was missing, which I think was a flaw, but not everyone can crisp that skin to perfection. I feel that the chef was well trained, but lacked the boldness and imagination of young chefs who are not afraid to cook outside the box.  I have no idea how old is this chef though, it's just a feeling.The venison: perfectly cooked, presented in a similar way, same half a dish feeling. It was $38 and I also thought I have no complaints against the taste, I've seen better. The pate was good. The bread was excellent. The wine they suggested with our dishes, $21/glass was actually delicious, as it should've been for that price tag.  The waiters were slightly pretentious. For no reason really, this place is no Bouley. But not many places are, so.The dessert was good, but honestly I can't even remember it now to describe it.  So for $192 we had:  an appetizer to share, duck breast, venison, two desserts, two glasses of wine (all for me) and two lemonades. Oh, and one decalf coffee than initially came out lukewarm, but they promptly exchanged it.Overall I liked it and I would go back.  #yum",1,1,0,Ruxi V.,"New York, NY",69,164,168
5.0,1/29/2014,I love coming to this modern French bistro. They have some of the best charcuterie and pate in the city and some classic dishes. I always get the Frisée Lyonaisse salad--takes me right back to a summer trip to Lyon in five years ago. They have a very intriguing wine list and big bottle pour nights where the sommelier selects older wines from magnum and pours them by the glass for guests.

3.0,1/21/2014,"Bar Boulud is the kind of place you'd wish you could give a higher rating but is unable to.I love the premise of this place, where else outside France can you find a place specializing in pâtés (and Charcuteries). It's lunch at the time when I'm visiting this place and I'm having a hearty slice of pâté grand-père and a glass of Pinot Noir. It's marvelous in its simplicity. The pâté has just the right meatyness and is served with pickled onion and cucumber as it should.  I'm sitting at the looong counter which I identified as a bar when coming in but is essentially just a display case for different delicacies being served.While this is an interesting touch it does become a little impersonal staring into a display case while eating. Where's my sympathetic bartender dropping little nuggets of info on how the pâté is made and stored? Those moments are why I dine solo many times of the week.When it comes time to take my almost cleaned plate however a server drops some food from it in my lap and the bag under my chair. He offers a reply which I'm to taken aback to even acknowledge. This is something that just can't happen at a Daniel Boulud place. It's the very reason why I pay $20 for a slice of pâté and a glass of wine a piece. I am however in no mood to get anyone fired, when these things happens it's an issue for the restaurant rather than an individual. I note my messy experience on the check (which also gets a mere 15% tip). It's too bad that the service let's down the otherwise unique experience Bar Boulud offers.

3.0,1/12/2014,"So this place is supposed to be really upscale and chic because it's one of Daniel Bouluds restaurants. However I am sad to report that I was not impressed. I went about two months ago, towards he very beginning of fall when it was still kind of warm out. It was sunny and we tried to get patio seating (which I admit looked really nice, especially since this restaurant is located on the posh upper west side), but they didn't have any availability. We sat on one of the booths inside, which was pretty nice and roomy. The decor was very modern with clean cut wood finishes, and had a tunnel-like feel since the space is fairly narrow. The interior was very clean and everything seemed sanitary, so their A grade was well deserved.What I didn't like about this place as the service and price. We came at around 2pm for Sunday brunch, and it had already cleared out by then and was pretty empty inside. However, the waiter took so long to come take our drink and food orders, which was kind of ridiculous because it's not like he had something better to do with his time. The food was good I admit, but for the price, it wasn't anything extraordinary. I got the salad Niçoise, and although it was very fresh, there wasn't anything that spoke out about it. The bread was good though. So eat all of it and ask the waiter for more. I didn't eat any dessert, so I can't really comment on that, but I can say that this place is mediocre at best for the kind of price range and class if restaurants it is competing against.",1,0,0,Sara Y.,"Encinitas, CA",183,60,158

When I requested New glasses he made a face and dropped the bottle heavily on the table.  I was extremely embarrassed to have subjected my guests (one of which is a foreign dignitary) to such amateur behaviour.  For a place presenting itself as a fine restaurant, it appears that they have very low standards for their house management and wait staff training.  As a New Yorker I am always repulsed when attitude like this shows itself unexpectedly.   You never know who you might be serving and in this case, by being discreet and not informing the management of my guest's prominence, we were given a truly unacceptable experience undeserving for any paying customer.  I can't recommend Bar Boloud on any level.",16,0,2,W K.,"New York, NY",0,12,1

The service is usually pretty good, the wine list is fanstastic and features wines from different regions the world over providing a good breadth of options, and the food is solid French food. The charcuterie in particular is what keeps me coming back. Last week was a little off - it was Monday evening and there were four of us and it wasn't particularly busy. We ordered the large charcuterie plate to share, which featured 90% terrine and pates rather than actual cured meats, but no bother. We took a while to graze on this plate as we chatted and drank the wine, and didn't really notice the waiter loitering hoping to take the plate away. Turns out the entrees had been clearly sitting in the kitchen for a while because they were all lukewarm when they arrived and not as good as I had hoped.

Instead, we were left with a smartass recent college grad who seemed incredulous that the restaurant could make a mistake. 1.  Our entrees of the lamb duo and steak frite were lukewarm at best, with our simple side of sautéed mushrooms arriving well after we had finished eating. 2. I had called the restaurant an hour prior to our arrival to notify them that we would be celebrating my girlfriend's birthday. They noted, and assured that our desserts would hold a candle and some sort of birthday greeting spelled in chocolate or icing of what have you. Our desserts arrived without such, and when I approached the maître d', he said that he note was indeed In the system with our reservation. Obviously there is little to no communication and thus emphasis on the guest at this restaurant. Though you may leave having spent $500 on a dinner, you feel as important as an Applebee's customer. The maître d' said he could send another dessert, which misses the point entirely. He was snooty, and unapologetic.3. When they sent two glasses of champagne that I suggested as a peace-offering, it was warm, and he overflowed one of the glasses. Not only did he not apologize, but he did not even remove or clean the glass off. This place needs some serious adult supervision. I think savvy New Yorkers will continue to haunt the more reputable Boulud restaurants (again, Cafe Boulud!) while this place will remain an oasis for tourists, Columbus Circle workers too tired to search farther for a decent meal, and NYC ungulates who wouldn't know decent dining if Thomas Keller foie gras'ed in their face.",4,4,0,Tony G.,"Financial District, NY",6,47,3
3.0,9/7/2013,The 4 course brunch was good but far from say the quality at Maison Kayser. The Croque Madame was not half as good as Kayser's and was heavily laden with too much cheese. The pâté was very average -- not the kind that tastes great but rather like one purchased over the counter at a supermarket! The hi lite was the dessert a sorbet with a mixture of other ingredients. The waitress had no personality and behaved as if we were doing her a favor by being there. This is too bad because $90 bucks for a brunch for 2 without alcohol is a bit pricy for average food and below average service.,0,0,0,Babs S.,"Hartville, OH",0,6,0

2.0,6/30/2013,"Highly unimpressed.Upon asking the waiter's opinion between the lamb and the prefix with the pasta he said something along the lines of the prefix being good because of the prices but that the pasta is just pasta and cheese whereas the lamb is lamb and its really good. That didn't really help but when I go to what I think will be a great place I usually would like to choose lamb over a pasta dish. The bread service was tasty, although, there was a tiny bug on my plate. That could happen anywhere, I suppose, though. I got the lamb and a side of asparagus. 5 minutes after I ordered the lamb I realized I hadn't told the waiter how I wanted it cooked. Upon that thought, in coincidence, he came over and asked me. The lamb itself was very good - nothing too special, though - and the portion wasn't that great for $34. The sauce, the beans and the greens surrounding it were good, nothing special. Together with the lamb, good. Not great. The side of asparagus was surprisingly flavorless. I always try to refrain from sending a dish back to the kitchen. I don't enjoy doing it. I wasn't going to eat the asparagus, though. I couldn't find my waiter for 5 minutes so I grabbed a different waiter to send it back. 10 minutes later, after I was all done with my lamb, the waiter came up and asked me about the asparagus (and offered desert). That's way too long of a wait. He properly took it off the bill, though. I got the tiramisu for desert that came with a scoop of coffee ice cream. Tiramisu is my favorite desert if done right. IT was good but again nothing special. It was a bit too tart and I properly wouldn't have cared for it with out the coffee ice cream. The empty desert with my napkin and utensils sat in front of me for almost5 minutes was several bus boys aimlessly wandered back and forth until finally one of the bus boys pointed out to another that it was obvious I needed to be cleared of my dirty dishes. It didn't seem that busy especially for the large amount of servers and backservers that were on shift. Although, maybe they were occupied with other busy work. Who knows... The service was slow. Bottom line. I barely saw my waiter. My check including tip was just about $60 and that didn't include that $9 side of asparagus. I didn't feel full or satisfied at all.

1.0,6/9/2013,"Went here for a group dinner on June 8th.  We will NOT be going back. Having been to Daniel multiple times, I think mr Baloud should be ashamed of the lack of quality in both the food and service at this place.Food:Our food was terrible. We ordered the tater tot special for an appetizer and also got the mussels. The tater tots were awful my elementary school had better tater tots. The mussels were not good either, the broth lacked flavor of any kind.The main courses were even worse. 2 people had the steak frites, which was probably the best thing on the menu, but mediocre at best. Steak was cooked well but was not a quality cut of meat.  I ordered the pork leg wrapped in bacon and it was just not that good.My friends ordered the merlu, which is a white fish and the coc au vin. The coc au vin was terrible. No seasoning or flavor, tasted only like the wine they soaked it in. But the fish was probably the worst thing on the menu. My friend asked the waiter which fish was the least fishy and he suggested the merlu. It was fishy, lacked seasoning and when it was clear that she didn't like it, the waiter did nothing about it. Which brings me to service. Our waiter was mediocre.  Not that friendly and not that attentive. When it's clear that someone doesn't like a dish (like the merlu) he should have done something about it and he didn't.In any event, do not go here for dinner.

3.0,6/8/2013,"A bit disappointed with Bar Boulud, due to the Daniel Boulud affiliation and my prior experiences with Cafe Boulud and Daniel (both offer phenomenally prepared foods and above first rate service although the two have important differences distinguishing the two).Bar Boulud is uneven in where it excels and fails.The good.The wine list is amazing, and upon sitting down they offered by the glass a Montrachet that was very good to amazing and not something one would expect to purchased, ""by the glass"". Also good was the Pennsylvania trout that was crispy an cooked just right.Bar Boulud also gets top marks for serving a coffee that was hot and delicous.The bad.I had to twice request lemon to go with water.Repeatedly had to inquire from the  waiter what kind of trout the Pennsylvania trout special was( specifically the species).  First time he left , came back  responding that the trout was farmed and not wild. It took two attempts to learn it was Brook Trout and not Rainbow Trout.The side dish accompanying the trout was overly creamy and detracted from the excellent fish.Summary. The food is good, perhaps a little better than good. It is not great, and the service while OK is not anything close to what one may associated with Chef Daniel Boulud. While this restaurant is less formal than Daniel and even Cafe Boulud, the staff is still expected to provide requested items, know the menu and to provide coffee and desert at roughly the same time(coffee came well after desert was completely finished.If this was another restaurant my opinion would have been higher, but considering that Daniel should be in this restaurant's DNA, I expected more. I had thought this would be a less formal version of Cafe Boulud but otherwise the same high standards regarding service and food preparation.  This is now my 3rd Daniel Boulud experience.

Unfortunately my experience at Bar Boulud this weekend changed that and by the star rating you already know it's not a glowing review...We decided to try Bar Boulud after a good friend of mine who visits NYC frequently kept raving about their ""Steak Frites"". All in all the food was OK but nothing spectacular, especially considering two people spent over $200 (including tip).Apeptizers:-Rillons (Pork Belly): Nothing Special, simply seared.-3 Cheese Plate: Really can't go wrong with cheeses, though small portions.-Grand Pere (Pate): Average.Main Course:-Steak Frites: Fries weren't bad, steak was ok.-Duck Duo: Duck was cooked fairly well.Sides:-Side of Asparagus: Again nothing special.Wine:-A bottle of Beaujolais: Great taste and obviously marked well above retail price just like any other restaurant. The food definitely did not ""wow"" us and we were expecting way better.My real complaint is with the service. At first, it was pretty solid (though as noted by other reviewers lacked personality), until our waitress ""disappeared"". By disappeared I mean she kept ""interacting"" with her fellow co-workers by the server station and became less attentive. It got to the point that a young man dressed in a suite who I'm assuming was one of the managers had to clear our table since he realized we had finished our main course a long time ago. Keep in mind the restaurant was no where close to being full. Since the service was dreadful we skipped dessert and asked for the bill which considering how slow the service had been was delivered rather quickly. The bill reflected the correct amount and as such I promptly handed over my credit card. When my credit card receipt arrived we noticed my credit card had been charged $76 dollars less than the original amount. At first we were under the impression that management had realized the poor service and comped our check since a manager had brought us our credit card receipt. However, my moral/ethical compass pointed north and I felt obliged to notify them of this discrepancy. I informed our waitress who was conveniently no longer missing in action. She quickly acknowledged that it was a mistake, stating ""that's not even your table!"" in a rather bothered tone and happily took my credit card to swiple a second time. During the whole exchange she didn't even thank us ONCE for being honest or having the decency of not walking out after having already signed the original credit card receipt. I know some restaurants will charge their employees for any ""forgotten"" items and if that's the case with Bar Boulud our honesty saved her $76 so a quick ""Thank you"" would have gone a long way.

5.0,2/17/2013,"Went here for dinner last night as a party of six. Everything was incredibly delicious, from the well-chosen flight of white wines to the impressive desert menu. I started off with a beet salad which was superb-- the ratio of arugula to beets to cheese was spot-on. Maybe it wasn't the most exciting appetizer they offered (everything on the menu looked so good!) but it really delivered.Perhaps ordering chicken isn't the most common thing to do at a French restaurant, but the chicken here is incredible-- quite possibly the best chicken I've ever eaten. I've been to a lot of excellent restaurants, too. Dessert was perfect as well. I ordered the Cocoban which was some sort of chocolate mousse with bananas and a bit of a warm sauce served in a glass bowl. I didn't think I'd be able to finish it because I was so full, but I managed to!Ambiance was nice. It would definitely be a good date spot.They also offered a $45 Pre-Fixe menu which is surprisingly affordable, although nothing on it interested me so I opted to order course-by-course. They offer a wine list that is so impressive it has an Index, and the staff are all very knowledgeable in wines (albiet a bit confused with liqueur and spirits) and were very friendly.I definitely recommend this spot!",1,2,0,Emily C.,"New York, NY",16,25,3

4.0,2/4/2013,"It's funny, the more I come here, the more I like it.  Bar Boulud is a very ""Metropolis""-feeling wine bar; long and skinny with an arched ceiling reminiscent of a subway tunnel.  Lighting is good, background music is great.  Food and wine is excellent.  Service is generally excellent.A bottle of house sparkling water with oysters and chablis to start, followed by the truly fantastic escargot - the little sweet ones, garlicky and stunning to look, switching to pinot noir.  Another gorgeous plating of bream for my young man, which tasted as good as it looked, and brown butter risotto with truffles for me since I cannot resist either, ever.  Every night they open a large format bottle here of something special to offer by the glass, and unfortunately, on this evening it was an oaked Napa chardonnay, which is not my thing so I didn't get in on it.Should have gotten the cheese to finish.  I love the cheese, but went with the mandarin and bitter almond tart instead.  It was good.  Really.  But I really should have gotten cheese.  The young gentleman was very approving of his dessert - ""Yum!"".  I think it had hazelnuts in it.  I definitely should have ordered some cheese.",0,0,0,Bechi C.,"Howell, NJ",25,83,25

The pate's flavor reminded me of oscar meyer bologna with some extra spices added with the texture of mashed potatos and all my friends agreed that I was spot on, LOL. I dont think the cornichons and mustard on the side did it any justice. The syrah wine sauce on the fish and leeks was good, nothing to complain about but again--nothing special or worth coming back for. Chocolate torte was too dense for my liking, also came with coffee ice cream. I wish it were vanilla ice cream or something lighter instead.

Only after mention to manager was it replaced. They did comp our 1 dessert. Frankly, for a place of fine dining and strong reputation this experience was a total negative. Is Bar Boulud trending to mediocrity or this night a one off? I suspect the latter as in a night not too busy all servers were off, coupled with poor food. We will pass on this place for some time now. Too bad as I really liked this place. Too many other great restaurants in NYC to frequent that more than match this place for food and service.

2.0,1/3/2013,"Came to Boulud for NYE and while there were a couple bright spots, there's no way the food or service justified the $300 a person we ended up spending.The 5 course price fix menu began with a single fishy-tasting oyster (not the oysterS) that they advertised plus a small portion of caviar and some sort of bread thing. The second course was a pretty decent soup with some good cuts of meat and a foie gras ravioli. However by this stage in the game the wait staff started bugging us to see if we were finished. I'm all for attentiveness but having the same 3 people come around twice each in ten minutes is overkill. Needless to say by the time our third course arrived, we were a mere 30 minutes into the meal. This is where things really went down hill. Our poached Dover sole turned out to be some sort of unfresh tasting, compressed, soggy fish hot dog. Gave it a couple bites to see if in fact I was missing something and no, it truly was one of the worst things both of us had ever eaten. It was a good thing we were being rushed from course to course because that dish couldn't have been cleared sooner. Both the venison and the filet ended up being good and the last good part of the night. The dessert was pretty average and the drinks were good as well. I'd have to say the icing on the cake of an otherwise shitty evening was the 20% gratuity added on to our bill. It would be one thing if we had six people in our party, but we just had two. I think they realized how bad their service was and wanted to make sure we didn't stiff them (which we wouldn't have anyway).Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this tourist trap and try Dovetail or Telepan if you're looking for a good meal at a decent price on the UWS.",1,0,0,Erin H.,"New York, NY",0,6,0

A few years ago, I loved this one pinot noir from williamette valley on their list, this time around (end of 2012), the Savigny-sur-Baume red burgundy was amazing. soft, round, well balanced.Bar Boulud has a lot of the specialties from Lyon, definitely worth it to try some of the charcuterie, sausages, and meat-oriented dishes. Some of my favorites-- warm sausage with lentils (had something similar in paris/lyon but never with this particular combination, love the lentil balance to the somewhat fatty sausages). comfort food. -- lamb cavatelli -- chocolate pear tart. two friends of mine thought they would only have one small bite but couldn't help it but devour the dessert with me because it was that good. somewhat rich without the overly sweetness of the american desert. a couple of thin caramelized biscuit perched vertically on top of the soft tart to give an elegant look of the desert. great presentation and amazing taste.-- the free cheese brioche they brought out in the beginning of the meal is one of my favorites. airy, light, small, with a bit of herb. Just perfect.avoid the pork belly dish -- it was overly salty and not ""melting in your mouth"" as in cafe storico or momofuku noodle bar (or the one at Izakaya Sozai in San Francisco). the waiter should let people know that this is a dish to be eaten with bread and the salty nature of the dish.",1,0,0,Rebecca C.,"San Francisco, CA",679,839,2164

Very surprised that a Daniel Boulud restaurant would simply place them on the table without having the pepper added by the server. I mistakenly used the salt shaker since they looked identical.  So I now added more salt to my food. When I complained to the manager the response was ""I'm very sorry about that"" and also referred to them being more casual  then Daniel on the East side, so in other words do it  yourself for salt and pepper like a diner.  Really not acceptable at $100.00 a plate. Nor did they try to accommodate with a drink or coffee. Not a pleasurable experience since my food was now salted out and dry.

4.0,10/4/2012,"I had wanted to try all of Daniel Boulud's restaurants, but had always been a bit weary of how the experience would turn out.  Allow me to explain.  I simply loved db Bistro the few times that I had visited, but was very disappointed by DBGB.  While db had a stuffy vibe, the food was whimsical, creative, and delicious.  However, I found DBGB to have the more lighthearted atmosphere but mediocre food.  Well, Bar Boulud wound up packing all of the positive aspects into one fabulous space.  The dining room was buzzing with a gorgeous, elite crowd at 11 pm on a Friday evening.  The space was modern and elegant, and even possessed a basement wine cellar that could be booked for private parties.  Though we were seated at a tiny two-top right behind the hostess, this did not take away from my overall experience.I began with a glass of the Domaine Mardon, ""Cuvée Très Vieilles Vignes"", Quincy 2010, which was a fragrant white wine similar to a Sancerre.  It gave off more than a grassy taste than I typically like, but was still enjoyable.  My beverage was accompanied by the complimentary gougeres (cheese biscuits) and a basket of artisan-style breads, which included everything from olive rolls to slices of French bread.  As an appetizer, I sampled the Tagine Dagneau Charcuterie plate.  This fluffy pate was composed of slow-cooked leg of lamb, eggplant, and sweet potato.  In theory, this sounded like one of the most unusual spreads that I had ever heard of, but I sadly found it lacking in flavor; there was no real punch.  French Cornichons, grain mustard, and raisin toast were the standard accessories.In terms of the entrees, there was no easy choice, so it took me quite some time before I actually decided on my dish.  The Canard Roti was three large slices of perfectly roasted Hudson Valley duck breast, which remained tender and moist, despite its expertly crisped skin.  The game bird was topped with a trail of mix of sweet cherries and crisp almonds.  However, the sweetness was balanced by the earthy additions of baby bok choy, chanterelle mushrooms, and a pepper jus.  The flavors were complex yet properly layered.  I also tried a bite of the Jambon from the Nose-to-Tail menu.  This herb-crusted confit leg of pork was served with a light pesto sauce and accompanied by squash, black olives, and zucchini.On a whole, the meal was simply wonderful.  I love the straight-forward, refined flavors that were delivered in the comfortable and energetic environment.  The prices might be considered rather exorbitant for an everyday dinner, but I found them a complete steal given the quality of the experience.",3,3,1,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

4.0,8/4/2012,"Bar Boulud is a food snob's paradise. I always feel spoiled when I eat here. Brunches are especially delightful. Read the menu before your make reservations. The French can be intimidating for those who are unfamiliar. People with food allergies should be careful and double check the ingredients with the kitchen/manager. The servers are knowledgeable and offer great recommendations. If you choose to sit outside, avoid tables closest to the sidewalk. A passerby's dog  tried to eat food off the bread plate. It was so embarrassing. The portions are small yet plentiful. Because the food is so flavor rich/intense with  sometimes heavy ingredients, the only way to enjoy them is in small portions.

3.0,8/1/2012,"First I must disclose I am a huge fan of Daniel Boulud. I own all books except Braise...(what can I say I don't like to braise things?), have been most of his restaurants, and have even watched the two seasons of After Hours. It pains me to say this but Bar Boulud was underwhelming. But first the positives! I came here last weekend with my boyfriend for brunch. I really like eating al fresco so I where ever there is outdoor seats, I am a happy girl. We were seated promptly and our waiter was very attentive if sometimes in a bit of a rush. Butter was room temperature and the bread was expectedly good. We had the head cheese and it was very tasty. We had our slice with the regular bread instead of the toasted multigrain. Now onto the underwhelming part, if anyone in NYC can make a mean croquet monsieur or Madame, it should be Daniel Boulud. Not so, I had the Madame, BF has the monsieur. The bread was so soggy and the béchamel made it even gummier. I was hoping for something thin and crispy not giant and slightly soggy. Although I appreciated some of the burnt cheese...love crispy pieces and the light salad, it didn't make up for the sandwich. If you get the sandwich, you should probably split it. We were so full we didn't get the floating meringue dessert. Should have just gone to Boulud Sud!",2,0,0,Lucy Z.,"Manhattan, NY",9,107,0

1.0,7/18/2012,"Hate to give 1 star but the whole experience was unacceptable...and definitely not what i would have expected from a daniel boulud restaurant (***i've been to others and not had such a bad experience)we got the $50 charcuterie plate - and let me just say not only were the saucisson slices too think to pierce with my fork, but the various pates were gelatinous --- i understand that's partially needed to keep it all together, but this was overkill. Tiny portions overall - which would be fine if the food had been mind-blowingly good. But, quite frankly, you could probably get all the same ingredients at Zabars and Fairway across the street and save yourself some money and get normal portions. Another BIG problem --- there was a BONE in one of the pates - thank goodness I fished it out of my mouth before cracking a tooth. I understand sh*t happens, but it shouldn't happen at this place, for these prices. Next, there was a chip in one of our friend's wine glasses - which she noticed before slicing her lip open. Again, sh*t happens --- but not twice and not at a place like this. My group of 5 was there to bid farewell to a friend who brought a nice bottle of wine that he wanted to share w/us before leaving NYC. When he asked if we'd be able to pay a corkage fee we were told NO. We offered to pay whatever, that it was a going away party. No. Ok, fine. Service: our waitress was nice BUT we had to swat the bus team away from our table multiple times as they tried to scoop up our plates before we were finished. Food: pate= not good, really disappointing, had a bone. Steak tartare - good but totally unremarkable and a SHOCKINGLY small portion for $50. Steak frites---the frites were delicious, if only the bus team hadn't grabbed all of our small plates as we shared them.To add insult to injury? the waitress left our bill which included a 20% tip (including the 2 bottles of expensive wine that we bought - i thought tip was pre-alcohol - esp when it's that expensive?) --- she said the tip was ""for our convenience"" --- just FYI, we were a table of just 5. 20% on top of the wine w/o any disclaimer saying 20% tip added to parties of 5+....The entire experience was really unacceptable for the price and the supposed prestige of DB.

4.0,6/21/2012,"I went here in February with my father after a show. We were walking around all day and a little underdressed, but didn't feel awkward in the restaurant which is a bit trendy and upscale. Hostess was sweet and we were seated at a rather cramped table for two (what else is to be expected in a NYC restaurant). The bread we were served was good, but cold, which I absolutely cannot stand. We were also given cheese popovers which were steamy and perfectly cheesy, yet light. The waiter promptly came over, took our drink order, and read us the specials. He was very thorough, but that may have been because he was training someone. We ordered a cheese platter to start (and split)- the one with five cheeses. The waiter offered to chose for us and we let him. All the cheeses were excellent and our bread basket was constantly being filled. Next, our food came. My dad ordered a roasted chicken special, which was excellent, and I ordered the coq au vin. In all honesty, this was my first time at a French restaurant and wanted to start with something traditional. I am so happy I did. The thigh, leg, and breast meat was tender, and the vegetables were perfectly cooked. The sauce was thick and rich and the wine flavor was strong, yet not overpowering. The only thing I didn't like about it was the chunks of pork belly, as I don't care for bacon, though I'm sure the sauce wouldn't have been right without them. Also, the dish was served over homemade pasta. The pasta was excellent, but didn't go with the dish. We were allowed to linger after our meal (too full for dessert) and both agreed we would return.

I noticed the managers rolling table settings and assistant managers helping the waiters by clearing drinks and asking if people needed refills. I think that's part of the reason why they seem to be very adept at serving dinner so people can make their shows at Lincoln Center. Be prepared to sit in the sun because the shaded part of the outdoor area fills up first. So I ordered a very refreshing rhubarb and mint based cocktail that was made with crushed ice. I highly recommend this drink. Because I was eating outside, I thought I should start with the organic salad du Marche and end with the classic coq au vin. The salad was dressed nicely and the greens were crisp. As an appetizer, it was very simple so you may want to try some thing else if you're looking for something more savory or adventurous. The coq au vin was really satisfying . It had 3 pieces of dark meat chicken that were braised perfectly. It arrived studded with mushrooms, lardons, onions and toothy pasta. It was French comfort food at its best. Prices are a little on the higher side but that's to be expected given its location and association to DB. But the real bonus of dining outside is to people watch in a laid back atmosphere. Having a constant flow of attractive women walk by does enhance the experience. If it wasn't getting busy due to the theater crowd, I would have ordered another beer.

3.0,3/18/2012,"Had a nice dinner with the wife and baby here last night.  We were in the area and made a last minute decision to sit in their outside seating area and splurge a little on some good French food.  First off sitting outside here is great, it was getting a little chilly out, but they had heat lamps up to keep it a comfortable temperature.  You have a great view of Lincoln Center and people watching on Broadway.  During dinner a musician came up and sat on the sidewalk near the seating area with a guitar...got a little worried about what was about to come, but he ended up playing some nice, soft, jazzy style music.  Very enjoyableFor food we started off with the crispy pork belly.  Very well done, however it was a bit simple and nothing spectacular.  But hey, sometimes just letting the main ingredient be the star is a good thing, and this was a good example of that.  We enjoyed it.For our entrees, my wife got the Coq au Vin.  A little lacking in the sauce department, which lead to a little bit of a lack of flavor in the chicken.  But, she really enjoyed it.  She's not a wine drinker, so the lack of sauce and wine flavor probably made it better for her :)  I went with the confit pork leg off of the nose to tail menu.  It was pretty delicious, one of the better dishes I've had in awhile.  Kind of like a super fancified version of pulled pork.  Overall a pretty good dinner.  A few minor complaints though.  First, while friendly, the service wasn't super attentive and a bit slow.  That includes slow stopping by the table for refills, etc. and slow as in the food took quite awhile to come out(yes I know that's the kitchen not the servers, but still part of the service).  Second, the price per portion here is a little steep.  I think they feel because this is a Daniel sister restaurant they can charge a little more...but the food isn't THAT good. I'd come back again, but maybe just to try the Charcuterie.",1,0,0,Derek B.,"Auburn, AL",193,540,239
2.0,3/17/2012,"I used to love this place. When it first opened it had some of the best charcuterie in the world. But over the last few years it's gotten worse and worse. The prepared food was never that good. But the charcute... oh man. Have a frisee lardon salad, a charcute board for 2, a bottle of sancerre, and you'd be in heaven. No longer. They're phoning it in here these days. The charcute is too cold, and not nearly at the standards it was when it first opened. It's really a same. Because this used to be a go-to place in the city. Time for Daniel to rein this place in a bit. If you do go, the ham is still the best thing on the menu.

Lighting, comfort, and design is spotty and the restaurant feels plain considering the cost of dinner. Food similarly, while sounding exciting on the menu, was for the most part surprisingly bland! Accustomed to the usual small portions at this style of restaurant, but some of these bordered on silly. 10 separate dishes between us and not one standout. Some were downright lame. Grocery store baby arugula salad!? Shouldn't be encountering that at these prices.Plus.. A leak. From the ceiling. All through dinner. Splashing on the seat beside us, and spraying towards us. They covered that seat with a napkin, and the puddle on the table too. Very appealing. Never had a visit from the maitre, or the manager, or an offer to move to one of the several open tables, or a free wine or dessert or any other thing that far less costly establishments would be gracious enough to offer. I held my tongue till departure so as not to ruin the night, and after telling the maitre of our disappointment, received the standard brush-off ""sorry"".. Not an ounce of concern.

The food was incredible. I came for brunch and had the prix fixe per my cousin's recommendation.  The chocolate croissant was this dainty little thing, nothing that great but it was tasty. I really loved the coffee here though. I ordered the pate next, which was rich and delicious.The first time I tried pate was when I visited France. All it is is a combination of finely chopped pieces of cooked meat, fat, and various seasonings/flavorings that are turned into a loaf or put in a jar so that you can spread it on bread, etc. At least those are the two ways that I have seen it served. A lot of people are grossed out by it, but the pate here reminded me of the pate I had in France so give it a try.The frittata was yummy, but I was surprised that the eggs were a bit overcooked. I loved the selection of vegetables though. However, I wish I would've ordered what my cousin ordered. THE FRENCH TOAST HERE IS HEAVENLY. That single bite that I had off my cousin's plate was the most airy piece of french toast I have ever had. I long for that french toast to this day...Lastly, I had a passion fruit sorbet. It was a perfect balance of sweet and tart, a great way to end my meal. My cousin, also a chef in New York, informed me that Daniel Boulud has a Michelin 3-star restaurant. Bar Boulud, is not that restaurant, but just to put it in perspective there are only a handful of 3 star restaurants in New York.

The restaurant is beautiful, we were seated in the back of the restaurant where the ""bar"" is in the round, with wine glasses all around the circle. It's very cool looking, I was excited to be somewhere that felt very special.Service: our waiter didn't speak English very well, it was very difficult to understand his explanation of items on the menu and the specials. Also, I asked about a particular wine on the menu that was inexpensive, and he suggested flat-out that I should instead get another one that was MUCH more expensive. We're talking about the difference between $12 and $29 a glass. Seriously? If I'm asking for a wine that's $12 a glass, you can bet it is inappropriate to immediately suggest (and assume I'll want) another glass for more than double. Cost: OK, it's expensive. If the food were incredible, I wouldn't mind. But for what we got, it was way too high. Food: Beef cheek appetizer: this was like a disgusting, cold meatloaf. Instead of charcuterie that we thought would be thin and tasty, it was a thick slab of something that included beef cheek, but had other stuff mixed in. We took one bite and called it a day. Yet the restaurant - seeing we didn't eat any of it - still charged us for the dish. Not classy.Cheese appetizers: this I enjoyed, though we were given very little cheese. The bloomy one was the best, though my BF would say otherwise, he liked the goat cheese. Plenty of bread kept coming our way, for that I was grateful.Steak frites main dish: This was so-so. The meat was cooked well and had plenty of seasoning, but it just wasn't spectacular. Probably shouldn't have ordered steak from a non-steakhouse. French fries were delicious, there was another small win.Cauliflower gratin side dish: A nice idea, but the delivery wasn't there. It burnt my tongue (way too hot) and didn't actually taste all that good. I think the flavors just didn't mesh as well as I would've hoped. We were too bummed at that point to order dessert.

2.0,12/1/2011,Had lunch at Bar Boulud today with my daughter.  She ordered the steak frites.The steak was practically inedible -- lots of fat and gristle.  I mentioned this to the waiter but he didn't waive the charge.  How is it a restaurant like this can't manage a great steak?  We won't be going back anytime soon.,0,0,0,Jonathan M.,"Washington, DC",0,9,0
5.0,11/30/2011,"New York is graced with some amazing chefs, but secretly, I wish they were all like Daniel Boulud.  Bar Boulud despite that it is the slightly lower price point than Daniel, is no exception.  I was extraordinarily fortunate to be invited to help choose a menu for an event there.  The one time my obsession over yelp, lists, and food criticism has paid off in spades. All I can say is YUM!  We tried the beet salad - a new addition to the menu - and the beef carpacio - a classic favorite.  The former is made with freshly picked red and yellow beets seasoned just adequately to b beet like, but not so aggressively that it is too beet.  They did not dice the beets up as some restaurants do, and I must admit, that little detail did make a signficant difference, as felt even more as if you were eating something in its natural delicious form.  The later - for those that have not yet had it - is stopped with an adorable quail(?) egg and garnished with romaine lettuce, capers and fried potato chips.  A wise foodie recently taught me that with all French cuisine, one must put the various ingredients together to 1) understand what the chef was trying to accomplish 2) get the absolute best flavor to the taste buds.  In this regard, if you get the beef carpaccio, make sure that it includes lettuce, caper, and fried potato thing in 1 bite. Without the accouterments it's delightful.  With them it is like a flavor explosion of joy that you will want your mouth to experience.The steak at a french restaurant is never a bad choice.  We were attempting to select the ""swing dish"" for the event. It was between the coq au vin and the poitrine de veau (veal).  Both were excellent but we chose the coq au vin.  The poitrine has a delightful sauce and is quite delicious.  It is veal so it will have a certain meat flavor that is not insignificant.  If you don't already specifically love veal, you may not enjoy this dish.  In reality it's delightfully prepared.  The coq au vin - a favorite of all french is delightful.  The chicken is well seasoned and the accompanying pears add to the loveliness of this dish. For me, I'm a sucker if you add country bacon in thick slices.  Yum Yum Yum! Boulud proves once again that chicken and pork can be good friends.  This is not a light chicken dish though.  You could easily pair it with red without faux pas.For dessert we had the gateau basque and the Tanin.  The Tanin is amazing.  It is the first time I've had a chocolate desert where the crust is the star for its unexpectedness.  The gateau basque was absolutely excellent.  I usually find the non-chocolate desserts at restaurants to be a let down.  It is as if chefs use this as a testing ground for odd experiments that don't work out and shouldn't have happened in the first place.  In this case... YUM!!! Oh Daniel... you so understand my sweet tooth.The price point - for what it is - is excellent. We had excellent service despite a fairly busy crowd.  Oh... and the wine list is great.  It's a French restaurant after all.",3,0,0,May L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",617,466,229

I have to say the food was good, but pricey. I recommend the squash soup - very tasty and great especially on a cold night. The Steak Frites were good, but you could do better at Landmarc for less than the $35 BB charged. The lamb pasta was good, but again a tad overpriced at $25. For dessert we split the Tanin - good, but nothing spectacular.However the wine list was very overpriced and limited to Burgundy/Rhone (albeit not a bad area to be limited to). Most diners I noticed ordered wine by the glass. Beers were also overpriced ($11 for a bottle of Dogfish Head IPA - cost $1.99 in any supermarket!). Cocktails were on the small side.The decor was nice - a clean look in a shotgun configuration (long and narrow). The bathrooms are in the basement, adjacent to the wine cellar. The bathrooms are shared by DB's other restaurant, Bulud Sud.Service was average.If you're looking for a Lincoln Center pre-theatre than this may be the place.

We were sat (without a reservation) right away at the bar as tables were not available due to upcoming reservations. No problem, happy to sit at the bar. Then, we were ignored. I expect much more from a Daniel Boulud restaurant. Servers walked by us, no one came over. We then made eye contact with one server who went over to one of his colleagues and looked as is if he told her that she needed to go over. She rolled her eyes, shrugged it off and several minutes later finally came over. Granted I am not sure this was her section, but who cares? If you are going to do it, then do it right. She walked over (remember this is the first interaction we were having with anyone) and says in a disgruntled voice: ""Do you know what you want?"" I was so taken aback. I actually had a puzzled look on my face and said ""Oh, hi. Sorry I was not expecting that abrupt greeting."" She awkwardly apologized as if I was crazy.

The trapping, the locale and the enthusiastic and professional waitstaff we all great. But the food wasn't.We had three main courses-- the Swordfish, steak tartare, and coq au vin. The place was pricey and the portions were miniscule, which would be okay if the food knocked your socks off. Sadly, it didn't.I had the coq and it was flat tasting. In fact, I ate only half of my large silver-dollar sized, $30 portion. The person with the swordfish said that it was not at all tastey -- and her comments were echoed by the person eating the steak tartare, whose feelings were that while it was marginally tastey, the portion's size made it less than exciting, essentially a $30 (give or take) mini-hamburger size of steak tartare.Not a place I'd go back to soon.

I have never in my life experienced 3 servers so politely tell me that I had approximately 14.2 seconds left to order or else the kitchen was going to close. Then, two couples were seated after me, and allowed to order at their leisure. Gee thanks. I felt rushed, but eventually enjoyed my Peekytoe crab salad (carrots, ginger, frisee) and glass of chenin blanc and bread.The same servers who rushed me had the audacity to have a conversation within earshot about how a certain table left zero tip. I'm too polite to do that eventhough I wanted to, too. Fortunately, a more seasoned server came by and told them to stop talking about that within earshot of the customers. Too late, buddy. I heard it all.Anyway, while the crab salad was tasty and the wine was nice and cold, the experience for me was lacking. The rushing. The banal almost reluctant inquiries into whether or not I was enjoying it versus the near coddling of, cowtowing to customers who arrived after I did. The dust on the display at the display bottles at the bar (yuck! ah-choo!). The virtual door-slam with the eyes when I left (and I tipped 20%!).

So so good, the raspberry puree is just the best kind of raspberry I've had ever. She still talks about the desert from time to time.We returned again for lunch the next day. I got a croque monsieur. It lives up to its name. It had a perfect broiled top - win or lose when ordering a croque. The ham was moist and salty, really great. It got a little salty 3/4ths of the way through it because of the combination of gruyere and ham but I pushed though it. ;)We got desert again - I got a gateaux basque (a custard inside puff pastry). It was good but needed some kind of fruit with it because it got a bit bleak after awhile. My mother order a cherry/chocolate thing. It came out in an extravagant display, once again. A huge cylinder of differentiating layers of chocolate concoctions such as cake or whipped cream with cherries or cherry compote, there were so many elements!

The cinnamon was good too, but not as scrumptious. My meal:- Steel cut oatmeal topped with halved hazelnuts and carmelized apples- Gnocchi with duck and mushrooms- Tropical sundaePartner's meal: - Parfait- Croque Monsieur (salad on side)- (can't remember the dessert) I'm a sucker for excellently done oatmeal and this didn't disappoint.  I will say though that oatmeal is quite filling and I should have thought about this before ordering it. The parfait was like any parfait, but the yogurt was mildly tart which allowed the raspberries in it to really stand out.  The gnocchi dish was well prepared and had good flavor.  The croque monsieur had a very creamy and cheesy consistency throughout.  The combination of a soft bread that and hollandaise sauce made that possible.  I'm typically a fan of more solid bread for a croque, but I can't complain because the flavor was a hit. Overall, it was a good brunch that met expectations.  The service was attentive although one of our tea cups almost got filled with coffee...So come visit if you have $26 to throw down on brunch.

3.0,7/18/2011,"3.5 stars.Four of us arrived at Bar Boulud for 11:30 brunch reservations on an absolutely glorious summer morning and were seated outside for optimal people-watching (there's hardly better than in New York).  Moms and I chose the four course prix-fixe menu, a steal at $26, and husband and Pops went à la carte.  The food that was good here was *quite* good, despite a few let-downs.Prix-fixe began with ""American"" coffee and a pastry.  Good thing the ""American"" coffee was still dark, rich, and wonderfully strong.  We had our choice of dainty, two-bite pastries, so we shared a chocolate croissant and a cheese croissant.  They were some of the best croissants I've had: light, airy, and flaky.  When you bit into them, they didn't collapse together to become unappealingly dense.  Meanwhile, husband had ordered a three-cheese board for the table with a sharp aged, stinky washed-rind, and herbed goat (this was how they were described on the menu and no actual names for them were given...I suppose I could have asked if I *really* cared enough).  They were all very nice cheeses, a great way to begin our meal.For the next course I chose a mesclun salad with shaved vegetables and a lemon vinaigrette.  I was craving a light, healthful salad, but this one was a supreme disappointment.  A lot of the greens were wilted and slimy, and there was so little dressing it was hard to detect.  Moms' pick of chilled beet soup with dill crème fraîche and miniature pumpernickel croutons was a much better choice: it had a silky texture and even better subtly sweet flavor.  For entrées I had the Garden Frittata and Moms the Croque Monsieur.  The frittata -- with caramelized onion, summer squash, and grape tomatoes -- was very good, but nothing I can't do myself at home.  Moms was delighted with her Croque Monsieur, however, made with crisp, buttery toast, tender, salty house-cured ham, thick, creamy béchamel, and bubbling, nutty gruyère.  Husband enjoyed the Eggs Florentine with jumbo lump crab meat and fried eggs served in a quaint cast-iron pan, and Pops gobbled up his Mushroom, Gruyére, and House-Cured Ham omelet with breakfast potatoes.  The potatoes, by the way, were on-point, fried so crisp on the outside the texture was more yucca than potato.For our last course, Moms and I both chose a raspberry-pomegranate sorbet with freshly whipped cream, mini vanilla wafers, raspberries and homemade marshmallow.  It was a light and refreshing way to end our perfectly portioned prix-fixe (read: we left satisfied but not uncomfortably stuffed).I appreciated the professional and attentive service from our waiters, busboys, and runners.  But when husband and I ventured downstairs to use the restrooms -- located in the wine cellar and next to the private events room -- one of the managers gave me the side-eye and lingered as I waited for husband near the open doorway to said private space.  ""Ma'am,"" she condescended, ""Are you planning on coming *upstairs*???""  I don't know if she thought I was trying to creep on her private dining room or I'm just simple and can't find a stairwell, but her tone was so patronizing I was taken aback.  So I told her no, I wasn't planning on coming upstairs.  She stalked off then, but it was such an unpleasant way to finish off our Bar Boulud experience.  Check yourself, lady: your clientele aren't unmannered hayseeds, so don't make them feel that way.[Top Chef: Daniel Boulud][15 Minutes of Fame: ""Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations"" & ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate: For Brunch"" (Frank Bruni, croque monsieur)]",14,11,11,Mac O.,"Alexandria, VA",676,1049,2377

The portions are small, yes, but once again it's a French restaurant and especially in this case, you're getting quality over quantity. The food is very well presented, exceptionally well prepared. Every dish I've had there had just the perfect balance of ingredients, taste, texture, flavour, colour, topped off with a beautiful presentation. The menu items reflect a certain elegance, creativity and are well thought out. The specials are almost always worth any other item on the menu- listen to the waiter when they announce the specials!!

4.0,7/1/2011,"How to arrange for a French dinner in the age of social media.1. Send out a tweet from your phone to say that you feel like having French food.2. Friend tweets in reply that you should take her to have French food.3. Find reputable French restaurant in convenient location on Yelp mobile app.4. Make reservation for two at said restaurant on Yelp mobile app.I did not have to actually talk to anybody throughout this transaction.  What I take for granted today, my 15-year old high school computer nerd self would have given his year's worth of minimum wage dishwasher pay to enjoy.  Several days later on a Sunday night, my friend and I arrived at Bar Boulud at the reservation time for dinner.  Bar Boulud is one of the establishments of the famed Daniel Boulud.  The space is sleek and modern-looking, complete with a charcuterie bar, outdoor seating, and a wine cellar.  We opted for a table near the edge of the interior of the restaurant just next to the outdoor seating, and the weather that night was of a near perfect cool New York summer temperament.I was put in charge of ordering.  Part of the reason why I chose Bar Boulud was that despite having a sizable charcuterie menu, it also boasted several fish dishes that read deliciously, which would suit my pescetarian friend just fine.  We started off with a couple of appetisers, the Carrots with Coriander and Mushrooms la Grecque.  The carrots were very fresh and sweet, and the mushrooms were moist with a light olive sauce that made them mouth-watering.  Next I had the Soupe Romaine, which was a chilled romaine soup with tomato confit, garlic cream, and brioche croutons, and my friend had the Betteraves et Noix, a salad of roasted red beets, farm greens, and mint blue cheese-walnut dressing.  I think I will never tire of these chilled soups made from the purée of vegetables, and Bar Boulud's Soupe Romaine only reinforced my addiction.  This soup was basically just right in all its moving parts, it was sweet and creamy, and the garlic cream and brioche croutons added the extra layers of flavour that made it unforgettable.  I mean, brioche croutons and garlic cream?  Who would not love those in a soup?For our entrees my friend had the Truite Arc-en-ciel, which was a local rainbow trout with hearts of palm, sunchokes, baby dandelion greens, and almond milk jus, while I had the Coq Au Vin.  Sidenote: whenever I see the word ""arc-en-ciel"", which means rainbow, I immediately think of the Japanese glam rock band L'Arc-en-ciel.  My cousin was a huge fan of theirs when he was younger and all these years I have thought that it was such a funny looking word.  But I digress.  While trying to decide what I wanted as an entree, my eyes spied a small section of the menu that included only two dishes, and they were classics.  One was an escargot dish and the other was the coq au vin.  I have not had coq au vin in years and when I saw it on the menu, I immediately said to the waiter, ""oh you have coq au vin?  I'll have that.""  Bar Boulud's coq au vin uses traditional ingredients - onions, mushrooms, and of course lardons - served with a bit of hand rolled pasta.  I can now report that Bar Boulud has definitely satisfied my long-simmering craving for coq qu vin.  The well-seasoned and juicy sauce in the dish was braised to a perfection and soaked into the meat, which was so very tender.For dessert, we shared a Gâteau Basque, which was a custard cake with strawberry confit and vanilla anglaise.  The strawberry flavour was blended in just the right amount to the creamy custard cake, and it made for a great end to a great dinner.",6,1,5,Radford T.,"Queens, NY",612,452,159

The service was definitely commendable - it was quick, attentive and friendly as well. The waiter came by with drinks and refills consistently and even volunteered to take photos with at least 4 cameras that our photo-happy group offered. The food choices were simply superb. The hors d'oeurves were great, and kept coming around for nearly 20 minutes before the meal. For the individual meals, I started with the Salade de Crabe, a light but delicious Maine crab salad. Next up was the Boudin Blanc, a truffled white sausage served with mashed potatoes and apple garnish. I never thought sausages could be light and fluffy but they were! The meal was topped off with a tasty grapefruit-banana compote, which was similar to a yogurty-mousse. I have to say that dessert was my favorite part of the meal, and I'm not even a dessert person.To be entirely truthful, the only reason I was hesitant in giving Bar Boulud five stars was because it's tough to review based on an event experience, rather than a personal one.",1,0,2,Karynn E.,"Manhattan, NY",87,50,0

My girlfriend took me here for my birthday (I'd always wanted to go), and bless her heart she did her research, down to what and what not to get to have a memorable dining experience. Here were her rules for having an amazing meal at Bar Boulud. 1) Pretend like you're in Paris. If the food takes forever, just relax. 2) If the wait staff is nasty and pretentious, remember it's the food you're paying for, not the server. 3) The restaurant is known for classic French, mainly pates and charcuteries, stick to those. If you follow those rules you'll be golden. Otherwise you may be in for disappointment.We were seated per our reservation by a classically mannered French maitre d' and it took about ten minutes for our server to come over and take our wine order. Remember, everyone who I met who works there is French. This is normal. We ordered a knockout Chateauneuf-du-Pape and ordered the large charcuterie tasting platter and escargot. It took about 45 mins for the platter to appear but of what a platter! It contained about a pound of top notch nasty-bits ground and formed into delicious little wedges of goodness. It also came with about a pound of jambon de Paris. Outstanding. Plenty of bread was provided as well for spreading and our table attendant (a wonderful Central American woman) kept us stocked on crostini. We had finished the platter when our server (Gilles of Gilbert, I forget exactly) brought out the escargot which were buttery, garlicky, and delicious.

The highlight of the meal was the starter we tried which was a terrine of foie gras, quail, and (I think) rabbit surrounded by a gravy-flavored jelly. This was just outstanding. It's been a while since our visit and it looks like this particular terrine isn't on the menu anymore but if they have anything similar I would highly recommend it. I think the next time we go here we'll be making a meal of the charcuterie. For mains my wife tried the scallops which were quite nice while I had the braised beef which was fantastic. It was cooked just perfectly. The wine list is quite nice. It obviously skews French and highlights Burgundy and the Rhone. The best values can be found in the ""Les Cousins"" section of the list where they present wines from around the world made in a similar style to Burgundy and the Rhone. Keep in mind an $80 Pinot Noir from Oregon can be every bit as good and even better than a $300 Burgundy. Ask one of the wine waiters or sommelier if you have any questions. They are quite helpful.That being said the only tiny complaint I have is related to the wine service namely it seemed to disappear after we had been served our wine. At one point our waitress actually came to the table to bring us something and left while my wife's glass sat empty. Perhaps she believed that to be the job of the wine waiters and they believed it to be hers. It might sound incredibly snobby but at a place like this you should *never* have to pour the wine yourself and yet that happened at least once. It would have happened even more if the eagle-eyed host hadn't spotted empty our empty glasses and filled them on two separate occasions.

5.0,3/28/2011,"Enjoyed a fabulous sunday brunch date yesterday and couldn't be more thrilled with the experience. I heard about the croque madame on ""Best Thing I Ever Ate"" quite a while ago and had been looking forward to trying it ever since. We were started off with delicious bread, followed by a first course of pasty and coffee. My pain au chocolate was delicious, as was the cheese danish my boyfriend chose. We both had the sheep's milk yogurt parfait as our second course and loved the texture combinations. It was such a treat compared to the boring healthy yogurt I typically eat!As soon as we put our spoons down, our brunch entrees came out and we both couldn't wait to taste the first bite. The croque madame completely lived up to every aspect of the high expectations I had of it. The mix of strong flavors of the cheese, ham and egg yolk could easily have been too much, but they were all perfectly balanced and worked so well together. For our desserts we chose the floating island and the ice cream. Each dessert was presented beautifully, but we both preferred the taste of the ice cream over the meringue island. I can't wait to return in the spring and summer and enjoy this perfect brunch outdoors on a beautiful day!",0,0,0,Jen G.,"New York, NY",36,188,0

And by horrible, I mean almost non existence. We sat there for so long, i totally forgot we even had a server. Hmm... i don't remember what I ordered for the appetizer... But I remember it being okay nothing noteworthy. I ordered the steak frites medium and it came out practically well done. I think this is the night that I've decided that I am never going to order steak at a nice restaurant unless I am specifically at a steak house or my iron level is so low that I will fall to the ground unless I have a piece of meat asap! And for dessert I ordered some custard thingy. It was also just ok. Did I mention that we waited about 20 mins for our waiter to come around and ask us for our dessert order? We sat there for so long with our dessert menus that another worker came around and took our menus away before we even had a chance to put our orders in. I was a bit appalled by the service here, especially for a late dinner on Valentines Day when the restaurant was not even very packed.

3.0,3/23/2011,"""Do you have a reservation?"" Don't you love it when a snooty hostess asks you this the minute you walk into a restaurant? Even more so when it's 5pm and the place is empty--except for the bar, which is where we were headed. We knew the bar would be the safest place to have an afternoon glass of wine and appetizer, i.e. no pressure to order a full meal. We found two stools at the large communal table with about five other pairs doing the same thing. A silent server handed over a wine list and menu and we ordered two glasses of white wine for about $16 each. Now, I've been to Bar Boulud before in London, and the surroundings were more posh. You'd expect to pay that much, especially when attached to the luxe Mandarin Oriental, but here, with the pale wood furniture, orange accents, and staff bumping into my chair the entire time (the bar seats closest to the wall are a pain-in-the-ass), it didn't justify and suddenly I felt crabby. Just then, the couple next door departed before ordering--clearly they also had misgivings.But then the food, the FOOD! This is why Daniel Boulud commands such respect. The food was sensational and we just had a few nibbles: airy cheese puffs (compliments of the chef) pommes frites, and escargot served in cast iron with artisanal bread for dipping. The same hostess took her nose out of the air just long enough to look me up and down on our way out, but at this point, I didn't care.

5.0,3/18/2011,"My parents -- who are the best parents in the world -- are solid middle class folk. Growing up, we rarely ate out at anywhere nicer than TGI Fridays, and not because my parents don't appreciate nice food, but mostly because they wanted to save money so that I could enjoy the charmed life that I now have. So, first, thank you always, Mom and Dad :)Since my sister and I left college, though, they've become a little more expansive in their tastes. Recently, they came to visit me in New York, and having read about Bar Boulud on some Chinese website, my parents wanted to try it out.Knowing them, it's the nicest restaurant they've ever dined in, and they certainly looked the part of the country bumpkins coming into the big city for the first time. They took a ton of photos throughout our meal. My dad was wearing a sweatshirt with jeans and sneakers. They didn't know what to order, they gawked at the pate and the presentation of our dishes, and in general acted like they had no idea what they were doing. Being much less fiscally responsible than they, I've splurged at plenty of other fancier restaurants. No, Bar Boulud doesn't serve the best food, have the chic-est decor, the most attentive service. But you know what? Their staff treated my parents with the utmost class. They explained menu items without being patronizing. They took pictures for us. And because of all that, it was one of the best meals I've ever had with my family.As for particulars, the charcuterie is quite good. So's the beet salad.

3.0,3/16/2011,"Sunday afternoon found me at Daniel Boulud's (Café Boulud, db bistro moderne) upper west side eatery for brunch. Now, the Lincoln Center area isn't particularly known for its host of phenomenal restaurants; let's face it, it's pretty touristy and such locations are typically known for overpriced substandard fare--at best. But Boulud (as expected), given his culinary acumen, deviates from the 'typical' and offers patrons fairly priced French fare at this upper west side brasserie.Billed as a 4 course prix fix brunch, diners have a choice of coffee and pastry choice, an appetizer, main course, and dessert, all for for a set price in the mid 20s (as of this writing). In addition, included the set menu, is an accompaniment of a basket of sliced baguettes to kick things off.For a starter, I settled on the 'steel cut oatmeal caramelized apple, toasted almonds' as opposed to the  Sheep's milk yoghurt (the other option I was considering). The oatmeal though quite pleasant in texture, overall, fell just a tad short for me. I thought it could have used a little more sweetening -- perhaps a tinge of maple syrup. I didn't think the caramelized apple was enough to carry the sweetness--but then again, I tend to have a sweet tooth. Ultimately, it wasn't a big deal since one could easily rectify the situation.For a main, I had the 'brioche french toast seasonal fruit' which has become a staple of mine (french toast) at brunch--though I'm beginning to think I need to mix it up a bit. While it was quite moist and tasty, the portion's really just appetizer size: a couple sticks of toast, syrup and a small side of fruit. Desert was hands down my favorite. I opted for the 'clafoutis du jour' which was simply divine. It was just about the right amount of flavor, consistency, and portion to round out my meal.

Been there before when it kind of first opened.Started with the salmon tartare, topped with a blood orange puree, served with fennel and arugula. Very yummy and refreshing.Main course was the pork loin which was the special of the day. It sounded really delicious when the waiter was describing it. Maybe we were both distracted with his sparkling blue eyes. But the pork loin was too dry, and rather tasteless. It's served with some beans thing which reminded me of canned baked beans...though I am sure it had a much fancier name. Mr Boulud, despite me being a big fan, this is quite a disappointment.Highlight of the meal has nothing to do with the food though.

It's not a normal day that I'm willing to shell out $25 for brunch, but my mother was visiting from out of town and I could tell she needed a pick-me-up, which I decided should come in the form of an 11AM  3-course meal (followed by a nap, rather than a run around the park).  I'm convinced there is no better way to start your day than indulging in a miniature warm croissant and a cappuccino.  To follow, a small salad and then a delicious crab-topped plate of oeufs florentine. By dessert, I felt like a poached egg myself, so just had a tiny sample of the clafoutis (turns out its a custard tart of some kind, who knew?)In sum, this brunch is not for the faint of heart. You will not be walking out with that light as a feather lets go start the day right sort of feeling.

They put us at this strange round communal table thing at the VERY back of the restaurant though. I like round tables for large parties, but this was strange. It was made stranger by the fact that when the waiter came to give us our food my boyfriend happened to be in the bathroom, so the waiter put down his plate of food in front of the man next to me, thinking he was my companion. Awkward. I had hangar steak which was tender, thick and delicious, and my boyfriend had scallops with cheese and some kind of foam. Would not recommend.

5.0,1/24/2011,"I have been to Bar Boulud multiple times, and the quality of the food and the service are always top-notch.First, if you go, this place is best known for the excellent quality and selection of its French wines, and the different types of pate and charcuterie available here.  I would highly recommend the house-made classic duck liver pate, and the small board of a selection of charcuterie available there.  A glass of their French wine, some of their home-made baguettes and bread, and their small board of charcuterie is all you need for a perfect night out.However, recently, I also went there for brunch on a Saturday and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the offerings there.  They had a standard $26 prix fixe brunch, with four courses, free pastry and bottomless coffee, with dessert as the last course.  A great way to start your weekend.  The highlights from the table are as follows:1. Berry parfait (sheep's milk yogurt, granola) - A simple sounding appetizer, but the quality of the yogurt, the fresh raspberries, and especially the tasty morsels of homemade granola, made this a surprise treat.  2. Pate grand-mere (fine country pate)  - A portion of their to-die-for homemade classic duck liver pate.  You would be hard-pressed to find better quality pate in the city.  And the mustard is real true French country mustard, with seeds that pop with a vinegary explosion in your mouth, tying the whole dish together.3.  Quiche maison (daily selection) - I have had some bad quiches in my life, always overcooked, tough, and bland.  This is not one of those bad quiches.  This quiche was soft, cooked perfectly, and bursting with flavor.  The pastry was flaky and buttery and delicious.  A great choice with a big portion for the hungry eater.4. Croque monsieur - A classic French brunch dish, white toast with country ham, bechamel, melted with gruyere cheese all over.  A French version of a grilled cheese sandwich (with some ham).  I saw this featured on ""Best Thing I Ever Ate"" on the Food Network, and it was delicious.  One of the best croque monsieur's I have had.  Also, the portions are not too overwhelming, which is good considering the richness of the dish.  The cheese, the bread, the ham, everything was top-quality and delicious.5.  Clafoutis du jour - A baked French dessert cake with a flan-like center.  This was the highlight of the dessert courses, as the slice of cake here was expertly prepared and delicious.     The coffee was in a great cup and bottomless.  The pastry that I had, the cheese one, was delicious and flaky.  A great place for a high quality French brunch with friends.  The quality of the food, the service, and the ambience was definitely worth the money spent.  Highly recommended.",3,1,1,Albert S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",39,5,0

Really interesting pates and terrines- from rabbit to boar etc. Next time I'm coming here with a friend and doing their Charcuterie sampler. This time, however, I ordered the boudin tasting plate of the noir and blanc. Now, having lived in New Orleans I've eaten my share of boudin. The boudin here has never seen the bayou- it's a different breed of boudin all together and damn if it isn't delicious. Really light and tender and just richly flavorful. The flavors were complex and I really really sincerely enjoyed every bite. My friend got the Lyon style sausage in brioche and absolutely loved hers as well.

Or, as I like to tell myself: don't get wooed and screwed with no Boulud to at-least about. BB is a very palatable Level 1 date. It's a mature and low-key wine bistro on a classy stretch of UWS costing, as my erstwhile companion correctly noted ""about $8 too much to make into a regular spot"". I suggest BB for their eroticaesque charcuterie menu only. It favors terrines: $10-$15 buys fascination-concepts like head cheese, Berkshire pork, and truffle-and-port-drizzled foie gras. Entrees were relatively medium-grade bistro staples running closer to $30 than $20. We finished with an ostentatious showpiece dessert-for-two ($25) that incorporated about four sweet varietals too many, and whose style (if not its substance) eclipsed the unmemorable mains. Take a break to explore the wine cellar dowstairs - it's beautiful, and it feels like a secret. The adjacent private (and unattended) dining rooms are handy for a daring French digestif - if you catch my drift.

Here, aside from charcuterie and cheese,  you are limited to one soup, a few salads, and 5 or so entrees. The lamb terrine as an appetizer was tasty enough, and the scallops and scallop mousseline in my entree were quite nice, but I didn't care for the braised endive beneath, nor the sauce, which tasted of vanilla. Dessert was a trio of swirled ice creams, each flavor combination more bizarre and dissonant than the next. There's a reason you've never seen hazelnut and passion fruit together before, and the same goes for blood orange with caramel and pear with licorice, although the latter was actually the most agreeable of the three combinations.

5.0,12/13/2010,"Before seeing an opera at the Met, I decided to head directly across the street from Lincoln Center and try Bar Boulud's Pre-Theater menu.  I had been here before, over a year ago for lunch for Restaurant Week, and selected a prix-fixe menu this time as well.  $42 for 3 courses is a great deal for the food here.  While Bar Boulud is known for its charcuterie and wine selection, I didn't partake in either during this visit.First of all, I must say (and this may seem silly) that the butter served here is of superior quality.  I love butter and olive oil served with my bread, but there are few occasions when I really take note of the quality.  It stands out.  This is damn good butter.  Damn.  Good.  I'm actually tempted to ask them where they get their butter from (in case I want to jump start the road to a heart attack).  Before I even had my first course, I was served complimentary gougeres (cheese puffs).  They were perfect.  Still warm, light as air, and cheesy.  Oh so cheesy.  The perfect gougeres.Because the evening was so chilly, I selected the soup out of my three choices for the first course.  It was Soupe de Topinambour, a Jerusalem artichoke veloute, with smoked bacon and a watercress custard.  It too was perfect.  Seriously.  It was one of the best soups I've had in a long time, silky, rich, perfectly seasoned, and completely comforting.  I was relieved I had saved one piece of bread which I used to sop up every last drop.For my entrée, I was torn between the duck confit and the beef short rib ravioli.  Both were alluring, and in the end I went with the Raviolis de Boeuf, braised beef short rib ravioli, porcini confit, butternut squash, sage, and Parmesan.  The dish featured four large raviolis filled with unctuous beef, topped with meaty mushrooms, mushroom foam, long strips of fresh Parmesan, a little butternut squash, and finally some crumbled crispy sage.  It was very meaty, both from the beef and meatiness of the mushrooms, very comforting and delicious, but I secretly wished I had gotten the duck confit.  Perhaps next time!Dessert was another winner.  I selected the Tarte au Noix de Pecans et Chocolat, a chocolate pecan tart with caramelized pears and chocolate vanilla ice cream.  The crust was slightly thicker than I would have expected, but it was the perfect texture, not too firm or dry (which can be the case with a thicker crust).  The chocolate was more of a background note to the pecans, which was fine because there was chocolate drizzled all over the plate, and the nuttiness of the tart was excellent.  The pears were slightly gingery and tart, an excellent foil to the sweetness and nuttiness of the tart.  The chocolate vanilla ice cream was a nice balance of both swirled together in one perfectly creamy scoop.  It was served at the exact texture it should have been, soft enough to easily slide a spoon through, but not melting all over the plate.  This was a lovely dessert.",5,1,1,Victoria K.,"Cranston, RI",579,664,2519

If anything, it feels like a sheik NYC Destination frequented by theater-goers dressed for the opera. We were visited by no fewer than 2 sommeliers. Granted, we were taking our sweet time enjoying each other's company and the ambiance, so I couldn't tell if it was driven more by ""these people look confused,"" or ""we need to get these people out of here."" But no matter. We ended up ordering a bottle of ""steel fermented, buttery, floral, summer white"" from some region of France. We opted for one of the bottles that was NOT $1200 or above. As much as I'd like to know what a $1200 bottle of wine tastes like, my palate is just not refined enough to deserve it!My date ordered the oysters for an appetizer (he loved them), and steak frites for dinner. I had the famed Coc Au Vin. Helloooooo unrefined palate, I think we've found heaven. The chicken was so juicy and tender it literally fell off the bone. The sauce with mushrooms, onions, and hand-rolled pasta was mouth-watering. It felt like a regal meal. Every bite was delicious. M pet peeve, however, was that my date ordered his steak medium rare, and it came out medium well. WHY DOES EVERY RESTAURANT HAVE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF THIS BASIC REQUEST??????????? For any/all of you chefs out there, I shall break this down:Rare = bloody.Medium rare = minimally bloody (i.e., cook it a little longer)Medium = pink on the inside, no blood (i.e., cook it a little longer)Medium well = less pink in the middle, more well-done than medium (i.e., cook it a little longer)Well done = well done (i.e., cook it a little longer)This is not rocket science. It's beef.I definitely recommend this restaurant for a date night on the UWS. If you're not feeling date-y, there is also a communal table where you can sit among people eating alone and/or couples and groups, which makes it a friendly environment to go and have a delightful (chicken) dinner on your own.

So, I ask you, how can this be? I will tell you. A huge mound of Arugula in a bowl was placed in front of me. In the bowl were two cherry tomatoes, which had been peeled, and the absolute thinnest shaving, about an inch long, of cheese. I asked for the dressing on the side, and got additional dressing on the side. I thought I made it clear I wanted to put the dressing on myself. Eating an entire bowl full of arugula, with their lemon olive oil as dressing which I did not like at all made me feel sick. The tomatoes really stood out as my favorite part of the dish.My boyfriend had the pate described on the menu as such: pâté  bourguignon -- guinea hen with red wine bacon, pearl onion and mushrooms. Pearl onion means just that-- one pearl onion.Entree was a dish of scottish salmon, roasted eggplant caviar with chickpea hummus and basil oil. The salmon came as two 3 or so oz pieces. Crisp on both sides. I've never seen anything like it. I can't even imagine how hot the pan would have neede to be to do that. But, as a result, it was dried out. A few degrees of done past the way I was hoping it would be.  The texture of salmon is a beautiful thing and it was a shame for it to be ruined like this. I would have much rather preferred a thicked, but smaller piece that was cooked to highlight salmon's gorgeous texture, not showcase the chef's ability to sear it on both sides. My boyfriend, who used to be the chef that cooked every piece of meat at some really nice restaurants, disagreed with me on this. He was amazed by its beauty and subsequently impressed. When I first saw the ingredients of this dish, I thought I was in heaven, because they are my most favorite flavors. I love salmon, eggplant puree and hummus. But they honestly did not go well togehter here at Bar Boulud. i mention the location because I really think somewhere else could have done a much better job. I honestly wasn't going to eat it at all. I hated it. But I felt like that was rude to my boyfriend who took me to lunch, so I made him eat a piece of my salmon and i ate the other. Its an odd thing to have to force yourself to eat the food of a chef everyone raves about. We literally laughed at our dessert. What kind of ridiculous idea is putting shaved ice chips on top of a chocolate mousse in 100 degree weather, or any weather for that matter? The ice melted all over the pot of ""chocolate creme"" until it looked absolutely disgusting. They also put halves of soupy apricots in with it, kind of just mixed in. The flavor was just average, although I may have been distracted by the pools of water in my mousse and spoon. We then shared the grapefruit like tart. It was about a half inch wide and four inches long. No contrasting flavors, with a peeled segment of grapefruit slipt in half placed on top. Bland. Boring. But better than the ""pot of chocolate creme"" by far. the service-- It annoys me when servers interrupt me or my boyfriend-- blatently and mid-sentence-- to ask how everything is. My theory is if they spent a single second observing me instead of interrupting me 20 times, they could tell a lot more than me just saying ""yes, its fine, thank you."" Obviously if I havent touched my entree other than a few bites, i dont like it. They waited until I gave half to the person I was with and told them I honestly didn't like it and then forced myself to eat what was left to ask me if they could get me something else-- if they really wanted to, they would have when I was sitting there uninterested in my food. I asked the person who took my dessert order a question, and she responded by reading off the menu the description, and then realized she'd read the wrong description for what I was asking about. If someone who works there was that uninterested in the food, why should I be excited? Bar Boulud should serve as an entry to justifying spending $200 a person at Daniel. It should set the stage for the star-- leave you interested and wanting more. For the same money, of roughly $30 a person not including drinks, I could have enjoyed an amazing experience at Gotham.",2,1,0,Raquel S.,"Philadelphia, PA",49,219,8
4.0,7/13/2010,"I went to Bar Boulud for lunch the first day of Restaurant Week.  Overall we  had a great dining experience.  Knowing that the charcuterie at Bar Boulud is supposed to be top notch I started with the ""terrine de porc."" While I haven't had terrine in the past to compare this to, my chef friend reconfirmed my suspicions that it was quite good.  All I know is I enjoyed it.  For the second course I tried the ""steak roti"" which was accompanied by glazed carrots and black olive jus.  The portion was surprisingly generous and overall it was tasty.  My friend ordered the winning main course.  He went with the ""gnocchi de pomme de terre"" which was gnocchi, tomato confit with zucchini and roasted garlic pesto parmesan.  There was nothing we could find wrong with this beautiful summer dish.  GET THE GNOCCHI!  For the dessert I had the ""pot de creme au chocolat et au cafe,"" which was the richest chocolate creme I had ever taste topped with crunchy things and a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Maybe it was just me, but this was almost too rich.  My friend had the ""gateau roule aux fruits rouges"" which neither of us liked.  It combined a light mint sorbet with a heavy, not that great cake.  Not worth getting.So to sum it up, if you go for restaurant week, make sure to try the gnocchi!",0,0,0,Sarah D.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,36,6

I loved that we got to sample 4 of Daniel Boulud's creations instead of having to commit to one.

The first round you can choose from a selection of pastries, followed by your usual appetizer, main course and dessert. There are about 4-5 choices in each group, together Tingting L. covered 2 in each. All our dishes were good and would rank above average, though I wouldn't say anything wowed me.

First of all, our hostess was a delight: very sweet, apologetic when necessary, and accomodating.  It is she who deserves all 2 of these stars.  I would have given her more if it did not appear that the stars are actually allocated to the entire restaurant.  Our ""waitress"" seated 5 other couples at the big table.  All were poured water before we were.  The order of all was taken before ours.  At some point, my friend saw our hostess wiz by, and he asked if she might take our order.  She very kindly did, although it was clearly not her job to do so.  She was sweet enough to make recommendations and to write our order on her hand.  Again, hostess, we appreciated you.  All other communal diners received their meals.  Some had theirs taken away before we were served.  Finally my 3 pieces of cheese showed up, not a good or even marginal value for $14.  My fellow diner's croque madame looked great, and he seemed to like it.  Our ticket was $51 for a sandwich, glass of house wine, 3 pieces of cheese, and a lemonade.  Our waitress actually did bring us that.  She did not bring our drinks or food, however.  When asked to put 1/2 the bill on the card and 1/2 to be paid with cash, she snarled.  Then, she noted ""it would be much easier if you would let me know you require special accomodation earlier in the meal,"" to which I would have liked to reply ""we would have let you know if you had taken our order or served us at all.""  I didn't get a chance to let her know.  Overall, the food was overpriced, atmosphere was fine, location is convenient, and the restaurant would be better served if they employed the accomodating hosts and hostesses as wait staff instead.",2,0,0,Brooke Augusta W.,"Brooklyn, NY",210,45,20
3.0,5/23/2010,"Hey Daniel, my two cents:FOOD-Exceptional.ATMOSPHERE-Cool, chic, great vibe, sublimely sophisticated.SERVICE-falls short, way short...........like off the map!!!OVERALL: GREAT PLACE HAMPERED BY SUB PAR SERVICE.In my view a great dining experience consists of the confluence of great food, great service complimented by great atmosphere. Well, not that restaurant czar Daniel Boulud cares about what a certain yelper writes, but remember us yelpers, foodies, dining patrons are fuel that energizes this industry. So here's my opinion.After taking in an enjoyable play (Promises, Promises.......I'll write about it later), my party of four arrived at BB. No question.........the moment you walk in the door, you feel the vibe of a cool chic restaurant. The establishment is abuzz with a nice mix of young and old, well dressed dining patrons. The place has really got a nice feel. We were pleasantly met by our hostess and promptly seated. So for atmosphere, I'm liking this place very much.Once ordering our drinks, I started to peruse the menu. An what wonderful menu. Diverse offerings spanned the menu from the terrines, salads, soups, charcuterie, entrees to the desserts. Wine list was equally as intriguing and diverse. So at this point the food component is looking equally as wonderful as the atmosphere. And what we ordered did not disappoint!!!!.......braised cheek terrine, potato leek soup,  pan fried bream, crab salad, steak frites all were excellent, matching the cool, chic, sublimely sophisticated atmosphere.So the atmosphere FIVE stars, food FIVE stars...............what's the problem? THE SERVICE.Bar Boulud orients it's service, like most other restaurants, one waiter, multiple servers, water servers. I'm okay with that. The key to this service presentation, is the waiter. His/her role is to present and enhance the menu to his/her patrons. Also, the waiter must then orchestrate the courses, with the drinks, wine, dessert and coffee. Well, this is where the ""hip-ness"", and ""cool style"" goes flat. Our waiter was about as inspiring as a teenager working behind a McDonald's counter taking your order."" I'll have two number 3's, a number 5, a Happy Meal..............yadda, yadda,ya"". Alright it was 11:00PM, and maybe he was tired, so I should have more patience and understanding.............""Bulls@#t !!!!!!......... If I'm willing to pay $75-125 per person for a dining experience I need my waiter to have a good command of the menu, be engaging, I need him to tease my palate with a few suggestions and offerings. I need him/her to check on my table periodically, I need him to orchestrate the courses and ensure my dining experience was exceptional. Didn't happen........So, I'm sure Daniel doesn't need my opinion or advice, he's doing pretty well. But ladies and gentlemen, we are the fuel that energizes restaurants every night in New York and other cities............so if you have a great experience at a given establishment.......do tell and ""yelp"" it out.

Who knew an omelet without cheese could taste so flavorful? It had just the right amount of herbs for a unique taste but not overpowering. The soup was good, but nothing stood out for my tastebuds to remember it one week later. The pear tart dessert did not work for either of us. Word of advice: chocolate syrup with pear equals a big no-no. What was worse, the syrup tasted store bought. Yuck.   Of the items from my pre-fixe, the most impressive were the croissant and dessert. The croissant had a deep buttery flavor and was very flaky, similar to what one may find in France. The Floating Island dessert consisted of a meringue sitting atop a yummy crème anglaise (vanilla custard sauce), which I nearly licked off the plate. The fresh berries, yogurt and granola were just that: simple and expecting.

The food quality at Bar Boulud was OK, but not amazing...and it's nowhere close to what you'd get at Daniel. I understand the pricing is more reasonable, but I don't think the food quality should suffer so much in that trade-off.We kept it pretty simple and got a Salade Roquette which came with baby arugula, blood orange, radish, fennel, black olives, and a citrus vinaigrette. For our main we had the Roulet roti which is roasted chicken breast, pine nuts, braised swiss chard, currants, and smoked onion mashed potatoes. For both the salad and the main, I felt like I was eating a diner. The flavors were very basic and nothing out of the ordinary. The food quality was average at best. And, for all of this mediocre fare, the check came to over $40 per person.This place is one of Daniel Boulud's, so with that kind of name you'd expect excellence, even if it is a casual place. However, I left feel like I just ate at an overpriced Bennigan's on a nice piece of real estate.Also, we sat in the outdoor seating section which was a big mistake.

There were no vegetarian entree options, but the kitchen was kind enough to fix a special vegetarian dish for me - cooked spinach with veggies and hushpuppies on top of mashed potatoes. Despite its simplicity it was both flavorful and filling. My boyfriend, on the other hand, did not enjoy his dish. He ordered the braised short rib ravioli and compared it to Chef Boyardee. But we both loved our desserts - the pear tart and the parfait.Overall, the experience was enjoyable and was the perfect precursor to a matinee at the nearby movie theater.

But my meal, oh I was so, so sad, the sauce was clearly burnt on my chicken and the chicken was over cooked, and I would not have said anything if someone else at the table hadn't ordered the same thing and had the same problem (it tasted like the residue left on a bbq smells).  Then my sister's dish (monk fish) - had clams that were so over cooked she could actually press on them quite firmly with her fork and they would just bounce right back into shape.  She said they were like ""stale gumdrops.""  Now if I go back and have a different experience I will most certainly update this posting, but this was one of, if not THE, most disappointing meals I have had while living in NYC for the past 6 years.

3.0,1/5/2010,"I came to Bar Boulud with a group of friends for New Years Day brunch.  We were all feeling the effects of minimal sleep and one-glass-too-many of champagne, and were huuuuuuungry and beggggggging for coffee.  In short, one glance at our table and it was obvious that we had thoroughly enjoyed NYE.  The surprising part here is that it was even more obvious that the waitstaff had too.  They were ALL one step behind, on just about everything.  Even the guy whose soul responsibility was to fill up coffee (he didn't strike me as the party-animal type).  I had to ask for every refill I got, and it took them about 45 minutes to come take our order.  The waiter acted as though we were inconveniencing him in order to get basic service.  Everything came at once even though a few people had ordered multiple courses, and generally, the service was just not worth the tip we felt obligated to give.  The food, however, was phenomenal.  It's no shocker that Daniel is behind the scenes here.  He is a pretty engaging manager and I don't doubt that his staff can generally expect him to pop his head into the kitchen at any given moment, and it shows with the food quality and presentation.  Very clean, savory, delicious.  I ordered the Croque Madame and it was very good (however, I actually prefer the Croque Madame at Le Monde on 113th and Broadway).  The coffee, when we were able to get any, was also great.  I should admit that I went into Bar Boulud with high expectations.  I got started on my ""Daniel Boulud"" kick at Restaurant Daniel where everything from the way they set the table to how they pour their wine is perfected, so I suppose it would be fair to lower my expectations for the less classy chains of his, but I didn't. If you're looking for service, don't bother coming here, but if you can get past that, it's definitely worth a visit, particularly if you're a fan of charcuterie.  Though I would tend to suggest you avoid New Years Day just in case.",0,0,0,Antesa J.,"Frederiksberg, Copenhagen, Denmark",378,216,359

2.0,1/3/2010,"Maybe I went on an off-date, but I have to admit that this is one of my most underwhelming meals in NYC for quite some time.  I went on New Year's Day with two friends for brunch and was surprised at how busy the restaurant was, given that they were completely booked.  It took a good 10 minutes to be seated, while the table that I had been assigned was empty the entire time.I was seated towards the back where it was clear that they were understaffed.  It took a while for our waiter to come to us and it was clear that this was going to be the theme of the meal.  We had to ask for water and coffee refills repeatedly and each wait would take about 10 minutes and multiple requests for refills.  The $24 prie-fixe brunch may sound like a good idea, but the portions were small (except some of the main entrees) and they are underwhelming.  The coffee and one small pastry that served as the starter was okay, although our second round of coffee had a burn taste to it and the cup was rather small.  The quiche that the two of us got was lukewarm, but otherwise tasty.  My croque madame was underwhelming as was my friend's herb omelette.  My other friend's pasta dish was good and I wish that I had gotten that.  The apple tart and floating island desserts that we received were rather lackluster.   The meal took much longer than it needed to, as our waiter was basically absent throughout the meal.  I was extremely annoyed at the end of the meal when it took yet another 10 minutes to find our waiter to pay our bill.  Given that I live around the neighborhood, it would've been nice to have a go-to place with Bar Boulud, but this is one of those places where I will celebrate if it was ever to shut down.",0,0,0,Albert C.,"New York, NY",59,129,1
3.0,12/26/2009,"You can tell that the same person is behind Bar Boulud and DBGB- there's definitely a common French-meets-German theme to both, and there's some overlap between the menus. I think I like DBGB better because the menu focuses on the things I like more: sausages, burgers, and beers. Bar Boulud is more steak frites, fine wines, braised meats, and strange ptés.We decided to be adventurous and order the tourte de gibiers: layers of (weird) meats, including pigeon, boar, pheasant, and elk, all wrapped up in pastry. The meats were different- a little bit too gamey for my taste- but if you're looking for something unique and new, this is it. It was a ridiculously large portion- it looked like a slice of layer cake. My bf and I split it, and I was pretty full by the time I finished my half. Strange, considering our waiter gave us a little 'tude when we told him we were splitting an appetizer.For the main course, I had the steak frites. The steak was good, the fries were great- I wasn't blown away, though. Maybe it was because I was already full, or maybe I was expecting something extra because it's Boulud, but it was just very good and very typical steak frites, and nothing more. My bf had the braised beef with carrots, and he really liked it. I have to admit, I was really overwhelmed and intimidated by the wine list. Massive, French, and covering bottles from $30 to $5000. I had no idea where to start. Luckily, they offer many tasting options, where you can get a smaller pour for a lesser price. I opted for the red tasting flight, and got to taste a French bourgogne, an Italian sangiovese, and a California merlot. They were all excellent, and it was nice to be able to try a bunch of things without committing to an entire bottle- definitely try it, especially if you don't quite know where to start with French wine! To sum: I liked BB, but given the choice, I think I would choose DBGB instead- the food and beer menu is a lot more accessible, and it feels like you're getting a great meal at a decent value at a really unique place.",0,0,0,Lisa P.,"New York, NY",38,139,23

3.0,9/28/2009,"3.5 experience overall- Before i try out any famous (by famous, i mean, really expensive $$$$) restaurants, I always like to sample the chef's other places to determine if I like their food enough to go all out on that special occasion. Daniel has been a restaurant i've heard excellent reviews and been recommended to on various occasions. However, bar Boulud didn't really seal the deal so to speak. my steak tartare was excellent, but in a city where tuna and steak tartares are widely available and excellent in taste, i wasn't really blown away by this one in particular. My friend ordered the chicken, and though it was good, again, it wasn't amazingly memorable. my issue with bar boulud was just that. everything was good, but nothing was unforgettable, or amazing to the point where i would be recommending it to any of my other friends. I guess, I also had higher expectations. The service was good, but didn't exceed the above and beyond. If, on a nice day, I happen to be in the area, I may opt to sit outside with a glass of wine.

5.0,8/18/2009,"I've finally gotten back to my yelping again. My friends and I tried this place for restaurant week lunch ($24.07) the last week of July. They can seat you outside or inside, but it was a hot and balmy day so we opted for the inside seating. The interior of the restaurant was very nice, old architecture with a modern twist. The menu they gave us for restaurant week was the same menu they showed online. It's great they didn't pull the bait and switch like other restaurants do. There were 3 of us and 3 of each course, so we ordered and shared everything. To make it less obvious that we wanted everything, I ordered the first of everything, my friend ordered the second of everything and my other friend ordered the 3rd item of everything. =) While we waited for our food we had their bread with butter. The bread was very good, crusty on the outside and soft on the inside, and well, everything tastes better with butter!For appetizers we had the pate, mesclun salad and gazpacho and watermelon soup. I enjoyed the pate the most. They gave us a good amount and it was very tasty, I love pate. The gazpacho soup with watermelon in it was pretty good. The soup was blended and I guess it settles out and so each spoonful is different in flavor. One might be sweeter than another and one more tomatoey. The salad was okay, I'm just more of a meat eater and I absolutely love soups.For the main course we had a huge bowl of mussels in a slightly creamy sauce, beef short rib ravioli and coq au vin. The bowl of mussels was huge! They gave us maybe 40 mussels. They had to empty our bowl of shells twice. The coq au vin (chicken) was very good. It was moist and tasty. I'd always wanted to try it after hearing about the dish on Top Chef. The beef short rib ravioli was the best entrée of them all. The sauce was so savory. Each bite left you salivating and wanting more. I love French food, and this dish was the epitome of those masterful sauces.For dessert we had a praline mousse/pudding like dessert with strawberries, mango and passion fruit sorbet, and an amazing biscuit macaroon with chocolate and a side of coffee ice cream. All the desserts were very rich and tasty, with multiple layers of flavor and excellent presentation. But that macaroon with chocolate and ice cream, it was absolutely to die for. The desserts are fantastic!The only bad remark I have about this place would be that the service is a bit slow, even when there weren't many people in the restaurant.

5.0,7/17/2009,"We went on the recommendation of a friend's sister who lives in NY and were very grateful. A group of about 10 of us took over the back u-shaped communal table (where the servers and sommelier can walk in the center and take orders and answer questions right across from you--brilliant, I thought). Focusing on the specialties of Lyon, France, Boulud delivered an exquisite-looking charcuterie plate that the boys enjoyed immensely. Normally I would indulge in a little head cheese and cured meats myself, but it's not so much on the list of safe items for pregnant persons, so I stuck with the delicious rustic, toasted wheat bread that came with it. Dinner was hard to decide--even with Will T and I doing our splitting a couple of dishes thing, we were sad to miss out on the other four things on the menu that we would have ordered if we had multiple stomachs, like the sausage and lentil soup or the sea bass. We finally settled on the frisee salad with chunks of jamon as well as THE best pork chop we've ever had. Bone in, perfectly cooked and tender (why is this so hard to duplicate at home?!), with a unique topping of chopped pears in a light cream sauce. We were (literally) in hog heaven. We also tasted a bite of a friend's coq au vin that melted in your mouth. No room to even finish what we ordered, nevermind dessert, so I can't speak to that, but I did have a sip of the nice (read: $$$$) chateau neuf de pap that the hubs got for the table on the recommendation of the cool sommelier that chatted with us for a while. We're pretty hopeless in choosing French wines, so the help was welcome and the wine was really complex and delicious.

2.0,6/30/2009,"I didn't really have any aspiration to come here, but I really wanted to try some of chef Boulud's cuisine without splurging on the infamous Daniel.  So thus, I came for lunch to say I've eaten Daniel cookin'.  Slightly snobby service, but definitely attentive.They offer a prix-fixe lunch and it's based on what entree you order.  I was sold when there was charcuterie offered as the entree.  For $29, I got a beet/endive salad and a meat and cheese plate.The salad was well prepared, though very boring.  The lemon-based dressing and bland beets and endive made for a sad salad.  The salad was a nice size, though.The meat spread was fairly ordinary with: chicken livers, chicken terrine, and ham...  No unique flavor, no fun meats.  Just extremely basic.  The cheeses and vegetables definitely made up for the mediocrity.  A huge wedge of blue cheese had a perfect nuttiness and pungency.  The other large wedge of creamy sheep's milk was perfectly soft and spreadable on some toast.  Alongside the cheeses and meats were carrots and mushrooms in some unique preparation with odd spices.  Absolutely delicious.  Thus, the centerpiece of the charcuterie plate was definitely overshadowed by the good cheese and veggies.  Not what I expected to pay for...So, not my recommendation for a nice lunch, but perhaps you may want to try it.  Maybe another one of his many restaurants is a better selection.",0,0,0,Solomon W.,"Austin, TX",571,2577,7
5.0,6/9/2009,"Although I'm the 65th person to review Bar Boulud, I was probably one of the first people to actually come here  -- I came for the New Years Eve party in 2008, a month or two before it was officially opened for business to the public -- it was still under construction, there was still paper covering the outside windows... Chef Daniel Boulud was there shaking hands and posing for pictures, they served charcuterie and wine and champagne, plus there was a DJ and dancing -- It was pretty great.I came back for dinner a few months later with a friend... We split the large charcuterie plate with bread and mustards and beets with horseradish, and shared a bottle of wine... Because one of the employees recognized my friend from culinary school, we got some complimentary dessert -- which was very much appreciated.I came back for dinner a few months later with another friend... I got the Frisée Lyonnaise (which was incredible, perhaps the best version of this, a favorite of mine, I've had in New York City -- the chicken livers and lardons were just perfect, and the lettuce was dressed just right), the the Tuna Niçoise (which was also incredible, perhaps the best version of this, a favorite of mine, I've had in New York City -- the tuna crudo and cured white anchovies were both awesome), and then the Boudin Noir (which was, believe it or not, once again, incredible -- what wonderful texture and flavor, with lovely contrast from the caramelized apple)... My dinner companion got the Butternut Squash Soup then the Escargots and then the Coq au Vin -- he gave them all rave reviews, I had a taste of each and they were indeed praise worthy... We split a bottle of white wine and then a bottle of red wine.I came back for brunch a few months later with a different friend... For three courses $37 before tax or tip may at first seem a bit steep, but it really makes for a special occasion, and considering the excellent food you get and the overall amazing experience, it actually ends up being a bargain... I got the Salad Beetrave (which very much hit the spot and really stimulated my appetite -- the beets and endive and apples and goat cheese were all extremely fresh and tasty), then the Boudin Blanc (which was decadent and delicate, super smooth and flavorful), then the Croque Madam (which was terrific -- high quality ham and gruyère on with a perfectly-fried farm egg on really wonderful bread)... My meal partner got the Parfait with Yogurt and Granola and Fruit, then the Shrimp with Tomato Confit and Bibb Lettuce and Horseradish Dressing, then the Duck with Potato and Onion Hash and a Soft-Boiled Egg -- he gave them rave reviews, I had a taste of each and they were indeed praise worthy... We split a bottle of champagne.Today I came back for lunch and, surprisingly according to my usual preferences, wanted to eat outside, Al Fresco -- I wanted to give it a try since it was overcast and drizzly, making for a decreased amount of pedestrians and traffic... I got the Dégustation de Charcuterie (large, to share -- but I ate it all alone -- I felt like treating myself, because my life is just so terribly hard -- that was sarcasm, by the way)... I honestly don't remember everything about my meal, I was so busy people-watching, I had a tune stuck in my head, my heart was fluttering, perhaps I was a little bit drunk, and I was so very distracted with observing what everyone else was eating and drinking while simultaneously eavesdropping... There was some sort of pulled rabbit, lamb with eggplant, chicken liver with cognac, beef cheek with pistachio -- and some other stuff -- honestly, I forget... My meal lasted about two-and-a-half hours, so of course I treated myself to a bottle of white wine.... Also, the waiter remembered my name from the last visit time I visited!The wine selection is tremendous, with lots of options for each and every budget and for each and every occasion -- I tend to stick with the lowest-priced options which have all been almost shockingly rewarding.The service has always been exceedingly polite and accommodating, warm and charming...

So, when I saw that Daniel B. had a Boudin Blanc (quite possibly my favorite sausage) I had to order it. I will say, that it is difficult not to balk at the idea of a $27 sausage, but Daniel is not joking around here.

It was so so so good.Yes, BB is expensive, but seriously people, if that's an issue, don't go!

2.0,1/19/2009,"1.18.09This review is for an overpriced and more than disappointing brunch.  That is not to say I won't return for dinner, but never again for brunch.  The only reason this review has 2 stars is because I enjoyed my Bloody Mary and the interior design.We were seated at the window, which generally would have pleased me except there was an ugly portable space heater right behind me (these eyesores were throughout the restaurant, another one was in my front view).  Furthermore, the host stand with its all of three hosts at any one time was almost directly facing the tables in the front of the restaurant.  I would recommend requesting a table further into the restaurant if you go.The brunch prix-fixe was two courses for $29 (main with app or dessert), $9 supplement for all three.  We immediately ordered a Bloody Mary (which almost rivaled the Wynn's) and a Kronenbourg for our hungover selves.  I wanted to do the entree and dessert choice and J, the app and entree.After ordering, the waiter started with the up-sell (one of the most grievous restaurant offenses in my book.. hello, Megu).  Infuriatingly, J agreed to his suggestion of an $8 side of 'Super Green Spinach.'  Ok, whatever.  (Also, this is a practice here as I heard another waiter doing it at a nearby table).I dug into the butter sprinkled with a tiny portion of coarse sea salt, which in hindsight, was by far the best part of the meal.J's appetizer, the 'Crevette, Tomate et Laitue' arrived.  It was huge, so we shared it.  The bibb lettuce was annoying to eat, served in giant leafy wholes.  The shrimp were extremely anemic tasting in a new, odd way.  They almost tasted like they had been washed of all their flavor.  Actually the whole salad tasted like that.  There was the lightest watery dressing on it, labeled 'horseradish yogurt dressing.'  I didn't taste horseradish or yogurt.  More like water.For our entrees, J had the 'Boudin Blanc.'  It was a large sausage with the soft texture of soggy bread.  Needless to say, I could not get past the texture and was glad I hadn't ordered that.  The side of mashed potatoes was excellent.  There was also the strangest tasting thing lying alongside the sausage.  We couldn't figure out what it was; J guessed squash and I guessed some sort of foreign pear.  Of course, our waiter had completely disappeared after we ordered and the busboy hadn't the slightest idea.  At dessert, we were informed it was an apple?My entree was the 'Saumon Marchand de Vin,' a self-described scaloppini of salmon, swiss chard, wild mushrooms and local turnips.  There was an enormous portion of salmon, easily enough for two for a dinner portion in a fine-dining establishment.  I gave half of it to J.  It was OK.  There was also an enormous bed of swiss chard and four different types of mushrooms.  The turnips were the finest slivers.  It was just a LOT of mediocre food.Oh, and I almost forgot about our superfluous side of spinach.  It was actually very green and very good (second fav after the butter), but I really wish I could have just had that in my entree instead of the copious amounts of swiss chard.Our waiter magically reappeared at long last to ask if we wanted dessert.  At this point, I realized the waiter had ignored our original order (where I had ordered the 'Ile Flotante') and given us a double portion of the shrimp salad.  I really wanted my floating island, so I just let it go and re-ordered it.  He then pressed for coffee.  I was rather annoyed at this point, but reconsidered since I needed the energy and got a double espresso.  The dessert was good, the vanilla creme anglaise was delicious, but we could not finish.All in all, the total bill was over a hundred dollars for two, not including tip.  Which is alright if the brunch is delicious but was obviously not the case.  This is New York, the home of the best brunches ever, and Bar Boulud didn't even come close.  This would have been the perfect place to take my parents for brunch, but I would be truly embarrassed by the food.",2,1,2,Sara S.,"New York, NY",157,107,121

My doppelgänger suggested we meet at Bar Boulud primarily for its proximity.We were seated right next to the charcuterie slicer. After the third or fourth time the man working the meat cutting implement brushed against my friend, he took her up on her suggestion and gave her a few pieces for her troubles.

No.I've long been a person who's relied on desserts to end a meal on a high note. In many instances, a perfect ending can even help to erase earlier fumbles (culinary or otherwise). But the pie we received? It nearly seemed as though someone had accidentally sent a candy-making experiment gone wrong out to us.

Bar Boulud also does really great fresh salads; we usually order one for the table so people can have a forkful or two to taste. The one I had last time was a pretty simple one with argula and possibly spinach.

I was starving and it was really hot outside but it was totally worth it. It wasn't very busy when we got there, and we were given a really private table in the back. The decor of the place reminds me of an airport terminal or the DC metro, but it was earthy and simple, which I dig.For starters, I got the pate grand-mere and he got the fromage de tete gilles verot which is made from like... the face of a pig. Really. It didn't seem that appetizing at first, but it was actually extremely good, as was the pate. They gave us huge servings of both, which I never expect at these restaurants, and I probably could have stopped eating at the point. But, I didn't. I had the boeuf aux carottes which is braised steak with carrot puree.  He had the boudin blanc which is truffled white sausage. Both were really good. But. My dish was on the saltier side, which I expected...but even as a salt lover, it was just a little much. The carrot puree took care of it though by balancing it out. The boudin blanc was really good, my boyfriend had a glazed look in his eyes the entire time he ate it...but the texture wasn't my favorite thing in the world. Don't get me wrong it was really good..but I am picky about stuff like that.I forget what wine we got, but it was also really good. My boyfriend is obsessed with wine and deliberated with the waiter for a while. He's one of those people who will smell the wine and tell you what was in the soil, the temperature the season the grapes were planted and picked, whether the person who picked them was in a good mood that day.

3.0,11/5/2008,"Overall, the place is over-hyped because it's under the Daniel Boulud umbrella.  the food was average, at most above-average. I didn't have anything that falls under excellent. I was looking forward to the skate and was disappointed. It wasn't bad but I thought a reputable French resto can do better. The chicken was way too dry to be served. The wait service was just like the food; average. The atmosphere is casual for a Daniel's restaurant. They have a nice outdoor seating area for the summer casuals. Their wine selection earns an impressive mention. The staff was very knowledgeable in regards to pairing. Price is A-OK for what it is. Although some may still find it on the pricey side.So, if you're a Daniel's fan then go for the experience but don't hold a high expectation for the food if you have a selective taste. Lower your expectations and it might taste much better. I've been there once and probably will end up there one more time for business causal dinner but don't expect me to frequent this joint on my own account.

4.0,10/3/2008,I've been here twice now and don't agree with most of the negative reviews I've read.  Food is very good and service was more than helpful and not condescending as some have noted.  We all really enjoyed our main courses (I had the Coq au vin) and the sommelier was very knowledgeable on wine.  This is also a good place to grab a post-show glass of vino since it's right across from the Lincoln Center.,0,0,0,John R.,"Atlanta, GA",3,17,2
4.0,9/25/2008,"I'm giving this place 4 stars for its uniqueness but 3 stars for it's execution. Some of the stuff on the menu were really exciting, all of which we tried. This included the coarse pate, the duck tourte, boudin blanc, and the boudin noir. I mean, how many places offer these things? None that I can think of off the top of my head. But none of the dishes were amazing. The combination of duck, fig, and fois gras should be the most amazing thing in the world, but it just kind of fell flat as did all the other dishes. The dessert list was also kind of weak. You might think this is a really negative review for a 4 stars. That's because when a restaurant has the name Boulud in it, it can't be horrible. I just came in here with higher expectations which were not met. But overall, it was still a very good meal.",0,0,0,Jack L.,"New York, NY",116,112,0

4.0,8/22/2008,"Just ate at BB for the first time.  Having dined at Daniel Boulud's French restaurants on the UES, I was excited to see his new wine bar open on the UWS.  Stepped in to the ""bar"" at 10 p.m. and had a slightly awkward wait despite having made a reservation earlier, and was seated at one of the cushiony booths.  I must say that the cushions of these booths are extremely comfortable (like temperpedic mold to your body).  Perused the wines by the glass list which was surprisingly diverse as it's a heavily Burgundian-focused restaurant.  The Chilean Pinot Noir was terrific, though a tad oak-laden for my tastes.Shared the Provencal mesclun salad, small assorted charcuterie plate and the rillons between two people, which was plenty of food for a late dinner or even at any hour.  The place is known for their expert charcuterie and it's splendid - housemade pate to die for, terrines, headcheese, rilletes, pickled carrots, celery remoulade, grainy mustard, and cornichons.The mesclun salad had nicely contrasting flavors from white anchovy and Picholine olives, along with mandolined paper thin slices of fennel and radish.  The rillons, made of pork belly, are truly fatty, unctuous morsels to be savored with a smear of spicy dijon mustard.I didn't have room for dessert, but they looked tantalizing.Disagree with previous yelpers about the wine blot art - I didn't find it gross or blah.  The emphasis on wine is front and center from the wine barrel above the door, through the decor of the wine stains to the walls in which stones have been neatly piled that echo the Burgundian terroir, to the tremendous wine list.  One star deduction for the hit or miss service.  Our table was attended to by a few different servers and service was not particularly attentive which is less than I expect from a Boulud establishment.",1,0,1,Anna M.,"New York, NY",14,78,0
4.0,7/9/2008,"Why do you go to this restaurant?Because you are interested in the best pate's, to experience frommage de tete and to not order a dinner like steak frites. Or an entree. It is to be treated like a rustic french meal although the decor would tell you different. Gilles Veroit is an award winning pate maker and head cheese in this mans hands is glorious.The Torte Du Canard was amazing. Velvety Foie Gras with figs and a pate all layered and encased by a puff pastry shell. The head cheese was delicious although you have to ask for a side of mustard because the designer small 'garnish' of mustard is not enough. I understand the emphasis is on the flavor of the primary player but mustard is as French as wine. Throw us some more moutarde! The Pate Grand Mere was great as well and the bread is always good at Boulud establishments.The DECOR doesn't fit the food but its Lincoln Center so I guess it couldn't. The ink blot photographs are a great idea but poorly executed. The photographs have no depth and almost no clarity read bad camera. The communal table is usually a great addition to a restaurant but you have to count on sitting next to people that want to talk which usually isn't the case.The SERVICE the night I went there was good. We got the new guy which always annoys me because I got to a place like this to talk about food with the waiter (Whats good tonight? What are your recommendations? What flavors are in this). Experienced waiters will always guide you in the right direction. The waiter we got could barely speak english which isn't too offensive in a  french restaurant, but still annoying.

Service was right on spot and very cordial (what you would expect from a new restaurant, but also from good management). Our orders were brought in in a timely fashion even with the dining area being quite busy. Its not cheap, but not offensively expensive. Its well worth the price for experience.

The walls had huge metal panels holding rocks with light behind them, so the light was diffused through the rocks. Imagine an airplane that has come to rest on a rocky river bed. And the cast of Lost were there! (I got carried away, sorry.) Also like the photos of famous wine stains on the walls.They specialize in pate, so I'm into pate there. We pated it up and it was tasty. I had the peekytoe crab salad and steak frites and they were all good. Blam! You can't beat a good steak frites, so I went home happy.

4.0,4/22/2008,"Based on the many reviews here, I knew what to expect and so we started with the Pate Grand-Pere, which was the perfect start to dinner.  I like the lumpiness and coarseness of having large bits of  foie gras mixed in with ground pork.  It certainly isn't a pate you spread.  The cornichons it came with, the toasted bread, the portion left nothing to be desired.  I had the flight of Whites over dinner and Rob had the flight of Reds and while even Rob liked my white wines, after tasting both mine and his, I have to admit that his were more complex and more interesting overall.  I'd def go back just to further investigate Bar Boulud's wine list.  For entrees, I had the Confit De Canard while he had the Boeuf Aux Carottes.  My duck confit came with a crispy skin and juicy duck meat that was just perfect.  His Boeuf aux Carottes was fork-tender and it was one of his favorite dishes.  The carrot mousseline it came with was delicious (and likely loaded with a good stick of butter) and it would be great if that became one of the Garnitures available on the side.  We finished the evening by sharing the Chocolat Noisette.  All I can say is that there was nothing left on our dessert plate.  We were seated all the way in the back, a couple of tables away from the large round table and while there are definitely better views of the rest of the restaurant, we at least didn't have to deal with being crowded by people standing in the front.  We found on our way out that there's also a large bar downstairs that I'll definitely have to come back to explore.  All in all, we had a solid 4-4.5 star experience.  Prices are average for any nice restaurant in New York and for the quality and consistency of food/wine here, it's a must-do.  It wasn't a formal affair with a change of plate setting per course.  But the food was excellent and like the rest of the pre-Opera crowd, this will become my spot to eat before heading over to the Lincoln Center.",2,0,1,Mog C.,"Hoboken, NJ",172,411,92

The Aioli was fabulous - right consistency, garlicky without being bitter and the crudites and seafood that accompanied were perfectly cooked. We also had the beets with horseradish, the super green spinach (loved that!) and each a plate from the charcuterie menu. I don't eat pork, so the only option I had was the lamb tagine and it was incredibly good.The sommelier was knowledgeable without being pretentious, and I think he took a shine to my date who told him ""we know we want a white from Rhone, but the rest is in your hands."" Had this wonderful Lirac, which was full of flavor and aroma, but didn't linger on the palette or interfered with the taste of the food. Lovely.The sauternes and petit fours rounded off our meal and we were satiated.Needless to say, since this place was my choice, I was deemed to be ""awesome"" by evening's end.Definitely a great place if you want to sit, enjoy a great bottle of wine and food that is simple and delicious.",1,0,0,Ki G.,"SUNNYSIDE, NY",250,710,92
4.0,4/18/2008,"The French Provencal wine bar concept for this restaurant is by very well known French Chef Daniel Boulud. I noticed what must have been planned is that everything in the decor was either a light oak wood or steel which is reminiscent of oak and steel barreled wines. The food can be considered over priced for what they are giving which is very simple food but I very much enjoyed my time there. The service was attentive and formal but some staff could have been warmer. I loved my time there but I love everything in New York including the rats in the subway tracks. If I lived there I would probably give it more like 3 stars. French wine selection was great but that is of course expected.To eat:Cheesey popovers are given after the bread but before the first course so almost like an indulgent large amuse bouch - thank you!The Provencal arugula salad was enormous and appreciated after 3 days of eating enough pizza to last me until my next trip to NYC. Adorned with slivers of fennel and radish added beautiful color but because they are mild foods and so thinly sliced, you hardly knew it was there. What I loved was all of the salty elements of the salad that surprisingly still made me more happy than dehydrated. Deep friend 'chips' of artichoke hearts were salted and added a great crisp. Then what was most plentiful in the salad was the tapenade of kalamata olives as well as whole pieces. Also, large bites of fresh white anchovy to add a meat to the light dish. What made it so balanced was the nutty olive oil as the dressing and creamiest butter that was with the bread.For my entree I had the scallops which were fresh and perfectly sauteed on the outside and still slightly pink and barely cooked at the center. On the plate were two kinds of red cabbage. The exact flavors escape my memory but I recall a sweet whole grain mustard sauce and a hint of apple cider vinegar. The dish ended up being refreshing and not over sauced as a more formal French restaurant would play out this concept. Yet, I still found it to be hearty, comforting and a bit indulgent. There is a great semi circle 'bar' of additional seating in the back that is at usual dinner table height. Great for solo diner but because of the circular shape, 3 people could squeeze on this table for 10 that are desperate for a seat and can still see each other's faces.",1,0,1,Lauren B.,"Beverly Hills, CA",35,103,1

3.0,3/12/2008,"Let me preface this review by saying I am a huge fan of Daniel Boulud and all his restaurants. Bar Boulud does not aspire to compete with the culinary and gastronomic ambitions of Daniel or DB Bistro. It does, however, provide a casual place to enjoy fine wine and good charcuterie. The decor attempts to evoke all things related to wine from the arched ceiling that runs the length of the narrow restaurant that resembles a wine cave to the artwork on the wall showcasing wine stains from various wines. I would recommend grabbing a seat at the bar where only a glass partition separates you from huge masses of terrines and cured meats. You get to watch the chefs assemble your plate which I find visually more fascinating than the view from the booths. There was good selection of wines by the glass. I shared the small degustation (a selection of three pates, some ham, and condiments) with a friend. All the pates I tried were delectable, but I couldn't help but try the ""tourte de canard"" (layers of fig, foie gras, duck, all wrapped in a pastry crust resembling a loaf of bread) that was staring at me in the glass showcase. It was a small slice, but an extremely satisfying choice that I can still savour in my mouth. The appetizers I tried (esgargot and scallops) arrived impeccably presented, but lacked sufficient flavor to match its appearance. The dessert menu was not entirely enticing and the dessert itself was good, but nothing special to comment on. All in all, a decent place to enjoy some wine and good charcuterie, but not without a cost. Although there is an abundance of good wine bars in the city, I would go back to Bar Boulud for its charcuterie, particularly the ""tourte de canard"".",0,0,0,Alexis M.,"New York, NY",0,32,0

Or maybe they used a machine similar to the shimmering red monolith used to slice cold cuts, which was right on the bar for all to see and fear - I pitied the two people who were seated mere inches away from it.

4.0,1/26/2008,"Coq au vin and a bottle of Burgundy (in my case, a $50-something 2005 Drouhin Chorey-les-Beaune) -- a classic combination, and it was pretty satisfying here on the Friday night I went, soon after it'd opened. Then again, what else would you expect from either Boulud or, of course, Drouhin? Solid execution of the classics all around.We started off with a rabbit terrine and a really tasty pork belly -- warm, peppery, crispy meat balancing out all that delightful pork fat that just melts in your mouth. Those were followed by the aforementioned coq au vin and a cooked-exactly-as-ordered steak frites, and finished up with a pear tart and a yummy baba au rhum with roast pineapple.The wine list is unsurprisingly solid, focusing mostly on Burgundy and the Rhone Valley, and divided into ""classics"" from those two regions, New World ""cousins"", ""discoveries"" (lesser-known names and good values), and then a category for random wines outside those two regions (and their respective varietals) that they just happen to like.My only gripe is with this city -- why does it take someone like Boulud to be able to execute bistro staples at this level? It doesn't take the creativity of a superstar chef to do it -- after all, the reason they're staples is because everyone knew how to do it, right? Can't anyone cook in this town?This is exactly the type of place serving exactly the type of food where a party of two should be able to just walk in and at least get a seat at the bar, but you can't. At least not right now. If I lived in the neighborhood, it's the type of place I'd go to if I was feeling like some good, hearty food and some nice wine. But to make a reservation days in advance? It doesn't make sense -- not because the food's not that great, but just because it feels wrong. Maybe I'm just weird that way.Anyway, as a result of that, if two of you walk in on a Friday night, even towards the later end of things, you're probably gonna have to wait. And forget about waiting at the bar, because everyone's eating at it, and it's all the way in the back anyway. To Bar Boulud's credit, it's done the best it can with an awkward space, but you're still gonna have to wait uncomfortably, wedged between the door and the host stand and the stairs leading down to the restrooms, shifting around every so often to avoid getting smashed by the door that every passing idiot insists on pushing into you instead of pulling open. (Fellas, wouldn't it be so much more polite to just pull open the door and let your lady friend walk in first, instead of pushing the door into the nice little Yelper?)Of course, that won't stop me from going back, but probably on a slow night. And too bad it's not open later -- 11pm's too early for a place like this to close on the weekends. Given the shortage of quality alternatives, it'd be really nice if it could do this city a service and stay open another hour or three.",3,1,2,Edwin C.,"New York, NY",35,78,5
4.0,1/17/2008,"Bar Boulud opened up recently and I went last night with my friend with the intent of having some wine and then a able.  Turns out, you might as well just eat at the bar if you have a seat since the lay out is basically walk in-hostes-dining tables-bar-back dining tables (with booths all along the a bar area).Also, due to this you really don't have anywhere to wait for a table (as at the bar at most places) if you don't make a reservation.The art (photographs I think) along the walls just above one's head at the booths look like some modern quasi vagina looking O'Keefe work.The food.  The menu has many many options.  Lots of meats (the saw basically sits on the bar), pate, soups, salads, regional dishes, steak frittes, typical french bistro fare and lots of little different deserts.I had the butternut squash and mussel bisque which was nice becuase it was not overtly salthy or seafoody. After that I had the coq au vin and it was very good.  Smelled amazing and to the point that 2 people stopped to ask what I was having.My friend had the escargot which were also very aromatic and full of flavor and the steak frittes (boring; but, good).We each had a desert, she had something chocolatey and I had a hazlenut ladyfinger, chantilly cream and cinamon-orange ice cream.We also shared a bottle of something white, I let her pick that was Californian, which suprised me as most of the wine list appeared to French (running from high to low in price).Overall, if you know you are going to the theater across the street at Lincoln Center and have a few days to a week you should certainly call ahead in advance and make a reservation before or after...compared to much of the surrounding popular pre/post-theater restaurants of Fiorello's, Josephina, Landmarc, PJ Clarkes this one certainly stands out.",0,0,0,justin v.,"NY, NY",20,364,0
5.0,1/13/2008,"You do not have to be a meat eater to go there... but if you like charcuteries, you are sure to feel like you have gone to heaven.  The experience was nearly orgasmic.A reservation is a must.... Went with a friend after the movies and although we were told a 20 minute wait, it ended up being more like 50.  There is no place to really hangout so it is not fun waiting near the door.  However, the wait was totally worth it.They start you with a small cheese brioche compliments of the chef.  It is a one bite that starts to get you on the road to the wonderful adventure that is in store for you.  You had better go with an appetite!We started with the degustation plate and cleared it.  I swear if we could have asked for one of each of the terrines, we would have.  We then had a sausage in brioche.  To say it this way makes it so much more mundane than it was... My gosh, I want another one today!My friend then had the salad of mesclums.  She swears it was one the best she had in a long time.  I did reach over to taste and it was indeed an explosion of tastes in the mouth... I chose the black pudding.  It has been a while since I had such a great version of blood sausage.  I believe the last time it was this good was at Cafe Lucio in Madrid.Oh, lest not forget the wine experience...  it is after all a ""wine bar""!  The Somelier was amazing.  He takes your food order and also recommends what could go with the meal.  The wine by the glass are as amazing as the one by the bottle.  You can be reasonable or absolutely splurge.  Prior to committing, you can taste the wines.  Not many places that I know you can do that.We did make some room for desert and we were handsomely rewarded.  We shared the petit fours.  My gosh, again an explosion of tastes.  There were about 5 small bites, and each one of them had you wishing there was more.  Next time, I am not sharing.  I cannot wait to go back!!",2,0,0,Genevieve L.,"London, United Kingdom",62,40,50
