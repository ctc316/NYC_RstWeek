4.0,4/16/2019,"Have been here a few times... Great service, enough choices for brunch/ lunch items. Everything was delicious, although I found the Croque Madame sandwich to be a bit too heavy & too mushy for me... others may love it though. Tasted the lemon pancakes with berries,  they were delicious! Basket filled with boulangerie items was very worth it as it was full sized bakery goods not mini ones as some other places tend to do. Overall yummy & we'll be back I'm sure.",0,0,0,K D.,"White Plains, NY",0,15,9
5.0,4/7/2019,Delicious food ! I had a coffee and the lemon pancakes with berries and they were so good ! The lemon in the pancakes was perfect! My boyfriend had the French toast that came with I cream and caramel drizzle it fills you up and is delicious the almond croissants are so pretty and taste amazing ! Make a reservation to guarantee seating and they let you choose between outdoor or indoors since it was a nice day we chose outdoors and i don't regret it one bit the waiters come by and fill up your cup of water and make sure everything is well organized !,0,0,0,Yulissa C.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,41,43
5.0,3/20/2019,"Wow, this place has such great vibes. The service here is amazing came here during lunch time and had the French onion soup. Definitely the best and the heartiest French onion soup I ever had. Flavorful and had chunks of beef in there. I would definitely come back just for the soup and to try a few other things as well.",1,0,1,Samantha T.,"Manhattan, NY",5,35,55
5.0,3/17/2019,"Brunch at Lafayette was my favorite of many delicious meals during a recent weekend in NYC. We ordered the bread basket for our table of 4 which included a variety of breads and pastries. It was a good assortment for 4 people. 2 of us opted for the Bloody Marie while the other 2 chose a cocktail with green juice and tequila. Both were delicious complements to the brunch. I ordered the salmon benedict and it was the best I have had, it had a nice tangy hollandaise that wasn't too rich.",0,0,0,Jaclyn W.,"Wausau, WI",92,24,24

4.0,2/28/2019,You come to Lafayette for the old school nyc luxe ambiance. And the wine. And the complimentary bread. And the desserts. Then the food. Not that the food is bad- it's just not the star of the show here!The restaurant is gorgeous and can seat large parties. Great for a fancy after work get together and awesome for a date! The bread is delicious and fresh served with yummy good quality butter. The burger was good and the fries- delish! I wasn't a huge fan of the duck bolognese. I couldn't really taste the duck and felt that the flavors were muddled. Food comes quickly but the waiters are kind and don't rush you.

3.0,2/23/2019,"I've previously dropped by Lafayette for mostly chocolate croissants, which are solid and a nice pick me up since I work in the area. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful - very high tea vibe.For restaurant week (winter 2019), we stopped by Lafayette for $26pp two-course lunch. I wasn't adventurous enough to try the beef tongue, so ordered the tomato soup as my starter and the duck leg confit as my entree. The tomato soup was refreshing, but the duck leg confit was overcooked. The quality was fine but the quantity of food was a bit small. I probably won't be back for a meal but will continue to drop by for pastries.",0,0,0,Judy S.,"New York, NY",322,1183,1192
1.0,2/23/2019,"Unpleasant experience. The sommelier was incredibly condescending. Ordering a bottle of wine should be a delightful moment of dining out, and this guy ruined it.

5.0,2/15/2019,Absolutely loved this place. Very french with a New York finger print! As Mara our wine pairing said. Service is exceptional and the food was beyond expectations. Do your self a favor and try their Steak!! Amazing experience all around since the moment we stepped in. And They even gave us complementary macaroons with the check in a beautiful box.

3.0,2/10/2019,"Only got drinks here: I think all we got was two penecilins? Anyway, they were both fine- I think each one cost like $16, so the total came out to like $32 before tax and tip.I think the ambiance is nice here, and spots like this I feel are hard to come by in this neighborhood (noho?). However, the prices are a little bit high, and the bar is a little bit too crowded at times. I can't really comment on the quality of the food since I didn't have any, but based on the drinks alone, I think three stars is just about right.",1,0,0,Matt L.,"New York, NY",108,694,604
5.0,2/5/2019,"I work near by so I come here quite a bit when I need a good place for a business lunch.  I love the atmosphere. It's a beautiful space...open, airy and filled with light....like something out of another time.  (The outside patio is also a great hang spot when the weather is nice.)The food is consistent and very, very good.  My go to is the Rotisserie Chicken Salad.  The chicken is always perfectly cooked, hot, juicy and full of flavor.  (When I say always, I'm not kidding.  I've had like 50 of these salads over the last few years. They get it right. Every. Single. Time.)Then there's the table bread.  The bread that makes you realize how sh*tty all the other bread you've been eating is, the bread that make you abandon your ""no carb, keto, paleo"" diet without a second thought...warm and soft on the inside with a chewy, yet crunchy crust.  Served with a salted pat of butter.  So good, you want to cry. It's seriously some of the best bread I've ever had anywhere. I also love the french fries, which I've seen on some NYC ""Top 10"" fry lists.  They are big enough to share so get an order for the table. They are the small skinny fries and they always come out piping hot.I haven't ventured much further than my go to's but my companions have had (and loved) the Burger, Nicoise Salad, French Onion Soup, Tomato Soup, Risotto and Steak Frites. I should mention, the wait service here is on point - friendly, efficient and unobtrusive. They do a great job keeping the water glasses filled. A small but important detail.  And that's what I love about this place...they really get the details.",0,0,0,Jennifer B.,"New York, NY",102,43,1
5.0,2/5/2019,"I will just say one thing... The front desk might be a little disorganized and it can get busy and frustrating to get a seat (at least in my experience)... However once seated, do not hesitate to get the burger. Just do it. Table service, after being seated, was good. I will urge any person at this establishment to get the burger. Might be tied for my fav burger in NYC. Will be back and will update the review.",0,0,0,Varand O.,"New York, NY",9,133,0

5.0,2/2/2019,"I went here on a whim with some girlfriends when we were in the area and starving. One of my friends had been here multiple times and was raving about it. Admittedly, I don't frequent French restaurants, but I decided to give it a try.Lafayette did not disappoint! The service and atmosphere is exceptional, and the food is amazing. I got the black macaroni with lobster and spicy sauce, and it was excellent. I asked if they could make it non-spicy because I hate spice, and they couldn't, but I couldn't resist the black macaroni and lobster combo- two of my favorite things! For me, the dish was very spicy and I had to take sips of water in between every other bite, but it was definitely worth it.This is a great place for a girls night out dinner, date night, or bringing your parents/in-laws who are visiting. A local hotspot with a quiet yet lively atmosphere that's perfect for anyone looking for a fabulous time.",0,0,0,Elizabeth F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,9,20

5.0,1/21/2019,"I came to Lafayette with my family for brunch when they were in town visiting. We had a reservation for 4 on a Saturday and were quickly seated upon arrival. Our server was friendly and informative, the decor was sleek and the ambiance warm. For some reason, I was expecting small portions but in reality they were ample-sized - a lot for even a hungry brunch-ers like ourselves! We sampled from each other's plates as there was more than enough to go around, so everyone got a little bit of sweet and savory. We ordered:Lemon Pancakes with fresh berries (5/5) - I loved these pancakes. Simple execution but they hit the spot - a hint of lemon, not too sweet and the fresh berries and light sauce really brought everything together.Bananas Foster French Toast (4/5)- simply indulgent. Like eating dessert for breakfast. Topped with vanilla ice cream and rum caramel - wow.Egg White Frittata with sweet pepper basquaise (3.5/5) - the texture was more like the softness of an omelette as opposed to the typical firmness and even crispiness of a frittata. But with the sweet pepper basquaise, it was hearty and delicious  Almond Croissant (4/5) - crisp exterior, flaky interior, delicious buttery and almond taste.Overall, a great experience featuring tasty food and great service. It got the thumbs up from my fellow brunch-goers, and I'd definitely come back for another meal.",0,0,0,Bobby B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,17,18
5.0,1/20/2019,Lafayette was gorgeous! I made reservations weeks in advance to celebrate my 21st birthday and the waiter was quick to offer special-made cocktails to suit my (inexperienced) tastes. It's definitely on the more expensive side but the food is worth it. The sparkler on the birthday cake is what I really came for and it did not fail to astound! The dessert is also fantastic.,0,0,0,Kristen C.,"Queens, NY",428,5,1
3.0,1/19/2019,"We had a big family gathering for dinner last night and though the service was mostly fine, it was the menu and the food itself that ultimately made me just shrug my shoulders. I had been there once before and remember being more excited by the offerings. The menu seemed extremely limited and to be honest not that French. Nothing jumped out either as a classic or as an innovation. This time the highlight of my meal was the escargot and someone else's duck. The pasta (a whole pasta section for a French bistro?) dish I ordered - angioletti filled with mushrooms in a Parmesan sauce with shaved black truffle - only tasted like oily cheese. Somehow there was no black truffle flavor which made me wonder what the black shavings were if not truffle. I'm serious, there was no mushroom or truffle flavor whatsoever. My neighbor's oxtail ravioli looked like Chinese dumplings, the skin was that thin, and tasted like mystery meat mush. Dog food came to mind. My other neighbors steak was under-seasoned. Desserts were also a mashup. A peanut butter snicker bar trifle thing, was something from an American upscale diner. The last lemon tart went to the other end of the table; a bite did reach me though. It was a rock hard crust and decent lemon filling. With no creme brûlée on the menu I ordered 2 scoops of their pretzel ice cream, which in fact was yummy, like salted caramel in profile but it was served as 2 individual scoops in metal containers and felt very unloved in its presentation. All in all a very expensive unmemorable meal. I will not be back anytime soon.",0,0,0,Joal P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0
2.0,1/16/2019,The hostess gave my table away and made me wait at the end of the line after being rude and speaking to me in a distasteful way. The truffle scramble was tasty but the bed of salad it comes on is tasteless and not good.,0,0,0,Glory L.,"Manhattan, NY",469,10,0

1.0,1/10/2019,"Our family was in town for the holidays and as is the tradition in our family, we would book a table in a nice restaurant for December 31 to ring in the new year.  I was the one who suggested that we go to Lafayette as I have been there when it first opened a while back.  I chose it because not only was the food great (I am a big fan of Andrew Carmellini) but also because the service was impeccable.  At least that was what I remembered"".The food was great, as expected and everyone in our party enjoyed that.  The nightmare of our service started when we got to the restaurant.  The lady at the front desk was absolutely not friendly at all.  When the first half of the party arrived, she just told us that the table was not ready and we need to wait.  She was cold and did not offer for us to get a drink at the bar.  We were early for our reservation and we thought we would start drinking.  No updates, no nothing and would only let us know if we followed up.  In the meantime, we were just standing there right in front of her.  When the second half of the party arrived, they were not greeted, despite standing right in front of her.  My sister actually saw that she was ""facetiming"" with someone on her phone which was hidden from the view of the guests but could be seen if you stood beside her.  After a few minutes, they went up to her to ask for the table and she just looked at them and gave another look to another lady who took them to the our table.Our waiter - he was pleasant and engaging when he is in front of us.  Otherwise, he would not check up on us on a regular basis - but he would on the table beside us (they must be friends since he gave one of them a big hug).  It was very difficult to ask for a water refill.  I was waving my both hands in air frantically to get someone's attention.  Nothing.  The frustrating is, I actually got of the servers attention (including the lady in the front desk) as they looked at me in the eye but they turned away.  Kevin, the sommelier, finally came to ask what we needed and he served us water.  Kevin was very nice and attentive.When the food was delivered, there was no explanation whatsoever on what it was!  Very disappointing.When we asked for the bill, we were overcharged by about $300 for additional drinks.  These drinks were entered in 4 different entries.  Our waiter went back to rectify the bill and came back to say it was a small error.  When I said it was not a small error, he again said it was a small mistake and was mentioning something about the buttons in the computer, blah blah blah.  Of course I said that was not my problem and I asked to see the manager.  The restaurant manager came and like everyone else, was emotionless and not personable at all.  When we said what we said, he again said the waiters must have been confused with which key to press, etc blah blah blah.  Again, i said not my problem.  He was not apologetic or anything at all!!It was sooo obvious that everyone (with the exception of Kevin the somm and Amen the server) did not want to be there and was only there for the extra pay.  Even the restaurant manager!  The ladies who were giving away the party favours had zero holiday spirit.  They literally just stared at us while waiting for our choice of party favors.  There was no countdown to midnight!  Luckily there were balloons otherwise, we could have been in a regular dinner in a restaurant with bad service.  Of course I left no tip as the service was a big let down.  When we were asking for our coats, the coat girl (who was a Filipino since we heard her speaking Filipino on the phone) slammed the drawer of the front desk before going to get our coats.  Obviously, she must have known by now that we did not leave a tip.As I have said, going out for December 31 dinner is a family tradition.  We have been doing this for a very very long time all over the world, wherever we might be.  Our experience at Lafayette was definitely the worse.  There are so many restaurant options in NYC and it is so easy to get great food - that alone does not cut it.  Personally, I would rather have ok food with great service than the other way around.Lastly, we noticed that we were the only Asian table that evening.  Is the related to the kind of service we got?  Wow.",0,0,0,Jeanne G.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",0,2,0
2.0,1/7/2019,"We had reservations and were very excited to dine at the Lafayette. It was also my best friend Michael's birthday dinner. I think I should of done some more research when I booked it though. We started off with a selection of 7 cheeses. They were ok. Nothing major nor minor about them. I ordered the:Dry Aged Duck, butternut squash, huckleberry, foie gras jus. It was decent. Honestly the best part of it was the foie gras jus and the huckleberry. Michael ordered the:Dry-Aged Strip Steak Frites, béarnaise butter. He tried to eat it but he said the meat tasted like it was going bad. We sent it back and I gave half of my dish to Michael. At this point we were just pretty much over it. But I did see on the website that they had a dessert with fennel ice cream. Enter: LA POIREwalnut feuilletine, pear mousse, fennel pollen ice creamI ordered one and as we waited for it to come out, the waitress comes out with a large birthday cake (it's not an actual cake) with a sparkler. When the dessert touched the table I wish we had gone there only for dessert because it was outstanding. The fennel ice cream was very imaginative.

2.0,10/6/2018,"I'm extremely disappointed in what happened tonight. I had made reservations for my best friend's Bday here since she'd be in town for it and mentioned in the reservation that it was her bday. It became clear that a lot of people go there for bdays since they'd bring out this sparkler cake and clap for the table. When it came time for dessert, that didn't happen for us. I flagged down someone that I think was the manager- Jose- and tell him what happened. He apologized and ended up comping our desserts and even gave us macarons before we left. His hospitality turned the night around. Until I got home and realized they had billed me for dinner TWICE!!!!!! So I was now overdrawn on my bank account!! Are you kidding me??? I immediately call the restaurant and they gave the phone to Jose who tried to blame my bank and I had to ask for an email I could send my bank statement to for proof. I had to ask 3 times before he told me it. I'm probably not coming back. Even after fixing one problem the literal worst problem happened and now that I'm no longer inside the restaurant they don't seem to care. 2 stars since they at least made my BFF's bday pretty nice.",0,0,0,Marina F.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,10,5
1.0,9/30/2018,"Tried their brunch. Disappointed as I had high hopes as prior dinners were memorable. There's so much potential, but sadly the execution was lacking today at our birthday brunch for 8. Like a previous reviewer, I specifically requested a baby high chair when the booking was made, to accommodate one of my guests. I also called the morning of to make sure this was noted. Was it ready when my party arrived? No. Our waiter scrambled to get one while my entire party of 9 awkwardly stood there and waited for it to be placed in the right spot. We had a corner spot... the 3 tables were pushed very close to seats with backs on the wall, so I had to pull out 3 heavy tables...otherwise my guests would not have enough space to get their seats. I did it myself since no one on staff seemed to be paying attention. How was the food? I can't believe the bland and flavorless croque madame and egg Benedicts came out of the same kitchen as the delicious dinners I've had here before. If you want good brunch food, skip this place. The overall experience was also hampered by the lack of water refills (I had to ask the busboy twice).

4.0,9/28/2018,"Great food, odd service.Came in for brunch with a reservation. I made the reservation for 5 and put in my notes that it would be 4 adults and 1 high chair. When I arrived for my reservation, I was a bit early and reminded them that it would be 4 adults and 1 high chair. I was told it would be no problem, and they would go set the table up for us with the high chair and they would let us know when the table was ready. When the rest of the party arrived, we let the staff know, they told us to wait while they finished setting our table. No problem. However, when we arrived at the table, there was no high chair. Ok. We let them know we'd need one and they brought it to us very quickly. Not a big deal, just strange.We were immediately presented with menus. We ordered a round of coffee, and when it arrived there was no creamer or sweeteners on the table. We had to ask twice for them to be brought to the table. When it came time to order, we let our waiter know that we'd like to start with the basket of pastries, then we'd all be sharing the frisee salad, and then our entrees.The pastries arrived very quickly and were quite good, but only a few minutes later all of our entrees and our salad were delivered to the table. Most of us had not finished our pastry yet. It's not to say that the food wasn't good. We loved the frisee salad. It was heaven. I was a fan of the salmon eggs benedict and everyone else was super into their croque monsieurs. The waiter offered to show us the dessert menus, we were happy to take a look, but then twenty minutes passed and we still didn't have the menus, we asked again, and then another time and finally we received the menus.Hopefully it was just an off day, but certainly a bizarre experience of feeling rushed through the meal and then completely forgotten about when we were ready to pay.",2,0,1,Katie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",144,220,20

We all really liked the red wine we ordered (can't remember the name).We ordered a cheese platter and let the waitress choose a hard, soft, and bleu cheese for us. It came with bread and apples. I liked all the selections but especially the bleu. I do not like bleu cheese in general and was pleasantly surprised to like this bleu cheese so much!I ordered the duck bolognese pasta, which I didn't like. The duck didn't taste like duck...I felt like I was just eating meat sauce. My mom and aunt also ordered salads and thought there was way too much dressing on them. However, they did enjoy their bistro steaks.

3.0,5/26/2018,"Ever since I decided to try different places just for brunch. I thought it would be nice to give this place a try. I was never a big fan of brunch because honestly I could make a mean pair of eggs in any style along with some other fatty protein at home and maybe a good Benedict, but why the heck not because there's so many good eats in NYC right? Despite the menu looking a little pricey for brunch, the pictures of the food made it look like the food was definitely worth it for the price. I was also told previously that this place was a good brunch spot too. So I decided to give it a try.When I first arrived, I was waiting on my friends, and they will not seat you until your party arrives all together despite making reservations ahead of time. So just be warned, if you're ever going to try to spot, make sure everyone is there!Despite that, the service was great. The hostess was very attentive and friendly. She ensured that we would be seated quickly now that our party arrived, and also took our jackets. It was nice! Good job on that!After being seated the waiters and waitresses were really pleasant, and friendly. They were really knowledgeable with the menu and really gave their honest opinions when you asked for suggestions. For a really cool spot, the service was on point and you will not be let down.Now let's move on to the food and I cannot tell you how disappointed I am. For the price, the food should not be tasting the way it did, because if I could literally make this brunch food taste better at home, I should not be paying that much for brunch. I had the Smoked Salmon Benedict, and it was really bland, and I dunno how the smoked salmon was totally cooked! It was dry and not appealing at all. It seemed like they just randomly threw that dish together without giving careful thought to how it would taste. Sure the presentation was really pretty and amazing, but the taste did not live up to its looks.I was really disappointed. The other dishes that my friends had were mediocre at best. I felt bad for putting together brunch that was pricey and not good at all. The only saving grace to Lafayette is the staff. They're simply amazing and really made up for the poor pricey taste of the food with their positive vibe and attentiveness. Kudos to therm for sure!!For a place in the heart of NoHo, you would assume that the food would be really good. I would come back just for the service!

4.0,3/11/2018,"4 stars for food, 3 stars for the price point.The Moroccan spice glazed duck was delectable! It was one of the tastiest duck entrees I've had eating out and I was only sad that it came with two pieces, each resembling the size of a chicken tender. (Don't be fooled, the third ""chicken tender"" is a panisse.) With a quick swipe of the date sauce on the side, it was a perfect balance of rich and sweet. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger as well, saying it was juicy. We also shared the chocolate caramel coupe and was surprised it came out in a tall glass with layers of surprises. A combination of chocolate mousse, whipped cream, chocolate pearls and topped with coffee ice cream, somehow there was also chocolate cake in the middle. It was a pretty dessert but not as pretty to eat as we were struggling to use our spoons to dig to the bottom. The only thing I didn't care for was the brussel sprouts (a side dish) because they were soggy and bland.The service was very attentive with the wait staff constantly within the premises of our table.

4.0,3/5/2018,"Pros: The food is very good. The Duck is very lovely and decently portioned for the price. I had the bistro steak, which is also very good but could just be a bit bigger. The mushroom sauce was great. Frittes were fried correctly for a French bistro. Decent wine list and pour. They serve Brandy Hot Totty, which is awesome. They very interestingly had a lot of Moroccan inspired food. The duck was moroccan spiced, and they also have a Tagine dish. Cons: Not much really. The space is a bit tight and the bathroom area is hard to access as they are very narrow individual stalls. The runner is very attentive, the server was nice but I think he was covering too many tables to be very attentive. I had to flag him down as he is passing by for everything.

That never arrived.  Finally, I was able to flag her down for the check.  She brought that amazingly quickly; of course, it included the drink we never received!  She said she would get the drink and seemed peeved when we said we finished our meal, it was too late to bring it.  She adjusted the bill, but didn't apologize for any of the delays.  I'll certainly think twice before going here for dinner again.  Clearly whomever is managing the front of the house needs to have the person making espressos, cappuccinos, etc. assigned only to that task and not to waiting on tables as well.  And the staff should be reminded to be aware of what is being brought to their tables when, and communicate if there are delays.",0,0,0,Margaret O.,"Princeton, NJ",0,6,0

4.0,2/4/2018,"After having low expectations due to the lukewarm reviews, I was very pleasantly surprised. Came here for restaurant week on a Friday night around 8pm (it was easy to make a res a couple weeks in advance and modify it last minute as well). The menu is simple, yes but is representative of what they do (classic French-a lot of the RW menu is on the actual menu) and also seems to be their normal portion size too. I've definitely had worse.Ambiance is really great like a typical gas light brasserie with plenty of tables. It's a pretty big restaurant. Also seems like they do fun birthday things too - they had a cake with a sparkler and the like. The kitchen isn't open but you can see the rotisserie spinning awesome chickens and bakery upfront. (The baked goods are sooo good). We started off with awesome house butter (very soft, whipped) and house soft, sourdough bread. Service is always prompt, polite, accommodating and not pushy. They kindly packed home some free bread and pomme frites (which I ordered a la carte -very good, shoe string style - you also get a lot for $11) per my request. They supplied me with plenty hot water, lemon, honey-ginger per my request.My husband did not have the restaurant week menu, and he got the rotisserie chicken a la carte which he felt was a tad salty but it was perfect for me. I don't find most rotisseries particularly flavorful but this one was delicious.  Juicy, well brined and lots of flavor. It had some traditional French preparation like Grand Mere sauce?  Also, the dish came with roast potatoes (which were probably delish roasted in fat) but my husband is low carb, so they kindly just doubled his portion of brussel sprouts which was the veg with the dish. I did have the RW menu (it's nice they don't all force people to do it) and the - delicious tomato soup with a touch of creme fraiche, and a raclette fritter. Like their play on mac and cheese. -yummy duck confit, very soft and tender leg with a bean stew (cassoulet) with pork sauage. I wish they gave more sausage but the beans were very heavy, flavorful and plentiful-For dessert, we had the profiterole - OMG so good. This might have been the best thing. A pastry enclosed around fresh vanilla ice cream. caramel apples (caramel sauce so good!)Def. worth coming back - I'd also come for brunch.  We chose not to have wine but they had a nice selection of the great French ones.",5,2,5,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25
4.0,2/1/2018,"Came here for dinner during Restaurant Week and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.To start off, the ambiance and service at the restaurant was amazing.  I  loved the French brasserie decor. As soon as you walked in, you were transported to Paris. I wasn't initially impressed w the Restaurant Week menu selections, but I settled on the salmon rillette which was ok.  To be fair, I'm not overly familiar w rillette so the dish could have been spectacular/authentic and I just happen to not be a fan.  My entree, however, was Skate a la Grenobloise, which I happen to be a fan of.  I tend to order the dish anytime I see it on a menu.  I was a bit sad to say that Lafayette's skate grenobloise wasn't up to my standards.  The skate was too breaded/fried.  I like my grenobloise fish to be lightly skillet/pan fried.  The sauce made up for the overly fried skate but I was kinda disappointed overall.My friend had the tomato soup which looked quite impressive in its presentation (the server pours the soup from a sauce pourer into the bowl right in front of you).  She had the risotto for the main and overall I think she liked both dishes.  She LOVED the dessert she ordered though, which was ice cream sandwiched in puff pastry (Profiterole Maison).My favorite part of the dining experience was the bread.  Their bread was the best I've had at a restaurant EVER.  I think it was a sourdough bread.  The crust was crust (for lack of better word) and had a bit of a charred/burnt taste (which I prefer).  The bread in the inside was moist and chewy.  The service was good-- our server was very attentive and other wait staff circled around us to ensure our bread basket was always full (yay) and our drinks were refilled.There was an issue with our bill at the end of the dinner.  They charged us separately for my friend's soup though we both partook in the restaurant week menu.  I missed the extra charge but luckily my friend caught it.  Our server was quick to correct the mistake, but just a warning to all patrons to make sure you check your bill at the end of the night or else you'll end up spending  more than you actually did!",0,0,0,gwen L.,"New York, NY",3,137,0

As New Yorkers, we have taken for granted that brunch spots and bistros should be small and dank, yet there isn't a single bad seat in Lafayette. The magic starts the second you walk in.Over your right side presents a bakery, which immediately draws comparison with Balthazar, which is reasonable because everybody does it. But Lafayette's dining area really pushes the boundary of plush and sleek French dining: it is casual but still has the class you'd expect from a proper French place.Order the French toast if you're here over brunch hours. It is unforgettable. It has got everything just right and comes at a reasonable portion that leaves you full without craving much else. Then split a salad with the companion you came with - have him or her order something salty. It's nice to shake it up a little bit and I doubt anyone can manage to eat everything.Later that day, I looked up the web and realized that this place was once again a work of wonder under Andrew Carmellini's supervision.

1.0,9/22/2017,"Let's start with what's good here. The ambiance is lovely and the restaurant appears clean. The waitstaff gave a friend  and me plenty of time to order, chat and eat; they didn't rush us in any way although the restaurant was busy. We both ordered the Niçoise salad for lunch. What we were served was a glop of food, so overdressed with an unknown dressing that the ingredients were stuck together. The peppers were freshly out of a jar, the string beans appeared to have been recently defrosted, the tuna fell apart with a touch of the fork. The salad was so salty I had to buy a bottle of water on my way home. My friend left most of her meal on her plate, and I left more than half. French food is about fresh ingredients with fresh sauces. There was nothing French about our meal. At $28 per salad, Lafayette should be ashamed of what was served",0,0,0,Sherryl B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0

We got lucky and only had a 5 minute wait. Outdoor seating is the way to go but sitting indoors is just as nice with a very French feel. Smoked salmon eggs benedict - always a solid option. Light and lightly sweet hollandaise over poached eggs served in a cast iron.Burger - good and juicy but a bit on the heavy side even though it may appear small. The accompanied fries were shoestring-like. Tasted good. Not super crispy but not under cooked. Fresh berries with pancakes - the fruits were very fresh and tasty which made the pancakes even better. Pancakes were light and fluffy.Didn't have enough room for dessert but they looked very French (duh) and looked great! I'll have to try next time.I'd recommend to a friend going on a date, outdoor seating with a few friends, or a girl's party (bday or some sort of celebration).There's also a side part to the restaurant that serves coffee and pastries for those who want a quick bite to experience the ambiance or you are fancy enough to just get your coffee here all the time.",1,0,0,Michael K.,"Brooklyn, NY",53,5,3

4.0,9/5/2017,"Tl;DR Lafayette has a great ambiance, incredible food, and awesome service - just don't expect to come here for an inexpensive meal.I always walk by Lafayette on my way to work and see people sipping espressos while reading the paper or lunching with other highbrow elites; this isn't what most of my friends would describe me as, and I usually would pass by here to find a less extravagant eatery. However, I recently had the chance to come here for lunch with a few coworkers, and jumped on the opportunity to visit my ""East Egg.""The ambiance here is very French cafe-esque, and I loved the interior decorations. It truly felt like people could come here for a nice lunch, an intimate dates, drinks with a friend or co-worker, or for a family brunch. Gold hues tinge the walls and the bars look like they are straight out of Versailles. Outside was just as nice, with large blue umbrellas canopying the streetside, and heavy marble tables to sit at. I did a balance check and the two outside tables I touched did not wobble, thank heavens.We were first served sourdough bread with perfect consistency butter - I had to stop myself from eating more than three slices, it was so delicious. The bread itself was also not too hard or soft. I ordered a Girasole Pasta with ratatouille, pine nuts and a lovely white sauce that glazed over the top. The dish was savory and had a nice crunch thanks to the pine nuts - I also was quite pleased with the portion size. So often at these upscale restaurants you find the prices to be gouging and the servings to be lilliputian. I finished my pasta and felt comfortably satiated.I also would like to point out that the service here was outstanding. Our waitress was incredibly kind and patient, and refilled our ice waters so frequently. The check also came out very quickly, which I appreciated.Lafayette is not a restaurant that I would recommend if you're looking for a quick lunch bite, or aren't interested in spending a lot on a good meal.

Sadly, I ate here last Thursday - we spent more than $800 on dinner - got massive salmonella poisoning a couple of hours later resulting in violent throwing up and other body purgation and had to sleep for 16 hours. I wasn't the only one. Pretty sure it was the oysters - I ate one that tasted like feces. My sister said ""you're going to be so sick"" - she had already spat a bad one out in her napkin. Terrifying. Ruined the night and weekend. Humiliating and horrifying. That's how projectile vomiting on the street across the road from the restaurant feels. And that's the truth. Choose carefully, tread warily. Or just avoid. Sad about this. We ate at the Dutch - another of the chef's restaurants - days before and it was great.

The pancakes were definitely the group favorite, but be careful with the syrup because they are already plenty sweet as is. They were the perfect portion to be shared between three people but I am afraid it would have been too sweet for one person alone. The french toast was also pretty good, but also really really sweet, especially with the whipped cream. The croque madame was meh, not horrible but nothing special. However, the fries it came with were amazing. Thin, crispy, and garlicky. I think they were my personal favorite of the meal, but my guests preferred the pancakes.

3.0,7/15/2017,"Would recommend if in the area and not afraid  to spend some cash for a elegantly  casual dining spot.French inspired fare. Very large french industrial design.Have been here twice both on late Saturday brunch time.  . even when full not to loud. Service until end of my meal was nicely attentive and friendly. They kept switching my waitstaff which was a bit annoying.I skipped sweet brunch and stuck to savory. No question standard Manhattan pricey- but food service location and decor justify some of that. Drinks inventive strong  and generous. I had 2 tequila based ones that were superb. One which was like a green juicer with tequila. Perfect summer fare!They have a well rounded  selection of beers and wines as well. Also pricey but at least you are getting quality for this price point.First time around I got their $24 burger which is a perfectly cooked juicy tender mess( in a very good way) of gruyere cheese, mushroom duxelles caramelized onions. It's the perfect size for me- not ridiculously overwhelming perfect bread to burger ratio . Served with too many(good for 2 normal people) though delicious thin cut fries.Second time around although craving burger I tried to expand. Ordered escargots for app. super fresh tasting escargots but drenched too heavily in a fairly thick green herb sauce which did not have enough garlic or salt for my taste. Good but for $19 was hoping for some to die for ones which these were not. Main I ordered Croque Madame. Must say as soon as it was delivered to my table I was a bit disappointed . Very little mornay sauce- a few tablespoon smeared  on top . could barely find any inside. And that's the main secret to a great Croque.the brioche looking bread used looked like it had been toasted separately and not with butter so it looked dry. I dug in hoping maybe the house made ham and egg yolk might help with deliciousness but they didn't. Sandwich was dry - basically a ham and cheese with an egg on top for $22. Cheese not even well melted.What was gross as I was digging inside to see if there was any mornay on the interior I noticed half of the ham was a sickly grey color. That's when I stopped eating and informed my waiter. He immediately removed plate to return to kitchen and came back shortly with some bizarre explanation from the kitchen that the ham turns grey when the brine hasn't fully penetrated it but it's safe to eat! But if I didn't feel ok I could just order something different.Umm isn't the brining of the ham what allows it to be preserved in addition to smoking so if no brine no preservation? I have eaten a lot of ham in my life and grey had never been a color I would see on ham unless it's grey green mold or freezer burned.So I ordered the burger and was happy again.Finished my meal with a fantastic pistachio sponge layered with raspberry rose infused layer.Must say this was one of the best desserts I have had in a restaurant  in years. I would love to know if you can order a full cake.Elegant refined light not overly sweet creative . Perfect balance of floral notes with the nuttiness of the pistachio.Also since I am not a crazy sweets eater -it was the perfect size especially after loading my belly with the burger and fries. They have a french bakery cafe in the restaurant and this was french portion size dessert which I appreciated. The only off putting thing to my dessert is I ordered an earl grey tea. The tea did not taste like earl grey at all just like a standard black and the teapot did not have a teabag or tealeaves. I have only seen tea served like this at your standard chinatown restaurant where they have a big vat of premade jasmine tea they are filling table pots with. Which would be really weird for this type of place to do.When I asked the waiter about why no tea bags or leaves he said they dump the leaves in the kitchen ? for $4 -they need a new method.Anyways I plan on coming here for dinner and trying their steak.",0,0,0,anabela D.,"Queens, NY",17,194,0
5.0,7/8/2017,"I'd like to start off with the absolutely beautiful layout and decor of this restaurant. In terms of ambiance, it gets a 10/10.Dropped in for brunch last week with my husband, as we were in the mood for a bit of an upscale experience. Everything we ordered was incredible. my cappuccino was perfectly prepared, followed by a a croissant with banana, coconut, and chocolate, which I think was one of the best things I had ever eaten. The gooey inside just melted as I took a bite, while the flaky outside was perfectly soft yet crunchy in the right places. I also ordered the soft scramble eggs with goat cheese, leeks, and truffle vinaigrette. I saw $22 for scrambled eggs so I was a little skeptical at first. However once the food arrived, I was yet again blown away. Also the dish sounds simple, but this definitely is not something that I could have recreated at home. There were so many flavors and textures combined between the soft eggs, the frisee salad, and truffle dipped pastry, that accompanied the meal and complimented each other so perfectly.

It was $17. Re-word the title of this dish please. Leave out 'gem' for starters. The Goat cheese ravioli w/ English peas, mint and bacon was very good, but not worth the $26 sticker.

I will say that the food lived up to the hype. Everything was delicious, from the bread to the ravioli. Unfortunately, we would have had even more of the food if the service had not been so horrendous. We were at the restaurant relatively early, and I could find no excuse for the service to be so poor since there were probably only six tables. While we ordered fairly promptly, everything went downhill from there. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a soda and glass of wine to come out. Then, our entrees arrived before our appetizers. One member of our party received his appetizer in lieu of his entree (which he never ended up receiving). Bread and butter arrived at the table about halfway through our meal. Having been in the service industry, I tend to give servers the benefit of the doubt, but too many things went wrong. When we expressed our confusion, we were told the manager would come over and he never did.We were given dessert to compensate for the issues, but I was still disappointed with how it had been handled.

The tart au sucre is the treat you will probably skip because you don't know what it is, but go out on a limb and give it a try.I'm vegetarian and, frankly, outside of breakfast they aren't great for vegetarians. The Gem lettuce salad with avocado is light, fresh, crunchy, and tangy. Eating that with the bread they put on the tables is enough for lunch or a light dinner.Outdoor seating in the summer gives you front row access to people watching in the Village. I once saw a man walk by with a cat on a leash. The cat was sitting directly on top of his head so I'm not sure why the leash was necessary. Probably not best for a romantic evening because fire trucks routinely blast their way past. (Could be good for a break-up dinner, though.)Cocktails and wine selection are excellent.

Its sad to say our food came first and we have to remind a bus boy that i ordered a coffee. We ordered the brunch burger- good!, omelette and lemon pancakes.  The lemon pancakes are light but were okay. The omelette was good and is a staple in classic french cooking. But i was hungry afterwards... it only came with a side of salad. I wished it came with a slice of bread.  Was tempted to order a bread basket but it was $18 and we felt that it would take forever to arrive because we didnt get our food until 30 mins until we placed our order with the waitress.  Towards the end of the meal i decided to order an almond croissant be because i was still hungry and it was great!!

This is a bread that would actually pair well with a good olive oil until you catch your mistake and realize the only accompaniment this bread truly needs is some butter and maybe a dab of honey. In fact, this bread would be wasted on sandwiches - it's that good just eaten alone. The only thing to top the walnut bread was the pain au noix served with the cheese platter afterwards, full of walnuts AND raisins. Trust me when I say that this bread with a sliver of brie and some fig jam is the stuff of dreams and should be consumed on a regular basis. Hm, other standouts: the roasted chicken with cherry tomatoes and bits of bacon scattered throughout (a classic dish simple enough to replicate at home but the chicken was so intensely juicy) and the flat iron steak. I thought the fries were maybe too heavy on the salt but otherwise perfect for anyone who ate nothing but overly crispy, shoestring fries growing up. And how can I forget about the desserts? I had a bite of the chocolate mousse cake and maybe five of the tiny little fruit tarts.I get the sense, however, that where Lafayette truly excels is its baked goods and maybe, on a lesser level, its cooking (at least compared to the high prices). I was treated to a great company meal so perhaps I'll adjust the rating once I come back for myself.",4,2,3,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1203,824,173
4.0,4/9/2017,"Steak steak steak steak steak steak steak. That's what I got and some oysters for an appetizer. There was a dry-aged steak on the menu which I didn't get but my meat kind of tasted like dry-aged. It wasn't as juicy as a regular steak but it did have a stronger taste to it.The oysters didn't taste super fresh. Maybe they were and I'm a bad judge, but I didn't have an incredible time with them. I also ended with a chocolate eclair which was just super average.One big thing the people with me wanted me to include in the review is that there was a knife that was left on our table and when they collected it put it back into a pile we thought were the clean utensils.

5.0,4/6/2017,"The notion of brunch is rather offensive, when you think about it. Go ahead. Think about it. I know. Disgusting. But that's the society we live in. Somehow, it became acceptable to combine two meals of the day into one. As if the world has sped up to a point where we cannot consume our food in separate sittings. The logical progression of this will eventually be one meal, where we all sit in silence in uniform jumpsuits, all at the same time, like some sort of Orwellian nightmare, eating out of steel bowls and being forced to defecate on command. These are the drastic implications of brunch, which were going through my head when I entered Lafayette in Manhattan. However, in an attempt to be polite to my host, I swallowed my pride to indulge in the satanic ritual known as brunch. I ordered two scrambled eggs with a side of bacon, even though I had most certainly missed the acceptable breakfast window. But all of my fears were quelled when I bit into my first piece of bread from the bakery. I thought to myself, maybe this meal isn't so bad. There was something comforting about the croissant, it was as if the pastry itself was extending its flaky arm to hold me, and in that moment, I realized, despite not ever being able to materialize this thought: I needed to be held. I entered Lafayette a skeptic, but I left a believer in brunch.",1,4,2,Graham L.,"New York, NY",85,8,1

During the daytime, you can sit at any of the high stools and tables right in front of the dessert display or even get a more comfortable table in one section of the dining area - just ask to sit there. I do think that the prices are on the expensive side for a cafe, but it's a pretty cafe/restaurant to sit in. PLUS, when you get coffee or tea, you can ask for refills.

3.0,3/17/2017,"I've passed by Lafayette, but I hadn't been inside until I stopped by for dinner recently. Although it looks somewhat unassuming from the outside, it's got a very cozy, somewhat retro vibe (with the old tiling on the floor) going on that lines up the Old World cuisine quite well. Getting seated took us a little longer than expected, given that we had a reservation and it wasn't that crowded, but once we got seated, the service was pretty good. The only point I would make is that for sharing dishes, the setup (putting everything in relatively heavy cast-iron pots) made it a bit hard to share across the entire table. The wine selection seemed solid, with the beers being an interesting mix (mostly European crafts overseas) and the cocktails being very drinkable (aside from being a fun pun, Tequila Mockingbird really lays on the acidic fruitness and masks the tequila quite well).Beverages aside, though, the food did not quite measure up to the same level that I was expecting. Some parts were very good, and in particular, the meats (the grilled quail and the dry-aged steak) were excellently done. Doing steak of any kind in bulk can get me worried at times, but it was cooked perfectly here - medium-rare, but with the middle cooked enough - and with a light crisp on the outside, the flavor was very powerful. The quail was very good as well - basically a slightly gamier version of chicken - and I really enjoyed the polenta that it came with. The rest of the food, though, was middling and pretty uninspired at best. The bread was heavy, way too chewy, and not warm when it was brought out, making it a less-than-exciting item to spread the very good cow's milk butter on. The avocado salad was promising, but the gem lettuce was very plain, and the cheese it was smothered in - very unremarkable. The roasted beets were solidly executed but nothing beyond that. The pasta with ratatouille was an interesting choice from a flavor profile, but the pasta ended up a bit on the soggy side, making it something of a mishmash to try and eat. Dessert was flourless chocolate cake - one of my favorites - but it was one of the driest cakes I've ever eaten, and the texture resembled that of a slightly stale brownie. Not that I mind those, but as a cake, it missed the mark a bit. The fresh whipped cream had a strange, slightly tart taste to it as well.Overall, I'd come back again, but I would possibly stick more with the meats and less with everything else. I liked the ambiance, loved the aroma (the place smells like it's roasting rosemary when you walk in), and the drinks are solid, but the food is inconsistent at best.",2,0,0,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

It's one of my favorite breakfast/brunch places in the city, and both the interior and ambiance are perfect for a girls night out/brunch time or even a date night. It's even fitting for a nice family dinner - it honestly has very few flaws that makes it not enjoyable. Everything is on the pricier end, but not to the point where you'll break your wallet, and if it's for the almond croissant, black macaroni, or pork chop roti, it's worth breaking your wallet at least once. I go for breakfast/brunch more than dinner because the omelet, sandwiches, eggs benedict, and pancakes are all fabulous.

I started with the escargot, then ordered the vegetarian pasta (with ratatouille and ricotta cheese) and we also ordered a side of Moroccan carrots and broccolini side dishes.I barely touched the pasta or the sides, I ended up taking most of it to go so I suspect it was the escargot that almost killed me.

I had to be put on fluids and anti-nausea medication the day after so I don't end up severely dehydrated.

Most items were quite typical of what you'd find at brunch - meat platter, salad, smoked salmon Benedict, French toast with pineapple and two deserts (Rasberry cheesecake and chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream). Nothing stood out to me and nothing was memorable. I was underwhelmed and the atmosphere of the restaurant was just too much for my liking.

I had a morning wedding because the prices were so reasonable and for roughly 93 guests, it was a steal! The service was extremely attentive!

The inside was nice and bright, thanks to the large window that goes all the way up to the ceiling on the wall facing the entrance. Lafayette is consist of bakery and Café, which is more like a restaurant. If you are taking some bread or dessert home instead of eating in, or if you just wanted some sweets and coffee, then you don't need to go into their Café. The front right section is the bakery, and the rest of the space is the Café. We were only there for the dessert, so we sat at the bakery section.The bakery was filled with all sorts of yummy delight and its smell. We were surrounded with the perfumes of sugar, flour, cream, and every fluffy sweet goodness.  We decided on few things to eat right there, and few other things to take home with. For eating in, we chose Petit Choux, Cascara Slice, and Cappuccino. We got the little shiny treats that looked like jewels. Little jewels that taste amazing.... Our Lafayette experience made us say we wish if we could go there every day. We will get a different dessert, croissant, baguette, whatever they have, and every day we will be happy... But we do have to consult with our tummy, and make sure we can continue to fit into our clothes. So, I guess we can't visit them every day, only in my dreams.

We are not champagne snobs by any means, but noticed an odd flavor and lack of effervescence.  Told the bartender and when he showed us the bottle we were a bit disappointed.

Reminds me of old-timey france. Anyway! To the food...My 2 friends ordered off the restaurant week menu and I ordered off the normal menu (because I'm a rebel). The Grand Fromage: if you get this, I highly recommend the cremont!! It came with awesome bread that had dried fruit and nuts in it. The bread came warm and when we ran out the waitress didn't hesitate to offer us more, super nice of them. Black macaroni. You'll be happy to know all their pastas are made in house. The seafood was perfectly cooked; the cuttlefish wasn't chewy (a downfall of other places) and the rock shrimp was very flavorful. I would say this dish was a little too spicy--to the point where the spiciness was almost overwhelming.Strawberry Coconut Vacherin: I would say the true star of the night was the dessert though for sure. This dish was a coconut meringue with micro cilantro flakes inside (if you are not a fan of cilantro don't be afraid...I'm not a fan of cilantro but you only get a hint of it here and the taste meshes very well). Then the meringue is topped with coconut sorbet and then that is topped with a strawberry ""foam."" All i can say is get it!! It was really refreshing and a great way to end the night.Quick takes aka stealing bites of what your friends got.Sweet corn risotto: Yummm...I'm always a fan of risotto.

The manager came by and gave us complimentary olives... Umm... They were salty as Coney Island ocean water!  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Minus 3 stars:The food was an epic fail... Here's why: -Shrimp Cocktail to start (it was way too fishy!) - SKIP!-Sweet corn risotto... came out lukewarm - SKIP!-Roasted Lamb sandwich, so like a fancy gyro? - no taste... Visiting friend hated the sandwich.  - SKIP!-Rotisserie Chicken Salad w/ grains & yogurt dressing... So this was my dish.  I get the salad should be cold.. But shouldn't  my chicken be hot? And the skin be crispy?  Should I be worry since the chicken was sort of cold in certain area?!?!  I was beyond disappointed with my dish... (Looks pretty.. But a total failure from such a highly praised eatery).  - EPIC SKIP! -the food were plated nicely, but lacked flavor, creativeness and originality.   We couldn't wait to get our check, bypassing dessert at a French restaurant! The decor reminds me of a hand-me down aka ""wannabe"" Balthazar... Sadly it is not.  The bathroom needs cleaning, please put some flowers in - goes a long way.   Overall an Epic Fail...

Despite such careful arrangement, however, the column capitals are hidden in strange wooden enclosures, that look permanent (not temp construction). Seems like a strange complaint, but they were a note-worthy distraction from the otherwise beautiful restaurant. As the previous reviews state, there's a decent boulangerie. Better than average, but I'm not sure I would go out of my way to come here for baked goods.The hostesses (they need three?) were chilly, but our waitress was a pleasure. We spent more time with her, so the reception girls can keep their attitudes.My friend had the rotisserie chicken, which was passable, but not remarkable. I had the lamb chops, which were done in a Moroccan style, and then murdered by salt. I like salt - this was too much. A big fail for a restaurant at this level.We finished with ... a cherry dessert the name of which I forget, but the dessert itself was memorable. Probably the best thing we ate, save the bread.

The Summertime Coupe, who's description promised moist pistachio cake and creme to top, was simply an overly sour ice cream with stale crumbs of cake stuck on top.

The La Riviera, radishes with peppers was also tasty, but came without bread, we had to cadge some from the servers.For a main course I went with a smoked salmon benedict which was not the greatest choice, as it was too much like a diner version, except smaller. My daughter's brisket burger was a better idea, and the generous helping of pommes allumettes helped fill me up. The winning entree was a special omelet with cauliflower and onion, of good size, well made.Our dessert, a chocolate confection whose name I have forgotten, was excellent.Like so many downtown places, a bit more generosity with portion size and bread would enhance the experience.",0,0,0,Saul G.,"White Plains, NY",37,753,84

That is not accommodating service. In terms of the food we ordered the avocado lettuce salad which was good and had some glasses of champagne to celebrate. For our main we had the trout and the halibut and my parents ordered salads with chicken and they just gave them a chicken breast on the side. My trout was excellent - the halibut was alright and my parents looked unexcited by their meals. They of course gave my sisters pasta no attention - it looked like a 3rd grader tossed it together. The highlights were the fresh bread and the side of brocollini.I wouldn't go back for that though.

Service was a touch slow when we were first seated but it picked up once we got our starters, and our server was very sweet. It didn't take us long to figure out what we wanted after we saw the menus. For starters, we ordered the Green Asparagus Polonaise with trout roe and fine herbs and Beet Cured Salmon with horseradish and apple. The cheese, herbs, and trout roe added a nice, subtle range of flavors to the asparagus. The horseradish was a bit too overpowering for the salmon though.For my main, I ordered the Grilled Local Trout with morels, ramps, and fava beans, and regret, I did not. It was wonderfully smoky, perfectly tender, and full of flavor. The morels, ramps, and beans added a nice contrast in texture to the trout. So incredible! I highly recommend this dish. I also had a bite of my boyfriend's duck, which was perfectly cooked. We both shared a side of charred broccolini because we wanted some more greens and broccolini is delish. It was a simple side, and they didn't mess it up. Unsurprisingly, we didn't have a lot of a room for dessert with all our dishes AND the bread refills my boyfriend kept saying ""yes"" to.I'm glad I didn't let the 3-star and lower ratings sway me.

We spent our Sunday afternoon at Lafayette (between Great Jones & 4th st.) in NoHo and had a delightful meal sitting outside in the warm, breezy weather.Just looking at the colors of this masterpiece (Smoked Salmon Benedict On Brioche With Sauce Choron $21) got me salivating and wanting to demolish it! My first bite was actually the brioche! It was nicely toasted with a generous amount of butter making the texture light and fluffy with a crisp on the outside. The combination of the timely-poached eggs, freshly-cut salmon, and lightly-simmered spinach were well-proportioned in amount as well as in taste.French Toast 'Tropique', Grilled Pineapple ($18): Here's HEAVEN in my mouth! The thick, fluffy slice of toast was topped with a sweet, grilled pineapple, house-made whipped cream, and toasted coconut flakes, and lastly, it was drizzled with warm, maple syrup to our liking. The mixture of different textures and flavors felt like a party in my mouth. I had absolutely NO CONTROL over my knife and fork until the toast disappeared...but my friend was swift enough to get a small stab out of it!Usually, we like to stick with our favorite mimomas and bellinis for brunch, but we were in a mood for something NEW.

4.0,4/25/2016,"Lafayette was not what I expected, and I mean that in the best way possible. The restaurant was chosen from a short list given to me by a friend, mostly because it was an easy distance from our final destination.  A quick look at the menu had me primed for something pedestrian. French, with perhaps a few favorite North African-influenced dishes thrown in. What I got was a meal that built off classic techniques in genuinely interesting ways. My appetizer, the Beet Cured Salmon, was easily the best plate of the evening. I love beets and was anticipating that ingredient would be the star of the dish and contribute most of the flavor. But to my surprise, the salmon itself had been delicately infused with beet. It took on a truly unique taste that reminded me of beef carpaccio-- hearty and meaty, but with the texture of good fish. My friend had a more sedate but still delicious bowl of soup, amazingly savory.Our entrees weren't quite as exciting, but they were no disappointment either. The spices sang in my Lamb Tagine and the lentils that accompanied the Grilled Trout, and both proteins were well cooked. Overall these dishes had a good mix of tried and true cooking techniques, executed with precision, and deep attention to flavor. Desserts were merely satisfactory ... but to be fair, they were also satisfying.

I had been here before on my birthday and wanted to go back. We had a late lunch reservation and I wish I had not ended up going here because of the severely rude attitude displayed by the hostesses who were manning the check in.We had to wait over 40 mins for a table, there was no apology and despite following up a few times they did not seem to be bothered that we were just waiting on them to give us a table for a reservation that was already confirmed for 40 mins before. Then when they finally seated  us they gave us a big large booth, me and my friends were quite happy with the seating since it was spacious however, 1 minute later the hostess comes up and says they mistakenly gave us the wrong table and this was for a ""much bigger party"" and they moved us to another table without apologizing. The hostess did tell the manager we were upset and they gave us a complimentary pastry basket. But that this point a $17 freebie is not going to compensate for the rude service making us feel inferior to the other guests who were dining here. I'm not sure if this place discriminates against looks but it definitely seems that way, people that were placed at the larger booth at the front of the restaurant were only a party of 4 and they could have had a smaller table like we were seated at. I felt embarrassed that I had suggested to my friends that we go here for brunch since it was my idea, we all left feeling very disappointed with the whole experience.

We both got eggs - he got an omelette and I got a frittata and we both thought our dishes were bland and certainly not meeting the expectations of the price tag. The atmosphere and decor of this place is enough to get me wanting to come back again, especially the tiling and mirrors on the walls with the soft lighting. It's a beautiful space.

4.0,2/10/2016,"A stroll down to Lafayette, off of West 4th street, is definitely MUCH quicker than hopping a flight to Paris - and also slightly cheaper.The first thing I noticed upon walking into Lafayette is the SPACE.  It's a big restaurant!  That's not something that you normally see in the Village.  A cafe-like space at the entrance holds diners awaiting their table, and serves pastries & coffee.  We were seated at the front, on a comfy booth next to another table.  We weren't so close that we could hear every word, which I appreciated (being PACKED in next to other tables, unable to have a private conversation, is my new biggest pet peeve in NYC dining.)The menu is undeniably French, but also accessible for those not as familiar with the cuisine.  We tried quite a few dishes - for starters, the raclette, beet-cured salmon, and charred broccolini.  The raclette is certainly the most unique, and the best bang for your buck.  Comes with pickled vegetables, which add some serious bite to the fatty raclette, and perfectly toasted, thin crostini.For entrees, we had the rotisserie chicken and the special pasta - which was the star of the show.  Rotisserie chicken, at $29, is well seasoned and served with thick potato wedges.  The special pasta was a rigatoni with duck bolgenese and parmesan - WOW.  I'm such a sucker for pasta, but this one is truly craveable.  The duck is hard to identify - it blends so well, you'd think you're eating a traditional ragu.Then..the desserts.  Inventive and indulgent. We went a little overboard with profiteroles (my favorite,) a napoleon and some kind of semifreddo/cheesecake hybrid.  So much sweetness. So much puff pastry.  It's almost noon the next day, and I have yet to feel a pang of hunger (which, as you know, is completely unlike me.)It's not cheap, so it's nice for a special occasion or a date - but it really is something-for-everyone.  I can't think of an occasion it'd be tremendously inappropriate for, as the space allows for larger groups as well as intimate dates.",4,2,2,Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",452,361,4
3.0,1/30/2016,"I would give 3.5 stars if I could. My husband and I came here for Restaurant Week and maybe we made the wrong the choices, but the food was fairly average. The service was great and the restaurant was nice, but the food was kind of meh. Dessert was our favorite course! I had the mushroom soup to start, which was nice. It came in a tea cup, so I liked the presentation. Consistency was just right, not too thick, not too runny and there were mushrooms and croutons in the soup which I enjoyed. My hubby had the beet cured salmon, which he felt was a small portion. I was actually struggling to chose my appetizer and was going to go for the salad, which I wish I had when I saw diners on other tables with theirs, it looked huge! The pork croquette also looked good when I saw it going past! For my main course I had the Moroccan lamb with couscous. My first impression was that it was quite a small portion, it seemed like it took no time at all to eat. The dish just wasn't anything outstanding, the couscous didn't taste much different to plain couscous. The lamb was tender, there just wasn't much of it. My husband had a similar experience with his duck bolognese rigatoni and thought his was 'ok'. It was also a small portion. We both felt our desserts were the best course. We both had the dark chocolate mousse bar. It was well presented and delicious. I would definitely order that again! I saw they had something similar in their bakery near the entrance for $6. We enjoyed our meal but just wasn't blown away, but we have experienced some other excellent meals recently on Restaurant Week. I don't know whether they reduced their portions due to RW, but I would probably have been disappointed had I paid full price. I wouldn't have any objections to returning if for example, friends invited me to go, but I'm wondering whether brunch would be a better option. Sometimes places do one thing better than another.

We started off with the bread basket which was 100% worth it's price tag, it contained delicious pastries and breads with butter and jam on the side. The espresso drinks were also very well done. The meal is where I started to loose some of excitement. My frittata was overcooked and bland. Nothing to write home about. My friend got the scrambled eggs in puff pastry and it was good but small.Overall I would probably give Lafayette a 3.5. The food is fine but ultimately it boils down to why am I paying 17-19 dollars for eggs and a small side salad the rationalist in me can't understand it.",1,0,0,Kellie O.,"Manhattan, NY",173,105,37

I don't see myself coming back, there are so many smaller cute French cafe in NYC that are half the price ! Though it is a favorite place of my bf friend's gf, I don't know if it all it's cracked up to be. I've been to Paris and ate a lot while there.

Then each of us had an entreeFrench toast (smallish two slices of delicious bread, with not much else) right amount of food, just looked a like small.

I couldn't finish my fires :( they were so good, just so much.

Service: My friend and I walked over to Layfette for dinner per her boss's recommendation. We did not have a reservation and were still seated immediately (probably due to the fact it was near empty). We were met with some sass from the hostesses (witnesses just hanging out? Still unclear) as the host stand was not obvious and we were confused as to wear to go. Much to our delight, we were seated and our waitress was a delight. Drink: We ordered a great bottle of rose per the waitress' recommendation - Gothic 'Telltale' Rosè of Pinot Noir  Willamette Valley 2013. Crisp, dry rose. Food: Shortly after we were seated, we were brought a fresh (re: still warm) bread basket and salted butter. We each had a piece and had to sit on our hands in order to refrain from finishing the basket. As a starter, we ordered 6 east coast oysters which were large and tasty.

It's French bistro style, and not cheap- most brunch entrees are $18+. The portions aren't huge either. Service was fine, but slightly disorganized. The details, however, are what make the meal and it was definitely a delight to fill our faces (ladylike, of course) with the buttery goodness that this place offers.Highly recommend the salmon benedict, the omlette with corn puree and lemon raspberry pancakes. The salmon benedict had a wonderful toasted brioche that nearly made the meal on its own. The omlette was impossibly fluffy and filled with a ridiculously savory mash of corn.

3.0,10/22/2015,"Reviewing as a dinner restaurant with a note to self to return for brunch.Lafayette gets five stars for the French country rustic decor and vibe it seemlessly executes.  Tile floors and backsplashes, wainscoting, and warm gold/ brown/ white tones soften the metal hardware of the light fixtures, rails and handles peppered throughout the space.  The outdoor seating is ample and spacious, though the interior was something we were pleased to experience.Drinks and food are both excellent in portion  (almost surprisingly so since it's upscale French) and execution.  Cocktails run about $13-15, but quality spirits, a generous pour, and service with a single large cube made it seem fair.  I savored the Vermouth Amelie with a soft, mildly sweet taste of dark liquor and citrus.  The lamb tangine left me awestruck from service (presented in a covered Moroccan patterned dish) through each savory bite.  Pieces of lamb simmered slowly in eastern flavors with chunks of carrot and other veggies (seemed like a cousin of zucchini but I couldn't place it) left it soft as butter.  The couscous was flavorful, and  served with toasted, slivered almonds, and a midly salt and garlicked yogurt.My mom had the wood grilled trout.  While my dish was heartier and fit for a chilly day or to serve a hearty appetite, the trout was reminiscent of light Spring flavors.  It was the type of meal you'd truly enjoy eating, but then feel good inside and out for good clean nourishment.  Of course there was dessert to the tune of a salted caramel mille feiulle.  The pastry was impossibly thin and flaky, and the caramel was fantastically real - not some melted high fructose corn syrup junk melted just long enough to serve.  We shared it and loved every second of it.  The only culinary downside for the evening was the bitterness of the coffee.So much good but only 3 stars.  Service was obviously figuring out its operation while we were there.  Our first waiter dropped off menus, but was quite slow to return for drink or food orders.  We had to ask for bread once our meals were served (we had bread plates, so knew it existed), and also for our water glasses to be refilled.  Once they got the memo, they were more attentive.  Four different waiters helped at some point or other, but they didn't communicate with each other making us have to repeat requests for things a few times.  They were wonderfully friendly and patient, but at a restaurant of this caliber I expect service on point.Prices are around $15 for appetizers, $10 for sides, $22-25 for pastas $33-36 for meats & fish, and $15 for dessert.I'll certainly visit again!",9,5,6,Stephanie L.,"Rahway, NJ",367,261,1294

The eggs are perfectly cooked, i.e. soft and slightly runny in the case of the eggs benedict. Would pass on the sausage as it lacked flavor. In terms of juices, tried the green juice and it confirmed that I'm not really a green juice person, though it was refreshing. Would go with the Hyper C juice instead if you're not into green juice specifically, it's somewhat sweet and also has that nice acidic flavor you want in a juice at breakfast. The private room is really lovely in terms of atmosphere also. Wood panels and lighting make it feel classy as well as intimate.

I'm partial to a good bloody mary, but so many are bland and boring; the bloody ""Marie"" made with Old Bay and herbes de provence was anything but.  (It could be that I'm a sucker for anything with a lot of herbs and salt, but if that's wrong, I don't want to be right).  The coffee was excellent.  Everyone else enjoyed their dishes as well.Making a reservation for five on a Saturday morning was easy, and the place wasn't too crowded.  Service was super friendly and quick.  Decor is fancy brasserie-ish, and the place is very large and loud.  Only downside would be the prices:  not quite Balthazar-level but close, this will not be your normal cheap brunch spot (pre-tip for my eggs, coffee, and bloody was well north of $30).  But it's worth it, and I'll be back for those eggs, guaranteed.",0,0,0,David M.,"Jacksonville, FL",82,281,53

My issue wasn't with the food but with the lack thereof in terms of the portion size. Actually it wasn't everyone's portion. It was just mine.  A ridiculously small portion (like 6 bites) of short rib ravioli for like $24 and 3 bites of hangar steak for $28. It was 1980's French restaurant insulting. It annoyed me to no end and almost ruined my night. So we would never go back here.",0,0,0,Art C.,"Brooklyn, NY",179,1167,91

My husband and I took my parents here when they were in town and we all thought the service was horrific and the food was mediocre. It wasn't crowded when we got there for brunch, yet the hostess couldn't figure out where to seat us. It was like she was performing rocket science. We finally got seated and ordered, but it was obvious the waitress wasn't familiar with the menu. My husband and I ordered an egg white and mushroom frittata. It had maybe 3 mushrooms in it, but was LOADED with onions. It was disgusting and so bland. If they want to serve an onion frittata, label it as such. We all hated this place. I guess the atmosphere makes it trendy, but the food and service are atrocious.

1.0,9/22/2015,"Overcharged my credit card!I went here for lunch with a friend, and we both enjoyed it. However, my credit card sent me a message informing me that I had paid an over 30% tip for my bill, and asked for confirmation of the charge. I had not put this on my bill -- my friend and I split a 20% tip.  I called Lafayette three times to have this corrected. Each time, I talked to a very polite person (3 different people) who took all of my information and told me they would rectify the error (simply take off the extra tip overcharge) and let me know the same day.  No one ever got back to me. I finally disputed the charge with my credit card to have it removed. I didn't ask for a complete refund; I enjoyed the lunch. It is disturbing that there was not follow-up with my complaint; it makes it seem deliberate. It was a small amount of money that could slip under the radar. They basically stole extra money from me, probably thinking I wouldn't notice. The truth is, I probably wouldn't have if my great credit card service had not sent that notification.

I thought it would have a nice roasted lamb slices with a char, maybe.. Instead, it was a wet, undercooked mess of meat. I like my meat medium rare, but this was too fatty and not enough of a roasted flavor to the lamb. It didn't really even taste like lamb. My daughter had the croque monsieur which was well prepared and tasty. Her friend had the risotto - it looked well prepared and she enjoyed it.  The croissants weren't on the menu but I saw them on the way to the salle de bain and the pastries in the bakery section looked delicious.  The desserts we ordered were good but tiny. It was funny because the server put out large plates for our desserts and the choux were a tiny bite sized pastry. The ice cream float was ice cream in a tall glass of coffee that had more of a bitter flavor,  than a rich coffee flavor. But it's a nice French bistro with nice ambience and friendly service.

1.0,9/21/2015,"Poor experience, and I am not even being overly critical. We made reservations on opentable, get there in time, the hostess asks us politely to wait a bit, we are like, no issues, took them 25mins to find a table, fine whatever, it was a busy Sunday brunch time. Our server comes in and gets us water, asks us for drinks, we order a wine, a coffee, a belini, and a water, and request him to get a high chair. We also asked him to get us a bread basket while the food got to the table. It took them 25mins to get drinks, and that too just the wine, got 2 coffees, when we had asked for one, came after 25mins to tell us that they didn't have a belini or mimosa and brought the wrong drink out, we just said, get us a tea instead, which took them another 10mins. Still no high chair or the bread basket, and yes we requested again.Now food started showing up, which was a relief, and we were starving by then, good! At this point, we asked them to cancel the bread basket, didn't make sense! So after 15mins, a bread basket comes out, and we tell them we had cancelled it, the server with a lot of attitude says ""its complimentary"", and i was so ticked off, i still said - we don't want it. so overall, a mediocre meal with shitty service, and yes, the high chair never showed up! will i go to lafayette again, absolutely NEVER! i am shocked to see such a vast difference in service and management at sister restaurants, we absolutely love Locanda Verde and go there all the time. someone should take notice of it, and not take your diners for granted, after all this is New York, things come and go equally quickly!",0,0,0,Siddharth J.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,19,0

From the beginning, the service was very poor and the restaurant was not busy. We sat at the table for about 10 minutes before a waiter/waitress came to our table. For dinner i tried the Rock Shrimp Large Macaroni with Spicy Tomato Sauce - the pasta wasn't cooked al dente and mediocre in terms of flavor. We also ordered the brisket burger and asked for it to be cooked medium. It was extremely undercooked, and looked more like a medium rare burger. The only thing I would make sure to get again is the bread they bring to the table with little sprinkles of sea salt. Won't be back for dinner, but might give brunch a try.

5.0,8/26/2015,"My friends picked this place for my birthday dinner and I loved it. One of them had been here once for a dessert tasting event and raved about it. The place is spacious and beautiful, elegant enough for a date or nice meal, but understated enough to be casual and relaxing.The service was also wonderful. First of all, one of my friends was running pretty late but they had no problems seating us anyway. We ordered drinks (loved the French 75) and snacked on bread and olives while we waited. Also had a glass of champagne and it was delicious.For entrees, I went with the Spaghetti Nicoise, and it was delicious. Loved the rare tuna and lightly roasted vegetables that dressed the pasta, plus it was topped with crispy breadcrumbs. Would definitely order this again. Also shared an order of fries, and they were crispy and came with both ketchup and mayo.The main event however, was the desserts. Actually, my friend's idea was to order ALL of the desserts on the menu, but our server gently talked us down from that, as some of the desserts were pretty large (I think my friend thought they'd be in smaller portions like her tasting event). We settled on the following desserts:- Almond Chiffon Cake (fresh raspberries, lemon verbena chantilly) - Light with a nice mellow flavor, plus the lemon added some really nice tanginess- Fromage Blanc Cheesecake (fresh bing cherries, candied mint) - One of my favorites. The cheesecake had a creamy, slight saltiness to it that offset the sweetness of the cherries. Delish!- Profiterole Maison (strawberry ice cream, organic strawberries) - Strawberries and the ice cream were sweet with vibrant flavors, but the pastry seemed a little lost in the dessert.- Mille-Feuille Au Chocolat (chocolate puff pastry, malted milk chocolate crème legère) - The most impressive of the four and my other favorite. Delicious chocolately cream sandwiched between lovely flaky layers of pastry.Yes, ladies and gentleman, THIS is what we ordered AFTER being warned that we were over ordering. Scary to think this is our restrained version. But everything was amazing and well worth it. To top off the night, our server overheard my friends wishing me happy birthday, so when the desserts were served, they also put this giant sparkler candle put in front of me!

The hanger steak is not bad, they toasted the steak with different spice, its cooking level was perfect right, and mixed with vegetable and special sauce. So tasty.However, if their dessert could be better, I would give them 5 stars. Honestly, the chiffon cake was a totally disaster.

4.0,7/26/2015,"This is a fairly large restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating. The setting is very traditional with wood paneling. The service was quite good. 1. French toast: A single piece of brick toast topped with a slice of pineapple and cream. It was good, but still wasn't convinced that the pineapple slice worked well with the toast. My brother decided to soak the french toast in the entire vat of maple syrup they gave us, so I couldn't really comment on the true flavor of the toast. 2. Egg white frittata: I liked this dish a lot. There definitely was a lot of egg white used to make this frittata. Large slices of mushroom were also used, which made this dish multi-leveled. A light salad was sprinkled on top. I think this dish could have done with slightly more salt, but overall I like my dishes to be under than over-salted. 3. Pancake (lemon and berry): Pretty decent, although nothing truly unique about this dish. For what it was, it was pricy. 4.

As a business traveler, it's a refreshing site in the real estate strapped city. We had a large group (9) and they easily accommodated us. We all kicked off with a drinks. I had the Mint Julep which was inventively served in a silver cup, resembling a snow cone and garnished with a flowery bouquet of mint leaves. It was fun and potent...TIP: Let the ice melt. It was a good choice. Others had the Lemon Drop(?) and something with an egg white froth...ALL were good.So I didn't finish this review until just now and don't remember the food but honestly I think it was good.

3.0,7/16/2015,"I really enjoy NYC bistro places, and this one wins on location, decor, style, and friendliness and quality of service of the staff. I really don't want to say the food was not good - it was good. It wasn't excellent. And while it's the standard decent NYC 30 ish entree prices, I kind of expect a $38 steak to be better. Maybe because it was a strip and not a better cut. It didn't have the nice char of a very high heat preparation.The wine selection was quite nice, the duck rillette was solid, bread plate was a highlight with the bread very fresh and tender and the butter was room temperature with sea salt sprinkles. The squid appetizer was actually the big let down of the meal, it was rubbery, overcooked, and didn't have the crispy char.Perhaps I am being a drama queen, and I agree. This restaurant was a solid and nice evening for a date. The bakery and desserts are excellent. The staff rock and the decor is appropriate standard bistro style with a great location. I am really trying not to give it 3 stars and bump it up to 4, but actually, the factor pushing me back is that Balthazar charges the same prices, and unfortunately, makes better food.",0,0,0,m k.,"New York, NY",2,36,3

4.0,7/9/2015,"This is a review for the bakery only.BEST ALMOND CROISSANT EVER. It's dangerous that I work so close by since I can't stop thinking about it. Once a week treat is OK right? For $4, you get a huge flaky buttery (but not overly so) & nutty pastry. It's perfectly layered and filled with a generous amount of filling. It's lightly dusted with powdered sugar and slivered pieces of almond. I was never a huge croissant fan but this has converted me.The pain au chocolat is very good too. They use a dark chocolate for the filling and it's a bit thick. Again, the pastry is flaky and buttery and baked perfectly.

2.0,7/9/2015,"Go here for scene only, not food.I have and use Andrew Carmellini's cookbook. I love Locanda Verde, even had my wedding reception there. Lafayette is in a far lesser league, and feels like it should be over in the Meatpacking where no one cares about the chef or the food.Wife and I arrived on time for our reservation, and then waited for a full half an hour at the bar before someone came over to tell us they were working on setting our table. Comped a glass of champagne, which was nice, but it was an inauspicious start.Sommelier tried to pass off a different and lesser vintage of wine than what I ordered. Luckily my guard was up and I caught the 'mistake'. Steak in the steak frites was grey and rubbery, cooked at too low a temperature. No char at all. Frites were boring and under salted. How about some rosemary, or at least a proper amount of salt?Service was lackadaisical. Waitress waited until entrees were half done before stopping by to check if we needed anything.Duck breast was OK.

Perhaps I came here two years too late or the chef took the holiday off but this was the worst meal I've had so far this year. The Smoked salmon tartare was gross and the Frisee salad was swimming in an awful tasting mustard vinaigrette. I was thinking of trying the Duck au poive but went with a pasta dish at the last minute. The black macaroni didn't have any spicy tomato sauce and the macaroni was gummy and lacked flavor.

2.0,6/30/2015,"Yowza this place was a big letdown. The food was decent, albeit overpriced for the portions, but what RUINED the meal was the service. Our waiter had no idea what he was doing. He even took a bottle of wine of the table that had like a glass and a half left in it. It took him 15 minutes to even stop by when we were seated. He also interrupted TWO toasts at the table... just a tragic lack of attention to anything going on. The sommelier was a saving grace when it came to ordering the wine (can't remember her name but very nice redhead). Unfortunately, we could tell right away from how disjointed the service was that the meal was going to suffer. The goat cheese ravioli was awful, served lukewarm and tasted of Clorox lemon wipes (not kidding). The salmon tartare with horseradish and onion crisps (tiny portion), rotisserie chicken, and duck were all our favorites. I should also mention that we had 8pm reservations on a Friday night... and the place was half-empty.  Seems like this place may be going downhill and headed for the NYC-restaurant graveyard pretty soon.",0,1,0,Erin W.,"Brecksville, OH",4,119,23

I pass it every day on my way to school and finally stopped in eventually. It's a really nice space with an old French bistro type theme and decor. Love all the outdoor seating as well. I ordered a latte and a croissant. The coffee was good but not quite as hot as I would have liked. However, the croissant had to be one of the best I've ever had. (and I've had some good ones up in Quebec) This is how all croissants should be done- super crunchy and flaky outside with the soft buttery inside. These guys certainly are doing the French pastries justice. Really lovely place with good coffee and excellent pastries, so I recommend if that's what you're after.

1.0,6/21/2015,"We headed over to Lafayette for Saturday brunch after reading great reviews online. We were grossly disappointed. Here's why:1 - we show up without a reso, but are told we can be seated inside with no wait. we walk through the restaurant with the host and see many open tables. we get seated at the bar infront of the pizza oven, where nobody is working. it took over 10 minutes before a waiter showed, up, even longer to get water. 2 - even though the restaurant was busy, it was not full. the waiter did not check up with us at any point during the meal.3 - food was mediocre. pastries were run of the mill. nothing special here.4 - by the time we leave, the open tables we observed were still mostly open.I'm not sure why we got such crap service, but this place is coasting on good reviews likely by the B&T crowd.

I always sit by the window because the lighting is great, and I like the marble countertop. Definitely lack on the latte art aspect, but they serve Stumptown coffee and even have a Lafayette blend (for their dip coffee I think, since they sell also sell the Hair Bender blend - Stumptown's delicious expresso blend). The consistency and quality of your cup of coffee definitely vary, because it is never the same barista. I almost too often end up with a latte when I've ordered a cortado, but I am usually too much in need of caffeine to complain about it. The service is exceedingly cordial, so I'm sure you'd get a free macaron out of it if you did complain about it. Their pastries are very good. The macarons are cute and the boxes they come with are adorable too. I usually get the raspberry, chocolate and Lafayette (chocolate & earl grey) ones.

2.0,4/8/2015,"food was fine. lemon pancakes were yummy. burger was cooked just how we wanted it and the fries were perfect. the portions were also very large. the juice we ordered was bland. however, the service was shockingly awful. i am not a stickler for service. typically i just want the waiter to take our order, respond when we try to get their attention, and simply clean up the table. our waiter insisted that we move our coats to the coat room bc we were taking up one seat in the bar. i didn't prefer to do it but went along after the waiter insisted several times (despite the fact that the bar was far from fully occupied). okay whatever. throughout the meal, the waitress was very whatever.however when it was time to go, they had lost my scarf. the manager and the hostess were not even apologetic. in fact, they were snobby, rude, and poorly mannered. i dine out a lot and was shocked at the way we were interacted with. it was  a weekend long affair to get my scarf back. eventually one of the women who worked there above the manager was very helpful and gave us free desserts and a gift card. that was nice. but so not worth the hassle. there are so many great brunch places in the neighborhood. honestly, it was not even about the scarf bc it was not expensive. and it wasn't that they lost it because that happens in a busy weekend and a popular downtown restaurant. it was that the hostesses and manager were so incredibly rude in a way i have never encountered in an NYC dining establishment. it was shocking and despite liking the food, i would definitely not go back. next weekend, we brunched at the wren, which had better food and great service. it's a couple blocks away. i recommend it in place of lafayette if you're in the area",0,0,0,Sibora L.,"New York, NY",400,26,15
2.0,4/5/2015,"If I'm going to pay $17 for pancakes, can I at least get real maple syrup and not Aunt Jemima's (that's the sticky, sick one that causes diabetes)?  If I'm going to pay $21 for eggs benedict can I at least have more than 1 tsp of hollandaise (or whatever) sauce and eggs that are still warm?  And maybe the option of salt on the table?  On the upside, the cheese plate and the service were excellent, even if it did take ages for our dishes to actually reach the table.Definitely more of a scene than a place for people who take food even semi-seriously.  And even the ""scene"" was lacking, judging from the clumps of weirdly dressed (EVEN for NYC, ESP for a Sunday), same sex tables of 20 year old girls, 50 year old ladies, or people of indeterminate age due to the eye-brow raising application of injectables.  If I wanted to pretend I was in Chelsea, I would actually go to Chelsea.  Or at least the East Village.  I guess I would go back for drinks, preferably with a buzz on, if only to make the people more interesting and because I think this place comes more alive after 8 pm.  I mean, it must...unless it's surviving solely on the merits of its cheese plate.",0,0,0,Elle P.,"Santa Monica, CA",5,42,0

Ok, why didn't anyone explicitly tell me that it's better than your wildest dreams?? I posted a picture because I heard it's worth a thousand words. But you can't taste it. It was so fragrant, flaky and light. Usually after a few bites of a croissant I feel guilty and sheepish for even looking at one. But it didn't have that heavy buttery taste. The hint of almond cream filling is just delightful. I obediently ate half and packed the rest because I knew I would love myself for it later. The crazy thing is, I had a cold croissant. I could only imagine what it would be like if I had it fresh out of the oven. Something I would joyfully wait in line for hours for.

3.0,3/3/2015,"Restaurant Week '15.Took my mom out for a lunch date, and for me it's spot #4 for RW! The bakery grabs you as soon as you walk in and immediately I had to make the hardest decision of my day, lunch or sweets? Lunch it was. We got here at noon, the place was quiet, but the crowd quickly picked up towards the middle of our meal.Our date starts off with diesel legs of Grilled Octopus atop a bed of a delightful chickpea salad. We had trouble cutting the legs as we were only given butter knives, but it was tender enough so we managed. I was able to split the Rigatoni dish with my mom and my one year old since it was such a big portion. The juniper berries was a bit overpowering but the rich sauce blended in with the pieces of tender braised pork and cabbage. The Duck Confit on the other hand was dinky in size, only a leg of duck and nothing else other than a few pieces of beans and kumquat. The piece of duck is a bit dry for a confit, the beans were soft and the kumquat lightened up the dish with its distinctive sweetness. There were two picks for dessert, of course, we got one of each. The Winter Chocolate Gâtea was just a piece of chocolate cake, somewhat crumbly. There was a lot going on in the Ruby Red Parfait-- grapefruit, sticks of sesame meringue, and burnt honey, honestly I thought the flavors was too confusing.The overall experience wasn't all that bad, attentive servers, hostesses with warm smiles, too bad some of the food was off. RW is the time when you can go out and explore all these places, especially ones listed under $$$$, haha.

3.0,2/28/2015,"Considerably is a 3.5 star experience.Boyfriend and I had a day off on Friday and we decided to take advantage of restaurant week! I wanted French and most places were booked since we decided last minute. Lafayette was not packed when we arrived for lunch in the afternoon. It was spacious and looked very upscale. A quick scan of normal a la carte prices and we knew it would be a deal to go with RW. We had bread and butter which was delicious, fluffy and fresh, but nothing like the bread I had a week before in Paris. We also ordered fresh juices, I had the Hi-C(?) and bf had the one with beets, forgot the name. They were very fresh and good. BF started with the salmon tartare and I had the curry lentil soup. Both were a delicious start to the meal. Though we were a little creeped out by our waitress, who acted a little too overly happy to serve us with a fake smile and high pitched voice. I ordered the mushroom risotto and BF ordered the pork shoulder rigatoni. My risotto was about 5 minutes undercooked. It was flavorless and lukewarm. I was so underwhelmed and disappointed with this dish. I couldn't even finish it because I didn't think it was palatable. BF commented that the pork and cream and cabbage combo in his dish was very odd. The rigatoni was severely overcooked and not al dente. Maybe they shouldn't serve Italian dishes in a French restaurant. I love Italian and I love French. Both should not attempt to do the other. Dessert was okay. BF got the grapefruit parfait which was very interesting. Bitter and sweet notes were bright and refreshing. My winter chocolate gateau was nice and rich but a little too sweet. The meal was okay, not the best and not the worse. The best part might have been the bread, which is sad to say.

4.0,2/18/2015,"Despite a party of moi, I decided to try Lafayette for lunch to kick off my Restaurant Week adventure. It wasn't terribly busy when I got there, so I had a booth table that the sofa seems a bit too spacious for one person, but too tight for two people. As I got seated, the waiters promptly removed all but one set of silverware on the table as if to say ""quick! remove all the extra table settings so she doesn't feel bad dining alone because everyone else is a party of 2 or more!"" Off the RW 2015 menu, I decided to get the salmon croquette, mushroom risotto, and the chocolate gateau. As soon as I placed the order, the salmon croquette came in lightening speed as if they were telepathic. The croquette had a lot of salmon flavor and doesn't look like it was mixed with vegetables in it. The creme fraiche also provided a moisture to the fried croquette. Complimentary bread and butter also came with the appetizer, but sadly, the bread was cold. I don't care for the type of bread where the crust is so hard that it could chip a tooth. So it wasn't a big deal. From there, their telepathy ended. It took a much longer time to get my entree, but when it came piping hot in a big dinner portion, it looked like little morsel of rice screaming ""eat me!"" So I did. It had a lot of mushroom in it chèvre cheese cubes, and sprigs of rosemary and thyme. I wish they would leave out the sprigs of herbs because I had to fish them out and when I didn't it had a strong herb taste in one bite. As for the chèvre cheese, it tasted just like goat cheese. I like goat cheese, but I can do without it in this risotto.It also took a bit of time to get my dessert. When the chocolate gateau came, it was literally a slice of chocolate cake. it tasted fine, but not something I would order again. There was strange taste with the cake, but I can't describe what it is. It tasted like store bought cake that has preservatives. However, the chocolate ganache was really chocolately and smooth. So towards the end, I just ate around the cake. As for the dining experience, the waiter was extremely courteous. There was a lady who must had specific dietary restrictions because she only wanted beef dishes but somehow Lafayette wasn't serving any of it. Something about the chef needing to perfect the recipe? After she left, the waiter pulled who I think is the manager to the side to talk. And when I say the side, I meant right next to my table. Although I didn't hear the content of their conversation, but it was a little awkward for me as I sat there and trying not to listen. But all in all, I enjoyed Lafayette. They are a bit pricey so it won't be a regular lunch spot but it would be great occasionally for lunch and dinner.",2,0,1,Nilsa L.,"Brooklyn, NY",58,295,352

4.0,12/17/2014,"One of my favorite delis in the area. I've spent the past two summers working in the area, and am happy to report that now that I've been permanently hired by one of those two offices, I will be coming into Cafe Lafayette for lunch on a *regular* basis (well, after I take the July 2015 bar that is...). Woo! (plus yay permanent job as a lawyer!)FOOD: you've got several options to choose from: the sandwich bar, the grill, or the salad bar. The sandwich and salad bars seem to be the more popular options, so the way they set it up during the lunch rush is one line in the middle of the store for the salad bar and another line near the back for the sandwich bar. I stick with the various sandwiches and wraps, and I'd say my favorite is the chicken caesar on a spinach wrap. SO good. There are also other pre-packed items, and a couple fridges with soda, water, etc.PRICES: pretty comparable to other delis in the area. When I go for my chicken caesar wrap, it's $6-something. Sandwiches are about the same. Assuming you're just coming in for a sandwich or wrap, you'll get out in under $10.SERVICE: the guys behind the deli are fast and friendly, and the owners/cashiers are awesome too. I think with tax my wrap comes out to $7.02, but since I pay with cash, they just give me the $3 (or $13) back rather than forcing me to contend with $0.98 in change. After a while everyone starts to recognize you too.I miss you Cafe Lafayette. But never fear, I shall be back!",1,0,0,Shea D.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",109,547,88

2.0,12/6/2014,I have been here a couple of times for dinner and happy with the service and food. It's an easy go to with a great bar and one of the few restaurants which can accommodate large groups.However I was very disappointed in the brunch service. The staff there makes you feel like you are in a fast food joint the way they rush you along throughout the service. We were asked no fewer then four times if we were done with our half eaten meals. When we are finished it took all of 1 min for our plates to be whisked away. And we were not over extending our stay- in the end they successfully got us through our sat brunch in an hour.,0,0,0,Veronica B.,"Manhattan, NY",85,25,1

4.0,11/22/2014,"Came for an industry holiday party event in the basement. Service was phenomenal, my wine glass was ne'er empty, and the buffet spread was delicious. The beat salad was beautiful and tasty, though the cubes could have been better bite-sized. There were plates of sliders that were swarmed every time they were brought out because of their perfectly toasted buns, crisped onions, and juicy patties - I don't even like burgers but I had to have more than one. The frisee salad with radish and bacon was also light and refreshing and nicely dressed, while the octopus/chipea/olive platter was super aromatic and just enough of chewiness.  The passed hors d'hoevres were less interesting and precise, including a salmon shooter and some pigs in a blanket. Without knowing the pricing for this, I would happily book here for an event based on food and service alone.",1,0,0,Angel C.,"London, United Kingdom",263,630,2
4.0,11/19/2014,"Overall, a good experience at Lafayette. The latte was just the right temperature, with just enough milk to maintain the taste of the coffee. I ordered the Sandwich 'Cours Saleya,' which had charred tomato, tapenade, and a farm egg. The tapenade was very tasty, especially when the yolk broke and mixed in with it on the bread. The bread was way too toasted, though. I even had trouble cutting through it to cut the sandwich in half, hence the 4 stars. Also ordered the cheese plate. You have 3 choices to select, and I chose the 3 cows cheeses. It also comes with their delicious raisin bread and compote. My waitress was friendly and accommodating. I made my reservation through OpenTable, which also allowed me to pay through their app, which I loved.

Reminded me of Parc in Philadelphia, one of my favorite restaurants.-- Service was friendly and food came out quickly.The not-so-good:-- Prices here are ridiculous. $16 for a breadbasket that should be complimentary with brunch? Nuts. I think my eggs were around the same price which is also nuts. -- Brunch menu could use some variety...there isn't too much here for vegetarians or even fish eaters.-- Quiche and croissant were average.-- Scramble au pistau was good (although nothing I can't make at home - and I'm a terrible cook).The bottom line: Lafayette is a nice dining experience but the prices don't make me want to go running back.

4.0,11/11/2014,"A group of 11 us went here for celebratory dinner on a Friday night and I think everyone was happy with service and food. Even though they were extremely busy our waitstaff was attentive and took the time to answer questions about the menu and make recommendations. Getting to taste everyone in my group's choices I'd recommend the rotisserie pork chop (which I ordered and really enjoyed), the duck, and the sea bass which are all lovely, and very big portions. the tagine chicken was good too. I'd pass on pasta here; i love rabbit, but was unimpressed by that pasta dish. I also don't understand steak frites, but that's any where. I mean french fries? Hanger steak? no thanks, boring. The apps were good too- the duck rillette, endive salad, deviled eggs, octopus, and pâté were all verrry good. Dessert I personally would pass and go to one of the many bakeries in the area. Although when they wheeled out our desserts it was accompanied with an intense, pretty, firework like sparkler thing as we had let them know we were celebrating, and that did make it feel special as everyone turned to see what was happening at our table.This isn't Jean Georges so don't expect that, and perhaps it was a hair overpriced, but location, space, and ambience explain that and I love the fact they can comfortably take big parties. Some dishes are big hits others slight misses. I can't say that everything is a win here. But overall it was a tasty and solid dinner choice for a larger group.

I'm a big fan of The Dutch so was really looking forward to Lafayette. The decor dresses up the brasserie but tries a little too hard if you ask me (though maybe that feeling's enhanced by the B&T night/weekend crowd). Drinks are solid but the food has been consistently underwhelming. Avoid the frisee salad (overdressed) and trout (dry). Pastas were overcooked. The duck was fine.

The first time we had our reservation and we waited for a friend, it was the standard NYC thing where you can't sit until our entire party arrives. That time I had the pancakes and they were delightful. We went back yesterday and also had a reservation and sat right down. They had no issue with the fact that we were only 3 instead of 4. We started with 2 chocolate croissants and a blueberry muffin. The blueberry muffin was pretty lacking in blueberries but the croissants were good. For my main this time I had the smoked salmon Benedict and it was great. The poached eggs were on point and i believe they smoked the salmon in house. It was very fresh and even a bit healthy since it was served on a bed of spinach. However, it did come with 2 nice slices of brioche toast since we all want to splurge a little at brunch. My sister had the omelette with feta, corn, etc and she ate every bite. Our other friend had the pancakes and everyone was happy.

2.0,10/19/2014,"I have had a four star dinner here and a zero star brunch.My dinner my July 2014 was good. The service was good along with the food. My friend and I sat outside and it was lovely.Recently (October 2014), brunch was TERRIBLE. The menu (especially compared to the great dinner menu) was suuuuuuper basic and boring (scrambled eggs, cheeseburger, pancakes). And I have never seen so many staff walking around and doing nothing. We actually did not even have a waiter- no joke- and it took us about 20 min to find someone to help us. Because no one was serving us, the maitre d (one of like four useless employees meandering around the maitre d stand) came over to take our order when we complained. We informed him we were very hungry and wanted our food quickly if possible, and I would say it took about an hour for the the food to get there. When we checked on it wit him, he said some nonsense about waiting for us to finish our appetizers (one of us had a cheese plate which was finished like 30 min before that). He totally just forgot to put the food in/didn't care. He appeared to be more interested in gossiping with the multitude of hostesses/matire ds/space occupiers working there.I had the cheeseburger and it was pretty good as far as $20 burgers go. Difficult to get someone to bring me ketchup unfortunately. My friend had some kind of omelette with corn in it and it was honestly atrocious- the only way I can describe it is ""flavorless omelette with corn randomly in it"". The fresh yuzu/blood orange something or other fancy $9 juice tasted like tropicana. They never brought me the iced tea I ordered, nor did they bring enough/more toast for the cheese plate that was ordered despite reminders. They frankly just did not remotely care.Dear Lafayette staff, on behalf of me and my party, I would like to apologize for inconveniencing you with our patronage.

We added an additional main ($8 per person surcharge), so that guest had three options. You can't go wrong with the lemon pancakes, poached eggs in polenta and the chicken salad. Drinks were ordered and charged by consumption and the bloody marys are some of the best I've ever had. The service and presentation across the board on all aspects of the meal were impeccable. The room even has a hidden flat screen tv/monitor which my bridesmaids used to play a sweet slide show. After the meal our server offered departing guests individually packed cookies on a silver platter when they exited the room. I was amazed that we weren't rushed at all.

There was a croissant, 1 chocolate croissant, some slices of bread and a muffin. not a lot but good enough for sharing. I got the brisket burger $21. The burger was cooked medium perfectly and was so large, I only ate half (though I did eat a chocolate croissant before the burger came). It also came with a massive amount of shoe string fries (so tasty but I prefer larger wedges or cuts). I ended up taking home 2/3 of fries and half a burger and made another meal out of it.

We recently went here with a group of friends for brunch and I can't believe I never walked the two blocks down to see the inside of this place. It is spectacular!The interior is absolutely gorg. It's large but it doesn't sound very loud. We sat outside because the weather was beautiful, however.The brunch menu is superb and it was really difficult to pick just one dish. I settled on the soft-scrambled eggs with brioche and it was truly divine. The eggs were perfectly seasoned and creamy without being watery or undercooked. The brioche was like a little toasted pillow of heaven with butter and pesto. Oh jeeze.Several other members of our party ordered the benedict which come in a skillet and were all gobbled up before I even had a chance to see how delicious they were. I'm guessing pretty tasty given the speed with which they were consumed.And one lonely member ordered the lemon pancakes with fresh berries and I was instantly jealous that I also didn't order those. I could have easily tried to consume to meals at once. They looked fantastic and our friend was really pleased.Everyone had multiple rounds of the bloody mary's which all basically come with an appetizer skewered across the top. Most of the tables we saw also had bloody's so you know they're spot on.Afterwards I perused the desserts inside and settled on a birthday cake macaron.

4.0,8/24/2014,"There's something special about checking out a full-on restaurant during the witching hours between lunch & dinner.  The place is quieter, the waiters & waitresses are all just warming up for the evening, yet it's eerily empty save for a few folks who seem to have spilled over from a nearby hotel.So when I stopped in here recently on a date, it was a delight walking in.  We ambled up to the bar & grabbed a few stools on the end.  My co-conspirator was admittedly IPA happy, having mentioned beer not less than five times all during midday coffee hour.  So I could no longer resist her advances.  Me on the other hand, I had a hankering for a more subtle answer.  And happily this here bar has also heard the call of Ommegang and happened to carry my contemporary favorite amber ale, Rare Vos.  What a score!We sat chatting, and ruminating over the politics & lack of freedom in saudi arabia, the proper way to say hello in thai, the best way to pursue a visa in nyc, why dates that choose corona quickly end up in the trash heap, and so on.  I learned quite a lot!For an early beer time, this day was already turning out swell!",0,0,1,Sean S.,"Manhattan, NY",757,1661,36

Beautiful evening in the city so we decided to sit outside which played out beautifully until we got dessert and it started to rain. We got moved inside and got comped some delicious coffee which was a perk, literally. For starters we had the beef tartare which was done beautifully and very tasty. It's a dish that can be hit or miss, and this one was definitely a hit. As entrees we had the croquilles with beef cheek, the beef ravioli which was a special, as well as the striped sea bass. The pastas were wonderful, super fresh and the meat to go with them were perfect. The beef cheek was super tender, and gave body to the whole dish. The beef ravioli which was a special was unstoppable and quite possibly our tables favorite dish. The striped sea bass tasted very fresh, however I wish it was cooked another way other than steamed. The steamed fish gave me a fishy scent which I'm not fond of in all my seafood dishes. Overall a decent dish however.

We ordered drinks at bar, while I was in wash room, the bar tender told my guests the drinks had to be paid at bar first, so I saw one of my guests paid for the drinks when I came out of the washroom.Dinner was fair, considering you are paying for the location. Food was good, but not impressive, this is Manhattan after all, my taste buds are spoiled.I paid for the over-priced dinner,I admit my fault was I did not check the bill item by item in front of my guests. Like I said, this was a business dinner, i was focusing on my guests.  Later on I found out the drinks were added to our dinner bill. I immediately contacted the restaurant for the double charge, thinking this is a honest mistake made by Lafayette, it could easily be clarified and fixed.Since then I had been getting the round and around. Every time i had to tell the situation again to a new person, send the receipt over, then someone promised to look into it and then no response,  I have to call again to start from square one. I wanted to believe a restaurant pride themselves to charge this type of price tag should have some integrity. I am sure we were not the only case facing this type of double charges, am I the only one stupid enough not catching it at the moment so I deserve to be taken advantage of?The drinks charges were so minimum compare to the couple hundred dollars dinner bill I paid, yet the restaurant management chose to hide behind silence. I want to say:  LAFAYETTE, MISTAKE HAPPENS, IT'S OK, JUST FIX IT AND TAKE CARE OF YOUR CUSTOMERS! WHEN YOU DO THE RIGHT THING, THE BUSINESS WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU!

When the waiter brought it, it was nice and hot and fluffy. A con, however, would be that it is pre-made and not freshly made upon order. It comes with only mushrooms in it and I wanted a little something extra, so I asked for tomatoes in addition to the mushrooms, but my request was not able to be fulfilled. I also had a few sips of their freshly made Jardin Vert juice (green apple, kale, ginger, cucumber) which was okay if you're just trying to get your daily supplement of vegetables. However, if you are expecting a good flavor, do not order it. My other friends ordered the Lemon Pancakes and the Omelette du Maïs which weren't bad. The atmosphere is nice however.

I started with the frisee salad with bacon maison and poached organic egg. My favorite part of the meal. It was quite good, and had a nice texture with the crunchy thistly frisee contrasting against the poached egg, and they were generous with the bacon. Mmm. For my entrée, I chose the steak, and it was adequate. It came rare, and even after I asked them to cook it more, it was still pretty bloody. The sauce and onions made the plate a little too sweet for me. The sorbet I ordered for dessert was flavorful and refreshing on a summer afternoon (the berries have been very good this year).

2.0,8/5/2014,"Read beyond ""love, love love"" Lafayette for breakfast, brunch and lunch to understand how incredibly disappointing it is for dinner. Two stars max. When did Lafayette decide to dramatically increase their dinner prices so that every entree is in the $35 neighborhood and for food that doesn't merit those prices?the menu choices for pastas which are in the mid $20's and up are so offbeat they just aren't appealing. There used to be scallops which were awesome and in the $25-$30 price range but alas they are no longer there. Why isn't there a burger on the menu anymore? The only meat choice is steak frites for $38. All the dinner entrees were heavily peppered causing my dinner partner and I, East Village residents, to continue savoring our skate dinner till the following morning. Appetizers are all near $20 including salads, seriously? Wines - a rose was the least $ choice at $14. The entrees offered were too few and elitist. Let me reiterate: the food isn't worthy of the prices being charged. A simple dinner of one appetizer, two entrees and one glass of wine cost over $120. Andrew Carmelli, we think you are a worthy chef and a great restauranteur but please re-think your dinner formula here.

3.0,8/3/2014,"Food: 3.5 stars because of the melon soup (Thought of rating it for 3 initially)but the atmosphere keeps it 3.5-4...I went without knowing Lafayette was participating in restaurant week. My friend and I ended up going for the lunch restaurant week menu. Melon soup- best part of my lunch course. Do you like cold soup? I'm not a fan but I'll def come and get this again. Very freshening clean crispy taste of melon and kind of squash/pumpkin taste. Beautiful plating. Big portion. Salmon tartare- comes w cute fried potato wedges. We personally didn't think the two paired up that great so we ate them separately the tartare was neither salty not saucy. Steak- We asked for medium and we got well done. I'm not sure if this was the reason but the steak was chewy... But nice plating hahaSome fish dish-  crisply grilled with lots of sauce on the bottom. But the fish is not embedded in the sauce because it sits on top of red and green tomatoes, so you can control that part. I didn't think there was anything special about this dish but its not a horrible idea to try it?Sorbet -very freshening that's not overly sugary. THe berries are great and gives u that sugar punch on top of the sorbet. U would be able to find as good or better berry sorbets in nyc though. Black Forest cake- more unique because of the fluffy and whipper layers of cream. Doesn't have an overpowering buttery heavy taste. If u like Black Forest cakes u should get it. I definitely want to bring my friends and family  because the atmosphere was really chill with beautiful French decor, polite and quick service (but sometimes hard to get attention cuz they're so busy).

3.0,7/26/2014,"Lafayette needs little introduction. As one of the newer additions to Andrew Carmellini's empire and the newest entrant to NYC's Michelin-starred restaurants, it's small wonder that it's been received with (mostly) positive acclaim. It's difficult to not fall in love with the space; high ceilings, expansive windows, and a well-stocked boulangerie provide the first welcome for guests. Most of the goods behind the window can be attributed to Per Se vet James Belisle, but the more delicately composed sweets are the creations of Jennifer Yee, who honed her skills at Aureole, The Breslin, and (the now closed) Gilt. The team behind Lafayette is nothing short of impressive, so perhaps my expectations upon entering were a little too lofty.A group of friends and I dropped by for brunch on the Memorial Day, using the day off as an excuse to take a leisurely mid-day meal. We were seated when the majority of our party had arrived in a comfortable booth area towards the back of the dining room. Menus were given out, glasses of water were filled, and we started going through the options in an attempt to narrow down our choices. I was immediately torn between the Brisket Burger and the Smoked Salmon Benedict; thankfully, one of my friends was willing to share the two dishes, which resolved my dilemma.To begin, we had an order of the Boulangerie Basket for the table. A variety of pastries, including croissants, raisin bread, muffins, and sourdough slices were served with confiture and Vermont butter. The croissants were flaky and buttery, and the plain was superior to the chocolate, in my opinion. The raisin bread was the next to disappear, but the majority of the group found the muffins to be too dense and heavy for our liking. The basket is a nice starter for a larger group, though, and well worth the $14 price tag.Our entrees arrived shortly later and after the two of us divided our shared plates, started with the Brisket Burger. The actual patty, which we'd requested cooked to a medium, was loosely packed with a noticeably pink center. There's a faint hint of brisket in each bite, but the patty wasn't quite as juicy or savory as I'd expected; and the bread used, a house-made roll, seemed to lack the substance and density to fully support the patty. The melted raclette cheese and a generous serving of caramelized onions was a nice touch, however, and was even more satisfying with a healthy pile of shoestring fries. The Smoked Salmon Benedict was the more disappointing of the two plates. While creatively served in an iron skillet with two lightly toasted pieces of brioche, the presentation couldn't make up for the dips in execution. The salmon lacked the unctuousness that I had hoped for, and the texture was unpleasantly slimy, almost gelatinous. The additional components on the plate - the poached eggs, the sauce choron, and a bed of lettuce were all satisfactory - but I couldn't justify the price ($21) for the portion nor quality of food.I'd wanted to like Lafayette more than I was willing to admit, especially given Carmellini's backing and the recent one Michelin star status. Yes, the space is lovely and the tempting array of pastries and breads immediately past the restaurant entrance is sure to lure in many carb lovers. I can't say much about the food, except that I've certainly had worse, and I've certainly had better. For the curious: come to sate your curiosity, but for those looking for a more exemplary showing of Carmellini's talents, take a trip to Locanda Verde in TriBeCa.",12,3,6,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

2.0,6/12/2014,"Went for lunch @ 3:00 today, when it was relatively quiet. Big attractive space resembling a French bistro. Patisserie in the front, with stools where people were sipping espressos and eating pastries and macarons, looked welcoming and inviting. Both my friend and I sat in a comfortable spacious booth and had Frisée salads. They skimped on the bacon and were overall disappointing. Their Frisée salad can't hold a candle to the one served @ PASTIS. While we were still drinking our coffee, we were asked to move from our table and move to the bar or the tables near the patisserie, so they could set up for dinner. No waiter helped us with our coffee cups..we had to gather our bags and coats and umbrellas and coffee and fend for ourselves. With all the staff, nobody offered to help us relocate.This was not a way to make a good first impression!Looks like a potential scene to be ""seen"" and if food is secondary, then it'll be busy.

When asked to sit outside the hostess was less than helpful, saying all tables were taken although many people were paying and no one was waiting. Inside half the restaurant was empty but she only offered the tables in the dark area. When refused and spoke to another hostess a table magically was available outside.  After waiting 10 minutes for the menu, same time for the waitress to ask for the order, the burger, ham sandwich and potato potage were very tasty. Our waiter disappeared and another took over without notifying us; perhaps a normal practice but courtesy goes a long way.

Remember the crumbly dry mess you once had at that random bakery in your neighborhood. This ain't the same.These almond crossiants are masterfully made to have the perfect flaky crust, yet still lock in that moisture for the most indulgent and soft almond filling.

But second, they have so many more drool worthy options.  They always have a crossiants of the day which once was banana and chocolate. yum. Their muffins are also fantastic and I'm also always tempted to buy some macarons but fear they might not compare to some of my other favorites in the city.Lafayette is defiantly a place to stop buy for some pasteries and a coffee, especially if you want to impress someone on your knowledge of good French pastry. There isn't much seating but if you wanted to sit down then obviously go ahead and have something to eat in the resturant and order their $14 boulangerie basket!

After doing a round of visual food review on my quest for the ladies room, I can honestly say in my humble opinion, that I wish I had ordered that Smoked Salmon Benedict.

Yes, I wish I got that.Lafayette is the type of place that people in NYC go bonkers over. Why? Historical decor packaged with matching uniforms and amazing lighting , ranks it on an instagram-ability score of SUPER HIGH. But the true gem at Lafayette (aside from its eye brow raising prices) is their bakery. When I bit into that perfect. crunchy, chocolate-y, banana goodness of a Croissant Du Jour, I knew it was love. It is so incredibly hard I find to have a croissant that is crispy on the outside but mushy on the inside. It's definitely contesting with Ceci-Cela for my all time favorite croissant place.

My friend and I agreed had we not grown up in the streets of Beijing eating cumin dusted flavors, we would not have been a fan. So eaters beware!

And forgive the mental leap from food to bathrooms - but the tiles/architecture/design are original and intricate. Even just to wash your hands - check out their facilities. Before leaving Lafayette make sure you grab a pastry from the bakery. Buttery, crisp croissants...this place is almost like a smaller, more modern version of 'Balthazaar'.",0,0,0,Steve G.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",50,37,134

1.0,3/10/2014,"So an update to my last review we recently have been communicating with the restaurant about our experience here, and the customer service is the most horrible I have ever encountered. Everything was awesome when we were talking to the manager Jamie until she ceased to communicate. We followed up and I spoke to the main general manager Joshua. When I spoke to Joshua he told me that most likely my boyfriend didn't get food poisoning from them if at all, and that other food or a taxi had gotten him sick. First of all, he is not a Doctor and should not be so presumptuous as to diagnose anything. Second of all we visited a doctor and they confirmed food poisoning, seafood was the most likely culprit.When my boyfriend dislikes food he just doesn't eat it, oftentimes the restaurant takes notice and offers a refund, he never takes it. That is for just not liking it. This guy wouldn't do anything and he got us sick. The guy was very condescending towards me so my boyfriend called back and was very angry. The guy told him not to cuss. As a customer we owe you nothing, however this is your job, so instead of getting defensive you should probably do what you are paid for and figure out what you did wrong.Basically this guy wouldn't admit to any wrong doing. My boyfriend is going to the authorities to report them, finally he gave us our money back but wow he needs to work on treating his customers well instead of being demeaning",2,0,1,Cymbre M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,33,1

The food, however, wasn't as great as expected. I had the omelette, which was so overcooked that the eggs were rubbery. The potatoes and meat inside were actually burnt (not sure how this happened?). My partner had the fried egg sandwich and was disappointed, as well. He wasn't expecting ""diner fare"", but had hoped that the sandwich might actually stick together a bit, rather than being two pieces of bread essentially disconnected from the egg and meat.

4.0,3/9/2014,"I have to start with, "" I love this restaurant"", but need to bring up a few disappointing issues with dinner last night. Since this restaurant opened one of the inconsistencies has been the service and that was the issue last night at the maitre d station. The ladies working were less than friendly, actually they were rude. Secondly, I don't think a patron should have to wind their way through the bar to get to the coat check room. With all of the ""friendly ladies"" working at the front desk someone can bring coats to the coat check area. Our server, Sun Ah K, was amazing. The last time we dined there she was our server. If it wasn't for her we would not have tried the incredible interpretation of Ile flotante or floating island, a sublime meringue dessert ( I don't even like meringue). Speaking of things I don't eat, french fries... However these are possibly the best, crunchiest, slightly salty fries ever. Literally couldn't stop eating them. Also dissapointing were our salads; both them overdressed. Mine so much so I actually sent it back. Not sure I have ever sent food back at a restaurant.

The mushroom risotto was very heavy (even for risotto) but the flavors were enjoyable. It was pretty buttery but I'm a fan of that. Not sure if everyone else will be. My almond tart was just mediocre. It had a mound of whipped cream cheese next to it but it didn't really add much to the dish.

The salmon wasn't overly fishy and had wonderful flavor. The duck was very tender and not overly cooked. The almond tart was great, but could've been a bit hotter when served. One of my compatriots got the mushroom risotto, but it was more akin to eating some melted butter. It was too heavy and rich to be edible for an entree. That and the slightly burned bread are the only real complaints of the meal. Perhaps not a true 4 star, but I'll round up and be back another time to try the real menu.

3.0,3/3/2014,The food was ok - I expected more after all the hype I had seen on blogs. The service was not what I had expected of such a highly rated restaurant. Our server disappeared all together after some time. We were charged for 3 extra glasses of wine (which is typically easy to gloss over). We had to ask for condiments on multiple occasions. I enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant. Along with the way they celebrate their guests birthdays! That was fun. The mixed drinks can be skipped. Go for the wine instead (and make sure you're not overcharged). I ordered sunchokes and they never made it to the table. Our meal itself also took a very long time to be prepared.

3.0,3/2/2014,"See my previous review for dinner- I am downgrading after a much-anticipated but disappointing brunch. Our large group trickled in and we had some green juice and oysters at the bar while waiting. The oysters were fantastic as they were last time and the green juice was a passable alternative to alcohol since it was before noon and we couldn't be served. Once everyone had arrived we were whisked from the bright, spacious main level to the dark, gloomy basement. I don't think it would've been as bad if it was dark outside but it was a drastic change during the day. The decor was very elegant though. We put in an order of the pastry basket and a few cheeses to kill time before we could order cocktails and our entrees to go with it. The breads were all good, I had some bites of the blueberry muffin. The cheese selection was diverse and served with various apples, jams, and bread. I was a little ticked off when the busboy dropped it off and said, ""do you want to know what the cheeses are?"" It should've been our waitress or at least someone we could understand; and they should've explained without asking. We were able to order drinks and entrees and they arrived promptly but with confusion about who ordered what. I'm not sure how they do that at other places but I'm sure they could figure it out. We didn't see our waitress but for maybe another time after that. Maybe they thought they would turn the table over if we didn't order another round of drinks, but I really hate when places do that. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but the egg white frittata was dry, dense, and boring. I ate about 1/4 before I got tired of eating thick, bland egg. Others ordered yogurt and berries that looked really good, and the brisket burger that was phenomenal but would've been too rich for me to eat a whole serving of it. Anything that came with fries had a mountain of them, and they were piping hot, crispy, and delicious. I had major food envy when I spied the other tables around us being served pancakes piled with berries. We got another round of drinks and they seemed to accept that we were going to stay. I will say they obsessively refilled our water glasses so we could never be thirsty. I would possibly return for brunch but make sure to go after noon, get a reservation upstairs, and try anything but the frittata.",1,0,0,Tara W.,"Ridgewood, NJ",488,585,132

3.0,1/27/2014,"I simply love The Dutch and Locanda Verde, so I was eager to check out Andrew Carmellini's new space.  The reviews for Lafayette were rather mixed from the get-go, but I thought that it still warranted a visit.  One evening last summer, I happened to be in the area and was dying to try their infamous desserts.  We stopped in after dinner and grabbed the last two seats at the massive bar.  I figured I would give one of their champagne cocktails a shot while I waited for my plated treat.  My Rive Gauche was a tart and spicy blend of vodka, passion fruit, basil, pink peppercorn, and champagne.  It was a playful and refreshing compliment to our desserts.  The Sweet Cheese Cremant was like a ricotta cheesecake sprinkled with cornmeal croutons and served with a pickled blueberry sorbet.  Despite the fact that I prefer most other desserts over cheese-based ones, I actually loved its smooth, creaminess.   But that experience was quite a while ago, and I still needed to go back to sample the actual food.  So, I immediately chose it for a recent lunch near my office.  Though I had made a reservation, it was virtually unnecessary because the place was empty, even at noon on a Friday.  We were immediately seated and treated to a charming experience from our gracious server.  We munched on doughy, perfect French bread and waited for the entrees that we had decided to share.  The Rôtisserie Chicken Salad included a moist and perfectly cooked quarter (or possibly third) of a bird offset by a salad of bland organic grains and walnuts, drizzled with a boring yogurt dressing.  The Black Fettuccine was overcooked, but much more flavorful with its tender ribbons of cuttlefish and chunks of ruby red shrimp, clams, and chorizo.  I washed the heavy meal down with a glass of Jardin Vert, a healthy green blend of green apple, kale, ginger, and cucumber.  The spicy tartness really helped to smooth out the hefty edibles.Though the food was slightly above average, the quaint bistro atmosphere and conscientious service left my friend and I with content smiles and thoughts of return visits.",4,0,2,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

We arrived on time and were warmly greeted and immediately seated.  The space is quite beautiful and very French.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and the service was attentive but not overly so.  We ordered a round of cocktails and then a bottle of wine and the wine sommelier was very helpful and made some very good recommendations.  We started off with half a dozen oysters, the oxtail and foie gras terrine, the bone marrow and snails, and the house-made sausage.  All of these were really spectacular but I have to say that the bone marrow and snails were an awesome combination and that the terrine was some of the best that I have ever had.  The house-made sausage was just amazing as well.  For entrees, we went with the steak frites, the lamb chops, the duck, and the short ribs.  The steak was cooked perfectly as was the duck.  I got the short ribs and they were extremely tasty.  I have been to Betony and had their short ribs which are supposed to legendary but I think that Lafayette's are better.  The lamb chops I did not taste but there were no complaints coming from my buddy who ordered them.  Out of everything that we ordered the lamb chops looked the best, I had a little bit of remorse for not ordering them.  The portions were definitely hearty and will keep you warm on a cold night. After dinner we got a round of after dinner drinks and some espresso, it was going to be a long night.  We ordered some cream puffs topped with house-made caramel and they were pretty amazing as well, the chew from the caramel was just awesome.  All in all, the tab came out to slightly over $100 pp which was a bargain for what we got.  I will definitely be back in the spring when they hopefully change the menu around again.",0,0,0,Matthew H.,"Houston, TX",133,334,645

4.0,1/19/2014,"KenScale: 8.5/10I recently paid a visit to Lafayette for a weekend brunch since my initial visit to the restaurant for dinner last year. I liked many of the French bistro dishes from Andrew Carmellini, and had wanted to try this place during brunch time even though I'm not a huge brunch person because the best foods from a restaurant tend to come during dinner time and the brunch menu tends to get over-simplified with lots of eggs. The brunch at Lafayette was just as pleasant as the dinner, and I enjoyed all the food that I had.My meal started with Egg Lafayette, a sort of deviled egg with smoked sablefish and trout caviar that was a great bite to start the day. Next came Prime Beef Tartare with watercress and quail egg, another dish that I liked a lot for having that chewy texture of beef tartare preserved without overpowering it with seasoning. I've heard of great things about the restaurant's Brisket Burger with caramelized onion and raclette, so I knew I had to try it. The burger was so rich and decadent, and even though I was starting to get full toward the middle of my bites, I still couldn't stop eating it with really good fries on the side. I wouldn't put the burger on the same level as Minetta Tavern's Black Label Burger, but it's certainly not far behind. I ended the meal with raspberry tart, a delightful dish that I liked for not being overly sweet.The restaurant was absolutely packed during brunch hours, not even counting a small army of people waiting to pick up sweet treats at the bakery attached to the restaurant. There are so many factors that make Lafayette a place that hits all the right notes as an ideal brunch place, from the chic European décor to the straightforward yet well executed bistro fare.

Then our waiter came over and was a complete jerk.  He wasn't friendly, nice or welcoming - he made for as though  we were bothering him by being there. Throughout the entire service he wasn't vaguely interested in trying to be helpful or courteous and was even condescending at several points through the night. It was probably the worst service i have received in a very long time.  My friend was still eating her meal and I had half my meal still on my plate and he reaches over and says - oh i will wrap this for you. Why are you clearing my plate when my friend is still eating; plus I wasn't finished either!!! During dessert no less than 5 times did the wait staff come over to try to clear our food within the space of 45 mins - we were clearly still eating - seems to be a common theme that night. Perhaps they just wanted to kick us out but there were clearly other people left in the restaurant and the table behind us had just ordered their dessert. The food was good which is too bad because neither my friend or I will not be returning to this restaurant. At the end of the night we ask to speak to the manager and while she was apologetic and gave us her card and said she was sorry for our bad experience she defended the waiter by"" saying he had a very difficult table that evening - not that that should justify his actions"".  That definitely wasn't the correct thing to say to us...Bottom line the atrocious service overshadowed the food.",0,0,0,suzanne w.,"New York, NY",11,12,7

4.0,12/31/2013,"No problem getting reservations for this past Sunday. Definitely an upside of people being out of town!French bistro ambiance with good mood lighting. Corner location with giant windows and outdoor seating. The place is extremely charming and cute.Start off with crusty rustic bread with thankfully soft butter. My trout was interestingly paired with cabbage and mustard, but hey it worked. Tried some of the lamb chops, which were very tender. Heard good things about the pumpkin risotto. I really loved the smokiness of the brussel sprouts, though I found the bacon a bit dry.We each got our own dessert instead of sharing hehe. My personal fav was the gateau marjorlaine layer cake, even though I almost never order chocolate cake. The layers are nicely balanced with respect to textures and flavors. I found the holiday cake so-so. My friend loved his chocolate pot de creme.I think it's nice that they bring out a macaron tower with a sparkler if it's your birthday.This place definitely should be higher than 3.5 stars.

4.0,12/29/2013,"I love this place! From decor to food to wine, this place screams ""french""! And it feels very warm and cozy, not pretentious at all. Came here meeting a friend for drink. We were sitting at the bar and immediately falling in love with the ambiance and decor. The wine list is also decent, mostly french wine. Our bartender last night, Patrick, was so friendly and nice enough to explain the ingredients in the cocktails my friend drinking (yeah she just randomly pick one and did not know what she's drinking). I could not say much about the food as we only had two apps. I really like the raw scallop in smoked sweet potato puree and roasted almonds. Light and flavorful. I have already made plans coming back for the food menu next week!We came in 7ish on a Sat. There were still tables for walk-in. But we preferred the bar. By 8:30 the restaurant was packed - there were people standing around the bar and waiting for tables. So if you plan on coming for dinner do make a reservation.

5.0,12/27/2013,"5 stars for the pastry shop. 4 stars for brunch.A table for 7 opened up last minute on Opentable on Saturday for Sunday, so I grabbed it. My friends were all late - some were 20 minutes past - and they were nice about letting us get seated first. We were all seated a little before 3 which is the end of the brunch menu. They do hold your card for the large table res.I got the baked eggs. We shared the bread basket. I was sad there wasn't a coconut banana chocolate croissant in the basket so we ordered that on the side and shared it 7 ways. Service was great. It's a pretty standard brunch fare. I stopped by a few nights later to pick up pastries - the guy behind the pastry counter was so nice. I got a box of 12 macarons to bring to LA with me. I only got to try the confetti looking birthday cake one and loved it. And it travels well for the record. I also got another aforementioned croissant and found it to be a heavy dessert... not like a breakfast pastry. I wish there was more banana flavor to it. The butter cookies were also a solid 4 star as was the glazed lemon madeleine cookie and the butterscotch eclair (I've never seen such variety in eclairs!). What blew my mind were the canneles...

We were able to fit 15 of us very comfortably around a large rustic wooden table. We had chosen the menu in advance so all the food was served family style, which I think lent a really fun atmosphere to the event. We started with the charcuterie platter (the pate was delicious), deviled eggs (not my favorite), and a Maine crab tartine, which was maybe a bit too salty, but very tasty. For the main course we had rotisserie chicken salad and the brisket burgers, which were my absolute favorite. The burger is one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten.

2.0,12/11/2013,"Not sure what all the hype is about. I came here for brunch during the last warm days of fall for a late brunch. The place with teeming with eager-nyc-beavers, the type that readily jump to announce that they've just had a meal at the latest 'it' spot. I'm not sure I really buy into the hype. The best part of my experience was the breadbasket. We all got a sample of breakfast pastries and they were pretty good. Not pain quotidien good. But good. I became increasingly unimpressed as I endured an inexplicably long wait to get a bloody mary cocktail. I saw the server knock over the bloody mary at the next table over, and I got a taste of it through some of the residual drink that fell on my feet as well. It's a new restaurant and I understand that the servers will be a bit green, but for these prices, I expect some training. The man was carrying two drinks. My expensive entree finally arrived, I ate most of it, again, not impressed by the eggs benedict I had ordered nor by any of the other meals my friends ordered and insisted I ""have a taste."" Perhaps my forray into Brooklyn brunches have left my standards too high for Manhattan resturants. I don't know.I think my bill was just shy of $50 and for brunch, especially an unimpressive brunch, I'm pretty sure I overpaid. I'm going back there for dinner because people still insist on eating there. Hopefully I'll come back with a better impression. Otherwise, I expect this restaurant to go the way of the Furbie.

4.0,12/8/2013,"Brunch gods be praised: a restaurant that takes reservations -- for two no less! A nouveau-quaint ambience, if you can imagine that. Gorgeous. The kind of place that creates those remote (until now) and much sought-after Sex-and-the-City moments.  My brunches always require a Bloody Mary and I much appreciated Lafayette's version, the Bloody Marie, which came with a salt rim and plentiful garnishes.To start, my girlfriend and I split a coconut banana chocolate croissant. This might have been a great dessert option, too. Either way, it tastes like perfection -- the highlight of the meal. A must-put-in-your-mouth. To my delight, my menu informs me that Lafayette uses only organic and local eggs. I order the Baked Eggs Marocaine, which, I can gather, means Moroccan baked eggs. I was stumped, however, by ""panisse"" and  ""merguez,"" two untranslated words that described the dish on the menu. My girlfriend sweetly googles them from her phone. I wonder, after she does, why not just say, ""chickpea flour patty"" and ""spicy beef and lamb sausage?"" I suppose one word is better than a few, but from the glances I stole of the patrons to either side of me, I was brunching with the ballerz. And ballerz love French words, even if they only pretend to understand them. Anyway, this dish was really good, but I was not blown away. I was still dreaming of my croissant. On the way out, I could not resist the macaroons, especially after my girlfriend bought a few. I bought three and they came in the most beautiful little box. A nice touch, I think, that makes the purchase special. I highly recommend the spiced caramel. I'm excited to come back -- if only to try more of the baked goods, which, I suspect, bridged my gap from A-OK to fandom. Je ne peux pas résister à une pâtisserie, peu importe comment j'essaye.

4.0,11/27/2013,"IN SHORT: A bright, sunny space that wants to become a part of your neighborhood brunch routine. Andrew Carmellini's newest French bistro meets restaurant meets market is a comfortable corner that doesn't take itself too seriously, for better or for worse.THE STORY: Lafayette seems as if it were designed for brunch. With two full walls of wide windows, the space takes full advantage of its corner location, and its high ceiling with elegant metallic details emphasizes the breathing room available for a relaxing meal. Thoughtful details abound, from the bone yellow walls, dark wood and blue tiled floors, to the marble countertops and soft, leather benches. The interior seems to glow during the morning and early afternoon hours, an effect that would be lost in the evening, making it the ideal space to enjoy your first meal of the weekend.The food itself occupies a place that is both classically French and comfortably approachable, with the Smoked Salmon Benedict on brioche with sauce cheron and the Baked Eggs hard-cooked with mushrooms, sausage, and rich red sauce stealing the show. Both are presented in a cast-iron dish, emphasizing the loose, rustic quality of the restaurant. The Egg White Frittata also comes served with truffle mushrooms, reflecting the traditional French influences that dictate every dish. The eggs are always fresh and masterfully cooked, full of thick, rich flavor, embodying the perfect paradigm of Carmellini's cuisine.Service is quick, but entirely mediocre, standing far in the background of the restaurant's food. While the staff is not as knowledgable as a Carmellini restaurant warrants, the plentiful bakery and warm, fragrant food deserves additional visits, and will certainly cultivate a regular crowd more than Balthazar ever could.",5,2,2,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245

It's a pretty restaurant.  The layout is nice, the ceiling is high.  It looks nice.  However, I like to go to restaurants where I'm made welcome, where the staff is hospitable.  So here goes...Been here four times... I've eaten here twice for dinner, once for lunch, and tonight I came in for drinks and an appetizer at the bar.  Unless I have to attend a business function, I'll never go back.  The hostesses are not rude, but they are cold.  No smile, and no effort to be outgoing. Like I wrote, been here four times and it's been the same every time from the hostesses... like they don't need you, they don't want you, and you're taking up their time. The bartenders ignored us when we sat down.  There were four other people at the bar, so the place was not busy by any means. To have to ask for a glass of water from a bartender, or even to have to ask to order, when the place is empty and the bartenders are chatting with each other is just wrong.  If this was my restaurant I'd get rid of these of these people.  I have had the same waiter twice though, who was very good; attentive, and professional.  A big guy with a bald head.  That's the only reason I give Lafayette 2 stars.  One of the reasons I love Balthazar ( which this place tries to be and fails miserably ) is because the staff is great.  Why restaurants keep rude staff is beyond me.  I will not patronize a restaurant where I am not made to feel welcome.  There are a few very nice places close by; Five Points, Acme, and Le Philosophe.  The food is better in all of these places, go there instead.",3,0,0,Esdwd L.,"New York, NY",0,14,0

I know a lot of people travel like that all the time. I don't. Not exactly my ""cup of tea"". And it wasn't the perfect circumstance under which to enjoy someplace like Lafayette.First of all I really didn't know anything about the place. My wife just said: ""Oh, you're going to NYC? You have to go to Lafayette"". So I didn't really know what to look forward to. Secondly I got into NYC after 8:00. Really all I wanted to do was figure out exactly where my interview was going to be, eat something quick and simple for dinner and go to sleep. Thirdly I don't really enjoy eating someplace like Lafayette alone. So the deck was a little stacked against them from the start. The fact that they could overcome all of that and make me like them so much says a lot right there.I called about making a reservation and was told I should just walk in (it was a Tuesday night). A short subway trip on the Lexington line got me there in no time. When I walked in they said there would be a little bit of a wait for a party of one (the place was packed). So I decided I'd have a look in the bakery section to see what I might be able to take home to my wife. I hadn't been looking for any more than ten minutes when I heard them calling my name.The tables for two are very nice sized but you do feel like you're kind of packed in like a sardine. They need to actually pull the table completely out to let someone sit on the bench side of the table. This means you don't really have any privacy at all whatsoever. I wasn't talking to myself so no one could get anything out of me but I could hear everything that was being said at the table next to mine. Even trying not to hear I could still hear. Don't go there if you're planning to rob a bank or something.I wasn't up for anything too complicated to eat. The simpler the better so for my entree I chose the dry aged strip steak with frites and the quinoa garniture.The steak and frites were... perfect. The frites were crisp and perfectly seasoned. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and was one of the best pieces of beef I have ever had. So tender! and fabulous flavor. The quinoa? Well the quinoa almost cost them a star. The flavor was excellent but it was rather dry. So dry in fact that I was about to ask for some olive oil to fix it when I had a stroke of genius! The steak came topped with an extremely generous dollop of béarnaise butter. So I offloaded the quinoa onto my plate and stirred it in with it. This fixed the dryness and gave it an added depth of flavor saving the entire meal (gross exaggeration but it did save the quinoa).Fixing the quinoa did create another problem however. I ate everything (even all the bread which was divine). So, no room for dessert. At a place like Lafayette this seems like a crime, no? But I found the perfect solution. An espresso made with Stumptown's Lafayette blend. It was the perfect end to this meal.I found the service to be excellent. Everyone was perfectly attentive. Sometimes I feel that poor service comes to those who dine alone but not here. I didn't feel rushed or ignored because there wouldn't be such a big gratuity in the offing. And like I said in the beginning, to overcome the hole they were in says a lot. I left Lafayette feeling so much better than when I went in. Isn't that the way it should be?",3,1,0,Richard R.,"Culver City, CA",138,241,2054
4.0,10/17/2013,"Hello (^_^) This restaurant opened this year on Lafayette Street yet the place already has an old school classic New York restaurant feel.  Lafayette is very much a similar idea to Balthazar in Soho. The menu is french bistro and they even have a bakery shop inside of the restaurant like at Balthazar. I came here for dinner three times now and I found more appetizers that I wanted to order than from the entree menu. Here are my top three appetizer picks. Grilled Mediterranean Octopus, Scallop Crudo, Beef Tartar. I had the lamb chop and duck breast from entree, and lamb with couscous was fantastic. Between the two pastas I had, Spaghetti Nicoise was so yummy. If you are group of three~four people then you should definitely share their salad. The salad's portion is really big and it's almost too big for two people to share. New York restaurant's trend change every two years, but I say this place is going to stay for a long time. I recommend you to come here for any night of the week with friends and parents, small party of two to group birthday dinner.xoxo Cutie Patroller",1,1,1,Cutie Patroller ..,"Manhattan, NY",1916,123,850
3.0,10/16/2013,"This is a review for dinner, in which I joined the geriatric crowd and went to Lafayette at 5:15 and had to wait to be seated for their 5:30 dinner menu. Yep, turning 30 changes you.Black Fettuccine, cuttlefish, ruby shrimp, clams & chorizo: I'm not a big fan of pasta. I love love love noodles, but there's something about pasta in which I NEVER order it. It's the heavy, creamy or tomato sauces that deter me or maybe the fact that I love my noodles to be submerged in a beef/pork/spicy broth. However, what intrigued me about the black fettuccine dish was the seafood and chorizo. The moment I took that first bite, I  scolded myself for NEVER ordering pasta. It was like eating beef after a four year hiatus of ""I can't eat cows, they're adorable!"" A pasta epiphany! The chorizo complemented the seafood and pasta perfectly; just the right amount of pizazz. And then I tried my friend's Coquilles with beef cheek ragoût & brebis. Angels were singing now! I went to town on both dishes and in between bites I stuffed some of the Quinoa, brussels sprouts, field mushrooms into my cavernous mouth. I wasn't even hungry and I managed to eat every single thing in front of me. Mission accomplished.I might be inclined to go back to Lafayette to try brunch or a casual dinner with friends or family, but it's not a restaurant that makes my ""It was so delicious I could eat there every day."" That my friends, is reserved for Naruto Ramen or Bond Street Sushi. If you don't know where to go for dinner, go to Lafayette. It's a pretty large restaurant so I'm guessing one could walk in without reservations and not have to wait to be seated, IE Mercer Kitchen. Yep, I'm a sucker that keeps going to Mercer Kitchen and waiting 30 minutes even though I made reservations.

It turned out to just be plain eggs with a few pieces of squash in the middle with a small side of lettuce. The eggs were ok but for the price and reputation I was definitely expecting better.  My friend got the egg white frittata which was a little better. Looking around the other egg dishes looked similarly weak, and the omelet 's were made without the filling and then just spooned on afterwards so it didn't seem cooked together.

3.0,10/11/2013,"I agree with the reviewers who say 'good not great'. I've been here twice now. The first time I went it was a 10:00 reservation on a Friday night. Food good, service good. This week (October, 2013) I came back with a group of four. One of our party was later than the other three. Did the usual ""we can't seat you til your party is here"" dance (do they not realize that seating people usually equates to a bigger bill since you start drinking? Anyway, i digress.) Our fourth finally arrived 10 minutes later. We were scowled at, and lectured by, the hostess of our tardy attendance. We kindly reminded her that we could have been seated without the fourth and gotten the proverbial party started.. In haste, we made it to the table as we'd been admonished to clear the table by 8:30.Our waiters, fortunately, fared better. Kind service, a nice sommelier and a relatively decent pace. Pate appetizer was good, with a nice touch of a glass jar of cornichons and a ramekin of mustard. The famed rotisserie roast chicken for two was, honestly, unremarkable.  I've also tried their steak and broccoli rabe as well. Once again, nice but unremarkable.At the end of the dinner, we realized we actually did finish up dinner by about 8:30. Lucky for us huh, otherwise we'd be scolded by that wonderful hostess. But here's the kicker. We may have cleared the table but there sure wasn't anyone waiting for it, and there were plenty of empty tables. The hostess wasn't the end of the world for us.

The mussels come with a great sauce as well.Two people from our party got the chicken dinner for two, and I thought the chicken was cooked well and retained the juices. I enjoyed my duck au poivre as it is a tender breast that comes on a bed of mixed grains and sweet red wine reduction sauce. Duck always shines with a bit of sweetness.The service was fine, but it's worth stating that the cocktails aren't good.

The restaurant is very stylish and comfortable. We had reservations, and were seated immediately. The restaurant was quite busy. Drinks were above average- the bar is well stocked, having my favorite gin, and the favorite rye whisky of another member of our party.The menu is nicely balanced. Anyone should find something to their liking. We shared raw oysters (east coast), pate maison, and grilled octopus for appetizers. Served with delicious cornichons and mustard. They were very well prepared, with attention payed to details.There were no special dishes offered to us, so we ordered from the menu. I had ""Duck au poivre"", served with a strange roasted radish. I found the radish difficult to eat.   I found that the duck was prepared impeccably, even though there was no ""poivre"" flavor. It was very satisfying.We also tried the steamed black bass, served with shellfish and ""bouillabaisse jus"". We also tried a fresh risotto.The restaurant actually has a take out bake shop, so we were looking forward to dessert. Strangely, this turned out the weakest course. We ordered the ""profiterole maison"", and another dessert that had some chocolate. They were surprisingly mediocre, and they both tasted alike, although one was served frozen, the other chilled.Service was uneven.

Sadly, the next trip back for a proper meal was a disaster. We came in on the later side, sat in the nearly empty outdoor area, ordered a few pastas and bottles of wine to be split between 3 people. We were later joined by two friends who wished to order drinks. The staff acted completely annoyed because it was near closing and didn't want to serve us drinks, despite the fact there were still about 10 tables seated inside. They then dropped the check without being asked and proceeded to come back every minute or so to ask if the check was ready.if this wasn't rude enough, one of the waiters got in a verbal, nearly physical altercation with a couple a few tables away.

3.0,10/2/2013,"When the great whale of a restaurant, Chinatown Brasserie, closed in the summer of 2012, rumors of both the space's acquisition by Andrew Carmellini and the French restaurant (something he'd been wanting to open since he began cooking professionally) he planned to fill the carcass, err, location with abounded. In seemingly the blink of an eye (though truthfully, about ten months) the new restaurant opened its doors. When Mimi, Pierre (neither of whom are French, shockingly) and I met there for dinner several weeks later, we found that a great many Gepettos had been consumed by this Monstro. Perhaps the Ashley Madison contingent was drawn optimistically to the garish red interior - a sight which I found difficult not to chuckle at, given Mr. Carmellini's lengthy profile in the Times laced with anecdotal bromides about letting his food speak for him. We thus contemplated re-fastening our jackets for the sake of conformity and uneasily creaked into our large banquette. The sommelier came almost immediately, the early makings of a gleam in his eye, likely hoping our unorthodox pairing marked us as tourists looking to cap our last night in New York. To his credit, he wasn't visibly deflated at our selecting a surprisingly reasonably priced burgundy. Our waiter, however, was somewhat confused at our request for additional plates with which to share our appetizers, though given the considerate amount of table space we had, it was certainly not going to cause any problems. In retrospect, our waiter may merely have been concerned that he wouldn't beat the appetizers to the table, as they seemed to appear scarcely after the conclusion of the breaths that carried their orders. Normally, I take this sort of occurrence as a positive. The kitchen is a bit nervous, and wants to stay so on top of its orders that tables aren't given any time to settle in. I prefer a nervous kitchen to a swamped kitchen or a sloppy kitchen or an inefficient kitchen. Unfortunately, the icy grip of a skittish line cook served as a demonstration of the zeroth law of thermodynamics; my short rib ravioli, the unlucky beneficiaries, were cold. Even less fortunately, the line cook seemed to be something of a physicist, as Mimi's roasted beet roots were a prime example of the second law of thermodynamics; the irreversibility of natural processes due to entropy. In layman's terms, overcooked things can't be uncooked. As we started on our second glasses, I hoped that he had no plans of demonstrating the third law, and if he did, that he'd choose something other than my steak.As luck would have it, my steak was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and worth the slight wait. The frites were excellent and worthy of the moniker. If George Bush The Younger personally demanded me to call them Freedom Fries or lose my citizenship, I'd ask if he'd find it amenable to have Freedom Doors or a Freedom Press instead. Mimi's fish was not so exemplary, but it was still a fair sight better than either of our appetizers, while Pierre's duck was likewise enjoyable, if unspectacular. Left then, with these two diametric experiences in one evening, it is impossible to crown Lafayette, in spite of the hype around it, however faded. It is no roi malgré lui.

Nitty gritty in full effect. Safely, I will call this the ten minute restaurant. Because everything takes ten plus minutes. 1. How long does it actually take to greet your customers when the restaurant has just opened and is practically empty? I'll hold for your response.... Try ten minutes just to get someone to seat us. Wait... It gets better. Once you are seated you have a bus boy approach you initially for water. Pause for waiter... Try ten more minutes. At this point, I've had it. Mind you, the restaurant is empty with plenty of staff.2. Waiter finally arrives. We order a cappuccino, salmon and eggs benedict, and the waffle. Food comes before cappuccino. Of courseeeeee! Waiter of course is no where to be found.. Instead he is in the back setting up tables. Who does that? After asking the bus boy, the cappuccino arrives ten minutes later. Cold of course. Sighs. Food quality, a solid 1.5. Nothing interesting whatsoever and mediocre quality. The waffle didn't even have real Nutella spread, just a bad hazelnut knockoff. 3. Swear, I never saw the waiter again after the order was taken. We had to ask for salt and pepper and no one ever even checked in to see how the food was. And then to end the meal, again we had to ASK someone else for the check. And then on top of that, the food is extremely overpriced. And for what?

The greens that accompanied my sandwich were too salty for me to eat...so I ate the pommes frites which were delicious (and the best thing on the table). I also had a bite of my friend's pancakes which were wonderfully fluffy with a tasty berry sauce.Now on to the service... The host who seated us was great and very nice but our server was hilariously awful. My friend asked for water and when she did, he just looked at her - no acknowledgement of her request, no smile. In fact, there wasn't a single smile. We constantly had to ask for refills on coffee and water. I don't think he said anything to us besides, ""are you ready for the check?"" He was probably the worst server I've encountered in quite a while.",2,0,0,Wendy L.,"Berkeley, CA",678,1253,76

4.0,8/13/2013,"Solid dinner spot. Surprisingly not as full as I would have thought given how much difficulty we experienced trying to get a reservation, but I guess that's other people's loss. Specific dishes we tried:Roasted Beet Root, red onions, cashew, bergamot yogurt - well composed dish, really bright flavors, I may not obsess over this the way I do about ABC Kitchen's beets, but we did enjoy this one quite a bit. 5/5Maine Crab à la Nage, smoked tomato - the subtle flavor of the crab was completely overwhelmed; would have enjoyed a simple boiled crab more. 3/5Summer Stone Fruit Tartine, lardo, rosemary - good pastry, but could probably have used a little more lardo for balance. Good, but nothing to write home about. 4/5Mission Fig Agnolotti, duck ham, hazelnuts - loved this dish; complex balance of sweet, savory, umami. 5/5Coquilles with veal cheek ragoût & brebis - a bit of a classic dish really but fall-apart tender veal cheek and well executed overall. 5/5Daily special pasta - bacalao ravioli in a parmesan broth - this was just weird. 1/5Peach and almond ""tarte rustique"" - this says it serves 2, but we went 4 ways on it and that was just fine for us. Nice pastry, but again, nothing earth-shattering here. The raspberry sorbet was drizzled with some honey which hardened over time, turning it into a kind of cage for the two scoops. 3/5Incidentally, the sourdough bread served with dinner can be bought at the bakery and is excellent.",1,0,0,Benjamin H.,"New York, NY",60,28,1

This locale is good choice for an intimate dinner or a group of friends.The menu was varied. Service was excellent. Lots of staff tended to our needs. We shared a raw seafood tower which was fantastic. Each of us ordered and enjoyed a different main dish. I had a pasta dish which to my surprise was well prepared and extremely tasty.

1.0,8/10/2013,"Plain and simple, this place sucks. It purports to be some brand new cool downtown restaurant with superstar chef (something I don't really care about but have no problem with if the food is good), and instead we wound up wasting our Saturday evening deciding to try something new thinking it would at least be mediocre based on these things.The food was literally inedible. We ordered the butter lettuce as a starter and I can honestly say that my five year old son could prepare a more artfully presented and designed salad. Imagine an enormous plate of dried butter lettuce heads garnished with approximately two slices of radish and cucumber and draped in salty chunks of ham. For our main we had spaghetti and the steak frites. I can't accurately review the spaghetti, as I only had one bite of it and could eat no more due to the extreme amount of salt. I would have sent it back had there been any inquiring staff. The steak also had enough salt on it to have made the complete journey along the Oregon trail, and the shoe-leather consistency to match. Hours later, my husband's mouth is still puckered. At this point, we thought it might be best to skip dessert and abandon all hope for the rest of the meal. It took ten minutes just to get the check, despite being in a grossly overstaffed section. We paid the $130 this meal cost (most of which went uneaten, and would have been more like $150 had we tipped the appropriate 20%), and walked out, of course unnoticed and without anyone saying thank you or good night. No one even inquired as to why our entire meal was uneaten, which I wouldn't even bring home for my dog to eat. This place is just a flashy tourist attraction that pays no mind to actually making and serving good food; don't be fooled, they just want to take your money.

4.0,8/6/2013,"It was the night before I was supposed to leave on vacation. In order to look somewhat presentable in a swimsuit, I had been doing the summer diet thing for several weeks, and now I found myself facing a serious problem.A 10-course chef's dinner at Lafayette, on the company dime.But not to worry. I had a plan. I would only have a small taste of everything, and keep away from alcohol, and therefore the damage would be limited. SPOILER: I did not stick to this plan. SPOILER #2: Save room for dessert.We began at the bar, where we waited for our entire party to arrive (I sipped Diet Cokes). Once we were all present, we were led through the beautiful dining room to our table. Lafayette has been called the Great Gatsby of restaurants, so gorgeous is the decor. We got ourselves situated, and soon dinner was served.(Note: our reservation was for ten - and we were notified by the restaurant beforehand that for such a large party, we would be having the chef's choice of courses, and could not order a la carte. This was a problem for precisely none of us.)Food:La Riviera: 5/5. A creamy cheese served with fresh radishes and roasted peppers. Speaking as a person who generally doesn't enjoy cheese ... I had to exercise all my willpower to not demolish the entire platter. Many many days later, this plate is still on my mind.Butter lettuce salad: 3/5. Served with Roquefort cheese and ham. At this point I was still sticking hardcore to my plan so I mostly stuck to the lettuce, and nibbled at the ham. Simple and refreshing, though nothing to write home about.Selection of oysters: 4/5. Oysters ... you shuck them, you serve them. Nothing spectacular, but these were very, very fresh. Scallops a la plancha: 5/5. Fresh, perfectly seared, tantalisingly tender, each with a morel mushroom poised on top. It's so easy to go wrong with scallops, and this is scallops done so, so right.(At this point, I order a Rive Gauche, a vodka drink with passionfruit and peppercorn - quite sweet, but cut through nicely with the spice from the peppercorn. Wine has also been recommended by the excellent sommelier - it is clear the ""keep away from alcohol"" part of my plan is out.)Fleur de Soleil: 3/5. The cream sauce on this pasta was light, and the vegetables were very fresh,  but overall I thought this was rather bland and unmemorable. Coquilles with veal ragout: 5/5. Large, lush, house-made elbow pasta with chunks of tender, fall-apart-on-your-fork veal. Divine. A small portion, and one that I wanted all to myself.Rotisserie chicken: 5/5. At this point I am digging in with gusto. And well worth it: the chicken, while simple, was moist and flavorful, without being too salty (so many places serve dry, overseasoned roast chicken!). I would not have ordered rotisserie chicken at a place like Lafayette if I were on my own, but this was one of the highlights of the meal.Sides: Broccoli rabe and zucchini. 3/5 each - quite plain and indistinctive. In fact I'd almost forgotten that we had them. Desserts: my, oh my.Peach and almond tart. 3/5. ""Tarte rustique"", aka a galette. Also quite ordinary. I don't remember much about this tart at all, only that I definitely had a piece of it. Maybe that's because at this point I'm just so wined and dined that I was completely zoned out, but that wouldn't explain the following:Eclairs: 5/5. If you're going to claim to be a French patisserie, you'd better do a good pâte à choux. This was it. The plan had obviously been thrown out the window somewhere between the scallops and the veal pasta, so I happily gorged myself on chocolate, pastry and pastry cream. Euphoria-inducing.  Chocolate mousse cake: 5/5. I still dream about this cake. In a valiant attempt to avoid looking like a complete fatty in front of company folk, I cut myself only a small sliver. Then I cut another sliver. Then another. So I ended up looking like a complete fatty anyway because I conspicuously reached over the table for more cake like four more times. Somehow I managed to roll myself home after dinner. I did not look as presentable in my swimsuit as I had hoped. But I regret nothing.",1,2,1,Sharon L.,"Manhattan, NY",13,15,0
3.0,8/2/2013,"At first when I heard there was a bakery inside, I thought, ""how nice could it be""? Well let me tell you, it's a beautiful restaurant with a chic, elegant vibe. And the front of house staff couldn't be nicer, especially Jamie, who tries to accommodate all reasonable requests.  I would give it five stars, but while I've only been twice, the food is a little inconsistent and the service spotty.  Perhaps it's because it's still new.  But the chicken was one of my favorite dishes ever the first time I had it and the second time, it fell short. My friend's steak was well instead of medium, as she requested. So in a short time, things seem a little different in the kitchen. Though, all desserts were spectacular.

5.0,8/1/2013,"5/5 stars for me. Live in the area and have been meaning to try this place since it opened. It really is incredible what Andrew has done to that corner. Great energy now and such a pleasant site. As for the atmosphere, it was incredible. Wait staff all dressed with overalls which was trendy but still professional and clean. We had dinner early, were seated by 6:30pm. We showed up 30 mins ahead of our reservation, but that wasn't a problem. Our waiter Matthew was a 10/10. used to work at Atlantic Grill, have us some background on the place, the menu, his favorites, etc. We loved him and found him uber helpful. On to the food now. Came here with a friend and we started with Spaghetti Niçoise, rare & confit tuna, basil.  It was incredible. We then ordered the Wood-Grilled Local Trout, bean ragoût, orange citronette as one entree and the Duck au Poivre, organic grains, radish, smoked bacon as the second. Both were incredible. I liked the duck more though. For dessert we were joined by my girlfriend which meant three desserts. We had the Sweet Cheese Cremant with pickled blueberry sorbet and cornmeal croutons, the Strawberry Delice with dulcey crémeux, and spiced caramel lace and the Black Forest Flambe. Hands down one of the best desserts I have ever eaten was the Strawberry Delice. It reminded me of the strawberry topping for the waffles at The Dutch but sweeter. Very simple, very fresh, very light. Perfect ending to a great meal. I will undoubtedly be back here to try some more dishes and flavor combinations. All together it was a very enjoyable experience and was not over the top expensive. (3 entree's, 1 bottle of wine, 3 desserts, coffee all under $250) Go here alone, go here with someone close, go here with a stranger, just make a reservation and go here. early or late. GO!

5.0,7/30/2013,"Lafayette is as good as it gets!  The restaurant itself is absolutely gorgeous and we knew from the very start that it was going to be a great meal.  It's a massive restaurant in the old Chinatown Brasserie location, but you'd never recognize it.  Lafayette has exposed brick and a warm, bistro feel and beautifully combines a bar, a bakery and a restaurant into this impressive space.We arrived a little early and decided to wait at the bar.  We loved the young, trendy bar scene and we each had interesting mixed drinks.  I would definitely go back just to grab a few drinks by the bar because I loved the ambiance (the Rive Gauche is not to be missed)!!!This was our first time eating there and we were so overwhelmed because everything on the menu sounded so good!!  Luckily, the waitress was incredibly helpful with our decision making process, which I appreciated, and let us take our time as we read the menu.  We did not feel rushed at all which is something I normally hate about new, trendy places.  Instead, she answered our questions as we chowed down on the delicious homemade bread basket.To start we had oysters and the octopus.  The oysters were fresh and delicious, but I must say - the octopus was the stand out.  Probably the best octopus I've ever had.  It was paired with this delicious smoky eggplant  that we could not get enough of. For our main course we had the roasted chicken and the pasta with tuna.  They always say the test of a great chef is how they make roasted chicken.  Well, if this was a test, the chef got an A++.  The chicken was simple, but cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious.  We also had the pasta with tuna it in which was not what we were expecting, but was really yummy.  It was raw tuna with capers over the pasta, which was nothing like we had ever seen, but somehow it worked.Normally we aren't dessert people, but based on how delicious the meal was, we decided to try the apple tart.  You have to find a partner to share with you becuase this dessert is for two, however, the next time I go back, I might just get it for myself.  Yes - it was that good.I would definitely recommend Lafayette.  I can't wait to go back and even more excited to try the brunch!",1,0,0,Julie S.,"Manhattan, NY",16,5,0

5.0,7/30/2013,"As many of you might know I really have a thing for sweets so I had to check out this new restaurant/bakery. On my first visit, I just went to the bakery to try some of pastry chef and Sweet Genius Jennifer Yee's treats. If you don't get anything else you must try her éclairs.The lemon meringue and chocolate flavors were unique and demonstrative of her mastery of pâté a choux. The dough was perfect and the fillings were not to sweet so the flavor really came through. The soft petite beurre shortbreads are also really delicious as are the almond croissants, which Pete Wells called the best in New York City.The next week I made a dinner reservation and came at the start of dinner around 530. The hostess seated us relatively quickly and our hip waitress was very friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. In fact, all of the staff seemed very well-trained. I was celebrating my birthday so of course I indulged in some wonderful Rosé champagne which tasted great considering the record breaking heat wave going on.For starters we had the grilled octopus and the Brooklyn Grange salad with strawberries. Both were excellent and the grilled octopus made my seafood loving dining companion have a foodgasm. The eggplant sauce is like nothing you've ever had before. The Duck Au Poivre didn't disappoint either. It was super tender and I loved the accompanying vegetables and wild rice.And I definitely highly recommend saving room for dessert. The cherries flambé are elegant and sophisticated.  The table-side presentation will get the whole dining room's attention and you feel really special. The ice cream choux puffs are fabulous as well. But the nectarine saffron tart is really unique and spectacular. So if you have to choose just 2 desserts do cherries flambé and nectarine tart. But definitely you MUST have dessert.

3.0,7/23/2013,"This space is a very pretty and rather large brasserie with lots to look at -- from drooling over the gorgeous pastries in the front bakery to people watching the diners and the good-looking waitstaff.There's a great, great bread basket to start with dense, crusty delicious bread. The food was tasty but in the end, too precious, expensive and fussy for my wallet. But since I wasn't paying, it was a fun night. The food, like the space and the people there -- it's all made to be seen. Not a place I really can live in. Having said that, I still ate every bite, even if the dishes seemed too complicated, too many attempts to pair unexpected ingredients. The least successful dish was the $14 Maine Crab a la Nage appetizer, which was a pile of flaked, bland crabmeat in a plate swimming with sauce. The $8 Duck Mousse Tartine with cherries and walnuts was hearty and rich, piled on two slabs of dark bread and enough for three people to share. The $14 Migliorelli snap peas in a green sauce of avocado was lovely and fresh but hardly worth that price, if you ask me. My $27 trout was beautifully prepared, a nice big fillet over some beans. But again, rather pricey considering it was only half the fish. The biggest disappointment for me was the $22 signature Plum & Almond Tarte Rustique for 2, served with a side bowl of very rich raspberry yogurt sorbet and rosemary honey. Didn't see too many almonds or really taste the rosemary. The plums were super-tart and were arranged in a soggy layer on the tarte shell that was impossible to cut with a fork; I had to resort to pulling it apart with my fingers. One of my friends loved this dessert but it was just too sour and over-hyped for me. On the plus side, this item came cut in four wedges and could definitely serve up to four.

4.0,7/20/2013,"I almost went out on a limb here and awarded them the coveted 5 star rating because I REALLY liked this place and I wanted to up their star quotient but alas, I'm ""yay! I'm a fan"" ing them. We had a 10:00 rese on a Friday night and arrived about 15 minutes early. I love what they did with the decor, huge improvement over the old Chinatown Brasserie, which I couldn't stand. We squeezed our way into the bar area and finagled a stool right away. The crowd is definitely a good mix, more than a few Chelsea boyz which always brightens up a place, packs of older stylish women, some douchey frat boys that should have been in the Hampton's and some couples here and there. The B & T crowd was sparse which mommy likes. The bartender was good but stand offish and takes his job WAY too seriously. I tried to joke around with him but lady please, cocktails are no joking matter. I started with the Rive Gauche, vodka, passion fruit, basil, pink peppercorn and champagne. This was a very interesting drink, the peppercorn gave it a very tart taste almost like a sour grapefruit flavor and I would have enjoyed it much more if it had been colder. We were seated very close to our reservation time, which was great. Our waiter was fabulous, I wish I could remember his name. He was informative, attentive and very personable. The bread they serve you to start was excellent. The menu is just the right mix of choices. We tried the Maine crab a la nage with smoked tomato to start. This was a plate of chilled crab served in almost a very light tomato sauce, excellent on a steamy summer evening. So many of the hors d'oerves sounded good that I decided to order a few of them to make my meal. My date went with the lamb chops and by the way he was gnawing on the bones, I can assume they were great. They looked beautiful. I went with the Migliorelli Farm Snap Peas, sauce verte, ricotta salata. This was a large plate of the freshest snap peas ever. I also couldn't resist the Mediterranean Octopus, charred eggplant, pipéradehe. This was basically one large tentacle that was complimented well by the eggplant. My only slight complaint was that it was just a touch chewy. We had had a few cocktails before we arrived so we decided against a bottle and just ordered the Rose they have by the glass. It was average and again, needed to be a touch colder. I would definitely revisit as I thought the service was spot on, the food was fresh and well presented and the atmosphere was lively and great for groups.

Didn't ask how we were doing and if we may want anything else. The GROSSED OUT PART WAS, He did NOT WIPE / CLEAN  Counter after people were done with their food!!!!!  The next customer that would take a seat , he would just put the menu right on top of the wet glass mark & Crumbs from the meal before!!!  We sat there and saw this happening more then 2 or 3 times.  Waited for a while for the check, so had to ask the girl that was working with him. Overall the Food & Baked Goods are very Good!  But service needs to step it up especially when you can go to so many other great places around.  I'm Born & Raised in this Great City, so it hurts me, to have to be so upset to have the need to write a review like this!",2,2,0,Sonia Francesca D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0
3.0,7/12/2013,"Pros: Food was creative and tasty. Restaurant- gorgeous. Cons: Small portions. Misguided service. I went the very first week it opened. There was an entire row of two-some booths (it was early and the restaurant was mostly empty). After being seated near the busy entrance way, we asked to sit in one of the small booths instead- they were for two people, we were two people. The hostess refused, saying the booth was booked. Highly unlikely that all of the empty booths of the restaurant were booked within a few days of its opening. Not good service.",0,0,0,Eloise A.,"New York, NY",4,125,13
3.0,7/11/2013,"This review is for the bakery only.  As Lafayette is located just a few blocks from my new office, I took advantage and stopped by a few times to pick up breakfast, dessert, and mid-afternoon snacks.  They have some of the typical french pastries (macarons, croissants, eclairs, quiches, etc.), available in traditional and modern flavors (e.g. chocolate eclair vs. lemon meringue eclair; salted caramel macaron vs. birthday cake macaron).Overall their baked treats aren't bad, however execution wasn't perfect.  The pastry dough of the eclair was overcooked, as were the canneles, which tasted a little burnt.  The macaron texture and consistency was a little too crumbly.  However, they all tasted pretty good and looked very nice.",1,1,1,Velina L.,"New York, NY",283,558,9
3.0,7/7/2013,"So hubby was really excited to go here after reading about the Eggs Lafayette (a take on deviled eggs), so we went for brunch today. I generally don't like to review any place based on brunch, but the items that we ordered are also on the dinner menu, and the issues that we had transcend the meal time. First, it's and attractive space with a condescending staff, and they don't have the right to be that way. When I asked the server about a couple of the wines, she said that she would bring over the person who deals with them- she assumed that I wouldn't know what a sommelier is. Duh!!!!  I ordered the pate maison, which was supposed to come with mustard (oh, excuse me, moutarde) and cornichons. When the plate came neither were there. I asked the bus person who delivered the food, but I don't think that he spoke any English. Eventually our server came back and I asked her. She said that she would personally get them for me (as if I was asking for a favor). I waited a while longer (long while, not short while), Eventually a bus person came with a large crock of each and left them on the table. When the server came back I commented on the size of the crocks and she told me that at this restaurant they let me have ""all the moutarde that I want"". Lucky me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It continued on that way, major attitude and lack of training that I wouldn't expect from this type of restaurant. I mean really, would a genuine, heartfelt ""hello"" (or ""bonjour"") have killed them? Not only that but the food was OK. Absolutely not great, with the exception of the breads, and certainly not memorable. The prices are definitely high for food that was ""meh"". if there were half stars I would have given 2 1/2. I gave three stars because I hope that if they read enough of these reviews all saying the same thing they'll fix it. I think that right now Lafayette has great unrealized potential.

1.0,7/2/2013,"If i could give this place 0 stars I would. I pass by this place frequently and It looked so cute. I decided to go there today after work with a friend for coffee and some dessert. We went on a hot day and wanted seating inside. Although there were many tables we were told to sit at bakery or bar if we weren't going to have dinner, ok fine. Finally we got seated at a table outside even though it was humide as hell. We ordered iced lattes and the strawberry delice and the maison profiterol. The coffee was fine. The deserts were so disappointing. First of all, the portions were tiny and came in huge plates. My profiterole was.... NOT a profiterole. It was a puff pastry which was very very hard, my spoon could not cut in half, and there was a ball of chocolate ice cream inside. three little balls of pastry and ice cream lay in a drizzle of chocolate  at the bottom of the huge bowl with cream sprinkled with some nuts. It was so hot and humid that I basically just ate it for the chocolate ice cream but I was hoping that a French patisserie would at least be able to make a proper profiterole.  Ok, the Strawberry delice was some kind of a custard or thick vanilla pudding with fresh strawberries. They pour some strawberry sauce on top of it at the table when they bring it to you. The creamy pudding gets mixed up with the strawberry juice and it looks so muddled and disgusting, not appealing to look at, at all. The pudding tasted like any other vanilla pudding. nothing special. The fresh strawberries, were fresh. Thats all I can say. Server asked us if we wanted to order anything else. We of course said no after that failed attempt. Before we asked for it, the server brought our check to us while we were halfway through our drinks, which I am utterly disgusted by.  It is the worst unwelcoming feeling ever. After that I could not wait to get the hell out of there. Not only was the food so disappointing, the service was just as unacceptable. No place should treat customers like that. Oh and the tab for 2 iced coffees and two failed deserts-- $32. Bottom line overpriced, useless place not worth it at all. Save yourself the trouble and your money and dont be fooled by the look of it. I wish I read more reviews on Yelp before going there.

4.0,6/28/2013,"When a veteran restauranteur like Carmellini opens a behemoth restaurant like Lafayette, eyes turn, mouths open, photographers flash, and reporters put pen to paper. Everyone wants to have an opinion, so I might as well voice mine as well :)Will Lafayette be a surrogate for NYC-establishment down a few blocks, Balthazar? Both have patisseries and fresh bread as focal points, similar price points, massive expanses of dining space... But, no, I don't think so. Tourists will still be tourists, and dine at Balthazar. In these first few months, though, I don't doubt that a heavy flow of traffic will funnel into Lafayette from those who weren't able to secure a table at Balthazar. Luckily, they will be in for a pleasant surprise. The menu at Lafayette is inspired by other cuisines and geography but still grounded in casual French roots. They celebrate more local and seasonal ingredients, like NJ asparagus, local trout, and heirloom zucchini. They also feature entrees that step into the realm beyond ""France"", into Italy and the Mediterranean regions, almost symbolic of how closely knit and influential each of the romance-speaking languages truly are on each country's cuisine.Food was fresh and delicious, and desserts were all heavenly. The only gripe was that the entrees were slightly cold. Egg Lafayette were a clever take on a decadent deviled egg, filled with smoked sablefish blend and topped with red caviar on top in place of traditional paprika. Another standout included the frisee salad with lardon and poached egg- no twist, nothing fancy, just a delicious and a fresh traditional French appetizer. All in all, Lafayette made a pretty good impression; I'm not dying to go back, but I also think it's worthy of more than 'optional' as Pete Wells concluded.",2,0,1,Amy Y.,"Manhattan, NY",94,65,3
5.0,6/25/2013,"After my third trip, it's safe to say that this is one of my new favorites. The food is great and the whole space has a great look and feel. Having only come here for lunch, I sat at the bar each time where the bartender was welcoming and attentive. After trying three different dishes, I have not discovered a standout dish on the menu thus far. Rather, each dish is delicious and well executed. The portions are great, with the rotisserie chicken salad coming with an entire chicken breast, rather than the few sliced strips that most restaurants offer. The tuna nicoise salad is another great choice, with slices of perfectly seared tuna and a light dressing. While not the largest portion, the scallops are excellent, perfectly seared and with great flavor.

4.0,6/20/2013,"Just when we thought the downtown foodie-scene couldn't get any better, leave it to one of the most highly lauded veterans in the biz to prove us wrong. Andrew Carmellini's newest venture is everything we hoped for and much, much more. This grand Gatsby-esque dining room holds court in this prime piece of corner real-estate boasting space for 200 plus, a beautiful Parisian patisserie (that conveniently offers take-out for that perfect picnic addition or late-night sweet treat) a robust wine list, as well as swoon-worthy dinner entrees cooked ever so thoughtfully in the wood-fired oven. The menu itself is a food-lovers dream as diners are encouraged to travel through the shared small plates and snacks (like hyper-curated cheese plates and unctuous foie gras) before venturing into the larger, more rich dishes, highlighting only the most seasonal ingredients and rounded flavor profiles of course. Standouts include the Beef Tartare Cressonniere with poached Bone Marrow, Black Fettuccine with Seafood and Chorizo and the to-die-for Duck Au Poivre. Still hungry? Croissants, tartlets, macarons, oh my!

4.0,6/18/2013,"I came here for a work lunch. First of all, the restaurant is beautiful inside. I just remember it was pouring outside, but I felt like I was transported to a French bistro. To start, we shared the foie gras. I personally don't like the taste, but others in the party wanted to try it. I did enjoy the warm bread that came with it though! For my entree, I got the black pasta with seafood. It was absolutely delicious, and a huge serving! The disappointment of the meal was the dessert. We shared the chocolate cake and the profiteroles. The pastry-part of the profiteroles were unexpectedly hard and cookie-like. The chocolate cake was too heavy and I was not a fan of the ginger ice cream.Overall, the service and over-all ambiance was great -- not sure what the dinner crowd is like, but the crowd at lunch was a mix between rich housewives and business folk like myself.

We ended up splitting the butter lettuce salad with roquefort and ham, which was absolutely fantastic! The salad might benefit from something crunchier like endive, but it was fab. We also split the spaghetti with raw tuna and the fleur de soleil with snap peas, pancetta and mint. Both were really good, though the pea dish was better.

5.0,6/6/2013,"No idea where the bad reviews come from. Last minute we said let's go here and see if we can get a seat at the bar. LONG shot since it was just reviewed nicely in NY Mag. They led us right to a little back wall in front of the rotisserie chickens, where the smell of garlic and butter wafted over onto us. Very pleasant indeed. It was a bit cramped as the waiters' station was right behind me and got bumped a lot, but I was still amazed at the fact that we walked right in and got seated! Great design, decor, lighting and noise level, which is what usually bugs me about a restaurant. We could hear each other! Split the butter lettuce salad, easily for 2. Roquefort, thinnest cucumber and radish I'd ever seen and gorgeous thin-sliced ham, all sprinkled with some sort of crunchy buttery bread crumb thingie. Delish. And the bread was fab. You know the food's good when the bread's good. Hubs had the bass in bouillabaisse and I had pasta with peas and pancetta. Both dished totally incredible and could not leave a morsel of the pasta over, even though I tried. Way too full for dessert but they sounded great. Instead opted for a to-go dessert-- a pistachio raspberry macaroon which was suggested to us. Didn't love it, very sweet. The husband liked it, but he's not hard to please when it comes to dessert. We got a danish and blueberry muffins to go for tomorrow morning and I'm already waiting. We will definitely come back. If I had to complain about anything, it was the short pours on the wine.

2.0,6/5/2013,"My experience at Lafayette was very disappointing, likely an effect of having high expectations from Andrew Carmellini's previous standout restaurants!  If I went in unknowing of past accomplishments, it would have been just another mediocre meal; one to forget and move on with.  Rather, my meal left me disappointed, akin to seeing Carmelo Anthony play expecting an All-Star performance, and getting a 2 for 11 shooting night.The wait for a walk in was a little longer than quoted - 1:15 rather than 45 min, but ok, that happens, especially with a buzzy new restaurant.  However, there was no attempt to deliver exceptional hospitality here, as the hosts apologized here and there, but never went as far as perhaps buying a round of drinks on the house, which other establishments know is good practice to build good will for potential regulars.  It's fine for an average restaurant to overlook this, but I don't think this place wants to be an average restaurant, particularly at these prices.The BIG problem though, was just the incredibly lackluster food!  I ordered a tasty Duck Tartine for an appetizer, which had a combination of cranberries and walnuts that reminded me of Thanksgiving like the dish was a really intense stuffing.  Yet, despite the good start, spreads made from the inner bits of animals are usually flavorful, so this simply met expectations.Going around the table of mains - Spaghetti Nicoise was watery and bland, as if the kitchen didn't intensify the pasta in a pan with the sauce.  The raw tuna also just didn't work - little bits mixed into the spaghetti that disappeared into the blandness of the dish rather than absorb any flavors.Wild Black Sea Bass - again, was just a bit too delicate, venturing into health food territory.  The fish itself was nice quality, but please throw in a bit of merguez or something into the sauce to actually inspire the taste buds to work!Black Fettuccine - contrasting to the Spaghetti, which was too wet, this dish was simply too dry.  The squid ink pasta didn't have enough moisture to ensure the strands didn't stick together as evidenced by the lack of any sauce to ""sop up"" with a piece of crusty bread.  The seafood within the dish was all pretty terrible - overcooked clams and chewy squid.  Rather than a poached preparation, they should have been sautéed  the calamari to add a bit of browning, and include some tentacle pieces rather than all body chunks to provide texture.  If they think people don't like tentacle pieces, please challenge the diner rather than serve uninspired food.  It was so tedious, I honestly didn't even finish my dish.Frites - not good.  Over-fried, under-seasoned, and cut in a way that there weren't enough long strands.  This should be a crowd pleaser, not just another item going through the motions.The restaurant has the feel of a place that can't sustain its crowds because of the food quality and would normally have a finite life span.  However, its timing is fortunate because the neighborhood has a bunch of new luxury apartments being constructed, so there is a built in local crowd.  Beyond that though, I'm doubtful of it's worth as destination dining.Thank god for the great company that didn't get too perturbed by the meal and still enjoyed each other despite it!",3,0,1,Christopher D.,"New York, NY",47,50,1

1.0,6/4/2013,"This was the worst dining service I've experienced in New York in 8 years.  Admittedly the food and the hostesses did a great job - which is why I gave this place one star. Food was good presumably because Andrew Carmellini was actually present the night we went, given the reviews I've seen.  We went on May 28, the Tuesday after Memorial day, at 9:35pm. - Drink service took a long time, even when standing at the bar. I'm not sure why a negroni, two glasses of wine THE SERVERS POUR AT THE TABLE, and a champagne cocktail would take so long, but they did. The second round we ordered took a long time as well, and weirdly, not all drinks were delivered at the same time.  We had a sazerac and wine pours show up BEFORE a gin and tonic, but aren't there only 4 ingredients in a gin & tonic (if you count the garnish)?  It's weird the bartender would only finish part of a ticket order...- Appetizers came out quickly, and were delicious. We had Eggs Lafayette, the beet salad, and the duck tartines. I particularly liked the tartines.- Busboys came to clear some dishes he saw were empty.  I don't generally have a problem with this, but if someone else is eating, don't reach over them and try to grab utensils that are under their elbow.  It's weird. And potentially very messy. **WE THEN WAITED AN HOUR FOR OUR ENTREES. We realized while waiting for about 35 minutes that our entrees had not arrived.  As the lightng in the dining room had at this moment dimmed, we joked that the kitchen had maybe closed (the website says it closes at 11pm, and it was definitely after 11pm).  One of my friends then looked for and stared at our server who upon noticing his glances, scurried into the kitchen.  After this she came back to our table and asked if we wanted more drinks, to which we replied, no thank you, we really wanted our entrees.  I asked her what was going on and she told us there was a glitch in the computers and the printer where the order she put in didn't print our food tickets, so she had to go talk to the chef and prove that she had put the order in.  She then offered to comp one round of drinks.  I liked this server, I really don't think she had a hand in making the evening's service so awful.  The only complaint I had about her was...- She didn't tell us she was transferring us to a closing server. Who was THE WORST. This guy came by and didn't introduce himself after our plates were cleared.  He asked us in a quiet voice if we wanted anything else and then pranced away, not appearing again for AT LEAST ANOTHER 10 minutes at which point we had our wallets out.  I don't know if this Asian man with a ponytail didn't see this detail, but he threw dessert menus at us and before we were able to say ""Oh, no, just the check please,"" he scurried off.  We then waited another excruciating 15 minutes. Was he smoking?  Was he eating?  No - my friend spotted him at a serving station DRINKING WINE so we all stared at him and waved our arms until he came back and said, ""So, dessert?""  - While we were waiting for our server to run our card, my friend grabbed his leather bag and screamed, ""WHY IS THIS WET?!""  We had been sitting behind the ice bath for wine, and apparently the servers that were pilfering this wine (as it was closing time) were grabbing bottles, but not wiping them down so a ton of water had gathered below us.  When our server came back, we showed him the pool of water and the bag, and instead of grabbing a towel or a manager (there were at least 2 men in nice suits on the floor), he just looked at us. When he realized nothing was happening, he asked if any water was inside of the bag,  We replied that we didn't think there was, and then he kept staring.  We left at about 15 minutes after midnight - we only had 2 courses...  Our server may still be in the same spot..- Actually no, as we stood outside saying our goodbyes and recounting how terrible our experience was, we saw him continue to drink with 3 other servers at the server station.  I don't mind if you drink while working as long as you're coherent and maintain capability.  In this case, neither of those basic expectations of a server were met.  I will say the bakery looked very good.  I love the Library at the Public and Locanda.  I hope this place improves but I will never know as I plan on never returning..",2,2,1,Naomi B.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

2.0,6/2/2013,"Usually wait till after 2+ experiences to post a review, but can't say I'll be coming back unless someone with a lot of money asks where I'd like to be take for a ""just okay meal.""  Last week I paid $9 for one egg here.  One egg.  Split i half.  I kind of smile/frowned, then ate it, then forgot 10 seconds later since it was not memorable.  Everything is fine, duck terrine was probably the best bite I had and it was just that, a bite.  Portions are small, someone with more time on their hands needs to do a cost-per-bite analysis.  Or cost per sip.  They charge tax on the drinks at the bar, so $14 cocktail is $15.19 - this kills me, just make the drink $15 or $16 - am I supposed to collect my change?But I digress, I am very much okay with paying these prices for a great experience and great food, or even only one of the two.  The food is not special, it is The Dutch redux, and the experience is lacking.  Somehow when this cacophonous, monstrous space was Chinatown Brasserie, it seemed fun.  Now it seems like a suburban mall chainlet has descended upon NoHo.  For all the square footage, the tables are so crowded together.  It was so packed that our waiter decided to ""kill two birds with one stone"" (his words) and read the specials to my table as well as the adjacent one at the same time.  Classy.  Also he could not be bothered with answering questions about any ingredient name translations, as the menu feels the need to read like a francophile pocket dictionary.  Thankfully had great company, but overall that smile/frown feeling was so pervasive.",1,2,1,Talia R.,"New York, NY",49,510,0
2.0,6/2/2013,"Come here if you feel like spending a lot of money to FEEL hip but really NOT be hip because you're eating so-so food.The rotisserie chicken is a joke. We had a 35 minute wait on a Wed night, sans reservation. No problem, we waited near the back corner of the bar (great cocktails by the way - love their spin on French classics) by the kitchen doors with a clear view of the rotisserie. We saw a man bring out a spit of chickens and put them in. Cool. 5 minutes later he removed the same spit and brought it back into the kitchen.Someone correct me if I'm wrong. But if I'm right...WHAT???? They cook chickens in the rotisserie for 5 minutes (instead of two hours), cook the rest in the oven, and have the nerve to call it rotisserie chicken? And charge $22 per person?? Lol right? Needless to say, we ordered something else.Duck Mousse Tartine with cherries and walnuts ($8)This was by far the best part of our meal. It was super intense and flavorful. I would loooove to have this for lunch all the timeDry-Aged Strip Steak Frites ($32)I basically paid 30 dollars to eat a hunk of bearnaise, because the sauce was so unforgivably overpowering that I barely tasted steak at all. Bad.Scallops a la Plancha ($29)Scallops were whatever, good but not revelatory. I had much better scallops recently at Tinto in Philly. My boyfriend doesn't have a ravenous appetite like I do, but he looked so sad when he got his tiny plate of scallops, no carb and just a few veggies next to my towering pile of steak frites. I know scallops are scallops and aren't served by the dozen, but a man has to eat something. Would have been fine as a small plate, not an entree. Certainly not a $30 entree.I came here for a special occasion dinner that left me SUPER disappointed and with a burning hole in my wallet :( I'll never go back.",3,2,1,Chrissy C.,"New Brunswick, NJ",20,19,0
5.0,5/30/2013,"Lafayette is definitely a wonderful addition to the NYC dining scene. I love the fact that you can go there at any time of the day for a meal- brunch, lunch, or dinner and of course they have a nice little bakery full of great pastries.My initial encounter was at the bakery. There is a very nice selection and the staff was very nice when I asked questions about what each was, since there are no signs explaining what they are. I sampled the almond croissant, pistachio match macaroon, birthday cake macaroon, cherry frangipane tart, strawberry and cream on meringue, and the raspberry pistachio tart. All were delicious, but the almond croissant which disappointed me. I found it to be a bit too crusty and dry. They are a little pricy, but hey that is what you get in NYC when dealing with a new hot spot from a well known chef.For dinner, I also had a superb experience. For starters, the restaurant is massive and really beautiful. I've never been to France but this is how I imagine their bistros to look. The staff and servers were very attentive and friendly. And the food was great.I had the following:Soft shell crab with zucchini and bag sauce. This was a perfectly battered and fried soft shell, just large enough for an appetizer with some shaved zucchini ribbons on top. The sauce was a tomatoy pepper like red sauce that has a nice zing. I liked this a lot.Second course was the coquilles with veal ragout and brebis. The coquilles were a perfectly cooked al dente pasta which  means ""shell"". The brebis is a cheese similar to goat cheese. There was copious amounts of braised veal throughout, however I did not detect the slightest bit of brebis in there. I had to ask for more grated cheese in fact. Still, a good dish but not sure I would sheel out $23 again for a ""mid course"". My opinion is places should always offer a half portion of pasta for those who want it was a course instead of an entree.Finally, the best dish I have had in quite some time. The lamb chops maroccaine. This dish was really incredible. The two large lamb chops were perfectly cooked rare and had a nice spice to them. But the real treat was the whole wheat couscous it was sitting on top of. Laced throughout were tender, succulent shreds of pulled lamb and some beautfiul carrots. The portion size is huge and the amount of lamb they worked into the cous cous was equivalent to a heaping pule of pulled pork you would find at a BBQ place. A side of potatoes puree was added for good measure, and again was done very well. Buttery, smooth, and decadent.A really great new spot that is worthy of the praise. I liked The Dutch, liked Locanda Verde but didn't think they were as great as the hype. But Lafayette is for sure.",0,0,0,G C.,"New York, NY",21,264,798
3.0,5/30/2013,"We had a reservation for dinner and got cold feet because of so many tepid reviews, so we thought we would let a little more time elapse between the opening and when we come to eat a full meal. So, in the meantime, i've been to the bakery here a few times.  The baguette was pretty tasty by NYC standards-- nothing like Paris but better than most you can get around the city.  The eclairs (we got coffee and chocolate) were just ok for me.  The sweetness was a bit subtle, and I can respect not kowtowing to sugar-loving Americans' desire for over the top sweetness, but the eclairs were just a bit bitter and left me unsatisfied.  The macarons were ok.  We skipped the silly flavors (bubblegum?) and the hands-down favorite was the signature white and blue ""Lafayette.""  It was quite good and reminiscent of  Ladurée.  I will be back again as I want to support Carmellini and this is a big space to keep filled.",1,0,0,Jason N.,"New York, NY",307,671,1117
5.0,5/28/2013,"Still very full after taking advantage of the city being empty for Memorial Day weekend and feasting at Carbone the night before, I took the opportunity to score a table at the other current hot spot of the moment that it's impossible to get into, Lafayette.Even booking a few weeks in advance, and on a Monday night, the only spot I could find for a table for two other than 10:30 PM or later was at 6 PM. I jumped at the chance since I can't stop reading rave reviews and hype about this place.I am glad I sucked it up and came here even though I was already too full, because it was worth every bite. I don't understand how there could possibly be poor reviews for this place - the service, ambience and food were all perfect.On the way in, we couldn't help but get distracted by the glorious bakery toward the right of the entrance. We confirmed with them that the bakery is open all day until the restaurant closes, so we made it a point to come by for a second dessert once we finished our meal to try to some of the great-looking stuff they have.The space itself is really nice, and like everyone points out, is very ""sceny"", which I guess means that it is very trendy and is one of those see and be seen type spots. We got a really nice table, with a bench seat that was super comfortable and made me feel like a king while I ate.From the start, even the complimentary bread is outstanding. It's got a nice crust with a very very chewy, dense interior. We quickly ate it all and got some more. We then proceeded with our unnecessarily large feast:- Duck Mousse Tartine with cherries and walnuts ($8)This starter was amazing. Served on some more delicious crusty bread, the sweet cherries and crunchy walnuts went perfectly with the duck mousse.- Broccoli Rabe ($8)I figured we should eat some vegetables with all this beige. This was nice and garlicky and delicious.- Spaghetti Nicoise with rare tuna ($23)This was a delicious pasta with tons of capers and tuna. Nice and salty and really good.- Coquilles with Veal Ragout ($23)Another very generous portion of pasta, the veal sauce accompanying this was awesome.- Dry-Aged Strip Steak Frites ($32)Really delicious steak and even better fries. Again, even though the items here are pricy, the portions are all very generous and well worth it.- Apple Tarte Fine Pour 2 with Creme Fraiche ($19)Already full, this really put me over the edge, but it was so good. This might not be for everyone, but if you love the taste of pure butter, you will enjoy this immensely. It was really just apples, butter and some of that great creme fraiche to top it off. So overwhelmingly good.Thoroughly satisfied with the amazing food and perfect service, we still had to try some of that bakery stuff we saw on the way in. I got a bunch of macarons ($2.50), including the excellent Birthday Cake one, and the Chocolate Chip Cookie ($3.50), which was one of the best I've had. We took these to go for the walk home, happily huffing for breath the whole way.This place is amazing and I hope to return once the hype dies down and it gets a bit easier to snag a normal reservation time. Until then though, I'll definitely at least be frequenting the bakery.",12,3,10,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834

They then waited another 15 min to fill our waters. Our waitress finally came over to take our orders. I ordered a drink and we ordered our meal. The cheese plate was great but came with 3 small pieces of bread. Not enough for 3 servings of cheese! We asked forMore and it came out... Eventually. The worst part was that I never got my drink. When the main came I asked where it was. The waitress apologized then cameBack and said they were making a new one. When we were finished eating it still didn't come. I saw out waitress tell the manager but he could care less. The food was great but the experience was horrible.

2.0,5/22/2013,"Andrew Carmellini's lot is too cool for me. I can't ever get a table until 10PM; I'm always wearing the worst shoes in the entire establishment; and I haven't mastered the art of appearing like you're eating when you're actually not - which is essential for dining successfully at Lafayette, because everyone in there looks like they split their time between the gym, and Fashion and Finance mixers. That's not to say I hated the food - the food (particularly the crab tartine and the lamb chops) was ""fine"". But like (no wait, EXACTLY like) its predecessor, the Dutch, Lafayette is such. a. scene. that the $80+ that I spent on an unexceptional dinner and a drink should guarantee an appropriately hot-mess celebrity sighting, no?

Avoid the entire by-the-glass wine list, one which my party of four couldn't find a single serviceable selection despite prices reaching to nearly $20 a glass.

5.0,5/16/2013,"You know you are eating great french food when you're using bread to mop up the remaining sauce. I have been to Lafayette a few times now and I can't say anything bad about this place. Bad reviews are for the bakery and not the restaurant. Quite unfair in my opinion to rate the bakery when the restaurant is the actual thing that needs rating. Squeezed in for dinner on a Saturday night recently and had an amazing meal! First off: The bread at Lafayette is very very good. The stars of the show at Lafayette are the Tripe and Black Linguini. If you have never had Tripe before or think it's gross you will be pleasantly surprised, dish is crack!  Carmellinni does Tripe very well at his other restys as well. Not to be missed is the beef tartar, by far the lightest tartar I've ever had. The lunch during the week has been solid as well. The bar has good service via the bartender and you can get full on a starter and main. Notable dishes are the butter lettuce salad, soups, and even the dumbed down version of the black linguini. I tried the pasta with panchetta and peas and I liked it. They also do fresh juices that are quite good. Notable dessert would be the doughnuts with passion fruit dipping sauce.

3.0,5/16/2013,"This review is for their bakery only, which is right in the front of the restaurant and to the right as you walk in. It's a beautiful set-up, to be sure. I love the display. I've sampled a variety of their pastries, but the thing that I keep coming back for is their chocolate chip cookie, which could, if discovered by the right local news outlet, become one of the city's new best. It's not-too-sweet, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, and salted just right. It's a second cousin to the Jacques Torres chocolate chip cookie in some ways. I like it. They should feature them more prominently, even though the restaurant is gearing itself to be French. And on that note: if that's the case, then they'll need to work harder on their croissants, which are meh when compared alongside NYC's best. They are lacking a real buttery flavor (try upping salt?), they don't crunch when bit into. Maybe some time in the oven would freshen them up at home, but I shouldn't have to do that...Also, there's a funny smell in the area around the bakery. I can't put my nose on what it might be, but it should be solved! It ain't pretty. Definitely get your cookie to go. ;-)",2,1,1,Nathan N.,"Brooklyn, NY",153,139,398

Even the chopped egg with it was strangely tasteless. The Boston lettuce salad was very nice but did not need ham on it. The dressing was good. The appetizer potions were large.My black pasta was just black. A little overlooked with no taste of the sea.

3.0,5/11/2013,"So far, I have been unimpressed by all of Carmellini's restaurants, and this one does not fare any better. Lafayette is perhaps the most hyped up opening of 2013 (and yes, for the remainder of 2013 too), but given the crowded (and very cramped) bar area and the hard to get reservations (other than the 10pm+ ones), this restaurant is reinvigorating this location to the max where many other restaurants have failed. The food at Carmellini's restaurants has always been pretty mediocre at best with one or two dishes that tend to be outstanding although I still haven't figured out which dish warrants such praise here, but the scene attracts fashionable 20s to 40s people with the exception of a few 50s+. I think the idea here is to do as the models do - skip the food and just order coffee, since skinny tastes best.  Le Food:Egg Lafayette with caviar - okCrab tartine - ok but a little on the wet side (the bread is about to cave in) Steak tartare with quail egg and toast - mehBlack tagliatelle with squid and clams - pasta was a bit overcooked for me and it was lacking in seafood so it was overall a mediocre dishLamb chops with cumin and cous cous - lamb was not gamey and decently cooked but when does lamb ever taste bad?Mango with coconut and sorbet - decent I also tasted a bunch of the macarons at the bakery in the front. They weren't executed well, but the fillings were decent. Some of the macaron cookies had huge holes in the middle from what I suspect is being caused by too light of a touch in squeezing out the batter (aka improper batter squeezing form).",2,4,1,Bo B.,"New York, NY",490,984,753

We were directed to a table of two. The design of this place plus the uniforms of the server/runners brings you back to the 80's in France. Our server was very friendly. After fabricating the menu (both my friend and I are cooks), we decided to order the butter lettuce with ham and herb vinaigrette,  the Mediterranean octopus, the duck, and bouillabaisse. The lettuce salad was great. The portion may look large, but it is a salad after all. The blue cheese, ham and herb vinaigrette was a perfect combination. Very refreshing. As for the octopus, the presentation was great. The octopus itself was tender. But it was not crunchy at all. Some pieces had the char flavor, would have been nice if all of them had a little charness to it. The smokey eggplant did give it a touch more flavor though. The duck was amazing. The confit kumquat with the duck was just an incredible combination. Very elegant presentation. I would definitely order this dish again!The way our server described it, the bouillabaisse sounded incredible. This dish had the option of servings for 2 or for 1. The price listed for it was M/P (market price), it was $75 for solo serving. It contained a few mussels, little neck clams, langoustine, half of a lobster tail, around 2 ounce of monk fish and about 2 ounces of a flaky fish. A garlic Bearnaise with some croutons were also served on the side. I was a bit disappointed with this dish (lover of bouillabaisse). I believe shrimp stock was the base of this broth. It was very strong. All I taste was basil, fennel and shrimp. And also, it was pureed. Pureed bouillabaisse makes it even heavier. I would have loved it so much more if it was just the broth... the garlic bearnaise was extremely heavy as well. The desserts were great. I had the burnt honey vacherin with apricot and mint. The mint and apricot was very refreshing. Great choice for dessert after a big meal. My friend had the swiss cheese cremant with blueberry sorbet and cornmeal croutons. Super creamy. The blueberry sorbet was extremely fresh.Overall we had a good experience. I will definitely come back once the restaurant has stabilized down (opened for about 2 weeks only). I give it 3.5 stars, round to 4.",4,0,1,Jason L.,"Brooklyn, NY",149,52,20
5.0,4/26/2013,I never went to Chinatown Brassiere which this place replaced but have been to both Tribeca Grill and Locanda Verde which share some of the same owners and chefs.  This place is huge as their are four distinct areas. You walk into small bakery area but your eyes will wander to the huge two story main dining area.  If you are looking for the bar go straight past the hostess and then take a right and you will see a see through clock.  Downstairs is a more rustic room with another bar and seating for a hundred more people.  We ate in the main dining room and I happily sank into the leather seat.The service was very good as our waiter was a true professional as he had worked at many restaurants in the city including managing a couple of them.  You come to a restaurant for the food and the only problem with this place might be figuring out what to eat and trying to save room for dessert.  We started out with the foie gras terrine and the crab tartine.   The crab was piled on and tasted amazingly fresh.   The terrine was served with warm brioche.   I could have also stuffed myself with the yummy corncihon that came in a cute le creuset pot.   The only reason I thought about giving this place a four star instead of the five was the main entrees were just above average as the chorizo in my squid ink fettucine was chopped so finely that I had trouble tasting it as would have preferred bite sized pieces.   The rabbit dish though well cooked was a little off balanced with the sauce.  If you like french food and wine this is the place. All the wines are from France and have choices from the 40's to well above that.   I usually come to Butter when down in this area but this place will keep my business as long as they keep the quality up.  Next time I might skip the french market item and save room for the delicious sounding desserts.,6,0,1,Bryan C.,"Hoboken, NJ",179,395,788
4.0,4/25/2013,"Andrew Carmellini has done it again. Adding to his already impressive arsenal of a great Italian (Locanda Verde) and American restaurant (The Dutch) - this French brasserie completes his culinary map. It's like the holy trinity, basically. I visited for dinner during the first weekend of grand opening. I was immediately a little awestruck by how grand and embellished the dining room looked, I literally felt like I was transported to a brasserie in France. While the boulangerie in the front of the restaurant is cute and casual, the dining room itself actually feels pretty formal. Certainly more formal than his aforementioned restaurants. I suppose that comes with the whole ""French"" territory. While the staff here look the part - what with all the women in LBDs and pearls and men in suit vests - I couldn't help but feel that everyone lacked organization, knowledge and experience. I'm sure they deserve the benefit of the doubt, as every new restaurant and its staff need a little time to smooth out the kinks. The food alone certainly warrants many return trips.Now on to the food - Duck mousse tartine, cherries, walnuts - listed under ""French Market"" portion at the top of the dinner menu. This little two-bite snack truly exemplified brasserie-cooking. I loved the whipped duck liver mousse balanced by the sweet balsamic cherries, with a toasted tartine acting as the perfect vehicle for all that flavor.Grilled Mediterranean Octopus, smoky eggplant, pipérade - this dish tasted a little more Mediterranean and less French to me, mainly due to the pureed eggplant and garniture of mixed peppers. I really enjoyed the different flavors and brightness from some type of herbed oil drizzled around the plate, although I would have appreciated a little more char on the octopus.Steak frites, béarnaise butter - the bf loved his perfectly medium rare steak that was sliced thick and generously basted in the béarnaise butter. What really elevated the steak was the different herbs in the accompanying sauce, which was complex but a little reminiscent of herb de provence. He opted to substitute the traditional frites for the creamy and buttery pommes puree, although he vowed to come back for the traditional frites.Sprouted broccoli, tomato, lemon - this side dish of what turned out to be roasted broccolini was a nice choice and surprisingly zesty from the generous tapenade-like mixture of tomato and lemon zest sprinkled throughout. Toasted breadcrumbs added balance, although I'm not sure this is a must-order with so many other great sounding things on the menu.Desserts at Lafayette are just okay, definitely not as impressive as their savory dishes. The bf's chocolate almond torte was basically a very light warm chocolate cake with ginger ice cream and caramel. The mango coupe I ordered was a small sundae of coconut and lime sorbet topped with slightly roasted mango and coconut flakes. I liked the slightly savory combination of basil and roasted fruit, but I'm not sure I'd order it again except for on a sweltering summer day.Lafayette has an nice wine list, as you'd expect from a French brasserie of its size. The beverage program at all of Carmellini's restaurants are stellar, so I would definitely drop in just for a few glasses of wine and small bites. The 2011 Domaine de la Citadelle Luberon from Rhone we had was particularly easy-drinking and earthy, just how I like my French syrah. I may advise consulting with the sommelier, as the waitstaff don't seem very well-versed in their wine list, yet.I'm pretty surprised that Lafayette has yet to be very well-received on this site - although its reservation books are filled to the brim and critical acclaim have been overall positive. I'd definitely suggest visiting for a proper meal (they're supposed to launch lunch and brunch soon) before you rule Lafayette out. Especially if you're a fan of Carmellini like I am.",5,1,1,Cecilia Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,644,43
3.0,4/24/2013,"I went with my girls for an afternoon tea. Everything is really cute and excellent. It is a little pricey, disorganised and smells like fresh paint though... So I'm waiting a little for them to get organized before trying their brunch.",1,0,0,Brigitte V.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,66,16
1.0,4/20/2013,"My friend and I went there for desserts today. Since we did not have much time to stay, we decided to take out. When we asked the girl in the counter what flavor is the cake, she had a bad attitude. Her face made me feel like I asked a stupid question. After paying $12 for two small cakes, she put my cake in a box and just leave it on the counter. I asked for a bag and she just gave it to me without putting my cakes in it. The situation for my friend was worse! She ordered the passion fruit cake which had passion fruit seed and juice on the cake. The girl who was handling her order just put the box ""straight"" in the bag. That made the passion fruit juice were leaking all over the box. I will not go to this place anymore!!!",6,6,4,Michelle C.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",8,5,1
2.0,4/19/2013,"Big fan of The Dutch and Locanda Verde here. Brand new restaurant so with that caveat this was a disappointing experience. Service was gracious and sweet but frequently absent. Bartender was asked for champagne options and offered rose. The rose ""champagne"" was actually cremant. When I asked if my drink was actually champagne was told ""technically"" its not, its cremant. At a restaurant like this I expect the staff to know champagne from cremant. The appetizers were tasty but nothing special. chicken for 2 was reasonably well executed but bland and boring. nothing was great. bottom line underseasoned and lacking anything unique sorry for lack of detail here but just an uninspired meal. they need to do better. gorgeous room and pretty crowd so a fun night out but not for a serious food lover.",6,2,2,Robert R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0
4.0,4/19/2013,"Started w/ Kusshi Oysters.  Excellent!  The two dozen of them were uniform in size and the ones I devoured fresh, creamy cold perfection.  Roasted Beets are a must. Order anything on the menu wood-fired (had the Dorade and the Seasonal Veggies, delicious.)  There are bones to be picked with their meat dishes (Berkshire pork was a shade bit overdone, the steak may need to be cut in a more uniform size cuz some bites were perfect medium and others overfired.  Kinks need workout but overall very tasty eats.  The francophile wine list had some excellent Burgundy jems that were reasonably marked up but i did notice some lesser bottles marked up 3-4x retail, bottles that are readily available at your local wine shop.  This is a particular pet peeve of mine and i wish they'd be a bit smarter about that. The spacious and beautiful art-deco ambiance with a sense of downtown cool is unrivaled in Manhattan. It's definitely worth a special trip.",2,0,1,Jay K.,"New York, NY",24,66,47
3.0,4/18/2013,"this review is for the bakery only.the newly opened restaurant is enormous. however, i only went for its bakery in the front, wherethere were towers of croissants, muffins, pound cakes, etc...and a display stand with pastries and macarons.i liked the set-up of all the baked goods, but i had a hardtime asking the employee every item that caught my eye becausemost of the pastries did not have any name or description tags.even the baked goods, although their tags had names and prices,had no description of the ingredients inside them.nevertheless, the employees were very friendly to inform the customers.the sit-in area is quite small compared to the rest of the restaurant,which could have been made more spacious for quick stop visiting or sitting customers of the bakery that is open daily since early morning.as for their goodies, i got the chocolate banana coconut croissant $3-3.50(which did not have a tag), which immediately enticed my appetite,but failed to satisfy it. it was not bad, but it was not great either.the chocolate, banana, and coconut flavors were all there but the bread holding them all together was not really working for me.the layers were a bit soggy and not light enough.however i enjoyed the flaky top exterior of the croissant, sprinkled with almond slices and powdered sugar.each madeleine is $1.50, which could have been better if they werenot coated with a sweet glaze. i would have had a better timeenjoying the lemony and buttery taste of the 'naked' petite cake. they had several macaron flavors: salted caramel, birthday cake,chocolate, lafayette (chocolate and bergamot buttercream), strawberry and bubblegum, and pistachio matcha. lafayette's macarons had very bright, almost neon colors to them.i got the lafayette because it must be good if it holds the restaurant's name.the shell was firm yet fragile and the buttercream had a good 'chewy' consistency when bit and melted away. its location and size will probably attract many customers,but i don't think i would return any time soon to their bakery to satisfy my cravings for savory and sweet goodies",11,8,8,Elle L.,"New York, NY",178,155,2037
3.0,4/17/2013,"There's been a lot of hype surrounding the opening of Andrew Carmellini's new French restaurant Lafayette. The long wait is finally over, as Lafayette officially opened for dinner service this week. I dropped by for a meal last night to see whether the restaurant lived up to all the massive hype.The food here is good, and I would definitely come back for another visit. But I wouldn't rate my meal a 9 out of a 10, it was more like a 7+. Everything was well executed, but the flavors weren't perfect. To give Carmellini credit, his style of cooking is certainly very distinctive, and if you had to pick out a Lafayette steak frites out of a line up, you definitely could. I just wish originality and taste could have been a little more balanced. There was no showstopper dish like the meatballs at A Voce or the ricotta at Locanda Verde to nudge the rating up to an 8 or 9.While the cuisine at Lafayette is mostly French, hints of Spanish, Italian and American influences also make their way on the menu. My personal favorite was the linguine noir with seafood and chorizo. The grilled Mediterranean octopus appetizer was less successful. I wish the octopus were crispier, and I thought the flavors weren't very sharp. The most classically French dish we tried was the steak frites. The steak had a lot of potential, but some parts were overcooked, and the herbs in the bernaise sauce were a little intense. The fries were fantastic though. The side of broccoli that we ordered was very underwhelming and irrelevant to the meal. A neighboring table ordered a duck au poivre, which looked delicious, as well as a wood-fired dorade, which they graded a C-.For dessert, we decided to grab a few treats from Lafayette's in-house bakery.We decided upon the butterscotch eclair and the birthday cake macaron. The desserts had unique, refined flavors and were visually stunning, but I wouldn't go back for seconds.The space inside Lafayette is beautiful and massive, and you certainly feel as if you've been transported to a gorgeous, modern-day Parisian brasserie. The diners are as beautiful as the surroundings, enhancing the elegant aesthetic with their vibrant presence. Lafayette's stock is a clear buy, although I personally think it's a bit overvalued and will wait for the hype to die down before getting back in.",8,0,3,Sherry J.,"Manhattan, NY",82,35,23
