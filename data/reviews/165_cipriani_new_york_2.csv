5.0,2/4/2019,First time there and very much liked lunch. We don't like the uptown branch so were surprised. Restaurant is comfortable and light. No problem with noise. Food is terrific.

1.0,1/1/2019,"We came here for New Years and had booked the most expensive VIP experience/table they had. We spent A LOT, and I mean A LOT, thousands of dollars to be able to have a memorable New Year's Eve experience. We flew all the way from Europe for this night. When we arrived, we had to give the doorman $200 TO LET US IN as the VIP line was even bigger than the general admission line. When we went inside, everything went really slow and by the time we were done with coatcheck, we were escorted to our table. Only then to find out that OTHER PEOPLE WERE SEATED AT OUR TABLE. We then had to wait and wait and wait (it was 11.30 by now CRAZY STRESSFUL), then they proceeded to give us a table at a general admission area, we refused because WE PAID FOR THE VIP AREA. What they had done was, they gave our table away to people that bribed them with cash. Eventually they put up another table NEXT to the VIP area, in the middle of the hallway pretty much. We had no other choice but to accept it or leave, so we sat down but because it was in the middle of the general dance floor, every drunk person started putting cups and empty glasses on our PRIVATE TABLE. Then they started picking at our food ON OUR PRIVATE TABLE. As the night went on, drunk people started hanging their coats ON OUR PRIVATE TABLE. Sitting down, ON OUR PRIVATE SEATS. All of this didn't happen to the people that they gave our initial table to because they were in a secluded VIP area where we supposed to be.We travel all over the world. Our family and friends will never, ever visit ANY Cipriani restaurant or venue again. We will stop hosting our charity events at Cipriani venues and discourage anyone to go there if they ask us. Thank you for ruining our New Year's eve, Cipriani.",5,2,0,K T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0
5.0,12/2/2018,"*Dessert only review* My partner wanted to wait out the rush hour traffic on our way out of town, so we decided to snag some open seats a Ciprianis and have an impromptu late afternoon dessert date. And I'm so happy we did. It was the BEST meringue cake I've ever had. This was a few months ago and I still think about it often! It literally melted in my mouth. Their tiramisu was also incredible, so smooth and rich. Our seats were positioned to look out over the rail. It was fun to watch everyone in grand central station going about their business. Watching the hundreds of people going in an out really made me appreciate the term New York Minute. The atmosphere was lively, people getting out of work, going to happy hour, having business meetings... etc., it was so fun! The dynamic between restaurant and busy station made for built in entertainment. Not sure if I'd love this for dinner but it made for a memorable and happy dessert date!",1,0,0,Kate M.,"Portland, ME",72,65,111
4.0,11/25/2018,"I come here every year for different events.  This place is really an elegant and gorgeous venue space.  They are very organized and their staff are pros.  I always have a fantastic time whenever I come here.  The food is pretty good.  They offer a nice assortment of appetizers.  For dinner its always the same either steak or fish.  I like their steaks but to me it's always a hit or miss.  Either you get a perfectly cooked steak (for me its rare) or a steak that is too well done and that is so not for me.  So now, instead, I order their fish (Chilean sea bass) it is cooked perfectly.  Their sides are nothing spectacular just potato and a vegetable.  I look forward to coming here again for future events.",1,1,2,Betty L.,"Sunnyside, NY",323,414,1887
2.0,11/13/2018,I loved this hall so much until it got to my food . The steak or chunk of meat was inedible and the staff looked like they were unable to handle the crowd. It just lost its charm after that.,1,1,1,Ayesha T.,"Malvern, PA",75,123,239
5.0,9/11/2018,"Attended the Legends Ball here on Saturday and I have to say the food was very good. My steak was delicious and perfectly cooked. My sister's meat was overdone and she should have said something. Mine was a perfect medium rare and you didn't need a steak knife. The burrata cheese appetizer was delicious too. The dessert was excellent as well. Service was very good and the venue is beautiful. All around great experience. I'm sure it was pretty pricey but since I didn't pay for it, I'm giving Cipriani's five stars.",0,0,0,Lily C.,"Islip, NY",35,461,428
1.0,9/9/2018,"I am beyond disgusted by this restaurant.  Friends met here for brunch after a night in the city, heading out for our trains.  The prices are not unexpected but very high.  We spent. $300 on brunch for a small party.  Every time anyone wanted to use the restroom, we were informed that the closest restroom which is in the adjacent restaurant is not open to Cipriani customers.  Then, when we were finished, and paid our large bill, we decided to go to the adjacent restaurant for a drink.  It is literally through the doors of Cipriani and it is pouring outside.  The manager refused to let us walk through the doors of Cipriani to go to the restaurant next door.  He insisted we would have to leave the restaurant, go outside and enter the doors of the other restaurant from the street.  After spending $300 in a restaurant, whose service otherwise was excellent, the manager's treatment was rude and unacceptable.  I hope the restaurant sees fit to terminate him because I frequent this restaurant often, and won't do so again given this.",1,1,0,Jennifer L.,"Sherman, CT",0,1,0

My friend made a reservation for our late lunch and the place was packed. Business men in suits, well dressed ladies, etc. I had my usual the white pasta with ham and then the branzino. He pasta is delicious and the fish served tableside. My friend had the veal chop which was Fred Flinstone size. We finished with the layer cake. The martinis are one of the best reasons to come here.

The service is top notch and then bread basket they give you in the beginning is so good there's all different types served with butter. I had to order their famous Bellini which was delicious I got like 4 haha. Don't think they were too strong though. I got the pesto pasta which was pretty good nothing too special though.

While walking around I discovered their restaurant in the Terminal, but didn't have time to eat there. This trip I did, and the food was terrific. My son and I stopped after touristing all day and even though we looked like bums they treated us like kings!We started with the beef tartar which was outstanding. It melted in our mouths!My son had the tagliolini with pomodoro. The sauce was perfectly balanced. I had the tagliatelle wth lamb ragu , off of the bar menu.

2.0,6/13/2017,"Gorgeous venue but disappointing food. Came here for a work luncheon and was excited to try the food. Given the well-known restaurant name that exudes elegance and flair, it was very disappointing to taste mediocre food. The hor deurves were ehhh. Pigs in a blanket (could easily be Costco and heated up. Love costco by the way!). Lobster bites were weird. It was warm lobster stuffed into a small, hard and stale tortilla chip. Crab bites were wrapped with cucumber - this was okay but had a slight funny taste to it. On to the main lunch portion. Salad was good. Probably the dish of the three course meal. The entree was a split pea risotto. It tasted more like uncooked rice with three peas. Fish came on top of it. Super salty skin. Fish itself was decent. Onto dessert - really not sure what it was. All I know is that it had loads of cream everywhere and burnt sugar crystals sprinkled on top and on the side. It is like a meringue with soggy cake. The fruit that accompanied the cake was good at least.",4,3,3,Shelley L.,"New York, NY",96,466,1212
3.0,6/6/2017,"I've been to the Cipriano Downtown and have to say that it is way better. This location is inside of Grand Central and doesn't have the same feel.

The service here isn't as good and the staff isn't as friendly. Overall though, my food that I ordered still came out good.",0,0,0,Stephanie G.,"New Haven, CT",349,85,19

3.0,1/24/2017,"This review is about my NYE experience. Friends and I purchased a regular ticket, if I recall correctly it was $150. We did not do the flash pass, no table or anything. I feel like we didn't wait too long, my friends said we did but maybe I pregamed a bit too hard. This place was ok. It was my first real NYC NYE experience and it was no doubt a beautiful venue, a nice occasion to be dressed up. The wait time for drinks was FOREVER and I didn't have any food. I also recall the menu showing that almost everything had pork in it (which I don't eat) so I was restricted anyway. One suggestion Cipriani - try to make the appetizers a bit more diverse! Music was okay, but they did pass out champagne for midnight which was nice!Fell a few times, the floor was slippery. A friend's friend fell and cut his hand on a beer bottle and had to go to the hospital for stitches. I wasn't present for the incident but it plays into the narrative that the floor was slippery and the staff couldn't really keep up with the incidents. Bathroom was clean and BEAUTIFUL might I add. Random thing I remember from that night. I feel like venues like Cipriani really do try offer a positive NYE experience, so I'm giving them three stars cause I feel for them - and the staff. Don't forget to tip them. They are working hard to make YOUR night the best it can be.",3,4,1,Aysha S.,"New York, NY",475,69,16
5.0,12/20/2016,"My (A list) office party was held here this year (the catering location, not the restaurant).  It's an old bank and the architecture is amazing.  Seriously high ceilings with pillars.  The food was delicious, the desserts were delicious.  My office doesn't settle for anything less than stellar so they pulled out all the stops.  The drinks were flowing, dancing area was spacious.  The staff was fabulous and very friendly.  We had a great time.  The acoustics were harsh in such a large, high ceiling space so if it's an event specifically for acoustics, not the right option.  On the dance floor the band sounded great.  Toward the back it was just loud.  Those who chose not to dance and to wanted talk had to sit in a second room with the desserts.  Definitely a beautiful location for a fancy office party.",0,0,0,H S.,"New York, NY",3,167,0

5.0,11/22/2016,"Wowwww! Cipriani is an architecturally stunning, Italian Renaissance inspired venue!!!! The space itself took my breath away. This is THE PLACE for any large event. Upon entering for an award dinner, there were countless staff lined up to collect coats. As I moseyed my way to the bar area, there was an endless supply of hors d'oeuvres. Fortunately, there was no need to chase trays. With lots of bartenders ready to assist, guests were able to get drinks at lightning speed. Let me fast forward to the meal.By the time we sat, salad and bread was already on each of the several hundred plates at the event. The speedy service continued with one server placing risotto directly onto our plates followed by another server topping that with the most massive and beautiful piece of sea bass that I've ever seen in my entire life. The best part was that the food didn't just look nice, but it tasted fantastic. I watched the entire table, including my husband who doesn't ever eat fish, devour their plates. Somehow, we all had room for dessert which was a chocolate shell filled with vanilla, coffee, and chocolate sorbet topped with berries. I'm pretty confident that every single guest in the room was extremely pleased with the meal and service.

5.0,9/7/2016,"Went when we were waiting for a train. Sat quickly and decided to do appetizers for dinner to share. Had the calamari and prosciutto with mozzarella. Both were fantastic and more than enough for both of us to be full. Calamari was just rings (I don't like the tentacles) and had great sauce (one almost buttermilk based ranch flavored tartar sauce and the other was an excellent marinara). The prosciutto was also delicious with sliced mozzarella underneath. Although pricy, definitely delicious! Both dishes were about $27 a piece.

5.0,3/13/2016,We had the pleasure of attending a benefit for Winston Prep Academy here last night. The place is stunning! It used to be a bank so it has the high (really high!) ceilings along with very ornate woodwork and huge Corinthian columns in all of the corners. The wait staff was huge and they were all spot on! During the cocktail hour I never held an empty glass or plate for more than a few minutes before someone came by with a tray to take it. The h'orderves were all outstanding! I lost track of how many different things they had to offer but there was a lot. When we took our seats the outstanding service continued. My water and wine glass were NEVER empty. The entrees were delicious.  Had the prime beef with a side of green beans and a sliced potato. Dessert was either a chocolate mousse cake or ice cream and fresh berries. Both were delicious. The bathrooms were very clean and had attendants. I sincerely hope to be back next year or sooner!,9,5,7,Robert M.,"Roseland, NJ",1005,330,403

3.0,11/6/2015,"Two parts to this review...  was here for a gala, and the building itself is across from Grand Central. Large entry, with a coat check to the left and a side bar area that was filled with three different long bars, more than enough to handle the 500+ people that came that night along with the bars on the other side.  Large space that reminded me of a mini Grand Central (being a former bank) with the design and arched ceiling. Bathrooms off to the corners.Second, the food. Appetizers passed included salmon, tuna tartar, and pigs in a blanket - all good. A mozzarella & prosciutto salad with pear that was good, a Filet Mignon steak that was entirely too dry, and sea bass that was a massive cut that was bigger and thicker than the steak medallion - not bad and better spiced, in my opinion. The potatoes stuffed with veggies were ok. Potato au gratin was only so-so, too. The dessert - a lemon meringue that was only ok. Drinks were strong and the service was pleasant. I suppose it's tough to cook the same thing for 500+ people at once, but I've had better at large events.Overall, an interesting event space.

1.0,3/9/2015,"Friday, 3/6/2015 my husband and I had reservations at Cipriani's.  We know this is an expensive restaurant, so with it being ""Restaurant Week"", we thought we would give it a try.  First of all, we didn't realize that this location was in Grand Central Station right out in the open. No one mentioned that when we made the reservation and they should have!  People walk by, stop in with their bags etc., and it totally takes away from the ambiance-in fact there is no ambiance, so I was immediately disappointed by that.  I dressed nicely for a nice restaurant, but this location simply did not require anything but jeans and a sweatshirt. The first server to come over to us was not very nice.  He did not say hello, welcome to Cipriani's, my name is...nothing at all like that.  He just said drinks?  I was not impressed. He quickly and wrongly surmised that we were not going to spend a lot of money so he shoved us off onto another server, which was fine, he was much nicer, just somewhat inexperienced, but a very nice man.  We ordered a bottle of champagne to start the evening and then we ordered the menu for restaurant week.  I must say, for a restaurant like Cipriani's, I expected so much more than what we got.  My husband and I both ordered the Buffalo mozzarella.  It was not good quality, and it came with cherry tomatoes cut in half with a few shreds of basil.  No olive oil.  It was an embarrassment.  Next came the entrees.  My husband got veal ravioli and I got the lemon sole.  The ravioli were quite small and came on a small plate with no sauce and they were dry and tasteless.  I could not believe they would even serve something like that!  It was pitiful and a disgrace!  My lemon sole which made no mention of any sauce that would be on it, came with a red sauce all over it which made me wonder why.  Lemon sole is usually lightly broiled and served with nothing but maybe a little butter, salt and pepper.This fish was old and they were covering that fact with the sauce.  Another disgraceful dish.  Dessert was equally awful.  They brought out a pumpkin pie that looked brown and not at all appetizing and a lemon meringue pie that was worse than what you would get in a diner. In fact, I know at a diner the pies would have been awesome compared to these sad desserts! Needless to say, the best part of our meal was the champagne.  I feel that if you are going to participate in restaurant week, that you should put your best foot forward or don't even bother.  As a result of our experience, we have absolutely no desire to come to Cipriano's and pay regular prices because we have such a bad taste in our mouths, no pun intended.  Unfortunately, because Cipriani was so focused on making the most money they could, they blew an opportunity to ""wow"" us having us wanting for more and coming back again.  Now we will never be back to any of their locations.  There are plenty of very good restaurants in NYC, so we don't need Cipriani's. My husband and I were in the restaurant business for 24 years as owner/operators.  We understand the business fully and we would never serve the food that we were served, ever, to anyone. We owned fine dining establishments that were respected for the food and the service and the ambiance.  Cipriani's had no ambiance, terrible food, and inexperienced service.  A lose, lose, lose situation.  I hate wasting my money.  I don't mind paying good money for good food and good service, but this was not the case here.  I might as well have thrown my money up in the air so the pigeons who fly around and over your head could pick it up and use it for nesting!",4,5,1,Kathy S.,"Lavallette, NJ",63,10,0
1.0,3/9/2015,"My wife and I dined at Cipriani's (Grand Central Station) location on Friday evening, 3/6/2015. Both my wife and I have been in the restaurant business (owned and operated 3 fine Italian dining restaurants for 24 years); so our palates are truly diversified and knowledgeable. We enjoy dining in the New York City restaurants as often as we can. Now, let's get down to business. The original server that approached us was rude. He actually tried pushing our drink and food order even before i took my jacket off. Once he realized that we were going to be dining, not to be rushed, he passed us on to another, kinder, less experience waiter (which was fine). Appetizers: so they call that fresh, homemade Buffalo Mozzarella ? Can't be. Little pieces served with cherry tomatoes and a few shreds of basil. I was embarassed and I don't even owe the place! Not even a trace of Olive Oil, which the young, inexperienced waiter brought for us. Entrees: My wife's fish was pitiful. With a sauce that I can't even discribe. I have never, in all my years in the industry, saw a sauce like that before. We would have enjoyed it more if it came from a can. My so-called homemade veal stuffed ravioli's had to be freeze dried. Had to be....Had to be.....I am telling you, they were the smallest, tasteless, driest ravioli that I have ever tried (where was the sauce?). Desserts: ""let's see? What do we have left over in the freezer from the holidays that we can serve, oh yeah, what about this frozen pumpkin pie, back here by the frost bitten fish....here we go.....let's get rid, I mean, serve this to our wonderful patrons who like to spend a lot of money on less than edible food.

Then he took another 5 minutes to run my card with the place half empty.  No buddy, you got $4 on a $50+ check because you suck at your job.This is a restaurant in a train station, it is completely inexcusable how slow they are.  And that's leaving aside the fact that for less than 1/2 the price, you could get better food down in the for court.

It was quite good but portions were really minimal. But still tasted good. The reason why I gave it a two stars, it is because for the awful service we had not from the server, but from the manager on duty (A gentleman with glasses and a pink tie). When we entered into the restaurant he was seating at the bar and when he saw us, he just stood up like nothing happened and without any smile or welcoming attitude. When we asked for the dessert (which took quite a long time), he just told us "" it's coming "". No apologies or guilt signs. When we asked for the dessert for the second time, he came with 2 extra bowls of ice cream to apologize. The intentions were good but the way he did it was extremely rude. He just ""threw"" the 2 extra bowls of ice cream on our table and left without saying anything. We felt like he just wanted us to ""shut up"" and eat our ice cream and leave.

4.0,1/9/2013,"Review is for NYE party held hereCame here with a large group and we had a seated table (without bottle service). It was pricey but I'll say overall it was worth it. Staff was very very friendly, lines for the bar were never too long. Crowd was dressed very nicely. You can wear anything from a nice jacket and tie to a tuxedo if it pleases you. (weren't too many people in tux's though). The music was pretty fun (started off lame though)The venue itself is GORGEOUS, very big and spacious. The only thing I will say is initially coming inside the music from the door sounded kinda crazy cause it was bouncing around in too much space. Near the dance floor it sounded fine though. The dance floor did get a bit crammed later but at least everyone was friendly.If you get the seated table you can either be near the dance floor (loud, but near the action) or kinda far away in a corner in another side. Both have their pluses. We ended up being kinda far away which was good when we wanted to talk but it wasnt as lively if you want to hear the music. If you want to be closer to the action i suggest you request that or maybe you have to have a bottle table? not totally sure. Hors d'oeuvres were actually really really good. It's a shame we were so full we didnt get chance to eat much of them. If you have a table they bring out some just for you.Overall I would definitely recommend if you can afford the price tag. It's a fun experience which is not the s%&tshow that some new years eve's parties are. Good mix of lively people but a little more mature.

The two of us have had our fair share of Bellini experiences- even at it's birthplace at Harry's Bar in Venezia- and it was here we consumed positively the best Bellini ever!  To top it off, the service was sublime and the atmosphere as well (don't forget to admire the ceiling of Grand Central- breathtaking).  However, the second time we came here, a few months after the first,   we were hopeful for the same stellar taste and service.  Unfortunately, we felt like we were back in the Harry's Bar in Venezia- the wait staff too consumed in themselves to truly be attentive and make a drink beyond a just plain OK (questioning why these prices are so high).  It was not even as if we came at a busy hour, but rather simply a day when the entire waitstaff was in a bad mood. As a side note, the best Harry's Bar I have ever been to in the world (the one time I didn't order a Bellini from them) is in Firenze- if you're ever in the neighborhood, it's well worth every penny (or centesimo).",1,2,1,Courtney T.,"Nolita, Manhattan, NY",1,44,0

5.0,2/21/2008,"Last night was the second time I was here; both times were for events.The space is beautiful, high vaulted ceilings with mosaics, and there were gargoyles set into the end of each arch.The waitstaff is incredibly attentive; I went over to the h'ors d'eouvre table and a server plucked items for me and placed them on my plate, then handed me a fork. There were hot entree stations, a wine and cheese station, as well as servers walking around with finger foods. As for alcohol, oh my god! Not only did they have servers walking around with champagne and bellinis, there were three or four open bars.The setting is elegant, the service is elegant, the presentation is elegant, sorry to use the same superaltive, but it was a first class event  at a first class place.",1,0,0,PJ G.,"New York, NY",292,229,5
4.0,1/13/2008,"Was here for an awards ceremony, great upscale space.  Definitely a spot every NYer should experience at least once.  Had the signature bellini and risotto.  Filet was a pretty generous cut too.",1,0,0,Charmaine L.,"New York, NY",1,11,0
4.0,1/9/2008,"Oh how I love Cirpriani.  My alumni association has an event every January here, and it's always well done.  They have our school mascot tastefully projected everywhere in the main room.  Multiple bars, multiple food stations.  The food is great, though I guess it doesn't take much to make carpaccio, proscuitto, grilled asparus, grilled onions.  It was all very good food, and there was lots of it.  And best of all, they serve white peach bellinis.  What can be better than a night eating food and drinking white peach bellinis.  I love these things.Though they did start flashing the lights, and trying to get us out as soon as our reserved time ended.  Guess they needed to clean up.",1,0,1,Linda W.,"New York, NY",39,421,124
3.0,1/8/2008,"My company rented Cipriani out for our corporate holiday party.  We packed it to its gills -- I estimate that there were easily over a thousand people in here.Surprisingly enough, the multiple bars were fully staffed and equipped to handle such large volumes.  I did not have to wait long at any one point to get a drink, and they were all well-made and plenty alcoholic in nature.They had buffet-style snacks, and although I very rarely eat anywhere that has a buffet, I had a taste of the grilled arthichokes -- and they did not disappoint.  I am sorry to say that I missed out on their penne pasta in red sauce, my favorite dish and a famous dish of theirs, but my friends all assured me that it was delicious.Really, the only reason it loses stars is unfair, because it had nothing to do with the actual venue -- there was a truly awful Beatles cover band playing, and it really ruined the atmosphere.",0,1,0,Shasha M.,"Los Angeles, CA",60,279,7
1.0,2/6/2006,"I was less than impressed with this restaurant. Although the view was interesting--the balcony overlooks Grand Central Terminal--the smell of cleaning solution was prevalent throughout the whole meal...not exactly appetizing. The wait staff is inattentive, and the food is only mediocre for the price. I am a brunch addict, so I went for the eggs benedict on the prix fixe brunch menu, and found everything merely so-so. The potatoes with red pepper were not even edible, in my opinion. There are much better restaurants in the area, and I won't be going back.",4,2,0,Michele W.,"Los Angeles, CA",153,309,0
4.0,12/13/2005,"A very elegant eatery located in no other than Grand Central Station, Cipriani's offers professional service frequented by a suit-and-tie clientele.  Their 'Safe Way to Gaining Weight' lunch special is the way to go.  For $24, you will get a mixed green salad, a choice of chicken or pasta, dessert, and coffee.  This restaurant is my midtown pick if you are looking for something on the upscale side for your lunch escape.  Make reservations.",0,0,0,Sarah B.,"New York, NY",41,280,505
