2.0,4/27/2019,"The only reason I am giving two stars is because I have gone in the past for dinner and it's been passable, but today for brunch was atrocious.The waitress took our order of three items (Cuban sandwich, vegetable posole, grilled fish tacos, no special requests) and seemed confused from the get go. Despite reading our order back to us initialy,  she came back later to confirm the order.   OK.Food comes out as it is ready, as is typical with tapas places.  Cuban sandwich came out first, inexplicably soggy, bread completely soaked through with moisture to the point where it was difficult to even pick it up.  While I rarely end anything back, it was so egregiously wrong that we assumed it must have been an error on their part and had it sent back to be replaced when the runner brought us the vegetable posole.  The posole was probably the only thing that we got that was pretty good, although it was very one-note in flavor.  After that there was a very long wait.  Perhaps 15 minutes later the waitress stops by and perfunctorialy asks is everything is OK.  I start to respond saying, ""actually..."" but before I can even finish my sentence she condescedingly ""reminds"" me that food comes out as it's ready and she knows we are waiting for one more item.   I say, great--but actually I just wanted to let you know that we had to send the sandwich back too.  She obviously had no idea and hurriedly walks off.  Ten minutes later she stops by again and asks if we ever even got our tacos.  Nope.  She seem confused and irritated.  Perhaps another 10-15 minutes later the Cuban sandwich replacement arrives looking better--it tastes decent, average.  Another 10 minutes later the long-awaited fish tacos finally arrive and are disgutingly soggy with moisture seeping through the tortillas and falling apart. The fish was not grilled and the texture mushy and gummy, to the point where I questioned how fresh it was.  We literally took one bite and left the rest.   At that point we are just ready to go but no one was clearing our plates and our waitress is no where to be seen, to the point where I think she may have quit mid-shift.  I tried to make eye contact with someone who seemed to be a manager but he was studiously avoiding eye contact.  After craning our necks for 10 minutes I literally stood up, put my coat on, and remained standing next to the table with my wallet in my hand.  It still took another 5-10 minutes for the waitress to rematerialize and ask how everything is.  We say to be honest the fish tacos were inedible and we would like the check.  She says he will speak to the kitchen abot it.  Subequently returns with the check with every item on it.  For a place that is charging $25 for two tacos, those tacos should at least be edible and the service should not be so laughable.",0,0,0,Jessica A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0
2.0,4/19/2019,"They really need to train their staff. Waiters saw me raise my hand and look at them but kept on ignoring us unless it wasn't their table. They never come to you unless you call them and I literally had to stand up with my glass and get my water filled from the bar. Later, our waiter was replaced and Brice was wonderful. He was the only staff that was doing his job. The food is great but salty.

As was the drinks. However, the menu was not what I remembered it being. The only thing that I ordered that I really LOVED was the mushroom mole tacos. And the mezcal cured salmon was good. The drinks were excellent. I recommend the passion fruit mezcal margarita skinny style. However, the rest of the menu did not taste Mexican/or Spanish at all. It felt like the chef had a misidentity. The cheese fondue was sad. As was the chocolate that cane with the churros. Overall, I would come here for a snack and a drink to enjoy the scene, but don't come if you are really hungry.",1,0,1,Nan W.,"Manhattan, NY",31,111,36

4.0,3/27/2019,"I'm embarrassed to say that I would probably come back to ABC Cocina just to bask in the glory of the decor - it is insanely gorgeous. It's a Jean Georges restaurant so be prepared to pay up. I came in with high expectations, and I felt like ABC Cocina met them, but just barely.The drinks were all good, but more expensive than the average cocktail in New York. I found the drinks all lacking inspiration for such a nice restaurant.Food:-Complimentary focaccia and sourdough bread: good/nothing memorable, but I'm annoyed that we had to flag our waitress down to get the complimentary bread-Oysters: very good-Short rib tacos: These were to die for. It was so flavorful and the pork was perfectly cooked. These are a must order!-Mezcal cured salmon: I didn't love the cucumber yogurt relish, but I imagine most would really like this dish-Shrimp with sizzling garlic oil: a complete pass. It was literally 5 small shrimp on a skillet, soaked in chili oil. The dish was heavy without a good flavor to make it worth it. It was pretty bland, and the shrimp was a little bit overcooked-Arroz con pollo: a big dish of crispy fried chicken and rice. The rice dishes on the menu are more expensive than the rest of the menu, but it really fills you up-Winter vegetable posole: a plate of mixed veggies. Overpriced for what it is, but the sauce used was delicious. -Churros: deliciousThe ambience of the restaurant is really sceney, but nice. The restaurant was blasting EDM at one point so that was definitely a turnoff, but it seemed to mellow out afterwards. I felt like the service overall was really, really lacking though. It took forever to place our drink and food orders, and it was hard to flag down our waiter throughout the night. A sign of good service is that your water glass is never empty, and my glass was perpetually empty throughout the meal. The bad service is a huge turnoff and quite surprising for such a high calibre restaurant that's been open for over 5 years. I'll probably be back again nonetheless.",4,2,2,Peggy W.,"New York, NY",577,248,288
3.0,3/22/2019,"We have always been a fan of Jean George and were very excited to come to ABC Cocina.  Sadly, it was not particularly exceptional or interesting and a bit pricey.  Perhaps it was made less appetizing by the remarkably loud volume in the room.  Couldn't wait to wrap up so we could escape.",0,0,0,Elaine H.,"Cambridge, MA",0,3,0
3.0,3/22/2019,"5 stars for the service, it was unmatched. The waiters were very attentive and kind. We made reservations but they were running behind so we were seated about 15 minutes after our reservation time (no big deal) the food however was very mediocre which I was extremely disappointed by considering 1. The price and 2. The hype. I ordered guacamole, chili oil shrimp, chicken tacos, calamari and the arroz con pollo. Firstly the guacamole was $19, like I get guacamole is expensive but that was way above average for what it was. I honestly think chipotle guacamole is better. Second the chili oil shrimp wasn't even a hint of spicy, it's literally shrimp and chili oil, no special sauces or flavors. Anybody can make it at home. The best thing was the calamari even though it was about 8 pieces max, the accompanying sauce was great. I also ordered the salted caramelized flan and it was weirdly warm instead of like cold as I'm used to? I also had the tres leche cake which was very good. Probably my favorite part of the dinner was that cake. I wanted to try this place for a while so I'm glad I did but also I would never come again. I just don't think the dishes matched the price points.",0,0,0,Min C.,"New York, NY",12,92,63

3.0,3/16/2019,"For these prices?! The food should match the ambience and service staff which was absolutely excellent. The food was averaged as a polite ""good"", not a charismatic ""good"" and certainly not great, as agreed upon by all five members of my table. The Bad:Tuna Tartare - sent back. Everything was ""off"" with this dish. Fish was very fishy, flavor profile tasted more like cole slaw with bits of gone bad tuna. Fried fish tacos - bland and very soggy. Sweet slaw on top maybe should have been drained a bit before topping off taco. The flavors, still weren't there for me. I love fish tacos so I was sorely disappointed and even left one completely uneaten. Oysters - a few days past their prime for serving. The Good:Guacamole - one of the better tasting dishes, albeit $18 for guacamole is a bit highTruffle fritters - very good, exploding with flavorShredded Brussels sprouts - flavors were amazing! (I love Brussels sprouts btw)Octopus - delicious, cooked to perfection. Flavors of the sauces were great and balanced Maitake mushrooms - delicious albeit it's not hard to mess up a grilled mushroom The Ok:Calamari - squid tasted a bit off. Not sure if it was old, under or over cooked...Empanadas - good but again for these prices it should be amazing. I don't recommend going to ABC Cocina unless you like atmosphere and service over cost and taste of food.",0,0,0,Tamas S.,"Brooklyn, NY",198,81,11
2.0,3/14/2019,"Let's review this in the setting of an expensive dinner where the food was high quality.Table wasn't ready at reservation time. Okay no problem. Server brings waters and menus. Server is then no where to be found and have to ask someone to find him (minus a star). Takes our food and drink order. Food come before drinks. In fact drinks land on table 50 minutes past the reservation time (minus a star). Food arrives as ordered. Very good. Order glass and wine and ask for dessert menu. Drinks come. No menu. Ask another person for a dessert menu. She says she'll find our server. She come back to clear plates. No menu. How hard is it to get a menu whether you're the designated server or not?? (Minus star) I had joked that it would take 15 minutes to get a menu. In fact it did take that long. Dessert came. It was good. In my opinion you can't have above average prices for above average food with well below average service. Also for anyone that cares, it's loud.",0,0,0,Greg W.,"Manhattan, NY",135,75,0

There were 2 kinds of bread, neither of which were great. The waiter suggested 3-4 plates each, which sounded like waaaay too much. We started either a cheese board & tuna tartare. The tuna was delicious, with a Spanish flavor rather than the usual Asian seasonings. It was served with deliciously crunchy tortilla chips. The cheeseboard has 3 varieties along with a few apple slices, Marcona almonds and some type of fruit preserve. All were delicious but could have used a good cracker as a base. Still a little hungry, we ordered the squash & mozzarella empanadas. These were delicious too. Served with a slightly spicy sauce but no idea what it was as it wasn't listed & the server didn't explain. Oh, there was also a tiny bottle of light orange liquid in the table-when I asked, we were told it was habanero pepper hot sauce.

5.0,1/21/2019,"Wow, this place is awesome! Numerous people had recommended this place and now I know why. First of all, the service at this place is impeccable. They only had an 11:30am reservation online so I booked it. Come day of, we realize we wouldn't be able to make it until about 12:15. I gave them a call and they change my reservation to 12 and told me they allow a 15 minute grace period. Yassss!! We get there and they seat us by the window overlooking the street, so Parisian of us! The menu is pretty self explanatory with sharing portions. The drinks are just so incredibly unique. I started off with the hibiscus piso drink and had another round of the fig drink, both had an amazing display and flavor. Where do I start with the food?!! We had the guacamole, the beef empanadas, oysters, shaved Brussel sprouts, clams, garlic shrimp and fish tacos. For dessert we had the tres leches cake. I can tell you I was in food heaven. The guacamole comes with roasted tomatoes and a churro like chip, soo good. Oysters and clams were very fresh and tasty. My two favorite dishes were the shaved Brussel sprouts and the shrimp. Let me tell you in other restaurants I probably wouldn't get these dishes because I'm not a fan of either but it was soo good here. I don't know what they put in the Brussel sprouts but it was melt in your mouth good. The shrimp was seasoned with garlic and in a spicy aioli sauce. Soo goood. The fish tacos have this spicy pickled cabbage on top. Also, very good. The beef empanadas were good, but nothing to elaborate there. Finally the cake!!! Tres leeches done right! I cannot sign out until I talk about our waitress. Didn't get her name but she was originally from Puerto Rico. Such an amazing soul.

Biggest gripe is that we arrived at 5:30pm as soon as doors opened to get a walk-in table. Seated at 5:40pm. However we were chased out at 7pm. And when you're spending $200 for dinner for two you should be allowed to sit a few extra minutes to talk and digest. Nope. In fact, they even acted like we should be taking our dessert to-go. WTF? As. If. I really had to fight to get it to stay (we were there for my friend's B-day celebration). Probably won't go back.

5.0,1/5/2019,Every single tapa brought to our table was amazing. Their kombucha is super tasty too.

Basically boiled shrimp covered in chinese chili oil.     - Maitake mushroom ... burnt? 3. Fish taco, at least the fish was freshly fried.     - arroz con pollo... so anyone else ever had chicken and broccoli from any take out restaurant? This was that except hold the broccoli, salt and multiply the price by 3.4. Dessert was ok.

2.0,12/29/2018,"I get that this place is ""hip"" and certain things come with that - but I don't think it's a worthwhile destination. After an incredible meal at ABC Kitchen a few months ago, this was at the top of my list but did not perform up to the standard I'd anticipated. As always, I'll start with the food. Guacamole had so much lime juice it overwhelmed the avocado, brussel sprout salad was good but had quite a bit of cheese, tuna tartare seemed like a riff on a spicy tuna roll but the mayo or whatever it was blocked out the tuna taste, fish tacos weren't bad, and the short rib tacos were a lot fattier than your average. I wasn't even dying to finish any of the dishes, nor would I recommend any of them. Service too was mediocre. It took so long to put in a drink order that we'd already chosen all of our food options - we were sitting for about 15 minutes with water but no other attention. Our server came back occasionally throughout, but then the same issue popped back up for dessert. We decided that if it took more than 15 minutes to order dessert, we'd give up. It took about 12. The churros were fine, for the record. I think the food would probably be 3 stars and the service as well - but then we spent almost $200 for a glass of wine, a cocktail, and the above mentioned food.

The food was quite good and they accommodated my mom's dietary restrictions very nicely, though the service left something to be desired.For appetizers, my father and I split the Shrimp with sizzling garlic and chili oil and the charred octopus with smoked paprika creme fraiche and guajillo vinaigrette. The shrimp were quite good - cooked and seasoned well - but nothing that really stood out. The octopus, on the other hand, was superb. Perfectly cooked, not chewy but not overly soft, and perfectly charred to impart just the right taste. The smoked paprika creme fraiche and guajillo vinaigrette (the latter with a wonderful sweet note and quite a good texture) were a wonderful complement to the charred octopus and tied the dish together in a wonderful way.I ordered the Chipotle chicken tacos. They were absolutely amazing; the chicken pieces were moist and tender with a beautiful golden crispy exterior. The frizzled onions and Chipotle sauce were a wonderful complement, and I've been inspired to try something like this myself. Parents were both quite pleased with their entrees as well.My one complaint was the service: the three of us received our entrees over the course of about 15 minutes, and I had to ask twice where my tacos were while my parents were already eating.

5.0,12/8/2018,"Had dinner at ABC Cocina tonight, and oh boy, it was amazing. When we arrived, we accidentally walked into ABC Kitchen, just for reference ABC Cocina is the second restaurant to the right. The atmosphere is fantastic. It's a big, beautifully decorated room with high ceilings. The service was attentive and you could tell they were considerate of allergies/any special food requests. The seating was a little tight, but nowhere near as bad as other restaurants in Manhattan. This is an excellent choice for a date night or to celebrate a special occasion.On to the food, everything is tapas style. When we sat down our waitress told us rice dishes take 30-40 minutes to prepare, so right off the bat we put in an order for the arroz con pollo, crackling skin, lemon zest. I recommend you order exactly what we got, everything was amazing. Total order:Guacamole ($18) - this tasted fresh and amazing, only complaint would be they should give more chips. I feel like the chips ran out before the guacamole. shrimp with sizzling garlic, chili oil ($19) - these shrimp were dynamite, must order. crispy fish tacos, aioli, cabbage-chili pickle ($21) - hard to pick what my favorite thing was, but it might have been these crispy fish tacos. I got quiet while eating them, because I was literally experiencing a symphony of tastes in my mouth. if you like fish tacos, MUST ORDERsavory glazed short rib tacos, habanero relish, frizzled onion ($25) - nearly as good as the crispy fish tacos, delicious.charred octopus, smoked paprika creme fraiche, guajillo vinaigrette $23 - another home run, really good. arroz con pollo, crackling skin, lemon zest ($28) - this came out last. It was just solid tasty rice and chicken. At a lot of tapas places, you run the risk of leaving hungry. Not with this rice and chicken. I'm still stuffed. Highly recommended if you are hungry. vegan popsicles ($9) - my girlfriend and I both try to not eat dairy. We wanted to order sorbet, but there was none on the menu. So we ordered.. these popsicles? They're vegan, and they didn't taste bad.. just not on par with the rest of the meal. I didn't finish them.

2.0,11/25/2018,"The only reason I even gave ABC Cocina 2 stars is because the place is super cute. I haven't been here in years and I was honestly shocked at how bad the food was. I thought perhaps it was just me, but even my 2 friends at the table said, ""this place used to be much better"". Was honestly so disappointed. To start, when we first sat down, the waiter offered us drinks. One of my friends said she was going to wait until dinner for her drink and the waiter walked away...even though there were 5 other people at the table who wanted to order! They also never cleared our plates. We had a pile of dirty dishes and empty glasses on our table the whole night. It was a late reservation, the place was half empty, there's really no reason they couldn't take away our dirty dishes to make more room on the table. With that being said, the first guacamole with cilantro was very tasty. We ordered 2 more servings (@$18 each for a small bowl as pictured) one with cilantro and one without because my friend doesn't like cilantro. The waiter brought both and said he didn't put cilantro because she didn't like it...even though she ordered her own separate one! I personally love cilantro and wish he hadn't made the decision for me to not put it on mine as well. The fish tacos and tres leches were honestly the worst I have ever had. I've had better from local, not well-known restaurants. I expected MUCH better from a Jean-Georges restaurant. The tuna tartar was AWFUL! They said something about them making it in egg? I'm not sure, but tuna tartar is not supposed to taste like that. Considering how expensive it is, it isn't worth it at all. Don't waste your time or money. It is very overpriced, even for NYC.

Bartender was good. We had some kinda shrimps with spicy oils they ve been good. Then Brussels sprouts salad was amazing. Then we tried fish tacos which was in the middle. Not that great but still very good. A bit not that flavorful to my opinion. Last dish we had chicken with rice. I don't really eat chicken that much, but this one was amazingly stewed.

5.0,11/13/2018,"Sitting right in between ABCV (Vegetarian & Vegan) & ABC Kitchen, Cocina is the funkier out of the bunch and this was interesting at first sight! Stuffed to the rafters with lots of Dark Greys, Blacks, coupled with the softest details in their Chandeliers and pop of powder pink flower arrangements. Cocina's menu is way beyond the typical Garlic Shrimp, Yuca Fries tapas and Sangria. And gives Tapas the attention it deserves with interesting global fusion of some African, lots of Mexican and a bit of Middle Eastern flavors- in an upscale but casual setting. With the exception of hubby's Calamari/ Chorizo (which he loved) combo that I didn't try, all else was enticing. Concept is kind of exclusive on Small Plates- (different from the other two ABCs). Price? Up there for some things. Unlike other restaurants who serve super-size tapas, Cocina though- offers a true (smaller) Tapa and will run you between $16-21. But hey... this is ABC after all. Between my selection of Shaved Brussel Sprouts($16) Chili Oil Shrimp ($19) and the most tendered Charred Octopus($21- probably not even whole tentacle)- which I shared with hubby- plus his own Calamari & Chorizo($19)- I must admit, these folks take ingredients and style to another far out level! My 'Mariposa' Cocktail had too much ice but was smooth and packed strength at $16 while hubby kept it more civil on a Monday afternoon with a Blood Orange Mimosa at $14. Our first time here and became Jean George Vongerichten fans instantly because of his cooking styles! Can't fault the ABC company for some of their prices or nitpick about our first server not smiling, (Christina was more pleasant) but Ima leave this one with a straight up 5. Cocina is nothing short of gorgeous (for me). This is the kind of restaurant that's as perfect for a night out with friends as it is for romantic one- but I actually see it more romantic than anything else.

My expectations weren't too high and I could probably say it was my favourite dish of the night!

The ambiance is fantastic- a spacious room, gorgeous chandeliers, dim lighting, exposed wood and concrete, with a trendy and lively crowd. Service was impeccable from the moment we checked in with the hostess. The bar was extremely crowded so the hostess secured us seats at the bar nextdoor at ABCV while we were waiting for our table.

Now on to what we ordered: Guacamole trio, patatas bravas, beet salad, empanadas, chicken tacos, arroz con pollo, vegetarian rice, flan and tres leches.

5.0,8/2/2018,"I wasn't really sure what to expect at ABC. I love tapas. And, as a store, I've been a fan of ABC since I moved here 21 years ago. But over the years, it's always been hit or miss when it came to the restaurants there. I got a little more apprehensive when we arrived, and saw that the Cocina was this massive space, and not something more intimate, which is typically the kind of tapas restaurants I am drawn to.That said, for as big a space as it is, the folks at ABC did a great job of designing a dining room that felt comfortable, with the same comfort of a smaller intimate one. Beautiful ambiance.That said, OMG ... the food (well 90% of it) was surprisingly spectacular. Let's just start right off the bat and get right to the star of the show: the charred octopus. Now, I've never had octopus. And, when my husband said he wanted to try it, I happily told him he could have the whole thing. I wouldn't have a bit. Well, I lost that battle fast. Jayson had me try a nibble, and OMG. Boy, did I misjudge that. It was amazing. So succulent. Cooked precisely to exactly what it needed. And, seasoned to perfection. I'm ready to run back today, just to order that.The freshly made guacamole was absolutely delish. Add on a bit of the habanero sauce, in the cute little bottles on each table, for a little kick, and it hits the mark.Finally, the oysters ... We got a dozen on the half shell. Mouthwatering and fresh. Would have preferred something more on the lines of a cocktail sauce, rather than the three toppers they served it with. Still don't know what the oil was, nor do I really want to know. It was without taste or flavor. I wasn't thrilled with the tuna tartare. There was nothing to this. It almost felt like some obligatory dish they threw on there, but that no one particularly cared to do much about. And, I love tuna tartar. But, I'd never order it again at ABC.We were planning to order a few more, but after those four, we were completely full.We closed out the night with dessert. I don't eat desserts, but you could see Jayson's eyes roll back in his head on the first bite.My only real complaint or misgiving was with our server. I'm still not sure what the point of her being there was since we only saw her when we ordered, and at the end. And even then, we had to seek her out, as did the table next to us. It kind of irritated us that it wasn't so busy that she would be MIA. Moreover, she hardly did work to earn the tip.That said, the back waiter, Helen, who tended to us, was AMAZING. She should be on the floor, she was so attentive, very knowledgeable, and extremely good at her job, checking to see if everything was okay, refilling our water, and doing all the tasks that a good waiter would do. (And, FYI, I'm married to a server. So, I know the plight of those who work in the industry.) If we could have, we would have given Helen the entire tip. I hope management takes notice of the star they have in their midst.Defitinely keeping this bookmarked for another return (and that I rarely do.)",3,1,1,J.

4.0,8/1/2018,"My husband and I researched ABC Cocina and decided that it would be a great tapas restaurant to try. Walking in you are taken back from the beautiful ambiance of the restaurant. It does help that we walked through the ABC furnishing store to get to the restaurant. We were seated promptly as we had reservations. A minute master a lovely woman named Helen came over to ask us what type of water we wanted. Then we browsed the menu and taking peeks at our neighbors dishes. The waitress Amber asked if we knew what we would like. (Read more about our experience with her later) We started with the guacamole. It was delicious. The spring peas that were on top were delightful. Then we had 12 oysters. They were, I kid you not, the best oysters I have ever had. We then sat for a bit waiting for Amber to come back to take the rest of our order. And then our neighbors were looking for her and we were all wondering where she could of went. Long story short: I loved Helen. She was very nice and personable, while Amber was not. Ok so them I ordered the octopus and he ordered the tuna tartare. I felt like I died and went to heaven when I tried the first bite of octopus. It was deliciously tender and very smoky. Superb. The tuna tartare, I could of lived without. Reminded me of inexpensive yellowtail sushi. Then for the end I wanted the tres leches cake with cactus granata. Wow. Just wow. I have nothing but rave reviews for the food. The service on the other hand was very lacking. Except for Helen. She was a real delight and very attentive. I wish the tip would of gone to her because she did much more than just write things down on a piece of paper and walk away.

Having had another great experience on what must have been close to my tenth visit (mostly brunches, though one dinner), I have to say that this place just does not miss. To be fair, I have tended to stick to the same staples (raw fish and/or jamon iberico to start folloe r by arroz con Pollo, griddled fish tacos), but it's too good to pass up. Everything is cooked and seasoned just right, and the orange colored (I think habanero based) hot sauce is the perfect accompaniment - make sure to request it on the side. And though it is not situated on the most inviting street, I would still recommend al fresco dining on a nice summer day. My only potential beef would be with the slight over pricing ($15 for two tacos or $30 for chicken n rice - tough to be out of here at under $40 a head, even if you don't take down any alcohol..) but I guess if you want elevated cuisine, you have to pay the price.

No alternative was offered except that she could hold our purses for us, we declined because we had our wallets and other valuables in them.

Firstly, I made a same day reservation on open table for the only slot they had available and I'm glad I did - looked like there were a lot of people waiting around the bar to get in. The decor is great - a juxtaposition pf exposed concrete, wood and metal, with a mix of classic and contemporary chandelier lighting. We were in the far corner and there was what looked like a more casual dining and bar area through the back with lots of sculptures. The service throughout was attentive and sincere. At one point the light next to us started malfunctioning - it wasn't a big deal but two people came over and apologised, plus we got a free drink each....We opted for the chefs tasting menu, which includes maybe 10 plates for you to share. The rest of the menu also looked great but just felt like the set menu would be easier. Honestly, everything on there was great and we were both stuffed after.Thoroughly enjoyable experience and I would recommend it to anyone that is in NY (and can get a table)",1,0,1,James G.,"New York, NY",24,128,182
1.0,4/28/2018,"This review is overdue from months ago. Our experience here started off poorly, entirely due to the obnoxious hostess. We came in and she acknowledged our reservation, but said they weren't ready to seat us. Several groups of people came in after us and were told the same thing. However, they all ended up getting seated before us by another person. I wanted to leave the restaurant at that point, but the two people with me said to give it a chance. The obnoxious hostess seated us all the way in the back at a table meant for two people. If management is reading these reviews, I hope they decide to fire that pathetic excuse for a hostess.

2.0,4/25/2018,"I had to change my reservation twice and both times I called the restaurant directly. The second time the person who ""assisted"" me was less than pleasant and patient. When my party arrives at the restaurant, the hostess only has a record of the second reservation. She seems put out that they need to accommodate our party (7 people) and places us at the communal high table which isn't a problem for us. One member of our party had special dietary restrictions and had asked several times for different variations for dishes on the menu (can I just have the X without the B type of requests) all of which were refused. I finally step in with the waiter, ""What would you suggest for someone in his situation?"" The waiter responds with a suggestion that sounds really similar to what was requested earlier but fine.The food itself was not to my liking. I had the chicken tacos (bland) and the patatas bravas (meh) and sampled the gauc and chips that were actually pretty good. Oh, and the virgin pina colada was delicious. I wanted to order another one but couldn't get our waiter's attention. I thought that some time during the dinner he would stop by and ask us ""how is everything"" but that didn't occur.The restaurant was busy so we were not so subtly pushed out as soon as the last bite of our dessert was taken which is pretty par for the course at popular NYC restaurants. Our group hosted an out of town business guest and I can say he was underwhelmed. As a positive, the atmosphere is lively but it gets crowded very quickly.

5.0,4/20/2018,"ABC Cocina is the Mexican/tapas line of the ABC restaurants. I've been to ABC Kitchen before but actually enjoyed Cocina better. The restaurant itself isn't very large but is very trendy. I came during lunch on a weekday and was glad I had made a reservation ahead of time. Since everything is sharing style and comes out in any order, they recommend 2-3 selections per person. We picked about 8 or so between the three of us and it was a little too much, mostly because we got the chicken which is a larger dish. Most of the dishes are on the small side though. To start, I ordered the gin cucumber cocktail. It was refreshing and not too sweet. For food, we ordered:-Guacamole (really good and unique since it had peas, which added both flavor and texture)-Fish tacos (hands down my favorite item and I don't even like fish tacos! It had a pickled slaw with it that was perfect)-Oysters (price is per oyster, nothing that stands out but good nonetheless)-Lobster (again, nothing that stood out.. would get something different next time in place of this)-Crab cake fritters (my second favorite, flavorful and crispy on the outside)-Chicken tacos (decent but came with a mustard which I wasn't a fan of)-Pollo (takes 30-45 min to make and is a larger dish but we got lucky and someone accidentally ordered it so this was the first dish that came to our table.. definitely wouldn't mind getting this again)-Shrimp in garlic/oil (one of the plainer and smaller dishes)This bill definitely adds up but if you want to splurge, it's worth it.",1,0,0,Christina B.,"New York, NY",318,324,1064

2.0,4/18/2018,"Let me preface this review by saying that I had been a long time fan of ABC Cocina for many years. In fact, I was a fan of PIPA before ABC Cocina.  The space is beautiful, the ambiance is great and the food was always on point.  Last night, I had a business dinner with a client of mine. We arrived at the bar at 5 pm.  We had to meet earlier because we were on a schedule.  Understanding that food service does not start until 5:30, we thought we would have a cocktail at the bar.  There were about 5 people in total at the bar area and there weren't enough seats together to accomodate a party of four.  We moved one chair over to our area and we were immediately reprimanded by the hostess that this was against restaurant policy to move chairs.  The entire restaurant was empty and it was moving a chair exactly a foot away.  We complied but were a bit annoyed.  We were then seated at our table, again, the entire restaurant was empty and they wanted to seat us at a communal table.  I immediately said this was a business dinner and we did not feel comfortable speaking about business at a SHARED table.  The same hostess that reprimanded us about the chair said ""this is the policy, we are overbooked and this is the ONLY table we have for you.""  Can I again reiterate that the restaurant was EMPTY?  She brought the manager Ashley over and they begrudgingly sat us in a four top table and said ""by the way, you have to leave at 7:30 because we need this table.""  This restaurant was more concerned about a future table than the patrons that were actually there at the restaurant.  Logic and common sense would tell you that if we're eating an EARLY dinner than we would leave on the earlier side.  To add insult to injury, the serve spilled an entire glass of water on my lap, the table and my laptop bag.  I left promptly at 7:30 to catch and train and immediately after I left, my colleagues AND my client were ruthlessly kicked out of the table.  I guess spending close to $600 dollars doesn't account for anything at this restaurant.  I will be taking my business and my corporate card elsewhere....",1,0,0,Cindy M.,"New York, NY",251,42,24

1.0,3/8/2018,"What am I missing? This Latin American and Spanish tapas spot is a very popular restaurant in ""legendary"" NY restaurateur Jean-Georges' stable. And it's easily the most mediocre, overrated restaurant I've been to in a long time.I've only eaten at one other Jean-Georges restaurant, Vong, shortly after it opened, more than 25 years ago. This French-Thai fusion restaurant was also singlularly underwhelming. I'm convinced that Jean-Georges is a culinary con man, coasting on reputation and clueless expense-account diners, the perfect restaurateur for a trump hotel, which hosts his eponymous flagship.It was amazing how flavorless most of the dishes at ABC Cocina were. It's almost as if they have a machine in the back to extract the flavor from their dishes to sell off to other restaurants.Two of us shared five items, and I'd say only one of them was really any good. The waiter first asked us if we'd like to start with guacamole before we looked at the menu, a tacky non-Mexican Mexican restaurant tradition (not the guacamole, the assumption). I passed without hesitation.In order from worst to best, we had:Spicy glazed baby back ribs. They were neither spicy nor glazed, and they weren't smoked. They were impressively flavorless--they didn't even taste like pork!Mushroom empanadas. A tie for worst. A flavorless mush of some kind of chopped mushrooms and mild cheese in a fried empanada.Patatas bravas. The classic Spanish tapas bar snack here was fried too dark and served with an undistinguished aioli.Savory glazed short rib tacos. They were acceptable when I removed the greasy little ""frizzled onions,"" which was basically onion ring breading.Tuna tartare with chipotle aioli. This was very good. It was the first thing we were brought, which led me to expect a much better meal than the near-total washout we ended up with. It reminded me of the tuna tostadas that are very popular in Mexico City. But if the tortilla chips weren't packaged, they sure did a convincing impersonation.New York has many great Latin American restaurants, both classic and inventive.

The arroz con pollo was probably the most underwhelming entree of all. It was suggested to us as a popular dish so we decided to order it.

The main courses were the fish sandwich and the shrimp quinoa, both rather small in portion but tasty. The shrimp was nicely grilled and the fish crispy and topped with a nice olive tapenade. The highlight of the meal was definitely the dessert, specifically the passion fruit sorbet on the rice pudding. The impossible flan was tasty but man that sorbet was incredible.

4.0,1/30/2018,"The ABC complex of restaurants is frustrating. It's scene-y, it's hyped, it's too expensive, it's hard to get a reservation. But they mostly deliver on the food.We came to Cocina on Thanksgiving weekend. A 5:30 pm reservation for 3 was easy to get about a week or two out. The menu is tapas style, but pulls from every corner of Latin America and Spain.We started out with a round of cocktails, all tequila-based and well-made. Our first dish was Iberico ham ($18), which was great quality, though pricey for the portion. Next was honeynut squash ($11); so nice with the goat cheese, pumpkin seeds, and chili. We beefed up the meal with mushroom empanadas ($11), which were great, and short rib tacos ($24), which were fine. Patatas bravas ($10) were a hit with my parents, though I didn't see anything special about them. A good idea for the table, though.I was feeling a little under the weather so I also had the chicken soup ($15). Wow; one of the best soups I've ever had in my life. So bright and refreshing from the lime, and every component was delicious. The chicken was tender. I felt healed.The pacing is way off here. Things come out tapas style, as they're ready, and we received all of our dishes half an hour into our trip (not even half an hour after ordering). We stalled via coffee and dessert (cookies, tasty but not a must get).Service is excellent. I don't love the decor-- I know it's supposed to be a showroom for the furniture but it looked disorganized with so many clashing styles. Lighting is good, vibe-y but not too dark.

Another thing was when our fish and shrimp salad came out (which says second course), we were still waiting for another tapa.  When we asked one of the bussers, her attitude was rude, speaking to us like we were dumb and that there's no main course and everything will come out as is.  Well, at the end of that, we ended up having to tell them again, and they realized they FORGOT it completely.  Our waiter didn't apologize, just said it's coming now.  We already had finished our second courses, while the RAW shaved fluked, which would've been the easiest and fastest thing to whip up together since it's not cooked, came out when we were almost done.  The worst part, was when dessert came, the waiter dropped the check at the same time.  Fine.  I looked and I saw a crowd of people in front waiting to sit down.  But not even finished with our dessert, he takes it away, and deliberately slides the check in the middle of the table and didn't even say thank you.  I would rather have you tell me ""hey we're busy, gtfo"" than to obnoxiously slide the check in the middle of the table while in conversation.I never would have thought to get awful service from a renowned restaurant.  I would've had better service at a Chinatown buffet.",9,0,1,LISA N.,"New York, NY",850,383,283

The charred octopus was one of my favorites. Very complex flavors and extremely tender octopus. The crab fritters were really good too with that spicy chipotle sauce. But then again, anything fried must be good. We also got the raw red snapper and mezcal salmon. Both had some really refreshing dressing/sauce that made it feel less like the brutal winter it currently is. The jamon iberico ham was also another great choice. Definitely more cured than the stuff you get at the grocery store.It was a nice experience and the food is amazing, but every time a dish comes out, there are more ingredients than what's on the menu. Our table enjoyed guessing what the other components are. Plates are on the small side for the price point. 6 plates plus tax and tip was about $150.Glad I got to try the tapas.

2.0,1/10/2018,"This Jean-George restaurant is a liability to a  brand of great restaurants and fine service.  Was disappointed on many levels. It's a rip-off.  Conceptually, the food offerings are obviously an outsider's take on Latin food. There is no generosity and definitely little love in terms of portion or presentation.If you read reviews of this restaurant, you know enough about what you'll experience, but we went ahead anyway hoping for a decent dining experience. Sadly, none of this is new. Good: Only waited few minutes to be seated. The flavor of the sauces was amazing. The server was sweet and accommodating but pushed for a brussel salad that was me. My grapefruit 16 dollar cocktail was refreshing, but all ice and not a value. Server tried to make accommodations to spice level. Bad: Drinks and food grossly overpriced and portion size is piddly, meagre. The mojito had no discernible rum in it, it wasn't sweet at all and all seltzer. We had to send it back.No explanation for the salsa on table. The rice with chicken was nothing special and at 27 dollars- is a crime. Bringing focaccia and sour dough bread doesn't seem Latin. Ridiculous acutally. The guacamole was made ""fresh"" only because we requested it made without jalapenos.  The portion is small and the chips are few. It is bad bad. Rosa is better and hello! that's not good enough. The brussel sprout salad had no cheese on it or marconas. Rip off and again, tiny. Ugly: Long waits for drinks and food is really inexcusable. Two dishes came out together 45 min after we arrived which was bad. No silverware was brought out for arroz con pollo. It was plopped down the table. Being told what is a classic mojito and what isn't when one asked for a rum drink..is...Like a cafeteria, someone came and was picking up paper placemats and folding them with no sense that they might be interrupting your conversation. Waiting for food and then it all comes means that the server wasn't able to time the food properly. Just because the spice level is altered doesn't mean you should have to wait longer.

2.0,1/3/2018,"So conflicted because the food is decent but the portions are so, so small - I understand it's a JGV restaurant but regardless of the name, the overall experience was just not even close to Michelin quality. First of all, the restaurant is cute on the inside but doesn't exactly look upscale. It's very trendy but by looks alone this is the type of place you might spend $30 pp rather than closer to $50. Despite showing up on time for a 6:30 reservation I could not be seated immediately because my date hadn't arrived yet (normal for many NYC restaurants, but again, if I'm going to be paying for JGV I better be getting JGV service). It was very brusque.We were seated near the back corner which made for a relatively unpleasant dining experience - it was very drafty and cold at times. Objectively one of the worst tables so I'm sure not many others had the same complaint. I'm pretty sure I heard the table that was sat prior to us ask specifically NOT to be sat there, so my ego was bruised a little bit that I got not only the leftovers but the crappy leftovers. Again, this was probably unique to my experience, but with a pricey meal I would expect not to feel hypothermic during the dining experience.We ordered as follows:Two glasses of wine (chardonnay for me, pinot noir for him) - fine, was not given a taste, was not presented the bottle/label - something I'm accustomed to in most places of ABC's caliber/price point.The brussels sprouts salad with cheese and almonds ($14) - the smallest portion I've ever seen, although admittedly very tasty.The mezcal-cured salmon with yogurt and potato flakes ($16) - basically 6 pieces of mediocre lox. The shrimp with oil ($18) - only 5 tiny shrimp in here. I know this is a popular dish but I was thoroughly underwhelmed. Boqueria has a much better version, and I'm sure it's cheaper.The ham and cheese fritters ($14) - 5 of the smallest fritters you've ever seen. Absolutely bloody good though. Damn I could snack on these for days.Chipotle chicken tacos ($18) - for 2 of them. Not the worst value on the menu. Were pretty filling and the chicken was damn good. You can get better tacos at Tacombi or Los Tacos, though.The honeynut squash with goat cheese ($11) - oddly my favorite dish. Absolutely delicious. No complaints other than I could eat about 8 of these as an appetizer and still be starving.All in all, the 2-3 tapas pp that they recommend is a bloody joke. The food is good, but come on - for such a pricey meal I better get either bigger portions or some bells and whistles (how hard would it be to pour a taste of the wine!!!).",7,5,5,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1025,331,1186
2.0,1/1/2018,"Really underwhelming restaurant. I have now been here twice, and let down both times. The service is fine but the food is no bueno. Tuna tartare was disgusting, way too much mayonnaise. Calamari bad as well. Patatas bravas good, the highlight of the meal. Fondue was ok but boring. Chicken tacos are ok, can't hold a candle to listen tacos numero no.1 and 2x the price and half the size. Tres leches cake pretty good. Overpriced sangria. Basically way over priced for what they are serving, which I would be okay with if the quality was on point. It was not. Go elsewhere.Nai tapas would be a much better alternative.",0,0,0,Daniel K.,"Atlanta, GA",43,91,0

5.0,12/25/2017,"MUCHO love for ABC Cocina...give them allllll the stars. Jean Georges and his team did a fantastic job with the menu. The flavors and combinations were bold, spicy, focused, intense and so so good.  We loved the spiced ground beef empanadas, and believe it or not, the tuna tartare (i know, facepalm). In a world where tuna tartare is overly done and bastardized, Cocina goes and creates this amazing ""dip""-like consistency meant to be eaten with delicious warm, tortilla chips and it's this incredible balance of flavors that make it one of the best I've ever had. Shrimp with sizzling garlic was very good and was a very nostalgic dish for me...husband wasn't as impressed. We tried the crispy bbq pork tacos which came on lovely house made tortillas. Mitake mushrooms with goat cheese was a surprisingly fantastic dish and they went all out with the goat cheese. And I must mention the insanely good bottle of house made hot sauce on the table... we poured it on everything. And by pour, I mean drenched. I'd drink that sh-t straight from the bottle. The arroz con pollo was a comforting, stewy warm dish that was delicious- our only gripe was that the rice seemed to be a bit over and mushy for our taste but we still enjoyed it.Drinks were creative enough and accompanied our dinner perfectly. Desserts were one of the stunners of the night- I'm usually a purist when t comes to traditional desserts like the tres leches and flan, but these renditions were quite amazing. Both luscious, phenomenal in taste and creaminess and a lovely way to end the meal.

We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay and a bottle of Pinot noir. Reasonable wine that were both enjoyable. For food we weren't overly hungry and wanted to split a handful of dishes. I'll preface the food portion of the review with the fact that my party didn't not order correctly as we had 2 people not feeling well so we stuck to more basic dishes. We ordered the guac, patatas bravas, beef empanadas, crispy fish tacos, chicken tacos and butternut squash with goat cheese. The squash was the clear favorite dish of the group. Had a ton of flavor and melted in your mouth. Most of the other dishes were pretty average. While there was nothing completely wrong with them, they just didn't blow me away. The portions were also quite small for the squash and patatas bravas. The empanadas and patatas bravas especially lacked flavor and could have used more spices. I think the guac would have been better with cilantro but we had some haters in our party. I would have wanted to try the grilled calamari and one of the rice dishes as those seemed pretty popular.

4.0,12/8/2017,"I came with a few coworkers in Thursday night and had an overall great time.Ambience- 4/5It was dark and tastefully festive with their dainty lights and ornaments hung around the tables. It wasn't too crowded but was definitely on the louder side. Our waitress was super attentive but then had to leave as her shift was over. Unfortunate as the following waiter was not as attentive and we definitely had to hail down multiple times.Food:Guacamole-3/5. Guacamole is usually a safe bet at most restaurants and point in case, the guacamole here was pretty standard. The avocado had the ripe, creamy and smooth texture (which is not my preference) but it wasn't bad.Brussel Sprouts Salad- 4/5. To be honest, we totally misread it and thought we ordered toasted sprouts but the salad type dish tasted very light and fresh. It is pricey for some chopped up raw brussel sprouts on a plate, with a few pieces of cheese and maybe a handful of chopped almonds...Butternut Squash- 3/5. Not sure why this was the last to come out from all the dishes as it was a tiny little appetizer but tasted as you'd expect for puréed squash, a bit sweeter than expected with lots of honey.Shrimp in garlic chili oil- 5/5. By far the best of the dishes and disappeared off the table the quickest! The shrimp was succulent and perfectly cooked and I was thrilled that the chili oil actually had a kick with a nice addition of fresh peppercorns. Only wish they gave more (comes with 5 pieces).Griddled Fish Tacos- 3/5. The fish tacos were pretty average- had a few pieces of filets per taco that had a nice sear on them. The lettuce on top didn't really add much in terms of flavor or crunch.Short Rib Tacos- 5/5. The pieces of meat were really juicy and full of flavor! The chopped peppers and fried onion rings made each bite savory.Ground Beef Empanadas- 3/5. The empanada shells were pretty hard and unfortunately the meat stuffing was super salty.Gooey Ham And Cheese Fritters- 3/5. Five tiny deep fried balls of ham and cheese... Whatever the stuffing was was definitely gooey but you couldn't tell it was ham or cheese. Dessert/Drinks:We ordered the salted caramel flan and the assortment of cookies. Both were 3/5. The flan has an interesting hard crust and a less gelatinous body, flavor was ok but couldn't really tell what it was. The cookies were ok but hard to share, three different types; a banana/ peanut butter sandwich, standard chocolate, and I think some sort of fruit jam cookie. We also had 3 bottles of wine which was pretty nice- though we might have had more if our wine glasses were continuously filled throughout the night (we couldn't fill them ourselves since they'd take the bottles away).",1,0,0,Jinny C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,49,290
3.0,11/29/2017,"I have been there twice in the past month and am disappointed in the inconsistency of the portion sizes. We were a party of four and the portion of shrimp was six shrimp, would it effect the bottom line if they gave 8 shrimp. The table next to us got twice the amount of chips for the guacamole, and there were only two of them . They also need to serve the small plates together in some instances. The small beet salad was enough for two bites each , and should have been served with something else as we then sat and waited for another bite of another product. On the positive side the service was great , the octopus and arroz con pollo was delicious .  Small plates are great and you end up leaving full, but wondering if it is worth the price. 27 for two short rib tacos is really high and although delicious would not order them again .",0,0,0,rosie A.,"New York, NY",74,64,1

Our server was really nice and funny. My only problem was with the food. They serve tapas styled food which is fine but it just wasn't all that and it didn't taste like genuine Latin food. We ordered 5 small plates, shrimp, chips with cheese dip, stuffed cheese and ham fritters, the chicken and rice dish, and calamari. The calamari was so fresh and yummy. My boyfriend loved the fritters, the chips on the other hand were literally 18 dollar priced chipotle chips strategically placed on a plate with stretchy melted cheese in the center of the plate. The shrimp was spicy which wasn't previously disclosed in the menu, and the rice and chicken was just not great. It was really soggy and moist which aren't adjectives that are suppose to be used to describe rice and chicken, lol. Anyways for dessert we got the chocolate and grape ice cream which was really great, the flavors mixed in really well. Then our server surprised us with a complementary piece of tres leche cake with a single birthday candle  which was really sweet and tasty. It didn't taste like tres leche but it was good.

We actually chanced upon this sister restaurant because ABC Kitchen had a wait time of about 40 minutes for dinner on a Saturday evening. We quickly made the decision to order a few drinks and tapas at Cocina while we waited for our table at ABC Kitchen. The menu, at least its vegetarian offerings, read like a list of things that should make you feel better about your other dietary habits. We ordered the guac (it came with pepitas and microgreens) and the mushroom tacos. For the price, as a lot of people have noted, it's not a proportionate amount of food. But that isn't my main complaint about Cocina. The servers were very lackluster and did not care about giving us a good experience. We had to flag our server 3 whole times - it took him 20 minutes to come to our table to take our order, we had to wait 5 minutes to catch his attention when our water needed to be refilled and he finally gave us the wrong check from someone else's table. All this because he was too busy chatting up the bartender. 40 minutes later, our table at ABC Kitchen was ready but we were still waiting on our tacos. We finally got them in a container and fled to ABC Kitchen because honestly, that has consistently been a superior experience by a mile. I think ABC Cocina is the spoilt little sister that is only cashing in on the goodwill of the better, more fabulous ABC Kitchen.

There are two restaurants - ABC kitchen and ABC Cocina. We opted for the cocina, a tapas-styled dining experience. Service was good, the drinks were ridiculously over priced (~$16/cocktail, maybe standard fare in NYC), the food was good. We ordered three dishes: The fish tacos (excellent, although my companion found the pickled vegetables too sour), the cured salmon (pretty good, slightly too salty with the salmon but the cucumber cream sauce lightened it up sufficiently), and my favourite dish of all, the chick pea calamari. Overall, the place has a casual vibe and is a relaxed place to dine, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Would come back.",0,0,0,Calvin L.,"Saskatoon, Canada",3,110,25

Fragrant, fresh, and delicious. Not a hint of fishiness whatsoever. Entree - Mexican lasagna with stewed chicken. Hearty and filling, with delicately balanced flavors. A little heavy on the tomato sauce. Could have balanced it out with more meat or filling. Dessert - Salted caramel flan and vanilla fritters in a chocolate mousse (you choose one, but I tried a friend's so I mention both). The fritters were much more rich, but indisputably and absolutely delicious. You cut into the fritter and vanilla sauce leaks out onto a bed of chocolate.

The food highlights: 1.  Heirloom Tomatos, how on earth do tomatoes taste this food? 2.  Beet salad: I'm bored of beets yet this salad shocked me with its fresh herbs and fruit addition which I'm usually not a fan of. Spectacular.3.  Tuna tartar: exceptional, herbal and creamy. Ask for their fresh bread rather than the tortilla chips. 4.  Shaved Fluke: olive oil cured it seemed, so fresh that the fish was the star and a treat. Now on to desserts:1. Peanut butter Jelly sorbet etc: amazing and rich dessert.2. Vanilla cream center doughnut things: wow. Crunchy outside, oozes real vanilla bean cream. Amazing. 3.

ABC is everything you want that quintessential, design forward amazing culinary experience you would hope every NYC restaurant would be.  Being part of the ABC home family, of course the design is impeccable.  Only an artist can make mismatched flatware, artwork and lighting feel so purposeful.  The cocktails and food were more than impressive to boot.  I mean how could it not be? It's Jean Georges. We arrived at 8:00pm on a Friday night and the place was hopping with a very stylish crowd.  We waited a little bit for our table, so I indulged in a Strawberry Margarita.  At $16 it's pricey, but strong and delicious. We feasted on a few small plates - I would say about 4-5 plates for two people should suffice if your hunger level is medium.  I really was craving cheese that night, and the cheese plate was not to mix - a healthy serving of 3 cheeses, almonds and a delicious apricot like jam. Phenomenal. The roasted beet salad is a must - very fresh, light and delicious. The ground beef and celery root empanadas were good - a bit spicy, the kind of spicy that can run through your system! I REALLY liked the spicy baby back ribs.  I wouldn't say they were particularly spicy - it was a dry rub with delicious seasoning.  Plus, the ribs fell off the bone.  If you're a dry rub fan, these are not to miss.

2.0,7/26/2017,"Let me tell you a little story about ABC Cocina. I decided to finally try it out today. It's restaurant week so of course they're booked but luckily they have these seats by the window and shared tables open. So we pick a seat by the window.That was the first mistake. The hostess told us we would get ""full service"". It took forever just to get a menu and the server just brushed it off. We finally ordered everything all at once.The food was delicious. This is the only reason for any stars. We got patatas bravas which was elevated by the rosemary. We got crispy fish tacos which had this amazing pickled briny cabbage filler. We also got some beef empanadas which came with delicious spicy tomato sauce. The tres leches does NOT taste like tres leches and comes with these sad rubbery peaches.The drinks are nice but are they really worth the 16-18 each?Now back to the WORST part. The server gave us a check and then told us we had drinks at the bar that needed to go on there. We didn't bother to look at the check and he took it back. When we realized it was a mistake that he charged us for 3 extra drinks we never asked for he had already charged it. He made an ""adjustment"" and told us it would change the amount charged but it still went through.I think they probably do this a lot to people. He seemed unfazed by the mistake. It also took about 10-15 minutes to get them to come to us each time there was a transition from dessert to check to fixing the check.Major FAIL. Don't come here without a reservation they'll cheat you out of your hard earned money on ""fake"" drinks.

Keep in mind this is tapas style so very small portions. I have read many reviews stating something like 2 dishes was more then enough for each person... I am not a large human being but they must be either fasting or are physically minuscule. I easily consumed 3-4 of my plates. For the prices of these dishes I expected a bit more (taste wise and maybe portion but I can understand the small portions due to the style).

3.0,7/24/2017,"So I gave them another try last night because I was in the area and have been craving tacos lately.When I walked in it wasn't too busy and I was able to get an open seat by the bar. Unlike last time I actually got greeted and given a menu. I ordered a drink and some tacos, short rib to be exact. They actually tasted pretty good and were very tender. The old fashioned I ordered wasn't that great, but my margarita that I ordered next was tasty.So, you're wondering why I only gave it three stars, right?It's because of the value. The drinks were very small and mostly ice. My margarita was just a few sips and they still charge $16. The food was also overpriced, they only serve two tiny tacos per order and they charge $24. The tacos were tasty, but not worth that price. I could have gotten equally satisfying buns from the noodle bar for less. I skipped dessert because it seemed underwhelming. I usually don't mind spending extra at restaurants if the food and service was exceptional, but unfortunately I didn't not leave feeling that way. Overall the dinner was ok, if you decide to give abc a chance at least you'll know what to expect.

Despite the fact that Cocina has been open for over 3 years, the hype is still real. I was lucky enough to be able to snag a last minute table for 3 at 8PM on the Friday before MDW.My table ordered:- Sweet pea guacamole: my friends both declared this the ""best guac ever."" Would I agree? I mean, it's hard to make a bad guac, but this was pretty damn good,and the chips they come with are oddly addictive.- Shrimp with sizzling garlic oil: probably my least favorite dish of the night. This came with 5 small shrimp in a skillet, bathed in oil. I thought the dish was way too heavy, mostly flavorless, and the shrimp was overcooked.- Crispy fish tacos: delish! Definitely get these. Despite being fried, the fish was not at all overwhelming. Tastes even better with a kick from the hot sauce at the table.- Chipotle chicken tacos: good, but not as good as the fish. Writing the review one month later, I can hardly remember what these taste like (besides a general impression that they were good). These already come with some sort of jalapeno sauce, so no extra hot sauce necessary.- Arroz con pollo: soooo addictive with the crispy skin and pieces of chicken scattered throughout fried rice. This was the most substantial dish that we ordered.- Tres leches: one of my friends was obsessed with tres leches (so am I tbh), and had to try it. We were mostly disappointed with the less than traditional preparation. Tasted more like a fruit cake you can get from Paris Baguette than a tres leches cake.- Warm vanilla fritters: our server pushed us to get these, and we gladly caved. These were TO DIE FOR. Seriously. Warm fritters filled with cream and Mexican chocolate for a dipping sauce. I think my pancreas almost gave out at the sight of these, but it was so worth it.Overall - one of the best meals I'd had in months, though some dishes are definitely better than others.

3.0,6/18/2017,"I'll get right to the point.. ABC Cocina was a total let down. With all the hype, I expected to be blown away. Unfortunately, I've had WAY better tapas in NYC for half the price. My boyfriend and I started off with two tapas, the spring pea empanadas (highly recommend by everyone) and patas bravas (a classic). The spring pea empanadas were even recommended by a NY times food critic so we expected them to basically ""rock our socks off"". I can honestly say it was the worst empanada I've ever had in my life... The only way I can think of to describe the stuffing is ""blah"". I felt like I was eating a can of peas wrapped in fried dough. The patas bravas were fine, but I've had much better elsewhere. At this point we decided we'd stop there and find somewhere else to eat. It's very unlikely that I'll ever return to ABC Cocina. I guess trying two tapas isn't really giving them a fair chance, but I was interested in wasting more money at this place. My recommendation would be to spend time stalking Yelp reviews before coming here and maybe you'll like the dishes others have recommended.

Most notably, this past winter: We felt as though the servers were majorly rushing us and also simultaneously pushing us to order more food.  One night, in the middle of dinner, my boyfriend was picking up his (still full) $20 glass of wine to take a sip, and the bus boy literally snatched the glass out of his hands and quickly disappeared, with no explanation.  We looked at each other bewildered, like, did that really just happen?!?  In hindsight, we should have said something then, as that is not the level of service that we have experienced in the past at ABC Cocina....(but, isn't that what Yelp is for?

They also own two restaurants right next door to each other ABC Cocina and ABC Kitchen so make sure you know which one you are going to. The ambiance is very trendy, eclectic and upbeat, it is loud in there so make sure you are prepared for that. I am not going to go through every aspect of what we got because honestly I cant even describe the flavors. All of the dishes were so intense with unexpected flavor combinations that every single bite was an explosion of flavor and a treat to my taste buds! I would highly recommend these dishes: raw shaved fluke with green chili dressing, Florida white shrimp in""agua diablo"", banana and almonds, savory glazed short rib tacos, habanero relish and frizzled onion (I don't like short rib and I could have eaten these all day), charred octopus, smoked paprika creme fraiche and guajillo vinaigrette (octopus is one of my favorite dishes and this passed with flying colors) beef tenderloin""burnt ends"" with chimichurri.

Be sure to squeeze the lime on top, really adds to the flavor.The mushroom maitake dish had lovely flavors, the sauce was excellent.The fennel salad with yogurt was refreshing, we really enjoyed this.Spicy garlic shrimp were out of control good, the runner mentioned that the pods on top were very spicy, and they were....but if heat isn't your thing, the overall dish wasn't spicy, just don't take one of the pod / seeds.Steak tips were well presented, cooked to perfection, but be aware, that means almost rare...I'm sure you can ask for medium if you'd like.Grilled octopus was highly recommended and for good reason...very tender and juicy.Sangria was AWESOME, best in the city, in my opinion.It's worth mentioning the service again because the experience was enhanced by everyone's friendliness and eagerness to make us comfortable. Water was refilled and plates were cleared without hovering and the runners were just as helpful and attentive as our waiter. This made all the difference for us and I know we will be back soon.",1,0,2,Estina R.,"Manhattan, NY",148,306,16
3.0,5/15/2017,"As a lover of ABC Kitchen, I figured I would try ABC Cocina for brunch on Sunday. My friend was vegetarian, so we ordered 4 vegetarian tapas for the two of us (we weren't particularly hungry, but it was still a LOT of food). We had the vegetable rice, cheese fondue, beet salad, and mushroom tacos. The mushroom tacos were pretty good, and the beet salad a great mixture of sweet and spicy and sour flavors. However, the cheese fondue was oversalted whereas the vegetable rice was not very flavorful. I was a bit disappointed in those two dishes, and we ended up not finishing either of them.Service and ambiance were great.",0,0,1,Lillian Z.,"New York, NY",814,173,56

But I'm cutting to the chase here on one very disappointing aspect of La Cocina and that is the host. She needs to embue either charm or more effective skills in at least ""pretending"" to guests that she gives a darn. We were celebrating the publication of a book...she was coming from the publisher's and running a little late. I got there within the 15 minute grace period but was told if she did not appear within a minute we would lose our table. The restaurant was half empty at 5:45pm. and then I was given the cold, impetuous shoulder. I have been to a vast variety of Michelin star restaurants and believe me...you don't shut your guests out like this. There are a variety ways to handle situations like this and get a win-win from guests running a little late and still make them feel welcomed. No restaurant with a Michelin should have a head of the house who makes her guests feel put out. There is just no excuse for that.",0,0,0,A K.,"San Francisco, CA",0,25,0

This new york trip has been so intense my fingers are starting to hurt from all the reviews and you are probably getting super bored of my repetition of words.Empanadas - Baked or deep fried... the world may never know. I am pretty sure they are baked because there wasn't a ton of oil on them and the overall mood I had eating them was... ""My arteries aren't clogging that much.""  The filling was delicious and paired well with the red salsa, that was fresh with the perfect amount of sweet shining through from the tomatoes.Guacamole - The chips were really good and the guacamole was even better. Hints of lime salt, onion, and cilantro in every bite and it was great putting it on the tacos and the empanadas.Chicken Tacos - Mmmmmmm these were very good. Jalapeno salsa, the chicken was perfectly cooked and tender. Hot as a mofo but besides that I enjoyed every bite. My lack of patience as always led to a scolding hot mouth. It was totally worth it though.Flan - Was probably the least delicious thing about this place but it was still good. I prefer my flan chilled and more custard like. This was between custard and pudding and was pretty warm. I still like it but... I guess I am just a purist... a purist would like chilled flan right? Right?!THE VERDICT:Loved every bite at this place and I am super happy that we went here.

3.0,4/4/2017,"Some may argue that Restaurant Week is not the best time to go to a place for the first time and truly gauge what it's like. But I'd counter that if a place signs up for Restaurant Week, they should be prepared to give the same food and service as at any other time because there are tons of potential new regulars that are coming in during that time. In any case, ABC Cocina's Restaurant Week menu featured items on their regular a la carte menu so I was pretty confident that it was an accurate representation. And based on my 3-course lunch a while back, I just have to say that it didn't live up to the hype for me. For my first course, I got the raw shaved fluke, which I thought sounded interesting because it came with crispy rice puffs. Those little puffs were a nice treat on the tongue, but overall the ceviche (because that's basically what this dish is), was way too salty and that kind of overwhelmed everything else. For my 'main' course (I put in quotes because it's pretty tiny), I got the mushroom tacos topped with kale. These actually weren't bad and are a nice alternative to non-meat eaters who are in the mood for a taco. But Is it worth the $14 they charge on the regular menu? No way. For dessert we had a choice of vanilla doughnuts or flan so we were able to taste a bit of both at the table. The doughnuts were pretty tasty, very similar to a Japanese cream puff, but both were unremarkable. They do have it down when it comes to decor and ambiance. It's no wonder, since they're attached to the very famous home decor store and probably source everything from there, which means that every plate we used probably goes for about $50 retail. The service was also friendly, which unfortunately isn't always the case when you go in for Restaurant Week. They allowed some of us to order a la carte and others to do the pre fixe (which I now see on their permanent menu at $33, which I believe is actually cheaper than the Restaurant Week cost of $35 so therefore it wasn't a deal for us at all which is super annoying). For as hard as it is to get a table or a reservation here, the ambiance and trendiness did not make up for the lackluster food.",10,5,6,Christina P.,"Culver City, CA",4723,2090,4060
2.0,3/28/2017,"I've heard alot of great things about ABC and it's been on my list of must try restaurants for a few years now. Unfortunately my first (and probably last) visit was a let down. To be clear, I did visit during restaurant week so I'm not sure if I had a truly authentic experience. But at the same time, you'd think that out of three courses even one would be impressive. I wasn't really feeling anything that I ate. Brussel sprouts were probably the highlight of the meal, but still underwhelming. They weren't crispy and didn't have alot of flavor. The Mexican lasagna was mushy and tasted (and looked) like a frozen dinner. I love lasagna with lots of cheese (who doesn't?) and there was only a teeny little bit of cheese on top. The meal ended with cream puffs which were again, not good. The shell was a bit stale and flavorless, and the inside tasted like cool whip. This was not a decadent dessert by any means. Maybe I ordered wrong and maybe restaurant week is not the best way to get a pulse on ABC.

4.0,3/27/2017,"If you leave this restaurant without getting the Gooey Spicy Ham and Cheese Fritters, you've fucked up. Beyond that, you're on your own. The menu is much more extensive than I would've thought, and there are plenty of decisions to be made (especially if dishes are meant to be shared, as they tell you). I can tell you that the quality of their kitchen is excellent, but you've got to make your own choices when it comes to what you are interested in. I've landed on hits and misses, but to be fair, it's never the execution that is off, merely flavor combinations or choices that I didn't necessarily love. For instance, the crispy fish sandwich is impeccably fried, but the black olive sauce didn't exactly work for me. A salsa with some sweetness might put it over the top, but who am I to tell them what to make? The Mexican Lasagna is a winner, but I can't quite get over the fact that I'd rather have pasta than corn tortillas in there. (Obviously, this is a cocina, not a kitchen, but there it is.) Tacos are not gigantic portions by any means, but I don't think you'll be sad. And I'm not normally a dessert man, but their fritter game is top notch (as we already know), and the impossible flan is nothing to sneeze at.

3.0,3/5/2017,"Atmosphere: 3.5/5 - Let's start with the basics. Clean. Cute. Bustling. BUSY (make a reservation). The tables were a bit small and tight, making it hard to fit plates on the table and impossible to avoid bumping elbows with the person at the table next to you when trying to grab your drink or utilize cutlery. I'm a very slim man, and we had to pull the table out for me to fit in and out. Other than that, it is a very nice space. Cozy industrial. Very trendy. From the second you walk in through the giant curtained wooden doors, you feel like you are at Sunday brunch. And the hostesses were lovely, complimenting our outfits and offering to check our coats with bright smiles from the second we walked in, and asking how everything was when we were heading out (something that does not go unnoticed).Fare: 4/5 - The food was very good, as expected from a Jean-Georges restaurant. We went for brunch and they started us off with baskets of housemade sourdough and foccacia breads, olive oil, sea salt, etc etc.  We ordered a basic cheese and meat plate to start, along with some cocktails. Then we moved on to entrees, of which I HIGHLY recommend the Mexican Crusted French Toast. I was sitting in brunch envy because my companion ordered it, while I went with the coconut pancakes with lavender syrup (also delicious). We did not make it to dessert, and here's why...Service: 1/5 (and that's a high score) - Absolutely terrible. Aside from the aforementioned hostesses, nobody paid an iota of attention to us after we ordered. I finished my first cocktail about 20 minutes after being seated, and nobody ever came to either take the glass away or ask if I wanted another (even though I flagged down another server and asked for a cocktail menu...which never came). And I did. I really wanted another. Because that's what one does at brunch. Sadly, I sat with an empty martini glass for the next 60 minutes. When we asked the busboy to have our server send the check (because we never saw our server again), the server brought it and said ""so thats it? no more drinks?"" and when i politely let him know I had been sitting with an empty glass for the last hour and nobody ever came to check on us despite me requesting our waiter twice, he laughed it off and said ""oh yeah sorry about that"" and walked away. Not cool man. Not cool. Don't F with my brunch cocktails.Overall: 3/5 - It could've been a 4.5/5, but the service just left a bad taste in my mouth after the delicious food. Weekend brunch should be relaxing and fun after working your ass off during the week, and the whole time I just felt myself getting more and more annoyed with the service and I couldn't wait to get the check and leave.

The woman working at the front check in of the restaurant was quite miserable and I almost felt as though I was burdening her by coming in! Afterwards however, the waitress was great. The ambiance was surely great and the restaurant is very nicely decorated.As for the food, it was OK although very, very small portions. Beginning with the guacamole, no complaints and definitely enough for 2-4 people to start with. The shaved brussel sprout salad and roasted beets were also good, however quite small/light. The patatas brava were almost comical, as there was 6 total very small bite-sized potatoes in the order. The crispy calamari also good, although very few in the order. The sautéed mushroom tacos were excellent and I would highly recommend. The beef ""burnt ends"" was the most disappointing dish as $22 for an EXTREMELY small amount (maybe 4-5 very small pieces in total) was quite absurd. Lastly, only order the vegetable rice if you like cumin as that was primarily the entire flavor of the dish.As for dessert, get the warm vanilla fritters!All in all the food was good, although quite expensive for what you get.

For food, we shared:- tomato salad with red onions, serrano chilies, sherry vinaigrette & herbs- raw shaved fluke with green chili dressing, crunchy rice & herb- crispy BBQ pork tacos, pickled pineapple & fresno chili relish- arroz con pollo, crackling skin & lemon zestMy favs were the tacos (so flavorful!) and the tomato salad (very refreshing). The arroz con pollo was highly recommended - not only by our server, but also by other fellow Yelpers. Unfortunately, it was a huge letdown for us. It tasted very very average - like something you could have cooked by yourself at home.

This is tapas, where you obligatorily order several dishes, enjoy each bite and be surrounded by beautiful decor. I went with 5 female friends for a birthday dinner and I think we ordered 10 dishes total. -Guacamole and chips: as other reviewers mentioned, you can't go wrong with it to begin with. It's so fresh.-Calamari: sorry this was disappointing. -Octopus: This was really tender and not chewy at all. That a bit spicy orange sauce went well with it.-Spicy (crunchy?) shrimp: too oily. -Maitake: this one came with ricotta cheese and was pretty good.-Brussels salad: Green Caesar salad and crispy Brussels on the top.-Squash: A bit oily.-lobster with rice: This plate finally eased my hunger lol!!!

When we asked it to be withdrawn of the bill the waiter started arguing with us in a very rude way. This made us so uncomfortable. Definitely not matching the standing of such a place in NYC.

5.0,1/31/2017,"I'm a freak for tapas. Obsessed. And I've been wanting to try ABC Cocina for a while. So when I was in town this past fall, I finally got a chance to have this wonderful dining experience. Let's start with the decor. The restaurant is beautiful and you could spend half the meal looking around at the space and ignoring your dining guest. Which I am 100 percent guilty of doing... They also own ABC Carpet & Home so this shouldn't be that much of a surprise but still. Great dining atmosphere. Now on to the food. Patatas Bravas are a must for me if I'm having tapas and these ones did not disappoint. The Raw Shaved Brussels Sprouts Salad was absolutely wonderful. Very fresh greens and great seasoning.  The shrimp in garlic and chili was cooked perfectly. The chipotle chicken tacos were probably my favorite dish and my friend dining with me had to wrestle them out of my hand. The arroz con pollo was also a beautiful dish that held true to the traditional elements but elevated the flavor. We ended with the tres leche cake, also wonderful. All in all, I would highly recommend this restaurant to a diner looking for traditional tapas with an elevated twist.

2.0,1/28/2017,"One word describes this place : DisappointingSeriously? This is a Jean-George restaurant?The guy that owns a 3-star Michelin?This reminds me of Guy Fieri's American Kitchen & Bar, where a famous chef lends his name to a place that should be no-where near it.When you walk in, you notice this place is HIP, with a dining area that looks like a contemporary apartment designed by IKEA, and a room full of obnoxiously loud 20-30 year old's, the loudest of which you will be inevitably seated next toYet somehow, this place is able to put out mediocre service and food, for gourmet prices, and STILL get such high ratings on Yelp. It's obvious most of these five stars come from folks who have never eaten at a nice restaurant before. The dishes are nothing special , and the prices of 15-25 for TAPAS PLATES is ridiculous for the size and quality. I like small plates but come on, you're getting 4 bites of average food for entree prices at any other restaurant. Even the waiter recommended 6 for two people... do the math. Here's a rundown of what we tried. Complimentary Bread - pretty decent focassia bread with olive oil. They definitely make an effort to make sure you always have a full bread basket here... maybe so you stay full and don't realize you're getting ripped off by the other food. White sangria - pretty delicious if you like mango juice with a hint of wine. For $46 a carafe you get about 4 glasses worth. But there is so little actual wine in it, you'll need to two to get even a little buzzed.Red sangria - way stronger sangria with a heavy red wine taste, but again they get ya by filling half the pitcher with alcohol soaked apple pieces. This is the one worth getting Guacamole and chips - I was weary of paying $15 for a tiny bowl of guacamole but it was actually pretty good. The chips are home made and they are real good. They supposedly offer unlimited chips but our waitress pretty much ignored that request so we ended up with half a bowl of guac left with no chips. Crab fritters - tiny fries crab cake balls with Chipotle mayo. These were pretty good. You get 4 per order. Potatoes Bravas - half assed Dennys style home fries. Terrible. So poorly made, the cook managed to put all the sauce on one single potato at the bottom of the bowl. Skip thisShort rib tacos -  Probably one of the best dishes of the night. But at $22 for two small tacos, these better be goodOctopus -  it was OK. I love seafood but ruined it is how they mix Chipotle sauce with prune jelly or whatever it was. What a weird combo. For a dish almost $30 I wouldn't really recommend. Ribs - would have loved to try these but our waiter said the kitchen forgot to actually make them, so we decided to forget about it rather than wait around ... Overall a pretty lame experience but we did learn one good thing: ABC Kitchen is right next door (they are connected) and has plenty of open tables at 10pm on a Friday night so you can easily get a table just walking inFor a million times better authentic spanish tapas experience I'd recommend Tia Pol in Chelsea.",1,0,1,John Z.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",97,399,266
5.0,1/20/2017,"ABC cocina is a New York gem. I've been to some of Jean-Georges restaurants and this was the best yet.The decor is beautiful, the various structures and lighting will be captivating even if your date is not.I liked the set up of the restaurant too, it's super crowded by the bar and entrance but dinner seating is comfortable. The staff is superb and attentive. They can read your mind. You're thinking where can I put my coat, boom... Someone asks about coat check. As you're thinking you want an other drink or the check the server somehow knows this and magically appears. If you ask the host something and her attention needs to be elsewhere someone else is there to assist you. The restaurant is popular and packed, but somehow you never wait for anything you may need.  How?!? I have no idea.So.... Food. What I tried;the tuna tartar, and guacamole both served with fresh tortilla chips made on site, the crispy Brussels sprouts, the brussel sprout salad. Please don't make me think of witty unique ways to describe this food, but let just say if I was nominated for a Nobel prize I'd skip the ceremony to have dinner here. The accoutrements compliment the blah blah blah. The food is scrumptious and mouth watering. I tried the pina colada, not the best I've ever had , yet pretty good.Dessert here isn't ""would you like to see the dessert menu"", it's ""what can I get you?"" DONT SKIP IT. I don't care if you are gluten free, getting surgery in the morning, allergic to wheat or sugar, bring an epipen and make dessert happen. I tried the warm vanilla fritters, and somewhere there was a chorus of angels singing. (Side note- no lame trio of staff singing happy birthday, a beautiful violinist accompanies your dessert.)Dessert is awesome, and large enough for 2 to share (or maybe I was just being polite. )When the waiter cleared dessert with one fritter on the plate my brain was saying nooooo noooo nooo, similar to the separation people must feel as they watch their lover leaving to war.

The salmon was tender and fresh and the dill yogurt it was served on was the perfect accompaniment Crispy Brussel sprouts with creamy blue cheese- the perfect amount of crispiness paired with blue cheese. Anything with blue cheese will win me over but if you're not as big a fan, the cheese comes on the side for you to drizzle (or not) Beet leaves with jamon- what are beet leaves? I didn't know either that's why I ordered it. Expected large leaves with a slice of jamon. Instead it was minced spinach looking greens with minced fried jamon. Drizzle with lemon and it's good but a little on the oily sideFish tacos- after living in SoCal, I typically put fish tacos to the side in preference of trying them. My friend wanted these so we got them and they were actually amazing. On the very slight spicy side wth the chipotle aioli but with the pickled cabbage(?) it all went together so wellDessert! Tres leche with cranberries and pears- this didn't taste like traditional tres leche. It was topped with heaping cinnamon merengue which added a tangy spicy flavor that was contrary to the norm but amazing ! Ps.

There were two different types of bread one of which was made on premises. The bread was nothing special nor was the dipping oil. The first tacos to come out were the fish tacos. You have a choice of grilled or fried fish. We opted for the grilled fish. You only get tacos. However, it was filled with a good amount of fish and toppings. It comes with a spicy sauce. The fish was perfectly grilled and the taco was delicious. The next taco served was a mushroom taco. This too was delicious. There were only two but they were nicely stuffed. The cold king crab leg came out next. It was nicely presented in a bowl of ice. It was cracked so the crab meat was easy to remove from the shell. It was served with a mustard sauce. The crab meat was a little soft for my taste. Our final taco was filled with shirt ribs. It was topped with some type of onion rings. The onion rings reminded me of the ones you get in the can.

It would not have made any difference because the same sauce was used in both and the amount of salt used made them inetable.  Perhaps they were different sauces but it was hard to tell with the salt. The Arroz con Pollo (chicken rice) was very good as was the salad and the passion fruit margarita. The Patatas Bravas (potatoes) were very average. I make better ones and I'm a lousy cook. It was a good thing that the waiter's assistant came by often to refill the water glasses. That's needed to counter the SALT in the food. Holly Cow! The waiter was cordial enough to not charge for one of the taco dishes.  Woo hoo.  We eat out a lot and have to say this is one of the worse meals we've had in a long time. We would have been better off at Chipotle around the corner.  If you like lots and lots of salt in your food, this is the place for you. Otherwise, This place was a big bust!!! Did I say this place uses tons of salt in the food? Just making sure.  Read previous reviews as well. We failed to do so and were not forewarned.",1,0,0,max g.,"Camarillo, CA",3,55,0

We sat at at the bar for 30 minutes and luckily we were seated rather quickly. The hostess was so nice!

2.0,9/18/2016,"I will preface my low star review by saying that the the atmosphere is chic and nice, and overall the food was good - actually probably very good across the eight or so things that our party of three ordered, not great in a serious sense, but as one comes here to dine in a chic new New York Flatiron neighborhood aren't-we-just-the-bomb kind of joint, then very good is a nice enough result.  And prices were not out of whack.But the service as relates to the bizarre handling of bottled wine presentation, mis- or total lack of communication (or outright lying) about the fact that they show you the closed bottle that you ordered and then disappear with it to the bar to open it before returning to start pouring, and especially weak management of our confusion and questions over this by their floor manager...yikes, awkward, poor and inconsistent answers, I would fire everyone involved if this was my staff and I watched it on a hidden cam.  I have been in the wine business for 35 years and have never had someone in any restaurant in 20 countries take two $65 bottles of wine away from my table to open them out of my sight at the bar, first telling us that she was struggling with the cork and almost broke her hand or some nonsense, then sending a manager to us to instead explain that this is John George's way of doing it and that it has ""worked for him for a million years internationally""; and finally hand me the check like the bum's rush because the wacko answers were making me nuts - removing the $130 for the two bottles, which was never the issue and I gave that same $130 as a cash tip to our server to prove that - who barely could muster a thank you.No kidding - what a strange gig.  I could never see myself returning here, nor will my business associate from Portugal or any of his international wine associates, who are all in and out of NYC frequently.  It was kind of a Twilight Zone sort of experience.  Boo-dee-doo-doo.",2,0,0,Keith J.,"Blaine, WA",0,34,2
2.0,9/15/2016,"ABC CocinaAs a frequent traveler to Manhattan, I'm always looking forward to trying new restaurants. A friend whom lives in NYC had mentioned ABC Cocina to me a while back, and I earmarked it as a must-try for brunch. Knowing that ABC Cocina is an off-shoot of multi-Michelin Star Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's ABC Kitchen, I had elevated expectations. But as they say, expectation is the root of all disappointment. We ordered a variety of food, tried some cocktails, and soaked in the service. We found the food overly salted, the cocktails simplistic and over-priced, and the service shoddy. We dined in September 2016. See below for a more detailed review. Reservations:Within only an hour or two of dining, I made a brunch reservation via OpenTable. The fact that reservations were so plentiful should have been an indication to choose another restaurant.  Décor:The atmosphere consisted of exposed concrete walls and flooring, exposed wooden ceiling beams, and multiple chandeliers. Overall, the atmosphere was very intriguing, and we checking it all out. Libations:Being a Latin-themed restaurant, our waitress immediately directed us to their margaritas. Not being the biggest marg fans, we opted for Bloody Mary's (a Sunday brunch staple right? Wrong). One Bloody Mary we ordered had beer as the alcohol base with the standard tomato mix; the waitress made it sound delicious, but it tasted like carbonated tomato juice-- not very good. The other Bloody Mary we ordered was a ""classic"" with vodka, which turned out to be completely uninspired and boring. Both cocktails lacked any visual excitement and were very generic in appearance. These drinks were not listed on the menu, so I am not sure of their exact names. Both were overpriced and underwhelming. Bread:We were served a selection of sour dough bread and very greasy focaccia bread with oil. Tapas:ABC Cocina is a Latin tapas-style place. The waitress recommended ordering 3-4 dishes each-- this is too much. For a party of two, ordering 3-4 dishes is more than plenty, given the bread, cocktails, etc. We ordered Sautéed beet leaves with jamón ibérico and lemon, which was soaked in salt with small pieces of grizzly meat. The charred octopus with smoked paprika, crème fraîche, and guajillo vinaigrette sounded amazing, but arrived heavily blackened and again, excessively sodium-laden. The crunchy Mexican spiced French toast with glazed strawberries was the best dish of the day. It was moist, beautifully presented, and an overall delectable indulgence.Every single dish was exceedingly salty. Our taste buds and mouths were inundated with sodium! The only dish worth consuming was the Mexican French toast. It was rich, moist, and delicious! As we came for brunch, I regret not ordering all brunch food (although the brunch section on the menu was limited). I had wanted to also order the coconut pancakes, but I was instead tempted by the other Latin tapas offerings. I would order the coconut pancakes next time, but there will not be a next time for me at this restaurant.  Service:Our waitress was hurried in her actions, always appearing rushed and absent-minded (although the restaurant had empty tables). I don't expect much in the way of service anymore unless it's a Michelin-rated establishment. However, I do expect to be served the correct dishes. Toward the end of the meal, we realized the waitress forgot to serve us a dish, which lo and behold, appeared on our check. We brought this to her attention; she briefly questioned us and appeared bewildered and disbelieving. If the dish was on the check, it had to be somewhere, perhaps left on the kitchen pass? One will never know. She offered for us to take it home, but we happily declined. After all, it was a blessing that she forgot to serve this dish, as our sodium levels were high enough to induce hypertension. She ultimately removed the charge from the subsequent check. Summary:ABC Cocina left us disappointed and with the need to guzzle water for hours thereafter. One would certainly not know that this restaurant is an off-shoot of those under the guise of famed Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. The food and cocktails were abysmal (save the French toast), and the waitress fell short in her service. My Recommendation:Skip. NYC has endless dining options, so if an establishment falls quite short, there is no need to dine there; one time is one too many. 2 stars",1,0,0,Brad D.,"New York, NY",0,9,69

I've also had the crispy fish sandwich with black olive tartar sauce, chilies and arugula, which was decent but lacking flavor and a bit on the mushy side.

The dishes were great, lots of flavor and beautifully plated. The only thing stopping me from leaving a 5-star review was our waitress. We ordered oysters as an appetizer for the table- two of our main courses came out first (and one at a time). When we asked about the oysters, she blamed a slow cook in the kitchen and ignored our request to keep the other dishes in the kitchen. My friend and I have worked in restaurants across NYC, and you never blame anything on the kitchen, especially at a restaurant like this. Pretty tacky move. The other two main courses- sandwiches- came out 10 minutes after ours, and still before the appetizer. I get it, oysters take a while, that's why we ordered them as soon as we sat down and made it clear we wanted them before our main courses. That's what course lines are for. My friend and I also ordered a larger portion of wine, not by the glass,and we were given two half-glasses.  When we were finally able to ask her if there was more wine to the portion (we had everyone but her coming by our table), the waitress said she had taken the liberty of having bartender split a glass for us so we didn't have to do it ourselves. I started to explain we actually had a larger order, but she just left. What? I would've been more than happy to pay for more wine had she not run back to the server station.  This is a really lovely restaurant and everyone at the bar was very friendly- I don't know if this was just a bad shift for her or what, but it really skewed the experience.",0,0,0,Kit T.,"New York, NY",49,26,2

The decor is definitely eclectic... a mix match of items that looks like they came from garage sales, but that were selected and installed by a talented, top notch designer. The wait staff looks a bit like hipsters (one with bleach blond hair half shaved on one side) but they were very attentive and professional. They work hard at getting things right - I overheard a manager talking to a bus boy behind us on the finer points of clearing tables.The food here was a real treat - especially for a restaurant week menu, which can sometimes be disappointing. Things started with an excellent bread basket and seasoned olive oil - both of which were great. (Good bread is almost always a sign of more good stuff to come).I had the sweet corn and poblano soup as an appetizer. I'm usually not that much into soup but this was a real treat. For the entree I had the stewed chicken. This was a relatively simple dish (basically chicken soft tacos) but elevated to a whole 'nother level. Both the tortillas and chicken were way tastier than they had any right to be for such a simple dish. My only ""complaint"" about dessert was that there was too much of it. I had the vanilla fritters, but also was able to try the flan. Both were full sized desserts, which were a bit overwhelming, especially compared to the more moderately sized soup and entree. The fritter were really excellent. The flan was good but was perhaps the only thing I had that wasn't amazing.",0,1,0,Jon L.,"Forest Hills, NY",67,151,32
3.0,8/17/2016,"I was excited to check out this trendy spot after it appeared on countless lists as a must-try for Restaurant Week. Good job, whichever PR company reps ABC. Although I had a reservation for 2:30 I was able to sit at the bar around 1:00 p.m. I would say, as a patron visiting ABC Cocina solo, it was entertaining to listen to the braggadocious conversations that one is certain to find at a stylish haunt such as this. But onto my food - The shaved fluke appetizer was delicious - a citrusy olive oil laden explosion of flavor erupted in my mouth when I took the first bite. I would come back for this. After waiting for about 20 minutes, my main course arrived - the chimichurri grilled shrimp with quinoa, summer vegetables and mint. This is ordinarily one of the more expensive items on the regular lunch menu and is the reason why I ordered this dish. It was very good - the shrimp had a nice char and the vegetables were bright, crisp and incredibly fresh. However, the serving size was clearly made for the fashionable waifs who generally patronize this restaurant. Me on the other hand - I could have had a second plate of this. There was a mix up with my dessert order and I got to try both the vanilla fitters with Mexican chocolate, along with the flan, which I had originally ordered and quickly changed once I'd seen it served on other tables. Both items were okay, and necessary to fill me up after the modest portion of food I ate as a main course.I'm glad I was able to check this place out but likely won't return unless someone else - or someone's company - is paying.",4,2,2,Sierra B.,"Queens, NY",608,115,247

Portion sizes were good for NYC tapas and the desserts were larger than expected (the chocolate peanut butter sundae with strawberry sorbet was on point).

We added a third person - no problem. We were seated in a little corner nook that was rather nice... except the lights above us began flickering bad. We're not talking pirates-of-the-caribbean-quaint-candle-flicker, we're talking holy-crap-is-this-a-strobe-light-wtf. First we were going to move tables, but then it calmed down a little so we decided to suck it up. We ordered our apps and not long after, the manager lady came over and told us she could fix the light. Hey! That's nice. She fiddled with some lighting (this place uses light as an art installation) and we were good to go. On top of that, we were given a complimentary plate of cookies along with the dessert we ordered (some vanilla puff fritter things that were tasty).The hits food wide for us were: short rib tacos, everybody loved it. I loved the grilled fish tacos. The habanero sauce that came with the table was my husband's favorite thing ever and he blew through a bottle and a half. The patatas bravas were good but imho, could use more sauce so ask for some on the side.

4.0,7/26/2016,We went for lunch today and where very pleasantly surprised by the good food that was delivered to the table. We started with the Guacamole was excellent and a very nice size portion. The Fluke was as good as Most sashimi with a nice crunchy element. The crunchy fish tacos were outstanding but spicy so if you don't like too much heat order the sauce on the side. Sangria was very good.  Deserts were excellent Flan and fritters. Service was lacking a bit of professionalism. Food comes out too fast so order in shifts.  The management was sensitive to food coming out too fast and even comped a desert.,0,0,0,Ivan K.,"Manhattan, NY",73,84,552

But in the end it's a $40 lobster... Mexcal cured salmon also looked super delectable.   Cocktail list was obviously centered on lation American flavors.  I was pleased to see cachaça on the spirits list and they bar was able to make a great caiparinha.",2,1,1,Christine A.,"Hoboken, NJ",89,271,158

3.0,7/5/2016,"After having an amazing brunch at ABC Kitchen (and peeking at ABC Cocina), I've been dying to come here for over a year. I finally came here for a pre-show dinner before Fuerza Bruta with a friend. We had no trouble getting reservations for a 6:30pm dinner but it may be because we booked weeks in advance. The place was pretty busy. First, we started out with the guac with peas and complimentary bread. OMG both of these were so good! The guac and bread were my favorite parts of our meal. The dinner went downhill from there though...We ordered the ""chef's favorite"" according to our waitress, which was a shrimp dish with bananas in it. DO NOT GET THIS. I think they were trying to go for that unique flavor but I really didn't like it at all. I was tempted to try because it sounded so different but yeah... no. Don't do it. The octopus was OK, nothing wrong with it at all. If anything, I thought it was a tad bit too salty... and I've had better octopus elsewhere. The potatoes that came with the dish were pretty good.Lastly, the arroz con pollo. This is the single most popular dish here but I really don't understand why. It was flavorful but SO watery... I wasn't a fan. Overall, I really loved the atmosphere and the trendy vibe of the place, but if I come back, I would most likely just do drinks and appetizers, not dinner. 3.5 stars.",2,0,2,Dasle K.,"New York, NY",703,281,1960

That's it. :( I had to flag down another waiter and ask about the other missing ingredients as I have eaten this dish before. Halfway through my meal another waiter dropped off a side of beans with onions and herbs. Thanks, too late folks, the other half of my breakfast was already cold. My friend's French Toast was equally disappointing. Unfortunately, for the restaurant, they didn't forget any major ingredients, so there's no reason why it was a failure. As my friend described, ""it was blandly sugar-soaked bread"" or something along those lines, he had to try hard to finish it, because he was hungry.

1.0,5/4/2016,"I was running late on a Friday night reservation. It wasn't overtly crowded so my date was already seated when I arrived. I had heard about this restaurant from a few friends but it wasn't until one night while strolling through the neighborhood, I saw the restaurant, that my interest was finally piqued.The place is gorgeous but a bit loud. We ordered the olives, cured salmon, patatas bravas, beef empanadas and charred octopus. When the charred octopus arrived roughly 20 minutes after we finished eating the rest, we were almost ready to leave. I took a bite and it was cold. My date and I debated whether or not to tell the waitress. We decided to do so, if a restaurant that claims to be ""passionate and committed to great food"" and charges you $$$ for that, they should know when something is not right. It took another five minutes to track down our waitress, of course. When she came, I asked her if the dish was supposed to be cold. She apologized, said it wasn't supposed to be cold and that she would bring us a new one. Alas! I wish that was true, they reheated the same plate and just added additional sauce on top which made it impossible to eat because now it was jut too salty. At this time, I was too disappointed to order dessert but we had wanted to try their warm fritters so we gave them another chance. Big mistake. They were warm once alright but not when they arrived at our table.  Our waitress was very pleasant but it seemed like all the servers here were very relaxed, taking their sweet time...to bring the menu...to bring the water...to get our order.....to bring the meal ....and even to bring the check.

3.0,5/2/2016,"Made a reservation here a month in advance for a nice Friday dinner with my mom. The place is a little hard to find from the street, due to the fact that there isn't a huge sign anywhere. We were seated right away and were told by our waitress that 4-6 entrees is standard for 2 people to share. Upon recommendations and previous reviews, we ordered guacamole, fish tacos, asparagus salad, grilled sea bass, and crab fritters. Word to the wise, everything is spicy! It was impossible not to find something on the menu that wasn't seasoned with cayenne or jalapeno. The sea bass was by far the best with guacamole in second, but the majority of the other food was masked by heavy seasoning. For the price tag, we were expecting to enjoy the food more than the gentlemen who continued to refill our water glasses. In terms of wait staff, everyone was very friendly. Our waitress was knowledgeable and checked in on us frequently. The ambience itself is cool and trendy. The place is very industrial looking with chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. The place is incredibly noisy, though, and you are on top of the people next o you. I definitely wouldn't recommend coming here for an intimate/get-to-know someone setting.

Literally their attempt to play with Queso as a dish came in the form of melted Gruyere cheese with broccoli and cauliflower to dip in it. It looked more like something that would be whipped up in a dorm room at 3a than an $18 small plate dish in the Flatiron. The short rib tacos were fantastic.In summary, it's not clear if ABC Cocina wants to be Spanish, Mexican, and brands its menu as Latin fusion.

Anyway, we had the shrimp with garlic and chili oil, charred octopus, huevos rancheros and the griddled shrimp tacos. It was all pretty delicious with the octopus being my favorite. They do seafood pretty well and it all tasted pretty fresh. Definitely a cute spot to impress yor date. The space is also linked to abc kitchen and abc home so it's nice to pop in the furniture store after to take a look around at ridiculously overpriced homemade furniture.

Also, the drinks we ordered had nice scent to it that elevated the whole tastes. I really enjoyed the fish taco. Loved the sauce that went inside. The cabbage was pickled just right and the fish was cooked amazingly well. Octopus was okay, it wasn't amazing (partly because it was over cooked and bit too salty) The empanada was okay as well. It wasn't amazingly good for what it costed. I enjoyed the dining experience  itself because of the mood and the design, but overall good was so-so.",0,0,0,Jane H.,"New York, NY",289,51,213

3.0,3/13/2016,"I came here with a group of 8 girlfriends for a fun dinner. I made reservations 30 days out and the reservationists was really friendly and helpful. Although I had to change the number in my party, there was never a problem with the reservation and they were very accommodating. Loved the decor (maybe a little more than abc kitchen) and the service was great. I had a grapefruit margarita which was delish and my girlfriends shared a mango sangria which they all loved. We ordered about 12-14 things total, and while I thought it may not be enough for all of us, we were all very full at the end of the night. Loves: shaved fluke, charred octopus, arroz con polloGood, not great: guac, patatas bravas, crispy Brussels sprouts, shrimp with sizzling garlic and chili oilMaybe not worth it: empanadas and tacosI was bummed they didn't have the baby back ribs that night.

4.0,3/12/2016,"I'm glad I came here with an Open Table gift card so we were able to try multiple plates. I made a reservation for 1pm on a Saturday. The place seemed really popular and packed. Best make a reservation beforehand especially for brunch hours on the weekend.The food overall was very tangy. We received complimentary focaccia and sourdough bread which was very buttery. Olive oil not needed for this bread.Kabocha squash and smoked mozzarella empanadas - Sweet from the kabocha and sour and tangy from the dipping sauce. Definitely my favorite item ordered. The kabocha combined with the mozzarella reminded me of hot pockets but with a flakier better crust. Sautéed mushroom tacos, cashews, mole, kale and lime - I really enjoyed the tacos. The mushroom flavors came through and the tangy sauce matched this one. The corn tortillas were soft and somewhat soggy but definitely a healthy and tasty taco.Jamon iberico de bellota - Nothing much to say about this, except that was some high quality ham. If you're looking to splurge this is one appetizer to order.Maitake mushrooms with goat cheese, fresno pepper vinaigrette - I was kind of disappointed with this dish. I had this amazing maitake mushroom before where the mushroom flavor really permeated. This one wasn't as good. Too overly charred and the goat cheese pairing doesn't match. Neither did the tangy sauce underneath. I did lik the sauce separately, but I thought it overpowered mushroom flavor. Mezcal cured salmon, cucumber-yogurt relish and golden potato flakes - I don't really like creamy things, so we got this dish purely for my boyfriend, which he seemed to enjoy. The yogurt is kind of like tzatziki sauce.Expensive, but great place for a tapas style meal. Next up ABC Kitchen!",10,5,7,Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",479,885,4955

4.0,3/8/2016,"There is no shortage of incredible imagination at ABC Cocina.  As if the to-be-expected killer decor wasn't enough, pretty much all the small plates brought something new to the senses.  To be fair, we were off to a slightly rocky start with drinks that lacked some bite: a lavender negroni seemed to lack any discernible lavender flavor and the tangerine caipirinha resembled Sunny Delight on the rocks - I swapped the latter for a Hendricks martini and all was well with the world again.  Our food started with some sourdough with some spicy olive oil - terrific.  The cheese plate came with some exceptional cheeses with names I will never remember.  Then we got a spicy white shrimp with bananas, and the bananas proved to be a fantastic foil to the bite of the spicy sauce.  The beef tenderloin with chimiccurri worked in large part due to the chimiccurri.  We finished off with two types of tacos - the griddled fish taco that blew us away with mint garnish, and the mushroom taco that came packed with flavorful kale.  When we were too full for dessert - but lusted after the peanut butter banana cream cookie - our amazing server dropped off the check with a lovely parting gift of two said cookies.  Absolute class.  Can't wait to come back to try all the other small plates on the menu - what a treat.",2,0,0,Des Y.,"Pelham, NY",0,38,4

The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the little touches (salt in a tiny bowl, flower arrangements) didn't go unnoticed by my usual clueless self.Service is friendly and food comes out as it's ready, which I love. Sometimes though the servers were literally playing tug of war with some of our nearly empty plates. I just wanted to beg them to let us finish our food before coming back again and again. It's almost like they wanted us to hurry up and finish, so they could turn over the table. Food is fantastic. Market Vegetables w/ Brown Rice - Amazing.Chimichurri Grilled Shrimp Salad - Quite possibly some of the best shrimp I've ever had.Fish Tacos - Delicious and a bit spicy, which I loved.Raw Shaved Fluke - I don't make it a habit to eat raw fish but I had a bite of this and it was delicious.Potatas Bravas - Really good but a bit greasy.

The french toast was one of the fluffiest french toasts I've had and was definitely worth the additional wait.

Overall was happy but wasn't super impressed by the food.ABC Cocina's decor was a highlight of the experience as well. The restaurant is whimsically decorated with unique chandeliers and ornaments.

3.0,2/28/2016,"Those who follow me know I avoid fancy restaurants when traveling alone. It seems easier to become disappointed. It rained in New York last Sunday night. I needed to move to a friends flat in Hell's Kitchen (10th Ave), my new lodging. It was 8 o'clock and I was hungry. I became the dreaded party of one in a white tablecloth restaurant. Every server runs from a one top, I should chosen the bar.I have mixed emotions writing a less than perfect review about -abc cocina- on 19th St. In the rain I was looking for a place name Craft, a farm to table restaurant. It seems that subtle window signage is the new look for the NYC restaurant world. Unable to locate Craft, I settled on this Latin American influenced kitchen by Michelin star Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. The food stood up to the Chef's reputation. Well thought out and expertly prepared. Described as small plates, they weren't  kidding. It was more like bite-size. I chose sautéed mushroom tacos, house made soft corn mini shells, cashews, mole, kale and lime. And crispy Brussels Sprouts with blue cheese aioli. The house made hot sauce is over the top. Ommegang Rare Vos Belgium  style ale, with hints of coriander accompanied. The service left something to be desired. The 20 minute table wait, in a near empty restaurant, followed by another 20 minutes before I was ordering a drink. Once I was assigned a server, the service improved. I was still hungry and would have ordered more if I hadn't already spent 2.5 hours getting a snack. Most solo dinners want to be on a fast track. I'd recommend -abc cocina- for a large group with shared plate's. $100 per person will go very fast. The food is very nice.",0,0,0,Grand L.,"Toledo, OH",278,2,7

That would have translated into a $90 steak! And lastly the Tropical Fruit Platter, a joke.  While a banana is indeed a tropical fruit, at ABC Cocina the Tropical Fruit Platter consists of 1 and 1/4 slices of banana paired with 1 and 1/2 slices of orange and kiwi, mixed up in canned fruit salad fashion over tiny bits of bland looking pale pieces of unidentifiable fruit.  It made the trimmings on a McDonald's greasy burger look elegant in comparison! I never send food back, but this time I picked the platter up and brought it to the manager's attention, asking if many people had been ordering that.  With a poker face and not even a hint of an apology, she responded: ""we're transitioning it in"".  My friendly suggestion: transition it out as soon as you possibly can, together with the pastry chef who forgot that presentation is part of the dining out experience.",1,2,0,G S.,"New York, NY",1,6,0

Tacos had a nice kick to it - the pickled cabbage was very acidic...had to pick some off- Chorizo - nothing special ...just a good spicy sausage...will skip this next time- Cocktails are good here but a bit overpriced for what they areI've had the guac here before as well and it was fantastic.

Then we ended with the sweets - French toast and coconut pancakes. Aside from the octopus being slightly on the dry side and the fish taco tortilla being too flaky, everything was quite tasty. However, I'm not sure they're worth the hefty price. Overall, beautiful restaurant that I'd highly recommend for special occasions but be prepared to spend $$$.",3,1,1,Cindy G.,"New York, NY",916,401,423
5.0,12/18/2015,Excellent. The hostess was very accommodating and helpful to find a quiet table for our party of three plus child. The food was amazing! Especially enjoyed the octopus and the chicken soup. Wonderful cookies and tees leches cakes. Saw multiple families with kids. The place was packed but it didn't feel too loud/overwhelming. Great service also. Will be back,2,1,0,Veronika K.,"Beverly Hills, CA",23,52,4
5.0,12/13/2015,"We had a large group dinner at Cocina and I have to say that I am impressed with the ABC family restaurants. I liked the food at Cocina even more than at ABC Kitchen next door. We had a pre-arranged menu that included the following: cheese board, brussel sprout salad, cured salmon, shrimp, patatas bravas, squash and mozzarella empanadas, short rib tacos, mushroom with goat cheese, charred octopus, vegetable brown rice and (for dessert) tres leches cake with cranberry meringue and salted caramel flan. Everything was absolutely amazing, flavorful, inventive and delicious. If I had to choose my least favorite item out of all of the above, it would be the flan (I know, shocking!...me, not like a dessert...gasp!). Service was top-notch, we were well-cared for, plates were cleared appropriately, waters refilled, drinks replenished. Ambiance and decor was dreamy and romantic (see pics)...what more could you ask for? Do make advance reservations as this is one of NYC's hot spots!",4,0,3,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",992,902,770
2.0,12/13/2015,"I was sooooo excited to eat here and then left terribly disappointed!  I do not see the hype at all and those who are raving about this place, are either obsessed with the trendy vibe or like to show off and spend money. The ambiance is wonderful!  It is very trendy, dimly lit, beautiful decor and has a hip vibe with music playing.  The staff were hit or miss - wait staff were great bartenders lacked personality, barely cracked a smile. The drinks were wonderful!  Pumpkin sangria highly recommend! As well as the blood orange and passion fruit margarita.  And that is where my review changes...The food was just OK, not bad but not amazing - for the price and the difficulty of getting a reservation a place like this should blow your socks off and it didn't. Clams with baked bread - bread was burnt, clams were ok nothing exciting. Whitefish Ceviche - delish but nothing I couldn't get somewhere else Cheese fondue - tasted like they poured the bottle of salt into the cheese Squash and Smoked Mozzarella empanadas - just ok, lacked flavor other than the smokiness of the cheese Beef Tenderloin with Chimichurri - steak was excellent, melt in your mouth - the only dish worth getting excited over Lobster Rice - at $39 this dish was awful!!  Rice was mushy, flavors all wrong and lobster uncooked!  We complained and all they did was take $10 off the bill - a free dessert or a full comp would have been nice, considering we only ate the 4 small pieces of lobster from that dish! I don't know if we chose bad dishes, it was a bad day for the kitchen or the chef or the staff?  It seemed many people dining, knew the chef as he came out and hugged and kiss many of the people diningI would skip this place!!!",1,0,0,Jenni A.,"New York, NY",61,23,5

5.0,11/23/2015,"I've wanted to eat at ABC Kitchen or ABC Cocina for such a long time, but I had never had the chance to. Luckily my wife spotted a reservation slot right at opening time for weekend brunch, and off we were to a restaurant that is hardly conspicuous from the outside unless you are really paying attention - I've walked by 19th and Broadway countless times, and it never even once occurred to me that the restaurant's storefront was not that far off. The ambiance is one of trendiness mixed in with the feeling of faded Flatiron glory; the crumbling seashells growing out of the beams and the walls is a rustic yet fantastical touch. We were seated in the very front window - almost like a display - but it didn't feel awkward at all, and if anything, is a bit more intimate than the rest of the dining room. Our food was brought promptly but not so quickly that the table got crowded. There's a very solid cocktail and drinks menu; I went with a pisco-infused cocktail that highlighted the liquor while being soothed over by hibiscus.For brunch, we ended up sharing all the dishes, getting a few of the smaller plates and a couple larger ones to share. We started off with the guacamole, which I liked a lot - very fresh and sprinkled with things like microgreens that you wouldn't find in the strictly traditional version of the dish. The grapefruit salsa was the only thing that was really a tad off the entire meal...it was overly sweet, i.e. didn't capture the acidity of the fruit, and it didn't mesh well with the creaminess of the avocado. Next up was the shaved brussel sprout salad, served with the goat cheese on bottom and tiny croutons sprinkled throughout. This was really good; I rarely eat brussel sprouts raw, but they tasted very quite nice, and I liked the concept of flipping over the salad and scooping it up with a spoon. We followed that with the croquettes - excellently done, with a gooey (but not overly hot) center and some kind of spiced aioli sauce that gave it a nice Mexican overtone - a good dish to go with a big, bold sauce. Our last small plate was the baby calamari salad with chorizo. The calamari had good texture, but it was a tad hard to really taste given the small portion, and the salad itself didn't stand out as much compared to the brussel sprouts.Both main dishes, though, were glorious. We did the savory chicken rice, and it's hard to say that I've ever had any better Mexican-style or Mexican-inspired rice than this. The crisped skin mixed into the rice really adds nice bursts of flavor and texture, and the rice itself is so creamy and decadent that you almost forget you're chowing down on a staple food. The chicken that is mixed in is also incredibly tasty as well - extremely moist and flavorful. Lastly, we ended on a sweet note and went with the Mexican French toast...definitely one of the best renditions of this classic brunch dish. The inside of the toast is slightly gooey and undercooked, making it delightful to get a bite of, but the outside is extra-crispy with a good amount of crunch to perfectly offset the inner texture. The apples are a nice touch, but I could probably just eat the toast unvarnished, even without syrup - it was that good.The price probably runs a bit above where your standard NYC brunch comes in (not that that is cheap to begin with), but it's money well spent. A fantastic, cosmopolitan take on Latino cuisine in the confines of brunch was incredibly well-done, and I cannot wait to come back to try out their dinner options sometime!",3,2,1,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

3.0,11/8/2015,Loved this place before but see a dramatic decrease in food quality. The service is still great but the best part of the dinner was the fried peanuts.

3.0,11/5/2015,"I believe that I had high-expectations for this place since Pipa (the restaurant before ABC Cocina) was one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. I have been here more than 3 times. The food is ok, but it just did not impress me and I think some of them are overpriced (Guacamole is $15.00) and they lost the coziness that Pipa had. Pipa had amazing vintage chandeliers all over the ceiling and ABC Cocina changed into modern lightings that kind of look tacky all together. Although it was Spanish Taps place, the food was way better at Pipa too. I love Latin American food and I grew up with it, so I think this place is just over done. Also, every time I came here, I could barely hear my friends that I was sitting with since people were always talking so loud inside the restaurant (I don't know why). I might come back, but I honestly like ABC kitchen way better and obviously, I really miss Pipa!

The beef empanadas come as an order of two; great for two people to split or perfect for a small entree. They are extremely HOT so be careful. The sauce on the side didn't add much; the flavor of the meat is excellent and they are cooked perfectly.The salmon salad is also very nice; the salmon is very high quality and cooked medium rare so it is very delicate and flavorful. A nice size for a light lunch. My one piece of feedback is that it is quite pricey even for lunch given the portion size, so I would not come here if you're on a budget (it's a good lunch to expense, let me put it that way!).All in all, next time I want to meet someone for a casually elegant but not over-the-top lunch in Flatiron, I'll choose this place.",3,1,1,Lauren M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",464,81,4

I started dinner with their house margarita on the rocks. It packs a punch so make sure to give it a try. It tasted authentic and not like it was made with a premixer. A drink you must try is the smokey rose. I tried a sip of someone else's and immediately wished I had a full glass of it. The oysters were incredibly fresh and came with a good assortment of sauces. The guacamole is different from ones you've tasted before, but I thought it was one of the best I've ever had. You have to try their mezcal-cured salmon. It comes with crispy bits of potato and a cucumber yogurt sauce. That was the standout dish of the night. We wished we ordered more than one plate. Also, I'm usually not one to love tacos but their crispy BBQ tacos with pineapple relish had a great salty/sweet combination that worked well together.Tried their churros and flan for dessert. Their churros were great but I just didn't have any room to finish them. The flan was sent out on a ""happy anniversary"" plate by the waitress after asking what occasion we were there for.

The restaurant is popular for its Latin American Fusion. The ABC group of restaurants are definitely infamous for the creative food from chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten featuring local, organic ingredients. We were really excited to taste how this translated into Latin American cuisine.All in all, it was ok. I would recommend it if you have money to burn and don't mind if it is hit or miss. If you're tight with your wallet, and want to get the most delicious bang for you buck, you should pass.Service: attentive and surprised my husband with a birthday creme brûlée. They did not really offer any compelling recommendations for food or drink.Food: Average. The ingredients were definitely fresh, but none of the flavors were surprising or new. our favorites were the grilled corn and our friends loved the ham and cheese balls (not the official name). The octopus was a very small serving and was seasoned with what tasted like smoked paprika.  We were disappointed when we realized that 1/2 of the serving was potatoes and not the well-cooked charred octopus. The most original dessert was the almond cake, which was a favorite at the table. Since I have an almond allergy, so I tried the chocolate tart with spices. It rented my overall feelings on the restaurant, there was no flavor. I expected a rich, dark chocolate tart, with a little kick at the end. I got a rich, dark chocolate tart.Price: too expensive for what you get. Perhaps we should try a few more things on the menu, but overall, it was a high bill for standard fare.Ambiance: loved that it was not too loud. We could actually hear each other, which was awesome. Our seat was right by the door, but it didn't feel the least bit uncomfortable or busy.

3.0,8/24/2015,"IN SHORT: Borderless Latin fare from Jean Georges is served inside a home goods store, because apparently that's a thing.THE STORY: There's a joke in the gltizy western territory that I hail from (read: Los Angeles) that to pitch an idea for a show or a movie successfully, the concept must be presented as ""X famous Hollywood flick meets completely unrelated Y famous Hollywood flick.""Ready? Think ""Modern Family"" meets ""X-Men."" Imagine ""Sex and the City"" meets ""Two and a Half Men."" ""Grey's Anatomy"" meets ""Out of Africa."" Boom. You've got a production.ABC Cocina can be conceptualized a lot like that. Imagine if ""The Little Mermaid"" met ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona."" Now imagine that the entire movie was set in a restaurant inside ABC Carpet and Home in New York. Boom. You've got ABC Cocina.If that somehow doesn't sum up the experience entirely, I'll elaborate a little more.ABC Cocina is Jean-Georges' tribute to Latin-inspired cooking from around the world, all awkwardly forced to sit next to each other in a restaurant decorated with mystical bubbles of light, seashells, and jellyfish prints on the walls. It's a dark, loud, hip castle that takes its cue from influences far and wide, and while the lengthy list of dishes can sometimes feel ad hoc and might not contribute anything to the understanding or appreciation of Latin cuisine, a meal at ABC Cocina is still pretty hot.Almost every table chooses to begin their onslaught of small plates with the sweet pea guacamole, a fabulously verdant creation topped with fresh peas, pea leaves, and sunflower seeds for an added crunch. Warm, toasted tortilla chips are on the side to scoop heaping mounds of the creamy ""mock-amole"" spread because this is simply what every 20-something woman wants to do on a Girls' Night Out.The menu is divided into further categories that don't make any particular sense, but choosing one from each can help a table of two craft a meal that doesn't feel redundant. Although Light & Bright sounds like the theme of some college frat party, it is one of the more successful and popular groups from which to order. The mezcal cured salmon was like a smoky, seafood-focused interpretation of a green bean casserole, paired with a bountiful, thick cucumber yogurt relish and crispy potato flakes.From the Golden & Crispy crew, the peekytoe crab and corn fritters are less successful, unfortunately overpowered by a strong chipotle mayo, and in comparison to the rich, spicy shrimp with sizzling garlic and chili oil, are far inferior.Because this is a restaurant about Latin food, after all, tacos feature heavily under the Masa & Tortillas header, and surprisingly, some are actually quite good. The crispy fish tacos are served with a striking cabbage-chile pickle slaw, and are topped with a few threads of chopped mint for a seriously bewitching bite that is simultaneously herbal and spicy, all while highlighting the flaky fish itself. Our waiter also advertised the savory glazed short rib tacos and homemade chorizo sausage, though with over 45 items on the menu, it's impossible to enjoy everything in one sitting. Luckily, ABC Cocina is the type of fun, vibrant restaurant with casual, friendly service that makes each guest want to come back with a few friends or a date.We finally managed to end our meal in the Grilled & Roasted category with the grilled beef tenderloin sitting on a bright, salty chimichurri sauce. Although the meat was cooked perfectly pink and medium rare, the cuts were irregular and inconsistent across all 5 pieces, which itself was also a very strange number to serve a table of two.Ultimately, while the food at ABC Cocina might not break any boundaries or win any awards, the entire experience is of such high quality that it becomes an instantly enjoyable restaurant for a fun, lighthearted dinner with a little bit of sex appeal.It's just like I said, ""The Little Mermaid"" meets ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona."" Or something like that. You get the picture.",2,4,3,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245

2.0,8/13/2015,"Having went to ABC Kitchen, I was super excited to go to another one of Jean-Georges' ABC restaurants. A Latin American-inspired menu, the food was disappointingly mediocre while the portions were ""unsatisfyingly"" small. We ordered:1.) Raw Shaved Fluke: A big disappointment. The fluke was drowned in a super sour green chili dressing that made the fish taste like a lime. 2.) Patatas Bravas: Who can really screw up fried potatoes?! Mediocre at best, the potatoes only stood out with the spicy-tangy sauce.3.) Short rib tacos with fried onions: Smallest tacos ever.  While the short rib was moist and tasty, the soft shell was wet and messy to eat. Unnecessary add on of grease with the fried onions topping. 4.) Charred Octopus: Probably the most intriguing dish of all, the grilled leek and market potatoes went well with the perfectly charred octopus. The dish had a vinaigrette that was a bit too sour for my liking, but overall a decent dish. 5.) Tres Leches Cake: Poor to NO presentation! The cake tasted like how it looked. Lackluster! It was overly sweet and tasted like what you find in a grocery store. Zero stars for this dessert. Clearly, I am no fan of their food. How on earth did this restaurant get 4 stars is beyond my understanding and experience!Many of their tables up front are communal while private ones scattered in the back with reservations. The decor was modern and elegant, alike the other ABC restaurants. Perhaps, the chefs need a lesson or two from the interior designers about design and plating. The service wasn't really attentive as our waiter was missing for majority of our meal. We had to hunt her down in order to settle our bill. She seemed very impatient and provided no helpful recommendations pertaining to the menu. I am not sure if you get better service with a private table vs. a communal one, but if you must try this spot, I'll recommend making a reservation. Plus, the crowds in the communal tables are quite loud, especially since the tables are right next to the bar!

Pina colada: A bit sweet for my tastes, but nice, thick, textureEggs benedict: Amazing. Truly a delicious dish. Normally, eggs benedict is one of those dishes that is ""alright"" for me, since I tend to find it a bit bland. This one was not the case. They spices they used on the dish as well as the black bean salsa they serve with it elevates the dish to an entirely different level. So flavorful and distinct. I was very impressed.French toast: Toasted to perfection - fluffy on the inside, crispier on the outside. The french toast wasn't too overwhelmingly sweet and was absolutely addicting.Patatas bravas: Roast potatoes with a Latin American flair...so fantastic. Execution was great. My friend, who has been to Barcelona, said that these were almost just as good as the ones in Spain. Sauce was on point and I loved the rosemary aioli. Chocolate and coconut popsicle: Coconut sorbet and chocolate ice cream combo in popsicle form. Great dessert, and extremely refreshing.

Garlic shrimp - Expect this to be greasy since it's sitting in chili oil. Tasty but nothing special. Crispy chicken salad - A nice salad for lunch, but definitely not worth $25. The citrus vinaigrette is a little too citrusy/sour. The rest of the salad is pretty basic-- lettuce, radishes, cucumber, tomato. The fried chicken was delicious, but it wasn't an incredibly satisfying entree. Tres Leches - By far the best dessert!Rice Pudding - Tasty, and a great sized dessert to split. Flan - Not sure why it's called the ""impossible"" flan, but the flan was divine. The ambiance is by far the best part of the restaurant. It's absolutely beautiful.

We had movie tickets and this is right by the theater, convenience and my love for Mexican food were the two forces in play here. I saw the not yet infamous guacamole with peas on the menu and had to try it, and it was the best part of the meal. The queso dip was gross and tasted like it was from the frozen food aisle, the tacos were mediocre at best, and the bartender forgot to put an ingredient in my margarita which left it tasting like just tequila and seltzer. The good news is he realized this and brought me another one, he tried to take the screwed up one away but I'll be damned if I was gonna let him toss perfectly good tequila so I drank them both. I'm resourceful like that. Three stars because the service was good and I would give it another try. Wasn't completely disgusted, just disappointed.ALSO: if you call they answer the phone ""ABC Cocina"" which is super disappointing because you'd think they'd answer it ""Ah, Bae, Say Cocina"" considering it's a Mexican spin off of ABC Kitchen, right?

This past week I hit about 8 restaurants, ABC Concina was the biggest let down.Based on the reviews I have been looking forward to eating here, it's also a beautiful restaurant.  I know NYC is an expensive city but for the price point even for NYC standards I expected more... I was greatly disappointed  $17 for two tiny fish tacos, at one point I had to look for the fish!!!  The Shrimp with sizzling garlic and chili oil at $16 was ok, NO MUY BUENO, I had to take a second look at the menu to confirm garlic and chili were part of the ingredients.  For Latino food, this place LACKS FLAVOR, even the sangria was funky.  Service was as good as I expected. In the end I've had just as good if not better food from food trucks in California and paid 1/3 the price.  Also, the Fish Tacos at Pappasito's Cantina at DFW are almost identical, same price but more than 4 times the size, and they are DELICIOUS!!!  I always run to Pappasitos for their Fish Tacos on a layover at DFW, that how good they are. This is not Nuevo Latino, it's over priced Gringo Latino foo foo food.",1,0,0,Joseph M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,65,0

The waitress recommended 2-3 plates per person, so we ordered the Spring Peas Guacamole which was absolutely delicious and one of the best guac I've had. It was flavorful and with the perfect amount of spice. Then came the tuna avocado sashimi. Jean-Georges's raw fish is always on point - the tuna tasted so fresh and perfectly seasoned. Finally, we tried the famous chicken tacos and crab fritters. Both were piping hot and yummy. I liked the small tapas portions so I can sample different dishes without feeling too full.

1.0,5/29/2015,"This place is memorable for one reason only... How bleh it is.. It's borderline insulting. The ambience is very nice. Which means they spent a lot of money on ""sizzle""... Which means most of your meal price is to recouperate that initial cost  and not food quality. It shows. 6 of us for lunch spent a total of $360 so we got to try a lot... So you would think... Sadly the portions are tiny so 1 plate is only 2 small pieces.  (2 mediocre tacos for $15??) But I digress. The food is mediocre at best, although I will give credit where credit is due and say proteins were cooked to the proper consistency. The flavor? Nothing spectacular. Not gross, but exactly at expectations for a clean restaurant, of which there are hundreds in the city. The descriptions of the food are misleading, the patatas is just French fries with mayo and ketchup.  This place is all about marketing 101. Get you excited and convinced it will be amazing so you are predisposed to overlooking it's flaws. I swear the Mexican lasagna ""salsa"" is pre made... You end up paying a lot of money for average (at best) food in a really uppity environment...

3.0,5/17/2015,"I came here once about eight years ago with my parents and we loved it.  However, we finally decided to revisit ABC Cocina and to be honest, we were all pretty disappointed.  Yes the food is fancy shmancy, but taste-wise it's but a mere 6.5/10, and the service is beyond pretentious.  We had a 6:00pm reservation for a Sunday but arrived just after 5:30. The restaurant was empty but the hostess didn't want to seat us immediately because she wanted to ""finish with the 5:30 reservations,"" and asked us to wait at the bar (probably to get us to start spending money on drinks before actually sitting down, I hate this scam!).Anyway, sometime around 5:45 we were seated, the restaurant was still empty, mind you.  We ordered a bunch of tapas plates to share since that's what you do when you dine at ABC Cocina.Spring Pea Guacamole- It's their must-have signature dish everyone raves about.  It's good, not something that's out of this world extraordinary, but it's fresh.Charred Octopus- Solid dish.  Our favorite of the night.Ham and Cheese Fritters- I mean, who doesn't love ooeygooey melty fried cheesy foods?  Good, but SUPER hot so let them cool before you take a bite.Housemade Chorizo- Upon first bite I thought it would be good.  After chewing it for about three seconds it was extremely bland.Florida White Shrimp- Second favorite of the evening!  Who knew if you mix shrimp with bananas it would be good?  It also tastes similar to ceviche which is always a plus in my book.Patatas Bravas- My dad makes better.Arroz con Pollo- Horrible.  Yes, there was a lot of chicken but it was not here nor there.  Fail.  Fail.  Fail.  For the last dish that came out this was for sure a disappointment.Chocolate Creme Brûlée tart- Decent.  I mean, it's a sweet chocolate dessert, you can't really go wrong with that.As for the sangria...I had the red hibiscus and it was standard.ABC Cocina is a beautiful restaurant, but at the end of the day it's for those people who want to see-and-be-seen while feeling super important because they're dining at a Jean Georges restaurant.  I get it, I really do, but these types of places are simply not for me.",5,0,0,Jackie S.,"New York, NY",1004,802,3287

It was probably my favorite dish of the night.  I really liked the cabbage-chili pickle on this dish.- Mango Sangria was delicious.The okay:- The spring pea guacamole with warm crunchy tortillas looked gorgeous in pictures. As mentioned, they were good, but does not give a ""WOW"" effect. I actually thought the tortillas were the ones that made this dish work. They were freshly baked and were very crunchy. But disappointed because they didn't have the blood orange salsa like they used to. - The spiced ground beef and celery root empanadas with tomato salsa were as well decent. I think the tomato salsa was delicious and really brought out the flavor of the empanadas. - I felt the maitake mushrooms were great alone without the goat cheese.- Tres Leche for dessert was okay too, but nothing to write home about. The ""I'd passed on this one""- The patatas bravas with spicy-tangy sauce and rosemary aioli was the least appealing of all the dishes. It's basically home fries dressed up nicely. I wasn't impressed at all. -The chamomile and honey cocktail was way too strong for me. They really have to loosen up on the gin.

When I arrived, there was a short five minute wait for the table to be ready; during which I tried a fantastic ""Honey Suckle"" cocktail at the bar. It was pretty delicious and I would highly recommend it. When my party finally was seated, I was disappointed however to find that there was a huge pilar immediately adjacent to our table. This made it difficult for the third person in our party to participate in any conversation. The food here was the best part of the experience. We started with the guacamole and it was literally to die for.  The BBQ tacos I had for my main course we're also pretty good.   Service was just about average.  I also found it odd that the restaurant brings orders out at different times, regardless if they were ordered at the same together.

I really like the decor there.  It was pretty, with lots of different chandeliers, but also kind of rustic.  I loved they flowers they had on all the tables too.  I had a larger breakfast, so I wasn't starving.  The waitress suggested that we order 2-3 dished per person to share, so we ordered on the lighter side.  We started with drinks, I got the basil jalapeño margarita which had a good kick to it.  Then we put in a order for guacamole while we figured out the rest of our dishes.  The guacamole was good, and also had a kick to it.  It comes with the grapefruit salsa on the side that was really good too, and not really spicy.  Then we put in the rest of our order: raw shaved brussels sprouts salad, vermont shepherd cheese and macron almonds, baby calamari stuffed with chorizo, celery root, chickpeas and basil, chipotle chicken tacos, grilled jalapeño salsa, griddled fish tacos, aioli and cabbage-chili pickle, and market sweet potato and smoked cherry pepper empanadas with lemon yogurt.  Our waitress was very thorough in asking about allergies/aversions and alerting us of the spiciness of the dish. Everything was really good.  The fish tacos were really spicy!  I think it was the little peppers on top.  The chicken tacos were good, but I think the lingering spice from the fish tacos made it hard to fully enjoy them.  My favorite thing was the sweet potato empandas.  They were really good! and had a really nice smokey flavor.  The brussel sprouts were good, nothing amazing, but a nice dish.  Overall I enjoyed it, and left there sufficiently stuffed.  I think it is definitely more on the expensive side, but the food and service make it worth it.",0,0,0,Rachel W.,"Manhattan, NY",284,202,541

I was beyond excited for her happy news, yet the weight of picking just the right place for this special dinner fell upon my shoulders like an I-beam. After much internal deliberation, I decided to make reservations at ABC Cocina for their innovative menu and a very trendy yet classy ambience.We arrived on time and were seated right away at a two top. The restaurant was still very busy at 9PM on a weekday. The decor was very chic, as were the people that are and work there. If I had to sum up this place is a sentence, I would say that nothing about this place says ""middle age working class"". Not the barnacle art on the walls, not the attractive young waitstaff, and certainly not the portion sizes.That being said, no one ever came here for cheeseburger and fries. The menu featured dishes that were clearly concocted with much thought and planning. The cocktails, likewise, all sounded delicious. We ordered a mango flavored cocktail and a passion fruit cocktail. Both were very refreshing but the mango one had too smokey of an aftertaste for my girlfriend.Of their dishes, we tried the guacamole with grapefruit slices, patatas bravas, tenderloin in chimichurri, and arroz con pollo. Every one of those dishes was delicious. The guacamole was creamy and went very well with grapefruit. The patatas bravas were very crispy and were served with sauce on the side, a nice variation on the traditional style. The tenderloin was cooked to perfection with a zesty flavor profile. The arroz con pollo was the crowning jewel of the meal. The rice was extremely savory and the chicken was very tender. The prices are high and the portions are small, but in terms of flavor, I would say that a meal at ABC Cocina is worth every penny.",1,0,0,Peter K.,"Manhattan, NY",470,686,86
5.0,3/23/2015,"This is a late review.  All my reviews are but I can't cheat ABC Cocina of a great review so here I am.  My bf has been to ABC Kitchen more than a dozen of times so when I told him we're having our regular Thursday dinner date night here he thought it was the same place.  He got here 5 mins earlier than me and he was seated at the bar having a cocktail and convo with the friendly bartender.  As soon as I walked in they offered me a drink and told us to wait for a couple minutes to be seated.  They were trying to sit us in the middle but we requested if we can have a corner booth and our request was greatly accommodated.  ABC Cocina is a much bigger space than ABC Kitchen.  It has an industrial feel but still feel very cozy and there's warmth when you're having your dinner.  Food was amazing!!! You can taste the freshness of each ingredient.  Tasted like they just plucked the vegetables from the back garden and the fish was so fresh.  I'm not even a foodie, my bf is but I would come back to this restaurant in a heart beat.  We had the raw shaved brussel sprout salad... YUM...  the mezcal cured salmon... AMAZING... Grilled maitake mushrooms... COULDN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS.. the black bass... SOOOO GOOD... and the tuna burger....

3.0,3/20/2015,"Came here for Valentine's Day, was expecting a whole lot more based on the raving Yelp reviews and also the name of ABC Kitchen. So you can see my disappointment when its sister did not live up to its hype. Surely, the decor is hip and beautiful inside. Dark and romantic. But the lack of creativity really killed it for me. We had:- jamon iberico - it was just ok- florida white shrimp in agua diablo - very spicy, really liked the banana in it- crab fritters - get this- gooey spicy ham and cheese fritters (which looked exactly like the crab fritters but not as good) - charred octopus - some other not memorable dish- not memorable dessert of the day What really irked me was that they served almost every dish with the same orange chipotle mayo sauce.

They even gave us two seat options and let us choose!! When we sat down, we were greeted and served water so quickly. It was pretty busy but they seem to be on top of every table without forgetting anyone.My friend ordered the sautéed mushroom tacos and I had the chipotle chicken tacos through recommendation of my friend and I must say I never had chicken like that before...

3.0,3/10/2015,"ABC Cocina is the latin/mexican sister restaurant of ABC Kitchen, located on the other side of ABC Furniture Store.  Beautifully decorated with a very dark romantic vibe.   Sure, its already been over 2 yrs since this resto has opened but its still a hot table.  The Guacamole is a wonderful starter, but really nothing out of the ordinary.  Everything is a small plate concept, but regardless, on the smaller size based on the price point.They have daily specials so be on the look out for the lobster tacos, if they are available that night, be sure to order them,  Only 2 come for an order,  but you can add an extra taco (for a surcharge of course).Be sure to order the Vanilla Fritters for dessert, its sort of like a cream puff / zepole hybrid, very yummy!",0,0,0,Esther M.,"Manhattan, NY",3,39,0

4.0,3/10/2015,"Not sure why the reviews are so mixed - I had a great time here last night with two of my friends. We didn't have a reservation, showed up at 8:30 and were seated at 9. Love the decor: modern, sleek but somehow still cute and intimate. The dark metals are offset with delicate little vases with tiny pink buds. It's a wonderful balance between trendy and cozy. We all split the shrimp with chile oil, guacamole and chips, short rib tacos, and fish tacos. The short rib tacos were by far the best thing we had - almost sweet/savory the way hoisin sauce is (wonder if there was hoisin sauce in them...). The plates are small, but somehow quite filling. We only ordered those four dishes between the three of us and we were very satisfied. Fish tacos, shrimp, and guacamole were all good too, but really outdone by the short rib tacos. Service is very friendly, kind, funny, amiable...not sure how other people had such negative experiences.It's definitely pricey, so I wouldn't come back in a hurry, but definitely a great go-to spot that feels trendier than the area it's in.",0,0,0,Perry T.,"Manhattan, NY",100,444,0
5.0,3/7/2015,"I would give 4 stars for the food and service as everything ordered was delicious and service was on point. Nothing was ""to die for"" but what really sold me on the 5 star experience was the soundtrack they had bumpin' in the background! Initially, I was enjoying my Pinot noir and oysters to Ciara's ""ride.""  It was then I knew this place was different- from the mismatched decor to the unique menu items- It was pretty sexy. Then the apple/arugula salad arrived - juicy, flavorful, like a melody in my mouth- suffice it to say Mariah Carey's ""always be my baby"" playing made it that much more beautiful. Then it was about to get funky- the crab fritters arrived and College's ""a real hero"" brought me back to my love for Ryan Gosling and taught me new love in the crab fritters- it was crispy, crabby, delightful! Somewhere in between the fish tacos (fried or grilled, you can't go wrong), the grilled octopus and lobster fried rice were the backstreet boys' ""I want you back""...how random...but the vibes were right! I honestly believe the music selection made the food and experience that much more enjoyable. Nothing could go wrong and nothing went wrong. The service was impeccable and no one at the table ever had less than a half empty glass of water. Try the hot sauce on the table..I'm still thinking about it and how I'd wish I snatched it from the table- Human decency and my desire to return stopped me.",2,3,2,Sue O.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",33,63,14

We were there for lunch and the food was just ""ok"" and totally overpriced. $19 for 2 small tacos, really?? I tried the salmon salad and although the salmon was good, the salad itself was much too seasoned, as if they wanted the whole plate to get some taste that it didn't have.

2.0,3/1/2015,"WOW IS THIS PLACE OVERHYPED.  So many people had recommended ABC Cocina to me, that I had to try it for myself. I was expecting to be blown away, and my experience fell short on almost every front.  My friend and I had a 9:30pm reservation on a Friday night, and when we arrived we were told it would be a few minutes for our table.  We stood in between the doorway and packed bar area for the next 30 minutes waiting for our table, while people, most of whom were actual staff, bumped in to us with no apologies.  Where else were we supposed to be standing? Outside in the 10 degree weather? The hosts never checked in on us or let us know the status of our table and had an attitude as if we were supposed to feel lucky just to be standing in the presence of their arrogance.  After checking in twice and making A LOT of angry eye contact on my part, we were finally seated.  Our waitress was the first friendly person we encountered.  I ate there two weeks ago, and honestly only two of the dishes I ate I actually remember, so that about sums up the food here. The short rib tacos were delicious, and the only other dish I remember is the cheese fondue, which was so incredible salty, it was inedible. We sent it back and it was taken off the bill without question. So at least there was that.  In my opinion, this place couldn't be more overrated.",1,0,0,Julie B.,"Manhattan, NY",2,14,0

2.0,2/26/2015,"Thursday night, party of 4, 8:00, no wait.We wanted to go to ABC Kitchen, but the 1.5 hour wait made us go to ABC Cocina instead. Big mistake.Food: 56%----Guacamole and Chips - 70%The guacamole was good. It had other things on it other than your staple ingredients like nuts. It also comes with a side of grapefruit salsa which I thought was a great twist. The combination worked really well. (small portion). Mezcal Smoked Salmon - 90%I really enjoyed this one. The mezcal was definitely there, adding a hint of smokiness and slight bitterness to the briny flavor of the salmon. The dill and creme fraiche sauce mellowed things out and gave a nice creamy finish to the fish.Octopus - 80%Can't go wrong with octopus. Great texture, nice touch with the sauce, sundried tomatoes and potatoes. Peekytoe Fritters - 60%Small but the crab definitely comes through on this one. Maybe a little bit one note especially with the aioli. It was very straightforward.Fish Taco - 60%Fish was cooked well. The pickled vegetables were a nice touch here, going well with the choice of protein. Overall it was a refreshing piece of soft taco.Arroz con Pollo - 30%Um. Huh? LOL. It was literally CnR. Stay away from this one as it felt like it was an after thought.Maitake Mushrooms and Goat Cheese - 40%Too much goat cheese on this one. The mushroom was great on its own. It had a 'bite' to it and was cooked well. However, it felt like it was missing a sweet note - (where's the honey?) The goat cheese was overpowering on this one.Empanada - 50%Ok. It was what it said it was. Service: 95%----The service was slightly slow but the waitress was really nice and accomodating. She even said ""sorry for the reach"" when she was placing down my wine glass. She was always smiling and checked up on us in frequently without being intrusive. The bus boys were efficient and refilled our glasses promptly. We didn't have to ask for anything during our meal. Ambience: ?%----Okay. This one is definitely subjective. Nothing matched - from the chairs, tables, to the utensils, dishware. You decide. Hipster or trying hard? Value: 40%----Going for tapas is always tricky. There's the matter of serving size and flavor progression. This place is pricey for the portions. Are they good dishes? I think the salmon was great as was the octopus. I'm on the fence with the guacamole - it's definitely good but probably not worth $15. Overall, I've had better elsewhere. Alta offers a much better selection. Also I think this is a matter of traditional vs new cuisine and ABC Cocina is more of the latter.

1.0,2/24/2015,"All hype. The quality of food for the price and service that you get is not worth it.  My experience was a terrible one...1.  The day was a cold one (it was 5 degrees out) and my in-laws took me to brunch for my birthday. We sat by the glass doors in the back; it was drafty (i.e. COLD) and there was nothing done for us.  We should have been offered to move to a less cold area. 2.  The waitstaff is uncouth and need to leave the business.  Each waitstaff person reached OVER us at the table.  I was eating and one girl REACHED OVER MY HEAD to get to my mother-in-law's plate to give her a fork.  REALLY!?  Our waiter consistently forgot items that we ordered.  The food arrival was as such: 3 apps together....15 minutes later another app....2 minutes later 1 entree.....15 minutes later two entrees and 30 minutes later the last entree.  Last fun incompetence of this non-customer service, uncouth, non-deserving staff.....upon check-in our coats were taken and we were not given a ticket.  Upon leaving we tell this Janelle Monae wannabe that we need our coats and we weren't given a ticket, she calls coat check and relays ""they lost their ticket.""  At this point I wanted to die, I needed out of this hipstery hell hole. 3.  The food was okay. Unimpressed.  I literally cook better than everything I ate.  If I am spending $300+ for a meal it better be worth it and frankly JG's staff failed him here.  Go to JoJo instead, it's a QUALITY place. 4.  The decor.  UGH! I hate places that need to TRY SO HARD to be cutesy and unique.....I hate that nothing matched in this place it's like they bought a locker on Storage Wars and furnished this place.  The cutlery didn't match and it was flimsy like dollar store cutlery.  For the price and the hype this place needed more.  So all in all I give this place zero stars.  I hated every minute of it.  OH and I went online to find an email address for the manager of the restaurant so I can air my complaints and there is none....they think they are better than they really are.  Perhaps I came on an OFF day but seriously why would i spend $300+ again to possibly have the same experience.  I'm done.",2,1,0,R L.,"New York, NY",153,462,19

Arroz con Pollo - The most bang for your buck and well worth it.  The dish was perfectly seasoned and moist like a paella.  The portion size was more like a meal rather than a tapas plate.  I would definitely recommend getting this.  Tres Leches - Get this.  Just do it.  Trust me.  1 Line Review:  If you are a big fan of Jean-Georges it's a trendy and chic place to check out but with the amount of money you will spend here there are definitely better meals that can be consumed.",3,0,0,Jannie C.,"Closter, NJ",10,2,0

I'm patient and appreciate hard work so yea, even tho she was kinda moody it wasn't her fault she was honestly doing her THANG!!!. thanks girl. this place delvers and outstanding sangria that must be taken note of. I've tried several and even brag on my own recipe but this place got something going. the open kitchen is wonderful displaying the passion and work of the kitchen staff. The management seemed somewhat aware of all the mischief goin on.

4.0,1/2/2015,"Such stunning ambiance. I dined here about 2 months ago, and I still remember everything about it. The lilac/lavender/fuchsia color scheme, the rustic walls, flooring and tables, the interesting lighting fixtures. The food matched, if not exceeded, how I felt about the decor. My sister and I ordered the following:-guacamole with ruby grapefruit salsa and warm crunchy tortillas-huevos rancheros, farm eggs, fresh corn tortillas-raw shaved brussels sprouts salad, shepherd's basket cheese and marcona almonds-market sweet potato and smoked cherry pepper empanadas with lemon yogurtI don't even know where to start; every dish was IMPECCABLE. My favorite was definitely the empanadas-- there was something SO UNIQUE about the pairing of lemon yogurt with cherry and also sweet potato. The smoky flavor really carried through-- often times I'll order something because of ""smoky"" in the description and then will be disappointed because I won't even get to experience it. This one really stayed true to its description. The huevos rancheros were fresh, and the sauce was flavorful. The corn tortillas were also authentic and soft.

2.0,1/1/2015,"I was a huge fan of ABC Kitchen, so when I found out about ABC Cocina I was really excited. ABC Kitchen quality Mexican food!? What could go wrong?I made a reservation a month in advance because it books up so fast. When the wife and I got there on time for the reservation we waited 25 minutes only to be seated in the middle of a barstool type communal table in the bar area. I said to the hostess that I wanted to wait for a table in the dining room because I didn't want to be elbow to elbow on a barstool very close to the door on a cold winter night. She said the wait for that was over an hour. Considering we made our reservation a month in advance, this was really disappointing.Hoping the food would be amazing the wife and I took our lame seat at the communal table elbow to elbow and smack in the middle of two parties that were like the cast of the view. We then were greeted by a really nice waitress that took our order and the food and drinks started...For drinks I had a margarita and sangria, both were just okay. For food we ordered the guacamole, shrimp, empanadas, fish tacos, vegetable rice, and the calamari. The calamari and shrimp were good, but the guac was bad, empanadas were not very good, fish tacos were standard, and the rice was boring and way too spicy. Also, they brought the rice out as the last item (they brought us one dish at a time). Rice should come before or with the tacos. Because the rice was boring and too spicy we didn't eat it. Waitress comes over and asks if we are done with the full plate of rice and I said yes it was too spicy and we didn't like it. I figured we would at least be asked if we wanted something different being that she should have warned us that the dish was that spicy (and I normally love spice). She just took it away and kept it on the bill. Not impressed. For the price and the hype, ABC Cocina is not worth it. Do yourself a favor and go to any of NYC's other better Mexican spots to fill your south of the border craving. Ruggy nailed it on his analogy that this place is the beats of the headphone world. I completely agree because everyone thinks it's cool, it looks cool, and it's backed by a big name, but at the end of the day it's substandard, overpriced, and overhyped.",2,2,1,Kyle M.,"Manhattan, NY",39,177,179

Out of those, the only one I wouldn't recommend (although it was still enjoyable) was the sea bass. Just not as exciting as the other dishes. The lemon yogurt sauce that comes with the empanadas- I could have eaten that up with a spoon. YUM.

So I am going to write a review without even trying to compare the sister restaurants, because the food, environment and premise of the two places are so different. We went to Cocina for lunch before the holidays with my boss and coworker. When I walked in, the place was brightly lit with a mix of bright lighting and table decor - the magenta florals popped from each table top., definitely ABC home and decor inspired. We took our seats and as I glimpsed down the menu filled with small plates and dishes, all Latin-fusion, and I knew this would be a tough pick. For a vegetarian, usually veggie dishes are an after thought, but there was plenty to choose from. There was the obvious started - guacamole and chips, with grapefruit salsa. Then we ordered patatas bravas with a spicy tangy sauce and rosemary aioli, and grilled maitake mushrooms with goat cheese and pepper vinaigrette. All of these dishes were bright compliments to each other and by the time I had my meal - I was so full. I ordered a grilled Brussels sprout Caesar salad and sweet potato empanada. The empanadas were a little too sweet for me and maybe being full already, I thought a little too heavy with the crust.

CHARLOTTE was our waitress and had no shame in hovering behind us and clearing the table as we were literally still eating off the plates. Why the rush? I made a subtle point by tipping her $20, about $5 dollars less than ""expected"" but still way more than she deserved for only being a waitress....expecting she would trash talk us to her co-workers as they usually do to ""stingy tippers""....FUNNY THING IS the very next night we were seated RIGHT NEXT TO HER while she dined at Keen's Steakhouse. And as expected, she was totally telling them what stingy tippers we are! She was trying to be quiet about it but the fat drunk f-er guy at her table couldn't keep his mouth shut.

Which brings me to my next highlight of the evening. The MARGARITAS! We tried the Classic, Mango and Passion Fruit. Our favorite was the smokey passion fruit marg and the mango came in close second. The mango margarita is served in a martini glass with a chili dipped, dried mango chunk on a skewer. Fancy! Once we got to our table (they don't allow food at the side seating around the bar, only at the bar or at tables.) we ordered the guacamole, the gooy ham and cheese fritters and the griddled fish tacos. ALL were AMAZING and wonderful and made my girlfriend and I do a little dance with each bite. We went with the non-fried version for the fish tacos which were delicious with pieces of pickled ginger and cabbage on top! Nice twist! We were told the chef recommends the crunchy/fried option for the dish so we will have to try that next time. I honestly can't imagine the tacos tasting any better though.

4.0,10/15/2014,"ABC Cocina has a lively, fun vibe inside the restaurant.  We went on a Tuesday night at 6:30 p.m. for two. We weren't able to get a table inside the restaurant (30+ minute wait), but they were able to seat us immediately outside or at the high communal bar table. I always love sitting in the bar area (while having actual seats), so we opted for the communal table at the bar. We started with a glass of wine and a basil jalapeño margarita. Being a latin-themed restaurant, I thought I had to try the marg - it did not disappoint. The rim was salted with finely crushed basil and a hint of spice, which was the perfect complement to the slightly sweet, tangy and spicy nectar inside the glass. We decided to share three tapas plates: -grilled beets, pimenton cheese, sherry and herbs: this was delicious - the slightly spicy, soft cheese was a great complement to the grilled beets. a great appetizer to share between two people. -peekytoe crab and corn fritters, chipotle mayo: these were good, but utterly tiny, about the size of a cherry, and came with 5 fritters. I would have preferred three fritters, with more filling and less fried outside, but as this is tapas i know their 'thing' is small portions. The aioli was delicious, but you can never really go wrong with chipotle mayo/aioli -crispy or griddled fish tacos, aioli and cabbage-chili pickle: these were just 'meh'. they were tasty, but tasted more like something I might order from a taco truck, rather than an upscale latin restaurant. The server recommended them crispy over grilled and I think there were only twice pieces of fish on each tiny taco. They were okay, but the other dishes were definitely better and more interesting. This is a very fun place to get get cocktails and tapas, but don't expect to fill up on 2-3 shared plates for dinner. Would be really fun for a large group to get drinks and bites before going out!  I will definitely be coming back as there were many items on the menu I wanted to try.",1,0,0,Carley F.,"Venice, Los Angeles, CA",83,94,15

Service throughout our meal was spot-on. Our waitress recommended this delicious Portuguese red wine (I was excited to finally try a red vinho verde) and was good at letting us know how soon our dishes would be coming. The food was phenomenal. They recommend sharing 3 to 5 small plates for two people so we ordered: patatas bravas,  shaved brussel sprout salad, sautéed corn, short rib tacos, and a grilled beef tenderloin with chimichurri sauce. The short ribs in the tacos were amazingly yummy - so full of flavor and with just the right amount of fat to make it incredibly juicy. Same with the grilled tenderloin - it was a perfect medium rare, the meat was super tender, and it went so well with the wine. The bf, who is vegetarian, enjoyed the vegetable dishes but wasn't blown away by them. Of the three,  the sautéed corn, which was covered by a good amount of chipotle aioli, was the tastiest.

The host told me to let him know when my dining partner arrived, and he would seat us. No problem. After 20 minutes of waiting, I decided I would like to proceed with lunch so I could get back to work. and approached the host stand to inquire.  I'm not sure if he thought I was trying to pull one over on him, but he was unbelievably  rude.  I told him I would like to sit, and proceed as if I was dining alone, since I didn't know when, or if, my guest would arrive. With such contempt in his tone, he told me that if I was dining alone (oh, the horror!), I could take a seat at the bar. I told him that I had been here several times alone and had always been seated at a two-top table instead of the bar and asked if their policy had changed on single diners. This was post lunch hour - there was only one other occupied table on their ""patio"". He huffed, rolled his eyes and then called someone who he said would seat me, ""wherever you insist on sitting."" I can totally understand not seating me if I was asking for a table to accommodate 10 people, but that was not the case. Also, if he's that easily miffed, he needs to find a career outside of customer service; although, with his attitude, that may be difficult. I was finally seated and started to order. My guest did end up joining me after about 20 minutes. At least I was able to place our order and have a cocktail while I waited. Our server and the food runners were all so welcoming, friendly, informative about the new items on the menu, etc. We ordered a ton of food - the fish tacos,mushroom/kale tacos, and empanadas were favorites - had delightful beverages (cucumber gin fizz was dangerously delicious), and overall were happy with our decision to dine here.

We ordered a selection of plates to share, including the marinated olives and jamon iberico to start.

5.0,8/27/2014,"This was one of my favorite dining experiences in all of New York City. The vibe of the whole restaurant was modern and trendy, with an upscale party atmosphere. Excellent drink selection and everything prepared meticulously. The dinner menu is tapas based, so with a wide selection it is recommended to order 2-3 dishes per person, and share everything cause that is what tapas are for! For our table of 4 we ordered 10 dishes, and that was a perfect amount of food. Some of my favorite dishes were the Arroz con Pollo. This dish is prepared to order, so it took a little longer and came out a little later compared to the rest of the dishes, but so worth the wait. The rice was creamy and delicious, and the chicken was super tender and flavorful. The house made habanero sauce on the table was an excellent accent to the dish as well. We tried the shrimp with sizzling garlic and chili oil and it was fantastic. I could have eaten an entire dish of these shrimp. They are super spicy but not overwhelming. The peekytoecrab and cornfritters with chipotle mayo were another favorite of mine. There were 5 fritters which was just enough to share, but I think i would order 2 of these dishes next time. One to share and one for me. The chipotle mayo was a perfect accent to these crispy fritters. The sauteed corn with parmesan and chipotle were bomb, and tasty, as was the market string beans, pickled red onion vinaigrette with queso de manocheese. These last two items were perfect for any vegetarian. We also had the savory glazed short rib tacos  with habanero relish and frizzled onion. By the time these came out I was already so full, but I definitely housed them. Wow were they flavorful. Meat was tender, everything was perfect. The beef emapanadas and the chick pea empanadas were to die for. Really crispy and delicious.

Really nice green chili dressing with crispy rice, the flavours just complement each other too well and I love how it tasted very yuzu-ish.Patatas bravas - this was my least favourite, I need to remind myself I don't care for this very much. I didn't realize I didn't like this dish in Spain either. It's not horrible, but not worth the carbs.Grilled Maine lobster - I thought this would be the win win dish, but I felt it was grilled a bit too much and the smoked chilies didn't add anything to this dish.

It was communal in name only (when will restaurants cater to solo diners?) as with 14 chairs, there were 6 couples (4 on double dates...possibly just friends hanging out) and myself and well...they were New Yorkers...(sorry I couldn't resist that jab) so they weren't really interested in anyone around them. On the bright side it did give me time to write this review. I enjoyed the tomato and peach gazpacho but it really did bear a strong resemblance to chilled salsa. Their homemade bread is out of this world. The shrimp with sizzling garlic and chili oil was excellent and the bartender made a solid whiskey sour.

Getting reservations was a bit of a pain (you have to give your cc number), and also surprising once we showed up Sunday night and realized that half the restaurant was empty! The four of us shared the tapas style dishes: We started with the fresh guacamole, which had a surprising kick to it and one of the salads. Arroz con pollo was the heftiest dish and delicious. I loved the short rib tacos, but at only 2 tacos an order, felt a bit steep in price. The charred octopus was so, so good and I'd definitely recommend it!We finished up the meal with the soft and crunchy almond cake.Delicious meal, and very nice ambiance and service.",0,0,0,Tiffany L.,"Charlottesville, VA",122,1143,2

3.0,7/14/2014,"The food here is good, it really is.  The caveat here, in my mind, is that when you pay what you're paying, you expect a dash more of something on the plate.  I once ordered their pulled pork sandwich and, despite its small size, it was the only thing on this massive plate in front of me - awkwardly imbalanced.  The tacos were fantastic (better than that sandwich!), but again, it felt a bit on the light side.  Not that a light lunch is bad, it's just not what you go pay $20 for.The margaritas here are also pretty solid.  There's really no going wrong with grabbing a couple of those along with your skimpy, pricey sandwich.  Try at least once, I'd say.  This is not the hottest lunch spot for the budget conscious by any means.",2,0,1,Marcus Z.,"Manhattan, NY",65,123,0

3.0,7/11/2014,"Maybe I've been hanging out almost exclusively in bk for too long, but as my friend nicely put it- you walk into this place and feel like a f*ing troll. Very sceney.  Manhattan young wheelers and dealers and models sceney. I can appreciate the decor- which is in line with ABC's (the furniture store) aesthetic- shabby chic/glam. But combined with the loud clubby music and the crowd, the place pretty much feels like sceney club. Overall, the food, drinks and service are good, but none of it justifies the prices. The highlights were the sweet pea guac (the added slightly crunchy texture and subtle sweetness of the sweet peas is a nice deviation from the traditional guac), the crispy fish tacos and the short rib tacos. The tacos (minus all the toppings) were on par with some of my favorite local joints. My main complaint with these particular ones (other than the 15 to 30 bucks for 2 tacos price tag) is that there's just too much stuff going on. The fish tacos, for instance, came with a spicy aioli, cabbage chili pickles and cilantro- the toppings were each fairly potent and together overpower the fish. Keeping it simpler would've allowed fuller appreciation of the fish. The arroz con pollo is definitely worth getting if you're looking for something heartier and if you love rice. The moist rice was soaked in the delicious sauciness of the chicken and was definitely the best part of this dish. The chicken itself unfortunately was more inconsistent- while ABC is generous with the amount of chicken, some pieces were more tender/dry than others. The ""crackling"" skin was frankly a bit dry and hard. I was originally anticipating something between what we got and the skin on a nice rotisserie chicken.The charred octopus literally came with like 5 small pieces of octopus and some small wedges of potato. The combo of the charring and the vinegarette they used weren't my favorite. Something to skip in my opinion.",0,0,0,Jen H.,"Mountain View, CA",106,366,2997

Nevertheless, I was happy with my food choices. We got their Guacamole with peas and it was filling and fresh because the peas add a unique flavor to it. In addition, their sausage stuffed octopus with chickpeas are spicy and tasty. For entree, I had the Blackened Fish Taco and it is amazing.

We ordered a maitake mushroom dish with goat cheese that was outrageously delicious. We also ordered salmon in a spicy yogurt and cucumber sauce that was pretty good.For the entrees we ordered fish tacos - which were just ok - and one of my favorite breakfast dishes, huevos rancheros.I was really looking forward to the huevos rancheros. Unfortunately, the dish I had at ABC Cocina was very subpar. Usually this dish is served with cheese and warm beans. Instead, ABC Cocina's version was an egg dish similar to shakshuka with a small bowl of a cold bean salsa on the side. The combination was weird and it didn't work. However, our waiter gave us a complementary side of mushroom and kale tacos. This free dish was really good and a pleasant surprise.I was very tempted to give this restaurant 3 stars because the main dishes were so mediocre, especially considering the price.

I guess I expected the extra time to infuse more flavor. I would have liked to give it 4.5 stars because here's a couple reasons why it wasn't perfect.First, We had a great bottle of sparkling rose that is generally only offered by the glass so took a bit of wrangling to find out the price.

I give them two stars because of the decor and ambiance, and some dishes like the patatas bravas and chimichurri steak were very good. Service however was terrible, the waitress and manager were borderline rude. The salmon, tacos and empanadas were beyond spicy we couldn't even taste the flavors anymore. It was almost painful and ruined our taste for the other dishes we ordered after that. I pointed out to the waitress that those dishes were way too spicy to enjoy, and she didn't offer to take them back or replace them, which I would think would be the correct thing to do. She could've also warned us they'd be that spicy. Anyway, we let that go and after that my friend accidentally spilled his drink on his plate. The waitress helped us clean it up and I asked her if she could replace his dish since he had barely tasted it. She came back and gave him a clean dish with nothing on it, and a menu for him to order something new. I got up and to speak to the manager to explain the situation, very nicely, I wasn't complaining as it was our fault we spilled the drink. She however pointed out to me he spilled the drink so it was our fault. I almost laughed out loud. Even McDonalds replaces your drink when you spill it. Accidents happen, and I'm sure a nice restaurant like this could afford to replace our dish, specially since we had ordered so many other plates and drinks.

We started off with the mezcal cured salmon with cucumber-yogurt relish and potato flakes. SO GOOD!  The salmon itself was delicious and the cucumber-yogurt was perfect.  It also had a slight kick to it, which was interesting and complimented the coolness of the yogurt perfectly.  Next, we had the crispy fish tacos with aioli and cabbage, which were delicious.  These were really spicy- a little spicier than I was expecting, but still really good.  The sweetness of the cabbage went really well with the spice and the fish was cooked perfectly.  My friend had the crunchy mexican spiced french toast with mangos, which she really enjoyed.  It was crunchy on the outside and really moist on the inside.  The mangos went really well with it.  I'm not a huge fan of sweets for a meal, so I had the huevos rancheros.  So, so good!  The black bean avocado salsa they are served with was so delicious that I probably could have eaten that alone.  I also really enjoyed my grapefruit margarita- it went well with all the spice.Prices are a bit higher than average, but you really do get what you pay for.  The food is absolutely delicious and you can tell there is a lot of thought and care that go into the way it is prepared.  I definitely plan to stop in for dinner and would love to return for brunch.",0,0,0,Kristina D.,"New York, NY",56,131,156

I've been meaning to re-visit the restaurant and try other dishes but obviously New York dining scene is so hectic that I always kept updating the list of new restaurants to visit (it didn't help that ABC Cocina is still a hot spot in NYC where getting a reservation can be pretty difficult). I finally was able to visit again and really liked everything that I ordered.Florida white shrimp in ""agua diablo,"" banana and almonds was a pretty unique dish with ingredients that somehow worked pretty well, I liked the spicy kick combined with the sweet flavor of banana. Spring pea empanadas with green chili yogurt was pretty tasty, as was sautéed mushroom tacos with cashews, mole, kale and lime. While both looked like typical Mexican staples, their flavors were anything but, especially the mushroom tacos that I wish I could get more of. Black sea bass marinated with tamarind and thyme showcased the breadth of global influences infused in restaurants of Jean-Georges Vongerichten, with a hint of Asian flavor that worked very well. While I wish the rice was a little but more on the crispy side, arroz con pollo with crackling skin and lemon zest was a hearty dish that I kept eating no matter how full I was. For dessert, I had popsicles with hibiscus, caramel apple and chocolate coconut flavor. I didn't realize how delicious popsicles could be, and was a huge fan of all three flavors.The restaurant is still one of the more popular places for young crowds, with sexy décor and vibe that is ideal for casual dinners or dates. The restaurant has a full bar with a variety of wine and cocktail selections, but with the summer approaching, I highly recommend sangria (definitely one of the better ones in the city). When a star chef like Jean-Georges opens up multiple restaurants, there's always that risk of declining standard that can haunt an individual restaurant.

Nothing I tried was actually good.The service is also really phony and hyper and disingenuous. Total amateur night. You almost expect them to say, ""Hi! I'm Brittnee, and I'll be your server."" They walk you through the ""concept"" in a condescending way, as though small plates is such a revolutionary paradigm shift. And a friend ordered the cheese plate -- the lame, amateurish waitress explained that we should look at it as a cheese flight, and then proceeded to tell us the order in which we should sample the cheese. I mean, there were only THREE cheeses. Not to mention the fact that they were the most humdrum, pedestrian cheeses ever (something like blue, manchego and brie).

This and ABC Kitchen are both of my favorite restaurants in the city- the decor, the food, the ambiance, everything. so ABC cocina has a more Spanish twist on the food (as implied by the name). its also a open kitchen style, which means food gets served as they get made. I've only been here for brunch, so cant vouch for the dinner, but its blown me out of the water almost every time. the first time i came here i was so incredibly hungover, and usually when im that hungover i dont like to eat any solid food, but everything that was served was so good i actually couldn't help but devour everything. some must try food items here:- guac and chips. I know it seems so standard and something you can get anywhere else-- but NO. seriously, when i looked around me it looked like every single table had a order of this so i figured i couldn't go wrong with this order. i love avocados and this totally lived up to my expectations.

It's salty with a kick to it and the peas do a great job balancing the flavors. and the tortillas that come with it is just fantastic. perfectly cooked with the right amount of crunch. you just have to try it.the dish was so good I honestly don't remember what else I ordered.

3.0,5/11/2014,"My fiancé and I came in on Mother's Day around 1pm for brunch without reservation. To our surprise, there was a table available and we were seated immediately. However, It took quite some time for our server to come over with the menu. And when he did, he didn't seemed too interested in us. He hurriedly explained the menu and scrambled away. Although our server suggested ordering 5-7 plates for the two of us (which I thought sounded a bit ridiculous), we decided on one small, one large, and one masa/rice plate. Small - fluke - we counted 7-8 fresh sashimi pieces swimming their chili lime sauce - light and refreshing - perfect way to start a meal! Large - tuna burger - tuna was blend and the jalapeño aioli was one dimensional - straight salty. Thank goodness for the habanero sauce at the table. The sesame bun was perfectly toasted tho! Rice - arroz con pollo - their signature dish - large enough to serve 3-4 people, thank goodness we stopped at 3 plates because we were stuffed! This was definitely the best dish- the chicken was tender and juicy, the rice was creamy and perfectly seasoned. With a squeeze of lemon and splash of habanero sauce, it was money! Definitely well worth the price! I didn't recall our server ever come back to check on us. They did have other servers/busboys come back refilling water. Not sure if we were supposed to get a bread basket too but we did notice every table around us received one.

The interior of ABC Cochina emanates a unique blend of personality and character. A concrete pillars, overhanging light fixtures, provides a very industrial yet sophisticated and casual environment for any sort of meetup. The four of us made a reservation here for a Thursday evening. The restaurant was full and pleasantly packed that night. Our seating arrangement made at a wide, table across from the main bar was perhaps one of the best seats in the house. We started off with the sangria strong but still quite tasteful and refreshing. Certainly, it was not as sweet as I had anticipated and more on the tarty side. The guacamole turned out to be an excellent starter. The subtle hints of sweetness contrast to the complex levels of flavor not expected of guacamole.  It clearly demonstrated an influence of modern Mexican cuisine. The Short rib tacos were very delicate, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. A savory dish settled on top of a sauce base, the addition of soy sauce marinated with perfection, again, aroused an unexpected flavor. It was the subtle hints of spice and soft texture of the meat that made the food so much more interesting. An anticipation was being built with each and every bite. What I immediately noted of all these dishes though was the artful, creative, and careful presentation. There was a clear attention to detail that made our meals all the more appetizing and appealing.ABC Cocina did not disappoint.  Its a splendid addition to the many JG restaurants in NYC.",2,0,0,Eric Y.,"New York, NY",424,163,73

FYI - you can't order food at the counters along the window and by the bar, only at the tables. We sat at a high two top, but there are also communal tables where they seem to place walk-ins. Food is served tapas style but the portions are all pretty reasonably sized. Flavors are a combination of Spanish and Latin American, with a farm to table feel, much like ABC Kitchen.

4.0,3/16/2014,"When we couldn't get brunch reservations at ABC Kitchen, we opted for Jean-Georges Vongerichten's Latin version at ABC Cocina. According to one of our dining partners, he felt that this was a better meal than he had at ABC Kitchen. There's so much to love about brunch here. First let's talk about the coffee. They serve it in these fantastic mugs (that my roommate ended up buying at the store...) AND the mugs are accompanied by the most ADORABLE tiny beakers filled with milk. Unfortunately, you may need to chase down a server to get more milk because they're so small but since they're SO cute, who cares? So there's that. I debated getting a cocktail but coffee was far more important. Between the 3 of us, we had: -cheese board with marconas-shaved brussels sprouts salad with cheese and marconas-grilled maitakes and goat cheese-shrimp with garlic & chili oil-ham and cheese fritters-crunchy mexican spiced french toast with roasted apples-crispy fish tacos-bravasEverything was quite good. I mean you can't go wrong with cheese. Ever. (Life rule #1, really.) Fried potatoes - obviously delicious. Sizzling shrimp with garlic and chilies? Wonderful. Those fish tacos? Must get the fish crispy -- at the server's recommendation and she definitely didn't steer us wrong. The French toast came last and we sort of treated it as our dessert instead of actually ordering dessert. We were stuffed by this point but we still trudged along. And it was good. So so good. Our server was wonderful - she was fun and energetic and she was having a great hair day (she also appreciated us complimenting her about it several times...haha). Coffees and waters were consistently refilled and plates were cleared and refreshed throughout without ever feeling like we were being rushed. The decor is fun- exposed brick walls (there was a mini buddha tucked in the wall by our table) and the lighting is gush-worthy. Really interesting light fixtures and cozy seating.

4.0,3/12/2014,"Jean-Georges Vongerichten's latest restaurant took advantage of the location and name of his well-established ABC Kitchen, a strategy that's met with much success. After its opening earlier this summer, it was almost impossible to find a dinner reservation (especially one at a reasonable hour), but within due time, ABC Cocina began offering brunch. When I spotted an available slot on a Saturday afternoon, I immediately reserved it for a group of four. Thus, I found myself heading to Union Square a few weeks later, an area that I've become increasingly familiar with.Housed in the same building as ABC Kitchen, ABC Cocina has clearly borrowed more than just a name from the latter. The decor has the same whimsical, eclectic element, yet still manages to be elegant; the atmosphere is energetic and lively; and the approach to food maintains its focus on organic, locally-sourced, and seasonal ingredients. Unlike ABC Kitchen, however, ABC Cocina's menu features items that are distinctively influenced by Spanish and Latin flavors. Dishes are meant to be shared, so we ordered a variety of plates for our group.Guacamole: Earlier in the season, the sweet pea guacamole had been the highlight of the menu, but by the time we made it in, it was no longer available. Instead, the guacamole we ordered came with a sprinkling of sunflower seeds and microgreens, and was served with a side of sungold tomato salsa and plenty of tortilla chips. The guacamole was fresh with just enough acidity, and there was plenty of texture and crunch from all the elements.Crispy Fish Tacos: The fish can either be crispy (fried) or grilled, but our server recommended the former. It was a recommendation that we were glad to take, however, as these were some pretty delicious soft shell tacos. There are two servings per order, and each comes with a lightly fried piece of fish topped off with a cabbage-chili slaw and a creamy chipotle aoili to add some flavor and spice.Patatas Bravas: A side dish that's found at almost any Spanish restaurant, ABC Cocina's version comes with a ""spicy tangy sauce"" that bears strong resemblance to the one found on the fish tacos and a thick rosemary aioli. The potatoes were served piping hot and had a perfectly crispy exterior, and were well-seasonedCuban Sandwich: A good sandwich is an underrated thing, but the cubano here balances the bread (two slices of not-too-thick, not-too-thin lightly buttered cuban bread) and the filling (layers of ham, roasted turkey, and fairmount cheese) almost perfectly. It has plenty of texture and just the right amount of crunch, and the flavors are a tried and true combination. I wish the pickles had been incorporated into the sandwich, though, instead of served on the side, but it's one of the better cubanos you'll find in the city.Huevos Rancheros: Two lightly fried sunnyside-up eggs are served on top of several corn tortillas and covered with a thick salsa. This is not a dish I typically order, as it's one of the more simplistic brunch dishes on any menu. The tortillas were a little too grainy for my liking and the salsa needed a little more spice and tomato flavor. Probably not a dish I would order again, especially as it's fairly difficult to share with any number of people.tl;dr - ABC Cocina serves up a variety of quality dishes that skew heavily towards Spanish and Latin American flavors. While the options are pretty solid across the board, there are some that outshine others. Get a reservation for brunch if the availabilities during the evening are nonexistent; it's worth at least one trip to try it for yourself.",10,2,3,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

Maybe I'm a sucker for fried things, but the crackling skin completely made this dish.  The chicken was tender and juicy, and the lemon zest did wonders to tie all the flavors together, but it was those pieces of crackling skin I was looking forward to in ever bite.  However, as good as the dish is, the portion is deceivingly large so definitely split it.Atmosphere-wise, this is chick central.  The chandeliers, cutesy decorations and seating makes it a great place to go with a group of your girlfriends.  I think the restaurant has also discovered this as when we went, there was an abundance of cute waiters who were very friendly (to the delight of one of my friends).  I wonder if the restaurant has ever seen a situation a la SATC/Samantha Jones...",0,1,1,Alisa L.,"Washington, DC",76,163,6

SO spicy that you couldn't taste any of the flavours. We had to eat bread after bread slices just to try to cool down. By the 3rd dish (fish tacos), everything tasted the same. I was super disappointed. Plus, there was some random paper/plastic thing in my drink and the bar tender didn't even bother to comp us or offer anything for the gross thing in my drink. She did offer to replace it in fairness but nothing extra. The 2 stars are because despite the bad food and drink incident, the staff in general was welcoming and nice. I think they were just excited to see people in the resto.",0,0,0,suzy d.,"Manhattan, NY",1,27,1

I know you are thinking ...wth?! I was skeptical too, but I didn't really have a choice as my date assumed I would eat anything he ordered. And as a broke girl living in NYC, I stayed to see what ABC Cocina has to offer. Surprisingly, all the dishes were REALLY good. It has a very hip vibe and a great second date spot.

4.0,2/14/2014,"Abc cocina review2/12/2014Went to ABC Cocina last night. Arrived 15-20 minutes early and still had to wait until 9:15 for a 9 pm reservation on a Wednesday night. Coat check was very gracious about the large roller bag I had on person. The bar is accommodating with transferring your tab to a cars that has the reservation name with no hassle. Order two basil jalapeño margaritas. They were probably the low point of the evening. The basil rim tasted old and rancid. They would have done better muddling the basil into the drink and then doing a different kind of rim. Apparently this is their most popular drink.Once seated at the banquette we ordered a 31 dollar bottle of Rioja which was very light. Perfect since we ended up ordering a light meal of vegetables mad seafood. The table was set uniquely with a small dark pic flower ( perhaps a carnation ), dish rag style napkins (which would have been perfect had we ordered the tacos), depression glass bread plates ( which seemed to serve no purpose since I neither saw bread and most things were tapa style in which we had another small dish to use for the food. We started with an order of the guacamole which came with a citrus salsa that my companion found bitter, I was hoping the would have had the spring pea guacamole but it is obviously out of season for that. For the most part we took recommendations from our server who had excellent taste. It was a little difficult to hear her because the notice level is quite high. There was definitely a scene sort of atmosphere, average age of the patrons was probably between 25-35. Not as many couples as two women or large groups. After the guacamole we had the shaved Brussels sprouts salad with Shepard basket cheese and Marconi almonds. The was tasty but could have used a little dressing or fat (oil or pork product maybe) just a little too bright within not enough depth. Even some citrus would have been welcome. Next came my second favorite dish of the evening, the roasted cauliflower with raisins, cilantro and chilies. Not greasy with just the hint of a spicy cheese or aioli (not like on the menu) the cauliflower had a wonderful texture between creamy and crisp. Next came the shrimp with sizzling garlic and chili oil. Much better than the traditional gambas al aljillo you typically get. Much less grease but lightly breaded. I didn't love the flavor but my companion really enjoyed them.The last two dishes were also in the top three, roasted beets with pimeton, sherry and herbs and maitake mushrooms with goat cheese and Fresno pepper vinaigrette. The beets would have been a little better had they not been chilled. My favorite of the evening though were the mushrooms. Meaty and savory with a tart finish from the pepper sauce and the goat cheese. I could have eaten a whole dish myself but it was the most generous dish apart from the guacamole. If I can find  some of these mushrooms this will be high on my recreate list.We ended the evening with a glass of sherry and a glass of port. It is unlikely we would return but it was a pleasant meal.",0,0,0,Mel P.,"Carlisle, PA",57,55,576

Our waiter was very attentive throughout our evening, advising me on which dishes to avoid because i do not like spicy food, and even removing a dish from our bill because it was too spicy to eat.

The deco and ambience of the restaurant is impeccable. However, we found the food to be a bit underwhelming and very overpriced. Portions are small (as warned by the waitress) and food is not that impressive given the price.  We started with the guacamole, which was very fresh but on the other hand hardly worth the $15 price tag. We also got the roasted cauliflower, which wasn't bad, but again with very small portion for the price. The fish tacos were pretty good---I loved the cabbage pickle on the top. The short rib tacos were a bit too salty to my taste and again probably not worth $20.  We also got grilled octopus--I liked the small potatoes that came with it more than the octopus itself. The shrimp with sizzling garlic and chili oil was actually very good, with the shrimp very fresh and the texture tender and juicy.  Overall, I think if the food were 30% cheaper I would give a four-star rating, but given the price tag, the restaurant needs to try harder to impress me.",1,0,0,Xiao Z.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

The garlic was crispy adding a nice contextual contrast, while the chili oil was so flavorful. The shrimp was so tender and sweet. I also got the Sauteed Mushroom Tacos. The Mushrooms were rich, meaty, and cooked to juicy tender perfection. The mole sauce and the kale added nicely as well. One of my companions ordered the Crunchy Mexican Spiced French Toast. GET THIS! This was such delicious french toast that I found myself sneaking little bites. The french was custardy and soft on the inside, and crispy griddled perfection on the outside. The roasted apples were soft and plump. YUM!Another companion ordered the Eggs Benedict, but said that everything but the eggs was cold.

I had requested in advance some complicated billing arrangement also, where I wanted a portion of the bill to ""secretly"" be put on my personal card, so that everyone else dining could pay a lower price for a pretty over-the-top meal. I asked that this be done without mention during or after the dinner.The night of the dinner, everything was impeccable. The food...just wow. We had something like 17 courses of food and I don't even know if I could choose a favorite. Our server was a rockstar too. I had even expressed some concern about the portions maybe being too small (this was based on some snacks that came out to the table at the beginning, and I think I jumped the gun on my worries here), but she made sure to  add an extra plate or two of each course that followed, at no extra charge. She just wanted to make sure everyone was leaving full and happy, which was my goal too. When dessert came out, she had remembered that it was a birthday, and of course, delivered a dessert with a birthday candle, as I had requested.When it was time for the check, I whispered to my server about the odd billing arrangement I had requested in advance - just to make sure it had been communicated to her. She politely cut me off and said ""don't worry, it's been taken care of"", and smiled. The staff and food at ABC Cocina is among the best I've experienced in New York.

5.0,12/4/2013,"The folks at ABC, special shout out to the incredible Dan Kluger, have done it again. I walked into ABC Kitchen at 10pm on a week night and it was packed! I couldn't believe it, especially right after a holiday when the rest of the city was pretty quiet. The space is very cool. It's whimsical and sophisticated, just as you'd expect for a space in ABC Carpet & Home. The drink list is pretty intriguing. I started with a sparkling concord grape cocktail with a lemon twist and was very pleased. My fiance loved his margarita. We had the market green empanadas with tomato jam to start. Yum. Who knew market greens could pack such flavor?! The sizzling garlic shrimp was wonderful. It had a strong kick and you could really taste the garlic, which I loved. Short rib tacos were my least favorite dish of the night but they were still pretty good, especially when I added some of the incredible hot sauce they have at the table. Ham and cheese fritters come with the most delectable aioli. It's thick, creamy, spicy and sweet all at once. My favorite of the night? The arroz con pollo. This was a knockout. The rice was so moist with huge chunks of seasoned chicken and chicken skin. We practically licked the bowl clean. I also tried a glass of their Malbec on tap. I had never seen wine on tap and was very intrigued. It delivered and for only $10 a glass. This is a wonderful new addition to New York, from atmosphere to food to service.

Good thing abc Cocina is attached to an amazing store that looks like every girls' dream home. That's right, ABC Carpet and Home is steps away for your visual pleasure (and eventual heartbreak when you realize you probably can't afford 80% of the beautiful goods). No worries, you're about to embark upon a great Spanish inspired meal that exceeds the preconceived ideas of mediocre tapas restaurants you hold from 5 years ago.  I loved the creativity of the cooking...the roasted curried cauliflower with raisins was delicious and well spiced. The fish combined the with the favors of tomato, saffron, and onion was surprisingly spicy and balanced. Everything we shared was well thought and the menu was so ample, I even had a hard time deciding what to order. The drink menu is equally creative, rounding out the menu with local spirits  (like a fig old fashioned with widow jane rye) and seasonal beverages.

4.0,10/30/2013,"I heart JVG. ABC Kitchen is one of my fav restaurants in nYC so I was very excited to try ABC Cocina. So far I've been here for brunch twice and both were great experiences. On my first visit, we ordered the raw shaved fluke, baby calamari stuffed with chorizo, crispy fish tacos and chicken tacos. For drinks I decided to pass on the alchy and instead got a rosemary and lime cooler per the waiter's recommendation. Everything was delicious but the crispy fish tacos were out of this world. I loved that pickled cabbages were used to bring out the citrus flavor instead of the usual lime juice. My second fav was the raw shaved fluke which also had a slight citrus/acidic taste. The chicken tacos were next on the list. The chicken was moist and this is a great alternative for anyone who doesn't eat seafood, but if you eat fish, then go for the fish tacos. I would probably not recommend the baby calamari stuffed with chorizo because there were only 3 pieces of baby calamari in our dish. Too many chickpeas and not enough of the other goodies.I would also caution against ordering the rosemary and lime cooler if you're getting the fluke or the fish tacos because I felt there was a bit too much acidity in the meal. I blame this on my ordering and not the restaurant though.The next time I went, my friends and I got the fish tacos (of course), crab fritters, the pancakes and the french toast. We were big fans of the french toast, but thought the pancakes were good but not spectacular. They did come with a delish raspberry sauce that we all enjoyed.

I started with the Red Hibiscus Sangria which was very fruity, but not very floral. It was still delicious. We were served an array of breads with a spicy orange dipping sauce and oil. There was also a bowl of roasted chickpeas on the table. These were amazing, they tasted like fritos!The dishes are served tapas-style. Unfortunately nothing really wow-ed me. Most of the items were too spicy. I like spicy but the heat was overpowering all the flavors. We shared:Guacamole (basic, ironically the 1 dish that lacked any spiciness, note: this was not the snap pea guac that everyone on Yelp was raving about, I guess that was a seasonal item)Patatas Bravas (good, but not great)Ham and Cheese Fritters  (I don't see why a fried ball of meat and cheese should be spicier than a jalapeno)Shrimp with sizzling garlic and chili oil (pretty good, but again there were balls of chili that burned my friends' mouth)Short Rib Tacos (best savory dish)Grilled Maitake Mushrooms with goat cheese, fresno pepper vinaigrette (these were too mushy)Stewed Chicken with sweet onions, spicy tomatoes, and crispy rice (a weird smoky flavor)Beef Tenderloin ""Burnt Ends"" And Chimichurri Sauce Shrimp (I realize these are supposed to be ""burnt"" but the char taste was too much)Tres leches (this was delicious, it was topped with a tangy cream that offset the sweetness of the cake very well)Overall disappointed in ABC Cocina.

Two basil jalapeno margaritas and strawberry caipirinhas later, we were ushered to a nice corner table where we could enjoy a full view of the decor, a wonderful eye-candy mix of modern and antique. We'd started with an order of the guacamole at the bar, which was actually some of the best we've had in town. To this we added the marinated olives, patatas bravas and the pulled pork tacos. All of it was delicious; decent portions which still left us room for dessert. We opted for the salted caramel flan and white chocolate rice pudding; between the two, I'd recommend the flan. Overall, it was a delightful evening accented by first-class service throughout. Would highly recommend!",0,0,0,Summer M.,"Manhattan, NY",42,42,0
4.0,8/30/2013,"Came here for brunch, and was not disappointed.Ordered the guacamole as a starter. I always appreciate warmed chips and the guac was just the right consistency and the portion was fairly large. They will also bring more chips without even needing to ask. Subtle plus, but very much appreciated.Ordered the burger, which did not come with fries, which is one of my pet peeves. However, the burger was definitely one of the better burgers I've had in the city. It had kind of a southwest flavor to it that was subtle but definitely delicious. I will also say, it is a very large burger, so it might have been fine that I didn't get fries with it. I also managed to try the coconut pancakes, which were just the right amount of sweetness and a very unique flavor for pancakes. The decor of place is pretty nice, and although I think it's strange to have 4 different people greet you at the door, they were all very polite and friendly, so I can't complain about that. The waiter on the other hand, was a bit slow and kind of surprised when we asked for more water. He came back very promptly, but I wasn't sure why he was surprised that we asked for a water refill. Service overall was on the slow side, but it wasn't enough to ruin the experience, so we'll let it slide.Prices aren't great, but that's to be expected with Jean-Georges Restaurants. that being said, this is probably the one restaurant that won't break the bank when you eat here. You know everything is pretty high quality, so for the most part, it's worth the extra few dollars. Not to mention I had an OpenTable dining check to use, so that definitely helped.In all, you should come here for the atmosphere and the high attention to quality in the food.",6,0,2,Eric J.,"New York, NY",490,923,1792

I also tried calling several times and listening to that annoying recording, but each time I was met with a ""fully committed"" wall.That being said, one random Thursday I was looking for a nice Saturday meal on Opentable when this sucker popped up with availability at 7:30 and 8:00. I was too slow for the 8:00, but snatched up the 7:30 with gusto.

In sum, skip the cocktails, or maybe next time I'll speak up and say mine sucked and ask for a different one.

The lobster rice was my second favorite. Whole, large chunks of lobster mixed with brown rice that was spiced to perfection. To end the evening, Leo gave us a complimentary coconut pure and coconut water drink. It was served in a small glass and was the perfect way to end the meal.

Opentable had completely open availability for brunch 2 days in advance, so I was easily able to get a table for 4. I went with a few girl friends, and you know how that goes, everybody shares some things, has a bite of everything, so it was good I got to try a decent amount of food. Everyone talks about the spring pea guacamole, and I was definitely a fan. I don't really like peas all that much, but it had a great texture, and even distribution of flavors. The tortilla chips that come with it are fantastic, warmed out of the oven, and almost chewy. The fluke crudo was nice, with a bright acidic dressing. The mixed greens empanadas were just ok, but the tomato jam on the side was great.For my main course, I had the grilled fish tacos and also the crab/corn fritters. The fritters sounded amazing on paper, but the flavor wasn't there. Nothing popped. The grilled fish tacos were very good, with a spicy mayo, cabbage slaw, thinly sliced pear, and nicely cooked fish. The tortilla was exceptional.The service, however, was horrendous. Our waiter was absentee for the first 30 minutes of our meal. Everything came out at a different time, but it didn't seem intentional like tapas joints, nor was it explained to us this way. Our table did a shared appetizers + individual entree format, so our meal timing should have reflected that. The worst offense though was that they forgot my friend's main course.

Pipa offered a great sangria at $34 for a giant pitcher that filled 6-8 large glassesExcited to hear they were keeping some menu items, including the sangria, I was shocked to see that the pitcher was replaced by a small carafe serving 3-4 regular sized wine glasses but costing an astonishing $42. I opted for a glass to check it out and while it was still tasty was not as good at the predecessor and more than double the price.(side note if you are looking for a good red sangria Rosa Mexicana at Columbus circle makes a great red sangria which comes in a mini pitcher of 2+ glasses for $14. Also Alta is quite good)  -- My date got the mojito which she enjoyedAs for good I was just not that impressed.The seasonal vegetable platter with dipping sauces was just okay. Vegetables were fresh, sauces mediocre and for $14 a bit overpricedNext came the spicy sweet corn which was quite good but was delivered standalone instead of with other dishes. Again for a small coffee cup sized portion this item should cost much less than $11The gooey spicy ham and cheese fritters were tasty but for me quite rich. This would be good for sharing as one is enough (serving comes with five)The tacos come two per order and price in the $12-14 range. The pulled pork and brisket themselves were good but the toppings such as the pickles onions (pickled way too sweet) and the fried onions (bland) left much to be desired. Even the soft taco lacked any flavorI was hoping the chorizo would be just as good as I remembered at pipa but unfortunately they were never even delivered to our tableService started off well but once the food started arriving we did not see our waitress for 20+ minutes to let her know we were missing an itemBy the time she arrived our table was already fully cleared.

When we finally spoke with someone, she shared that there were some tables that were first come, first serve (communal tables and high tops). We thought that was probably our best bet and ventured out around their opening time of 5:30pm.When we arrived, we were immediately seated at a table in the dining area. It wasn't one of the high top tables or the communal table but we figured it was probably due to us eating so early. The restaurant is dark and modern - a good date spot - with a mix of tables, booths, a bar on the left when you walk in and an open kitchen. We enjoyed the ambiance but it was early and the restaurant was only about half full. As our meal came to an end and the restaurant started to fill up, it was definitely a bit loud. So, a great date spot if you're OK having to talk over other tables a bit. Some of the tables are very close to one another so it's hard not to hear what the table next to you is saying.The menu was divided into raw bar, table snacks, light & bright, golden & crispy, masa & tortillas, wood burning grill and rice. Due to the mixed reviews, we decided not to over order and chose 5 items from different sections of the menu.After ordering we were presented with some spiced chickpeas. They were fried to a golden brown and had a great crunch to them. They were still warm and were a great little snack to start off the meal. Additionally, we were given two types of bread and some olive oil. On each table, there was also a small bottle of orange liquid. When we asked our server about it, he shared that it was housemade habanero hot sauce and that it was good with all of the dishes, even the bread. He also informed us that if it was too spicy they have a jalapeño version they can bring out as well. Adam and I love spice so we enjoyed the habanero hot sauce; though, we also felt it wasn't too spicy for most people to handle.We started with the sweet pea guacamole since everyone had been raving about it. We really enjoyed this and thought it deserved the buzz that it has been getting. The sweet peas were a perfect addition to the guacamole and gave the guacamole an added sweetness that was very enjoyable. It was a twist on a classic that brought to mind bright, sunny spring days. The cool guacamole and the freshly fried tortilla chips were addicting. The fresh peas and sunflower seeds added a pop and crunch to the guacamole that was unexpected but fantastic. The fluke was very fresh and went well with the green chili dressing. The crunchy rice added a textural contrast that was needed. All the components were good, but it wasn't amazing. We both thought this dish was OK. We had decided on trying one of the tacos and thought pulled pork would be a good choice. Each order comes with two tacos and with prices starting at $5/taco (ours were $6/taco) we wanted to see how they compared with the amazing (and cheaper!) tacos fromthe Red Hook Ball Fields and our favorite place in Manhattan (Tehuizingo!). It was evident that the tortillas were freshly made but each taco only came with one tortilla. Traditionally, tacos come with two tortillas but we didn't really mind as the tortillas were pretty hefty and didn't break apart even with all of the filling. Though, for $6, I sort of wanted that extra tortilla! The pulled pork was well seasoned and juicy with the pickled onion complementing the meat well. I thought it was a good taco, but for an almost 200% markup I don't think we will be coming back for the tacos.We were then served grilled Maitake mushrooms that were swimming in a fresno pepper vinaigrette with a dollop of goat cheese in the middle. There was definitely way too much cheese for the amount of mushrooms that were provided and we ended up leaving about half the cheese on the plate. The vinaigrette was slightly tangy and worked well with the savory, meaty mushrooms. Again, something that was enjoyable but not amazing.I had read some good reviews on the Arroz con pollo and decided to order it since we felt we needed something a bit heavier since we ordered mostly lighter dishes. The arroz con pollo was definitely a heftier portion than the previous dishes and contained large chunks of chicken and crispy skin. The chicken was flavorful and incredibly juicy. The crispy skin added some much needed texture to the dish. I found the rice slightly overcooked. With all of the other components of this dish working so well together, it was disappointing that the rice was so mushy.We would definitely come back for the sweet pea guacamole (or maybe I'll just make it at home) but the other dishes were mostly misses. With all of the buzz and difficulty in getting a table, we had high expectations; unfortunately, we felt that abc cocina didn't live up to them.",0,0,0,Vivian C.,"London, United Kingdom",59,105,425
3.0,7/22/2013,"Was here for brunch this weekend. Very excited to have scored a reservation but now wish we had hunkered down and dealt with a wait at ABC Kitchen instead. The service was average (forgot our guacamole and brought it after our entrees had been cleared... thanks?) and the food was fine. I had the huevos rancheros and my companions had the fluke tacos and cinammon pancakes. All were fine but nothing to write home about and the price tags on them were fairly hefty. The pancakes were the worst value IMO with two measly 'cakes and nothing on the side. I'm down for splurging on brunch, but give me something to work with! Would consider returning but will probably wait until the kinks have been ironed out.",1,0,0,Elizabeth H.,"New York, NY",3,10,0
3.0,7/21/2013,"Very pretty restaurant and super popular. By 5:45pm, the only tables available for walk-ins were the communal table in front and the outside tables (95 degree heat, I think not!) We chose the communal table and ordered a bunch of plates to share. My favorites of the night were the patatas bravas (perfect cubes of fluffy potatoes with a crisp exterior served with a creamy and tangy sauce), the crab and corn fritters (it WAS corn fritter day so I had to order it!), and the short rib tacos. The dessert flan was also quite nice with the hint of salted caramel on the crust. The burnt ends were overpriced and nothing special and the shrimp was interesting but not something I would try again. There were bananas and almonds in the shrimp dish, but neither really complemented the flavors of the shrimp.Overall, the restaurant though pretty and hip, was good for one visit, but I don't think I need to return. Glad I tried it once though!",0,0,0,Cynthia M.,"Manhattan, NY",351,1226,25
3.0,7/17/2013,"Debated giving this place 4 stars, but decided it is not quite there yet. I cam here for a birthday lunch with my mom and got the spring pea guac, the shrimp with sizzling garlic, the fluke and fish tacos.The guac and the fluke were both very good, but I was not impressed with the shrimp. Something was just off, possibly undercooked, and the flavors did not add up. The fish tacos were good, but not mindblowing.The restaurant is beautiful and the service is friendly. The waitress brought out flan with ""Happy Birthday"" written on the plate, which was a very nice touch.Note: I attempted to make a lunch reservation here a few weeks ago via OpenTable and only 2:30 p.m. came up. I called to check if there was anything earlier, and they were able to give me a 12pm. The restaurant was very open at this time and there were a lot of tables available...not sure what's going on with OpenTable, but definitely call to double check. The lunch menu is also more limited than the dinner menu.",2,0,1,Nikki A.,"New York, NY",267,500,31
4.0,7/16/2013,"There is a lot to like about ABC Cocina. The food, for one, is inspired, fresh, and downright tasty. The smart wine list also provides several very gently priced bottles of mostly Spanish wines, along with a cocktail list using seasonal garden ingredients much like what you'd expect from the ABC Kitchen offshoot. The décor is also eclectic and fun, a mashup of jewel-toned chandelier lighting and funky industrial furniture. As much as I am in love with ABC Cocina (almost as much as I am swoon with ABC Kitchen) after visiting twice so far, there are a few things that still warrant improvement. As with any new restaurant though, I'm willing to bet that the kinks in service and overall FOH communications will be smoothed out in time.Because I have visited on two occasions, I have been able to try many things on their current menu. Standouts include the spring pea guacamole from the ""table snacks"" section of the menu, which is served with warm crunchy tortilla chips. While I'm all about the strong flavors of lime, jalapeno and cilantro in my guacamole, the spring pea used here adds a sweetness and delicacy that's hard to dismiss. I enjoyed the spring pea guacamole so much that we ordered it during both my visits. Now let me just say that this guacamole should not be compared to authentic Mexican guacamole, because it's truly a different animal. In fact, I wouldn't compare any dishes served here to traditional Spanish tapas, as flavors can be all over the map - but hey, ain't nothing wrong with that.Moving down the menu, to the ""light & bright"" section, dishes I've enjoyed include the snap pea salad, raw shaved fluke, and mezcal cured salmon. The green chili dressing and crispy puffed rice and herbs really add brightness and texture, elevating the simple fluke to a level that's pretty hard to achieve with such a underrated white fish. The mezcal cured salmon is great in its own right, an elegant composition of slightly smoky salmon complemented by cucumber yogurt relish, dill and potato chip flakes. Eaten together, the components taste eerily similar to a deconstructed bagel with lox and cream cheese, albeit a very healthy one. Once you're done with being all ""light & bright,"" the ""golden & crispy"" section of the menu offers up several fried goodies such as the peekytoe crab and corn fritters, and gooey ham and cheese fritters. I personally didn't care for either fritter enough to eat more than one, but that's just because I don't think you need to deep fry an amazing ingredient to impart any flavor; but I'm sure most people come from another church when it comes to deep frying. As for the ""masa & tortillas"" section of the menu, I found all of the tacos and empanadas to be quite delicious. The glazed short rib taco is a definite must-order, hunks of short ribs beautifully caramelized with a slightly sweet and savory glaze all jazzed up with habanero relish and frizzled onions. The chipotle chicken tacos are great as well, a little leaner than the short rib but just as flavorful, topped with a fruity grilled jalapeno salsa. The spiced chicken empanadas may not be a must-order, mostly due to the slightly doughy crust, but good enough anyway when dipped in the herbed yogurt sauce. While most of the dishes here are small plates meant to be shared, you can still find some bigger plates in the ""wood burning grill"" and ""rice"" sections of the menu. I really liked the maitake mushrooms with goat cheese and fresno pepper vinaigrette, as well as the beef tenderloin 'burnt ends' served with a bright chimichurri sauce. I would have never thought to pair earthy maitake mushrooms with tangy goat cheese, but found it to be quite tasty in a strange way. The 'burnt ends' are truly in a class all its own, morsels of tender, beefy gloriousness that made a believer out of me - typically a non-red meat eater. Their take on the arroz con pollo is amazing as well, a generous portion of perfectly seasoned rice studded with huge tender thigh pieces and crunchy crackling skin and lemon. I'm not normally a big fan of rice either, but found the arroz con pollo terribly hard to resist. I know, I know - no beef and no rice, what the fuck is wrong with me, right?Since the food here lends itself so well to wine and cocktails, and well, just a load of alcohol and a fucking good time, I'm also glad that the wine list is reasonably priced. Whether it's the bottles of Rioja we put away, or a carafe of the Sauvignon Blanc they have on tap, or a dangerously easy-drinking gin and coconut water cocktail served in a martini glass - you're guaranteed to leave here happy. Drunk, and full, and very happy.",2,1,1,Cecilia Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,644,43
3.0,7/16/2013,"We arrived for dinner at an elderly hour of 5:16p (yes we were those people waiting for a restaurant was open) for the first dinner service. Obviously, no wait and would recommend getting in that early because streams of people arrived a few min after us and they were told to wait. For two, we ordered: Spring Pea Guacamole: This was so much guac, and really interesting texture with the whole peas Raw Shaved Fluke: Good, but not outstanding. Prob wouldn't order this again. Shrimp with sizzling garlic and chili oil: The waitress gave us spoons to get the soup with this dish. And by soup, did she mean the CHILI OIL? No heart attacks peas. Savory Glazed Short Rib Tacos: By far, best thing we had on the menu. And, i don't even like short ribs. Slowly Cooked Halibut: The stew was great. It was really light so great for the summer. Fish was cooked well / consistently. Side note - i guess spring peas are in season? Portions aren't on the small side so there's plenty to go around.Service was OK.

3.0,7/16/2013,"Being a fan of new foodstuffs in New York City is like a sport, but not the friendly, handshake-at-the-end sort of sporting activity. Food crazes in these parts are more like the ancient Roman gladiator-type sports where victory is achieved only if your opponent ends up dying at your feet in front of thousands of rabid spectators. Take these fucking cronuts for example... it's a whole other level of gustatory mania. And like the cronut, when ABC Kitchen opens a new Mexican-themed restaurant and Google translates ""kitchen"" to ""cocina""... you better be ready for combat. From the first Yelp review, first blog post from Grubstreet, etc..., ABC Cocina's reservation book was filled. Of course this is despite the fact there are over 3,500 other restaurants to eat at in Manhattan alone... but from the way some of these destinations get swarmed like locust, you'd think the only places to grab a bite in this city are ABC Cocina, Lafayette and Spotted Pig. But is all that hype worth it? Does making a reservation weeks in advance with no chance of an instinctual four top being available on a Monday night really pay off ? Sometimes yes, sometimes no... and in this case, it was somewhere in the middle. I was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time to snag a seat at the bar where they happen to serve the full dinner menu. Score! But it was like Black Friday at Wal Mart nabbing that seat, and my date and I surely felt like wounded prey as other patrons jockeyed for position behind our bar stools in the event we had a single muscle spasm that might indicate we're grabbing our check. If we hadn't found that opportunity to sit down, our wait would have exceeded two hours.On the food/drink side of things, it was just fine - nothing to send my taste buds into a conniption fit or anything. We shared the spring pea guacamole (a great starter), ham and cheese croquettes (probably wouldn't order again), the mushroom and kale tacos (eh... didn't blow my socks off), and the BLT taco (awesome - my favorite bite of the night). I also got a tiny house margarita ($13) and my lady opted for the white sangria ($14). It's Manhattan so there's no real sticker shock on the drink price, but it's worth mentioning. In the end, ABC Cocina is the food version of a pair of Beats headphones. It's a hot look, so there's no sign of slowing down anytime soon. But have you ever tried on a pair of Beats? I promise there are better headphones on the market.Beats:headphones :: ABC Cocina:Mexican foodSave that analogy and you'll be sure to save some greenbacks, friendo.",17,21,11,Ruggy J.,"Manhattan, NY",4991,2429,5328

To start it off I had the passion fruit sangria. It was really dissapointing, tasted nothing like passion fruit at all. For $14 you would expect much better!  I moved onto the Malbec on tap which was awesome. For appetizer we shared the calamari which was very different. Don't expect a huge pile of friedness but a simple plate of perfectly crisp calamari with ancho chilis which were softened into something resembling blackberry jam. It was very different and oddly good. We had 3 different types of tacos for our main. Crispy fish,  short rib and the BLT taco. All were delicious!

The oysters were oysters, nothing special about the accoutrement.

I am well-aware of the 'no seating without full party' rule at restaurants, and I'm fine with it, except when I'm looking directly at the communal table where I know they'll seat us and it's completely empty (and will still be empty when my other party arrives five minutes later). The service was on and off - occasionally very friendly and attentive, other times very pushy, and sometimes absent. It was clear that they wanted us to eat as quickly as possible and free up our two seats. Within five minutes of being seated, our waitress came three times to ask if we were ready to order. At the end of the meal, she took the receipt before I had even signed it (and other waiters were very obviously eying our receipt to see if it had been signed).

Guacamole with peas was one of my favorite dishes of the night - SO good! love guacamole and am pretty picky but this might be one of the best I've ever had. Crab fritters were fine but nothing to write home about. Pulled pork tacos - delicious!! My other fav of the evening. So much flavor, melted in your mouth. A bit messy but that's part of the fun. Fish tacos were also good but I thought they had a bit too much of the spicy sauce - overwhelmed the other flavors. Lastly, I love salted caramel - it's one I my favorite things in this world.

5.0,6/14/2013,"Immediately upon entering the expansive space, you can feel the out and out warmth. Perhaps it's the dark unadorned wood, the bustling semi-open kitchen replete with fresh seafood, or the sporadic perfectly placed minimalistic light installations. Or maybe, it can simply be chalked up to the convivial din of conversation, clinking glasses, and notes of sheer enjoyment emanating from the packed house. In essence, it's like meeting ABC Kitchen's flirty, sultry (and dimly lit) Latin sister.You would have absolutely no idea that Pipa once held court here as numerous tables have been pulled out to give the room an almost transcendental airy feel; somehow, rustic intimacy is married with, well, space. (And lots of it.) Sascha and I were lucky enough to arrive just as several couples were leaving, and we were more than happy to sit at the communal tables bordering the bar--in fact, I think we would opt to sit there even if given the choice to sit elsewhere, as it provided a great vantage point on the entire space. (Plus it allowed us to look at--and lust over--every single dish that others were ordering).Though slightly longer and with a robust set of margarita offerings, the cocktail list is very similar to ABC Kitchen's with bright, seasonally-charged drinks made for easy drinking. We, however looked no further than the red hibiscus sangria, which was absolutely outstanding--not too sweet, packed with hearty infused chunks of apples and oranges and was perfectly wine-forward without being the least bit cloying. We munched on fried chick peas and in-house-made focaccia while we attempted to rein in our desire to throw in the veritable menu towel and just ask for one of everything--yes, the menu, is that appealing.Conceptually similar to ABC Kitchen's 'meant-to-be-shared' format, plates range from snacks to small/mid-sized plates to larger, more hearty dishes. All corners of earth, land and sea are more than covered with a number of lightly prepped vegetable and fish dishes, tacos, insane rice preparations, charcuterie and wood-burning grill-fired meat dishes. We began with their charcuterie board with house-cured cornichons and the fluke with green chili dressing and puffed rice. The fluke was out of this world and a definite must--the brightness of the fresh fish along with the slight back-of-the-tongue kick of the chili were a pleasure to eat, especially with the welcome inclusion of the rice's crunchy consistency--an added value to be sure.We went for the shrimp with sizzling garlic and chili oil next and were equally as impressed--this dish is so often mediocre in Latin restaurants, but this one, served in a mini skillet, was spot on. The shrimp were plump and tender, and the garlic: potent--we happily dipped our remaining bread in the oil--and voila, instant garlic bread.We then sampled the spring vegetable salad with manchego and herbs to get a little cheese and vegetable fix--this light dish was the perfect accompaniment to the moor-ish short rib tacos, served with frizzled onions and spicy chipotle. We struggled to decide between their multiple taco-takes (chicken, pulled pork...) but loved these little guys; again, Jean-Georges knows how to compose a rounded dish and the amalgam of tender meat with the slight doughiness of the shell and the crunch of the fried onion made for the perfect bite and awesome mouth-feel.The grilled miatake mushrooms with goat cheese fresno pepper vinaigrette were roasted on the grill and paired excellently with the salmon, a dish that was as springtime fresh as you could hope for, with fragrant romesco, baby clams and a light, bright shaved fennel salad. Flavor profiles of both of these dishes were well-rounded and multi-faceted without being over-complicated, which we definitely appreciated.Finally, though I'm embarrassed to admit it, I insisted that we try the cheeseburger, served with mole and crispy pickle chips--I am SO happy I did...It was unreal. Ingredient quality aside, I was extremely impressed with the smoky undertones of the meat along with how successful (and just plain delicious) the out-of-the-box mole and pickle duo was. While in my head I was already planning my return trip the moment I walked in, (future plans definitely include the roasted maine lobster rice and their take on mussels), I would come back for this burger alone. No meal, even those that leave you loosening your belt or looking for someone to roll you out the door, is complete without at least a bite of something sweet. The popsicles will definitely be a big hit in the summer months but we opted for the cocoa-dusted fritters. They were surprisingly light, chocolatey and just enough to give us that touch of welcome sweetness without throwing us (even further) over the edge.",2,1,0,Victoria G.,"New York, NY",34,136,21

4.0,6/12/2013,"Came here for my friend's birthday dinner with really high expectations.  The ambiance and service delivered but the food (besides the popsicles) did not stack up to ABC kitchen.  The pea guac was promised to be a ""game-changer"" by a fellow yelper, but that was clearly an exaggeration.  It came with approx 8 chips (not nearly enough to eat the guac) and when we asked for more, we were charged for them on the bill!  The civiche and tacos were good but expensive for their size.  Highlight was definitely the seasonal popsicles and our awesome server.",0,0,0,Katie W.,"Manhattan, NY",201,535,342
4.0,6/11/2013,"This place would get 5 stars if the service was better. Overview: made to wait despite the open tables and many spots at the communal table.  I think the purpose was to get us to buy a drink first.  Ambience was good. Cool light fixtures, busy at 9:30pm on a Monday night. The food: excellent. Try the pea soup, the mushrooms, the asparagus, Skip the lobster rice dish. Too much rice, not enough lobster. And way too salty.  Skip the seabass-- the prune flavored sauce was overpowering.",0,0,0,Laura S.,"Wellington, FL",3,77,26
2.0,6/9/2013,"I think the Webster dictionary definition for disappointment should be ABC Cocina.  Quite simply, the hype over this place is completely unmerited.  While it's a cool space, the food is solidly mediocre.  For example, the lauded spring pea guacamole was a generic guacamole with peas.  I was expecting some mind blowing experience because everyone spoke so highly about it and I was totally underwhelmed.  Perhaps, some of these people have never had guacamole before and their first time was quite memorable?  Guacamole aside, with each dish, hopefully ""it gets better.""  Alas, it never really did.  It takes a lot for me to turn down dessert and I had absolutely no desire to even glance at the dessert menu.  That alone should speak volumes about this restaurant.On top of overly priced OK food, the service was painfully slow.  It took over 20 minutes to get our first round of (mediocre) drinks.  We had to request clean plates multiple times which was fairly frustrating.  As a fan of ABC Kitchen, while I don't think it's the best restaurant in NYC,  I feel that it is much better than ABC Cocina.  I had high hopes for this place and they were totally quashed.  Perhaps it will get better at some point down the line but I will definitely not be rushing back on my own dime.",3,1,0,Julie M.,"New York, NY",256,553,27
4.0,6/6/2013,"Definitely met my expectations - which were high. The food was great, very similar to ABC Kitchen. The only reason why it gets  4/5 is that the wait is actually pretty ridic. Great seeing JG in the flesh though! Here is the quick and dirty:Ambiance - for those of you who have been to Pipa, this is EXTREMELY similar. The decor is a little different (no mirrors on the wall everywhere or chandaleirs hanging) but the set up is pretty much the same (high table near bar). I would say that ABC Cocina does look a little less crowded than Pipa and it wasn't as loud as Pipa is (I don't enjoy super loud places - so this was a HUGE plus for me).Service- We had one server at the bar (not the bartender, but just a server dude) who was awesome. Then our regular server at the table was also great but nothing to write home about. He didn't explain dishes which is a ""minus"" in my eyes but he was friendly and the service overall was speedy without being pushy. At the moment, reservations are pretty hard to get since its new so my group of 4 decided to walk in. They told us 45 minutes, which we expected, and had a few drinks at the bar. The actual wait ended up being an hour and a half (!!). A friend of mine had a reservation the night before and still waited 30 minutes. HUGE MINUS. But what can you do? This is the hot spot right now. I'd imagine in a year or so it won't be as crazy?It is pretty pricey (comparable to ABC Kitchen) - also to be expected. I hate to keep comparing it to Pipa but I personally think Pipa does a better job at tapas and prices were great (If you can't tell, I miss Pipa). ABC Cocina, however, is NOT Pipa and therefor do not expect traditional tapas. The menu is more similar to ABC Kitchen (in price and type)Food - I would say 75% of the items we ordered (and we got a lot) are definitely memorable. The other 25% ehh. Some of the items we got that I would recommend:Sweet Pea Guac (an obvious must), Fluke with green chili dressing (not so obvious, but is legit), chicken tacos, pork tacos, arroz con lobster (i have no idea if this was the actual name or not).Things that I didn't think are anything special: Sea bass, Mushroom tacos, some item with jam on the top (this is the one thing I'd say DONT get).Bottom line - go here, enjoy, then realize that ABC Kitchen is ACTUALLY where its at.",0,0,0,S G.,"New York, NY",2,40,0

4.0,6/2/2013,"A unique find as we were on route to Rosa Mexicana. The place looked chic and appealing from a far so we ventured in. The ambiance was very nice and eclectic. The dim lights the white and grey shades with exposed finishes was a unique mix I had not experienced before. We arrived just around 7 and were greeted by three hostesses. Since we did not have reservations we sat at one of the communal tables.Here were our selections from each area of the menu:Table Snacks- Warm marinated olives, poblano and mint pesto I love olives so these hit the spot!Masa and Tortilla- chipotle chicken tacos, grilled jalapeno salsa These very delectable. The chicken had a great deal of flavor and the tacos melted in our mouth. Golden & Crispy-peekytoe crab and corn fritters, with chipotle mayo These were good, but the chipotle mayo made it better. That sauce can make ANYTHING taste good I swear!Rice- Arroz con pollo, crackling skin and lemon zest This thing was so large I knew we would not be able to finish it. I think this was my least favorite dish out of our selections.Dessert-warm vanilla fritters Mexican chocolateCocktail of choice:passion fruit white sangria  Carafe style 44 was really yummy it reminded me of a Mimosa more than a Sangria, but satisfying nonetheless. Enough for us to get two rounds each so well worth it.Plus we got complimentary bread which filled me up beyond belief,  but it was all delicious. I plan to go back quite often and try something new every time.",2,0,1,Sheri S.,"Minneapolis, MN",578,580,1880
5.0,6/1/2013,"This place deserves five stars. Amazing food and service is exceptional. We had:Spring Pea Guacamole - I wanted to submerge myself in a bathtub full of this and eat my way out. THAT GOOD. Pulled Pork Tacos --  Amazing. I had to pause and take a moment after each bite just to savor it. Waitress also said the short-rib tacos are exceptional, which I will try next time. Chicken empanadas - Also great. But we hadn't recovered from the other dishes to fully appreciate it. Spring Vegetable Salad - light, refreshing, tangy, perfect mix of vegetables and manchego. I loved it. Sauteed flowering greens -- like a kale salad. Wasn't that bad, but compared to everything else, the least spectacular. DO IT. MAKE IT HAPPEN. IT'S WORTH IT.

5.0,5/31/2013,"I did like ABC Kitchen, but don't quite get the hype about it. For the new ABC Cocina though, which is getting major hype as well, I totally get it. This was an amazing meal and every single thing I tasted was incredibly good.Even though they're on OpenTable, it says they don't have any tables for the next 31 days, which seems wrong, but I was too lazy to call, and just figured I would chance it and show up early in hopes of getting a table. I got there at 6 PM, and they already had no tables other than the choice of two communal tables up front, or outside seating in the 90 degree heat. I happily accepted a seat at one of the communal tables to enjoy the cool, nice, dark atmosphere of the very hip-feeling restaurant.After the waiter explained that we should get 2-3 dishes per person, I clearly figured we needed at least 7 things for the two of us since I always eat way more than most humans. He looked shocked and told us it was A LOT of food, but I just brushed him off since I knew better and so we commenced with the delicious feast:- Spring Pea Guacamole ($11).Amazing. Some of the best, most interesting guacamole I've ever had. I've never seen it riddled with so much stuff, and the copious amounts of peas were delicious and refreshing. Along with this, the warm, crispy chips also happened to be excellent. We happily accepted more chips when they offered, since there was a very generous portion of guac to eat it all with.- Patatas Bravas ($8)These are always great, but it was all about the sauce here - that rosemary aioli is amazing.- Gooey Spicy Ham and Cheese Fritters ($10)Five little balls of pure deliciousness. These were really great. I tasted mostly cheese and not much ham, but I still don't have any complaints since they were so good.- Savory Glazed Short Rib Tacos ($14)Best tacos in my life. Seriously, so good. These were piping hot, with a very thin and chewy tortilla and a generous amount of buttery soft short rib. I could have easily eaten 10 more of these.- Chipotle Chicken Tacos ($12)These were also amazing, and almost as good as the short ribs. This only makes me really itch to come back to try the several other tacos still remaining on the menu.- Beef Tenderloin Burnt Ends ($18)This was delicious, but maybe not quite as satisfying as the other dishes. This was on the higher end of prices, and it consisted of just six little cubes of beef. Those cubes happened to be extremely good, but after the variety of flavors going on in the other dishes, it just wasn't as interesting.- Arroz Con Pollo ($19)This was probably my favorite dish of the night and it was extremely satisfying as well. For this place, it was a very healthy portion of rice, along with a great deal of chicken. This one was well worth the price tag.Anticipating the shock from the waiter and the shame of it all, I still asked for the dessert menu after we easily cleaned the plates for all seven of these dishes. Dessert is usually my favorite part of the meal, but although very good, the dessert here didn't blow me away like the rest of the food did. I still really did love the Warm Vanilla Fritters and the Soft and Crunchy Almond Cake ($8 each), but they just weren't on the same level as the amazing food that preceded them. That chocolate pudding with the fritters was exceptionally good.I can't wait to come back to eat through the rest of the large, varied, and guaranteed to be delicious menu. I might even consider getting some vegetables, as our waiter suggested and we ignored this time. I also must try every single other taco on the menu. I'll be back soon and early before it gets way too tough to get a seat here.",15,8,11,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
3.0,5/23/2013,"We were sad to see Pipa go but up for trying its replacement! Wednesday night after work and the restaurant was packed. We got the last two spots at the communal table at the bar. There was some confusion at the host table and then with what waiter was helping us as about five different ones stopped by, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they'll clean up their act after a few weeks on the job.Sitting down, you start to get the feeling that a bridal shower threw up in there. Pink doily table mats, cute pink bread dishes from Grandma's china cabinet, flowers & pastel colors on the menus. Perfect bridal shower set-up. Weird for regular dinner/drinks.I do like, however, how they opened up the kitchen, compared to Pipa's wall that separated the cooks from the customers. Food was fantastic. Try:- spring pea guac - Matt got it right on the money - this is a game-changer- raw fluke - so light & delicate & delicious- shrimp with banana - how creative?! Great pairing.Service was just OK. One of our servers, Matty, was great and lovely to talk to, the other kept stealing my wines by the glass menu away from me. And I was pretty disappointed with the wine list. Although I did like that there are several wines 'on tap' - they were all pretty horrible. Flat...boring...table wines. And the two roses I tried off the list were both so super sweet and not fresh & refreshing as a rose should be. I turned both of those away and decided on what I thought would be an easy like - the albarino - but even that glass was just OK. Common Jean....We'll be back because we're Pipa veterans and the local is great for after work drinks...but can we get rid of all the pink shit everywhere???",0,0,0,Megan T.,"Denver, CO",99,290,23
4.0,5/8/2013,"I'm a huge fan of ABC Kitchen, so I couldn't wait to try Jean Georges's new place. The atmosphere is awesome. It's like the dark, super sexy version of ABC Kitchen. Alright now let me break this down!Drinks: Expensive, obviously. Comes with the territory. I tried the banana rhubarb daquiri (when in Rome, right?). Wouldn't recommend it. The banana gave a weird grainy texture that wasn't appealing. Grapefruit margarita was eh. So here are the dishes we ordered...1) Snap pea guacamole-Freaking awesome! Can't go wrong. 2) Fluke-Probably my favorite thing I tried. The puffed rice was a great contrast to the fish. Get it!3) Jamon Iberico-Ok, if you like prosciutto, this is like the best prosciutto you've ever tasted times 100. Salty deliciousness. 4) Ancho chile paste atop fried calamari- Wasn't a fan of this at all. The chili paste overpowered the calamari and had this thick consistency. I felt like I was eating Marmite. We sent it back. 5) Fish tacos-A fish taco is a fish taco is a fish taco, ya know? But this one is reeeeally delicious. 6) Ribs in Chimichurri sauce- Meat cooked to perfection, so yummy. 7) Arroz con pollo- I'm just not a heavy creamy sauce kind of person, so this didn't appeal to me. But if you're into that, it's probably worth a try. For dessert we ordered the passion fruit sundae and flan. O-M-G. Ok, I have a major sweet tooth anyway, but loooooved these. To top it off, the service was impeccable. The waiters were so friendly and very attentive. Even though we sent back the calamari, without asking our waiter returned with a shrimp dish he thought we'd like. Oh, and we met Jean Georges! It was a great night and I would definitely return.
