5.0,5/1/2019,"I've been wanting to come here for awhile! It's a bit priced than take 31 / her name is Han but the ambiance is also a little nicer and less crowded. Service was great. We got the bibimbap, spicy rice cake, and tangy spicy fried wings. Spicy rice cake: delicious, texture was slightly firm because it was pan fried and also very chewyWings: peanut flavor and topping was great. Texture was perfectBibimbap: a solid classicIf I were to come back I'd want to try some of the other menu items, but this was a good start!",0,0,0,Robin L.,"Princeton Junction, NJ",0,12,2
3.0,4/19/2019,"Rice cakes are a must. Good korean bbq overall. Problem with a server however which kinda ruined our good friend date vibe a bit, so I felt the need to comment - my friend and I ordered what we thought was a pretty good amount for two to split family style- two alcoholic beverages, rice cakes, the half and half chicken,  banjan, squid/scallion pancakes and I think something else even. Server was a bit irritated when we didn't order the pricey entrees as well, and told us we should. We asked if it was enough food without entrees and she immediately said NO definitely not. It was a bit weird her attitude. We said maybe we will order entree later and she said all annoyed you can't order later you have to order all at once, odd thing to say for a restaurant. We declined entrees. Long story long ... There was SO MUCH food we could barely eat THE HALF of it. So we didn't need the entrees after all as our guts (no pun intended) told us, just as much as we didn't need the attitude.",0,0,0,Christine E.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,8,0
4.0,4/17/2019,"I love Hanjan!  The food is consistently excellent, the cocktails are well-made, and as a frequent diner there, the waitstaff and manager greet me by name when I go and always thank me for coming, which is a very nice personal touch.  Minus one star for how loud the restaurant can get - understandable at peak dining times in NYC, but not the ideal place if you're looking for a quiet date night!  One of my neighborhood standbys.",0,0,0,M B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0

5.0,4/3/2019,"I wish I could give this place 10 stars.  What an incredible find; small, and I walked past it twice before I found it, but I have had Michelin meals that pale in comparison.  From a culinary perspective I am notoriously difficult to please, but their kimchi pancake, soy poached black cod, and bulgogi bibimbap were utter perfection.  My mouth is salivating just writing this review and I am still dreaming of last night's meal.  The flavors were so perfect and neither subtle nor overwhelming.  The only thing that trumped the food was the service; Julia was one of the best servers I have ever had in NYC.  This place is to be sought out, and I can not wait until my next meal there.",0,0,0,E.

2.0,3/12/2019,"Got the bulgogi bibimbap lunch and while it was perfect and tasty, it was too small a portion to be filling (and at 5'3"" and 115 lbs, I don't require all that much) and already too pricey for a quick lunch ($18) to justify an appetiser, which starts at $12 anyway. Not sure what they're telling themselves qualifies the price level - the thicker paper stock of the menu? The fine print about ""meat raised with no antibiotics or growth hormones... our fish are not overfished and/or endangered..."" - does this automatically translate to 100% more than the fare next door? Perhaps, but it's beyond me. Poor value, there are better options just about anywhere else.",1,0,0,Angel C.,"London, United Kingdom",263,630,2

After reading all the Yelp reviews, I thought maybe it was some odd coincidence since there were many good reviews. A few months later I ordered from them. I got the General Cho's chicken. The dish is great, but around 4am I got violently ill. Based on what I had eaten the previous 36 hours, it was definitely from this food. I threw up once in the morning, and again in the evening, all the while having severe stomach cramps. Once is a fluke, but twice is a pattern. The food is tasty, but eat at your own risk.

The meat was fatty, tender and fell right off the bone.2. Spicy Rice Cake - The sauce was so flavorful. This might be some of the best rice cake I've ever had.3.

2.0,2/11/2019,"Not a fan... there are plenty of other great korean restaurants.... I would pick a different one. We opted for the korean style dinner prefix of $48 which by the way is a mistake - we figured it would be a better deal and perhaps desire the best dishes... we were wrong. You only save $3 for this option and you don't get to pick what you want. The rib option was all fat - no meat on the bone, the soup fell flat - it was probably the worst korean soup I've had, the fish was okay nothing special. I probably enjoyed the side dishes and the yellow tail sashimi the most if I have to pick top dishes. It's also way overpriced for what it is! Thank you, next!

4.0,2/1/2019,Good food and a couple different options for drinks. Lunch doesn't have too much options but it's still good. Lunch special is great and worth it. Reasonable prices for lunch but a bit on the pricier side for regular hours. Usually a lot of people so highly recommend to make a reservation even if it's just for two people or else you get the bar seat if there is any. Seats are pretty close together so not too accessible for kids and people in wheelchair.

4.0,2/1/2019,"A gem in Flatiron.  I was a little disappointed because they were sold out of cod roe but the other dishes made up for it.  The yellowtail was very fresh as were the greens that came with it.  But I think that the traditional ponzu sauce works better than the sriracha sauce that they gave.  The General Tso's Chicken was above average, but nothing to rave about.  The stewed beef was excellent - very tender and stewed in a nice sauce - but the potatoes and carrots that came with it were pretty bland.  The pine nuts enhanced the dish though.  The black sesame ice cream was delicious.  It came out a little too frozen but after waiting a couple of minutes the texture was nice.",0,0,0,Lauren H.,"New York, NY",3,127,296
4.0,1/27/2019,"I prefer the chef's other restaurant Danji more, but Hanjan is great in its own right. Came for restaurant week dinner and am very glad that quality didn't seem to suffer at all - all the dishes we had were solid.- Apps: wild yellowtail sashimi and tangy spicy wings. The sashimi was excellent and I loved the gochujang-based dressing it and the side salad came with! Wings were even better - tangy but not very spicy, but generously doused in sauce and sprinkled with crushed peanuts. Both delicious- Entrees: General Cho's chicken and kimchi fried rice. Both good, but relatively weaker parts of the meal to me. General Cho's chicken was battered and lightly crisp, but frankly I don't remember it much. Kimchi fried rice had good flavour but it was SO heavy and oily that I didn't really want to eat it. I know it's called fried rice for a reason, but it's a little offputting when the bottom of the plate is slick with a thick layer of oil.- Dessert: black sesame and espresso ice cream. Both were super creamy and well made.We had a couple of cocktails as well - both good, nothing to write home about. Hanjan made for a good dinner, though I don't think I'd be back on my own volition.",1,0,1,Millie S.,"Manhattan, NY",384,284,415
5.0,1/22/2019,"Wow, the food here was good. There was not a single thing we ordered that was not amazingly delicious. Here's the breakdown:- Korean fried chicken - golden, crispy, and boneless! Can you ask for more? - kimchi fried rice - really tasty and flavorful-ddukboki appetizer - this was definitely noteworthy. The noodles were spicy and flavorful and also a bit crispy? Very unique - braised short rib - it's like I died and went to heaven. The meat was so tender it fell off the bone. Wow, blown away. Will certainly be back for all of the above.",3,2,1,Diane Y.,"Manhattan, NY",120,203,283
4.0,1/13/2019,"4 stars for the food, 3 stars for the value. This restaurant specializes in Korean Chinese food with a modern flare & crazy Manhattan prices. We got the dwaeji galbi (pork ribs) and jjamppong (spicy seafood noodles), both of which were great and definitely above average Ktown quality. However at $36 for 8 pieces of glazed pork belly and $21 for a bowl of noodles I can't help but feel a bit overwhelmed considering these are still very basic Korean dishes that don't require a ton of thinking/advanced cooking techniques. If you don't have a problem with shilling out $50 per meal I'd recommend this restaurant over anything that's in the vicinity of Ktown NY. It's also a bit under the radar so the wait (if at all) is not as crazy as Take31/Her Name is Han/Five Senses even on Sat nights.",1,0,0,Chi T.,"New York, NY",140,57,274

We were seated promptly and the waitress was friendly and helpful. For starters we had half and half (fried chicken and wings) which were simply outstanding. Especially the wings which had tremendous amount of flavor and just enough crunch. For mains there were pork belly (very good) and mackerel (which was the best I've had so far in NYC).

2.0,12/21/2018,"Man, I was really wanting to like this place, but I was so disappointed. Because of the price point and ambience, I was expecting an elevated Korean dining experience, but nothing about the food was noteworthy. I'm Korean-American and nothing bothers me more than Korean street food being sold for 3x the price of what it's really worth--if you're going to hike the price up like that, then show me something different, show me something that makes the dining experience unique--but none of that was there. Both the mackerel and kimchi fried rice were greasy and nothing special.  The sizzling cod roe bibimbap was also not memorable.

We had also asked for some kimchi sides, but I think the waiters ended up forgetting about it since we were halfway through our bibimbap already when we noticed we didn't have our kimchi.

4.0,10/17/2018,Hanjan is great for any Korean food lovers. This restaurant does a great job with combining traditional dishes with a modern twist. My friend and I went to Hanjan over the summer during restaurant week. We were not disappointed with our wagyu selection. It was jam packed with flavor and surprisingly very filling given the smaller portion side. Hanjan is great for anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion.

3.0,10/14/2018,"I went here on a saturday night at 8; there were quite a few people but luckily we had made reservations. The place is very cute and well-decorated. I enjoyed the upbeat vibe. We ordered the seafood & scallion pancake, spicy ricecake, bulgogi bibimpap, and general cho's chicken. The spicy ricecake was the real star, perfect texture to the ricecakes and a great spicy sauce (which I say as a Korean who eats a lot of Korean food). I also really liked the bulgogi bibimpap as well, the rice was nicely crunchy at the bottom. Unfortunately, the seafood & scallion pancake was trying too hard to be different from the traditional, and general cho's chicken was more fried piece than chicken. The main complaint was that we felt rushed through the entire meal. While we were happy to get food quickly, the waitress tried to clear our plates multiple times before we had even finished! Overall, I like the idea of a contemporary Korean take on food, but I felt like the food still has some kinks and the service made us feel rushed out.

1.0,9/15/2018,This was one of my worst restaurant experiences in NYC. We had a reservation and but were not given a table (even though other people who came in after us were given tables). Apparently they were overbooked but not quite sure how that happens/why the restaurant takes reservations for patrons they don't have space for. We had to sit at the bar in the end but space was definitely too cramped for a proper dinner.Food was so so. Appetizers were overly oily and the kimchi pancake arrived burnt. One of the beef entrees were good (cost $40+ though which is pretty overpriced). Dessert was forgettable.It's quite a popular restaurant but didn't get the hype.

Food was tasty but way overpriced; a typical, trendy restaurant in Manhattan. But unlike most Manhattan restaurants where service is superb, the service here was subpar. First, all the servers and bus people LOVE to clear the tables, for ex: there's one chicken wing on the plate... ""no, we are not done"" is what we had to tell each person who came by to try and clear the table. Second, our server was dopey- she filled our still half full glass of wine with water and did not offer to replace it. Instead, she asked if we remembered if the glass was full and if we were done with drinking. She finally says- ""let me ask my manager if I can replace the glass"" after she realizes she should by the look of disdain on our faces. Fortunately, she does replace the glass of waterwine with a new glass of wine (it's understandable that she's probably a college kid trying earn some cash but she's in need of better training and obvious support from management which leads me to #3.) Third, the manager who had to approve his server replacing the wine was somewhat arrogant. He supposedly doesn't take pictures for customers and ""will have one of my servers come take the picture."" OK... sorry we asked, sorry you get asked, sorry for you, sorry for your employees. Maybe you should reconsider this customer service job bc you sir- your customer service is not good.

The ambience was a bit funny - the lighting was cafeteria chic - very, very bright with no shades, and a large communal table in the center. I did not mind the communal table, but the lights were so bright with the bulbs having no shield, I was thanking the lawdd I didn't meet here on a hot date. This lighting is really unflattering, not sexi, and a bit aggressive. Once the food began to arrive, I quickly forgot about my retinas being oversaturated with unnatural light.The stars of the show were the following:-spicy rice cakes-bulgogi bibimbap-spicy tangy wingsThese items were so perfect, throw in some of their gochujang...oh me oh my.

There was no sympathy or understanding that we did not want a meat dish. Having lived in NYC for over 40 years I must say that this is a highly anti-customer attitude for an ""upper-scale"" restaurant.

Yeah! That's how good it was. We sat by the bar and were immediately taken care of by the sweet bartender (barback was very attentive as well) I tried the raspberry fizz which is one of their ""soft"" cocktails, it's a beautiful drink with an amazing flavor! I didn't try anymore cocktails because the food was very filling but I'll definitely come back to try them especially during their happy hour! The food was absolutely delicious, we shared every dish we got but my absolute favorite was the spicy ricecake ! Every dish had its own unique taste props to the cooks and chef for that! It was a very pleasant experience, the atmosphere and overall decor is very attractive. At the end of our stay the bartender and barback expressed their gratitude I will definitely come back! The only reason I gave this place 4 stars is because the hostess was a bit rude, she told us it was a very long wait when throughout our stay there were some empty tables and even when we left there were also some.

Spicy ricecake was spicy but good. Fried chicken was too much breading. Short ribs were tasty. Squid sauteed was too salty.

I liked that they used the leftover roe of the crab and cooked it with egg yolk, butter and rice. It was really really fragrant. I would order an entire plate of just that fried rice if they had it. We also got the buckwheat noodles in chilled beef brisket broth. They freeze their broth till it becomes a little slushy so its super cold unlike some other places where they put ice which dilutes the broth. Oh and they had some happy hour deals (appetizers and drinks) too which we took advantage of by sitting at the bar.Everything we got was great and the bartender was so nice.

4.0,10/17/2017,"After an evening of live jazz and cocktails, we were ready for dinner and selected Hanjan as the tasty destination.  The restaurant was fairly empty, as it was late on a Tuesday evening, so we decided to just grab seats at the bar.  Despite already having indulged on a few beverages, I ordered a Seoul Mule, which contained the typical vodka (Tito's) and ginger, as well as bekseju and quince for added tartness.  The cocktail was crisp and refreshing.  In terms of the food, we decided to share a few dishes, starting with the Crispy Perilla Leaf Dumplings.  A basket arrived containing 3 large leaves that had been stuffed with diced pork and shrimp and then heavily fried.  While I usually try to avoid fried foods, these crunchy morsels were a total delight.  By wrapping the filling in a leaf rather than a noodle, it infused an earthiness to and enhanced the crunch of the exterior.  The Sizzling Spicy Cod Roe Bibimbap arrived in the traditional hot stone pot.  The crispy rice was topped with scallions, cod and flying fish roe, seaweed, pickled radish, and an egg yolk.  The hearty dish possessed a salty, briny flavor, which was balanced by the creamy richness of the yolk.  The fish was extremely fresh, and each tiny piece of caviar popped in our mouth.   Lastly, we indulged in the rich Korean-Chinese-Style Noodles in Black Bean Sauce.  The thick, long strands were tossed with large slices on onion and heavily coated with the sweet, tangy sauce.  Chunks of tender pork belly added an element of smoke to the dish, making it extremely addicting.  Our bellies were starting to reach their limits, but we could not stop twirling our forks in the pasta.Hanjan's casual, yet classy atmosphere and gourmet-level Korean food led to the perfect ending of a fun night out on the town.  No wonder the restaurant is typically packed at earlier hours!",4,1,3,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640
4.0,10/15/2017,"Hanjan is another one of the restaurants near where we live that we've always wanted to visit but never really got around to it until a random occurrence (in this case, an early night out of work) made it easy to grab a reservation for dinner. The restaurant itself is a few steps above ground level, and it has a nice cozy feel to it, with a small bar at the front and tables in the back, including a long communal table that sits multiple parties. Like any NYC restaurant, the seating can be a little too close for comfort (the folks next to us would not stop talking politics - it is a Friday night, all I want to do is unwind!), but it's not different from any other NY spot. The tables are on the smaller side, though, so fitting our order required a little bit of re-spacing and shifting of the plates. The drink menu has a decent selection of soju and other liquors, although I was disappointed in my watermelon twist (too alcoholic; the watermelon isn't strong enough as the fruit flavor IMO), and the beer selection is limited too.The food menu (conveniently located in a small shelf built into the underside of the table) is pretty compact, so you aren't going to be pondering what to get for all that long. The one thing to note is that everything we ordered was extremely flavorful, to the point of being full-tilt at certain points. The was most evident when it came to the black bean sauce that came on the noodles (and seemed to be the base for the marinade on the beef short rib as well)...very thick and very rich, but it was to the point that we were struggling to finish the short rib (which came out second) more because of how heavy it felt, not the sheer quantity of the food. I really enjoyed the noodles (drenched in sauce and with juicy chunks of pork), and the beef short rib really shows that it had been slow-cooked for a day, given how easily it falls off the bone. The short rib is brought out in a mini-Dutch oven, served with chopped potatoes and carrots...it reminds me of a Korean-style presentation of pot roast. The other dish we got was the seafood stew, which I really enjoyed but does come with a decent amount of heat...so be prepared to sweat a little. That said, I liked the medium level of heat the peppers and kimchi brought, and the amount of seafood was pretty generous.I don't think I could handle the levels of flavor Hanjan brings to the table too frequently, but the food is absolutely delicious, and the portions make it great to share amongst other people. They are on the larger side, though...our waiter told us the seafood stew was good for one person - absolutely not the case.

Rice. Cakes. Are. Magic. Wow I would have just come and had two orders of these so so so good. The sauce is the right amount of spicy and there is just enough pork belly that you get some good meat with out making the dish too decadent. Loved this dish.

The bf had duvels, which is a great beer, nice with spicy food.I can't remember what the entree we split was - something noddle based. It was good, we really liked the kimichi sides, especially the spicy cucumber. Once we ordered some hot sauce (they brought out chili paste) the noodle dish was muchhhh better.

Ssam Set + side of plain white rice ($3).  Yes, you read that correctly... the Ssam set did NOT include white rice.  The restaurant charged an additional $3 for essentially a $0.25 serving of plain white rice.  On the plus side, the pork belly was lean, well flavored, and prepared with minimal fat content.- Sizzling Spicy Cod Roe Bibimbap ($26).  Basically a small bowl of white rice sans everything else that would be included in a traditional bibimbap dish.  Where's my bibimbap?!  Flavor was lacking.  Dish was priced about $10 too high.Pass.",3,1,1,Matt M.,"Manhattan, NY",35,79,200

For Korean food, it's not the best I've had. I think you're paying more for the décor and ambience. The dishes are on the smaller side. There were 5 of us and we ended up ordering a variety of apps and entrees so we could do family style. Appetizers:* Salmon sashimi - I can't really opine on this since I couldn't eat raw stuff. But my friends had no complaints so I guess they were ok. * Spicy  Ricecake - I always like ddukbokki but for some reason, these didn't taste that fresh. It was chewy but I think they also pan fried some of it. Not as spicy as other places I've had it. * Garlic Fried Chicken - We unanimously agreed this was the best. Although I still couldn't really eat chicken, I still gave it a try and yes it was tender and crispy. For entrees, most of us ordered either the spicy pork belly or the cod roe bibimbap.

3.0,8/5/2017,"If you didn't know, Hanjan is a Korean restaurant. I kind of always wanted to try out this place, but everytime I would suggest it to my friends, they would all state how they can get Korean food at a cheaper price. So when it was restaurant week, some of my friends were willing to come since they knew they would pay a fixed price. Overall, it's safe to say my friends were right. Don't come here for authentic Korean food when you can get it elsewhere for better taste, quality, quantify and price. I didn't over off the restaurant week menu, but I ordered the garlic fried chicken which was pretty good. Tasted very garlic-y which I loved, but it had way too much breaking. And the amount you get for a $17 dish is just not worth it. I also ordered the jjahjangmyun (black bean sauce noodles) and it was just too heavy. The pieces of pork had way too much fat. Traditionally the dish is made with a black bean paste, but you add other ingredients to turn it into a sauce. Sadly it tasted too much of the paste and the dish was just very heavy and oily. My friend ordered the spicy seafood broth noodles and it didn't taste bad but you just knew it wasn't the authentic Korean taste.

There were 5 people in that group so it's obvious this place only cares about bigger parties because more moolah! That upset me quite a bit.

Chef Hooni Kim's attention to detail and emphasis on quality ingredients shine through in his dishes from the signature pork fat ddukboki (spicy rice cakes) to the house made tofu to the summer noodles in chilled beef broth. It's an elevated take on classic korean comfort food that pairs perfectly with a great cocktail. If you're looking for typical k-town BBQ, go to 32 but I'd say this is much more special.

Hanjan can be a beacon of hope for all those traversing the unkind concrete jungle of New York City. The dishes felt like it warmed up my cold dark soul. The following foods had the most impact on my psyche:Spicy Ricecake w. Pork Fat (ddukbokki) - The rice cake was perfectly chewy, but not tough. The top layer had a satisfying crunch from being fried in pork fat - a must get.Spicy BBQ Pork Belly w.

Not super flavorful, and I feel like the pieces of pork only consisted of fat. Not much actual meat, so I ended up picking all of the hard pieces of pork out. The sauce was also pretty oily and just not great. For that meager meal that was pretty unsatisfying and not enough to make me full, it cost $17. Wayyyyy too pricey for a meal like that!!! It was a pretty fancy place, and service seemed pretty good (they sat me at the bar while I was waited and brought me water and were very nice) but way too expensive for the food that they serve :( I would skip Hanjan, there are many more lunch spots nearby that are much much better (I've ordered from Kofoo which is highly recommended!!!)",1,0,0,Grace D.,"San Francisco, CA",157,103,366

4.0,4/15/2017,"Hanjan has the decor of a Brooklyn restaurant and you can see that vibe in the ingredient-driven menu as well, which opens with a list of all of their purveyors and highlights ""fresh-killed chicken"" in its yakitori section. It tends to attract a young mostly white crowd.The restaurant is well designed with seating that is great for dates, big groups, and singles at the bar. The food is not Americanized at all. I like that the chef clearly respects the strong flavors and complexity of Korean and the Chinese and Japanese inspired items on the menu and builds it with dishes that are traditional, even if they are a bit unconventional in the context of the rest of the nyc restaurant scene. My second time there, my entree was a big bowl of beef broth with slices of beef floating it it, with kimchee and rice on the side. It was great. If something is supposed to be spicy (like the delicious seafood stew) it will be. Just because that level of heat is a challenge for me doesn't mean it wasn't the right choice to make the dish taste the best it could. The servers don't ask how spicy you'd like it and I'm not sure that it could be changed if you asked.Service is attentive, drinks are great.

2.0,2/15/2017,"Came here for a Valentine's Day dinner with the bf. The whole restaurant had a $85 pre-fix menu. We got a reservation at 8.45pm and came right on time. Then we had to wait for almost half an hour for a table to clear up... at first, I was like, fine, people take their time on this romantic day. However, once we sat down, we started to realize why people took so long. The wait between dishes was ridiculous!! You could easily have to wait 15-20 min between small dishes that could have been finished in one bite. Not to mention the Banchan Trio they snug onto the menu as one of the dishes, the tiny Kimchi, dried squid, and bean sprouts. Really?! You are a frigging Korean restaurant! And it was not like the Kimchi was any good, the saltiest one I've ever tried, period. I've been reading other comments, and perhaps they thought this would be special because they don't usually give you any on a regular day, smh.After getting the Banchan, we waited for another 15 min (surprise, surprise). At that point, I was so tired and done. They made me wait to the point where I was hungry before but not hungry anymore, despite the fact that the restaurant was pretty empty at that point. We just told the waiters we wanted to pack everything up. We still didn't get to leave until 11pm something.I think the problem must have been with the kitchen. It's not like the restaurant was extremely busy once we sat down, especially thereafter. More important, the whole restaurant had the same pre-fix menu for the day. Like, come on! You knew what you had to cook, how many people had booked your place. Why couldn't the flow be better? We weren't the only ones who packed the last dishes home. In fact, we followed the tables on our left and right.Hence, my two stars. If I could throw the menu at the person who organized this day, I would. This doesn't mean the service was all bad though. The waiters who took care of us for drinks were really attentive.

The people next to us ordered the trio, which looked like a better option, so next time, I will definitely try that one instead. The chili shrimp were great. The sauce was awesome and the tempura was good well -- not too crunchy and not too soggy. Also a good size portion. The Wagyu beef rice was definitely the winner for me. It came with 2 different sauces, a red ""spicy"" sauce and a black bean sauce. The black bean sauce was amazing. Would have eaten just the sauce on plain white rice! Really loved that the menu has S/M/L markers so you know about how much food you're going to get. The atmosphere was adorable as well.

Just enough to feel like you were at a ""spot,"" but not so loud you couldn't carry on a conversation. The menu has a prix fixe option, as well as small and large plates. The two of us opted for 3 small plates and 1 large and it was plenty. The small plates are generously portioned. I wish my stomach as bigger though cause there was so much more I wanted to eat!Started with an amazing Korean Poire cocktail - would go back just for that drink it is so good and nicely stiff. Perfect balance of tart and sweet, with some grown up complex herbal flavors. For dinner we started with spicy cured cod roe over rice (delish), graduated to perilla leaf dumplings with shrimp and pork (delish), stuffed our face with fried chicken (heavenly) and, though we were full at that point, demolished a giant seafood pancake. I mean fingers were licked and brows were wiped it was so damm good! The seafood pancake is piled high with scallions and very very fresh seafood. It's like a delicate fried layered cloud of goodness. Of course all that also required more drinking. One of the great surprises of the night was a tall frosty glass of Makgeolli, an unfiltered rice beer. It looks like a beer mug of milk but the taste is perfect for the richness of the food - refreshing in all the right ways. We ended the night, albeit reluctantly, with a palate cleansing scoop of tangerine sorbet. As we were leaving, the ramen broth became available at the bar (you can only order it at the bar after 9 pm or so, when it's ready after simmering all day). It smelled so good we almost took our coats back off and sat at the bar for more! But that would have rendered me unconscious, and therefore unable to write this review.

Unfortunately, we had an annoying incident to start:The waitress made a mistake and it was like pulling teeth to get them to fix it.We sat down with a table of 6, and she asked 1 person for his order. He ordered 2 dishes a la carte. The waitress asked who he was ordering for. He said he was ordering for just himself and his wife. Inexplicably, she left our table without taking the orders for the 4 other people at our table.Eventually we got the attention of a different waitress about 20 minutes later, when we realized what had happened.She asked for our order. The 4 of us wanted to order the sampler, but she said that we couldn't order the sampler because their policy is that everyone at the table has to order the sampler.I had to explain to her, and then AGAIN to our waitress, what had happened. They were completely rigid and unapologetic until I told each of them, bluntly ""YOU made a mistake by not taking our order and ignored us for 20 minutes.""If they had taken our order, then we would have found out right away about their sampler policy. We could have adjusted our order. But they ignored us and didn't even take our order for 20 minutes! It took another 10 minutes for her to discuss it with her manager and they finally did the fair thing: allow us to order the sampler set for 4 of us, while the other couple ate their a la carte meal.The restaurant staff didn't seem to realize that they ignored us, delayed our meal by 30 minutes, and made it extremely frustrating to place our order.I don't mind the initial mistake. I don't mind abiding by a policy. But after a clear mistake on their part, it shouldn't be that difficult to make a simple fix. Frankly, we deserved some sort of compensation after that mistake, but none was offered.Sampler:Hiramasa Kingfish Tartare over Ricegreat, use of seaweed and sesame sauce was excellent.Spicy Ricecake w.

Perfect.Fried Chicken (avoid)This course was subpar and it came at the wrong time. The chicken itself was cooked perfectly, but there was too much batter, which had a very light and cheap texture. It sat very strangely in our stomachs and almost ruined the rest of the meal.Spicy BBQ Pork Belly, Wagyu Short Rib w.

The standout was the terrific nut / soy based sauce.Kimchi & Beef Brisket Fried Rice w. eggWe were super full and didn't have room for fried rice at all.Ice cream My favourites, in order: Black sesame, grape, red bean. For some reason the females liked red bean, males liked black sesame.

It's a lovely space with a central bench and bench seating with nice bulbs suspended above and more conventional seat seating elsewhere. The service was great and the food was great. The reason I'm dropping a star is the pricing; a lot of what is served here you can get for a fraction of the price in Ktown and some dishes come for free there.

3.0,10/7/2016,I used to come here for lunch and it was always good. Tonight I stopped by for dinner and it was disappointing. Their menus were overpriced. The dumplings were good but pretty oily. The mackerel was skinny and not meaty at all. The skewers were so small. Overall I felt the ingredients weren't a good quality for the price. We left the place feeling still hungry. They have nice ambiance though. It is quiet for Friday night. We didnt have to wait.

I decided on the crispy rice cakes that were very tasty and definitely a good choice.  For the larger one, I was going to get the seafood pancake but my server told me the mung bean pancake with pork and kimchi was a better choice as the seafood one was very ""heavy"".  I probably should have gone with my instincts and gotten the seafood one.  The mung bean was ok but there was no flavor of kimchi and it had sort of odd bites of pork mixed in.  I'm still giving them 4 stars as I think I just made a bad choice as the food at the tables around me looked as tasty as the rice cakes were.  I don't typically stay in this neighborhood when visiting the city but if I do find myself here, I'll definitely stop back.",0,0,0,Ann K.,"Sylvan Beach, NY",49,607,1

4.0,9/20/2016,"Went on Saturday for dinner with a couple buddies for Ganjang Gaejang, a unique Korean dish that is raw crab marinated in soy sauce. We were able to get it thanks to my friend who reserved it almost a week in advance. Don't know many places that do this in New York, but it was fantastic. The crab meat was full and juicy but what made it was the sauce. It was a delicate balance of salty, sweet, savory, and just a perfect amount of heat. Another special item on the menu only served in the summer is the Naengmyun, cold buckwheat noodles. A simple dish but great in the summer heat. I also recommend the spicy rice cakes which are crispy on the outside and was a tad too spicy and sweet.  Overall, a solid modern take of Korean food catered to the American palette but staying true to authentic Korean food.",0,0,0,Kyle R.,"San Francisco, CA",263,44,48

Favorite was skewers.Reason for the deduction was that all the dishes were either too sweet or too salty, or a combo of both.

2.0,8/9/2016,"Meh, I've experienced better is entirely true. A Korean place that didn't serve any banchan, that's a bad sign already. Didn't have a single piece of kimchi the whole night. WTF? How can you call yourself a Korean establishment when you have no kimchi? That's like a Chinese restaurant with no white rice. Would YOU go? Came here with a few friends recently and was not impressed. The portions are ridiculously small for what you pay. I guess it's all about the novelty of this place because the food tasted the same as any quality Korean food place in K-town just a few blocks over. The decor is nice but not traditional in any sense and paid no homage to the culture from which the food is derived. I wouldn't even come here on a date because it was so loud. There were many people here but oddly enough, only saw perhaps 1 or 2 tables of Koreans. Just look at the menu. $12 for ddukbokki (spicy rice cake) that had 8-10 pieces of chewy rice cake. $12 for 5 balls of deep fried chicken meat that tasted very similar to KFC. And listing banchan as item to be ordered on your Restaurant Week menu, madness! Their famous jajangmyeon tasted like fusion of Malaysian char kway teow and and Hokkien char mee. I am not saying the food tastes bad, on the contrary, it's quite good. But in the end, is the food similar enough to something you could get elsewhere for less money and larger portions? Yes.I don't understand what this place is supposed to represent. Is it designed for millennials who have money and want to get dressed up to go out to a loud restaurant? The restaurant that has Korean food up-charged 200% from their inspirations in K-Town? Charged over $200 for 5 who were still hungry afterwards, I'd rather spend it elsewhere.

I discovered this restaurant when Chef Hooni Kim participated in the annual Celebrate Flatiron Chefs event in Madison Square Park. My company had a arranged a group of volunteers to help out at the day of the event. Each volunteer found opportunity to sample tastings at each restaurant's table. Hanjan was definitely THE name (destination) with the buzz to check out! The tasting was all I needed and I am glad 1) I finally made it to Hanjan and 2) Hanjan's participating in restaurant week!For restaurant week dinner, it's a four course meal.Course 1 I tried the Mung bean pancake with kimchi and pork. It's one piece but don't let the description fool you. It's probably 3-4 inches in diameter but it's packed thick and tight and was flavorful (with the sauce) and filling!I did get to taste the banchan trio which was good. I don't remember clearly but they're traditional side dishes - I think bean sprouts, kimchi and radish.Course 2 I decided to try the spicy rice cake with Pork fat. It was all starch but oh so yum and I would order it again!! The rice cakes are like long rolls like a cigar but 2"" long.I also tried the garlic fried chicken with pickles. When it comes to Korean fried chicken, they're all always good!Course 3 I feasted on the BBQ Wagyu Short Rib with Ssam set snd it was glorious. Love Korean meats!!! Also tried the kimchi & beef brisket fried rice with egg - I love almost anything with egg and this was amazing! Think bibibimbap but with more meat (ground) and with a (1 chili pepper) spicy kick.I tried the spicy soy braised chicken over glass noodles as well. All dishes we had blew me away. Quality and portions, creatives and well executed - how did I not know and visit Hanjan sooner??Dessert was simple and satisfying - I had a scoop of black sesame ice cream which was creamy and flavorful (as long as you like sesame). Also tried the  mango which was refreshing but maybe a little too sweet (like syrup sweet) for a sorbet.Overall two thumbs up, arms waving! Wonderful dinner, cool and airy setting.

I think you're paying for ambiance and if you want the same food for less just go up a few blocks to 32nd street. If you want a fine dining experience go to Hanjan. Everything was close to authentic tasting but also it appeared everything had been altered perhaps to make a modern twist on it. For example seafood pancake was no pancake, it was basically a deep fried fritter like you get in Indian restaurants. Less doughy, more crunchy and greasy. The fried chicken was great but reminded me of just southern fried chicken with crunchy batter. Spicy rice cakes were deep fried to add a new element. Actually everything seemed greasy and fried, which seemed great at first but we felt grossed out after our appetizers. Anyways it's worth a try, if you like sharing small plates.

3.0,1/23/2016,"Went for NYC Winter Restaurant Week 2016 on a Wednesday night. The place was full and the space is pretty small so the spaces between tables are almost non-exsistent. The room was also quite loud so my friend and I couldn't quite comfortably chat without yelling at each other and having our neighboring diners listening to our conversation, not that we were talking about anything confidential.I love the decor and the ambiance in overall (minus the loud noise of people chatting). The lights were so dim that it was really hard to take pictures of the food (very important for avid Yelpers!). I had the salmon sashimi, kimchi and beef brisket fried rice, and a scoop of black sesame ice cream. All off the restaurant week menu. My friend had the spicy rice cake, spicy squid stirfry with organic somyun noodles, and the black sesame ice cream.Appetizers:- Salmon sashimi: probably the highlight of my dinner! The chef set the bar really high with this sashimi. The salmon was fresh and both the sauce and seasoned shaved ice elevated the dish to another level-Spicy rice cake: came with this edible string thingy on top which I didn't know what it was and didn't really care so much about, but the rice cake was great! It's got a fried texture on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside. All the rice cake I'd ordered before this one did not have the crispy fried texture on the outside, so this is a big plus.Entrees:This is where it got disappointed, hence the 3-star review.-Kimchi and beef fried rice: maybe it's just me, but it tasted a little on the bland side for me. The fried rice packed a lot of flavors but salt wasn't one of them. Portion was huge, that was the only plus for me.- Spicy squid with organic somyun noodles: was okay. The squid was good but the noodles I didn't care so much.Dessert:- Black sesame ice cream: was awesome!Service was great, all the staffs were friendly and were eager to help explain all the menu items to you.

We were able to make a reservation on OpenTable for that same night so that made the choice easy for us too. Unfortunately we weren't there on a Monday and didn't realize they had special Monday menu items which are more a fusion of Korean-Chinese. Saw quite a few things on that menu that we would've liked to try! This isn't a light meal. Skewers, seafood pancake, kimchi beef fried rice, spicy stew. All very good but heavier items, hot and with some spice. Modern vibe to the place, good service and great meal! If it's still around on our next NYC visit, we'll try it out on a Monday!",1,0,2,Mel L.,"Vancouver, Canada",55,190,111
3.0,1/4/2016,"Disappointed, and it pains me to say this so much seeing that Danji is one of my favorite NYC places to eat, and where I was Duke on Yelp for a long time there. Hanjan missed the mark for a few reasons. Here is one that really pissed me off, and which will result in me not returning. They have a tasting menu which I thought would be the best way to try many of the dishes that I expected would amazing.  When asked if both of us dining needed to partake, we were told, ""yes, as the portion size and presentation are the same as a stand-alone dish"". STOP AND PAUSE HERE. What I didn't realize, and quickly should have, is the pricing doesn't make sense - not even close. If you elect to do the tasting menu, you will pay close to $30 more than if you ordered just the straight menu items, which are the same portion and same presentation! Now, you might think that the one scoop of bland ice-cream which isn't on the menu is worth the $30 - but I can assure you, it is not.  The Atlantic Salmon Sashimi gets one star. The dish was great, flavorful and tasty. Couldn't have been better. The chicken wing of the day was a miss - a major miss. Lacked salt, and really any flavor. The spicy rice cake with pork fat also gets a star. This was really good and with the spicy sauce that many a Danji dish are served with. The kimchi fried rice, which looked great was borderline inedible. The rice they elected to use was just plain bad. It was left nearly entirely as it was presented - well, minus the egg which was cooked well. The service also feel way short and not even close to my 20 experiences at Danji. Dishes were just put down - no explanation as to what they were, ingredients, or anything. Technically, if you want to look, yes, you can pull out the menu from the sliding drawer and see, but the lack of personality and warmth not only from our server, but also the staff putting out the dishes was clearly felt.  Yes it is winter, but I don't ever want to feel cold personalities.",3,3,1,David B.,"New York, NY",832,145,6
3.0,12/6/2015,"I'm going to say three stars because this place is so pricey for what the food is. Pros:Super cute cozy interior with lots of coat hangers (that's a big bonus!)Happy hour deals with $10 apps and 1/3 off drinksCons:Price is high for pretty standard Korean food without a big fusion twist like you would see at say OijiFlavor wise I personally felt like a lot of the dishes were oversauced which made many of them taste similar.

3.0,11/22/2015,"I have had my fair share of Korean food. I would label this place 'modern korean'. The menu is very interesting, with modern twists to traditional korean food, such as 'pork fat ddukboki'.The decor and ambiance at this place is truly beautiful. The juxtaposition of hanging lights and dark wood awe you when you first enter. However, I felt that the food could have been better for the price point.My friend and I were not hungry when we ate here, and just wanted to have a taste of something different. We ordered the ddukboki and wagyu fried rice to share. The waitress kept pushing her recommendations of having at least 2 dishes per person which made me quite uncomfortable. I understand that there are recommended portions per person, but there is a difference between recommending and pushing.My friend and I were uncomfortable pushed here, which made us question the service- which is another star off. The ddukboki is unique- fried in pork fat and extra spicy. However, the pork fat flavors didn't really come through- and although good at first (perhaps because of the novelty)- after awhile it hardens up- so it feel like you are eating stale ddukboki.The flavor of the Fried rice was very good, but the wagyu beef wasn't very present. 3 stars for a beautiful restaurant, a really good cocktail, and good food.

Best version I've had anywhere.  Including some famous places in Seoul. Really chewy noodles, and bean sauce with just enough of a salty punch, slicked with pork fat.  The other Korean-Chinese items are great too (especially the bokkeum bap/fried rice), but the jjangmyun is next level.  Seriously, these guys should just open up a jjangmyun shop so I can go a couple times a week.",0,0,0,J A.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,66,1

I'm  sure that i must sound SoOOOo ignorant not to realize the culinary research and skill required to add heat to wings and splash on like a baby's piss worth of seasoning glaze.

Went on Saturday with a party of two, we ordered:-Salmon Sashimi Salad - this is the exception to my intro note above. This is DELICIOUS. The dressing with it is perfectly acidic to complement the fish. So so good. -Spicy Rice Cakes - fried deliciousness covered in some spicy sauce. Really big portion.-Seafood & Scallion Pancake - nothing like scallion pancakes you're used to. It's massive and fried. As expected, the seafood portion of it is much less than the non-seafood portion.-Kimchi & Brisket Fried Rice - a must at Hanjan. Hard to stop eating this. Not fried, but very oily.-Housemade Soju - for $20, awesome value.

She had been raving about how she could not get a table every time she came.  So here we are.The interior is very clean and comfortable with modern feel. There is a bar at the entrance and tables on each side of the room and one down the center. We were seated at the end near the entrance of the kitchen. The menus are tucked in a little area underneath the tables which I thought was very neat.Our waiter had a heavy Korean accent, answering most of our questions half way then ending with "" yeah..."" and "" you know..."" as if we were suppose to know. The menu was smaller than we expected. Unfortunately some of the items we were looking forward to try were only served on Mondays.Eventually we ended up ordering Atlantic Salmon Sashimi, Pork Fat Ddukbokki, Spicy BBQ Pork Belly Ssam Set, Korean Spicy Ramyun, and some fried rice. Atlantic Salmon Sashimi : Served with icy cold sauce and lots of seaweed mixed in. Your suppose to mix it before you eat it.Pork Fat Ddokbokki : Everyones favorite It was crunchy and crisp on the outside yet chewy and soft on the inside, drenched with a spicy and tangy sauce. Spicy BBQ Pork Bellt Ssam Sset : Very cute presentation with a little pot of lettuce, your meat and sauce on a three item plate.Fried rice : Not too memorable for except that it was too salty for me.

The atmosphere was cool and modern with wire lamps lighting the place. There's a full bar as well; it seems like a cool place to get a drink after work. We each got the sizzling bibimbap which comes to the table literally sizzling in a hot stone bowl, which is awesome. That's how bibimbap should be prepared. The rice at the bottom crisped up excellently and the fried egg on top had the most golden looking yolk I've ever seen in my life. Quality if I may say so myself. The chili sauce probably could have been a bit spicier, but I have a low tolerance for spice so I enjoyed it. My only qualms were that we had to ask for spoons and the chopsticks were cheap. On the other hand, the wait staff didn't bother us which was nice; we had to wave them down as if we were actually in Asia.

And everyone that I have recommended it to have become regulars there as well.Must haves include:- homemade cold tofu: a very simple dish but it's so soft and silky and flavorful- spicy rice cake (ddukbokki): one thing that really makes Hanjan's ddukbokki stand out is the crispy texture of rice cake which gives a good contrast to its thick coat of spicy sauce- seafood & scallion pancake: again, one thing that Hanjan does so well is making this dish so crispy and also it's loaded with seafood unlike the typical seafood pancake you will get in ktown- Kimchee & brisket fried rice: fattiness of brisket gives such a rich and deep flavor to this dish. It's meant to be shared but I would have no problem eating the whole thing myself...- skewers especially chicken skin: all skewers are great but my personal favorite is chicken skin. It's super crispy on the outside but just the right amount of fat gives a slight chewiness to it. If you are a bit more daring, braised oxtail is excellent (although they may be seasonal), and Hanjan  tends to rotate their stew dish seasonally as well. And of course late night ramen is a must as well. And if you can get a group of 6 or more people together, Hanjan's bek-ban dinner is amazing. At only $60/pp you get to essentially sample all dishes at Hanjan plus tons more. Highly  recommended!",1,0,1,Jung L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,3
5.0,5/21/2015,"I was skeptical but ended up loving it. Got the ddukbokki, garlic chicken, and the brisket fried rice. Everything tasted amazing, and I am generally not one who eats chicken or fried rice.Only thing is all the seats at the bar were taken for happy hour. I wish they would have let us order from the happy hour menu from the dinner tables given we'd gotten there for that.A bit pricey in my opinion, but was a satisfying meal. While it's not traditional Korean food and is a bit fusion-y, it was also very satisfying. Service was good, ambiance was nice. Not too loud. A very cute date place.

4.0,5/13/2015,"Hanjan is the sister restaurant of the more well-known Danji in Midtown West. It's what I would probably classify as refined hipster Korean food, so expect to pay a little more than the places along Ktown.I stopped by for an early dinner and was pleasantly surprised to see that they offer happy hour 4-7pm every day (including Saturday!) if you sit at the bar. This means drinks for 1/3 (excluding bottles of soju, sake and wine) and a decent selection of $10 appetizers. You can also order the full food menu at the bar.Highlights were definitely the ddukboki and oxtail. The ddukboki is fried at the end to give it a nice crunchy texture and coated in a sauce that had a bit more kick to it than what I've had in Ktown.If you like it hot, definitely try the chicken hot pot. The waiters are required to warn you that it's VERY spicy because you can't send it back. It was a little too painful to eat for me but my boyfriend really enjoyed it.I've also heard great things about the ramen here (available only after 9pm) so I definitely want to come back again soon to try that.",3,0,2,Michelle W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",92,167,79

I think that was my favorite thing.        Then we had the dumplings which were crispy with a good amount of filling without being too much.  I liked them better without the sauce they came with.  With the sauce it was too salty.     Next we had scallion pancakes which were different than any other scallion pancake I've had.  Usually there are tiny pieces of scallions, but on these there are huge chunks of whole scallions all over.  There wasn't much seafood but it was still pretty good.  I did really like the sauce that came with it (I think it was ponzu).     Last we had the brisket fried rice.  That was my least favorite thing.  It was ok but I thought it had some taste like it had been overcarmelized to the point it was burning on the stove.  Maybe it was cooking too long, not sure.  The bill for all that was $71.  Overall I really liked Hanjan and I would come back.",0,0,0,E R.,"Manhattan, NY",41,137,32

5.0,4/24/2015,"Hanjan is freaking awesome! My first time stopping into Hanjan was a over a year ago and it quickly became one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. Chef Hooni creates some of the most amazing food you will taste, playing along the line of traditional and modern Korean dishes, some of which will seriously blow your mind.Not only is the food incredible, but the hospitality is top notch. The staff is happy to suggest their favorites and help choose a sake or Japanese Whisky (both are a must!) They have created a fun atmosphere that is makes you want to share a bottle of sake with some friends and split as many plates and you can!I have tried just about all of the menu at Hanjan, but here are some of my favorites:Ddukbokki also know as rice cakes w. pork fat is a holy sh*t kind of dish! Prior to ordering this dish I had no idea what ddukbokki was, but boy am I glad I ordered it. Perfectly addicting hot sauce coats the succulent rice cakes.. I am salivating just thinking about this dish. Atlantic Salmon Sashimi is a dish I ignored for far too long. I thought, what could be that exciting about some salmon sashimi? Well them I tried it, and my mind was blown by the incredible use of textures and the ridiculous gochujang vinaigrette.The scallion pancake is another dish that you really must order. You may think you've had scallion pancakes before, but you have never had one like this! No meal is complete without the Korean Spicy Ramyun. This is a seriously flavorful ramyun with perfectly cooked noodles. Just remember that the beauty behind this ramyun is the 12 hour broth, so it is only available after 9pm. (Expect tip: order a few things to start the meal and then throw in the ramyun at 9).Don't forget to take a look at the skewers. The spicy thigh is so spicy and so good! Also if you are feeling adventurous get the heart, you won't regret it! Hanjan is seriously unreal.

The salmon sashimi bowl was perfectly balanced salty and spicy, the beef lettuce rolls were well matched with the fermented bean paste and the pork noodles were moist and garlicky. A great mealThe food is mildly spicy. You can taste the heat but it is not overwhelming -- allowing you to enjoy the other flavors. We took our kids aged 7 and 10.

Their tasting menu was excellent, and I especially loved the Atlantic Salmon Sashimi - it's got a very clean taste with a hint of sesame oil, which came across as distinctively Korean with a little twist. Their Dae-chu (jujube) bourbon was also great; I'm not a fan of bourbon myself, but my date seemed to really enjoy it. There was a lot of food, and since we'd made the mistake of snacking before coming, we had hard time finishing as we got towards the end of the course. The waiting staff were attentive of this and offered to pack the rest to go, which was very nice of them. They still let us finish the dessert first as well.

I've recommended the restaurant to many friends with 100% confidence that they would enjoy their experience. However, last night we were rushed out of our table, in a similar experience to many of the ones described in the less-stellar reviews below. It seems unwise to me to plan to turn tables after an hour on a Saturday night, especially given the pacing of the kitchen and the format of the restaurant. This issue seems to be occurring with enough frequency that the staff at Hanjan should probably take a look at addressing. Also, if you need to turn a table, it's no biggie to ask us to finish our drinks at the bar - but telling us that the next table has been waiting 40 minutes is unnecessary (especially after we didn't protest getting up) and just made us feel uncomfortable. I don't think it's unreasonable for a table of four to enjoy an hour and a half eating. It's not like we camped out for 3 hours.  Please fix this recurring issue, Hanjan, so I can go back to giving you 5-star reviews.",0,0,0,kim r.,"Manhattan, NY",1,36,2

Different from typical ddukbokki in that the ricecakes are caramelized and slightly crispy. Great flavor and texture.- Salmon sashimi with gochujang vinaigrette. I'm only mentioning this because of the vinaigrette.- Makgeolli!!! At first it tasted so delicious I thought they made it on site, but when I went back this past Thursday, sat at the bar and it's just your typical store-bought bottle of makgeolli.

Last up was the Spicy Cod Roe Soup.  Sort of like a spicy, savory dessert, this soup just filled in all the empty spots in my belly.  We each paired dinner with a couple of Makgeollis (sp?, unfiltered rice beer) which is delicious and a perfect complement to the spicy cuisine.  Hanjan is definitely on my list of go to places now.  Well done, Chef Kim, well done.",0,0,0,Theresa D.,"New Rochelle, NY",0,2,0

5.0,2/19/2015,"This is the real deal. You can't get better Korean food in Manhattan. That is because Hanjan does the basics right, starting from the ingredients.Korean food is not just ""BBQ"" and ""pancakes"" and spicy MSG stews.The Korean food at Hanjan is the real deal because it actually respects the individual ingredients of every dish as well as shows a deep understanding of the culture from it comes. To give you some examples:Dduk bokki (spicy rice cake fried in pork fat): This is a must-have at Hanjan and is one of my favorites there. This dish reaches back to the origins of dduk bokki. Dduk bokki is a common dish--you can find it anywhere on 32nd Street, really--but people rarely inquire into what the name of the dish actually means. Dduk = rice cake bokki = fried. At most places, the dish is served as rice cakes drowning in a pool of red MSG red pepper sauce (those are OK too when you're in the right mood). At Hanjan, the dish is served as actually fried. This is the lesser known style of dduk bokki found in outdoor street markets of Korea. They usually offer two types: soy fried and red pepper fried rice cakes. Hanjan combines these two (savory and spicy) and upgrades the frying oil by using pork fat. The pork fat adds a tremendous amount of flavor to it all so it doesn't taste like just ""grease."" (I tried the original in Korea recently, and found it a bit greasy because the oil didn't have much flavor). The dish at Hanjan is accompanied by the familiar fish cakes usually found in the saucy version of the dish. It is topped with half of the always perfectly soft-boiled egg and thin shreds of dried red pepper.Gamja-tang (pork-neck stew): Koreans have a big stew culture, especially when drinking. There is always some sort of stew on Hanjan's menu, and the Gamja-tang is the latest on their menu that I've tried. The flavors are authentic--just spicy enough, but because they don't use MSG, it tastes clean.  There is no lingering salty after taste that you have to try to quench through repeated and numbing gulps of soju.  The meat is tender enough, but still offers resistance (I mean, you still feel like you are consuming meat) because they cook it just the right amount and stop there. Other Korean places, especially on 32nd Street where a lot of tourists go, tend to make these stews and soups way in advance and heat them over and over again so that flavors become quite muddled together, suffocated by loads of MSG.Garlic fried chicken / Tong-dak: The dish seems simple enough, but it is a work of art, precisely because of that. This is the fried chicken that I grew up eating in Seoul, but probably better because Hanjan uses fresh-killed chicken. The freshness of the chicken makes a huge difference--the resistance of the REAL MEAT factor is there again.  It is juicy, while the coating is crispy and seasoned just right. They don't smother it in sauces, but allow the fresh chicken, the buttermilk batter, and perfect frying do the work. Their drinks are a must too. I always start with their draft makgeolli. You can find this drink is some other Korean restaurants too, but Hanjan serves it in chilled beer mugs. They shake the bottle before pouring into the mugs, so you really get the bubbly beer experience. I crave Hanjan's makgeolli on a regular basis. Gulping down a mug of that makgeolli really makes everything perfect after the end of a stressful day.The cocktail menu changes frequently according to what's in season, etc. I can't offer a suggestion on what to drink now, but always ask what's seasonal or popular and whatever they recommend will probably be pretty good.",3,0,1,Kenny K.,"Manhattan, NY",18,22,5

4.0,2/4/2015,"when hanjan opened up a couple of blocks from me, it got a bang-up review in the times, the kind of review that makes you really want to check it out. when they talk about creative cookery, artful offbeat chefs, i'm in. when i was younger it was all about the eyes, when i got to be a teenager and 20s it was all about the ears, the sounds (y'know, music?). and now, who knows why, maybe i've seen it all, heard it all, whatever, now, it's all about the tastes, anything goes, startle me, titillate me, satisfy me, bathe me, confuse me, elevate me, that's what i'm looking for when i go out now.of course i printed out the review, fixed it in my mind, and promptly forgot all about it. many restaurants later, yesterday the owner posted something elsewhere about yelp, something about reservations, buyouts, reviews, traffic, and maybe not getting an entirely fair shake on the business end of things. it sounded plausible and so i figured, maybe i can pitch in, put up a review or something. one problem -- i hadn't been there yet. still with me? i know, you just want to know if it's the kind of place to take the hubby on the anniversary of being out of town and loving korean to show off your identity as a cool sophisticate just like the characters on your favorite tv show. did i lose you yet? i'm trying, i'm trying. well ok, here's the review.i figured i'd just try a few things, a light meal, save the big feast for another time when i'm with people. i'm not a big fan of solo dining. so, the bar.  two servers at the front of the house plus the bartender put me right at ease. thank god i didn't have to deal with williamsburg. my plan was to ask them to fix me up with a few things sight unseen, at their discretion. it's more fun that way. i was quizzed pretty smartly, then they put in an order, and i got a drink. i felt confident doing it this way because the staff seemed to genuinely love the food here. that's not the case in a lot of places. cocktail: korean poire, a gin base with a little st. germain, pear, lemon, cinnamon and a bunch of crushed ice. cold and lovely, sweet with a kick. did i want another? well, maybe. but i demurred. solo drinking is not my idea of a good time.dish 1: salmon sashimi. this was the best dish of the night by far. combined with a fantastic vinaigrette, some baby green sprouts, and ikura, those big salmon eggs that pop juice when you bite into them. swirl it up and get all the flavors and textures at once, a real winner. creative combo cookery at its best.dish 2: fried dumplings. inside, a perilla leaf. so what is a perilla leaf, anyway? crazy. it felt vegetarian but it had a pork/shrimp composite inside. it needed the dipping sauce, and eaten all together it was also a new mouth experience. nicely done.dish 3: pork belly skewers with lettuce wrap and a couple of other unidentifiable complementary things. this was good but not aces for me. just say pork belly and i start swimming up to heaven, dreaming of rich nasty fat flavors. these were leaner, a good meat but not for dreaming. that would have been it, but i wanted more so i remembered the times review started with a description of a scallion pancake that was not a scallion pancake at all. and so it was, or was not, or however you deal with a positive negative. i'm lost. but read on:dish 4: scallion pancake. right. there's not much pancake here, rather a mountain of scallions and squid, breaded. it was huge, almost a meal in itself, really best to divvy up with maybe 4 people. you'd want a taste, not a meal. it's kind of like upscale glorified bar food, greasy, heavy, delicious, and surprising, and not like anything you're likely to find anywhere else. if i'd had a couple more of those gins, this would have been the antidote. would have sucked those vapors right up. and that was it. a lovely time. a place that i hope can thrive. it deserves to.in sum, wonderful intelligent hospitality in an unpretentious atmosphere, some extraordinary tastes, creative combinations, ingredients of a higher caliber, good clean food, art not sledgehammers.but here's the thing, and maybe the crux of the issue for yelpers: while it may be real korean, it's not fast food, but rather, upscale. 32nd street is in everybody's heads (and hearts) for obvious reasons, one big one being lifestyle, and no knock on that. it's cheap, rowdy, perfect for drunken post fratboy/girl nights out, loud, big groups, stuff yourself, keep the night going, etc. if you want that, go there and peace be with you.hanjan is not that kind of place and deserves to be judged to a different standard, fine dining, where cooking aspires to something more gifted, special, new. portions are smaller, prices are higher (ranging around $10-15 a plate), and you'll probably spend in the neighborhood of $50 for the pleasure of a dinner there. is it worth it? of course it is.  you will most certainly have some significant pleasures. dining is theater, after all.",5,0,5,Brave G.,"New York, NY",181,243,62
5.0,2/3/2015,"For me, Korean food is all about the sincerity and tireless dedication put into the making of its flavors. I truly believe that the time and effort put into the making of this cuisine is proportionate to how rich and deep the taste of food turns out. I can't deny the fact that I do also enjoy the cheap, convenient (24-hour open), MSG filled Korean food served in K-town at times but sometimes, you really need food cooked with some more dignity and passion. This is why I value Chef Hooni's Hanjan so much. The moment you step into Hanjan, you can really grasp the depth of thought put into this place. While at K-town, its all about stuffing myself with anything spicy and ""Korean"" enough to ""survive"" amongst all the greasy and buttery food in the City, at Hanjan, I actually feel like ""living"". The ambience, the quality, let alone the taste of their food is priceless. Don't get me wrong. I don't want anyone to read this review and visit Hanjan expecting some revolutionary taste. Chef Hooni is a dedicated and passionate chef, NOT a magician who makes vegetable taste like meat. The food at Hanjan isn't ""OMFG I'VE NEVER TASTED SOMETHING LIKE THIS EVER IN MY LIFE!"" but rather it executes the flavors of the ingredients to their fullest served fresh with sincerity which is why Hanjan is incomparable to those on 32nd street.Yes. The portions are small and the price is a little pricey but one, can't have everything, and two, once you come to appreciate the dedication and the concept of the restaurant, how could anyone possibly leave unsatisfied?",0,0,0,Sooyoung C.,"Providence, RI",0,1,0
5.0,2/3/2015,"Ddukbokki - what a masterpiece.  Now if I were to rate a Michelin star to one group of food it would be Chef Hooni's interpretation.  I didn't care for rice cake in any form whether it was swimming in dduk mandoo guk or the super dense rice cake deserts you get at your kid's or somebody kid's 100 day birthday party (a Korean birthday tradition).  But Chef HK's version was delicate and savory with an intricate balance of the freshest red peppers and sweet sauce.  I loved the saffron toppings with it.  It really made it special.  Now why all the rave about this dish because #1 it changed my view of ddukbokki (the best of the world even such places as remote shigol Korea.) and #2 I don't mind ordering however many of this I can take.  Wonderful with their shisho flavored cocktails or a fine Pinot.  Pretty much all his dishes were excellent - the fried chicken, the pig trotters, grilled half mackerel, spicy pork belly skewers, kimchi stew, spicy octopus stir fry.  It's a bit pricey compared to the caveman portions you get on 32nd st.

5.0,2/3/2015,"Hanjan regular here... First of all, why are people so insensitive? This is why restaurants hate yelpers. None of the negative reviews here are constructive or helpful. Many people are complaining that the portion at Hanjan is too small for the price and they rather go eat at K-town (32nd st), but honestly comparison like that isn't apples to apples, not even apples to oranges. It's apples to orangutan! I see lots of harsh comments especially about their famous late night ramen here...- ""tasted exactly like Shin Ramyun""... ""overpriced instant ramyun you could buy for 2$ at a grocery store""... smh... are you seriously comparing the 12 hour broth of pork, chicken, and fish bones to the mystery instant ramyun powder mix??? Somebody also commented that he ""felt like something was missing (from the Hanjan ramyun)."" I'm afraid it was missing MSG, my friend. Not just ramyun but every single dish in Hanjan is carefully cooked with fresh and sensibly chosen ingredients, which inevitably raises the restaurant's price range. That's just the way it is. On top of that, Hanjan boasts its tasteful decor and attentive and professional service you wouldn't expect from such a humble and casual environment. Some people also commented that the food at Hanjan isn't as ""authentic"" as those in K-town. Do cheap price, large portion, and amount of MSG define authentic Korean food to you? I think Korean food is all about the flavor. Chef Hooni Kim uses five key ingredients artisanally made in Korea (""gochugaru"" red chili pepper powder, ""gochujang"" red pepper paste, ""duenjang"" soybean paste, ""ganjang"" soy sauce, and ""chamgireum"" sesame oil) to execute the traditional korean flavor as best as he can. As the dishes are served tapas style (or perhaps '' anjoo style, thanks to its 'joomak' concept) the food may be smaller than what we are used to from most Korean restaurants, but I honestly think the flavor at Hanjan is very authentic (and I am born and raised in Korea!). I even like the fact that the dishes are in small portion because that gives me more option to try different dish. Not only is it ideal for a foodie like me who prefers to taste many different things than be stuck with one ginormous portion, it is also a great way to introduce a variety of korean food to those who aren't familiar with the cuisine. Being a Korean myself, I do enjoy stuffing myself at K-town as much as I love eating quality Korean food at Hanjan. But they are valuable in their own terms and they simply cannot be compared back to back just because they both serve korean food. So please, before you write any more ignorant comments, think twice and do some research. recommended dish: dinner - scallion pancake with local squid, pork fat ddukbokki(my personal favorite!), spicy bbq pork belly, chicken skin skewerlunch - homemade tofu, sizzling hot bibimbap*Hanjan additionally offers Korean Chinese dinner menu every Monday, too (serving jjajangmyun, sweet and sour pork, fried dumplings, etc.)And last but not least, here's an article about David Chang's thoughts on Yelpers: fivethirtyeight.com/data…",11,1,9,Vero C.,"Manhattan, NY",4,4,11

4.0,12/15/2014,"KenScale: 8.0/10Hanjan is a modern Korean restaurant serving chef Hooni Kim's interpretation of Korean pub-style food paying homage to . Given my Korean background, I always have a bit higher standard for my mother country's cuisine. When I visited Hanjan during its early days, I liked the fresh ingredients but felt the seasoning was a bit too salty, probably catering to American audience that had been mobbing the restaurant since its opening. On my recent visit, however, my impression of the restaurant changed completely. Not only was the dining room subdued, but the flavor of the food also evolved to have more faithfulness to authentic Korean cuisine, which was a great pleasant surprise. I really loved a lot of dishes coming out from this kitchen, from the crispy perilla leaf dumplings with shrimp and pork, to short rib and pork belly skewers that were definitely above average with delicious and tender meat, to the beautifully cooked grilled half mackerel. I was somewhat underwhelmed by garlic fried chicken with pickles (with so many good fried chicken places opening these days, I think that was somewhat ineivtable), and spicy squid stir fry with organic somyun noodles was a bit too spicy to show the texture of the squid. On the other hand, I see the signature pork fat ""ddukbokki"" that I liked during my prior visits was even better than I had tasted before, with absolutely crisp rice cake that gave me delightful sensation. I expected a salty broth from the matsutake mushroom and brisket soup, but the broth turned out to be more or less perfect, with rich flavor without a ton of seasoning that would make it a great dish for cold winter nights. Kimchi and beef brisket fried rice with egg was another winner, a modern take on ""bokkeum bap"" (fried rice) with great balance of flavor and texture. Unfortunately, I came to dinner a bit too early and couldn't get a taste of the famed Korean spicy ramyun (whose broth is prepared for 12 hours and therefore the dish is available only after 9 p.m. every day). On my last visit, the broth was just overly sweet, but I would definitely love to see if this dish has evolved in the positive direction.On all my prior visits, the restaurant was absolutely packed and the didn't take reservations, so sometimes it would take up to 2 hours to wait for a table. This time, however, my dining companion was able to book a table at 6 p.m. the day before without much problem, and the chaotic dining area was definitely more subdued. The restaurant has a full bar, but I would stick with beer or traditional Korean/Japanese drinks like soju or sake. I've always liked the clean, modern vibe of this restaurant that wasn't too pretentious or divey. I'm glad to report that Hanjan is going on a right direction in showcasing how the Korean cuisine has and will evolve in the modern age. With a ton of terrible Korean restaurants in K-Town, I will gladly visit Hanjan instead whenever I have a huge craving for Korean food.",12,5,9,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

3.0,10/28/2014,"I was hearing mixed things about this restaurant and didn't know what to expect upon entering. The decor and ambience is really neat and hits the nail on the head as far as traditional modern Korean decor goes.The service was superb. Our waiter checked in every so often and was very thoughtful in his recommendations for drinks--something I find very important, especially when it's being paired with food.The food summed up in one word: fair. Every Korean restaurant serves kimchi and other small veggie side dishes prior to the meal for free. Hanjan charged for the kimchi and other small sides, and I couldn't really get over that. I know it's a modern / fusion restaurant that caters to a different audience, but I believe that the best parts about Korean cuisine culture--like endless sides to warm up and complement conversations--should be maintained. Now that I'm done ranting about having paid for it, the sides were good. Not the most fresh or crisp, but rich in flavor.The modern menu items scared me and didn't resonate Korean cuisine at all. I went with the spicy squid stir fry over noodles and it was quite possibly the spiciest thing I've ever eaten. So spicy that it was hard to enjoy it (and anything else on the table). I also ordered the scallion pancake with squid, and that was yummy and I recommend it. Very crunchy and crisp + loaded with veggies and squid, as it should.Overall, a decent restaurant choice if you're looking for something other than traditional Korean food. It's definitely different from anything I've ever tried, even other Korean fusion restaurants, but it's also not necessarily a bad choice.",0,0,0,Alison L.,"New York, NY",144,140,11

Perusing the menu, I quickly realized this was the sister restaurant to Danji, in Hell's Kitchen, a place I'd been meaning to try since it opened last year. It was lunch time and not so crowded (score!) so I grabbed a stool at the bar and ordered myself a beer. For my meal, I debated between the beef bulgogi and the pork fat ddukbokki. In the end I opted for the former and I was not disappointed. Never in my life have I had a bulgogi so sublime and absolutely perfect. It left me full but not too full.

There were too few noodles provided in the bowl. The broth was not very stunning either. It tasted decidedly korean, with a strong kimchi-like flavor that reminded me a lot of soondubu. Actually, I would have thought I was eating soondubu if it was a blind taste test. The spice was nice, but the fish flavor from the broth was a bit off-putting. Overall, it was not a strong bowl of ramen, and one would be advised to skip it in favor of other items on the menu.

5.0,6/25/2014,"Just had dinner at Hanjan last night. We sat down at our table and was greeted by our waiter within 3 minutes.  He was very knowledgeable and explained the menu in detail. He also discussed with us all the ordering options that made sense for a tasting style menu. The four of us each ordered 3 -4 items and passed them around the table so all can share. Before the food arrived we all tried there inventive cocktails that were refreshing and eclectic sounding without being over the top.  I'm sensitive to sugar so he made me a vodka with whipped egg whites and shiso. I was blown away.   Each course was more interesting and complex as they came out. Something as simple as chicken wings (freshly killed) was as simple and fresh as could be. The texture didn't even feel like chicken. What truly makes a good chef is being able to make food taste amazing with little or no adornments. This means that the food must be as fresh as possible not to mention exceptional  quality ingredients. More important then that is having a chef to understand how to put these ingredients together to make magic and magic we had!When tasting the pig trotters there was a point that I needed some texture and acid to balance the richness of the dish. Guess what.....The crunchy slaw on the bottom was the perfect counter point. Then a small bite of his Kim chee was the perfect acid component to round out the entire dish. A perfect balance of sweet, spicy, acid and balance. I'd be righting all night if I went into each dish. Everything was so amazing, its as simple as that. The broth on the Ramon bowl was sooooooooo rich with depth of flavor I didn't even need the noodles or other vegetables :)To finish the meal we had whole grain ice cream.

The dipping sauce for their fried chicken, oh man, I just want to douse everything I eat in that stuff from now on.A few caveats, though, and the reason why I probably won't be back here for a while: 1) it seems this place isn't very authentically Korean, so if you want something real, you're probably better off looking elsewhere, and 2) this place is PRICEY.

Yes, knowledge over ignorance here makes you more dissatisfied.The kimchi and beef brisket fried rice with an egg was way salty and I didn't even want to finish it but did since it was $20. Haha.

5.0,5/7/2014,"""Do you know much about ordering wine with food?"" my friends mother asked, as we fished the menus out of a slot in our low-lying tables. ""A bit,"" I said, but surely she knew that I had nothing on her six decades in the Francophile tradition of balancing flavors and palettes with taste. A division of labor was proposed - I'd order the food while she suggested the accompanying libation. I ordered generously from the selection of small plates, eventually settling on seven for our party of three. It was late, and wound up being the last to be served on this Thursday evening, but no one rushed any part of the meal. The courses trickled out from the kitchen, some hot and some cold. An almost deconstructed, vegetable heavy take on the scallion pancake was the most striking thing to emerge. Without the batter that makes this traditional appetizer rather filling, there was a chance for the freshness of the vegetables (and the seafood) to come through. I wish more restaurants would take this approach, even if they would not be able to match the execution on display here. Portions varied widely, from a few delicate pieces of sashimi to the large bowl of kimchi rice. All of it was excellent, perhaps even an improvement on the similar things on offer at Danji, the predecessor of this restaurant located in the Theater District. Here the execution is even more bold, the colors brighter, the flavors even stronger. My friend who now lives in Quebec, helping to manage the family business after several years abroad, mentioned between bites that Korean food is so rare up north that he had taken to making his own kimchi. He admitted, however, that the chunky, unshredded and very spicy version created by Hanjan more than met the standard that came out of his own kitchen. Nothing that emerged from the kitchen failed to be less than excellent - even the wine. As might imagine my friend's mother picked a fruity, rich red the matched the food perfectly. We must have seemed like people who enjoyed it, as we were offered the remainder of a bottle that had been served to a couple of earlier parties by the glass gratis as we wound down the meal.I learned a bit about wine, and we all learned quite a bit about Korean food.",0,0,0,Jon S.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,647,1

4.0,4/2/2014,"I've always naturally associated Korean food in NYC with KTown. However, my Korean friends have stated multiple times that I need to get out of KTown and check out Hanjan in the Flatiron. Thus, I took it upon myself to make my way over here for lunch. Now during lunch, Hanjan does have a condensed menu, so I can't really speak on what is served during dinner. Nonetheless, I did have a good lunch experience. When you first walk into Hanjan, you'll realize that this place isn't that large. There are assorted tables scattered along the sides and in the middle, there is a big communal booth in which you can seat a good 20 or so people. That being said, this place is of the more intimate setting and you definitely won't be finding the loud and obnoxious Koreatown crowd here. For lunch, you have the choice between 10 different entrees and 7 appetizers. Pretty minimal in a sense, but for lunch, it's quite alright with me. I decided to opt for the Sizzling Hot Bibimbap ($18). It comes loaded with: marinated vegetables, bugolgi beef, rice, and a fried egg all in a sizzling cast iron bowl. When my food came out, the presentation was spot on. This food looked much more appetizing than the stuff you get at KTown. What helped put this over the top was their homemade gochujang. It wasn't overly salty and had just the right amount of garlic and spice to give my bibimbap a nice kick. Portion-wise it's definitely enough food for a lunch. The bugolgi was cooked spot on and wasn't overly salty. Also, there was a good mix of marinated vegetables which complemented the gochujang well. Service-wise, Hanjan is pretty decent. During my lunch, it did take around 30 minutes for us to have our food served, which is a little long, but luckily there was a conversation going on. Otherwise, I'd be a little ticked off to say the least. All in all, Hanjan is a great escape from the hell that is also known as Koreatown. The Flatiron is laid back, and Hanjan provides a nice intimate atmosphere where you can wind down and enjoy a great meal.",3,2,3,Michael W.,"New York, NY",747,1029,240

3.0,3/5/2014,"It's possible that I've been spoiled by the plethora of restaurants along 32nd Street, but Korean food isn't the first thing that comes to mind when I think of upscale cuisine. I have yet to visit Danji, but when I heard about Chef Hooni Kim's latest endeavor which leaned towards a more casual, pub-ish feel, I was more than willing to give Hanjan a try.A group of us arrived at 9PM, which happened to be one of the first nights that the restaurant had begun accepting reservations. The interior is pretty utilitarian; there are a few two-tops lined against the walls of the restaurant and a larger communal table in the center of the dining room. We were seated at one end of the latter and handed menus to peruse. Similar to the offerings at Danji, the menu is fairly pared down and organized into four sections: Traditional, Modern, Skewers, and Sides. Our decisions were much easier to make since we had decided beforehand to try Hanjan's ""Korean Spicy Ramyun"", which is offered only after 9PM since the broth requires 12 hours to make.Our ramen arrived in short time in a slightly worn metallic pot (similar to the ones you'll find used in Korean dramas). Lining the top were a plethora of toppings: a soft-boiled egg, three slices of pork belly, scallions, and bean sprouts. The wavy noodles at the bottom peeked out from a rich, dark-red broth and the aroma of our dishes was enough to generate pangs of hunger, a subtle reminder that our dinner was long overdue. The broth, a concoction of pork, beef, and fish bones simmered for half a day, has extracted the richness of the marrow and blended with the chili paste, makes for a savory and spicy base. The toppings are all well done and although the ramen noodles were slightly overdone, they made for a good chew throughout the meal. (FYI: These noodles are the same ones found at Totto Ramen.)So why only three stars? A statement was made that evening, that most of us agreed with: ""This tastes exactly like Shin Ramyun."" True, there are some significant differences between the prepackaged version you can make at home versus the ramen that's served here. Is the difference worth $16 though? As much as I enjoyed my dinner here, that's not something I can fully agree with. I'm more than happy to scout out more authentic and reasonably priced Korean food along 32nd Street, but I give credit to Chef Kim for his efforts.",11,3,4,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

5.0,2/20/2014,"For those that have tried and failed to get a table at Danji, Hooni Kim's cerebral take on Korean fine dining in Hells Kitchen, there is now roughly three times as much seating if you take Hanjan into account.  Not that the menu at Hanjan is the same as Danji's - you won't find those addicting (but certainly not authentic) pork belly and bulgogi sliders at Hanjan.  Instead, you'll get a modern take on humble Korean mainstays such as ddeukbokki ($13) - at its core a pile of rice cakes swimming in a sweet and fiery sauce.  Here they are crisped for a welcome note of texture, and glossed with pork fat to add depth of flavor.  There's also a take on packet Shin ramyun ($16), a beloved pantry staple that they do right by re-creating the broth using kombu and all sorts of animal parts as well as using ramyun noodles by Sun Noodles, the same purveyor that supplies the powerhouse ramen-ya's in the city (Totto, Yuji, etc).The unifying theme of Hanjan and Danji is the use of French techniques and top-notch ingredients to elevate humble Korean flavors and textures.  Take for example, their take on haemul pajeon (seafood pancake - $16), which utilizes a tempura batter and is fried twice to achieve a pancake that is lighter and crispier than you could ever hope for.  Or the luxurious galbi jjim (braised short rib - $22), which is at first browned (a technique that Koreans frustratingly don't use enough) and braised low and slow, redolent of a boeuf bourguignon with a Korean accent.At times, Mr. Kim returns to his roots at Danji, offering a variation of his take on Korean paella - in this case the wonderfully opulent and stick-to-your ribs kimchi and beef brisket w fried egg dish ($20) served sizzlingly hot on a cast iron platter.  And at times, he swings for the fences with a decidedly French preparation of ribeye steak with maitake mushrooms ($48).  Such ambition is a given - after all he found his cooking chops under the tutelage of Daniel Boulud.If you've visited either restaurant, one gets the sense that they are attempting to push the boundaries of Korean food while keeping the traditional flavors (the homage to old-school Korean pop-culture in the bathrooms is a great example of keeping things real).  Far from a sophomore slump, Hanjan represents progression and maturity - not just for Korean food, but for Mr. Kim as well.",8,4,4,Chris H.,Hong Kong,170,603,2140

I don't recall the name of the dish, but it is a bowl of rice and veggies with your choice of pork, fried egg, or sashimi. I got the sashimi thinking it also came with egg. It did not. But I was not disappointed. The dish was simple and healthy, but it was the perfect example of simple, but good quality food. You could taste the freshness of the salmon as it melts in your mouth. You could tell the sticky rice was made fresh in house, and the sauce-was everything. Amazing! Will definitely be returning.

Hence, Hanjan...Immediately, I sat at the bar and was welcomed by an attentive bartender with roots to Tijuana (I know, a Korean place, but it's NYC and it works)... He made the night... It's hard in NYC to find new things before they become discovered and over exposed. Here, I unearthed an unfiltered Korean rice beer that was so unique and delicious in every regard, that I will need to research it and find it again... The bartender, had answers for all my honest intrigues towards the tradition, the serving techniques and alcohol content of the strange brew. From there he was a pleasure in introducing me to new stuff, and always had my water glass filled and was quick to let me sample house made Shochu, ginger syrup and cucumber juice... All delicious...The place filled up quickly and was packed by 7pm... The staff took it all in calm stride... Regarding the food, I only sampled the fried chicken which was very good, as were the sides of Daikon Radish and spicy pickles... If I had to nitpick, it would have to be with the music. For whatever reasons, Asian places seem out of tune with where they stand with music choices... And the 80's mix here felt silly...and clashed like paisley with neon pink stripes... When in doubt stick with classic stuff, Jazz or Blues, Swing...whatever... A white shirt and a black skinny tie always works...

The service is quick and efficient - we were seated at our reservation time and given the recently popularity of the restaurant, they require you to order in one go. The food comes out in order of dish size (or just sort of randomly, with heavier foods at the end).Recommended dishes:- Homemade tofu: it appears they put some sort of cream into this, as it's uncannily smooth and silky. Serves 1-2 people- Spicy cod roe stew: too spicy for my taste, but an interesting dish to try. It's not large, serves 3-4 people- pork fat ddukbokki: basically rice cake (savory, not sweet) cooked in pork fat and rolled around in seasoning. Better than most rice cakes but a very heavy dish. Serves 2-3 people- Perilla jeon with shrimp and pork: flat dumplings. With the sauce, quite good! 3 dumplings to one serving.- Chicken skin skewers: very interested, tasted like fried pork rinds. Serves 1-2- Fresh killed chicken wings: not memorable, probably not worth getting- Radish kimchi and brisket fried rice: Good but also not super memorable or different from other Korean restaurants; serves 2-3- Scallion pancake with local squid: very deep fried.

3.0,11/18/2013,"I really enjoyed my meal at Danji so when I heard that the chef was opening an upscale Korean pub called Hanjan, it was on my list to try.  The place is cute, it has some similarities to Danji in terms of communal tables and tucking the menus into the table and the separation of the menu into modern and traditional.  I thought the food was good and I enjoyed every dish.  I had the scallion pancake with local squid, kimchi and brisket fried rice, the salmon sashimi salad, the pork fat ddukbokki, and fried chicken with pickles.  I really wanted to try the ramyun but it's only available after 9pm (but can't they just start the broth earlier?).  The ddukbokki was my favorite but I think they should add the other half of the soft boiled egg onto that plate for sharing purposes.  I thought the scallion pancake was also very nice and voluminous (it was very large pieces of scallion presented more like a nest).  The salmon salad was good but I felt the salmon itself could have tasted a wee bit fresher.  The kimchi and brisket fried rice tasted pretty typical and same with the fried chicken.  The major wrinkle with the meal is the rushed service.  I understand that it's a small place and they are busy but the dishes came out fast and furious and we were basically told to clear out so they could bring in another reservation (and not that long after we were done eating).  The waitress offered free drinks at the bar if we moved which was nice but then they gave away the bar seats to other diners so it was just very awkward.",0,0,0,Lisa W.,"Hoboken, NJ",141,211,0
3.0,11/11/2013,"For those interested in new interpretaions of Korean cuisine, this place is worth the trip. Paying for high end Korean, never feels quite right, but Hanjan has a wonderful ambiance and well decorated space to make the experience an enjoyable one.In order to enjoy Hanjan, you need to be willing to stray from your comfort zone, to dine here and order a traditional dish, you will probably be dissapointed.The 'freshly killed' fried chicken is outstanding, best way to start the meal. The letuce wrap and skewers are decent but a little dissapointing. The brisket fried rice was another hit. The house Soju is tasty, nice way to complement the meal.Worth the trip, but considering the price, probably not for a return visit.For two, the bar is a nice option, almost more spacious than the dining area when at capacity.",0,0,0,Michael B.,"Telluride, CO",2,34,2

3.0,9/18/2013,"3.5 Stars.Well decorated, slightly upscale Korean fusion venue. I wouldn't call this place a restaurant - more of a ""sool jip"" or izakaya with small dishes (tapas-like) served to be shared. The venue is small, slightly felt crowded on a Wednesday night with ~80% capacity; can't imagine what it would be like on a weekend. Can't say much about the food since we only ordered two dishes- ddukbbokki and the seafood pancake. The ddukbbokki was excellent! The rice cake (dduk) was very soft and tender and the seasoning (pork fat/hot pepper sauce) was perfect. The seafood pancake was actually more like seafood/scallion fries as it did not resemble a pancake of any sort. As a Korean, I really would not recommend it.The prices of the above menu item were priced fairly ranging around 10-15 dollars. The drink prices, however, were not as fair, as a glass of makggeuli (unfiltered rice wine) was 9 dollars a piece! Overall, the venue and location was definitely a change of pace from the usual in Ktown, but considering the high price of EtOH and only decent taste, I probably would not come here on a regular basis.It is a great spot for a date, however, given its cozy atmosphere.",1,1,1,Ken P.,"Manhattan, NY",34,111,29

3.0,8/25/2013,"I was really excited to try Hanjan because I like trying places with new interpretations of Korean food. However, I was disappointed. The food was good, but not particularly memorable. Seating: The restaurant needs to do a better job on reservations. My party made a 8pm reservation, and when we arrived at 8pm, we were told that the party at our table before us had not left. We were asked to wait, and we did...until nearly 8:20pm. Restaurants should be able to schedule reservations taking into account parties that may linger longer than the usual two hours or so. Also, while I have had this experience before, other places were hospitable and offered us complimentary drinks from the bar. This did not happen here. Interior: The interior of this restaurant is really cute. It is urban and rustic with wood benches and industrial overhead lights. Food: The food is served tapas style one after the other.Scallion Pancake: This was an interesting take on the traditional Korean scallion pancake. It had less flour than the usual pancake, so that it was flaky and even a little crunchy. I actually thought it was very good. Kimchi Pork & Tofu: This is a very flavorful dish where kimchi is mixed with pork and there is tofu on the side. This dish  tends to be on the oily side, however, Hanjan did a great job of keeping the flavor while leaving a clean aftertaste. While it was good, I thought that it lacked the kick that left me feeling that something was missing. Fresh Killed Chicken Wings: The chicken wings were really good. The breading seemed to have some spices in it. It wasn't that oily either. Overall, if you want to try Korean food in a cute, rustic atmosphere, this place is the place to go. But, if you want really good Korean food in a nice setting, go to Jungsik in Tribeca or if you don't care about the setting, go to Koreatown.",0,0,0,Elizabeth J.,"Ithaca, NY",164,12,0

5.0,8/3/2013,"I've been to Hanjan twice so far, and I cannot wait to go back. I love this place. It's a great dining/drinking experience, especially for people who like to try a lot of different foods/liquors. First of all, I will say that previous posts complaining about the price are only half right. Yes, if you treat this as a tapas place and get six, seven dishes, you'll spend a lot. Yes, if you buy a lot of drinks, you'll spend a lot. But my girlfriend and I have both times enjoyed two hour+ meals by sharing three-five dishes and one bottle of soju between us. They aren't skimpy on the servings.Here's what I have had so far:1. Kimchi with pork and tofu: I came for the pork and stayed for the tofu. Easily a dish I will get again in the future. The tofu was like eating butter, delicious soy butter. The kimchi and pork were also good, but the tofu really stood out. We ordered it with a side of rice, which is only 2 dollars. Take advantage of that. It's quality rice.2. Fried chicken: ORDER IT. You won't be sorry. It's juicy dark meat chicken in crispy breading (the breading is actually seasoned, unlike Western-style breadings), and it comes with tasty pickled peppers and radish cubes. So good it's the only food I've ordered both times I've been here, despite my desire to go through the whole menu.3. Radish kimchee and brisket fried rice: Very good. Traditional comfort food. A large dish, it comes on a sizzling black iron plate with a large fried egg on top. The brisket could have been a little less shredded--it was hard to distinguish when you were actually eating brisket--and could have been a little moister (they might want to use fattier cuts), but the flavors were spot on. 4. Chicken skin skewer: I expected to like this more than I did. It's taste is extremely similar to chicharrón, but it lacks the layer of meat below the skin. Still, tasty. Just not something I'll go back for.5. BBQ Galbi Skewer: Excellent. Just straight-out perfectly marinated and cooked beef skewers. Delicious marinade, and it comes with lettuce leaves to wrap it in. I could easily eat this and the pork belly skewer until I die.6. Pork belly skewer: ORDER IT. The beef skewer is more technically perfect in its execution, but the pork belly skewer has a perfect spicy kick to it and leaves you wanting 500 more. Also comes with lettuce leaves for wrapping. A tad salty, but I love salt, so I was OK with it.7. Soju: My girlfriend and I have shared a bottle of the raspberry-infused and herbal-infused soju at our two meals. Both are tasty as heck (coming from someone who has never had soju before). The raspberry is sweeter than the herbal, but the herbal has a unique almost peanutty flavor. Overall I prefer the raspberry but would happily drink both again. A lot better deal than getting cocktails or sake.The place fills up as the night goes on. We've made reservations earlier in the night both times. Recommended. But we've never found the place too noisy or crowded to have conversations.Overall, excellent.",3,2,2,Jean-Luc B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,15,0

4.0,6/30/2013,"I am a lucky, lucky girl and the friend who brought me here is a personal friend of the chef; so here comes the slew of complementary dishes and drinks! Unfortunately, I just barely gave Hanjan a 4 star rating, because the price is just far too high when considering what you are actually eating (only applies to certain dishes). Since when does kimchee (plain kimchee... not some sort of haute, innovative, or fusion kimchee delivered by a Shilla Empress herself) cost that much?! seriously!??!Don't get me wrong, the food was excellent. The tastes were very flavorful and good. I loved every single dish. More so, I love the small dishes because they encourage sharing bite sized punches of flavor.There were some really great and innovative touches that really put a smile on my face. The biggest stand out is the makgeolli served up in a ice-chilled beer stein. When I was in Korea, that was actually my FAVORITE drink and at that time as a 20-something, everyone teased me for loving an 'old farmer/gramps' drink. But serving it up in this new way really gives it a different approach and feel. Another thing I loved.... and i do admit to being a fatass.... is the chicken skin skewers. Yes... its skewers that have only delicious, fatty, succulent and perfect chicken skin on it. No meat. No bone.

2.0,6/27/2013,"I really went in wanting to like this place, but I left feeling totally unimpressed and even a little hungry.The decor and atmosphere are spare and pleasant. It's much nicer than you would find in an actual pub in Korea. We sat at one end of the long communal table. It was cramped and our legs kept bumping into each other. I had the Old Fashioned made with Korean citrus and it was great - strong and full of flavor.The food was really disappointing. It's Korean-style small plates but you would need to order a ton to ever really feel sated. Our party of five (including four women) ordered practically everything on the menu and I never felt close to full.The perilla pancakes (jeon) were so bastardized as to not be worthy of being called Korean. The kimchi and namul (which is always free in a Korean place) was incredibly stingy and unremarkable. Skip it and use the $6 to buy some prepackaged stuff in K-town. It will taste better. We also had the chicken done a few different ways, the ddukboki, the fried rice and some other stuff.Bottom line: I have no idea what the hype is about. If you have even a passing familiarity with Korean food, then you will be disappointed. It's to Korean what Sbarro is to Italian. But if you want a quasi-Korean hipster experience, go here by all means.

My favorite dish of the night was dukboki and ate every bite of it. Perilla jun was standard. We also got the radish/brisket fried rice and this was very salty. Friend and I were very impressed with the perfectly cooked fried egg though and we mentioned it to each other like 3 times. LOL. Also ordered the kalbi, pork & scallion skewers and the kalbi was too salty/sweet and we didn't finish any of these. Out of these three, the veggie skewer was my favorite. We drank lots of sake, the first was described as dry on the menu but was not dry at all but the second bottle they recommended was great so it made up for it.

4.0,6/9/2013,"A casual, although a bit trendy place for Korean food ? I like the limited menu, and the fact that everything was fresh, from the vegetables to the meat and chicken. We had Scallion pancake with squid which was a good portion for two, and lightly fried. The Kimchi Pork & Tofu which was basically like a Jigae without the broth, so if you are a fan of the jigaes then this will be a favorite. The Radish Kimchi & Brisket fried rice was a highlight as it tasted like the best comfort food without the heavy greasy oils and the flavoring was well-balanced in that one particular flavor/ingredient did not overwhelm the others. The Fresh killed Chicken Wings were good, but I was expecting it to be fried and with toasted sesame oil, but it was grilled and still fresh but I would have to pass on these next time as there wasn't anything particularly unique about them. We also had the side order of Kimchi Duo which also came with pickled radishes. I don't know if they make their own kimchi but I suspect that they do, and it was fresh and tasty without being overly fermented. The Kalbi was also another highlight and it came with mini pieces of lettuce and fresh ssamjang to make your own little wrap. The Fresh killed chicken skin was delicious, and again, lightly fried with a side of ssamjang and soy dipping sauce.

4.0,4/27/2013,"This is some really tasty overpriced hipster Korean food.Hanjan feels almost exactly like Danji, it's predecessor, which is a good thing. It's a cool, laid-back atmosphere, which is even cooler if you are lucky enough to score a table and not get stuck at the long communal table in the middle. Instead of the straight up hipster set you get stuck sitting with and listening to when you want some good food these days though, this place is more overrun with Chelsea boys given its proximity to that neighborhood.But I digress - the food here is really good, but as many are complaining about, a little pricy. The waiter recommended that two people normally order 6-7 dishes here. When I hear a recommendation like this, I automatically think that means 8-9 dishes for me, but I started to add up the bill and I realized I should just fill up on some dessert somewhere else after.The best two dishes were easily the Pork Fat Ddukbokki ($12) and the Radish Kimchi & Brisket Fried Rice ($18). The Ddukbokki were so perfectly chewy and the pork fat and whatever other sauce that was they were in were insanely addictive. Even if you get the fried rice, I also recommend getting a $2 side of white rice to go with the Ddukbokki. The side of rice was really good and also happened to be one of the few reasonably priced items on the menu.The Fried Rice is the real must order though - it comes with a beautiful fried egg on top and is loaded with plenty of delicious brisket. It is also served on a stone plate, so it remains piping hot throughout.The other dish I really enjoyed was the Fried Chicken ($12). This consisted of 5 or 6 pieces of boneless dark meat that were all very juicy on the inside and nice and crispy on the outside.We also got the Kimchi Pork & Tofu ($16) which was pretty good, though some of the pork was a little too fatty for me, and the BBQ Kalbi Skewers ($10), which were awesome, though a little silly at $5 per skewer.My one regret was the Spicy Cod Roe Stew ($24). It's not that it was bad or anything - it tasted decent - but I didn't realize it was the most expensive thing by far and was also the weakest dish. It was mostly just very spicy soup. Also, my only real complaint was that it took ages for our food to come out toward the end of the meal. We smartly arrived very early (around 6, shortly after they opened), and some of the first few dishes came out nice and quickly. But by around 7, the place was completely packed, and it started to take forever to get anything.By the end of the meal, I was absolutely sweating from all of the spiciness. At that point, it was fun and refreshing to see the owner come out in his sweats (I recognized him from the Time Out Food & Drink Awards, at which he just won an award for this restaurant) to turn on the air conditioner.I think I prefer the larger dishes at his first restaurant, Danji, but the food here is pretty good.

4.0,4/22/2013,"Good food, high prices, poor serviceWe tried Hanjan with some friends last week and though we enjoyed the food, the service was a bit of a turn off. We made the mistake of not taking a free table immediately when we arrived and got drinks across the street. When we were ready, they already had a 1.5 hour wait. We gave our cell number and tried a few more area bars. We got a call later that the table was ready, so we downed our drinks and ran back. Unfortunately, the table was still occupied because the tapas style menu meant the patrons had decided to go for a few more rounds. After a visit to yet one more bar, we returned.We tried the ginger drink and the Korean spice cocktails which were both good. The spice drink was particularly great though my wife didn't get to completely enjoy it as it was taken before she had finished. When she told the waiter, rather than apologizing, he told her she was in fact done. Not awesome. We also tried the sojus, regular and raspberry, after finishing the cocktails, and while good, I think the one time was enough. We didn't originally realize that it was tapas style (mostly because the dishes were all main course priced) and at the waiter's suggestion, ended up ordering about 10. I got the feeling he was up-selling us a bit hard as he kept pushing for more of his ""recommendations"", basically whatever was left that we hadn't ordered. Everything was good, but the standouts were the spicy squid, fried chicken (think upscale KFC), and sashimi. The pork belly skewers, chicken skin (not as weird as it sounds), pork trotters (also way better and less weird than they sound) were all incredible. The fried rice (highly suggested) was a disappointment. It was pretty greasy and didn't have much substance. We also tried the ramen, which was good (mostly because it was nice and spicy like I enjoy), but definitely not up to the story out waiter told us about the 12 hour process it goes through. I'm also not a raman expert, but the noodles seemed to be out of a box to me. The broth was worth it though.As mentioned, the service was downright poor. We hardly saw our waiter after ordering except when ordering the ramen. We also didn't get explanations of what many of the dishes were as they arrived or much help with the menu.The food that was good was outstanding. If you are looking just for great food and don't care about service (fairly common in the area), it's definitely worth a visit. I'd probably still even go back just for the trotters.

2.0,4/19/2013,"I get really excited whenever a new modern Korean restaurant opens. I've been wanting to try Hanjan for a while. I found it disappointing.I'm Korean-American, of course :) (like more than half the patrons who were in there). Like the rest of you K-A's out there, I grew up eating this food. I was really excited that Hooni Kim was trying to do something new and fun, a Korean gastropub. The quality of a lot of the food is high as far as -- this is not old, cheap food. It's fresh and high-quality. The issues are that:1) the portions are way too tiny to merit the prices, even in this area; and2) he's not really doing much that's exciting or new or even interesting.The meh:Skewers. These were meh and boring, both the pork and the beef. They didn't even come to the table sizzling hot. Not spicy, or succulent, or interesting. TEENSY portions for price. Literally just a couple tiny short skewers per $10 plate. The best part about Korean bbq is how hot, fresh and tenderly marinated it is. These were tender enough, but not interesting enough or hot enough.Fried rice with egg, brisket and radish kimchi: Extremely meh. Greasy heap of fried rice topped with well-cooked sunny-side up egg, with brisket just tossed indiscriminately on the side and three measly pieces of radish kimchi. Good sized portion of rice. Presentation: D.Ddukbokki: sauce was good but I'd aim for consistency in the sauce and try cutting smaller or frying the ddukbokki like David Chang did when he served it at Momofuku. Not frying or cutting small is traditional, but that's so boring. You're trying to be new here. Or you could make it spicier or try different spices than the traditional -- don't wimp out on us here.Also, how about some anju, cuttlefish or other salty snacks to start? Maybe a beer cocktail, spicy kimchi michelada or clamato?The good:Haemul pajun was taller and fluffier than the traditional, but is very cheap to make bigger. Why not? You don't need to add that much more seafood, just make it eatable and not a tiny snack. Even as an appetizer in Korean food, it's usually bigger than this.Tongdak chicken was tasty and well-cooked, a decent-sized portion. If you're going to go, eat this. Or you could go to any KFC joint in town and get three times the amount for the same price (though it'd probably be crispier/fast foodier/greasier).Side of kimchi was yummy. I give you props there. I've been working on perfecting my kimchi recipe for ages -- it ain't easy. Yours was delicious.My thoughts: Until Hanjan improves, go to Doksuni in the East Village for delicious, hearty helpings of modern Korean food. Go to Purple Yam in Ditmas Park for excellent ""new Korean"" food.

Design of the room is time-out-awards-baiting: edison light bulbs, distressed wood and closely packed tables.   The fried chicken dish was fantastic.  Most of the other dishes were v good.  The squid and noodle was little different from what you could have in nearby KTown, and the portion there would be 6x bigger at the same price.Hankan is better suited to waif like models than scumbags who'd already been pocha-32'd :)",1,0,0,Adam G.,"New York, NY",28,452,180

I've already been to Danji so I knew the drill. Don't order anything you would normally order at a Korean restaurant or else you are sure to be disappointed. No kimchee - really this is just kimchee, the kind you get for free in k-town in unlimited quantities. No pajeon - this will be super tiny and most likely pale in comparison to miss Korea or wonjo or pocha 32. No tea - I forgot my rule and didn't realize they were charging by the small cup for the exact same barley tea that is always free in k-town also in unlimited quantities.

Everything was fantastic but the ddukbokki was by far the star. Also the bartenders were very attentive the whole time. Overall a very enjoyable experience.

At first glance it looks like a run of the mill trendy asian restaurant, but when you try their food you realize its unique. Hanjan offers an interesting combination of traditional and modern Korean dishes (some faves - the killed chicken wings and either of the pork belly or galbi skewers). Amazing cocktails (think the gin/cucumber cocktail). You may have to wait a bit if you walk in on a Saturday (30-45 mins), but sitting at the bar to eat is just as enjoyable probably as sitting down at one of the tables.

4.0,3/28/2013,"3.5 stars rounded up. Not surprised that Yelpers have given Hanjan less than rave reviews-- you really don't go here for the value.  Yes, it's Korean tapas (so small portions), yes it's stuff you...sorta find elsewhere for cheaper (with an inventive twist), but hey, the food is tasty (good quality).  The service.. good ish. Our waiter had good recommendations and paced the meal well (well, it was actually a little TOO slow) but they could have been better about refilling the waters. Of course, considering Adam Platt just wrote about this place, the lines are absurb.  Luckily at 6:30 on a Wed, my friend and I had to wait just 45 min.. but some folks had to wait almost 2 hours.  The bar (and space in general) are pretty tight, so don't come with a large company.  My gf and I didn't try the alcohol but we had the traditional corn tea which was flavorful. For Food, each item comes out when it's ready and it's to be shared. Portions are really on the smaller side (except for the fried rice), our waiter said 6-7 dishes to feed 2.  i think we had a bit more.  We had:Chicken Breast Skewer- no marinade but very tender breast, so plump and juicy meat. Chicken heart skewer- not into this, so I didn't try it but my friend said (who likes livers and such) it was just meh.. mushy and flavorless.. hmm, yuck. Kalbi beef skewers- two BBQ style marinated beef slices, very tender, and flavorful according to my friend Skewers come along with crispy, small lettuce wraps, and garlic paste (with roasted garlic, yum and scallion). We then had the atlantic salon salad, which was a hijiki/seaweed/lettuce combo doused in the traditional Korean red sauce (very spicy). Alongside fresh salmon sashimi- very good and sliced thin..not gummy at a all. We then had the fried chicken; this was good.  It was not too oily and made of tender dark meat.  Fried chicken is always good, but there was no particular flavor that stood out (the skin is drier with this fry).  Comes with daikon.  Barn Joo down the street does the same king of wring and I think it's better. We had the bibibap rice (which normally is sprinkled on top with of beef..we were able to get them to take away the beef part.  Otherwise, it was good- traditional with the veggies and egg.  One thing is that for how oily it was, I was there was more crispy rice;. We had the stir fry squid also, which was pretty spicy.  Small barely there square, but very interesting clean noodles that were sort of like buckwheat (but more unique- not as mushy)We had the grilled mackerel which is one of favorite Korean/Japanese mainstays- this was definitely not too oily and more buttery (as Adam P suggests :). This was probably my favorite dish. We were too stuffed for desert; they only had two options anyway - either sorbets, or a sweet rice pudding ice cream.  All in all, not made I waited or overpaid (come to $50 pp) but not regretting the experience.. whether I'd Wait AGAIN to come, I don't know.

I find it more efficient that the menus are underneath the table.Started off with the scallion pancake with local squid. I wonder what local refers to...hopefully not around the five boroughs, cause seriously, have you seen the our surrounding waters? Blech! Nonetheless, the pancake was good, smaller but crispier and less doughy than what you get in ktown. Also had the salmon sashimi. Good, but felt the greens were a weird accompaniment. The duo of root and leaf vegetables was very uninspiring. The pork fat rice cake was way too sweet for my palette. The galbi and the chicken thigh skewers were good, but a bit small and not that special.In general, I felt a lot of the dishes had a sweet undertone that you can distinctly tell.Cute area, lot of bar seating, and good service.

The place is small and did fill up soon after. The atmosphere is very similar to Danji, clean sleek look with a few seats at the bar. Our waiter was attentive and we started with some cocktails. I'll give them 5 stars on that. We tried the Bold Ginger: bourbon, young ginger, maple syrup and grapefruit and the Basil Gimlet. Both drinks were great. I don't like sweet and the waiter told me that the bold ginger was not sweet even though it had maple syrup in it and he was right. The grapefruit and the ginger cancel it out. Most of the plates are small and meant to share so we ordered a few that sounded good. At our waiters suggestion, we ordered more which proved to be too much for us. Here's what we had.1. Spicy Octopus stir fry: fabulous, a must2. Fried shiso leaves: greasy and feel free to skip3. Radish kimchi and brisket fried rice: this was served to us last and unfortunately we were already full because this was easily one of the best dishes.4. fresh killed chicken wings: sounded good, rather tasteless, skip5. BBQ Galbi Skewers: these were great, would order them againWe ordered a bottle of the Garnacha Blanca/Viognier, 'Coma Alta'Mas d'en Gil, 2008 . This was an below average bottle.

We live two blocks away so we just went home and came back when they called. When we got back (around 9  pm), we were seated immediately. The ambiance is cool and hip (a lot like Danji but darker). Like Danji, the place is small! We ordered the scallion pancakes, the spicy pork belly skewers, and the royal trumpet mushroom & scallion skewers to start. They were all delicious. Next, we got the Gwangju market fried chicken and the radish kimchi and brisket fried rice. Both were good but the chicken was definitely better - it was fried to perfection. For drinks we ordered the Korean Spice (like a spicy margarita) and some other cocktail with basil. Both were good.BOTTOM LINE: Be prepared to wait if you don't make a reservation (apparently you have to make one before 6 pm), order the scallion pancakes and the fried chicken, and go to Danji if you live closer to Hells Kitchen because it is definitely the better of the two restaurants.",0,0,0,Shuchi K.,"Boston, MA",31,80,1

3.0,2/16/2013,"I'm a huge fan of Danji so I was really excited that Chef Hooni Kim opened another restaurant. Some of the dishes at Hanjan were very strong but others could use some work. Food (ranked by most favorite to least)Scallion Pancake w Squid - this was everyone's favorite dish. It was actually more squid and scallions than the actual pancake. There was jut a thin net of light, perfectly crispy batter barely holding the squid and scallions together. Delicious! Spicy Korean Ramen - the ramen was quite solid and I liked that it was different from Japanese Ramen at places like Ippudo. The pork in the ramen was AMAZING--so fatty and delicious. Better than the pork at any other ramen place. The noodles were also a great texture. The broth was good. Apparently it takes 12 hours to prepare but it didn't necessarily reflect all of the effort that goes into it. (This dish is only available after 10pm since it takes so long to make the broth).Galbi Skewers - this was tasty and I liked how Chef Kim was able to elevate Korean BBQ to something that's much more delicate and modern. The presentation was beautiful. The sauce was perfect and I really liked the lightness and texture of the lettuce. The flavor and meat quality was comparable with Don's Bogam but I appreciated the small details that brought it one level above anything in Ktown.  Squid and noodles - The noodles were beautifully done - very light and a fantastic texture. Unfortunately there was too little noodle and too much sauce. It just overpowered the whole dish. Actually, the Kimchi pork, the squid noodles, and the pork fat all had the same overwhelmingly sweet sauce so I would recommend not ordering these together. Kimchi Pork and Tofu - I wasn't crazy about this dish and was particularly disappointed by the texture of the tofu. It has a strange chalkiness to it and wasn't smooth and soft like I was hoping for. The kimchi and pork were ok but the sauce was, once again, too overpowering and sweet. Pork Fat 'Ddukbokki'- spicy rice cakes. None of us really liked this dish. It was wayyyy to sweet and the spice wasn't very spicy but overly concentrated. The visual was quite beautiful with tiny little red strings dancing on top of tubular rice cakes covered with chili sauce but the taste was disappointing. I was expecting actual pork fat. DrinksBold Ginger - if you're a bourbon fan, you'll love this cocktail. It's packed with flavor and has a great ginger/cinnamon kick. Makgeolli - unfiltered Korean farmer beer. I've never tried unfiltered beer before but it was very interesting! it's quite sweet and the beer is a cloudy white color. It actually reminds me of unfiltered sake. If you're adventurous and want to try something funky, give this a shot. Korean Spice - essentially a spicy margarita.",1,0,1,Susan Z.,"New York, NY",74,115,127

I've never been to older-sister restaurant Danji before, so I can't compare on reviews that state it's superior. But on Friday night a friend and I went and overall had a pleasant experience. My friend was Korean and I let her do the ordering. We started with the BBQ Galbi Skewers which were juicy and delicious. Then went for the Gwangju Market Fried Chicken which our waitress informed us was the most popular item on the menu. It's easy to see why! The dark meat chicken was fried to perfection, not greasy at all, but crunchy and flavorful. It's served with spicy peppers that give it an extra kick. We ended with the Spicy Octopus Stir Fry - if you like octopus and you like spicy (as I do) this dish is a treat. Tender and generously portioned octopus served over rice noodles was the perfect cap. We left full - but not stuffed. The one issue is that although the drinks were good, they're very expensive. We both had two drinks a piece and it accounted for over 60% of the bill.

With too little creativity and too many shortcuts, Hanjan has it's work cut out for them. I went to Hanjan last night and was awestruck by the atmosphere. Larger than Danji's, this Chelsea location encompasses antique inspired lighting, chopstick holder made from rocks, and the greatest long table in any NYC farm to table establishment. The architects and designers of this space should be proud! The food on the other hand, leaves something to be desired.The BBQ Galbi Skewers were tasty and straight forward, the flavors were nice but I kept waiting for that little unforeseen twist which never came. Too simple but with a little more work this could be a solid dish.I love the Scallion Pancake w. Local Squid, this modern take on a street food classic embodied the entire atmosphere of Hanjan, I would go back solely to enjoy this rustic version of a scallion pancake. This crispy pancake dipped into that spicy and acidic sauce parallels the phenomenon of eating tempura, it was unexpected and hands down the star of the meal!The Pork Fat 'Ddukbokki, Kimchi Pork & Tofu, and Noodles w. Spicy Squid were all the same dish! All had way too much of that outrageously sweet grocery store ""Korean"" sweet and spicy sauce. These three dishes were reminiscent of cheap Americanized Korean food. While I liked the texture of the noodles, I did not enjoy the tofu (it should have been softer), both from the same supplier in Queens, not made in house.The Korean Spicy Ramyun was a good dish. The impeccably cooked pork which topped the noodle soup was absolutely the best bite of the night! The noodles were good and broth was fine but needed more depth, for a dish that took 10 hours to stew, I didn't like the harshness given by the spice, maybe making this an 11 hour dish will mellow out the flavors?Still awaiting the wow factor..",1,0,2,Karen H.,"Manhattan, NY",34,15,6
2.0,2/14/2013,"Meh~ this is Korean food sugar-coated for Americans who love sweet and not-so-spicy version of Korean food in a trendy setting in an area so boring and nothing but wholesalers and importers and office buildings. Maybe I'm being sarcastic but I'm not sure if  Chef Hooni know what type of food a Korean Tavern or Joomak serves or he's wayy too Americanized to understand. Ambience/Decor: 4.5 out of 5. Definitely one of the if not the only trendy restaurant in this area. It's not big but very cozy, inviting, and warm. Definitely a good place for a drink.Food: As a Korean, I am very serious about how Korean food is interpreted by chefs and cooks around the world. Sure, fusion Korean was always there but I thought food tasted average and nothing WOWed me at any costs. Plus, portions were probably one of the stingiest and tiniest I've seen for a Korean restaurant even though it's tapa-style. For that price, I could've gone to Koreatown and ate till my belly exploded or have gone to a real Spanish tapas place. Minus 2.5 stars right there for average taste and portion. And $5 for a tiny side of Kimchi? Does your Kimchi contain crack or is it organic and shipped overnight express from Korea or something?? NO THANKS, I can get a small jar of Kimchi that can feed me up to three days for less than $8. Service: VERY Attentive mostly non-Korean staff who made sure we had everything and water was refilled constantly. However, some servers were very pushy to sell drinks like cocktails or wine which we didn't want to get and were fine with water. However, in the end, we decided to get Makkeoli or Korean Rice Wine (they wrote it as Unfermented Beer in their menu though) which was actually served in a chilled glass mug and not from the actual bottle Sure the chilled mug and Makkeoli itself was good but $9 per mug, seems pretty pretentious since a bottle of Makkeoli is less than $20 and can be shared with up to 4 people) There were 4 of us so $36 just for Makkeoli which is ridiculous BE WARE: This is NOT a Korean restaurant to take a group of hungry people. More like an after work drinks and a good place to take a date. You will leave here still hungry with a hole in your wallet. We paid $148 for two skewers of Galbi (a bit too sweet but small and the meat was very thin), Rice Cake Tteokbokki, Perilla Leave Jeon, Seafood Jeon, Gwangju Market Chicken, and Kimchi Fried Rice. Sounds like A LOT of food right??? Unfortunately, portion for each dish was probably for a 5 year old. At that price, could've gone to the still pretty new 39th Floor Gaonnuri Korean Restaurant on 32nd Street insteadLast but not least, I don't want to hear anyone who works or owns this place complain about my review because I took lots of pictures of the food and place and uploaded them onto Yelp which is sort of like Free advertising.

4.0,2/2/2013,"As others have mentioned already, going to a Korean restaurant that charges for kimchee seems borderline blasphemous. (I'd imagine that's the rough equivalent of being charged for crispy wonton noodles at a Chinese restaurant.) So I had some preconceived notions going into Hanjan, but given it's downstairs from our apartment, we felt like we had to at least give it a try. I left pleasantly surprised.My wife started with the Asian Pear cocktail and I started with the Korean Old Fashioned. She was happy with her drink; mine tasted somewhat watered down but decent. I was actually a bit surprised at the somewhat limited drink menu at a Korean ""izakaya"" joint. We tried the house soju as well, which was not bad, but again not really something that I would have to get again. I wish I had read reviews ahead of time, because apparently I'm missing out on the Makgeolli (unfiltered rice beer). That's definitely getting ordered next time.The food here is what's going to bring me back again.Scallion Pancake w Local Squid - This isn't your typical Korean pancake. It was more like scallions and squid held together by a little bit of batter. I actually liked this better that the Korean pancakes I normally get, as it was lighter and less oily, but still crispy with the emphasis on the scallions and squid instead of the pancake.Spicy Cod Roe Stew - Tasty but a bit more like a soup than a stew. I think this really needed some rice to go with it, because we basically ended up eating this like a shared bowl of soup. I'm a huge fan of cod roe, so this was right up my alley.Radish Kimchi & Brisket Fried Rice - We ordered this right after we got our Spicy Cod Roe Stew hoping to combine the two. The timing didn't work out, but I was happy with this dish on its own. The rice could have been cooked maybe a bit longer to get some crispy edges, but that's more a personal preference than a failing of the dish.Gwangju Market Fried Chicken - We were expecting something like Korean Fried Chicken (e.g., Bon Chon), but this was more like Japanese-style fried chicken. Far be it from me to complain about any sort of fried chicken though. BBQ Galbi Skewers - $10 for two skewers of short ribs is definitely on the pricey side, but these were again excellent. Great flavors and cooked perfectly. I don't know if I'd order it again, just because they're grossly overpriced, but go for it if you're ballin'.Fresh Killed Chicken Skin - Mmmmmm ... chicken skin.The total bill for our dinner came to $132 before tip. $44 of that was alcohol, so the value wasn't quite as bad as I was expecting, as we got 6 dishes and left pleasantly full.",2,0,0,Eric T.,"New York, NY",92,143,26

4.0,1/16/2013,"Hanjan is the newly opened Korean tapas joint brought to you by the crew behind Michelin starred Danji. If you've never been to Danji, good. On the other hand, if Danji was your first experience trying Korean food, just remember that only a Korean restaurant that's catered towards ""white folks"" will charge you for a ""Trio of Kimchi""-if any restaurant tried to do that in Korea, they'd get feces thrown in their faces. The only ridiculously comparable analogy I can think of is a diner charging you for ketchup. So admittedly, I wasn't too keen on giving Hanjan a shot. I expected overpriced bar fare that's too sweet, packaged in an above-average interior that tried to justify the steep prices. However, the bar name, which means ""one drink"" in Korean, was too good to pass up for us drunkards at ODA and we've decided that it should be our first review in 2013.Glancing over the menu, our instincts told us to skip the rather one dimensional sounding cocktails at Hanjan. Prospective Asian restaurants of New York, if you're reading this, take note from Neta in the West Village and use some of the funds you've allocated on the architect/contractor to hire a real bartender to create your drink menu. We opted for makgeolli and a bottle of soju to pair with our dinner. Makgeolli, which is served in a frosty pint glass like a beer at Hanjan, should appropriately be classified as rice wine, or nigori sake for those familiar with Japanese alcoholic beverages. The debate over how it should be classified is nicely summarized here.As for food, we ordered the Pork Fat Ddukbokki ($12), Gwangju Market Fried Chicken ($12) and the Braised Pig Trotters with Fermented Shrimp Paste ($20). In short, let me just say that I may be finally coming around on localized ethnic/fusion foods. For the longest time, I've been a hater (a very passionate one to say the least) of fusion/localized ethnic foods. Why? Because in most cases, rather than trying to accent the essence of the flavors from the authentic incarnations of the dishes, the chefs hamper them with bullshit substitutes for the original spices and bastardize the dishes completely. Think tikka masala that tastes more Italian than Indian, or tajines that taste like a f*cking paella. Fortunately, Hanjan did it right and the dishes were pretty amazing. The Ddukbokki, though it was red as hell, wasn't too spicy and no hints of foreign flavors were detected. The Braised Pig Trotters with Fermented Shrimp Paste (which by the way is just a fancy term for pig's feet) were juicy enough to tempt even your most faithful Jewish friends. As for the Fried Chicken, though it came out of the kitchen wayyyy too hot and anyone that doesn't have shit for brains could foresee a lawsuit, the dish owned any other KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) available in Manhattan.Korean food is hardly a delicacy these days in New York City. From David Chang's establishments in the East Village to the latest Michelin-starred Jungsik in Tribeca, it's hard to get your head around what ""Korean flavor"" really is . For some, it may be just DIY barbecue or bibimbap, but for those seriously interested in what Korean cuisine has to offer, I recommend Hanjan.One Drink Ahead",5,3,2,Douglas P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0
4.0,1/14/2013,"If you've been to Danji before, then the type of food here will be very familiar to you.  Same chef / owner, but I was drawn to Hanjan because of the ramen they have been touting (only available after 10pm because the broth takes most of the day to prepare).I thought the ramen was good and different from the other NYC options in that it was prepared Korean style - very spicy and served in a traditional Korean ramen tin / metal bowl.  Though you may be reminded of it, this is not your typical Shin ramen - the broth is thick and flavorful and the ramen noodles are cooked perfectly al dente.  It is also $16 dollars.  The ramen noodles are from Ramen Totto, but in my opinion, prepared even better than the noodles at Totto.  Overall, though, I still prefer the ramen at Ramen Totto -- I thought the broth here to be too spicy -- I couldn't taste most of the flavors in a broth that took 12 hours to make.The highlight dish of the night for me was Salmon Sashimi Salad.  This dish was perfect.  The sashimi is fresh, delicately sliced, and seasoned with a few sprinkles of rock salt to bring out the flavor.  The salad comes on the side and is seasoned with a sweet / spicy Korean dressing (chojang).  Some of the best salmon sashimi I've ever had, and this is coming from someone who doesn't even enjoy eating salmon.  The kimchi pork and tofu was alright - not worth getting, as it was not much different than what you would get elsewhere.  The portions are certainly much smaller and a price point of $16 is just not worth it.  Get another salmon sashimi salad and you'll be just fine.",1,0,0,Winston G.,"Chicago, IL",458,809,23
5.0,1/13/2013,"Amazingly good Korean food...prob ties the Honeypig in DC area as the best Korean food I've had outside of Korea.  I prefer the types of food here more than Danji. Recommend pork/beef skewers, rice cakes, salmon sashimi.Not the greatest estimation of wait time right now so just budget in a little more time if you are walking in. Very friendly staff and chef making the experience great.",0,1,0,Kaopectate P.,"New York, NY",0,45,0
4.0,1/11/2013,"I went to this location with a group of six people total and everyone enjoyed the food as well as the drinks! My group included a couple who had dined at the restaurant before and so we ordered based on their recommendations. The Scallion pancake, and kimchi pork with tofu like a cloud were both delicious and the chicken thigh skewers were very tender. My Favorite dish however were the spicy rice cake dish called ""Pork fat Ddokbokki"" it was incredible.The food here is meant to be shared and I would say that two people per dish with 4-5 dishes is a decent sized meal. Of course we over ordered and at the end were just ordering to try different dishes on the menu. While we didn't make room for desert the drinks are delicious and the Korean margarita is excellent and refreshing with a strong cucumber flavor. (the rice beer is interesting but not for everyone)The wait staff was friendly and solicitous and made recommendations as we continued to add to our order. Overall a bit pricy but that wont stop me from returning soon!",1,0,0,Sofia Z.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0
5.0,1/10/2013,"Went to Hanjan last week & had a really extraordinary meal - a lot of great offerings here.  be sure to talk to your waitress about what will be amply filling as some of the dishes are quite small while others are quite large.Note that a lot of the negative reviews here have mentioned that the food isn't normal/typical korean - don't think that this place is really trying to do a normal korean thing, just trying to use traditional ingredients / flavors & then do something different with them.would really highly recommend the pork belly skewers, the octopus stir fry, & the salmon sashimi ... honorable mention to the ddukboki rice cakes fried in duck fat.",3,0,0,A.R.

4.0,1/5/2013,"You know the banchan that usually is complimentary to most korean dishes? (complimentary being the key word).  Well, according to our waiter, ""everything costs money here.""  This is true.  You want some extra kimchi and vegetable roots to munch on while you wait for the food? Expect to pay up.  If you want to stuff yourself over BBQ meat and smell like BBQ, this place is probably not for you.  However, if you want to sit in a rustic, intimate, tavern-inspired setting, sampling Korean-inspired tapas, then yes.  If you have money to splurge, make that a double.Their dishes are small but quality over quantity.  Their sashimi salad was fresh and light.  We moved on to heavier dishes such as the stir fired octopus and the pork fat rice cake and fishcake.  Octopus was cooked tender and had a nice little kick.  The rice cake was flavored well (duh-it's sprinkled generously with pork fat!).  Probably the weakest dish we tried was the fried rice (ironically the biggest dish).  You're better off eating it elsewhere and saving that money for a drink.Come here to get the night started or don't expect to be full (unless you eat like a rabbit and gets full easily).",4,1,1,Wing L.,"Long Island, NY",201,245,78
4.0,12/27/2012,"Place was great, went the 2nd day it was open but service was still very good.   Food was fantastic also - fried chicken and pork belly were the best.   One negative, the whiskey cocktail on the drink menu was awful - stick with one of the beers on tap.",1,0,1,Jon F.,"Financial District, NY",0,7,0
4.0,12/25/2012,"Really enjoy the Korean food in tapa style portion here. A really happening and buzzing spot with a beautiful wooden bar in the front. Great ginger cocktail and the 50 Soju. Loved the fried chicken, fried rice,  and pork and kimchi. A more modern and hip environment than the restaurants in k-town. I will be back soon.",3,0,0,Lillian L.,"Manhattan, NY",43,8,3
1.0,12/25/2012,Just as disappointing as their uptown restaurant.  Maybe they don't have their sh#! together yet.  Was really hoping it was going to be good especially since I was hoping for a good Korean restaurant in NYC since I haven't found one.  LA still has great korean.  Wish someone would open a great Korean in NYC.  Any suggestions??,1,1,1,David J.,"New York, NY",131,71,244
5.0,12/22/2012,"Happened to pass this place on our way to another dinner reservation. The decor looked like a high-end Korean tavern, so we couldn't resist canceling our other plans and coming here for dinner. The menu is tapas-style. We really enjoyed the dumplings, sashimi salad, and the skewers. With such a small dining room, we hope that too many other people don't discover this place. Its sister restaurant in Hells Kitchen was the first Korean restaurant to receive a Michelin star, so it's probably just a matter if time before this one gets packed as well. Our server (Gini) was very attentive and helpful throughout dinner. Had a great time and hope to be back soon!",6,1,1,Arjun S.,"Manhattan, NY",8,54,1
4.0,12/17/2012,"Went on opening night, so I'm sure things will continue to evolve, but loved the new space, the bar is comfortable (and slightly larger than Danji's), and the space looks great.I enjoyed a nice 12 year Yamazaki at the bar, then proceeded to have a full meal there, in lieu of taking a table.We tried a variety of dishes and especially enjoyed the perilla jeon, fishcake & daikon soup, and the scallion pancake with squid..Excited to see what's next and how things evolve..",4,0,1,Jeff Y.,"New York, NY",19,48,2

1.0,12/14/2012,"This is a review for the reservation service for Hanjan as we were not even able to sit down to review the food.  We contacted Hanjan around 10am to make a reservation and they told us they do not take reservations until noon, fine.  We promptly called back at noon to make a reservation for five people and they told us that they do not take reservations for groups of five or larger and the best they can do was make a note that a party of five was coming at 8pm (basically a call ahead) and that this in no way guaranteed us a table.This is the fun part, we arrive promptly at 8pm at the restaurant and tell the hostess that we had called earlier and the person on the phone had made a note of us coming at 8pm.  The hostess then told us that they do not seat groups larger then 4 at that time, but to try again around 9:30pm.  This was infuriating.  If they told us when we had called at noon about this 4 person rule, we would have found a different restaurant.  Instead, we arrived to be turned away and to think of an alternative on the fly.  BE WARNED: If you have a group larger than 4, do not try to to go to Hanjan before 9:30pm.",11,4,1,vincent c.,"Holmdel, NJ",71,45,70
