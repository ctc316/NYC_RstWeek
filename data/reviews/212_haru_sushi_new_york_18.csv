5.0,4/28/2019,"Great little sushi spot in Hell's Kitchen. Was going to stop into another place to eat but saw the rating on the door so kept walking and ran into this spot. So glad we did. Super modern, clean, and fresh inside. It was mid afternoon and there were only a few tables occupied but the service was great and everything came out quickly. The sushi (spicy tuna roll) was really fresh and tasted great. Looking for a quick sushi roll, give this place a try!",0,0,1,Tyler H.,"Houston, TX",148,312,450
5.0,4/13/2019,"This review is for delivery.Not sure why all the bad reviews. I ordered from here tonight and the delivery was so fast! I love it. My order was correct. I ordered the salmon avocado maki roll, fresh wasabi, and tuna tataki appetizer. I love that they have fresh wasabi vs the fake stuff (which was also in the meal lol; see photo). The salmon avocado roll was good, nothing fancy. The avocado was fresh in the roll and the salad. The sesame seed tuna was fresh with good flavor. I like that it all arrived chilled. The lettuce in the tuna tataki was fresh and crisp. I didn't care for the fried onions on top and just wiped them off. Have you tried the chili-garlic ponzu? It's AMAZING. I wanted to drink it haha! Prices are great too. Worth it. Love the free delivery. I'll be ordering from here again in the near future. :)",4,0,1,Kristen G.,"Hoboken, NJ",2,90,261

4.0,12/8/2018,"Everywhere else in the immediate vicinity, on this particular Saturday evening in December, had a wait of 40 minutes or more so we landed here. It was chilly outside and though I love sushi, I wanted warm food. The adults shared some small plates. The hot and sour soup was delicious, with seafood and rice noodles - very spicy. The crispy duck wasn't as crispy as I'd hoped, but it was still yummy. The blue crab corn fritters were crazy delicious and came with ample, equally delicious dipping sauce which we found multiple uses for. The lobster tacos were absolutely memorable. My 11 yr old son was very happy with the chicken katsu with sauce on the side. They made a mistake with our order and were very apologetic and helpful.

3.0,10/7/2018,"I checked out the happy hour at Haru on Friday a couple weeks ago with my friend. It was decent. I've been before and had a better experience in terms of customer service. This particular time the bartender/Waiter wasn't warm or friendly. He was a bit snarky and didn't check on us or greet us right when we sat down. Despite the service we decided to stay and give the food a shot. The actual happy hour menu didn't have that many vegan options but the full dinner menu has small plates and rolls that are vegan. I went with Agedashi Tofu, Cauliflower Tempura and the Spinach Sesame. They were out of Frosé  so I settled for the Koshu Masamune Sake. The Agedashi Tofu was definitely the best out of the three except it came out first and the other dishes took so long to come out that by the time they did it had gotten a little cold. The next best was the Cauliflower Tempura which was good. The batter was the right texture and the cauliflower was crunchy which I was ok with. The lemon-chili mayo got swapped for Citrus Ponzu and it worked. My least favorite dish, that I don't recommend at all was the Spinach Sesame. It was the first time I had sautéed spinach cold and don't think it works well. It felt like and tasted like I was eating soggy romaine lettuce that sat in the fridge overnight. It was topped with Tahini and sesame seeds which didn't make it any better. The ambiance of the restaurant is definitely very nice. Very chic meets zin. Once again, considering the service I received and the quality of the food I would say it's decent at best.",0,0,0,Marita P.,"New York, NY",233,12,13

4.0,7/18/2018,"Hello All, I hope this review helps you pick another fine dining experience.  I know mine was!First off, Haru Sushi is really a unconsuming small restaurant on 9th Ave.  Which there is hundreds, if not more. On first arrival, noticed that the place was of nice décor.  Small sushi area if you want to watch the action.  Kintoro, our wonderful waiter walked up through the menu and we settled on the ""King Carb Dumplings"" the Sashimi plate for two and Sushi for two.  The fish was amazing, delicate and delicious.  Presentation was wonderful, they know how to present a wonderful platter  On Kintoro's advice, we ordered the Daigingo Sake, WOW what a wonderful Sake for sure.  Not served hot as I normally receive but rather on the cold side.  It was amazing, not I have to find a Japanese market that sells this wonderful sake.  Just a really great place to enjoy a wonderful dinner.  I have actually ordered take-away food since our first visit and it was equally amazing.  Price overall was in the norm of the city but with great service and great quality food.  You cant go wrong.  Good eating!",0,0,0,Steven H.,"New York, NY",0,11,1

4.0,6/4/2018,"This is my 3rd time going here and let me tell you, the food is great! I have gotten the salmon teriyaki bento box each time. It's served with a complimentary miso soup or salad, side of rice, sushi rolls, and a fried vegetable-shrimp mix. The restaurant is extremely clean and has an upscale slash chill atmosphere. My only reason for the 4 stars are a result of the table-side mannerisms exhibited by the staff. First and foremost, I used to wait table for years while I was in college getting a degree in healthcare so every time I dine at a restaurant, I'm a bit more critical. Starting with the hostess, she didn't properly greet us (my opinion). Generally a ""hi, how are you"" with a smile is a great start. This didn't happen today. The hosted only words were ""table for 2?"" and then she sat us. Our waitress made her way to our table. Again, I waited tables for years and had a many repeat customers and surveys submitted based on my performance so I'm critical here. I was always taught to 1) introduce myself, 2) ask if it's the guests first time dining here or if they've been here before and 3) talk about any specials or describe how the menu works. Our waitress came to the table, sat 2 waters down and asked if he wanted anything to drink besides water. We declined the offer, then she asked if we knew what we wanted and placed our order. Not so genuine and I never got her name. Please don't let this deter you from dining here, the food is great, the staff just has to step up their game :)",0,0,0,Geremy C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",125,1,0

3.0,2/11/2018,"I took take out tonight, a Sunday night rather than eating in as planned, because I found the prices high: $8.00 for a small hot sake and tea is not complimentary (unusual in NYC).  I just got one yellow tail scallion roll and one salmon avocado roll.  They both were inside out rolls which is nice however the yellowtail scallion had just a fairly small piece  of fish plus a bit of scallion and did not taste that fresh.  (Well maybe because it was Sunday).  (I prefer when the yellow tail is chopped up like a tartar in a yellow tail scallion roll). For $7.00 the price seemed high. The salmon avocado was very tasty and plumper.  The atmosphere seemed very nice, the decor, the music and the 'special rolls' being served looked delicious.  Probably a nice place to go with a date, however I was not impressed with the freshness particularly of the yellowtail, so probably would not go back.",0,0,0,Jane H.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,45,0

The bar tables set up in front of the sushi bar were also a little off-- the chairs were too high for the table, meaning you couldn't sit fully under the table. A little awkward.

2.0,10/13/2017,"My friends and I used to come every now and then when the Haru - Hell's Kitchen location first opened.  It has a beautiful interior space (their garage doors are a plus and I wish I could have seen them opened up when the weather was nice), is clean, and in a convenient location.  Due to the fact that it is a chain sushi restaurant, we didn't expect much when we first went.  They have very ""Americanized"" sushi that isn't necessarily the most creative ranging from your standard rolls and sushi/sashimi to a few specialty rolls and a variety of cooked foods.  The best way I can describe their sushi is to compare it to really good supermarket sushi - I'll eat it, and it's fine, but the fish isn't the freshest, and they aren't really all that creative.  The price at Haru is on the higher end for what it is, but they have some delicious items, like their Shishito Peppers (yum!) and the Gramercy Park Roll (my favorite roll here), which is why we were open to going back.  Unfortunately the service here has really tanked over the summer months.  Under their first manager, the service was great - our water glasses were always full, fresh napkins were always on the table whenever need arose, and the wait staff was always well informed and helpful when asked questions about the sake or the food.  To me, a restaurant experience isn't just about the food, but also about the service, and when the general manager is on the floor and makes sure to check in with all the tables, that to me shows dedication to giving their customers a good dining experience.  However, as of late spring I've noticed that the manager at this location has changed and the service has just gone down since.  The food is fine (it's a chain restaurant after all), but I no longer find myself open to going here since the change of management.",2,0,0,Jane Y.,"Manhattan, NY",168,107,308

We love the ambiance and clean decor in here, and the full wall that opens up along the street by the bar isn't half bad either.

Fab wine menu, fun cocktails, plenty to choose from drink-wise 3. Options, options, options. I personally don't like the nori that traditional sushi is wrapped in, and here they have both soy wrap and cucumber wraps to keep me happy, though I realize I'm very much the minority when it comes to this BUT the cucumber rolls are rice-free! Hellooooo skinny rolls. Also, you can take your non-sushi friends here because they have plenty of apps, teriyaki options, noodles, and more so you aren't restricted to just sush. Yeah, the price point is a little steep, especially when you include alcohol BUT it's nowhere near blue ribbon prices so that's a win.

One of our rolls was crunchy salmon. It tasted abnormally oily, the taste of oil that has been used way too many times. Gross. The rest of the rolls were average at most.Service -Terrible. The staff is, for lack of a better word, ghetto. We sat at the bar and they were talking loudly (or yelling), coursing, and acting like there were no customers at the restaurants. One staff member sat next to us and she ate sushi rolls (not hand rolls) with her hands while others ate french fries dripping sauce out of a box right next to us. So unpleasant. The worst part, when we pointed out to our waiter that one of our rolls didn't taste right - his response was ""okay"" and he gave us the check that included that roll. Not sorry, not I'll check with the chef, not I'll remove it from the check, just ""okay."" The restaurant's manager - who seemed polite and well spoken - was there the whole time and permitted the staff's behavior.

Bottom line, HARU doesn't give a crap about their clientele. The are a cash factory  masquerading as a trendy sushi parlor.  Their tables and chairs are terribly uncomfortable because they're not sized at correct heights. Their food is over priced and boring.

(-1) We first wanted to get take out, but then decide to stay because it was going to take twenty minutes anyways to make the food. When we told her we would be staying, she seemed kind of put off. We ordered the Chicken and Salmon Bento boxes. The salmon was delicious but I think it's a bit overpriced for the amount of food. Also, the store was nearly empty..yet we had to chase down a waiter/waitress to refill our cups. (-1) Overall, I think this place has potential but it (the service) needs some work.",3,2,1,Meiyee W.,"Flushing, NY",494,213,802

2.0,4/21/2017,"My husband and I stopped here for a late afternoon snack .We ordered California roll , eel cucumber roll and salmon avocado roll  . The rolled where pretty bad the rice was dry and cold it felt like it was pre made and sat in the refrigerator for a while . It was very disappointing since the restaurant is new and nice looking .",0,0,0,Michal G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,27,0
1.0,4/21/2017,"Walked into the restaurant to get a table. The manager told us there was an hour and 15 min wait. There was no one in restaurant but only maybe 5 to 10 people and plenty of empty tables. Never going back there again. Manager said : ""now it's 6:05 what are you going to do about it??????"" We said no thank you and left , then he said wait , but we were gone already to go better neighborhood place. Never again !",0,0,0,Alina S.,"Atlantic City, NJ",477,2,0

Great specialty rolls - particularly love the Gramercy Park and Kiss of Fire. If you're looking for a non-sushi option, the chili garlic shrimp is the way to go!",1,0,0,K. J.,"Manhattan, NY",8,51,0

4.0,4/9/2017,"Newest Haru on 9th avenue! I've been to the one in time square before but this recently opened up in my neighborhood.  Very spacious with plenty of elbow room for everyone.I ordered the muscles, and the filet mignon yakitorri. I didn't order sushi, so can't comment on that but I was pretty hungry and wanted beef. The filet mignon yakitori was juicy and full of flavor, I would try the filet mignon next time! Oyster were okay, I didn't really taste the flavor. Staff and the manager were very friendly and helpful.",4,2,2,Jenny N.,"New York, NY",197,223,398
2.0,4/7/2017,Really mediocre. Fish was bland and soggy like it was frozen and defrosted many times. Appetizers were equally underwhelming,1,0,0,Win L.,"Manhattan, NY",58,45,30
3.0,4/6/2017,"For a place with such a nice vibe, the sushi was disappointing. Satisfactory, but not worth the price. I got the calamari, which was good but evoked an onion ring. It came with a really nice sauce, sweet and spicy. The salmon sashimi was average ish, and wasn't as fresh or soft as sashimi should be. The roll I got was (the spicy titanic? I forget the name) salmon and avocado and caviar over crunchy tuna. The tempura was unfortunately soggy and lacked crunch, and as before the fish just didn't taste that fresh.Great service and a classy atmosphere.",1,0,0,Emily Z.,"Bellevue, WA",0,23,14
4.0,4/2/2017,"Like the vibe.  Manager was friendly and quite concerned that we enjoyed our experience. Overall, we did.  The sushi was inventive. The gramercy park was the highlight (the addition of Citrus was a welcome surprise).  I was not a fan of the Phily Roll (my usual favorite)... it was a bit fishy. The lyche martini was excellent!It took a bit for us to get seated despite our reservation and the bar service was slow while we waited for our table. The actual service in the restaurant was good.",1,0,0,Kate F.,"Fort Mitchell, KY",107,456,2369

1.0,3/18/2017,"One of the worst sashimi I've ever had. It was not fresh. NOT FRESH. Looks like it got frozen and defrosted multiple times.Also, the drinks were the least amount of liquor diluted with pure syrup. I guess if you are prepared to be 220lbs by summer, that's a drink to have.",1,1,0,David L.,"New York, NY",70,29,12
4.0,3/12/2017,"Visited the newest Haru, now conveniently located in my neighborhood, which means Happy Hour is less than a block away. Love the Happy Hour menu at all the Haru locations, which go anywhere from 3 to 7 p.m., depending on location. The rolls and other choices are extremely well-priced and plentiful for a late afternoon or right after-work snack. I wasn't crazy about the red wine choice when I stopped in for the first time - not sure if it was the brand, but it tasted a bit sour. Other than that, great new spot for HH in NYC!",1,0,0,Delaina D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",286,3,2

4.0,2/19/2017,"I was most pleased to see that Haru had opened up in Hell's Kitchen even though there is one on 43rd street near Times Square.  It is a nice sized space, extremely modern and the help was most accommodating. I was seated immediately and water was provided. I took a look at the menu and decided on the sushi platter. I also ordered from the a la carte menu-an piece of eel, tamago and octopus. The sushi platter did not come with miso soup or salad which would have been extra. The food was delicious and the fish was very fresh. It was an excellent meal. The owner/manager came by at the end of my meal to check to see if everything was to my liking. I would recommend and return.",1,1,1,Nick C.,"Manhattan, NY",72,555,279
