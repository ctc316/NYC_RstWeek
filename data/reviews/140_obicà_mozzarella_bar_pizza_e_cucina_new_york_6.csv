5.0,4/21/2019,"Seven stars if I could. The dining experience for brunch took me back to Italy, the pizza at Obica is why you'd travel to the gastronomic center of the universe. Obica has locations all over Italy, and it seems that the tradition carried over nicely to New York. Exceptional staff, airy decor, and the fresh flavors you can only appreciate if you've had modern Italian cuisine is what makes the place one of the few places in NYC I'd care to return to.",0,0,0,Mike T.,"New York, NY",228,107,34
1.0,3/28/2019,"Picked up their mazzi pecchiri pasta for lunch. It had 12 pieces of pasta at max, was undercooked and had 1 piece of mozzarella along with 1 piece of basil. The sauce was sweet, watery and seemed hastily cooked. It was not worth the $20 at all. My friend got the panini, which was bland and dry. This place doesn't even deserve 1 star for their overpriced and disappointing food.",0,0,0,Shreeya B.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",132,3,0
3.0,3/23/2019,"One of those places that can be good if you order correctly, but I can't say that everything is good. What was good: stick to some appetizers; meet and cheese platter; salad with almonds and avocado with fresh lemon and olive oil; prosciutto di Parma; Margherita pizza (don't let the waiter tell you it's personal pizza size, like they did us). One can feed two people if you order other starters or sides. Pastas are smaller and can be split into two small sizes or for one. What wasn't good: salsiccia pizza    was dripping in juice and all mushy in the middle. Also doesn't have red sauce on it which I didn't know until I got it. But otherwise just didn't have much flavor. Crust was good texture outside of in the middle. Overall average food. Service was ok. But good spot for groups; big space.",3,2,2,Victoria O.,"New York, NY",195,120,175
4.0,3/17/2019,"Just had drinks here so will def come back to give a food review. Until then...The drinks were awesome. Strong and flavorful. They used fresh garnishes, you know the type you gotta smack to release the scent. (Do they do that for flavor too?) And real cherries! Not that candy red crap you get a FRIDAYS lolAnyway, the drinks were great. All their classic drinks are 10 bucks.... that's happy hour next to Madison Square park. Dope spaced- huge!

3.0,3/13/2019,"Loud corporatey environment. I guess that's good if you want to fill the noise during an awkward date or work happy hour, but it can be really difficult to have a regular conversation with the people you're dining with.The cocktails aren't that great. The food is alright. We had a pasta that was simple but lacked flavor, and a beef tartar dish that was decent but nothing special. The burrata was good, but you really can't get burrata wrong. Service was normal. Overall It was just overpriced for the quality received.I'd recommend Boqueria for a similar ambience, with better value of price of food.",1,0,0,Elisa L.,"New York, NY",400,389,513
2.0,3/7/2019,"Had high hopes for this place. Seemed trendy, popular and the food was good. However, the service left me unimpressed. Arrived around 6pm on a Thursday and asked if we could get a table. Place was half empty. Hostess said sure, but I'll need the table back at 730pm. We graciously accepted, as this would leave us over an hour for dinner. The food came out quickly thankfully, and we sipped on our drinks for a bit. At 7 on the dot, a seemingly annoyed man rushes over and tells my companion, ""I need your table, NOW"". He didn't leave any room for conversation (uh, we thought we had till 730...uh, can we get the check?) and it looked like he only targeted us (maybe the two tables near us had reservations? ). But we flagged him down and asked for the check and got out of there quickly. We even noticed the back half of the restaurant had a bunch of empty tables. I thought his approach and demeanor were inappropriate and uncalled for. We were not doing anything wrong, yet it felt like he was kicking us out. Had the waitress given us a 7pm limit, we would have either gone elsewhere or eaten faster. This restaurant was nice, but I'm not going to beg to give them my business. Will not be returning.",0,0,0,Reshma B.,"New York, NY",122,312,6
2.0,3/3/2019,"This most recently trip to Obica was a true disappointment all around. I've been to this restaurant on 3 occasions for dinner, most recently with the same group of people I came with the first time I ever dined here. The first time (back in Jan 2018), everyone I was with LOVED everything. When we planned our second dinner as a group we were all very excited to come back here....unfortunately, it didn't live up to our expectations. The food was boring, lacked flavor, and the presentation was embarrassing. We got some of the same dishes and tried some new things, and overall every dish brought to the table made us wish we had gone somewhere else to eat. I'm not sure what has changed over the past year, but I think they need to work with their kitchen staff to bring this place back up to what it used to be. Also, the service here is spotty and it's hard to get your waiters attention which is a huge pet peeve on mine. If you're in the neighborhood, they do have good drinks and a great happy hour deal. Other than that, you're in Manhattan and there are a thousand other better italian restaurants to dine at.",0,0,0,Karli B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",487,12,23

5.0,2/19/2019,"I 100% need to update my review from the last time I went here, because it was a night and day difference. I came here with my friend on a Friday night. We were seated right away. We were both craving cheese. We ended up ordering every single mozzarella they offered and this place did not disappoint me this time. One of my favorite types of mozzarella was the smoked (BUFALA AFFUMICATA). The Burrata was incredible. The black truffle (BURRATA AL TARTUFO) was very delicate and beautifully presented and their classic (BUFALA CLASSICA) was the stuff of dreams. It was amazing! We also ordered 3 types of salami, also amazing. The service was phenomenal.  Our food was brought out quickly and we had a much better table than the last time we were here. Overall, I totally misjudged this place. I think sometimes restaurant week isn't the best option for all places and I am so glad I gave this place another shot!",1,0,1,Marie S.,"New York, NY",297,143,289

3.0,1/30/2019,"We had a large group for a birthday brunch. We made the reservation easily and they didn't require a credit card which was nice. The place was actually pretty empty when we got there and not much busier when we left. The space is large and nicely decored. We started with a few cheese and charcuterie platters. Surprisingly the mozzarella, I'd assume their speciality, was disappointing. The pasta I had, cacie e pepe was likely was underwhelming.

3.0,1/17/2019,"Delicious place with a cute ambiance and ample seating. I was excited by the prospect of a 'mozzarella bar' though the burrata didn't live up to the name. It was served chilled and was not gooey on the inside as typical italian burrata is.The pizza on the other hand, was delicious. We got the vegana pizza with mozzarella and it was superb!The arancini was also a little disappointing, it was only 2 rice ballls and the center of the rice balls were served cold.The chocolate almond dessert was good but not amazing. Overall, the pizza was delicious but I would skip the other things and only come back for the pizza.",0,0,0,Gina M.,"New York, NY",79,191,44
3.0,1/17/2019,"Came here for an early dinner on a Saturday around 5:30. There were plenty of tables open but they sat us about 8"" from another couple (I know, I know, they were probably saving the other tables for later reservations). Drinks were overpriced (as expected) and not great. The biggest disappointments were the appetizers. We got the mozzarella appetizer - figured we had to with the name Mozzarella Bar - and it was 4 SMALL chunks of different mozzarellas for $25, which frankly didn't even taste good and didn't come presented well with breads, crackers or other accoutrement. And the arianchini which were cold and bland, and again, 2 small balls for $10. Our entrees were definitely a redeeming factor. I had the Trofie al Pesto and my boyfriend had the Taglierini Gamberi e Asparagi. They were both delicious. My boyfriend also loved his but remarked how it was funny it was called Asparagi and there was like no asparagus in it. We skipped dessert due to the appetizer let down.",0,0,0,Melanie D.,"Brookfield, CT",0,125,27

5.0,1/1/2019,"This was an amazing place to walk into last night being New Years Eve. My self and a few friends went in to check in out and never left, they had very tasteful balloons in silver and gold and a amazing dj doing 70s dance.  Best New Years party I ever stumbled into.  Not to mention the two sunning and fun Italian girls running the party Bianca who dances like Beyoncé and Christine who was tending to floor Both in 7os garb that I think they should wear everyday!  everyone was having a balls ass time for sure! dancing and had lights just right and drinks just strong enough!  Safe to say I'm going back to this place for lunch or dinner as a standard.  Food is amazing and the whole staff I just can't say enough.",0,0,0,Marty J.,"New York, NY",42,39,16

1.0,12/23/2018,From the outside we said wow this place is going to have great pizza and food.  They have to know what they are doing. We sat down the service was mediocre and so was the food. All pre-made not fresh. Food comes out instantly cause it's sitting out not made to order. Hair in my salad which was a 20 dollar pile of wilted tomatoes and lettuce. My husbands burrata pizza was tasteless. Get one thing right if your a mozzarella bar at least. The martinis were ok. Don't get the soloqui tastes like lemon cleaner would probably taste like.  So many good restaurants in NYC don't  bother with this one. Waiter didn't come over once to check on us and gratuity is automatically charged at 18 percent even for our party of 2 so you have no choice even after our horrible experience.,0,0,0,Sandra E.,"Hollis, NY",1,6,0
5.0,12/16/2018,"I thoroughly enjoyed this place. Between the drink options and food, you really leave here satisfied. I went with a group where we were seated downstairs (we didn't know it existed so maybe it's usually reserved for parties) and the lighting created a very intimate setting. We split the mozzarella bar experience platter which we devoured. I followed it up with the prosciutto crudo pizza which was SO delicious. There are gluten free options, which was unexpected considering this is an Italian establishment with a lot of bread and pasta, but I wouldn't recommend bringing lactose intolerant friends because they'd be missing out on all the cheeses. Lastly, the drinks were definitely on the pricier side but really good. I had a muddled mixed drink (viaggio) that made me feel like I was on vacation. I'd go back just for that drink, honestly. So if you're looking for a fancy date spot or just a night out with friends, this place is a solid choice.",0,0,0,Diana R.,"Queens, NY",3,33,53
3.0,12/16/2018,"Walked into Obica on a Saturday in December around 3pm for a late lunch. We were a group of 6 people and sat in a large booth. We ordered drinks and a few dishes to share. The waitress brought 2 bread baskets to the table...really awesome bread! The bottle of sauv Blanc we ordered was just okay and overpriced as expected. We ordered the mozzarella sampler and 2 pizzas to share. The mozz sampler was over $20 for 4 small pieces of mozz - two of which were pretty gross. One was way too smoked and the other tasted more like a goat cheese. Completely overpriced and not very enjoyable. We got a buffalo mozz pizza and the vegana pizza with mozz to split as well. The pizzas tasted good, but were way too thin so the slices flopped down when you picked them up so all of the toppings would immediately fall off. Convenient flatiron location, but likely wouldn't come back here as there's other spots with better wine/cheese and pizzas.",0,0,1,Alexandra T.,"Jersey City, NJ",353,407,326

The oil was a little heavy on the fried sampler but everything was flavorful.For dinner, we split the duck ragu tagliatelle and chicken Milanese. The pasta was delicious and fresh. The chicken cutlet was thin and crispy. We ordered a side of grilled vegetables that were good, as well. The service was a little slow but attentive to start. Our original waiter stopped coming back at one point, but another server an the manager made up for it. Both super warm and friendly.Finished with 3 gelato sampler, which was on the house.

The pasta is a bit bland and so is the service (hence minus a star). The waiter never checked on us if we wanted more food or drinks but he was friendly the 2 times we saw him all night.

Of course, the burrata is a must (and a pretty sizable portion), and any of the drinks I've tried were quite good as well.

Spoiler alert: it was not fine.We arrived for our reservation and were told Gilt City has not been paying the restaurant and so they are not accepting the voucher. That's an understandable, though disappointing, issue. The gentleman told us he tried calling us earlier in the week but couldn't reach us. Well, that didn't seem plausible since the reservation was made 24 hours beforehand. He also mentioned a company email should have informed staff to alert me to the issue when I called the day prior. Obviously that intel was not passed on to us.Whatever, all that mattered was we had traveled from Brooklyn and planned to have a nice dinner here and were suddenly frustrated and let down. We considered sitting for a meal regardless, or even for happy hour, but no longer felt enticed. The staff member basically just stared at us as we tried to come to a decision, which really sealed the deal.Obicá: sorry you are having issues with Gilt, but maybe consider doing your potential customers a solid and help turn things around? I'm sure you'd prefer 100% of our money vs whatever remains after Gilt takes their cut.

Gave four stars because mozzarella bar is the first thing in their name (lol) & also our waitress was amazing.Focus on the fact that it's a mozzarella bar and you won't be disappointed! Cheese/meat samplers are large and great quality. No complaints whatsoever about their mozzarella and burrata, which are . And their happy hour options are great.However, their entrees and actual meal foods are mediocre, decent but unmemorable at best. Two coworkers got the chicken which was apparently very dry and disappointing - so much so that one of them sent her dish back and got something else. The fish options were probably the best if you want an entree. But honestly I'd rather fill up on their prosciutto and burrata and bread!They also do something fancy with their tiramisu - there's a huge layer of foamy cream at the top. It felt like a giant cappuccino instead of a tiramisu cake. I usually appreciate creativity in desserts, but I personally wasn't a fan of the texture or taste of this tiramisu.Would come back with coworkers for a happy hour or work event, but wouldn't be my first choice to being friends or guests in town.",0,0,0,Nicole L.,"New York, NY",478,84,34

Also, we ordered the mozzarella sampler for $24, thinking we'd probably be full before dinner came out at that price. Sadly, that was not the case at all.

There was only one server staffing the entire front area and we didn't get water until 10-15 minutes after we sat down and didn't get to put in our order until another 10 minutes had passed. The portions are small for the prices and the pasta was only just fine. I had the seafood pasta, which supposedly had sea urchin, but if there were any, they were too tiny to taste.

3.0,6/9/2018,"There are not a ton of cute options along this stretch of Broadway, but the inside of Obica is a really nice stop for after work cocktails or dinner. We planned a work dinner here for a group of 7, with a big comfy booth in the back and a great shareable menu. We kicked off dinner with a round of drinks, the Mozzarella sampler (did I mention this is a ""mozzarella bar""?!) , the other more meaty sampler, a couple orders of the Polpette meatballs and the Grilled chicken salad. The samplers were a beautiful display of meats and cheese, olives and dips. The 2 orders of meatballs went fast, and the sauce they were in was delish- used it for dipping the bread after. The salad was also a great with some good chunks of chicken, avocado and cheese- this went fast.After this incredible round of apps, we all ordered entrees, and this is where I felt the restaurant fell short..A friend and I share 2 entrees because we couldn't decide- the truffle Parmesan chicken and the wild boar ragu. Honestly, these should have been insanely good, because I love all of these ingredients. The Chicken was pretty dry and lacked much truffle flavor. The Wild boat ragu was also dry, and I would have thought the ragu was a red sauce.. guess not? It seemed like no sauce, or a little butter sauce or something, but really seemed like drained pasta transferred to the plate, topped with the wild boar and served. I was able to save this one with some olive oil, as the wild boar was really tasty.I thought our 2 desserts recommended by the server both missed the mark as well, but she went cheesy and I usually go chocolate. So I think these were just a matter of preference..we ended up with a crispy sugary canoli like dessert and a pear cheesecake that had strawberries on top and chucks of pear actually within the slice.Id gladly go back for a happy hour timed outing with many drinks and apps, but when entree time hits I'll be heading home and cooking my own din.",0,0,0,Sam K.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",138,211,397

I had the bosco cocktail which was prosecco and berry purees and it was tasty. I also tried the spritz, which I was not a huge fan of.  after grabbing some drinks at the bar,  my party and I moved on to the dinner table.we had the vegetable pizza- unfortunately the bread was not crispy and a bit soggy. the vegetables were not cooked through and was bland tasting.we had cacio e pepe which was also a bit too ""al dente"" for my friends and I. we got the ""mozarella experience"" which is sample of cold cuts, mozzarella, and side vegetables.  the mozzarella and burrata was amazing! and the salami was favorite out of the prosciutto , mortadella, and salami. the presentation was not the best, instead of putting a bunch of whole tomatoes on the cutting board, i think they should have sliced it half or made it into a sauce, or completely taken it out. they should have put more mozzarella on the plate since it's called ""mozzarella experience"" and maybe take out the mortadella.  best dish we had of the night was the truffle burrata. there was generous shavings of truffle on the creamy burrata. Overall the service was really great, our waiter made us laugh. however some of the food was a hit or miss.

3.0,2/13/2018,"With so many locations worldwide, I was very intrigued by Obica Mozzeralla Bar. We visitied early on a Saturday night and were able to easily get a table for 2 without a reservation.Our waiter was very hospitable, but bread holds a very special place in my heart and I saw every table had a little bag of bread and we were not given any until I asked, sigh. Nonetheless, it was very good once it was there.We ordered the Mozzeralla Sampler ($24) that came with Bufala Classica and Basil Pesto (pretty good), Bufala Affumatica and Marinated Artichoke (very good), Stracciatella and Anchovies (OK), and Ricotta with Pine Nuts and Cranberries (OK -- somewhat bland). We ordered the Focaccina ($5) with oregano and sea salt. This tasted like store-bought pita bread and was pretty disappointing. It was dry, looked nothing like their pizza dough, and wasn't even served warm. Eh.I tasted my friend's Bufala Dop E Pomodoro, and it was absolutely fantastic. Large, thick pasta rings with a delicious cream touched sauce topped with parmesean and fresh basil. Simple, fresh, and tasted just like something my mom would make. I ordered the Pollo Insalate with avocado, blue cheese, tomato confit (just cherry tomatoes?), olives, toasted almonds, and viniagrette ($18). The salad was nice sized, very fresh, and I enjoyed it. I wish I can give this place 3.5 stars, because the pasta dish was extrodinary, the space is welcoming, and the salad was good enough. The mozzeralla was certainly a let-down for a place named after the cheese (Eataly's was much fresher), the focaccina was depressing, and I regret not ordering a pizza because my neighbor's looked delicious.

4.0,9/18/2017,"Overall, I appreciate their ability to accommodate larger groups last minute (hard in NYC especially on a Friday night). We called at 7:15ish, and got seating for 9 at 7:45pm on a Friday (no prior reservations, and they sat us when most of the group was there - was missing 1 person). Ambiance was also lively / good energy for a weekend night dinner. Heard good things from others around the table on the pasta and burrata, but the caprese salad I got was a bit of a bummer. The multi-colored tomato slices were cute, but the mozzarella was meh (have had better from whole foods), and it probably could use a little salt. The cocktail menu was fun and there are some interesting drinks on there, albeit pricey (I got the Vitis, which was rum and muddled grape with basil, citrus mix and cane syrup, for $16 that looks and sounds better than it tasted, but wasn't bad).",1,0,1,Jessica T.,"Manhattan, NY",279,214,551

The truffle on this was tasty and the portions were big.The Ravioli Freschi was delicious but a little salty. The pieces were on the smaller side but as far as ravioli dishes go which are typically smaller portions was still filling. Service: our waitress was very kind and attentive.

I -- the only person who chose the pizza -- was stunned by how big it was. I actually only ate two of four slices and saved two for dinner, which gives you some sense of how big it was (no objections from me; leftovers are always welcome for an easy dinner!). It was ridiculously delicious... just too big for one sitting. Ordered food aside, the bread and olive oil that you get to start are great, too -- perfectly crusty bread, zingy oil, and salt and pepper in grinders are a perfect accompaniment to obica's offerings.Definitely recommend this for a casual friends' gathering, work meal, or low-key first date!",2,0,0,Lorelei Y.,"New York, NY",283,351,169

The major caveat is that there are much better versions of everything on the menu at other places in the city. Not to mention, that a meal at Obica can also easily be one where you end up spending quite a bit more than you anticipate, despite the very reasonable prices you may see on the menu at first glance. Not usually a huge fan of overtly courteous service, but the rest of the reviews in regard to the underwhelming service are pretty spot-on.

3.0,8/18/2017,I came here for a small dinner with a friend. Obica is in a great location close to many trains. I wasn't really hungry but I saw they had a pretty good happy hour so that's what sealed the deal here. I placed a reservation the day of and when I came I was seated immediately. The happy hour is only available at the bar. Pretty frustrating because we were literally in front of the bar but was seated at a table. The bar area is small and was already crowded so we couldn't sit there anyways and order our food unless we wanted to stand. There were people already standing by the bar but they were just drinking. It's annoying because it's in flatiron where theres a lot of companies so it would get crowded during happy hour. My friend and I ended up just staying where we were seated. I ordered a glass of wine and a burrata. I did like how they had more than one option for cheeses and it comes with a good amount of bread. The burrata was a good portion and being not hungry it made me pretty full. My friend ordered ragu pasta. She however didn't really enjoy it because it was a little tough and she wasn't a fan of the type of pasta they used. The service was kind of bad. No one asked if our food was ok. No one refilled our water until we asked and when I finished my glass of wine the server didn't ask if I would want another.,3,0,2,Ashley N.,"Manhattan, NY",426,368,749
4.0,8/11/2017,"The other reviews on this restaurant are spot on - the service is not great but the food more than makes up for it. I would give it a 3.5. (Note: I am not including the bartenders in this statement, the bartender that helped me last night was such a sweetheart.)My SO and I went for restaurant week dinner and we both loved it! We left stuffed and satisfied.The meal starts with a cute brown bag of white and whole wheat bread and olive oil for dipping. This is a nice touch as the food took a while to come out and we were very hungry when we sat down.For appetizers, we ordered the mozzarella sampler and the fried mozzarella. The fried mozzarella is four small balls that are reminiscent of mozzarella sticks but a tad fancier. The sauce is a creamy red sauce - very good. The mozzarella sampler comes with four different cheeses (hard mozzarella, soft (buratta), smoked, and a fourth that I am uncertain on) and some small pairings for the cheeses like a tomato (and I mean ONE tomato) and an artichoke heart. For dinner I got the truffle, mozzarella, ricotta, and smoked ham pizza. It was delicious! It was a little greasy (what would you expect from all that cheese?!) and I could have done without the truffles but they were mild enough. My SO got the filet, cooked exactly as he ordered, served with a side of potatoes. He ate every bite (and some of my pizza!!) and loved it all!Now, for dessert I got the flour less chocolate cake - this was a glorified brownie with nuts. I did not care for it at all. It was served with ice cream on top which was nice, but there was nothing special about the brownie. I could have made a better one and served it to people last night and I think they would have liked it more. My SO got the caramel dessert which he loved, ate every bite. So my recommendation for dessert is steer clear of the chocolate cake, please!!The service was spotty, as I said earlier. When we told our waitress we were done and didn't want anything else, we had to wait and flag her down 15 minutes later to get our check. Besides those two encounters, we spoke to her maybe two other times the whole evening - when we ordered and when she brought us our drinks.The ambiance: the restaurant itself is pretty dark but not so dark that you can't see each other. It got VERY loud, however, so loud that we started yelling at each other, which I did not care for. This place is not good for kids so do not bring them. It is loud and the food doesn't cater to little ones. It is fancy but my SO was wearing a nice t-shirt and didn't look out of place. So as long as you don't look like a slob you should be fine.I would give this place a try if you are looking for good food and you don't care about the service. The happy hour is only at the bar until 7 so my suggestion would be grab a drink at the bar before your reservation and save yourself some $$$.",1,0,0,Allie R.,"New York, NY",323,118,31

5.0,6/24/2017,"Spotty service but great food.Went there on a busy Thursday with a friend. From the bar to the actual wait staff the service was pretty off. The bartender was beyond annoyed just taking orders when I was waiting on my party to arrive, threw me a menu without letting me finish a question, so I just ordered and hoped the food would at least make up for it. But the managers managed to save the day, making up for when it was obvious the staff was nowhere to be found or forgot about us in between handing out menu and taking the orders. And they were fantastic at that and kept checking in on us throughout the meal.  Now onto the food. Yum. We had a selection of Italian meats and cheeses, the mozzarella and burrata were fresh and delicious as was the eggplant appetizer that came with that. You can get it separately as well,  i will do this next time with an extra serving of the foccacia bread that was also to die for.

The Tartufo pizza (Black Trufflee, Mozzarella, Ricotta di Bufala, Roasted Ham) was not great. Her Pappardelle with duck ragu and orange zest was disappointing. Duck tasted more like low-quality ground beef, but at least the orange zest came through. My tonno salad was inedible. It had cured sicilian tuna (that tasted like the worst canned tuna), hard-boiled egg, the world's saltiest anchovies (my friend actually spit it out), string beans (a weird ingredient for a salad in my opinion), taggia olives, and cherry tomatoes.

4.0,5/8/2017,"I came here with a party of 9 for an 8pm reservation and we were seated 8:30pm. While waiting for our table to be set up, we were looking at the menu outside but we found out it was an outdated menu and some dishes were not available. I had my eyes set on the squid ink pasta but found out once we were seated they don't have that dish for the night. So if you find yourself waiting to be seated, ask the hostess for a menu instead of making the same mistake as me. For starters, we shared the bufala classica mozzarella, prosciutto crudo di parma and bresaola della valtellina. In English, it basically translates to mozzarella, prosciutto and cured beef and arugula. We also shared a prosciutto crudo pizza. The starters came out at different times so we devoured one plate before the next was served. It was a busy night so service was slow, which didn't bother us so much if we weren't starving due to the delay in reservation time. Also, we order 5-6 drinks and they were served after appetizers which I don't seem to get. Drinks should be the first to come out so that way it keeps us happy. On to the starters, they were all good but the portions are small so if you got a big appetite, you should get the pizza which is more filling. As for drinks, I got a cocktail called saggissimo which is pineapple and lime juice, sage syrup and seltzer. The drink is light and refreshing but quite pricey at $13 for a non-alcoholic drink. For entrée, I opted for tagliolini after finding out there's no squid ink pasta. The pasta was pretty good; the sauce wasn't too heavy and the shrimp is fresh. I ended the night with tiramisu and it was creamy but a bit too sweet for my liking.

2.0,5/4/2017,Let me first start with the positives. The drinks are relatively cheap and you can get a bottle of wine for 40 dollars at dinner. A huge plus. The mozzarella and the burrata were both amazing. I would highly recommend the mozzarella experience and that's all about all I would recommend on the menu. We bought three pizzas. The burrata pizza was literally just sauce and a dollop of cold burrata on it. It wasn't very appetizing. The second pizza was the black truffle pizza and it was good but the crust was so thin that the cheese was coming through the crust. The third pizza was the sausage and pepper pizza. I feel like they were trying for a smoky feel to it but everyone at the table complained it tasted like a campfire. And again the crust on all of the pizzas were so thin the pizza toppings were coming through it. The service was fantastic but it could not make up for how bad the food was.

4.0,3/28/2017,"Obica was a solid Italian dinner in the Flatiron neighborhood! The ambience is light and airy with high ceilings making it a good spot for a casual gathering with friends. The décor is unique and modern with exposed steel piping on the ceiling and above the bar area and a glass, reflective bar. The restaurant itself is pretty vast so should be a good spot to accommodate large parties.  The hype around the mozzarella is real- the burrata (Burrata al Tartufo Nero) had the best mozzarella cheese I have ever had! The cheese was cool, creamy, and fresh. The serving size of the burrata was good enough for two people. The black truffle was sparse and didn't add much extra flavor to the appetizer so not sure it was worth paying the $4 and would recommend the classic burrata. After all, you are going for the cheese! For an appetizer, we also shared the Patate al Tartufo which wasn't that great. The potatoes were hard and over cooked and tasted like fast food fries. The dipping sauce was pretty good but nothing extraordinary. Would suggest just sticking with the mozzarella bar for appetizer. For our main entrée, we split a Bufala DOP pizza and Ravioli Freschi. WOW, was the pizza AMAZING! Probably amongst the best pizza of my life- thin crusted, not too cheesy or saucy. Reminded me of pizza that you get in Italy. The pizza was big enough to split amount two people but I could have eaten the whole thing on my own. The ravioli wasn't that great- too salty and too cheesy (parmesan cheese). Overall, would definitely recommend the restaurant for its mozzarella and pizza. Dinged one start for the poor appetizer and pasta entree but would love to come back and try more items to hopefully get it to a five! It is slightly pricey with a semi-decent bottles of wine start in the mid-50s range.

4.0,3/18/2017,"I love cheese, and consequently love ordering cheese plates when out to eat, but I usually tend to go for the stronger, more pungent cheeses rather than creamier cheeses like mozzarella and ricotta. But that's not to say that they aren't worth enjoying from time to time, and Obica is definitely the place to get mozzarella. The cheese is flown in twice per week from Italy, so the stuff you're eating is likely only several days removed from the water buffalo.The main reason for our visit was to try the Mozzarella Experience, a selection of four cheeses and accoutrements (Bufala Classica and Basil Pesto; Bufala Affumicata and Marinated Artichoke; Stracciatella and Anchovies; Ricotta, Pine Nuts and Cranberries). Each cheese was excellent, but perhaps the highlights for me were the classica and pesto, which was also served with a few fresh cherry tomatoes, as well as the ricotta, a type of cheese that I often find bland and boring, but here it won me over with its creamy texture and fresh taste. The bufala affumicata is great for lovers of smokey cheese like me, but beware: the flavor is pretty intense. Trying the bufala classica and the stracciatella side by side was almost like having a deconstructed burrata. We also ordered a small plate, the Speck Affumicato Alto Adige DOP (smoke cured pork), which made for an excellent pairing with the cheese.We finished the meal off with the Tartufo pizza (Black Truffle, Mozzarella and Ricotta di Bufala, Ham). This was very good, with an obvious focus on the mozz and the light, flavorful crust, but I guess maybe since we had just enjoyed a ton of cheese and cured ham, we somewhat ran the risk of cheese/ham overkill. The truffle flavor was pleasant, but not overpowering. No issues with the service or ambience. The atmosphere was typical of the Flatiron: Trendy, exposed brick, etc., but there were pictures of the mozzarella-making process, which was fun and obviously pertinent to the theme of the place. Obica is also weirdly spacious for New York; there's a lot of walking-around room, but then the tables and chairs are all packed in together. We had to move our table around a bit in order for me to sit comfortably.",5,1,3,Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",341,548,34

5.0,3/1/2017,"Tl;dr: most definitely try this place out. If with a larger group, order one or two items from each section of the menu for sharing; if you're a smaller party, choose the ""La Prima Volta"" tasting menu. Whenever anyone asks me for a recommendation for a new place to try, I always, without fail, recommend Obica. Why? It's a goddamn mozzarella bar (!!), and who doesn't love some delicious homemade mutz?! While they have a traditional menu in the sense that you can safely and happily choose an app, entree, and dessert and be satisfied, the beauty of this place is that your small plates/tasting options are endless, downright delicious, and affordable. Seriously, grab a group of friends and order alllll of the things. You can try your mozzarella in several varieties (di bufala, smoked, or burrata) and, if you're feeling adventurous (you should be), pair it with an array of options ranging from artichoke, olives and other traditional antipasto fare, to delicious prosciutto or smoked salmon. Definitely also try some (or most, or all) of the 'small plates,"" but if you're only opting for one or two, settle on the Sicilian Eggplant Caponata, the Tartare di Manzo, or the deep fried mutz. Beyond that, I recently tried the sausage and pepperoni pizza (pizzas can be split by four-six people if you're tasting), and the nastrini al pesto (pasta), and loved both. You can't go wrong with dessert either - I suggest sampling a few if you're with a group (i.e flourless chocolate cake, salted caramel brittle) you won't regret it!",1,0,1,Lauren M.,"Hoboken, NJ",155,18,17

Let me repeat that - a $19 2 course prix fixe lunch.Holy Cow! And the selection is really really good!We had:- Parmigiana di Melanzane - Delicious! Sauce is sweet and savory. It is a variation of eggplant parmesan - Insulate di Soncino with Mozzarella - So good! It is a tri-colour salad with a lemon dressing. It also has almonds and avocado.- Pappardelle Ragú di Anitra e Francia - it is tagliatelle with a duck ragout. So good but the pasta as a little too al dente.- Trofie al Pesto - pesto pasta with asparagus, interesting combination and extremely good.- Pasta with butter and cheese - my daughter loved. - Pizza - my other daughter enjoyed.- The wine and cocktail the hubby and I had was delicious$68 for lunch for 4 people in a really nice Italian restaurant in Manhattan with wine/cocktails?

The check, nearly 9pm. Throughout the evening, tables came and went. Our service was poor, poor, poor with no sincere apologies. Wrong drinks were brought when they did come, confusion abound. It was as if no one knew what was going on. I've lived in New York for 16 years and never experienced anything like Obica.

I knew that the fresh mozz was a must-try, so I opted to have that on a panini with prosciutto. This is pretty much one of my favorite combos ever and the sandwich did not disappoint. There was plenty of fresh meat and cheese on the sandwich, and the bread was super crunchy and tasty. It also came with a small side salad.

The burrata was far too ""wet"" for me; generally, I like a firm outside and soft inside, but this was just soft all over (see photo), but some diners might enjoy this. The black olives they served on the side also tasted like they sat in anchovie-marinade. Finally, the soup was definitely microwaved and I didn't like the taste.

5.0,2/10/2016,"This was the first time I dined here and I can not wait to return! The atmosphere is casual-chic, high ceilings, industrial feel, yet with the modern sleek wood tables, and the exposed brick it all ties in to make it a much more inviting and sexy feel. Definitely a great date spot but I was with my friend who is an interior architect, he could not stop complimenting on the design of the place. Off to a great start we walked in at around 8:30 and we didn't have a reservation, The host checked our coats and sat us with in 5 minutes. Were welcomed by our server who was very in tune with what we wanted so she helped guide us in the right direction. She suggested a bottle of the Buio Carignano which was a good full bodied wine, great value. I must say their wine list is full of Italian wines, she mentioned there were over 90 indigenous grape varietals on the list. We wanted to share and try as many things as possible and although they have a lot of small plates I definitely wanted to try some of the entree's too. We started off with an order of Prosciutto Crudo di Parma, and Burrata with black truffles. Simply amazing, so fresh. Next we shared the Salsiccia e Peperoni pizza with bell peppers, sausage, and smoked mozzarella. This pizza just packs so much flavor, the aroma of the smoked mozzarella and bell pepper is intoxicating, and the dough is super crispy and light. For the mains we went just for the duck because we wanted to save some room for the dessert. I loved the presentation of this dish, perfectly cooked medium rare duck sautéed radicchio, blueberry balsamic reduction. Great balance of bitter and sweet. We finished off the meal with the flourless chocolate and almond cake with fior di latte gelato. The cake was moist, rich, and delicious! (I am a chocolate person.) & the pear baked in nebbiolo wine, with cinnamon gelato, again beautiful. Excellent way to finish a lovely meal. Honestly this was a great mix of authentic, fresh Italian food that you crave, and some really elegant options too if you are an eclectic group of friends. We were so happy that my friend is considering having his 35th birthday next month in the private room, and I will definitely be back.",1,0,1,B U.,"Manhattan, NY",150,22,12

4.0,2/2/2016,"Neighborhood gem. On a gloomy rainy weekday night, we walked into the restaurant, feeling welcome and cozy. The decor was modern and the ambiance was lively. We were a little worried about the wait as it looked full, but were pleasantly surprised by the size of the restaurant - while I am usually a sucker for teeny restaurants (for their quaintness), I did like the fact that I could walk in without having to wait. I had a risotto with shrimp and asparagus and hubby had a pizza - both were very good. Everything was as good as I remembered the second time we went. This time I tried a squid ink pasta (with uni and crab ragu...decadent). Pasta was cooked al dente and ingredients tasted fresh. Prices are reasonable for the area.

2.0,1/20/2016,"Good decor, good presentation, and... That's where the good ends.We sat down for a restaurant week lunch meal here and were thoroughly disappointed. Let's break it down, shall we?1) Appetizers - left a lot to be desired, but were the best part of the meal. That's saying something. We had an underseasoned squash soup as an appetizer that really left us unfulfilled. We also had grilled eggplant that lacked any flavor.2) Entrees - oh dear me.We had a pollo salad. Remember those Lunchables from grade school? Or the deli meat sitting in the bottom drawer of your fridge? Imagine six slices of those slapped on a bed of leaves from errant weeds in a back alleyway of NYC. It should not have even been called a salad. We also had a pizza with buffalo mozzarella and mushrooms. The dough was as spongy as your kitchen daily cleaner. The mushrooms were slimy blobs dipped in acid, it seems. And the sauce! Wait,was that even sauce? Looked more like red colored water to us. 3) Dessert sounded promising- a flourless chocolate cake! It seems that that same alleyway was trodden with dirt, then collected to make the ""cake"" that we had the misfortune of ordering. The gelato on top made it tolerable.All in all, a severely underwhelming experience after which we needed a drink just to cleanse our souls of what we just witnessed... And paid exorbitant prices for!Not sure if this was a startlingly subpar effort for restaurant week or an experience more indicative of the restaurant as a whole, but we suggest avoiding Obica for restaurant week.

2.0,12/23/2015,"So we found this place through Yelp after trying to get in to a packed Eataly which is a block away.  We should've looked at the prices rather than just the reviews. We were a party of 11 people (5 of them kids) so we just wanted something close that served pizza and had no wait. We called, asked the hostess a few questions and came one over to be sat immediately. My first complaint was that the bathrooms didn't have a changing table to change the baby's diaper. Where are the parents supposed to change the diaper, at the table?  Please look into that! Our waiter comes around and when asked what types of Ravioli is the special today, he doesn't know, says he'll be right back.  We receive the bread for the table, but have to ask for the bread plates and olive oil.  The waiter returned with our waters but had forgotten to ask about the special of the day.  Upon his return, he began to explain it and actually told our other friend she should listen because she asked him about it too. She responded to him that she was asking for me, not to order for herself.We order pizzas for the kids which were a bit pricey and personal sized. They came out quickly and the kids enjoyed them. I had ordered fried mozzarella but it was kid of like a breaded grilled cheese sandwich. I don't think I'd order it again.I ordered the ravioli special which was more like a tortellini with aged Parmesan cheese inside. According to the waiter, the cheese was supposed to have melted in the center of the tortellini but it seemed like it may have needed just a few more minutes to melt and be gooey.

3.0,12/13/2015,"3.5 stars. My experience started off a bit disappointing. I came here with a group of 8 for a Christmas dinner/birthday. Although we had a reservation at 7:45, a few of us showed up at 6:30, so we planned on grabbing a few drinks at the bar while we waited for the rest of our party.  There was a sign on the door saying that there was a private event until 6:45. We walked in and were told we could not go to the bar because of the event. Understandable, but then the host told us that we couldn't even wait in the front area for the remaining 15 minutes. So he made us stand outside...in the cold...while people from the event were trickling outside. In my opinion, this was not very hospitable.Once our party sat, we ordered drinks, all of which were very good. We ordered the burratta and meat plate for appetizers. The burratta was very good, but we were a bit disappointed in the antipasto plate - only 2 pieces of prosciutto and 2 slices of salami with artichokes, olives, and two pieces of bruschetta. The dish was only $17, so I guess this is expected. For entrees we ordered pizzas (good, nothing special), salads (a bit bland), and pasta (tasty, but very small portions).  I myself had the pumpkin ravioli, which was perfectly portioned, and very delicious. Overall, we had an ok experience, but nothing that stood out. The atmosphere was nice and worked well for our large party, but I would not go out of my way to recommend this restaurant.  However, I think this would be a good option if you are already around the area.",0,0,0,Lana J.,"Manhattan, NY",3,99,0

(If I am planning on spending $300 on dinner, ""dinner"" means more than food-- it means service, atmosphere, bar tending, etc.) While we wait, the waitstaff are yelling over the guests' heads to communicate to one another about God knows what. Totally unprofessional. The real kicker was when my dinner date expressed her very severe, deadly, food allergy. Due to what was perceived to be a language barrier, the manager was fetched. The MANAGER of this establishment interrupted and condescended the customer several times during the conversation. He wouldn't even hear about the allergy. His only rebuttal was a curt, ""So don't eat the pizza, I guess."" It was clear that this manager that had NO IDEA about where his products came from, how the dishes were prepared, what ingredients were being used. He relied on popular phrasing like ""in house"" or ""imported"" without being able to further elaborate in any way. Total incompetence, to a point of being downright dangerous. We decided to leave after only a single drink. This place isn't worth your time. It's shiny and big and loud and has completely lost touch with whatever quality the Obica name started with.

The food was great to say the least. I am a huge fan of the modern ambiance and it was nice and spacious on the inside. My friend and I actually ended up sitting at the Mozz Bar area because it was super busy, but it wasn't bad at all.We started off with some bread, fresh burrata, and prosciutto (savory). I must say that Obica's burrata is one of the best I have ever had, it was very soft and creamy. The prosciutto was sliced right in front of us (because we were sitting at the bar area). It was well-seasoned and very flavorful without being too salty. The combination of the three was amazing. The burrata also comes with some cherry tomatoes, olives, and some spinach. The next thing that I had was the squid ink pasta! It was topped with some uni and I must say that it was delicious. We had actually come to the restaurant because I was craving some squid ink pasta and I must say that I was thoroughly impressed. Although, the dish was a bit heavier than I expected (maybe because of the combination of the uni and the oils) it did satisfy my craving! Last but not least was the tiramisu and OH MY GOD...the tiramisu. Tiramisu is easily one of my top three favorite desserts and I think I've found one of the best. This is mainly why I will be coming back to Obica (and for the amazing burrata of course) for this heavenly tiramisu. I think they make their own lady fingers or use a different type of bread for layering the cake, but the texture is so light with the perfect balance of espresso and cream. It isn't too sweet and I could literally eat 10 if I could. I am so happy that I found this spot close to my work! The service was great and everyone was attentive and knew exactly what they were talking about. The portions are on the smaller side though so don't expect to be full if you order just an entree.

It is a joy to work with a restaurant that knows how to please customers and sometimes bend backwards to do so. from the wait staff all the way up to the general manager this restaurant is 5 stars all the way.  I bring large groups to restaurants all the time (this was actually one of my largest) and often a staff member, an owner, a manager, the kitchen...someone is 'off' making the night not as smooth as I would like it, but not at Obicà. If you are planning a nice romantic dinner date, this is ideal, if you are planning a small dinner event with a few friends, or if you are planning a dinner event for 40+ they know exactly how to please. Oh and I really didn't talk much about the food in the review, but it was all delicious.

The place is modern looking with an industrial kind of look to it, especially around the bar area. The place was also pretty packed for a Wednesday night, but our waiter was really good about the service.  He got our order in before the dinnertime rush (we had 7:30pm reservations).  The only thing that was a bit weird was that we ordered an appetizer and our main courses were definitely ready before the appetizer, so we ended up cancelling it.  To make up for it, they gave us some complimentary veggies to snack on which was a little strange but free!  We all started out with the burrata, which was melt in your mouth delicious, as expected.  I ordered the steak with my entree - just wasn't in the mood for pasta at the time so this review might not be what you're looking for.  But the steak came out looking perfectly cooked, there were only a few slices (not surprising for the restaurant week menu) but it was a good portion size nevertheless.  Each bite definitely melted in your mouth, it was cooked perfectly medium-rare. The only thing I wish was different was that the cut was pretty fatty and so it took away from some extra meat that I probably could've gotten in on.  For dessert, I got the chocolate brownie cake which was a bit dry... at least it came with some ice cream to give it some moisture.  All around, a pretty good meal but I think I'd skip dessert here.",0,0,0,Tiffany T.,"East Brunswick, NJ",5,14,1

From the moment I walked in I suspected it was going to be a bad night. I had a reservation that the hostess couldn't find ( it had been incorrectly entered in the system). She dismissed me to the bar muttering ""we'll figure something out"". When the others in my party arrived another hostess graciously took the time to search and find the reservation and apologize for the inconvenience. Great! Or so I thought. The place was crowded and we were seated pretty much in the middle of the walkway, BUT we were seated. We chatted a bit until we realized that ten minutes had passed without so much of a glass of water being brought to us. We flagged a waiter for water and assistance in finding our real waiter. Progress! He apologized and a couple of minutes later our waiter appeared.By this time, I'm beyond hungry and hopeful that the 4 start Yelp reviews are accurate. Yeah No. I order tuna tartar and the prime rib. I probably missed it in the menu, but the tuna had black olives mixed in (odd) fortunately the avocado sauce saved an otherwise OK starter.On to the prime rib with roasted potatoes and half a grilled tomato. There was equal parts fat to meat. What I did taste of the meat after cutting off the fatty parts wasn't bad but I expected better.

2.0,7/29/2015,"As we all know, there are two critical parts to any restaurant operation, the quality of the food, and the quality of the service.  I took my wife and daughter to Obica and although the quality of the food was actually very good, the service left much to be desired.  First, we entered the restaurant and were met by two hostesses who seemed incapable of smiling.  When I announced we had a reservation (we were early), I was told in almost a scolding fashion that we were early.  We asked if we could sit at the bar, and it was almost like she was thinking about if we could or couldn't, clearly something must have been on her mind.  So we take a belly table in the bar area, the table had 2 chairs, there were 3 of us, so I pulled a chair from the adjacent table so we could all sit down.  I was immediately confronted by a waiter who told me that now this empty table only had 1 chair (first of all, is this really MY problem????).  Jeeeesh, I've been inside this establishment for about 4 minutes and I'm feeling like my presence is a disservice to them.  He finally relented and asked what we wanted to drink (would have been nice if he led with this instead of berating me for wanting my entire dinner party to be seated).  A few minutes pass, no drinks (that's OK, they were pretty busy), and the hostess came and got us for our table.  I told her that we had ordered drinks, and if the server can now bring them to our dinner table?  Oh no, that we can't do.  I have to go back to the bar and pay for the drinks there, they can't add the drinks to my dinner check.  Why not?  I was told the bartenders won't get their tips that way.  Again, is this my problem????I would have liked to have spent the time writing this review talking about the menu and the food which again, was pretty good, but I was so taken back about how I was such an inconvenience to this place, I thought I'd send out a warning shot to first-timers who may read reviews before going into a place.  Your experience may differ, but this is a place that won't be seeing my shadow again.",4,0,1,Kevin C.,"Carlsbad, CA",1,92,24

We were sat a table but I'd love to sit at the bar someday. The place was very spacious for NYC and not overwhelming and packed. We were served bread- I remember there being focaccia which was phenomenal. And also olive bread if I remember correctly. We all ordered mimosas as well. I only give this place three stars because despite how delicious the food was, it was nothing to rave about. I had a margarita pizza with buffala cheese, while my mom had a panini and my dad and boyfriend had eggs Benedict. Our server was amazing and was very accommodating -my dad wanted his eggs runny while my boyfriend wanted his yolks solid.

1.0,6/18/2015,"How could a place with ""mozzarella bar"" in the title be a disappointment? Very easily, infact. My friend and I were both surprised by the fact that such a beautiful restaurant could be an utter waste of a meal. The main reasons we'll never return?1. Our waiter never seemed to be focussed on what we were saying and was always looking somewhere else. He even so much as ran past our table, knocked my chair moving it completely and didn't turn around or apologize. 2. The drinks were atrocious. And if you're paying $15 for a cocktail at a (supposedly) nice NYC restaurant - that's ridiculous to think they wouldn't be worth every penny. 3. The food was lackluster and honestly just tasted *odd.* My friend had the squash soup that needed some kind of cream or something in it since it was so bland. And I had the burrata sausage pizza, which was extremely forgettable. They blend their sausage into a ""paste"" and use that on the pizza. I love the idea of how that sounds, but the execution of it tasted awful. Even the burrata was sub-par, and I love burrata.Please take my advice and spend your money elsewhere.

For main dishes, I enjoyed and recommend the Prosciutto Crudo.One thing to note is that unlike typical restaurants that are eager to turnover tables, the services at Obico is more akin to service in Italy - a bit more leisurely pace.  If you are in a hurry, you could tell the hostess when you are seated but otherwise you are given ample time to order and enjoy your food.",0,0,0,Sydney P.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",1,15,1

I finally got there tonight for my sisters birthday and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. The service was barely existent and although it was nice to have an authentic italian waiter, he took 30 minutes to take just our drink order or offer bread to the table. Patience is not my strength, I wasn't amused. However, he was slightly redeemed by the attendant bus boys. Onto the food. We started with 3 cheeses- burrata, truffle burrata and classic bufala along with the prosciutto di Parma and the prosciutto San Daniele. They were all delicious. The burrata's were perfectly creamy and savory, the bufala just a little tangy with just the right amount of salt. Both prosciutto's melted in your mouth and complemented the cheeses well but I favored the San Daniele by a hair. The meat and cheese affair didn't stop there. For the next course we had the prosciutto pizza with bufala and arugula along with the homemade spinach lasagna. The pizza dough was thin and chewy with a nice slight char on the crust. The toppings we already know I love. Now the lasagna. The lasagna. Maybe I'm a bit of a lasagna snob maybe I'm not but wet noodles and bland red sauce with scattered ricotta and mozzarella doesn't do it for me. I like a dense slab seeping with velvety smooth bechamel and a rich beef ragu. This lasagna was the latter. You taste every ingredient individually and then they all come together in a wonderfully decadent harmonious bite. You'd think after that we'd skip dessert...false.And I'm glad we didn't!

3.0,4/25/2015,"We've walked by Obica several times, and we decided to do a weeknight dinner when we were able to get out of work earlier than usual. Getting a reservation was a cinch; when it's not the end of the week or the weekend, there's plenty of seating in the dining room or at the bar in the middle of the space. Speaking of the space - it was very nice - high ceilings, a mix of modern and rustic giving it a very cosmopolitan feel with a hint of the farm-based origins of the cheese. Service was pretty quick, if a bit inattentive (our waiter forgot to give us a cocktail menu, then subsequently forgot my order when I gave it).As for the food - we went a bit overboard on how much cheese we thought we could handle, but given it is a mozzarella bar, we had to try as much cheese as we could get our hands on! Unfortunately, it was a bit of a mixed experience - while the burrata was absolutely delicious, the buffalo mozzarella served with the caprese was clearly not the freshest and was quite rubbery in texture. The burrata had the perfect creamy strands as you pulled out each bite, and that was definitely done well. The caprese disappointed because the cheese wasn't quite fresh, and the tomatoes, while interesting (multi-colored tomatoes were sliced for it), were a bit dry as well, as the juicy center of the tomatoes were removed. The bruschetta was also a disappointment; perhaps it was my expectation what I've had in the past (freshly-cut tomatoes on bread, seasoned with olive oil and a little basil), but the pepper-covered slice was too noisy, and the slice with chorizo-infused spread tasted like eating generic paste (for lack of a better word). The big dish - prosciutto pizza - was redeeming, though. The crust had a more intense heartiness to it given it was whole wheat, but it wasn't as bland as other whole wheat pizzas I've encountered before, and the thinness of the crust was done just right - I would have only asked for the bottom to have a little bit of crispy char to it. The mozzarella on the pizza was perfectly gooey (albeit a bit clumped together), and the prosciutto was delicious. The arugula was good as well, but I always feel like there's a bit too much on these kinds of pies.In all, it was a bit of a mixed experience. I'd definitely come back, as I enjoyed the setup and decor of the restaurant, but I may also venture to some of the non-cheese plates to see how the restaurant rounds out more fully.

Decided to stop by on a Sunday afternoon and found it fairly empty which was perfect for a quiet drink with a friend over some fresh mozzarella (I take it it's there specialty) and a plate of cured meats. Didn't explore much on the menu but I wouldn't mind coming back to do so given my overall experience.,0,0,0,Jiho S.,"New York, NY",74,569,138
4.0,4/17/2015,"First went to Obica in Rome and was surprised when they said they had a resto in New York. Tried the midtown location which has better cold basics (burratas, mozzarella samplers, panini sandwiches, etc). The new-ish Flatiron location is HUGE and has the same + lots of tasty warm dishes (pastas, pizzas, and antipastis), a full bar and a long wine list. Plus the midtown location closes at 6PM while the Flatiron location closes at 11PM. If you love cheese - this place will change your life. The mozzarella is flown in twice a week from Italy, is perfectly pillowy soft, and I honestly liked it more than the Rome resto. Sorry Rome! Ciao!",1,1,1,Chrissy R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,163,208

The natural sun light is amazing and makes this place that much better. The different selections of cheeses and meats is right up my alley. I love nothing more than a good antipasto and yes, this place can serve a good antipasto. They also have great (what appear to be all homemade) fixings. The roast red peppers were delicious and accompanied the antipasto platter well. They also have pizza, Panini's, salads and pasta dishes on the menu too. When I came here, it was just for a snack. Unfortunately I didn't have an appetite to enjoy a fully meal. I would absolutely come back to dig deeper into the menu and fill my tummy with more Italian deliciousness.",1,1,1,Jennifer A.,"Lincoln Park, NJ",239,310,628

The service was attentive but not overbearing.  It took a little while to get our entrees but our reservation was at noon (exactly when they open so the kitchen may have been just warming up)  - either way it wasn't a big deal since we were there for a leisurely brunch.I am looking forward to trying Obica for dinner.  Nice addition to the neighborhood - I hope they stick around as the turnover in the space seems to be high.",1,0,1,M G.,"New York, NY",9,49,0

I dined with a culinary-type friend from NYC who hadn't heard of it and he also really liked it.The buffalo mozzarella is the highlight. It's super soft and creamy - I had plain - my friend had with truffles.We also shared a pizza as another appetizer- the crust is perfect.The pastas were delicious - papardelle with duck ragout - great! The cocktails were imaginative and the bartender fixed me a vodka-based blend that wasn't on the menu that he said was an Italian specialty - it was refreshing.The host (Lorenzo) and all the staff were really attentive and friendly.The atmosphere is casual chic - with a long brick wall and good lighting (I hate overly dark and overly bright places).This is definitely on my list to return to in NYC.,2,1,2,Mickey C.,"Charleston, SC",1,51,13

5.0,3/19/2015,"Sunday evening I went to the relatively new Obica with a couple of friends. I did not know so much about this italian restaurant but I heard from a friend of mine that it should be really good then I decided to try what he called "" the real and authentic italian pizza"". The restaurant is located in the heart of Flatiron district, on the Broadway st, between the 21st and 22nd street. A strategically location that can be considered as a meeting point between the Chelsea and Midtown area, easy to reach by walking or through the metro subway ( N, R).Once we get there we were welcomed by a courteous waitress and we were immediately, and positively, impressed by the modern and sophisticated environment that gives to that place a really good vibe.Cement, wall and wood are putted together in order to create a cutting-edge space in which people can really experience food. Obica is everything but fast food restaurant. There you have to take your time for tasting and enjoying all the goodness and the authenticity of real italian ingredients, combining them with a chalice of very well selected wine, while you are talking and chilling with your friends or whoever you want.Once we settled in, we had to think about what to order, and trust me if I say that it was an hard choice!  We were uncertain about trying just pizza or also putting in order one of the many  entrees or antipasti.At the end we opted for a pizza with prosciutto & mozzarella di bufala, a lasagna and a tasting of all of the different kind of mozzarella that Obica offers.Well, starting from the pizza. It was super! The italian sauce was amazing, the dough light and savory, the mozzarella was rich and tasty and the prosciutto tasted good. i really appreciated it!For what concerns the lasagna, it reminded me the time in which i was used to eat at my grandma house. It was entirely homemade and  besciamella-covered. It made me feel closer to my home country.Regarding the mozzarella we tried 3 different types of it: the classic, the braid, the smoked. In my personal opinion the smoked one is the best but also the other two types of mozzarella tasted really good.Beyond the food and the dishes, the staff in Obica was really kind and courteous. The treated us like princes making us feel like we were at home. The overall experience @Obica was EXCELLENT quality, GOOD service, ELEGANT and SOPHISTICATED environment.It is the perfect place for both the italian and american people that really want to try the italian tradition thought in an innovative way!",0,0,0,Federico L.,"Milan, Italy",1,3,0

The service in there is top notch, our waitress was so nice and professional. She explained everything on the menu to us, and answered any questions we had.

The steak was a nice size, and cooked perfectly (medium) but, it did have too much fat on it, and the potatoes did not taste fresh, they tasted as if they've been made and sitting under a heat lamp for until they're ready to be plated.

2.0,2/6/2015,"If you're into severely overpaying for pretty tasty food, served erratically and in miniscule portions, then Obica is most definitely your jam.  The entire concept of this restaurant, and its apparent popularity, are completely baffling to me.  This is primarily because the restaurant is almost breathtakingly overpriced for what it is -- a glorified date spot in Flatiron.To be sure, sharing is the name of the game here, with one section of the menu devoted to mozzarella charcuterie plates, of sorts, and another section devoted to pizzas.  It is possible to order mozzarella without accompaniments, but why would you order a plain ball of mozzarella with nothing to go with it?  Once you add in the accoutrements, your ball of mozzarella soars from $10 to $20.  The pizzas would be reasonably priced -- most are under $20 -- if not for the fact that each entire PIE has about as much surface area as a traditional New York SLICE.  There are also larger entrees from which to choose, and which you probably should choose if you don't want to leave Obica starving.  There is also an extensive wine list and cocktail menu, though don't expect any bargain bottles or generous pours.  Most high-end, well-established restaurants in the City -- which Obica is not -- have at least a few more accessible offerings than Obica does.The service is helpful and courteous, but the wait times for an entree, second round of drinks, and bill were troublesome.  And, given how small Obica's portions are, more direction from the waiter regarding an appropriately-sized order would have been appreciated.  Or maybe it would not have been.  Because to order a proper dinner here would require spending far in excess of what you would hope to spend for a relatively informal meal.  Therein lies the failure of Obica.  Why would anyone come here?  The only plausible reason I could think of is if you're working with an expense account and you or your clients really like mozzarella.  Otherwise, if you want a reliable date spot, go to Wined Up across the street, which offers the same quality food and drink in a relaxing setting at a much better value.  If you want a satisfying dinner at a legitimate restaurant, go around the corner to Craftbar, or to any of the many highly-acclaimed restaurants nearby if you can get in (e.g. ABC Kitchen), where you would spend about the same.  Unless and until Obica overhauls its identity, there is no reason to give it a second chance.",2,0,0,Noah X.,"New York, NY",0,27,0

5.0,1/18/2015,"My waiter was the best. He explained how specialized and sensitive the chefs are towards their cheese and noodle collection.Beginning with the burrata - I feel burrata is a New York specialty as I've never had it in San Francisco (which is where I am coming from.) This restaurant gets it delivered 2 times per week to ensure freshness. They even wait outside late into the night expecting the day's shipment. I love how they have truffles and a touch of truffle oil to boost the flavour of the cheese.I ordered the polenta with mushrooms for brunch (which comes with a mimosa -- i ordered orange juice since I'm not a fan of drinking -- and a coffee after lunch.) This has a hint of cheese in it as well so there was no need to salt the polenta. The mushrooms were DELICIOUS. Tender, flavourful, and a great hit of flavour. It also has two sunny side up eggs as an added protein.The salad that comes with the polenta brunch is light without a lot of dressing (olive oil and salt) which was delicious and makes a lot of sense with an otherwise heavy lunch.Lastly the roasted fingerling potatoes were crisp and perfectly salted. I unwisely asked for ketchup (which is something the restaurant doesn't usually carry.) Our wonderful waiter found some and even laughed with me at my embarrassment. Overall, wonderful experience!

4.0,1/3/2015,"Dining at Obica Mozzarella Bar Pizza and Cucina reminded in the most delicious possible way of the shortcomings of locavorism. It's really a testament to modern technology that sitting in a NYC restaurants thousands of miles away I can partake in mozzarella imported from Italy (twice weekly!) that has the much cherished DOP certification. (DOP = Denomination Origin Protected which in some respects is economic protectionism but in others, quite tasty...)Naysayers and green carbon footprint enthusiasts eat your bland NYC area local winter crops: Imported mozzarella wins for me any time.We stumbled upon Obica by accident en route to a different restaurant that we really didn't have much enthusiasm for and were open to other possibilities.The menu is a mix of small plates, antipasti, pasta, pizza and entrees. For those who cannot really make up their mind and want to try a representative sampling of almost everything, I recommend the Obica Experience.At $38 per person, you are able to choose your mozzarella, increase your cholesterol level through a salumi and grilled vegetables platter, spread an eggplant stew known as caponata on focaccina, indulge in slices of pizza pomodoro biologico e mozzarella and then choose from the dessert menu.Our cheese choices were bufala classica and burrata al tartufo, two loving lumps placed among a sea of salumi. I was partial to the creamier burrata but also found myself mixing the two. You can easily take a spoonful and enjoy the flavors independent of anything else or assemble your own mini sandwich with the prosciutto, speck and salami. The grilled vegetables (primarily eggplant and zucchini) were alas neglected but really suffered from no defect. Their tragic fate is having to compete for my attention next to a platter of cured meats.By the end of this first course we really could have stepped aside, paused for an hour or just called it quits based on being really full. Yet we moved on to the next round, a pizza for two that was thankfully light. A delicious sweet sauce with chunks of mozzarella floating atop a thin crust, this pizza was a pleasure to eat even while almost at capacity.Dessert was the weakest course perhaps based on my choosing something healthy. I could have had tiramisu or flourless chocolate cake but instead I foolishly went for the pineapple carpaccio. Another plus of the Obica Experience is having the entire dessert menu at your disposal.The thinly sliced pineapple was marinated in mint syrup and joined by a small scoop of lemon sorbet and pink peppercorns. I found the flavor combination of mint and peppercorn too disjointed to fully enjoy, a minor sore point in an otherwise outstanding meal.Our waiter was attentive, erudite in his explanations and enthusiastic. Tables have a respectable distance but this is unfortunately obliterated by the increasing tendency of restaurant goers to forget that this is not their private dining room. I learned far too much about the occupation, age and aspirations of the person next to us who was in all likelihood on an internet arranged date. Voice modulation seems to be a dying art because who really wouldn't want to hear everything the speaker at the next door table has to say? (Who I don't know and really don't want to know but learned about anyway)None of which is Obica's fault of course but merely another symptom of civil societal decline.I'll have another negroni (executed perfectly) to contemplate that.My future plans to visit Obica will likely consist of drinks, salumi and mozzarella. and if traveling around the world, you'll conveniently find Obicas in Italy, the UK, Japan and Dubai.",4,1,1,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",337,820,47

3.0,12/19/2014,"I like this restaurant, I really do.  I wish I could give it more stars, I do.The food is hit or miss in my opinion, when its good, like the Asparagus, fried poached egg and parmesan cheese...its really good!  When it misses that mark, its just plain average.  This was my second trip here, and when I left the first, I told myself that on the next I would order differently...and I did.  Be adventurous, cause you've got a chance to have it be worth your while.My deduction of another star is that the service, and both visits, is really just not good.  Our waiter just didn't get it to the point that it began to affect my experience.  He was pushy, stand-offish and as we had described it, bad bedside manner.  Instead of telling on him, I decided to address the situation head on, and brought the discomfort to his attention directly.  Afterwards, he was much more pleasant.  Just hated having to let it get to that point in the first place...really not my style to be so confrontational.Overall, this place is around the corner from my house so I definitely will be back.  And will make my way through the menu to determine what to, and what not to order.",0,0,0,Sarah L.,"Manhattan, NY",7,49,0

And there was no finesse in the way it was served - simply with a few cherry tomatoes and olives on the plate. Odd. They were also out of a bunch of items the night we were there and were pushing a menu labeled ""Brunch""  as their specials (we were there for dinner).

The pizza is served in a true southern Italian style.  Thin crispy crust, fresh tomato sauce and dollops of creamy mozzarella. Most authentic I've had in NYC.  Samples of some of the other main courses also yielded some quality food.  A glass of primitivo was a standard Italian table winewhich batted a touch below its 14 dollar price.I think this restaurant has some great food and if they can smooth out the service it could easily make a 5 star restaurant.",1,0,0,Evan G.,"Manhattan, NY",35,58,21

My sister recommended I order the Burrata for a lunch meeting, she lives in the building around the corner. I understand if take-away isn't their preferred method of order but trust me if the quality was equally as good in a humble format as take-out I would have happily gone there for any of the variety of dinner meetings and special occasions that come up. In fact I would have been the most loyal customer.I ordered the Burrata for takeaway. The result?I walk in and was greeted very brusquely. Strike-One: Sorry I don't dress up unless absolutely necessary. Jeans and a jacket doesn't cut it for you? Don't fit their profile of normal clientele? Expect to be judged.Buratta wasn't ready - Came back after a quick errand a cross the street. Picked it up, went home.Crust was cold, stiff, unappetizing. Spicy Sausage Spread was caustic, overbearing. The bright spot was that the Buratta was solidly creamy. Might've been better if everything else was better prepared.Did someone make this and forget about it on the counter?

5.0,10/28/2014,"For those looking for a bit of cheese heaven you can find it in the Flatiron district. We were there on Sunday for dinner. Our first stop was Obica's famous mozzarella balls (flown from Rome every week). Creamy, decadent and so good. Large enough to share, we sampled Bufala Classica, Burrata and Burrata al Tartufo (my personal favorite) . The Funghi Porcini (mushroom pizza) was next. Thin crusted with a melt in your mouth cheese topping, the pizza was amazing. We tried the risotto as well. I must say I've had better. It needed more flavor/seasoning and was missing the creaminess that makes risotto so good. But Obica came back swinging with their desert course. The tiramisu was light and delicious. Served in a bowl , we dug into its rich center with our spoons. The staff was courteous and very attentive.  And the overall ambiance was warm and unpretentious. We felt right at home.

5.0,10/18/2014,"Obica is a delightful, delicious, recent addition (3 months old as of this writing) to a neighborhood chock-a-block with Italianate wannabes.  The menu contains lots of truly authentic delicacies from 4 different flavors of mozzarella -- served in a ball btw -- to classic brunch specialities such as uovo a piacere, straciatella, polenta, speck and more.  Among my favorites was the focaccina, a simple, salted and rosemary topped flat bread reminiscent of nothing so much as the truly incredible fettunta that used to be had at the late I Copi on East 9th St as well as the caprese salad -- widely available around NYC but rarely done as well.  As a number of reviews have noted, the space is elegant, spare and soaring...Mario Battali wishes he could deliver something this appealing.  Not to mention that the staff has been hand-picked and groomed to be personable and welcoming... providing a completely different experience from the dozens of other NYC bistros where the front of the house is robotic and anything but warm and welcoming.  While I can't imagine that Tony Bourdain would do this place justice -- his acerbic and hilariously inspired BS works best in the front of the house since he rarely drills into the kitchens of his watering holes these days -- I can imagine that PBS' Mike Colamecco Real Food would be in his element in Obica's kitchen.  The food is reminiscent of nothing so much as Little Italy's Di Palo store and wine bar in its authenticity -- a spot where Colamecco's flair for local street cred was perfect in the episode devoted to that NYC classic as the heirs to the Di Palo tradition welcomed Colamecco by cracking huge wheels of Parmesan, slicing up prosciutto like it was sushi, had him making mozzarella in their basement and broke out rare bottles of wine.  Obica is solidly in this warm and inviting Mediterranean tradition...",3,0,2,Thomas B.,"New York, NY",2,52,0

We were both really impressed with this place.  For starters, we shared the Antipasto Obicà and Burrata Insalate... both were delish!  I enjoyed the antipasto more than the salad but both were really fresh, presented very nicely and tasted great.  Next we shared the Funghi Porcini Pizze (the other pizzas had toppings similar to what was in our antipaso and salad, so wanted something a little different) and the lasagne (since we thought that'd be good to share).  The pizza was cooked nicely and was very tasty... had enough mushroom on it but not to the point where it was overbearing.  The spinach lasagne also really good - noodles cooked perfectly, sauce was very tasty... and enough for us to share. We had a couple glasses of wine with our food - kept it simple with the Lombardia red. We liked it very much. Although we were pretty full, we seem to always have a hard time passing up dessert - especially when it's made in house, so we shared the tiramisu.  Omg, was definitely among the best we've ever had, along with cappuccinos, which were prepared beautifully.Our server (Erica) was super friendly and patiently explained the menu and provided nice recommendations.

The classic was good, but it wasn't much better than any other quality mozz I've had before. I know the burrata should be creamy, but this was definitely very overbearing and I didn't really enjoy it. It's definitely hard to have more than a few small tastes of it.The prosciutto crudo di parma was shaved very oddly and the edges looked ragged. It tasted fine though, but they can work on the presentation.The pappardelle was ok. The texture of the noodles was perfectly al dente, but the flavors were a bit off, maybe it was bitter from too much orange rind.Overall, it's pricey for what you get.

Right from the get go my girlfriend and and I were greeted by the very charming staff and given ample time to review the extensive wine list. Not knowing a lot about wine, our server, Lance, threw on his reading glasses and helped us pick out what my girlfriend described as the perfect compliment to our meal (My blue-collar palette only cared that the wine was delicious). Lance was further helpful in recommending what he felt were must-haves, but was incredibly friendly and never pushy. We started with the house burrata, a meat and cheese plate, and a large serving of complimentary bread that, unfortunately, was eaten almost immediately as it hit the table several minutes prior to the other items.For entrees, she had a ravioli special of the night. I had the lamb chops that were cooked to perfection. We split two desserts: a flour-less chocolate cake and a semifreddo. We absolutely hated ourselves but it was so, so worth it. Things to note about all courses: items were spaced out perfectly and we were never left wondering where the heck our food was. But at the same time, we were given enough time to enjoy everything ordered. It was a perfect balance that I think is worth mentioning.The location itself is very trendy and upscale, but doesn't come off as pretentious. The layout of the restaurant is spacious enough where getting up from my seat, I wasn't worried about bumping into the table next to me. Due to my broad backside, this happens all too often elsewhere. I have read a few complaints about the noise, but honestly at 8:00pm on a Saturday, the noise level seemed average... It was definitely an energetic atmosphere, but I never found myself struggling to hear the server or my girlfriend.To sum up, I will absolutely be visiting Obica again.

2.0,8/28/2014,"Disappointing and not at all worth the cost. We went for dinner on a Wednesday night and were greeted by friendly and helpful hosts. Restaurant is a big, beautiful space but surprisingly very warm and loud inside; we could barely have a conversation without shouting. From the beginning, waitstaff seemed totally confused, bringing wrong items to different tables, wrong menus, waiters overlapping service areas, etc. Just disorganized, and since this place is new I didn't expect it to be perfect but the level of confusion among staff was almost comic (but at ~$60 per person for a light meal, really not that funny). As for the food, we ordered the burrata, prosciutto, and anchovies to start. The prosciutto was very good, but not better than any other restaurants in the area. The burrata was lacking for me - it had a nice texture but that's about it, really it tasted quite bland and watered down, needed a bit of salt. The burrata at Beecher's down the street is world's better, and for the same price, comes with a beautiful full salad. Anchovies were meh - $8 for 5 anchovies next to some sun dried tomatoes. We split the caprese salad and the pizza with mozz, broccoli rabe, and sausage. Again, nothing to write home about; everything was very bland and really lacking in seasoning (there was no trace of salt on anything we ate). For a mozzarella bar, I expect the mozzarella to be as good, if not better, than other restaurants in the area, and this just doesn't come close.

Love the location as used to go there when it was the previous restaurant and was very excited to see the new Mozzarella Bar there. We were greeted by very nice hostess and sat at the bar for a cocktail before dinner. My date asked for Kettle one vodka in a martini glass with olives and a side of ice. It took three bar tenders to get this drink right and understand what to serve. Unreal.  When our other guests arrived we sat for dinner. The place began to fill up and the crowd was so noisy we could barely hear ourselves talk across the table. Not sure why this place was so loud but definitely not a pleasant dining experience having to scream across the table to each other.  The waiter was just ok..did not explain anything about the menu or as others have commented on how nice their waiters were, we did not have this experience.  We ordered appetizers, one person the burrata, the other the eggplant (both just ok) and the last two of us both ordered the Caprese salad. One of us has a black pepper allergy and specifically asked the waiter to make sure there was no black pepper on it.  He said it did not come with black pepper.  Needless to say when our appetizers arrived, both Caprese salads were covered in black pepper.We had to send one back and it took them 15 minutes to make s new one.  The other three people were completely finished with their appetizers when the re made salad arrived. Unacceptable especially since it was salad! nothing had to be cooked!  We told them to cancel it as too late and in fact a second later our main dishes arrived.  Again, all just ok. I ordered the Black cod which was cold and in fact the fish was under-cooked.  Someone else had pizza...nothing to write home about and the other two had chicken.  The manager/owner came by to apologize for the mistake with the salad and said he would buy us a round of drinks, which was very nice of him. The waiter also apologized as I'm sure it was the kitchen's fault not his.  But the bill comes and not only did they charge us for both caprese salads but they comped only two drinks, again at least that was appreciated, but we had to send bill back to be adjusted to have 2nd caprese taken off.  Not sure I would return unless only for drinks as the food and service was very disappointing.",2,0,0,Cara C.,"Manhattan, NY",28,9,0

5.0,8/15/2014,"Simply a wonderful dining experience.  I now need my fix of their mozzarella..  Truly incredible.We went there as a group of friends, and shared many entrees.  Every pasta was top-notch.  The ribeye was tender and flavorful.  The wine list is varied, and the staff knowledgeable.Our only complaint was the volume of the music that was playing in the background.  Way, way, way too loud.  Obica is a premium dining experience that is brought down by high-decibel, mediocre music.The noise level at Obica is sometimes deafening.  I believe that's because people have to scream over the music, to be heard by their table-mates.  Unfortunate to be sure.Getting back to the staff...everybody was warm, gracious, knowledgeable and professional.  Barby, the GM stopped by our table twice, to make sure everything was up to snuff.  She even made some terrific food and wine suggestions.  We dine out a lot in Manhattan, and that type of personal attentional from a GM is almost unheard of.  Thanks Barby!To cap this, the location of Obica can't be beat.  The stretch of Broadway between 23rd Street and 17th Street has become a tidy little village.  I would have to say that Obica and Maison Keyser are the gems on Flatiron Broadway.",0,0,0,Hoppy J.,"Manhattan, NY",39,124,29
5.0,8/15/2014,"I had dinner on Wednesday night with my husband and two teenage children.  My daughter had eaten here while attending a college program and insisted that we had to try it and she was right.Gustavo was a waiter and he was fantastic.  He explained the menu to us and gave us some very good suggestions.We had the burrata mozzarella, antiipasta and caponata and everything was delicious.  We also had the pasta with duck ragu, lasagna, organic chicken and the veal dish.  Everything was outstanding.  Desserts and drinks were wonderful as well.I will definitely be back and hopefully has Gustavo as a waiter again",0,0,0,Donna G.,"Staten Island, NY",6,27,3
4.0,8/10/2014,"I read about this new location a few weeks ago and just had to come try it! We were greeted by a friendly host and hostess and promptly seated next to the mozzarella bar. Our waiter was also very friendly and informative, as he explained more about the wine-cured aged pork and how it's not technically a prosciutto, but very similar. The manager stopped by our table multiples times to see how we were doing. I even chatted him up to ask more about burrata. Obviously, the service here is fantastic!We ordered the burrata with the wine-aged cured pork. So...freakin...delicious!!! The burrata was nearly all cream inside, perfect for schmearing on the pork. Could not have asked for a better appetizer!Also ordered the rosemary pappardelle with duck ragu and orange zest. The pasta was al dente (maybe just a tad too much). The orange zest was a unique garnish that cut the ragu sauce just right.For dessert, our waiter recommended the ricotta di bufala cream with candied orange peel, honey, and pine nuts. It was an incredibly rich dessert, well-balanced with the orange peel. And... I think there were golden raisins on the bottom too!Great service, delicious food, and a beautiful space for this restaurant. I wish I could give it 5 stars, but I will have to save that when I come back to try the pizza...",0,0,0,Olivia L.,"New York, NY",139,70,50
5.0,8/4/2014,"My new favorite place for lunch/dinner in Flatiron!  Service is VERY fast - if you are in a hurry, this is the place for you.  From a food perspective, they really tend to focus on the quality of ingredients.  The mozzarella and burrata were creamy and delicious.  The fried appetizers were surprisingly light.  The pizza, thin and crispy with some chewiness, is not neopolitan style but is still very good.  I loved the n'duja and burrata pizza - messy to eat, but it had lots of great porky, fatty goodness.  The pasta dish we tried with bottarga, sea urchin and crab was flavorful and the fresh pasta had a wonderful texture. The wines were also great, although I though the Aperol Spritz tasted a little watered down.I will return!",0,0,1,Velina L.,"New York, NY",283,558,9
4.0,8/4/2014,"Obika (or Obica here now) has always been a trusted source of good mozzarella in Italy and this NYC outpost is no exception! As they import all of their cheeses directly from Italy, it is the reason I decided to pay a visit to this new location. Our party of 8 ordered the burrata and burrata al tartufo (w/ truffle oil!) to share and the quality of cheese was AMAZING as expected. Truffle was heavenly and brought back vivid memories of its fresh taste I had in Italy. Sunday night artichoke risotto special was wonderful, pizzas are handmade thick crusts which my friends enjoyed. Trofie w/ pesto tasted original just like in Italy, risotto con scampi came with an excellent raw shrimp in an impressive plate display (aka prawn head). In general, the food quality here definitely does not disappoint. However, my only gripe is with the small portions - a tiny plate of prosciutto for $9 and 6-8 slices of salami for $7 were hard to justify.The restaurant space is quite large and airy with an extensive wine selection. I was very impressed by the decor but still wished that the dishes were more ""Italian portions"" to echo the authenticity of this restaurant. I will still be glad to return and recommend this place to anyone who is a burrata lover!",1,0,0,Jess C.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,87,0

5.0,7/24/2014,"Food is on point. Mozzarella is fresh and nothing like you've ever had, unless you have been in Italy (and I have!). I sampled the pizza and the dough/sauce combo with the mozzarella is great! As my lunch I had the Bufala e Prosciutto - Mozzarella di Bufala, Prosciutto Crudo di Parma on Ciabatta for $14 and it was delish. I will be honest at $14 you are paying for quality more than quantity, but I found that it did fill me up and I didnt leave hungry.",2,0,0,Lou C.,"New York, NY",165,104,140
