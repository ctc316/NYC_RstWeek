5.0,4/28/2019,"Just plain WOW. From the start to the finish. King crab and in season Halibut followed by Butter Cake. Nuff ssid.Our server Joshua was simply unbelievable, his level of knowledge on wines alone was mind boggling. We showed him a picture of a wine we had on a recent Cruise and he steered us to one that out did it. And it wasn't one of the high on the list ones either.We will be back when in the city again",0,0,0,Bob H.,"Manassas, VA",40,21,9
5.0,4/27/2019,"Awesome seafood. Awesome service. Table for 6 and we got in and out (skipped dessert -too full) in an hour ...they asked if we had a show to get to and took care of us without us feeling rushed. Seafood tower appetizer was fresh tasting and NO work....lump crabmeat, shrimp cocktail, king crab claws, lobster claws, raw oysters on half-shell and all the trimmings. It was so good all 6 of us, including two diehard carnivores, ordered seafood. Crab cakes were light with no filling however I should have only ordered one they were so big. Deceiving look at first because formed in a perfect circle, but crisp on the outside ...necessary to cook in a round tin because there is no breading (no chunks of onions or peppers either to distract from the crab flavor). Scallops were raved about. One ordered the grouper and was very pleased. Two Ordered Sushi for dinner.....the ahi tuna roll was delicious.The place was packed, yet we could still hear ourselves talk. Warm, dark atmosphere, good for dinner dates.",0,0,0,Briana W.,"Foxborough, MA",16,430,147

I came here for restaurant week for dinner and got:- calamari- filet mignon- chocolate dessertEverything was super great, but we had a reservation and had to wait 45 minutes for our table and that's why I'm not giving it 5 stars.

3.0,4/14/2019,"My fiancée and I celebrated our anniversary dinner here and it was a tremendous disappointment. While I'm glad to see everyone else's very positive reviews (which we based our reservation on), I'm simultaneously envious because we had such a letdown of an evening. We started with an order of steak tartar ($22) and shared the sea bass ($55) and rib eye ($62), along with a side of button mushrooms ($15).The food was a mixed bag for us, but before we even get there, I think the main issue of the night was the quality of service. We arrived at 7:05 for our 7:00 reservation, but our orders weren't taken until 7:25. We literally sat there for 20 minutes, watching other people get their orders taken and having food delivered. In retrospect, I guess we should have asked a waiter for assistance, but we were being patient at the time and figured the restaurant was just slammed. Finally, the food hit our table at 7:48.This trend of lethargy and inattentiveness would continue throughout the evening: they put the appetizer in front of her instead of in between us to share; we asked for more crostini for our appetizer and it took at least 10 minutes to come; after putting in our orders, our waiter came back to me and asked how I wanted my steak cooked despite having already mentioned it; lemons for our water took so long to come that we considered whether the wait staff forgot about them; and, when we asked to have our food boxed up at the end of the night, we were handed a plastic box and simply did it ourselves. (I don't have an issue with the boxing up, per se, but it's a bit difficult to imagine that other places would do the same and also charge $55 and $62 for entrees.)Now that that's out of the way... the food was mostly delicious. We were quite disappointed with the bread (neither the bread nor butter had any flavor; it tasted like it needed salt) so that was a bad start, but the steak tartar was great. We loved the balance of salty and savory. While the tartar was very good, the crostini that we paired it with was strange... one side was crispy and scrumptious, but the other side wasn't baked at all. It created a very strange and dissatisfying effect.The steak, too, was on the underwhelming side. The first bite was amazing -- it had a great, flavorful crust -- but as the meal went on it just tasted more and more medium and not medium rare. It looked medium rare... but it tasted very tough. Not sure how to explain that one, and not worth $62.On the other hand, the sea bass was divine; it was literally the best sea bass we had ever tasted. Perfectly silky smooth. We didn't love the truffle flavor, and I personally thought that the mashed potatoes detracted from the sea bass itself, but aside from that we loved the dish. Portion size wasn't great, but it was delicious and totally worth every penny. Finally, the button mushrooms were also very good. $15 is a bit steep for mushrooms, but it comes with the territory.Overall... completely let down. I expected excellent service to match the price tags but didn't get any of that. I don't know if it's because we were seated in the upper level and away from the main floor, or because the place was totally slammed (though it didn't seem like it because the wait staff weren't running around), or if that's just how the restaurant operates. Food was good, but the service was abysmal.",2,1,2,Derek Y.,"New York, NY",105,347,721
2.0,4/12/2019,"I would like to thank the bozo bartender for insulting me Jan 29th at 6pm with misinformation about being able to transfer a 300.00 tab from the bar to the dining room. Same for the male host with the long curls who also had the wrong information and backed up the greedy bartender. They both insisted I had to pay up and could not add to the dining room bill.Thank god for the ONE Manager with a brain who finally handled the issue professionally. When the GM ""sommelier"" came to our table (of 8 people)  to welcome us, I wondered what he would have done in this situation back in the bar. Food was good, but I had a bad taste in my mouth from the bartender situation and reminds me that only the best restaurants know how to execute service in every corner, in every interaction.",0,0,0,Lucy R.,"Miami, FL",0,183,14
4.0,4/8/2019,"Came here for my birthday 11/2018....Had an absolutely wonderful dinner. Service was great and food was delicious. Buuuut....seeing some ppl dining in basketball jerseys & jeans while myself and my date were dressed up, was a bit disappointing. I understand this might not be a restaurant of a certain caliber and don't think that a suit jacket should be mandatory, but there should be a line somewhere. Business casual perhaps? Not the biggest deal but something i noticed. We had a late reservation so maybe that had something to do with it. We mentioned it to the waiter (which was amazing btw) and he said it's not like that during the week etc. i would also like to point out that the lady next to us didn't get her steak cooked correctly so they had to send it back. The chef sent complimentary champagne and comped her meal. That's outstanding service and how to handle a mishap! They had birthday confetti on the table which i thought was beyond cute and received a dessert w/happy birthday chocolate. Also, there are private rooms here for special occasions and an awesome wine bottle wall for IG-worthy pics ;-) I'll be back Ocean Prime",0,0,0,Christine P.,"MASPETH, NY",74,158,3
5.0,4/7/2019,"Phenomenal!After searching for eateries in the general area, I came upon this place based off reviews, the menu, and comfortable seating (meaning it's not a typical Manhattan restaurant where everyone is on top of each other). I do not regret choosing this place.I made a reservation and once we got in, were seated right away.  Everyone from the front to the waitress to the manager making rounds asking us how we were to the guy filling up the waters were simply outstanding all across the board. I mean, there is friendly service and then there's here. A lot of places need to learn from this location. We opted for the booth on the floor level, but next time we'll try upstairs with the ""view"". The place overall is comfortable and clean - the decor is great and welcoming. The menu is simple, but offers enough variety. It's called ""Ocean Prime"", so while seafood is the main event here, there are options like steak/filet mignon as well. The wine/cocktail list is pretty varied as well.We both ordered the lobster bisque. I've never had a better lobster bisque anywhere. They even came with the bowl showing the lobster inside before pouring the bisque. I would come here just for the bisque. It was that good. I tell you, if you enjoy lobster bisque, try this one - you won't regret it. I ordered the two lobster tails, which were excellent. My companion ordered the scallops with risotto (I had a taste - excellent). The portions were enough and satisfying - and cooked perfectly. The desserts were also outstanding. The cheesecake was perfect and the creme brulee was superb. Definitely recommended to all and of course I will be coming back for sure.",10,3,8,Matt F.,"Yonkers, NY",69,524,911
4.0,4/5/2019,"Wanting to give my bf a fancy dinner out for his birthday, I asked around and was recommended to come here by a few friends. I made a reservation on open table and commented it was his birthday. I was pleasantly surprised when we showed up for the reservation and there were little birthday decorations on the table. Attention to detail, A+! Everything I ate and drank was amazing. Started with the ""surf & turf"" scallops & slow braised rib appetizer and literally feel like I'll never have anything that good again. Lol. It was to die for. My bf had the surf & turf for dinner and I had the crab cakes. Everything was exceptional! We were full but ordered the cheesecake and were surprised with an extra dessert - the warm butter cake - to celebrate my bf's birthday. Overall my meal was a 5/5. I took away one star because after we were seated, our server did take quite a long time to take our order/get our initial drinks but other than that, service was amazing.",0,0,0,Eunice M.,"Bay Shore, NY",23,8,3
4.0,4/3/2019,"Five stars for the food. We tried the sea scallops and ribeye, both were very good. The food came out pretty quickly as well. Took one star off because our waiter was not attentive at all - We had to grab other waiters and managers passing by our table to place order and ask for check, because our waiter did not check on us. I'm not sure if it was because we didn't order wine, but I was not happy with the service.",0,0,0,Jen X.,"Bethlehem, PA",19,44,1
5.0,4/2/2019,"Trying to fill our 5-year anniversary weekend with all kinds of things to do, I remember walking past an Ocean Prime in NY and thinking dinner at Ocean Prime would be the perfect way to end the weekend with a bang! Even though we reserved online a day before the dinner, there were still so many times available! This was such a pleasant surprise for us. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation and it seemed like every employee of Ocean Prime happily greeted us with ""Happy Anniversary""! It was lovely and seemed so genuine! We were given an intimate booth in the back - how thoughtful of Ocean Prime! We started off with the Berries and Bubbles cocktail as well as ordered the surf 'n' turf and Chilean Sea Bass for our entrees. We even ordered the peanut butter and chocolate pie as dessert! The Berries and Bubbles cocktail was beautifully presented! When poured into the glass, a airy dry smoke ethereally filled the glass, creating a mysterious ""dry smoke"" around the drink. Even a few minutes later after the smoke disappeared, the drink stayed bubbling, like a pretty purple potion. One sip in and the cocktail tasted basically like a berry juice! The Berries and Bubbles cocktail is very sweet and easy to drink. So if you need something easy to drink, this is the one! The main stars of the surf 'n' turf entree were the 8-ounce filet, cooked at medium rare per our choice, as well as some lobster poached in butter. Although I wish there were more lobster provided, given the expensive price, it was delicious and soft! There wasn't much of an exploding flavor when the lobster was eaten by itself, but when it was mixed with the sauce of the steak, then it became much more flavorful. The steak was also quite flavorful and paired well with the vegetables. The meal also came with a potato cake, which was a bit salty. It reminded me of eating a very soft Pringle. I had to douse the saltiness down with water with each bite, although I still loved the taste. The Chilean Sea Bass was like entering fish heaven! I loved the crispiness at the top, but the inner portions of the sea bass were extremely soft. This fish cloud was floating upon some whipped potatoes - also very soft and delicate. The dish stated there was champagne sauce, but it was difficult for me to taste it. When the peanut butter chocolate pie came over, we were pleasantly surprised to see a little candle as well as a piece of milk chocolate stating ""Happy Anniversary""! It was a nice and delicate little touch to add onto our wonderful night here. I was pleasantly shocked to see the pie looked more like a Chocolate Moon Pie as opposed to the stereotypical triangular slice. One fork in, and we noticed how the chocolate and peanut butter beautifully mixed together - chocolate ganache coating on the outside, peanut butter mousse on the inside. It was the perfect amount of sweetness! After a long dinner course, we eventually were defeated by this large and tasty peanut butter chocolate pie. What a wonderful way to celebrate such a momentous occasion! If you have any special occasions coming up, make sure to come down to Ocean Prime to help you celebrate! You will be treating yourselves to quality service and wonderful food!",0,0,0,Liselle L.,"New York, NY",329,188,334

Zesty and flavorful- really pleasing for your taste buds. The Chilean sea bass was so tasty. Cooked perfectly to be soft but flaky. The texture was incredible.

It was my first time here and I have been talking about it since I've been there.I'm usually against ""high-end"" restaurant cocktails, because the drinks are either mixed terribly or you can't test the alcohol and feel like you're getting ripped off. I had the berries and bubbles (I may have the name incorrectly) and it was amazing! I was hesitant on getting it because I drink dark and the drink contains vodka. I asked Rachel for a her recommendation on a sweet white wine, she told me Moscato but still recommend the drink I had if I was interested in a sweet cocktail option. I ended up ordering two! My boyfriend swears by Ruth Chris steakhouse's steak and claims nowhere beat there yet, but guess who did?!! Ocean Prime!!! He was sold from the time he had the calamari.

I found my love for Ocean Prime at their Boston location. I loved it so much that when I found out that NYC also had a restaurant, I needed to check it out ASAP. I loved this location just as much as Boston. A few fan favorites of the evening, all the fresh oysters, yum yum yum. The sonoma goat cheese raviolis, had these in Boston as well and just had to have them again. For the first time I actually ordered a steak at Ocean Prime, the filet and if I remember correctly, it was cooked to perfection and had great flavor.They do allow you to BYO for a corkage fee, which I cannot recall the price....but regardless, it is going to be cheaper!Ocean Prime, I now have love for you in NYC as well.",3,2,2,Jennifer A.,"Lincoln Park, NJ",239,310,628

5.0,1/20/2019,I would highly recommend this restaurant. I was in town for a special occasion and brought my nephew to the restaurant. Danielle was very attentive and helpful in making sure the food was acceptable to my nephew's food allergies (peanut and egg). She also made sure I was aware my meal included egg so as to not let my nephew try a bite. She never made me or my nephew feel like the extra questions were a burden. Our meals were delicious and the service was excellent. I will gladly come back the next time we are in town and will recommend the restaurant to friends and family.  Thank you for a wonderful experience!,0,0,0,Mis M.,"Evesham Township, NJ",1,8,0
5.0,1/19/2019,"My wife and I have been to Ocean Prime twice previously. We felt that Ocean Prime was good, but not necessarily special, a safe bet. This week we brought another couple with us to  the restaurant to celebrate a night on the town with dinner and a performance at Lincoln Center. On this occasion Ocean Prime transcended from a safe bet to being spectacular. Everything came together to create a magical dining experience. I'm not sure if there is a new chef in the kitchen since we were last here, but every course was a gourmand's delight; from the appetizers to desserts, exquisite! As satisfying as the food was, what elevated the experience was the personalities and professionalism of the wait staff team. They worked seamlessly together in creating an environment that was enjoyable and memorable. My only regret is that I failed to get their names so that I could properly highlight them in this review.

5.0,1/18/2019,"Among the best dining experiences I've had. Food service and atmosphere all exceptional and that's a word I do not use lightly. I was solo in NYC, figuratively starving, and looking for an indulgent steak dinner. After a yelp search I chose this play for the proximity to my hotel and the high rating on yelp. Front desk was wonderful. Everyone I passed on the way to the table greeted me. My server Gus was the kind of steakhouse server you imagine. Ordered the house Old Fashioned, made with Aperol, which was terrific. A six ounce filet, baked potato, and the broccoli cauliflower side made for an ... exceptional ... meal. Delicious bread rounded it out. As I was finishing the dining manager came by to ask if everything was to my liking. Needless to say I had only good things to say. I was looking for a great steak dinner and this place exceeded my expectations. I'll be back",2,0,1,Bobby C.,"San Diego, CA",1,38,3

Taking advantage of their pre-show menu, We were delighted at the quality of the food and prompt service, not to mention the very affordable pricing. I went with the fillet, French onion soup, and mashed potatoes as a side. The serving sizes We're very generous and sides were very shareable. I was blown away with the level of service we received. This was our first experience at Ocean prime, and I am excited to come back and try it again in the future.

5.0,1/3/2019,Simply excellent. The service is superb. Everything we ordered was spectacular. Dutch harbor king crab legs was extremely fresh and delicious (although came a little bit too frozen). Lobster bisque was very flavorful. One person in our group got twin lobster tails - both the asparagus and the lobster was perfectly cooked. I got the Surf & Turf - the filet was very juicy and delicious but the lobster was even more divine. The carrot cake was quite good too but tasted a little too sweet for me. The chocolate cake was not light but it was also delicious. This restaurant is one of my favorite restaurants to celebrate!,0,0,0,Secil A.,"Manhattan, NY",665,190,270
4.0,1/3/2019,"We came to Ocean Prime back on the first week of December to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. We did not have a reservation, and a lot of companies were having their holiday parties in multiple steakhouses so we were lucky to have ate here. I told the hostess I did not have a reservation and told me I would have to wait at least 40 mins but at least it was not a no- so we waited by the bar, got a drink and within 15 mins, we got seated! We sat on the upper level outside a larger party room and the level where the bathroom was- despite all the people walking back and forth, I didn't mind it. It was still more quiet than the main dining room. I was pretty hungry so I was ready to order- for appetizer we got a surf n turf to share which came with two seared scallops, braised short ribs and mashed potatoes. It was pretttty good. For mains, my boyfriend got the surf n turf which comes with lobster tail, 8 oz filet mignon and some sides. I wanted ribeye and decided to get 16 oz which I couldnt finish. My ribeye was pretty delicious- I asked for medium and I ate close to half before I started feeling full. The surf n turf I think is where I'd take a star away- the lobster tail was taken off the shell and looked unappetizing. Taste I guess was okay but for something so costly, I'd imagine the presentation to be as nice as possible as well. For the sides, we had creamed spinach and the texture of this was not what I am used to. It was less creamy than what I had in the past but it wasn't bad. Probably won't order this again but it was nice to try. We also got a side of truffle fries which was pretty good. Overall, the food was pretty decent. Service was okay. This restaurant is definitely on the expensive side but considering the location (rockerfeller) it was worth the experience and try.",1,0,1,Suki C.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,142,314

We shared the Ocean Prime House Salad which was fresh and light; great start to any meal. I had the 6 oz. filet mignon and my fiancée had the blackened snapper. My meat was perfectly cooked medium and so tender the knife barely needed any pressure. The snapper dish was surprisingly much more flavorful than either of us expected. It was superb. We shared a basket of thickish truffle fries and those were great as well. We finished off with their generously sized creme brulee; probably one of the best I ever had.We'll definitely be back.

4.0,12/16/2018,"Yes, delicious, perfect service, lovely setting, blah, blah, just like everyone else said.Gave it four stars because those sneaky devils don't give you the theater prix fixe unless you ask for it.  Once I asked, they politely provided it.That menu (google it online) is the biggest bargain in the city for $65pp (for example, the 8 oz filet if ordered a la carte would be $53 alone).  I really felt bad for the tourists and those ""outer borough (or Long Island), coming to NYC to see the windows, or a show, once every few years, big day in NYC"" amateurs who were spending a needless fortune for what I was paying a fraction for.  Felt really sad...Anyway, if not for the prix fixe I would never have eaten here.  The prix fixe only lasts until 6pm and so here's a rule for you to live by when dining after 6pm - never, never, eat in a chain when you are in a big glamorous city like NYC (unless you're invited on a business dinner or as a guest at a party).  I don't care if it is Ruth Chris, Ocean Prime, whatever.  There are famous, wonderful restaurants that are unique to each city.  We live in the age of Google.  Do a tiny bit of research and find one of them.  The only time to eat in a chain is if you are eating in the original restaurant (e.g. the Morton's of Chicago, Del Frisco's in Dallas, etc)Also, never eat anything but breakfast at the hotel for the same reason.  Experience the city you are in, don't be lazy.  I worked with a guy who brought his wife to NYC for the first time (they were in their early 60s) and raved about the steak dinner at Del Frisco's.  I'm sure it was delicious and I was polite, but I thought to myself -- we have Gallaghers, the Old Homestead, Keen's, etc, and of course Peter Lugar.  Why oh why would you spend your one big night at a chain from out of state you dumb bastid?",1,1,0,Joe T.,"Manhattan, NY",5,97,4

The food was extremely sub par for the price, the mashed potatoes taste like instant mash and the lobster tastes like it comes from a can. Maybe service was busy, but they seemed like they were in a rush to leave you at your table, no eye contact, no acknowledgement, they had to replace silverware that was encrusted with old food (stuck to the fabric napkin it was rolled in) and when they brought the replacement silverware they just dropped in on the table. But the bread and the decor was actually pretty decent. When we brought concerns to the manager he did own up and offered to fix everything. The service from that perspective was phenomenal.

3.0,10/4/2018,"Beautiful restaurant and well thought out wine list. But the fun stops there. The friendly host sat us at a perfect table in the lounge area promptly as we arrived early for our reservation. We then met our server, which may have doubled as a space cadet in her off time. 25 minutes later we were able to give our drink order, which came out incorrect. Enjoyed the delicious tuna roll, but after the first bites of the lobster roll all we tasted was ripe and hot serrano in every bite we took of everything. Whomever advised the chef to use serranos with a fresh lobster tail is well... Crazy. Could have used imitation crab meat at this point. Steak had no sear. (1200 degrees?) Baby underwhelming twin lobster tails. Salty... Very salty creamed spinach. Not sure why bacon was in the description. Maybe they sweat the shallots in bacon fat? We ended up going somewhere else for dessert.Not sure if the 'lounge area' is just more relaxed than the dining room as far as service. But we paid the same $400 in the end.  No chance id recommend this place.",2,5,1,Adam Cory O.,"ASTORIA, NY",560,97,22

Our experience began and ended with a old fashion, which might I add was super duper on point. My boyfriend and I ordered the 12 oz filet and the surf n' turf respectively. Both were incredible. The Bordeaux was on point as well.

5.0,9/24/2018,"I came here with a friend during Restaurant Week and was very impressed. We started at the bar and each had a cocktail (Elderflower was $17 and very refreshing, Gimlet was $16 and my friend loved hers.) The bar area was full of professionals after work and was a nice scene. We were promptly seated for our 6:30 reservation. The service was great. Attentive servers, but you don't feel like they're breathing down your neck. For restaurant week, we had a 3 course dinner for $42! I started with the lobster bisque, had the filet (medium) and had the carrot cake for dessert. The lobster bisque was incredible with tons of big chunks of lobster inside it. My filet was cooked perfectly and seasoned nicely. I was not a fan of the side they were serving with the filet and asked for steamed broccoli and they were accommodating. The carrot cake was delish, although next time I would try the warm butter cake, which is what my friend got. She also had the lobster bisque but got a salmon dish and then butter cake for dessert. We were both very happy with our selections and cannot wait to come back. *They have a ""theatre menu"" that has pretty much the restaurant week selections at $65 every day of the week until 6:30pm, or Sunday all day. I will definitely be back for that.",0,0,0,J K.,"New York, NY",4,164,95
4.0,9/17/2018,"Easily the best scallops I've had in terms of flavor and freshness.  But we found shells in 2 of the 4.  Rather large pieces.  The risotto was good and creamy.  Maybe a tad too mild in flavor for me.  Some shiitake mushrooms would have been perfect to add in.  The fresh herbs on top looked pretty but I wouldnt recommend eating them with the dish.  The celery pieces were a bit bitter and surprising when you get a mouth full.    The filet was cooked decent but lacking the wow factor that I've had at other restaurants.  I'd prefer a bit more char for my taste and some more pepper.The sourdough bread is outstanding!  Great flavor and density.  I liked their butter served whipped instead of a frozen block like many other places.We ordered the bacon creamed spinach but didnt eat it. The flavors didnt make sense to me and I was overpowered with a smokey bacon flavor instead of an savory creamy taste.Lastly, our server Camille was awesome!  She persuaded us to customize every dish the way we wanted and was super friendly and explained all the specials clearly.  It felt like she really cared about us and wanted us to enjoy our meal to the fullest extent possible.",1,0,1,Leo S.,"Saint Louis, MO",16,169,53

They really added a lot to our dinning experience. They were also very conscientious of our time constraints to get to our play on time. They offered a theatre menu that was amazing with a lot of unique and delicious options. The entrees were all the same size as the regular menu options which provided a lot of food. We did not leave hungry. The pre fixie theatre menu came with three courses. For our first course, we had a Caesar salad and French onion soup. Both classic items and prepared in the traditional way. Again, pretty large potions and we weren't able to finish it all without ruining our appetite for dinner. For the main entrees, we had twin lobster tails with sea scallops and mashed potatoes. And an 8oz filet with sea scallops and truffle Mac and cheese. The sea scallops were cooked to perfection with no grit in them. The steak was also perfectly cooked to the temperature we had asked. The lobster was also a large portion and cooked great as well. If you like truffle, you would love the truffle Mac and cheese. I could only have a few bites because it is so rich but it is just divine. For dessert, we tried both options available to us. The butter cake with vanilla ice cream and fresh berries and the peanut butter pie. Again, both decadent desserts and very rich. We couldn't finish them but trust me I tried. We took all our leftovers to go and I can't wait to eat them tomorrow.

When we got to the table, we saw heart confetti on it which I thought was such a nice gesture. It created an atmosphere for us amongst all the people at the restaurant. It was super busy on a Tuesday night. Food was great. My boyfriend and I enjoyed everything from start to finish. Lobster bisque was creamy, flavorful, and had a few chunks of lobster. Calamari was crispy and sweet with a pleasant kick to it. Filet mignon (8 oz) was perfection and my boyfriend seemed to really enjoy his salmon. We had smiles all the way through dinner. Only sad point was when I was too full to finish the dessert - butter cake. I could only eat half of it. The ice cream was delicious - extremely smooth and creamy, and not too sweet.

4.0,8/26/2018,"Ocean Prime was a wonderful Restaurant Week find, where we got to try some seafood, steak and delicious wine!  I will admit...dinner started out a bit rough.  Front of the house seemed frazzled and disorganized.  We arrived early, however we didn't get seated until 15 minutes after our scheduled reservation.  After we were called, the hostess walked us over to a table, only to realize that they had assigned a different party there, so we did have to wait a little more while they tried to sort the situation out.Other than that, the rest of the meal was great. We first started out with a variety of complimentary pretzels and traditional sourdough bread which came out fresh, piping hot. For RW, I decided to go for the following:- Point Judith Calamari.  This dish was very tasty...had a lot of flavor with the sweet chili sauce and sesame seeds sprinkled over the calamari. - Filet Mignon.  Excellent. The temperature was cooked to my liking and paired nicely with the cauliflower purée, kale & mushroom medley- Warm Butter Cake.  Dessert wasn't bad, but would have to say this was my least favorite out of the courses.  I really enjoyed the side of fresh berries and vanilla ice cream.  The cake was warm, crumb-like in texture, but far too sweet for me.Our waitress was observant, friendly and efficient with the service.

3.0,8/14/2018,"Very much disappointed.  I'm not sure what I missed.  However, the exceptional five star service and experience was a big let down.  I joined two girlfriends for restaurant week dinner. All the reviews talk about how amazing the portions are, etc. I suppose I missed something because it was a complete let down. For starters I had Point Judith Calamari, it was alright not crispy but it was okay. The other ladies both ordered the Lobster Bisque which they both stated was just okay.  All three of us ordered the filet mignon. Again, I was not crazy about it. It didn't melt in my mouth or anything special.  The cut was not how everybody raved about.  Again, perhaps just me but I supposed it was not my night and the food didn't lift me up to any special food place.  Now to dessert - I guess our table was beyond adventurous and we all ordered the carrot cake.  Complete let down. It was beyond sugary. All I consumed was sugar, it took our table forever and a day to consume.  Should have went with the warm butter cake.  The carrot cake also was not as pictured.  Our server was polite and the guy who twice came by to ask how are you finding everything was beyond impersonal.  The question he asked was so scripted that it truly had no value for him to ask. It is called faux pretense.  For restaurant week, this Ocean Prime is one a handful of restaurants who are steakhouses that are actually offering a steak on the menu.  I truly do not know where Ocean Prime stands with me, I was truly disappointed.

5.0,8/12/2018,"This place is amazing.Ocean Prime's generous Restaurant Week menu allowed me and my family to eat a three-course dinner for approximately half the regular price. It's the biggest and fanciest place I've ever been to, with dim lights that set the mood, candles, plants, and so much space (+private rooms and restrooms upstairs). The service is about as good as it gets. I remember our server frequently checking up on us to see when we were ready for the next course, and kindly respond to all of our questions/requests. But the best part (obviously) was the food. Although our entrees took a long time to come out, it was worth the wait. I had the 8 oz filet mignon (normally $52, which is already more than the whole $42 discounted meal; thank God for NYC Restaurant Week) with an additional $15 for it ""Rossini Style,"" which added truffles and foie gras on top. I'd never tried foie gras before, so I wasn't sure but I am soooo grateful I made that decision, because the foie gras was actually heavenly. A filet mignon without foie gras will never be the same for me again; the foie gras was just the star of the plate for me and I savored every single bite. The steak itself was also perfectly cooked. My mother had the salmon teriyaki and loved it, especially the shiitake sticky rice underneath. And last but not least: dessert. Carrot cake is one of my favorite cakes, so I had high expectations for it and sadly I was a bit disappointed. It was still tasty but I've just had better. On the other hand, my family and I really enjoyed the butter cake. The ice cream on top served as a refreshing contrast to the warm cake, and the raspberry sauce and berries on the side brought a tangy flavor to the dish, so it wasn't too plain. In the end, we ordered an additional scoop of vanilla ice cream to help finish off the butter cake, which just isn't the same without ice cream, and we took the carrot cakes to go since we were absolutely stuffed in the best way possible.

My boyfriend and I were coming to New York for my 30th birthday and did some research and found this place online and saw all the great reviews. We came here on the night of July 18 the day of my 30th birthday and they said our reserved  booth wasn't ready yet because they gave our table away so the manager said to have a round of drinks on him and they would get a new booth ready for us. I had the bubbling berries drink and it was so good and so awesome to see it bubble! When they showed us to the booth, there was happy birthday confetti on the table, it put a huge smile on my face and made me feel like they really did care!! We both got steak mine I had asked for medium and my boyfriend asked for well done when my steak came out it was rare completely raw in the middle so I let the server know and he brought it back to have them cook it a little bit more. When he brought it out again it was still very raw almost like they hadn't even cooked it again so he apologized thoroughly and said the manager would come out and speak with me. The manager said he saw how uncooked the steak was and that they would have a fresh one perfectly cooked for me as soon as they could. When they brought the new steak out it was the best steak I've ever had, perfectly juicy very well seasoned and so darn good!!! The truffle mac & cheese was by far the best mac & cheese I've ever had!! The manager came over and chatted with us for quite a bit and was very friendly and very welcoming and made us feel like we really knew him. The server brought over two large glasses of champagne for my birthday and told me to pick out any dessert I wanted on the menu. I got the 10 layer carrot cake and it was absolutely delicious. We were there for about three hours because we were enjoying the meal and our time together and we're so pleased and so happy of how well they took care of us there. The manager said he felt so bad it was my birthday my first time there and that the steak was not cooked right twice that he took care of a lot of our bill and even gave us a gift card for the location here in DC that is close to my boyfriend and I. They really took care of us there and I would gladly go back any day just to go to that location for that customer service, but I will definitely check out the one in DC with my boyfriend and I hope that we have just as great as it experience as we did at the one in New York!!!

The seafood menu is extensive and the steak options are well worth the thought of skipping the seafood. Their cocktails are prepared perfectly and with unique options. One of my favorite places I've been while visiting new york over the years. I just left and had a fabulous and enjoyable time here.

4.0,7/26/2018,"I came here for NYC Restaurant Week and had the prix fixe menu. The atmosphere was a lot more business formal than I expected, so upon entering in shorts and sneakers, I felt out of place. The total price for two people came down to be 98 dollars excluding tip. That didn't really matter though, because the service was great and I didn't feel uncomfortable. Let me just break down the food I ordered.Calamari - the sauce was a unique flavor of sweet and salty, reminded me of Thai food. A little too much spice. It tasted pretty good, but I wasn't blown away. It was sort of soggy and didn't achieve my desired crispy crunch. Salmon - the sauce was very very similar, and because it was so strong, I had a strong desire to eat more. At the end of the day though, I've tasted more tender fish. It was a teensy bit dry and the sauce sort of overpowered everything. Carrot cake - I loved the carrot cake, and as someone who doesn't really eat that much sweets, this was a good treat. The lemon sauce on the side was a little too much for my taste though. Overall, the interior design impressed me a lot more than the food. The food did not reach the expectations I had constructed before entering, but it wasn't bad either.",1,0,0,Victoria G.,"Fairfield, CT",136,62,308
2.0,7/26/2018,"So disappointed!  We were not Impressed at all. We got there and found out it was Restaurant Week, so we thought we'd get some of their best food. If that was their best, I'm not sure why people are rating this so high.  We started with the lobster bisque, which was ""oily"" and not nearly as velvety smooth as we've had elsewhere.  I had the salad, and the greens were limp and not fresh tasting.  For the main course, my partner ordered the Teriyaki salmon, which was over cooked- not flaky like it should be.  I had the filet mignon, which was just okay.  The butter cake was the only reason we gave this two stars.   Maybe their regular menu is better, but the Restaurant Week one was not worth the price.",0,0,0,Elaine W.,"Chattanooga, TN",60,55,22

I ordered the chilean sea bass and that was just amazing! The fish was nice and flaky, while the sauce was so flavorful. We shared the garlic mashed potatoes and that was nice and buttery with lots of garlic chips on top. I highly recommend the brut rose.

It was buttery in both flavor and texture and the mashed potatoes that came with it matched it perfectly. Dessert was a ten layer carrot cake.

He loved the salad and how light the dressing was. He also loved the sea bass as it was so soft and flaky. I got the lobster bisque as my appetizer and the first few spoonfuls were good but then it started tasting too heavy. You were also able to see the swirls of butter in the soup. I got the tuna tartar for my main dish and although the fish tasted fresh, I didn't like the sauce that came with it. It was very salty which made the whole dish taste salty.

None of the people, including myself, on my team had ever been so we were excited to try something new. Made a reservation, showed up right on time, the host quickly found our name and gave us the best seat in the house - a table with a rounded booth (more so resembled a couch) and chairs. This place is massive with both indoor and outdoor (when the weather permits) seating. Our waitress was one of the nicest people I have ever met. She listed the specials, got us hooked on the truffle mac & cheese, and made sure our glasses were never empty. For our apps we ordered two of the mac & cheese, the surf & turf app, and the steak tartare app. The truffle mac was delicious and so, so creamy. The surf and turf was awesome with scallops and short rib. The steak tartare was the best I've ever had and served with small pieces of bread. For our entrees, we each went with something different. I had the Chilean sea bass which was served over mashed potatoes and glazed carrots. The sea bass was delicious and so tender. The potatoes hit the nail on the head. Everyone else raved about their meals, as well. Especially the lobster toast (avocado toast topped with lobster with a side of either lobster bisque or fries). We couldn't pass on the dessert menu. Since we are indecisive people we decided to order one of each. My personal favorite was the creme brulee, the sound when you ""crack"" it open was oh so satisfying. The chocolate cake was a bit too rich for me but I'm not a chocolate person so ignore this comment completely. The warm butter cake was outstanding! So warm, not sweet whatsoever, and just so light and fluffy. The berry cheesecake was also delicious and very, very fresh.If I had a better wallet situation I would probably dine here a lot more often.

($13?).After this, for one person it ended up being over $120 but I think if you were looking to spend less than this, skip dessert maybe get a soda to drink and it could be under $100.Next time I think I'll dry an app, those sound very good.Highly recommend!",1,0,0,Kell M.,"Glen Burnie, MD",179,150,146

Their oysters are so fresh and steaks are seared to finesse. I am personally in love with their creamed spinach and will probably never opt for anything else to side with my filet mignon.

Large, spacious setting and the seats were in a large room - separate rooms above and to each of the sides, at the front of the restaurant, too. Appetizer: Thai Calamari was great, crispy and with a little sweet spice. Good portion size, too. Lobster bisque served in two frames, with the lobster + corn fritters on the bowl, then cream bisque poured over after. While I have had better, it certainly satisfied a craving.And for the main lunch course, tried the shellfish ""Cobb"" salad, which was ok, but ended up not balanced through the meal - start was great with plenty of seafood at the top, then a large bed of lettuce that I ended up eating through towards the end, without even much of the gourmet dressing.

The Filet was under cooked and lacked in seasoning. The portions of the crab legs and crab cakes for the prices were ridiculously small.  The fries and mashed potatoes were good.

5.0,3/15/2018,"Literally one of my favorite restaurants within NYC although there are infinite dining choices, Ocean Prime is a classic dining experience with some of the best waitstaff I've ever seen. Attentive does not wren do them justice. Presentation is simple and like I said classic but thorough. The food is well made, & the chef is creative and provides seasonal dishes mixed with traditional modern flair. Delightful to the palate! There is evident use of simple but flavorful seasonings. This is a perfect place for a date! Not really family geared though. Also don't forget to look presentable. No jeans or sneakers please! Although this rule isn't set in stone, I've never seen anyone in less than a button up with dress shoes or a dress and heels, trousers, blouse and heels. There are two levels and they also have space for private parties as well (which is what I did) Tip: you must make a reservation! And there's a parking garage on 57th that is a little pricey (100 per SUV for 3 hours) or if walking isn't an option they offer a lovely valet service available close by that is around the same rate.",0,0,0,Brittany G.,"New York, NY",124,64,56

I like that the menu has an extensive seafood selection aside from steak, and best of all, they have a gluten-free friendly menu. I'm always appreciative of restaurants which show consideration towards people's allergies.I really want to commend our server - Camille. I can't take dairy, sugar and gluten, so she specially went through the menu with me to explain what I could substitute. And both her and the restaurant were so flexible about it. My party of 4 was planning to share a steak we ordered but I forgot to tell her that I was sharing too (because I had ordered a salmon for myself). Turned out the steak was cooked with butter so I couldn't eat it. It was totally my fault for not making it clear but she came over and apologised, and even had a small cut cooked separately for me so that I could have a taste. This is the hallmark of great service. It's the sincerity and consideration that Camille had, and I hope the restaurant recognises what an exceptional staff they have!The food was all really done well and I truly enjoyed the entire experience.",1,1,1,Jamie C.,"New York, NY",0,6,0

4.0,3/3/2018,"I came here for dinner with a few friends during Winter Restaurant Week recently. The interior of the place was sleek, elegant, classy with a comfortable vibe. We were given a basket full of two different types of bread: Traditional sourdough and pretzel. My friend ordered the Berries & Bubbles cocktail which was made at the table. The drink was actually bubbling and smoke came out off the top which from the dry ice and it was really awesome to watch. For my appetizer, I selected the lobster bisque, which came with a fried corn fritter. The lobster bisque was pretty good but had more of a cheddar flavor than lobster. It would have been better if there were more chunks of lobster throughout the soup. The corn fritter was nicely sweet and tasty. My friend had the fried calamari which was served with sweet chili sauce, sesame seeds, shredded carrots and was absolutely delicious! I preferred this over the lobster bisque. The calamari was fresh, perfectly crisp, full of great flavor. I thoroughly enjoyed my entree, which was filet mignon on top of cauliflower mash and kale, with mushrooms on top. I asked for the steak to be cooked medium well with very little pink interior. They honored this request completely and the filet mignon was still incredibly tender, juicy, melt in your mouth wonderful! The outside was charred slightly and the sauce that accompanied the meat was great. The cauliflower mash mingled with the kale was so yummy, as was the mushroom. Dessert was Butter Cake and Carrot Cake. The Butter Cake had vanilla ice cream on top and berries on the side. The cake was served warm and so delightful! The flavors came together to create this rich, moist, fluffy goodness. The Carrot Cake was 5 layers of alternating sweet cream cheese frosting and flavorful spice cake. It came with pineapple puree. The frosting was creamy and delectable, while the cake was a bit dense but tasty nonetheless. Our waitress was lovely and really knew the menu well. She made spot-on menu recommendations. Everything came out in a timely manner and was served with a smile. My friends and I had a fabulous experience dining here.",13,6,9,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",783,438,5876

I'm not sure you could make a bad choice from their steak selection, but I can tell you the Ribeye is particularly good.  The sides served are all table sides and each and every one I've tried has been excellent in its own right.  The standout here is the Jalapeno Au Gratin, divine.  The Creamed Spinach, Parmesan Truffle Fries, and Smoked Gouda Tater Tots  were also big hits.  I hope at some point to visit another of the locations with the family in tow.",0,0,0,Brett H.,"Travelers Rest, SC",91,226,912
4.0,2/7/2018,"First thing first, RESTAURANT WEEK IS LIT. Going off that, of course I came during restaurant week. It was a really great deal. Three course dinner for only $42 while their Filet Mignon alone cost $48! How our course went:First Course: Lobster Bisque: very tasty and corn was super sweet! Good way to start off.Calamari: ehhh. The calamari was a little soggy and was not hot. Taste like General Tso Calamari!Second Course (Main): Filet Mignon: Steak was flavor with the right amount of seasoning. Very soft and melted in my mouth! The mashed potato and veges were also a great touch to it!Teriyaki Salmon: the sauce was delicious and not too sweet. Salmon was super fresh and juicy.Third Course (Dessert): better than a lot of pricey steakhouse dessert place! Butter Cake: better than expected. It was almost like a lava cake but without the chocolate. The cake was hot and there was ice cream over it with raspberry sauce on the side!Carrot Cake: not too sweet and tasted way better than it sounds! BTW dress up when you come here or else be prepare to be treated like you can't afford it. I came here not expecting to come and was definitely not dressed for this place. I already knew and was debating on to come or not, but I was like whats the worst... not much besides like the waitress constantly looking you up and down and acting like you can't afford the place, but seriously if people come they can obviously afford it.

3.0,1/29/2018,"First of all - it's probably unfair for me to write a review of this place because I'm a vegetarian and absolutely had no business coming here in the first place. However, having found myself here, I did really want to have a nice meal. To my pleasant surprise, in addition to the 3 sides and 1 appetizer on the menu that is remotely vegetarian, they also have an unlisted (secret?) veggie option. My second surprise was that it actually tasted pretty good! Quinoa cake over veggies with a delicious lemon based sauce. So why the 3 stars? Honestly, because the waiters are inattentive and if I'm going to pay the big bucks, I expect an experience to match. I don't like going to large restaurants like that because they usually act like if you're not a large dude spending exorbitant amounts of money on liquor and lobster you don't exist. I have no value to them. But I don't like to be made to feel like that. We were seated by the bar and placed our coats and things on the chairs next to us. A few minutes later a waiter came and said they needed those chairs to accommodate another table. Should have some in the back instead of inconveniencing us, unless you plan to charge us less than you would in the main dining room. My napkin fell off my lap and I didn't notice but the wait staff walked past me and kept stepping on it and didn't look down.

Everyone at the front desk was really nice and accommodating.I noted in the comment section that we were coming for Restaurant week so they gave us two menus for that as well as a drink menu. I think they gave everyone a restaurant week menu though just in case which i liked since some restaurants you have to ask for it separately. My boyfriend and I also decided to get a bottle of Chardonnay which they put on ice for us and filled our glasses throughout the meal which was a nice touch.For Food: I got the calamari and my boyfriend got the lobster bisque. The calamari was in a sweet and spicy thai sauce with shreddped carrots. I tried a little bit of my boyfriends bisque and it was really good too, it had chunks of lobster throughout and a corn fritter on top! We both got the filet mignon for our entree both cooked to the way we wanted. The puree underneath was awesome! The steak was so good too. I would deff recommend getting it while you're here.

4.0,1/21/2018,"Most of the Food was delicious!  The reason I am giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because many people at our table ordered steaks, and unfortunately they weren't cooked to our liking.  My 8oz filet mignon was very inconsistent varying from medium rare to medium well.  (I ordered medium.). The lobster gratin I ordered as a ""dressing"" on top of my steak left much to be desired.  It consisted of 2 small pieces of lobster and barely any sauce.  (Someone else at the table ordered it as well and had mainly sauce without much lobster.). I would not recommend paying $17 extra for it.  Lobster bisque soup, scallop short rib app, and carrot cake were delish!  (The waiter was really accommodating and helped to split the soup and app into 2 portions for us.). Overall would recommend but would not order steak again!",0,0,0,Irina P.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,3

I ordered the Prime Roll and my bf ordered a special for the 20 oz aged steak with a side of lobster mash. We also got cocktails: the Berries and Bubbles that literally bubbles and the Old Fashioned. Everything was delicious! For dessert, we had a butter cake. The cake is not as good as the one from Mastro's, but it's still really good!

I didn't realize this was a chain restaurant when I booked our reservation, but I won't be coming to any Ocean Prime ever again.Be mindful: this is a formal place. It was mainly people in suits having business lunches. Not good for people on vacation like us. Our server was friendly, but seemed a bit condescending towards us tourists. She definitely seemed more attentive to the businesspeople. Service was average speed.The best part of our meal was the bread basket. The pretzel bread was delicious. I ate way more than I probably should have. The main meal was where the real problem was. My salmon was ridiculously undercooked, basically raw in the entire center portion. That showed how little the restaurant cared about us as customers. I just picked around the raw parts and ate what I could. Ended up eating only around 1/2 the salmon.Absolutely disgusted.

The host and hostess were very apologetic, we were taken to our table where a floor manager greeted us and were equally apologetic.  We had the cheese bread and the deviled eggs.  The cheese bread which was spicy and accompanied by shrimp was excellent.  It is a must try.  The deviled eggs lacked flavor and I would recommend passing.  Our entrees were a grouper and a Chilean sea bass.  Both were very good and memorable meals.  What I most like about Ocean Prime is that no matter the location or how you are dressed, they treat you like you arrived in a tux and gown.  The food is always good and the attention to detail is unparalleled.  Marked down as we were forgotten in the bar, but the bar staff made it feel like an easy wait.",0,0,0,Dave J.,"Bennington, NE",1,35,18

3.0,8/13/2017,"I brought my girlfriend here for her 24th birthday dinner during restaurant week. They did a wonderful job making the table feel special for her day! Little happy birthdays and cake cutouts were sprinkled on the table when we arrived. They also placed a candle in the dessert she received.Our waitress was wonderful. She was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu, and gave great recommendations on wine. The waitstaff always had our water filled as well. Unfortunately my 3 star review is because of the food itself. While not terrible, I do not think it was up to par for a $200 meal. Everything was just ""okay"". For starters we had the lobster bisque and calamari. The bisque was very good except for having too much pepper. The calamari had an Asian twist, and while tasty it was mushy because of being smothered in sauce (perhaps serve the sauce on the side). We also ordered some oysters separate from the restaurant week menu which tasted very good. Our mains were the salmon and filet mignon with lobster gratin. She did not like the salmon, too salty and tasted strange. I thought the filet was pretty good but cooked medium instead of medium rare, so started drying out. Our desserts were the peanut butter cake and carrot cake. Peanut butter cake was average, carrot cake was very dry.I may return here soon with coworkers for a few drinks and appetizers at their beautiful bar. Will have to think about giving it another try for a dinner date though.",1,0,0,Joe K.,"New York, NY",3,54,75

Caesar salad, filet with shrimp scampi and chocolate cake. While food was great, drink was better. The berries & bubbles cocktail bubbling from dry ice was visually stunning and delicious.

Taste but don't indulge or you'll never make it to dessert. My first course was the house salad, which was loaded with extra goodies. My meal was unbelievable. Two lobster tails, mashed potatoes, asparagus, spinach, and scallops. I was absolutely unable to finish half of it. Imagine leaving some scallops and lobster behind - for dessert. (For me, that was a first!) My daughter ordered the French onion soup, the twin tails with truffle Mac and cheese. And raved.

It was very good, but honestly you can get much better sushi elsewhere, and it definitely wasn't the highlight of the dinner. Nonetheless we enjoyed it!Both mine and my boyfriend's entreès were fantastic however. He had the Kansas City Ribeye which was cooked rare as can be (just as he likes it) and ate the entire thing! I ordered the tuna steak which just melted in my mouth, but my favorite part of the meal was the little fresh summer salad that came with my tuna, it had mango, avocado, tomatoes, and some other ingredients I'm definitely forgetting. I honestly could have eaten a whole bowl of it though. The roasted brussels sprouts side was good, but nothing exceptional. I make pretty much the same ones at home that I love.Oh and I can't forget we ended the night with a ten layer carrot cake.

3.0,7/1/2017,"For a chain restaurant it's pretty good. But as a nyc eatery competing with difrisco and oceana within a block it comes out third. The other two feel like only in a few cities could I eat this well. Here almost any city with some wealth could have themselves an Ocean Prime. We split the Tuna Tatare which was very nice but far tastier at Oceana. Then we split a fillet mignon which was fine. A good piece of meat but nothing memorable. And I don't think it helped that our waiter was totally engrossed in the next table with a very pretty woman, to totally ignoring us. Hey I can understand it but this fellow, not exactly a spring chicken, should've known better. In short an expensive meal with just average service and ambience. Perfect expense account meal.

We had to flag him down to take our order, to get the bday cake slices, and to pay. Constantly waiting. It wasn't even busy, so any other employee would've seen the zero service or a manager could've stepped in. No attempt at being attentive or engaging with us. Only 3 people. Was he new?

2.0,6/8/2017,"We have dined at Ocean Prime in Tampa dozens of times. Every visit is better than the next.  It is the place to go for great food, great ambiance, great service from entry to departure! We even selected this restaurant for our 25th wedding anniversary dinner on 2/22 while we were in Florida for my husband's work with spring training.  Our table was decorated and they were thrilled to have us with them.   We love it so much that I decided I wanted to try the NYC location for my birthday.  Hmmm. My husband made the reservation on line and specified that we had 2 birthday girls in our party of 5.New York needs to learn from the Tampa location. Overall, our waitress, Kerrie, saved the night.  She was attentive. Our food was prepared properly and was very good.  Our desserts were complimentary. Thank goodness for her.  Our first impression, which unfortunately can be a lasting one ... was HORRIBLE. There was a nasty hostess at the front check-in desk and only two people at the adjacent bar. (Scary sign for a Saturday night steak house in Manhattan.) The hostess had to ask our name 3x.  She acted as though we were intruding on her night. When I tell you she was rude it's an understatement.  We were totally taken by surprise.  We were in good spirits and looking forward to a fun evening. She ruined the first 20 minutes.    She proceeded to seat us in a booth in the bar area where there was NO ONE dining.  No atmosphere. No fun birthday confetti on the table. You could hear a pin drop.  We quickly asked to be moved to the dining room where it was a bit more lively.  The hostess was not happy to move us.  She clearly needed to give the wait staff in the bar the business. I get that. But not on my birthday night.  She acted pained and inconvenienced to move our table. A second hostess was lingering and I thought she would take over the situation. Her attitude was worse than the first.  Wow!  We almost left - that's how bad!  These were the first two people we met at Ocean Prime in NYC - what a disappointment.  (I wish I got their names.  (8pm Saturday June 3rd.) There was no advance preparation to show that they had read the reservation comments about celebrating a birthday, (after celebrating a 25th anniversary in Tampa.)  Why did my husband go through the trouble of trying to make the night special when the hostess / mgmt doesn't bother to read it and clearly did NOT care!? (He even called to confirm the reservation earlier in the day and when he hung up he said, ""wow, she didn't care."" That should have been our sign.     So, back to the evening ... The manager came by and asked if all was ok - we briefly described our first impression - he was disinterested and blamed it on a language barrier.  That was even more insulting. There was no communication problem.  The two hostesses were arrogant condescending and unfriendly.  Kerrie came through to provide a lovely evening. She is the reason my birthday was salvaged. She even put some confetti down on the table, which I am guessing is not her responsibility. She tried.  I think she would tell management we were a nice table, generous tippers and liked to have fun.  We did not deserve the treatment that we received upon our arrival. Yet, we did. And it will not be forgotten.    Del Friscos Double Eagle is my ""go to"" steak house in NYC and for a more intimate setting K-Rico on the west side.   Consistently fabulous.  Too much competition in Manhattan for Ocean Prime to be sub-par.  My trip advisor reviews of properties are usually great - I am not one to complain - but this really bothered me!

The service is outstanding and the waitstaff had answers to every question from food preparation to wine selection. We noticed that our server in particular found the head of our table (my very conservative father) and established a relationship with him and learned of his food/wine and other personal interests and found ways to relate to him and shared stories as he served us. This was an extra step that many servers don't take, or are too hesitant to take, but we really appreciated the connection he was making!

5.0,6/4/2017,"Amazing dinner last night at ocean prime. I was a little nervous at first because it's a chain. Also I've been disappointed with high end restaurants lately. But ocean prime didn't disappoint. Everything was absolutely amazing. The bread - awesome pretzel bread! Loved it. We had shrimp cocktail (4 jumbo)  served on dry ice - delicious and caviar deviled eggs (6 eggs)We ordered the crab cake dinner, Chilean Sea Bass, salmon and a filet with crab cake. Also jalapeño au gratin and asparagus. All the dishes were fantastic. The salmon was my least favorite but the filet was just perfect. So much better than a steak house. The crab cakes just fell apart because it's all crab meat. The sides were also outstanding. Tender and perfectly cooked and Seasoned asparagus. We also ordered salads that were all amazing. The coffee French press was the best coffee we ever had. And the peanut butter pie was out of this world. Very chocolate/peanut butter! Super rich. The cocktails were good as well - they have these amazing black cherries soaked in brandy - just outstanding. For four people - about 6 cocktails, dessert, appetizers entrees, coffees - it was over $500 so it is pricey. But you get what you paid for! It was a 5 star experience.

Today I had a short gather-together with a friend of mine thus took the opportunity to enjoy the food.* Fried calamari. This was the best calamari I have ever eaten - probably due to the sauce, which carried a light BBQ flavor.* King crab leg. As fresh and tasty as one could imagine; and they also kindly heated up the butter for you. I would recommend eat it without the butter though.* Fillet. Highlight of the day. Really a good balance with just the right amount of grease. Medium was the way to go (don't have to order medium rare if you prefer medium, as they would not over-cook, lol).Sadly we did not leave enough space for desserts; we should have!

We ordered a wide variety of dishes: salmon salad, parmesan crisp chicken caesar salad, and salmon filet.

4.0,4/10/2017,"Tough to rate this place.  My husband did not like the red snapper (saying it was too dry) or the brussel sprouts (too much sweet balsamic vinegar).  I had the chicken which was a bit bland.  We liked the shrimp cocktail, my sons liked the filet mignon and we all enjoyed the carrot cake.  The ambiance was nice as was the service.  But my husband's red snapper and my chicken killed the 5 star review, almost having given it a 3 star.  But given that this was one of my son's favorites on our trip, I guess I feel like a 4 star is fairer.  But nothing stood out as FANTASTIC.  We probably could have ordered better dishes.",0,0,0,Shirley V.,"Yorba Linda, CA",1,149,0

First off, the restaurant is beautiful and modern so it gives off a great first impression.  We started off with cocktails at the bar.  The drinks were amazing, the atmosphere was lively and while there were a lot of people there (we went right after work), it wasn't suffocating because the area is quite spacious.  My husband and I usually like to eat at the bar in restaurants, but with so many people around we decided to try for a table even though we didn't have a reservation.  I know they didn't have one open, I could tell they were very busy in the dinning hall.  But GM Kevin Flannery didn't hesitate at all when we asked if we could be seated, he instantly told my husband he would get him a table.  Our dinner was incredible, but we were so hungry we just devoured it, so no pictures, sorry.  And while we were complementing our waiter on an evening well spent, the GM walked by and got us deserts on the house.  We were beyond ourselves, completely floored.  And I don't mean to make this the last part of my review when in fact it should be the first, but the most stunning part of the restaurant is its people and the impeccable and flawless service they provide.  I was sincerely impressed and I cannot wait to go back!",1,0,0,Rita R.,"Manhattan, NY",2,7,9

5.0,2/27/2017,"We dined at Ocean Prime this past Saturday night (2/25/17) and I must say this is one of the best meals I have ever had in New York City! From the second you walk in the front door you feel welcome and that the staff is genuinely happy to see you! We had a reservation and were seated immediately the gentleman that sat us was very pleasant and inquired way we were in the city, we told him we were celebrating our son's birthday he of course wished him a happy birthday, but he seemed to actually mean it and continued to inquire what our plans were while in the city, it was just very warm and something I have come to not expect from people. Our waiter I do believe his name was James was second to none he was attentive, very knowledgeable of the menu and willing to make suggestions, not to mention very pleasant to talk to. We started with cocktails and I drink bourbon on the rocks and they do have Angels Envy so that was an easy choice to make, my wife had a ""Whiskey Clover"" and she said it was so very good! So, we decided on a second round of drinks they arrived promptly and I must say my second bourbon was rather generous, James said the first one looked a little light...I like James!For appetizers, my son had the Surf & Turf (Sea Scallops, Slow Braised Short Ribs) they were in a word ""Amazing"" My wife had Ahi Tuna Tartar which was ""Beyond Amazing"" and I had the Prime Beef Tartar which if I hadn't tried both of theirs I would have said it was fantastic but if I am being honest theirs were better, but I still really enjoyed it!They also have a very nice wine list and we shared a very nice Pinot Noir I do not recall the name but it was rather good! For dinner AJ had a Filet Mignon Oscar Style, My wife had the Florida Grouper and I had a 22oz Rib Eye on the bone. All three meals we cooked perfectly and we all sent back empty plates! We also shared an order of Brussels Sprouts and the Parmesan Truffle Fries which were finished as well!For dessert they actually gave my son a complimentary birthday dessert of his choice which I honestly didn't expect I figured we would get a candle and ""Happy Birthday"" written on a plate. It was a pleasant surprise! He opted for the Chocolate peanut butter pie, we shared a 10 layer carrot cake. I have to say this was the best carrot cake I have ever had! If you are looking for a great steak house with excellent service then you need to try Ocean Prime! Yes I know it is a chain but it is a very well done chain!

She was very friendly & gave us some great advice on what to order. I started with Berries & Bubbles cocktail which is such a delight and tastes just as good.

5.0,2/14/2017,Decided to come here for Valentine's Day. Surprised I was able to get a last minute reservation . Usually hesitant about hitting up places located in touristy areas but since the hubby wanted seafood we checked it out. The restaurant had a back up when we arrived for our 8:45 reservation as they were still trying to seat the 8:30.    They told us upfront there would a bit of a wait so we were nervous because we were on a time crunch to get back to our little ones and trying to squeeze in this date night. They understood and tried to get us seated as soon as they could so it wasn't till about 9:15 - yeah about half an hour and in a table they had to make up. Not ideal but they were trying their best. We ordered the lobster tails and the swordfish and soup and some sides. There was a back up in the kitchen so it took a while. Why you ask did I give them so many stars ? Because the food was excellent - hot and fresh and the service throughout was impeccable. They had a tough situation and I could see they really were trying to make the best of it because people just were not getting up long after they were done and the staff didn't want to push them out hard. Everyone was communicative and checked on us and apologetic and also comp'd us a bit. They tried to turn our nightmare date into something we can still feel good about when they don't really have to because this place was packed. For that I am definitely going to come back.,0,0,0,Jaime D.,"New York, NY",14,91,28
1.0,2/13/2017,"After a bad review on Yelp, we were invited back to the restaurant to give it a second chance by their manager. We had ordered the following,Appetizers: 1) Sonoma Goat Cheese Ravioli - if you like goat cheese, this is pretty good. 2) Point Judith Calamari - this dish was way too sweet, and we have a friend who would die for sweets, but she did not really touch this other than the cashews3) White Truffle Caviar Deviled Eggs - Sigh. We've had better deviled eggs at local brunch places. They were definitely not as creamy or savory as we expected them to be. 4) ""Surf N Turf"" which are sea scallops, topped with slow braised short ribs, over mashed potato. - Sea scallops were really fresh, however, we did not enjoy it with the short ribs, they overwhelmed the freshness of the scallops. 5) Shrimp Saute - was not appealing. Entrees:One of the girls had the lobster tails, which came with a small bowl of butter placed on top of a candle.  (Very creative, and kept the butter warm. Greatest idea, ever!) - She loved it. Some of us ordered the Kansas City strip, and it was not impressive. Another girl ordered pork chops because they did not have the lamb chops. My friend thinks that it was quite tasty, but when I had a piece from her, the pork chops wanted to fight back. I had the Rib-eye with Maytag Blue Cheese Crust. What disappointed me was the waiter said, ""Oh! This is also my favorite!"" with suchhhhh excitement, but when I bit into my steak, it did not meet my expectation at all. It was too cooked for my taste when I ordered it medium rare, it came out onlyyyyy a light pink in the middle of my steak, nor does it have much blue cheese taste for a cheese lover like me. [[[[[ When I posted a picture of my steak on facebook, my friend commented, ""What is this?!"" ]]]]]]  I was so ashamed. My friend next to me ordered the same rib-eye, but with the Oscar Style. He said it tasted better than my blue cheese crust. The bf ordered the special steak, which apparently did not impress him, neither. Sides: 1) Jalapeno Au Gratin - tasteless2) Lobster mashed potato - the mashed potato was a bit watery, and we've had better. Desserts: 1) Ten Layer Carrot Cake - it was alright, but I thought the cake can be a bit more moist, and the cream cheese filling can be creamier. 2) Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie - maybe it was me, it was way too sweet. 3) Creme Brulee - never seen a creme brulee with such sugar crust that needed an ice scraper to break open. 4) Baked Alaska - it tasted like ice cream cake we could have gotten from Carvel. Comments: 1) One of our friend ordered a second beer, but it never came. 2) When dining in such an high-end restaurant, customers like us, would expect our waiters constantly come back to refill our water glasses. However, there were at least two empty glasses on the table, waiting. 3) Yes, we were greeted by many people, hostess, waiters, and manager of the night, but we know it is only because of a bad review we've posted some time ago. 4) Their menu is similar to Mastro's (across the street), and most of the party think the food at Mastro's was better than Ocean Prime. (Note: When last planned dinner failed at Ocean Prime, we moved our dinner to Mastro's for two very special birthdays, and with only a last minute notice, and to our surprise, they've done a remarkable job.) 5) Andddd if you everrrr speak to a hostess name Alisa or Alecia?, don't be alarmed if she sounds like she does not like to work there. I've just read another yelp review, and the yelper had the same issue while talking to her. I only called to confirm the original dinner reservation, be mindful, I CALLED TO CONFIRMED, I never even got a call from the restaurant. I asked if there was a note for two birthdays for that night, and she did not sound too helpful. Thank you, Ocean Prime for inviting us back for the second time. However, with this overall experience, I don't think I'll return. But again, thank you. We appreciate your gratitude very much.P.S.

That is what stuck out to me the most. If I was measuring my review with the advanced criteria that a professional critic would use, this place would still get a glowing review. The service was great. The food came out as timely and in rhythm as I've ever experienced in my life. The presentation and temperature of the food coming out was top tier. I ordered the blackened snapper. If I'm ever lucky enough to get old and lose my teeth, I would still be able to eat this snapper. I was basically only eating it with my tongue anyway. It was that tender. The showstopper for me, however, was the teriyaki salmon. It was both the best fish dish and the best teriyaki dish I've ever had in my life and it's not even close. Another dish that deserves praise is the house salad. When you get a bite with all of the components, you'll be surprised at how perfect a bite something so simple just gifted you. To round it out, we had the carrot cake, calamari, and peanut butter chocolate pie. All were noteworthy. This restaurant sits on a block and area with many direct competitors.

Mind you, this was about 8:15- it's now 8:56. My boyfriend checked with the front at about 8:30 and they said they'll come and get us. Usually, a situation like this wouldn't bother me because it is Friday night, and it was pretty busy at the restaurant. HOWEVER the fact that everyone we entered with was seated before us was strange, and the unwelcoming attitude we received from the front didn't help the situation.I hate to play the race card, but why give your money to a restaurant who clearly isn't welcoming you?

The bisque came with the bread cracker instead of the lobster, albeit some minced lobster pieces were in the bisque. Both of these are among my fave dishes and I order them quite a lot - the Ocean Prime's renditions rank at the bottom of what I'd tasted in 20 years.My dirty martini was quite watery, and according to dad there was a 40-50% difference in volume between the two servings of the (lively) whiskey he'd ordered. Fairly imprecise bartending.The tuna entrée was excellent, as was its rich and balanced truffle sauce.

We were promptly seated by the host when we arrived at this restaurant. We ordered East Coast Oysters from Raw Bar, which were amazing. For main course I opted for Dutch Harbor King Crab legs with Asparagus, Drawn Butter and she went for Twin Lobster Tails with Asparagus, Drawn Butter. Both the Entrees were good but I would like to point out that the Lobster was little tough, it wasn't tender as I had expected. The King Crab was just delicious. We shared the Entrees and we both agreed that the Lobster could have been better. We had also ordered Lobster Mashed Potatoes as Side Dish - Which was AWESOME!. To finish off the lovely evening we ordered Chocolate Cake which came with Hand Spun Vanilla Ice Cream. It was good too.

5.0,12/15/2016,"Okay, I had an AMAZING experience with my dad. I took him here for his birthday dinner in November and we decided to sit in the Lounge (best decision). We sat in a big, comfy booth and were told that Happy Hour was happening (this was at 5:30pm on a Saturday), so we could get the Berries & Bubbles for $10 (originally $17) and sushi rolls for $10 (originally $20 to $22). This was especially excellent news because as I had read the reviews for this place before, those were exactly what we wanted to get. We each got a Dynamite Roll, which is a tempura shrimp with spicy mayo roll topped with more delicious tempura shrimp. Great roll, as good as sushi can get. My dad got a Berries and Bubbles and loved the flavor as well as the presentation (dry ice makes the martini bubble). While my dad was in the bathroom, I told our waitress it was his birthday and asked if she could take my credit card now since he would try to pay. She said since it was his birthday, what dessert would he want and I said the 10 layer carrot cake. Amazing cake! The thin layers makes it less carroty and more of cream cheese frosting flavor. Yum!Oh my gosh, what a great meal we had and for only $30 in the city (since she gave us the dessert complimentary for his birthday). You cannot beat it.",2,0,0,Meg G.,"Belchertown, MA",15,3,5

The salad was good size and the bisque was good. Scallop entree was delicious as the scallops were prepared perfectly. The sea bass dish for him was tasty and he felt it was on the smaller side (not much potatoes) but he enjoyed my scallops as well. We had to wait way to long for the carrot cake and were ready to pay check when it finally came. It was enormous and a masterpiece... sweet, but the sauce cut the sweetness, so it was also delicious.

4.0,12/10/2016,"My Dad was coming into town to come to a concert with me, so it was the perfect opportunity to finally try Ocean Prime out! I've been meaning to try it out for some time, and the pre-theatre menu really caught my eye for the value.They kinda squished us into a small two-top between two other tables (even though there were plenty of four-tops available), but it was already pretty busy and was only going to get busier, so, understandable. I was looking forward to catching up with my Dad though, and almost felt like I was sharing my conversation with the tables next to us since we were so close.We both started with cocktails, I had the Berries and Bubbly which was awesome! What a fun drink, but also delicious. Perfectly tart with a touch of sweetness. We had a Syrah with dinner which was lovely.The regular menu looks incredible (and the special our server mentioned sounded PHENOM), but both my Dad and I went with the pre-theatre menu. For starters I had the house salad (very good! Just a smidge overdressed, but the dressing was amazing, so I didn't mind) and my Dad had the French onion soup (which he kindly let me try and it was the clear winner. Really good).We both went with the 8 oz. filet (medium rare), I got the crab cake with corn succotash, he went with the scallops. Steak was cooked perfectly, but wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked. Crab cake was very good, but not even close to as good as the bite of my Dad's scallop. My Dad got the jalapeno gratin for a side (he didn't like it), I got the truffle mac and cheese (SINFULLY good. I want it again right now just writing about it). The service was really great! It seems as if they do the shared server thing, which isn't always the best, but both of the servers who rotated with us were really wonderful and attentive. One note--the music selection was very interesting haha. It was a lot of 2000s pop (which I love!), but seemed like an odd choice for an upscale seafood/steakhouse. Overall a great experience. Will likely go with the regular menu next time and nix the steak, but definitely would go back.",2,0,0,Jordan U.,"Manhattan, NY",59,13,1
5.0,12/8/2016,This place is delicious! Such a great atmosphere as well. My now fiancé brought me here after he popped the question in front of the Rockefeller tree. We had to wait a little longer than our reservation time but that didn't bother us one bit. Management was even nice enough to bring around complimentary appetizers while we waited.  Our server was Sam and she was excellent. Her recommendations were fabulous as well as her service. Crab cake appetizer was probably the best crab cake I've ever had and my fiancé is a Baltimore native. The steaks were cooked to perfection and you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't get the black truffle butter to compliment your cut of meat.

We primarily munched on the bread, requesting for another basket right before the food arrived. Upon the arrival of our food, our waiter disappeared for a long period of time, so I ordered another drink from a different staff member. I ordered a Cucumber Gimlet which was excellent. The salmon was good, however the flavor was TOO much. It was just over powering of a taste and I ate a bit but ultimately messed over it. My boyfriend thought the pork chop was excellent. Upon the completion of our food our waiter returned. We asked for the check and left. It's a very nice restaurant, classy setting, lovely ambience, but it leaves more to be desired.

2.0,10/20/2016,"After a week in NYC, we looked forward to a memorable dinner before heading home. Unfortunately, there were several issues with Ocean Prime. The ""Point Judith Calamari"" arrived drenched in the ""sweet chili sauce."" This was unfortunate, I wished the sauce came separate and poured over the calamari at the table. Because, by the time it was brought to the table, the calamari was soggy, salty, and luke warm. No crispy calamaris here...only soggy soupy ones. Unpalatable!!!I ordered the 6oz Filet Mignon for $44 and asked for a medium degree of doneness. My husband ordered the 8oz for $49 and also medium done. This is a steak restaurant charging hefty prices for their steaks. Our expectations were for them to serve us steaks that we ordered. Medium done - warm pink center. I was served a rare filet - cool red center. And my husband was served a medium well/well done filet - slightly pink center/little or no pink. We had the chophouse corn and sautéed button mushrooms for sides. The corn was good! The mushrooms were lacking flavor. Emeril Lagasse's Delmonico Steakhouse, in Las Vegas, has the best mushroom side, Sauteed Garlic Mushrooms. So delicious!!!The reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1 star has to do with the waitress. Wish I had gotten her name, so that I could refer to her by name. In any case, when I pointed out that my steak was rare, she apologized for their mistake. I told her I wanted her to know, and I'd try to eat it. While I did make an effort, I realized that there was no way I could eat it. As I was putting my plate to the side, our waitress came back and stated that she put in another order and the medium steak should be coming out shortly.

The fish came on a bed of cornbread and string beans, which complimented the snapper very well. Would come back.",0,0,0,GW S.,Hong Kong,2,61,57
5.0,4/13/2016,"Last week we dined at Ocean Prime in NYC and we were very impressed and can't wait to return. We asked to sit in the bar for apps and drinks since we were on a time crunch for getting to a concert. Our server was so sweet and knowledgeable and she made sure that we were enjoying ourselves while also keeping an eye on the clock b/c she knew we had limited time. The manager David stopped by to introduce himself and check in, which was much appreciated, and the chef Patrick came out to discuss my onion sensitivity. He wanted to be sure I was able to eat all that came out on the table. We were super impressed and it's these personal touches that made our dining experience so memorable. On top of the beautiful ambiance and stellar customer service, the food was AMAZING!! We ordered a bunch of apps and would reorder/recommend every single one of them. You really can't go wrong because everything was so delicious but if I had to pick a couple favorites, it would be the calamari and the surf and turf sea scallops and short rib. Yum! And there's a great cocktail and wine list to choose from, as well as some delightful desserts. Their desserts really are sooo good, especially their carrot cake.

She finally asked if we wanted to order. I asked her if they could put fish on any of the salads- she said yes but no more.  When I asked what kind of dressings they have, she responded ""what do you want?"" When we enquired about what type of dressings they offered she said we have ""lots of kinds."" OK, like what kind? She then responded ""We have everything. What do you want?"" We said ""Raspberry Vinaigrette?"" Her response- no we don't have that. Ugh. It was like pulling teeth through the entire meal.  The server was working overtime trying to be pretentious in an almost empty restaurant.  The place looks lovely but not worth the trip.",3,0,0,Lisa C.,"Washington, DC",0,32,2

Long cafeteria lights and the kitchen was so bright and on display from the dining room that the focus seemed to be to watch the kitchen the whole night. Decent sushi but the Kansas City steak was overcooked and not so tasty. Chocolate peanut butter dessert was a welcome surprise.

That would have been great if I were here for happy hour but we were more expecting a quiet low key restaurant to discuss work. That said, the hostess and waiters were wonderful. Service here is superb as everyone was thoroughly knowledgeable about the menu and we were met by our server almost immediately. Efficiency is perhaps a top plus for this place. I had to rush out for a second meeting and the waiter rushed my order in and served it with our starters without me having to remind him. I ordered the scallops with risotto which came out a tad on the salty side but you could taste the freshness in the scallops. Shared sides included sauteed mushrooms, lobster mashed potatoes, corn, steak fries, and tuna tar tar. The sides were delicious but the portions aren't large. Each starter or side could only be shared between 2-3 people. If you need something more quiet, I would suggest you request a room upstairs.

2.0,2/23/2016,"I don't know why I ever thought booking a Valentine's Day reservation at an upscale chain restaurant in midtown Manhattan would be a good idea. But the place looked classy, the menu looked great, and it's a brand new spot. I said ""why not"" and went ahead with it. Most of the time in life, you get what you pay for. Not so with Ocean Prime. I'll preface this by saying that appetizers, entrees, drinks, and sides for two people (plus tax + tip) comes out to almost $400 here. If you are charging New York steakhouse prices, you BETTER act like a New York steakhouse. Like I said before, the place looks very classy, and in-person perhaps even more so. The restaurant's website also lists the dress code as ""business casual,"" which to me means put on a jacket, a collared shirt, and dress jeans. Basically, match the atmosphere. But when we walked in, it looked like it was Casual Friday at a private high school in New Jersey. And I live in New Jersey now, so when I say this place brings in a TOTAL bridge & tunnel crowd, you better fucking believe me.Our reservation was at 10:00, but we weren't seated until close to 10:30. We did receive complimentary champagne for the trouble, which was definitely appreciated. When we did finally get seated, it was upstairs, which doesn't look as nice as the downstairs. It was also hot as hell up there -- as in 20-25 degrees higher than downstairs. Most people sitting at their tables were visually uncomfortable, as were we. Our waiter did ask us if it was too hot, and we said yes, and then the air got put on. But strangely, throughout our meal, the heat came up and down like a sine wave. Maybe the HVAC system is broken, but fix it before you charge me $400 for dinner for two.So the food wasn't terrible. It was actually pretty good -- my girlfriend's bone-in 12oz filet mignon was pretty phenomenal. My 16oz ribeye was decent; definitely a fattier piece than usual and somewhat undercooked to my liking but it was a pass and not a fail. My true problem lies with the service -- we ordered cocktails to start and by the time they arrived, we had received and devoured our appetizers. I'm a bit of a wine snob, I admit it. And I feel like a New York crowd at any pricey steakhouse would have a few of us in the dining room at any point. I wanted to enjoy a glass of a nice Napa cabernet with my ribeye so I told the waitress as she was clearing the table of appetizers to please make sure the wine comes with the steak. I don't like to be an asshole, and I would never make an issue of this normally, but the timing of the cocktails worried me.Of course, the waitress forgot about my wine, and I waited impatiently as my $60 ribeye got cold for about ten minutes before it finally came. This is so unacceptable at a New York steakhouse that I don't even know where to begin.Finally, as we were finishing up, we hear our waitress asking another table if they had any post-dinner plans. The neighboring couple didn't, and she then proceeded to tell them about a cool rooftop bar over on 5th Ave. They were like ""cool, okay, we're going home to go to bed since it's 12:30am on a Sunday night but thanks"" in the nicest way possible. The waitress then comes over to OUR table and pitches the EXACT SAME THING to us. What the fuck is this, a kickback agreement between two overrated and overpriced establishments? I mean I feel like I'm at Olive Garden in Times Square, and the waitress is pitching the big red tourist bus to every table she has, and then meets some dude out back for a cash exchange. Such a nightmare. Just get me out of here.I know this was a pretty harsh review. And I've given less-harsh reviews to restaurants that I also gave 1 star to. The reason Ocean Prime gets 2 stars is because the food is good here. The service, and the management, and the pricing, and basically everything else completely ruins the rest of the experience.If you're looking for a cool new trendy spot for steak and seafood, my advice is to keep looking.",7,4,1,Matt P.,"Philadelphia, PA",42,170,6
5.0,2/23/2016,"I came here for restaurant week with no expectations but thoroughly enjoyed myself. It was very packed on a Friday at 7:00 PM, and it took around 15 minutes to get seated. Although it is in a working district, the clientele was diverse and the atmosphere was pretty romantic/upscale - dim lighting, lots of mingling, high ceiling. Once we were seated, we ordered two cocktails - the Kentucky Rose ($16), and Berries and Bubbles ($17). I really enjoyed my berries and bubbles, as it was quite dramatic - with dry ice and the server pouring it right in front of me. One of the highlights of my night was the bread basket that came. It was served warm, and there were two different types of bread - one was pretzel-like but still soft, and the other was the best sourdough bread I've ever had! I knew I should have saved room in my stomach for the rest of dinner, but I almost finished the whole bread basket by myself. For the appetizer, I ordered the lobster bisque, which I thought was well done, but was slightly too salty and had little lobster meat. For the entree, I ordered the scallops with risotto. I enjoyed that the scallops were cooked perfectly, and the lemon and herb seasoning that complemented both so well. As for dessert, I ordered the famous carrot cake, which definitely met expectations - it was moist and the frosting was not too sweet, but I actually preferred the peanut butter pie more (I'm partial to chocolate mousse done well). I would come here again on a special occasion to splurge on the full menu as I enjoyed the atmosphere and the food.",1,0,1,Tiffany A.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",435,31,42
5.0,2/19/2016,"I came here with my sister during the past restaurant week and everything was great. First of all the place is surprisingly large, big open bar in the front, where my sister casually enjoyed a drink while waiting for me. Then we were lead to our table in another large open room. It was a Tuesday or Wednesday so it wasn't crowded and perhaps more quite than usual. Now I find that when a place is slow the service tends to slack off as well but this was not the case, far from it. All of the little things, water refills, clearing our table between courses etc, were spot on. And our waiter, who was adorable was very sweet, attentive and well versed in their wine and food menus. Now the other thing is that places during restaurant week tend to disappoint with uninspired pre fixes. But everything we ordered was delicious! The soup and calamari for apps and fish and steak entrees we superb. Then the desserts really topped everything off. All of the offerings were standard but made with a little flair or unexpected spice. Nothing too crazy but excellent. The whole evening was everything I want in a dining experience.

I'm thinking to myself does she have a hat on. So, the hostess that seated us and them walks past. I ask her why does she have a hat on. She says I will tell her now. So, the woman says something to the hostess and does not take off her hat. So, I put my hat back on. The same hostess, Alisa, seated both of us allowed her to walk in the dining room with her hat on and seated her without an issue. I was completely offended. I kindly asked the waiter for the manager. The manager, Tricia, apologized profusely and explained the policy is only towards baseball caps and the waitress must have been confused. She gave me her business card and continued to apologize. As we were getting our coats from coat check, the waitress says to us the reason the other patron could not take her hat off is because it was attached to her head.

The steak looked appetizing it had a nice charred crust on the top. But no flavor. It was as if all the tasty juices from the beef had been taken out of it. My Girl ordered a King Crab legs.

4.0,2/6/2016,"My fiance and I went here last night for restaurant week.  Even though we had a reservation for 7:15, we weren't seated until 7:30, which surprised us considering the room we were seated in was only half full.  So we sat at the bar and ordered a drink.  My fiance had a glass of the Malbec, Terrazas de los Andes, Reserva,  Mendoza, Argentina, 2012 and I had the Merlot, Sterling, ""Vintner's Collection,"" Central Coast, California, 2013 - both were excellent.  Once we were seated, she had the lobster bisque and I had the french onion soup. Both were good, but we thought the french onion was better as the lobster bisque barely had any lobster in it.  We each had the 6 oz filet mignon as our main course.  It was amazing and I inhaled mine, however, I think they were very cheap with the portions, and I honestly think the filet was really 4-5 oz instead, which really annoyed us.  This is why I cannot rate this place 5 stars.For dessert, we each had the 5 layer carrot cake which was delicious and really hit the spot.  It was very rich and had this amazing pineapple glaze.  Also, I forgot to mention how once we were seated, I ordered a Kentucky Rose.  This was definitely one of the best mixed drinks I've ever had.  My fiance ordered whichever Cabernet was on the restaurant week menu for $12.  This was quite possibly the worst glass of wine we each have ever had.  It felt like crumbling up $12 and throwing it down the toilet.  Anyway, this place is definitely worth trying and will be satisfying.  Just avoid whichever wine is on the restaurant week menu.",1,1,0,Matthew V.,"New York, NY",6,205,0

4.0,2/3/2016,"Ocean Prime overall score: 88I rolled through Ocean Prime for a quick NYC Restaurant Week meal one night after work with a friend of mine. They were booked solid, so we grabbed a seat in the lounge area near the bar to eat. While the menu was limited to a small filet for restaurant week (in terms of beef), I figured it was a good opportunity to test-drive the steakhouse before going balls-deep with a big rib eye. Here's what I thought:Flavor: 9The filet was delicious, and was cooked to an absolutely perfect medium rare. It had a good seasoned outside, and the inside was juicy and flavorful. While the outside wasn't super crisp, it still managed to hold in all the juices.I'm looking forward to heading back for a proper rib eye. I have to say... for a place to score an 88 on a test run with a severely limited restaurant week menu... I'm impressed.Choice of Cuts & Quality Available: 7Three filets, two strips and a rib eye are offered here. There is no beef porterhouse. I have to take a few points for that. The menu indicates that all steaks are prime quality, but nothing is noted about aging. Perhaps a few more bone-in options would also beef up the selection here as well.Portion Size & Plating: 8Portions are slightly smaller than most places for the price range of midtown steak joints. The plating is elegant and clean, nothing too fancy.Price: 8This is an expensive joint, with a small 8oz filet coming in at almost $50, however their most expensive steak is $57, a 12oz ""bone-in filet,"" so the range isn't too wide. In any case, they do participate in NYC Restaurant Week, where they offer a three-course meal for $38 that includes an app, an entree, two sides and a dessert.Bar: 10This is a great bar for hanging out after work. The crowd is all suits from Bankville, USA, but the space is beautifully apportioned and you can watch the street from the well-lit seating arrangement.Specials and Other Meats: 8There's lamb, chicken, and a pork porterhouse in terms of other meats. That's a nice showing, especially considering that this place is a bit lighter on the beef selections and a bit heavier on the seafood selections.Apps, Sides & Desserts: 9I had the Point Judith calamari, which was perfectly breaded and fried to a golden crisp, and drizzled with just the right amount of sweet chili sauce. It also comes with roasted cashews, which nails home the distinct Asian dimension to the dish.My steak came with mashed potatoes and green beans for the restaurant week menu, so I got to taste a few items. Both were good, but nothing incredible.The desserts, however, were a different story. I tried both the peanut butter mousse with chocolate ganache, and the carrot cake, which Ocean Prime is famous for at this point. Del Frisco's has the lemon cake. Strip House has the chocolate cake. Ocean Prime has the carrot cake, which i shy far my favorite, and I DO love the lemon cake at Del's. Typically, the cake is 10 layers high and a massive wedge. This restaurant week portion was just right for me, as I was already kind of full. The frosting had a great fall-spice to it, and the cake was moist without being too dense.The peanut butter and chocolate pie was good too, but too sweet for my liking. It was light due to the mousse element, though, which is nice. It was also beautiful to look at.Seafood Selection: 10There's a shitload of great looking seafood here. The menu is too extensive to list them all. I was able to try some of the scallops that my buddy ordered, and so far I'm impressed.When I return, I'll definitely be trying more seafood. I like the idea of a steak joint that really raises the bar on the seafood. A lot of places just do lobster and salmon, shrimp and oysters. They don't go outside the box. Here it is a totally different seafood experience. And it is perfect place for dates: the men can eat their red meat, and the women can watch their figure with some seafood, because sexism rules.Service: 10Even in the busy and crowded bar area, we had excellent service. The first course came out fast, and the waitress, Jenny, was really nice and attentive. The fun part about sitting in the bar area is that they give you a free bowl of popcorn, which is wonderfully seasoned. The bread, by the way, is delicious. You get piping hot pretzel bread logs and bread with a soft, whipped butter. Excellent.Ambiance: 9While the main dining room is a big cast and industrial looking, it still has a nice feel to it. It's spacious, which is good, but it just lacks a little bit of character. One thing that's cool is that  you can view how the kitchen operates by peeking though the long glass window that is visible from the dining room.",3,1,3,JohnnyPrimeC. C.,"Manhattan, NY",199,213,4300
2.0,2/3/2016,"Ah, Ocean Prime. The newest addition to that soulless corridor on 6th between 42nd and 52nd that forms the natural habitat of lawyers, bankers and the thieves that love them. Another expense-account kitchen that attracts the platinum-carded debris that's exhaled from office buildings at 6:30, everything about this place just groans with indifference. As my friend and I walked in last night, I honestly had the impression that I had been there before, though I eventually realized that my deja-vu was just the sad realization that almost every element of this establishment had been recycled from bits and pieces of other, better restaurants. Sigh. I often wonder what it is about midtown that acts as imagination-repellent. I understand the rents are high, but do literally all of the restaurants have to be insipid clones of the same steakhouse? I have to go to these places a lot for business/work drinks/etc, and sometimes get the irrational impression that I'm stuck in one of those dystopian nightmare flicks where the protagonist keeps on descending into deeper and deeper layers of madness - like Inception except with steak. Every time I think I've escaped, there's just more steak.  At any rate, I digress. On to the particular mediocrity of the actual food, wine, ambience, et al.We ordered the usual assortment of wine and cocktails, followed by a sampling of appetizers - the traditional ""booze-as-food-group"" supper for the finance set. I was confused by the lamb ""lollipops"", which seemed to resemble actual lollipops only because of (a) the bone sticking out, and (b) the fact that this was the worst appetizer in the same way that lollipops are the worst candy. The deviled eggs were actually pretty good, but their relative charm only served to highlight the drabness of the sliders and the utter despair of the crabcake. The whiskey cocktail appeared to contain only trace amounts of whiskey. The wine list wasn't even trying. I swear it seemed bored with itself, offering no particular point of view on anything, just a few listlessly inoffensive mid-range bottles. I drank anyway, of course. But with booze, sometimes it's the destination that's important, not the journey. As for the ambience/decor/service, it was, if possible even more profoundly pedestrian than the food. Sat at the bar so my friend and I could chat and watched as our bartender moved seamlessly between one group of mildly harassing customers on the left side of the bar to another one on the right, a bit like a goldfish in a bowl, if the bowl was made of aging corporate d-bags. She seemed serene as she went about her service and I tipped her extra, just for her ability to tolerate the crowd. The scene/decor itself was suburban, as another reviewer put it, and as I drank my lazily selected Pinot I couldn't help but wonder if the designer of the space took his imagination out back to shoot it before working on this project. Quite honestly, the brushed brass rings on the ceiling, the dark wood panelling, the dark-on-dark color palate, was all so banal and derivative I couldn't even be bothered to actively hate it. That, after all, would have been more effort than the proprietors of this place put into the entire restaurant. To sum up in brief: The Banana Republic of expense-account food, kind of a low-rent Del Frisco's with inexplicable  sushi. One star for competent, if put-upon service. The other for the truffled deviled eggs, which actually managed to taste like someone in the kitchen cared whether you lived or died.

So glad we did!We were seated right away and someone came and took drink orders. We were a group of three, and ended up with 2 soups and a salad as appetizer. The french onion soup was huge, enough to share, but a bit skimpy on the cheese for the $13 price tag. The house salad looked good, no complaints there. The two men shared the 24oz porterhouse special and mashed potatoes and I got the grouper. It was a really generous serving of fish in a light lemon butter sauce with gnocchi (which was handmade) and pieces of lobster. I ate very small bites as I wanted to savor as long as possible! I got a bite of the porter and it was also very well cooked, tender and perfect temperature. The mashed potatoes were eh, nothing spectacular. We only ordered vanilla ice cream for dessert, but it melted as we waited to be brought a spoon. It wasn't anything great, not Haagen Daz (which for the price, I expected) but tasted more like Breyers. I get it, it's vanilla ice cream what did we expect, but something creamier rather than icy. Oh well.Overall, service was ok, our waitress didnt seem to listen to well (i asked to recommendations between the salmon and the grouper....she recommended the filet mignon. Someone else asked for recommendation between the french onion soup and the lobster bisque....she recommended the tuna tartar. that kinda thing.)Overall it was a great meal. Worth the price tag?

The overall ambiance and service were excellent. The customized four-course menu was the most delightful thing of that night! First Course: their calamari, crab cakes and sushi rolls are rather pleasant, with ingredients well selected and delicately prepared. Second Course: house salad and lobster bisque are carefully flavored and are the best matches to the menu. Third Course: the 12-oz bone-in fillet was perfectly seasoned, aged and accurately cooked. Dessert: I had their Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie (peanut butter mousse, bittersweet chocolate ganache), and this guy was the star of this menu; the texture and flavor of this dessert was all done to perfection; even though I was almost full half way through the four courses, I couldn't stopping eating this lovely chocolate mousse!

The result was very dry and flavorless. The steak was ordered medium rare but, like the pork, was so way over cooked. There was zero pink in it. They did redo one of the fish dishes making it better; we didn't feel it was worth it to send THE ENTIRE group's order back. Seriously? How can you screw up every order?

5.0,11/21/2015,"I will mention that I was here for a 1-month anniversary social media influencer party, so it may not be 100% accurate as to a typical meal.First thing I noticed was the level of professionalism of the staff. The front receptionists greeted us warmly and directed us to the coat check. The lady running the coat check was very friendly and we had a short chat. Then we walked into the glass room in the back where the Sips and Seafood event was being held. We enjoyed pretty much an open bar and the waiter Channing was one of the most knowledgeable servers I have ever met. I wasn't drinking too much that night, but I listened to his descriptions and recommendations for all the whiskey drinkers at my table and poured them exactly what they were looking for. I ordered the Berries and Bubbles mostly because the dry ice and floating blueberries looked so cool.The food was over-the-top phenomenal. Starting with some raw tuna bites, the evening transpired into a culinary, gourmet buffet as spicy tuna rolls, lobster rolls, crab cakes, beef sliders, fried calimari, and more rolled into the room. There was a sushi chef in the back who made pretty much an unlimited quantity of sushi and our servers kept our drinks full to the brim. The Lamb Chops Lollipops, without exaggeration, was the best lamb dish I have ever tried. It had absolutely zero gamey taste to the point that I thought it was beef at first. Very moist and juicy, the lollipops are full of flavor (I'd say maybe an Asian marinade?). Then came the gargantuan chilled seafood towers stuffed with crab meat, crab legs, shrimp, and lobster. They were seriously rolling out the red carpet here. The seafood was all very fresh and plentiful - two towers were enough for a room of 15+.They also brought out some lobster mashed potatoes and savory truffle mac-and-cheese. One of the hostesses told us that the mac was crack. And it was. We were piling it onto our plates as though the world was ending. The mac-and-cheese definitely stole the show.Make sure you save room for dessert because their spread is unbeatable. The delicious peanut butter pie, baked alaska, and 10-layer carrot cake were no laughing matter. While all three were made to perfection, it was the carrot cake that made me fall in love. Normally I dislike carrot cake because of its dry, crumby taste, but Ocean Prime's was excellent. The pineapple syrup poured over the top loosens up the cake and creates a wonderful, sweet experience.The wonderful staff, beautiful ambiance, and perfect food are just some of the few reasons to check out Ocean Prime!",3,1,3,Justin Y.,"Washington, DC",801,355,90

4.0,11/17/2015,"Ocean Prime finally makes its way to NYC, and I was impressed. Steakhouses are a dime a dozen in this city, and one has to be wary of a restaurant that has only been open for a week weeks, but nearly every aspect of our experience here was spot-on. The decor is okay, more of a glossy STK feel that a typical clubby steakhouse (the spirit of the great Ben Benson's rests in this space) and the wine list was decent, but the service and the food were terrific. We decided to splurge and began with the caviar, which was a typical presentation (toast points, eggs, sour cream, etc.) and of a good quality. I was told the Lobster Bisque was excellent and the caesar salad was dressed well. The steaks were cooked to melt-in-your-mouth perfection and the option to have them served with shrimp scampi on top was superb. One at our table got the Florida Stone Crabs for an entree and they looked (and tasted, apparently) gorgeous. The sorbet, chocolate cake, and creme brûlée were all delicious.

But I think the skin of the steak is a little too salty, so when the manager dropped by and asked for our feedbacks, I gave an honest opinion, by which I didn't mean for a take-off from the bill. However, the second time the manager showed up with the dessert we ordered and an extra gift from him, he told us that the steak had been taken care of and off the bill. We were so surprised and appreciative. Then he explained the origin of this restaurant to us that the owner of the place wants to make sure everyone that comes into the restaurant feels the hospitality of the Ohioans. It definitely left us an impressive memory to this place. I left a what-it-should-be tip to our waiter so everyone is happy.

5.0,11/14/2015,"It isn't often you get to say that you had a restaurant experience that was perfect from beginning to end, but my experience at Ocean Prime was one of them.  I was meeting a group for a birthday dinner but I arrived early.  This allowed me to spend some time at the bar enjoying a couple drinks beforehand.  The hostess was immediately welcoming and after a quick coat check I hung out at the bar to enjoy my cocktail.  I had the Whiskey Clover, described on the menu as ""Gentleman Jack Whiskey, Hennessy VS, Honey Water,Hand-Squeezed Lemon & Orange"".  You'd think with a description like that the drink would've been overly sweet, but instead it was just the right balance of citrus sweetness and whiskey flavor.  I really enjoyed it.As I sat at the bar I looked around the bar area which includes several comfortable, circular booths and tall tables.  The bar area alone could accommodate a party.  The decor manages the hat trick of looking sophisticated but not pretentious.  The combination of dark wood, white counters, medium tone furniture and dim lighting creates a comfortable atmosphere that feels rich, but not in an off putting manner.  The environment lends itself to everything from after work drinks with colleagues to a date.Eventually my friends began to arrive and we all got to talking - so much so we didn't realize that it was taking a rather long time to get to our table (we had a reservation - I highly recommend you make one).  The manager came up to us and was very gracious, offering us the use of the private dining room near the bar area (dubbed the ""Rockefeller Room"") since they had made us wait so long.  We of course accepted and happily sat down for a very different experience than we had expected!The Rockefeller Room could easily accommodate a small office party of about 10-12 people.  There is a large, round table with a huge lazy susan in the middle.  There is a flat screen TV mounted on the wall and tasteful decor is the order of the day in the brightly lit room.  Our waiter was absolutely professional and on point the entire night.  It wasn't just a matter of making sure our glasses were full of water.  His manner and event he way he addressed us spoke volumes about the training the staff had gone through.  We were all very impressed.Okay, enough talk about the room and bar etc.  What did I eat?  Here's a list of what I got to have:FILET MIGNONNot wanting to be a complete glutton, I went with the 8oz filet mignon, medium rare.  The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  While you can order items on top of the steak such as black truffle butter, I wanted it straight to taste it in its most pure form.  I'm really glad I did.  When I cut the meat it was like butter and it was perfectly tender.  There was just the right amount of seasoning to make your taste buds happy but not overwhelm them.  It was also truly medium rare with pink in the middle.JALAPENO AU GRATINA side dish, this comes in a rather large bowl and there was enough that all six people at the dinner were able to get a couple forkfuls of this spicy dish.  Jalapenos generally can go two ways: either there is a kick or there isn't.  In this dish there definitely was along with some savory flavor.PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIESOther restaurants have this and I've had it many times.  Most of the time they are shoestring fries and there's not a lot of substance to them.  Not so here!  These fries were *huge* and the cheese layer was obvious from several feet away.  These were absolutely addicting.  Be warned, you can't just eat a couple!CREAMED SPINACHWhat could have been a typical creamed spinach is elevated by a smokey element inside the dish.  Most of us agreed it was likely bacon, but there were no bacon bits to be found.  Whatever the case may be, this was a very uncommon creamed spinach that was full of flavor.BLACK TRUFFLE MAC N' CHEESEI only got to have one bite of this, but it was full of flavor.  The cheese was creamy and salty and the truffle flavor was definitely assertive.  TEN LAYER CARROT CAKEA signature dessert, this cake was *truly* 10 layers.  It was a literal tower of goodness.  The cake was so moist that you could push a fork through all ten layers and it didn't tip over.  It tasted delicious and surprisingly had no raisins in it.CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER PIEPeanut Butter Mousse and Bittersweet Chocolate Ganache  come together to make one of the most delicious desserts I've had in ages.  The mousse is perfectly delicate but full of flavor while the ganache gives just the right amount of sweetness to balance the savory mousse.  Special shout out to the coffee and bread basket - both of which could easily be overlooked in any restaurant, but here they were exceptional.  The bread basket had amazing pretzel sticks (fresh baked!) and the coffee was french pressed!I really enjoyed my experience at Ocean Prime and I can't wait to go back!",38,18,32,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",393,1300,917
