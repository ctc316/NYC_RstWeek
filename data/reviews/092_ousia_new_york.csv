3.0,3/24/2019,"The decor is very modern with a combination of standard tables, high tables, booths adn a bar seating. However, seating next to the window (in winter) be prepared to put your coat or a scarf on - the insulation is very poor and you feel the cold air coming in very quickly.  The service was ok: waiters and the host were friendly but we had to ask multiple times to have water refilled as noone was paying attention. Now, on to the food. We had a tzatziki dip (4 stars), which is supposed to come with grilled pita, which in our case was overgrilled/almost burnt. Next we tried the steamed lamb buns - those were amazing! A little bit of a kick to the sauce, but just enough, not too hot, and the combo with the onions and the meat was 5 stars! Next was octopus, which looked better than it tasted. It was soft, no complaints around that, but I felt it was overboiled to a point where it lost its flavor and the sauce was pretty bland as well - 3 stars in my book (that said, I am an octopus snob so my bar is rather high ). We topped it off with hanger steak (4 stars, a bit too chewy for my liking, but nice presentation, liked the sauce which was not overpowering, and loved a few shishito peppers on the side) and truffle oil fries with feta cheese (yammie while hot). No space for desert since the portions are decent size! Overall verdict: was fun to check it out, but for the real yammie greek food I'd choose the Greek Kitchen a few blocks away.",0,0,0,Y A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,11,21

I had the pan roasted chicken and my bf had the lamb chops. We had two really good drinks. I had the Ousia mule and he had something kind of spices. And you must try the truffle oil fries!!

4.0,3/15/2019,"I've eaten here several times and thoroughly enjoyed the food, service and ambiance. It's close to my office but worth the trip to the far West Side.I've enjoyed their beet ravioli, grilled octopus and fries.  But my favorite were the dips and pita.  Edamame pistachio, tzatziki and the most heavenly, garlicky hummus that had me still dreaming about it  the next day. I don't eat lamb, but my colleagues raved about it.  My only complaint is the pricey wine by the glass.  But each time I was unsure about my choice, I was offered pours of Greek wines I might not have tried.  I look forward to my next meal at Ousia.",0,0,0,Sandy B.,"Summit, NJ",0,15,0
4.0,3/11/2019,"My sisters and I had dinner here last week. As it was later in the evening we opted for shareables as opposed to individual entrees. We started with three dips: edamame pistachio, hummus, and tzatziki, served with warm pita. Each dip was extremely tasty. Next we shared a wild mushroom flatbread that was very flavorful and cooked to perfection. We had an order of fries for the table and added the Greek Village Salad, which was made up of tomato, cucumber, red onion, Kalamata olives, capers, and feta cheese and mixed with an olive oil and oregano-based dressing. It was amazing! Everything was delicious and well-prepared. As I mentioned it was later in the evening and we didn't want to get weighed down with heavy food, so our selections were perfect in keeping things light. Our meal was an elegant sufficiency! It's easy to recommend Ousia. The food is tremendous, the drinks are thoughtfully prepared, and the service is top-notch. Will definitely return.",0,0,0,Cindy R.,"Littleton, MA",47,255,229

2.0,2/25/2019,"Went for Valentine's Lunch knowing they had $22 prix fixe.  Details impressive, faux brick and wood panelling, staff in jeans and denim aprons (versus usual boring black shirted staff), uncrowded tabling).  Location near bus and several blocks from subway, so car or cab is best; parking on same block.  Bathrooms on same floor and roomy. We started with tzatziki.  It was excellent and the super hot pita accompaniment was abundant and fresh.  Best item of the meal. A ""Paloma"" drink was $14--OK.  One of us had the prix fixe.  Limited choices; chose avgolemono soup and grilled chicken souvlaki.  Both were 2/5.  The soup was watery, contained scallions (??) and maybe 5 grains of orzo at the very bottom.  Not lemony and scarce on chicken.  But key was it was not at all tasty, even though salty.  The grilled chicken souvlaki was a disaster  It was not nearly grilled enough, if at all.  No grill marks, no char flavor, somewhat tough and tasteless notwithstanding some dressing on top (presumably garlic yogurt?).  Three skewers each with a couple of chicken cubes and minimal veggies (tomatoes and onions the size of postage stamps)  Not much char on veggies either.  How does an allegedly Greek restaurant screw up chicken soup and souvlaki?  It did not come with any pita.   My partner ordered grilled octopus. ($24) which was charred beyond recognition--the way we like it, tho some may not.  However, the trick is quick sear and keep meat tender; not accomplished here.  The inner meat was tough from being overcooked.  The portion was on the small side.  Dessert was decaf coffee and three scoops of sorbet.  Interesting flavors but none tasted good, just blah.  Water was filled only when asked to and lemons had to be requested for octopus.  Really?   Bill for 2 with tax and tip $118.",0,0,0,Chris L.,"New York, NY",5,117,27
5.0,2/23/2019,"Giving five star for decor, price and service. This place looks beautiful from the moment you step inside. We were greeted immediately and brought to a table of our choice- great for large parties or even business/colleagues. Being a vegetarian, you can never go wrong with Mediterranean food. I like the different options in appetizers, small and medium plates here. But I loved the lunch prefix option because for $22 you can get an appetizer and entree, which was totally worth it. The server knew the menu options well and his recommendations were on point. I recommend the roasted red pepper spread- it's so good! The pita comes out super warm and toasty. This spread has a good mild kick to it and a creamy texture, probably due to the feta cheese. I would definitely recommend this! Then, I got the beet ravioli, and I loved it! The beet was not too overwhelming, and the kale addition was so tasteful. It's in a buttery sauce, which was borderline a little too salty for me, but nonetheless tasty. Maybe I'll ask for less salt next time. My favorite part was the baklava (sp?) - this was apparently the most popular item on the menu and I can totally see why. I've had baklava before but never this good. It's presentation was nice, they come out so warm (although I wish it was slightly more crispy), I liked the addition of ground up pistachio and the vanilla ice cream was amazing. I don't know what it was about the ice cream but it had a nutmeg/cinnamon flavor to it. Totally recommend this!!!",1,0,0,Sneha T.,"New York, NY",351,51,99

5.0,1/4/2019,"We came for brunch, so I can only speak to that, but my entire group really enjoyed this place.  Collectively we had The Gyro Hash, the Shashuka, and The Greek Diner.  For appetizers, we chose three of their dips (The Eggplant dip, the Pistachio Dip, and their Tzatziki Dip).  All the dips were very good and the pita it came with was very hot as if it had just been cooked with a nice brown finish on the bottom.  It tasted freshly made and was served with a generous portion.  When we ran out, they brought more without being asked.  The inside of Ousia is very nice and clean.  It looks like a great place for a group dinner or a date.  The bathrooms were also very nice and clean.  They had a large bar with any beverage you could really want.  For brunch they had single mimosa options or a bottomless choice.  They also had a great bloody mary.  I opted for the coffee instead and it was a very nice dark blend that had been freshly made. I ordered the gyro hash which was potatoes, some julienne vegetables, lamb meat, and an egg my way on top.  It was all very good.  My friend was able to order the Greek Diner and substitute the side of meat and sausage for a salad to keep it vegetarian.  The staff overall were very accommodating and attentive.  Our table also had the shashuka which had a great flavor and was served with strips of toast.  It had a lot of sausage in it so it was still very filling even though a light dish overall.  I would recommend Ousia to anyone who enjoys greek food.  It's very affordable, quality food in a clean and pretty environment.",0,0,0,Brett D.,"Saint Louis, MO",387,84,375

Atmosphere - AService = A-Food quality - D+Price - CThis place is too expensive for the quality of food they're serving. Our bill with tip came to $260 for 4 of us.  Service was good and it was a beautiful quiet setting.Two of us ordered the grilled octopus.  The first bite wasextremely fishy taste, over-charred and rubbery. Nearly inedible. We waited all nightto see whether we would get food poisoning--I almost toldmy partner to send it back but it was a birthday dinner and wedidn't want to ruin the dinner.  I ordered scallops which wereedible but my partner thought had a very strange texture - as if they had been frozen and thawed and perhaps the middle was under cooked. The appetizers were mediocre.  They should not be charging $16-20 for these small plates.  The ingredients and food quality doesnot seem as if any of this stuff was made from scratch.  We will not return.  We were charmed by the cozy atmosphere butwhat the atmosphere provided asw quickly lost on the quality of food.

4.0,12/6/2018,I've only got delivery here and am super impressed with the food. The whole fish is moist and flavorful even without the aioli on the side. The octopus is cooked very well and they give you baby octopus which tastes sweeter in my opinion. The edamame dip is really light and addicting. The only thing I didn't quite like was the spanakopita which for whatever reason come in bite-sized triangles and resemble spring rolls far from a traditional spinach pie.,2,0,1,Joy Y.,"New York, NY",266,824,1216

Interior design and decor was amazing. Felt mediterranean but refined and modern. Comfortable booths and easily got a table at noon on a Saturday.2. My cocktail was so tasty! I think it was called Far West Side and featured vodka, cucumber, and a Greek liqueur. It was so well balanced and tasty (and pretty!) My mom and sister got ""build your own mimosa"" which is served with a glass champagne and flutes of juice so you can mix it the way you like it. I love this touch because everyone likes their mimosas a certain way. 3. Service - our server was excellent, friendly, and knowledgeable. He had us laughing the whole time!4.

1.0,10/14/2018,This is the first time I am writing a strong negative review. The restaurant has the look and feeling of a chain restaurant. The noise of the kitchen comes right into the dining room. There is a man who stands in the actual center of the dining room setting up place settings clanking silverware and moving them to tables even though the restaurant on a Saturday night at 8:30 was not very busy.  All the clanking was very annoying. The restaurant found it difficult to help me with my food allergy and after 45 minutes being served nothing our appetizers were served not hot and one burnt.  The owners son as he introduced himself to me was clueless.

It was obvious that he wasn't excited about that. We felt like they weren't happy to have us there... Food was just ok, nothing special. We ordered grilled salmon and it wasn't great, there was some smell in it (I wouldn't say it was spoiled but it just tasted weird). Not to mention that the staff never came to check on us while we were there, we had to call them and ask to bring the check. Once we finally got the check, we saw the regular price on it even tho we came for restaurant week and been ordering from restaurant week menu.

The alcoholic drinks were brought out before the appetizers, but the non-alcoholic drinks came only after the entrées were served. Desserts came out before the coffees.

Service was pretty fast and the servers were very friendly and were happy to assist. The food was really good!

1.0,4/7/2018,"Came here for dinner last night again and had the worst experience. From the appetizers to the main courses the dinner just kept going downhill. We ordered the Greek salad to start. The salad arrives as huge pieces of tomatoes and cucumbers smothered in dressing with a block in feta cheese on top. For a $15+ salad one would think there would be more substance to it. We sent the salad back with our waiter asking for lettuce to be added to make more like a ""salad.""  Instead of honoring our request he sends the chef out to educate us on how Greek salads are served in Greece. We are not in Greece we are NYC. After some back and forth with the chef we tell her that if she cannot add lettuce to the salad we will just send it back. She agrees to add the lettuce. The salad comes back out and it has 3-4 little flimsy pieces of lettuce in it. We barely touched the salad at that point. After the terrible appetizer it took over 40 mins to receive our main courses. I again ordered the mussels and my boyfriend ordered the dorado fish deboned and filleted. My mussels come out COLD on a hot plate and the fish comes as a whole with the head attached and bones still in it. At that point we've both had enough and asked for a manager to pay for our drinks and not eaten salad and go somewhere else for dinner. The manager was nice and ended comping our meal.

The desert they have here is really good and Greek inspired. I can definitely say the baklava platter was my favorite dish to eat here.The place is pretty spacious with a lot of seating and nice music. At first it felt empty around 5pm when I entered but when it crept to 7pm it picked up a lot bigger crowd but didn't feel crowded. 5pm - 7pm by the way is around when happy hour happens which I think maybe the best time to go to not break your wallet when ordering drinks.The drinks and cocktails here are good.

3.0,11/11/2017,"Ousia has great Greek-inspired cuisine. The restaurant is spacious and is great for dinner with large groups or even if you are looking for something more intimate.The edamame pistachio spread is good. It has a good consistency and the real pistachios and edamame garnishments add texture. In my opinion, the nuttiness of the pistachio did not really resonate, but the pita bread was just so good.The octopus entree has a nice char to it, adding smokiness tamed by the bit of puree and vegetables it comes with. However, it was not anything different from any other Greek restaurant. The lamb roulade was flavourful and seasoned well; however, it came out cold. The rooster makaronia is seasoned with marjoram pesto, which has a very distinct and interesting flavour. The combination of flavours with the graviera cheese and meat made for a tasty dish. Lastly, the avgolemono chicken soup was hearty with a refreshing citrus flavour. The mussels and fries were a disappointment. The fries had no flavour to them despite being covered in red and black spices. While the presentation of the mussels was great, the briny taste of the mussels was lost in the thick, creamy broth.The service was not stellar. One of the servers spilled pork grease on the table and my friend's arm when placing the lamb chops on the table. She did not notice until we informed her.

Well, the food at Ousia is somewhat Greek; not really very authentic Greek, but still delicious and beautifully presented. The portions are fairly small and the prices high for what is served.I had shrimp with artichokes and carrots, and it was really good. My husband had mussels, with ""Greek fries"" on the side.

You can order a choice of three items from the appetizer menu, which we did; we added a fourth choice as well. All the appetizer choices - except for the taramasalata - were good, but the servings were miniscule. The taramasalata was very runny, liquid really, and completely tasteless.

Unfortunately, the food we ordered was not that impressive.. The three sampler appetizer can be skipped, neither hummus,  nor tzatziki blew me away- very average. As to lamb roulade and sea scallops, they were a little bit better. Yet, the lamb lacked side dish and crispy code could have more flavor to the crusting.

3.0,8/30/2017,"I had such high hopes for this place after reading the recent reviews.  The meal started off well with two classy cocktails, but the pours were very small for the price charged.  I was disappointed to learn the the Striped Bass Moussaka I was dying to try was no longer on the menu.  They redeemed themselves with the incredible Pistachio Edamame Hummus Dip with Warm Pita.  I went with the Grilled Octopus and my boyfriend choose the burger.  The octupus was good, but the portion was so small for the price that it should be considered an appetizer.  The burger was acceptable, but had an off-taste. The lemon potatoes that came with the burger were a highlight.  Overall, I've definitely had better Greek food in NYC and at a much better price.  In my opinion, this place is just over-hyped and lacks the traditional dishes I know and love.",1,0,0,Ally B.,"Manhattan, NY",13,218,515

5.0,8/14/2017,"I came to Ousia to see what all the buzz has been about surrounding this up and coming new restaurant and I was blown away by what I found. This Mediterranean gem boasts an impressive central bar with ample space and a soothing ambiance. The restaurant was bustling with people but it not feel cramped at all. There was a large party in a reserved section of the restaurant that my waiter informed me was a performer who was playing a show at the nearby Terminal 5 later in the night. This will definitely be my go to spot before any Terminal 5 events that I attend in the future. The food was on par or better than any of the fine dining establishments I have frequented throughout New York City. The rich combination of flavors serenaded my palette and left me feeling both satisfyingly full and craving both of the delicious fare that I had the privilege of enjoying.My table started with a selection of some of the creative and innovative dips that showcased the restaurants Greek roots. We then had the mushroom flatbread and the Cretan flatbread that absolutely floored everyone at my table. They were not too heavy but the sauce, cheese and toppings exploded with farm fresh flavor. In between courses the manager came to my table and we got to talking. He was engaging, hospitable, and really took the time to make me feel welcome.  During our conversation he mentioned that his grandfather, the restaurant's owner, brought vegetables from his personal garden to the restaurant everyday.  Soon after my table received an order of the best stuffed zucchini flowers I have ever tasted in my life... on the house. I regret to inform you that these delights are not available on the menu due to their limited and personal nature.  Every one of the entrees that my table ordered was absolutely picturesque, which I insisted on documenting and including in this review (it was also an excuse for me to try them all). I had the branzino tartare, a dish that I had not previously seen done, and I extremely pleased with my selection. The vinegar chips added a perfect addition to the branzino that tasted as if it had been just pulled out of the water. The octopus was extraordinarily tender and the scallops were paired with a luscious buttery sauce. The mushroom ravioli was rich and the cavatelli bologenese elevated a basic dish into something worthy of very high praise. I have gotten so worked up about this amazing food that I have failed to do justice to the phenomenal wine that accompanied our meal. We had a Greek Syrah blend followed by a white selection curtesy of a recommendation from or waiter, Tosh, who definitely steered us in the right direction. Hands down my best dining experience in New York City this year.",4,0,0,Peter D.,"Armonk, NY",1,10,5
3.0,8/12/2017,"Ousia is a welcome addition to a fast-growing neighborhood with a dearth of upper scale casual options.  Livanos Restaurant Group did not spare any expense in outfitting the vast space, which is nicely done.  Our waiter, and everyone we encountered, was friendly and attentive.  Decent food for the area, though some hits and misses, and a few overpriced items.  Overall, this is a good neighborhood spot for a casual bite out.Ambiance- Modern, sophisticated Mediterranean feel without any kitsch.- Large bar area, perfect for a quick bite or couple glasses of wine.- Still gaining traction, but was doing fine business for a Thursday evening - not packed, but a pleasant din.FoodEverything was of good quality, though some dishes were more enjoyable than others.  Edamame Pistachio Dip ($11), while an interesting concept, lacked acidity to balance out the flavors and became a bit one-note.  Tzatziki ($9) was refreshing and well balanced, nothing more or less than what you would traditionally expect.  Felt both dips were on the higher end in terms of pricing.  Dips are served with plenty of grilled pita bread which was delicious and a bit too addictive/filling.  On a future visit, would just order Tzatziki or try another dip.  Cavatelli Bolognese ($20) with ricotta cavatelli had a rich and satisfying flavor, as did the Kos Meatballs ($15) which came with four meatballs. Recommend both dishes.  Broccolini ($12) side was our biggest disappointment.  Though it was perfectly cooked, the sauce atop was far too sweet.  Wish there were some other fresh/light green veggie options on the menu.BeverageSampled from the wines by the glass, which were reasonably priced and had options for all tastes.  The 2012 Merlot-Kotsifali from Karavitakis Winery in Crete ($13/gl) and 2015 Pazo De Bruxos Albarino ($13/gl) were both nice and paired well with the meal.  A quite unique and well priced selection of Mediterranean wines, though the Merlot was served on the warm side.  Incidentally, they were recently listed in Wine Enthusiast's 100 Best Wine Restaurants for 2017.Service- Professional and attentive.- Responsive to our needs; no service lags.",0,0,0,D.

My husband and I met my mom Saturday evening, and shared a selection of dips (taramosolata was the stand-out) before our entrées. The gentleman pouring our Greek Rosé was very personable, while our waiter seemed to forget about us toward the end of the meal. Prices were very good, especially as we all selected fish and seafood entrées (scallops for my husband, shrimp and artichokes for me and lavraki fillet for my mother. Hers was very flavorful. Mine needed salt). The side dishes were real stand-outs, so do yourself a favor and get the lemon-roasted potatoes, and consider the grilled asparagus and the carrots too or the zucchini fritters.

Even the asparagus side dish (which only had six sticks of asparagus for $13) was terribly overcooked.

Following the hummus, we had the greek salad which was delicious! Cucumber based with plenty of feta, tomatoes and olives. Additionally we had the brussel sprouts and mushroom ravioli, with a side of greek fries. The brussel sprouts were very tasty and the portion was quite large. As for the mushroom ravioli, I could have done without. The flavor of the sauce was a little strange and I wasn't a fan of the large chunky mushrooms. The drink selection was excellent and the cocktails were delicious (I had the Mule - thumbs up).All in all, definitely a must try for Mediterranean lovers. The only downside being that the restaurant is located somewhat in the middle of nowhere (albeit within a beautiful building) and for a Saturday night, I expected a little more of a crowd. In any event, I recommend!",2,0,1,Christopher S.,"New York, NY",13,127,72

3.0,4/1/2017,Today I tried Ouisa because of it being new and it had good reviews. The blood orange mimosa was great and fresh. We started with the Tzatziki dip and it was great. My mom had the chicken soup and it had great lemony flavors with a creamy texture. I was disappointed with the chicken souvlaki. It had little flavor and some of the chicken was undercooked- still pink. The staff was friendly and checked in often.,1,0,0,Rita D.,"Sea Isle City, NJ",250,42,35
5.0,3/31/2017,"Ousia = essence of the Mediterranean. I thought service was horrible but the food and setting were outstanding. New spacious restaurant in a new residential development near the West side highway. By the team behind Molyvos and a few other restaurants. The spreads were the best part of the meal. Started with 3 different spreads which were served in generous portions and came with great grilled pita bread that seemed to be seasoned with herbs and was reminiscent to naan.  Taramasalata (Carp Roe, Almonds) - amazing, done well Edamame Pistachio Dip (Roasted Garlic) - neutral tasting, almost like a palette resetter Htipiti (Roasted Red Peppers, Feta) - good, a little spicy Also tried a few veggies - none of which stood out but all appreciatedCast Iron Cauliflower with Kalamata Olives - actually seemed like a hash Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Fig Balsamic Glaze, Almonds - flavor was excellent even with soggy texture Artichokes A La Polita with Leeks, Ouzo & Orange-Scented Broth - carrots tooFor mains tried a few sea and land dishes:Grilled Octopus with Santorini Fava, Cherry Tomato, Red Onion - always enjoyable and this was probably the best main for me, simply crafted yet tasty Grilled Whole Lavraki with Lemon Olive Oil Emulsion - nicely filleted although a bit heavy on the olive oil which resulted in a soggy texture and took away from the experience for those, like me, wanting a simply grilled fish Kos Meat Balls with Ground Beef & Lamb, Cumin Tomato Sauce, Yogurt - small and hearty Cavatelli Bolognese with House Made Ricotta Cavatelli, Tomato, Braised Beef and Lamb, Kefalotyri - can't go wrong here and it did not disappointFor dessert triedBaklava Trio (Classic, Chocolate-Almond-Date, Tres Leches) - interesting they arrived looking like bone marrow pieces ..And unfortunately they were hard to cut into .. the chocolate almond was the best tasting as it was easy to bite into. The tres leche was very hard and dry tasting .. classic was a little tough as well but was true classic flavor Greek Yogurt with Strawberry Spoon Sweet, Crumbled Pistachio - really liked this.

5.0,3/10/2017,"Ousia is the latest and greatest restaurant from the Livanos Restaurant Group.  My family came in the other weekend for my Dad's birthday and absolutely loved it.I would describe the ambiance as elegant and inviting. There's a lot of fresh wood, and there's a really nice mural at one end of the dining room. The bar is also really beautiful and serves as the centerpiece of the restaurant. From the moment we walked in, you could notice that they pay attention to the small things here. The hostesses were welcoming and the music was great. Our server, April, was fantastic and really helped guide us through the menu, suggesting we add certain items, and helping us through the drinks list.If you're still reading this, you're probably wondering, well, what about the food? It was excellent, I would call it pan-mediterranean (with a focus on Greek food). Most dishes are meant to be shared, but that doesn't mean this is 'small plates' - a lot of the dishes were really substantial. My favorites were the Tzaziki, the Pear flat bread, the lamb chops and the prawns. The burger, believe it or not, was also a big hit and an interesting take on a Mediterranean-style burger.For desserts, I'm not even a big baklava guy but the baklava trio was incredible. They also did a nice job surprising my Dad for his birthday and making him feel special, which was an added bonus. The owner Nick, and the GM Johnny, his son, stopped by at the end of the meal to wish us well. All around, food and service was 10/10.",2,1,2,Alex R.,"Chicago, IL",276,103,73

For the amount we paid, we could have gone to Milos, or Taverna Kyklades (a lot cheaper) and had really tasty food.  Maybe a good place for drinks, pretty enough, but to eat there, forget about that; go someplace else.",2,0,0,Naomi S.,"Manhattan, NY",78,2,0

5.0,2/24/2017,"I have to say, this place is pretty great...First, the food is sort of pan-mediterranean, rather than Greek, which means you can find a lot of greek food on the menu but often with a twist that (for the most part) improves on the original.  We had the grilled endive salad to start, and it was really big surprise because the other two at my table both professed not to like endive, but after a little bite they devoured it.  We also had three spreads with pita--very good but not outstanding--and avgolemono soup.  It was very good as well, but not like my grandmother's.  This was the lone update that didn't surpass the original.For our mains, we had the crispy cod, which was the perfect fried fish though it seems a shame to even categorize it that way.  The coating was crispy without being dense, a really amazing texture compared to the soft, flaky cod underneath.  The fish sat on top of one of the spreads, surrounded by diced beets.  Beautiful and delicious.  Next were lamb chops, but truly some of the best lamb chops I've ever had.  They were big and juicy (we asked for medium rare) and they had just the perfect amount of fat to add flavor without being greasy.  They were topped with a garlicky version of a Chimichurri sauce that really added another few layers of flavor.  Caution: order more than you think you'll need to avoid embarrassing conflicts table side...We also had the scallops, which were big and very fresh, with some crumbled feta and a cauliflower mash.Everything was delicious and looked just as good as it tasted.  The bar sent us some very good wines to pair with the dinner and they really chose well.  If I had to complain about anything it would be that the bourbon selection was just a compilation of the biggest sellers.  About the only one worth mentioning was the Michters.  Other than that, it was the usual suspects (Woodford, Makers, blah blah)  Given the amount of work that went into the cooking and the absolutely beautiful room, they just need to up their game with their whiskeys.",6,1,2,George R.,"Avondale Estates, GA",18,138,97

5.0,2/19/2017,"Welcome to your favorite new Mediterranean place on the west, west of midtown. In a barren land of BMW dealerships and broadcast buildings this place shines (and not just because everything is sparkly brand new inside).The Atmosphere:SO NEW! It is casual but refined - (Think Jams, Nougatine, or Upland) - similar feel as those.The one peeve was lighting - too bright for dining service. Turning the lights down a little bit and adding a few candles would do wonders! That being said - this place for lunch??? It would be amazing - big windows right near the water. I'm sure its bright and buzzy and the sandwiches and tacos look great. But I'll get to the food later....Service:ZERO COMPLAINTS - and how often can you really say that at a new place? Our server, backwaiter, manager, and even bartender all checked in on us and seemed to truly care how we enjoyed everything. They even brought a generous taste of one the Greek wines my friend had never heard of.Food (everything here is priced very affordably for NYC - we chose to order it all tapas style and share which seemed to work out for the best): They have a large list of creative and interesting spreads served with delicious grilled pita - we went with:Edamame and Pistachio - Mild and Pleasing, a crowd pleaser for sure Beet and Cannelini - The winner of the two, if you like beets you should've gotten this yesterday - SO GOOD.Next up for appetizers:Artichokes A La Polita - This is an incredibly simple dish - potatoes, carrots, and artichokes but the sauce...... it is some sort of Orange Broth with Ouza and it is insanely delicious. This dish isn't gonna make any instagram pages but the taste will linger and you will be upset that you have zero idea how it was made Blackened Mahi Tacos - Admittedly not an appetizer but wanted to get a taste of what lunch would be like here. These come as a generous portion and are truly delicious - zero complaints.Grilled Endive Salad - This is the problem child unfortunately - it is a mess. First of all the portion is too big, giant heaps of warm endive piled on top of eachother, smothered with a rich yogurty anchovy sauce and cheese. It's just very one note and lacking any real depth or punch of flavor. I think it should be relatively easy to fix with a different presentation and some more acidity - here's to hoping...Entrees:Scallops - Totally fine - portion is a bit small compared to everything else we ordered. But the flavors were on point and they tasted freshHanger Steak - So freaking good. served with a thyme butter that will punch you directly in the mouth feels and a pan gravy (?) that is to die for. Steak was cooked perfectly. Canneloni - Very tasty - cannot imagine anybody not enjoying it. It was just very heavy compared to the rest of our meal. Side of Fries - You will not be disappointed with these.Desert:Baklava Trio - YOU WANT THIS. YOU. WANT. IT. Rice Pudding - Not good - but not all can be sunshine and rainbows I suppose. Look - again - I think this can be fixed pretty easily. The problem is the insane amount of granola that this is topped with. It gets served in a stemless wine glass and is maybe two inches full of (delicious) rice pudding -the rest are these giant pieces of  fig sorbet, maybe 3/4 cup of granola and then a weird champagne granita that does not pair with the rest. Granola, Granita and Sorbet do not work together - Im sorry,. If it was me I would put the rice pudding in a cocktail glass, do small pieces of macerated (w/alcohol?) figs and then just do a dusting of granola on top. This is their first desert on the menu and it has a bunch of strange components so i guess I was expecting something special..... it honestly would make more sense to me if it was on the breakfast menu Drinks:Cocktails - We tried several and loved them all. I even ordered off the menu and had one of the best espresso martinis of my lifeWine -They have a wonderful selection of Greek wines. My advice is to ask them about it - you want to try them, trust me. We had a Cab-Sav Rose and it was everything you could want  in a rose (not to mention it was a steal price-wise) Over-all:Go here - eat like you would at some of the better Mediterranean restaraunts in Midtown and pay much, much less.

My husband and I got the eggplant and tzatziki spreads (very fresh and generous portions), and we also got the moussaka and meatballs. I'm always hesitant to order moussaka because it's a pretty heavy dish, and I always end up napping half an hour after I eat it. But Ousia's moussaka is made with striped bass, which is a refreshing and healthy change, and it just melts in your mouth. I could eat it everyday mmmm...Also ordered the meatballs, which were good but we'll probably opt to try something else on a future visit.

The food is this Mediterranean kind of flare but nothing really stands out. No wow factor yet but I can see it happen. A lot of wait staff running around in a disorganized manner. A bunch of these floor manager type of people just add to the chaos. Food served in a weird order. The grilled octopus was served with the main course even though we each ordered our own main courses. Next time you can serve it with the Greek salad appetizer, that will make more sense. Funny when you get to the restrooms ""if it's locked somebody is  in there"" kind of a Starbucks feel.

The first thing I noticed walking in was the beautiful decor and the very impressive bar in the center of the room. We had a reservation and were sat immediately. FOOD:The menu is geared towards shared plates and has a wonderful assortment of traditional Greek cuisine and Mediterranean dishes. Some of our favorite starters were the Brussels sprouts (the fig makes these a MUST have app), the iron skillet cauliflower and the beeper feta spread. For entrees we got the Greek salad- amazing- and the short rib. This was, BY FAR, the best short rib I have EVER HAD, hands down. Also, the Greek fries had this citrus herb rub that was unbelievably tasty! Ice cream and raspberry Sunday for desert!!!DRINK:We had 3 of their cocktails. The PPP was very refreshing and on the sweeter side. The pink peppercorns are a nice touch. The Moroccan Whiskey was tasty as well and not too sweet. Then we had Athena the Wise- it kinda looks like an old fashioned but had sweet vermouth like a Manhattan- definitely a choice for those who enjoy the prohibition style cocktail. Overall, every drink exceeded expectations. SERVICE: Our server, April, was WONDERFUL!! Her recommendations were very helpful and we got, just about, all of them.

4.0,2/1/2017,"This week old restaurant is part of the Livanos restaurant group. For being so new, I was impressed with how smoothly things seemed to be running. The service was outstanding. The food preparation was on point as well. My friend and I were told that they suggest eating family style. The waitress mentioned that for two people we should order three dishes, a spread and/or a salad. We went with one spread, two dishes, and rice. When the food arrived, I realized exactly why they recommended ordering so much. I feel like they should list the entrees as tapas, serve the dishes over rice, or charge more and give larger portion. The veggies seem to be quite expensive in comparison to the cost of other things like meat. I think it's a bit deceiving when you look at a menu before entering and are led to believe that entrees are in the $15-$20 range, but in reality these aren't actual full sized dishes. When we sat down we were given three tall breadsticks. We both felt that a side of pita and some olive oil would have been more appropriate, and the restaurant shouldn't charge $2 for pita. We started with the Tzaziki (which comes with free pita since we got a spread). I have to say the tzaziki was damn good. It was garlicky with a nice amount of dill, and I loved the tomato confit on top. We then got our Chicken Souvlaki and Kos Meatballs. The chicken souvlaki was flavorful considering it's typically more of a bland dish before you add some yogurt to it. I did have to ask for extra yogurt though. I'd definitely order the meatballs again. They were smothered in sauce, just the way I like them. Everything here is a la carte, so we decided to add a starch. The Mediterranean Pilaf with spinach and lemon zest was perfect. It was full of great flavors. As you can see in the picture, it isn't a plain rice pilaf. It has a tomato base.When the bill came, we were pleasantly surprised by the 15% discount they are offering since the restaurant just opened. While I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here, I would definitely come again if I'm in the area.",11,4,5,Leah D.,"Newark, NJ",268,196,206

However, after eating at OUSIA last week (located on 57th between 11th and 12th), it will be my new favorite dinner destination and I encourage others to make the trip.  First of all, I can't believe how amazing the restaurant looks.  I know, it is shiny and new, but it is really comfortable and there is great spacing between each table, so you are not eating on top of your neighbor.  About the food and drink:My wife and I shared a couple of different plates as recommended by our server.  We started with Hummus and OUSIA salad and then ordered the brussels sprouts, lavraki and beef short ribs.  Finished with the rice pudding parfait which we didn't even want to eat because it looked so cool in the serving glass.  We eventually gave in and ate it though and it was the perfect ending to the meal.  We paired the food with a couple of Obans (neat for me) and a Bombay and tonic for her. This was the type of meal that you leave fully satisfied, but not stuffed.  So happy we found our new dinner place.  We already have a sitter for the kids for our next dinner there with friends.  Can't wait to try the sea bass and cannelloni.",4,0,0,Dan M.,"New York, NY",0,1,0
5.0,1/25/2017,"Came to Ousia on a Tuesday night and I couldn't have been more impressed. As soon as you walk in you are greeted by amiable restaurant staff.  The atmosphere, the music, the people, everything was great. Before I sat down I ordered one of their custom signature drinks and was very pleased. When I sat down the first thing I noticed was the depth and range of the menu. Often at nicer restaurants they offer a small menu with limited options. Not Ousia! From salads, to apps, to fish and meat the options were plentiful. Our waiter, who was athens born, explained each dish perfectly and did not leave anything for imagination. Evey dish he suggested was a grand slam! The greek wine that was suggested to us was also a hit. Drank 3 bottles as if it was nothing! Overall it was a great experience and a great addition to the far west side that does not have many food options.  This restaurant is a must go!",0,0,0,Jake D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0
5.0,1/25/2017,"I could not be more excited that Ousia has opened. Exciting contemporary greek food coupled with a superb drink menu and an even more stellar staff, (the manager Sam embodies the being of hospitality) has this place hard to beat. If I had one complaint, its that my stomach was not big enough to try all of the amazing things Ousia has to offer! After starting off with the delicious melitzanosalata and classic hummus, I moved on to the Lamb Roulade, which was out of this world!  Safe to say I will be back. And back again, and again, and again..... you get the point.",0,0,0,Mike J.,"Yonkers, NY",1,17,0
5.0,1/25/2017,Aesthetic was beautiful. Service and food was outstanding. Officially my new go to restaurant! Just wait until you meet the family... Perfect environment for family and friends to get together. Truly an experience and yet another amazing restaurant from the Livanos fam. Enjoy as soon as possible!,0,0,0,Lorenzo B.,"Boston, MA",363,2,0
5.0,1/25/2017,"Opening night. A Livanos gem. What's better than that?Well for starters think of an inventive modern style greek menu. Moussaka with sea bass!  Yummy and to die for. Greek styled Manhattans and so much more. Well-portioned  servings from the garden, by land or by sea. A wonderful addition to the NY Restaurant scene.  And the beginning of a new Livanos generation of restauranteurs with grandsons Johnny and Enrico greeting the guests and managing the hospitality.",0,0,0,David J.,"Zug, Switzerland",8,58,32
5.0,1/24/2017,We really enjoyed our dinning experience. Started with dips. Cannellini - beets and Melitzanosalata . Great. Next the Cretan Flat Bread was not just another pizza called a flatbread. The depth of flavor...Amazing. Like I've never tasted. Baked Gigantes and Asparagus as sides.  Both were a hit with us.  Cannelloni were also very good. Wait staff was well trained and attentive. Need to go back to try the Octopus and more.,1,0,0,Michael O.,"Bedford, NY",0,5,1
5.0,1/19/2017,"OUSIA IS THE BEST NEW RESTAURANT TO COME TO THE CITY!!!! I was fortunate to come across this fabulous new edition to Hell's Kitchen and I plan on making it my new neighborhood favorite.  Everything about this restaurant is exceptional. Upon arriving you are greeted by warm and inviting hosts. The ambience caters to formal or informal occasions. This could easily be a date night staple or casual night out, or a family favorite. The décor is nothing less than perfection and the food and cocktails are extraordinary.  I recommend trying the PPP cocktail and pairing it with a variety of spreads with pita or vegetables to dip. I look forward to many nights of culinary adventures!!!",0,0,1,Madison M.,"Briarcliff Manor, NY",66,3,0
