3.0,10/28/2018,"I really wanted to like this place more than I did, considering the amazing reputation. While the interior and service is what you would expect, the pork entree wasn't a stand out. The green beans lacked salt and were paired with a overly sweet sauce. Considering the money you pay, I expected a more memorable meal.",1,0,1,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, NY",218,208,22
1.0,10/17/2018,The food is good but the bartender Christian was an absolute jerk.  Walked out and will never go back. He needs an attitude adjustment.  I suppose when the place closes he will have to find a new job.  Hopefully the chef will hire someone nicer or help Christian understand he needs to be more kind.  I never write reviews but this was so egregious I had to say something.,0,0,0,Steve W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0
4.0,10/17/2018,Cannot believe this place is closing. Such a major loss to good cuisine in Chelsea. I'm really sad about it.Regardless. I've had dinner here three times and each time has been memorable. Service is immaculate. The space can sometimes be a wee bit cramped and the prices are nothing to sneeze at but the quality is always reliably spot on. The tempura beans  are a favourite amongst my friends for appetisers...I've tried the calf liver which is filling and rich. Also have tried the salmon which is quite good and lightly done usually. The Organic roast chicken sits on a bed of vegetables and cream sauce.I still wish this place could continue on. We will miss it.,1,0,0,Ali K.,"Manhattan, NY",115,263,1439
4.0,10/11/2018,Went to the Red Cat for drinks with a lady friend after checking out the Highline. I got caught in between lunch ending and dinner beginning. Fortunately for us they're as a bar menu with a limited selection of items. We had burgers medium with guyere cheese with deep fried potato chips which were excellent. The biggest surprise was the Rose the bartender suggested. It was amazing. We scarfed down about 2 glasses each and each glass were $15 a pop ... ouch.. Anyway it was worth it. Check it out on a weekend day. I'm sure it will be a great experience.,0,0,0,Michael N.,"Manhattan, NY",378,104,251

4.0,10/7/2018,The food was wonderful and the restaurant was very accommodating to dietary restrictions. I got the salmon and was surprised by how small the portion was.

4.0,9/27/2018,"Hadn't heard of this place until a friend recommended it as they have a lot of healthy dishes. I had an interesting but tasty drink. I can't remember the full name but it was the blueberry something. It was sweet and then had a spice to it. It gave you a kick in the back of your throat. Not my typical drink but pretty good. We both had the pork chop. It was really good and cooked really well. For an appetizer I had the watermelon, tomato, goat cheese salad. Oh my word. Two of my favorite things- watermelon and goat cheese. I never thought about putting them together but it was so good! The server was really great and helpful. She gave her opinion about the dishes and was very attentive. My only complaint is the price. It was a little overpriced for me. Good food but 16 for 4 small pieces of watermelon and a few dollops of goat cheese is a little much.",0,0,0,Bailey A.,"Baltimore, MD",1,91,5
4.0,9/23/2018,"Came here for dinner with my friends. We ordered a bit too much but it was well worth it. First, I had the strawberry prosecco drink and it was the best drink I've ever had. It was the definition of perfection. As appetizers, we ordered the calamari salad and the mussels. I don't like mussels so I only had the calamari salad. Surprisingly, I'm not a seafood eater, I only eat shrimp and calamari and crab meat from sushi places. I really enjoyed this calamari salad, it was full of flavor. The roasted red peppers gave it a little kick and it was so good. As entrees, I had the organic chicken, my friend ordered the pasta, and my other friend had the salmon. I liked the chicken a lot and it was definitely a good big portion. The vegetables that came with it made the dish burst, it was so delicious. My friends loved their dishes and we finished everything in a matter of an hour. I'd definitely come here again to try something different.",1,0,1,Lily F.,"Brooklyn, NY",502,387,1172

Grabbed a drink and ordered grilled nutella and banana toast before getting a table, honestly could've used a better container.

2.0,9/17/2018,"Brunch at Red Cat.  We were excited because we've enjoyed it before.  Unfortunately did not really enjoy it this time.  Service was slow, periods of being forgotten and coffee not refilled.  Other patrons, who had arrived long after us, were being served their food as we waited.  And waited.  All entrees were cold, including an egg dish, by the time they hit our table.  Two were sent back, with no apology from waitstaff.  Both plates were returned to the table effectively at the same temperature as before.  Don't you think a kitchen would re-make a cold egg dish?  Not here.  My wife and I took bets on how the bill drop will go.  Waiter drops the check without a single acknowledgement of what has transpired.  I remind him of what happened, and say that we will not be needing the three small pieces of chocolate he offered for our inconvenience.  It takes another 15 minutes for the restaurant to do the right thing and comp one of the entrees, which should have been done and communicated when they returned our ""reheated"" plates.  Too many other options in town.  Can't recommend.",0,0,0,Carson D.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,0
3.0,9/15/2018,"Like other yelpers, we had high hopes when trying The Red Cat on a Friday night.  We had been here once before about three years ago, and hadn't been too impressed with the food.  But, being new to the neighborhood, and needing a new neighborhood spot after Trestle closed (too sad!), we decided to give it another go.The room is large and comfortable, not too loud, and with good energy.  The service was excellent, professional and caring.  We ordered a beautiful Burgundy from the wine list, and six dishes to share since we were starving.  But though nothing we ordered was truly terrible, each dish was a disappointment.  The best of the bunch was the tempura green beans, but the dipping sauce tasted like it came out of a jar.  I swear we were serving the very same crispy calamari salad at a restaurant I worked at on Long Island - and that was twenty years ago!  In fact, a lot of the dishes seemed tired, the menu in serious need of an update. The zucchini salad was an embarrassment to the chef - it was under-seasoned, and oil it was flash cooked in tasted old and slightly rancid.  The hanger steak was okay.  The pasta with duck was amateurish.  We spent a lot of money there and not one thing stood out, except dessert - an apricot tart that was truly delicious.  So, we are back on the prowl for a neighborhood haunt - service and ambiance were not enough to save The Red Cat from mediocre food.",1,0,0,Jessica D.,"New York, NY",4,158,0
5.0,9/14/2018,"We went there on a Wednesday night and the place was peacefully packed. The hostess was extremely pleasant upon our arrival and accommodated our party as we had several requests. The service was great, the sommelier was very knowledge and helped us pick a tasty, elegant and affordable wine for the table. We ordered the tempura green beans (a must and good for sharing) to start. For entrees, we ordered the hangers steak, pork chop and a side of orzo mac and cheese. My only negative was the orzo needed a bit more salt, which was a small price to pay for our delicious, perfectly prepared entrees (steak & pork). I would highly recommend getting the pork chop (you are missing out if you don't) as it was a delicious flavor-balanced dish. Overall it was an absolutely lovely evening and an awesome meal. We will most certainly be back!",0,0,0,Jackie S.,"New York, NY",513,6,1
4.0,9/11/2018,"This place is a solid pick if you're in Chelsea. Replete with a substantial list of apps and a list of continental entrees that's varied just enough to cover the main proteins (plus a few more exotic varieties), TRC is a great pick for a well-crafted, hearty meal (I opted for the calf liver, which was superb). One critique would be the beverage selection. While they have a curated cocktail list, their selection of mid- to top-shelf liquors was slightly limited in my opinion, as was their wine list. Overall, this is a great spot for a more upscale experience if you're on 10th Ave or in Chelsea generally.",0,0,0,Gabriel S.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",227,17,1

3.0,7/29/2018,"Came here because I was looking for a quick brunch spot in the area, and stumbled into the Red Cat. I have to admit I was very happy they could accommodate us without a reservation and service was prompt even though the place was buzzing.We had the restaurant week menu since it seem to be a better bang for the buck (also I had no idea it was RW as well.) while we did have a assortment of different foods none really popped out to me as this was the best I ever had... but the Chicken Liver and Foie Gras Terrine was absolutely phenomenal!The Chilled Corn Soup was just boring, Mezzelune I wish had more than 5 ravioli and it just felt average, the Grilled Sweet Potato was probably a solid dish I only would complain for more mushrooms, and the french toast while the bread I think alright it was too sweet overall.Overall this place was alright, and if your in the area you should try it.",2,1,1,Vanessa S.,"New York, NY",1033,615,886
5.0,6/30/2018,"came in with a friend on a random Sunday to check out the menu that wasn't posted on the door. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a very nice man in a suit which Im sure as is intended, said to us ""this place is classy and we have awesome fucking food"". Turns out it was, and turns out they did. Sat at the bar, bartender was cool and friendly, took good care of us. What it's really about is the plates. Get as many things as you can. Whoever the chef is in here is KILLING IT. The food is like edible poetry. Cold corn soup, and octopus INCREDIBLE. My only complaint was that the steak, cooked perfectly, was paired with a sauce that tasted like it belonged in a stew (break that recipe out in winter maybe?) but even then, who am I to criticize the artist that made this plate?!

2.0,5/27/2018,"We came in for lunch with a party 10. It wasn't very busy but the service seemed a bit slow, still. But it wasn't terribly long or anything - just slow. The food is where the rating gets deducted. Out of 10 plates, only one person found theirs seasoned to their liking. Everyone else had food that was either too salty, or had barely any salt at all. I ordered the special which was shredded pork on 3 flour tortillas garnished with a whole grilled spring onion. Unfortunately I had to get extra sauce just to get some more flavor. I also ordered the homemade gingerale which was delicious. Unfortunately, the ginger comes minced rather than grated or strained, so be careful when sipping or else you might choke on one.",1,0,0,Tony T.,"Brooklyn, NY",461,2,5

2.0,5/13/2018,"I'm being generous with the 2 stars because the food wasn't too bad, but the bigger problem is that this place wasn't too welcoming of myself and my family and I believe it was solely because we were black. First of all, they acted like we didn't make reservations and asked us to double check if we were at the ""right place"" as if we didn't belong there....AND then they insisted that we cancelled reservations earlier this morning which is not true at all.

5.0,4/29/2018,"This is actually one of my favorite NYC restaurants. I'm here for work all the time and The Red Cat is a sanctuary of cuisine in a city that can feel oversaturated with choices. The ambience is cozy, sexy, and makes you feel like you've stumbled into the best kept secret of a restaurant. The food is creative while still maintaining the integrity of every ingredient. The service is another thing to rave about, the servers have such a clear understanding and joy for the menu, it's contagious.

5.0,3/11/2018,"Try making reservations in advance, this place gets crowded. Especially on a weekend night. The restaurant is dark, intimate, lovely.

Can't taste the alcohol in the drinks, but in a way where it'll creep up on you later. The bartenders/mixologists are all knowledgeable and friendly about the food and drink menu. Butternut squash ravioli. Highly recommend! So good, pasta cooked perfectly al dente. The portion isn't huge, but each bite is worth it. That night they had a cheese fondue special that is super good, very heavy I'd recommend sharing. They bring you french baguette to dip the cheese into.

We both weren't very fond of the steak tartare, as we both didn't enjoy the mustard crema, and he zucchini tasted bland. For entrees, we had the long island duck breast and the pork loin. They were both delicious. We also had a side of the hen of the woods. As a mushroom lover, I thought this dish was good. For desserts, we went with the pistachio semifreddo that everyone raves about.

The risotto was something to write home about, plain and simple. Perfection on a plate. I'm in love with it and I miss it from Florida.

Especially the roasted carrots. I wanted to eat light and had the grilled zucchini appetizer for a main. Simple but tasty. The table got the tempura green beans which were fun as well.

5.0,9/6/2017,"I guess I am one of those 'highline tourists' a reviewer below was commenting about because we had a great dinner at Red Cat.  Service was outstanding.  Waitress (Kate?) was fantastic and fun.  We kept it simple - ordered 2 salads and shared 3 pasta appetizers.  All the food was great.  Prices were what I would have expected to pay in NYC.  I ordered a reasonable priced bottle of wine (much less than $100) and Kate told me they were out of that wine and suggested 3 other wines.  I picked one that was much different than I usually order and it was very good and it was actually less expensive than the original wine (when was the last time that happened? - no wine upsell).  Anyway - I would recommend it for the other 'highline tourists' looking for a place with great service and excellent menu.  A side note - we had a 7 pm reservation that I called in to make.  Walking over we passed many empty restaurants so I thought we were just eating 'tourist' early.  When we got to the Red Cat it was packed....so I guess there were a lot of other tourists in town that day.  It certainly was not the beautiful, hipster crowd....I fit right in.",0,0,1,P.

4.0,8/3/2017,"I went here, somewhat on a whim, last week for the Restaurant Week menu.  I didn't do a ton of research and was not sure what to expect especially given that sometimes Restaurant Week menus can be a little lack-luster.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the tasty and solid meal I enjoyed.   I went with two friends and the three of us all did the Restaurant Week menu.  We all ordered the steak tartare as an appetizer.  The steak was great and went well with hard boiled egg and pine nuts.  The sauce was also tasty, but the amount was excessive and the dish could've done with half the amount of sauce.  For entrees my friends went with the tagliatelle and porgy while I ordered the roast chicken.  I generally don't order chicken at restaurants, but I was intrigued by the preparation with anchovy jus and grilled romaine.  I was not disappointed.  The chicken was crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside and went extremely well with the grilled romaine and anchovy sauce.  It was a unique pairing that I would have never thought of, but I would honestly go back just to eat this again.  The fish and pasta were also pretty good.  For dessert I got the pick me up sundae which was a cross between a sundae and tiramisu.  It was delicious and I finished the entire thing.  All of the components were really well balanced and it wasn't too sweet.  The vibes were good and it kind of has an old-school country club, clubhouse feel.  The service was good and they serve southsides (!!!) which is a big plus in my book.  Although not out of this world, all of the food was delicious, the service was good and I would highly recommend this place.",0,0,0,Kate P.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,55,0

4.0,7/27/2017,"This restaurant has been on my radar for several years because of a bff's rave review. He no longer lives in NYC but always tells me to go here. So, I finally dined here yesterday w/ another friend for RW lunch.The food portion for each course was large, which was surprised me considering many RW restaurants serve paltry portions. Anyways, we ordered the tempura green beans since it's their signature item. They were light, crispy and I loved the dipping sauce.  The first course was the steak tartare, and we thought it was best part of the meal followed by the tempura green beans.  It was so refreshing and creamy. Order it! Round 2 was the fish for moi and the shrimp tacos for my friend. The fish was nicely cooked,  the potato puree was tasty, and the mini vegetables were seasoned pretty well. My friend had the shrimp tacos and said it was very good. I'm sure it was very good, but it also looked like something I could've easily duplicated at home, and there was nothing else on the plate. The tacos must have felt lonely sitting there. Round 3: Rhubarb crisp and the Pick me up sundae were nice finales, especially the rhubarb crisp. I love any ""crisp"" desserts because I love crunch!

I was hoping for more of an ""eggs Benedict & mimosa"" vibe but it was a nice meal nonetheless.We started with some cocktails. I had The Red King which had gin and radish and some other things. It wasn't particularly sweet or savory but it was good. My companion had the Vesper which is like a martini. We shared a fresh mozzarella appetizer which had fennel, pistachios, pesto amongst other things. It was very good.The highlight of my meal was my chilaquiles dish. It had an egg on top of sauced tortilla chips with lettuce, radish, crema and queso fresco. They were so delicious that my friend had dish envy. His Spanish torta with potato, onions, and manchego cheese was yummy but ultimately just an omelette with a big side of lettuce.

5.0,2/5/2017,"Came here for Sunday restaurant week lunch with my two roommates, and was thoroughly impressed by The Red Cat! Not only was the food delicious, the presentation was beautiful and the servers were very nice and professional. To start, I had the steak tartare. It was very well seasoned, with an interesting slightly spicy dijon mustard and crunchy pine nuts which went very nicely with the steak texture. The toast that the tartare came with also had a nice crunch. My roommate got the butternut squash soup to start, which was also fantastic (I was able to taste a bit). It was so creamy and lightly sweet and salty... I think I'll have to get a bowl for myself the next time I come!For my entree, I had the pan-seared trout. I picked off the skin (but don't let that faze you; I'm just not a huge fan of skin!), and it was very well-cooked. Moist, not too chewy or tough at all. The trout was resting on a bed of green beans, but the best part of this entree was actually the SAUCE. The brown butter and cream sauce had a wonderfully buttery texture (almost like mashed potatoes) and went so perfectly with the trout and the beans.. I literally was almost licking the plate the sauce was SO good. For dessert, I had the chocolate budino. Normally, I'm a bit hesitant to get chocolate desserts because they're often too rich / sweet, but this one didn't feel like too much at all! The chocolate was a perfect amount of sweetness, and it was served in a tall glass with chocolate mousse / cake at the bottom, chocolate crumbles (looks like dirt!) and these crunchy chocolate wafer balls, topped with some whipped cream. So good. My roommate got the buttermilk panna cotta, which was also absolutely delicious. With the pomegranate seeds and orange sorbet, it was a refreshing dessert. The panna cotta actually reminded me a bit of Greek yogurt!Overall, this was just a spectacular meal.

This was one of the few restaurants that had a desirable restaurant week menu and boy oh boy it didn't disappoint . In addition to what was already on the menu my waitress made additional options for appetizers that they'd honor. Going with one of her suggestions I tried the roasted broccoli and with the steak tartare from the menu.  Both were extraordinary . The steak came minus the bacon and they are very accommodating with adjusting the items for  allergic and religious reasons .  For entrees we went with the trout and the chicken. The trout had a subtle crisp to it and was soft and absorbed the oils of the brown butter to make it succulent .Absolute Perfection. The chicken was spiced moderately but combined with the pumpkin seed pesto was fantastic . Deserts hands down the chocolate won out of the two options for rw.Great layers of chocolate and the sea salt with those little chocolate malt balls was like the icing . The buttermilk panna cotta reminded me of the vanilla, brown cow yogurt I buy but more tamed and gelatinous. Definitely not bad but not as good as the chocolate.

I found the sweetness of the tortilla kind of taking away from the flavor combination of the shrimp and slaw toppings...but I think it's more a matter of preference.

It had me roll my eyes back to my head really.The chicken was seriously the best chicken I've ever had with it being crispy on the outside skin and the meat was so tender.  There was no bone and along with the sauce it was a match made in heaven.  The spaetzle was an unique texture as well - I don't think I've ever had it- works so well with the chicken!  With the sour cream, broccoli, chicken jus - all the flavors danced around my mouth yum.  This chicken seriously made my day.For the skirt steak, I loved the chewiness of the meat - but was not into the fingerlings - surprisingly enough though, maybe it wasn't cooked soft enough.I don't go eat at these fancy restaurants often and I was a bit thrown off when they asked if I wanted to check my coat.  It was nice to not have my bulky jacket at the table since it was a small space, but it took a while to get my coat back.I will definitely come back for more food / drink another time to celebrate something else!  Staff were so nice and attentive.

5.0,12/9/2016,"Hands down, one of the best restaurants I've been to in the city. I researched back in September and came across The Red Cat. My friends and I checked it out back then and had an amazing time...great food, great drinks, great ambiance, and great service. When I booked my trip to Manhattan in December, I immediately knew I wanted to come back to The Red Cat. My friends and I went this evening and it totally surpassed our expectations... I had told them about my amazing experience and tonight blew that out of the water. What a great time!! The Char on the special menu was mouth watering. The pork chop and the chicken were equally amazing. The best dish by far was the celery root ravioli appetizer. Totally recommend that dish!!!!

Heritage pork- Made perfectly the way I wanted it. Loved the polenta base. I am not much of a Rapini/Broccoli raab  fan but I managed to get some in me. DESSERT- We shared the Banana Crostata.

4.0,11/29/2016,"Several years back, my husband and I took a visiting friend to The Red Cat, and we most remember her being amazed the tables were still packed at 10pm. Well, we returned last week for Thanksgiving, and the place was hopping. There was a lovely pre-fixe holiday menu. Husband started with a hard squash salad and I started with salmon crudo. Both delicious, though his salad was rather generously portioned. I had the roast turkey entrée--very traditional with cranberry sauce, stuffing, gravy, white and dark meat--and he had the pork tenderloin. We basically mirrored the entrée order of the table next to us that seemed really happy. We even quietly asked for an extra side of stuffing, which was good, because it was delicious and I'd love to see it pop up again as a special side dish through the holidays, because why not? Also the side of stuffing was nice and warm, where the stuffing with my turkey was not. The wine and cocktail list was really well-organized and accessible. This is a great spot for lunch as well--my friend works nearby and loves to treat herself to some tempura green beans. Cozy spot to go on a date, catch up with friends or take the parents.

The arugula salad had just the perfect amount of arugula/Parmesan ratio. My friends had the steak and pasta that were pretty much cleaned off the plate.  The desserts were divine.

4.0,8/24/2016,"Great place for Restaurant Week. Narrowed and extended to the back type of space. Full of people and groups of frequenters on a Sunday lunch, and the aroma from the kitchen guaranteed a wonderful meal to come.   Since we were going for the PAN SEARED PORGIE entree, we asked the sommelier to help pick a red light wine. Domaine Glinavos, Vlahiko, 2009 was his 2nd recommendation with a more affordable price tag ($56 a bottle). The northern Greek wine is described to deliver loads of electric acidity and woodsy blackberry and blackberry leaf. It was supposed to go well with the flavorful fish. However, it just tasted boring with no depth. No before or after taste even. May be we should have selected a white wine instead. To compensate the dull Vlahiko, the appertizer STEAK TARTARE with pine nuts, egg, grilled bread, mustard crema was thankfully delicious. I could taste everything from the dish. Ingredients coordinated well together and enhanced great flavor for each and every bites with the tasty bread. PAN SEARED PORGIE with potato puree, summer succotash, grilled scallions was also delish. Nice outside rust for the Porgie. We couldn't finish the HERBED FRENCH FRIES side. It's great but not special. For dessert, BUTTERMILK PANNA COTTA with strawberry sorbet, strawberry sauce, mint and CHOCOLATE BUDINO devil's food cake, salted caramel, whipped cream were both good. I preferred the CHOCOLATE BUDINO though, as I haven't had any panna cotta that is better than the Fushimi's HOMEMADE YUZU PANNA COTTA.",1,0,0,Chau H.,"Manhattan, NY",286,63,171

Only negative unfortunately was some type of confusion by the waiter. My friend announced that she was ordering off of the restaurant week menu. We both ordered the chicken ( delicious ). Waiter brings one order to the 3rd person at the table - and then brings one chicken dish for us to share. Talk about confusion - I mean why would we SHARE an entree off of a set menu? He seemed just as confused and did bring another dish. We did end up sharing one - took home the rest. It was wrapped very poorly however and spilled on my friend. Another positive however was the the Maitre came over to see what had happened.Offered dry cleaning ( of course declined :) and when the bill came removed our after dinner drinks.We did share the confusion over the chicken dish - but added that while it was a mistake the waiter was very kind and quick.In a nutshell, I'd definitely would go back there.

I liked that it is well lit room, noise was not excessive even if the tables are pretty close one to the other.When ordering, I liked they have a good selection of half bottles of wine, which comes in handy when going out with somebody who may be drinking just one glass. We started with the soft red lettuces salad (the name sounds weird, as I was expecting soggy lettuce) which was a nice started, and then we went splitsies with the skate (not the steak!) and the lamb. The skate was very yummy, with a nice bed of vegetables. The lamb, which for my taste was a bit over cooked (we ordered it medium rare) had also a nice side of veggies in a tasty gamy sauce. If I had to complain about something, it is that all the dishes had a pickled flavor, the salad because of the vinaigrette and the skate and the lamb because of the mixing veggies below the protein.As for the dessert, we went with an almond and olive oil cake with a strawberry sabayon.

The service was friendly, warm and professional. The food was delectable and delicious. I had originally planned on coming here on my first night in NYC, but I was deterred by a few reviewers who panned the place and recommended Cookshop in it's place. Don't listen to them. Having been at both I will say this, the Red Cat is head and shoulders above Cookshop, even though one is truly more upscale and the other is more casual. Additionally they are both comparable in price. I came here after having dinner at Cookshop to have a couple glasses of wine and had a lovely time and decided to come for dinner as originally planned on another evening and I am glad that I did. Our first course we shared the house made Ravioli special and they were rich and decadent. I had the Duck Breast for my entree and it was terrific, while my companion had the Strip Steak with the horseradish. Their dish was equally good and the horseradish was not overpowering. I had the Rhubarb Crisp with Chamomile Ice Cream and this was so darn good. My companion had the Key Lime Cheesecake and it was a hit as well.

3.0,5/16/2016,"Let me first say the food was excellent. I had the steak tartar for my appetizer as well as the Heritage Pork for my entree. My partner had the white bean bread soup and the Skate. Our Chardonnay was the best I've had in a long time and my partner had no trouble putting down the rhubarb cobbler with chamomile ice cream.This is why I will not be giving more than 3 stars:1. When we were going to be sat, my partner explicitly asked not be seated next to a child and where did the host take us to immediately? To a table next to a family with a child. 2. We were sat next to another table who seemed to be getting special service because while we were sat at the same time, our waiter (and the manager) kept coming back to their table while we had to flag him down.3. While I understand that by law a restaurant cannot deny service to a family with small children, it is highly misleading to those couples who spending A LOT money for a quiet, intimate night out to be constantly distracted with the high-pitched cries of ill-behaved children. At one point, the manager actually had to speak with the ill-behaved parents of the ill-behaved child because the ill-behaved parents didn't seem to find a problem with their child running around the dining room with staff carrying hot plates, glasses, and knives.For what its worth, I'd be more than happy to come back here another night and hope for the experience that The Red Cat has the potential of providing and altering my review.",2,1,1,Chloe F.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",29,5,15

However, despite it's size the Red Cat delivers big on hospitality, service and food.They have over 500+ reviews so I'm not going to go into a play by play review. We shared a ravioli entree as a starter, for an entree I would consider it on the lighter side, and would be disappointed and hungry. Other than that on little issue, my skirt steak was excellent, I forgot to ask them to leave off the horseradish, which isn't something I generally care for. For a quick moment I thought it was ruined, however it was done in a way that it didn't overpower the steak and it's given me a new appreciation for using it in limited doses.

It is an old favorite from years ago, still going strong, I was happy to discover.The first time, as appetizer I had the Cara cars & blood orange salad with hazelnuts and a little red onion, delicious. My companion had quinoa and cauliflower salad and was happy. This was followed by shrimp tacos for her and a burger with Gruyere cheese for me. We commented on how delicious both were and left happy. Later in the week I had lunch with my son, the kind of catch up lunch, as Mom, I rarely get to have. For a second time my request for a quiet table was met with success. I was grateful for that sometimes rare accommodation. This time I picked what my friend had eaten before: quinoa and cauliflower salad, Ian had smoked trout salad, which he loved. Then I had shrimp tacos with delicately cooked shrimp and lots of delicious cabbage slaw. I can't remember what Ian had next. We were deep in conversation and I remember contented noises from across the table. We shared an amazing dessert, a tart with dark chocolate and crushed pretzel crust and a fudgy filling. We both took bites and closed our eyes in ecstasy. It was that good! Neither time did anyone drink wine. Service was diligent, if a little intrusive. A personal preference of mine is not to be asked at least three times if ""everything is okay?"", ""we are enjoying the food?"".  I realize that is is ""service"", but each time conversation was stopped dead by the server.  I felt if we had needed anything one of us would have raised a hand for service.

Our favorite was the steak tartare, because it was so flavorful and the chips was a great way to scoop it up and the crunch was just right. The tempura green bean is a must. Not soggy and it was lightly battered yet crunchy. Love the mustard sauce w/ it. You can't go wrong w/ chicken liver and four gras or Brussels sprouts. My least favorite was the burrata. It was a very small piece and it was just ok. And our wine was also delicious and reasonable. Would go back.",0,0,0,J L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,29,21
2.0,3/10/2016,"I was kinda disappointed with The Red Cat- with so many great reviews, I thought I had made the right choice when picking it for my business lunch meeting. I had a reservation and when I arrived, I asked for the table facing the window. The hostess said it was reserved for a party that was arriving in 30 min. We sat there for two hours, no one ever showed up. The appetizer was disappointing... tempura green beans. Greasy and honestly OK, but not mind blowing. I ordered the skirt steak salad, which was DRENCHED in olive oil & overloaded with balsamic vinegar. Service was great.. I left my phone charger behind and one of the waiters ran down the street chasing after me to give it back, which was nice. But, honestly expected more from the food.

Crowd definitely mixed and there more people with grey hair than im used to, but they deserve to eat a good meal too so thats definitely ok with me.  Decor was nice and homey, had a farm to table type feel.Started with steak tartar which was amazing, and a bib salad which was good. For entrees we got the skate and the duck breast. It was my first time ordering skate and im glad i didnt google what it was before i ate it because its a little scary looking.  But it was delicious.  My boyfriend said the duck was very good, but i wouldnt know because i dont eat duck (free daffy and donald!).Dessert was also amazing, we got the banana sundae.

4.0,3/1/2016,"For 3 girls for dinner, we got 4 unique vegetable starters and a fish entree to share, and the amount of food was fine. Several dishes came with beautifully ribboned vegetables, I believe it was the burrata from the regular menu, and the quinoa and cauliflower salad from the seasonal dishes; and all were tasty, though the seasonal swiss chard ricotta ravioli with browned butter was even a bit too rich and buttery, and the roasted broccoli was really nothing special for $15 (we had a Blackboard Eats special, or that would have been more disappointing). The local skate was very good. The bottled beer was $8, though my friends' cocktails for $15 each didn't seem worth it. We had an early reservation at 6:15, and the service was very attentive, though as the restaurant filled up and they wanted our table, we had several different servers come to try to clear our plates while we were still working, and despite asking for a check several times so that we could finish eating while waiting for the check and to pay, more servers kept trying to clear our plates without giving us the check. It was odd and disconcerting, and we finally let them take them while still waiting for the check. I don't know if the restaurant has a policy of not giving diners their check while they still have food on the table, which I've never seen before, and which seems especially odd when they clearly wanted our table, and we asked for the check several times. Inventive vegetable dishes, but pricey without a special, and apparently an odd check policy of refusing to give it to you even as they try 5+ times to clear your plates; I wouldn't disagree with going back, but I wouldn't necessarily be the first to suggest it.

You couldn't do better than do as I did; start with the Scottish Salmon crudo with trout roe, then have the skate in a brown butter vinaigrette with roasted grapes, caramelized cauliflower and hazelnuts. So delicious I was honestly tempted to lick the plate! The pistachio semifreddo was a perfect finish, rich with its brownie base and chocolate sauce but not overly so, the semifreddo itself light and refreshing. The sticky toffee pudding, of which I had a taste, was a great upmarket version of the English classic.

With that being said, every server we had was very nice, friendly, and helpful. I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this place, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from going either.

They mash so well together in your mouth bc they're so soft!! I wasnt a huge fan of trout dish i got for entree. It was well cooked, crispy skin and soft meat, but it was def not hot enough. I wish it wouldve been hotter so the skin would be more crispy and the meat is better too. Omg dessert was phenomenal!!! Banana pudding was a must get. It's super sweet cus it has real bananas, banana ice cream, nuts and caramel. Every bite tastes like diabetes but you cant help but finish everything! We also ordered two sides, green bean tempura and herb fries. Herb fries were just like normal regular fries with some herb on top. I wouldnt get this one. Green bean tempura was something different and enjoyable as light snack. I wish they gave out tempura sauce instead of dressing we got. Those two didn't mash too well in my opinion.

5.0,1/19/2016,"Just up a few blocks on 10th Ave from the re-vitalized meat packing district with its glittzy (and rather pricey) eating establishments is a wonderful little restaurant that retains the quieter charms of a Chelsea of years gone by. Red Hat occupies the ground floor of a vintage 4 storrey apartment building. But let not its quaint appearance decieve you, the kitchen is skilled, using up-to-date cooking styles and methods with delightful results for the diner.My experience consists of two excellent luncheon meals over a one week period. Our first visit was so pleasant we brought a group of friend for their Sunday brunch. Everybody loved their dishes: their burger won raves from two of our younger guests; chicken paillard was another winner; shrimp tacos also got good reviews; a cauliflower salad was a nice appetizer. My favorite was the tagliatelle with duck stew: rich and flavorful.Service is very congenial and efficient. There is a bar that offers some interesting concoctions. (Historic note: a restaurant that preceded Red Cat at this location had some notariety as it had as its bartender, Bruce Willis during his 'always auditioning/starving actor' period). The wine list has many interesting and affordable offerings.

4.0,1/13/2016,"Really enjoyed having brunch at The Red Cat on Saturday. The first thing I noticed was the ambiance. The decor was quaint but not old feeling, and the lights were a little dimmed, making everything seem more intimate. The restaurant was filled with couples or small groups of friends. We went for the Huevos Rancheros and the French Toast. - Heuvos Rancheros: Possibly the best Huevos Rancheros I have ever had, and my dining companion agreed. A fried egg sat on top of two crispy tortillas layered in with cheese and sauce, all on a bed of black beans. The crispy tortillas were a good twist and didn't get soggy easily the way the tortillas normally do through the meal. The black beans were in the perfect quantity and weren't overwhelming or dominating the dish. The red and green chili sauce was the absolute best, and I was scraping the plate until I had eaten it all. - French Toast: The French Toast was also unique, but I didn't like it as much as the Huevos. Several pieces of baguette french toast were layered on top of one another, topped with a pistachio-strawberry compote and lemon ricotta. The first thing we noticed was that the slices of french toast were pretty difficult to cut. Beyond that, I found the flavor to be unique, mixing the tartness of the compote and ricotta and the sweetness of the syrup. If I were to return, I don't think I'd eat it again. It wasn't unpleasant per se, but I think it was a little too tart for my personal taste (I like my french toast sweet!), and a little difficult to eat.

DO NOT TAKE A 9:30 RESERVATION!!!!!  Since we did not know what we wanted dinner, he left.  A few minutes later he had returned and once again snipped at me, asking me if I had decided what I wanted to drink.  After inquiring about a few different things, and feeling very pressured and that I was annoying him by just being there, my husband stepped in and ordered a martini for me.  We also ordered food at that time.  Both my husband and friend asked our server for suggestions on what he thought was better, on both occasions, he rudely mumbled something under his breath and moved on to the next person.  The food was brought to the table and we ate it.  Once we were done, he came and removed the plates and asked my husband and my friend how their dinners were.  It was then that I realized he had stopped acknowledging me and was no longer speaking to me. I was not offered more water, I was never offered another martini, I was not asked how my dinner was ... nothing .. like a 5 year old ... he had stopped speaking to me back when I couldn't make up my mind about a drink.  We ordered desert and again, we ate it ... and when our plates were picked up my husband and friend were asked how their food was ... I was not.  We paid the bill ... and got up to leave.  On the way out, as expected, my husband and friend were told goodnight and thanks for coming ...

Like many restaurant off-menu items, the bacon tempura was once on the bar snack food...3) HOMEMADE GINER-ALE: For those seeking a refreshing and healthy alternative to a sugar laden soda, try The Red Cat's homemade giner-ale.

The place finally cooled after we finished our entrées. Basically, everyone at the table said their food was just okay. The home made potato chips were soggy...come on guys, chips need to be crisp. Tempura String Beans were okay. The sweet, hot mustard dip was delicious. Entrees were all very boring and just not worth the money. I ordered roasted chicken thigh with an herb sauce. I asked the waiter if there was any rosemary in the herb sauce. He didn't think there was and said he would put it on the side, which was great. BUT the chicken was roasted with rosemary. (I am not a fan of the herb.) Most of my bites of chicken tasted like rosemary, that was an ugh for me. The service was fine. The bartender was nice. My husband ordered a vodka martini.

They also have a nice wine list that is very accessible. I got the steak tartar for my appetizer, and we also ordered the chicken liver and foie gras terrine to share. I absolutely love terrine, and this was one of the best I've ever had. The candied prunes are a perfect counterbalance to the richness of the terrine. Another trick I'm going to steal for my own. The steak tartar was also good, although I could have done with fewer potato chips. The texture was a little more cooked than I'd expected, but these are minor quibbles. It was good. All of us ordered the blue fish as the entree. It was cooked well with a nice crispy skin, but didn't stand out as much as the appetizers. It was served over a succotash and mashed potato's; a sauce would have been nice to bring the three together. For dessert I ordered the chocolate budino. I was pretty full, but powered my way through it. It was like a layered chocolate lava cake in a cup. Fine, if a bit generic. Service was good and the layout is cozy.

5.0,7/20/2015,"Generally speaking, showing up with a six-year-old for a dinner reservation does not elicit an abundance of goodwill. Nor does showing up with all of your baggage as you're on your way to the airport. Nevertheless, we were greeted warmly by hostess who stashed all of our bags while we enjoyed a leisurely and delicious meal. The service was attentive, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic about both the dishes and the wine selection. Speaking of which, the by the glass offerings provided more than ample breadth and quality. Glad we had a chance to experiment with some new wines rather than put all of our eggs in one basket with a bottle.  The burrata was more of a melange than a straight burrata, though to its advantage. And while the chicken and pork were both meticulously prepared, the chicken was perhaps a bit oversalted - an easily forgotten footnote in the context of the otherwise fantastic experience.  Newark was a hard slap in the face after such a lovely time!",2,0,0,Steve M.,"Columbus, OH",0,35,14
5.0,7/14/2015,"This place = amazing!! We went for Dinner on Thursday, July 9, and it was just total perfection in every way.The night was somewhat rainy and unpleasant, so when my pathetically damp self showed up, I was freezing. We had to wait for our reservation, as would be the norm, but they did actually have our table ready a bit early (and we were early, so  yay).  When you walk in, it does look very small and quaint. The bar was fairly busy, and the tables were seemingly full; we went at about 9:15-9:30, so it might vary at other times. Back to me being freezing: the manager said he would make it warmer, and it was definitely warmer almost immediately. (imagine hearts all around my face...because that's what happened at that moment...).Irene was our server, and she was SPLENDID.  She was so caring and completely a class act. She knew everything about the food, made modification suggestions for me that I hadn't even thought of, and she said something that I rarely hear: ""do you have any special diet restrictions that you'd like for us to keep in mind?"".  To me, that is unheard of. Most places are like ""you're going to eat it how the Chef wants to make it..."" and unless you specify ""X on the side"", they would never offer to make something outside their norm for you.  Irene was the perfect marriage of friendly and professional.The prices were pretty reasonable, but we were eating out for our anniversary, so that was not something we were particularly cognizant of; the wine list was superb, and the food we ordered was delicious. If budget is an issue, you can still order reasonably and possibly share an entree (and get salad or a veg to fill out your plate).  I ordered steamed manila mussels in broth, and they were scrumptious. No fishyness, no weird shell pieces, etc - just delicious and plump mussels.  My spouse ordered the pork, and we also ordered the quick-saute Zucchini as an app.  Perfection! It sounds like basic food, but it was all perfectly seasoned and in reasonable portions (I don't love extremes, like enough food for a small country or the ""we better hit the snack aisle at CVS on the way home"" feeling).Irene was so great that I had to write a little thank you to her on the ""how did we do"" card, and the next morning, I had a thank-you in my email inbox from the manager.  Nice touch, but certainly not surprising based on how they were in every other way!I would go back there in a heartbeat, and we hope to do that.  The Red Cat is overall an elegant, but not intimidating, dining locale. The noise is minimal, so you can talk and have a great conversation.  The food is amazing, and they never rushed us or made us feel like we were taking too long (which we tend to do at times!).  A+++",2,0,0,Veronica V.,"Houston, TX",2,54,0

The liver was amazing but super heavy, and required vegetables to bring it down a notch, and the green beans were great, but I think it could have done without the mustard.

While speaking to the the woman who took my reservation I asked if the regular menu would be available, it being Mother's say and some restaurants have a Prix Fixe. She assured me there would be the regular menu. Guess what? No regular menu - only a $45 fixed menu with limited vegetarian options. We're not huge eaters and generally shy away from Prix Fixe for this reason. I felt forced into spending more than planned and eating much more than I would have.

I just peeked on yelp and saw they had 4 stars and that was good enough for me! They were able to seat us right away, but did tell us we would have be finished by 7:30--which wasn't a problem. We sat down and that's when I realized how pricey this place was :/My friend and I ended up splitting the special app of fingerling potatoes with a leek sauce, topped with parm and bacon bits. This was an interesting dish, and the sauce had a great oniony garlic taste. The garlic taste was strong! Still had it in my mouth even after brushing.We then split the burger (which is on the bar menu and you have to ask for it for $17) and an order of the tempura green beans. The burger was very good! It was recommended to be medium, but it was still VERY juicy, and the meat tasted better than other burgers I've had. It came on an everything bun that was cripsy on the outside but chewy instead--reminded me of a bagel!The tempura beans were unique and interesting! I was expecting it to be completely fried to crisp--but it was very refreshing. It was a nice balance of healthy and deep fried goodness. I also think the wasabi sauce complimented it well.The waitress was great, very attentive and nice--she also gave no judgement in us splitting everything. However, the dinner ended on a very awkward note. We knew we had to finish up before 7:30, but the food took fairly long to come out. So, by the time we were done eating, it was about 7:15. The waitress automatically brought us the dessert menu without asking, so we looked and the dessert options sounded great! We assumed if they brought the menu, that meant we still had time to order one before kicking us out for the next reservation. We were going to ask first if it was okay just to check. The hostess then made his way over to us and asked ""would you like to order a dessert"" and we then asked if we still had time because we knew we had to leave by 7:30---he then really awkwardly said ""yeah, sorry, you're going to have to go""We knew we had to leave, and we were fine with it--but why offer us the dessert menu? Why ask us if we wanted a dessert? Just say, ""sorry ladies, we need the table by 7:30""--don't offer us things and then deny us.Despite this awkward encounter, I think this place is overall good. The dishes were unique, service (for the most part) was great, and the environment was very nice. Would be a great place for date night.

3.0,4/24/2015,"I visited Red Cat on a Thursday night when my friend and I were freezing and decided that we should get dinner to feel warm and fuzzy when we stumbled upon red cat.The host upfront quickly seated us but did politely tell us they would need the table back by 7:30. Of course we understand when the restaurant tells you before hand when you walk in without a reservation. The food was pretty good, but I didn't think they blew it out of the water or anything. I think it was the standard you should expect at a $$$ restaurant. For the appetizer we ordered a fingerling potato dish. It was very delicious. It had a leek sauce that tasted of garlic, topped with Parmesan cheese, and I think there was bacon in it. For the main we got the burger and it had bacon and Gruyere cheese. I don't know how I feel about Gruyere sometimes because it can be a bit too strong for me, but I liked how it went with this one. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium in my opinion. For the side we ordered the green bean tempura. This dish is massive! Definitely could not finish it between two people. All in all everything was very solid and our waitress was the nicest and very attentive! The only downside of the dinner is I don't think the host up front communicated with the server that we were on a time crunch. The food did take a bit long time to come out, though I didn't mind. However towards the end of the dinner the host awkwardly came over with the dessert menu when clearly what he wanted to do was give us the boot. When we received the dessert menu of course we're going to take a look. He came back over and asked if we wanted anything for dessert to which we politely asked if we had time given our initial agreement of 7:30. He replied very quickly sorry we will need the table in a sort of less polite way, no eye contact whatsoever and it was a very cold response which was a little off putting.

That's how good it was!We are tucked away in the back and the manager asked us to move our table a bit to accommodate an additional table. My boyfriend was irked a bit but the manager made up for it by offering us a cocktail on the house! LOVED that they had pisco sour. I haven't had any since my trip to Peru so it was awesome to try it again in NY. Would definitely come again for romantic dinners!

2.0,1/24/2015,"The food prob deserves a 3 but unforgivable is the crazy inept service here. Hard to imagine this is Manhattan it's so bad. Polite, maybe well meaning but inept. They don't know the menu, can't articulate the dishes and like a confused old aunt from Toledo when she tries to explain what she saw in the Met, you won't be able to figure out what you ordered until it comes. Then it will be wrong. What they call cassoulet for example is dried duck confit leg over equally dry white beans. Nothing like else. I can go on over the confusion here but it will be too long and frustrating.  Chincy portions too - both wine and food.

1.0,1/3/2015,"Having been a long time fan of the Red Cat, I recently had the most disappointing dining experience over NewYears Eve. I had a 10pm reservation that the restaurant made me secure with a credit card.  I have no problem doing this, however, if a restaurant secures my reservation with a credit card, management better ensure that a table is promptly waiting for me upon arrival.As usual, my guest and I arrived at 10pm promptly.  We were greeted by a loud, noisy crowd in the overstuffed bar area, and by a scattered hostess, who told us that there would be a slight delay for our table, without giving any additional insight.  Right away based upon the pandemonium, it was quite apparent that the restaurant had overbooked, and I was the lucky guest who would have to deal with the aftermath.My guest and I fought our way down to the end of the crowded bar to wait patiently for our reserved and credit card confirmed table.  45 minutes stretched by with only a few words of feedback from the hostess and manager, who kept trying to assure us that our table would be ready at any minute.  We were finally seated by 11pm, and my guest and I received our menus and some water.  The reality is that if the restaurant had been honest with me that the only available reservation had been for 11pm, I would have dined elsewhere.  I was hoping to be finished with dinner by midnight, so that we could toast in the new year with a glass of champagne, but alas, that obviously was not going to happen.  The infuriating part is that if you were a walk-in at 11:00pm, you could be seated promptly.  So much for having a secured reservation.....Once seated, we ended up with a very nervous server, who was semi-attentive.  We were presented with an amuse-bouche as an apology.  It was a tiny salty, puff pastry with crème fraîche and caviar, which seemed to be more of an insult than an apology. Yuck.As far as the food was concerned, the prix fixe four course menu offered a fair selection.  The best dish was the tenderloin by far and the duck was done very nicely.  We were not a fan of the fried oysters, but the beef tartare and the lobster salad were tasty.  The profiteroles were a total fail as the coffee ice cream did not compliment the puff pastry very well. So, net-net, the food was decent, but I was not overwhelmed. Of course, midnight came, and we still had dirty dinner dishes in front of us. Yeah....nice way to ring in the new year.  At this point the entire staff seemed to abdicate their responsibilities.  A rotund female chef wandered into the dining room with a large glass of brown alcohol.  The servers all went absentee.  So much for a $90 a head plus drinks dining experience!Our server finally came over to us and told us that he had to leave in order to go spend time with his kid.  Yeah.....real nice for the customer.  We were handed off to a server named Susan, who not only screwed up our dessert order, but subsequently screwed up our check.  We got the full on ""sloppy seconds"" treatment.  When the desserts were delivered to our table they were mixed up with the table next to us.  We had bonded over the terrible service and late seating, so we took it in stride.  However, it was a total rank amateur move by a restaurant that likes to pretend that it I can provide a first rate dining experience..In hindsight, I thoroughly and utterly regret spending my New Years Eve at the Red Cat.  Management did not respect its customers enough to give them a top end experience, especially given what was being charged.  As a result, they have lost a customer for life, and I will share this poor experience with as many people as possible.I believe that the Red Cat will soon be going the path of its sister restaurant, the Harrison.R.I.P.",6,3,0,Tim S.,"New York, NY",3,100,0

I had a shrimp taco special that was just superb: a crunchy vinegary slaw with lots of excellent grilled shrimp.But I have to write this time to compliment the service.  I was a few bites from finished when the waiter noticed my nearly-empty glass of wine and asked if I'd like another. I dithered because I wasn't going to be able to stretch what I had until I ate the last of my main course, but it was only lunchtime and a whole new glass seemed like too much.  Aaargh! So I said no.  A minute later the waiter returned holding the bottle of wine and poured me about a third of a glass gratis, saying ""So you won't be thirsty.""

4.0,12/14/2014,"Overall, the food was good, and it is a nice place. Most of the reviews stated that the portions were rather small; I guess we may have different perceptions in size because the portions are normal and some pretty large. Consequently ordered more than we should and left the place rolling!! We ordered the Zucchini salad, the tempura of green beans, and a special pulled pork taco for appetizers. Then we ordered the local skate and the chicken. While the tempura of green beans is highly recommended here, I should note that i) it is a big portion of fried green beans, ii) hope you like salt... a lot of salt, and iii) pray that you don't have a heart attack with the salt... yes that was salty!!!! The zucchini was really good and balanced, while the pork taco appeared more like a burrito -- never saw such a big taco. When we got to main entrees, we realized that we were full -- portions are big, at least for our tiny stomachs! We tried both but were just not able to finish it -- guess we have lunch tomorrow!

I couldn't get enough of the tomatoes and the terrine couldn't get enough of me - it was incredibly rich and came plated like a brick - I left about half of it on my plate there just wasn't enough room in one sitting for it all.

Both times they have handled his allergies really well. The waitresses alerted the kitchen staff to use different utensils/knives when cooking and double checked to see if any of his appetizers had dairy in them. The Red Cat really does handle food allergies well.Now onto the food. For appetizers, I ordered the gnocchi both times. It was cooked very thoroughly and the sweet corn that came with the cream sauce complimented the gnocchi very well. Absolutely delicious! My boyfriend ordered the fluke crudo--he enjoyed it--it came with chia seeds and grape tomatoes. From what I sampled from his plate, it was delicious too!For the entrees, my boyfriend has had porkchops and the lamb, which he claimed he both liked. I ordered the skatefish dish, which was very appetizing. It was creamy and the fish was very tender and had all the right flavors.For dessert, my boyfriend had coconut sorbet. I swear, I usually am not a sorbet fan, but this sorbet had me blown away. It was creamy and just the right consistency. I love how at the end of your meal, you can fill out a experience 'survey' and the Red Cat sends you a 'thank you' e-mail.

3.0,7/30/2014,"The last two times we've dined here were disappointing, sadly.  Red Cat was a haunt of mine when I lived half a block away.  A few years, one dinner, and one RW lunch later, I have to say that the flavors are hit or miss and generally unremarkable.  If you're already committed and are reading this review for menu suggestions, opt for fish.  The meat tends to be unflavorful -- perhaps due to both where it's sourced and how it's prepared.  The zucchini appetizer is a lovely signature dish.  Don't get the one-note panna cotta.  The semifreddo and brownie-based desserts will satisfy your sweet tooth just fine, in a Yankee Doodle Dandy sort of way.The general feeling from the kitchen is that it's now run by line cooks, not by a chef.  The service is attentive, but for me, in this city, the food needs to be great, too.So few places do traditional American well these days, it seems.  If you're willing to spare a few more dollars, make a beeline to Gramercy Tavern.  If you're set on Chelsea for the evening, try Tía Pol, just down the avenue, or Trestle on Tenth, a half block north.  The latter has better decor, more interesting dishes and wine and beer lists, even if the service is not consistent.  For just drinks, rooftop bars La Piscine at the Americano and Gallow Green pack a much better punch.Sorry, RC! but there are just too many much better bites in the Big Apple.",5,2,1,Jennifer C.,"New York, NY",44,53,6

What I immediately noticed was the noise level.  At the two adjacent tables their voice level was very high.  And that I can understand becuase the dining room is designed poorly and does not  absorb the noise, and everyone just wants to speak louder to be heard.  By the time my main dinner course was over, I was ready to head out into the quiet of the NYC streets.",0,0,0,Ruth L.,"Edgewater, NJ",14,55,2

5.0,5/14/2014,"Best meal I've had in NYC in over a year.I dined with three other people who were as impressed as I was. Since we all ordered different entrees, I'd wager the menu is can't-miss. I had the Atlantic Hake, which was so light and perfect with a smoky-flavored assortment of vegetable accompaniments; my boyfriend had the lamb shoulder; the vegan in our party ordered three vegetable appetizers; her boyfriend had the pork chop.  Our sustained chorus of yumming throughout the meal was just brutish. For dessert, three of us ordered the pistachio semifreddo. It's certainly the nutty delight many reviewers before me have described. I would strongly advise splitting it with someone, though.  It should not be difficult to locate a willing accomplice. Our server was a sweetheart. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that we had to wait 45 minutes for our food, however, due to a ""printer error."" Ah, well...technical difficulties. It all worked out. She had the foresight to ask us upon arrival what time we needed to leave (we were headed to Sleep No More) and she managed to orchestrate both courses in spite of the time constraint.

5.0,3/10/2014,"Two words to explain the five stars: pistachio semifreddo.Need I say more? NoWill I say more? Fine, or else this might be the least informative review ever.I'm a big semifreddo fan, probably because it's so light I don't realize I'm eating ice cream+heavy cream.  The best semifreddo I have had until a few days ago was down at Spot Dessert Bar in EV.  But the one here, so creamy, so nutty, so light.  Tip: ask them to not pour the hot fudge over it but rather, turn the thing upside down and pour the fudge over the brownie.  The chocolate overwhelms the light semifreddo but pairs perfectly with the dense brownie underneath it.The rest of the menu, if you care and have continued reading instead of going to the Red Cat and ordering the semifreddo immediately, is also all delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the main entrees, although the duck really stands out.  Very tender, juicy, but with crispy exterior.  Beware, the portions are HUGE.  I alas did not realize this until I had already devoured the incredible bread (which was so nutty and crispy on the outside but moist and soft on the inside).  The sides are also good, but we did not order the Green Bean Tempura so I can't comment on that.Only negative, which would warrant -0.5 stars but hey, the semifreddo put me in a good enough mood to round up, would be the drinks.  They were very light on the alcohol and heavy on the sugar so I would recommend wine to go with dinner.",2,0,0,Alisa L.,"Washington, DC",76,163,6

I really expected it at least to taste good. Anyway as I cut into my small low grade chicken thigh and leg (not even breast)  I realize that it's not cooked.. What a turnoff!!  By then I lost my appetite, the server was very apologetic and nice about it. My friends entree the pork was ok. 5 minutes later I received my new chicken - which I swear was microwaved because it was steamy and not roasted or crispy. The dessert and drinks were on point..

(Tried to go to Porteno a couple of blocks up the street for lunch the other day, but found out they were closed and some Yelp reviews suggested the RC, just down the street).Rumor has it that the Red Cat is named after a red-hulled catamaran the owner either once sailed or knew about. The restaurant's been around for about 15 years, we were told, so many of you may have heard of it. It's certainly worth your time and money.We happened to be there at the very start of Restaurant Week and each had the $25 pre-fixe luncheon. We spruced it up with a couple of glasses of wine and it was incredibly good. Memorably so.My honey had a spectacular salad of bitter greens with lemony/anchovy dressing that knocked her taste buds into heaven. My celeriac soup with crab salad garnish rocked. And our fish (ocean trout) was one of the best, most simply char-roasted pieces of piscine perfection I've ever tasted. Served with a cauliflower stew-like accompaniment I never thought I would like, but fell in love with, it was the perfect meal--provided by a perfect server who helped us with our wine selections and was a complete joy.  The chocolate panna cotta provided a fitting end to the meal, which for $25/pp was worth 5 stars for sure!",2,2,2,David M.,"Denver, CO",504,851,165

Amazing flavor and I loved the texture of the burrata against the pumpkin seeds. I had the Slow Roasted Duck Breast which was really well cooked and paired amazingly with the smashed fall roots, crispy shallots and truffle vinaigrette.

To my surprise, this was the perfect accompaniment to my equally perfect glass of Cote du Rhone. We also really enjoyed our exquisitely prepared appetizers, starting with the Yellowtail Crudo ($16). FYI, ""crudo"" is the Spanish word for ""raw"" in what was basically a pretty presentation of yellowtail sashimi with orange slices, pickled kohlrabi and fennel slaw.  We also had the Chicken Liver Terrine ($14) with apple chutney and crostini (toast).

I asked him finally after the third time if I could help him and he said Is he finished yet? I replied no, and he stomped off.

Sophisticated atmosphere but still casual. Food is excellent as other reviewers mentioned here. We had chicken liver terrine as an appetizer, shrimp tacos, light tempura of green beans, and they were all delicious!My husband reserved a table for 2 to celebrate my birthday, and we got a big round table that seats 6 people right by the entrance to the kitchen where people constantly coming in and out. Awkward and uncomfortable.  The staff even joked about it and said, ""maybe you guys can fill the table by ordering lots of dishes.."" haha, not too funny. When they brought coffee, we had to ask to bring some milk and sugar...oh, and the little thing that is called, spoon. Is that something we need to look for a waiter to ask?

The hostess was lovely and asked if we would like to sit at the window seat table for 5 even though we were only three. The waitress was very nice and accommodating.BUT - the busser came over no less than FOUR time glaring at my husband's plate of food because we finished before him. It wasn't like the place was packed - there were plenty of tables - we were treating someone to lunch there so it was embarrassing - he POINTEDLY glared - finally I said Hello?/ Yes? He said is he finished - I said no. ANNOYING!!!!!!!! Will not go back, as good as my pumpkin salad was. The check for the three of us - no drinks, three entrees and one soup was $55 plus tip.

The crowd is definitely older generation, it seems more of a serious and sophisticated crowd than anything else. Kinda had a jacket and tie feel but it wasn't. The service was solid and the meal was good, but I wouldn't categorize this as a fun dinner. Seems more of a older generation date night or maybe a business meeting type place.

3.0,8/29/2013,"This place could easily be 4.5, maybe even 5 stars, if they upped their game (or got their game back) in the kitchen. Atmosphere is great, service is good sometimes great. But the food has become at best forgettable and at worst inedible. It didn't used to be this way.When I lived in Chelsea three years ago this was my go to place. I loved this restaurant. It was so versatile. You could come here for a business dinner, bring a date or just pop in by yourself for dinner at the bar (bartenders are awesome by the way). But I'd heard from friends that I'd converted back then that the food had gotten pretty spotty or down right bad over the last couple years.I went back for the first time in two years last night and I have to, sadly, agree. I got the foie gras and it was surrounded with this mash of sauces and caramelized onions. Why Red Cat kitchen? No idea if that foie gras was good, I couldn't taste it.Next I went with the pork chop, once an old favorite or go to here. It similarly came out with a mash of inexplicable accompaniments thrown in with no seeming perceivable strategy or goal. My wife had the fish, which she said wasn't bad but was bland and forgettable. And her dessert was, similarly to all of my dishes, over- engineered. I didn't get dessert even though blueberry pie sounded good until I read that the third topping Red Cats kitchen was going to gild it with was a beet sauce. Beets, walnuts and buttermilk ice cream on blueberry pie. Red Cat kitchen what are you trying to cover up? Is the new management skimping on the food quality and so you're trying hard to hide that? On second thought I decided to just stop for some gelato on the way home. No one at our table finished a single course. They weren't all bad like mine but nothing memorable. And more importantly nothing delicious. Red Cat what happened?! You used to hang your red hat on super fresh ingredients done in a straightforward way and sometimes brilliantly. At least every visit I'd get something good or even great. Now I can't figure out what you're trying to do.

It was light yet creamy and had a pop of flavor. It was a great start and highly recommended. We also both got the grilled brook trout which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. It came topped with an assortment of seasonal vegetables and a red pesto sauce- all delicious. The side of tempura green beans were an extra we wanted to try. It came out piping hot with a delicious honey mustard dipping sauce. For dessert, I got the vanilla panna cotta with strawberries and my sister got the banana ice cream sandwich. Both were amazing and equally delicious. You can't go wrong with either choice. Overall, the portions are large and filling (the side of green beans is more like a full plate, the trout covered the entire dish, the desserts are not miniature like other places). The food is not only delicious but plated and presented beautifully. With glasses of red wine and delicious food in our stomachs, we literally rolled out of the restaurant. Our server was extremely attentive and friendly. The ambiance is homey yet elegant and not too loud but not too quiet. Everything about our experience was perfect.

I sat at the bar waiting and waiting, and after it became clear that I would either eat alone or starve, I ordered a lobster salad. I don't know if it's still being offered or if it was a special at the time, but holy-mary-mother-of-god, this was the best lobster salad ever. EVER!! No arguments are permitted! I've tried others since, searched in vain for anything that comes close and it's just not possible. Theirs was the best. It was piled high in a beautiful tower flanked by fresh avocado and the lightest, most flavorful citrus dressing. Truthfully, I don't know what the hell they did to make it taste so good, but it should have a star or a planet named after it.I also had the prime NY Shell and to this day it is one of the best steaks I've ever had in NYC or anywhere else for that matter.By the time I was finished I had almost completely forgotten that my ""friend"" had never showed.

My partner and I had dinner here last night after a lovely walk on the High Line and regrettably, the food was subpar. The tempura bacon salad was thoroughly gross (too many flavors, poorly assembled, and reeked of blue cheese, which i normally like). The roast chicken was a greasy, buttery mess and not well cooked at all. Had it not been for the tempura green beans, I think I would have walked out....The service is aloof now (it used to be so nice).

Hell, it really put us in a good mood where i nearly convinced the date that we should get a table but being the people who go out more in a month than most we opted for the bar ( service at the bar in good restaurants is always infinitely superior to the service at the table. If the restaurant is lousy the bartenders still tend to do better ). We were right. The service was fantastic. The bartender was a doll with the only unfortunate part being her need to be placed in a box and match ze expectationz of ze establishment. Now the uglies:1. Oysters. Oh. My. God. Have you heard of this thing called ""Interwebz""? Marvelous invention. It has this thing called ""youtube"" which has tons of how to videos - here's one the kitchen prep staff needs to watch urgently:youtube.com/watch?v=Uy-r…That's right. The clowns could not shuck an oyster properly - they forgot to slide the knife under goodies to separate the goodies from she shell. I know, who expects the oyster on a half shell to actually slide?!?! What kind of a preposterous idea is that? Well, apparently, it is the same kind of preposterous idea as the one that says ""There shall be no sand in the oyster."" I guess no one bothered to check. I mean why would the kitchen do that?! It... it... it... just may force the cook ( the place has no chef, trust me ) to come up with a new item to deal with sandy oysters ( hello, it is called weather. you have to pay attention to that when ordering your goodies. I know. It blows my mind too, and I'm not a chef. I'm just OK with a knife. Oh and another thing. The shells laid on the frisee. 2. Snapper crudo.  I feel I shall again refer you to the interwebz - this time the lovely site known as lmgtfy.com. See, we can enter lmgtfy.com/?q=red+snappe… and magical things happen. Dozens -- no, probably hundreds --  of recipes to serve as inspiration ( or to rip them fair and square ). You know what all of them have? All of them have this magical ingredients known as  *seasoning* aka salt, pepper, maybe some other spices. Maybe some marginally well distributed lemon zest. Even that would work... but how the hell do you get all the zest into a single clump one person out of two manages to ingest completely and fully? Oh, well, if you are at the Red Cat on Friday night you totally get a single clump of the zest and nothing else... no salt.... no pepper... no seasoning... but but but wait, you know what we have ? Frisee! That's right, we have frisee! Don't you think it is lovely and green and tasty?! Oh wait, you mean you, like, had it before. So you know that in the unseasoned way it tastes like crap... Well, you aren't our usual customers - it seems they would have a hard time distinguishing tilapia from salmon if the salmon was cut thin.3. At which point we arrive at... head cheese. Pathetic. Uninspiring. Unseasoned. Utterly forgettable.  If there was any ""crispy egg yolk"" it must have been there on a quantum level where if observed it were to change its form and disappear. However, you know what it did have? Frisee. That it certainly had.4. And finally the star of the show... Bacon. Tempura. One's mouth is supposed to water just at the thought. Except that we are at the Red Cat, where the cooks like using terms that they don't understand - somewhat akin to a 5 year old using  ""thermonuclear reaction"" to describe himself taking a sip of a warm milk. There was nothing ""tempura"" like about it. Hell, there's more tempura-ish things at the ""warm prepared food"" buffet of Whole Foods. But you know what it did have? That's right. Frisee. Because it is frisee that makes the experience so awesome and wholesome that one wants to come back. Frisee makes world a better place.We thanked our lucky stars for not committing to do the entire dinner and moved on.",3,8,2,Alex Y.,"New York, NY",10,58,18
4.0,4/7/2013,"Awesome restaurant in Chelsea and a go-to for date night or for a casual dinner with friends. The menu is great with a lot of different options and you really cant go wrong with most dishes. The chicken and skate are both favorites, as are the duck fat fries to share for the table. Portions are nice sized, and everything is flavorful and cooked exactly right. Always a pleasant experience, which I think can mostly be attributable to the friendly service and the warm atmosphere.

4.0,4/4/2013,"Just had a lovely post Gagosian Gallery  dinner here tonight. It's vibe was a just the right balance of subdued and bustle for conversation. First off, the dining room imparts a warm tone of intimacy and warmth, good for either date night or, as in my case, dinner with an old friend. As it got later in the evening, the dining room eased comfortably to a warmer glow. Service was attentive, we did not have a reservation but we were luckily seated and by the time we left, the dining room was near capacity, nice energy for a Thursday night. I had the chicken livers, advertised as fried. It was tasty and the sweet and sour sauce and herbs were nice counterpoints but if they had more crunch to them, the contrast would have been more compelling. My friend had the squash and it met her expectations. It was a healthy but satisfying alternative. Her salmon entree also was well done. Nice Indian spices and cooked to order. I had the skate, evenly browned imparting a nice bite. The fish was fresh and cooked just right. It was on a bed of escarole, fresh and light. Curiously it's red pepper flakes may have been too heavy handed for the fish. Panna cotta with fresh berries was very yummy and tasted like summer. It had great texture and the ginger essence was perfect. All in all a very nice dinner. This is my second visit and will be a reliable and enjoyable go to place. Menu is very interesting, would be hard to tire of it!",0,0,0,Cynthia B.,"New York, NY",1,64,0
2.0,4/1/2013,"Very very disappointing experience! The tempura green beans were the only thing edible. My husbands burger was raw when he ordered it medium and had to send it back. My appetizer and entree came all at once and they were both inedible. One was a raw sashimi fish with a bitter orange oil and some little greens which was nasty! btw the menu that is posted online is not the menu given to us on Saturday March 30, 2013 at 7 pm. I specifically asked the waiter to describe a salad posted wanting very much a salad with a lot of greens and what I got was 4 giant pieces of grilled mushrooms that looked like grilled chicken pieces with a speck pesto that was bizarre with no greens whatever. I don't know what kind of mushroom it was but it was rubbery and tasteless. These were on the main dinner menu. The owner or manager was very present loudly admonishing the staff for dancing to the music but not noticing what was going on in his kitchen. I asked for limes with my Cosmopolitan twice and they never appeared. I can't even remember what my daughter ordered but she was miserable .

It redeemed itself with the main course (chicken) and dessert (yummy chocolate caramel tart) though.  The sides were massive too - more than enough for 3 people to share.All in all a really nice meal and great atmosphere - would be tempted to try off the set menu next time to see if the food would be any better (but not sure if my purse strings will allow!)",0,0,0,Alice C.,"New York, NY",0,2,0

3.0,12/8/2012,"I've been dining at this Chelsea restaurant since it opened and it has gone through many transitions. Unfortunately, my two most recent dining experiences were less than stellar. The problem is that the current chef has a habit of combining ingredients that fight each other rather than compliment each other. This evening, I ordered Roasted Eggplant Soup with white bean crouton and blistered tomatoes. What I received was a soup that was so overwhelmed with garlic and tomato, that the eggplant couldn't be tasted.  My entree was Atlantic Salmon with Couscous. What I received was a sliver of Salmon that was cooked medium well rather than medium rare (as I was told the chef prepared it) and the Couscous was a spicy concoction that, while delicious, didn't mesh with the Salmon which tasted  fine, but nothing more. Dessert was a shared chocolate hazelnut parfait with dried fruit compote. What arrived at the table looked nothing like a parfait but both my dining partner and I enjoyed it.  Service was excellent given the number of tables that our server had. So, to sum up: my problem with this restaurant lies with the current chef who seems to pair flavors that fight each other rather than compliment each other. The food is very good, overall, the decor is fine but if you are there when the restaurant is full, you'll have to speak VERY loudly for your dining partner to hear you .

I'll have to admit, my cocktail was rather bland but the Sweater was much zestier. After being seated we decided to order an amazing bottle of pinot noir (sorry, forgot the name) and two appetizers and two entrees. The breakdown:Quick Saute of Zucchini: It was okay. Kind of bland and too salty for my personal preference. Burrata: The red and yellow beets are delicious and the burrata itself... just to die for. It's super fresh and gooey, not like the harder stuff you buy in the grocery store. DELICIOUS!Pan Seared Duck Breast: Cooked very well, the tart cherry jus is nice, and I really did enjoy the dish, but... it just didn't blow me away. Pork Tenderloin: Honestly, after a cocktail and a half a bottle of wine, I don't think I even tasted this. But I do know the mashed potatoes it was sitting on were scrumptious.

My grilled salmon with sautéed baby bok choy, cremini and red curry butter was relatively good. The crust was really crispy which I really liked. But the two dishes that impressed me the most were the burrata with eggplant caponata, sliced prosciutto and roasted peppers and the pistachio semifreddo with hot fudge, creme fraiche and brownie. The prosciutto was some of the best I've ever tasted and completed the dish. The semifreddo was one of the best desserts I've ever had (and I'm a dessert freak).

3.0,6/20/2012,"i'm feeling very conflicted about red cat at the moment.  a friend was visiting on business, and i suggested the restaurant - i'd been before, and the food is fantastic.  and it was again this time - the burrata, the skate, the apple beignets - all of it was perfect.  that was until we went to pay...and the waitress lost my friend's credit card.  not just any card - her corporate card that she was using to pay for some huge expenses while she was visiting.  we immediately checked the table, under it, our seats, our bags - gone.  instead of helping us look, the wait staff mainly stood to the side and watched.  they kept insinuating that it was our fault, that we lost the card.  i asked to look through the small books that the checks come in, thinking that maybe it got slipped into another book by accident and was told no, i could not do that.  the manager finally came over and took my friend's info to call her if the card turned up later.  my friend was clearly distressed, and the tone they took was ""well, sucks to be you!""  there was no offer to comp our drinks, our dessert, nothing.  instead they acted like we were a huge inconvenience.  so yes, the food at red cat is amazing.  you won't go wrong there.  i just can't go back, at least not for awhile.  it was just so disappointing to be treated so poorly when we did nothing wrong.",2,0,0,Amanda J.,"Manhattan, NY",2,4,0

The tables were cramped and servers were constantly squeezing themselves into the narrow spaces which made me very uncomfortable.  Certainly not for a romantic or business dinner but for young people who like to yell and scream at each other.  The food too was surprisingly mediocre for the average 4 star revews .

4.0,5/16/2012,"I had read some good reviews on yelp about the red cat in the past and hoped to try it out which I eventually did with a friend on a Sunday.I must say my dinner experience was definitely worth writing about. Getting a reservation was really easy w/o any wait.Ambience: it had a classy modern look to it with dim red lightening. On entering we noticed that they seemed to be a lot of older couples and families seating at the tables so we opted for bar seating which seemed more casual.Food: I definitely enjoyed every bit of my meals For appetizers I had the tempura green beans with some tangy/spicy sauce (was told by the bartender had wasabi in it). The beans were really crunchy and seemed to melt in your mouth with each bite. The tangy sauce gave the beans a great flavored kick leaving you wanting to more of it, especially since I really enjoy spicy food.For dinner I had the Polenta. For a first time polenta eater I must say I became a fan!!. I definitely enjoyed the marinara sauce with the mozzarella cheese. It kind of tasted like lasagna but 10times better.For dessert I had the banana ice-cream sandwich. From looking me the name I expected it to look like an actual sandwich. Although I was quite disappointed in my expectation I did get the best tasting dessert. It came with a really nice caramel cake with a scoop of peanut butter ice-cream and then some crunchy peanuts on the side (delish!!!).Drinks: I gave my review a four star based on their drink menu, not much stuck out on their drink menu, so I had a glass of regular champagne.Service: I enjoyed their overall service. The bartender was awesome and really friendly. The service was very prompt.Overall recommendation: It's definitely a great date spot or a restaurant for a night out with the family.I would definitely return for some great polenta and amazing green beans.",0,0,0,Ivie O.,"Manhattan, NY",165,9,0

We had to wait about 20-25 minutes for our reserved table to be ready, which the hostess was beyond apologetic about. No harm done (I've had to wait for over an hour for a reserved table on a busy Friday night in many NYC restaurants, so this was nothing).The fiance and I ordered from the restaurant week menu. I had the butternut squash soup (enjoyable, but a bit too sweet. I prefer a spicier/savory butternut squash soup), salmon (delicious. I ate every bit even though halfway through I thought I was possibly going to throw up after being so full), and the bread pudding (I'm not a dessert person, so I ordered it for the table. As far as bread pudding goes, it was good). The fiance had the fried zucchini and risotto (pretty bland), the pork tenderloin (DELICIOUS, better than the salmon), and the bread pudding (uh, see previous review).My friends ordered from the regular menu, and their food looked really good (they had the bacon wrapped squash stuffed dates and the chicken liver appetizers and the cod and burger as entrees). They seemed to enjoy everything they had, but quite honestly, the chicken liver looked AMAZING.If I went back, I would definitely order that. Who knew liver could look so tempting {insert overused joke about census takers, fava beans, and chianti}?There is one major drawback to The Red Cat, though. They have a pretty horrendous and MAJORLY overpriced drink menu. The glass of wine I had (a rioja for $13, the cheapest glass on the menu being I think $11) was pretty underwhelming. The cocktail menu doesn't deliver (the cocktails my group had ""sounded better on paper""), and the beer is overpriced and not that great of a selection.Yes, I'm a drink snob.

1.0,10/16/2011,"I agree with Raj W. This was ""amateur night"" all the way.I was there with business colleagues on Friday night, and most of us were quite disenchanted. The food was nothing to write home about, and overpriced to boot. Plus, five of us out of a party of six had to send our food back because four of us ordered well done burgers and they were rare. One lady ordered pork, and it was rare, as well. I had to send my burger back twice because it was still bloody. To make matters worse, the waitress copped an attitude, so my colleague asked to see the manager. He, too, got snippy, told us that the food looked just fine to him, then informed us that our waitress implied that we were difficult. Uh, excuse me, but when five people send their food back for being undercooked, I think this is a reflection on the restaurant, not the customers. Regardless, you don't get defensive and argue with customers, no matter what.Then when we got the bill, there was a glass of wine we didn't order on there, and the manager gave us a hard time about taking this off.These are just some of the issues we encountered.

4.0,9/15/2011,"Real solid NY Restaurant, tucked away on 10th ave in Chelsea... out of the tourists reach!Looking for a not to pricey, quality restaurant in Manhattan is tough.  The ""cheap"" options of all the chains in midtown are completely out of the question for me.So seeing this place is still fairly new, and has be getting a nice reputation, it was time to give it a go.The menu as they say is Contemporary American, so you won't see too many surprises on there, but the taste will seem anything but ordinary for sure.  Appetizers we did the Pate` and Soft Shell Crab (it is one of those things, anytime I see it, I have to have it!)  Both were good, not too great, but there were plenty of options on the app list that I would not mind trying next time.Entree;  the thing that I like with a few of the places I have been trying lately is that you order the entree, and then the sides or vegetables you want it to go with.  Here the Entree came with a little something extra, but not a full plate, so picking and choosing some sides or vegetables you will find some gems.  The three of us got the Organic Chicken,  the Pork Cutlet, and the Grilled (rare) Salmon.The chicken had a crispy fried exterior kept it nice and juicy inside, over a bed of rice, peppers and olives... real real good.The pork was just plain huge!  But it got a nice thumbs up, and the salmon was cooked exactly how requested, and was delicious because of it.The sides are what stole the show.  Something as simple as Polenta is what we all agreed would keep us coming back.  It was AMAZING!  Not sure what they could have done differently, but it was very very good.Wrap up;Whatever you get, it may be something familiar, but with a nice little twist on it, enough to make you feel like it's new.  But whatever you go with, get the Polenta on the side.... seriously!Very cool vibe to this place, laid back, but not so much that they forgot about decor.  Nice diversified menu, wine and beer lists, interesting art pieces hung all around to give it a good look, but nothing too outlandish.  The one thing that got me a little bit was the music.  Ambiance, as pretentious as a word it is, is real important.  Whatever it is should just add a little accent, not jump right out at you.  Here the music choice felt like someone just put all the hits of the 50s 60s and 70s into a blender and spit it out... and not the good hits.  Going from  Little Richard to CCR can make for an uncomfortable ear!  I have no problem with either but they do not belong on the same playlist... ever!  It got worse than that as well.",1,0,0,Nick C.,"Bayside, NY",72,203,304

3.0,9/2/2011,"Great atmosphere, even though quite loud. Really liked the lightning, red walls, and the wood cantilever over the bar near the door. Service was also very good. The meal, overall, was good, but there were some misses. I started with the heirloom tomato gazpacho which was essentially a flawless puree of tomato, cucumber, oil, and acid of some sort (guessing it's vinegar) garnished with 2 baby plum tomato halves (one of which was unfortunately wrinkled and tasted past its prime) and avocado chunks. The baby radish sprouts were more than just a garnish, they added a nice earthy heat. It was not smokey on my palate in the least. I found it to be one of the best gazpachos I've eaten. My husband started with the lime cilantro caesar salad. He asked for light dressing and it still came doused. It was also nothing special. You couldn't really taste the lime, although the cilantro was pronounced. He suggested that you might find this at any upscale Tex-Mex restaurant. My husband ordered the pork carnitas special -- pulled pork mixed with a jicama and other vegetable salad. No tortillas, which is fine. We're just not used to having taco fillings served without wrapper. The meat was moist and flavorful. I had the pan roasted chicken, which could have fed 3 people. It is cooked bone-in, so you can cut out the yummy little oyster. The skin was perfectly crisp but in my view needed both salt and pepper and/or some other seasoning. However, the meat itself in many places was a bit dry. It came on a mound of Portuguese rice with Linquica sausage, roasted peppers, and green olives. To me, the rice was quite bland and the whole dish could have used a bit of heat. A different type of Portuguese sausage, one with may be more heat and garlic, would have been nice. We finished with apple beignets with cinnamon caramel and vanilla cream. My husband loved these. From my perspective, they were phenomenal flavor-wise but a textural flop. I felt they needed to deep fry them at a higher oil temperature ... there was no crispness to them at all. Nice wine by the glass list. Finished with decent decaf cappuccinos.",0,0,0,Dana R.,"Seattle, WA",45,470,0

4.0,8/30/2011,"My first time here.  The hostess, Cameron, was very gracious, as the rest of our party of 6 was late by close to 30 minutes and it seemed quite busy. As I waited I took a seat at the bar. The bar staff lacked any sort of personality... I was thrown a menu by the female bartender and had to flag down the other one that was not chatting up some friends at the end of the bar to order a beverage while waiting for the aforementioned tardy dining companions.  The guy who took my drink order seemed overwhelmed at the task of filling in for this ""friendly"" bartendress, but he made a good drink and responded quickly to my one other request, despite the din of the room.At the dining table was a wholly different.  Attentive, knowledgeable service greeted the five of us. If the fontina garlic fondue is an appetizer special, order it! Fantastic to share. The tempura green beans were very good, not quite a classic tempura, rather the batter was minimal and not greasy at all, and the slightly mustardy dipping sauce was a good counterpoint. To start, I had the gazpacho which was tasty, though a bit rich with smokey tomato and avocado flavors. For the main courses we had the skate (order the dill butter sauce on the side as it is rather heavy), the pork cutlet and the tilefish. I thought the skate was as good as any French preparation, or better since it wasn't awash in butter. Flakey, light and the hazelnut romesco sauce underneath added a depth of unexpected pleasure!  Though I didn't taste it, one of my dining companions was not a fan of the sour cream cucumber sauce with the tilefish, but liked my dill sauce with it.All in all a strong dining experience with the exception of the bar.  Fun, casual and lively... just the way I like it!",0,0,0,Stacy J.,"San Diego, CA",0,12,0

However, I really couldn't hear the music at all over the raucous conversation of the patrons. Either way, I wouldn't advise choosing this place for a first date unless your name is Lil' Jon and your typical dialogue goes something like this, ""WHATTTTT? WHAAAAAAT? YEAAAAAH? OKAAAAAAY! WHAAAAAT?""But I digress. The food was superb in every facet. Taste, presentation, texture, layering, etc. I had the golden gazpacho w/ avocado and tuna tartare to start. It was incredible. For my entrée I had the skate upon the recommendation of my friend and fellow yelper Dan T. I'm glad I took his advice because the skate was one of the best cooked fish I've had in a while. It was flavorful, flakey, soft, juicy without being soggy, and loved every bite of it. Our table shared the tempura snow peas which I thought were above average.

Those bartenders make a mean one, best one I've ever had was from this place.Not a large menu selection which I actually love, because you know every item on the menu is done up just right. Our waiter was super knowledgeable especially about the wine list. If they have the pierogi with truffles as one of their specials I definitely recommend it. Anyone who has ever cooked duck knows it can be difficult to render and work with but I had the duck that was cooked to perfection. My fiance started with the marinated artichokes which were tab bit citrus-y but extremely refreshing followed by had the pork loin which was beyond juicy. Picked a great full bodied Tuscan blend that was off the hook. 75 bucks a pop but HIGHLY recommended. My only two gripes were that you're a bit well, squished. The tables could have been a bit more spaced out. I also was not a fan of the dessert Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Tart that we ordered. Chill vibe, great music! Good for couples.

2.0,3/5/2011,"Came here on a Friday night at 615. Was seated quickly and waitstaff were very friendly and professional. They have a pretty solid wine list but big markups. We got the Pinot Noir 2009, Spy Valley (New Zealand) which was $62 on the menu. You can get it for $20 on the net so you have a 300% markup there. My wife and I both ordered the grilled pork loin and my mom got the calves liver. For some reason both my wife and I were thinking pork TENDERloin but that is not what we got. What we got was something like a dry, boneless pork chop. Not much flavor there and really unimpressive. My wife took a few bites and couldn't eat anymore. The sides on the dish, including the mash potatoes were really good though. My mom clearly won here as her calves liver was really flavorful. If we came back I would definitely go for that. I'm not sure why this place is rated so well. It may just be that the pork loin is not one of their better dishes.

2.0,2/4/2011,"I wanted to like this warm-farm-fresh, red-and-white place. I'd been there several years ago and I'd liked the crowd and the food.Now, however, the prices have gone up and what was solid then is now overpriced ($10-14 for apps, $26-$36 for an entree). For this price point, you're looking at the top restaurants in the city, which this place just isn't, for several reasons:(1) It's overcrowded and VERY noisy. ""I can't hear what you just said"" was a frequent refrain to my dining companion, and he was half yelling. I was afraid to move for fear of knocking over the next table's water glass and I could not breathe.(2) The service is slow when it's crowded. It took a long time for them to give us our menus, and when there was a problem, it took the restaurant forever to get my food back to me (the pork was red in the middle, indicating that it was undercooked). My companion had already finished most of his food by the time mine came back.(3) The food is not imaginative enough. It is solid -- the pork was tender and juicy and the thyme on it was very nice -- but that isn't enough to get me in the door, without some other surprising combination of flavors. The zucchini saute, which was reviewed well in NYMag, had some nice nutty bite, but it lacked the freshness of really top-notch produce, plus the cheese on it was slightly overbaked, which made the dish too oily.I'd rather go elsewhere.(For these prices, Telepan, on the upper west side, for example, has consistently served me amazingly tasty, creative and fresh food, there's plenty of breathing room, and the service is much faster. The one time they ever goofed up in the kitchen, they apologized and comped me the food.  Or if you want closer, Westville is only a few blocks away, is $5-$10 cheaper per entree, has food at about the same quality of the Red Cat, and they, too, have elbow room.)",4,0,0,Kimberly W.,"San Jose, CA",96,38,6

4.0,8/13/2010,"Really nice ambiance with kind of a country/casual feel. I think it could be romantic enough for a date but there's definitely a decent amount of noise. The service was great, our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable. One thing they did well, which I feel is hard to find in a lot of places, was pace the meal well. We were able to enjoy our food and wine without being rushed, but we never had to wait for anything for too long, either. The food was great - simple new american. The tuna ceviche appetizer was really fresh and delicious. I had the shell steak, which was shockingly huge. It was cooked as I'd ordered it and about three meals worth of actual meat.

4.0,8/12/2010,"I don't live on the west side so whenever anyone says they want to meet on 10th or 11th ave, I'm a little hesitant. However, Red Cat is one of a few places that makes the trek worthwhile. I met a couple of newlywed friends out for Saturday ""lunch"" (as the Red Cat calls it), and based on the atmosphere, I kinda felt like I was 3rd-wheeling it. Considering the sun was shining and it was daytime, I thought the room would be better lit, but instead, the dimly lit interior made it more ideal for 1st dates or a lunch rendezvous. Regardless, we got our lunch started with a little liquid--while my dark & stormy was solid, my friend worshiped his bourbon-based cocktail...it was pretty apparent that the lunch-time bartender knew a thing about mixing. What I really liked about Red Cat's lunch menu was its versatility--it had a couple breakfast dishes for those who must have their eggs in the afternoon, and it had more substantive lunch dishes for those, aka me, who can move on through the day without breakfast. My roasted chicken (one of my standbys) was excellent, although a little on the small side. The skin-side was crispy, the meat was juicy, and the unique ""raw and cooked vegetable salad"" underneath provided an interesting acidic and textural contrast...definitely different from the usual sides of mashed potatoes or string beans. My friend's bbq corned beef sandwich was definitely the hungry-man plate on the menu: corned beef was overflowing out of the pumpernickel bread, and it was accompanied by some homemade potato chips. His wife's pork carnitas salad looked pretty good too. Red Cat's tempura green beans were the perfect share-dish and satisfied all. Originally, we asked for tempura bacon but it's a seasonal dish and they wouldn't make it despite my pleading. However, the plate of green beans we received was enormous, and it was accompanied by an equally addictive creamy mustard. The tempura batter was golden and slightly crunchy but despite the frying, the beans weren't that greasy--there was no constant wiping of fingers on my napkin.  Most importantly, I got my greens. Red Cat's been around awhile but my first visit was a revelation. Aside from the lighting, it delivered on food, service, and drinks.

4.0,8/12/2010,"We went to the Red Cat for the first time last evening.  When I made the reservation online, the latest slot was 6:15.   That's usually a sign that either the place is very good or it is a spot just enjoying a trendy spike.  Since this place has been around for years, I assumed the former.  I am delighted to report that it is because of the food and service.We had a bit of sticker shock when seeing the prices of wine and cocktails.  Since I was armed with a 30% discount, my sticker shock faded right away.  We split the pancetta wrapped sweetbread appetizer.  When it arrived, it was a very small portion.  But the flavor and freshness and the sweet and sour eggplant that accompanied it made up for the diminutive size.  We both ordered the skate wing and, it was a fairly good portion and was served over a salad of sorts with grapefruit sections and frisee lettuce.  It was excellent.Desert consisted of three plump beignets filled with warm ricotta cheese and served with delicious fruit preserves and balsamic vinegar sauce.  Again, wonderful.  Now I understand why everyone in New Orleans goes gaga over them.We plan to return again, even at the regular prices.

Service was uneven, primarily because they seemed too busy to stop by; this was true throughout the meal, even later in the evening when many tables had cleared out.  Otherwise, the waitstaff were fine.  The food delivery was rather slow.Of the food I had or tried, the highlights were the baked polenta piping hot in a bright tomato sauce and Parmesan topping, tempura green beans delicate and light.  Other dishes that were fairly good if not very memorable were sauteed skate wing, pancetta wrapped veal sweetbread, diver scallops, and herbed french fries.  So-so was somewhat bland grilled pork chops, somewhat overcooked calves liver, and unremarkable panna cotta strawberry shortcake that was the only thing I didn't want to finish.Overall, this first dining experience was ok but not impressive.  Some food was quite good but not most, although decent and interesting enough.  The very slow service was a big negative and hopefully isn't a regular thing.  I would try again but not rushing to.",0,0,0,Valery C.,"Forest Hills, NY",56,837,9616

In a city replete with peripatetic chefs and whimsical reinventions Red Cat holds its ground - rocking from day one and not changing an iota since. Why mess with what is virtually perfect? Have you tried their lightly-battered tempura string beans? They're ridiculous! And the bartender generally has a heavy hand so you count on your drinks being worth the Manhattan prices.

The grilled trout had way too much tiny fish bones that made the dish almost a pain to eat.  It could be the nature of the fish but I don't remember encountering the same when I had trout in other places.  On the other hand, the Sauteed Zucchini is absolutely delicious and so was the Tempura Green Beans.  The Yellowfin and Yellowtail appetizer--a play on sashimi--was also tasty though less memorable.  Finally, the Strawberry Bread Pudding is just ok.",0,0,0,John T.,"Portsmouth, NH",19,50,20

Okay: onto other dishes.  The quick saute of zucchini: kudos to the chef for doing something so simple and refreshing.  Asparagus Risotto: nice and creamy.Pistachio Semifreddo: I could have used a bit of a darker and more intense chocolate taste with a more intense pistachio flavor.

Next time try something objective like ""it's 4 cups of beans"" or ""about the size of a platter this big"" because when this app arrived it took over our entire table!Also, my friend ordered the skate only to be told later they had run out. I hate it when that happens. Let us know before we order!We also had the burrata, the skate was replaced with the tuna carpaccio, and we had an order of the pork tenderloin.

Ingredients were fresh and flavored just right. Nothing was too salty which is a problem I often encounter when eating out. I was hesitant to order sashimi but it turned out to be fresh, smooth and buttery. The sweetbreads were came as thick chunks seared on the outside and served with citrus-y rhubarb. It was a nice combination. I was pleasantly surprised by the endive salad. Each leaf had a thin coating of Stilton (blue-like) cheese topped with cranberries and pecans.

We ended up at Red Cat after our other brunch reservations fell through and needed a place that could accommodate a party of 8 at the last minute. Someone suggested Red Cat and we were off. Slightly Underwhelming Items /why I probably won't be back:1) This is the only restaurant remaining in nyc it seems that does not have a legitimate brunch menu. Where are the Eggs Benedict, I ask!

4.0,4/5/2010,"Go hungry - and for god's sake check your diet at the door! The food here is not for the faint of heart. The only reason I was able to enjoy it so much, is that I don't have to know for sure how much butter was harmed in the making of this meal. We kicked things off with prosecco all round - coz that's how we roll! C saw the fontina cheese appetizer special and just could not resist - a large dish of bubbling hot melty cheese, mixed up with garlic and heaven knows what else (probably butter) was lovingly delivered to our table. In case you missed that - a bowl of HOT MELTED CHEESE! The only reason we didn't finish our main courses (cod, salmon and lamb) was because we ate a whole lot of fresh Italian bread dipped in HOT MELTED CHEESE. The baked polenta was also consequently a little neglected by us (deliciously cheesy too) but I made a valiant effort to polish off the tempura green beans. To give you an idea how good these were ... I don't even eat green beans normally...sublime - with a just-peppery-enough honey mustard dip.

5.0,3/22/2010,"Wow. I picked the Red Cat for my family birthday dinner mainly because of the location, one block west of Boyfriend's grandma's house. I'm giving them five stars because they were incredibly accommodating and had super delicious food.We were a party of 8, and they set us up in front of the window at a nice spacious table. This was especially great because Boyfriend's grandma uses a walker, which can make navigating crowded restaurants difficult. Instead, we were just inside with door, with a great view of the street, and we were able to store the walker right behind us. When I had called to make a reservation, I told them that my brother has celiac and diabetes, which means that he can't eat wheat but still needs to eat carbohydrates. When I arrived, I started to remind them, but they knew what I was talking about before the words were out of my mouth, and assured me that the waitress was well aware of the situation and would be ready to answer any questions. Needless to say, I was really impressed with the service.I also liked the decor, which struck a nice balance between simple and upscale. You could definitely come here in jeans, but you could also dress up a bit if the mood struck you. I would want to come back and eat at the bar, which I bet is fun. Overall, I liked it because it was a very nice place for a special occasion without being overly fancy or stuffy. It also wasn't too loud or dimly lit, which made it a good venue for our two families to meet for the first time.Of course, the most important part of any restaurant is the food, and that's where they really shined. Everything was really delicious and well executed. Also, they used a lot of bacon, which is always a good thing in my book. Clearly, they know good food at the Red Cat. My family and Boyfriend's family are both really big on sharing, so I was able to try a ton of different things. The appetizers I sampled were the fontina macaroni with pepperoni, the artichoke bagna cauda with hardboiled egg, the celeriac cauliflower soup, and the wilted radicchio salad. The pasta was probably the best of them, and was really deliciously cheesy and creamy. The sliced pepperoni was a really nice smokey touch, and there was a nice crispy topping with some sprouts. The celeriac soup was tasty, and was one of many dishes with bacon in it. I wasn't quite as in love with the two veggie dishes, but they were still pretty good. The artichokes were good at first, but it was a huge portion and I didn't want all of them. After awhile, they began to taste a little bland, especially for a dish served cold, and there wasn't enough of the delicious bagna cauda (anchovy paste) for all of them. I didn't feel like the egg added anything to the dish. The radicchio had some tasty elements-- bacon, apple slices and a tasty dressing-- but there wasn't quite enough of them to balance the radicchio's natural bitterness. As for the entrees, I tried the rack of lamb and the calves liver with the bacon and swiss chard pie and melted tomatoes. Both were phenomenal. Just really, really delicious. I'm not the biggest fan of liver, so I don't think I could ever eat a whole entree of it, but the pie was just incredible, to the point I'd be tempted to order this dish just to get a whole bacon swiss chard pie to call my own. They also had a great sounding suckling pig special, but I didn't get to try that because my brother was off at the other end of the table and very quietly devoured his entire plate while everyone else was sharing and passing forks and plates across the table. He has no shame. I also didn't get to try the cod dish, but Boyfriend's mom seemed to really enjoy it. The desserts were also fabulous. I got the crispy fried lemon cheesecake over cooked blueberries. I loved the sugary crisp top and the warm creamy center. Lemon and blueberry is always a great flavor combo. My mom's pistachio semi-freddo with hot fudge was an amazingly chocolatey delight. I loved the contrasting textures of the silky panna cotta, the crunchy nuts, and chocolatey cake, and the presentation was great, with the fudge poured table side. I also tried small bites of the profiteroles, the carrot cake and cream cheese ice cream, and the banana ice cream sandwich. Good stuff all around. This was a wonderful birthday dinner.

4.0,3/5/2010,"When you hear about something called Tempura Bacon, you have to try it.  So off we went to Red Cat in search of a new porxperience.  (A google search confirms that I just coined that term, so you read it here first).  The tempura bacon was amazing and definitely the best part of the meal.  It's not about the flavor so much as it about the texture... it was so tender it felt like the bacon was literally melting in your mouth.  I don't think I've ever had this experience with bacon before.  The other appetizers (fontina macaroni, crab rangoons) were good but nothing to write home about.  And the same goes for the short rib that I had for the main course... good, but it doesn't come close to measuring up to Jean Georges or BLT Prime.  Get the string beans with sweet hot mustard as a side, and you won't be disappointed with that.The dessert I had was the pistachio semifreddo, which was VERY good, esp since I love pistachio and drenching it in chocolate sauce makes it just that much better.So what to say about Red Cat?  You have to come here to try the bacon and the string beans, and some dessert.  But without amazing main courses it's hard to say I would come back again.  Just a solid 4-star place that's a good choice if you're going to be in the area anyway.",0,0,0,Chad T.,"Manhattan, NY",52,776,127

To start, we got the frisée salad (one of my favorite salads so it was exciting to find on the menu) and the beet salad. I was also pleased to find mussels as the main dish- they came in a saffron sauce that I've never had and pretty good, crispy fries. mmm! We also got the roast chicken, which tasted good, but was a little dry. The dessert was the most guilty pleasure you could imagine- a pear crumble. It was beautiful and delicious.

Daring. My dish was ... interesting. I don't know if I would do sweet and sour on skate again, but it was worth a venture. The calves liver seemed to be a better choice for my dining partner, though I passed on his offer for me to try.

Nice! Tables are tight and this place is loud. No real insulation to absorb noise with wooden floors, walls and tin ceiling. It just ads to the ambiance. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable.They have a nice wine selection and a few interesting cocktails. Someone ordered the Cherry Masher cocktail. It was delicious! For a restaurant whose website plays Willie Nelson, I was a bit surprised that the bar lacked Jack Daniels. I was offered Jim Beam as a substitute, which any bourbon drinker knows is a poor substitute at best. I'm pretty sure I made a face of some sort. Oh well, Makers Mark filled in as his second suggestion. On the plus side, they had these fantastic marinated cherries for my Manhattan. They made the drink. For dinner I ordered the Pan Roasted Salmon, with warm Brussels sprout salad, carrot ginger puree and walnut pesto. I don't even like Brussels sprouts. They were delicious! Clean plate club. My dining companions ordered the mussel appetizers, Fontina macaroni, herbed french fries, oven roasted cauliflower. I could go back just to work my way through the appetizer and vegetable menu.

4.0,2/1/2010,"It was a cold and blustery Saturday night in Chelsea when my companion and I hobbled into The Red Cat for our dinner reservations.  We decided to try it out for restaurant week, or so we thought.  After being seated at our intimate little table, we noticed the waiter didn't leave the menus specifically for restaurant week.  I ask him what the deal is.  He (very politely) tells me that restaurant week is every day but Saturday.  Stupid me...shoulda read the fine print.  No matter.  The prices at The Red Cat are reasonable enough to get an appetizer and full-sized entrée for the same price as a restaurant week prix fixe menu would have provided.  In fact, THANK GOD restaurant week didn't apply that night because then I would have never been able to experience the BACON TEMPURA with black-eyed peas and baby 'bello mushrooms.  Holy hell, I could eat that dish every day.  They say bacon makes everything better, but imagine thick-cut bacon (3 huge slices) deep-fried in the lightest, fluffiest, crispiest tempura batter you've ever had and piled on top of black-eyed peas with mushrooms lightly swimming in a salty broth of heaven!  I ordered this dish because of my love of bacon and because it sounded interesting.  Ted Allen said this dish was one of the best things he's ever eaten and I'm gonna go ahead and second that.  This dish was positively divine.  Bacon lovers, rejoice!For my entrée, I ordered the grilled pork tenderloin with blue cheese-tomato gratin served with wilted spinach and caramelized onions.  It was innovative and had all the things I like in one dish, but, unfortunately, was under seasoned for my taste.  I was just grateful to find a pork dish that didn't involve apples as an accompaniment.  The pork itself was perfectly cooked and very tender, but I had to add a fair amount of salt to bring out the flavors.We were so stuffed from the gracious appetizer and entrée portions that we declined desert.  The wine list offers a nice array of wines both by the glass and bottle and the full bar seems like a fun place to hang out at if you don't have a table or if you're waiting for one to open up.  I got a great feeling from dining at The Red Cat.  The other diners were clearly people from the neighborhood and NYC locals.  The staff was completely helpful and knowledgeable of the menu.  All in all, this was a very good dining experience and, truth be told, my companion and I wound up spending about 50 cents more ordering regular priced appetizers and entrées than if we'd had the restaurant week menu option.  Very satisfying, indeed.",2,0,2,Catherine C.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,21,1

5.0,11/29/2009,"I'm going to give this place a good review as it was a delicious and not over the top dining experience.Its casual enough that you can come in wearing jeans and a nice shirt and not feel too out of place. The menu covers the meat spectrum with an options for everyone no matter what their protein of choice is; however, not much more than that. They have bacon in nearly everything. The salads, the main courses, but sadly missing from the dessert menu. The bacon isn't in your face but it seemed to be in everything we ordered, so perhaps you can say they've embraced the Bacon trend. The stand out dish in my opinion was the risotto. Deliciously spicy with sausage, mushrooms and a small bit of cheese too. The salads are good too. As for the main courses we enjoyed all of the ones we ordered but I will say of the fish I ordered thats it was cooked perfectly. Still tender and moist, but seasoned well on the outside. They have an excellent wine menu. Very extensive, but don't overlook the cocktails. A few of them are real treats. It's not often a place has the guts to put an old fashioned style drink with egg in it on the menu. If you order it, let me know how it is. Drinking raw egg scares me.Dessert was good also. As I only ordered sorbet, I can't rave as the sorbet was good- but there's a limit on how good it can get. Overall, definitely an upscale, but somewhat laid back dining experience.

The Red Cat is a pleasant- looking restaurant with red accents and a slightly country feel to it. We started with some drinks. The wine list was nice with a bunch of reasonable ""by the glass"" options, as well as a cocktail menu. There are many appetizers on the menu that look really appealing, such as the apple, beet, and fennel salad, fried cheddar grits, and spiced kobacha squash salad. However, we were just here for lunch and did not want to over-stuff ourselves. For entrees, the grilled brook trout, crispy skate sandwich, and fusilli col buco were ordered. While I did not taste the trout or pasta, they both looked tasty and well prepared. The crispy skate sandwich was yummy and an interesting twist on a fish sandwich. We all shared the tempura green beans, which were out of this world! Really a must!

This caused the fish to cool down much quicker than it should have and made the dish less enjoyable.-My husband's suckling pork tacos were outstanding, yum.-The cheese course was great too, but again served a bit too cold. Cheese should NOT be cold, otherwise you can't taste all the yummy savory flavor. All in all, I liked it enough to come back and the food was tasty even if it was not perfect.

It was dimly lit, and people were chatting and not moving or leaving any time soon. Though the part that annoyed me was how the hostess was being retarded. First she said 25 min, then she seated people who came in after us, then she told us our table was ready, then she said it wasn't, and that our table was in the back instead, and let 2 people sit at a table for 5 people. wtf? Seriously, do you need to read your job description?The bacon tempura was $10, and honestly not worth the price. The bacon at Peter Luger's tastes better, and is thicker and doesn't cost that much. Yes, they managed to fry it and not make it curl and keep it straight, and yes the pile of corn it was sitting on was tasty. But damnit $10 for 2 slices of bacon? I tried it, and you know what? it was ok, but I wouldn't go back for more.Their duck is quite tasty, though if you don't like radishes, don't get this one. Their pork tenderloin was almost perfect except for the excess of cheese on it. Their skate wing, was pretty good. Its a fish, a stingray fish actually. Tasty too, has the same texture as stingray. Service inside the restaurant was good, water was constantly being filled, the waitress would check up on us. Just that the hostess was being dumb.

It came with some salady stuff, but the steak was the superstar. Could have been a few more pieces of steak, that's my only gripe. It was like 6 small strips, but it made me appreciate the meal that much more.My girl had the Sirloin burger with Cheddar cheese and bacon on a Kaiser bun. ""Nice and juicy "" she just said. She looked like she was enjoying it judging from the double the normal size bites she was taking! The bacon, which she let me sample, was deliciously smokey and quite meaty. The burger was also pretty tasty, better than the usual burgers out there.We finished off with a plate of 3 cheeses; a Portugesue hard cheese called Nisa which was great because it had little crystals in it. A French soft cheese which was something like half soft goat, half brie, except the goat part was very fluffy, almost aerated. ""Very cake like texture"", my girl says. The last one was a hard Wisconsin cheese (we think called Upland) which was a pretty good bridge between the 2. Buttery, mild, very tasty.The coffee was a bit weak in strength but flavorful, and it came in a mini press.

I showed up about 15 minutes before my actual reservation and had to awkwardly stand in between the front hall and the restaurant entrance. The front of the restaurant is chaotic and over packed and I am not a girl who deals well with crowds in small confined places. In retrospect I should have just come on time. Oh well, being early meant more drinking time for me. I had a pisco sour at the bar while I waited and was content. On to the food! The tempura green beans definitely live up to the hype. They were fresh, light, and crispy. So perfect and tasty. I had problems picking out an entree so I had to close my eyes and do the eeny-meeny-miney-mo deal. I ended up having the Olive Oil Poached Cod. I'm really sad that I was way too full to finish all the food on my plate. But I would've licked my plate clean if I could have. Yes, it was that good! I will definitely come back so that I can try the rest of the menu.",1,1,1,Nancy D.,"New York, NY",321,343,75
5.0,6/16/2009,"A late Sunday brunch turned into an early Sunday dinner at The Red Cat, and my friend and I made sure to put as many meals into one as we could.  To that end, we split a pitcher of sangria, two appetizers, two entrees, a side, and three desserts.  I believe our server was impressed.Before I get into the extravagant meal, let me say a word about the service.  In short, it was awesome.  The greeters were charming and friendly and our waiter was splendid.  We felt like everyone wanted us to enjoy our meal, and they did everything they could to help us do so.  Servers kept the food coming, the silverware changing, all at a perfect leisurely-but-right-on-time pace.  I will love our waiter forever for keeping his eye on our sangria glasses and fishing the fruit out of the pitcher for us throughout the meal.  He even refilled the fruit when he noticed how fast we were nibbling through it.  He was supremely helpful but also easy-going and charming in a genuine way.Now that sangria - my oh my.  $30 bought us a sizable pitcher.  There was plenty of ice, but it was well over a liter.  It was fruity and wonderful, with blueberries, peach, and green apple chunks that soaked up the liquor to yield early dessert.The bread was decent, nothing special, but we hardly complained.  For our appetizers we split an almond vichyssoise and a beet salad.  The vichyssoise was gorgeous, green, and velvety with almond slices and lovely salty lumps of smoked trout to add texture and contast.  The beet salad came with arugula, pistachios, and strips of parmesan, all tossed in a light vinaigrette.  The appetizer portions were well-sized with the exception of the three or four paper-thin beet slices on the salad, and they disappeared quickly.For our entrees I ordered the pan-roasted salmon and my friend the olive oil poached cod.  We also got a side of the red hot rapini, which was good but less red hot than advertised.  Both fish were cooked beautifully, though I thought the salmon was the better entree.  I'm having trouble remembering the accompaniments.  The mains were definitely the saggiest portion of the meal, but no concrete complaints.The gluttony ended with a trifecta of tres leches cake, pistachio semifreddo, and peanut butter chocolate parfait.  The pistachio semifreddo was easily the best, robed in rich chocolate and sitting on a creme fraiche brownie.  The parfait was great, though I was hoping it would be a touch saltier.  The tres leches, while a good yellow cake, was disappointing.  I like my tres leches so soaked in milky decadence it can only be shoveled with a spoon, and this one came holding its form all pretty paired with a jewel-bright citrus salad.  Presentation was gorgeous, but it came at the expense of the dreamy levels tres leches can reach.Food-wise I'd rate the Red Cat a solid 4.5, and I was so charmed by the whole experience what with the service, the charming decor, the relaxing atmosphere and the good company, that I would be a real grouch to round down.  Pick a leisurely day and treat yourself - this place is the cat's meow.",4,2,3,Steph C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3889,3532,94

I split an order of the pancetta wrapped rabbit to start, and it was delicious. Even more so because I would never eat rabbit normally, i've only had it once when my dad told me it was chicken, I reailized right away it wasn't. Regardless, decided to go for it afterall and between the perfectly crisp pancetta, moist rabbit, and tasty little spaetzle the dish worked perfectly. I think i'm a rabbit fan now. Without going into details, both entrees were great too; shell steak and mahi mahi. The cucumber vingairgrette on the mahi mahi was particularly interesting and delicious. Also got an order of the chive mashed potatoes, also good. I think the only thing that faltered for me was the dessert, i think a rocky road something with walnut icecream. the icecream was good, but the rocky road thing was just a bit dry for me.

Can a place be rustic and trendy at the same time?  At The Red Cat I'd says so.  The Saturday night scene was buzzing, typical for  the 10th Avenue scene where big name chef's like Morimoto and Batali have set up shop too.   We had a drink at the bar while soaking up the atmosphere first and then were seated at a cozy table in the back.  Although many choices on the menu were tempting, I immediately settled on the skate, as I so often do when I dine out and it's an option.  My dinner date had the special, filet mignon with oysters, and we shared the potato peirogies with crab and honshimeji mushrooms. The peirogies were a nice start that definitely wet my appetite, and I had a couple of bites of the filet mignon which was tasty too.  But both my date and I agreed my skate was the handsdown winner. From the moment I took a bite of my crispy sauteed skatewing I was in food lovers heaven. Perfectly crisp on the outside while still fleshy and tender on the inside-it was well balanced by the citrus salad, hearts of palm, olives and grapefruit emulsion accompaniments. We finished with the rocky road sundae, carmel and fudge and pecans and butterscotch icecream - what's not to love?  So I definitely left content and will definitely return.  Though I'll have to force myself not to order the skate again and try something new.  Hopefully, I'll be able to convince my dining companion, to order it, so I can have at least a couple bites of that too.",1,0,1,Nadia S.,"Washington, DC",21,46,9

Megan was a little more adventurous and got the sweetbreads, which were a bit soggy (not that I'm a connoisseur). Next I moved onto the a class of the carneros Pinot and tuna which was well seared, not overcooked, but probably not the best choice for theplace that like makes wants you to think you're eating in a farm hose. Megan ordered the duck, but the winner at the table was Ricky. His skatewing with heart of palm and grapefruit emulsion was the only real standout. Althogh maybe that wasn't the point at this place.

4.0,12/21/2007,"I love the Red Cat.  It was the first restaurant my boyfriend and I ate at when we visited New York so I have very fond memories.  The scallops were soooooo delicious, I don't think I have ever had better scallops... perfection!  The tempura green beans were also good and fun to eat.  Our skatewing entree was yummy, but did not live up to the magic of the scallops.  The prices were very reasonable, which is saying a lot in NY.  My boyfriend had never been to NY and had heard horror stories about rude people, especially waiters, so he was really apprehensive about our first meal.  He was pleasantly shocked that our waitress was one of the friendliest and most helpful we have ever had.  I like the quaint, noisy, fast paced atmosphere... It felt very NYC to me.  I would definitely eat here again when I come back to the city.",1,0,0,Kelly H.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,87,4
3.0,12/18/2007,"Ambiance was good, altho loud.Service was impeccable.Food was only good.  Decent, as far as restaurants of this caliber go.We started w/ the quail and the beet tartar, and both were good (it's basically a beet and goat cheese salad).  I had the duck, which was definitely better than average, and my friend had the liver - which was delicious and didn't really taste like liver.  The polenta was good (not excellent) but the tempura green beans were DELICIOUS - definitely the best thing on the menu.I think it's a solid 3 stars - 4 if I lived in the neighborhood, but definitely not a destination.",2,0,2,Arielle W.,"New York, NY",24,212,0

It was VERY VERY oily. (2.5-3 stars at best.)Thankfully the Tempura green beans were a 4 out of 5 and the duck a 4.5! The dessert - a pear and cranberry crisp with buttermilk ice cream was yummy as was the lovely cup of coffee.The staff was nice too, although the waitress rushed us a little at the end (which I'm letting slide because it's the holidays and they overbooked the tables.)",1,0,1,Kimberli M.,"New York, NY",124,423,156
5.0,12/6/2007,"We arrived a little early for our dinner reservation on Sunday, and enjoyed a drink at the bar while we waited. The bartender was friendly, chatting with some folks that were eating at the bar. Her beer recommendation was great. Our table was ready right on time, and our waitress was also very friendly. We split the grilled endive gratin as an appetizer. Mmm, gorganzola and balsamic! I had the grilled pork chop and the mister had the crispy sauteed skatewing. Both were delicious and we pretty well cleaned our plates! Of course we tried the tempura beans--wow! Almost wish we'd skipped the appetizer and had two orders of those. For dessert it was fruit crisp with a really yummy buttermilk ice cream. The tables are very close together, and we were most entertained by the conversations going on around us! If we had been trying to have more of a conversation it might have been distracting though.Cheers to Melissa W. for her fantastic recommendations!",3,0,1,Kendra A.,"San Carlos, CA",12,54,13
2.0,11/30/2007,"I thought The Red Cat was just OK.  The interior is dimly lit with a rustic red and white interior that resembles the inside of a country home.  And the cuisine, American with a touch of French, while rich, is a touch flavorless.I came here with two friends last week for a quiet dinner.  In terms of ambiance, The Red Cat fit the bill.  Some of the dishes we tried were the foie gras and the pumpkin cornbread appetizers (both served as salads, which was a little unexpected), the organic chicken served with a risotto with pork belly bits, and the seared duck breast and a side of baked polenta.The foie gras was small and the pumpkin was so flavorless that you could mistake it with the accompanying parmesan.  Really.  You really couldn't taste the difference between the cornbread and croutons either.The polenta, on the other hand, was light and tasty.  And while I didn't think too much of the chicken, my girlfriend really enjoyed it.  I liked the flavor of the duck, but it's texture was a little dry and tasted closer to medium well than medium rare that our server recommended.We also had some desert; the pistachio semifreddo, the peach blackberry crisp, and the creme brulee.  The semifreddo was the clear choice of the three with it's impressive presentation, drizzled with chocolate syrup at our table, and it's light and delicate taste.  The creme brulee was quite large, served in what could have been a soap dish, and the crisp, while topped with a unique buttermilk ice cream, turned out to be a disappointment.In all, dinner for three came out to about $200 bucks without drinks.  Was it worth it?  While the girlfriend enjoyed it, for me, the Red Cat is a restaurant I wouldn't recommend.",6,0,1,Tony L.,"San Francisco, CA",731,1265,21
4.0,9/23/2007,"Follow the radishes.The interior was interesting with Moroccan style chandeliers toting real candles.  Some art was displayed and the restaurant, altho a bit crowded was intimate still.  I typically will judge a restaurant by many factors, one being the convos being held and how comfortable patrons are.  I like a loudish restaurant, not sure why but I do.  We requested a different seat and we got it.  Simple and quick.The music was a tad ADD.  All good tho.  The cocktail menu was just eh and couldn't hold a candle to the elaborate wine and beer menu.Pork Chops were very tender with a side of grilled salad, love this new trend in grilling salads.  The steak was delicious and the side it came with even better with potatoes, tomatoes, parm cheese, leeks and a cream sauce, all sautee'd and then baked.  The polenta was just outstanding and was steaming.  This place with the atmosphere, the music and the polenta brought me back to many years riding in the shopping cart with my mom, with paul simon overhead and eating polenta (pastina with cheese really but who's counting).    Yeah Red Cat.",1,0,0,Dale D.,"Bergen County, NJ",62,173,2

3.0,8/26/2007,"I found this restaurant to be very appealing in terms of decor and service was great. However, the food was a little less exciting. Our rum drink with grapefruit was tasty and refreshing. The zucchini appetizer was really good, but the tomatoes with chevre were bland and boring. The entrees we had were the bass special and the chicken dish. They were just very boring. And for the price, it seems like we should be more impressed with the main course. I think because of this I would not go back here.",1,0,0,Lisa H.,"Annapolis, MD",5,22,0
3.0,5/17/2007,"Great beer selection (McChouffe is hard to find in restaurants) and small creative cocktail menu (Ginger and bourbon cocktails are always good).Food, however, was so so.Had the zucchini with pecorino. The squash was shredded and rather raw which made it difficult to eat. Too much oil, not enough salt (other than the cheese). Pecorino is a great salt substitute, but hard to put on warm dishes. It sweats and turns waxey which doesn't do much good.I went with the prune stuffed quail appetizer as a main. The quail was cooked perfectly, although, they deboned it which drives me nuts. The dark meet on quail is one of the best parts and it's the closest meat to the bone which is usually ejected with the bones mistakedly.  It was paired nicely with a celery root (and apple salad)...althought could've used a bit more apple and maybe a tough of citrus, it had a nice light creamy dressing.No dessert!

3.0,3/21/2007,"Red Cat was - eh.  I just got a super weird vibe.  I believe our waitress was nice.  Just the hostesses were freakishly unfriendly for a nice-ish restaurant.  It reminded me of being in Memphis.  Weird town.  I recall walking in there and feeling very uncomfortable and I wasn't at all sure why.  The departure was somewhat similar when they were returning our coats to us.  Granted, my date was just getting into town and hadn't had a chance to drop off his luggage before going on our studio tour....but is that really strange??The food was good.  I had beet tartar, I LOVE beets!  The main dishes were very basic though and they were certainly good but not that interesting.  I ordered the petit four dessert sampler thing and that was both delicious and a really great deal as far as desserts go. So yeah, I'm a bit unorganized here - no solid complaints but I wouldn't suggest going out of your way to eat here.",3,0,2,Jen P.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,46,0

It epitomizes the atmosphere I love most: very homey and cozy, but light at the same time; casual and neighborly with a refined appeal to it; busy but not loud; very friendly staff. But the food is what really matters most here. Everything we had (three of us) was delectable--down to the Manhattan ordered by a very discerning Manhattan-drinker. We had the tartar and fried oysters to start--both amazing. Do not miss the tempura green beans.  Unique and delicious.  I want to live here.",3,1,1,Michael H.,"Austin, TX",72,235,3

4.0,7/16/2006,"For a great date...In retrospect, I now realize that I should have made reservations - especially on a Thursday following the gallery openings.  Fortunately, the good people at the Red Cat took care of us - and gave us the best table in the house (maybe my date and I had good smiles?).Our food was wonderful and served with quiet, polite efficiency.  Prior to dinner, we were invited to sample fresh bottles of wine even though we were ordering by the glass.  Dinner itself was very good with mid sized portions.  The decor was understated but nevertheless classy - as was the clientele.  This is a great place to finish off your gallery expedition, or as it was in my case, a launching pad for further adventures...A great date spot - highly recommended.  Only complaints are slightly high prices (I've seen much worse, however) and I'd prefer a bit more striking architecture.  But that's just because I'm really hard to get five stars out of...",3,0,0,John S.,"New York, NY",1,16,0
4.0,6/4/2006,"Clean, reliable, new American restaurant, The Red Cat is a good choice for a meal in the Chelsea area after gallery hopping or before hitting the clubbing scene at night. While the food is not cheap, it is not ridiculously expensive either. The appetizers here won't steer you wrong, particularly the cod cake with garlic yogurt sauce and cucumbers and the lamb with spaetzle. While not everything was amazing (the chicken liver, for instance, was nothing special) - there are several standouts including the flavorful but light Brook Trout served with green beans and cremini mushrooms, as well as the muscovy duck with stewed grapes. For dessert, try the warm banana walnut cake served with banana ice cream if you like bananas. An added bonus: the service is gracious and accomodating.",2,1,1,Chris L.,"New York, NY",95,276,9

The olive oil they serve to dip bread in is amazing. The entrees were tasty. Dessert looked tempting but we were stuffed. Second visit: First night back in NYC and I wanted to treat my friend to dinner since he brought me with him on his trip. So I went back to this favorite of mine.

5.0,4/13/2006,"The sauted potato pierogies with mushrooms, lobster wine and butter goes on my list of top five best dishes tasted in 2005. Yes! It's that exciting. Let's see, I love potatoes, I like pierogies, mushrooms and lobster, oh, and wine and butter too --- it's got all the ingredients to make it a winner. The execution makes it spectacular! The skins of the pierogies are more like pancake-like blinis than dumpling-like dough, when sauted in butter, it just tastes like heaven. Of course, if you put it in a sauce that is basically a lobster bisque, the combination is just fantastic.The Red Cat hardly needs an introduction. The first of Jimmy Bradley and Danny Abram's restaurants, The Red Cat opened in 1999 and has consistently maintained its high quality and standards and set the bar for all its subsequent sister restaurants, The Harrison and Mermaid Inn (Pace just recently closed). What has struck me most about their restaurants is the service. The staff are always very friendly and not in that superficial, ""hi my name is ..."" who cares kind of way. Rather, they make you feel at home and are attentive but not intrusive. In this city, of all places, it's hard to come by this kind of service without getting some attitude but that's probably why The Red Cat has such a loyal following. Not to mention, The Red Cat has one of the nicest bars at which to dine. I love eating at the bar, and they have a large bar area that is well suited for dining. Fellow diners tend to be Red Cat loyalists and food lovers, which always makes it fun.Congratulations, The Red Cat, on receiving your second star from The New York Times in the summer of 2005.
