5.0,4/26/2019,"Came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday, and I booked through OpenTable and left a request on there to ask the restaurant to write ""Happy Birthday"" on the dessert plate. Ai Fiori called me the day before the reservation to confirm the table, and I completely forgot to check whether they got my request. But they did remember without me mentioning at the restaurant, it was an excellent touch! Food wise, it was very delicious. I got the Foie Gras, Fusilli and Cioccolato and loved every single course so much! Everything was perfect!! The sides were a pleasant surprise too! The Potato Fritters were sooo good they melt in your mouth, it's to die for!!",0,0,0,Chloe K.,"New York, NY",109,5,23
5.0,4/19/2019,"Ai Fiori provides one of the best dining experiences you are likely to have in New York, if your ideal is truly great food, served to you by incredibly nice, knowledgeable, unpretentious people, in lovely, unhurried surroundings. You come into the restaurant up a sort of ""grand staircase"" in the front of the Langham Hotel on Fifth Avenue, so the whole thing feels elegant, but somehow not intimidatingly elegant. You are greeted by some lovely people who welcome you effusively like you are an old friend, and who are dying to know if it's your first time dining with them or what, so they can orient you appropriately.You get taken to your table instantly. The restaurant is enormous with big windows looking out at Fifth Avenue and lots of space between the tables. It really feels like a space from a bygone era in terms of the proportions. Also, the quiet. There is no pounding soundtrack of pop music in the background or loud ambient noise. You can hear your dinner companions speaking, a bit of restaurant hum in the background. It's just perfect.Servers are adorable, knowledgeable and attentive but not too attentive. No one who works there seems to be just marking time while waiting to find out if their pilot is getting picked up, the way it feels in a lot of other Manhattan restaurants. Everyone seems happy to be there and engaged with what they are doing.The food is divine. We got the four course prix fixe which really should be a good value. The only problem with it is the difficulty of actually getting through a fourth course.For appetizers, we had the Insalata di Astice, a yummy lobster salad thing with various mysterious garnishes; and the Torchon, which involved a big chunk of foie gras, some homemade brioche toast and little spoonfuls of pear and quince sauces. Painfully good. Impossible to finish if you are planning to get through the rest of the meal.Next pasta, thankfully in relatively small portions. We had the spaghetti with blue crab, lemon and chilis and the Fusilli all Convivio with a pork shoulder ragu. Both again incredibly good with hard-to-pin-down flavors that you had to just experience the way you do wine in a wine tasting, letting the flavors develop in your mouth before, during and after each bite.Entrees: The Ippoglosso, which was a butter-poached halibut thing; and the veal chop, which was immense and resulted in left-overs to be brought home.We fell short as customers in two areas. One was drinking. Ai Fiori has a great wine list, but my partner is not a big drinker and I am kind of a lightweight, so we are not able to weigh in on the fabulous vintages. I did have a perfectly lovely Kir to start. Then I wanted a glass of white wine during dinner, and am not very knowledgeable about Italian wines. The sommelier came to our table, did not treat my question as the most trivial of his evening, even though I'm sure it was, and just said ""I'll bring you something to try."" He did, and it was wonderful. I drank it. Whatever it was. If you know your wines, great. If not, you could not go wrong by letting him pick them.The second was dessert. We were literally unable to put away two desserts, or even to freely sample one. We were not even going to get one, but one of our waiters suggested what he said was a very light dessert -- it was described as a basil creme on some sort of cookie, blah blah (it can be hard to follow the descriptions of the food). Anyway, it had a sort of light, slightly tart cheesecake vibe, with some scoops of yummy, indefinably flavored sorbets. Also, because it was my birthday, there was a chocolate ""card"" with ""Happy Birthday"" hand-lettered onto it. And a birthday candle. So adorable. But nobody sang. Thank you! All throughout, the meal was incredibly relaxed and unhurried. At no point did you feel like anyone wished you would hurry up and leave so they could turn your table over. It was just perfect. When the bill comes, you do not have a heart attack. The value you get at this place is great, and worth every dime.Ai Fiori just gets everything right.

2.0,3/17/2019,"In a word - disappointing. After all the hype I heard at last year's New York Wine Experience about this restaurant and the great experiences I've had at the Langham Hotel restaurant in London (Roux), my expectations were fairly high. From start to finish, the service was truly bad and impersonal. I think the whole restaurant could take a lesson or two in communication. We decided on the seven course chef's tasting menu and what was promised to be a sommelier ""reserve"" pairing, featuring ""highly allocated"" wines that were ""not available"" on the by the glass list. Then as the first wine was poured, we got told the entire menu and wine pairing was going to be from Tuscany... information that would have been good to know before we decided to do the pairing. Of the 7 wines, only two were red - a 2013 Brunello and 2015 Super Tuscan, neither from particularly famed producers. And the servings were tiny - less than half a glass, maybe 3 oz? For $195 a person, I would expect a much higher quality wine pairing - maybe something with some age on it? Particularly when we are talking Tuscany... I could have done a lot more with $400 on their wine list.There seemed to be an endless number of people working the floor, yet I still could not tell you who our waiter was? Each time a dish was served, the presentation was slightly/ incredibly different between my daughter and I. Some of the dishes were garnished completely differently. Each dish was placed down without any care for etiquette or a coherent description of what was on the plate in front of us (""Squab"")... usually very integral when you are doing a blind tasting menu and don't know what's coming. Also timing was all over the place - some dishes were rushed, others had long gaps. An overall lack of consistency. When asked about how we enjoyed the cheese dish, I honestly answered that it didn't taste like anything (was a neutral cool whip type dish with zested lemon, whole thyme sprigs, and olive oil). 10 minutes later, a new cheese dish came ""with compliments""... okay sure that was nice, but no one talked to us about this/ if we wanted another dish (we were just ready to leave).I'm rating two stars instead of one because the food wasn't inedible or even bad, just underwhelming considering the caliber of the restaurant. One highlight would be the squid ink pasta with octopus, but not amazing enough to carry the rest of the meal. When you have a Michelin star and are offering a tasting menu, one expects a meal that justifies the price tag.I got a question from the manager (I think) on my way to the bathroom and answered honestly. He offered more food... (truly the last thing I needed/ wanted). He ultimately took off one of the wine pairings, which I did not ask for. It was a nice gesture but really isn't enough to get me or my daughter to ever come back. So many other Michelin choices in New York that you won't regret spending $$$$ on.",0,0,0,Angela S.,"Energy Corridor, Houston, TX",0,1,0
5.0,3/17/2019,"Definitely one of my best dining experience. I came here the celebrate anniversary with my husband. The food, especially the lobster is awesome.

4.0,3/13/2019,"Stopped in here at the bar again,and the waiter was fairly new, so his description of dishes included ""it has beef"" for the hamburger was... not helpful. Some items at the bar are unique to that area, and you can still order a la carte from the main menu.No oysters this time, but we tried the amuse bouche, which was a little wafer, olive creme with a few slices of grape. Interesting, but not that tasty.The fluke crudo w/ the American caviar over olive oil, though, was fantastic. Combined with the bread basket they offered (olive, rosemary, and white), it was fantastic dipping the extra olive oil, too.The blue crab spaghetti pasta - al dente perfectly, a little spicy, and delicious (they split it in two for us to share).The white label burger was also fantastic, done medium, a la frieda prime patty, calabrian aioli, fontina chees,e pickles, and pommes dauphines to the side. The burger was juicy and very tasty. The pommes dauphines were a disappointment - would have been better with some texture like tater tots instead.The dessert menu was disinteresting to my dining partners, but we ended up trying the cioccolato, a chocolate mousse, honey bourbon crema, and honey gelato. The best part was the gelato, the rest didn't pop in my memory or taste buds at all.Overall, service was only so-so this time but the fluke, burger, and blue crab spaghetti pasta were excellent, bumping this up in my book (for the food).",5,2,4,Hank C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1732,2830,1188
2.0,3/13/2019,"Honestly... with all the Michelin star restaurants I've eaten at I would not recommend going to Ai Fiori. Came here without reservation as I was staying in the hotel and feeling a bit lazy to head out in the cold to meet friends after a full day of running around. The concierge had mentioned it wouldn't be hard to get a reservation for one, and I had been excited to try it. When I arrived the hostess promptly greeted me and upon noting that I had no res, suggested 8:15 and that I could wait at the bar. Me: ""Oh I'm just upstairs.""Her: ""That doesn't mean you get priority.""Me: ""No, I meant I'm just going to wait upstairs instead of the bar and was just going to comment on how convenient​ that is.""WOW. First interaction, super rude. Lady, I wasn't even going there but thanks for being a jerk about nothing. Ok,​ I'm going to get over this because I had been planning to check this place out for a month now during this trip to NYC and I didn't want this one person to ruin the hopes and expectations of dining here. Upon arriving back at 8:15, my table isn't ready. The hostess now feigns interest in me​ but ignores me as she anxiously tries to find coats for other guests she deems to be more important. I'm guessing these are the people leaving good reviews. 10 mins more of standing at the front desk, and wow I'm getting more annoyed. Finally,​ I'm seated and get the wine and menu. I decide to go with a pricier wine but just the smaller pour since I'm a lightweight. The waiter attending my table comes back to confirm, ""You know this is a taste right? Not a glass."" ""Yes, I know."" Wow. The punches keep coming from​ Ai Fiori. So far I haven't even gotten a drink yet, but plenty of judgment​ about my character. Once I've ordered my four-course​ pre-fix dinner + Brussel​ sprouts (because I love well done Brussel sprouts) I get a reprieve​ from the all-around​ saint that serves the bread. He explains what types he has and offers me both of the ones I'm interested in. At this point minus my bread saint, I just want to avoid talking to any more staff before I get my food. I ordered:Vellutata - lobster soup, périgord black truffles, tarragon. There's a certain way to eat this that makes it tasty, you have to get all ingredients in a soup spoon to a certain proportion. Otherwise,​ the soup part is more sour and overpowering, the lobster's sweetness really balances the sourness out. Spaghetti - blue crab, lemon, bottarga, chilies. This was ok. I know other people raved about it, but the noodles were ok, and it had green onions (maybe this was the chilies) on top that made it taste pretty pedestrian. Capriolo - pan-roasted venison chop, sweet potato, chestnut, parsnip, golden oak mushrooms. This was not bad. The venison was well cooked and flavored, and paired nicely with the vegetables. Cavoletti - roasted brussels sprouts, pancetta, honey vinaigrette. Now. Can I just say the Brussel sprouts were my favorite part of the meal? It'd be hard to have these ingredients​ go awry, but they were spot on here.Tartaletta - pineapple jam, cream cheese sabayon, meyer lemon, pineapple sorbetto. I finished with the Tartaletta. Yum. Probably my second favorite part of the meal. Overall. Meh. Could do better. Next time I won't be lazy and just go to the restaurant in the hotel, and my NYC local friend had warned me about doing this. Don't get me wrong, I still tipped 18%. Even though I believed that my primary facilitators of the night did me wrong in coloring the experience a certain way, I don't think that everyone that helped prepare my food or keep the restaurant running did anything to deserve less.",2,3,2,Jessica C.,"Cupertino, CA",698,804,333

4.0,3/3/2019,"Overall a good balance of fame, price, service, food, ambiance, and more. Very rounded experience with more ups than downs, definitely worth a try.Needless to say, a reservation will be highly recommended. The location is on the second floor of the hotel with a lounge on one side and the main dining area on the other. Going deep into the seven-course chef's seasonal tasting menu will not be necessary, as the menu may have been changed by the time you read this review. However, some high-level comments will be made.Today's menu revolves around the theme ""Citrus"".Yea: Scallops (starter), cod (main), grapefruit granite (dessert)Yes, in a seven-course menu, there will be up and downs and this one is not an exception. Absolutely loved the scallops. Fresh with the citrus dressing, a very refreshing start to a long journey. The cod was the other fresh seafood I liked. I was tender and went extremely well with the farro and artichokes on the side. Our absolute favorite was the desert, the grapefruit granite. After two hours, we came back to the same place: crystal light, crunchy and fruity dessert. Something very unique (even when it's a little bitter, though not too sweet).Nay: Skirt Steak and shrimp scampiThe shrimp scampi had absolutely no taste to it (asked for cheese and it was much better). The shrimps and pasta had no taste to it and it was quite disappointing to have such comment on an easy fix. Skirt steak: simply too dry. Not enough fat in the mix made it uneasy to bite.Don't forget about the drinks. We did not get any alcoholic drink but asked for a fruity/sparkling drink that went really well with the menu, well priced too.The value was great. The seven-course menu offers a price in the middle of its competition.

3.0,2/23/2019,"Have you ever felt sheepish and worried about being the only one in the room not to fully ""get it""? Ever been at a ""comedy"" show and wondered why everybody else is ""rolling in the aisles with laughter"" and you're not? Or hear the buzz about a best-selling book, read it, then wonder why this cliche-ridden dud is receiving such widespread praise? I feel that way often with Michelin star restaurants. And while it wasn't hat extreme at Ai Fiori, I definitely had a ""what's the fuss?"" experience throughout, I'm sorry to say. Read on.Ai Fiori gives you three options: go for a 4- or 7-course tasting menu or pick stuff yourself. We elected to do the latter and went with 3 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 3 desserts. If you're the type who eats ""a salad"" for a meal, this isn't the Yelp account for you.Of the three appetizers, the pork belly was transcendent, the lobster salad merely good, and the foie gras indistinguishable from liver pate you'd buy at Whole Foods. P2P (Price to Portions) ratio is pretty bad on the lobster and foie gras but surprisingly decent on the pork belly, which as I said, was not excellent but TRANSCENDENT.Moving on, we had the veal and the dry-aged beef for entrees. Both were pretty incredible, with superb P2P for veal and bad P2P for the beef. The cheese potatoes that come with the dry-aged beef are incredible. We also did the mushrooms as a side dish, and they were solid.Last, the dessert. Once again, like the appetizers, rather uneven: chocolate frutti rossi pretty bland, the tartaletta amazing, and the affogato good theater but nothing you can't do yourself (it's a scoop of vanilla gelatto with alcohol and espresso that you get to pour on top of it; watch out if you're a teetotaler like me because your head could get warm!)Look, it was a good meal, but with the P2P and the Michelin hype, I'd hope for more across-the-board flawlessness like the sort at Atera (here) or Spago (LA). The logistics are also a bit off: long period of waiting for your bill, etc., and a bit too much of the premature plate grab. CRITICAL NOTE: I am NOT blaming the individual staff itself. Rather, as is always the case, I go for the good ol' Sociology 101 approach and adopt a STRUCTURAL analysis. There should be a better-tested protocol for timing stuff like bill delivery and no need to swap out plates unless they're a) empty or b) lack of table space requires it.It's a 3.",1,0,1,Merlin C.,"Manhattan, NY",274,608,74

1.0,2/18/2019,"This review is based off my restaurant week lunch experience. I arrived at 12pm and they seated us in the area for people who don't have reservations. The ambiance was beautiful. We opted for 2-course.- Terrina di anatra (Duck pate): This was more like cold shredded mushed duck meat. I wasn't sure if there was even liver. It was also flavorless. The stale bread and mustard didn't help. I could barely eat it.  - Zuppa di topinambur (Soup): Bland. It tasted like luke warm heavy cream. - Costolette (Short rib): The portion for was a joke. You get a cubic inch of short rib but half was pure fat. The polenta tasted like straight stick of butter and the root vegetables weren't memorable. - Truffle risotto: If I'm going to pay extra I would expect it to be worth it. When it came it smell like cheap mac n cheese which was shocking. Other than the truffle shavings on top there was NO truffle in the risotto. It tasted like white cheddar cheese. Yuck!For a Michelin star rated restaurant I had HIGH expectations. To start off, the service was terrible. I couldn't get a waiter to refill water or clear my table.

4.0,1/31/2019,"Thanks to NYC restaurant week I got to enjoy a Michelin star restaurant for my mom's birthday. I was allowed to call for reservations 2 weeks in advance for lunch on a Thursday & they were absolutely pleasant on the phone. They even asked for my party's allergies & inquired if I was celebrating anything. So very thoughtful, remembering this is service for an excellent restaurant. It's located on the 2nd floor of a luxurious hotel. Beautiful walk up the curved staircase to the entrance. We were offered coat check but we were able to keep our coats. The table setting was lovely. For restaurant week, they offer the 2 course for $26 or the 3 course for $32. We of course got the 3 course! For starters, the zuppa di topinambur (sunchoke soup, pickled celery root & creme fraiche) looked plain & simple with few textured ingredients but it was very soft, light & creamy. My mother loved it. I ordered the terrina di anatra (duck pate, cranberry, pickles, pecan) which I thought was going to be a paste, however it wasn't. The plate looked beautiful, the duck was cooked well, not overcooked & each bite with the cranberry was the best. Entrees: My aunt got the salmon (pan roasted with butternut squash, quinoa & swiss chard) which was also presented lovely. The salmon was cooked well & she said she loved pairing the butternut squash the best. Mother & I ordered the costolette (red wine braised ribs, polenta & glazed root vegetables). The plate is served with one rib. My mother's dish had more polenta than I did, but I wasn't going to be upset about that. I was a tad bit disappointed in my rib piece which was meaty on one side & on the flat side had a tough fatty tissue that was inedible. The meaty part had gelatin- looking lines in it. I wondered if that's what you call ""marbling"" but it wasn't as tender & juicy as I would imagine it would be.Dessert: the limone curd with meringue & grapefruit granite was amazing. It's a small portion, but I loved it regardless. I feel that it was better than semifreddo (chocolate mousse, cardamom & salted caramel ganache). The most thoughtful thing they did was surprised my mother with an extra birthday ice cream dessert. I was so pleased with their kindess & making her feel special.

Sunchoke soup was rich, creamy, and delicious though. Salmon was over cooked as was the quinoa base.

4.0,1/24/2019,"I went here on a lunch date and though the date was subpar, the food wasn't :). Everything was stellar with one exception, but I'll get to that later. For a 2 course at $49 it isn't cheap but it wouldn't break the bank either. We both opted for the 2 course and got dessert versus the 3 course and it was definitely an adequate amount of food. However, if you're pretty hungry I would do the 3 course. Anyways, the food!To start- I ordered the Vellutata, otherwise known as lobster bisque lol. Although I wish there was a bit more lobster, the base was so creamy and if you dip the bread they give in it, it's pretty great. I forgot the name of the other dish but I did post a picture for reference. It consisted of pasta that was al dente (which made it way better IMHO) in a buttery sauce with mushrooms. You can't go wrong with either.Mains- I ordered the Trofie Nero and he ordered the Capesante. Here is where I had to knock off a star for Ai Fiori. The scallops in the Capesante were salty. And yes, I know that's normal for scallops, but I'm talking unbearably salty to the point that you don't want to be rude and let the waiter know but you also kind of feel obliged to let them know. Needless to say, he did let them know (I am not that brave) and our server apologized and gave us an extra dessert which was very sweet (pun intended). The Trofie Nero, however, was perfect. The chunks of scallop in it were great and the ""crustacean ragu"" (or what I like to call breadcrumbs) made it all the better. Desserts- yes yes and yes. Both the one we ordered and the complimentary one were absolutely amazing. The one we ordered was the Paris-Brest. That hazelnut cream, oof. Literally could eat this every day with zero regrets. The complimentary one was the tartaletta which was different from the Paris-Brest as it was very fruity but still very good. It was a nice balance and you can't go wrong with either, so get both :). All in all, Ai Fiori is a great place to dine but definitely ask the waiter/waitress what his or her personal favorites are or whatnot to get a better understanding of what you want.",10,3,9,Najwa G.,"Queens, Queens, NY",82,173,361
4.0,1/22/2019,"Came here yesterday for restaurant week and was satisfied with this Michelin star restaurant. The atmosphere is definitely very elegant and fancy. The food didn't really match my palate as I like stronger flavors and seasoning in my food, but my mother loved it. We both thought the braised short rib was excellent. I would've liked more flavor or sauce with it, but I can tell they made the short rib pretty well. Their duck tartare appetizer was good too - pretty interesting. I'm used to the smooth texture in pate where you spread it on bread, but this was a block of chunks of duck meat which was good too. It was on the more bland side too with a hint of sweetness. The tartellini pasta wasn't anything too impressive. Their small desserts at the end were tasty too. To be honest, I'd give the food here 3 stars. Only gave it 4 because of the price deal for restaurant week. Otherwise, I don't think I would come here for a normal meal due to price and the taste of the food.",2,1,1,Diana P.,"Queens, NY",393,340,1188
4.0,1/21/2019,"Nestled in a series of dining rooms above the Langham's lobby, Ai Fiori is a solid option for fine dining without overbearing formality. Chef Michael White (also of Marea and Vaucluse) devised a menu that eschews fussy gimmicks in favor of dependable, seasonal Italian dishes. Make no mistake, though, the flavor combinations are all interesting and well composed, and the kitchen generally executes well. Wine is absolutely a main event at Ai Fiori, which boasts an incredible wine list. Their selection is amazing, not only in quality but in breadth. If you appreciate wine, that really is reason enough to visit. Service was attentive and on point, if lacking a bit of personality. Overall, Ai Fiori's Michelin star and Grand Award from Wine Spectator are well deserved - we had an excellent experience. Atmosphere- Nice design - an updated take on fine dining; decidedly upscale but not sedate.- Retains a sense of conviviality and was well attended on a Friday night.- Dining room is separated into several distinct 'niches' by the buildings columns. Helps keep things cozy.- Dress on the nicer side, generally smart casual and above.- Nice bar area at the entrance with plenty of seating.FoodOverall, we found the quality of food to be high, as expected at this caliber. We went with the prix fixe ($108) which includes one antipasti, pasta, meat and dessert; a la carte is available as well. The pastas, in particular, were a high point. Proteins were generously proportioned and flavorful, but could use some buttoning up in terms of execution. Pastry was also another strong point, with flavorful desserts in perfect proportions. We enjoyed:Antipasti- Torchon (foie gras, apple mostarda, fig purée, oat crumble, calvados - pf supp $6): Balanced accompaniments and nicely presented, though not remarkable.- Pancetta di Maiale (braised pork belly, swiss chard, apple, pork sugo): Excellent caramelization, well rendered fat and perfect fall/winter flavors. Quite nice.Pasta- Fusilli (alla convivio, pork shoulder ragu, pomodoro, robiolina): Rich, developed ragu; perfectly seasoned and cooked pasta. Highly recommend!- Cappelletti (milk-braised veal parcels, butternut squash pumpkin seeds, pancetta, pearl onions): Delicate pasta with warm, nuanced flavors. Highly recommend!Carne- Anatra (long island duck breast, beets, radicchio, pistachio): Great presentation. Pistachio crust adds welcome texture; sauce provided balance. While the flavors were spot on, really wish the fat was rendered further and skin crisped.- Vitello (french milk-fed veal chop, broccoli rabe, kohlrabi, gremolata - pf supp $10): Substantial portion! Nicely seasoned with perfect color on the exterior, a touch dry inside but the jus aided. Again, great flavor - quite enjoyable.Dessert- Tartaletta (pineapple jam, cream cheese sabayon, meyer lemon, pineapple sorbetto): Lighter option with cleansing pineapple and citrus, kept interesting with texture. Love it!- Torta di Noci (spiced walnut cake, apple confit, cinnamon, mulled cider sorbetto): Bolder fall flavors, but appropriately portioned - another winner.BeverageBegan with a cocktail - the Royal Blush (stolichnaya vodka, mint, lime, morello cherry, sparkling wine - $19), which was a touch sweet but nonetheless enjoyable. Quite a few interesting options, especially with darker spirits.Wine list is very impressive, especially considering it has a breadth atypical for an Italian restaurant (very extensive French and quality American selections). On average, bottles are $150+. We really enjoyed the 2001 Eredi Fuligni Brunello di Montalcino ($285) with our meal, an extremely solid wine from a benchmark vintage. There is also a substantial wines by the glass list, two pages long with one entire page dedicated to premium pours delivered via Coravin. All around, a top notch wine program no matter how you go.Service- Professional and attentive; executed service with precision, if only lacking personality.- Somm was knowledgeable above and beyond, even for this caliber of venue.",0,0,0,D.

The formalities of the Restaurant are overlooked because the service is extremely hospitable to all its patrons. Ive never felt underdressed, no uncomfortable at any time Ive visited Ai Fiori and its all due to the staffs ability to provide hospitality. The cocktails provided by the bar, time and visits again and again have been nothing short of superb and its undoubtedly a representation of the beverage directors ability to create a superb and duplicatable drink.I would come here just for the bar but the reality the bar alone doesn't do Ai Fiori enough justice because the food is just as captivating as the drinks.

Case in point: the two photos I found residing on my phone were of foie gras and truffles.Anyhow, the restaurant is spectacularly pretty, the type of place where you'd sit and stare at the lighting fixtures and ceiling treatments if there weren't so many impeccably dressed diners to people-watch.The menu is replete with your typical cross-functional Italian fare, with the fancy comma'ed descriptions to distract you from the numbers behind the corresponding dollar sign.

It's a classy place.I did the seven-course tasting menu on a Saturday night. We arrived at 840pm, seated at about 850pm, and then ordered at 9pm. The amuse bouche arrived at about 915pm. Where am I going with this? We left the place at 1245am. For a seven-course meal WITHOUT drinks or a la cart extras, this felt excessively long. In fact, a couple of times, we felt abandoned. At one point, we had to explicitly ask for more water. And as the night got later and fellow patrons left, the service got worse.The food was definitely good, but nothing I'd nominate for a Michelin star (yes, I know they have one). Some of the dishes were excellent, but others left more to be desired. Coupled with the extra sloooooooow service, this experience was mediocre. The service is part of the price, after all.

3.0,11/28/2018,"Nothing amazing, nothing terrible. I guess my expectation was high given it's a Michael White restaurant and Marea is one of my favorites in the city. This place feels like a knock off of Marea, with clumsier services and worse food. Let's talk about service first. It's spotty. Several times people at our table had water glasses and wine glasses empty and nobody would notice. Additionally, twice some waiter dropped or slipped and broke a glass and a vase on the floor. Both times happened close to us and the noise was startling. Definitely not something I'd expect from a place like this. When it comes to food, we were a party of 7 and ordered quite a few dishes, so I don't think  Everything was either good or ok, but there's no stand outs, no amazing-ness. The main dish that I ordered was Spaghetti with blue crab and lemon, in my opinion it was a failure. The dish came out wayyy too heavy, completely masked the freshness and slight sweet taste of blue crab taste. Not to mention I kept getting crab shells in my bites. So try here if you want, but I'd strongly recommend you also try Marea after this. :)",3,1,1,Lu H.,"New York, NY",294,570,1967

We also had the lobster soup which was really rich - the black truffle was subtle.For pastas, we really enjoyed the spaghetti.

4.0,11/7/2018,"Ai Fiori is that reliable upscale restaurant to keep in your back pocket. It's not too difficult to snag a table, the ambiance is a little business mixed with cushy seating and seasonal florals, and you know you'll be having some very good pasta. Their burger is a must-try if you're going for lunch. For dinner, the 4-course prix fixe is the way to go. My favorite has always been the Trofie Nero (squid ink pasta) with bits of seafood in a luxurious tomato sauce, topped with buttery crunchy breadcrumbs. The seafood is not the star here, but rather the supporting role to highlight each perfect curly pasta noodle. I'm always happy to eat a bowl of this! The spaghetti with blue crab is also another classic dish here, with a creamier tomato sauce and a kick of spice. Cioccolato is so so good for a chocolate-lover and the perfect sweet ending. The rest of the menu can vary seasonally, but I remember the butternut squash soup was one of the best (I was surprised how velvety and good a soup could be!), and lobster is always perfectly prepared. My main last night was Capesante (scallops) which I love anyway, but this was topped with trout roe - one of the most exciting ways I've eaten scallops! The little briny roe popped as you bit into the sweet soft scallops - genius. The Vitello (veal chop) is definitely on the fatty side (as our waitress had warned us). The pork chop was even better when I tried it last summer. I wasn't blown away by the Torta di Noci tbh, which was a fluffy spiced loaf (boring) with a very strong ginger foam.Our waitress was fantastic and very sweet! Her recommendations were on point, she was very knowledgeable about every dish, and she was genuinely nice. The somm recommended a delicious Napa Valley Cabernet for a great price point ($130).

This time I was directed to order the mozzarella ""salad"". It is fresh but salty and might be good for a table for 4 but as an individual do not order as an appetizer. It is just a blob of salty fresh cheese. There is no tomato or anything to offset except more salt on toasts. The steak tartar....it may be good but the meat is totally overpowered by the raw chicken egg. I love the egg in tartar but in Ai Fiore's bar version, there is a tiny amount of meat completely smothered and overpowered by a hen's egg. It would have been beautiful with either a quails egg or more meat with the hens egg. Very very disappointing. To be fair they did not charge me for the food.

The olive bread there was also really good. The vibe of the place is super nice and the service is exemplary. The atmosphere is warm and upscale. Even though my girlfriend and I stumbled in and were definitely not dressed for the occasion we were not treated any differently.

3.0,9/25/2018,"Ai Fiori aims to transplant Marea's luxurious, seafood-focused Italian cooking from Columbus Circle to a sleek Midtown hotel, but I don't know that Michael White's vision quite made the move with the pedigree. Marea is one of my all-time favorite restaurants, so going for its more conveniently located sister restaurant seemed like a no-brainer for my birthday, but the experience was mixed.Accessed by a curving staircase from the hotel lobby, the space is dark and elegant, with large round tables and a business-dinner atmosphere. It's a bit more sedate and corporate than Marea, and lacked that buzz of conversation despite it being a Saturday night, but it's nicely decorated with enormous vases of flowers.From the antipasti, crispy soft shell crab ($24) was jumbled together with a smear of green sauce and an assortment of vegetables, but delivered well on texture and flavor. Fluke crudo with lemon and caviar ($32) was piled high with the latter, yet somehow tasted of nothing. Rest unmemorable.Similar situation on the pastas ($37 each), a recycled greatest hits from Marea. My beloved blue crab and lemon spaghetti lacked zing. The rest of the table was satisfied, especially on the seafood-laden trofie nero, save for the special truffle pasta. They shaved them at the table and it was a generous amount, but it wasn't fragrant or flavorful. My family is no stranger to truffles and everyone agreed that the characteristic taste wasn't there.Finally, desserts were strong, including delicious gelato and a complimentary little sweet with a birthday candle. Cocktails are powerful and well made. I can't judge their wine list as we BYOBed for a fee, but their presentation is done well. Coffee service very good.Pacing exemplary. Service very smooth in normal course of business. We had an incident where a party member slipped on wet floor near a wine station and the response was, I imagine, by the book, but seemed a bit off in practice-- a staff member followed them to the bathroom, and later the table was presented with a business card for the GM and a vague invitation to come back.The food is all competently done, and they make it feel like a special experience, but I just didn't find the experience to match up to the hefty price tag.",7,2,3,Liz S.,"New York, NY",952,772,1843

I gave it to the waiter and the waiter never came back to me explaining why it was in the dish nor did I even get an apology.

5.0,9/19/2018,"Service: 9/10Food: 10/10Ambiance: Modern, casualI don't know about you but this was my first Michelin restaurant where I left feeling full. Lol. I spent $900 somewhere else last year and it was a let down for me. And I left another feeling hungry that I grabbed a burger afterwards. How sad is that? I hate long 4 hour meals where you get up and your ass actually hurts. Not here. Atmosphere is very modern and relaxed and even though it's a fine dining establishment, I saw some people in t-shirts & jeans. Something about that made me feel comfortable. But most of all, the flexibility of their 4 course meal was the star. It's $108 regardless of what you choose within their categories. Such an amazing concept, don't you think? It's such a great price too.The kitchen was on their game on my night. Every dish we ordered came out warm and perfectly seasoned. Octopus was warm, soft and just salty enough to taste the sea. Such an elegant plating. Veal chop was recommended medium rare and it was so tender and so very juicy. The little pine nuts were fresh. I appreciated that. Because I ate a tuile at Daniel and it tasted stale. You know what I'm talking about. And I know I'll remember that for the rest of my life.Strip loin and that buttery mashed potato drove me crazy. And that bordelaise sauce, omg. But the dark, almost fudgy-like caramelized onion was the winner. Ugh, I wish I could buy a quart of that and schemer it on their olive roll and watch Netflix with a tub of vanilla Häagen-Dazs.Their pastas...Fergetaboutit... It's awesome. It looked small in the picture and I was worried I needed to eat 3 more bowls but it was just perfect amount, where it keeps you wanting a tiny bit more. So I ordered another one! Problem solved. Their wines are excellent. Everything was great. Some of the employees there are pretty funny. We enjoyed their banter. But most of all, their hostesses were so friendly, smiley and nice. We felt so welcomed and left feeling welcomed. Great job! Clap clap!",7,1,2,Liz P.,"Manhattan, NY",119,306,1463
4.0,9/14/2018,"I have previously been here for business lunches and was overall underwhelmed by the menu, probably should've probably given the place 3 stars. But, I recently came back for a business dinner and had a nice time, so am bumping to 4 stars.  The service was very good (except for one point on when I was trying to order 2 appetizers as noted below), the wine choices were great and the food was overall on point.  For my appetizers I ordered the Foie Gras, which was a little bit of a supplement from the tasting menu, but was delicious.  For my second course, I didn't want a pasta dish so I asked the server if I could order a second appetizer.  He seemed a little off-put by this which I thought was very strange considering the pasta dishes were more expensive than the appetizers, so why not accommodate the request.  But finally after reiterating it a couple times, he allowed me to order a second appetizer, and I chose the Fluke crude with caviar (also a supplement to the tasting menu).  The fluke was pretty tasty, I found it to be a bit heavy on the olive oil but the saltiness of the caviar was a nice complement. For my main dish I chose the lobster, which was surprisingly a good size portion.  It was very well prepared.  And for dessert, I ordered the chocolate banana dish, which if you liked that combination you won't be disappointed. Overall, I would definitely come back here for dinner.  Granted I was not paying this time, so my experience could be different if this were not a business dinner.",1,1,1,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634

They had a four course tasting menu that ran about $104 and a seven course tasting menu that ran about $150. Since it was my first time in New York and we had been in search of Michelin Star dining experiences, it only seemed right to go with the seven course menu to see what Ai Fiori had to offer- and we did not regret the decision. The service, food, timing of the dishes, and the attention to detail was top notch. The amuse-bouche that night was a watermelon gazpacho, followed by the first course: a trio of burrata and caviar, lobster toast, and a mushroom and tomato arancini ball. Next was a tomato and mozzarella dish with pesto. Then came the soft shelled crabs, followed by the veal angolotti, five spice scallops, then a fillet cooked to perfection. A cheese plate followed, then a sorbet palate cleanser, and finally dessert. Since we were celebrating a birthday, they even added an extra dessert and left with an Ai Fiori goodie bag complete with a tin of chocolate almonds, kettle corn and a rolled up menu, as well as a card signed by all the staff that night.

Even though lunch didn't open until 11:30, they had seating in the bar area and a mid-morning menu that helped tie me over until then. I got the prosciutto and melon and it was a perfect snack, both delicious and not too big for our party. For lunch I chose to do 2-courses. The lobster bisque appetizer was delicious. A bit more watery than I expected from something called a bisque but it was delicious without a doubt. Next, I got the scallops. They were the perfect size where I could finish them without being bloated and stuffed, very satisfying. Though I don't know what I was expecting maybe something a bit more light, but it was a heavier taste and dish. Despite that, they were still very good and seemed to be cooked perfectly.

3.0,8/16/2018,"We went here for a company gathering party about a month ago. We all opted to get the fixe menu for lunch.For my appetizer I started off with a lobster bisque which was all right. I felt that it was very bland in my opinion with  two tiny pieces of lobster. I should have opted to get the halibut and caviar appetizer, that to me look more appetizing since it had so much caviar on top. For my main entree I got the steak, now out of all the main dishes that were available out of the halibut or ravioli, I guess it's safe to say i got the best entree. It was delicious and the sauce on the dish paired really well with the potato and steak.The reason why I gave this place a 3 star review is mainly because one of the runners spilled some beer on one of our members, although he did apologize, but for an establishment as fine like this, that's not something I'd expect.

The salad was a lovely clean and yet lightly savoury starter. This dish was very simple but had great showcasing of ingredients.  The main; housemade tagliatelle with basil pesto, tomato, and ricotta salata; was excellent. I pasta was soft and chewy in perfect boiled execution. The sauce was loaded with butter, but well balanced with the fresh and sharp notes of the basil and small grape tomatoes. The chocolate olive oil cake threw me off a bit. The exterior is a layer of chocolate mousse, which was excellent. However, the cake inside was slightly dry and not as smooth as an olive oil cake ought to be. Ai Fiori showed attention to detail in their execution and flavor selection.

This wasn't the case with the food here. I mean it's a Michelin star for Christ sake!!! Even though it's a restaurant week menu, you can't compromise on the taste. Never coz u need to live up to your Michelin status. The first course was mehhh but that's okay,since we pay a discounted price for a restaurant week.

Later on they stopped telling us what the dish was etc etc. I mean it's a tasting menu tell us what it is.In the beginning we asked what the vegetarian tasting menu comprised of but got no definite answers just that there would be 7 courses. I had the non veg tasting menu so the review is on that. So why was I disappointed! Usually when I go to a nice place esp for tasting menus I expect different flavors and beautiful concoctions. None of that was there sadly.The soup was bland with some over cooked shrimp on it. Breadsticks were good and had a crunch when you broke them in half. Which is what I expected! The fritter has nothing extraordinary to mention but deep fried something always tastes a certain way. Filling was underwhelming. Octopus was nice and tenders but the sauce or whatever it came with had no real kick. Nothing great. But not bad either. That crabmeat pasta was DELICIOUS! amazing flavors and Star of the show. The second hit of the night was the steak. The jus was brilliant and the Farris and spinach were awesome. Saving grace :)Scallops were scallops with veggies nothing extraordinaire! Dessert was good not great. Chocolate mousse with choc ganache (I'm guessing we weren't told what all it had). Some is cream. There was some limoncello palette cleanser between entrees and dessert too.They ended with some complimentary marshmallowy things and other treats- too sweet for our table!I really hoped it would be great food.

It wasn't plated at all and literally only had 2 pieces of shrimp, a quarter of a scallop, and two squid tentacles. I also noticed that the table next to us who ordered the same thing recieved slightly bigger portions. -Tagliatelle: 3/5. Good portion size, texture of the pasta was perfect, pesto was good but nothing spectacular. Dish was a little underseasoned so had to ask for salt and pepper.-Cioccolato: 4/5. Delicious! The chocolate olive oil cake was soft and moist which paired well with the smooth mousse. The olive oil gelato was a nice contrast in texture and balanced the flavors out. Star of the meal!Service: 2/5. I expected the restaurant to have better service.

Ambiance: Beautiful modern, on second floor overlooking 5th ave. There are lovely pink/ white flowers that separate the interior seating. The ambiance itself is that of a Michelin star restaurant. Food: The 5 course tasting may not be what you're looking for if you'd like a good sampling of the menu. I will say some courses are spectacular (crudo di passera fluke) - perfect texture, taste brought out by citrus ) this was an excellent course on a hot summer day. Average and wholesome -blue crab spaghetti- spicy/ salty which works well after a refreshing fish appetizer. Okay lamb ( a bit dry, and sides with limited flavoring) . I think the most disappointing was the 4th course which was that of a slice of cheese paired with fruit preserve. Service: there were 8 different servers ... making it hard to check in , fill water in a timely fashion. I could hear the head server asking everyone to do the job . Not sure if this was the training period, but definitely took away from the ambiance. Not quite sure if I'd return.

4.0,6/14/2018,"So I'm actually a bit torn on how to review this place... I'm again wishing Yelp had an advanced rating system where we could opt to rate in a breakdown method or perhaps 1/2 stars.If 1/2 stars existed I'd rate a 3.5... not a 3, not a 4.  The only reason I'm giving a 4 is because aside from the server forgetting my sons Pepsi, there was nothing disappointing about the experience... At any rate, the thing I love about this place is the overall vibe when you enter, walking into the lounge area which is bustling with energy.The dining area itself is also quite nice with just the right amount of energy to overcome the common air of stuffiness in such restaurants, while still maintaining an intimate setting.Other loves... love the active wine bars they have set up with attentive sommeliers milling about & the desert server offering a simple selection of chocolate truffles.As for our service, our server was quite professional and courteous.The food was all prepared well, nothing wrong with any of it... you can see the various entrees we had for our 7 course chefs tasting menu. The end... yes... see my point?If you're like me, fair or not, when I elect to go to a Michelin Star rated establishment, my expectation is quite high.  I feel I should be raving about this wonderful experience... but I'm not...  instead I feel like I'm reaching for something good to convince myself they are deserving of something more than a 3  rating.... I feel a Chefs tasting menu should exemplify the Chef's ability and passion... In this case, I feel either the Chef wasn't involved at all, or perhaps I should have ordered from the normal menu so I could have received whatever amazing food it was that; in large part; contributed the the M-Star...... Additionally, not that I'm at all a stuffed shirt, nor do I really care, but watching as the parade of service staff (not so much the servers as the bussers, drink and food expediters) loitered around the wine bar, chatting each other up as you'd expect to see at a Denny's diner and apparently having their own private wine tasting under what appeared to be the sommelier's supervision demonstrated a lack of management being present which is nothing any business owner wants to see happening... or worse yet, hear from client observations.As for the environment inside, though I liked the vibe; in particular at the lounge and bar, I disliked they had completely blocked the view outside in the main dining area with drapery, used to partition when a private event is occurring or in the case of the evening I was there, to make it look more full by not allowing you to see most of the tables were not occupied.Anyway, was it terrible??? absolutely not!  I'm perhaps being a picky douche in fact, but at this level, I don't feel bad about being picky.  Though on 1 hand I feel dinner for 2 @ $300 (just the meal, not drinks) one should expect something truly amazing , I don't feel it was a bad value or priced out of line because I don't think we could have had a similar 7-course tasting menu at a similar restaurant for any less.Would I come again??? Mmm... I think so, but only to see if I could be inspired enough to give them a true 4 stars or even 5.... rather than giving them 4 stars only because I feel guilting giving 3 since there was nothing really terrible about the experience.That said, with so many other great options within a 10 block radius, I'm not sure I could justify another $150 per person meal, plus drinks for the hopes they deliver a better experience...  that's usually what I do only after I've been Wowed once.",6,0,1,Chad S.,"Naples, FL",89,249,654

5.0,6/5/2018,"I made a lunch reservation for my wife and I to celebrate our anniversary a couple weeks ago for today using a gift voucher for a 3-course deal, and requested to be seated by the window.  We arrived 20 minutes early and was offered an inside table.  We insisted that we'd rather wait for 1 when available.  So we sat by the bar to wait; shortly after, the manager, Richard courteously approached us and apologized for the situation and assured us that a table will be set for us as soon as it becomes available, and even offered a complimentary glass of wine or drink.  We were pleasantly surprised by such a nice gesture.About 10 minutes later, the manager came back to announce that a table was being set up for us.  Shortly after we were seated and handed the menu, John, the waiter came by and patiently explained and advised us on the options of selecting our 3 courses from the appetizers & entrees.  We made our choices based on what appeal most to us.  The menu does look very appetizing anyway.While waiting for our first course, munching on the nice bread, John came by to advise that our lunch voucher was intended for a 3-course that includes an appetizer, a pasta lunch, and a dessert.  Since we were mistakenly handed a wrong menu and the orders were already sent to the kitchen, they want to keep the offer as is.  Wow!  Such a generous deal for us.Everything went extremely well: each dish was so elegantly presented, the temperatures were perfect, and the taste was outstanding.  Manager Richard came by a few times to make sure we were well taken care of.  The wait staff was very professional.I guess it's simply our very lucky day to have dined at such a nice restaurant.",0,0,1,Timothy L.,"Ridgewood, NJ",0,18,0
3.0,6/4/2018,"When a restaurant is Michelin starred, the expectations are high. Some places meet that expectations; others don't come close. This one was the latter. The food is good, but not amazing by any means, and especially not so much to justify the price. The service is really where this place falls flat on its face. Anyone who thinks this is a sister restaurant to Marea is kidding themselves. Go to Marea for a much better overall experience. Made the reservation and noted we were doing the tasting menu, and the wife was very pregnant. The assured me they could accommodate the tasting menu. Called the day before to make sure it was in the notes, and they confirmed it was. Reminded the waiter again when he asked if we had any allergies. Somehow we still were served beef tartar (which after 20 minutes of discussion turned out not to be beef tartar) and duck cooked medium rare, which has to be sent back to be cooked more. Beyond ignoring basics of dining for a pregnant woman, in the course of a 2:45 long meal, I was not asked if I wanted a second drink the entire time. I'm not entirely sure who our waiter even was as I ended up ordering my drink for a bus boy after he noticed the drink menu in my lap 2 courses in. Amuse bouche of asparagus purée - nice asparagus flavor. Bright and springy little taste. Mixed plate of bites - sole excellent burrata cheese with truffle, a crostini with what were was told was beef tartar (ended up being some type of tapenade), and a fried arancini. The burrata and truffle was the standout here; the other two items were ok. Lobster Soup - nicely done lobster soup, and it's appropriately called that and not a bisque as if there is any cream, it's minimal. And speaking of minimal, you get two tiny slices of a lobster claw. They honestly might be better served not including any lobster at all. Lobster Salad - nice refreshing dish with spring vegetables, a light pesto, and nice chunks of lobster. Cavatelli with Sausage - the pasta had a great bite to it, and the flavors of the sausage and greens made for an enjoyable dish. Butter Poached Halibut - this dish really had no distinct flavor to it. I'm really surprised that a dish poached in butter could be bland. The only saving grace is the couscous absorbed the butter flavor of the sauce from the fish. Duck Breast - aside from the fact the served a pregnant woman a medium rare duck breast, this was actually a good dish (both medium rare for me, and cooked well for my wife). The crunchy sweet almond slice on top added texture and paired perfectly with the sweet berry sauce. This was the best dish of the tasting menu. Cheese Plate - nice piece of cheese, similar to a Brie. Palate Cleanser - a nice couple of spoonfuls of a citrus sorbet filled with citrus pulp and zest. It has both flavor and texture. Gelato and Sorbet Plate - this was excellent. The dessert was some vanilla gelato and blueberry sorbet with what I'll compare to pound cake. This was really nicely done and the textures and flavors all paired and played well off of and with each other.Overall, the food here was certainly good, but not Michelin star good, and the service was spotty at best. I don't expect I'll be back.",6,1,2,Dave F.,"Hoboken, NJ",429,633,1392

We were warmly greeted bu the hostess and we were able to sit at our table ahead of our reservation time. The menu gave us the option of a tasting menu or a la carte and we chose the latter. We started off with a palette cleansing asparagus soup. For appetizers we had the octopus and the roasted squab. The squab was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. My parents enjoyed the octopus dish. For my entree, I had the duck breast. Again, this was a great dish that was seasoned and cooked well. My mom had the pasta with pork sausage and my dad had the lamb. Both of them enjoyed their dishes. For dessert, we shared a chocolate mousse with hazelnut praline and white espresso gelato. This was also delicious, however my only complaint about this dessert is that the chocolate was very rich and a couple of spoonfuls is good enough.One criticism that I have of this restaurant is that I felt that there were a lot of wait staff just standing around and talking to each other. Unlike many other Michelin star restaurants that I have been to, I felt that the staff were, at times, inattentive to the diners.

The only dish I would not order again was the lobster tail. It was good, but everything else was better and more special. For any Wine-O this is an extra must visit (wine list over 100 pages).

My cousins and I decide to try the prix fixe dinner and I have to say hands down the best choice. You were able to pick anything from each category and trade with each other so we could taste different things. I got the Uovo to start and the poached egg was runny. Taking the braised lamb and dragging it across the runny yolk gave the dish a decadent rich flavor to the dish.Next was the Anatra. Most place I feel like they either over cook the duck or it's not prepared right. At Ai Fiori you could tell when cutting into the duck that they slow cooked it. The duck was juicy and flavorful.If you're coming in a big group, again I suggest everyone getting the Prix-fixe because then you can try a little of everything they have to offer",1,0,0,Jackie N.,"Fairfax, VA",216,76,156

The bar tender was friendly and knowledgeable. He took my drink over to our table in the dining room. The service (at least through the first 3/4 of the meal) was perfect. Unfortunately, we were stuffed, busting, you get the idea, after the first two courses. I tried to nibble at the remaining courses (took 3 home! - so uncouth) because I wanted to save room for dessert and the petit fours I kept watching go by. Unfortunately, I guess with the 7 course, they don't give you the petit fours. I recommend everything we tasted. I really liked the chilled pea soup, but next time I might just order the Agnolotti, Ippoglosso or Abbacchio, and Cioccolato, and hope they serve the intermezzo with lime granita and apple (ice cream?).",0,0,0,Holly R.,"New York, NY",4,69,11
3.0,4/23/2018,"Italian/American upscale restaurant with amazing interior and exceptional food. While every part of our meal was amazing, the service was disappointing. Visited Ai Fiori for a special occasion to celebrate with Dinosaur. We decided to get the four-course meal for him and entree and appetizer for me. Or was the other way around... oops. Best of the night: APPETIZERS!!! Yes and yes. The most memorable part of the night were the lobster salad and octopus appetizer. General amount of lobster with snowpeas and onions. Love the pesto sauce. Presentation was also excellent. The octopus salad was heavenly. Cooked with olives, the octopus was incredibly tender and flavorful. They must poach the octopus prior to grilling it because it literally melts in your mouth. We got the blue crab spaghetti and was very nice as well. Has a hint of sourness from the lemon but also firey kick from the pepper flakes. Loved every bit of it.As for our mains, we were recommended the poached lobster and dry aged strip loin. The lobster was cooked amazingly. The accompanying butter sauce was not too heavy, which was nice. The dry aged strip was cooked nicely, but a bit heavy on the glaze. Sooo... why the 3 stars = disappointing service. To start of our night, we came about 10 minutes early for our table. We expected to be seated on time closer to our actual reservation time. But we were seated 10 minutes AFTER our reservation time... so we ended up waiting while standing for 20 minutes. The hostess seemed to not care as she did not check on us throughout those 20 minutes. Then when we were finally seated, no one came by for another 10 minutes. What is the magic waiting time with Ai Fiori in increments of 10 minutes?! When the server finally came by, he asked whether we wanted anything to drink, BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE DRINK MENU YET. Long story short, hangry by the time we ordered and our server didn't check in with us until dessert time.

What that means is I didn't really care about the Michelin star or how luxurious it was. It was my wife's birthday and I gave her money to buy a fancy outfit for a night in NYC so as long as she was happy I was happy. First off the service was excellent. We used Open Table to book a reservation and arrived 15 mins early to be quickly whisked to our awaiting table. We were given water and our drink orders were taken immediately. This is key as with any trip to NYC there's a lot of walking involved and I was totally dehydrated. We went with the prix fixe menu and chose 4 options.

We had a 6 pm Friday reservation and we were seated promptly. The place was quite empty when we arrived but completely buzzing when we left about 3 hours later.We went for the four course tasting menu with wine pairing (105 for the tasting menu and 55 for wine pairing). For those of you who have these basic concerns/ questions that I always have, four course tasting menu fills your belly up and some :) Out of the breads which were brought to us, we went for the wheat and cranberry one. Wheat one was pretty meh for me but cranberry one was delish! The person serving the bread was very sweet and eager to help. He made sure our bread dish was always stacked and water was always refilled. We went with lobster and scallops appetizers, black squid ink pasta and the spicy spaghetti, swordfish and lobster entree and olive cake/ blueberry gelato and chocolate/ Expresso gelato desserts. Everything was very delicious but the scallops, spicy spaghetti, lobster entree and both desserts knocked it out of the park! The food portion is also respectable for a tasting menu. The wine pairing was equally good but we felt a little cheated because they served us same wine for pasta course and the entree even though our orders were different and the amount of wine is skimpy. For 55 bucks, I expected more wine. At the end they brought out tiny desserts courtesy the pastry chef and they rocked as well.Service was very good too. With the restaurant getting busy, it slowed down sometimes but it gave us some time to make room for the next course and just chat away! When we requested the server to not bring our desserts out for a little while because we were so so full, she without flinching told us to take as much time as we needed. We sat on it for about 15 mins and nobody bothered us to rush anything. The restaurant is very easy to get too by the way.

5.0,3/27/2018,"Thoroughly impressed with my whole experience at Ai Fiori (as was my whole table)! Definitely deserves a Michelle star (or two). While it is an upscale restaurant, it doesn't have the stuffy or pretentious feel like Del Posto or Eleven Madison. Don't expect the stodgy corporate vibe (although there is a lot of businessmen/business women customers). Instead, waiters, sommelier, and even the busboys are down to earth and actually making friendly conversation with the table and giving their honest recommendations. Despite the somewhat informal attitude, the service was impeccable. Great place to catch up with friends or family (wouldn't recommend a very large party though). The food was equally as incredible. Everything from the welcome dish to the dessert was on point! I had the truffle ravioli pasta dish which was probably the best ravioli I have ever had. The truffle sauce added the perfect touch of light sweetness that I would have never thought to incorporate. Good place for vegetarians and meat eaters a like (there are also some pescaterian friendly dishes). Drinks are strong and although not a craft cocktail lounge, tasted like them! Although I went in expected a hefty bill, it only came out to about $120 per person including tax and tip (two shared appetizers, one entrée per person, two share desserts, and two drinks per person). By far, one of the most reasonably priced Michelin restaurants in the city (just for comparison, Del Posto was almost $300 per person for about the same amount).",4,2,2,Priya S.,"New York, NY",219,155,94

My phone died when I arrived so I didn't get any pictures, but the waiter actually noticed and had it charged for me during the meal. That's some next level service.We went with the four course prix fixe. For starters, the polipo octopus and the foie gras were excellent. For pasta, I would highly recommend the Trofie Nero (squid ink). So good. It comes with octopus, scallops and crunchy breadcrumbs, and the whole dish overall is just perfect. Ai Fiori also features the best lobster I've had in my life, no joke. The Astice lobster tail is plump, and just gives a hint of resistance to your fork before it sinks through. Then it melts in your mouth. I may come back just for that lobster.We ordered three desserts, but everyone kept coming back to the Cioccolato chocolate mousse.

Apparently, they make one of the best Old-Fashioned in town- I'll speak more on this later in my review. I was disappointed that they initially didn't have any availability listed on Open Table, so I decided to call the restaurant directly to place a reservation and they were able to squeeze in a party of 2 for Friday at lunch. I was elated. During the reservation process, they will ask if this is for a special occasion and ask again during the final confirmation. I have heard that they will even prepare a special menu to tailor to the special occasion.My friend and I arrived promptly at the beautiful Langham Hotel, where the restaurant is located on the 2nd floor. We checked-in and were immediately seated. Every table in the dining room was occupied. I figured it was mainly because it was the last day of RW.  My friend and I did a quick skim of the menu (obviously, we had already picked out our dishes prior to making the reservation). It seemed like they had most of the same dishes they typically offer. Appetizer- Fegatini di Pollo- chicken liver mousse, apple mostarda, toasted bread: Delicious! I wish the dish came with more toast. Thankfully, the servers continue making their rounds to the tables offering refills on water and bread.Entrée- Tagliata- strip loin, pommes purée, cippolini onions, bordelaise: Cooked perfectly medium rare.Dessert- Budino al Limone- cinnamon sabayon, speculoos, olive oil gelato: Refreshing and light!These were some of the other menu options for RW that I wish I could've tried:1) Zuppa di Zucca- butternut squash soup, brown butter, pumpkin seeds, sage2) Risotto- riso acquerello, black truffles, butter, parmigiano (+$9 supp)3) Cioccolato- chocolate opera cake, caramel, white espresso gelato The service was exquisite as you would expect in a Michelin-rated restaurant. As previously mentioned, the servers were attentive and continuously walked around refilling water glasses and bread, and our hostess checked-in several times throughout the meal.  If the budget allows for it, I would highly recommend coming here to experience dining at a Michelin Star restaurant. You can also just come here for cocktails. They make an amazing Old-Fashioned where they use a block of ice and stir it with a stainless steel cocktail straw and garnish it with a flamed orange twist- if you were ever curious how an Old Fashioned is supposed to be made then come here! Just watching the bartender make the drink was a good experience. But, even a cocktail will set you back $20 (before tax + tip).

Was the menu explained adequately?8. Can they cook a peice of meat to temp?Regrettably Ai Fiori fell short on most of these. We were taken to our table by someone who never said a word or gave any indication of where we would be seated. (See #1). Menus were placed in front of us with no discussion of who our waiter was or when they would arrive. And he took his time.. (see #3). A quick discussion about water and he was gone. Bread arrived before discussing the appetizer or cocktails, (See #5) which gave us a rushed feeling. The waiter was asked for recommendations and just jumped around the menu between apps and entrees, so we really didn't know if this was a preferred order of dining or if he just couldn't take a minute to walk us through by section. (See #7) After determining our drinks, and waiting another ten minutes I sent mine back. (See #4). Apparently the bartender was exercising his whimsy to a drink that is about as specific as it gets. I ordered the veal chop and it was over cooked to a firm medium well. Frustrated I sliced through the entire chop and presented it to the waiter and asked ""is this your kitchens version of medium rare""? No it is not said the waiter who promptly took it away and brought back a rare veal chop?! Not wanting to go through this again and make my wife any more uncomfortable, I ate the veal. The dessert was a forgettable affogato. Nothing on the bill was adjusted and the manager never came to the table to explain their evenings shortcomings.

Meanwhile the table next to us got birthday candles and a gift to go. 2. Our main waiter didn't read us the specials or introduce the menu to us. I didn't even noticed he hadn't until I heard him announcing the razor clams special to the next table. Which is something I would've ordered instead. The food was so good I'm giving the restaurant 4 star. If the above had been better, this would be a 5 star reviewAntipasti: tried Scallops and the lobster salad. AMAZING have to try either or both. Highly recommend. Good portions of both seafood as well. Pasta: tried the spaghetti and the trofie Nero. The trofie Nero is a more flavorful dish. Rly packs a punch! One of my fave dishes of the night. The Spaghetti has a more subtle taste but just as powerful in the experience. Loved both Entree: tried the Long Island duck and the dry aged strip loin. I enjoyed be dry aged strip loin better. The duck was a little too rare for me and Im usually ok with med rares. I've also had more tender duck breast at other places. The dry aged was just phenomenal!!Dessert: tried the semifreddo and the tiramisu. I couldn't taste the earl grey in the semifreddo which is one of the reasons why I ordered it. The tiramisu was good but not great. I don't recommend either.  Overall I loved the food. It's $104 for four course pri fixe and had decent portions for a 2016 Michelin restaurant.

2.0,2/12/2018,"We decided to try this Michelin-star restaurant during NYC Restaurant Week with my co-workers and really regretted. The interior was impressive, as well as the service but we came there for food not for ""bells and whistles"". We tried almost everything on the menu and were not impressed. First, it was obvious they prepared chicken liver mousse ahead as it had dried crusts on the edges(=not fresh). Moving to the main dish: salmon and strip lion. We found bones(!!!) inside salmon steaks which is unacceptable for this level of restaurant. A beef steak was ok, super-chewy though (not tender at all) and it was impossible to cut it with dull knives they provided. A chocolate opera cake was super-dry and literally fell apart when you touch it (no moisture inside at all). Also we ordered tea and they brought a teapot with a tea-bag inside. Just think about it: a tea bag in a Michelin-star restaurant! The rest of the menu was just ok, no ""wow"" or ""climax with every bite"".  I can't believe they have a Michelin star based on our experience. The level of food is equal to any mid-range NYC restaurant. I can't even imagine what Gordon Ramsay would say if he saw bones in salmon.",0,0,0,Julia G.,"Jersey City, NJ",29,1,0
2.0,2/12/2018,"Went to lunch with my daughter for Restaurant Week and we were far from impressed. Upon arriving the hostess barely looked up at us and never smiled or made us feel welcome. We were seated promptly and I have to say that the service was very good. What was not so good was the food. The whole time it felt like they just didn't really care about the food they were serving to Restaurant Week patrons. We started with the chicken liver mousse which had obviously been placed in the plate quite a while before it got to us since the edges of the mousse were dry and unappetizing looking. How long does it take to freshly plate a 2 ingredient appetizer?For entrees we had the carbonara pasta, which was fine but not, in any way, a stand out and the strip steak which was also a very safe presentation and not really remarkable at all. The flavors were just very predictable, there was nothing new or imaginative about the food. For dessert we had the cake, which I agree completely with other reviews was dry and unexciting. My lemon dessert was the best part of the meal. It was delicious. What this comes down to for me is that I traveled a long way to go to New York City for restaurant week and chose my restaurant carefully. I was very excited to have the opportunity to eat in a Michelin starred restaurant since I can not normally afford a place like that. So, for us, this was a special occasion. The feeling we got was that they really didn't care what they served Restaurant Week diners. This is an opportunity for them to cultivate new patrons and give people who can not afford to eat at places like that a real treat. Our experience was disappointing and made me wish I had chosen a different restaurant. There was nothing in the food that we were given that made me see why this place has a Michelin star. I have owned and worked in restaurants and you could just see that the kitchen really didn't care. If you are not going to do something special for your guests why participate in Restaurant Week at all? Those of us who spent our hard earned money thinking we were going to get a special meal would appreciate it if you didn't.",2,0,0,Karen N.,"Stowe, VT",0,1,0
2.0,2/7/2018,"I really wanted to love my experience here, but I didn't. Being a 1 star michelin restaurant I had very high expectations. Upon walking in for restaurant week during lunch and being seated, I waited about 10-15 minutes to even receive the menu. 10-15 minutes later once more, I had grown very impatient so I flagged someone down because it was a half hour into being seated and I still was not approached if I was ready to order or not, nor was I provided bread for the table until after this encounter. The man I flagged down did apologize and offer a complimentary beverage, but the one I received was not the one I requested. Since it was free anyways I did not make a huge fuss about this. The appetizer I had was good, which was the liver mousse, but they didn't provide enough bread, so I had to play the waiting game once more and ask for more bread for the table so I could finish the appetizer. For my entree, I got the strip which I thought was okay nothing that wowed me. For the dessert, I chose the chocolate opera cake which I found super dry, which from other reviewers seems to be a common thing regarding that specific dessert. Throughout the whole dinner service, I was never approached and asked about my meal. The only time I was asked, was from a waitress as she was taking my dessert plate away. I really wanted to give them three stars, but my whole experience was not very enjoyable and I basically received 0 service  while I was dining here.

We added a bottle of red wine for $40.The restaurant is located inside a hotel. Our reservation was for noon, and we were seated right away. It was a very busy time, but we were not forgotten about. The server was friendly and tended to us often. He made sure that we had everything that we needed. Someone came around offering slices of bread, and continued to refill out waters. Refilling my water is a plus, because I dislike being thirsty :) Overall, the food was good. Started with Zuppa di Zucca, which was a butternut squash soup. It was smooth and creamy. For my entree, I had the Risotto that had black truffles. It was a supplementary $9, and well worth it. Lastly, ended with cioccolato. It was a chocolate opera cake. My least favorite of the meal.

5.0,2/2/2018,"I absolutely loved this place. Came here yesterday on a date and just enjoyed every part of it. Ai Fiori has been on my to do list because it's Michelin star rated and close to where I live. I never visit one of these places twice, especially once I do a full tasting menu. Let me just say the food was absolutely delicious. I've been disappointed by so many high level restaurants because they excel on service but the food is just ok tasting (ex: Eleven Madison Park). Every dish here was absolutely delicious. On top of that service was impeccable. Every dish changed between servings. Constant refills of our water from our bottle, just extremely attentive. And they were busy, I called to see if we could come 30 min earlier than our reservation but we couldn't be accommodated for that because they were busy. So their service is outstanding even when packed. The venue is stunning. Bathroom, dining area, all high end and plush. Very cozy bar area with small loungy chairs. A real mix in the bar area of comfort with high end decor. For $104 their regular 4 part tasting menu is well worth it. Cocktails were amazing. Their negroni was the best I've ever had.

4.0,2/1/2018,"I gave this a four star due to our seating arrangements. While making reservations on opentable, i have stated that it was for a birthday occasion. We were a party of two and they sat us in a round table by the register where the waiters and waitresses passed by often. Moving forward, we went with the prefix menu. As a appetizer/antipasti, we went with the polipo and the recommendation of the canestrelli. We really enjoyed both appetizers. They were delicious! For the pasta, we went with the trofie nero which had a little kick of spice and the spaghetti. Both were specular! For the main course, we had he tagaliata and the astice. The sauce for the astice was very similar to the canestrelli but nonetheless it was very palatable. For dessert/dolci we had the semifreddo, which he really liked because of the raspberry jam. The raspberry jam was bit sour for me. I really enjoyed the tiramisu because it wasn't too sweet and the chocolate gelato complimented the lady finger cake.

See my picture because I can't do the presentation justice. It is hard to describe how satisfying that deep mousse flavor was, so I'll just say you must try it if given the chance.  My wife had a mixed green salad with pickled vegetables and manchego cheese.  Very tasty and the healthier appetizer of the two.Moving on to the entrees, we both chose the strip loin, over puréed potatoes, deeply caramelized onions, and bordelaise sauce.   This dish brought the hearty beef, the sweet onions, and the creamy potatoes together for a memorable bite.  I chose the house red, and liked the way it paired with both my dishes.Chocolate opera cake for desert.

2.0,1/20/2018,"I am sorry but I got a lot of hate for this place. My husband and I went for our anniversary expecting something amazing..you know, the Michelin experience. First of all, the atmosphere is very much like a diner. It's very loud in there. No music is playing, and you have to yell to hear each other. Next, the tables seemed to large, and my husband was way too far across from me, that we couldn't hold hands or talk to each other. When the waiter came, I asked for him to recommend something for aperitif that isn't Nigroni, and he recommended a creamy drink. WAT. My nigroni was fine, and another drink with we ordered with gin was fine as well. Probably our favorite part of the whole experience. As my first I ordered a lobster soup, which was too spicy. It wasn't perfect. My husband ordered a crab salad which was even worse than my soup. For second I ordered blue crab pasta which tasted... I am sorry, like salty ramen noodles. My husband ordered duck, and the waiter didn't ask him how he wanted his duck done... I didn't finish my meal and asked for check. Totally ruined night. That pasta was just nasty. Duck was ok, but far from fine or great. And one last thing... I know this is just picking on everything, but this place is Italia/French right, then why did the restroom have sakura pictures all over it?

5.0,1/17/2018,"OVERALL: With a price point near what you'd expect given the caliber of the restaurant, Al Fiori delivers incredible service in a calm atmosphere with delicious cuisine worthy of its Michelin star.ATMOSPHERE: Calm, surrounded by soft greys and warm colors. Tables are nicely spaced out, allowing you to have a quiet yet perfectly audible conversation. I wore a jacket & tie and didn't feel overdressed, but probably could have lost the tie and been fine.DRINKS: I had the Birch Bourbon cocktail to start - delicious, like a sweeter old fashioned with great floral flavor. My girlfriend and I shared a bottle of wine for dinner, and I had a glass of port with dessert. The selection is daunting, but the staff provided excellent recommendations.APPETIZERS: We did the fixed price menu, which was $104 per person, and includes an appetizer, pasta, main, and dessert. For our appetizers, we had the scallops and octopus. Octopus was a tiny bit overcooked but very flavorful, but the scallops were absolutely delicious.FOOD: I had the cavatelli followed by tagliata, which was a delicious combo. The cavatelli had a fresh, delightful texture and the tagliata was perfectly cooked. My girlfriend had risotto and also had the tagliata - the risotto had small apple chunks in it which added an interesting texture and taste.DESSERT: For dessert, we shared the tiramisu and the pecorino cake. The tiramisu wasn't anything different - just a really well done tiramisu. The pecorino cake was a very interesting taste and paired beautifully with my dessert wine. SERVICE: The service, as you could expect, was absolutely impeccable. We didn't feel rushed or pressured to finish quickly, our plates were always quickly removed, and all the standard rules of table etiquitte were followed to the utmost details. The only exception was when a waiter poured flat water into my sparkling water - but that mistake was never repeated, so I commend him for communicating that to the rest of the staff.VALUE: It's expensive. We were celebrating two special events in our life and decided to treat ourselves, which ran us about $250pp after tax & tip. It's an experience I'm thankful to have had and don't regret, but not one that I can afford to repeat in the near future!

Extensive wine selection/sommelier helpful.  Lows: The servers lack attentiveness and follow-through.  The service typically starts off strong, then after a time, their attention seems to go elsewhere, and you're left begging the bread guy for your last dish. Most of the appetizers are forgettable and amount to about a spoonful of food (for $25-$30). Fish dishes are just okay. Desserts are a great disappointment - affogato and chocolate dishes are both a waste.  Coffee service will add a frustrating 45 minutes to your dining experience. They do nothing for your anniversary or special evening, so go elsewhere if you want a surprise.Bottom line:  As far as 1-star Michelin's, Ai Fiori is just okay.

This time, the service was disappointing. At a Michelin star restaurant, I do have high expectations, in fairness, but they just missed the mark. As the simplest example, we ordered two bottles of wine and they were attentive in filling up our glasses for the first bottle and then just seemed to have disappeared for the second bottle.

5.0,1/5/2018,"I wanted to go somewhere special for my anniversary dinner and Ai Fiori seemed like the best place! Ai Fiori's inside the Langham Hotel on 5th avenue. I wasn't sure if there was another entrance besides walking into the hotel but during the holidays it was so beautiful decorated. There was a beautiful Christmas tree and the spiral staircase was decorated in tinsel and vines. Walking in you see the bar/lounge area. I could really see myself coming in for a cocktail or glass of wine. The bar area is very classy and there's a lot of seating area. I also think they have a separate menu apart from the restaurant. Anyways, going in to the restaurant is so beautiful! Floor to ceiling windows so you can overlook 5th avenue. I came in on a Friday night and this place was really packed. I'm happy I made a reservation! Looking around I could see a lot of tourists come here or people on special occasions. The waitstaff were super friendly and really attentive with refilling our waters and wine. Their wine menu is really impressive! They have such a long list. The only negative is that it's crazy overpriced but that's how it usually is at a restaurant. My boyfriend and I opted out of getting cocktails but they had a great list and they can also make anything you want that's not on the list.My boyfriend and I opted for the 7 course chef tasting and I'm so happy we did! It was a great experience. They first start off with a amuse bouche of burrata and caviar, lobster on a bagel chip, and wild mushroom arancini. I loved each one! The burrata was so fresh, the lobster was delicious (I wish there was more), and the arancini was so savory! I wish there were more! The next dish was another amuse bouche with pomegranates and nuts. I wish I remembered exactly what it was but it was really refreshing. The next dish the fluke crudo with american sturgeon caviar and meyer lemon was amazing. The meyer lemon in it really brought out the flavors. I'm also happy we got to eat some caviar during the tasting. The dish that I loved was the butter poached lobster with artichokes! Delicious. I wish there was more lobster. Coming to Ai Fiori I really wanted to try some of their pasta's. During the tasting we got to try their spaghetti. This dish was a little spicy but it's nothing no one could handle and it made the dish better. The home made spaghetti came with blue crab, chilis, lemon, and bottarga. The spaghetti was one of the highlights to my night. This dish is what made me want to just come back just to order it. I loved the blue crab in it and the spaghetti itself was really well made! The octopus was also really good this came with sunchokes, capers, and radicchio. I love octopus and they cooked it so well. There were some pictures I didn't manage to get because I ate it but the dry age steak was one of them! Delicious! The cheese selection they gave us and dessert ended the night so perfectly. They even wrote Happy Anniversary on our chocolate! So sweet!At the end of the night we received a card signed by all the staff saying Happy Anniversary and a tin of chocolate nuts and bag of caramel popcorn.

3.0,12/4/2017,"We went to this restaurant inside the Langham Place Hotel frankly because we had a Gilt voucher (if I'm being truthful, not sure we would have gone otherwise).First lets address the elephant in the room. This place is super-pricey. You're just not going to derive value out of a meal this expensive. Now that that's out of the way...The apps here were phenomenal. The foie gras app especially was probably the best I've had in a decade (maybe longer). Just absolutely perfect... The cassoulet was a close second in terms of originality and taste. Really well done, overall. My risotto was also quite good, but not special or all that surprising.It's the entrees that were the biggest let down in my opinion. There was nothing wrong with any of them. But for the price they were so... expected. Just basic really. All that originality I guess got used up in the apps...The drinks were great and the service was top notch. Ambiance-wise, I can do without the curtains (gave the place a ""hotel"" feel). And the desserts weren't too special overall...And not to nit-pick here but if you're going to offer mignardises you might want to try a little harder. Just saying...",1,1,0,Art C.,"Brooklyn, NY",179,1167,91
5.0,12/3/2017,"Did this place get better with age, or do I just appreciate good food more? Hard to say, but my recent meal here blew the one I had 5 years ago out of the water. Also given that this restaurant has been around for as long as it has, it's probably the latter.Located on the second floor of the Langham Hotel (on top of a spiral staircase, no less), Ai Fiori is the perfect special occasion restaurant. Although there's definitely a bit of a corporate vibe given its location and price point, I saw a pretty diverse - but well heeled - crowd when I came for dinner on a Thursday evening. Reservations are a must, as the restaurant was extremely crowded even at 9PM on a non-weekend night. Out of the four at my table, two ordered the four-course prix fixe menu while two did a la carte dining. Note that the tasting menus require the entire table. As to be expected from a Michael White restaurant, the pastas were my favorite parts of the meal. I got to try the blue crab spaghetti and Trofie Nero (squid ink pasta with a seafood ragu), both of which were spectacular. If I had to go for one, it'd be the spaghetti as I loved the kick from the chilies. And if I were to come back, it would be with a group that would agree to order the entire pasta menu with me and forgo everything else.This isn't to detract from the rest of the meal, which was fantastic. Other personal highlights included the veal chop (positively enormous) and the pecorino romano cake dessert. The rest of the table also seemed to really enjoy the duck and lobster bisque.As to be expected from a restaurant of this caliber, service was great - friendly and attentive, but not creepily attentive (looking at you Jean Georges). Will definitely add this restaurant to my go-to list!",4,3,3,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",435,332,543

2.0,11/26/2017,"Super disappointing.  Attended the Ai Fiori Thanksgiving 4 course meal because the menu looked fantastic online!  Our first course was so incredibly disappointing.  We had the lobster veulote with truffles.. it sucked.  It basically tasted like lobster flavored buttery water.. the consistency was salty, watery and the truffle mentioned on the menu.. was simply truffle oil drizzled on top.   NOT IMPRESSED.  I didn't even finish it, and I was starving.  Neither did my husband.  My Mom got the salad for her first course and she was very happy. Second, we had the Agnolotti with braised veal parcels, crispy sunchokes, beech mushrooms and THIS WAS EXCEPTIONAL.  Absolutely every bite, was perfection and the juicy sweet, savory, delicious combination of epic perfection dazzled our mouths.  However, this was served luke warm.. maybe room temperature at best and in a cold bowl.  Despite the amazing marvel of tastes in my mouth and all the compliments on this dish around our Thanksgiving table.. I cannot believe they served this to us luke warm at best.  I was still disappointed... but at least a little more full.    For the mains, my Mother and husband both ordered steak and were extremely happy.  I instead ordered the turkey dish.. and AGAIN, the dish was cold, the turkey was dry at best, and the sides were not warm and were sparse!  I actually was so annoyed, I sent the dish back to be reheated.  When it came back, it was still subpar, a touch warmer and simply edible, but certainly not tasty.  We had excellent desserts, paid a $500 bill, and I left disappointed and not full.  Terrible execution by a restaurant that I usually rave about.  I will not be coming back any time soon, nor will any of my clients.  I would have given them one star, except that I've been before and it was an excellent dining experience on previous occasions.",0,0,0,Kimia M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,0

My sister, brother in law, and I went here to celebrate my white coat (induction into Dr profession) and boy what a celebration it was.We each ordered the prefix menu that comes with an appetizer, pasta, main course, and dessert. We ordered the octopus appetizer, lobster soup, and foie gras. All were amazing but the octopus stole the show for me personally. For the pasta we ordered the Agnolotti, Cavatelli, and the Risotto. All were great but my favorite was the Cavatelli. For the main course we ordered the halibut, the duck, and the dry aged strip loin. The duck was excellent and the crusted almonds on top really gave the wow factor. I highly recommend it. Lastly for dessert, we ordered the tiramisu, Crostata Di frutta, and the Torta di Pecorino Romano. My favorite was the Torta di Pecorino Romano however my sister and brother in law loved the Crostata di frutta. All were so tasty and well portioned.

5.0,11/8/2017,"Ai Fiori has become a staple on my list of recommendations when friends ask for a nice, upscale venue that won't break your wallet. Although its sister restaurant Marea boasts two Michelin stars, I've found the food at Ai Fiori complex, inviting, and most importantly - more consistent.Located on the second floor of Langham Place, Ai Fiori has an air of sophistication without coming off as pretentious. The main dining area is a fairly large open area, with tables near grand windows that overlook Fifth Avenue. If you can, try and request one of these tables, as the view of the crowds of people on weekend nights can actually be quite nice. If these tables aren't available, you can opt to sit at the lounge area, where you'll still be able to experience the full dining experience, unlike other restaurants where you're limited to small plates and drinks.I've always chosen to go with the Prix Fixe menu, where you select an Antipasti, Pasta, and Carne/Pesce dish for your three main courses, with your choice of dessert.Of the options for the Antipasti course, I usually go with either the foie gras ($6 supplement), the lobster soup, or the octopus. The foie gras is unoffensive, while the strawberries and balsamic perfectly complement the otherwise savoriness of the dish. The lobster soup is more of an olfactory experience, with the thickness of lobster and truffles hitting the nose above all else. The tarragon, however, lifts the dish to a whole new level. The octopus, while good, is at times not as tender as it could be.As many other reviews have already pointed out, the winner within the pasta section has to the Trofie Nero. The scallops sprinkled in add another layer of flavor, while the mollica rounds out the course by providing a satisfying crunch to every bite.For the main entree, although the scallops won me over the first time I ate here, the Long Island Duck has since stolen my heart. I could've sworn this dish came with foie gras as well, but the last time I went, it no longer had the slab of liver on it. Still, it was as good (and filling) as ever, so I can't complain too much.For the dessert (and perhaps my favorite) course, if you're fortunate to have the passionfruit meringue in rotation, I highly suggest getting that. Aesthetically, it's one of the most beautiful dishes you'll ever see (imagine the winter wonderland you've always dreamed of), with an intense flavor to boot. If unavailable, the hazelnut mousse is still a very good, rich option that won't leave you disappointed.This has been a restaurant that I've been going to for all types of occasions - celebrations, casual dinners, reunions - and I don't foresee this changing in the near future. With great food and an extensive wine list that carries some of the best Tuscan bottles I've ever had, Ai Fiori is an experience truly worthy of a Michelin star.",3,3,3,Dan C.,"Manhattan, NY",24,128,24

It was mediocre at best - from service to food to everything else, including bathrooms. Took forever for them to take our order. We had the four course tasting menu. Panna cotta was flavourless and shrimp was underdone, and lobster soup was too liquidy. My friends Spaghetti was ok, but my risotto was lacking seasoning. The bread they served was hard as rocks and not warm. My friend's lobster Main course had a weird texture (we think it was likely undercooked) and my steak was not good at all. It was cold and although it had a lot of flavour it almost tasted a little too flavourful - like they overdid with seasoning.Chocolate mousse and pecorino cake - also disappointing! Never once after each course did the server ask how we enjoyed our courses even do each time there was a lot left on our plates. Should have been an indication to him that things were definitely not going well. Although there many servers milling about the restaurant we didn't feel like they paid enough attention to us as we had to ask someone to refill our wine and bring us bread.

I'll have to say that the presentation of each dish was on point and photo-worthy.+ First Course: We went with the Crudo di Passera and Torchon. The crudo (was a little salty but the fluke was tender and melted in my mouth. The torchon was flavorful and they were more than happy to provide us with additional brioche for the foie gras (which had the most perfect creamy texture to it!)+ Second Course: I had the spaghetti and my husband went with the risotto.

Our favorite thing to do is go out for dinner and had spent the weekend exploring many different cuisines at amazing restaurants around New York. Everything about this place was disappointing. We were sat next to a family with two small children. Although they were close to being finished, the family lingered from when we arrived at 8 until 9:30 while their kids ran circles around the table. It was so awful, although the alternative are tables inches from other couples...hardly a romantic atmosphere like we were led to believe.The wait staff seemed confused, we were asked multiple times which water we wanted, if we had ordered wine, offering to take our order when we had already ordered drinks. We started with a half bottle of champagne, and asked for a recommendation for a wine that paired with our meal. Before we could order the waitress asked my boyfriend how much he wanted to spend on the bottle (we're close but thats just awkward), then ran away to ask the sommelier. The sommelier come back over and recommended a bottle that was well below what we intended to spend and was a white when we had discussed having steaks.We were in between anyways so we just went ahead and ordered seafood when the waitress came around again. We had the prix fix four course menu. We both started with the soup, immediately surprised at the luke warm temperature. It was good, slightly salty, and cold within minutes. I had pasta for my second course, spaghetti with crab meat. I had several pieces of sharp crab shell in mine. My entree was the halibut which was just plain. I ate half and left the rest on my plate. Dessert was OK, but honestly everything was just a joke at this point.Luckily my company had rewarded me with a $250 ""dinner for 2"" on the company card, so we used that to pay for half of the meal. There was no way this was worth the $500 bill.",0,0,0,Elizabeth C.,"Highland Village, Houston, TX",0,13,1
4.0,9/5/2017,Food is amazing. Seats are big and comfortable. Stuff were really nice specially they will recommend wine in different level. Sometime you will feel pressure when wine specialist recommend something extremely expensive right away. But you won't find it here. They will talk to you what is what and what match with what dish.

3.0,9/5/2017,"Came for my birthday during Restaurant Week in August 2017 and was just not impressed, especially considering this place has one star. Started with the red juice, which was great; the cold seafood app was nothing too special. Same with the salmon and zucchini - the fish was even a little dry. The truffle risotto was delicious but didn't blow me away. Chocolate dessert was the best part. The thing that disappointed me the most was that they brought the appetizers while I was in the bathroom. Not cool.",1,0,0,Gab G.,"New York, NY",208,1651,5011
4.0,9/4/2017,"Fifth Avenue probably has the most diversity of anything that runs North-South in New York.  Ai Fiori is in the most boring stretch of the avenue, sitting quietly inside the Langham Place Hotel, and trafficked by a predictable mix of midtown white collars, out-of-towners and New Yorkers who find themselves in this part of town, generally not by choice.You enter Ai Fiori through the hotel doors, and walk up an elegant spiral staircase to the restaurant on the second floor.  The space is large but is occupied to capacity during the busy hours of breakfast, lunch and dinner, especially on weekdays.  I have been here for work and personal meals and, while there is nothing very memorable or remarkable about Ai Fiori (relative to Del Posto or Daniel, for example), it consistently delivers great service and good food in a plush setting.At a recent dinner, i started with the risotto, which was well done, although the hint of saffron was overpowered by the parmigiano.  The Torta di Ceci was a good choice--it is simply fried chickpea fritters.  Accompanied in this case by beet and english peas.  The restaurant is quite accommodating with substitutions and, if you like something on the menu but not one of the ingredients, it is best to ask.  For dessert, I have tried the panna cotta and the sponge cake.  But my favorite here is the chocolate mousse with caramel and hazelnut gelato.Ai Fiori is definitely fine dining and priced for business meetings and special occasions.  If you are stuck working in this part of town, indulge here occasionally to beat the monotony of life in midtown west.",10,7,8,Srini V.,"Manhattan, NY",467,463,97

4.0,8/21/2017,"I came here for a birthday lunch with my best friend earlier this month. They were very courteous and seated us fairly quickly when my friend arrived. So let me backtrack a little first actually. I got here before my friend and was fairly surprised as to where the restaurant was. Me, being a tad bit slow hadn't realized it was on the second floor and walked around before I mustered up the courage to walk in and discover it's actually up there.Now, when my friend and I were seated, we were given water and menus. After mulling over the restaurant menu options, we have decided our course. I had the salad (since I was allergic to shrimp, couldn't have the insalata di mare) while my friend had the insalata di mare (I WAS INSTANTLY JEALOUS because I loved scallops!!). For our main course, we chose the salmone and the chicken. And as for dessert, we both opted for the dark chocolate ganache. For drinks, he had a cocktail that I can't recall the name of while I had the red drink which consisted of beets and ginger (plus other stuff). Before we were served our food, we were offered butter and bread which is good. When my salad arrived, I didn't expect it to be artistic but I also didn't imagine it just tossed onto a plate. I feel like I had a good laugh at my salad. I suppose restaurant week frenzy for the chefs just makes them toss a salad onto a plate with leaves and other stuff scattered. It was just a regular salad at a Michelin starred restaurant. Next came our entrees of chicken (which I remembered wasn't dry so that's definitely great!) and my salmon. My salmon came with some summer veggies and I don't remember which but one was slightly bitter. I'm not fond of bitter but it was okay. My salmon was also cooked perfectly. But my most anticipated was definitely the dessert. And let's just say, chocolate heaven! at the end, they even gave us a complimentary dessert card so we can come back after restaurant week!Oh, I almost forgot. As an adamant disliker of ginger products -- the drink grew on me (which surprised me). Originally, I felt that it was super gingery (and yes, I know! there's ginger but BEETS ARE SO GOOD.I couldn't help but order it) but after some time, the taste definitely grew on me. It was a good combination and if I went back, I would definitely get it again.",2,1,4,Jenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",194,355,413

I made a 11:30a Friday reservation for 3, and the restaurant never got full throughout the time we were there, which means that walk-in is totally possible despite the lack of availabilities on Open Table. Service was definitely superb - the waiters always know when you're done with your dish, and they would show up within 2 minutes after you're done. This restaurant week, I got the insalata di mare, pretty much a non-chopped up cerviche with less citrus flavor. For the main, I got the tagliatelle with oyster mushroom and kale, and I could've made this at home. For dessert, I got Panna Cotta, and it tasted like a light mango pudding with grapefruit on top.

4.0,8/7/2017,"My friend and I made plans for dinner at Ai Fiori and went for the very reasonable four course prix fixe meal for $99. The walk up the stairs from the lobby of the Setai Hotel is one way for guests to make an entrance, but it did set up the ambience and decor you would expect.I expected Ai Fiori to be about the pasta, which of course is one of four courses in the prix fixe. There was no doubt the Trofie Nero is the star, and both my friend and I decided on that particular dish. I have never met a squid ink pasta I didn't like, and this one was good, albeit different from the ones I have had elsewhere both in New York and from the Mediterranean. I guess I prefer the squid ink in the sauce, but Ai Fiori's take was definitely still tasty.As for the rest of dinner, I opted for the moleche soft shell crab antipasti, which is another dish on which I simply cannot find something bad to say. The basil pesto worked great with the crab, in addition to some beans, capers, and tomatoes. For the main dish, both of us got the butter poached lobster. Unfortunately the lobster disappointed, tasting direly underseasoned compared to our previous dishes though well cooked and plated. Fortunately, my panna cotta dessert redeemed the meal somewhat.Ai Fiori is a solid option in Midtown for pasta, though its sister restaurant Marea is more applauded and deservingly so. The prix fixe menu comes at an approachable price point, but you have to careful with your choices so I would advise you do some research before ordering.

To be quite honest, because of the amazing reviews online, I did attend with a hightened sense of expectancy in terms of the service.The facility is nicely decorated, very elegant. From the moment you enter the building and ascend the stairs, there is this feeling that those reviews you read online are the real deal. The staff is incredibly welcoming and attentive. Deal breaker: The table that I was sitting in, did not have the center piece [the dark tinted cup with the flowers]. I know you must be rolling your eyes at this. But to me, presentation is key. Appetizer: I ordered the Insalata di Mare. I liked the way it was presented, the dish exuded simplicity. The endive as placed neatly on the side, it was colored rose and it complemented the shrimp. It was seasoned lightly with lemon and olive oil. The portion size was adequate. Key words to descibe the dish: tender, fresh, light and definitely worth it. Entrée: I ordered the Salmone. Steer clear, no bueno. It was bland, tasteless and boring. The way the salmon was cooked was unoriginal, definitely not a 5 star rating. You can get better salmon elsewhere. The whole dish was just disappointing. I didn't finish it. Desert: I ordered the Panna Cotta. Exquisite. It's sweet, sour [citric] and nutty. Little cup of goodness. The vanilla panna cotta sets the base whilst the mandarin, almond and granite give it that burst of flavor. Price: $29.00 + 8.00 (still water) + taxes Total aprox $40.00 sans the tipWill I go back?

2.0,7/27/2017,"Apparently, Michelin is playing fast and loose with its ratings these days.  I had been told by an out-of-towner that this was an excellent restaurant.  Note to self - don't take New York restaurant recommendations from non-New Yorkers.  I suppose I now understand why this restaurant, located in the 30s on 5th Avenue has any following at all - it's full of tourists.  I guess the fact that it's in an utterly charmless hotel should have been the giveaway.  This is like an emperor's new clothes situation.  No one wants to say that this is simply bad food served in an even worse atmosphere.  So much for celebrity chefs.  It seems that any crazy combination of flavors crapped out by a celebrity chef can be passed off as brilliant cuisine.  The best part of the meal was the bread.  My soft shell crab appetizer was simply deep fried and dropped on some wilted lettuce.  The agnoletti was dripping with oil and a bizarre sauce containing more incongruous flavors than I care to remember.  It tasted as if several recipes from different countries were accidentally scrambled together.  This is not good food.  It is what someone who knows nothing of good food might imagine good food should look and taste like - someone who thinks the food in airline first class is truly haute cuisine.  And, by the way, while friendly, the service is also misguided - it felt as if they had been brainwashed into believing that they were serving golden nuggets that diners should feel somehow privileged to eat.  Not professional and really lacking.  Again, the kind of service that is acceptable to tourists, not New Yorkers.  Skip this one.",1,0,0,Ethan A.,"New York, NY",0,6,0

We were first attracted to Ai Fiori because of its Michelin star and were happy to find that it lived up to all our expectations. We were 10 minutes late to our reservation, but the staff was friendly and understanding and it wasn't a problem at all. The decor of Ai Fiori is simple and classy, nothing to write home about, but the service and food were the main stars of our experience.

The cocktail was the perfect pre-dinner drink on such a hot and humid night - light, refreshing and not too sweet. For the antipati, I went with the lobster soup which the waiter poured out over the lobster in front of us. It was piping hot and to die for - definitely the best lobster soup I've ever had. For the second course, I had the risotto, which was creamy and delicious, and for the third I went with the lamb, which I finished even though I was stuffed because it was so tender and tasted so good. For dessert, I opted for the Meringa and the suggested dessert wine pairing. Not only did our final course taste amazing (the basil and strawberry on the Meringa was a fantastic combo), but we were also pleasantly surprised when each of our desserts came out with a chocolate ""Congratulations!"" sign.

3.0,7/6/2017,"Came for French restaurant week, which is a new concept (it seems), and takes place 2+/- weeks around bastille day. I opted for the $39 pre fixe lunch, which came out to be about $46 after tax and tip.For the pre fixe, you get to choose between three appetizers, two entrees, and two desserts. You obviously get served bread as well before your meal. The first thing I got, the terrine, was essentially a glorified piece of spam. Sure, it was very good, but I mean that's what it really is, right? Spiced ham? I will say I was pleasantly surprised.I've actually had bouillabaisse in the south of France before (in fact, quite recently!) and I honestly felt the dish was better here. I ordered it in fond memory of what I tried in the past, and found that it didn't deviate significantly, except maybe for the fact that the soup was more salty than I remember, and the seafood was perhaps fresher. Some might object to a dish so salty, but honestly I enjoy strong flavors, and equipped with water to wash it down, as well as as some rice cracker thingies served with the stew to help it go down easier, and this was easily the best thing I've eaten in a while. The seafood in the dish was all very good.For my dessert, I chose the red wine sorbet (served with two cookie like things), which was pretty run of the mill. Pretty good, but nothing special.I was particularly impressed with the bussers here as well. I suppose this is the kind of thing that separates the wheat from the chaff, as the bussers were incredibly polite, very meticulous in their tidying up of the table, and did it super quick and professionally.There are problems with this place of course. For starters, it isn't really much food. I ate a late breakfast so I was fine, but I could totally see myself coming away from this lunch still hungry had I not. My recommendation to Ai Fiori is perhaps serve a few more rice crackers (or whatever they were), and throw in a little more soup.Furthermore, we didn't exactly feel like the waiting service was the best (service by Logan B, courtesy of my receipt). We were presented the menu and got the whole song and dance about the wine list when we came in, but we actually had to ask about the restaurant week pre fixe menu ourselves before our waiter told us about it. I also overheard the waiter fail to mention it to the table next to ours as well. I understand that restaurants don't like restaurant week, but if you're going to participate, you ought to at least mention it to your patrons, instead of hoping they don't know about the event and don't bring it up. To clarify, the bouillabaisse specifically was excellent, and I do see myself perhaps coming back to Ai Fiori, but I'm not sure I'd keep it in my regular lineup.",6,1,2,Matt L.,"New York, NY",108,694,604
2.0,7/6/2017,"We came here for lunch during French Restaurant Week and found ourselves disappointed at almost every turn .  For a Michelin one-star rated restaurant we expected more than just an ordinary experience.  Here are the details:1- The decor of the dining room had all the charm of a business lounge at JFK. The bar area, in contrast, was beautifully furnished.2- The service from our waiter was only just OK- hardly the quality of service one would expect in a highly rated super-expensive place. We had to ask for the French Restaurant Week menus rather than being handed them at the start. It felt as if the waiter or  restaurant policy would rather have us order off the usual very expensive menu rather than the Restaurant Week menu.  Then why participate in Restaurant Week, if this is the case?The waiter rarely checked in with us to see if our meal was OK or if we needed anything.  We had to ask for seconds of bread rather than being offered more bread.3- the bread was cold and ordinary.4- Except for the wonderful dessert I had of dark chocolate mousse, berry consomme, and raspberry, everything else we had was really quite average tasting. 5- It was almost comical to have such tiny portions served in gigantic white bowls.  Did Ai Fiori really want to advertise how stingy their portions are? The cold onion soup was good but why so little? Worst was the Bouillabaisse- one scallop, mussel,  one clam, one shrimp, and 2 tiny potatoes in a tiny amount of broth.  Never have we seen anything like this!Given the amazing meal with generous portions we had the day before at Vaucluse, we suggest that Ai Fiori hand over its Michelin star to the real deserving winner!This meal was definitely not worth the $82 we paid before tip!",4,1,2,Rima F.,"New York, NY",181,439,14
1.0,7/6/2017,"Staying the Langham Place hotel we tried the bar and while the drinks were ok the server tried to pad the bill with $16 bar pecans. Be careful with this. She quickly took it off when we asked her but the 18% tip stayed so we ended up paying $2.88 additional to the server. The next morning instead of room service which was not very good we went upstairs and asked about taking out some pastries since we had a breakfast credit. The hostess was not even aware they could do takeout. The Maître D' came over and told us it was no problem. We asked if it was the same food as the room service and he said it was not. He said he could put together a pastry basket. It sounded good and we also ordered 2 orange juice $10 each. We got the ""basket"" with 4 tiny breads and asked for more because we were 4 people. They came back with 1 more ""basket"" with 4 more tiny breads. No jams, no butter, nothing. $60 later we get up to the room and these were the driest poorest excuses of breads, danish, whatever you want to call these that we have ever had. I am just glad that it was ""free"". Still paid $800 per night for our stay and glad the hotel was on point. I would stay at the hotel again but would not touch the food.

First, the space feels like a hotel restaurant which I found to be such a contrast from the warmth of other MW venues. Second, the service...I expect more from a Michelin-starred restaurant. To begin, we were greeted at the table by the hostess with ""welcome ladies"". My dining companion (boyfriend) has a beard. Okay, so maybe they saw him from the back and assumed since he has shoulder-length hair that he was a woman. The greeter apologized and ran off. We sat for extended periods of time (once 15 minutes when we were clearly done) without asking if there was anything we needed. We also ordered sparkling water which was switched to tap halfway through the meal without asking. At the end of the meal we ordered coffee, specifically coffee upon request and were presented with and charged for cappuccinos. The waitstaff was prompt when we said that we had theater tickets and needed to get going. But otherwise, this is not what I have experienced or expect out of a fine dining experience.

The portions may seem small but towards the 5th course I was already full but I still managed to eat everything. We had the sommelier help us with wine selection to go with the tasting menu. We would've preferred a white since four out of the seven courses were seafood but the Pinot Noir he selected based on our tastes was delicious none the less. The first course was made up of three different tastings. Burrata, lobster salad crostini and an arancini. The second course was a pea purée. The third course was fluke topped with caviar in a lemon and olive oil drizzle. The fourth course was octopus topped with a Japanese eggplant purée. The fifth course was the blue crab spaghetti. The sixth course was lobster which melted in my mouth. The seventh course ended with a nice piece of steak. The seven courses was the followed by a cheese plate that I can't remember the name of and that was followed up with an intermezzo (palate cleanser). Then they brought out dessert.

The combination of food ingredients is off. For Example, the salad has pickled beets and radicchio making for a very bitter experience. The wine was served way too cold. The wine selection was limited. The service was very stiff and not very friendly.

5.0,5/14/2017,"My brother and I brought my mom to this restaurant for Mother's Day, and we had an amazing experience. Thanks to the fellow yelpers who reviewed the menu, we were able to order mostly the best dishes. We selected the 4 course option. For starters, we ordered polipo (octopus), torchon (foie gras), and Pancetta di Maiale (pork belly). All were delicious. The octopus was very tasty, the pork belly was tender, and the foie gras melted in your mouth. One note about the foie gras though--I didn't like to eat it without the bread they served it with (I don't remember what it was called?), but my brother thought it was great without the bread it well so it's up to preference. For pasta/risotto we had Trofie Nero (squid ink pasta) since it was heavily recommended by this community and the Agnolotti (veal). The Trofie Nero didn't disappoint, it was delicious and thoroughly enjoyed. I had the veal, and the portion was just right with tasty sauce. For the pesce/carne portion, we ordered Ippoglosso (halibut), Astice (lobster), and Tagliata (steak/loin). The Tagliata was honestly so/so, nothing too special. However, my brother said the Astice (lobster) was the best he ever had, and completely cleaned out his plate. The halibut was also perfectly cooked, and the vegetables/sauce were fresh and really brought out a spring-like flavor. There was one particular dessert out of the 3 we ordered that we were so glad we were able to try. We can't remember the name, but we are guessing that it's the Nocciolle mousse. It's the chocolate option that has a chocolate bridge on it (but was not the berry one). We highly recommend selecting that dessert.  The service we received was also perfect. There was a slight delay in getting a coffee, but besides that, it was perfect. They even charged my brother's phone, since it died and he needed it to navigate home afterwards. We have been to many restaurants for the past 2 weeks to celebrate my mom's birthday and Mother's Day, but this by far wins it all. We came in skeptical and came out extremely pleased and satisfied.

5.0,3/14/2017,I visited this establishment by myself one weekday afternoon during restaurant week. I choose this place because the pre-fixed menu had a nice variety. It's situated in a hotel. I had a reservation but still had to wait about 30 minutes. I'll chalk it up to restaurant week. The ambiance is lovely. I had a yukon soup with crème fraîche to start and braised short rib for my main. I was in heaven. The food and service is impeccable. I never felt alone or weird being by myself.

5.0,2/19/2017,"I write this review of my own free will, I was not bribed to write a good review. We found this restaurant with our Yelp search, and are so happy we found it... It was by far one of the most unique and exquisite restaurants we have ever be to, and. We Are foodies! Our highlights(everything we had was incredible, but the following dishes were out of this world):Trofie Nero- the menu doesn't do this dish justice, the pasta is a thick squid ink pasta, with a very inviting texture and unique flavor.  The seafood was perfect, the flavor profiles worked spectacularly well together, and provided a dish comparable to none other, it was exquisite!Agnello- we have had our fair share of lamb, one of our favorites.  This lamb was better than any other lamb we have ever had.  The crusting was flavorful, with the perfect texture, the lamb was prepared perfectly, and the quality of lamb was obviously the best one can get, it melted in our mouths.  We did the four course prix fixe, and we got to try each other dishes, again, everything was incredible!The wine list was out of this world, I would say, I did  wish it had more options under $100, there are plenty of great wines, to compliment amazing food at a lower price point.",0,0,0,Kim H.,"Williamsburg, VA",66,15,0

4.0,2/16/2017,"A wonderfully satisfying experience filled with flavor and textural contrast, Ai Fiori left us full and happy. Came here for restaurant week's pre fixe lunch. The ambiance is quiet and classy, with elaborately decorated tiles, well dressed waitstaff, and pictures of nature adorning the walls. The service was efficient and friendly. The appetizer salad was pleasant, with thick cut bitter winter greens, and a small sprinkling of pickled vegetables and sweet leaves for balance. It was topped with a small slice of mildly nutty manchego cheese. The salmon was divine and prepared extremely well. The lightly seasoned exterior was firmly crisp, encasing a flavor bomb of moist, tender, incredibly fresh salmon. The lentils on the bottom were slightly over al dente, with pieces of cauliflower, tomato, and olive laced in a slightly oniony sauce. The panna cotta was by far the highlight of the meal. The bitingly sour grapefruit flavored ice shavings married well with the crunchy shortcake crumbles and the delicately sweet panna cotta. The fresh fruit added another element of tangy sweetness. All in all, we had a great restaurant week experience here.

1.0,2/10/2017,"It's such an embarrassment to Michelin's value that this place has the Michelin stamp of approval for the past 3 years. After ""proving themselves,"" they must now be sitting back and relaxing, without any effort to maintain any prestigious value. The service is horrible, like the McDonald's for caviar; except the servers at McDonald's might have more manners because I can't imagine anything or anyone being more ill-mannered than the server we had. I've been to quite a few Italian restaurants around NYC, and one similar feature of 90% of them is the owners sit at the table and go over the menu for that particular night. Meanwhile at Ai Fiori, the waiter blows a huge gust of wind, huffing and puffing more than hurricane season in Florida, the moment I ask him a question about the menu for the night. It's surreal to not be able to ask the waiter questions about the menu, while restaurant owners are courteous enough to sit at the tables and speak of the menu at most family-owned Italian restaurants around NYC. We tipped the waiter at least 20% just to quarantine him at Ai Fiori, so I don't have to run into him working at any other restaurant around the city.

2.0,2/4/2017,"As fine dining and marea lovers, our party came in with high expectations of this Michael White ""Alta-Marea"" restaurant. We were escorted to our table with the usual Michelin charm and greeted by the waiter. Then things went awry.         We ordered a bottle of sparkling water and soon after all of our glasses were filled to the brim, one of the full glasses of sparkling water was soiled by tap from the bus boy. After retrieving a new glass for us, he soon filled it with our water. A whole 20oz. of top dollar water down the drain.         Next all of our harts stopped to the sound of shattering glass. A waiter dropped a tray full of glasses and the sound was deafening. After that one of my guests dropped his knife and no one even glanced at it.          Now the food came. The a mouse bouchée came around and it was this fantastic soup made from nuts. It was fantastic. Next was the appetizer my octopus was good and the flavors were fantastic, but the octopus was very tough and chewy. Not a favorite.         For an entree, myself along with my grandmother had the Dover sole at a relatively ok price. After being presented with the raw fish earlier on, I asked for the head and tail. This request was followed by a chuckle and a smirk. That has never been asked before?!?The sole was good and the sides were excellent.         For dessert, I did not like any of the choices so I went with the sorbet. A little tart for me. My mom got a sickly sweet tart and my grandmother got a sour foam. Dessert. Not. Good         Dessert was followed by a 45 minute wait for the check. This whole experience had made me lose a little bit of faith in the Michelin system. How a restaurant like with terrible service and good food should not be included in the tight knit exclusive community that is the Michelin star. I hope this was just because of Micheal White's good reputation in the restaurant community. Will not come back",2,1,0,Christopher P.,"Syosset, NY",3,57,44

Im not a fan of sea urchin but my girlfriend liked it.  The squid ink pasta was a little on the salty side. The blue crab spaghetti was the better of the pasta dishes. I loves the steak.  Probably in the top 5 best steaks I've ever had. Girlfriend was let down by the pan seared scallops. While good she had better elsewhere. She preferred the blue crab spaghetti.Solely on food I would give tis place a solid 4 stars.  They get an extra star for their service.  The head waiter was constantly walking around looking in on diners to make sure everything was just so.  The other waiters were also super attentive without being intrusive.  They brought out one dish at a time.

4.0,2/3/2017,"Somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. Here's my breakdown.The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful. Very elegant decor, and great ambiance. There are very nice aesthetic touches which any michelin star restaurant should have.Pros: EXCELLENT and attentive, personalized service. I took my mom out for her birthday, and she was wished happy birthday by the staff upon arrival, and upon leaving. Her dessert was brought in with a candle, and a ""happy birthday"" chocolate plaque. Very nice attention to detail, and a much appreciated gesture. The food was quite good, but fell slightly short of my expectations for a michelin star restaurant. Perhaps the rush of restaurant week diminished its overall quality. I had the potato leek soup, which was fantastic. Super smooth, rich, and seasoned perfectly. The tagliatelle was average. A bit overcooked and mushy. Disappointing for a Michael White led restaurant. The grated Parmesan was a mess--not evenly distributed, and a huge pile clumped on the side of the bowl not even on top of the pasta. The dessert was the highlight of the meal. Cons:We had a 1:45 res, and apparently so did half the city. The people came in like cattle. The front of the restaurant felt like we were waiting in line at an amusement park. I assume they overbooked, because we were seated around 15 minutes after our reservation. The drinks came out of order. My cocktail came about 5 minutes before my mom's wine. The waiter noticed, and brought her an empty wine glass, but it took minutes before it was filled. A bit awkward for a michelin star restaurant. Overall, I believe they were a bit rushed and forgetful because of restaurant week. It was still a fantastic meal and experience, but it's the little things. Decor: 9/10Food: 8/10Service: 9/10 for kindness and attentiveness; 7/10 if i factor in the late seating, and a few fumbles in service. overall 8.75/10",0,0,0,John D.,"Manhasset, NY",0,26,6

Solicitous and attentive (the bread service along hit us several time for re-ups).Restaurant Week menu was pretty safe but had the spicy tagliatelle (housemade pasta ribbons, spicy pomodoro, parmigiano...my wife was a fan) and my Daube (red wine braised short ribs, creamy polenta, glazed winter vegetables) was falling-off-the-bone tender--very satisfying. The Budino desser (dark chocolate ganache, chocolate sponge, malt, fior di latte) hit the spot.Dishes on the extended menu look ambitious and surprising, and Ai Fiori does a good job of showcasing their menu with the RW selections.

4.0,2/2/2017,"Me and my friend decided to try a Michelin starred restaurant out for Restaurant Week 2017. We went to Gotham Bar and Grill last year, and heard that if we liked that place, we'd really enjoy Ai Fiori.We each chose the $29 pre-fixe. I ordered the Potato and Leek Soup, Salmone, and the Chocolate Budino while my friend ordered the soup as well, the Spicy Pomodoro pasta, and also the Budino. While I enjoyed the soup (it was very light) I personally felt it needed a little more seasoning. However, the herb oil they had on the bottom of the bowl was astounding in flavor and I loved the preparation of the chip and the server pouring the soup right away. The salmone was my favorite part. I personally think my serving was smaller than the other dishes in the mains but it was quite delicious and I had never had such an amazing crispy skin and delectable fish. The lentils and puree with it were amazing as well, and had great flavor. The Budino is where me and my friend split, because I think she really enjoyed it, but I found it to be a little to normal. It was very well prepared and presented though, so enjoyed thatOverall, great quality food and delicious as well, but I'd hope that the restaurant would toe the line a little bit more with innovation, as I was hoping for something I wouldn't see on every American new restaurant week menu. I will say that the $10 cocktails and wine specials are amazing and my Gin punch was one of the best Gin drinks I've ever had.The service was exquisite, however, and I never felt ignored or had to wait long to get anything.

It's always the worst when you make a reservation somewhere and end up waiting anyways. The service during the meal is extremely attentive but FAR from over-bearing. Your courses are cleared within 30 seconds of you finishing them - they are really watching the tables closely but you never feel like they are watching you and you certainly do not feel rushed. Everything is also impeccably clean which is extremely important to me.

Crispy, crunchy, and not so much squid ink tastes. It was perfect. Tartalleta di ciacolate: layered chocolate cake with gelato and cocoa nibbles. I enjoyed the nibbles the most, and the cake is a little hard to dissect. Service: Not the best service I got compared to its competitive.

Even though the food was probably good, all I could remember of the dining was the horrible service with extreme long wait. After we were seated, it took at least 20 minute before someone came over to take out order. By that time, the table next to us, which were seated after us, already got their appetizer. While my companion went to the restroom, a waiter cam with bread for selections, and I asked him to come back after my companion return since I don't know what bread he might want. Of course the waiter never came back with bread, even after we asked again twice. Now something on the food:Sardina- 4/5- Despite the over powering sardine taste, I actually like this appetizer very much, that's if you like sardine of course.Trofie Nero- 3/5- good, but maybe not as good as everyone else says. The flavoring is not to strong, allowing you to taste the flavor of the noodles. A bit greasy though.Marubini- 3.5/5- I only had a bite; flavors were strong and good, quiet opposite as Trofoe Nero. Paris-Breast- 3/5- crunchy, but way too sweet for my personal tasteTar taletta di Cioccolato- 4.5/5- as a chocolate lover, I loved it! Not too sweet, just perfect! The smooth and crunch combination, mm... Good!The food portion was good for me, but my companion was still hungry afterwards. Yet, he didn't get his bread. The Trofie Nero was a bit greasy and overwhelming in the end so I asked to take it to go. After another 20 minutes, we were wondering if the waiter misheard me and tossed the food out, only to find out they gave the pick up token to the next table. We were just sitting at the ""forgotten"" table, took them very long to take our payment too. The table next to us arrived after us and must have left more than half hour before we could leave.

2.0,12/26/2016,"After a whirlwind weekend of life-changing dinners, and as great fans of Marea, our party of six looked forward to ending it on a positive note at Ai Fiori. Sadly, that wasn't the case. I left wondering how in the world it is possible that this restaurant has a Michelin star. Mediocre service can be expected at the Cheesecake Factory, but not here. Not at this level of dining and not with these accolades. Our weekend of intense dining in the city only magnified the shortcomings. True, the Michelin guide does not officially rate for service, but I highly doubt any inspector would have ignored the mishaps. How to ruin what would have otherwise been an unforgettable dinner? This way.Arriving early before the rest of our party, my husband and I sat in the bar area and ordered a round of drinks. Service here delivered as expected, professional in every way. While we waited, we checked in our coats and turned in several bottles of wine we brought. The gentleman who took them asked if we'd like those decanted. ""Yes please,"" we answered. We requested the corks be kept for us as well.Once the rest of our party arrived, we moved to the exquisitely decorated main dining room. Our table had a street view facing the festively lit trees outside. After a bit of a wait, someone finally came by and asked if we'd had a chance to look over the menu. No welcome. No introduction. Basically, let's just take your order and get this going. After she went around the table for what seemed like forever, we inquired about our wine. You know, the one we checked in about an hour ago? Finally, the sommelier (or someone like him) came by. Apparently, he had no idea we had checked them in and even less that we'd requested they be decanted.After more waiting, a single wine decanter arrived, and we were told the other two were somewhere else...out of sight. After the wine was individually poured, that first decanter (and accompanying wine ring on the tablecloth) remained on the table instead of removed. At that time, I requested one of the empty bottles of wine for a quick photo. That request received a blank stare and pursed lips. How dare I ask such a thing? The bottle was delivered minutes later with the same gracefulness as that of one passing a baton at a relay race. Actually, worse. The sommelier walked by our table quickly and literally placed the bottle at the table's center leaving my reaching arm hanging mid-air, followed by his stomping off without ever making any eye contact. Who did we piss off? Confused.When the amuse bouche arrived, the first waiter started to describe it and the second one interrupted him to explain it loudly himself. This seemingly annoyed the first waiter,  while we all sat there watching. We never really saw the waitress who initially took our order again until dessert. At least most dishes were served with the usual ease expected of a Michelin rated establishment. Except for the time they served my hot soup while I was in the bathroom. Nice. Couldn't they wait? The lamb course I ordered was a little rare for my taste, and I requested it please be cooked a bit more. They happily took it back, but then it came back out when everyone was done eating. Awesome. When our waitress reappeared, we ordered dessert. Another waitress, however, came back out to say that they'd run out of four of the six desserts. Lovely. The original waitress disappeared, never to be seen again. Ultimately, a gentleman in a suit (we'd never seen before) brought out the bill. Remember the corks request? The sommelier unapologetically insisted he was never told to save them and they'd been tossed. In fact, it felt like a scolding. Great. Honestly, we all felt like there'd been some kind of restaurant staff shakeup before our arrival. Something was definitively amiss, and we happened to be caught in the crossfire.We'd planned to have a round of drinks at the bar, with a couple of friends who were meeting us there, once dinner finished. When we asked upon arrival, our bartender stated ""...the last call at 11:30 pm.​"" When our friends arrived (a bit before 11 pm), they were told the bar was closed. Thankfully, the first bartender reappeared and offered to extend her offer and allow us to have the promised round of drinks with our visiting friends.Instead of a joyous night, dinner felt combative and pressured. The food was on point and delicious, but our party found it hard to focus on it with the staff drama continually surrounding us. With so many options in New York City and after our otherwise stellar weekend, there's no way I would ever go out of my way to dine at Ai Fiori again.",13,6,4,Brenda P.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",303,715,13511
5.0,12/26/2016,"What an outstanding mean and all-around dining experience. My wife and I wanted to go out for a Christmas day dinner and many nice restaurants are closed. Ai Fiori was open and was running a Christmas menu plus tasting menu selection. We got a reservation in advance...From walking into the restaurant to sitting at the table - it is pure class. Service is excellent and attentive. Atmosphere is beautiful - classy and romantic without being overbearing.Food was top notch. I enjoy good restaurants and Ai Fiori blew me away. Every course was outstanding. Rack of lamb was among best I've had, and duck ravioli in foie-gras butter was decadent. Waiters and sommelier were knowledgeable and accommodating.Overall we had an outstanding experience and both walked out extremely happy. Walking around midtown (Christmas around 5th ave and Rock Center is always fun) for the next few hours we kept raving how great the restaurant was. Well worth a visit.

2.0,12/22/2016,"Dinner for 2.  Due to its similarity to Marea, I'll keep score below based on similar dishes I've had at Marea.  - Ambiance (5/5) - Tie Marea 0 - Ai Fiori 0Very cozy atmosphere, tables, and chairs.  Nice decor.  Loved the extra bit of light on each table, so you could see what you were eating.- Service (2/5) - Marea 1 - Ai Fiori 0The bread and water guys were doing most of the work.  Our server ""Jon K"" was terrible.  After we got menus, it took about 15 minutes before anyone else showed up- and not Jon- but our hostess who hurried over to take our order.  Not once did he come back to ask us about our food.  My wife's appetizer, which clearly needed a spoon did not come with one.  We had to flag down- wait for it- one of the bread guys to get a spoon.  Long wait between end of entree and dessert menu as well.  Considering the level of restaurant, this was just a total lack of care.  - Bread (3/5) - Marea 2 - Ai Fiori 0There was nothing wrong with the bread, but for a fancy 1 Michelin star restaurant, I expect great bread.  I had a rather uninspiring, cold, roll.  - Amuse Bouche, Parsnip Puree (2/5)Found this to be a bit grainy with a strange aftertaste.- 4 course prix fixe, $99- Insalata Astice (2/5) - Marea 3 - Ai Fiori 0This was a miss for me.  The lobster was overcooked and a bit rubbery.  And, this wasn't really a salad- more lobster pieces with vegetable garnishes.  I understand the minimalist presentation, but if you're going to go heavy with the lobster (more lobster is appreciated), then the lobster better be otherworldly.  - Trofie Nero (1/5) - Marea 4 - Ai Fiori 0Unless there's a version of trofie I'm unaware of (in which case I'll revisit this review), this was not trofie.  Trofie, my favorite pasta, comes in little rolled pieces, not long twirly strands.  This disappointment aside, I wanted to enjoy it, but couldn't.  It wasn't particularly al dente.  The sauce was not balanced.  And the base was pretty oily.  Major disappointment.- Spada (3/5) - Tie Marea 4 - Ai Fiori 0Olive poached swordfish was quite delicate.  While I appreciate a medium to med-rare preparation, this really toed the line on undercooked.  The accompaniments while decent, did not complement the fish.  Overall, probably the better part of the meal but pretty ordinary.- Torta al Formaggio (3/5) - Marea 4 - Ai Fiori 1The cheesecake was delicate and flavorful.  The acid from the pear sorbet was a good complement to the cheesecake, though this dish sorely needed another tart sauce of some kind.  The poached apples/pear helped a little bit but ultimately didn't do enough to stand up to the cheesecake.  Beautiful presentation though.- Value (2/5) - Marea 5 - Ai Fiori 1On its face, $99 for 4 courses (same at Marea) is quite reasonable.  But, there was nothing remotely interesting about the dishes I ordered, and a couple of them fell on their faces.  The service is awful, and altogether, I would say definitively, there is a severe problem with the value.- Final WordWe noted all the similarities to Marea without realizing they are both part of the same restaurant group.  Ai Fiori is not at all in the same league as Marea and frankly speaking, I'm shocked it has a Michelin star.  Ai Fiori, which came after Marea in the group, clearly seems like the kid down the street who was adopted into the family as an honorary member.  Final Score: Marea 5 - Ai Fiori 1.  Marea is the winner, hands down.  Thank God I'm eating at Marea in 2 days.",6,0,0,Jeff J.,"San Jose, CA",224,495,227
1.0,12/17/2016,"We came here on a friend's recommendation. What can be said... except that we can no longer be friends. If it were possible to give a review with zero stars, I would. As I'm forced to give this one star, I must make it clear that it's only for the small arancini at the beginning of our seven course meal, which as decent as it was... it was unable to make up for the uncooked fish, overcooked lamb (looks are deceiving--the top was bloody, but sawing into it beyond that was near impossible), and the spaghetti which I was told was made ""in-house"".... I should've asked which hotel patron's child I could thank for it. The first warning sign was when our waitress asked for our drink order without ever having given us any menu nevermind a drink menu. When we asked if the tasting menus had a wine pairing option (unlisted), she responded, ""Yes. It's fun! They give you small glasses of wine to go with each course."" Not sure what made her think we would ask for a wine pairing if we didn't know what a wine pairing even is, but the condescension really brought the spice that the food wouldn't. (Also... ""fun""? Did she think that we had just come from the McDonald's PlayPlace? This might also explain how textureless everything was.... Perhaps the chef was under the impression that we didn't have our ""grown-up teeth"" in yet.) We would be thankful later that she had lied, and the sommelier actually had the heaviest hand possible.... One has to wonder if he was matching us glass for glass as he struggled to even read descriptions off of labels. Although I suppose she was right about one thing, it was fun hearing him say ""2014"" while pointing to the label which clearly read ""2015."" The meal concluded with compliments from the pastry chef... a ""spicy"" peach square and milk chocolate truffle. Needless to say, the peach square made me regret having been born with functioning tastebuds. I've never been so offended by a ""compliment."" (Believe me, my puns are in much better taste than anything served at this restaurant). Two weeks ago, I got food poisoning on my birthday, but I forgave the restaurant because the food was truly fantastic (even went so far as to rave about the experience to my friends); it was worth the two hours I spent with my face on the toilet seat. Last week, I had a waiter refer to my boyfriend and me as ""young people"" after making us wait 20 minutes after our reservation to be seated, but we forgot all about it once we took our first bite. Ai Fiori has me writing my first ever review because it truly has no redeeming qualities. The only thing that makes sense about this place is that ""Ai Fiori"" means ""to the flowers"" as eating there made me feel like I would soon be ""pushing up daisies."" To be fair, I hear that $500 is cheap for a funeral.",2,1,0,Yimei S.,"New York, NY",277,11,1

4.0,11/16/2016,"Recently went to Ai Fiori as a party of 4 for their 7 course tasting menu ($150pp).  Ai Fiori recently announced they kept their Michelin Star for 2017 and the food is by far good enough to be there, the service, decor and attention to detail is definitely what is keeping them from more.The first course was a chilled cauliflower puree with diced cauliflower and brown butter, although it had great flavor the puree could have used a touch more seasoning and the brown butter was lost all together, it might have done better as a room temperature or even warmed dish. 7/10Second was a lobster salad, essentially lobster, sunchoke puree, roasted sunchoke and some frisee and radicchio.  This dish in my opinion was completely overpowered by the vinegar and they mention brown butter in the description and again it was just completely lost which is a shame because it would have balanced out the acid perfectly and really brought out the lobster flavor. 6/10Third was the best dish in my opinion of the entire night, octopus with sweet potato caponata, sweet potato puree and brown butter.  Where here the brown butter was again lost it didn't matter the octopus was perfectly tender and the sweet potato caponata with pine nuts and cherries was probably one of the top 3 things I have ever tasted and although the octopus was delicious with it as a composed dish it played second fiddle for sure, perfect acid from the cherries and the texture and buttery flavor from the pine nuts all working with the roasted flavor and sweetness from the sweet potato was nothing short of perfection. 10/10Fourth course was one of Michael White's signature dishes, homemade spaghetti and blue crab, this iteration included chiles, lemon and bottarga (def three of my favorite ingredients).  The pasta was flawless perfect chew and good flavor, could have used a touch more crab to be honest but the heat in this dish is what made it really sing, just the right amount of chile to let you know it is there and warm you up but it didn't blow your head off by any means and bottarga on any pasta just makes it better. 9/10Fifth was was another signature dish from White, his butter poached lobster, this one having cipollini onions and black trumpet mushrooms.  Starting off this was the most sublimely cooked lobster I've ever had.  The mushrooms added a nice earthiness to the dish and cipollini are good no matter how they are served and added a nice crunch and texture to an otherwise soft dish. 9/10Sixth was our final savory dish of the night long island duck glazed with honey and hazelnuts with charred leeks and orange, braised lettuce and seared foie gras.  The duck was immaculate a perfect pink all the way through with crispy skin and just the right amount of fat, the leek however was definitely tough, to the point I couldn't really even cut it with my knife, the orange was simply orange the charring didn't add much but aesthetically looked nice, the braised lettuce was actually delicious and had a really interesting chewy texture I loved but the foie gras made this dish all worth while a spotless light pink in the middle with a dark sear on the outside it is the best foie I have tasted it lacked that strong liver flavor and simply tasted like unctuous duck butter. 7/10 (would have been an 8 if the leek wasn't so tough)Seventh was a simple cheese course but still delicious, an aged goat cheese with mustard tops, pecans and a bacon jam.  Really good for what it was but at the end of the day the cheese maker deserved more credit than the chef.  7/10Eighth is when they broke out the pallet cleanser but it was a nice riff on it for sure not just your simple sorbet they put some effort and thought into it and made it a course of the meal instead of an oh here you go before dessert after thought.  The apple cider foam was particularly nice dense looking but once you ate it, it simply disappeared leaving a super light less sweet cider flavor i loved.  7/10 (it is just sorbet after all).And finally this brings us to dessert where the pastry chef absolutely knocked it out of the park, perfect doesn't do this combination justice godly would be more fitting.  Their take on a budino with a combination of espresso, dark chocolate, caramel and coffee was the best dessert I've ever had and doubt I will be having one better any time soon, again god like nothing else to say. 12/10The overall experience was good but not spectacular the waitress was just nice enough to not complain but seemed frustrated when we didn't take her wine suggestions, and no we were actually ordering more expensive.  Little things like marks on plates and finger prints all over light fixtures mixed with the ""on par"" service is why they still have one star this year but it is a hotel restaurant after all.  Step the service and decor game up and I see a second star in their future for sure.",0,0,0,Chris F.,"Westwood, NJ",0,16,0
3.0,11/13/2016,"For a Michelin 1 Star Restaurant I'm pretty disappointed. We arrived with a 7:45 reservation and service was slow from the beginning, we had 4 different servers come up and ask us if we needed recommendations, none of them introduced themselves so we had no clue who was the sommelier, captain or waiter. After flagging down a staff member and asking them about the 7 course tasting menu we had our table ""captain"" approach us, our inquire had not been passed along during that 15-20 minutes. We asked and got the description of the tasting menu in nothing more than a mumble. We decided on the 7 course tasting menu and service finally ramped up, though it was still disappointing that it took almost an hour to get to that point. The food was fine at best, our tasting menu consisted of- A crostini which was okay.  A lobster bisque which was very good, nice and spicy. A foie gras- the serving was too large for something this rich and the hazelnut topping was out of place, it did however pair very well with the apple chutney they served on the side- out of 4 of us no one finished it. A duck ravioli with a cherry topping which was excellent. A halibut dish served with lentils which was probably the best. A strip steak with a potato layer and balsamic sauce it was very good but we were all getting full at this point. A cheese which we could not hear since the wait staff is fluent in mumbling no matter how many times you ask them to repeat it- my guess was a blue cheese mixed with something more mild, it was okay. A raspberry sorbet which was excellent Last was some type of hazel nut whipped cookie served on top of a cookie with gelato it was good but far too rich, no one finished it Before we left they left us some type of coconut cookie and a chocolate / coconut candy it was fine. The best thing was a Barolo recommendation from the sommelier. He was polite, spoke up and made a great recommendation. I am however very disappointed they did not have a wine tasting to go with the tasting menu *cough* Del Posto knows what's up *cough*. So to break it down here is my rating. Food 4/5: it was good but not all dishes were great. Service 3/5: and that's because the sommelier was a great dude- the rest of the wait staff was sub par especially for the cost and rating of this restaurant. Atmosphere: 3/5 good decor and the place felt comfortable, maybe a little bit stuff as I'm a more relaxed person and found The Chefs Table in BK to be a nice environment, I enjoy talking to the staff and learning about the food, this did not happen here- the staff was in an out as fast as possible. If you are looking for a great, high end dinner I would consider looking elsewhere on the Michelin List. I will not be coming back on my own dime. Some will say we should have done the 4 course, but the tables flanking us did and it didn't seem incredible either. The rack of lamb dish looked like an appetizer and that was what I would have gone for.",0,0,1,Alexander T.,"Brooklyn, NY",190,36,6

You have to go up the elevators in a hotel. I guess it's part of the fun? The hotel and restaurant are definitely more up scale than Chef Michael White's other restaurants. The service was a little on the stoic side, but attentive. Since we were celebrating a graduation, I got to try a little of everyone's food. The standouts for me was the famous trofie nero pasta, which I have to say, sets the bar very high for any seafood pasta I will try from now on. It was so delicious and had a nice spicy seafood flavor. Normally I don't like tasting squid but the flavors from the squid ink in the pasta was too memorable (in a good way).

3.0,10/16/2016,"Took my wife to Ai Fiori last night after booking reservations at the last minute on OpenTable.Overall, for the luxurious cost of this Michelin star restaurant, it left much to be desired. Service was slow and not attentive. It took 2.5 hours to get through a 4 course meal. The  bread basket looked appetizing, but the waiter mumbled the choice to my wife and said nothing to me, shoving the basket in my face. On the other hand the sommelier made an excellent recommendation of a $160 bottle of Brunello. The food was hit or miss. The antipasti we ordered was excellent (lobster and octopus). The second pasta and risotto dish was also excellent. We ordered he crab and spaghetti, and some sort of seafood medley with pasta. Both dishes tasted heavy of the sea, and were unusual and interesting. .The carne dish for both was a miss. I had the veal, which was over cooked and bland. My wife's lamb chops were mixed. One lamb chop could not be cut and the other was tender. Go figure. By the time they made it back for desert, we were probably in no mood. The hazelnut something with gelato and cheescake with fig and gelato were nice desserts. Nothing that shattered my world, but nice.I lived in NY a long time, and this type of restaurant was common. Having made it's bones as a trendy restaurant years ago, they are now content to rest on laurels and put the stud out to farm.

5.0,9/27/2016,"I took my family here for dinner as a special occasion and we were not disappointed. My boss frequents and speaks very highly of Michael White's restaurants, and having tried Marea, Ai Fiori was next on our list. Our server, Carrie, was excellent. She was very attentive and present without being in any way overbearing. She checked on us frequently and was just wonderful. The ambiance was perfect, very elegant and comfortable- we had a table with a lovely view. I highly recommend all the bread they offer with the seasoned butter. I could not get enough of the raisin bread or of the olive. To start, we had the insalata, the red snapper crudo and the lobster soup. All were delicious. The soup was served piping hot and had excellent flavor.  The crudo was bright and fresh, and the salad delicious. We were also brought an amuse bouche of pureed cauliflower and spices which was very tasty. For our mains, we had the swordfish, hen, and trofie nero dishes along with a side of the hen of the woods mushrooms. My mother's swordfish was wonderfully juicy, cooked perfectly and well seasoned. The hen was moist and the guanciale was a wonderful side on the plate. My trofie nero pasta was outrageous, I highly recommend it. So flavorful, delicious scallops, and perfectly cooked pasta. I will definitely be coming back for it. The mushroom side dish was also very tasty. For dessert we had the milk chocolate mousse (torta) the budino , and torta formaggio (cheesecake) plates. All three were amazing, but the budino really stood out. The espresso and chocolate flavors were layered and complex. Each bite seemed to have such a unique and rich flavor. We also had cappuccino and espresso- both very satisfying.We did not order a bottle of wine with our meal, but my mother and sister ordered pinot grigio by the glass and it was outstanding.I do not know the names of the other waitstaff who served us, but all were very attentive and explained our dishes thoroughly.

5.0,9/20/2016,"First class experience for our anniversary dinner. Came and had their four-course pre-fixe menu. First CourseI chose the Sea Urchin pudding with uni and caviar (bottom option on the appetizer options) which came with a strong affirmation by our gracious host as a great option and it sure was. This dish was very rich but came with so many flavors in each bite that was accentuated by what you chose to pair the pudding with in each bite. The uni had a citrus juice paired with it while when eating the caviar provided another rich and salty flavor palette as well. Second Course - Pasta e RisottoI had the Trofie Nero which is their squid ink pasta which was absolutely amazing. The portion are perfectly sized to not be too filling nor keeping you wanting more when you're done. The scallops were delicious and the flakes added a nice flavor and crunch as well. Third Course - Pesce or CarneI chose the lobster tail for my third course which was a great decision. The lobster tail was fresh and had a rich buttery spread below the tail that I made sure I doused each bite in. The mushrooms were light and delicious and added a nice contrast to the rich taste of the buttery lobster. DessertI chose the cheesecake with white grape gelato and fig. The cheesecake itself was pretty standard. However, the main reason why I chose this was the white grape sorbet that came paired with it. I took one small bite to try it and instantly fell in love with it and couldn't help myself from just finishing it right away with my next two bites. The fig was decent, but then again I'm not a big fan of figs to begin with. Overall, the only thing I really enjoyed might have been the sorbet so if they give me the option to choose the scoops of sorbet next time, I may just go with that. ExperienceOverall the experience was great. They really do make you feel like you're the only patron there and give you a lot of care and attention. We were provided a spaghetti with blue crab as the chef's compliment along with a small dessert for our anniversary and a candied raspberry and earl grey chocolate when we left.

5.0,8/16/2016,"Ai Fiori is a gorgeously well appointed restaurant and well deserving of its Michelin star. I came for lunch with a friend, ostensibly to take advantage of Restaurant Week. I wasn't the most enthusiastic about the offerings so opted for the 2 course offering.Luckily they allow you to mix and match from the various categories, so you are not obligated to do an appetizer followed by a main. Both of us opted for a pasta followed by a main. For my pasta I had the Marubini, a pork shoulder ravioli with cacio e pepe and for my main the Tagliata which is a prime dry aged strip loin. The pasta was very well done, with just enough bite while the sauce if you could call it had the rich flavor of a good Pecorino Romano without being cloying. The dry aged strip loin was a perfect medium rare and tender. It paired well with the bordelaise sauce though my end result was more French than Italian. I tried both of my companion's dishes as well which were the Trofie Nero pasta and the White Label burger. The pasta is tinted with squid ink and paired with a crustacean ragu, scallops and mollica (I believe this is bread crumbs). It had great texture especially with the addition of the mollica giving it some crunch. All in all, absolutely delicious. This would have been what I picked for my pasta but I wanted to vary it up.The White Label Burger was very good as well, among the best I've had in the city. The bun was strong enough to soak up the juices from the patty while still maintaining cohesion. Paired with the bacon marmalade and a mustard sauce on the side it hit all the right savory notes for me. The pommes dauphines were an interesting choice, effectively fried mash potato balls. They were pretty good on their own but I felt this would have been better paired with some sort of sauce.Ai Fiori lived up to its reputation and put forward a great meal. I would definitely go again. My biggest point of criticism would be portion size. If my friend had not given me half her burger I'd likely have left hungry. On the flip side it would be unreasonable to expect a large portion for the Tagliata, it only had a small supplement of $6 while typically any decent sized equivalent quality steak in the city is $40-50 if not more. At $47 for 2 courses I thought this was fair.",0,0,0,Hamilton Y.,"Manhattan, NY",3,51,2

1.0,8/9/2016,"After many months of anticipation, I'm left with a mustard drenched disappointment of a $25+ burger....Since the 'White Label Burger' is a ""lunch only"" item, it's taken me some time to make it down to Ai Fiori for lunch (with work & travel, it's not exactly convenient). Last week, the stars aligned (except for the sweltering heat in NYC) and I ventured to Ai Fiori for lunch!Unfortunately, whoever was preparing the burgers last week, decided they wanted to add EXTRA condiments that weren't listed on the menu.  Below, I've included a photo of the burger and how it's described on the menu.  It doesn't mention mustard anywhere... So why would someone add it to my food? I never order substitutions; especially for burgers. I like to try dishes the way the chef intended them to be. In such a fine dining establishment like Ai Fiori, I really didn't expect my dish to differ from what was described on the menu.  Sadly, I was wrong, and I was given a burger heavy handily slathered in unsolicited mustard, hardened cheese, and dry bacon chunks masquerading as ""bacon marmalade"".  It's partially my fault for not sending it back. I'm just not that type, but thinking back about the money and disappointing experience, I felt like sharing.  I did ask to see the menu after the meal, and upon pointing the discrepancy out, I was given an ""oh well"".",3,2,0,Paul W.,"Woodside, NY",2,47,15

4.0,7/26/2016,"Looking to dine at a restaurant with a Michelin Star during Restaurant Week? Look no further than Ai Fiori. When you arrive, you take a set of stairs up to the second floor. The dining area is beautiful and has a great atmosphere. The food lives up to the Michelin Star. For an appetizer, I ordered the Zuppa di Zucca (chilled zucchini soup, calabrian chili, lemon, basil). The server poured it into your bowl at your table. For my entrée, I had the Pollo Arrosto (pan-roasted chicken, summer beans, vidalia onions, and guanciale). The chicken was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. The medley of vegetables on the side and sauce were great complements to the entrée. The Panna Cotta was an excellent way to finish my meal. Nevertheless, the entrée was definitely the highlight of the meal. While Ai Fiori has great food, the portions are not huge. It is perfect to just make you full. If you have a huge appetite, manage your expectations.

5.0,7/21/2016,"We were ecstatic when Gilt published a discount for all of Michael White restaurants...Well, excluding Marea, that is.  My Marea experience had been rather mixed anyway, but I had heard from many people that Ai Fiori offered a superior meal, so I jumped at the chance to try it out at a reduced price.  We had reservations to go there one evening, but found ourselves in the area a few days earlier and decided to try our luck for a last minute table.  Thankfully, they were able to accommodate us and were even polite when I murmured that I would be wearing jeans into their classy establishment.  Upon our arrival at the Langham, we made our way up the windy staircase to the second floor and approached the host stand.  We were greeted with big smiles and pleasantries, but all I could do was gaze into the elegant dining room on the other side of the glass door just behind us.  The dark wood, sleek lines, white table cloths, wine bottles on display - it all built an air of refinement.  Suddenly, I felt horrifyingly underdressed.  I apologized to the team, saying that we had been out and about and had stopped in straight from shopping.  My less than glamourous attire did not even cause the well-trained professionals to bat an eyelash; they just simply reassured me that I looked fine.  In fact, they took us to a reasonably nice table in the middle of the space, where we received impeccable service all evening.We wound up skipping the drink portion of the meal to get our carbs the culinary way.  A server came around with a platter of various breads, including miniature baguettes and onion rolls, among others.  The bread was phenomenal, but we tried to pace ourselves to save room for the main event.  We started by splitting two pasta dishes. There was the sea-infused Trofie Nero, a squid ink pasta tossed with seppia, scallops, spiced mollica, and topped with a Ligurian crustacean ragu.  The dish was PACKED with seafood and served as a very generous portion.  We also inhaled the Braised Veal Agnolotti, which was covered with a onion soubise, a green garlic gremolata, and walnuts.  We then moved on to share the Long Island Duck, which was roasted to perfection and served with sliced kohlrabi and sautéed broccoli rabe.  It was crusted in chopped pecans for texture and plated over a dab of plum sauce for a hint of sweetness.  In addition, we accompanied this with a side of Escarole that was studded with anchovy bits and topped with shaved Parmesan.From the flawlessly executed and beautifully displayed plates to the distinguished service, we simply fell in love with Ai Fiori.  After we snuck out of the elegant dining room in our casualwear, we promised the hosts that we would be back soon...and donning more upscale attire!",2,0,2,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

4.0,5/10/2016,"Located on the second floor of a hotel, sits another Michael White restaurant and much like his other restaurant ventures, such as Marea and Osteria Morini, Ai Fiori brings the well known strengths of Italian cuisine to the table.  Took my fiancé here for her birthday dinner and she enjoyed the experience of dining at Ai Fiori.  The decor was decadent and fanciful, with paintings on the walls and shiny polished surfaces.  The service itself was excellent, from beginning to end the staff was friendly and courteous.  We ordered their four course pre fix menu, trying the Polpo (octopus), Torchon (foie gras), Trofie Nero (their signature squid ink seafood pasta), Risotto, Bouillabaisse and the Tagliata.  The Polpo was cooked well, with the meat holding a good firm but not too chewy texture.  The Torchon had a melt in your mouth feel.  The full flavor of the liver was there without being off putting as some can be when it's too strong.  Trofie Nero was very good, being a fan of pasta makes me biased but it had great texture and not mushy.  The crunch of the spiced mollica (breadcrumbs) was balanced out with the savory flavors of the cuttlefish.  Everything in that plate of pasta was done well, as opposed to the Risotto, which was good but not great.  The Risotto was flavorful but one dimensional with a overpowering creamy Taleggio cheese used in the sauce.  It was a bit saltier than I would expect from typical risottos.  I liked it but I wouldn't necessarily order it again.  The Tagliata was cooked medium rare and done perfectly.  Seasoned lightly and very enjoyable.  The Bouillabaisse was served with a dense and thick broth filled with briny flavors of the crustaceans that cooked in this dish. Ratings:Food (out of 2 stars) - 1.5 - Food was good, but the issue was the size and portions of the dishes.  You may find yourself hungry for more if select certain dishes that were only a small bowlful per serving.  The size may have been due to the pre fix menu, so keep that in mind when you decide how you would like to order.Decor (out of 1 star) - 1 - Spectacular decor and fancy overall.  Wood floors and walls, with paintings and small plants positioned throughout the layout.  Service (out of 1 star) - 1 - Friendly service, had no issues with staff.Price (out of 1 star) - 0.5 - Pricey, certain items are worth it but others weren't so.  Not the most expensive but neither was it worth every penny.",0,0,0,Louis N.,"New York, NY",375,218,459

4.0,3/7/2016,"Great option for Italian in Midtown West.My girlfriend and I came here the weekend of Valentine's Day (2/13/16) for dinner.  Our expectations were high, knowing the reputation of restaurants in the Altamarea Group.  Fortunately, we were not disappointed by our experience.Located on the second floor of the Langham Hotel, the restaurant's dining room consists of tasteful décor that promotes a classy ambience.  We were comfortable in business casual attire.  Service was professional and friendly.  Our waiter did an excellent job of getting to know our preferences, explaining the menu options, and providing relevant recommendations.  As a result, we made an informed decision to try the menu as a four-course prix fixe.The food was delicious.  We were pleased with all of our options, including seafood, pasta, and meat dishes.  The blue crab spaghetti, trofie nero, and Nantucket Bay scallops were excellent.  We also enjoyed the rack of lamb (agnello), venison (capriolo), and lobster soup (vellutata).  Our stomachs were focused on chocolate for the dessert course so we were fans of the budino, which consisted of milk chocolate crema, dark chocolate cake, and salted caramel gelato.  Pricing was reasonable ($97/person), and the portions were filling.I definitely recommend trying it, and the prix fixe is a good way to explore the menu options.  Our waiter also mentioned that many people come just to eat the pasta as their meal, which is another solid approach.  I look forward to coming back again soon!",5,1,4,Chris M.,"Manhattan, NY",830,157,161

The restaurant week menu was very limited so we ordered from the 3- course lunch menu. The first course, fluke crudo was fantastic. The caviar on top was almost excessive since the fluke was already so rich in flavor. I tasted my friend's first course which was the lobster terrine and celery root. That was also incredible. The attention to detail was remarkable.  Lobster was fresh and sweet. Not over cooked at all. The risotto was mediocre. The presentation was lacking when compared with the other dishes.

3.0,2/1/2016,"*this review is based on a Restaurant Week experience.Why does Ai Fiori have a Michelin star?! My friend and I went during our lunch hour to enjoy a great RW lunch but found ourselves extremely thrown by the hype that we heard and the overall experience that we had.I was vastly disappointed. I understand that we selected the RW menu so it doesn't have the same creative mojo as the regular menu but if it comes to a point where I can look at a dish and feel that I can make it myself... that's when you ktnow.We both had the butternut squash soup and tagliatelle. The soup was overly bland. While the presentation of pouring the soup over pumpkin seeds and roasted squash was a beautiful tough, there was no distinctive flavor from the soup. The roasted squash pieces were the highlight. As for the tagliatelle, I easily could have (and since then, definitely have) made the pasta myself at home. It also had an excess of green onion. Dessert was the highlight of our meal. The panna cotta was done so well. It probably was the one dish that really felt like fine dining. But I could close my eyes and feel like I'm eating a similar item from Eataly or Whole Foods.The experience is something separate. The vibes are beautifully NYC upscale, the decor is beautiful, and the staff is relatively friendly. But the food is so average. i would rather buy and make pasta from Eataly for less than half the price than come back.There are so many upscale fine dining spots in NYC.

3.0,1/22/2016,"Restaurant week lunch review! Maybe 3.5/5 stars. Ai fiori is one of the places that fill up the fastest for restaurant week so I was super excited to get a reservation. I came with three friends and we were seated at a spacious table near the window. The atmosphere is gorgeous, with lots of floral decorations and antique-looking plates. For my starter I ordered the pate. I was rather underwhelmed. It was rubbery and reminded me of meatloaf, and the flavor didn't have the richness of pate that I was expecting. The mustard sauce that came with it was very overpowering and looked like your basic whole grain Dijon mustard. Regretted ordering this. One friend got butternut squash soup and said it was very good.My main was the skate wing. This was really really good. The fish was perfectly crisp on the outside, and incredibly tender on the inside. It came on a bed of coucous, along with mushrooms and some greens. Very simple and subtly flavorful. I really enjoyed this dish.For dessert I got the panna cotta. I'm usually a chocolate dessert person but this seemed too unique not to try . It had pomegranate seeds, graham cracker crumbs, grapefruit sorbet, and these cute meringue drops on top. I thought it was decent - the panna cotta itself was very creamy and milky, and the sorbet was refreshing. There was a layer of pomegranate jelly on the bottom that was a little too cloyingly sweet however. I do admit I wish I got the chocolate cake as I think I would like it better, but I guess I'm glad to have tried something different.Service was okay, the waiter seemed a bit impatient and a little cold.

I wonder if Michael White restaurants and I just aren't meant to be, because I didn't like Marea either. The place is classy and located inside a hotel. The tables are big and far apart, so the restaurant feels spacious. The host was also super sweet and kind when we arrived. A few things irked me about Ai Fiori. First, no one came to explain the menu to us. I had to flag someone to flag our captain down, but the captain never came. Instead, a server came and did not ask about allergies nor explain the menu. When I asked him to suggest a pasta dish without seafood or spices, he precisely pointed to the one dish with seafood and spices. Now onto the food, the sea bass was delicious and so was the duck. The pork shoulder cheese ravioli was alright. When the captain finally came to check on us about the food we expressed that we liked the duck and fish but not the ravioli. He didn't say anything back ... Awkward. Also, I would skip the outrageously tiny-portioned, mediocre $26 scallop appetizer; it's not worth it.I also felt rushed during the entire dining experience, with bus boys clearing plates multiple times before we were finished. Someone also said ""let me bring you the check"" before we asked for the check. On a positive note, the sommelier, the server who gave us bread, and the server who gave us dessert were all super friendly.

We started with the Siberian caviar, oh so delicious and smooth, served with gougeres, creme fraiche and minced chives.  The foie gras with brioche was divine, but really a very small portion to be shared! Three of us had the Fluke crudo with Sturgeon caviar, I could have eaten three of those, every bite melting in my mouth. Butternut squash soup creamy and delicious.The pastas:The squid ink pasta, cook perfectly al dente, the pieces of squid perfectly cooked, I thought the scallop were very few little pieces! The ravioli was a nice portion and superbly presented and melted in your mouth. Blue crab spaghetti with chillies oh so good! Did not get to taste the risotto, our friend, who is a Culinary graduate, loved it. Now for the meat or fish:I wanted the sea scallop, but they were out, disappointing! I had the Nova Scotia lobster terrine, not at all what I expected, very disappointed and did not eat it. Halibut with black truffle and celery root, she loved it. Srip loin with endives and potato terrine was cooked too perfection and was a very big portion.Rack of lamb was actually a big lamb chop, we did not like the sauce, kind of sweet.

And for the second course the Spaghetti Pasta with Blue crab, lemon, Bottarga, and Chilies. Both were wonderfully presented and delicious.

2.0,12/29/2015,"overrated overpriced for their food and service.It's ok for pasta I guess, the tasting menu and prix fix was horrible. Salty and very sweet. their dessert is too sweet not much flavor.service is BAD one or two server seemed professional but all the rest was BAD.*****All annoyingness and bad experiences together.We end up getting dishes TO GO and left early as possible since we was getting MAD. The duck and steak we took to go was very chewy and salty, portion is nicely big I guess but my experience here was BAD***** 1.They only hold the table for 15 min. They are NEVER packed, the seats was empty here and there.2. Was waited and seated keep asking for us to drink... for more than 5 times. really?3. After I chose tasting menu other was recommended prix fix. so we both have course menu. While we was deciding on what dished should be in prix fix other server came to get a order and told us that since the two course menu has different numbers of dished it cant be ordered that way. Wait, did I just mentioned that we was RECOMMENDED to order that way?then I told him we are getting the white truffle risotto for one of the dished in the prix fix. The server was telling us that he will ask hes manager or chief if we could order prix fix and tasting course for our table. but before he headed to anyone once he heard the WHITE TRUFFLE he stopped and told us we can order the way wanted.WHAT??? what kind of service level is this restaurant?THENthey brought us WRONG appetizer, they told us to keep one and brought the new right dish but that was different server who was much more nicer and professional but they keep change around the tables, it's very confusing.Since they kept asked for drink for numbers of times, we decided to drink a wine.asked for recommendation, asked for trying a bit. Server advised us to a glass page, which means oh you want to try? do it by ordering a glass.We end up getting whole bottle of wine,After we finished half of the bottle, at some point left over wine somehow disappeared. The exact same server told us to get a glass of wine if we was curious about any wine how it taste? He told me he fished pouring the bottle for us personally and he remember it was FINISHED. well maybe we was too drunk to remember anything (No WE wasn't anywhere close to drunk)Maybe go here for pasta? but theres cheaper nicer pasta dish with BETTER and professional service around the city so why waste your time and money? the building has great hair salon with awesome service upstairs oh and nice bar and lounge with great cocktail downstairs btw!!!",2,3,1,Bunny K.,"New York, NY",109,17,3

I had the octopus appetizer which is possibly the best octopus dish I've ever had. Every single element was seasoned correctly and beautifully executed. The spaghetti with crab was very, very good but it was slightly too salty which cancels out the sweetness of the crab. I don't know what it is about NYC and pasta but it always tastes saltier than it should. My guess is the pasta water was not corrected for seasoning as it evaporates over time. I had the same saltier than expected experience at the NoMad and Betony with their pasta dishes. Another theory is that cooks/chefs in NYC are heavy smokers who can no longer tell how salty their food is. And this is coming from a smoker who loves salty food.

2.0,11/1/2015,"10/30/15 Dinner.  Started with Vellutata (lobster soup, priggery black truffles, tarragon).  The soup itself was nice fragranced and could tell that the lobster shell and shell were the base of the broth.  The problem was the minuscule portion of lobster that was present and the lack of any fragrance from the truffle.  And worst of all the soup was very very salty.  Quite a shame to waste the nice base that was there.My second dish was the Torchon (foie gras au naturel, pears, pecans and thyme.  This was the best dish of the night the pears went well with foie gras.  No complaints.Final dish was a Pappardelle (toasted semolina, duck confit, charred baby leek, ricotta salata).  Again the dish was very salty.  There was no point to the ricotta or rather the ricotta was wasted as it was completely overwhelmed, very unfortunate.I had high hopes for this restaurant but was very disappointed.  I hope that the foie grass represents its standards and not the other dishes I had or the other dishes my dining partners had which they felt was over seasoned.2 1/2 stars.",1,0,1,Winston D.,"Zhongzheng District, Taiwan",27,51,915

4.0,8/31/2015,"Actual rating: 3.5/5Having very happily relished in our meal at Marea in the past, my family and I were eager to try chef Michael White's other restaurants in NYC. We were greeted warmly upon entering the classy yet intimate establishment, and enjoyed impeccable service throughout our meal. The three of us ordered one appetizer and one main each, but stole bites of each others' food to keep things interesting.Appetizers:Crostada di pomodoro -I'm a huge tomato lover, and really liked this tomato-laden tart. The stracciatella cheese was creamy but not too heavy, and I especially loved the balsamic onions sandwiched between the cheese layer and the pate brisee crust, as it added a sweet zing to the dish. The heirloom tomatoes themselves were plump, juicy and oh-so-flavourful, and you can never go wrong with basil pesto! Definitely order this if you like tomatoes or tarts.Polpo -Chef White sure knows his seafood! The octopus was juicy and tender, and the charred corn that accompanied the dish boasted a smoky flavour that complemented the octopus.Gamberi -To me, this dish was just okay. The poached shrimp was nice and light, but nothing too special about this appetizer.Mains:Trofie Nero -After reading the amazing reviews on this pasta, I knew without question even before entering the restaurant that this was the entree I was going to order. Unfortunately, I wasn't blown away by this dish. Maybe my expectations were a little too high, but the sauce was a little on the bland side, and the breadcrumbs weren't spicy at all. The scallops and cuttlefish were chopped into pieces that were too tiny to really enjoy their taste and texture. The pasta itself, on the other hand, was nice and al dente, with a little bite to them. All in all, an okay pasta dish.Spaghetti -An interesting pasta dish with crab, lemon, bottarga (salted, cured fish roe, according to the ever trusty Google!), and chilies. The chilies give a spicy kick to the dish, and the lemon flavour was definitely present. Again, I wish the crabmeat came in more sizable pieces so that the flavour of the crab would shine through, but overall a yummy dish that my dad really enjoyed.Tagliata - I stole half of one of the three slices of strip loin that my mom ordered, and the meat was cooked nicely at medium. I particularly liked the potato terrine that came with the dish, with layers upon layers of extremely thinly sliced potatoes that soaked up the balsamic sauce.Dessert:Torta di olio -I was really looking forward to this dessert, but was a little bummed when I saw that the actual olive oil cake only took up half of the (very pretty, I concede) cake, while the other half was comprised of layers of mascarpone mousse, pistachio cream, and strawberry jelly, which masked the delicate, subtle flavours of the olive oil. I ended up flipping the dessert over so that I could eat just the olive oil cake, but even then I couldn't really taste the olive oil itself. Go to Babbo for some real good torta di olio!The lowdown: Impeccable, warm service, and good Italian food that was still enjoyable from start to finish, though it's not as outstanding as I'd expected it to be. It's worth checking out, but I don't know if I'd come back again when there are so many other great Italian restaurants to check out around the city!",0,0,0,Yoon-Ji H.,"Morningside Heights, Manhattan, NY",390,6,39

5.0,8/26/2015,"This place has been on my bucket list for a long time (I suppose the same is true for a lot of the Michelin-starred restaurants). So I was really happy that I got to go to this place for my birthday.First of all, the place is super classy but not in an uncomfortable way. The service from start to finish is top notch. This is the type of place where they fold your napkin when you leave the table, and change your silverware with every meal. They also hover in the background, continually checking on you. The decor is very understated and it actually seems more casual than stuffy. We went with the following dishes a la carte: polpo a la pancha (octopus), trofie nero, and maiale (pork loin). They first served us with an amuse bouche of squash soup, which was nice and light. The octopus was incredibly delicious, with charred corn, pickled ramps, and guanciale. It was a different mix of flavors but somehow it all worked, and the octopus was perfectly tender. The trofie nero was the dish I'd been wanting to try from this place and it did not disappoint. Super fresh spiral ribbons of squid ink pasta with an amazing seafood ragu, topped with spicy breadcrumbs. It was incredible! The pork loin actually was a bit of a letdown, as it was a beautiful piece of meat that was simply overcooked. The flavor was still there though, and I adored the lentils and pork belly that accompanied the dish. We finished with the mille feuille for dessert, which had a beautiful presentation, plus all of chocolate and hazelnut elements were wonderful. Definitely earns its place among the Michelin-starred restaurants. It's pricey as expected, but worth it for a special occasion.",1,1,1,Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",478,767,323
5.0,8/19/2015,"Of all the tens of thousands of restaurants in NYC, only 58 currently have the honor of being awarded 1 Michelin star. Ai Fiori is on that short list.First impressions of Ai Fiori: it's sleek, modern, and yes, located in a hotel. But don't call it a hotel restaurant because it deserves far better. There will be people holding doors open for you. You walk up a spiral staircase and are led to your table. We sat in the first main room (there are larger tables around the corner, as well as bar seating near the lobby). The atmosphere is casual despite basically everyone dressed in business attire, and it's the kind of place where you can hear what the tables next to you are talking about.The service at Ai Fiori is also impeccable. Smooth in changing plates and silverware, but always no more than a few feet away in case you need anything (like more whiskey).Anyway, our meal was as follows:0) Amuse-bouche - summer squash soup1) Polpo - octopus a la pancha, charred corn, pickled ramps, guanciale2) Trofie Nero (Liguarian crustacean ragu, seppia, scallops, spiced mollica)3) Maiale (Berkshire pork loin, beluga lentils, braised lettuce, pork belly)4) Mille Feuille (chocolate cremeux, hazelnut praline, fior di latte gelato)5) Complimentary fruit sugar drop thingsSo the thing is they have a prix fixe menu, but you can order anything off of it a la carte, which is how we came by the octopus, which was lovely. The charred corn gave it a nice smokiness, and the pickled veggies added a nice contrast. The octopus leg(?) itself was pretty substantial as well.The Trofie Nero (squid ink pasta) was a close second. The thing that hits you in the face immediately is the spiced mollica, which is basically delicious crunchy breadcrumbs. The pasta was super fresh and the Ligurian crustacean ragu was more on the subtler side. But the breadcrumbs really made that dish. Added a nice texture to the whole dish, which was amazing on its own to begin with.Also had the Berkshire pork loin, which I can't say I was a huge fan of. A little bit overcooked, so it was dry, but the lentils and pork belly that accompanied it were awesome.For dessert, we had the Mille Feuille, which was basically all the flavors of Nutella in a deconstructed format. The hazelnut praline was the most hazelnutty hazelnut I've had, with a nice crunchy exterior. The chocolate cremeux was rich but fluffy at the same time. And the gelato was great for binding it all together. Definitely a good way to end the meal.I also tried one of the cocktails (The Kattan, which had rum, mango and chili) before settling on bourbon. I don't think they're known for their cocktails, so stick to the basics.I highly recommend Ai Fiori. It's more of a special occasion type of place, but it's worth the hype.",4,1,3,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",884,3337,12015

5.0,8/5/2015,"This review is based on the restaurant week lunch menu. So my fiancée and I went and the restaurant was flexible, changing our reservation time a couple times around because our personal plans changed.We ordered the corn soup and pâté for appetizers. They were both delicious. The corn soup was a good consistency, not too creamy or watery and lots of flavor. The pate went well with the mustard and fresh bread it came with. For entrees we got the pasta and skate wing. The pasta sauce was normal but the noodles and mushroom were delicious. The pasta noodles were a great texture. All together the dish's ingredients went well with each other. My fiancée loved the skate wing. Again, all the ingredients went well with each other. The fish was cooked perfectly with the right amount of buttery flavor. I'm not a huge dessert fan but the lemon dessert I got was good. Went we'll with the crumble and crispy flake it came with.

3.0,8/3/2015,"This place had been my favorite restaurant for a number of years until today. Two of us were there for lunch and one ordered from restaurant week menu and the other from regular menu and we shared. Crudo di passera (fluke) and Trofie Nero from regular menu were wonderful.  Terrine and Chicken from restaurant week menu were good but not great. My disappointment came with the dessert, the chocolate tart.  The tart was made up of a chocolate sponge cake with chocolate mousse/cream on top with ice cream on the side. The sponge cake was shockingly stale and did not taste fresh at all.  It was terrible and unacceptable especially since it comes from a Michelin starred restaurant.  I was very disappointed and probably won't go back.  I think they shouldn't participate in restaurant week if they can't retain the same quality as their regular menu.",0,0,1,Sao T.,"Westbury, NY",165,21,10

3.0,7/31/2015,"Since they participate at restaurant week, we decided to give this Michelin starred restaurant a shot. Went in, didn't have a reservation, agreed to sit at the bar. 15 mins in, my husband still didn't have a plate and a napkin, so I asked to be seated inside so we get a better service. Another 15 mins passed and finally we got in. Placed our order right away. We ordered corn soup for the first course and I was impressed by the presentation (they bring grilled corn pieces and basil on a plate and pour cream on top) and the taste. It was great. For the main course I ordered pasta, my husband ordered chicken. You would imagine that since they have a fixed menu for restaurant week, they would just have the dish ready and serve it quickly. But no. It took 35 mins until they served our main meal. The pasta was good, but ordinary. Hubby said chicken was good, but small. We got chocolate cake and lemon berry mix for dessert. The lemon dessert had a egg-taste to it, I couldn't finish it. Was really unexpected for a Michelin rated restaurant. So overall, our experience wasn't as pleasant. The wait before and during the food was too long. The food was average. Service was okay. So, 3 stars. Not in Michelin stars though.",3,0,0,Shab A.,"Alpine, NJ",232,153,228

I really like the mushroom in it and it's a little bit sour, not too bad. But my friend keeps complaining about the roasted chicken and said it is tasteless and the chicken is raw inside.

2.0,7/29/2015,"I know this place is really well regarded and Michael White is a successful restaurateur, which is why I'm rather baffled that I was underwhelmed. I try not to let hype drive my impression of a place, hence why you'll never see me in the line winding around the corner at Shake Shack on 8th. But I wanted to believe that this place was worth the hype and the price tag. What I love about Restaurant Week is that is allows diners of modest means to feel like we can live these lavish lifestyles that we read about in the latest issue of Bon Appetit. Normally this place is out of my reach, so when I saw it listed as a participant, I jumped at the chance to make a reservation. I've had great meals during RW and not so great ones. This was one of them. The service was of course, impeccable. A place like this isn't going to let anyone work, as it has a reputation to uphold, so we were greeted by a pleasant hostess and waited on by a very professional wait staff.The food however, was something else. From the RW menu, I had the paté to start, which was great. The fluke as a main, was a miss. If you've read some of my other reviews, you'd know that recently, seafood and I haven't been getting along. This fish was not fresh. Each bite had that undertone taste of ammonia. The accompaniments along with it were great, as well as the sauce, but the fish just wasn't great. Dessert didn't feel worth the calories either. When it comes to dessert in a nice joint, I usually expect something with a lot of pow. I had read somewhere recently about the challenges of being a pastry chef, that you have to convince tired palettes to consume a few more bites, and I did, but I wouldn't go out of my way for the chocolate dessert I had. While it was a great piece of chocolate cake, it still was just chocolate cake. I understand the idea to cut back on quality for a discounted menu, but I think it speaks volumes about the attitude towards those diners if that's the case. I've always seen Restaurant Week as a great way to pull in traffic and expose your restaurant brand to a lot of people that wouldn't come otherwise, but based on my lunch here, it seems like Ai Fiori has all that they need.",4,0,0,Jen C.,"New York, NY",162,193,165
5.0,7/27/2015,"The choices for restaurant week were absolutely filling. The chicken entree and the pasta entree are a must. The tomato sauce in the pasta is just right and doesn't taste too tomato-y. The chicken isn't dry at all. As for the dessert, this was probably the best part. My boyfriend ordered the chocolate-like cheesecake that was extra warm and sweet, and I ordered the meringue that came with raspberries and blackberries. I think the best part of the meringue was the fruit; I've never tasted such a good version of those fruits dipped in cream. Would definitely recommend for Italian food lovers.

The service always stands out here, impeccable and friendly. I like the layout of the dining room and we got a lovely table in a comfortable psuedo corner set up which was nice. Our server had these round bright red glasses and he was professional and courteous. We ordered the salad, pate, skate wing, and both desserts. The only  reason I ordered the salad was because I was trying to eat healthy, otherwise I might have ordered one of the soups which looked really good. The salad was crisp and fresh, but relatively plain, nothing notable about the dressing although the crisp sliced bread-turned-croutons and the shaved cheese were tasty. The pate was a tough and hearty. The  main entree was a decent portion size, but I think the skate was a a tad bit overcooked and overpowered the smattering of couscous that was under it. I had the chocolate dessert and my lunch date ordered the berry meringue. Both were very good. I think in general this place deserves a 3.5 stars for the food, but I gave them the bump because of the service. Bravo.",1,0,0,Jen S.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",166,239,775

They really take the time to describe dishes to you and offer up their own recommendations.For the first course I had a lobster terrine with summer squash and prosciutto. Flavors were surprisingly very light and as it was a cold dish, perfect for the weekend's heatwave. My pasta course was the marubini, or pork-filled pasta. This is a small course, and you only get 5 or 6 little ravioli, but it was delicious. My main was a pork loin, and the portion was sizeable enough that I was starting to feel quite full. Dessert was an amazing olive oil cake layered with mascarpone, Sicilian pistachio, and carmelized honey and strawberry sorbetto. It was divine.Our meal also included one amuse-bouche and a little tray of assorted chocolates before our bill. A 4-course dinner for two plus two glasses of wine and tip came out to almost $300.

Last time I came here for my birthday dinner a few years ago, and i liked the food but i hated our waiter.  I saw that waiter again today because he has an extra long goatee and bright red glasses, so yes, after like 2 years I still remember him and his sourpuss attitude.  I was really surprised he was still working there.  I hoped we didn't get him and luckily we didn't, which made for a much more pleasant experience this time around.",0,2,0,E R.,"Manhattan, NY",41,137,32

5.0,7/11/2015,"Unlike me after this dinner, most dishes at Ai Fiori are rich. But nothing I didn't expect after experiencing my first Michelin starred meal on a short notice. I thought I could get the most bang for my buck by doing the 4 course meal for two and boy did they make me pay (figuratively and literally).  I was so full by the 3rd course, I had to take most of it back with me. For the appetizer course, my date and I split the lobster soup and the softshell crab. The soup tasted as if the lobster had a strict diet of bechamel since it was so creamy while the softshell crab was delightfully breaded and light. We had to try squid ink pasta since everyone loved it here and I can see why. Not everyday does someone get to enjoy a dish that is the same shade as their soul- black. It had the perfect balance of crispy, au dente, scallop-y, and acid. I also had the risotto which was very good but I started to regret my choice of dishes as a single buttery tear rolled down my cheek.I was so full by the 3rd course, that I had to unbutton the top button of my pants. A visually spectacular plate of lamb ribs came out and all I could do was groan at my unfortunate predicament. I took two bites and threw the towel in. At this point in my fullness, things started getting hazy. However, I couldn't skip dessert. So I didn't. I split the mille feuille and the frutti rossi. The mille was my favorite since it was chocolatey but not too sweet whereas the frutti lived up to its name by being light and refreshing.All in all the food was a 4/5 but the service catapults Ai Fiori to 5 star. My waiter was diligent and kind and fulfilled all my expectations for fine dining. A good contrast to that was me sitting in my underwear in a 2 star apartment afterwards eating my leftovers.  My date is in total food coma next to me and I have a lamb chop in each hand with sauce dribbling down my chin.

Top-notch stuff!!!Risotto di Mare with calamari parsley and lemon. Oh My Yummy God (""OMYG"") on the nose. Very soft, in terms of soaking up the broth/sauce, and slightly soft, not al dente, on the palate. The lemony flavor jumps out a bit much for us. Having said that, we would say very good to excellent albeit the aroma was spectacular.Spaghetti with blue crab, lemon, bottarga and chilies. Beautiful, crabby smell, light tomato sauce, chilies...wait for it...just kicking in. Wow, nice! We love the way the pasta soaks up the sauce to the point there is no need to lop up the sauce with bread. Interesting, eh!? Not al dente and, voila, we love it!!! The chilies are an extraordinary element with the pasta in a way ""arrabiatta"" never has dawned on our palates. Mucho OMYG!!!! This is fine dining on portion-size-steroids!

I had the lobster terrine with prosciutto for my appetizer, which is actually pretty heavy in comparison to the other small dishes so I recommend for someone with a large appetite. It was delicious, and the taste was light. For pasta I had the veal with black truffle and I'm not kidding you it's probably the best pasta dish I've had in years, like damn...I would go back specifically for that. I had the lobster main course which was a little excessive with the lobster appetizer but I for sure don't regret it because, well it was awesome. But if you're gonna get the terrine to start with I think it pairs well with the steak (that's what my sister got and it was a true medium rare. Yum.)The bread was even fresh and delicious. Also they are gluten-free friendly! Two of the people with me were gluten intolerant and they could eat a fair amount of dishes on the menu, and they have gluten free bread and spaghetti.

4.0,5/13/2015,"For my 300th review (woohoo!), of course I have to write one up for a Michelin rated restaurant. We were in NYC for a few days and decided to check out this joint located in Langham Place for a classy affair. The restaurant itself is located on the second floor to make your way over to spiral staircase leading upstairs. The dining room is to the left with the bar to the right with both having great décor. The dining room is very open with tables lined up against the walls with enough space in between each to avoid having to listen to other conversations. We were immediately greeted upon entering and seated promptly for our 7:00PM reservation.The menu has your standard appetizers, entrees, desserts, etc but what is really great about this menu is that you can do a four course prix fixe menu for a great deal of $90ish dollars. This allows you to choose an appetizer, pasta dish, a main entrée, and a dessert. After a bit of perusing (and extensive online searching prior to the reservation), we were able to quickly make our choices. For my selection, I went with the veal sweetbreads (Animelle), the pork shoulder ravioli (Marubini), the steak (Tagliata), and the  mousse (Torta di Olio). My companion for the evening decided to go with the Foie Gras (Torchon), Trofie nero, Veal Chop (Vitello), and Chocolate Mousse (Crema di Cioccolato). We paired our dinners with two 15 year old Mcallan neats. After ordering, they brought out a basket of bread with salted butter along with an amouse bouche which was delicious (wish I could remember the name).Our plates were not too far behind the starter. All of the dishes were plated well and ""pretty"" to look at. The veal was good while being flaky and tender while the foie gras being executed perfectly. I was especially impressed with the Foie Gras because it did not ""get old"" after half of it and was delicious to the last and every bite. The two pasta dishes following close after were also delicious with the pasta being cooked perfectly. The ravioli was just delicious with the pork coming through with each bite and being super tender. The sauce was a great compliment to the pork. The Trofie Nero was great with the seafood offering a great compliment to each bite. Needless to say we killed all of our plates to this point leaving nothing behind. Our third dish was close to follow right afterwards. We both received our plates and the meat dishes were good but I was a bit disappointed with both the veal and steak. I would say the meat was a bit chewy for my taste and not the forte of this restaurant so slightly disappointing. Still good but seemed to be a difference from everything up to this point. We were off to our final plate which was the dessert. The chocolate mousse was good but a bit rich for my taste however the Torta di Olio was perfect. I am not a huge dessert person but I literally killed this dish so quickly. Great light dessert that was executed perfectly.All in all, a great restaurant that I would be happy to go back to.

5.0,4/18/2015,"4.5 (but rounded up) If I had to choose again, I would totally choose this place to celebrate my 22nd birthday again! My twin friend and I wanted to treat ourselves to a memorable fine dining, and she never had a michelin-star experience before. We decided to come here because Italian and French never go wrong for us! We chose the four-course pre-fixed meal for $97 each and a glass of champagne. We started off with the multi-seeded bread that was warmly toasted and tasty with a little spread of creamy, salted butter. My first course was the foie gras, which was rich and creamy. It automatically melted in my mouth. Also, I spread it over my toasted bread and mixed it with the nuts, which added a hint of roasted aroma to the piece and crunchy textures. My second meal consisted of the squid ink pasta, and I devoured it in no time! The pasta was cooked perfectly. Not too soft or hard, it was al dente! Also, the pasta absorbed all of the flavors of the sauce and mixed very well altogether with the seafood chunks and crunchy flakes!The third course was the scallops. The scallops were nice seared on the pan until perfection. It's light crisp on the outside while it's warm and soft on the inside. The sauce was a little too thick, but it went well with the mushrooms and scallops.Lastly, MY FAVORITE PART OF MEAL: DESSERT! It was very intricately placed into a beautiful artwork with a single candle for us to make a birthday wish! The dessert was tasty with various pieces putting together including a scoop of sorbet, chocolate, and other sweetness! However, I was so full that I could only eat a bite or two of the dessert. At the end, when we thought our meal had concluded we were given complementary chocolates! I absolutely had a memorable dining experience because the food was high quality, the service was on point, and the ambiance was romantic and classy! This is the perfect spot for a lovely experience!",1,0,1,Fiona L.,"New Brunswick, NJ",422,353,1619

The risotto was also very good, but my favorite was the spaghetti with blue crab. A little hot with some strong notes. Pasta was cooked perfectly. And the duck was out of this world.

I took it on recommendation from the server, but it tasted like it came from a box and was microwaved with cheap cheese on top. I asked for a different entree (first time I've ever done this), and while they brought new food and apologized, they left the original entree on the bill.

4.0,3/25/2015,"Michael White, you slay me. It's been awhile since I've been to a restaurant located inside of a hotel, but the staff at the Langham Place is very courteous and helpful.  There's a revolving door you have to make your way through that reminded me of a recent Walking Dead episode but you push that away IMMEDIATELY.Someone seriously spent a lot of money making sure this place lived up to the sleek, classy feel of an upscale environment without being too stuffy.  The crowd is primarily of the corporate realm, with a healthy dose of mixed dress codes (I know, who would've thought?).  I was a little early and the bar was rather empty at the time, so I had Chris make me a drink called The Royal Blush (a concoction of gin, lemon, and sparkling wine) and we chatted a bit about our lives and it turned out he was an aspiring actor so I couldn't help asking for his last name.  I'll be looking for your name in the end credits when you get famous, boy.  For people who like Grey Goose poire (pear), try the Green Vespa.  It is literally one of the smoothest drinks I've ever tasted.  Like a freakin' smoothie.  Yeah, I said it.I'm usually impartial to bread, but I fell in love with theirs.  The server recommended the olive bread, and it was a hit.  I tried not to load up too much on the carbs so I could enjoy the blue crab spaghetti, which was delish.  Had a bunch of flavors that all came together in one bite.  It did have a bit of a fishy smell, but not overpowering and it was enough to make you realize that it really was a fresh catch.  I also had the pan seared scallops as the second course.I always love asking servers what their recommendations are because they're usually on point, so she gave us the Mela as our dessert, which was apple confit with brown butter and vanilla ice cream (or gelato)? You could taste the ginger and all the goodness that comes with it.  It truly is a dish for people who find the heaviness of apple pie overwhelming but preferred a lighter and airy version of the dessert.  And of course, service was flawless (would you really expect anything less from such an establishment?) from beginning to end.  Thanks for making my birthday fabulous.",3,2,3,Caroline K.,"Queens, NY",328,444,37

4.0,3/18/2015,"I stopped in with a friend during NYC Restaurant week. The whole experience was wonderful from start to finish! In terms of operation, fine dining doesn't get better than this.  The attention to detail was pretty remarkable and yet we were never kept waiting for anything (though I did have to wait for my companion to arrive).  The cuisine is Italian but deceptively so.  If no one told you, you might be able to guess (because you're a seasoned vet when it comes to food) but trying to imagine what your food would taste like after combining the listed ingredients would be an exercise in futility.  I remember having the Halibut, which was cooked perfectly, but didn't necessarily knock my socks off with flavor. My lunch buddy agreed with that assessment. If I were going to pull a star it would've been for that, but the rest of our meal and experience was so good that flavor notwithstanding, the place deserved a high rating. My friend had wine, while I had beer from Brooklyn Brewery (tactical error on my part) which I'm presenting as evidence of a fully stocked bar with every option under the sun.  For Dessert, my friend had the Tartaletta di Cioccoloato (Salted Caramel, Dark Chocolate Cremeux) while I had the Tartaletta di Exotique (Passion Fruit Curd, Vanilla Cream, mango).  Her tart was good, but we both agreed mine was better.  Fun fact: My companion was able to effortlessly slide her tart across the plate on which it was served... kind of like, a hockey puck.  I also noticed that they had Blue Forest (Heirloom Typica) coffee on the menu which I really wanted to try but they will only brew a full pot for a table (16 servings).  I thought this was odd but I accepted it and had a regular cappuccino instead.  Bottom-line: It's a little bit pricey, but it's worth it.  You should go.  You won't be disappointed.",0,0,0,Anacleto B.,"New York, NY",245,58,123

4.0,3/12/2015,"I was treated to a lovely experience thanks to a friend who knows some of the guys in the kitchen. The ambience at Ai Fiori is what you would expect from an Altamarea outpost with Michael White at the helm - elegant, understated, meticulous but not stuffy. We enjoyed a drink at the bar while waiting for our table, Anthony was charming and knowledgeable about the cocktails as well as the food. We were riveted while he described the pasta dishes to help us make a decision. As someone who doesn't drink, I get told ""you can't even taste the alcohol in this"" all the time. When Anthony made a Green Vespa for my friend, I expected the same old scenario to play, except when I tasted it, it was delicious and for the first time I really couldn't discern any alcoholic taste.On to the food. The pre-meal bread offerings were a little lackluster; I kept comparing it to Marea, which served amazingly soft and addicting olive foccacia. We started with the octopus, foie gras, fluke crudo, and bass tartare. Everything tasted clean, fresh, composed perfectly. The octopus and fluke were the standouts for me. The octopus was perfectly cooked, with the right amount of charring for a smoky flavor, and the fluke was mild and went really well with the sturgeon caviar that was generously laid atop the fish. Next came the pasta dishes. We ordered the trofie nero (squid ink pasta), pork shoulder marubini (ravioli), braised veal agnolotti, and black truffle risotto. I'm partial to seafood based pasta, so the trofie nero was a clear winner for me. The pasta was supremely bouncy and the seafood/sauce was minimal yet decadent. The spiced mollica (breadcrumbs) added a nice contrast in texture and the slightest bit of kick. Following closely behind the squid ink pasta for me was the veal agnolotti. Perfect little pockets of tender meat. I felt that the guanciale and pork shoulder in the marubini were a little overpowering and salty, and I was too full to try the risotto.Desserts were beautiful but unremarkable. I would order the pane caramello al rum again.The pasta and seafood apps are definitely Ai Fiori's strongest points, and while I didn't have the chance to try any of their meat/fish entrees, the trofie nero alone is worth the visit. Service is impeccable, and I liked that the atmosphere felt laid back for a fine dining establishment.

3.0,3/7/2015,"Came here for restaurant week lunch. $25 is a real steal for a restaurant like Ai Fiori, but after dining, we realize that it is also the only time we will ever dine here.  My appetizer - the butternut squash soup was the best part of the meal. I never knew butternut squash soup could taste so good! the presentation is also absolutely delectable.  Like other reviews, the meal went downhill after the appetizer. The worst part was the service. The table next to us with two girls who came in later than us received much better service than we did. Firstly, they totally forgot to give us bread. We had butter on our table but no bread even throughout our appetizer. Then, the server came to offer the girls bread the moment they sat down and promptly walked  away without even checking whether there is bread on our table. I can't understand why it is it so hard to check on other tables as well when he has already made the trip with the basket of bread? In the end, we had to ask for bread as I would have loved to enjoy it with my soup but by the time it came, I had finished my soup as it was turning cold. The same server came to offer the girls bread after they are done with their appetizer and did the same thing to ignore is again. By then, we were exasperated.The two girls also received their entrees way before us, even though we ordered and finished our appetizers before them. We waited 20min after their entrees arrived and watched them finish their food. Finally, our entrees are here. My partner's chicken was really nice with the flavorful coq au vin sauce but my skate fish was lackluster. I read from other reviews that the surface was supposed to be crispy but mine was just soaked with oil and glistening with oil. All I could taste was oil as well, and very over-used oil in fact. Desserts were nice but pretty unmemorable. The portions were so small that I believe they were for mice? I really wanted to like this restaurant, but preferential service is really off-putting, just because I didn't put on five inch deep of makeup?

2.0,3/6/2015,"NOTE: This was not my first time here. I have been here before and usually have pasta dishes. This was the first time I ordered a meat dish here. First off, the service and staff are great! Really personable. Went here and ordered off the restaurant week menu for lunch. The salad was standard, and blood orange dessert was fine. Dessert was probably the best part of the meal, though that's not saying much...I ordered the pollo arrosto as the main course.  I was given dark meat cuts of chicken that were (sorry to say): disgusting. There was plenty of fat in the pieces I was given, as well as some noticeable pieces of cartilage. My best guess is that these were reject parts; even fast-food restaurants serve better quality chicken in their chicken nuggets. They were not delicious and some of the skin was a little soggy. The accompanying vegetables were OK.This was disheartening for me, that this restaurant would plate something of such low quality. I'm not sure whether or not the chicken was served this way because it was off the restaurant week menu, but it is unacceptable regardless. There should be some standards of quality in place.

3.0,3/2/2015,"Ai fiori has pretty nice and upscale interior decor. That was the first impression it had on me. After climbing up the stylish spiral staircase, I approached the receptionist and told her I had a reservation. We ended up having to wait 10 minutes for our table to be ""set up"" even though I already pre-booked a table. For our appetizer, we ordered the Zuppa di zucca (butternut squash soup), and the terrina di maiale (housemade pate). The butternut squash soup was plated quite simply but elegantly. The soup was savory and delicious. However, it tasted more of butter and cream than butternut squash. It was very smooth though, and the small cubes of butternut squash, pumpkin seeds, and pickled delicata all added texture and a contrast of flavor to the soup, which was much needed. It wasn't quite adequate enough, though. The entrees is where it went all wrong. The table ordered the same exact dishes as us but got theirs first even though we had ordered quite a significant minutes ahead of them. We ended up waiting an entire 30 minutes to get our entrees, meanwhile the table next to us was already halfway done with their dessert. Back to the food. I ordered the pollo arrosto (pan roasted chicken).  It was very flavorful and tender. The skin on top was thin and crisp-a perfect rendering. The herbs used and sauce really helped propel the chicken. The veggie components to the dish were okay. The texture of the carrots and potatoes were quite firm in texture. The pearl onion tasted like it was pickled, so it brought some nice acidity to the dish. I also tried a bite of my friend's razza (pan roasted skate wing). It was cooked nicely and had a nice and light exterior crunch. Last up was dessert. We both opted for the meringue. The meringue came in a simple flat disc on top of other ingredients. The meringue shattered right upon touch. It was sweet and delicious. When eating it with all the other components (the blood orange, pomegranate, and lemon crema), it was really a burst of flavor popping your mouth. Combinations of sweetness and tart. It was great. A little more on the sour side though. Overall, the food was great at ai fiori. The appetizer wasn't wow.

They were thick homemade noodles... A real treat. The sauce is heavy on the cheese, Parmesan?. It's smelly, but IMO delicious! There's bits of some type of salad vegetable....

The restaurant is very pretty and our waiter, very good. There is no bread basket. A busboy came by once and served  a small slice of ""white bread"" which is a thin piece of crusty bread. Disappointing. The food itself was good, not great. We each had the salad and agreed it was dull & under seasoned/dressed. The one crouton was greasy & seemed a bit rancid. The two paper thin squares of cheese were the best part. The pasta was served with a heavy cream sauce but it was flavorful and al dente. It was also room temperature with some pieces being downright cold. We both ordered the chocolate cake which was so dry the layers actually separated when you cut into it. The gelato was utterly forgettable. Coffee was a dark roast which I am not a fan of. Having dined at Marea  & Osteria Morini ( and loving them ) plus reading all the rave reviews, I expected better. Finally, I did not like the way I was treated by the hostess or coat check woman. I arrived early and before my companion.

I decided on the Nova Scotia Lobster, Trofie Nero (ligurian crustacean ragu) and the Agnello (rack of lamb). The lobster was excellent and succulent. The ragu was very good and tasty and I would say the lamb was... pretty ok (the meat was almost... too soft? I didn't feel like I was actually having meat... it was more of a very higher class... lamb spam texture... yeah that's the best way I can describe it)... it wasn't bad and maybe it's just made that way. The reason I give this a solid 4 and it's definitely not a 5/5 was because service was a bit inconsistent. It seemed we waited a little bit longer to order than usual and we also didn't get the house bread until well after we ordered our dishes. I was seated where I actually saw the floor manager talk to our waiter and it was clear he was talking about our table... right after their brief discussion, someone came to our table and re-positioned the table candle and then the breads and water came our way. Not quite sure what happened there but it was just a little inconsistent given the price we were paying (well not me... birthday boy! haha... yeah...).Overall I still like the food and the atmosphere and it seems like place I'd want to go again and try some of the other dishes.",0,0,1,Timmy L.,"Jamaica, NY",103,60,138

3.0,2/12/2015,"I researched this restaurant on multiple sources before deciding on it for my wife's birthday, so was quite surprised when it didn't hold up to the hype.  The atmosphere is very corporate, clean, uninteresting - definitely not a romantic spot.   The waiter was dynamic and gave great descriptions of dishes when we asked him for information, but his words tasted better than the food actually. We had fluke crudo with caviar for one of our appetizers.  The fluke/caviar flavor was overwhelmed by its olive oil sauce, which just made the flavor oily.  The scallops app was okay but nothing I couldn't have done myself (and Im not some amazing chef).The pastas were tasty but not exceptional.  I could have had comparable pasta for half the price at good restaurants in the city, so why was I paying over $30 for these tiny portions?My wife had the halibut, which was bland and the fish was a bit mushy, because it had been so long in its broth.  My venison chop had very little flavor in the meat.  Only the fatty bites had something to savor. I must say that we both loved our desserts very much, so the pastry chef deserves some kudos.  The wine pairings we had with our $97 prix fixe meals were better than average but not mind blowing, although one of them, a Corsican wine, impressed me. My wife and I have enjoyed great dinners out in this price range, where we left more than satisfied and the bill was worth it.   This restaurant - the atmosphere and the food - felt cold, impersonal, bland, and overpriced.",0,0,0,Greg T.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,27,1
5.0,2/10/2015,"This place is seriously amazing!! I think it might be my new favorite Italian restaurant in Manhattan. The interior design is modern and classy, love the service the decoration and everything! I had Torchon(foie gras with brioche) for appetizer. It's definitely the best foie gras I had in a long long time. And I had the trofie Nero(squidink pasta) for my entree-the pasta itself is very well made, very chewy and tasteful. The flavor is amazing with small pieces of scallops and sepia with mollica. My friend had the Long Island duck, medium rare, I have couple pieces and goodness it was marvelous. The sweet apple and hazelnut outside and the salty duck itself taste literally like a party in my mouth. The meat is so amazing, juicy and soft it would melt in mouth....  The only thing is that we didn't have time to have dessert. I would highly highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion.

You can suggest specials, but no need to spoon feed you the menu in order to receive a better tip. Same went for the wine. The servers were too pushy for their own good.The food - starter both had the lobster soup which was really good but just warm, not exactly hot. Second, two pasta dishes, one being the risotto.

5.0,1/31/2015,"Gorgeous. Everything is gorgeous. The hotel, the restaurant, and most importantly, the food!I came here for restaurant week, and the lunch menu was only $25! Ridiculously cheap for the quality of the food.Starters:-pate with dijon mustard and crispy baguette: perfect. So flavorful and rich. I love pate, and this bread was crispy on the outside, yet fluffy and giving on the inside so it was easy to chew. The dijon mustard was a great note in the background.-house salad: standard, but lovely! The greens were crisp and fresh, and the lemon dressing was refreshing. -butternut squash soup: so good. So creamy and rich and flavorful and perfect. It had brown butter and pumpkin seeds too.Entrees:-Razza: pan-roasted skate wing, polenta, mushroom fricassée, porcini sugo, ricotta salata. Amazing! i have never had skate before, it's a kind of stingray, and the meat is so tender and unique. Wow. The mushroom side was so flavorful as well.-Casarecce: housemade pasta, arugula, asiago, parmesan. Again, amazing! This pasta was the perfect al dente texture, and I could really taste that it was egg-based. The sauce was so light, and the cheese really flavored the dish.-Pollo Arrosto: pan roasted chicken al coq au vin, thumbelina carrots, turnips, pearl onions red wine sauce. Wow, this chicken was so incredibly tender and juicy. The presentation was just lovely, with the three beautiful pieces separated by the sauce and pearl onions. Dessert:-the grapefruit olive oil cake with vanilla ice cream was most and heavenly, but the real star...-Torta di Cioccolato dark chocolate, hazelnut crema, fior di latte. Oh my word. This was the perfect ending to this meal. The chocolate and hazelnut mousse was so rich and creamy, it was like half ganache, half mousse.

4.0,1/4/2015,"I chose Ai Fiori for 3 reasons: 1) We wanted a nice, Michelin-star-winning dinner to end our trip in New York, 2) Our first choices were booked through more than a month in advance (holiday season), and 3) my boyfriend wanted foie gras.Though our reservation was for 7:00 PM, we arrived about 20 minutes early, checked in our coats/bags, and were promptly seated. The restaurant was not even half full, and I found it amusing that they pulled out the table for better access to the booths (not that we had any trouble at all doing so normally). We settled for the $97 four course prix-fixe, since we weren't especially hungry but still wanted to try more dishes. At my request, the waiter described his recommendations flawlessly, describe the flavors and ingredients of each dish. He also served a complimentary taster of some sort of creme fraiche with a balsamic reduction, and a choice of bread (we liked the kalamata olive) with butter and rosemary salt, and olive oil. Per CominciareI ordered ""Curdo di Passera,"" which was a fresh, raw, white fish covered in sturgeon caviar and a lemon juice to balance the flavors. Boyfriend had ""Torchon,"" since it had his beloved foie gras. All the elements of torchon combined made for such a full and satisfying taste, which could not be satisfied by eating each ingredient separately.Pasta E RisottoI ordered ""Trofie Nero,"" since I had to see why it was by far the most frequently mentioned dish here. Squid ink has a slightly salty taste, and complimented the bits of seafood well. However, I didn't find it as life-changing as many of the reviews stated. Boyfriend had ""Corzetti,"" which had a very traditional Italian flavor. It had sausage, ricotta, and a wonderful tomato and basil sauce.PesceBoyfriend ordered ""Astice."" The lobster was so perfectly tender, that we now believe all the other lobster we've had before have been woefully overcooked. Our only gripe was that the portion was half the size of my protein dish. CarneI ordered ""Agnello."" My first thought was that the red wine sauce smelled overpowering and tickled my nose. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised, and soon relished in medium rare lamb that was hardly gamey. One slice of chanterelle tasted oddly woody, and I don't think the lemon juice over the vegetables were necessary. But overall, this was an outstanding meat dish. DolciI ordered a ""Semifreddo,"" which featured a mandarin mousse, a citrus-y sorbetto, the tiniest assortment of citrus fruits, and a white chocolate twist. I savored each tangy, fruity bite. While I do not typically like white chocolate, the twist was light and not too sweet.Boyfriend asked our third waiter for a non-chocolate-heavy recommendation from the waiter, who then proceeded to point out his favorite 3 chocolate dishes. In the end, he ordered the Tartaletta anyway. ServiceOur first waiter was fantastic, but throughout our dinner, we had a second, and even a third waiter. None introduced themselves, and the latter two were not as efficient in clearing our plates promptly. The restaurant was not at capacity, nor did we see the waiters occupied at all times, so there was no excuse. My boyfriend even heard one waiter sniff each time he passed our table (perhaps he needed a tissue to wipe away his snootiness?). As we left, the girl who brought our checked-in items was stone-faced. Maybe she suffered from RBF, but her blasé demeanor was not appreciated. Not to mention the group of servers giggling to themselves at the cash register and sneaking glances over at us exhibited unprofessional behavior at a ""high-class"" restaurant.TLDR: Our food was exceptional; the service was not.",1,0,0,Sophia C.,"San Gabriel, CA",208,61,13

Like when you get stuck in an elevator with an axe spray bro, but constant. As I type, my sinuses are sore. The food is excellent. Astonishing squash soup, daring pasta.  But the average by-the-glass red wine is $26. I eat at a lot of top nyc restaurants, and that's very steep. The staff bumbles. Maybe the small crowd on Saturday night had them stumbling over one another, but not a sophisticated group. Our appetizers were barely off the tablecloth before the pasta appeared. My companion said, ""We just barely finished our first course,"" and the server took it as a compliment to his efficiency.

We werent seated until 6:35 pm, big minus in my book when a restaurant make you wait 20 mins past your reservation time.  Once we were seated the service was pretty fast though.  The restaurant is big and the seats are super comfortable!  We got the lobster soup and fluke crudo as appetizer, the soup was very rich and full of seafood flavor but there was only 3 tiny pieces of lobster meat in it, the crudo was fresh and a lot thicker than what I am used to.  I was really excited to try their famous trofie nero (squid ink pasta) but I ended up being very disappointed, I dont know if that's how the dish was suppose to be but they put soo much lemon juice that all i tasted was the acidity, I definitely had much better squid ink pasta elsewhere.For main entree I got their long island duck.  They cooked the duck perfectly, its extremely moist with the perfect gamey taste, its as good as the duck breasts I had in paris! I would come back just to have their duck entree again.I had a good time at Ai Fiori but for a one michelin star restaurant, I wasnt really blown away by their food.  Everything tasted pretty good but nothing was really that extraordinary except the long island duck which was really good.  However I couldnt get past the fact we waited 20 mins for our table with no apology or simple acknowledgement....normally I wouldnt mind as much but for a high end restaurant with such a high price tag, they should be able to do a better job at time management.  We ended up spending $400 for 2 people which is not a big deal but I left the restaurant feeling underwhelmed...",0,0,0,Kerri O.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",85,181,1003

Luckily for me I was allowed to share that experience with my fiance and his family for Christmas lunch.We arrived about half an hour before our reservation time (1pm), and were unable to to be seated. It was fine because it gave us time to take some pictures with the lovely Christmas decor. The hostess offered to take our jackets and the bartenders offered us beverages while we waited. We were seated and offered their four course prix fixe Christmas menu. When taking our drink order the waiter asked us several times if we wanted flat or sparkly. I think he asked my fiance 3-4 times before finally getting it.I ordered the lobster soup, pork shoulder ravioli, poached lobster, and the peppermint ice cream/gelato for dessert. Lobster soup came with about 4 small pieces of lobster, which was expected for places like this. Flavor was rich and creamy. Ravioli came with about 5-6 pieces. It was ridiculously SALTY and dry looking. Definitely did not look like it was made in house. I had to force myself to finish the last piece because I hate wasting food. The other people in my party also agreed their dishes were way over salted and complained to our waiter. He said that they tend to use alot of salt in their dishes and would ask the chef to use less in our main course. The best dish was probably the poached lobster tail. It wasn't too salty, and it came out very tender. The peppermint gelato was good, but a little too sweet for my liking. My fiance ordered the lemon custard that had a few fingerprints in the middle. You could clearly see the ridges of the person's fingers. We asked the waiter for a new one. He apologized and assured us that all the kitchen staff wear gloves when preparing the food.  They said they would get a new one, but it looked like they scraped off the top of it. Although the staff were professional and accommodating, they all seemed lifeless with no personality. There were just a few small details in their presentation of the food and clean up that seemed a little sloppy to me. My fiance pointed out that they had to work on Christmas day, and there was nothing to be happy about. Even so, you still have to keep in mind that you have to behave a certain way at work.

I don't eat veal for personal reasons, but the sauce was delicious. Entrees :1) Spigola (olive oil poached striped bass, baby fennel à la grecque, clam vinaigrette)2) Capesante (pan seared sea scallops, beluga lentils, baby carrots, pancetta)3) Bouillabaisse (saffron broth, langoustine, scallops, bouchot mussels)4) Anatra (long island duck, apple mostarda, tuscan kale, hazelnuts, cipollini onion)5) Tagliata (prime dry aged strip loin, endive, potato terrine, ""cacio e pepe,"" balsamico, bordelaise)- the duck stole the night. The flavor was amazing and it was cooked to perfection. I was a little disappointed by the spigola (which was recommended over the sea bass by our waiter) which lacked flavor.

The fava beans infused in the panna cotta was a definite twist on the typical dessert I'm so use to. The light flavor and soft texture was a great kick start to the meal.Crispy Veal Sweetbreads -- Light and crispy. The veal was extremely mild in flavor with just a hint of sweetness from the breading. The veal was juicy and so soft, it was almost like eating deep-fried butter.Trofie Nero -- Ai Fiori's illustrious squid ink pasta. They use a thicker flat pasta, mixed with a light, yet creamy, crustacean ragu. It is mixed with baby scallops and spices. Such a simple dish but it can go either really right or really wrong. Ai Fiori's version hit it out of the ball park. I actually prefer their version over Babbo's. It's a lot less oily and packs so much more flavor.What a great experience that was had here!

4.0,11/26/2014,"Decor: 4/5I wouldn't describe it as "" impressive"" but defiantly ""elegantly comfortable"". A huge glass door and enlarged spiral staircase, you can feel the ambition of the interior architect of making this restaurant a higher class dining place. It's not your kind of neo-classical interior design though. Some flowers and bushes pictures on the wall degenerate the grace, and the views of hustle and bustle 5th ave aren't quite pleasant. But hey, we still have views for beautiful platings and food presentations. Service: 4/5Enthusiastic. Even though I had been transferred many times while making a phone reservation. However it's tolerable comparing with snobby uptown girl's accent and attidude at Daniels, which just degraded from Michelin three starred to two starred. Food:4.2/5It was one summer restaurant week lunch time I came here to try. Who can resist $25 for three courses in a Michelin restaurant? Ai Fiori was on mine"" coming back"" list of restaurants. Recently discovered their Sunday buffet, $35 all you can eat and $65 plus an a la carte. Options of buffet are limited but the quality of food is excellent. Mixed seafood salad with large scallopes, shrimps and calamaris. Freshly made yogurt and jams. Various cheeses and pastries. The only thing it's there is no drinks for the buffet.

1.0,11/22/2014,How can a restaurant charge so much for so little? One enters this well decorated group of rooms with high expectations and leaves merely with a high bill. What a disappointment. A stylish captain recites the menu as if he was describing the wonderful inheritance left to you by your long lost uncle. Then out comes a mini mess of an appetizer...chewy over-cooked tasteless octopus. Next comes a reasonably good spicy spaghetti with small bits of clam. Then a fatty undercooked veal chop arrives lacking in both size and flavor. This is all part of thei four courses prix fixed at $97 per person. The selection of cheeses for dessert was okay. But the French press coffee was excellent! The room was almost full. So what do I know?,0,0,1,Alan B.,"Belvedere Tiburon, CA",0,24,0
4.0,11/20/2014,"I've been to a few of Michael White's establishments and this remains my favorite. The decor is modern classic and easily one of my favorite restaurants to meet up with someone for a nice dinner. Monday was my first time dining in a private room though, and that too had been a pleasant experience.The meal started off with an array of bread selections - solid, but wish that they were served warm (there's seldom chance that warm bread won't be good). Then came the amuse bouche, which was a cheese panna cotta topped with grapes. A delightful beginning but it didn't leave much of an impression after that bite.Ordered the foie gras as my appetizer: it was served with two small slices of warm, toasted brioche (a win in itself already), and mustard seeds (I think), balsamic vinegar, pecan and Seckel pear. Yes, smear that foie! I personally like to eat foie with heavier seasoning (this was rather light in terms of flavor, which has its merits) but the balsamic + pear + mustard seeds profile highlighted the foie. No complaints here - I'm a happy camper any time there's foie.I ordered the tagliata as my entree. Dry-aged steak can do no wrong, although mine was cooked medium and not medium well. What really impressed me was the scalloped potato on the side. A bit too salty, but it was shaved paper-thin and there were probably 20 layers stacked into each of the two small piles. That's something I'd recreate at home to impress dinner guests; what a brilliant touch that was.Got the mille feuille to end the meal. It's an interpretation of mille feuille and not what I had in mind with tens of layers of pastry - more like a whipped mousse with some layers of crunchy bits in between. Solid, but not anything to write home about.The sommelier was knowledgeable and guided us to pick some excellent wines, and the cocktail I had - forgot its name but there's gin and cranberry juice in it - was fun.",0,0,0,Michelle L.,"Manhattan, NY",21,13,16

5.0,11/3/2014,"Walking into Ai Fiori, it feels like one of those glitzy vibe gangster clubs from the 40s. Very sultry and classy. I was expecting a cigarette girl to come up to me! Another home run hit from Chef Michael White who created this Michelin-starred Italian restaurant.And Italian it is, I had the best pasta dish in my life last week. Better than what I had at Marea, this dish brought tears to my eyes. Lets back up. I walk into the restaurant, lunch is over but I really wanted to try the hamburger everyone is raving about. I'm told, the hamburger is only offered on their lunch menu, I can see if sliders are available. Nah, I've been waiting for this pasta dish so lets get crackalackin'.Very well, bread sir? The wait staff are true professionals. I've had a few of them saying I have to come back for the burger. It's amazing, try to come back for lunch, etc.. I tell the waiter my bread basket story at Marea. I'm told not to worry, they have a few bread choices as well as olive oil for dipping. Amazing bread by the way! Now my entree comes out. The Trofie Nero Squid Ink Pasta.This dish was pure perfection. Pasta intertwined with seafood, its tasted like heaven. Is that Panko on top? Each bite was telling a story. I can only describe it by reading a book and going through all the chapters.When I was finished, I knew I tasted greatness. I was packed, no room for dessert.

1.0,10/22/2014,"This was our sixth Michelin Star restaurant in six weeks in NYC and we were looking forward to it. We had been to Marea and had an amazing meal and so we had high hopes for its sister restaurant. We were thoroughly disappointed with mediocre food and bad service. How these guys kept their star when Gordon Ramsey lost his is a mystery. Give me dinner at The London over this anyday.We were seated and ordered a glass of wine whilst we chose from the menu and made a bottle choice. My wine was poured and then the waited returned because as he admitted he had not given me a correct 'pour'. OK I thought, at least he admitted it. We ordered food and a bottle of red. We were server a lovely amuse bouche  followed by our starters. My husbands lobster soup was just lukewarm. he didn't complain as he just thought that was how they served it. That was until the table next to us were served theirs with steam coming from it. Of course it was too late at this point so we said nothing. My poached egg and chantrelle mushrooms was delicious.After our stater plates were cleared a waiter came to sweep up crumbs, we politely explained that there couldn't possible be any as unlike the tables either side of us we hadn't been offered bread. This was obviously passed on as when our pasta course arrived we were then offered bread.Seriously!! The pasta was delicious. This is apparently Chef Whites speciality and my advice to anyone going here would be to steer clear of the 4-course menu and just go for the pasta. My husband had the bolognese bianco (corzetti) and I had the blue crab spaghetti. Both were excellent.Our main courses arrived and mine- Agnelllo,  had been served up on a cold plate which meant that by the time I had eaten most of one of the pieces of lamb the veg and the second piece were cold. It didn't worry me however because I didn't want to eat anymore. The lamb was wrapped in a skin and had been coated in foie gras (I thing) and was too rich as it was also covered in a sticky sauce. It was really not a very pleasant dish. My husband had the strip loin which he said was OK.During dinner I had twice been left with an empty wine glass as our bottle was too far away for us to serve ourselves. No one else appeared to care, except when a waitress asked me if I'd like to order another glass of wine. When I explained I'd quite like to have some from the bottle we ordered this prompted some action. REALLY. Should I have to do this in a restaurant of this level ??Dessert was another disappointment. My husband ordered Mille Feuille however what arrived was two thin slices of chocolate with a chocolate / nut mouse in-between. Nothing at all like a mille feuille. The manager did come over and apologise to us, but it was to be quite honest too little too late.

We had two of the best pasta dishes I've ever had - the trofeo and the spaghetti - but the rest was really lackluster. The mains: veal chop and steak were very underwhelming. Veal chop was overdone, lacked both prosciutto and sage as described in the dish. The desserts were equally unimpressive, as if the restaurant does not have a pastry chef and just another cook making run of the mill desserts.

What I found out was that they curl little linguini like pasta around a dowel about the thickness of a pencil by hand, to create these tightly spiraled noodles, blackened with squid ink I believe.

5.0,8/12/2014,"The Boyfriend and I have been extremely interested in the Altamarea Group ever since he had a great meal at Marea after our graduation from college. We recently dined at All'onda, whose chef used to work under the Altamarea Group and we were blown away by how good the pasta was. So when Restaurant Week Summer edition rolled around, I quickly made reservations for Ai Fiori, one of the restaurants under the Altamarea Group. Ai Fiori boasts one Michelin Star, so we went in with high expectations.We arrived early for out 11:45am reservation (we had a matinee show on Broadway afterwards so I wanted to give us ample time) and were told to wait in the lounge area. A few minutes later, we were seated - the first ones in the entire restaurant! But the other tables filled up pretty quickly during our meal, so I'd say they're pretty popular! We were greeted by our waiter with menus - both a la carte and Restaurant Week clearly marked.After we made our order, which our waiter didn't even bat an eyelid to, our seating plates were taken away and bread was brought to our table. I want to comment on this - they come around and give you two pieces of bread. Around 20 minutes later, when our appetizers arrived, they came around again to give us more bread. We both really liked this because sometimes it's such a hassle just to get bread at other restaurants. At Ai Fiori, bread just appeared on our bread plates! Ps. The bread was also really good - super soft!I went with the Zuppa di Zucchini, or chilled zucchini soup with basil and lemon. I'm a huge fan of chilled soups so this was extra enjoyable for me. The soup was nicely flavored and had a hint of spice. With each spoonful you get a nice kick of heat but it doesn't linger.The Boyfriend decided on the Terrina di Maiale, or house-made pate. The presentation was lovely, but one gripe that we had was the lack of baguette! There was one tiny piece for the entire square of pate! Lack of baguette aside, the pate was delicious - stiffer than other pates that we've had but still very enjoyable.For my entrée, I opted for the Pollo Arrosto, or pan-roasted chicken with polenta, pancetta, corn and hen jus. The chicken was moist and flavorful - there was a hint of herbs and lemon in every bite. The polenta was just soft enough and tasted really good when mixed up with the pancetta, mushrooms and corn bits. I wished there was more!The Boyfriend opted for the Tagliatelle, which featured house-made pasta with capers, taggiasca olives and tomato. The pasta itself was cooked al dente and tasted fresh. But it was the sauce that really made the dish shine. The sauce was superb! The capers and olives really gave the standard tomato sauce a burst of flavor. The pasta was so good that he even declared Ai Fiori his favorite Restaurant Week meal to date (and we've had Dovetail, Nobu and Capital Grille!).For my dessert, I went with the Crema di Cioccolato, or dark chocolate and coffee mousse with vanilla ice cream. I really liked the mousse - it was firm but not too much. The use of dark chocolate ensured that the mousse wasn't too sweet and the ice cream helped sweeten up the bitterness of the dark chocolate and coffee flavors.We both opted to have a glass of white wine with our meal - they offered a white and a red wine for $10.00 extra on top of their Restaurant Week menu. They bring it over, offer you a taste and then pour a very generous glass if you approve. The wine was from 2006 so it's almost a teenager in wine terms! We both enjoyed it and thought it paired very well with our dishes.Service was impeccable - our water glasses were never empty and bread appeared on our plates without prompting. Our dishes came in a timely manner - we had just the right amount of time between courses to chat and slowly savor our food. We never felt rushed at all. I would definitely love to come back for a regular meal outside of Restaurant Week!",3,1,0,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",367,1165,1125
3.0,8/12/2014,"My family was visiting me in NY from Brazil, therefore I decided to take them to a nice restaurant to welcome my family to NY. I have been to Ai Fiori two other times and I have had good experiences. However, this time our experience was below average. Our waiter Adam took 10 minutes before serving us water and the menu. My family and I were pretty hungry specially after an 11 hour flight. After we decided on our dishes, Adam was not around to take our order. It took around 15 minutes of wait until we asked a lady to take our order. She was very pleasant and nice to cover for Adam. After we have ordered the food, Adam came with the glass of wine and that's all he did. The dishes were brought by the staff inside and the dessert we order with another waiter that was available from the other table.  Adam would come once in a while to ask how the food is. Of course, the food is amazing. It's AI FIORI! But we were hoping for a better service at such a good restaurant that I have always recommended to my friends, but now with this bad service experience, I will probably suggest other restaurants instead. My expectations for Ai Fiori are high because I think they can do better. I hope the service improves overtime to make justice to the delicious food at Ai Fiori.",0,0,0,Mimi F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0

5.0,8/8/2014,"While I don't frequent this beautiful palace as much as I'd like to, when I think of a fine dining establishment; this is my mental picture.Located on the second floor of Langham Place (formerly the Setai) is Ai Fiori, an icon of dining at its finest. The venue is absolutely gorgeous. The bar is chic and filled with a diverse crowd. The main dining area is on par with elegant accents and the staff is nothing short of world-class.The moleche (soft shell crab) is plated beautifully and while crisp retains its moist crab meat. The polpo (octopus) was cooked just as well and each bite was very tasty. The pastas is what stood out the most to me.The trofie nero is as delicious as all the reviews say but the spaghetti does it for me. It's fresh made spaghetti with a generous portion of blue crab which blends perfect with the bottarga and chillies. I could eat bowls upon bowls of this and keep going. The lobster tail entree was one of the most succulent tails I've ever eaten. Soft and tender with just sweet robster. Yes, robster.Surprisingly though, the torta di olio (olive oil cake) was one of the best desserts I've ever had. The cake is moist and tastes amazing with the strawberry sorbetto.Great place for a special occasion or if you're looking to grab a quick bite at the bar and mingle with the crowd.",2,1,1,Patrick W.,"New York, NY",226,178,709

The tagliata (steak), ippoglosso (halibut), zuppa di zucchine were good and the flavors were balanced but weren't exceptional. Surprisingly, the dessert was the best part. It was fun to crack the sugar off the torta di olio but nothing prepared me for the delightful flavors of the creme glacee. If you could put heaven on a plate, this is probably as close as you're going to get. I was also shocked by how spacious the restaurant was, especially the private dining room that wraps around the back of the restaurant. The wine display made a great focal point for the room and enticed me to order more drinks than I ordinarily would. Unsurprisingly, the service and presentation was excellent, as you'd expect from any Michelin rated establishment. The staff was courteous without being pretentious and the seating areas by the bar encourages you to stay for drinks after dinner.

5.0,7/10/2014,"Some of my favorite experiences in NYC have been unexpected; winning the Broadway lottery to The Book of Mormon, accidentally crashing Neil Patrick Harris's birthday party last year at Sleep No More (and stealing a goodie bag of candy), and as of last night, tasting the divine decadence served at Ai  Fiori.Located at 36th and 5th Avenue inside Langham Place, Chef Michael White's glorious menu truly provides every guest with the kind of satisfaction usually only found in the bedroom.Foreplay:The Crudo di Passera- raw fluke, meyer lemon, and a sumptious helping of American sturgeon caviar is layered like a fabulously colorblocked Vogue spread. The result is completely sensual, and honestly, a little bit naughty. What I loved was the initial impact of flavor immediately supplemented by hundreds of caviar bubbles literally melting their flavorful ooze into your mouth, which, while amazing, left me feeling like I had just climaxed in a room full of strangers.All Night Long:Trofie Nero- a squid ink pasta, ligurian crustacean ragu, seppia, scallops, and spiced mollica. Nothing makes a pasta great like my favorite nautical excrement! The pasta is thoughtfully coiled to capture all the pieces of finely chopped seafood so that you get an equally full-flavored bite... every time.Vitello- Amish veal chop ""au four"", new potatoes, prosciutto, sage.  Now this is what I'm talking about! A perfect, medium rare veal chop. This dish might just be my new favorite piece of meat. No pun intended- by that I mean that I simply might surrender my love of filet mignon. Accompanied by a beautiful stack of potatoes mashed with prosciutto and sage, this dish has all the requirements to meet the filling satisfaction of a home cooked meal, but with the sophistication only found on Fifth Avenue.The Big Finish:Budino di Cioccolato-  a high percentage milk chocolate budino, inserted with amaro gelee, on top of a chocolate presse.  The dish is garnished with tempered dark chocolate, a biscuit tuille, more amaro gelee, fried hazelnuts, and dots of meyer lemon meringue. This might actually be one of the best things I've ever eaten, almost solely by the virtue of lemon meringue dollops that literally punched my mouth with a sinfully enjoyable tartness. Let's get one thing straight, I usually don't prefer citrus as a dessert, but this! I almost felt robbed by the fact I didn't have a gallon of the, I daresay almost garnish. Oh yeah, the chocolate mousse was great too, as was the gelato, presentation etc... but I left wondering ""How the hell can I find a way to binge on nothing but that meringue!""",3,1,1,Jacob P.,"New York, NY",41,7,0

The entrees were a bit of a mixed bag though.  The GF's pork shoulder ravioli was good...perfectly light pasta with a not-overpowering pork shoulder filling.  And Mom's olive oil poached swordfish with an anchovy vinaigrette was exceptional.  Light without the overpowering anchovy expectation.  The Branzino (Sea Bass with stuffed calamari, olives, soppressata) was a let-down for me.  Overwhelmingly salty all around that the sea bass lost its presence.  Desserts were very good yet....not memorable.  Service was exceptional and, with the exception of the bartender taking our drink order who was a bit stuck-up, generally upbeat, timely, present and knowledgeable.  Atmosphere is not particularly trendy.  Think dark woods in a 2nd floor hotel dining room.  But all in all..it served our purpose of enjoying a leisurely Sunday evening dinner....",0,0,0,Rob L.,"King of Prussia, PA",0,31,4

The staff were all helpful and friendly however giving advice on the meals. Some of the main meals we had ordered were more flavoursome than others such as the fish meals whereas the pasta meal that I had wasn't the most filling or the best of choices in hindsight.

4.0,5/19/2014,"This past Friday was my birthday and my folks and my girlfriend and I went here for dinner.  We'd heard good things but even so our expectations were exceeded.  The first thing I must mention is our exceptional server captain, Joe.  He was by far the finest server any of us have had, and his passionate, enthusiastic and accurate descriptions of the various dishes had us all tasting the food before we'd even ordered.  Joe's exemplary service went from our seating to the final pouring of a second glass of dessert wine, and he was attentive without nagging.The food was excellent.  The soup, the pastas, the risotto and the meats were all as good as could be, with particular love for the rack of lamb, which was the highlight.  Dessert cheeses were delicious and the port and medeira were also lovely.  We each were smiling (and stuffed) on the way out. Also, the sommelier was knowledgeable and helpful, able to synthesize our somewhat conflicting desires into a bottle that satisfied us all quite well.  The bar makes some interesting cocktails, too.Finally, the decor was elegant but modern, and both my mother and girlfriend were particularly impressed by the floral arrangements and artwork.  It was also spaced well so conversation was easy without much ambient noise.A perfect place for special occasions or just to satisfy urgings for terrific food and wine.",0,0,0,Mark B.,"New York, NY",0,9,0

5.0,5/12/2014,A really great place pretty much in every respect. Absolute top quality ingredients prepared perfectly. I had the squid appetizer and the Amish veal chop. Both fabulous. The chef has a light hand and makes the main ingredient the star of the dish. If you like a bucket of heavy sauce on everything this is not the place for you. This probably accounts for some of the bad reviews from folks expecting typical Italian with sauce and cheese on everything. A grabbed a taste of my wife's duck and again just top quality prepared to let the taste of the duck shine. I got more of a country French vibe from the food than Italian.  My kind of place and I certainly understand what they are going for. I would stick to a light bodied red wine a big Barolo would be to much. I chose a nice light Italian red and at $95 was pretty well priced for NYC.

They don't have a complicated menu by any means so it's not difficult to quickly find what you want and dive right in. I've consistently ordered the squid ink pasta which is absolutely delicious.What sticks out to me is how great their service is, from the moment you walk in and the hostess smiles with a warm welcome to the moment they give you your coat when you leave, Ai Fiori service is among the best.

The pork shoulder ravioli was light and succulent.Each of the entrees; duck breast, branzino, and butter poached lobster was simply delicious. The course that would make a foodie drool however was the olive cake,which was truly an out of this world strawberry shortcake in disguise.

When we walked in, I was so impressed by the decor. It was very dark and very classy and fancy looking. We started off with the Torchon, foie gras au natural, an apricot mostarda, marcona almonds and toasted brioche. We didn't realize that the toasted brioche cost extra. I mean it was totally worth it because the foie gras was amazing and buttery and tasted even better with the brioche.Since we had never tried squid ink pasta before we both ordered the Trofie Nero. Which is squid ink pasta with scallops and spiced mollica and seafood ragu. Oh my gosh, this dish lived up to its hype. Joe and I were both were scrapping our plates for more. This dish was sooooooooooo delicious! And so unique! I've never had squid ink pasta before in my life.Joe's sister eats here often and so she wanted to try something besides her usual squid ink pasta. She got the Long Island duck, foie gras, apples, chestnuts and mustard greens. I got to try a bite and this was a very savory dish.We got complimentary dessert truffles with our meal.

5.0,3/16/2014,"Buffet? At a Michelin-starred restaurant?This sounded too good to be true, but it really was as excellent as you would expect from a Michael White restaurant.When you come for Sunday Brunch, you get live music, an unlimited buffet of tons of breads, pastries and other foods, and an entire entree, for just $64. Yes, that is a lot of money, but considering all that you get, it's not too bad at all.Located on the second floor of a hotel, with large windows overlooking the street, this is a really beautiful place. From the moment you step in to the warm greetings, you can tell why this is a Michelin-starred restaurant.They escorted us to our table in the luxurious, spacious dining room. It's refreshing and surprising to see such a large, wide open restaurant in NYC. The closest tables were far enough away that we weren't forced to listen to some annoying conversations.We ordered pretty quickly, eager to head over to the buffet. This was a buffet like none other I've ever seen, as everything was of the highest quality. It's a beautiful presentation of some really excellent food. I easily ate more than $64 worth alone in croissants, chocolate croissants, muffins, smoked salmon, and a bunch of other Italian meats and other stuff.Once I was officially way too full, the entrees arrived. Unbelievably, they have all of the great dishes they are known for including in this menu. For one of them, we tried the Rigatoni ala Carbonara, which was really great. The pasta was perfectly al dente and chewy, and the sauce was so creamy and rich. What looks like a small portion is actually very satisfying given how much flavor and richness it packs.For the other entree, we of course went with the White Label Burger, which has been praised several times over the past few years as being one of the best burgers in NY. This was a seriously intense burger: an 8 oz. prime patty with bacon marmalade, Nueske's bacon, American Cheese and a perfect fried egg on top. It's a large burger that's tough to manage without really getting your hands dirty, mostly due to the runny egg oozing all over, but it's totally worth the mess, and it really is one of the best burgers I've had. It's also served with a side of pommes dauphine, which were so creamy and rich that they really sent me over the edge. This was an incredibly delicious and overwhelming entree.Even though we were absolutely stuffed, we of course had to make a final trip (or two) back to the buffet to check out the dessert selections. I was again shocked to see how much high quality stuff was included: there was fresh fruit, a fruit tart, Vanilla Mille Feuille, Almond Brioche, and the popular Olive Oil Cake. The few bites of everything I tried was really great, especially the soft, tasty Olive Oil Cake and the Almond Brioche.As mentioned above, service was perfect too. I don't know what the normal lunch/dinner is like here, but if you like both quality and quantity, the Sunday Brunch can't be beat.",20,7,8,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834

4.0,3/9/2014,"It wasn't without some trepidation that I came to Ai Fiori for lunch during Restaurant Week. My prior visit to Marea was nothing short of impressive, and I knew what Michael White was capable of. Throw in Restaurant Week and a completely revamped menu into that mix, however, and the results become far less certain. At the end of the day, I eventually gave in. After all, what did I have to lose?On a Friday afternoon, I found myself skipping out early from work (with a loose ""prior appointment"" excuse to justify my departure) and entering the (former) Setai Hotel. Getting to the actual restaurant requires going up a flight of winding stairs where a pair of glass doors will give you your first peek into the bar area. We were greeted by the hostess and seated within a few minutes of our reservation; timeliness is much appreciated, especially during the lunch hour when most people have meetings and deadlines to return to afterwards. Our server made sure our glasses were filled with water and brought over menus, making special note of the three-course Restaurant Week menu. As each course offers 2-3 options each, I made my decision with little difficulty and we soon started in on the bread and butter that was placed in front of us.For my first course, I opted for the Zuppa di Zucchine. It's not one of my favorite vegetables, but I was won over almost immediately by the presentation. The bowl contained slivers of zucchini and chopped chive rounds, all submerged in a creamy, yet delicate zucchini soup. The texture was unbelievably smooth, the hints of basil and lemon added additional dimensions of flavor and acidity, and I was impressed with the overall execution of this seemingly basic dish.My second course, the Gamba di Pollo, arrived shortly afterwards and it was probably one of most creative arrangements I have seen of this simple protein. Three pieces of pan roasted chicken are distributed across the plate and in between them is a small serving of Cipollini onions and roasted garlic as well as a preparation of fregola, a pasta that bears the most resemblance to couscous. The chicken was done well; the skin was crispy, the white meat tender, and the seasoning just right. The additional garnishes added texture to balance out the plate, and the purée of piquillo peppers provided some much needed spice. While the portion size is on the smaller side, it's a good choice for a lunch entrée.And no meal is complete without dessert. I shied away from the chocolate option and decided on the Panna Cotta. It was a gorgeously presented dessert with a taste to match its appearance. The panna cotta was executed well and the hints of lemon in each bite provided the perfect backdrop to the raspberries and pomegranate seeds. The small spoonful of crushed pistachios was a smart addition, providing some much-needed crunch and texture to the dish.While I wasn't blown away by lunch at Ai Fiori, I was pleasantly surprised by the overall execution of all three dishes I sampled. Perhaps it helped that I had already tempered my expectations prior to arrival; for a $25 lunch, it was more than I had hoped for. Considering how well Ai Fiori has handled the basics, I look forward to returning and trying some of the dishes from their full menu.",6,3,4,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

De li cious !!! Be aware thats 56$Lobster VealThe waiter proposed the veal medium rare which was to my mind gonna be a pink color meat but it actually came rare (the veal chop is super thick i guess thats why) and i asked to get it more cooked: they took it back and re did the full dish which came perfectly cooked. No extra charge for that. Again all ingredients were perfect and the dishes tasted very good and provided Chocolate VacherinI recommend the vacherin.

5.0,3/8/2014,"If you look at my history of YELP reviews,  I rarely award 5 stars to a restaurant. There is usually always one aspect lacking wherein I have to deduct 1 star. However, my experience last night at Ai Fiori was spot on and perhaps I may have just been lucky to have ordered the right dishes - but hey, if they did it right for me I am perfectly happy to award a 5 star rating. Here's my rundown-AMBIANCE:Modern, formal decor. I prefer old-school type restaurants and I was surprised that despite the modern art paintings lining the walls, there was still a warm vibe to the place. SERVICE:Our waiter was moderately flamboyant (that's a good thing). He was attentive throughout the night without being overbearing. I loved that he was knowledgeable about every dish I inquired about. I am the type of diner that will ask that question ""I can't decide between xxx and xxx, which do you recommend?"" Our waiter (I wish I had asked for his name) was able to give me a detailed description- so detailed I think he should be writing YELP reviews to entice foodies. BREAD BASKET:As always, the bread basket at any restaurant can make or break it for me so it gets a category on its own. Ai Fiori served 4 selections of bread - white, onion, multigrain and wheat. They also gave us BOTH butter and olive oil at the table which was perfect because I feel that it is usually one or the other. My boyfriend prefers olive oil whereas I'm a butter fan =) - so we both got what we wanted without having to ask. Also, the waiters are super quick to offer you more bread the moment they see you've finished the first - thumbs up for the attentiveness!FOOD:Overall, Ai Fiori wins HANDS DOWN for its seafood and pasta dishes. And I'm not the only Yelper to note this. Also, I noticed that the dishes here (aside from the pastas) are all somewhat deconstructed when presented on the plate. I had to make sure I scooped up the different components in every bite to ensure I was getting the full flavor of the dish. Amuse Bouche - a shot of apple parsley soup served with a crostini dashed with ricotta cheese. Great warm start for the cold weather. My boyfriend and I decided to go with the 4 course pre-fixe for $94. For starters, he ordered the warm octopus and I had the cold lobster salad. Both were excellent choices. For our pasta choices, my boyfriend chose the blue crab pasta and I went with the famous Trofie Nero. Both dishes were HEAVENLY. My Trofie Nero was creamy and the toasted breadcrumbs added a lovely crunchy to it. Now I'm going to echo another Yelper and say BEST BLUE CRAB PASTA EVERRRR!!! Because it truly was. It tasted like home made spaghetti elevated to a higher ""Top Chef"" level. It was comforting and had a spicy kick to it. Even at the end of my meal I secretly wanted to slurp up another bowl. For mains, my boyfriend had the butter poached lobster and I chose the halibut (my favorite fish! =)). I loved my halibut dish - the fish was cooked perfectly through and crusted on the surface. There may have been several different components to the dish that enhanced the flavor of the fish - but to be honest, I could have eaten the halibut all on its own. As for the butter poached lobster, that was just another glory on its own. I remember taking a bite of my boyfriend's dish and saying ""This is what they call BUTTER POACHED LOBSTER"". DESSERT: We tried the Panna Cotta and Crema di Cioccolato. The Panna Cotta was heavier in texture than what i'm used to, but still delicious. As for the Crema the Ciocoolato, this dish was just bursting with sweet and salty flavors all over the place. There was a salty foamed puffed on top of the sweet chocolate mousse cake and gelato. To end of our meal, we received four petit fours consisting a grapefruit gummy, dark chocolate, mini cake bite and salted caramel chocolate. And although I do not care for biscotti, we received a small take-home gift of biscotti's with our check. Don't you just love when restaurants know how to throw in that extra special touch? =) Perhaps the only minor downside is that portions are medium to small. I was concerned at first that I would end the meal feeling hungry, but I was surprisingly full. I think my boyfriend could have eaten a slice of pizza after the meal if he had to... but on the whole he was satisfied.

2.0,2/26/2014,"Langham Place Hotel, previously known as Setai New York Hotel, has been a gorgeous destination for contemporary elegance, thanks to construction execution and completion just before the international financial crisis of 2008 which could have left the place with less opulent finish.  The sleek Italian marble reception in front of the laid back lounge, and the spiral stairs leading (with the tear-drop statue) to the Ai Fiori of the Hotel's second floor, are of no exception.  A roomy bar scene of Carrara marble, pistachio velvet walls and sofas, ceiling with structured mirrors, and floors in beige marble with scattered carpet on the floor--adding depth and warmth to what might have been a cold space--were what welcomed me into the restaurant before the assertive, very-busy-looking hostess asked if I had a reservation.  ""Yes; at 1:15 PM, I suppose!"" was my reply.  I was escorted to my table after waiting for about 10 minutes in the bar area, taking in the details.  The restaurant was very busy, and full mostly of some retired socialites of the big apple, and some corporate cliental having their business lunch.  The lively photographs in painting presentations broke the darkish solid tone of the dining space, and so did the beautiful yellow orchids displayed on the tables and some of the walls (Yes!). The Insalata was the appetizer I picked out of the three available appetizers shown on the restaurant's special menu for the Restaurants Week--one was a butternut squash soup, and the other was a pate.  The salad had a straightforward approach; romaine lettuce, frisee, pickled carrots (sweet), a combination of three kinds of radishes cut differently, a lovely manchego cheese, and aged sherry vinaigrette (as what the menu stated).  The way the carrots and radishes were shaved and distributed over the greens made the salad look as though it was a green park whose paths were hosting a spread of petals of rose and daisy (romantically lovely!).The homemade tagliatelle pasta with parmesan and mascarpone, together with a bit of sautéed spinach was a shock.   The salty taste the pasta had was overwhelming, and the oily clotted ribbons constructing a sticky-ball structure was very much dull.  A restaurant with such a high rated culinary reputation should have created a much more sophistication in flavor than that of the pasta I had, in my humble opinion.My dessert that consisted of a dark chocolate mousse, salted caramel and vanilla gelato was nothing but fair.  The other choice I could have ordered as a dessert was a Panna Cotta. I was greeted warmly upon leaving, ending up it-could-have-been-much-better lunch experience.  Looking at the glass half full, though, my Manhattan culinary exposures were augmented by one!       (Review of Ai Fiori Lunch Visit on Monday, February 24th, 2014)",2,0,0,Victory O.,"Manhattan, NY",5,15,217

5.0,2/13/2014,"BEST BLUE CRAB PASTA EEEEVERR!!!came here twice.. once for the 4 course dinner and the most recent time-- just for the pasta :)so with that said, yes my favorite part about Ai Fiori is the pasta lol i've never had a pasta dish that presented so many levels in taste but at the same time carried the well balanced harmony between all the flavors! and topping it off, the climax is definitely brought by the pinch of spiciness accompanied by a kick of the lemon zest.  it's nice and creamy but not drenched in sauce.  not only does it not weight down your stomach, the splash of citrus makes it extremely appetizing.  i was completely mesmerized by the taste.  it was irresistible! i could only crave more and more until it's all slurped away... sad face.. ok back to reality~ the other dish that was vividly memorable was the pan seared scallops served over a bone marrow sauce.  scallops alone are delish!  but partnered with the flavor of the stigmatic bone marrow, it really brought out something completely unexpected to the table.  the taste of the bone marrow can be described as potent but smooth.  it is this lingering savory on the palate and mind.  it might be i have the lack of fine dining experience, but this was my first encounter with a dish incorporating bone marrow and i LOVED it!! i was surprised how well they complimented each other.  i suppose since scallops have a light but sweet scent of the sea~ the extract of the bone marrow amplified the savoriness and evolved the simple pan seared scallops into a signature dish.overall, i really enjoyed my 2 experiences at ai fiori! the white graceful ornate decor paired with matching plates creates this sophisticated ambiance that people look for when they travel to nyc.  the presentation of the food is no exception, it is also very charming and attractive.  ai fiori does a really good job in engaging all 5 senses to provide their guests with an experience they won't forget.waiters are very knowledgeable and really helpful with recommendations as they do offer a wide array of selections.  plates from the 2nd and 3rd course all feature a different kind of meat and fish to get you familiar and share what ai fiori, a renowned michelin star restaurant, has to offer.  i highly recommend dining here if you have not done so and definitely start with the tasting menu as your first time.",2,0,1,Kelly C.,"Marlton, NJ",270,418,674

5.0,2/2/2014,"Dined here last night. I often like to wait until the morning to write the review to See what memories are still lingering. We had the 7 course tasting menu with wine pairings and decided to supplement in order to try the black truffle tagliatelle. Wow. The food was exquisite, and the service was great. Our team was fun and very accommodating. They had personality and really seemed to enjoy opportunities to interact with us, whether it was making recommendations or soliciting and responding to feedback about our experience. The tasting menu allows a choice between 2 selections. for each course, and the wines were selected for our each of our pairings, however the somm actually worked with us since my friend had particular preferences. I went with his recommendations, and felt each were quite enjoyable.  She seemed quite happy with what he chose for her in the end and even produced a written list on her request for her to take home. Memorable dishes for me (ones that I'm still thinking about this morning ) included, the scallop course, the duck course with foie gras (perfection!) and the tagliatelle with black truffle. There was also a cauliflower panna cotta to start that was also delicious. Each of these stood out to me for preparation, but also the variety of tastes and textures within the dish, and how well they matched with the wine. The size of the tasting seemed perfect, even with the little extras.  You left feeling satisfied. It was the service that stood out to me as exceptional, and how the evening was a fun interactive event.  Even with the tasting menus, there is opportunity for customization.

3.0,1/16/2014,"KenScale: 7.5/10I've been to Ai Fiori, a Italian/Mediterranean restaurant from one of my favorite chefs Michael White on the second floor of Setai Hotel in Midtown, several times now. Every time I went, I walked out always feeling something was missing. Was it the hotel restaurant setting filled with old corporate crowd and hotel guests that turned me off on the entire experience? On a recent lunch, I really wanted to figure out why my experience at Ai Fiori has always been somewhat unsatisfying. When I dine at a restaurant, I overlook issues with restaurant ambiance or services (unless they are egregiously horrible) as long as the food gives me pleasure. My recent lunch finally gave me the answer I had long suspected: the food at Ai Fiori, while by no means bad, didn't have the greatness I would expect from a Michael White establishment. Normally, a two-course lunch for $42 per person at a Michael White restaurant would feel like a bargain, but I didn't feel that way.I started the meal with Vellutata featuring lobster velouté, Périgord black truffles and chervil. Lobster was well cooked and the broth of the dish was pretty flavorful. Unlike the great pastas at other Michael White restaurants, the pastas at Ai Fiori were overdressed without showing the kind of rich flavor I had at Marea. Trofie Nero pasta (with ligurian crustacean ragu, seppia, scallops and spiced mollica) and Agnolotti pasta (with braised veal parcels, butternut squash purée, brown butter, sage and black truffle sugo) were both serviceable, but the saltiness of Trofie Nero quickly overwhelmed me. Agnello (rack of lamb en crépinette, bagna càuda potatoes, leeks and chanterelles) was also underwhelming despite all the rave reviews about the dish I had come across before. While the meat was cooked well, it was by no means one of the most tender meats I've had, and the sauce overwhelmed my taste bud a little too much for me to savor the texture. I finished my lunch with Tartaletta di Cioccolato (with salted caramel and dark chocolate cremeux), a cute looking dish that was a tad too sweet for my taste.Being a hotel restaurant, Ai Fiori has a lot of older corporate crowds and hotel guests so the vibe isn't the most fun and youthful. Service during my lunch was spotty at times (it took me 10 minutes to catch my server to place orders). Getting a reservation here isn't a huge challenge, especially during lunch times. Ai Fiori, for a hotel restaurant, is certainly serviceable. It, however, doesn't have that ethereal quality of Marea or the rustic, hearty feel of Osteria Morini. If my friends want to get a taste of vintage Michael White cuisine, I would not hesitate to take them out to Marea or Osteria Morini instead.",2,1,2,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

4.0,12/11/2013,"What an indulgent, guilty pleasure. Came here for a nice dinner last week and splurged on the prix fixe four course meal with several glasses of wine. The service here is wonderful! The waiters are well coordinated and try to take your plates at the exact same time, our water glasses were never empty, and we were always quickly offered more wine each time we got close to finishing our glasses. The food was also enjoyable. It adds up to be a lot of food, but each course is a manageable size so by the end, you're definitely full, but not stuffed to the point where you can't eat anymore. They also space out the courses well so you get a short breather in between.I started with the Insalata di Astice, which every single person at my table ordered. We all enjoyed it. It was nice and light, and allowed us to ease our way into the richer food to come. The Marubini (pork shoulder ravioli) was delicious! The texture was perfect and the sauce was wonderfully flavored. I was originally worried that the pasta course would be way too heavy for me to get to the rest of the meal, but it was only four pieces that I easily could have eaten more of. Good thing I didn't though because the Spigola (wild striped bass) was perfectly cooked and plentiful in supply. It didn't wow me, but I did enjoy every last bite of it. By the time dessert came around, I was already full, but the Panna Cotta was calling to me. The sorbet added a nice touch and I just really enjoyed the fragrant flavors in the panna cotta. Really glad I opted for a lighter dessert instead of something chocolately. They also brought out little plates with some desserts, but I was way too full to try any of them.Really enjoyed dinner here and after looking at the other reviews, I definitely want to come back and try more of the pasta dishes.

2.0,12/9/2013,"WARNING: My friend got food poisoned from their lobster.I wonder if the chef was on his leave because my experience was beyond disappointing. We each ordered a $94 four course menu and got one appetizer, one pasta, one main course, and one dessert. Appetizer - Foie gras. The portion was almost too large for a first course that it killed the dish's delicacy. The caramelized onions on top was too sweet to swallow. It covered foie gras' freshness and fragrance (or maybe it was just not there without the onions). I'm a foie gras lover but this was too greasy for me to finish the plate. Pasta - Trofie Nero. Seriously what's the hype with this pasta? It was too salty and had a texture of uncooked flour dough. I can get squid ink pasta way better in taste and half in price. Main course - Steak. The steak was just decent, nothing impressive to please my taste bud. But an average dish was good enough to be the star of the night. My friend gave me a bite of her lobster and I sensed a fishy smell. Her stomach felt really weird on her way home, followed by a rough time in the bathroom. BEWARE OF THEIR SEAFOOD.Dessert - We picked 6 different desserts. They were either too sweet or too bland. The pear gelato was probably the best one because it tasted like pears.Service - One server mixed our orders so my friend and I had to exchange our pastas by our own hands. I understand this is a Michelin one-star restaurant so maybe I was just unlucky. But with a $150 bill I could get some top-notch sushi or buttery steaks.",0,0,0,Yichan W.,"New York, NY",222,9,0

It was very well done in terms of flavor, wish there was more seafood thought.  I had lots of this dish in France and flavorwise they nailed it.Agnello - Rack of lamb en crépinette, brussels sprouts, rutabaga, parsnip, marjoram. This place does it in a very interesting way.  They take lots of lamb meat, chop it up reconstitute it and stick it back on the bone.  Sounds wierd but the sauce was amazing.  Plus you get more meat this way.DessertCrema di Cioccolato - chocolate, nothing more to say.Service was impeccable.  Two of us stepped away to the restroom and four waiters were standing there with our desserts waiting for us to get back.  A bit weird but appreciated.  My sister didn't like her slightly undercooked fish, they took it back, made her a new dish and took the price of this entree off the bill.I think I might have gotten lucky with my choice of dishes, which all had supplements.  I loved all of them and had an amazing meal while sticking my fork or spoon into my friends dishes to try the other flavors.  Most of the dishes I tried or tasted were very good.  Overall, I would recommend this restaurant, you might have to order certain dishes to get the best experience though.",1,0,2,Tina Y.,"WALL STREET, NY",227,269,2984

My bf took me here for our anniversary dinner.  Would highly recommend as a date place -- after dinner we went to the langham hotel bar below the restaurant which had live jazz.The decor was very romantic and was lit by candlelight with flowers everywhere (true to the name of the restaurant).Our waiter was a very nice older gentleman -- who seemed to know a lot about the wine selection. The BF picked out a chianti and i picked a champagne (sorry wish i was more versed in drinks to rememerb which ones). We got the four course prix fixe -- which i thought was a very good deal. Decent portion sizes that you are not left hungry but also not completely stuffed.appetizers-- the octopus -- very tender and not rubbery at all.soft shell crab -- i think that is what he got ( id ont see it on the menu anymore so my memory might be off or they've since removed it)pastas ---the black ink pasta (Trofie nero) -- very rich flavors, and as everyone highlighted, one of their best dishes. had a crunch toppy which added a lot of texture too.my bf got the tortelli -- it was good but not as good as the trofie nero!entrees -- the  halibut -- very tender and the tomato confit added a very nice acidy/sweetness to the dish.aged strip loin -- im not a big red meat fan but my bf really enjoyed itdesserts (my fav) -- i got the olive oil cake -- absolutely delicious!!! good blend of flavors and textures. with a sorbet on the sidemy bf got the creme glacee (dark chocolate) -- very rich and also delicious",0,0,0,Cindy G.,"New York, NY",260,22,14

The other issue i had was with the wine.  I enjoyed the sommelier's recommendation, Guidalberto Toscana 2011, a bold complex and smooth southern Italian red, but it overpowered the otherwise bland cuisine.  Given the availability of other super premium Italian dining options in Manhattan, e.g. Scapetta's, I'm not sure Ai Fiori would be my first choice.",1,0,0,Allan S.,"Delray Beach, FL",96,285,19

Great location and upscale contemporary atmosphere. Excellent, friendly, and helpful hostess and servers. I chose a cocktail with the waiter's input that I loved. It was a lemony flavored vodka drink with a hint of cayenne pepper topped with a fresh sage leaf. Yummy, light, and original. Stop reading here if you want to fall in love with this restaurant!  We ordered a bottle of a Cabernetish Italian wine. Although the Sommelier assisted us it struggled to achieve mediocrity. Zucchini soup followed. It looked beautiful but lacked any discernible flavor. Lobster risotto was good but I have the notion I could fairly easily recreate this dish at home. Since I am a pushover for a delicious veal chop I ordered it as my entree. Tender and perfectly cooked to my specifications but again...boring and completely uninspired ? sauce/glaze. Had I prepared that dish at home I would toss/burn/shred the recipe and look for another. The servings were more than adequate for me and although I'm small, I am a dinner girl and have a healthy appetite by the end of the day.

The waiter came over, apologized and took it back to the kitchen. When he came back, he stated that the kitchen staff had scoured over the dish and did not find a hair. I assure you there was a hair in the dish. At restaurants of this caliber, I would expect a comp or something.

Other than that, we were seated to a very rowdy table (which is a bit surprising for this type of restaurant) but the hostess was kind enough to seat us in a quieter area. The dishes were ordered was simply AMAZING!! I loved every dish and would order them again. We started with the Ricci e Cavolfiore. The sea urchin coupled with the panna cotta was a great pairing. The panna cotta didn't have  strong taste to it and complemented the urchin extremely well. In addition, I love the crunch from the cauliflower bits too. Trofie Nero - WOW - A M A Z I N G !!! THANK GOD for my fellow yelpers telling me that this is a must TRY DISH...INDEED THEY ARE RIGHT AND YOU MUST TRY THIS!! The sauce isn't too heavy and tasty. The handmand noodle was done perfectly. Anatra - I love duck! I love this dish but after three bites I couldn't eat anymore. I was too stuffed. I read in the reviews that their portion was small which is what I was expecting but I thought it was decent size for everything we ordered. I love the peach mostarda that accompanied the duck. Gave it a bit of sweet taste. My sweetheart ordered Astice - I also really loved his dish. The lobster was cooked medium well so it wasn't overcooked and too tough to eat. The buttery taste to the lobster was really impressive granted it didn't taste fatty at all. Overall, I would give this place a 5 but it is lacking a bit of the personalize touch that a 5 star restaurant should hold.

A nice mix of prawn, scallops, some other seafood with al dente pasta. Bouillabaisse - the broth was delicious, large servings of seafood with a few pieces of buttered toast. Astice - lobster is difficult to screw up, but their butter poached nova scotia lobster was perfectly medium cooked. It is hard to describe. Definitely recommend this. You get a large lobster tail with some claw meat. Service was amazing. Our waiter was very soft spoken and helpful when we asked for recommendations. He was passionate and animated when we asked him to describe some of the dishes, so we continued to ask for recommendations and descriptions of the dishes throughout the night.

Luckily for me, it was morel mushroom season. I was treated to that wonderful fungi alongside my lobster and it was the perfect touch to an already unbelievable entree. The cheese plate held a fantastic triple-creme brie and was served with a gelatin fruit and cranberry bread. My dessert was so pretty I almost regretted touching it with my fork. Almost. Caramelized brioche with banana, passion fruit creme, and licorice flavored drizzle. A creative and wonderful pairing. Mmmm. The decor of Ai Fiore is beautiful and very upscale. Service was also impeccable - - friendly yet professional. The only issue I had during my dining experience was the screeching toddler a couple of tables over. He spent the entire time fidgeting and whining and screeching like kids tend to do. I was not at all prepared to listen to that  as I was expecting a fine dining environment. It ruined my experience. In fact, it's the reason I left early and didn't order more food and wine. Why on earth would a fine dining restaurant allow toddlers? I did ask and was told that they feel like they can't decline kids because the restaurant is attached to a hotel. Yes, you most certainly can and should turn away kids at a fine dining establishment when the average bill is $200 a head.

That stated, our meal was not as special as his other restaurants and the service was lacking. I was with a food critic and the wait staff actually forgot a middle course we ordered and they had to rearrange things. Then the Sommelier, who I had heard raves about, brings over a wine which the server had recommended. It was a white, and when I looked at the color, it appeared to be turned. But I gave it the benefit of the doubt because surely she knows more than I and secondly, I had not had this relatively unusual white before. Well, it was indeed turned, which really made me wonder how the Sommelier could have attempted to serve it.  I understand if she did not know me, but the fact that I was with someone they did know and well, who writes for a major paper, was beyond me.

Portions are pretty small but they were perfect for me on that hot summer day!We polished off lunch with sorbet, roasted peach, lemon, and mixed berry.Our waiter was pretty sweet too, but almost in a creepy way...his voice was very, very gentle and quiet, was very knowledgable and attentive.  He also had crazy funky glasses which were pretty great!!",1,0,1,Sheila C.,"Manhattan, NY",144,215,45

4.0,7/19/2013,"My husband and I went to Ai Fiori for dinner last night and had a wonderful experience. We did the four course tasting menu, with wine pairing. Everything we had was simply delicious! We started off with the razor clams and soft shell crab (yum!) then moved on to tortellini (decadent!) and squid ink seafood pasta (light and tasty!), and finally had scallops with pancetta and the rack of lamb.  The seafood was fresh and tasty, the pastas were perfectly al dente and homemade, and the desserts were fantastic.  We could tell that a lot of thought went into each dish. The wine pairing was also perfect. Everything they recommended with each dish was flawless and truly complemented each of the flavors. The service was impeccable all around - from our waiter, to each person that served us with bread, refilled water glasses, etc. Our main waiter, Michelangelo, was impressive - knowing each dish to a t and describing everything so that you wanted to taste the whole menu. Everyone showed high attention to detail, and were very courteous and friendly. The ambiance is very elegant.

5.0,7/16/2013,"My best friend surprised me here for dinner as part of my graduation celebration. I don't usually eat in this part of town because I live super  Downtown, but I am always up for a new culinary adventure. I completely trust Stefie with my life and especially trust her when it comes to food because her foodie expertise are just out of this world. She sure knows how to wine and dine, so when she said she picked somewhere special for dinner, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed and I was promptly prepared to have my mind blown.After leaving Ai Fiori I must agree that this place is definitely somewhere to take someone special and also the perfect place for celebrations. Maybe a tad more on the romantic side, Ai Fiori is a classy and perfect place to celebrate! Needless to say, I was not disappointed and still think fondly of this dinner! Ai Fiori is a beautifully elegant restaurant located Midtown. The massive staircase leads you up to the restaurant and the amazing experience that awaits you inside. We started with a chilled soup and finished with many chocolate desserts. There is a reason why Ai Fiori is Michelin rated- they deserve it! The cocktails here are also amazing. Stefie loves the chef  here and we were excited to try this restaurant out! When we left, they gave me a ""Congrats"" card, a shout out on Twitter and also a copy of  the menu of what we ordered to remember our celebration!!  Wow, talk about feeling really special!  You really get the full treatment here, and I fully expect to be back soon!

4.0,6/30/2013,"Ai Fiori is one of my favorite restaurants to come back to in the city due to sentimental value-- my husband and I had one of our very first dates at this restaurant on Valentine's day years ago.  I am giving a rating of 4 stars as an average of our multiple dining experiences here, and will summarize the highs and lows.  Amuse bouche is always delightful, and I don't know if they still do this but on Valentine's day we also started with a glass of champagne with a scoop of gelato in it (fabulous!!).  The fois gras has been consistently delicious, served with some nuts, fruit and buttered bread (I always felt it should come with three pieces instead of two given the nice portion of fois gras).  Tortellini, or any of their pasta for that matter, never disappoints.  On our last visit my husband had the rack of lamb (Agnello) which for some reason did not sit well with him.  I had a lobster risotto which was the special that night, and it was good.  We can always talk ourselves into a bottle of wine and cocktails from their excellent selection, and the elegant ambiance makes us feel like we are celebrating a special occasion.  We often get the smaller pre fixe plus a few other dishes that catch our eyes to indulge in each of the beautiful dishes.  Service has been good to great all but one time we dined with Ai Fiori.  I am pretty spoiled from lots of fine dining and amazing service at the nicest restaurants all over, so take it for what it's worth-- for this restaurant's category, service is expected to be great every time.  While the bussers/assisting waiting staff are very attentive and many, it is the main server whom we sometimes get disappointed with (not friendly or not attentive enough).  Each time this happens the restaurant slips a little on our list of favorites.  Still, we won't let one or two disappointing experiences deter us from coming back for the decadent and artistic food that awaits.  Bon appetit!",0,0,0,Kris P.,"New York, NY",11,11,0
5.0,6/28/2013,"The dining room is loud, but still classy and not indecent. I had one of my birthday dinners here, and although it probably would've been suffice to order a la carte, we both got the $92 four course prixe fix, and shared our pickings. See my pictures.I got the:1. Vellutata (lobster soup, périgord black truffles, chervil) - The soup is buttery but light. 2. Trofie Nero (ligurian crustacean ragu, seppia, scallops, spiced mollica) - You just have to get this. It's as good as they say.3. Ippoglosso (line caught atlantic halibut, zucchini purée, coco beans, tomato confit) - It was good for a halibut dish, but maybe I should've ordered a different protein as they tend to have more interesting flavor profiles.4. Crostata di Cioccolato (dark chocolate, spiced pear, pistachio, ricotta, pear sorbetto) - I liked the pear and chocolate combo.My companion got the:1. Insalata di Astice (nova scotia lobster, eggplant, fava beans, broccoli rabe pesto) - I'd choose this salad over the lobster soup because the in-between bites of beans make each chunk of lobster seem like it were your first.2. Corzetti (hen of the woods mushrooms, green garlic pesto, walnuts, lemon) - A lovely pasta.3. Bouillabaisse (saffron broth, langoustine, scallops, bouchot mussels, rouille - pf supp $5) - I found this a simple dish, but the seafoods are top notch.4. Panna Cotta (rosemary crema, honeycrisp apple granita, candied pumpkin seed) - I liked this more than my crostata di cioccolato.The mignardises were some chocolates, an almond cake, and a pate de fruit.

5.0,6/5/2013,"Holy mackerel. Best. Meal. Ever. And I don't say that lightly - read some of my scathing reviews (I enjoy writing them). This place is amazeballs in every sense of the word. Gorgeous decor, phenomenal service (uhm synchronized table service!), and the FOOD. I was floored by everything down to the side of asparagus. Lets walk through this meal shall we?1) Strawberry Basil Gazpacho - very refreshing palate cleanser with chunks of strawberries.2) Crudo di Passera (fluke crudo, american sturgeon caviar, meyer lemon) - sounds so rich but surprisingly well balanced with a touch of olive oil at the bottom. Mmmmm sooooo tasty, I wanted to lick the plate!3) Side of Asparagus (off-menu) - you think asparagus is asparagus right? WRONG. These super fresh spears tasted like a warm hug - meaty yet tender at the same time, exuding delicious asparagus flavor. 4) Anatra (long island duck, foie gras, ramps, mustard greens) - did not taste the ramps much BUT the duck was perfectly cooked with the most sumptuous flavor and easy texture. And then It was like the heavens opened up and said go ahead. INDULGE. You deserve this fresh foie gras. Let it melt into your taste buds and dissolve all your worries. Perfection. Portion sizes were just right leaving you enough room for dessert.5) Budino di Cioccolato (chocolate cremeux, hazelnut praline, fior di latte gelato) - the most innovatively refreshing, yet creamy dessert in recent memory. The slightly sweet gelato pairs perfectly with the richness of the creme. The beautiful plating arrangement made every bite a charm. 6) Bon Bons - what a surprise treat at the end. Lavender truffle was true to taste and the pistachio financier was every nut lovers dream.Bonus tip: try the Chamomile Grappa as your nightcap. Goes down so smooth and pairs perfectly with dessert.",2,1,2,Serene F.,"Union City, CA",141,64,12

5.0,6/1/2013,"I was impressed with this place the moment I walked in.  This is a restaurant on the second floor of the Langham Place hotel.  Ai Fiori in Italian means ""Among the Flowers"" and among the flowers we were.  Large vases overflowing with branches with light pink and white flowers.  The bar is great.  White marble accents the dark wood.  My favorite part is definitely the detail in the white tiled floors when you walk in.  Elegant, classic chic but still very welcoming.  Food:  We opted for the four course option.  One appetizer, a pasta, a fish/meat and a dessert.  This was definitely enough food.  Keep in mind that this place often changes their menu.  So I will try my best to remember what we ordered.  - Appetizer:  I ordered the Insalata di Astice which is lobster, eggplant , fava beans, and a broccoli pesto.  Absolutely phenomenal.  The lobster comes in small chunks and works great with the eggplant. The best part of this was the pesto.  It's not your ordinary pesto and it definitely doesn't take away from the lobster.  - Pasta:  I am a huge fan of the spaghetti.  I have never had blue crab in my spaghetti... Now that I've had this, why cant I have it in all my pastas? This dish is a winner because of its chili kick (not too spicy if you are worried just a great kick).  Your taste buds will thank you.My friend got the corzetti which is a mushroom pesto walnut pasta.  This was also very good but out-shined by my crab spaghetti for sure.  - Fish:  I decided to get seafood because I'm usually blown away with seafood more so than meat dishes.  So I went with the Capesante (sea scallops with mushrooms).  Fantastic in my opinion.  (Can this place impress me even more?)  Scallops perfectly cooked.  Not sure what the sauce was but it was subtle and completely satisfying.  Great.  My friend ordered the cod with a clam jus.  This was great as well.  - Dessert:  Friend ordered a chocolate tart, while I was adventurous and ordered the goat cheese panna cota with a fennel gel.  Not a fan at all.  I would not recommend this.  Tart was good according to my friend.  Sucks that I had to end my meal in a mediocre way but I am still a huge fan.   I'm fact it really is one of my favorite meals (minus the dessert) in New York.  - Service:  Friendly and not pushy or pretentious.  Very happy with the service.- Ambience:  Beautiful.Overall:  This place has a great menu. I love the modern interpretation of the classic.  If you are in the mood the splurge, this is where I would do it.",4,2,4,Linh F.,"Toluca Lake, CA",646,357,820

5.0,5/30/2013,"Ai Fiori is located on the second floor of The Setai hotel on Fifth Avenue. It's sort of an incongruous place to find a fancy restaurant; across the street there's a Burger King, a Yankees Store, and a Pret a Manger.And yet when you walk inside the hotel and then up the spiral staircase, you're whisked away into a beautiful luxury setting. You enter through glass doors. To your right is a comfortable-looking lounge, in front of you is the bar, and to the left is the pretty fancy-looking restaurant. Avis, the car rental company, had a famous slogan that went ""We're #2. We Try Harder."" For some reason, that's the phrase that went through my head the whole night at Al Fiori. I've had the pleasure of eating at a few New York Times 4-star restaurants in the last few years. And yet I can honestly say that the service we received here was superior to most of them. They paid meticulous attention to every detail. Whenever they served us, they always made a point to stand to our right-hand sides. When it came time to refill our water glasses, the gentleman doing the pouring would hold up a napkin to shield me from any inadvertent splashing. Only silverware appropriate to the dish you were eating was brought out, and it was very meticulously placed on the table (forks facing down, spoons facing up).  Where the restaurant isn't like those hoity-toity restaurants is the price. Don't get me wrong--you'll still be spending a lot compared to the Burger King across the street. But with appetizers in the $25 range and entrees in the $35-50 range, the meal is not quite the ""take-out-a-second-mortgage"" affair that you get at the Le Bernadin's and Per Se's of the world. There is a $92 four course prix fixe menu, but in all honesty we ended up just ordering three courses a la carte and were very satisfied. The evening started with complementary bread; we could choose from white, olive, and 7-grain bread. We were given both olive oil and butter to eat it with. Right away I knew this place was special, as the butter was amazingly creamy, and the olive oil had a wonderful subtly sweet taste.We were then treated to a complementary small glass of pea soup, with a dollop of lemon ricotta on the bottom and topped with an amazingly thin wafer of toasted olive bread. The taste was wonderful and extremely refreshing. Our server quipped that despite the frigid temperatures outside, it was their reminder to us that spring would be here any day. We decided to start with the Torchon, which is foie gras with some apricot mostarda (or as I call it, jelly), maricona almonds and roasted brioche. While it wasn't the best I've ever had, it was definitely fresh and the flavor pairings were excellent. I ordered the spaghetti, while my wife Lisa ordered the Torrelli (which for some reason both of us read as and kept calling ""Tortellini"").  The spaghetti was pretty phenomenal. The pasta itself was cooked perfectly, with that distinctive ""snap"" you get with freshly made pasta that's cooked just right. It was topped with shredded bits of blue crab and the entire dish had a delicious sauce and a slightly spicy kick. The Torrelli was just as phenomenal. It was beautiful to look at--yellow slabs of ravioli covered with a red wine glaze. The blend of cheese inside the pasta was ricotta and mascarpone, While a lot of raviolis tend to overdo the filling by making it too rich or too salty, this tasted perfect as you bit into the ravioli and let the cheese ooze into your mouth. It's no wonder that the pastas were so amazing--it's because the owner is none other than Michael White, whom I've seen referred to on the Web as everything from a Pasta Magician to the Sultan of Spaghetti to the Prince of Pasta. We'd enjoyed the meal so much we decided to have dessert. Lisa ordered the Budino di Ciocolato, a very very rich and smooth dark chocolate cream concoction with a crunchy brittle-like outer shell and hazelnut pralines. It came with a dollop of fior di latte gelato. I opted for some cheese, which was also excellent. When I couldn't decide what kinds to get, the server chose one soft and one hard one for me from France and Italy respectively. We ended with four little chocolate and fruit candies, a very nice way to top off the evening.Overall, I was pretty impressed. It may ""only"" have one Michelin star and three New York Times stars, but on this particular night at least, the experience was just as good to me as those three and four star joints in the fancier parts of town.",0,0,0,Steve L.,"Great Neck, NY",107,128,2

5.0,5/21/2013,"After dining at Marea in March for my birthday and being extremely pleased with the food, Ai Fiori was selected as the location for the joint birthday celebration dinner for my mother and boyfriend.  We arrived for our 8:30 reservation and had to wait about 15 minutes in the bar area before our table was ready.  The interior of Ai Fiori is very similar to Marea- simple yet elegant in an understated manner. Drinks: As it turned out, the sommelier did not have the one bottle of wine which my boyfriend selected.  She personally came over and offered us a pricier bottle for the same price as the original wine as an apology.  The California Sauvignon Blanc she provided ended up being a hit with the whole table.Food: The three of us all opted for the 4-course pre-fixe menu.  We were first presented with an amuse-bouche of a soup with bottarga bread crumbs that was light and tasty.  For our first courses my boyfriend had the fluke crudo, my mother the sea urchin and cauliflower panna cotta, and myself the roasted octopus.  The crudo was fresh and buttery and simply prepared with lemon and olive oil and topped with a heaping portion of caviar.  The dual creaminess of the plainer tasting cauliflower and the sea urchin complimented each other perfectly providing balance to the distinct and sometimes overpowering sea urchin flavor.  The octopus was served as four large pieces and cooked to the perfect texture.  For the pasta courses my boyfriend had the spaghetti with blue crab, my mother the trofie nero, and myself the veal agnolotti.  The spaghetti was served in a flavorful tomato sauce, which was a fresh take on the traditional seafood red sauce. The dish was laden with heaping chunks of flaky blue crab and sprinkled with grated bottarga.  Each of the flavors in the dish came through without overpowering each other.The trofie nero was a pile of squid ink pasta with a creamy seafood ragu and topped with buttery breadcrumbs for added texture.  As previous posters have said, it is delicious.  My veal agnolotti were superb.  They reminded me of a sophisticated comfort food- something I would LOVE a huge bowl of on a cold night.  Our only gripe about the pasta courses was the portion sizes, however, our main courses helped to make up for it.  My boyfriend ordered the Capriolo (venison chop), my mother the Faraona (guinea hen), and myself the Astice (lobster).  The capriolo chop was perhaps one of the few dishes that came to our table which my boyfriend felt was of adequate portion size.  The outside of the cut was beautifully charred, while the inside was left a succulent medium rare.  The chop was served with black trumpet mushrooms and soft potato gnocchi, both of which delicately balanced the slight gaminess of the capriolo.  My mother was very pleased with her guinea hen and almost could not finish the large portion.  The meat was flavorful and juicy with a crispy skin and the accompanying fragola (similar to Israeli cous cous) and hedgehog mushrooms were original and satisfying.  The simple preparation of the astice allowed the lobster to shine as the melt in your mouth main ingredient.  Finally, for dessert my mother and boyfriend opted for the torta di olio and I had the crostata di cioccolato.  The two birthday desserts were brought out with candles, we all devoured the delicious desserts, and we were sent on our way with complimentary biscotti.Overall, we find our experience at Ai Fiori to be excellent.  Our server was attentive without being intrusive and happy to make suggestions for our meal.  We were one of the last groups to leave the restaurant and we never felt rushed.  There were zero complaints about the taste of the food, although as previously mentioned, some of the portions could have been larger.  I am looking forward to continuing to patronize Michael White's establishments as long as the food and service remains as top notch as it has been at Marea and Ai Fiori.",0,0,0,Alexandra K.,"Jersey City, NJ",228,149,538

5.0,5/17/2013,"Review #800!!I celebrated my most recent birthday with all the suits having power lunches here.  The ambiance may be a bit business-y for those celebrating a special occasion, but the food was absolutely phenomenal.  Lunch is $42 for two courses and $18 for additional courses.  We had the following:Appetizer: Vellutata (lobster veloute, perigord black truffles, chervil) (yelp.com/user_local_phot…).  I've spent a lot of time in Maine so I've had a lot of lobster bisques/stews and this was the best lobster soup I've ever had.  The soup was wonderfully creamy and rich and there were big chunks of perfectly cooked lobster.Pastas:Tortelli (Ricotta and mascarpone ravioli, sottocenere cheese, red wine glaze) (yelp.com/user_local_phot…).  The ravioli were good but standard but the red wine glaze was absolutely amazing.Trofie Nero (Ligurian crustacean ragout, sepia, scallops, spiced mollica) (yelp.com/user_local_phot…).  Their take on squid ink pasta which I understand is kind of their signature dish.  My husband said it was ""more interesting than good"" but he did really like it.Entrees:Insalta di Astice (Nova Scotia lobster salad, porcini mushrooms, baby leeks, black truffle) (pf supplement $5) (yelp.com/user_local_phot…).  My husband really enjoyed it and I tried it and agreed it was excellent.Capesante (pan seared sea scallops, chanterelle, porcini, putarelle) (yelp.com/user_local_phot…).  This dish was absolute wonderful.  I'm a total snob about scallops and find that restaurants rarely cook them well.  These were cooked perfectly and the accompaniments really complemented it well. We were too stuffed for dessert, sadly.  Overall, our meal was amazing from start to finish.  The service, while very competent, was not as warm as I have experienced at some other fine restaurants, but I suppose that fits with the business atmosphere.  Even just for lunch, it was one of the priciest meals I've had, but I would go back in a heartbeat tomorrow if I could.",1,3,0,A M.,"West Lafayette, IN",856,1301,8

While this is an Italian restaurant, it's known to be one of the best burgers in the CIty. But they now close for lunch at 2pm - in NYC most ppl don't even eat til 1 or 2, and they had ""run out of the burger hours ago."" Really? Could that be because your manager and chef care more about their celebrity status than their customers now? This has gone from Convivio level to Puck level in less than two years. They should be ashamed. People run out of things, yes, but not what you want to have happen to guests that just talked you up for ten blocks and then left for the corner pub.

5.0,3/8/2013,"Ahhh Ai Fiori... such good memories here! On my first trip to NYC we went to Ai Fiori (group of 6) and tried out the tasting menu! I had really high hopes because as anyone who reads my reviews knows, good / great service is so important to me. Luckily, I was not disappointed in the least! The chef's tasting menu was just to.die.for. Each dish was better than the next and although each individual portion wasn't huge, we were all pleasantly full (if not stuffed) at the end! It was so much fun to talk about all the courses, so I definitely recommend the tasting if you do this with a group. Now, for my favorite part... the service... Impeccable would be one way to describe it, flawless, fantastic, organized, knowledgeable, etc. would also be applicable adjectives. When we walked in, we sat at the bar for a drink while waiting on our reservation time. The bartender (I think his name was Adam?) was so knowledgeable about everything! We seriously couldn't think of a question about alcohol that this guy didn't know the answer to. And watching him make drinks was like watching a great artist work! He made a fabulous dirty martini too (always important to me)! The waiter, sommelier, and bussers also impressed everyone. The waiter rattled off the 10, yes 10, dishes and their individual components on the tasting menu from memory! As anyone who has ever waited tables knows, that is no easy feat! The bussers and waiter picked up and dropped off the food in a choreographed motion that was just beautiful to watch. They also brought out new silverware for every course! I have yet to see this happen in any restaurants in Houston I have been to, even the ones with good service. The timing between courses was perfect, I mean seriously, while writing this review I am tempted to hop on a plane to NYC just to eat dinner here! The only con, and it's not really a con b/c it was our fault, was that it was a bit pricey. We spent $300 / person because we did get a little carried away with ordering wine, but it was delicious as well. Overall, although I had a slight guilt hangover from spending $300 on myself for a meal, I was so happy and satisfied with our experience at this restaurant.

Trust me....for what you'll pay here, you're better off eating elsewhere. Here's what happened my first and last time there:  I do not drink much, so at dinner, I passed the wine list to my husband to pick out a wine.  He picked a bottle, at which point the sommelier came over to help.  Husband mentioned the bottle he was considering and asked about other options, at which point the sommelier said ""Well, let me see what else is available while keeping you in your budget"". I am not joking, he told my husband that he wanted to keep us in our budget. Really. Aside from this, the service also left much to be desire. For ex, 2 servers carrying dishes would wait in front of us, sometimes for over 2-3 minutes, while the other 2 joined us (we were a table of 4). But that's not all.....my husband had ordered the foie gras. When he ran out of toast, I ordered some more for him. Before the toast arrived, another server cleared our plates even though we weren't done! I was mid-conversation and the next thing I knew, they had removed the plates before I even had a chance to protest. What's even worse is that we were charged for the toast, which arrived after the plates had been cleared. The server didn't even have enough sense to take it back. It just sat there as a reminder of the sort of evening we were having.So essentially, I paid Ai Fiori $750 for an incomplete meal where the staff embarrassed and humiliated us in front of my clients, and put us in ""my place"" while ""keeping me in my budget"".",3,1,0,Lil B.,"New York, NY",3,62,0

Dressed in suits and all, it was just very elegant.One of my co-workers were in the mood for Italian on a Thursday, and when we yelped close Italian restaurants, Ai Fiori popped up. Maintaining more than 4 stars and with over 300 reviews, we thought this place must be really good and made a reservation for lunch the following day.Since it was restaurant week, we decided to take advantage of that. For starters, we had the Zuppa di Zucca, which is basically butternut squash soup - it had pickled butternut and brown butter but it was most certainly divine! The BEST butternut squash I've ever had. Plus when the waiters were serving the soup, it was in synchronized motion and just made the experience even more fancier. I had the Gamba di Pollo, which was pan roasted white chicken meat with spaghetti squash, pistachio and other fancy ingredients - AMAZING!

Really gives you that elegant feel, then you are greeted by one of the most modern and elegant bars that are to man kind. The drinks are great, it's not so crowded and the group of people are pretty upscale.I had a table for 4 at this place with my girlfriend and another couple and can I just say the service was phenomenal? The maitre d was fantastic at explaining the menu and offering their chef's welcome. I went with the Lobster Bisque as an appetizer for the start of my 4 course meal, best Lobster Bisque I ever had. It was so rich, flavorful and bold. Continued was the ravioli and I didn't know they could make ravioli this good, you could tell it was just genuine and as close to Italy as you could get. They could have done a little better on the portions however. Next I had the foie gras as my entree and although a little more saltier than I'd like, it was pretty darn good. To finish off, I had their chocolate disc with golden flakes over pomegranate and a side of ice cream. Pretty creative.They pay pretty good attention to what the level of your drinks are, with quick refills, quick serving and retrieval of dishes.

5.0,2/1/2013,"***Restaurant Week $25 Lunch Menu***After reading some of the negative reviews about how bad the restaurant week menu is, I didn't have high expectations for this place. I still wanted to try it out since overall it had good ratings. This was my first time trying RW by myself and can be a little nerve wrecking.The restaurant is located on the second floor and you'd have to climb the beautiful staircase up to the entrance. The ambiance was great! I loved the decor and the waiters were really attentive. They moved the table to the side so that I could get in to the chair. My glass of water was always kept full and they made sure to clear my finished dishes right away. For appetizer, I had the butternut squash soup which was delicious! I scraped everything off the plate. If I could, I would have licked everything off. The pickled squash was a nice touch to the dish.For entree, I had the chicken which was also very good. I am usually nervous about ordering chicken for RW but now after this experience, I feel more open to it. The fregola was a yummy addition to the chicken.For dessert, I had the olive oil cake with cinnamon ice cream. Like the other reviews, the cake was tasteless but with the addition of the ice cream, it was the perfect combination.Everything came and went pretty quickly. I would say that's probably my fastest meal ever. Even after a couple of days, I'm still craving their butternut squash soup and cinnamon ice cream. I would totally come here again even if it's not restaurant week.",0,0,0,Alexia P.,"Boston, MA",85,14,37

The soup was very nice.  Flavorful and in the middle of the soup was pickled squash that provided a nice contrast in both texture and (fruity) flavor.The chicken was also good.  I don't think chicken is every particularly exciting as a dish but this chicken was moist,  stuffed with pistachio and the skin was perfectly crisp.The dessert was a nice chocolate mousse with gelato on top.  While each dish was relatively basic there was always more depth to the dish than a regular restaurant would have.  The atmosphere of this restaurant is awesome.  It is such a beautiful restaurant and the first place where I felt a little wowed by my surroundings.  I can't afford to eat at places like Jean-Georges or Daniel, etc, but this place made me feel like I had a taste of the good life in NYC.",0,0,0,Emile M.,"Winter Haven, FL",1,74,14

Good.  Definitely worth the cold and rainy trip down from work to a 2 hour lunch!Thank you, restaurant week!  My friend and I were trying to find some sort of flaw with the restaurant but were unable to find any.Ai Fiori is on the 2nd floor of the Setai - perhaps you might have gotten lost like we did.  The decor is excellent.  Open, airy atmosphere with plenty of natural light.  Lighting was great... none of that overly dim stuff.  Coat check available - and they treat you like kings and queens!Service was excellent - they were very attentive and always looking to see if your water needs to be refilled or if you need something.  Now, for the food:Bread - yes, I am reviewing the bread.  The bread wasn't anything special, but for some reason the butter made me drool.  (Or maybe I was starving).Butternut squash soup - it comes out in this gigantic bowl with garnish on it, and you look down and see nothing but a few drops of whatever brine the garnish was sitting in.  Then they come by and pour your soup out of a little jug.  Cute.  Anyways, the soup.... oh what can I say about the soup.  Creamy deliciousness.  Best butternut squash soup I've had.Skate and lentils - okay, maybe I'm a little bit biased because I absolutely LOVE skate, ever since I was a child.  It was delicious!  There was a great balance of salty and sweet on the plate.  The skate, at first sight, seems deep fried but it doesn't taste so.  The lentils are also not overcooked and actually have texture.  Yummy pear sauce.Olive oil cake - the cake by itself I was not really that big of a fan of.... but the cake and the ice cream/sorbet they give you.... *dreamy sigh*.  BEWARE - if you agree to get coffee, it costs you a whole $5 a pop.  Yes, 1/5 of your meal.  Ugh.Until next time, Ai Fiori...",2,1,0,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2170,1311,3573

4.0,1/27/2013,"Ai Fiori has been on my list of ""must try"" restaurants for what feels like years. For some reason, there never seemed to be an opening whenever I tried to make a reservation. Finally, as luck would have it, as I was planning dinner for my dad's birthday last week, there was an opening not only around the time I was looking for but at the exact time I was looking for. Score!Ai Fiori is on the second floor in the beautiful Setai Hotel. A spiffily dressed doorman opened the door for us upon our arrival and showed us to the winding staircase that leads up to the restaurant. I love the huge teardrop sculpture by the stairs. My sister, boyfriend and I arrived first so we decided to grab a drink at the bar. I had the Cherry Sidecar - Oh. My. God. One of the best sidecars I've ever had. Dare I say, it was perfect? I could have happily sat at the bar and drank these all night... and then the parents arrived. Damn. The dining area is spacious and understatedly ornate. Our party of five was seated on a round table in a nook-like space; it felt as though we were the only ones there. (A feeling I alone may have felt since I had my back to the rest of the restaurant actually, now that I think about it.) We decided to do the 4 course pre fixe. Overall, a very satisfying meal though the portions seemed tiny even after taking into consideration that restaurants like this serve small portions usually. For my appetizer, I had the scallops with fennel. A good, light start to the meal, the scallops were perfectly cooked (though tiny! No bigger than a nickel) and the fennel was crisp and fresh. Some other favorites at the table were the butternut squash soup and cauliflower panna cotta. The lobster soup was a tad on the salty side, IMO but I'm not really a fan of sodium in general. BF enjoyed it.For the pasta course, I had the Trofie Nero. This dish alone is the reason I would  go back again... and again... and again. There's only one restaurant off the top of my head that makes a rivaling squid ink pasta. I stole a forkful of bf's spaghetti with blue crab - it was good and flavorful, but not something that would draw me back. We all agreed that the pasta course was by far the shining star of the entire meal. My entree was the poached lobster. This may have been my least favorite course surprisingly... but somehow it was too tender. (My mom thought it was nearly raw.) For a dish that is poached in butter, it was also lacking in flavor. Maybe I'm ghetto or uncultured/sophisticated, but gimme a broiled lobster with bread crumbs on top with melted butter on the side any day.Notable favorites for dessert were the olive oil cake - so light and airy and rich and flavorful! One of the best I've had (WAY better than another notable chef's) - and the caramelized brioche. I had the rosemary panna cotta; Michael White's presentation is pretty and unique. Little balls of panna cotta artfully ""tossed"" in with the other ingredients on the plate. But flavor-wise, not as successful nor interesting. One minor ""complaint"" if you would call it that (though it didn't affect our night either way)... when the girl called to confirm the reservation, she asked for my father's name so I thought they'd somehow incorporate it into the night - I've been to restaurants that write the name in chocolate in the dessert or have a ""Happy birthday Kate!"" message on the menu.

Our party of 6 was seated at a round table sectioned off from the rest of the dining area. Almost instantly I noticed that the table was not centered in the space. I'm certain our server/sommelier noticed this too was a problem, but thought it would be impolite to ask us to move after we were seated. As dishes were served/cleared from our table, the servers would accidentally kick our chairs and had to squeeze through the tight spot. While I found it entertaining to see them balance their dishes over my uncle's head it's quite amateurish for a Michelin rated restaurant, no?Bread was served only once and was never offered again until one of us asked for more. When the server came with the bread, she only served it to the one person and did not ask if any one else would like some. Another example of lack of common sense/basic training.We ordered the Chef's Tasting Menu and the food was decent but nothing was memorable. Ironically my favorite dish was their ""Pre-dessert"" which was a palate cleanser made of apples. I favored that over the actual chocolate cake that followed. There were also long gaps (approx 20 minutes) between courses which I found to be too long.

1.0,11/26/2012,"Really bad experience at this restaurant, we came for a family dinner and were from the start being spoken down to. Our waitress/sommelier rushed us at every turn and consistently asked us if we were ready to order when we clearly were not. Just generally all of us felt like we were being rushed out the door, the servers and staff were extremely judgmental and corrected us on our pronunciation of items multiple times. Our waitress dropped the checked and proceeded to lurk around our table until the credit card was put in, when she immediately removed it to ring it up. Not only that but she caused a scene about my dad miscalculating 10 cents on the tab. As someone who works in the restaurant industry I believe that every restaurants policy should be that the customer is always right and and no matter who steps through your doors they are a paying customer and should be treated as such. To be treated as though we were not worthy of being there is definitely not part of a positive experience. I am definitely not returning and I would most certainly not suggest it to others. I will say that the food was good, but not worth the service we received.",0,0,0,Natalie B.,"BELLE MEAD, NJ",0,1,0
4.0,11/24/2012,"A friend from Shanghai was visiting two weeks ago. It was his first time in New York, and I felt intense pressure to impress a good image upon him. Due to the last minute notice though, I wasn't able to make reservations at many places. While Ai Fiori was a second choice at best, the 4 course prix fixe did not disappoint. I started with Ai Fiori's version of the old fashioned (the name escapes me). If a place has a variation on a Manhattan or an Old fashioned, I always order it without question, so I would like to think that I know what's really good, ma. This version was particularly good. I was a little wary about the vanilla, but it turned out to be a subtle touch. I started with the uni on cauliflower panna cotta (I tried to get clarification on the cauliflower portion - as in are there cauliflower bits or would this be cauliflowered smooth textured panna cotta? Our waiter offered a definition on a panna cotta, which is something that I clearly have never heard of, so novel, panna cotta. Thank you, now it's clear). It was fine - I think uni is best served alone as sashimi or as part of a larger, warm dish on the creamy side. This pairing took away from the sea urchin - cauliflower having a pretty distinct flavor. I then went on to the crab meat pasta. I am not the biggest fan of spaghetti, I think it's been forever ruined by its most common serving with meatballs. Ai Fiori is supposed to be famous for its pastas, and it is apparent in this dish. But I gotta say, my friend's Trofie Nero was the star, in fact, I hijacked it halfway through. No shame. I took the duck as my main, but to be honest, at that point, I really just wanted more Trofie Nero. The duck was fine, I would've preferred that it come with some crispy skin, but that probably would've taken me over the edge. By the time dessert came around, all I can think was coffee to offset the cocktail and the bottle of wine we shared. Just a note about the decor: I was a little disappointed. Maybe it was that the ceiling could've been higher or the dim lighting seemed more low budget than ambient, the overall look was not nearly up to par with the hotel. If the place wasn't an after thought, then it sure looked like it and you know as far as I'm concerned, appearances is as good as reality.",3,3,1,Jae Z.,"New York, NY",181,360,31

5.0,10/25/2012,"Giving five stars to a restaurant is a rare thing for me but after eating three times at the Ai Fiori they simply earned this five star review. During the last few months I've been to Ai Fiori for lunch, dinner in the dining room and dinner in the bar area. No matter which meal or where you sit you constantly get friendly and profession service to go with the amazing selection of Chef Michael White's creations. Lunch Prix-Fixe of $42 for two courses is a great introduction to this fine dining establishment. Some of the dishes reside both on the lunch and dinner menus. I highly recommend reserving your lunch or dinner but most of the time you should be able to get a table in the lounge area which serves the exact same menu. Plus if you sit at the bar you can enjoy your meal and amaze yourself by the speed, efficiency and knowledge of the ever accommodating bar keepers.Specialty the house is of course the Chef White's fresh home-made pasta dishes which is a selection of five for lunch and  seven dishes for dinner. Then you can further choose from Appetizer and Main Courses. Just leave room for dessert which is served from the wheeled trolley in a glass case.You can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes so if you are doing a prix-fixe make sure not to miss at least one dish. Additional courses are at $18 so if you are doing two prix-fixe just get a pasta to share as mid-course.Four Course Dinner Prix Fixe is $92 but you can always order individual dishes. Extensive selection of wine is available by the glass and bottle but make sure to check out the seasonal cocktails. Your trustworthy sommelier is always near by if you need to choose a bottle of wine, simply tell them what you like and what price range.This is a restaurant which my wife and I are plan to return many times for any meal of the day.

I basically was starving when I left as well, which is not good considering that even though it is French cuisine, the flavors should satiate your taste buds and the infusion of the whole experience theoretically should satisfy your hunger. I had nothing to brag about coming here, though. The best part was their pasta with broccoli rabe, which unfortunately I didn't get as the entree. First came the country pate, which I thought was nothing special. I had one too many pates in Europe to know what a good pate tastes like. Then came the skate wing, which was good in terms of the texture. I liked it well enough, but I didn't think it was amazing. My favorite part is the dessert, so this could've been the deal breaker for me. Unfortunately I wasn't too impressed with the olive oil cake mixed with raspberry sorbet.

Side note: Their olive bread is very goodFOOD:(1) Vellutata - Lobster Soup - BEST soup I've ever had. Definitely had a food-gasm while I ate that dish. Perfect flavors. I'm not a soup person, but for that soup, I'd convert to soup-ism. (2) Spaghetti - with Blue Crab - slightly spicy but I appreciated the kick. Texture of the noodles was perfectly al dente, which I LOVED. Flavors were... not my favorite, but definitely nothing to complain about. (3) Trofie Nero - Squid Ink pasta - which was SO much better than the spaghetti. Hand-rolled spirally pasta was AMAZING. That's their signature pasta dish, and there's a good reason for that. Make sure someone at your table gets it, so you can at least try a bite. (4) Astice - Lobster - Best texture I've ever had for a lobster. Brilliantly and ever so slightly poached. Wonderful. (5) Rosemary Panna Cotta - I wanted a light dessert, and this was the perfect option. If you're not a big chocolate or dessert fan, get this. It's fruity and light and refreshing. Perfect way to end your meal, IMO. (6) Petit Fours and take-home biscotti - Always a nice gesture. I love petit fours, and Ai Fiori's were great. Service is perfect, and the food tastes amazing. The dishes are less about presentation than they are about taste, but I don't care. Ai Fiori definitely had dishes that tasted better than 2 star Michelin restaurants.

They started us all off with a shot of gazpacho, which was pretty good.  Our wine for the night was a BV reserve - Tapestry Red Napa 2008, which I loved (good thing too, because it was PRICEY).  I chose the Vellutata (lobster soup, périgord black truffles, chervil) to start, but got to try the Sardines (mediterranean sardines, tomato, caper, coriander), and the Crudo di Passera (fluke crudo, american sturgeon caviar, meyer lemon) as well - all of which I liked.  My lobster soup was pretty awesome, but I've never had a lobster soup that I didn't think was amazing, so... not sure if I loved this lobster soup in particular, or just all lobster soup in general, haha.  The table also ordered the Funghi (hen of the woods mushrooms, ricotta salata) to share. For the second course, I got the Risotto (riso acquarello, duck confit, hen of the woods mushrooms), but also tried the Raviolo di Uovo (egg yolk raviolo, chanterelles, basil, tomato confit).  The risotto was pretty good - the only qualm I had was that I didn't like the texture of the mushrooms mixed in with the risotto.  But maybe that's just me.  Though I am complaining a bit, I'm not going to lie - I ate the whole thing.For my entree, I got the Maiale (red waddle pork loin, gnocchi, pork belly, fennel à la grecque), and got to try the Merluzzo (laurel crusted atlantic cod, chorizo, potato, chick peas, manila clam jus) as well.  My dish was pretty good - the pork loin was a little bit overcooked, and not as tender as I was hoping, but the pork belly was pretty amazing.  The gnocchi was a little too dense for me, though I'm sure that's how they intended it to be.  The dessert was definitely my favorite course.  I got the Pane Caramello al Rum (caramelized brioche, banana, passion fruit crema, licorice), which was... amazing.  The brioche was SO GOOD, and the banana went perfectly.  Everything was amazing.  I also tried a lot of the other desserts - the Budino di Cioccolato (chocolate cremeux, coffee crema, apricot, macadamia gelato), the Tar taletta (dark chocolate, grapefruit, anise, hazelnut gelato), and the Panna Cotta (vanilla crema, blackberries, yogurt, melon sorbetto).  Everything I had was great.  Loved it all, and glad that I have a separate compartment in my stomach for desserts, because I was definitely too full to eat anything else after the entree.We left the restaurant barely able to move, with lots of food babies, and in high spirits.  Awesome food, and well deserving of their michelin star.",3,0,0,Jenna L.,"San Diego, CA",108,506,2

It included heirloom tomatoes, stracciatella, basil pesto, balsamic dressing.  It was a fantastic choice - light to eat and beautifully plated.  For my next course, I selected a house favorite, Trofie Nero.  The plate included ligurian crustacean ragu, seppia, scallops, spiced mollica.  While I enjoyed the plate, I preferred my colleagues choice, Tortelli comprised of ricotta & mascarpone ravioli, sottocenere cheese, red wine glaze.  The cheese ravioli was smooth and creamy and the glaze was delicious.Although service was generally superb, there was an obvious miscommunication, because it was nearly a half hour between when we finished our second plate and received our third.  This did not bother me nor detract from our dinner since we had planned a leisurely meal, but it did strike me as an odd issue for a restaurant, which clearly encourages the four course meal.  The third plate proved worth the wait, and I thoroughly enjoyed the Capesante, sea scallops, fennel, leeks, uova di trota, and shellfish sabayon.Though I was quite content by the time I had finished the scallops, I had ordered the Torta di Olio for dessert - a ligurian olive oil cake, strawberry, pine nut, and rosemary yogurt gelato. It was served on two plates; the first the warmed cake with a side of strawberry jam and the second plate with the flavorful gelato, pine nuts and strawberries that complimented the the cake beautifully.Ai Fiori is set up perfectly for a power dining dinner or to have a special meal with close friends and family. The formal atmosphere is not stuffy and enhances the dining experience.  I would certainly come back again with colleagues if the opportunity presented itself - and I hope it does.",0,0,0,Bos G.,"Boston, MA",96,63,0

Not cheap, but the food is ethereal. We did the prixe fix for the anniversary dinner, and very much enjoyed it. I really appreciate tasting menus at top rated restaurants; it forces you to try several different options and really gives a flavor (haha) to the diner. We had the Insalata di Astice, Granchio, Trofie Nero, Raviolo di Uovo, Bouillabaisse, and Astice. The standouts were the Trofie Nero, and Astica. The wine choice was less than stellar, to the point of me not remembering it. The late night pasta stop consisted of the Trofie Nero - yes, it is so good as to double up - and the Risotto. Both were great. Wine was the Valdisanti 2008. Amazing wine. Bottom line, you need to go there. Whether you have the budget to be a regular, or this is a reach - make it happen at least once.

It definitely lives up to the fame and recognition. Service was impeccable, atmosphere was classy and sophisticated without being overly pretentious, and well, the food...where to start? No complaints, only praises. For the ingredients they could afford to serve you at restaurant week prices, they did an absolute stellar job--both in taste and in presentation. You can't go wrong with any of the menu choices, but I highly recommend the chilled zucchini soup and pan-roasted skate wing. Dessert certainly does not disappoint either.

5.0,7/31/2012,"Decided to try this place for Restaurant Week Lunch:Definitely going to be looking into more Michael White restaurants after this experience; it was easily the best restaurant week experience I've had yet. The restaurant, which was located inside a hotel had a very relaxed, modern, and sophisticated atmosphere. Service was also excellent. Our serious looking, but friendly waiter chatted it up with us about our day and eating habits. Some highlights:1) Country Terrine: The pate was a little sweet, spicy, and just the right texture. Having never tried pate before, I will be spoiled forever from now on. It came with some tasty french pickles which complemented the dish beautifully.2) The pasta: OMG, Mario Batali eat your heart out! It was a tagliatelli with a signature pesto with pine nuts and parmesan. I had heard that Michael White is known for his pasta dishes; now I know why! It's simple, but prepared perfectly with exceptional ingredients. My girlfriend was reaching across the table to take more! 3) Both desserts were outstanding. The tartaletta, in particular, was exceptional. It is a decadent chocolate and caramel orgasm in your mouth, more rich than sweet. Chocolate lovers definitely have a clear favorite. The olive oil cake was a lighter and fluffier alternative. The raspberry sorbet that came with it complemented the cake perfectly.Definitely coming back again for the prix fixe lunch and to sample more goodies!

5.0,7/31/2012,"The perfect night out in the big city. The setting is beautiful, with dark cherry woods and gold flecks in everything from the table cloths, to the lighting fixtures, to the vases holding perfectly petite white flowers. Ai Fiori is located upstairs in the Setai hotel. A beautiful setting for a celebratory dinner. While I can see how some people might say it feels like a midtown business lunch crowd (and yes, it would be perfect to impress some clients), at dinner, it felt like a gorgeous, fancy restaurant, without the stuffy businessy crowd. And with my favorite dinner date to accompany me, this night couldnt get any better.Service was spectacular. They did give away my table when I was less than 10 minutes late, and had called to tell them so, but were very kind in finding us another one within 10 minutes and apologizing for the wait.  Our waiter Michael was top top knotch, making us feel welcome and in the know.  Even if he told us everything we had ordered was ""their signature dish"" he said it was such conviction and friendliness that i wanted to believe him.And the food, was just divine. I didn't understand the concept of French-Italian coming into the night, but by the end of our 4 course meal, I was exclaiming the genius of chef Michael White and all things Fritalian, or Italench, whatever your pleasure.  Truly spectacular and memorable dishes.  Nothing fell short of ""great"", and some went into ""sublime"" territories.  Nothing was life changing (as the pasta at Osteria Morini was) but it was indeed superb, start to finish.For drinks, I had the Monaco-Milan, which was a beer cocktail with amaro. Bitter sweet subtle fruity. So so delicious. I wish I could have this nightly to put me into my happy place before I go to sleep.For appetizer, we had the Torchon, a perfectly French little foie gras mousse, with toasted almonds, and a 25-year balsamic vinegar over reduced strawberries. On brioche. All perfectly done. Ah mazing.For our pasta dish (come on, you cannot eat at a Michael White restaurant and not have the pasta), we opted for their signature squid ink pasta, the Trofie Nero. This was savory, soft, tender, and divine. The sauce was a wonderful reduction with spicy bread crumbs on top for texture. Light, but bursting with flavors and textures, all over perfect tendril curls of black ink pasta.For entrees, my man had the agnello, which was 2 big lamb chops marinated with foie gras and lamb shoulder and other parts. So much flavor and tenderness. I instead opted for the Astice, which was the star of the evening.  A perfect lobster tail, braised in butter and so soft and tender, melting in your mouth.  Paired with delicate artichoke hearts, purée of lemon reduction, and what must have been ambrosia (the fruit of the gods), this lobster tail just could not get any better.  As my man said over and over, ""what the heck is going on in my mouth, it's heaven.""Finally, for dessert, we shared the torta di olio, or the olive oil cake. Strawberries, ice cream, and sweet drizzles of other delicious things come, and you assemble the cake yourself. It was very interesting. You taste the olive oil, but it does not overpower the strawberries. Perfect way to end dinner.And surprisingly, it was not that outrageous a price for such a 5 star NY dinner experience. With each of us drinking, and one appetizer, one pasta, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert, our bill was under $200. There's also the option of a four course tasting menu, for $89 per person, but with this, we were already stuffed and did not feel like we had missed out on anything the menu had to offer.

3.0,7/26/2012,"RESTAURANT WEEK LUNCH REVIEW:I had lunch reservations at noon with my wife and her friend. Between the 3 of us, I got to sample most of the RW menu:Country Terrine: The pate had a lot of flavor. It was unique in the sense that it almost had a sausage-like taste to it but I could definitely make out the liver. The citrusy greens and the mini pickles helped to balance out the heaviness. Even with that, I needed my wife to help me out. 4/5 yelp.com/user_local_phot…Insalata: I don't usually eat salads but my terrine was so heavy that I was glad my wife shared this with me. It was fresh and tasted pretty good to me.

This tagliatelle  was shockingly bland. I had to season it heavily with salt, pepper and grated parmesan to make it edible. 1/5 yelp.com/user_local_phot…Razza: The skate was decent but not memorable.

We ordered a bottle of wine to be served with our meal and we were served our apps 5 minutes before the wine had arrived, by the time we tasted wine we were almost done with our first course. 2. We were never offered another serving of bread after we finished our first serving even though the tables to our left and right was offered the choice.3. Perhaps my biggest dissapointment was when I was on my second glass of wine, a fruit fly dropped into my full glass of wine. I notified the waiter and he took it away without a word. Minutes later he returned with a clean glass, but no wine was offered. It was a full glass of wine and at restaurant of this calibre, I'm not sure exactly why all he did was giving me a new glass without offering to refill at least that single glass of wine which was ruined by flies.

3.0,7/11/2012,"Food deserves 4 stars but we had some service issue when we went.First off, I made reservation for 4 at 8pm on a Tuesday evening. Special occasion - it's my husband's birthday and my in-laws were in town to celebrate. We arrived early and were asked to sit at the bar while they prepare the table. We didn't get a table until 8:20pm. During the wait, no one ever came to us to tell us how much longer it was going to be. I found the wait quite unacceptable given we had a confirmed reservation and well.. it's a nice restaurant! I thought we were forgotten until I was getting impatient and went to the hostess to ask about our table and was told it'd take them another minute or so to ""reset"" the table. Next problem - we ordered 2 bottles of wine (1 red, 1 white) for the table. My husband and I shared the red; my in-laws shared the white. My father in-law made a face when he drank his wine and told us to smell / taste it. The white wine stank. He started adding ice to the wine glass to dilute it so it's more drinkable. I couldn't take it anymore and suggested my husband to ask them to replace the bottle. I mean, it's a $70 bottle, on the cheaper end of the wine list, but it shouldn't smell like pee and be completely undrinkable. So my husband went to the waiter on his way to the washroom to ask them to just discreetly give us another half bottle of white cuz we got a bad one at the table. Discreetly being the operative word as he didn't want to embarrass his parents. The waiter (who didn't wait our table by the way so maybe he's the wine guy?) came by our table, said he tasted the wine and it was good (no it didn't) but he would replace it with a half bottle of a different wine. My in-law got very upset cuz the guy made a scene (did he not understand the word 'discreetly'? or that my husband told him he'd be happy to pay for the shitty bottle just give us a different one?). The whole evening my in-law didn't crack a smile. Food was good - not the best Italian I had. My husband and I both had the 4-course pre fix. We had the lobster salad (decent), crispy softshell crab (very good), egg yolk ravioli (decent), blue crab spaghetti (good), lamb (good), veal chop (very good), panna cotta (very good) and chocolate cake (very good). My in-laws said the squad was very good.Like I said the food is 4 stars. Unfortunately a dining experience is more than just the food, thus I am taking a star off from my rating. We spent good money on this meal (4 cocktails, 2 bottles of wine, 2 pre fix menu, 2 apps and 2 mains!) and we did not expect anyone in our party to leave upset by the service.

5.0,6/15/2012,"I went to Ai Fiori last night with my boyfriend and had a remarkable dining experience! We went with the prix fixe menu which was definitely the way to go. Between the two of us we were able to sample almost the entire menu (which is key when every single item sounds enticing).THE FOODHere were my choices. I picked all the right things :)Starter- nova scotia lobster salad, whipped ricotta, peas, lemon - incredibly refreshing. This made me realize I never cooked lobster and should start.Pasta- egg yolk raviolo, chanterelles, basil, tomato confit - This comes as one giant ravioli with the egg yolk breaking as you cut into it. A delicious surprise.Main - long island duck, foie gras, cherries, pistachio, mustard greens - This was perfect. I just don't know how else to say it. Wait I do, Perfecto!Dessert - vanilla black pepper crema, rhubarb, buckwheat, raspberry sorbetto - a very fun combination. I didn't share this one hehe.I felt comfortably full when I left so the portions were definitely adequate (something I always worry about when going the prix fixe route).THE SERVICEA shining example for other restaurants. We had a team of very friendly staff who clearly knew the menu inside and out and were happy to be there, which makes me happier to be there.THE DRINKSThe wine list was very impressive. I wouldn't bother with cocktails here.If you have a big occasion, I highly recommend this place.

Great mix of meat - juicy, perfectly cooked - its a mix of chuck, brisket, short rib, and aged rib-eye,  that drips hot burger juice all over the plate when you pick it up.  Its topped off with a great rich slice of white american cheese, thick cut smoked bacon and two slices of ""black"" tomatoes and piece of Bibb lettuce - and stacked inside of this awesome soft buttery roll that was grilled a bit before assembly.  Served on the side in lieu of standard fries are these delicate potato puff thingys called  Pommes Dauphine -which melt in your mouth like heavenly testicles of the God's.  (I've never actually had testicles of God's before, but i would imagine this would be a similar experience - I'll let you know in my 'God Balls' review).  On the side is this little ramekin of aioli mayo for dipping.  No ketchup.

This is an expensive restaurant, but the four-course prix fixe for $89 is a relative bargain.  More so, because only one item on the prix fixe menu had an added supplemental price.  Some complain about the smaller portions, but I thought with four courses that they were just perfect. I started with the Insalata which was disappointing because the dressing tasted somewhat bland.  However, I should have been more adventuresome, but wanted some healthy greens to start!  Next I had the Corzetti, a wild mushroom ragu, which was scrumptious.  A larger portion would have been perfect for an entree. It might sound mundane, but I choose the Merluzzo for the entree, a crusted cod with a black truffle sauce with porcini which I thoroughly enjoyed.  I chose a tasty light dessert of sorbets which was beautifully presented.  The service at this restaurant is impeccable.  I can't wait to return and savor more of the food!",0,0,0,ada m.,"New York, NY",0,6,0

Too bad, at the time I couldn't eat much, because of the medication I was on; but I got friends with me and oh did they enjoy all the Michelin starred restos that I all RSVPed for us.      Ai Fiori was on my list to try, since I love how chef Michael White did with Marea (2 Michelin stars) and I also dined at Osteria Morini when it first opened, where I met chef Michael White; so this was under young and talented chef Chris Jaeckle, with he is no longer at Ai Fiori. He was an alum at Eleven Madison Park, a 7 years with the Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group; so I know chef White wouldn't hired anyone less. I was in for a real treat.      Locate inside the Setai Hotel, i can only imagine walked in with this beautiful marble bar, to the warm dining room, fresh flowers, impeccable service, just as Marea, but this is a much more beautiful space. And opened door in 2010, it earned a Michelin star in OCT 2011, I was there just 2 days after it earned it. OCT is the best time to be in NYC for the Michelin release and the participation couldn't be any better.- Amuse bouche - it's a nice soup with Piedmont black truffle. - Sardine - Mediterranean sardines, tomato confit, ceci mille foglia, olio nuovo - Thank you to our wonderful server to recommend this dish - beautifully plated, tasted even nicer.- Vellutata - Lobster velouté, Périgord black truffles, chervil - this was a divine dish, every spoon was smooth, delicious, and the aroma is intoxicated! Wish I could licked the dishto the last drop, if my friends were watching me! - Pansotti - Lumache brasato, lemon butter, parsley, veal jus! Anything pasta is ABSOLUTELY wonderful here.- Tortelli - Ricotta and mascrpone ravioli, boschetto cheese, rend wine glazed, just enough glazed to taste it, the cheese melt on my tongue on each bite! - Agnolotti - Braised veal parcels, butternut squash, black truffle sugo - At this time  I wasn't sure which dish is better, or it just kept getting better, and better.- Vitello - Anish veal chop ""au four"" saltimbocca, new potatoes - you got to see the pic! Epic, perfectly medium rare, thick cut, plenty to share, juicy!- Agnello - Rack f lamb en crepinette, panise, romanesco, parmesan - So even our server recommend us this dish, I know I can do no wrong! The meat was just stunning, i asked myself only in NY that the Italian food can get this good, outside of Italy!

After my last final a few of us went to Bryant Park Café for a drink....which turned into celebratory end of semester shots. Thank god I had scoped out the menu days beforehand and I had a semi idea of what I wanted. We did the 4 course pre fixe for $89. Razor clams, blue crab spaghetti, butter poached lobster and dessert (don't remember the name). Everything was delish. I def felt like I could have eaten more...especially the blue crab spaghetti. A portion twice the size would have been great. The service at Ai Fiori was by far the best I have ever experienced though. We had 4 waiters, every question answered and every dish presented as it arrived with a detailed description.  All new china, silverware and glasses with each course.

5.0,4/30/2012,"Excellent food, service, and presentation.  I did not quite enjoy it as much as a recent meal at Marea, but that's a high standard to beat.  The meal was a perfect progression from subtle lighter dishes to heavier rich ones.  The amuse bouche was overall fantastic, 3 small bites.  Beets and Goat cheese made me a fan of beets!  Borata with caviar (American I believe) was the best bite, super creamy and delicious.  The fluke crudo was just alright, very mild fish.  The service was attentive and friendly.  It was also casual in a way that I love, this is not formal uptight service although the ambiance and vibe is upscale.  The busboys appeared to be as knowledgeable about the food and wine as the waiter.We ordered a bottle of wine, which took quite a while to arrive.  When it did, we were informed that the first 2 bottles they opened exploded on them!  Must have been something wrong with the wine, because the bottle that did open properly tasted off, and was immediately returned.  They did not blink, took it back and offered us another style of wine.  Perfect service.  The bottle of Prosecco we ended up receiving was well priced and delicious.We opted for the 7 course tasting menu:1 - Insalata di Astice (nova scotia lobster salad, whipped ricotta, peas, lemon).Very tender light dish, the ricotta was whipped to such a light consistency this was a excellent start to the meal.  Delicate without being bland, the lobster itself was paired surprisingly well with the ricotta.  Nice crunch from the vegetables and the bread.2 - Animelle (crispy sweetbreads, pomme purée, truffle vinaigrette, pancetta).Fantastic dish, and an interesting way to serve sweetbreads.  Never seen sweetbreads so white before.  Perfectly crispy with a thin battered crust.  Excellent accoutrement, deep lush flavors, wonderful dish.3 - Ravioli di Uovo (egg yolk raviolo, nettles, morels, ricotta).Loved this!  Rich, deep earthy flavor from the nettle and morels, light yet packed with flavor raviolo.  Small portion, but immense flavor. 4 - Ippoglosso (line caught atlantic halibut, baby romaine, guanciale, white bean purée, preserved lemon jus).Another winner, delicate cut of fish, great texture from the romaine, excellently matched with the guanciale, one of my favorite dishes of the night.5 - Vitello (amish veal chop ""au four,"" new potatoes, prosciutto, sage)This was a surprise, since it was a $10 supplement on the 4 course tasting menu, I did not expect it at the base price of the 7 course tasting menu.  Great value.  The meat was tender as anything, the fat seems to melt in my mouth.  They even brought out the bone for my wife to chew on.  Fun!  6 - Panna Cotta (balsamic crema, blood orange, marcona almond, lemon sorbetto).Never had a Panna Cotta served in a (cracker?) shell, such a great idea.  One of the more flavorful Panna Cotta's I've ever had, and perfectly creamy, excellent pre-dessert!7 - Crostata di Cioccolato (gianduja mousse, bosc pear, port, violet, vanilla gelato)Perfect dessert, not to sweet, contrasting flavors and textures.  The fruit pieces paired well with the dense chocolate.  We both loved this.Milder flavors overall than some of the other dishes i've had from Michael White.  Yet everything we ate was memorable, perfectly cooked, and complementary to the meal.  I look forward to returning!",3,0,0,David S.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",439,258,302

I am in love with ai fiori!The three of us did the 4-course prix fixe with an appetizer, pasta, entree, and dessert. Between our 12 courses and my friend who helped hook us from the kitchen (thank you!!!!!!!!! :D ) we got to try a huge sampling of the menu. Starting from the top:Appetizers:Crispy soft shell crab and prosciuttoRazor clams and fennel: Nice texture to the clams but not as flavorful as I would have liked overallCrispy sweetbreads with pancetta: amazing; the truffle vinaigrette was so good. I usually don't like sweetbreads either but this one was delicious, coated in a lightly fried shell. I'm a fan.Pastas:Ricotta and marscapone ravioliTrofie Nero (black squid ink pasta): Agnolotti braised veal parcels: Egg yolk ravioli and morelsLobster corzetti with mushroomsEvery single pasta dish was a 5/5, and my favorites were the squid ink pasta for the excellent al dente texture and the Agnolotti because the veal was so delicious. Everything was cooked really well though. I'd say if you had to skip one, skip the lobster corzetti because the lobster bites were small and wasn't as good as the other pasta dishes.Entree:Butter poached lobsterLong island duck and foie grasLamb with goat cheese and mint Out of the three, I liked the lobster the best. I only had a small bite but it dissolves in your mouth without you even needing to chew. I've never had lobster like that before. The portion is tiny but so worth it. The lamb is a hefty portion and also very tender, not much of that gamey taste that I dislike. The duck was also good, though a bit chewy for my tastes.We tried almost all of the desserts and my favorites were the brioche, the olive oil cake, and the nutella layer cake.

4.0,4/21/2012,"Located on the second floor of the Setai Hotel on Fifth Ave, the Michelin-starred Ai Fiori sits at the top of a polished marble spiral staircase. As you reach the top, there's a nice bar and lounge area with a modern feel to it. The hardwood-floored dining room is quiet and spacious, with windows stretched across one side overlooking the street. In terms of noise level, it's nice to actually have a conversation with everyone at your table and not be disturbed by the ramblings of other patrons or waiters walking by, something not too common in New York City.Speaking of waiters, service was top-notch the entire evening. This has the potential to be the standard to which I start comparing all other restaurants to. Our waitress was very knowledgeable regarding the menu and was able to give recommendations according to our personal preferences. It felt like she genuinely cared and wanted us to have a great time. We did not give the sommelier an easy job either, but he was able to pick out a decent Pinot Noir to pair with our fish and lamb within our given price range. Glasses were never empty throughout the meal, whether it be water or wine. But the real ""cherry on top"" was when one of our friends had to leave before our meal was actually over. Not only was she able to pay early for her portion of the bill, our waitress even sent her dessert back into the kitchen so they could pack it up to go. If that's not good service, then I don't know what is.Now, onto the crux of it all. We decided to forego the tasting menu and just stick with the prix fixe. To start off, our amuse bouche was a chilled fennel soup served in a shot glass with tiny balls of lemon gelatin. The lemon added a nice citrus note to the soup, which had good fennel flavor to it.For the first course, I ordered the sweetbreads; and to be honest, I had mixed feelings about the dish. My initial thought after the first bite was of popcorn chicken since the coating was on the hard and slightly thicker side. The proportion of coating to sweetbreads in that first bite was not very flattering. But as I ate on, the sweetbreads had a soft and tender texture that went well with the pancetta and truffle sauce. I think more truffle flavor (and less coating) could have elevated the dish, so even though it wasn't bad, I've had better as far as sweetbreads go.The crudo looked fantastic when it was set down, portion size was good and all the pieces were topped with sturgeon caviar. The saltiness of the caviar was nice with the fish, but I wished the fish was more melt-in-your-mouth. My favorite of our first courses, however, was the lobster soup. A buttery and creamy soup with hints of black truffle and immense lobster flavor were poured over fresh chunks of lobster. I could drink that all day.The traditional second course of pasta or risotto followed, but Michael White's pastas taste like nothing traditional. The Trofie Nero pasta was simply delicious in every way. Perfectly al dente and slightly chewy, each bite of pasta and seafood had an added texture with the breadcrumbs sprinkled on top. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of not ordering a pasta at a Michael White restaurant and decided to mix things up with the risotto. Never again. The risotto was way too salty and slightly overcooked in consistency. A very prominent sage aroma went well with the duck and mushrooms, but the dish just could not be rescued.When my third course arrived, I had to fight the urge to pick up the two glorious racks of lamb, one in each hand, and devour the meat from the bones with my teeth. They were cooked to a nice medium rare and tender throughout. The dish had good flavor with the fresh peas and goat cheese panisse.My friend ordered a fish that was cooked well. The meat was firm, but a little flat in flavor so not really that impressive. The duck and foie gras dish was tasty, but sadly inconsistent. Some parts were tender and juicy while others  were tough. The friend who ordered the guinea hen really enjoyed it, so it must have been decent though I didn't try it myself. Overall, as good as everything tasted, nothing was so spectacular that I'd go for a second serving of.Desserts were decent all around. The rum cake was tasty, yet not too sweet, with nice textures from all the components on the dish.Ai Fiori has some great courses here and there, just as long as you pick the right ones. The highs are very high, but the lows, well let's just agree to stay clear from those. They also have an extensive wine list, focusing obviously more around Italian wines. Overall, with solid food and exceptional service, I would definitely return to try the rest of the menu, especially the pastas that eluded me this time around.",2,0,0,Enoch H.,"New York, NY",134,26,25

4.0,4/6/2012,"Here's my overdue review of Michael White's Ai Fiori based on my Restaurant Week lunch! Before my first visit to Ai Fiori, my knowledge of Chef Michael White was very limited. I knew he owned a few high end Italian restaurants in NY but from his typical Anglo-Saxon name I was a bit skeptical at first about the authenticity of the cuisine. Prior to my lunch appointment with my friend at Ai Fiori, I decided to do a little background check on the chef and I was thoroughly impressed!! I learned that he was trained in Italy at the high end restaurant Ristorante San Domenico in Imola, that he is married to an Italian woman, and has won many awards and accolades including James Beard Best New Restaurant Award, 2 Michelin Stars, 3 stars from NY Times, etc. Wow, extremely promising! With high hopes I arrived at this posh and a bit stuffy and corporate restaurant which seemed perfect for corporate power lunch.The ambiance was slightly reminiscent of SHO Shaun Hergatt, but less stylish. I give 3.5 stars for the ambiance, too boring and too aseptic for my taste.Now the food..... Considering it was a Restaurant Week menu, I had realistic expectations and  overall Chef Michael White lived up to them. Considering the RW prix-fixe was only $24.07, food was fantastic especially the pasta with mushroom ragout!!! The dish was simple and yet very sophisticated and exquisite! The cauliflower soup was delicious but it was just too predictable....I'd rather get something more adventurous next time. The chicken was executed nicely and satisfactory but I recommend the pasta more for the entree. Besides the pasta, the chocolate tart with salted caramel and stracciatella gelato was the highlight of my meal. It was soooooo good, the rich and complex flavor of dark chocolate and salted caramel was so addictive!! I also had the chance to try the simple olive oil cake for the first time and I liked it very much but the chocolate tart is hands down the best!!! I'd love to try the full dinner course one day.

4.0,4/5/2012,"Ai Fiori is a gorgeous and well executed Northern Italian restaurant on Fifth Ave. Dear Fiance treated me to the chef's tasting menu a month back as my anniversary present.Ai Fiori is beautiful, at the top of a lazy modern spiral staircase. It is simple, elegant, and dimly lit. Diners tend to speak low and service is quickfooted and exceptionally polite. The captain was especially kind about our time restriction and made sure to explain how the service would work. Plating is very elegant, allowing one to see and taste the quality of the ingredients.My favorites are the sturgeon caviar on cod sashimi, the lobster knuckle soup, and the chocolate semifreddo mousse. Ai Fiori knows their fish and I would heartily recommend them to a seafood lover. My only regret was not having more capacity to finish my king crab pasta or lamb chop, which were two of the heavier dishes.Recommended for very nice dates, and I bet lunch is a great option for business people. 4 stars.",1,0,1,Suanne L.,"Brooklyn, NY",198,979,842
4.0,4/5/2012,"First of all, let me tell you that we were staying at the setai hotel for an extended anniversery getaway and had dinner here as our first major meal in the city.  The restaurant itself is very pleasant inside and had a nice romantic feel to it.  Very soft and quiet (though went around 6:30 so the place hadn't filled in fully yet).  The staff were perhaps some of the best we've had (and we went to several high end restaurants over the weekend).  Our server explained everything to us and gave great suggestions.  We decided to go with the 4 course prix fixe which was more than enough food for us and gave us time to slowly enjoy our meal together.  For the appetizer, I ordered the fio gras (I had never had this before but really wanted to try it).  It was nice and buttery as you would expect after feeding a poor duck to death just to get his liver fatty enough to be spreadable on toasted bread!  My wife had the zupe di aglio (garlic soup) which was one of the best dishes either of us ordered all night.  I then had the risotto with duck confit.  It was amazing and perhaps the best thing I ate all weekend.  My wife had the tortelli which was also nice but a little softer on flavor than my risotto.  I then had the tagliata for my meat dish.  It was decent but not amazing.  My wife liked it more than me -- I was fairly underwhelmed by it.  My wife got the sea bass (spigola) which she really enjoyed except that the fennel flavor on the dish was quite strong and caused everything it touched to taste like black licorrace.  If you like that flavor, you'll love this dish.  The fish itself was cooked and flavored nicely.  We both got chocolate desserts which were both delicious.  Overall, we had a really nice time and the food was above average.  No five stars here just because our main dishes were just ok instead of amazing.",0,0,0,David F.,"Kansas City, MO",0,7,0

3.0,3/28/2012,"this may be somewhat of a barbaric and unhelpful review for those who are actually in search of real food-tology to help decide whether to eat here or not, so here are my early apologies!  My mother and I hustled over here right before the Jeremy Lin show, but had no idea it was such a fancy restaurant.  I had made reservations early because after some quick research-- found the restaurant to be on the top 5 list of something (which I now realize is bc of their famous chef, who unfortunately is not as famous as the 3 best chefs in my book: my grandma, Maggie's mom, and Michelle's dad).  So, overall, this place is more for the experience, which I was not looking for... had enough of the city after 1 day, but had to dreadfully sit through intense sessions of being served upon, where each course was aggressively dislodged before I could completely finish what I was eating, while another 2 servers would come full force after what seemed like they were saying ""ready, set, go"" as my mother and I sat there dazed watching them play table tetris with our utensils (paraphrasing from our server).  Five stars for being attentive servers though.    on to the food...some sort of twist on Italian dishes I think... bursting with all sorts of expensive flavors, but a bit too strong for my steamed-brocoli-conditioned sensitive mouth... I can't remember what the dishes were called, but they were each about the size of my palm, good thing neither my mom nor I were hungry, otherwise they would have been in for a sighting... lobster soup was good, I had some sort of white fish with lettuce and some sauce which was pretty savory, the brussels sprouts with prosciutto side dish was pretty good, and I think we had some salad that was average... I think it would have been better if we came here on the first day with empty stomachs bc the risotto/pastas were worded deliciously on the menu, but the first meal I had in NY already set the standard for everything else we ate... may I present to you, E&E Grill house (near Times Square and the Pearl Hotel), go check it out if you have the chance.",1,1,0,Mary Z.,"Germantown, MD",19,28,42

4.0,3/19/2012,"I made a reservation for 4 about a week in advance for a Saturday night. We were given a table at 8:30pm.  I had noted during my reservation that it was my sister's 25th birthday, but to my disappointment, when we dined there, they did not acknowledge this fact.The menu is organized into categories: per cominciare, pasta e risotto, pesce, and carne. You can order à la carte or you can get the 4 course prix fixe for $89. We decided to order 2 courses à la carte and 2 fixed price menus. This ended up working out perfectly for 4 people.Bread = olive bread, sourdough bread, and whole grain bread. On the table we had lightly salted butter and olive oil. The bread wasn't warm, but it was light and fragrant. The whole grain bread was my favorite, but all were good.Amuse bouche: shot of carrot cumin soup with lime foam. Nice combination of hot and cold. The warm earthy tones of the soup contrasted the high acid notes of the mousse. 6.5 out of 10. Not bad, but not setting our expectations very high.main course off the menu #1 = Trofie Nero, $36.  Ligurian crustacean ragu, seppia, scallops, spiced mollica. The squid ink pasta was served al dente and had a great bite to it. It was filling, satisfying, and perfectly executed. I wouldn't change a thing about this dish. It had texture, it had flavor, it wasn't heavy, it was wonderfully balanced. 9.5 out of 10. Highly recommended.main course off the menu #2 = Agnello, $40. Rack of lamb en crepinette, panisse, romanesco, parmesan.  The lamb was very good, truly melt-in-the-mouth, tender, and moist. I was very impressed with my first few bites, however it was a lot to eat. The romanesco was a nice crunchy textural component and the parmesan worked nicely with the lamb. 9 out of 10. I would order this again.PRIX FIXE MENU #1starter = Torchon (supplement of $5). Ffoie gras au naturel, bosc pear filled with almond zabaglione and balsamic glaze, toasted brioche. The dish was light, delicate, and well executed. Not a mind-blowing, but I could order it again and be satisfied. 8 out of 10.second course = Agolotti with braised veal parcels, butternut squash, black truffle sugo. The first bite was incredible. The veal parcels melted in the mouth and the flavors were earthy, deep, and savory. However, after a while, the dish was a bit one dimensional, especially in terms of texture. Nevertheless, flavor-wise it was an 8 out of 10.main course = Astice. Butter poached nova scottia lobster, root vegetable fondant, and chataeu chalon sauce. I was sorry that we ordered this dish upon my recommendation because it was the most disappointing dish of the night. It was praised by NYTimes, but it lacked a wow factor.  The sauce was good, but I expected better. It was so safe, so boring. Worse yet, the tail meat of the lobster was undercooked. I personally would have said something to the waitstaff and asked for the dish to be corrected, but my boyfriend is too nice to do so. As such, it was a 4 out of 10. dessert = Baba al Rhum with tropical fruit, passion fruit coulis, and crema di coco. While this was delicious and I loved the flavors, it was absolutely not a baba au rhum, at least in the sense of the French pastry that I know and love. First of all, there was no rum flavor, which should be a clear indication that you cannot say your desert is ""al Rhum"", and secondly it was more like a French Toast (it was even served warm, which is not something I've ever encountered with any baba au rhum I've eaten). Regardless, the combination of warm pastry with the cold ice and fruit was good. 8.5 out of 10. PRIX FIXE MENU #2starter = Animelle. Crispy sweetbreads, pomme puree, truffle vinagrette, and pancetta.  Creative presentation and satisfying without being mind-blowing.  7.5 out of 10.second course = Agolotti (see above)main course = Maiala. Red waddle pork loin, boudin noir, gnocchi, apple, and mustard. The blood sausage was delicious, smooth, and studded with lardo. The pork loin was perfectly cooked and the combination of flavors and textures was very successful. Texturally the dish was also satisfying. 8.5 out of 10.dessert = Tartaletta with dark chocolate, red grape, caramelized sherry, walnut gelato. All of the components played well together. 8.5 out of 10. mignardises = chocolate with coconut filling, sand cookie with raspberry filling, chocolate with banana filling, and apricot or peach pâtes de fruits. Not stellar, but well executed.**OVERALL EXPERIENCE = 7.5 OUT OF 10** Service was decent. No frills, no extras, no lingering. It was friendly, but not above and beyond. The food was good, but for the price and reputation, I was surprised to see something fail the way that the lobster did. It is always disappointing to enjoy everything in a meal and then have one dish mar the experience.

It's hard to compare Ai Fiori to Marea (Michael White's Michelin star rated Seafood restaurant which I also enjoyed), but if I were to compare, I would say Ai Fiori is more consistent - every single dish is a hit. While at Marea, some dishes were just significantly more enjoyable than others. For appetizers, we had the Cannolichi, Branzino, and the Insalata Di Astice. My favorite was the Branzino. The bass was full of flavor and was covered with cavier and on top of something crunchy - the texture and flavor was perfection. For pasta/risotto, we tried the Agnolotti, Corzetti, and Risotto. My favorite was the Agnolotti - a kind of ravioli stuffed with veal and butternut squash covered with black truffle oil. The veal and butternut squash are wonderful together inside the thin, fresh ravioli skin. I've never had such fresh and  And the truffle oil gives it so much flavor!For seafood/meat, we got the Merluzzo (atlantic cod), Ippoglosso (atlantic halibut), and the bouillabaisse. I can't choose between the bouillabaisse and the Merluzzo. The seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly in both. The brandade was amazing with the cod. The broth in the bouillabaisse is spectacular!

4.0,2/10/2012,"My coworker and I came here for lunch during restaurant week. The restaurant is located inside a hotel and you have to take the stairs to get to the second level where the restaurant is. The décor is very streamline but also very anonymous, there really isn't a sense of personal style. The crowd is very business oriented and the servers are dressed very professionally although service is actually quite slow. For the appetizer, I had the cauliflower soup--very good! I really liked the currents and extra garnishes accompanying the soup. It really added nice texture and flavor to the dish. Next I had the pan roasted chicken. It was just ok. I actually felt the chicken was cooked a bit pink for my liking but since I don't feel sick at all I guess it's ok. I preferred my coworker's skate but she said that some of the pieces of the fish were unbearably salty. Also I want to note that it seemed to take forever to get our entrees out and when I went to taste the sage jus on my plate, the sauce actually formed a skin! IE this dish had been sitting out. What I enjoyed the most was the pumpkin puree. It was very velvety and smooth, complementing the chicken perfectly (or any poultry dish for that matter). Finally I had the milk chocolate cremeux. I don't know what this says about me but unlike other yelpers, I didn't find it that hard to finish however I did leave the crust. I really liked the salted caramel but I really didn't care for the crust they used. It was kind of tasteless and hard. However i will agree that after a few bites, you are more or less eating it just to finish not because you really think it's wonderful. My coworker had the olive oil cake which was yummier and definitely more balanced.  The bread here is wheat and seemed pretty dried out but there was room temperature butter! Service here isn't that warm.

I was pleasantly surprised with all of the dishes that were served and thought all was excellent (for a restaurant week lunch I opted for a salad with seasonal greens, pan-seared chicken and olive oil cake. I honestly found all to be excellent (albeit small portions, but for me it was perfect for lunch). I've read the four course prix-fixe dinner is probably the best deal at $89 and my lunch experience definitely makes me want to come back so I can try a non-restaurant week meal (and update this review). Based on the menu prices, it's easy to see why the prix-fixe makes sense. Agreed with most critics reviews, service was nothing special. We were seated for a late lunch and it was a half-empty dining room, but the intereraction with our server was minimal and don't recall him coming back to check on us too often. On the plus side, my friend happens to be a frequent customer, enough so that they gave us a small plate of squid ink pasta and a few extra special desserts in addition to what we had ordered so that was a pleasant surprise (I can't imagine how many times one would have to go here to get that level of service though). Interior is nice, modern, but nothing breathtaking.

5.0,2/7/2012,"As a last-minute resort, I decided to come here for a low-key dinner with my girlfriend last weekend. Even though it was a week before, and Ai Fiori is a pretty popular new restaurant, we were able to nab one of the early dinner timeslots at 5:30 via OpenTable. You'll have to climb up a spiral staircase when you enter the Setai Hotel to get to the restaurant, but once you're up there, it's got a very nice, modern atmosphere - dim (but not too dim) lighting, nice big paintings and pictures, and a good amount of space among the tables so you don't feel like you're intruding on other people's meals or conversations. The waiting service was well-done - bread was served frequently, and the dishes were served pretty quickly and explained well. The one strike against the staff is that the waiter who took our order completely got my girlfriend's appetizer wrong - she ordered the scallops, but they brought the razor clams instead. Not a huge deal in the end, because they were good and she was considering ordering that as well, but at a spot like this, I would expect the order-taking to be flawless.The amuse bouche was a carrot and cumin soup served in a tall shot glass. Very good taste on the soup, with the fizz on the top providing a nice buffer when drinking the soup. For our meals, we both went with the 4-course menu (perhaps we'll try the tasting menu again some other time). It's reasonably priced at $89, and you get served courses that will have you filled by the end - as opposed to some high-end spots that serve you tiny portions. For appetizers, the aforementioned razor clams were delicious; they appeared to be steamed and very lightly marinated, in contrast to the heavily grilled and sauced versions of the Spanish variety. The highlight for me was the foie gras pate. It was good on its own, but paired with the pear and the brioche toast - it was divine. I've never had foie gras on brioche before, and this just worked really well to make it a much fuller dish than it is on thinner pieces of bread. It's definitely worth the extra $5 for sure for the fixed price. The pasta for both of us was delicious as well. The squid ink pasta with scallops was so good - I can't really describe what makes squid ink so flavorful, but it just adds a warmth to the dish. I got the spaghetti, which had some heat of its own from the chiles, but paired with the blue crab and lemon, you had a twist on the classic Italian pasta that I could've eaten for a whole meal. I think I preferred the pasta overall to the entrees, though both were delicious. The duck was so fatty and filled with that juicy, smoky flavor the bird often has, and the foie gras is a nice little supplement that works very well with it. The laurel-crusted cod is incredibly flaky - it just comes apart - and the dish comes alive with the black truffles and porcini mushrooms, which, combined with the sauce, give it a very rich flavor. Dessert was probably the weakest part of the servings, but the gianduja mousse comes with multiple layerings of chocolate, all of which taste great with a scoop of the vanilla gelato on the side. The panna cotta is wonderfully fruity in flavor, with the blood orange and the lemon sorbet giving strongly sweet,  yet acidic, flavors to the dish.Aside from the small issue with the appetizer, this was a great meal. You definitely get your money's worth, although I'm tempted to come back just to get a large serving of pasta - to me, this was definitely the best of the main entree-style dishes. The meat and fish is also delicious, and the appetizers are great as well.

3.0,2/7/2012,"Came for restaurant week with a coworker. When I first walked into the Setai Hotel, I could tell this was a ""luxury"" restaurant from the large and stately white spiral staircase up to the actual restaurant. The room is very large with very spacious tables and booths. My coworker and I were taken to an extremely large round table where we were seated next to each other. The service was mediocre, our waiter was there when we needed him but seemed to care less otherwise.The food was mediocre as well, very good but nothing stuck out as spectacular to me. For my appetizer, I had the country terrine appetizer which came with a mustard spread, two tiny pickles and a lovely small baguette and my coworker had the cauliflower soup. The terrine was good, but a little too salty for my taste when put together with the mustard and pickle.The entrees took forever to come out, and as we were getting antsy as we were on a tight schedule. My friend got the tagliatelle pasta which was great, slightly too buttery (which did make it taste better..) I got the skate which came out with a crispy outside and a wonderfully cooked tender meat inside over a sort of lentil spread. The entrees were very good.Then the desserts came out. My coworker's chocolate dessert came out with golden flakes on the top.. perhaps a little too decadent? It was sweet beyond words however and neither of us could finish it. The olive oil cake was better, balancing sweetness and oiliness.I have been looking forward for a long time to trying Marea, but this restaurant week trip may have dampered my enthusiasm just a bit.",1,0,0,Nancy S.,"Manhattan, NY",224,153,2
5.0,2/5/2012,"I tried it during restaurant week. 24 bucks for a three course lunch. I have to mention that I did yelp research before deciding which restaurant week participant restaurant to try. and this is one of few well reviewed French restaurants in the city that participate. I have to say, it's very worth the stars given by yelpers.  a fantastic experience!!  Good service and ambiance! i ordered cauliflower soup to start. it was creamy and flavorful. then hand-made pasta with mushroom as entree. It's very flavorful and unique. I loved it!! Strongly recommend.  My friend ordered pan seared chicken. I tried the chicken. Fantastic! it was well seasoned and crispy on the skin but tender and juicy inside. for dessert, i had milk chocolate cake, and my friend had olive oil cake. Mine had three layers of chocolate, the top layer is almost black colored chocolate scattered with edible gold leaf, and middle layer is like chocolate mousse, but the texture is thicker. and bottom is like chocolate pie crust. For me, it tasted a little over my sweet tolerance, but my friend loved it. we ended up eating each other's cake. For all, i only spent 30 bucks including tips. it's a well worth experience.

5.0,1/30/2012,"Opening a high end restaurant in the midst of a double dip recession is undoubtedly a gutsy move. Of course, it helps when one has the backing from former Merrill Lynch financier Ahmass Fakahany. And it certainly doesn't hurt that the chef in question is Michael White, whose culinary star has been on an upward trajectory since his days prepping at Chicago's Spiaggia. At 21 he started what would eventually turn into a 7 year exploration of Italy's culinary practices, training under revered masters, developing his technique and honing his personal style. He returned to Spiaggia as Chef de Cuisine in 2001 only to move to New York the following year. A partnership with restaurateur Chris Cannon resulted in plenty of accolades and in 2009 produced the extravagant Marea, located along Central Park South and a restaurant that defied the economic crisis. Marea garnered a James Beard Award in 2010 and 2 Michelin stars in 2011. White wisely took advantage of this critical success and went on to open the more casual, less expensive Osteria Morini in SoHo less than a year later. And only a few months later he opened Ai Fiori at the Setai Hotel on Fifth Avenue.As can be expected from a restaurant within a boutique hotel, Ai Fiori's dining room is elegant and the general atmosphere posh albeit lacking the warmth so obvious in White's other establishments. With a front of the house staff previously from Jean Georges, the service is professional and quite simply without fault. PJ Calapa is the Chef de Cuisine and as a hotel restaurant the kitchen is open for all three meals of the day. The dinner menu is the most impressive and highlights dishes inspired by the Italian and French Riviera executed with a refined hand. The appetizer of scallops, truffles, and marrow is appropriately called 'mare e monte' and a dish beautiful to behold. Pasta has been one of White's excelling points over the years and any one of the pasta dishes is excellent. For those who adore meat, the lamb chops encased in ground meat and foie gras and sealed in caul fat is the must have dish off the dinner menu. A 2 course lunch is available for $38 and for restaurant week a 3 course lunch for $24. The cauliflower soup with currants, lamb fat, and anchovy is sublime. The pasta with mushroom ragout is rich and earthy and the chicken with pancetta, brussel sprouts, and squash puree is delicious. For dessert the chocolate tart with salted caramel and stracciatella gelato is divine but even the humble olive oil cake is delightful. All in all the food here is certainly top notch.Given the surroundings Ai Fiori won't exactly top the list of romantic dinner destinations. It's the kind of restaurant more suited to the gourmand who can ignore the lackluster interior and focus on the flavors and craftsmanship of each dish served before him. So come minus your notions of a trendy restaurant and savor the creations of a skilled chef!Report Card (out of 5 stars):Ambience: 4 starsService: 4 starsFood: 5 starsPrice: $16-$48",4,0,1,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",227,1549,2438
3.0,1/29/2012,"Note: this review is based solely on my experience during Restaurant Week lunch.I'm a big fan of Chef Michael White, what with how much I fell in love with Marea just last year. Ai Fiori seems to be quite different from Marea, catering more to the midtown business lunch crowd. The ambiance is nice, for sure, as it is situated inside the swanky Setai Hotel. The service we received, however, was pretty bad for a Michelin-star establishment. Our waiter was unenthusiastic, our entrees took forever to come out of the kitchen and no one even bothered to check up on us, and he even rushed our check right after our table was cleared. Frankly, I don't care if it's RW. It shouldn't be an excuse for any well-respected restaurant to treat customers any differently just because they are paying less. If you're going to participate in RW in hopes of attracting new diners who will hopefully return, then shouldn't you at least make an honest attempt in providing good service?As for the food... everything tasted good but not great. Both appetizers we ordered (the celery soup and terrine) were a tad too salty and nothing special. The bread we were given before our meal was also cold and quite boring. The entrees were a step above the appetizers, however my chicken dish was so unevenly cooked that I was not able to eat half of the plate. The other skate dish was much better than my chicken, especially tender with a crispy exterior. For dessert, we tried both options: a milk chocolate creameux and olive oil cake. The chocolate dessert was beyond decadent, pretty much impossible to finish as it became too sweet after a few bites. I enjoyed the olive oil cake, which was lighter than other versions I have tasted before. Overall the RW menu was just pretty lackluster and standard.Sure, I am always a little skeptical of RW yet somehow can't stay away from the amazing deal to dine at five-star restaurants for a fraction of the regular price. I have certainly had worse RW experiences than my lunch here, but I have also had a number of better RW meals. Unfortunately, Ai Fiori is kind of just stuck in the middle... perhaps I will return in the future for their normal lunch/dinner menu, but I think I would rather spend my money at Marea.",2,1,4,Cecilia Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,644,43
4.0,1/29/2012,"Not a big a fan of fancy food or fine dining but I must say this place served well. No really- I never got such great service for my food ever. The waiting staff were really nice and very kind. Obviously it's there jobs but it deff caught my attention. Now the actual dinner course. You start of with the waiters serving you bread, the various type of breads they served was delicious and not going to lie the bread was really good. Then come out the soups, I had the cauliflower soup which didn't sound so great when I ordered it but turned to be the best part of my meal. Then came the pasta, I got the Rissoto which was not bad but I have gotten better. The best part of this spot besides the waiting staff was the decor of this spot. On the second floor of the Setai Hotel. Getting to the restaurants you got to go up the grand steps entering through the glass doors. Make's you feel royal before even ordering a cocktail. The seating is arranged beautifully. Our large table was placed right by the windows. We had a such a great view of midtown Manhattan. Prices are obviously very expensive, not a average restaurant you could go to for lunch or dinner unless your making the big bucks. Overall the best fine dining spot I have been too.

4.0,1/26/2012,"Direction on finding the restaurant: Walk into the main lobby of the Setai Hotel, bear left up to the stairs on the 2nd floor. (clearly i got lost)Restaurant Week Winter Lunch Menu:My sister had the cauliflower soup and I had the insalata as our appetizers. Her soup was far better than my salad, but the salad was nicely prepared and dressed. The cauliflower soup has pieces of cauliflower in it that gave it great texture against the creaminess of the base.She had the mushroom homemade tagliatelle and I had the skate. The pasta had a warm buttery homey feeling to it, but it lacked in flavor. It would have been perfectly paired with the skate that was savory and delicious with hidden lentils underneath, if it had been presented on the same plate. Luckily, me and my sister shared and got to pair the two. For deserts we tried one of each, the salted caramel dark chocolate tart and the lemon olive oil cake. Both served with a small scoop of gelato, which i wish I had more of. The olive oil cake had a strange after taste but it should be expected with olive oil and the chocolate tart was decadent. I wish I had ordered a coffee with it.The food was prompt and service was great. The waiters all smiled warmly with no hint of judgement for us ordering off the restaurant week menu.

Good, but not great.Diver Scallops @ $42 served in a marrow bone was a disappointment.  Diver scallops are usually plump and juicy.  I believe they took one scallop and sliced it into several thin pieces.""Rack of Lamb"" was prepared median rare but was not a rack but two lamb chops.  No complaint on the size but the taste and the sauce was unmemorable.

5.0,1/23/2012,"One of the best dishes of my life here - the risotto with duck confit was superb. The experience was fantastic. Definitely an older audience at this Michael White establishment, but I found the dining experience here to be more well rounded and enjoyable. My gf and I both had the prix fixe which seems a good deal. I thought the breads and butter selection were weak, compared to some other Michelin rated restaurants. Other than that, everything else shone. The amuse bouche was a delightful, carrot and cumin soup shooter. The cominciare was a lobster soup for her - a fantastic, flavorful and like everything here, a heavy dish. I had the sweetbreads, which had a lot of richness from the mushrooms, but altogether was one of the weaker dishes of the night. The pastas were perfect. I think any Michael White pasta will blow your mind. We had the Spaghetti with Chilis and Crab and the Risotto. Both were perfect. Mindblowing. Legs quivering, body hunched over your bowl, no words shared, longing sighs and altogether not caring about how embarrassing you look perfect. The carne and pesce dishes could never compare. Both were delicious, but not perfect. I had the guinea hen, which was crispy fried which made it way too rich at that point in the evening. My date had the sea bass that looked incredible. It was also prepared masterfully. And the dessert? ha . haha. They left me with that giddiness that a great dessert should. The dark chocolate tart was so much fun to eat!

3.0,1/21/2012,"I know we cannot judge a restaurant based on a ""Restaurant Week' experience, but if the intention of participating in RW is to draw in future patrons, then Ai Fiori did not do such a great job as the year before.  I still vividly remembered my RW lunch last year - a nice selection of bread service (three types of bread available) that was replenished willingly by the waitstaff), the server noted my 'vegan' accommodation on Opentable, and squid ink pasta as part of the appetizer selection.  None of these mentioned points were involved this time around.  Firstly, only sliced bread was served that was mundane and pedestrian; secondly, my server never noted my dietary needs; and thirdly, no squid ink pasta this time around, just salad, terrine, and cauliflower soup.  Nevertheless, I was still hoping for a great RW time, as this was a pre-Lunar New Year celebratory meal that I had with my mom; yet sadly, my expectation just crashed down on me like a jinga puzzle.  I have a weak stomach, so am a victim of random chronic stomach pain.  Out of all the days, it happened yesterday morning.  Now I was NOT going to cancel my reservation and disappoint my mom, so I just wanted a light meal.  I asked the server if I could get a vegerable side with a drink and opt out of the RW menu.  He retorted back and said, ""So you're not hungry at all."" Hmm, no, I am not. Sorry to disappoint ya. It is not like I do not want to taste Chef White's infamous pasta or a 'special' vegan entree. I just could not stomach much that day.  The server warned that the side (at $10) is really, really small and he did not lie.  My black kale (yes, it's organic and all) arrived in a minuscule cauldron that only took me three small bites to finish up.  I had to literally pace myself (along with my drink) to match my mom's entree eating (the pasta with musrhoom ragout was fresh and tasteful, by the way, but should have asked the patron if cheese should be added, as my mom is not a fan of parmesan).  I understand that it is a star restaurant, but when a $10 side dish translates to three bites of green, I am very sorry, but that is just robbery.  Then when it came to dessert time, mom originally ordered the milk chocolate crémeux, but out came the olive cake instead.  Luckily, she was intrigued by the cake, but upon several forks, she resembled the texture to cornmeal. I warned her to switch, but she was being adventurous, which could be a good thing. Now she knows she does not like olive oil scented dessert.  The ambiance, as always, is corporal, clean, and spacious.  Our water glasses were refilled without a reminder and bread plate was refilled involuntarily.  Nevertheless, I was just a tad saddened that part of the service was not hospitable and my favorite multigrain bread rolls were missing for lunch. I am sure the dinner service is better and the regular menu showcases more of this restaurant's caliber. Yet I feel a restaurant should take itself seriously whether it is just a $8 dollar Coke drank at the bar or a $58 rib eye steak ordered at the white table clothed table.  Maybe I will return, but probably not anytime soon.",3,0,4,GarGuPi L.,"Flushing, NY",87,496,1696

4.0,1/11/2012,"I took a really special person in my life here to Ai Fiori for his birthday. Although I may never see him again due to extenuating circumstances, I shall always have fond memories of this restaurant as my experience here was nothing short of lovely and romantic.You wouldn't really think walking in this area that a lovely restaurant was behind those walls.... but there was. Walk up the grand staircase and you are led to the hostess stand which had like 4 hostesses. I keep seeing this lately at restaurants. Why the need for four girls? Can't one... or maximum two, get the job done? Haha oh well, I digress. As we were a little early and I was paying for everything for the birthday boy, I decided that a few birthday drinks at the bar were in order. I loved the bar here. All of the bartenders were very sweet and really took the time to make our drinks... which looked like pieces of art. They were done in the manner of a speakeasy, meaning those little weird measuring cups that look like two funnels stuck end to end, all the uniform jars with ingredients labeled on them, weird spices and plants, large pieces of ice, and the shaking! He shook our drinks like a Polaroid picture and then some! *Andre 3000 enters the room and everyone starts dancing* Plus he put garnishes of fresh herbs in every drink. I don't remember what I had but it was tasty and I asked quietly what plant was in my drink as I stared down at it in confusion. The bartender instantly answered ""Thyme."" with a smile. Interesting choice.So after boozing for 2-3 drinks we got up and told the hostess we were ready to dine. We were then led to our table in this beautiful restaurant. I can see why guys talk about this place as a way to wow the woman... as quite honestly, I was wowed myself. It's one of those really nice places that you always imagined your parents went to when you were a little girl when they would dress up all fancy and leave you with the bitchy babysitter on a Saturday night. Then in an act of revenge, you'd go through mommy's makeup and ruin her $25 lipstick after scribbling pretty pictures on the mirror... and possibly your unconscious brother. ANYWAY. Our waiter greeted us warmly and with obvious knowledge of the menu started discussing with us his recommendations (which we asked for) and also drink pairings. I had never been here before but I had heard more than enough people say that the prix fixe deal for $89 was a ""steal"" so we decided to go with that. You choose an appetizer, pasta, main course and dessert. To be honest I can't remember my appetizer... which means it didn't really stand out for me. The pasta entree, theTrofie Nero, was pure heaven though. It's just as good as everyone says and better. I had never ever had squid ink pasta before (because come on, who wants to eat pasta that's been colored/flavor with an organic chemical that an animal squirts out when it feels threatened??) but I was delightfully surprised on how delicious it was. One day I will come back and ask for just a giant dish of this.... Annnd my mouth just filled with saliva. He chose for his pasta the Spaghetti with blue crab, lemon, and chilis. The chilis definitely gave it a kick! We both tried each others dishes but loved our own dishes more.For our main course, I chose to go full out carnivore mode and ordered the Agnello (rack of lamb) medium rare; he chose the Astice (butter poached lobster in a chateau chalon sauce). These chops were some of the best I have ever had! So tender, juicy, and cooked to the perfect degree of pinkness. I blame the alcohol, appetizer and pasta as by now I was so stuffed that I don't even think I could finish my lamb although I desperately wanted to. I didn't want to be one of those people though at nice restaurant that was obviously stuffing themselves beyond capacity. His lobster was poached perfectly and lightly buttered. I hate it when a restaurant ruins a lobster dish by putting too much butter... lobster is sweet enough already that it barely needs any (if at all) butter on it.Lastly for dessert, I had the Torta di Cioccolato and I can't remember what he got. Now I usually treat dessert as the cap off for the meal and I don't really think the dessert reflected the awesomeness I had just endured for the past 30-45 minutes... but oh well, you can't always end on a strong note. Besides, nothing was going to beat that pasta!To be honest, this isn't a restaurant I would go to for Restaurant Week as it would be pure Hell not to be able to get the Trofie Nero or the lamb.... but I guess you could go for RW then order it on the side?! I don't know. Just don't sell yourself short and only go for that. You need to be able to experience all of the dishes this fine restaurant has to offer you along with its impeccable service and beautiful layout in true form.I guess all that's left to say now is thank you Ai Fiori for a beautiful memory and I hope to return to you soon.",7,8,8,Leslie D.,"New York, NY",1565,656,1217

However when we asked about the 7 course testing menu we were given a very curt/rude response. Host/waiter hurried through a very bland description. ""you get a soup, appetizer, pasta some meat, and two desserts."" While we were planning to get the tasting menu to compare to the others we had tried, his response gave us no inclination to spend $130 each on whatever they were selling. No ingredient list/description at all?We ended up getting the 4 course per-fixed menu and were quite happy. For $90 we got our choice of app, pasta, seafood/meat and dessert or cheese. The seared Foie gras torchon was very flavorful, as was the agnolotti and tagliata. My gf got the salad, spaghetti and anatra and was also very satisfied with her meal. The portions are generous enough to fill you up, while have plenty of flavor and unique presentations. In the end we were glad we only got the 4 course menu.  The butter was quite bland however (guess I've come to expect an Italian restaurant to have roaste garlic or similar) as was the bread selection. For dessert I had the chocolate and she had two of the cheeses from their tray. My dessert was sweet and delicious however she was not impressed with the cheeses they recommended.

4.0,11/28/2011,"I had high expectations of Ai Fiori considering that this establishment had one of the highest reviews among NYC Italian restaurants.  Oh boy......was I disappointed.Coming from DC where there isn't a single good Italian restaurant (or none that I have found so far), I have done my due diligence on yelp and found that this was one of the top restaurants open during lunch on Saturday.  Based on the reviews, I learned that Ai Fiori is the sister restaurant of Marea and is supposed to be tad lower in standards compared to Marea so I figured that this was going to be my best bet.  At $38 for appetizer+main course for lunch I didn't think there was much to lose.For my appetizer, I had the Torchon, a great foie gras dish accompanied by a bose pair filled with zabaglione (custard) filling and toasted broiche (super buttery bread).  The foie gras was topped with a thin layer of glazed sugar (which I could hardly taste).I have mixed feelings about the appetizer.  I like it in the sense that it is novel.  The  foie gras blends well with the buttery broiche and the mixture glides through the mouth as if the food were moving around a frictionless surface.  On the flip side, the buttery broiche masks the taste of the foie gras, and made me wonder if a butter substitution for the foie gras would have been sufficient to trick me on an off-day for my palate.  Needless to say, I would say that pairing of this dish with a strong wine would completely mask the taste of the foie gras....For my main dish I had the dish that everyone raves about...the Trofie Nero aka squid ink pasta, ligurian crustacean ragout, seppia, scallops, spiced mollica.   The one thing I found fascinating about this pasta is the extra ""chewiness"" factor.  I'm unsure what this pasta is, but it appears to be a denser version of a fettuccine-like pasta that was curled in the form of a helix.  This may remind you of rotini but it is not. Imagine a dense fettuccine wrapped around a chopstick.  This form makes you bite through parallel layers of pasta unlike a rotini and this seems to pack the extra punch of ""chewiness"".   The big negative about this dish is that it was overly salty. It already packs a punch of salt from the seafood that goes into it...and it seems as though they added more salt on top of that.  I found that too be a big turnoff.Overall, my impressions of the food were subpar and strictly based on it, I would rate it somewhere around 3.5-3.75* range for a restaurant of this caliber.  The experience, service, and atmosphere were great (a bit of pretentiousness, but if you read the reviews, you were warned) which pushed me to give an overall rating of 4* instead of a 3*.I suggest venturing out to other restaurants in the area.  Apparently, Lupa, Marea, Babbo, Scarpetta are better, if not, equivalent restaurants and I strongly suggest you take a closer look at other options as I have a hard time believing at Ai Fiori provides the best for what you pay in NYC.",3,1,1,Jason C.,"Rockville, MD",343,497,788

There were 4 of us and we had come to celebrate a special birthday. Once seated our experience changed, our primary server was stand offish, unhelpful and made us feel unwelcome. I had asked a question about the prix fix menu, could I split with my friend, the eyes rolled, & while stepping away to check mumbled under her breath, I can't believe she asked that question. Response not permissible. I understood that it might not be possible but instead of suggesting some courses there was just awkwardness. So we're onto our second bottle of wine and decide to order another bottle. Under her breath she mumbles, ""can't believe they ordered another bottle of cheap wine"". Really...there is nothing cheap about the ai fiori experience, so really... onto dessert. One of the guests needed to step away when we were ordering because of an urgent call she had to take, once again the server mumbles, I can't believe ""she"" got up while they were ordering. Ouch... She absolutely killed our evening, it was awkward, uncomfortable and we weren't able to learn about the fun dynamics of the menu. By the 3rd comment we asked for someone else to serve us, any she left, but what I fond surprising is that no one came over to understand what was going on.

It was totally thin, with tiny pieces of truffle and a piece of lobster crudo. The soup was absolutely boring and failed to stand out. The oysters were good but oyster-y.-The pastas were the best course of the night, though I found the Crab one oily. The scallops in the squid pasta were overcooked.-I got the lamb and could not even eat it for how gamey it was. The waiter describes it as ""wrapped in foie gras"" but it's actually apparently wrapped in lamb sausage.. ah.. that explains it. When they saw I didnt like it they offered to bring me another course, but this wasn't until my friend was already almost done with her entree (I'd barely touched mine.) Though it was perfectly cooked, I just couldnt stand the flavor. And the sides it came with!

She liked it though, so I said nothing to her. -I got the bronzino as a replacement, and while better than the lamb, it just failed to shine. And it came with something strangely similar to the velutata.-For dessert I got the cheese plate (only 2 cheese with the prix fix??)  One of the cheeses, the one the cheese guy recommended, was one I thought sounded familiar. Didn't realize where I'd heard of it until I tried it and realized I'd bought the same cheese at whole foods a few weeks back.

The hostess told me that she had just no-showed us since our reservation was made for 8:00 pm.  I was really confused about this since I am pretty sure that with our work schedules that I would NOT have made a reservation for 8:00 p.m.  I mumbled an apology before they escorted us to our seats.  After the fact, I double-checked my email confirmation from OpenTable which confirmed that I HAD in fact made a reservation for 8:30 p.m.  So, turns out the hostess was rude and WRONG about the reservation.   Kind of a turn-off if you are going to spend a couple hundred dollars on food and wine. At any rate, the food was good, and occasionally great.  Of our meal between the two of us, we went with the four course prix-fixe ($89 per person (not including the $10 supplemental to the veal chop, and birthday boy got a paired wine tasting to match - $50pp).  Definitely recommend the uovo (egg) with veal sweetbreads and lobster knuckles, the squid ink pasta was fantastic.  I had the agnoletti, but preferred the squid ink pasta - it was just better. The lobster in chatalon sauce was super tender and delicious.  The birthday boy's veal chop tasted OK.  The budino was recommended by the server, but I was really confused about what it was supposed to taste like since the flavors were too subtle or something.  I probably should have gone for something citrusy or fruity since I prefer citrus or fruit flavors in dessert. I'd probably still recommend it for a good business meal and if you know what to order, it could really be great.  However, if you're going to spend well over $200 a couple and after dealing with a rude hostess, I probably won't go back unless someone else wants to pay.

Appetizer: blue crab prosciutto and watermelon ( recommend, except it was only 3 slices of prosciutto served);  Amber Jack Tartar - very fresh;  blue crab Spaghetti (this one is actually not that special to me)Entree: Pan roasted cod - fish is great, but the vinaigrette sauce was way too sour.Rack of Lamb - my favor dish, 2 thick lamb shops, I had it medium, and it came out little bit on the rare side, but still tasted great!squid ink spaghetti - it's a creamy delicious dish, but I am just not a carb person.Dessert: panna cotta and  chocolate creama with caramel gelato - they are both great and not too sweet!Definitely will be back!",1,1,1,Babe A.,"New York, NY",31,51,63
5.0,10/12/2011,"OK, I know I must be spending way too much money these days on food but take a look at the pedigree and you will have to agree not only are the last 3 restaurants I have dined in 5 star but Ai Fiori too is perched on that lofty tier. Our meal was the 4 course prix fix with a wine pairing. It made sense since we like to try each others foods and it would give us the best impression of what to expect; everything was very good! I had the lobster knuckle and sweetbreads, seafood spaghetti, butter poached lobster and panna cotta, she the crab, the veal purses, bouillabaisse and olive oil cake. The wines were chosen and I went with a traditional flight and she had only reds - I applaud the sommelier on his choices but neglected to have him write them down for us. This was a great meal, good service in a modern dining room. The place was packed by 8:00 pm and I can only expect more great reviews from this restaurant.

5.0,10/1/2011,"The service and food was amazing! When dining at Ai Fiori, I highly recommend the prix-fixe for $84 if your budget allows it. I started off with the royal blush cocktail that was absolutely refreshing. The chef gave my boyfriend and I a complimentary mushroom soup which was  delicious. I then had the vellutata and my date had the granchio which were both very good. The vellutata was a light lobster bisque with beautiful plating. The second dish was the pasta and we ordered the tortelli and trofie nero. I ordered the tortelli based on all the amazing reviews about it and the reviews did not lie! However, my boyfriend's pasta was absolutely amazing...I was so jealous... Next came the third dish (carne) where I had the roasted hen and my boyfriend ordered the lamb. I'm not a fan of lamb since it's so gamey, but considering it is the best in NYC I decided to try it. My boyfriend loved it but there is a reason why I dislike lamb no matter how amazing it is cooked. I had the roasted hen which was tender with a marsala reduction. Finally, the dessert. I had the tartaletta which was heavenly and I am still thinking about it! My boyfriend had the Baba  al Rhum which, he cleaned off even though we were so full at the end of our meal. I definitely recommend this restaurant which I picked out after pouring through top restaurant reviews...all which were reserved. So all though this was a last minute pick I'm more then satisfied. The service and food is excellent for the price and fancy enough for a romantic occasion such as our anniversary.",0,0,0,Ashley C.,"Geneseo, NY",104,14,1
4.0,10/1/2011,"3.75 Stars.  Delicious food. Uninspiring dessert.  Child-size servings.  Excellent service.I picked Ai Fiori for a recruiting lunch.  Anyone who works in Times Square knows that the dining options in the area are not as great as those 10 or so blocks north.  It was a bit of a trek, but it was a gorgeous afternoon and I don't regret the choice.  It is a beautiful space.  Lots of dark wood and glass.  The tables are set with decorative plates.  It feels a bit stuffy due in part to the demographics of the patrons -- the candidate and I were the youngest people in the restaurant by about 20 years.  The service was excellent.  The waitstaff were a great balance of formal and friendly without being disingenuous or pretentious.  On to the food... I had the Granchio, this is a crab salad, sitting on a thin slice of water melon with very small pieces of proscuitto primarily as garnish. It was light and tasty.  For my second course I had the Trofie Nero.  This was very flavorful and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was an ink pasta, I would guess gemelli, but I'm not certain.  The serving was smaller than the size of my fist -- like a child's size serving.  Be prepared.  There were bits (tiny bits) of seafood, the only one I could make out for sure were the scallops.  This was all sitting on a small amount of a tomato-based broth.  This was definitely the showstopper and pulled the dish together perfectly.  Dessert, however, was a major disappointment.  I had the Citrus Tart only because everything else didn't look very appealing (they wheeled over a little tray).  It was extremely tart, by citrus they must mean primarily, if not exclusively, lemon.I'm genuinely torn with this review.  I had a great experience and for the most part enjoyed everything I ate, as did the candidate.  My primary reservation is that I don't feel compelled to return.   I feel as though there are many comparable places in the City that provide food that is just as great.  I would honestly only return if I had a business lunch or dinner.",0,0,0,Tanisha C.,"Brooklyn, NY",233,184,192

4.0,9/20/2011,"Great meal and there probably aren't many better deals in the city than the $79 4-course prix fixe offered at Ai Fiori. I would highly recommend going before the restaurant undoubtedly gets a Michelin star and then ups its price like most restaurants do once they gain credence.

We had young children with us and they were solicitous of them as well. We had the 4-course prix fixe. The vichysoisse was unique, a work of art with chorizo oil and oysters. Next was veal pouch pasta, very delicious. After that I had the poached lobster. While this was also delicious, it could have used a little more salt. Then dessert, all very tasty. The waiters inexplicably forgot to bring my desssert with everyone else's.

5.0,9/15/2011,"I went for their prix fixe dinner.  I must say that overall, the meal was sublime.I started with their green salad and while very simple, it was very nice.  I then had the tortelli ravioli.  The pasta was beautiful...so fresh...just divine!The halibut dish was sheer perfection...the fish was perfect and the accompaniments nicely chosen.The tartaletta dessert was indeed very interesting....an unusual mix of flavors so as I scooped up a bit of the chocolate tart as well as some of the various items placed alongside it, first I'd get a mocha flavor, and then a bit of grapefruit.  This dessert certainly was no boring chocolate dish!The service was very attentive.The only downsides were that 1) the restaurant seemed almost full to capacity and as such, the noise level was quite loud.  We had to yell to talk to the person seated next to us (there were six of us at the table).  2) I found the overall design and ambiance of the restaurant a bit too formal for my taste.  I love good food, but prefer it in more of a down-to-earth or intimate atmosphere, which this place was not. This place is good if you want to impress someone or make them think you have alot of money, or else it's good for expense-account type people.  For me however, ti's really not my kind of place, though the food was so damn good!!Was it worth the $84 prix fixe price?  I think so, considering that everything I had was quite perfect and the service was very good.",0,0,0,Lisa e.,"New York, NY",54,320,20

5.0,9/10/2011,"I was looking for a special place to take friends who aren't foodies. But, I am and my husband is diabetic. It was a short list and Ai Fiori kept coming up.We went on a Friday night and the noise level was perfect-- a soft hum that made it place feel lively but didn't interfere with conversation.I was stunned by how good an old chestnut like vichyssoise can be made to taste. The soup was velvet perfection and the oysters on top were a luxury addition that made sense. I had to have the Uovo being a long time fan of surf and turf esp if offal is involved I adored it.. One friend ordered a salad with heirloom tomatoes and was a clean plate ranger.The pastas were uniformly terrific. If the risotto with bone marrow weren't so elegant you'd describe it as the perfect plate of comfort food.Everyone was happy with the mains-- superb steak, the lamp chops and bronzino. I can't fairly comment on the desserts as the guest of honor-- the salad eater rapidly established hegemony over them. The two bits I had were delicious.  I did adore the petit fours and chocolates with coffee.The Somm chose a perfect wine, exactly to my taste and less than the budget I gave him.All of the service was extraordinary. They were there when you wanted them and yet never interrupted the conversation. I was thoroughly impressed. I was truly delighted by the attention paid to my husband's special needs. One of the managers --a beautiful petite Asian woman in a tux-- brought out his cheese plate personally a moment before the cascade of chocolate ones arrived. She chatted with my husband about the cheese while the server spread the chocolate around. Her thoughtful professionalism was a real moment of grace which vaulted Ai Fiori to the top of our list.

3.0,9/2/2011,"Having been several times for breakfast on weekends, decided to try Ai Fiori with two friends for lunch midweek, on a nice day cool enough to walk from midtown to the Setai Hotel in Koreatown.  Michael White is an enormous talent.  Convivio never disappointed and Marea produces flawless dishes full of memorable accents and grace notes that make you want to come back again and again.    The hostesses at Ai Fiori are warm and welcoming; waitstaff are extremely friendly and solicitous.  There's no attitude to be had here.   It's also a pleasantly elegant space, albeit with some odd touches like tables for four that are somewhat oversized. Presentation and service were excellent.  But, we expected to be wowed by the food and regrettably were less than overwhelmed.  A salad was pedestrian at best.  Sardines held more visual interest than taste.  Lobster bisque was barely lobster-like and more like saffron colored clotted cream with lobster chunks that were completely flavorless. The agnolotti also were beautifully presented but a little gummy, with an indeterminate filling and served in Lilliputian portions that left us all craving hearty plates of pasta.  The pesto sauce and sprinkled pine nuts were tasty once seasoned at the table (we had to ask for a salt shaker).  But they seemed more of a concession to minimalist saucing than an element to lend the dish coherence or complement the green colored pasta.  How can basil be reduced to being mere food coloring?    We all skipped desert but loved the Haitian Blue Forest coffee brewed to perfection.  It was a well orchestrated balance of roundedness and acidity with a smooth chocolate finish.  A spectacular finale can somewhat erase the ordinariness of what preceded it.   Lower expectations perhaps would have made this a passable meal.  But it's odd to finish lunch still hungry and wantonly taste deprived.",0,0,0,Peter R.,"Manhattan, NY",20,24,0

Loved the Uovo (slow poached egg, lobster knuckles, crispy veal sweetbreads, nuage layon) and had a bite of the Torchon (foie gras au naturel, charred peach mostarda, lemon balm, brioche toast) very rich and fantastic.  Pasta course everyone got the Risotto riso acquarello, lobster, bone marrow, saffron, shellfish jus friggin amazing.

4.0,8/29/2011,"We are big Michael White fans and have been wanting to try Ai Fiori and recently got the chance.  Overall it was a great meal, however there were some aspects of the meal that we were disappointed by.  First of all at this type of establishment, when we made our reservations and confirmed them we told them that the dinner was to celebrate a birthday, the very least we expected was some silly candle in the dessert.  However when dessert came there was no candle, definitely someone dropped the ball on that one.  Also, there was a big lag time between our courses, it ended up being a 3 hour dinner only for 4 courses!  Now onto the food...dont read on if you do not want a play by play of our meal. Word of advice, we were very torn between the 4 course meal and chef's 7 course tasting menu, even though they do not list the courses for the 7 course on the menu, the waiter does have a copy of it and we would recommend asking.  Once we heard the courses slated for the tasting menu we knew we just wanted to pick our own courses!   Amuse bouche: Yum, we wanted a bowl of this!  Tomato gazpacho soup topped with olive oil.  Just a clean refreshing start! Apps: We started off with the foie gras and the slow poached egg.  The foie gras was amazing and came with these mustards which added quite the contrasting taste to the foie gras.  The only downfall of that dish were the toast points the dish came with.  The toast was a poor vehicle for the fois gras because it was tooo thick, we ended up using the dinner bread for the foie gras.  The slow poached egg was great, it came with sweetbreads, lobster, mushrooms, lots of contrasting flavors but a great dish.   Pasta: We had the agnolotti filled with braised veal and the squid ink pasta with squid, the pasta is just so good, freshly made and cooked perfectly al dente, everytime we have pasta at one of michael white's restaurants, we are left wanting more! Dinner: veal chop served with smashed potatoes and sage, pancetta, and the butter poached lobster.  The lobster just melts in your mouth! Dessert:  In all of our times visiting Michael White's restaurants, we always feel like dessert is lacking.  We are never impressed by dessert.  We got the tartaletta and the chocolate mousse.  So the tartaletta was described as dark chocolate so we assumed a dense dark chocolate tart.  This dessert makes me think that the pastry chef has ADD, there is not one cohesive thought going on.  First of all the tart is filled with a liquidy dark chocolate mixture, it seems like they forgot to bake the tart!  That caught us off guard, and than it was accompanied by the weirdest things, they threw on some hazlenuts (i know that was suppose to complement the hazlenut crust), that pieces of grapefruit, than some basil, than some grapefruit foam, straciatella ice cream and than some.  This dessert was left half finished.  The second dessert was multiple layers of chocolate mousse with different types of chocolate.  Once again not the strongest dish.  The mousse was not silky and the white mousse tasted like .  The petit fours were coco financier, passion fruit jelly candy, salted caramel chocolate and another chocolate.  Chocolate is not their forte!  We liked the jelly candy and financier.   Overall we would definitely return but would stay away from the chocolate desserts.",0,0,0,CE C.,"New York, NY",3,323,0

4.0,8/24/2011,"This restaurant was recommended by a friend and I'm glad my wife and I went. The dining room and the service were superior to the food but we still had a few pretty special items. I started with the Uovo. It was a bland looking dish with flavorless lobster chunks. The sweetbreads on the other hand were rather crispy and quite tasty. The egg yolk did not perform as promised in that it did not add any richness or complexity to the dish it only added color to the otherwise colorless ""cloud"". My wife had the Vellutata which was good but quite common tasting and on the very thin side.The Second course was much better. My wife had the Tortelli which was one of the best dishes of the night. Rich delicious blend of cheese in the most perfect pasta you've ever tasted. I had the Veal agnolotti which were delicious, tender and soft pillows of meat joyousness. My only complaint on this course was the portion size on the agnolotti was very small. I wanted more of those flavors and textures. By the end of the third course I was really looking forward to what turned into the star of the night, rack of lamb en crepinette. It was divine. Lamb mixed with foie gras, assembled back on the bone, wrapped in caul fat and then seared with bread crumbs. What's not to love about that? My (Boston) wife had the butter poached lobster and seemed to think that it was some pretty tasty lobster.The desserts were phenomenal and overkill at this point. My tartaletta was excellent minus the grapefruit foam which was too bitter and nonsensical with the sweet chocolate. The pana cotta was terrific. It was sweet, light and very refreshing.The overall experience was a very good one. The service was impeccable, the dining room was beautiful and we got a nice surprise from mother nature with a showy lightning storm during dinner. The wine pairings were also quite good.

2.0,7/23/2011,"Friday 6 people. 100 degree weather outside.Greeting: Hostesses were nice. Identified the reservation and as I was the 1st one there, I was directed tot he bar for drink. Bartenders: Two guys behind the bar. Incredibly friendly, likeable & knowledgeable. They make their job look easy and it's not. Some of the best ice cubes I have ever had. They come in two sizes: perfectly dry (1"" X 1"") cubes and then the ""big one"" which is at least 2"" X 2"". Really nice conversation piece. Waiter: He seemed nice and professional at first.  Talked us through the menu and explained our dining choices. He essentially talked us out of the Chef's tasting. This caused bewilderment at the table. What server talks a table out of a higher priced ticket item? Our conclusion was either that he wasn't confident in the menu and had witnessed first hand disappointment or it was a lazy Friday night and the kitchen had mentioned that they weren't in the mood to do the tasting menu. We all spoke about never being talked out a Tasting menu anywhere previously.  Drinks: Great ice cubes aside, the drinks could not have come any slower. People sat at the table with empty glasses repeatedly though the meal. You would think at $15+ cocktails, you would want to sell as many as you can as a server. It wasn't only the taking of the drink order but it was the filling of said order. 10 real minutes between ordering a drink and when it hit the table was not uncommon.Food: As per the waiter's suggestion we did the Prix Fixe menu and passed some plates around the table. I will only write about what i actually tasted. Granchio (Blue crab, Watermelon & Prosciutto)- GREAT summer dish. Light, refreshing and full of flavor. On a hot night like last night, it was a perfect fit. Something worth ordering.Uovo (Lobster, Egg & Veal Sweetbreads) - This dish was discussed on Yelp A LOT & I was looking forward to it as I love egg on almost anything including over pasta & pizza.  My advice for this dish is simple. If you do not like foams, do not get this dish. The flavors were good independently but for my taste, there was just too much foam. I guess it was my own fault for not looking up or asking for the definition the French word ""nuage"" which turns out to mean ""cloud"". Conceptually interesting but I felt like i was pulling the pieces of lobster out of dishwasher bubbles. Trofie Nero (Squid ink pasta w/ scallops) - Here is the dish that all Yellpers talk about and once again, they did not disappoint. As one of my fellow diners said ""I work 3 blocks from here. There is no question I am coming here next week again, JUST to have this dish""  I won't expand much more b/c it is every review but it was close to a perfect dish and a must have. If you are a texture person, this dish is for you.Spaghetti (Blue crab, lemon, bottarga, chilies) - I got talked out of the Risotto and into this dish by the waiter. I should have been smarter than to listen to this guy and ignore Yelppers but alas, i was not.  Other people at the table like it. I thought it was forgettable. Either be edgy like the Trofie Nero or be comfort food pasta, don't walk the line. That's what this dish did. It's a skip in my opinion. I came INCREDIBLY close to ordering the Risotto as an addition to the Prix Fixe and still wish I would have.Agnello (Rack of lamb en crepinette, swiss chard crochetta, sariette)- Do not order this dish during the summer. It's just too heavy. Another one of the diners hit the nail on the head when he said "" This would be great in the middle of winter paired with a nice Merlot"".  It actually might be something I would try again but last night, it was appealing to anyone at the table. Unless you LIKE Foie Gras, do not get this dish. There isn't just a hint of Foie, there is a lot. They seemingly have ground the lamb up, added the Foie and then wrapped it back up on the bone.  The sides were completely forgettable  lacked congruity and didn't look like they belonged on the plate. Bottle line though is the Foie overpowers the lamb and you can't get away from it. If it's for you, enjoy.Faraona (Roasted hen, baby fennel, tomato confit, taggiasca olives, lemon-thyme jus) - Really nice plate. Well cooked. Great crisp on the skin. Nice layer of fat in between the skin and meat. Meat was tender and moist. Very moist. Something worth having more than once. If you do have this dish & like it, go to A Voce and have the chicken. It fits the same flavor profile but better.We ordered a bunch of different desserts and none of them were anything worth talking about. We had 4 different desserts and I don't recall anyone saying anything great about any of them. A lot of the plates seemed disjointed with random gelees, dollops, foams and fruit that left us all a little confused.  These desserts belong in a Prix Fixe where you have no choice but to get it. $960 with tax & tip.There are a LOT better places to spend this kind of money than here.See my other reviews",4,0,0,Jonathan H.,"New York, NY",57,113,86

4.0,7/13/2011,"Rating: 4.5, Date Dined: 7/9/2011We were five ladies gathering for a surprise birthday dinner. The birthday girl was indeed surprised and the food was fitting for the occasion.FoodGiven that this is a Michael White restaurant, we had very high expectations for the seafood. I did check Yelp beforehand for some recommendations, wanting to eat the best of the best while I was here.The amuse bouche was a shot of almond ""soup"" dotted with olive oil and chili oil. It was unique and definitely whet our appetite for the meal. For my appetizer I chose the Trofie Nero and I am so glad that I did. It is one of the most exciting dishes I've eaten this year. The black squid ink pasta had the perfect texture and shape to pick up the pieces of succulent and spiced shellfish as well as to attract the buttery toasted breadcrumbs. The sauce is light but deep in flavor. I am still thinking about this dish. For my main course I tried the Ippoglosso (Atlantic halibut). It was a beautifully presented dish. The fish was well cooked but sadly under-seasoned. Everything else on the plate, the foie gras mousse stuffed morels, the asparagus, the hollandaise on top of pea puree, was delicious. Most of the other ladies chose the cod as their main course and all of our plates were clean by the end of dinner. We shared two desserts. The olive oil cake was my favorite. It was moist and very flavorful with an invisible crust of crunchy sugar on top. The Chocolate ""Budino"" was a gorgeous masterpiece that they presented with ""happy birthday"" written on the plate. The chocolate mousse encased in gelee was technically stunning. The meal ended with delightful petit fours.Service & AtmosphereTo get to Ai Fiori, you need to walk up a massive winding staircase from the lobby of the Setai. Upon entrance there is a very large bar where I saw some people dining. I was the first to arrive and was greeted by 5-6 people standing at the front desk. This is certainly a fancy restaurant in where there is ample staff on hand. For a Saturday night, the main dining room was perhaps 2/3 full. It seemed to be a mix of visitors and special occasion diners. The service was professional and trying to be warm, but not quite making it there. Our main waiter did everything right but the rapport seemed a bit forced. Nonetheless the service is on par with the restaurant's stature.We only had one bottle of Sancerre between the four drinkers at the table and the meal was around $100 per person. Next  time I'd like to try the $84 4-course prix fixe menu. The lasting impression I have of this place (other than the great company enjoyed throughout our three-hour birthday dinner) is the Trofie Nero. I can't stop dreaming about it. I want to bring friends back to dine at the bar and to try this dish.",0,0,0,Nancy B.,"New York, NY",13,18,12

Then when S arrived, we were taken to the dinner table and our server's (Michelangelo) description of every dish made me want to drool.  The way he described everything made it seem like a super special occasion.Onto the food!  We started with the much lauded Uovo and Lobster Vellutata.  The Uovo was good, but after reading all the amazing reviews, I think I expected more.  However that ""more"" came in the form of the Vellutata which was utterly delicious.  It is basically a very tasty light lobster bisque. I think S would agree that mine was better than his =DBut the star of the night were the entrees!  The Trofie Nero is one of the most amazing pastas that I have ever had. The combination of the home cooked black squid ink pasta with tiny crumbles of toasted bread crumbs and scallops just exploded in my mouth.  I'm having cravings  just thinking about it right now and I can't wait to go back and have it again.S had the lamb.  I am not a big lamb fan but this version was once again, one of the best I've had.  Barely gamey, perfectly succulent and juicy that I can't even believe S left any on his place.   The portions were definitely generous.If you want good Italian - definitely check out Ai Fiori",2,0,1,Kathy L.,"New York, NY",109,298,69
5.0,6/11/2011,"Full review blogside - notable dishes below:""Uovo,"" a foamy deep bowl containing a slow poached farm egg, lobster knuckle, crispy sweetbreads, and ""nuage layon.""  Perhaps the most intriguing of the night's dishes and invariably my favorite this delicate potage was complex, rich, and balanced with the crispy offal, snappy lobster, and creamy egg all blending marvelously and ample notes of butter and notes of dry wine and sweetness permeating the palate.  Amazed that something so rich could be so delicate it should also be noted that unlike many restaurant soups this dish was served piping hot - a great decision as the egg seemed almost to have been added raw prior to service allowing it to cook as minimally as possible by the time it arrived tableside.""Piccione"" - an impressive half Squab with crispy lacquered skin overlying the tender breast and leg.  With the squab itself tasty and nicely prepared the plate-mates were equally impressive with a creamy parsnip puree juxtaposing the crispy skin and sweet Madeira sauce with mushrooms highlighting the nutty tones of the bird.  Finally, to finish the dish there were two small nuggets described as ""Liquid Foie Gras Croquettes"" that added a whimsical (and delicious) note to the otherwise classic plate; all in all a fantastic composition.""Risotto"" featuring Acquarello rice simmered to a nearly rice-pudding texture this dish was subsequently studded with chunks of butter poached lobster, pools of melting bone marrow, notes of saffron and salinity from what was described as ""shellfish jus.""  Intensely rich and the incredibly decadent this dish reminded me much of a similar option at Chicago's Spiaggia with the lobster replacing Octopus and the price-tag at about 2/3 what Montuano charged for a smaller portion - in other words, this risotto was not only delicious, but a sizeable portion at a bargain price.""Sogliola"" featuring wild caught Holland Dover Sole with crispy salsify, beurre noisette, lemon, and parsley was a whole fish preparation carrying a supplemental fee that was entirely worth it and then some.  Another enormous preparation with each filet eclipsing a foot in length the protein itself expertly cleaned and prepared to be flaky and moist while the salsify added a textural juxtaposition and the mild nutty tones of the sauce brought out the sweetness of the fish in full effect.""Sformata di Cioccolato"" was delivered as a tall cylinder of airy chocolate Mousse coated in cocoa powder and topped with candied pine nuts this dessert was shockingly light and creamy yet at the same time rich and complex.  With a small smear of lightly lemon tinged honey  serving largely as decoration and a ball of Stracciatella gelato atop more of the pine nut crumble this was ""cake and ice cream"" done well.""Chocolate Budino"" with Pedro Ximénez, Amarena Cherry, Yogurt, and Vanilla Gelato was about as far from a traditional pudding ""budino"" as possible, but it was absolutely delightful.  Served as a large chocolate wafer dusted with cherry powder atop thickened Greek yogurt, chocolate sponge cake, and crunchy chocolate cookies soaked in sherry the best way to describe this dish would be a more grown up, more nuanced, and more elaborate black forest cake.Aside from a couple small service issues that were quickly remedied I really enjoyed the evening and despite the rather dull room the food itself was at worst common and at best exemplary - a feeling best surmised when a member of our party stated ""there wasn't a single weak dish"" and given the number of things we tasted I think that says a lot.",8,1,2,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",3078,4440,99503
5.0,6/10/2011,"Ai Fiori is one the best NY restaurants that I have eaten at this year.  I can't believe I waited months to write a review of this gem.  Hands down, they have some of the best lobster I have had in my life. A food memory for sure. Upon entering the restaurant in the Setai Hotel, you are absorbed into an atmosphere of pure luxury.  The restaurant is not necessarily beautiful, but it is modern, sleek, and exudes luxury without overdoing it.  It does feel a bit anonymous with the earthen color palette, but with the large windows with NY skyscraper views and the incredible food, who needs anything else? This setting definitely sets the tone for the food that allows the flavors to meld beautifully without overwhelming the palate.The bar is very hip and is  designed like a pharmacy. The bartenders even wear lab coats. The cocktails are expensive but excellent and like a pharmacist, the ingredients are marked to precision for just the right dosage.For a fine dining restaurant, it had zero snob factor.  The warm waitstaff was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Helpful but not intrusive.  And you had the feeling that they genuinely wanted you to love your experience here. The sommelier had excellent wine pairings and came over to explain each wine in detail. She even came over to consult with us over one of our wine pairings because she said she felt conflicted because she had not given us any red wines for our pairing and wanted to make sure we were getting the full experience. So nice!   All of the wines she guided us through went smoothly with the meal.The prix-fixe and tasting menus are relative bargains for NYC.  I would definitely go with one of these options. All of the courses were beautifully plated. Also note this is definitely the right restaurant for seafood lovers.  The crudo of fluke, sea urchin, lemon oil and sturgeon caviar was clean and fresh tasting.  I absolutely loved the delicate gnocchi scented with saffron and accompanied by crab meat and sea urchin. Each piece of gnocchi was an explosive bite of heaven.  However, the best course was definitely the butter-poached Nova Scotia lobster with root vegetables.  The lovely indulgent sauce paired with the perfectly cooked lobster gets my vote for one of my best dishes this year. And yes perhaps the best lobster I have ever had.  It made me forget the lobster that I had in Rio a couple of months ago that changed my view of lobster. Now I have Ai Fiori and do not need to hop a plane! I For dessert, the best is the baba al rhum. However, I also enjoyed the dark chocolate tart with grapefruit and hazelnut gelato.

The Bad:*The lunch menu (at least on weekends) is much more limited than the one online, and there is no prix fixe option.  This was very frustrating because I had wanted to try a few dishes clearly on the online lunch menu.  When I asked about them, the server said that they were only available at dinner.  Ugh.    *They refuse to split dishes.  Our server offered to bring out two plates and split a dish for us table side, which was very generous.  While the two plates showed up (brought by a different server), no one offered to split them for us and there were no serving utensils for us to just do it ourselves.  Very frustrating (and a bit messy as it turned out).The Ugly:*Both fish dishes we tried were pretty close to disasters.  The cod was dramatically oversalted.  My dining companion had about four bites and I had one.  No one asked if there was a problem even though the vast majority of the dish went uneaten.  The halibut was far from fresh.  It seemed to have sat in the window for far too long, resulting in a strange crust around the accompanying pea puree and very sad things happening to the once-beautiful morels.  Had this not been a mother's day meal, I would have sent the halibut back in a heartbeat.*As a result of them not offering the prix fixe option, our meal for two (1 appetizer, 2 pasts, 2 fish entrees, 1 dessert, 1 scoop of ice cream, 2 diet cokes, and 1 glass of wine) was $210 with tip.  Seemed very expensive for what we got.  You will see by my other reviews that I am in no way adverse to paying for a nice meal, but we could have had lunch at Eleven Madison Park for that price, and this was not even close to being in that world.",3,0,0,Adam C.,"New York, NY",17,42,0
5.0,5/4/2011,"4.5 StarsDecadent, amazing, and definitely can't wait to return are ways I would describe Ai Fiori.Let me start off by saying, my customer who I took to dinner here was raving about this steak house all night long, how great it was and etc.  At the end of the dinner, he said forget the steak house, we're coming back here again.Inside the Setai Hotel on the second floor is Ai Fiori.  A cool, modern, chic restaurant with a lounge like feel.  Service was excellent, dining room is beautiful, and food was absolutely delicious.We ordered the four course meal which on the website is $79 but they now upped it to $84.For the first course, I had the foie gras torchon.  Very well made with excellent pieces of brioches.  It came with a side that was quite sour (quince?) that I didn't feel complement the torchon well but nevertheless the torchon by itself was very good.For pasta/risotto, my customer ordered what I think is a squid ink pasta with diced scallops and bread crumbs.  I haven't had this feeling in a long time about pasta.  OMG was what I was thinking when I took the first bite (we shared our food).  I don't remember eating such a great pasta in a long, long time.  I was rather jealous he ordered it.  I ordered the uni gnocchi with crab meat.  There aren't pieces of uni in there but I think it is melted when they cooked the gnocchi which is why the pasta was yellow.  The gnocchi didn't come in big pieces like the traditional way but instead it came in small pieces which made the dish light and not too heavy.For our third course, he ordered the bouillabaisse and I ordered the pan roasted cod.  The bouillabaisse was excellent although I only tried a few things and the pan cod was very well made, the only draw back was the watercress pesto was a bit salty.For dessert I had the tropical fruit and passion fruit coulis.  It was refreshing, light, and the presentation was so beautiful I didn't want to ruin it.  But eating it was the right decision; bite after bite I was just thinking wow, can this get any better?Finally the service was great and so were the olive rolls.  I thought the portions weren't going to be enough but it ended up very filling.  I think I have a new favorite restaurant.",1,1,1,Pierre L.,"Burlingame, CA",12,408,25
3.0,4/25/2011,"Breakdown: 3.5 stars for food, 2.5 stars for ambience/service.Went for dinner, chose the pre-fixe dinner for $84... food was very, very good, particularly the Gnochetti (saffron gnocchi with crab and sea urchin), the Tortelli (ricotta & mascarpone ravioli with boschetto cheese), and the Astice (butter-poached lobster with root vegetable fondant) -- but none was at the level of being: WOW, THIS IS AMAZING. Service was very good overall, but a bit spotty with our main waiter, who seemed to be a bit nervous (maybe filling in for someone who was sick?).  Ambience was rather dull, to be honest; mid to upscale hotel restaurant decor, with lots of tourist clientele.Cocktails were insanely pricey... if you're like us and can't appreciate how ""exotic"" liquors such as ""zubrowka buffalo grass vodka"" and ""leblon cachaca"" make for a drink that costs $16, then don't even go there. You'll enjoy your drink while you're sipping it, but will cry when you get the bill.Perhaps my expectations were too high given all the wonderful reviews (including a stellar NY Times review), but unfortunately I was disappointed with the overall value.

5.0,4/25/2011,"Since my last review of Ai Fiori, I've returned several times, and each successive trip yielded stunning results. Not so sure? Have you seen my waistline? I can barely squeeze into this barrel I'm wearing to work today!Each time, I've ordered the trofie nero, and it's been mentioned repeatedly by restaurant critics, chefs and industry insiders because it is just THAT GOOD. Not to be outdone, the gnochetti with sea urchin, crab & mollica shines; it was so delicious that it convinced one dining partner, a staunch hater of uni, to eat half of the serving. A recent dinner visit impressed my dining partner, who had never been there - we marveled at the uovo and how light the foam was, how sweet the lobster knuckles were, how crisp the sweetbreads were. If you have this to start, you may want to skip the astice main, for it's a more concentrated version of the starter. The lamb chops were so fantastic and flavorful that I actually picked one up by the bone to gnaw at it, not caring if the skeletal elderly woman beside me, bedecked in haute couture and pearls, sniffed disdainfully. You know you'd do it too.Service is always, always superb. Last week's lunch saw the introduction of my neverending wine glass, which resulted in me wobbling back to work tipsily. Staff is gracious, and knowledgeable. Also, both Chef White & Chef Jaeckle came out to say hello.If Ai Fiori were a human, we would already be wed, no doubt about it. Unfortunately, in this day and age, we are unable to marry outside of our species (unless you're some weird German dude who marries his cat), and it'll be centuries before humans are legally allowed to marry restaurants.

4.0,4/21/2011,A la Scott goes price fixe for lunch at Michael White's Ai Fiori. And i must say it is well worth the $35.   Any appetizer and any main course on the menu is yours for this really great price in a setting that is hip-stylish-sheik and well spaced.  Comfortable too.  Device is every bit attentive and courteous.  Started with a sardine appetizer that was quite tasty and well presented.  Main course was a skate fish which was lightly browner--garnished and also well presented.  Flavors were all excellent and portions decent for lunch. Round out lunch with gelato.  Yum.  The chocolate was indulgent rich and delightful.  Four stars for lunch says a la Scott.  Cant wait to try it for dinner or maybe Easter sunday brunch where the $85 price fixe looks quite enticing indeed.,0,0,0,Scott S.,"Chicago, IL",39,67,0

4.0,4/8/2011,"I can't complain because it's Michael White, but if I had to choose I would pick Marea over Ai Fiori any day. However, I think I have a crazy obsession with Marea and their spaghetti with uni. I tell everyone I know to go there just to try it.At Ai Fiore, I tried the squid ink pasta. It was good, but it left me yearning for more... by more I mean Marea's spaghetti! We also had the fois gras spread on toasted bread, which was surprisingly good. I also ordered the crab with avocado and a grapefruit foam. I loved the tartness of the foam. It really complimented the crab and avocado perfectly. We also had the ravioli, which was decent but nothing too special.Although this place is definitely good, I would pick Marea over it any day. I feel like Marea is like the O show and Ai Fiori is like La Reve. Once you go to O show, every other Cirque Du Soleil show doesn't compare!On a side note: the bartender makes some great drinks!

5.0,3/31/2011,"I came here with my girlfriend a few weeks ago, full of high hopes and armed with some recommendations from Yelp's biggest Michael White fan. Due to insane traffic on the cab ride over we ended up about 20 minutes late for our reservation. I called on the way and they said no problem. When we finally got there, the hostess took out coats and, despite our tardiness and an apparent full house, ushered us right to our table. We started off with a cocktail for her and a beer for myself, both excellent. Our server then brought by an amuse of parsnip soup which was terrific! The chef packed so much flavor into that little shot glass. It was a great start to the meal. We both ordered the four course prix fixe menu; we started with the Vellutata and Mare E Monte. Both were fantastic, especially the Vellutata! Our second course was Trofie Nero (with squid) and Agnolotti. Both amazing! The Trofie was easily our favorite dish of the night, we were both completely blown away by how well rounded it was. For our entrees I had asked our server if she could help me decide between the Vitello and the Agnello. The Vitello came highly recommended but it would have required a supplemental charge. As soon as I asked I silently scolded myself, thinking the server would recommend the more expensive entree. Wrong, she told me that they were both very good but she preferred the Agnello. It doesn't take much suggestion for me to order lamb so Agnello it was! I ended up extremely happy with the recommendation! First of all the portion was surprisingly large for this type of restaurant, definitely not a bad thing because it was great! My girlfriend had the Astice, which a writer for The Post recently described as ""the greatest dish in the world"". I'm not knocking it at all, it was good but it wasn't my personal greatest dish in the world. For dessert we had the Tartaletta, which also came highly recommended by our server, and we both enjoyed it very much. I can't recall the other dessert but I would remember if I was displeased, I most certainly was not. The service throughout was excellent; attentive and polite, without excess formality.That dinner firmly seated Ai Fiori as my current favorite NYC restaurant.I returned last week for lunch with a good friend of mine.  I started with the Trofie Nero and we both had White Label burgers.  The Trofie Nero, sadly, is now served with scallops instead of squid.  I don't know what prompted the change but I feel that scallops are too bland to stand up to the rest of the flavors in the dish.  The squid added to the dish, while the scallops are just there.  It's still very good, if I hadn't had it another way I wouldn't have been displeased.Both of our burgers were excellent, although quite greasy.Still my favorite restaurant in the city.  I can't wait to go back for the six-course tasting menu!",4,2,3,Sean M.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",429,314,97

5.0,3/16/2011,"Nestled on the second floor of the Setai Hotel, Ai Fiori takes you on an exhilarating tour through the culinary flavors of Italy. If you're looking for a dining experience in New York with inventive dishes, an extensive drink selection, and exceptional service, Ai Fiore should be on the top of your list. From the moment we walked into Ai Fiore, we sensed a restaurant with impeccable service and an appreciation for their customers. We arrived on a bustling Saturday evening around 8:30, without a reservation and were graciously escorted to their hip and modern bar, just outside the restaurant entrance. Although the specialty cocktail list was limited, the bartenders were quite knowledgeable and suggested the Royal Blush, a refreshing, well-crafted cocktail. Midway through our drinks the maitre d' approached and escorted us to our table, a quaint and cozy corner of the restaurant. Upon our seating, we were immediately greeted by the waiter and welcomed to the restaurant. I will admit the wine list is quite expensive and perhaps a bit overwhelming, but the sommelier kindly walked us through the menu and helped us select a full-bodied red that would compliment a variety of entrees on the menu. From starting out with the fresh rosemary roll to the finishing up with the caramel apple sorbet and everything in between, the food exceeded all my expectations. The main courses definitely stole the spotlight: the braised beef cheek and rack of lamb were both so tender and flavorful. We started with the grapefruit/crab/avocado appetizer, which was tangy and beautifully displayed. In between the appetizer and entrée they brought out a little soup that was wonderful and between dinner and dessert a couple of homemade chocolates. I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. The service was so superb and attentive without being overbearing or interrupting the evening.

Blue crab with avocado and grapefruit foam. This was recommended to me as a signature dish. It was FANTASTIC. The crab meat was so fresh and juicy. There was a good amount of fresh avocado but not overwhelming. The grapefruit foam was a nice unique touch. This dish was fresh, felt refreshing. It was small but quality over quantity.Second course. Thanks to Yelp reviews that highly recommended the squid ink pasta, that is what I got. Wow, what a great choice. This was unlike any pasta I have had. Really flavorful, great seafood, great presentation. Portion size was solid too.Dessert. They brought a dessert tray to show me the desserts. They all looked incredible and creative. I wish I had a bigger appetite since I didn't have the room to properly enjoy a dessert. But I was impressed with the selection for sure.Service. Very attentive, not pushy at all, and overall, as good as you could ask for. Setting. Beautiful new hotel, 2nd floor. Really nice space. Not as stuffy as I thought it might be.

The DP and I felt a bit under dressed when we entered the dining room, but we rolled with it. We had the Squid ink pasta, sardines, skate wing, cod, dark chocolate Crémeux, and rosemary apple.I believe the squid ink pasta is a mainstay at Ai Fiori and I can see why. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce, whatever it was, was so frickin' good. On retrospect, we should have took some of the bread and sopped up all of it. By the way, they had a green olive bread that was simply delicious with the butter they had.The sardines was a nice and light app. It's a good thing we had an earlyish reservation as the table that was seated next to us was told that they had ran out of the sardines. The skate wing and cod were basically night and day. The skate wing was rich and earthy. The cod was light and flighty. Both fishes were cooked perfectly and the accompaniments that came with each dish matched the flavors of the fish very well. The dark chocolate crémeux was just decadence in chocolate form. I'm a fan of dark chocolate, so this was right up my alley. On top was a little bit of gold leaf which was a very nice touch. I will definitely return here because their White Label burger caught my eye. It's made from Pat LaFrieda beef and I have yet to try their beef.

We ordered the Uovo (poached egg, lobster, sweetbreads in foam), Mare e Monte (scallops, black truffle and bone marrow), Agnolotti (braised veal and butternut squash ravioli like pasta), gnochetti (uni and crab gnocchi), butter poached lobster and braised beef cheeks.  While we enjoyed all the dishes but the standouts were the Uovo and Agnolotti. For dessert, we had the Baba al Rhum and Coulant di Cioccolata.  There's been a lot of press on the Baba al Rhum but I really liked the Coulant di Cioccolata -- warm chocolate sformato (which is like a souffle but not as airy) with stracciatella gelato.  Overall a fine dining experience.",1,0,0,Howard L.,"New York, NY",19,96,1006

The bar area has a longish bar directly in front of the entrance and a few tables and sitting areas.  The bar is attractive and exudes a calming feel.  We waited in the bar for the rest of our group to show up.  The dining room is large and open and windows abound.  Tables are spaced far enough apart that you aren't required to be (an unwilling) participant in other tables' conversations.The food is Italian-inspired, but utilizes what I think are fresh ingredients that are combined in interesting flavorful ways.  There is a tasting menu that allows the diner to select any item on the menu for an appetizer, main course and dessert.  The portions were not large, but, the tasting menu appeared to afford value.   The olive oil ""pound"" cake was an outstanding dessert.  The beef cheeks were very good and offered a lot of flavor. The wine list is extensive. We enjoyed a Chateauneuf du Pape and a Brunello.  Service was efficient (though there seemed to be somewhat of a lag between ordering the dessert and the time the dessert arrived).",0,0,0,kb j.,"Northbrook, IL",0,183,0

3.0,3/1/2011,"7:15pm dinner on a Sat:it took awhile for the amuse to arrive and then timing between dishes was very slow but overall service was attentive and friendly. My quail starter was generous and delicous, sardines were nice and my wife spoke highly of the blue crab. The Gnochetti with crab/sea urchin was good but Ive enjoyed this dish more at esca and marea. My wife's TartufoNero(risotto)w/parmigiano,black truffle and veal jus was fantastic, rich but not too heavy and worth extra pf supp $30. We heard great things about the Astice butter poached lobster but we didnt really enjoy it and thought it was undercooked.

The lobster, the beef... that incredible squid ink pasta... and what they do to those oysters... who says gilding the lily has to be a bad thing?The desserts are mind-blowing (get the olive oil cake and the baba al rhum) and the cocktails are baaaaaangin' (get the royal blush and the cardamaro, or one of the manifold tasty sgropino options).It's super spendy though, and the portions are dainty to reflect the fact that there's black truffle and caviar on everything.

5.0,2/22/2011,"white label burger is the truth. officially took over the #1 slot in my ever-evolving list of favorite nyc burgers. buttery, cheesy, crispy from the bacon but melt in your mouth tender at the same time, this is a first class burger. i really liked the pomme dauphine it was served with too. they look like tiny donut holes but taste like perfectly salty mashed potato fritters. i can kill a side of fries like no other, but these were a novel and welcome change.we ordered from the 3-course restaurant week menu as well: squid ink pasta with seafood and breadcrumbs to start, golden skate wing with a side of spinach that even somehow tasted decadent, and a dense chocolate/caramel cake flecked with gold leaf. each course felt considered and special, unlike some RW menus which seem to throw you a standard-issue roasted chicken or salmon fillet and call it a day. this sampling did what i think the restaurant week experience really should do: make you excited to return on a regular day.drinks we ordered were outstanding too. i often find cocktails too sweet, but my ""royal blush"" w/ vodka, mint, lime, cherry and sparkling wine was pitch perfect. we also tried the ""blood and sand"" (a scotch cocktail) and a syrah, both which were well balanced and went well with the eats. the setting is open and airy, and the setai hotel itself is beautiful. service was gracious but never cloying.

5.0,2/20/2011,"I was going to dock Ai Fiori a star because they ran out of their lobster entree (and failed to inform us when we got the menu and 4 of the 6 of us decided we were having the lobster) but everything else was so spectacularly perfect that I can't even charge them a star for that misstep.  Every dish was just unreal, the scallop+bone marrow, the lobster appetizer with black truffle, both risottos, the sea urchin pasta were the standouts.  The 6 of us went the 4-course route and every single thing was just perfect and the service was impeccable.I didn't think it would (or could) live up to Marea but it really did.  A little stuffier atmosphere but a beautiful space and the food met all our expectations.",1,0,1,Karol S.,"New York, NY",157,606,19
3.0,2/19/2011,"I went to Ai Fiori last week (2/13) and forgot to post about it! It was the day before Valentine's Day so the place was packed with love birds. Apparently we had caught the end of restaurant week so that menu was available. For the Antipasta, I got the Consomme, which was a soup like fixture. It was well presented and definitely delicious. I liked the guinea a hen quenelle very much, though it took me awhile to figure out what it was. For the main course, I opted for Razza (or the skate wing). Again the presentation was flawless, but it was too salty. And finally for the dessert, I got the Rosemary Apple. I love all apple desserts, but for this particular one I couldn't eat the apple. It was cooked with frangipane and the taste was too strong for me. The tart itself, however, was delicious made and eaten with ice cream is of course heavenly.The atmosphere was beautiful as the restaurant was ornately decorated and it definitely portrayed a romantic setting. Service was great as expected. The reason that this place got a 3 star from me is really because of the food. I think food is an important part of how the restaurant can and cannot become. I wish they had put more efforts into their food quality and taste rather than thinking about how to impress the customer with its presentation. Again, perhaps, it happens this way because it's restaurant week menu so the chefs weren't as attentive in their work.",0,1,0,Sophia S.,"Alexandria, VA",135,130,102

4.0,2/14/2011,"RW 2011 Lunch ReviewBeautiful space in the Setai hotel.  Definitely a very chic and modern restaurant.  We got a great seat by the window which overlooks 5th Ave.  Service: good, but not great for this type of fine establishment. Our waitress seemed a little distant. Maybe it's b/c we ordered off the RW menu and didn't order any drinks.  In general, no real complaints though.Food: Bread options: multigrain, olive or french.  You can try all three if you'd like.  They were good, but didn't think they were anything too special.We all had the black squid ink pasta w/some crustaceans. Boy was this delicious. My favorite part of the meal.Entrees: we tried the skate wing and the short ribs.  The guys seemed to enjoy their short ribs.  Looked really tender. I liked my skate wing although it was just a tad bit salty.Dessert: This was my least favorite part of the meal.  I'm such a dessert person.  The rosemary apple was tart was ok. The crust which was made with frangipane (almond paste) was good, but the apples were not so great. Not sure how they were cooked, but they were too sticky and had a weird sweetness to it.  The vanilla gelato was also ok.  The chocolate dessert was good, but only if you're a chocolate lover. Even then, I'd be surprised if someone could finish the entire thing. It's a bit rich.Overall, this was a great experience and I am likely going to dine here again.PS They have a nice bar/lounge area and nice bathrooms too.",1,0,2,Michelle H.,"New York, NY",191,497,6

3.0,2/4/2011,"We live nearby, stopped by for dinner on a Friday night.  Everyone was very nice, our meals were truly excellent, but the service was very, very slow.Specifically, we waited forever between dishes and it took so long we gave up even trying for dessert.  The couple next to us had the exact same experience - we saw them order, and wait a very long time.It became almost unbearably long between courses, and despite the great food it unfortunately wasn't worth it. Even the check took them forever to get back to us.NYC is a very competitive market,  and one expects both great food as well as prompt, attentive service at a truly top tier restaurant.  Ai FIori has some serious work to do to improve in this respect.",1,0,0,S W.,"Millington, NJ",0,7,0

My first course was the Trofie Nero - squid ink pasta.  As addictive as some of my favorite Marea dishes!  It was so tasty I wished I could've had a second serving. For my entree, I chose the sauteed skate wing, which was pleasantly light and crispy.  Dessert was a raspberry apple tart served with vanilla gelato.   Mmmmm!  The boyfriend ordered the White Label Burger a la carte and loved it.",0,0,0,Karen B.,"San Francisco, CA",150,102,13
5.0,2/1/2011,"I came to Ai Fiori for restaurant week with a good friend from Yelp and was blown away by the food, wine, service, ambiance, and classiness of this young establishment. For $25, three carefully chosen courses were delivered to me with such finesse and individual care, I was almost surprised by the attention of the different servers in charge of each type of cuisine. The sommelier was very polite, and didn't make me feel rushed with my wine. My waiter was all smiles and was always there when he was supposed to be. The food was incredible. The squid ink  was infused into the pasta and came with a creamy based sauce, not too overpowering or drowning. I could smell the squid in the pasta when they first brought it over. Delicious! My skate wings came over deboned, slightly crispy, and with this incredible sauce to go with it. Desert was fantastic, we shared both types a choco-caramel with gold flakes on top and some kind of tort creation. French Reisling was also perfect. Price after splitting tab came out to $65 with tip, but it was worth every penny.",4,2,5,Richard B.,"Bronx, NY",979,1008,621

5.0,1/31/2011,"We had a 5 star dinner here.  The food is incredible, and the service was very attentive.  I highly recommend it. We started off at the bar, which had a short list of very interesting cocktails.  I had the Royal Blush, which was a refreshing combination of Absolut Vodka, mint, lime, cherry and sparkling wine.  My bf had the Camparinete, which is one of their more popular drinks.  Gin, sweet vermouth, campari and carpana antica formula. At dinner, we decided to go for the four course $79 prix fixe menu.  Our first amuse bouche was cream of sunchoke soup with chamomile and apple.  A delicious start to the evening.  We had a choice of several breads, but loved the olive bread best, which has thyme (or some such herb) and was very tasty.  For appetizers we had:- the Mare e Monte.  Thinly sliced diver scallops, black truffle, bone marrow, thyme and celery root, presented in a bone.   -the Granchio - blue crab with avocado and grapefruit foam.  Very refreshing.   Basically these were PERFECT.  For pasta, we had - the Gnochetti with saffron, sea urchin, and blue crab, with spicy peppers and delicate breadcrumbs.  Another PERFECT dish.  - Trofie Nero - Squid ink pasta in a light garlic-based sauce with small bites of seafood including  scallops white fish, crunchy octopus bits, and spicy breadcrumbs.  An EXCELLENT dish.  For our entrees, we both had the Astice - seriously, a perfectly cooked lobster, butter poached from nova Scotia, with root vegetables, and chateau chalon sauce (apparently one of the greatest wines in the world and rare).  So far, absolutely everything we'd eaten was divine, perfect, and memorable.  We were less excited about the rest of the meal, but realized it was partly because the bar had been set so high up until then. The next amuse bouche was a honey gelee (like custard) with green apple sorbet.  Honestly it just didn't really go that well.  We got the idea, but I personally think if there had been less of the honey gelee, just enough to offset the tanginess of the sorbet, it would have been much better. For desserts we got:- the Coulant di Ciocolatto-  molten chocolate cake, stracciatella gelato. Good.  - Tartaletta - a thick dark chocolate mousse with sea salt in a tart surrounded by a ring of hazelnuts, a liquid grapefruit jelly, foam, candied orange jelly, and hazelnut gelato (couldn't really taste the hazenut).  My bf liked this because it was distinctive.  I thought it was creative but only okay.  I thought the sea salt overwhelmed the taste. Overall, we were extremely pleased with the experience, absolutely loved the food, and came away full and very happy.  The restaurant's relatively new, and the space is large, so it seemed a bit empty (unusual for a Saturday night) until 8:30-9 when it started filling up and by the time we left it was definitely close to full.  But given how amazing our meal was, it won't be long before reservations get harder to score.",1,0,0,Vivian W.,"San Francisco, CA",14,541,0
5.0,1/30/2011,"Perfection.  This is what comes to mind when I think about the dining experience at Ai Fiori.  Ai Fiori is simply spectacular at so many levels and I would highly recommend it if you're looking to celebrate that special occasion.  I applaud Michael White (the owner and head chef) for not withholding their menu during restaurant week.  Ai Fiori is the epitome of what fine dining in NYC should be.  Sorry to inform you Mr. Ripert (owner of Le Bernadin), but there is a new, cooler kid on the block.Setting the praises aside, let's have a look at their winter 2011 RW lunch menu.  For appetizers, we had the squid ink pasta and sardines.  The squid ink pasta was incredibly favorable and had very tender pieces of cuttlefish.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that is the best pasta dish I've ever had.  It is as good, if not better, than the fusilli with bone marrow dish at Michael White's other restaurant, Marea.  Although the sardines with tomato confit was good, it pales in comparison to the pasta dish.For entrees, we had the pan roasted cod and braised short ribs.  The cod was served in a clam broth with very succulent pieces of clams.  Truly one of the best fish dishes I've had in NYC by far.  It was perfectly cooked and reminded me of the impeccably-done chilean sea bass dish at Aquagrill.  The short ribs, which was served with mashed potatoes and spinach, was also very favorable and tender.For desserts, we had the apple tart and chocolate mousse.  Both came with a scoop of vanilla gelato that was delicious.  The apple tart tasted very fresh and sweet.  The chocolate mousse had salted caramel inside and was superb.  However, it was a little too rich for my taste (not necessarily a bad thing).Not only was the menu impeccable, the service was first-class.  Unless you look like old money, most NYC restaurants of this caliber will have the condescending, eye-rolling waiter eagerly ready to ignore your presence.  Far from that, the waiters and staff at Ai Fiori were not pretentious at all and were incredibly friendly, without being too obtrusive.  The level of service you receive at Ai Fiori is the same 5-star service you will receive when staying at the adjoining Setai hotel.Overall, I was really blown away by this restaurant.  In fact, their lunch menu is better than the dinner menu that I've had at some other Michelin starred restaurants (e.g., Adour Alain Ducasse).   I really hope that the food press will give this restaurant more recognition; it more than deserves a Michelin star (which it currently does not have, to my surprise).  This is one of the few restaurants during restaurant week that I would be more than willing to come back here and pay the regular price.  Bravo, Ai Fiori.

4.0,1/28/2011,"When I posted about Ai Fiori : 2011 NYC Restaurant Week Recommendation Choice in Korean, someone left a comment. He made a reservation after reading my post, but now he faced another huddle. What to order? He introduced himself as someone who distinguishes foods only as ""delicious"" and ""not delicious"" . That actually shouldn't be a problem, I think. But it could be, when he is going to bring a girl he likes to that lunch. Date lunch, somehow, demands more pretentious make-up persona, doesn't it? How cute is that? That uncertain fate of early dating! I adored butterflies in his stomach. Fly butterflies, fly! So when we got to Ai Fiori, I was feeling him. That was a CG effect to our lunch. Everything related to that lunch became pinky and air brushed because of his nervous love. (I know I'm too cruel) When this extra CG effect meets with world class actors, supporting actors, great OST, director, producers, and writers...you know this lunch would be up for Oscar nominations. And it was, indeed. Ai Fiori sits on the second floor of Setai Hotel in midtown. Hotel seems too cold for a restaurant, but interior has warm feelings even though tables are lined up like a factory. The other side has massive glasses, so if you sit there on a sunny day, the space will glow. Same thing will happen at dinner time reflecting lights from street  and cars on the 5th ave. I do wonder the sound level from cars, though. Service at front desk was superb. Friendly, but more importantly patient and genuine. Waiters were nice too. Bread boy offers you three kinds; plain baguettes, multi grain, olive bread. All delicious with soft, sweet butter. First appetizer of the day was Mushroom Consomme. Heads of mini mushrooms, perfect squares of root veggies, and guinea hen quenelle ball were floating in mushroom consomme. Overall taste was truthful to mushroom. Texture of the ball was like aged fried tofu, but it was too small to taste fully. Nothing special. This supporting actor wouldn't be even nominated for the Oscar. Next was Trofie Nero. Squid ink pasta with cuttlefish like seppia, scallops. It was joyful. So pleasantly springy texture of homemade pasta itself was satisfying. But sweet bites of cuttlefish enhanced the whole experience. Crunch spiced mollica (crumbs) was perfectly salty. This one is very possible to win the Oscar for best supporting actress.  Entree 1 was Merluzzo. Pan roasted cod. Holly cod! It was a thick steak with perfectly seared outside. Then inside was even better. Not over-cooked, springy, sweet, milky flesh of cod was melting. No resistance what so ever. Our server poured little neck clam broth in to the plate. Broth has clam bites, but a little too salty to our taste. Spinach pesto (used to be watercress pesto) and potato pearls and chives were delightful. Whoever carved pearls out of hard potato, I am sending my condolence to you...Razza was entree 2. Sauteed skate wing was perfect. It was better than cod to me. Crispy with just right amount of oil, skate wing proved its importance. Brown butter with lemon, and big pieces of capers helped skate wing reached its higher existence. But again, it was a little too salty. (Spinach saved me from saltiness). However, very possible contender for best actress...By now, I was reaching my happiness level of the day. It takes only a great & satisfying lunch, you can tell. Hate to say good bye to Ai Fiori, but dessert was coming. First one Rosemary Apple with vanilla gelato. Wow. How sweet a dessert can be? This one proved that there's no limit. Even though we liked the buttery crust, rosemary apple was hurting-ly sweet. Sorry, not even a nomination for you. I hope my ""taking a girl he likes"" reader didn't order this. Or more importantly, I hope the girl didn't order this. Dark chocolate cremeux was a saver. Its bitter creamy chocolate mousse with salted caramel was well matched with crust. Such a balance. A dome of stracciatella (fine chocolate chip ice cream) was smooth. That gold flake was strangely salty according to my brother. I do not believe him. :PYou will need a cup of coffee to balance out those desserts. So we did. Nice cup of cappuccino helped. Overall, it was such a pleasant dining experience. Nice foods, great service, comfortable seating, and that early lover's CG effect. Now, I was getting nervous about my ""taking a girl he likes"" reader. Did he order right things? Did he lead the lunch? Did he impress the girl? Did she like the foods? Did she fall in love with him? I hope he does let me know how the date went. If not, well, I will assume everything went well.",1,0,0,Jinhwa J.,"Manhattan, NY",14,28,121

The waitstaff was very knowledgeable and helpful. The room is similar to SHO in the typical Setai motif, warm, sleek and contemporary. The food was simply great. The Nantucket scallop appetizer was very good but the Torchon appetizer was fantastic. It's a perfect mix of flavors that I would highly recommend. The pastas were very, very good as well but similar to what you would see at similar top tier Italians. The best was yet to come with the seafood though. I had the black sea bass and the First Lady had the sole. Both were awesome. The sole was perfectly cooked and was a surprisingly large portion. The black sea bass was an incredible blend of flavors that I thought was truly unique. The flavors were very subtle at first but seem to blend together into a bouquet of deliciousness.

Also, the portions are very well presented, but REALLY small. Espresso was decent.The menu however really is geared to fishovores, despite the name of the establishment (""at the flowers"" in Italian), with very little choice for carnivores and pasta lovers such as myself.Ambience was very nice despite the place being half empty (ever heard that of a new upscale restaurant in Manhattan?).Service was attentive, but definitely ""trying too hard"", which I think is excusable considering how new this place is.Overall, not terrible, but would not come back and would definitely not recommend.

5.0,12/11/2010,"What can I say about this place but ""stellar"" and amazing service.From the Captain to the bread person, it was just a really wonderful and relaxing experience.Almost an hour late for our reservation was not a problem on this uncrowded Sunday evening.The wine list is extensive, but I always get overwhelmed with that, and usually go on the sommelier's recommendation.The Cabernet that I had was really very delicate, and delicious.  That's all I can say.Starting with a complimentary warm cauliflower soup, in a small drinkable glass was really a pleasant surprise.Followed up with appetizer of Oysters, topped with a dollop of caviar and in a rich buttery sauce, it was probably the best appetizer I've ever had.Wife had a really nice cold blue crab platter topped with avocado.  I tried that, after quickly slurping down my oysters, and it was equally as amazing.The middle dish was Gnocciti, or something like tightly wrapped and slightly firm Gnocci.  This also had diced meat with it.  It was good, and I would've been a fine meal by itself anywhere else, but tonight, it was the weak link in the chain, without really removing anything from the overall experience.For the main course, I had the Roasted hen, which was so moist and delicious, and amply seasoned,  that I really didn't have any room to sample any of the desserts.The room space is really wide open, and it feels like your sitting directly on Top of 5th Avenue, with the large American flags flying just over your shoulder.  For a special occasion or a power business lunch, this is a wonderful and memorable choice.For this review, the photos pretty much speak for themselves and convey the ambiance and food style.",6,1,4,Jim P.,"Brooklyn, NY",685,857,877
