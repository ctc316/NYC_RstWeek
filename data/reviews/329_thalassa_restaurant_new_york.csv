5.0,4/30/2019,"We visited Thalassa recently and were blown away by the experience!   We were treated like royalty from the start!  The food was delicious and prepared with creativity.  Kebabs of cheese and vegetables started our meal along with raw oysters.  The sauces that accompanied these appetizers were a perfect complement and did not overpower.  The fish tacos that followed were the best I've ever had, with the taco being light and fluffy.  Two varieties of Sliders,salmon and chicken, melted in your mouth.  Decadent Greek yogurt with pistachios, berries and syrup completed the feast. Before we left, we made a reservation to return for a wonderful fish meal!  Hurry over and you won't be disappointed.",0,0,0,Terry G.,"Manhattan, BOWLING GREEN, NY",0,4,0
5.0,2/28/2019,"This must be my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in manhattan.They bake their own bread, which is too good to start with.

5.0,2/17/2019,Easily one of the top restaurants in NYC. Walking inside was beautiful and breath taking to say the least. Staff was phenomenal in sitting us and layout was large and romantic. The service was wonderful. We were very well taken care of. Food was also very good and portions were large and worth every penny. The wine options were fantastic. My only suggestion would be to add a couple more options for food outside of the seafood Category. The staff and overall restaurant really impressed me.,0,0,0,Julian L.,"Manchester, CT",2,7,7
5.0,2/16/2019,"This place is beyond AMAZING! The host and wait staff are so kind and go out of their way to make your dining experience beyond memorable. I recently came here for my anniversary- and the food was TO DIE FOR. Gabriel and Steven made our first time here an experience we will never forget with their ability to go above and beyond for their guests. I can't express the level of their kindness, they really go above and beyond. We even had the opportunity to meet the head chef- who made us feel so welcome with his hospitality. For appetizer, we had scallops and grilled octopus.(we didn't get a picture of the octopus, we just dove right in) Entrees were the lobster special and the Lavraki. I'm drooling as I write this. The desert was a medley of the chocolate molten cake, baklava, and a custard that melts in your mouth. Overall, the experience was out of this world. My new favorite place to get seafood. Thank you so much Thalassa, I can't wait to go back!!",0,0,0,Alexis N.,"Bronx, NY",25,4,4
4.0,2/12/2019,"My job has hosted their holiday party two times at Thalassa so far and they've never disappointed. When we entered we were greeted by the manager and staff and escorted to the coat check on the top floor. I must say I appreciate art and they truly have a great deal of landscape captures but I was told that's the norm for restaurants on that side of town. We entered the top level and the table setting and ambiance was beautiful. Low lights with stream lights on different sections of the top level. I mentioned their landscaping art on the first level, well on the top level there's so much more to see and they're all beautiful. The bar was where they catered appetizers and drinks. At every turn there was food and the bartender actually remembered our drinks after the 2nd visit. The appetizers were very good! Lamb, scallops, and other great combos. I was so full from the appetizer by the time I got to the dinner plate I was a stuffed potato. Everything was great! Food, service, and drinks.

5.0,12/5/2018,"Wow this place is really exceptional. The space is really nice, large, and the decor is really lovely. I felt like I was transported to Greece. The service is really top notch. They crossed off every checkbox. Before ordering, we were shown the fish special of the day and fully explained how it was prepared. The fish here is very fresh.When we ordered drinks we asked for no sugar in the drink we ordered, when we ordered an item off the menu later the server actually remembered that we didn't want sugar and alerted us that there was sugar added in that item. Right there, that attention to detail, immediately made this a 5 star place for us. We were really impressed and grateful that he remembered. We also had asked for gluten free options, which they really took their time to help us choose the best menu items. The service is just impeccable. The food was absolutely delicious. The bread comes with olive oil, olives, and feta cheese. We ordered organic black quinoa, the tilefish, Lavraki (fish special of the day), and the lobster mashed potatoes. The fish was cooked perfectly. The lobster in the mashed potatoes was not skimpy at all, like a lot of other places. Everything was very tasty, I'll definitely come back here.

5.0,10/14/2018,"A nice classy but not pretentious Manhattan restaurant with a nice non Manhattan price tag for the fixed price dinner of around $40 per person for a generous 3 course meal. The octopus ceviche was tender and tasty. The stuffed fish was generously stuffed though slightly on the dry side. The yoghurt martini with toasted walnuts was a delightful end to the meal, although if like me, you're used to non fat dairy, it can be heavy. But I'm not complaining. A good place to bring dates, friends, family... anyone really. The tables are well spaced so you don't have to listen to what your neighbours are saying, unless they are excessively loud.

5.0,6/7/2018,"I went to Thalassa last week and had another incredible meal. This was my 3rd time I have dined here. I'm not much of a reviewer but this time I decided to write one. For starters- the space is super pretty. It doesn't feel like the every day norm in NYC restaurants. Elegant but not stuffy. The service is fantastic. Greeted and seated right away. The staff was attentive but not annoying throughout the experience. The food- phenomenal. Not only was it delicious and the plating so pretty, it had to be the freshest fish I've had in some time. Other than preparing and executing a recipe which they do top notch here, the fish quality also is key and all three of those together put on quite the culinary experience. We had the scallop app, octopus app, and stuffed calamari. All were excellent but the scallops were my favorite. I could have eaten 6 orders of them. After that I had the soft shell crabs over sea urchin risotto. It was delicious. The most shocking part about it that was there was actual whole pieces of sea urchin served with the risotto. I was expecting the broth only to be made of sea urchin, not to actually have it to eat too. On our way out, we was fortunate to meet the chef himself -Ralpheal.

Even with great food and drinks, the top of my list was their service. Even though they were understaffed, the waiter was never hurried. He had sort of an elegance to himself. They forgot to add our drinks at the bar to the bill, and when we pointed that out, they were ready to comp us. Really, comp us for $40!

The food and atmosphere were great and the staff rated a 5 out of 5. We had the Dolmas and Arugula for starters -- both excellent. For our main course, we had the red snapper and turbot. The snapper was fantastic. The turbot was cooked nicely, with a flaky center, and nicely crisped outside. However, fish itself is a type with a bit too much of an ocean-y taste, if that makes sense. If I could pick a different fish to be cooked the same way, it would be perfect.Dessert was Galaktoboureko, which was nicely light-tasting for something containing dough and cream. There is so much -- split this one!Complimentary mini stew, dessert wine, mini zucchini cakes and chocolate, and cookies were given.

3.0,12/11/2017,"Overall food and ambiance were great.  However, service was borderline disrespectful.  We had a group of 12 for a work event and the waiter seemed overly annoyed with us and very short with his responses.  For the amount of food and drinks we ordered, we expected some courtesy.  One order was incorrect and no recognition of the error, much less an apology.  We did observe the same waiter (his name is Madison) provide much more attention to two ladies at a table next to ours.  Either way, if I go back it will be for the scallops and grilled octopus which were amazing.",0,0,0,Bhavesh M.,"Morris Plains, NJ",0,2,0

We went there on a Friday night for my wife's birthday. Steve greeted as at the door. Then we were taken to a very airy restaurant interior (almost felt like we were outside). There was light music playing. We got the cucumber martini which tasted phenomenal and had the perfect amount of alcohol. Chef complimented us with crab cakes that were fried but not oily at all. The waiter brought us focaccia bread and olives and olive oil with capers which tasted out of this world. Better than the olives and olive oil we had in Greece. We then ordered the stuffed clams, Greek meat balls, dolmas, crabmeat salad for appetizers. The food came right away. The portions were appropriate, prices were VERY reasonable, and the presentation was very appetizing. Our waiter checked on us every few minutes. Our favorite appetizer was the crabmeat salad (it was very simple and fresh) followed by the Greek meatballs. The stuffed calamari stuffing (feta cheese and tomatoes) tasted good but the clam itself was chewy and not very flavorful. Our main entree was the seafood thalassina. Generous portions of shrimp, scallops, mussels and prawns all fresh and very tasty. For dessert the chef complimented us with 4 pieces of dark chocolate and port dessert wine. We then ordered the mastica Panna Cotta which was out of this world!!! Overall an amazing experience with authentic fresh delicious food. Service was super.

5.0,8/31/2017,"Here's a story about good marketing- I got a targeted email from Travelzoo with a $100 for $50 coupon for this place. I love Greek food, so this seemed like a no brainier.It was a good choice. Went with a colleague last night-everything was delicious.  Street parking right in front starting at 7 pm.  Greeted and seated right away, restaurant was adulty but not stuffy. Service was pretty uniformly great. Started with bread/olive oil/eggplant and an amuse bouche. Bread was very good,  a poppy seed one and a whole grain non yeast one, if I remember correctly.  The appetizer menu was odd-some things were pricy, other things were not. Entrees were in the $30-40 range and were worth the price for the quality. Asked for a wine recommendation and was not disappointed. I'm happily upsold on interesting wines and spent $60 something on a white blend, which was very good.. Started with the octopus, which is my not-so-secret reason to go to Greek places (right up there with pate for me as a must order). It was lightly grilled and delicious with a bit of frisee. I always feel bad because like pigs, they're smart, but I'm hungry....We both has the SEAFOOD THALASSINA which consisted of diver scallops, gulf shrimp, langustines, PEI mussels all steamed in white wine and a lot of butter over a bed of orzo. It was delicious, rich enough that my colleague didn't finish his. I, of course, did. There was no room for desert, just a cappuccino, creamy and sweet. When we left, they gave us cookies and a water for the ride home-a nice touch because I had three more stops that night.My point is that the restaurant wasn't all that crowded-that's a shame, because we had a great meal in a nice place.  You should go there, really.  Targeted marketing got me to buy and try a place that I hadn't been to before, and now I plan on coming back because they extended the restaurant week menu there.",0,0,0,Scot P.,"Yonkers, NY",3,27,0

The scallops were amazing as well, although I don't think I liked the balsamic glaze on them. Greek salad is of course great as well. I'm not a huge fan of grape leaves, but it would have been nice if they had some meat in them. The entrees themselves were ok. Lamb chops were cooked to perfection. The fish I wasn't crazy about.

From the host Steven who welcomed us and wished us a good night, even took pictures of us without us having to ask him, it makes you feel welcomed. To our Waiter Madison, such a knowledgeable, welcoming, kind and always checking if everything was good, really was a delight. All the service was excellent. The timing of each meal was great, people always making sure you have water and keeping your table clean from finished plates.With the romantic and calm setting this place is defiantly a 5 Stars in my book and would recommend anyone to join for a nice dinner, a surprise birthday as I did, even if you wanted to throw a wedding shower the decorations and scenery are superb!",0,0,0,Adina L.,"Manhattan, NY",73,4,0

I recently hosted a 200 person networking event and it went perfectly. The food was constantly refilling and the bar was a well-oiled machine.

My boyfriend had Greek salad, which had way to much vinegar and tasteless tomatoes, and lamb chops, which was cooked well, but came with over salted steamed green beans and a half of boiled sweet potato. Everything was very average and probably even worse than just average. Deserts were bad too, something that is relative to Greek yogurt and something baked  like phyllo dough stuffed  with some sort of heavy creamy substance.  Overall we liked the restaurant and people who work there, but not the food.

I thought it was very good. We started with the scallops in some sort of dough which were very tasty and unique - I'd recommend them. As a main I got the red snapper with asparagus and thought it was delish. He got the lamb and enjoyed it as well. We were going to skip dessert but then they offered us complimentary petit fours (I think that's what they're called? Like mini desserts) & and dessert wine so we went with it!

Bread was nothing special, but the olive oil, and the tapenades were good, along with what I think was an eggplant dip.Starters: Big scallops in a filo dough were good, octopus was grilled well, though few pieces for the order (we ended up with two orders to get around the table of 6). Zucchini-eggplant chips were a bit too fried for most of us, and Horiatiki was a nice, refreshing salad to start.Mains: Lamb Shank was good, with a strong balance between the savory red tomato sauce and the salty, earthy lamb flavor beneath. The Seafood Thalassina was ok, a mixed bag of orzo with seafood, almost like the Greek version of a paella.The servers were particularly generous with the wine and dessert wine they gave us a complementary sample of some of the sweet and normal wines. Baklava was good, but I'd probably skip the fruit (didn't go well given the baklava was already so sweet).I'll have to come back to try the fish.",5,2,4,Hank C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1732,2830,1188

5.0,2/23/2017,"Thalassa is a high end Greek restaurant located in the hearth of Tribeca where my wife and I decided to have our American wedding. I must give my wife credit for having found it online and insisted that we tried it, as New York City has thousands of options and I was initially oriented with other solutions. Our first visit to the restaurant made it for us. We did not make a reservation and did not mention the wedding on purpose, to see what type of service and overall experience we would have as 'normal' customers.We're greeted by the hostess and welcomed in the main dining room. Smooth ambiance, soft music, candles, and a trio of Mediterranean dips with their signature bread to welcome us: super cool start. Our server is a very nice gentleman that takes care of us all night, illustrating the menu and wines, and answering several questions given our rising interest in the place. Our appetizers and entrees come and there's no more doubt: we are having our wedding at Thalassa. The food here is top notch: the flavors, textures, combinations, and quality of ingredients are simply unbeatable. At moments we felt like being in our homeland (Greece's neighbor Italy). The chef knows how to present each dish wonderfully, often with flowers, but always with elegance.  The hostess is kind and allows us to visit the other two spaces beside the main dining room, namely the Cellar and the Gallery Loft, and later on she sets an appointment with the manager, Tasso, for a week later or so. Tasso is the man. Attentive, kind, and simpatico, but most of all, professional. It takes only two meetings to agree on the reception format. After that, a wonderful tasting dinner with our maid of honor and best man weeks later, during which we define the menu and the wines. Wonderful night!The day of the reception: I stop by the Gallery Loft (the space we booked in the end) early in the morning to drop the last minute things and the space is already set in order, super clean and decorated. After the wedding ceremony and photos, we make our entrance in the Loft, and love to see our guests greeted and served in such a professional way by the butlers. Glasses are always full. I must admit I did not have a chance to enjoy the hors d'oeuvres as much as I wanted to, but ehm, I guess I was too busy being the groom?? The reception goes on with impeccable service, all the way to the cake song, cutting, and serving, and ends after two hours of open bar and dancing, which really concludes the night with the most fun possible.Thanks Thalassa, thanks to the chef and his team, thanks to the butlers, and thanks Tasso for contributing to such a magic wedding reception. We are (and will be) recommending this place to anyone we know, and promise to celebrate every wedding anniversary here as a tradition!!!*****",3,0,0,Angelo T.,"Jersey City, NJ",18,22,1
5.0,2/4/2017,"THE BEST!! Great service, delicious Mediterranean food, beautiful space, and the epitome of professionalism.My new wife and I came across Thalassa last year while searching online for a venue for our wedding reception (extended cocktail style).  We had been very disappointed by several of NYC's top restaurants due to their lack of attention, communication, and detail. When we contacted Thalassa, we were introduced to their general manager, Tasso. He was the game-changer! It quickly became clear that Tasso was extremely detail-oriented, communicative, and dedicated to ensuring our satisfaction. This effort, exhibited before we had even tasted menu items, put Thalassa at the top of our list.I scheduled a tasting with Tasso, on a busy Saturday night no less, and he could not have been more accommodating. He toured me around his beautiful restaurant while my fiancee was FaceTime'ing with us. We immediately fell in love with the wine cellar, which is furnished with masterfully hand-crafted Greek wood tables. Then I began wine tasting. The selection is to die for! Afterwards, I began sampling several items from the Private Events Menu. The freshness, quality, and delectability of each bite was almost overwhelming. That locked us in. In the weeks leading up to the wedding, Tasso was communicating with us regularly and responding to any questions we had. Truly attentive.Needless to say, our wedding reception went off exquisitely. Tasso even made arrangements for our live singers to perform using the on-site PA system. We received countless compliments on the food and service provided my Thalassa's staff. The tastiness of the food reflected its beautiful presentation. The bartenders and butlers were always available to us and our guests. Many of our friends and family also commented on the beautiful decor and ambiance. We did not decorate a thing. That's just how Thalassa rolls.Thalassa, Tasso, and Chef Ralpheal Abrahante were the BEST! I wish I could add more stars to this review.",1,0,0,Joseph S.,"Baltimore, MD",2,13,11
4.0,1/29/2017,"UPDATE: there was an accidental billing mishap. i called and left a message. the owner, Steve, checked voice mails even though they were closed on sunday. he called me back immediately to address my concern and promised to correct the mistake on monday. really amazing customer service from the owner. However, not really excited by my interaction with the GM and the solution/info offered to rectify my situation. Dropping a star for this. Not what I hoped for from a higher end place. Otherwise, still a solid 4 star experience.soooooo tasty! we went here for restaurant week and everything was perfect. the ambiance, though definitely greek, is more like a hip night club and the food has similar flare... for example, we sat across from an aesthetically pleasing display of frozen sea creatures surrounded by the neon lights of a euro dance party... i never thought i would write that sentence... but this place took a common outdoor market experience and made it swank. much like my entrée: baked salmon wrapped in grape leaves, served on top of artichoke hearts... it looked like a trendy nori sushi hand roll burrito thing... but had all the classic comforting greek flavors i hoped for! this place really focuses on cultivating their own playful style twist when it comes to traditional greek elements.i couldn't afford things if i had come for a regular meal. dear restaurant: thank you for offering such a hearty and well-priced meal set for NYC restaurant week 2017. and for my fellow SIBO pals (low fodmap, paleo, gluten free, dairy free crowds), if you want to check out restaurant week yourself, I know you will be given the same consideration and excellent customer care! here's what I recommend... (be flexible with sugar & garlic)table food: no gluten free bread, so ask for cut cucumbers to dip in oil. the olives are great! the hummus is made from fava beans (i think?)appetizer: the grilled octopus was delightful. i was bad and ate the drizzled sauce, but you could easily avoid it if you wanna be strictmeal 1: salmon crudo & zucchini flower shrimp salad are both great options; citrus lovers rejoice! meal 2: baked salmon wrapped in grape leaves... yummmmers! or the lamb but watch out for spinach risotto. i tried a little of my friend's risotto and it was waaaaay too delicious to be appropriate for us food sensitive types ;) but normal eaters, please chow down and enjoy so i may continue to vicariously enjoy the yums through your spinach risotto appreciation posts! meal 3: i didn't even ask for a moderation; our waiter offered fresh berries + mint leaves for my dessert. it was sprinkled with such a perfect sugar drizzle... so i was bad and also gobbled that up real quick! but the sugar was not much. i'm sure you could ask to avoid additional sugar. it was perfectly ripe blackberries and strawberries. drink: white wine is a good option to split with the table. we had dry rosé... which is also not recommended for SIBO foodies (dry white is the only wine friendly option) but the dry pink rosé is a moderately not-so-bad SIBO choice... especially if you stick to 1 glass... which I didn't, annnnd I got so drunk I knocked over my glass (if you are reading restaurant staff: i'm sorry i was a giggly drunk mess towards the end!)so to recap: regular people, come eat this delicious meal. people with gastrointestinal troubles, come eat this meal. all people who want a swanky friday night NYC restaurant week experience, come eat this meal.",5,1,3,Kate O.,"New York, NY",349,130,536

Our server Antonio was kind and checked in often. We used a TravelZoo certificate and the fact that he treated us like we weren't using a certificate made me feel welcomed and I liked the restaurant even more. I like restaurants that give extras that come with the meal and this restaurant gave the most extras I've ever had. They served us olives, bread and olive oil, chilled beat soup, zucchini bread, chocolates, and dessert wine. The service and little touches like that make a huge difference from being a good restaurant to a great restaurant. We ordered the fish tacos, the seafood Thalassina, and the molten chocolate cake.

The decor was beautiful, the music was energetic but still maintaining its position as background music. The food was excellent. We ordered some apps to share and then individual entrees. Fish across the board and nobody was disappointed. I would be remiss if I did not give kudos to the staff, especially Antonio. While we make our way to such places for the food, the tireless folks working that evening are what bring it together. The face of that flawless effort on this particular evening was Antonio. He was mellow while being engaging. Witty without being rude or condescending. This is not pure personality.

Tasso is incredible and with his proactive help and guidance, we just didn't have to worry about many of the details that often come up (e.g., his team even cut out and set up all the place cards and party favors on our behalf). Everyone loved the food and the bar was very efficient, so that no one had to wait long for a drink. Tasso was also extremely flexible in giving us everything we needed for a very affordable price. For a beautiful, premium venue in Tribeca that's easy to access and serves delicious food, it is really incredible how affordable it was.

5.0,9/11/2016,"There are not enough stars to give an honest rating to Thalassa and Tasso (Thalassa's event coordinator)! My wife and I were married at Thalassa on 9/4/16, and Tasso and the staff there worked tirelessly to put on an absolutely perfect wedding for us! From the moment we set foot in Thalassa to visit as a potential wedding venue, we were greeted with impeccable service and a beautiful atmosphere. We had a rather long planning time of 1.5 years, during which Tasso was so patient, reassuring, and wonderful. Each time we visited the restaurant to either show our photographers or our parents, Tasso and the staff made sure we were taken care of with drinks, snacks, and a comfortable place to sit and plan. Whether we were 1 year or 3 days before our wedding date, Tasso always responded to inquiries immediately, and was always ready to accommodate any extra need we might have. The wedding day itself could not have been more perfect. The restaurant was set up so beautifully, the staff were so attentive and polite, and Tasso was there to oversee everything. The food was absolutely fantastic and just as delicious as anytime we went into the restaurant for a more typical dining experience. The bartenders and serving staff were amazing, and always present should anyone need anything. Tasso, the staff, and Thalassa in general are truly amazing. They seamlessly transition a fantastic restaurant into a perfect wedding venue from one day to the next, and do so with absolute elegance, patience, and the utmost perfect customer service. My wife and I are so thankful we had our wedding at Thalassa, and are so excited to continue to go back for brunch, dinner, and cocktails to relive the perfect day that Tasso and Thalassa gave us.

This is not your typical NY restaurant, each table provides lots of privacy - perfect for a date, or business dinner. The service was top notch. You'll feel like you're the only patron in the restaurant. The food and wine are both amazing. We dined for restaurant week, and each coarse was solid and top quality.

Loved the crab cakes and the spinach bites, was not a fan of their tuna tartar (was not cold enough and lacked in flavor..was dissapointed since I love sashimi) the only thing I didn't like was that the bathroom was downstairs (not sure if that is the only bathroom in the whole restaurant) but guest from upstairs started coming down and walking through the dinner which was a little inconvenient.

I particularly like the bread and the fish tacos. I'm giving three stars for two reasons: 1) as one of the users pointed out, they use way to much salt. One hour after dinner I was very thirsty and I drank all night more than two bottles of water. Thus, my advice to them is SWS (Stop With Salt, Stop With Salt); 2) the food is ok, but overpriced.

4.0,3/25/2016,"We went here for the first time tonight and were wowed but the decor (though a part of me went ""ugh,"" knowing that it would likely be reflected in menu prices; think you don't get charged for those windsail decorations? Think again. The 'internal decor premium.')This all said, it's a delicious place, and the P2P ratio (price to portions ratio) is TOTALLY FINE! (Usually terrible at places in this part of town). You get a free cold tomato soup, plus a free mashed potato/olive oil spread.Here's what we had: lamb chop appetizer and 3-cheese plate, both delicious. Then for entrees I had a stuffed dover sole and filet mignon. They were delicious (at the time, more on this later). Desert we had baklava (sp??) and chocolate molten cake, both superb. Why a star off? Two reasons. First, it was hard to get the freaking check and to actually pay once we reviewed it. Yeah, I know you're in a place where it's leaking money, but come on. Second, we were both super thirsty about an hour or so after dinner. It definitely like a little too much sodium on some of these dishes. There's currently a lot of debate about the science behind NYC's new sodium guidelines. But how about a non-health reason: you most likely don't need it, and it makes everyone's mouth dry!!

5.0,12/29/2015,"My husband and two friends enjoyed Christmas Eve dinner here last week. The menu, service, ambiance, and food quality were all top-notch.  We called around to several restaurants a few weeks in advance, and chose Thalassa based on their Tribeca location and the fact they they'd be serving their regular menu for Christmas Eve as opposed to a prix fixe menu.When we arrived, there was only one other couple in the restaurant, and the place was very quiet. We changed that almost immediately! After all, there were four of us and it was Christmas Eve, and we were excited to get the evening started.Our server explained that they did indeed have a prix fixe menu (we think it was a last-minute decision since he spoke the menu and there was nothing to distribute on paper), but also identified they'd be serving the regular menu sans about 6-7 items they were not planning to offer. The menu is fairly large, so that was no deterrence.The server started by bringing us each a little sample of soup, compliments of the chef. As for my meal, I kept things easy and enjoyed the horiatiki salad as well as the cheese platter. Because I couldn't decide on a cheese (got to pick 3 from a list), I asked for the chef to decide on my 3 cheeses but NO feta. I eat feta all the time at home, and really wanted something different. Whatever he picked for me was so tasty, especially the pieces of grilled white cheese on that plate.  I still think of that cheese all these days later!After the meal, the server brought us all little canape-type desserts to share. It was a nice touch and happy ending to a really enjoyable meal and Christmas Eve experience. I'd easily go back to Thalassa for a non-holiday meal the next time I'm in NYC.",4,2,1,Tara J.,"Delray Beach, FL",265,596,342

The entrees and appetizers were the stars of the show. I've had their sea bass before which was extremely delicious and their grilled octopus is really delicious. However, they are not very big into desserts. I would go here more for savory dishes and save myself for a place that specializes in desserts.

5.0,10/8/2015,"Thalassa is hands down my favorite greek restaurant in NYC.  I had dinner there last night for the 3rd time and it was unbelievable!  We started with the Zucchini Fritters and Shrimp Youvetsi to share, both were so delicious.  For my entree I had the Seafood Thalassina and it was the best seafood dish I've had in such a long time.  It was a mix of scallops, shrimp and mussels in a light white wine sauce with orzo.  The seafood mixed with the orzo created such a good balance of flavors and textures.  Somehow it tasted so light and fresh but still had so much flavor.  I can't wait to go back and get the exact same dish!  My friend ordered the Durado and said it was fantastic.  For dessert we had the baklava and the molten chocolate cake, both were so good and the perfect ending to our fantastic meal.  I should also add that the service was impeccable.  We were feeling indecisive about what to order and our lovely waiter helped us through the menu and with his guidance we managed to order perfectly.  The restaurant itself is so elegant and beautiful, the dim lighting and candles make it a perfect date spot too.  They also have a really amazing downstairs and I believe it's mostly used for special events.  My only complaint about this restaurant is that it's too far from the UES where I live, but I must say it's definitely worth the trip downtown!",0,0,0,Lindsey H.,"New York, NY",122,86,2

That followed with fatty lamb chops and branzino where, while the flavor of the fish was good, it was only one small filet.  Where was the other half of the fish?!?!The restaurant was 3/4 empty on a Saturday night and after dinner we definitely knew why.  Avoid.",1,0,1,B B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,31,1

The yoghurt desert was a wonderful ending, perfectly rich Greek yoghurt. Service is also excellent from start to finish, all their staff are attentive even if they're not your server.

2.0,7/25/2015,"This review is for their brunch experience. I went to the restaurant in May 2015 with my family and had a party of approximately 12 people and boy was it an expensive experience. If you want to feel like you belong with the Tribeca bourgeoisie, then you should probably eat here. For normal folks, I wouldn't recommend it.My nieces ordered their pancakes which was approximately $14. What came out were 4 mini sized (silver dollar) pancakes topped with berries. Nothing else. $14 for that?! As for me, I ordered their smoked salmon omelet. I forgot the exact price but I believe it was around $18. What came out was a strip of smoked salmon WRAPPED with a thin layer of egg. It was not an omelet. I wasn't sure what it was, but I ate it anyway because hell, it was $18 and I was going to feel full! Sadly, after I finished my entire plate, I was craving more food. I ended up going to Chinatown after brunch got myself some dim sum.  The food was not spectacular and the service was slow. Our waiter kept on apologizing because he said they just got a new brunch menu and the employees were trying to adapt to it. Sorry, but you should have gotten your sh*t together before you opened, especially at the price we were paying. There was hardly anyone else at the restaurant and we waited an hour for our food!Albeit, the venue, ambiance, and space was excellent.

I did not care for it at all.

2.0,4/15/2015,"If you don't want to read a long review, and you're in Tribeca craving Greek, go to The Greek instead.  They're very close to each other and I found The Greek to be superior.We should have known it was a sign of trouble when we walked in this past Monday at 7:15 and there was no hostess.  The bartender was on his cell-phone texting or e-mailing away so he was of no help until a busboy pointed us out.  The bartender then sat us down in the main dining room - which was beautiful - perfect for a Greek place..We received a wine list and ordered two glasses of sparkling wine and a bottle of red.  The sparkling was really sweet and a bizarre item to have as one of the two champagne/sparkling's by the glass.  We enjoyed the red wine.  The wine list was helpful, great descriptions of the different wine regions in Greece.Went with the prix fixe, which is unusual for us, but it had what we wanted on it.  Let's go plate by plate.Amuse bouche - some sort of fish soup, maybe?  We had to guess as the soup in the espresso cup was just dropped off without saying a word.  We didn't care for it.Kale and beet salad with pine nuts and cheese - Yogurt dressing was the best part.  3 pieces of beets that tasted like they came out of a can and the cheese was flavorless.  The flavor of the Yogurt and beets may have been elevated with a sharper cheese.Seafood ravioli - the single ravioli was good, but most of the saffron sauce was left behind.Pikilia (additional app on top of the prix fixe) - an assortment of four dips.  No stand-outs, all were edible but nothing worth writing anything further about.  I place a lot of emphasis on Tzatziki at a Greek place, all the Moms in my old neighborhood made it, it didn't do it for me here.Grilled lamb-chops and lemon potatoes - Two lamb chops, both on the small side.  Charred on the outside, rare on the inside.  Requested rare and got it, didn't get the need to burn the outside so terribly.  After I tasted one lemon potato the rest were left behind.Red snapper over risotto - Another small portion.  I understand that Greeks like to season fish with oregano (done right I can dig it too), but you would have thought the oregano cap fell off in the kitchen - way too much.  Risotto in most forms is one of my favorite entrees - didn't finish this one.Panna cotto with poached pear - seems they over flavor or under flavor, this needed more help than they tiny piece of pear would provide.Martini yogurt with candied fruit - I struggle to get food served in drink vessels.  Is supposed to be fancy?  Does it do anything to enhance the food?  Don't know.  And where was the food that was beautifully presented on the web-site?  None of these were in the same presentation ballpark.Our evening ended as we sat their with a little wine left in each glass and our empty dessert plates.  We were never asked if we wanted coffee/tea or more wine.  Just dropped the check off before the table was cleared.$225 later we left just feeling odd.  Not sick, but bloated, and not from being full.  We had our bottle of wine on the 9:39 to Babylon.The ambiance is great, not too dim, not to light.  Nice table, and I do like the feel of the dining room with the exposed brick.  The busboys also deserve a mention as they were very attentive and on the money - unlike the lone waiter.  Their scores on Zagat's are more than respectable, but I spent my first 18 years in Astoria - and this was not good Greek food in my opinion.",4,0,1,John M.,"Wantagh, NY",1,257,5

The seafood and orzo dish was delicious and the others I was with had the lamb chops and while delicious, it left them hungry due to the small portion size. The reason I gave only 2 stars is because of the horrible service we recieved. Drinks took forever to come to the table, the waitor forgot to put in two orders from the table so those individuals ended up getting their food 30 minutes after the rest of the table. It was very obvious that people at the table were not happy, and rather than come to the table the manager scurried away. We then requested to speak to him and it took him quite a while to come to the table, and although he apologized he was rather dismissive of the issues our table was having. He then proceeded to send the table dessert to make up for what had happened, but it was after a number of us had already ordered dessert. It was ashame because the food was good, I just think that managment needed to handel the situation better. I don't think I would ever go back, because I have experienced bad service but if brought to the attention of the manager it has been dealt with much better.

(Believe or not, once I had to pay at another restaurant $20 separately just to put the candles I brought in to a slice of cake!!)  A complementary desert wine and small sweet plate were a bonus in the end of our meal.  Overall, we really enjoyed the food there.  But, a greatest thing was the senior waiter at our table -- very classy and we felt very special.

3.0,9/22/2014,"Some of the fish dishes were excellent but the lamb sank was only so-so.  We were 5 diners so we were able to sample many dishes.  But three fell far short of what we hoped. The dolmas were bland and pasty. The sea bass was overcooked. And the crispy scallop appetizer came in a pool of oil, not tasty olive oil, but cooking oil. There were many 'gifts; from the kitchen that we appreciated. A salted cod amuse bouche was lovely and the chocolates with dessert were memorable. The wine list is extraordinarily expensive and there were few options under $75. The tab for the 5 of us was about what you would expect, $400+ before tip. All in all, we won't be regular customers, but we might go back and order very selectively.",0,0,0,Chris C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0

4.0,8/10/2014,"Thalassa is hands down one of the most beautiful restaurants in New York and the service was attentive and friendly.  The night we visited was the evening of a perfect summer day in August, so the restaurant wasn't crowded or too noisy. I understand that in the winter the restaurant is hopping with regulars.  We thought it was Restaurant Week and found out it wasn't, but while expensive, it wasn't outrageous.  The crab salad appetizer was delicious as was the fresh fish with lemon sauce and sauteed greens.  The amuse bouche we were served, along with the hearty breads and dipping sauces, were a really nice touch.  Our visit will serve as an inspiration to visit Greece one of these days ... in the meantime, Thalassa was a find.",1,0,0,Dana T.,"New York, NY",20,100,29

5.0,7/10/2014,"I recently went to Thalassa in Tribeca for an impromptu dinner. We were supposed to be out of town, and miraculously our flight was canceled. At the last minute, we were added to the reservation with no problem on a holiday weekend. The restaurant was extremely accommodating to us. Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted with the most fabulous fresh fish display. This restaurant is known for having fresh fish with a large assortment. Before even looking at the menu, we were given the most amazing bread to snack on. It was so soft and had some spices on it to give it that perfect Mediterranean flavor. MMM....I could use some of that right now! The bread was also accompanied with a platter of olives, baba ganoush, and olive oil. I know everyone at the table enjoyed the olives and said they were very fresh (I am not an olive eater, so I can't concur...eeeww). The baba ganoush was extremely interesting and tasty. My boyfriend and I both thought it had a crab flavor, but in reality it had red peppers in it! It was very delicious. The olive oil was very fresh and tasted very Mediterranean. They put some capers in it to add a nice touch of salt flavor and also make it visually appealing. There were bottles of Thalassa Olive Oil downstairs near the bathroom, which makes me think you can purchase their olive oil! We were also given a complimentary conch fritter that was to die for! It was so full of flavor and the conch was very moist and fresh. Luckily, two of the women in my party were gluten-free, so more Conch fritters for me!!!The octapodi was so fresh and the chunks of octopus were very generous. The sauce that was poured over it was very light and refreshing. Also, sun dried tomatoes were a nice addition to this dish giving it a little more zest. I would never think to pair these items together, but they really complimented each other.The calamari was phenomenal! When I think of calamari, I think of the typical fried calamari where you lose all the flavor of the fish and are eating a ""heart attack special."" This calamari was stuffed with feta, tomatoes, and pine nuts and had tons of flavor! I definitely liked this approach to calamari.The seafood saganaki was a whole array of seafood together sitting in a delicious tomato garlic sauce. If I could drink the sauce, I would! Thanks to the waitress for giving us more bread to soak up this sauce when we were finished with the seafood.The colossal crab meat salad was so refreshing with an amazing truffle flavor. The crab meat sat below the bed of lettuce and the other ingredients as a nice surprise under all the healthy ""stuff"". There was definitely a generous amount of crab in this dish with an amazing flavor of truffle.For the meal, I split two dishes. The first one, Seafood Thalassina   was similar to the seafood saganaki, whereas it had an assortment of shellfish in it, but it had a totally different flavor. The seafood sat in a white wine sauce atop a helping of orzo. The orzo soaked up the very buttery garlicy sauce. MMM...Sometimes white wine sauces can be bland and flavorless, and luckily this was not the case with this dish! It had tons of flavor while still maintaining that lightness that you would want from a white wine sauce. Our second dish, the Alaskan King Crab Leg with truffle oil salad was similar to the Colossal crab meat appetizer, but had tons more crab in it! The only surprising thing about this dish was I was expecting the crab to be still in its crab leg cluster. Part of me was upset I couldn't spend my time picking at the shells, and part of me was happy because I got to easily eat this very meaty dish without fighting with my food. Also, I had the option to have the crab legs beer battered, but opted for the fresher chilled version. Very delicious!We also received a complimentary dessert from the restaurant which was pieces of chocolate that were very rich in flavor. I can't say no to chocolate! Along with this complimentary dessert, the restaurant gave the whole table complimentary dessert wine! Very sweet and thoughtful. Lastly, we ordered my favorite dessert, the Molten chocolate cake. If this dessert is on any menu, its a must order for me! This one was very good, not the best I have ever had, but very good! It had the right consistency, with the warm melty inside, and soft outside, but wasn't as rich as other's that I have had.All in all our experience was great. The only negative was that when we ordered bottles of wine from the menu, our first 2 choices were not available. It seemed as though all the moderate priced wines were sold out, and they only have the pricier ones available. The restaurant let us taste one to see if we liked it, and offered to give it to us, compliments of the house since we had ordered two others previously with no luck of retrieval. Definitely a nice way to make up for not having the wines we wanted.I would definitely go back to this restaurant again, as it was very enjoyable",4,0,0,Carlen M.,"Manhattan, NY",370,97,473

5.0,6/25/2014,"This restaurant definitely does not disappoint. I'm not a huge proponent of Greek Food, especially after the disaster that was Kefi. However, we both decided to try again. My girlfriend and I traveled to this spot, and lo and behold, they were hosting a wedding that night. However, the British host assured us that our reservation still stands, and we wont have to wait longer than 10 minutes. The space is large, trendy, and has a nice modern feel to it. The bar is huge, and it looked like they were setting up food for the cocktail hour, which looked really nice.   So, we got to our table promptly, and we were seated. I ordered the seafood saganaki. And the Seafgood Thalassina. My girlfriend ordered the Octopodi (Grilled Octopus) and the Alaskan King Crab leg, (I believe). We also ordered the Veal Keftes (Veal Meatballs), and Phyllo Triangles. My Seafood Saganaki was absolutely delicious. The mussels, the shrimp, and the sauce were delicious and flavorful. My girlfriend's octopus was cooked just right, and packed full of flavor. (We share a piece of each other's food when we go out. This way we have tasted a little of everything.) The meatballs were very soft and juicy. and the sauce that those came in was absolutely delicious. The Triangles were also very very good.   My girlfriend's King Crab leg was huge, and also very savory, and huge. Did I mention huge? They need to find a larger plate for this dish.  It was huge and good. We washed it down with a nice white wine, who's name escapes me. The bill was high, however, totally worth it. I would treat this place as a special treat for all of you diners looking to go somewhere special. This is a place you either A.) Go out to celebrate. B.) Really Impress a date. or C.)

Most memorable was the service. They don't skimp on providing attentive, courteous service all throughout the meal, without ever being intrusive.

2.0,3/2/2014,"The fish here is amazing--fresh and beautifully prepared and the atmosphere is quietly upscale. However, I was very frustrated by the wine selection.  The first two wines we chose (the ""reasonably priced"" ones) were not available (even though they were on the menu).   We finally found a Riesling that, while above our price range, wasn't super expensive.  Since we were a party of six, we ordered a second bottle, but guess what, they were out of that wine! Apparently we had drunk the last bottle of that Riesling, one of the few remaining reasonably priced white wines on the menu.  And so, we had to order a different, more expensive wine (which was not very good).At that point, having ordered 3 bottles of wine that were listed on their menu, that were then NOT in stock, you would think there would have been some attempt to say, ""we're so sorry but since the THREE wines you selected are not in stock, let us offer you this bottle at the same price,"" but no such luck, we just had to pay for a much more expensive wine.And normally I wouldn't have written about this in a review, but now, having dined here three times over the past couple of years, and every time having the first wine I choose ""not being in stock"", I think its just a game for them: they list wines they don't have in stock and force you to buy more expensive ones.",4,0,0,Kate K.,"New York, NY",0,23,0

We were originally supposed to attend the Sat. night after Valentine's Day (2/15); unfortunately, the snow kept us inside. The person I spoke w/ over the phone that evening to reschedule my reservation was very nice and helpful. We rescheduled for the following Wed., and we had an excellent time overall. Here is a breakdown of the meal: The complimentary bread served to us at the beginning of the meal was cold and tasteless, although perfectly 'doughy.' It would have been much more enjoyable warmed beforehand, even just to take the chill out. The appetizers (scallops & grilled octopus) were excellent! Large portions, flavorful and beautifully presented. Our main course (Lavraki) was truly delectable. The chef was very accommodating to my request of cooking it wo/ oil and butter. Unfortunately, the portion of fish was much smaller than we expected. It was no more than 4 bites. Finally, the dessert (Mastiha Panna Cotta) was delicious and the portion was perfect. Our meal was pleasurable and absolutely worth the $89 we spent on the LivingSocial deal. However, this voucher was valued at $178, which seems outlandish and would have undoubtedly not been worth that steep price.

The decor is amazing.  The services is FLAWLESS.  It was a busy Saturday night at 9:30 and the hostess gave us the choice of a few different seats WITHOUT us asking.  They lowered the heat when I told them it was hot and they kept checking to make sure we were comfortable.  The octopus BLEW Milos away - crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside NO FAT.  The Levraki was DELICIOUS (perfect seasoned and moist) and was also a REASONABLE price - $38 I think...not the standard $50 or MORE you pay elsewhere...and the greens were perfect on the plate.  I also liked the spread that came complimentary on the table.  The wine was reasonable - about $50 for the bottle and it was a delicious Greek white (I love Greek wine).  The dessert was a chocolate thing that was delicious (too much wine). The waiter (female, but I still say waiter) offered to let us taste both that AND the after dinner wine before choosing.  It was a FLAWLESS evening and I cannot wait to go back.   They gave us cookies to take home and they were a delicious reminder in the morning of a fabulous dinner and GREAT service.",1,0,0,Karen M.,"New York, NY",38,177,185

The waiter was memorably rude - he was pushy, overly dramatic, completely unattentive, and when he did come, he rushed us and scoffed when we asked questions.Food: Mediocre to bad. Grape leaves were gross (and I love all grape leaves!) - zucchini chips were mediocre, and $24 for a fried zucchini? Really? The fish was fine, no complaints but not great. Tartare trio was the best. The waiter didn't have enough menus for us for dessert, and then he threw the menus in our faces - we ordered baklava and then it turned out that baklava was also the free dessert, which he didn't tell us. Annoying - and it wasn't even good!Not to mention my friend signed the bill and the waiter came back with another copy, telling him that he never signed it.

Softy candles and super-magnums line the walls but it's style over stuffiness here.The RW menu was fairly generous, with a delicious lamb chop that 3/4 of us ordered and 3/3 of us enjoyed. Also on offer were a halibut on a risotto bed (very good). The octopus starter was amazing, as good or better than anything I've had at my beloved Astoria tavernas. The panna cotta was very tasty, and my yogurt martini desert also delivered, the sour Greek yogurt offset nicely by strawberries and fruit jam. The rather affordable bottle of light-bodied GREEK Primitivo (!!!) hit the spot.

While I understand some reviewers complaining about the slow service (it did take about 10-12 minutes for us to get bread with dips), I have to say that everything we had at Thalassa was excellent. We had dolmas and grilled octopus for appetizers and both dishes tasted delicious. Octopus was very tender with a nice smokiness to it. My husband enjoyed the dolmas, but wished there were few extra on the plate (I believe were are 3 or 4 pieces on the plate). For entrees we ordered the red snapper and lamb chops. Again, we were both happy with our choices - the lemon potatoes that accompanied the lamb chops were some of the best potatoes I had. The side that came with a snapper was a very interesting textured grain or pasta (Israeli couscous, perhaps?) and the fish was perfectly cooked. There was nothing left on our plates, we practically licked them clean! The desserts - panna cotta and baklava - were nicely presented and tasted good. I'd say less of a walnut taste to panna cotta would have scored higher with me, but I am just not a big fan of nut extracts in pastry in general, so...Aside from bread with dips and olives, we also received a complimentary amuse-bouche - shrimp croquette, which was crispy on the outside but warm and tender inside, as well as complimentary dessert wine (from Mavrodaphne grapes, our server told us).

1.0,6/16/2013,"As you can see from my profile, I don't write a lot of reviews.  However,  I do eat out a lot.  So, typically, a restaurant will only get a review from me if is outstanding or incredibly bad.  As you can tell from the 1 star rating...this place is incredibly bad.  Things started out well, actually.  We were provided with trio of olive oil/olives/eggplant spread different breads.  The olive oil and both breads we had were both very good.  But, then, nobody ever came.  It was approximately 15 minutes before we even saw our server.  It was then another HALF AN HOUR before we got our drink order.  My wife's drink was apparently OK.  However, I ordered the Agave Rock (I think...the tequila drink) and it was horrible.  It tasted like a college cocktail...almost like a screwdriver.  I could barely even taste the tequila.I don't even remember how long it was before we ordered our food.  What I do remember is that an hour and fifteen minutes in, we still didn't have our food.  At that point, my wife went to the host to complain and had to wait another five minutes to even see a manager.  Of course, as soon as she left to complain, the food came, but as she had to wait so long, her food was a little cold.  She apparently thought her dishes were fine, but I ordered the Arctic Char and it was terrible.  It had no flavor and was extremely oily.  The skin was also burnt which permeated the whole flavor of the fish.Oh, I forgot about what happened when my wife complained...pretty much nothing.  The manager said he would look into it and we never saw him again.  I will say that they did comp my wife's food, gave us a desert, and a small glass of wine at the end.  But the experience was so horrible and the fact that nobody ever apologized really just left a sour taste in my mouth.  I imagine this place could be good if you order a different fish and have a different server.  Our server was horrible and, sadly, that will result in us never considering this place again.",0,0,0,John E.,"Chicago, IL",1,17,0
2.0,5/18/2013,"Points for style.  Points for knowing that your customers are not being served well.I understand why Thalassa has a wide range of reviews.  Unfortunately, I ended up seeing it on the low end of the scale.Having worked in a restaurant in my distant past, I know that some nights are difficult for the manager.  It happens because the staff doesn't show up to work, pre-serving preparations did not happen, or difficulty with the kitchen equipment.  Customers usually don't know the cause - they just have a poor experience.  I hope we went to Thalassa on a ""bad night"" because if our experience was typical, then Thalassa isn't cutting the grade.After being seated, and given a choice of water and menus, we waited for perhaps 15 minutes before the charming server appeared.  We had one question ""what comes with the fish entree?"".  We ordered our fish, a vegetable side, zucchini-eggplant chips and wine.  Server suggested that we add some potatoes.The zucchini-eggplant would have been good except it was smothered with tzatziki - vegetable was lost in yogurt.  The broccoli rate was similar to the thing that was served with the fish entree - note to server - make it clear that we don't need both.  The potatoes were not impressive.  The fish was fine.  The retsina was as expected.  Knowing that they had taken too long to serve us, they sent some hummus, oil and bread prior to serving the food we ordered.  Altogether too much food - we could have avoided the potato and broccoli.It is a beautiful set of rooms with high ceilings and colorful lighting.",1,0,0,Phil G.,"Dana Point, CA",92,609,389

4.0,3/15/2013,"Since I was already a couple of cocktails in (I met some friends at Weather Up prior to dinner.), I chose to forgo ordering a beverage at the beginning of the meal and, instead, opted for the pre-set wine pairing (this meals was at a media tasting event).Upon being seated, our table was promptly dressed with a basket of warm pita and sliced breads, olive oil, assorted pitted olives, and hummus.An amuse bouche followed shortly thereafter:  A vegetarian fritter of some sort, perhaps lentil or chickpea, crowned with creamy yogurt and snipped green onions. An array of six dishes made up our bountiful appetizer course:  Zucchini-Eggplant Chips, Octapodi, Tartare Trio, Pikilia, Maine Diver Sea Scallops, and Arugula (salad).Zucchini-Eggplant ChipsThinly-sliced ribbons of eggplant and zucchini were enveloped by a crunchy, tempura-like batter and interlaced with creamy tzatziki.  Cubes of deep fried saganaki cheese moated the perfectly-constructed ""stack"" of heaven.Octapodi""I don't eat octopus,"" I politely responded, upon being offered the octopodi.  ""But thanks, anyways.""  After receiving a fair amount of peer preassure, jabs, and insistence that ""Greek-prepared octopus is different,"" I gave in and took a damn bite.  Then another.  Followed by three or four more.  The texture of the meat was firm, yet incredibly tender at the same time, if that even makes any sense.  Does it?  There were no creepy-looking tentacles that locked themselves on to my tongue, ravaging the inside of my mouth.  I guess that's just what I had always feared would happen. The simply-grilled Portuguese octopus was accompanied by micro greens and a zesty, citrus aioli.      Tartare TrioIce cream-like scoops of sushi-grade dorado, tuna, and European sea bass were presented as a perfectly-packaged trio, served atop marinated vegetables and crowned with either taramaosalata, tzatziki, or garlic/almond mousse.  Each tartare was finished with a drizzle of fragrant truffle oil.PikiliaWarm pita points and Greek dips go together like peas and carrots.  Don't they?  The world ""pikilia"" means ""variety"" in Greek.  And that's exactly what this appetizer was - a variety of four dips.  While I found a few to be too firm and cold, flavor-wise, they were all delightful and robust.Maine Diver Sea ScallopsFresh, jumbo scallops were delicately wrapped in ""kataifi,"" or shredded phyllo dough, and baked with sheep's milk butter before being presented atop a drizzled kalamata olive/balsamic reduction.  The dish was chopped with a colorful ""salsa"" of tomatoes and green onions.This was, hands down, one of the most creative - and perfectly-executed - dishes that I've had in recent memory.  The crunchy, baked kataifi played so well, texturally, against the supple flesh of the scallops.  Bravo and worth a trip to Thalassa, alone! Arugula (salad)Judging by the menu, ""Arugula"" is the closest salad option that fits both the description (on the menu) and the actual ingredients on the plate.  Well, with the exception of the arugula leaves, of course!  Because if you look at the picture, above, there is no arugula in sight!  That didn't bother me too much, as I find that lettuce is boring and just gets in the way of everything.Encircled by a moat of sliced, ruby-red beets was a mountain of (some sort of) a creamy, voluptuous dip that was tented by rectangular ""logs"" of batter-fried saganaki cheese.For our entree course, our server presented the table with a whole, grilled branzino, before vanishing - with plate - back to the kitchen.  Upon his return, each of us received a plate topped with branzino filet, greens, and a halved lemon.BranzinoThe typing paper white-hued filet was finished with a quick - and buttery - pan sear and topped with capers.  The flesh was so creamy, clean, and fresh, with a flavor evoking a subtle taste of the briny ocean.  I ate every last bite.  For dessert, an array of four plates made up our final course:  Baklava, Ekmek, Mastiha Panna Cotta, Valrhona Molten Chocolate Cake.BaklavaOf the four desserts, this was my personal favorite: Cylindrically-shaped baklava was beautifully presented and paired with berries and coffee ice cream.  I found the latter to be a random afterthought, as ""coffee"" flavor would not have been my first pick for the ice cream accompaniment.EkmekEncircled by a dark chocolate shell was a blend of Kaitaifi, phyllo dough ""noodles,"" cream and pistachios.  Mixed berries and a scoop of pistachio ice cream accompanied.Mastiha Panna CottaDelicate and subtly-scented with masthiha (sap from an evergreen bush), the panna cotta was topped with caramelized pears and accompanied with mixed dark berries. Valrhona Molten Chocolate CakeWhile I'd never ""throw a molten chocolate cake out of bed,"" it's certainly not a dessert that I have particular respect for or a desire to order.  Outside of a Jean-Georges establishment, that is.  I mean, even frickin' Chili's has a  ""molten chocolate cake!""",2,2,1,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184

We could really feel the server wanting to take care of us and give us the best dinner experience.  The food is fantastic. I enjoyed everything I ate. My favorite of all is their traditional greek salad and spinach pie. I recently spent three months traveling Greece, and eating this food took me right back. The fish tartar trio was amazing.

We had two fish, which i cannot remember what they were because while my friend and i order different dishes, it looks almost identical (down to the garnishes).

4.0,8/25/2012,"RW has come to an end, but some of the restaurant extended their RW menu. Thalassa is one of it. :)Made a reservation for 5 of us, pretty excited because it's our ladies night. Looking through the menu, I definitely want something that's Greek since it's a greek restaurant. Appetizer:- we had ordered everything on the menu. I personally prefer the king salmon. It was cooked to perfection with some honey(I guess because I tasted something sweet), and topped with some greens, peppers and tomato. The texture was really soft and the skin was also cooked to slightly crispy but not burnt. The watermelon salad was nothing special, just watermelon which I will not recommend it because it's pretty simple that you can make it at home. As for the rock shrimp martini, I think it's just fried shrimp but it tasted pretty good with a dash of lemon.Entree:- Grilled lavraki.. I ordered this, the fish was good but there was a slightly burnt in my entree which I am not too happy about it. I have to spit it out because it's way too burnt.- Halibut: I WILL RECOMMEND THIS. The reason why I did not order this is because my friend had ordered and we decided to share. The halibut was topped with PISTACHIO!!! and you can enjoy some mussels too. The texture was kinda like the king salmon, soft and tender. It was cooked with white wine and you will feel like you are enjoying a SUMMER dish.Desserts:you will always have room for it.. - GREEK YOGURT SANDAE MARTINI!! This is the highlight of the day. It's greek yogurt. My favorite, but they have mixed it with honey and blueberries. WOW!! It's thick, fruity, and sweet. That's how I like my dessert to be. But be careful tho!! Be sure to mixed everything up because you will taste the honey at the bottom which is way to sweet.- Panna cotta, I only tasted a bite. The texture was great but I am not a huge panna cotta fan. But this panna cotta was way better than many other restaurant.Have I mentioned about the bread? They have 3 different kinds of bread. My favorite is the bread which is soft and I think it has raspberry in it. I am not quite sure. They don't serve you with butter but olive instead. (not a olive person so my friend took most of the olives :p)Service was great as they did not rush us through our order since we were sitting down chatting most of the time.

5.0,8/14/2012,"We ate like kings at Thalassa, and we were served like royalty too. I can only remember a handful of times in my life I savored so much delectable food in one sitting I thought my heart and stomach would burst. The drinks were flowing, the laughter was escaping like balloon helium from our lungs. Life is sweet. We must have spent four hours there, my friends and I, and it's going to take me a moment to even remember what on earth we ordered because it was half the menu. We started out with some raspberry puree martinis, which tasted like fruity heaven with a kick of vodka. Then we ordered what I believe to be only off the appetizer/first course menu. Or should I say, everything off the appetizer/first course menu. The buttery scallops in a crispy nest-like home literally melted in my mouth, I could cry at the thought of them. Needless to say, they were my favorite. The Greek salad took me back to my weekend in Corfu years back. The eggplant chips with a decadant tangy-yogurty-cheese dip are everything you would imagine grilled eggplant in a soft, doughy crisp to be. The octopus tasted like mini hot dogs sprinkled with sea crack. The tartar was divine. I'll never forget when one of my friends said, in an accidentally snobby voice, ""You're blocking, the tartar,"" as she tried to capture in a photo the glory of it all. Everyone busted out laughing because we felt like we were getting the star treatment. And indeed, we were. Bear with me, we're almost through it all. The dolmas, which are stuffed grape leaves, were so mouth-watering we pushed through our over-satisfied stomachs and tastebuds to savor them. Naturally, Thalassa's dolmas had veal in them that was so tasty you just wanted to hold it in your mouth for a while. Am I missing anything? I'm just eager to get to dessert. Oh yes, the warm, moist pita bread and hummus was so scrumptious we ate it throughout the meal, in spite of how full we were growing. And I'm picky with my pita. I like it straight-from-the-oven steaming and soft.Now, the moment you've all been waiting for. Dessert was flaky baklava so rich it filled my tongue with it's nutty, subtly honey flavor. Dessert was also a beautifully displayed chocolate...thing. It was filled with some sort of raspberry, fruity goodness and it looked like a chocolate bar on the outside. It would have been the most marvelous dessert had the lava cake not stolen the show entirely. It was all I could bask in for the remainder of the evening. I cannot speak of Thalassa's lava cake without getting a little emotional. How it could top what I had just consumed when it arrived is beyond me, but it did. I want to dive into its thick, hot chocolatey center and stay there forever, nestled against its strong, fresh outer cake layer. I had to call my boyfriend after because I think I had an affair with that molten chocolate lava cake. If you come to Thalassa for anything, please have this overwhelmingly good cake. It was so delicious, we had to order another one just to take it all in. This time, it came with truffles and fruits I hadn't even realized the first time because I couldn't wait to get to the center of its love.This is the only review I've ever written for a restaurant or otherwise. I didn't even get to the fantastic bartender and staff there, who are full of life, clearly loving their job, and who are eager to serve you. I even remember thinking how respectful they were of serving my friends and me, but letting us have our time together. I almost wanted to talk to them more because they all seem so interesting. One of them is even from Greece.In sum, to say my experience at Thalassa was satisfying is a grave understatement.",1,0,0,Heather S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

My friends and I ordered off the restaurant week menu so I can only attest to those few options. The feta stuffed calamari i had as an app was decent but a bit rubbery to cut thru.  For the entrée I had the grilled sea bass and was pretty disappointed. It was the thinnest and flattest piece of fish I've ever seen and not only that, but as I was trying to converse with my friends I had to frequently pick bones out of my mouth!  For the price and caliber of this place you wouldn't expect to be choking on bones from a thin piece of fish!  The molten chocolate cake for dessert was the only course i actually enjoyed and even that started becoming too sweet after eating the first half.The tables were huge so I had to shout across the table most of the time.

The overall vibe of the restaurant was pretty cool; lots of younger people but also lots of young families around.They started us off with bread and rich olive oil, a delicious hummus and ripe olives. That day the chef also provided us with a (very small) complimentary cup of clam chowder which might have been one of the highlights of the entire meal. We ordered calamari as an appetizer and was surprised to receive large pieces of squid with a tangy filling. It was interesting but still good; not great.I ordered the lamb shank, my one friend the filet mignon and my other friend the Lethrini fish that our helpful waiter kept suggesting. The lamb was okay. The fliet was pretty good. But the fish was extremely buttery and delicious.We ended our meals with three different desserts: one pannacotta, one assortment of gelato and something else that I guess was forgettable. The ice cream came in four little cones which was great fun to look at and eat. The pannacotta was smooth and creamy.The service was very good for us although other reviewers have been saying otherwise. We got our food quickly and left with full stomachs.

The atmosphere is modern/trendy. The food was ok...I almost gave it 3 stars for the food but I wanted to give 4.5 for service and 3.5 for food so it averaged out to 4. We got the restaurant week menu too which may not be as good as the normal menu. But first we started with the regular mussels off the menu and they were FABULOUS. Mussels in a yummy light sauce with rosemary and delicious feta cheese. The restaurant week apps were small versions of their grape leaves (yum!) and my husband got the stuffed calamari - also a huge hit!! Our entrees left a bit to be desired - ouzo in a pretty flavorless butter sauce with some seafood. Not great. The desert was a huge portion of a lava chocolate cake - also super yummy!

The service was excellent.  We had a bottle of wine with dinner, and neither our wine nor water glasses were every empty.  Everyone was polite and cheerful, and it was overall great to be there.

We've eaten at Thalassa many times before, most recently about two months ago. That visit was very enjoyable...not the case this time around.The service was extraordinarily slow. We ordered a bottle of white wine and drank water for 20 minutes waiting for the wine. We ordered mussels in ouzo, a Greek fishermans soup and a Greek style fruit du mer for starters. The appetizers took over half an hour to arrive. The mussels (2 orders) were both room temperature when they were delivered. The shrimp in both of the other dishes were soooo dry that I'm certain they had been cooked much earlier and reused. Just shockingly poor. We sent the mussels back & 10 minutes later received the replacement mussels which were as they should have been. I alerted the manager to our growing displeasure. He apologized for the delay & wandered off. We didn't feel much better. The REAL wait lay ahead...The time between appetizers and mains was ONE HOUR! Including our frequent questions to the staff (waiter & mangers alike) about the location of our meals. We finally received our dinners. My wife's black sea bass was overcooked and dry. My sea bass was just fine. We received our $344 bill (we ordered in all 4 appetizers, 4 entrees, a side of asparagus and a side of roasted potatoes (underdone),1 bottle of wine, 2 glasses of ouzo and an order of bakclava.) The manager removed one of the appetizers. We paid the bill and left at 11:20pm!!! It will be some time before we return.

1.0,12/7/2011,"Dining at Thalassa was the worst dining experience I ever had in NYC.  First, the waiter, who proclaimed to also be the wine expert, apparently didn't realize that the Willamette Valley was in Oregon because when I told him I was looking for an Oregon pinot, he told me they don't have any on the wine list, notwithstanding several listed from the Willamette Valley. The waiter was not merely inattentive, but truly incompetent.  He spilled food on my coat.  He argued with me about bringing me a new knife when I asked for a clean one, he made numerous errors on or order and he was generally unavailable when we needed assistance.  We were a party of seven and he failed to bring one of our entrees (because he placed the order incorrectly) and by the time he actually delivered it, the rest of our party was finished dining.   Water service was nowhere to be found and the waiter generally seemed confused about  his responsibilities.  We spoke to the manager and she tried to make up for the server's incompetence with some free sweets.  However, the worst part  of the evening came when we settled up the bill (spending nearly $1,000 on this terrible experience).  When we gave the coat check our claim tickets, she only gave us two of our three umbrellas.  When we pointed out that we arrived with three umbrellas (which we borrowed from our hotel for a fee for failure to return), she actually argued with us and suggested that we only had two umbrellas.  We finally left, frustrated with the entire experience and resigned to never return.  The food is average, but the service is terrible.  No comparison to AVRA or Milos, which are both far superior.",3,0,0,Craig B.,"Irvine, CA",0,3,0

4.0,11/27/2011,"My brother suggested Thalassa when the restaurant where we originally had reservations for the night before the New York City Marathon (two of our party were running) canceled the reservation we'd had for months due to a fire. I had less than a week to find a table for six at a reasonable hour, and this was an excellent suggestion. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful in a tasteful, comfortable way, the staff are incredibly knowledgeable and hospitable, and the food is imaginative and delicious.We arrived on the dot for our 6 p.m. reservation, but due to some miscommunication, one couple in our party of six was late. They showed us to our table and told us not to worry, to make ourselves at home. We did. FOR AN HOUR. Our friends just had the time mixed up and arrived at 7 p.m. The reason I share this is to praise Thalassa's staff... everyone from the hosts, to the sommelier, to the waiters and managers, told us not to worry, to take our time, to enjoy the evening, etc. We never got the feeling that they were worried about us holding the table. I will forever be grateful for this kind of graciousness. Many restaurants won't seat you until your whole party is present, and if that had been the case, we may well have lost our table for good. Thalassa is a class act!We did start to order appetizers (and some cocktails) before our friends arrived, and the amuse bouche they treated us to was delightful: tuna tartare on a cucumber slice with herbs was the perfect gateway to the meal. My husband's dolmas (with veal) were the best grapeleaves I have ever tasted. He was reluctant, because he doesn't eat veal usually, but he thought they were absolutely delicious! My SIL ordered zucchini and eggplant chips, and she thought they may have forgotten her order because everyone else's first course came out before hers, but they bring them when they are ready, and hers took a little longer, but it was a delicious thing of beauty! For my entree, I went for the only pasta I could find, and that was a lobster-pasta dish (the pasta was actually tiny pasta squares). The lobster was very good, fresh and tasty, but I had missed in the waiter's description that the sauce was tomato. I do not like red sauces, so, through no fault of the restaurant's, I was not completely happy with my entree. I was the only one at the table, though! My SIL had a HUGE, delicious filet, my brother had king langustines, our friends had the diver scallops, and my husband had swordfish, which he said was just amazing. My husband and I also shared a side order of mushroom risotto, which, served with a beautiful rose-cut relish, was very yummy! For dessert, I had the baklava, and my brother and SIL shared the special recipe of the house, the thick sheep's milk yogurt with toasted walnuts and an assortment of spoon sweets. I had a bite, and I could see why they had been thinking of this dessert all day (they'd had it before). The mix of tastes and textures was truly perfection! If you go here, please order this dessert!

4.0,11/10/2011,"What a great find in Tribeca. We stopped by Thalassa a few days ago when a Greek friend of ours was in town. We thought it would be fun to show her New York's take on Greek cuisine. Turned out to be a great choice. Dinner was excellent and the place was really quite cool.I went with the Horiatiki which is a Greek peasant salad of tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and peppers with Dodonis feta. I also got the filet mignon which came with haricot vert, fingerling potatoes, and oyster mushrooms in a rosemary demi glaze.The food was really well done. As I wrote, my app was a salad - usually a throwaway, right? But this one was really executed perfectly. The vegetables were pungent and fresh, the feta was flavorful and creamy, and it was thoroughly mixed with olive oil, vinegar, and seasoning. Simple, but you could see they put some effort into it. As for the steak, I was SO ready to be disappointed (steak in a Greek joint and so forth), but this was stellar. The steak must have been 12 oz. at least, just huge. And it was really a choice cut. It was also cooked to a t, pink inside, nice char outside. It was slightly lacking in the salt department, but nothing that wasn't remedied with a few shakes of the salt shaker. The sides were pretty good as well.I skipped dessert but the ladies went with the Ekmek which is kataifi and cream with pistachios and chocolate. They enjoyed it, but our friend noted that it was a bit different than traditional kataifi. I had the coffee which was actually quite solid.All this goodness aside, I should point out that it was extraordinarily expensive to dine here. My dinner was $90 with tip for a steak, salad, 1 drink, and 1 coffee. That's even more than we shell out at a steakhouse. I also want to mention that while the service was pretty good, we were surprised to find no maitre d' or hostess on arrival or departure. We wound up waiting like 5 minutes to check in, while the girl who was supposed to be working there was having a great time at the bar. It's really not the best policy to ignore patrons. In fact, it's really fucking irritating.In the end, I would have given this place 5 stars, but the 2 downsides sully the experience for me.

1.0,10/18/2011,"We had a Gilt certificate for drinks and apps.  When we entered, the place looked spacious and nicely decorated, it reminded me of Zaytinya in DC which is a lovely Greek establishment, so I really expected a nice time.  Alas, we were not meant to enjoy the space, as we were told our certificate only works at the bar (not a word of that on the cert itself) and we ended up seating 10 feet away from the door the entire night.  I guess it is fine, but a warning on the cert would be nice, so we proceeded to the bar where we told the bartender that we had the certificate. This news triggered something between disgust and shock in her face.  She then promptly proceeded to ignore us for at least 15 minutes.  The bar had two other couples, who were showered with attention and bartender's conversation while we waited for another 15 minutes to be served our drinks and she wasn't even busy!!!  When our drinks arrived, one of them was wrong.  She wasn't apologetic, instead she gave us an irritated up and down look and said we can keep the wrong drink, she'll make another one (um, yes, thank you, we would love to have what we ordered).  The food was ok, nothing mind boggling, drinks were fine for a Greek place, but the service was not just unattentive it was outright rude and it obviously had something to do with the fact that we had a discount. I have never been made feel so second class in my entire life!  To the managers of Thalassa - if you do a certificate program, you need to educate your staff that a point of a promotion is to attract new customers and it would be great if you treated them with at least respect.  We tipped 20% of the FULL value of the meal which I actually regret, but what can I do? I am a former waitress, I tip well. :(  Our mood ruined and still hungry, but unwilling to buy anything else at the place we walked to another nearby restaurant and enjoyed the meal and the service.  So in the end, Thalassa, I guess I am grateful for helping me discover Tamarind.  TLDR:  If you want to feel humiliated and be treated with contempt, certainly get a certificate and come to this place!  I will never return.",2,0,0,Mishkin L.,"New York, NY",0,298,76

Luckily that wasn't our case.Had reservations for 7 which weren't really necessary, the place was pretty empty. Very nice and romantic layout to the place.If you have the Livingsocial coupon, they bring you a Livingsocial menu. It's 3 choices for 3 categories; appetizer, main course, dessert. We also got a full bottle of Chardonnay. They kept it close by in an ice bucket and anytime our glasses were close to empty they were prompt to top them back off.Fiancee had peasant salad, filet mignon and some goat/sheep milk yogurt. She said the salad was eh, but the filet mignon was amazing. Even I had to agree. Her yogurt was just alright.I had the sea scallops, red snapper and baklava. Sea scallops were out of this world amazing. Whatever they topped them with really induced some flavor. Snapper was very plain but the tomato concoction that it's served with really brings some flavor out. The baklava came out with vanilla ice cream. This was honestly the best food I had our entire stay in NYC. I was laughing and smiling eating it, it was that good.Service was very friendly. Our server was barely at the table, but there's lots of younger folks working there that seem to do the footwork; refills, clear plates, etc. and they were prompt. Only downside to service is transitions between courses takes forever. I think between our main course and dessert we waited 30-45 minutes.

The service:  We ordered cocktails at the table before dinner.  The brought the wrong menu twice and finally managed to bring the correct one.  The cocktails took forever to arrive, and we were not given an opportunity to finish the cocktails before our first course arrived.  Both were cleared away at the same time, followed very shortly by the main courses.  About five minutes later, they finally got around to serving the wine.  We were never offered more wine. Dessert arrived shortly after the main course was cleared away.  Despite being rushed through the courses, we could not flag anyone down to get the check and pay when we were ready to leave.Overall:  Very disappointing.  The food was not consistent, for example my cold and not terribly flavorful seafood, and the service was awful.  Add that to the fact that they could not get the voucher right, and we won't be going back.",0,0,0,Michael B.,"Washington, DC",0,16,0

My sister had some sort of coupon that gave us a 4 course tasting menu, and every course we had was soo yummy. 2) I loved every person waiting on us. The busboys were sooo kind, and I especially loved our waiter. He's possibly the happiest man I've ever seen in my life. The only thing I found a little weird was that he said ""welcome back"" when he first saw me, even though that was the first time I've ever dined there. Either way I shrugged it off and ended up loving him. I may have expressed my love for him too loudly because he came over a little later with our desserts and put down a glass of dessert wine in front of my sister and then me and said to me ""I love you too."" I thought he had said something to my sister first, so I thought ""really smart way to get customers back"" but then my sister clarified it for me after we left... haha! 3) There was a wedding party celebrating in the back of the restaurant, but our food was still as speedy as ever! 4) The decor there is sooo nice.

5.0,7/18/2011,"I've visited Thalassa twice, and both experiences were wonderful. I first came here during restaurant week for lunch, and it was delightful. Thalassa has a year-round 3 course lunch for $24, so it's a nice deal any time of the year. The restaurant itself is beautiful--wide open spaces, high ceilings, classy yet not stuffy décor. I had the mustard greens salad to start. Initially, I thought it would be an ordinary baby greens salad + vinaigrette, but the mustard greens (small peppery leaves that look like mint leaves) really took the salad to another level. A friend ordered the pizette to start and was not disappointed; it was tasty and big enough to share.  I ordered the seafood grill kebabs for my entrée, which came with a side of unbelievably delicious zucchini. I know you're probably thinking zucchini, and yes, even the zucchini was delicious. The other entrée, the ""lravki plaki"" was a sea bass dish over a tasty sauce of olive oil, tomatoes, and onions. The dessert was not stellar, but by then, we were stuffed and only needed a nibble. The service was also wonderful, and the restaurant is quiet at lunchtime so you can have a nice, luxurious meal without feeling rushed.I came to Thalassa again for dinner recently and the service was incredible. Thalassa may be pricey, but there are so many complimentary surprises. First, an amuse-bouche (tuna tartare on cucumber); then, a small glass of dessert wine at the end of our meal. We ordered one dessert for the table (the Valrhona chocolate cake was divine), and the chef gave us another dessert on the house (baklava). Finally, on our way out, the hostess handed us each a box, which contained a small Greek cookie. Another plus is that Thalassa doesn't skimp on the portions--many of the first course dishes are huge and provide enough food for an entreee (e.g., horiatiki salad).",0,0,0,Nisha V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,47,0

Still, I would suggest investigating the wine list before going to dinner at Thalassa, unless you are familiar already with Greek wines (they also have French and American wines on the list).  Hopefully, the restaurant will put its current wine list on its website soon (the one there now is for 2009)!",0,0,0,Piper B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,3,0

5.0,3/4/2011,"Thalassa is one of the best fine dining restaurants I've so far been to in NYC. Let me explain why.Not only was the Greek food delicious, but the interior is lofty and the staff also made our visit very inviting. I had made reservations for 6:30pm on a Friday night thinking it would be necessary but turned out not a lot of people were in the restaurant. The hostess was kind enough to take my coat. My husband and I sat at the bar to enjoy the ambiance and wait until the dinner crowd came. My husband ordered beers and I had the what is considered one of the best drinks by the bartender on the menu, which was the first one on the cocktail list that starts with a 'K"" and is made with fresh raspberries. As he made the drink, I noticed he poured a lot of vodka so for me it felt like I was having two for one drinks. I felt a little buzzed afterwards. It was also nice having some cheese, grapes and pita bread, compliments of the bar.Once at the dinner table, we ordered off the restaurant week menu. I ordered the grape leaves, the lamb chops as the main course, and the hellenic yogurt cake. My husband ordered the lobster bisque, lavraki and the ekmek. The dishes were wonderful. I especially liked the lavraki, as seafood is their specialty. The wait staff was attentive during the whole time we were seated. One of the staff brought an assortment of bread for us to choose from, another waiter took our order, and another staff member took away our plates. After dessert was over, we were also given complimentary dessert wine and little finger desserts to munch on. It helped that I had a $50 Zagat voucher, as this restaurant can be a bit pricey but it's worth it for what you get and the attentive service. At the moment of walking out of the restaurant, I couldn't possibly think of any other way the restaurant could make the dining experience even better. On our way out though, the hostess brought our coats and also gave us boxes with cookies to take home. I was happily stuffed for the rest of the night.

3.0,2/13/2011,"A group of us dined here over the valentine's day weekend. We weren't sure if we would be able to get a table for 6 with short notice but there was no problem. First off the place is very beautiful and airy feeling. Usually that is what you get in tribeca with the large of factory building. The bar is so pretty with white mosica tiles. They had excellent cocktail choices (my fav agave rock) and pride themselves on their entirely greek wine selection. I am not a seafood eater so I wasnt trilled with the menu but IT IS a seafood restuarant. My only other choice was a filet mignon. It was delicious but I dont like having to be forced into the folet mignon price range wehn there is no other choice. Though the fish entrees were not cheap considering it is a type of ""steakhouse menu' where you have to order sides or you would be starving. The service was lacking I will say. Our waiter was very nice and knowledgeble but he seemed to be the ONLY waiter that we ever saw and we were seated in the larger room. He was working it but coverage needed to be better knowing it was valentine's day weekend and they woud be busy. Things like ordering took 30 mins and then after ordering getting our wine took another 30 mins. Slowing the entire dinning experience to three hours. This waiter did everything. The busboys were walking around filling water, clearing tables but not doing any repouring of wine or any of those extra things that keeps the work off the waiter. Now... our meals were good., the sides were delicious. We all wanted dessert. My cousin who is the one who selected this place because she LOVES greek food was so excited to get sme outragous Backlava but oh no they didnt have any backlava. We were told that they just recently changed the dessert menu and took it off. Ok ... so the table ordered two cheese backlavas but it was more liek a cheesecake with a little dough underit. I ordered icecream and i must say my four mini icecream cones were good. But again there woudl have been NOTHINg besides gelato that i woudl have ordered. There was nothing chocolatey or creamy or TEMPTING. Dessert menus must be tempting! and in a Greek place the desser must be greek!

I was otherwise a bit underwhelmed by the restaurant, which for the price, I feel is unacceptable.The restaurant has carefully designed decor and a very professional staff, but I found both to be a bit cold.  The staff was just not very friendly and didn't seem to provide the personal service that I expect when paying top dollar.My biggest complaint was that the food came out way to quickly.  As soon as we sat down, it seemed like a race to dessert.  Normally I would chalk that up to being picky, but my date mentioned the same to me.  Like most people I don't like to hear by date complain after I buy them a $100 dinner!The food, I also felt, was lacking.  I started with the sea-scallops.  Those were exceptionally good but everything served with them, the crust, the vegetables, and the sauce were lackluster.  They tasted bland and buttery.  The salad had some of the best feta cheese I'd ever eaten, but that was weighed down by a very lackluster tomato (and the fact that I could still taste the scallops I had only finished a few seconds earlier).Our main course was superb, whitefish (good) and langustine (amazing).  These were definitely the highlight of the meal, as they should have been.The dessert was also excellent: the baklava is really incredible.All-in-all I'm simply underwhelmed.  It's not that Thalassa wasn't good; it was.  I just felt it could have been better, especially considering how good and fresh the seafood was.Simply put: I think you can get more for your money elsewhere.",0,0,0,Matthew B.,"San Jose, CA",186,202,1

4.0,9/30/2010,"I have been meaning to review Thalassa for some time. I had my wedding there in June and they did a really fantastic job. We had the reception in the gallery loft but there are options to reserve the entire restaurant or hold the ceremony or cocktail hour in the wine cellar. The room was perfect and fit ourguests well, although surely could accomodate more if you are not doing a seated dinner. Because we didn't want our wedding to feel traditional, we opted against a sit down dinner and assigned seating in favor of a more casual approach with several hours of passed hors d'oeuvres and followed by a seafood tower and heartier foods later buffet style. We had tall cafe tables and shorter four tops as well as lounge seating arranged throughout for a more modern feel. There were lots of candles and the mood was great. The few bits of food I had time to eat were really tasty, and everyone commented that they found everything delicious and everything was replenished frequently. They also created us a specialty cocktail that was elegant and delicious but deadly. I had one at the beginning of the night but stopped soon after because I realized I was well on my way to Sloppy Drunk Brideville..The bar was very efficient and people seemed to have no trouble accessing it. Tasso, the event manager, is completely fantastic. He handled everything for us and really went above and beyond in enhancing the decor and achieving the feel that we'd hoped for. As well, the runners, captains, bartenders were excellent. They are all friendly, efficient and totally professional. A family member of mine had a small mishap and the staff (Namely, Santana) really went above and beyond to handle it immediately without anyone being the wiser. This is a perfect venue for a non traditional wedding. The food is very good, and they are very flexible to your vision. I would recommend Thalassa to anyone who wants their wedding to be relaxed but elegant, with a cosmopolitan feel. Thalassa is also a cost effective option because the restaurant itself is beautiful and needs little embellishment to look great....some candles and cocktail sized centerpieces, and we were all set. I may be biased but I think people had a great time especially because the format of an extended cocktail hour is more conducive to socializing and kicking back. You don't have to stress about who you are sitting next to or anything like that. It was exactly the type of night I had envisioned. After the reception was over, we invited our guests around the corner to the Greenwich Street Tavern which stayed open late to accomodate us. They were also wonderful and the provided just the right end to a casual and fun evening. Thalassa and its staff are skilled at executing a many types of events, but for weddings, I think they are especially a find.",1,0,0,ST H.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,42,4

Their portions are so cheap. And they are not even a fancy fine dining restaurant. WHY ARE YOU SO CHEAP?? The best part was the appetizer which consisted of 2 pieces of small black ravioli. COME ON, we pay $35, we deserve to EAT more, and be full after dinner.  I wonder, HOW and WHY did I ever come across this place.

That cold day I arrive in Thalassa and was greeted and my coat was  checked for me.  I ordered a drink and looked around and the place was beautiful!  I loved the decor... Don't be intimidated with the wine list, they can help you pare up your food with exquisite wines... With fancy table settings and the allure of this place, I felt it was going to be a fine restaurant and indeed it was... The Greeks are known for their olive and olives oils and they brought us the best imported olive puree and olive oil to dip and fresh bread... I followed it with a lightly buttery Lobster Bisque. The most creamy thing I have ever placed in my mouth... The portion wasn't large but it was just enough to open up my appetite and prepare myself for my main course.I don't remember what anyone else ordered (although I did taste everything and it was good) but I was so involved with my entrée that I wanted to savor this moment forever...  From the first bite of Lamb Shank which was slowly braised in a St. George wine sauce to the end I must admit that the room disappeared and I was alone with my Lamb... It was like I had died and gone to heaven!  It was like being on a field of daffodil with romantic music playing in the background and the lamb Shank and I slowly running towards each other... Yeah man, it was that good!  For dessert I shared with a friend... We order Balava Mille Feuille and Hellenic Yogurt...  Jesus Mary and Joseph the Hellenic Yogurt was excellent and the balava was not like the ones you find in a bakery that have been sitting out for two- three days lol...I knew these people knew how to entertain their diners when for every dish we got came with a new set of utensils... oh I like the good things in life! (Meaning not having to use the same dirty fork for everything!) hahaha  I think every restaurant should have that policy even if it isnt gourmet.For a classy fine dining expirience with scrumptious food and a superb wine list, let Thalassa take care of you!Visit Thalassa NYC and tell me what you ate! :)Good eats",4,1,2,Maritza S.,"New York, NY",64,95,98

The waitstaff usually deliver small free samples, which are presented beautifully. The decor has a sophisticated nautical feel, with subtle touches like canvass sails and teak masts on the ceiling. The slow pace of the meal also provides a rarity in New York -- tables where diners aren't rushed out the door but rather encouraged to savor their food, company and surroundings.

The best thing we had was a grilled octopus appetizer, charred and perfect-- YUMMY!The place itself is huge and airy and lovely, and there was a guitarist, which was nice. The wine list is extremely impressive and the many times we asked for recommendations, we were steered towards reasonable Greek bottles, not huge French wallet-busters. There was plenty of free stuff , too-- a molten chocolate cake dessert (with a candle in it), and a red Greek dessert wine for the table. The staff was attentive and we definitely felt cared for.Downsides: Weirdly, it took a while for our wines to come out every time we ordered (be it by the glass or the bottle).

1.0,4/6/2009,"Let me begin by saying that we decided to come back here for dinner after a wonderful experience we had having lunch at Thalassa during restaurant week.  Sadly, we were in for a disappointment this time around. We had an 8:30 pm reservation for which my husband and I showed up at 8:20, still missing the remaining two in our party.  We were shown to the bar and asked to wait for the other two, who showed up promptly at 8:30.  At this point all was well, and we were enjoying the great ambiance while sipping on some very tasty wine with some complimentary cheese that the friendly bartender offered us.  Once the remaining two of our party showed up, we let the hostess know that we were all present. We were told that we will be shown to the table shortly.  Our friends declined a drink at the bar on the assumption that we would be seated shortly and therefore would be able to get a bottle of the nice wine I was drinking at the table.  However, at 8:45, we were still by the bar, waiting. From where we stood we could see the hostess table, and the hostesses would glance over at us once in a while.  We watched others who came in after us be seated, party after party.  Some looked like walk-ins.  At 8:45 my husband went over to the hostess and asked politely if it would be much longer before we would be seated, and was told that the table meant for us was still occupied, with no explanation why a different table could not have been given to us.  He returned to our group at the bar, and we moved to the lounge area which was directly across from the hostess stand, by the entrance.  We continued being ignored there, making plans to leave and try to get in elsewhere, which, admittedly, would have been difficult on a Saturday night.  We decided that we would leave upon finishing our drinks.We were finally shown to our table at around 9:10 pm, with me having been two seconds away from going over to the hostess stand to tell them to forget it because we would be leaving.  The kicker was that no one, absolutely no one, mentioned this to us, not while we were waiting, not for the rest of our time there.  My husband and I both previously worked in the restaurant industry for many years, and we were both appalled at this.  A simple sincere apology from anyone - a hostess, our server, not to mention, a manager would have sufficed to improve our experience and to allow us to start dinner with a blank slate.  As it were, we also waited for our server for a good amount of time after being seated.  The food was alright, but not worth this experience.At the completion of the meal, having ordered coffee with my desert, I had to apologetically ask our busboy to remind the server that I had asked for coffee, after the deserts had been delivered to the table and it became apparent that my coffee had been forgotten.Of course, all those little things would not have mattered had we not been treated the way we were from the beginning.  Once we had been, every little thing stuck out and served to further spoil our evening.  What a shame.",6,0,2,Natasha G.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,2,0

I came on a pretty empty night, there was barely anyone there. Kind of liked that, the privacy and all. Although the environment was a bit disappointing. I expected the place to be more classier and club like and to be a lot bigger, a whole lot bigger. Other than that, the service was fast and friendly. We were quickly seated. I had the lobster bisque for starters. I found it to be a bit too salty. It was creamy though. As for entrees, I had the lamb chops, it was a bit burnt and hard to cut, I requested for medium rare. But still the meat was tender. I finished it off with bralak I believe, it was way too sweet. Seemed like it was drenched in sugar water or honey. My friend had the poached pear, I tried it but it tasted like cinnamon apple pie. All in all, it was a fair Greek experience, it's my first time trying Greek anyways.

4.0,11/23/2008,"I rarely make it to Tribeca, but was happy to meet some friends for dinner at Thalassa. I was the first to arrive, so I ordered a glass of the organic cab at the bar. It was a lovely glass of wine, just enough body for the blistery winter day, but not so much that I wanted to go to sleep. As soon as we were seated, there were servers seemingly at every corner of our table. Someone was pouring water, another guy was serving us bread, another guy was delivering a cute little plate of spreads (for the bread) and olive oil, and still another came to serve us a lovely little amuse bouche, a little tart of (I think) tuna tartare with a salmon cream on top. It was yummy. We ordered a white wine to go with the fish we would be enjoying for dinner. We also ordered the horiatiki (tomato, cucumber and feta salad), the raw tuna app (with shaved fennel and asparagus), and mushroom risotto. Everything was to share.The spreads that came with the bread were yummy, but perhaps a dangerously filling start. One of them was a white fish spread, another was sort of a pimento cheese spread. There were also a lovely rich olive oil for dipping, and some olives. The tomato salad was light and refreshing, which I loved. The tuna was also great, super thin slices, with light, fresh fennel and asparagus. The fish we ordered was grilled whole, then filleted and topped with capers before it was brought to the table. I kinda wished they had filleted it in front of us, I'm always a fan of that presentation. Anyway, it was nice, but nothing special. The mushroom risotto was really tasty and not at all heavy like I sometimes expect risotto to be. Service was fantastic - they served each of us the salad and the fish. For dessert, we ordered the Thick Sheep's Milk Yogurt  with Toasted Walnuts&  An Assortment of Spoon Sweets - the sweets being tiny pears in syrup, stewed cherries, and honey drenched figs. Yum! And to satisfy that sweet tooth that only recognized chocolate as dessert, they served us a little plate of fruit-filled chocolates and little bites of a slightly sweet nutty paste. I ate everything. They also gave us each a glass of a Greek dessert wine, which was similar to port, but not as thick. The service was outstanding, and though the food didn't necessarily wow me, I really loved all the little extras. So I'm giving Thalassa an extra star for giving us an all around great experience.

The decoration is white and minimalist without being overly modern, and there is an aura of class and elegance about the restaurant.It was extremely difficult to get the waiter's attention after he had taken our order (they kept our bottle of wine chilling across the aisle from our table, and it was hard to get his attention for refills--I get mad when someone comes between me and my booze), but I soon forgot when the bread with dip trio came out. I don't think I've ever eaten so much dip in my life. The olive oil dip was rich, grassy and obviously of high quality. The tomato-ey parmesany dip so gritty and tasty without being overly tomato-ey, and the bean dip was also delicious.My starter salad was simple, but excellent: feta, greens, red onions, and perfectly ripe tomatoes in a light and tangy oil-based dressing. My date got the lobster ravioli, which was delicious, but as many delicious things go, very small. I think he had exactly two ravioli on his plate. They looked lonely. But they were worth it.The main dish is where our meal went south. My skate was overly fishy, and while I enjoyed the texture and the accompanying vegetables, I found that by the time I had gotten halfway through and the fish had gotten cooler, I simply couldn't stomach any more of it. My date's lamb was good, though undercooked for medium (it came out more rare, which I can't say either of us liked).The dessert was unmemorable, but not bad, as I recall.The wine was crisp, slightly sweet but not too sweet, and reasonably priced.I enjoyed the meal and the experience and the company, but I can't say I am in any rush to return.",2,0,1,Melody H.,"New York, NY",178,286,0

It was cooked with the skin on one side(I'm not a fan of skin on fish)2. I kept pulling bones out of my mouth(does anyone like to eat bony fish??)My boyfriend ordered the lamb, which was very good, as were the potatoes it came with.  None of us ordered the skate, because we didn't know what it was or how it compared to other fish(and the waiter couldn't help us either!)As for dessert, your choices were a yogurt cake(good) or honey cake(ok).Overall, I wasn't totally impressed with the service - they were good in the beginning, but after our meal it seemed they forgot about us - we were also seated right at the bottom of the stairs, which was not the best seat - perhaps because we were eating cheaply?By the way, they've extended their Fixed Price menu until Labor Day, so you'll still be able to eat there for $35!

I had some of my partner's tomato salad (which were probably some of the best tomatoes I've ever had), Grape Leaves Avgolemono, lamb chops, and Fire Roasted Lavraki. Everything was good.

There is just something to be said when the design is simple yet elegant, and it speaks for it self. This is just how Thalassa is.This is the perfect date place as it is nicely lit dark and romantic.

It is also perfect place to go out with a few friends/ family to celebrate a special occasion like we did.Our waiter was great, even though he had a lot of tables to tend to, he made sure we were ok through out the whole night, but not in an overbearing, I need some fucking space kind of way. There is a thin line, and he did not cross it.The food is Mediterranean so expect a lot of seafood. For appetizers I had oysters, which were marvelous. The calamari was also very good. For the entree I had the steak which was perfectly cooked ( I was actually expecting it to be bad, since it was not a steakhouse. I was pleasantly surprised though.)

2.0,3/1/2008,"Service is great and attentive (granted maybe a bit slow but unintendedly so); the ambiance and decor are both elegant and inviting, beautifully modern and grandiose. Now for the food, which is basically the only component that is truly important to me, since whatever I'm paying top dollar for I shouldn't be able to cook at home. I should have cooked at home. The bread was eh, comes with an assortment of dipping sauces, I admit I'm a bread snob but this bread was just tough. We ordered the calamari which my bf loved but he loves everything. I thought it was very slimy but what do I know about calamari? Not much. I ate one and I was finished with that. The Hawaiian Lemon Snapper was like grilled fish that was cooked too long it became chicken. The Cod Croquettes were TERRIBLE!! They were so so salty, just tasted like really bad fish sticks on top of cream cheese and beets. The Wild Mushroom Risotto was also a bit too salty, but pretty good and creamy. Everything about this restaurant was impressive except the food. The food was terrible. Hence, I will not return.",3,0,3,Stacy G.,"Orange, CA",1,95,5
5.0,2/16/2008,"I cannot say enough good things about Thalassa. Went on a Saturday night with a party of 7. Thalassa is the most beautiful restaurant I have been to downtown. The decor is modern with high, high ceilings and a pre-war architectural feel to the space. The entrace bar is beautifully done in stark white with blue contrast lighting behind the bar. To the left of the bar is the main dining space done in dark wood with white curtains and white furniture. Downstairs is another dining area which is quieter and cozier. The whole space has an Ian Schrager hotel feel to it: Beautiful, artistic, simple and elegant. The food is good although expensive and the service is excellent. A great place to expense. Also a perfect date spot if you are looking to really impress a girl but, reaching for your wallet might hurt.",2,1,2,Jennifer Y.,"New York, NY",182,619,2
4.0,1/25/2008,"I went to Thalassa during restaurant week with two friends. The restaurant is beautiful. Food was great. Service was spectacular. Actually what impressed me most was the service. High end restaurants tend to be kind of snobby, but not at Thalassa. The staff was professional and made every effort so that we would 'feel at home.' (I think we may have even be told to feel like we were at home and not hesitate to ask for anything) We were seated even though our entire party had not arrived. I thought this was nice as many restaurants are strict about that kind of thing. Someone was there to answer any questions we had about the food and wine (in great detail). They gave us the restaurant week menu right away. In addition to the RW menu, there were additional appetizers offered at a discounted price, as well as a selection of wines which were half off.  I ordered from the RW menu (vine ripened tomato salad, skate, walnut cake). Portions were perfect (not too big, not too small. I left feeling satisfied without doing my usual 'plate cleaning'). I tried the other option for dessert as well (some yogurt thing), and preferred the walnut cake. There was an odd aftertaste to the other dessert. My friends had the lamb as the main course, and they both cleaned their plates. My friend even ate the beans that came alongside, and she said she is not usually a fan. Salad was fresh and even with the cheese (one chunk), it still felt light. The skate was very moist. I don't usually like beets, but I enjoyed these. The lobster sauce provided just the right amount of richness to the dish. The walnut cake was good (if sliiiiightly dry), it tasted like baklava (traditional walnut and honey flavor) but with a cake consistency instead of the crispy filo. They obviously needed the table for another party. Since we were late, I didn't mind being moved. We were moved to the bar and were comped two bottles of dessert wine as well as fruit and cheese.  I think if I was with my parents or guests I was trying to impress I would have been upset. Since we were old friends, we didn't mind. (Who would mind free booze?).  I will definitely return. Thinking about going back for V-day!",1,0,0,Sharon K.,"Brooklyn, NY",111,264,20
4.0,1/25/2008,"Another restaurant week review.  And yet another place that I think was great for restaurant week, but just not quite enough to sell me to come back and pay for it.  But this place was close.  Seemed like a good date place.  I had a ginger martini (I believe) that was fantastic.  Impressive service.",0,0,0,Job E.,"New Orleans, LA",37,142,2

3.0,7/25/2007,"Beautiful atmosphere, so-so service (hostess should have known to ask us to ""wait a few minutes"" instead of just letting us stand there, confused), good but not terrific food.  The squid appetizer was a little tough, as were the scallops in my friend's orzo.  I ordered one of the Mediterranean fishes at the suggestion of the waiter and it came a little overdone; my side of broccoli rabe was also overdone.  The filo desert w/ coffee ice cream was not as light and flaky and crispy as I've had in the past.  The oysters were very good, and the petit fours and cookies at the end were a nice touch.  Waitstaff were generally good (not put off when we didn't order bottled water or wine), but for the price, I expected better-quality food.",3,0,1,Deborah H.,"Boston, MA",246,720,0
5.0,7/21/2007,"I took my fiance here for her birthday, and we were not disappointed. She even liked it enough to want to go back every year for her birthday. We were here during restaurant week, and both ended up ordering off the prix fixe menu. The service was some of the best I've had. The portions were sized perfectly - we both cleaned our plates and weren't hungry or over-stuffed. They also started us off with a little dish of olives and some olive pate of sorts for the bread, which was delicious.  If you like wine, they have an exhaustive wine list. While they've got a great selection of fish, I decided to try the lamp chops. They were a little on the dry side, but still tasted amazing. Very nice ambiance inside as well.",0,0,0,Zach B.,"San Francisco, CA",10,30,0
5.0,5/3/2007,"Like Greek food but hate that ""Greek Restaurant"" atmospehere? Thallasa is for you! Great modern decor, and very professional staff. This is not your Uncle Georges Diner...Thallasa is hip, fun, and has amazing food! The bar is a great place to grab an early cocktail, before your night out on the town.The menu is primarily sea food, but if you knew Greek you'd figure it out....""Thallasa"" translates to ""Ocean"" in English. Great eats, good atmosphere, a meal here is like jumping on a short cruise through the Greek Isles. Stop in every so often for a celebrity sighting...I personally have seen Robert DeNiro, Harvey Keitel, and Steve Buscemi on more than one occassion.",2,0,1,Chris Z.,"NY, NY",5,15,2
4.0,4/18/2007,"Thalassa is a high end Greek Restuarant. We went for dinner and I was little overwhelmed wth the three course meal. We started off with oysters which were very fresh. The first course was actually my main meal. I had Saganaki ( Shrimp, scallops, & mussels in a fresh tomato sauce).  The halibut looked yummy but I was so stuffed! We briefly looked at the dessert menu but to be honest it looked way too rich for my liking. If you like fine greek cuisine  then try this place out. The decor is cool but it is pricey!",1,0,1,Heidi B.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",512,165,0
1.0,4/15/2007,"I never regret spending money on food. But after having dinner at Thalassa, for the first time in my life I really really regretted the $150 I spent on the meal there. The decor is beautiful. The space is really amazing and it's fantastic how they put the seafood on display to show patrons how fresh it is. But that's really the only good thing I can say about this place. You order your seafood and none of it comes with a side dish. If you don't order one of the incredibly overpriced side dishes, all you will get on your place is a piece of grilled fish. Really. Well, maybe a wedge of lemon too. But that's it. So.. we ordered a couple of side dishes.. you can't really ruin stir fried spinach so that's not worth mentioning but the risotto? Pretty much uncooked. The rice was still hard and crunchy.. and the whole thing had the taste of uncooked starchy rice. And I know you're thinking I probably don't know what properly made risotto tastes like but I do.. and that wasn't it...  The staff is really rude too. They kept trying to take our plates away when we weren't finished but when we wanted something refilled or inquiring about our order, they were nowhere to be found.. and there must have been 1 other party in the entire restaurant when we were dining. So not worth it. Go somewhere else. ANYWHERE else.",1,1,1,Bora K.,"Long Beach, CA",688,613,361
1.0,4/7/2007,"OK so the food is good but the Maitre d' is terribly rude.  Instead of informing us that there might be  a slight wait to be seated, he walked us down the stairs and into the private room, where a rehearsal dinner was taking place.  Perhaps he thought that we wouldn't know the difference but the experience overall was uncomfortable and off-putting at best.  I can't even imaging having total random strangers sitting in my private room during my rehearsal dinner.  I would be pissed!In any case, I can't recommend this place.  Nice as the decor and food are, the attitude ruins the experience.",3,1,2,Meryl C.,"Brooklyn, NY",393,408,23
4.0,4/6/2007,"Have been here a couple of times, for work events as well as lunch and dinner, and it's pretty stellar every time. The food is very tasty, and this restaurant is certainly one of the better passes at higher-end Greek food that I've seen in the city thus far. Usually, you either get cheap (but often quite tasty) gyros and souvlaki at a neighborhood stand, or ridiculously pretentious restaurant food that isn't worth half of what they charge. This is a good balance, because the food is authentic and just straight-up good, and you won't lose your shirt paying for it. The atmosphere and space is beautiful as well, very elegant and welcoming. Great date place, but can easily double as a place to bring a client for a business lunch. Kudos to the proprietors - enjoy ladies and gentlemen.",0,1,0,Ron S.,"NY, NY",13,111,0
4.0,2/6/2007,"Bravo! Beautiful place, just perfect service, right down to the host, they were so on point. They came out with a little amuse bouche that was tasty and made us excited for the rest. Then we got free babaganoush too! We ordered some spreads that were very tasty and each interesting in it's own way. The wine was a nice choice recommended by the waiter and he kept our glasses full! They have some inventive cocktails too. I had a feta, tomato and basil salad, the feta was amazingly creamy. My friend had the octopus salad and said it was the best octo she had ever had. For a main course I had the lamb chops, and my friend the fish, both above average but nothing to write home about. Skip the yogurt cake for desert, it's like a mix between cheesecake and mousse, not quite right. But get the walnut cake with honey icecream instead, now that's a unique yummy hearty desert! Then we got MORE FREE STUFF!! They came out with little boxes of almond cookies for all 5 of us on the house, not sure if it was just for restaurant week or not though. All in all very happy with the joint and will definately go back when I want upscale greek.",1,0,1,Rebecca M.,"Chicago, IL",113,21,0
4.0,1/28/2007,"very enjoyable!! the waitstaff was great, and the space is gorgeous too. I came here for restaurant week and generally the food was really great - not that the fish on display isn't a huge clue, but go for the seafood here! first the apps... I recommend the crabcakes, which were delish - they were served with giant beans which kind of seems like a weird combo but trust me they were GOOD together... my date had the grilled octopus which was simple, very fresh and grilled nicely. we also ordered the scallop appetizer was was DIVINE - the scallops were perfectly cooked and the sauce they were served with was light and delicious... for my entree, I got the skate... who knew skate would go with beets and potatoes?? but it does! the greek wines they had were really delicious, and hey how many places can you go to drink greek wine? overall, very yum! sadly, minus one star bc the desserts were kind of mediocre and bland.",2,0,1,Yee C.,"New York, NY",38,124,0

5.0,3/22/2006,"One of these days I'm going to actually go to the Mediterranean, so when I come back to the States I'll be able to tell what really takes me there and what doesn't.  When I think Greek I think wavy brown hair sitting atop a body of bronzed muscles, the smell of fish and white boats.  Thalassa had fish.  Overall the restaurant was wonderful, despite the lack of my other three requirements.  The service was attentive...but not too attentive that you would want to slap them.  Though the portions were fancy restaurant small they were tasty nonetheless and I left full.  I had the halibut steak on a bed of spinach risotto.  I loved it because the spinach was still a bit crunchy.  My only complaint was that the house wine we were served was a bit like water.  It defiantly lacked the wow factor in my book.",1,1,0,Emily I.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,156,14

The wine menu was overpriced--unless you order the moderately priced Greek Wines. Request the Wine Steward to suggest a wine from the wide selection of Greek Wines. We found our Greek wine to be surprisingly good!! This is essentially a fish restaurant --not your typcial Greek food. The fish dishes were outstanding!!!",0,0,0,Steve M.,"New Hyde Park, NY",3,528,0
