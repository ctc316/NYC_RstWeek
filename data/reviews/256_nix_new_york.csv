3.0,4/26/2019,"I expected more from a Michelin Star restaurant. The ambience was nice and the staff was friendly. The service was a bit slow and the place wasn't too crowded yet. Most of all, the FOOD was disappointing. My fiancé ordered the Bamboo rice and I ordered the Spicy Tofu dish. The bamboo rice was extremely salty and over seasoned (even if you didn't eat the bits of nori) I could not eat more than a few bites of that. The Tofu dish was spicy as expected, but also salty.  The bowl of tofu stew came with the tiniest cup of brown rice so it was very difficult to enjoy all of that stew without some bland starch to help. I've had better (and more affordable) vegan/vegetarian food from regular restaurants without the star accolade.",0,0,0,Melissa L.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,0
4.0,4/21/2019,"Great meal at Nix last night! Came in not knowing what to expect and was wowed by the creativity and flavor of the food!Started with the red pepper and walnut dip with tandoori bread and was impressed by the mint and pea dumplings. The best dish of the night was the kale and mushroom galette.Loved the eclectic menu; which covers all parts of the globe.While the pear and ginger cake was really good, a nuttier dessert would have been a great way to round out the meal!I should also mention the great service. We were asked to move tables after we were seated, and were happy to do so. The complementary dessert wine was a great way to say 'Thank you'!",0,0,0,Sanket K.,"State College, PA",1,18,6

4.0,4/19/2019,"Amazing Tandoor bread with dips, so warm and fluffy. A bit disappointed by the popular cauliflower tempura, I was expecting some kind of quality Japanese style tempura but received a failed fusion attempt overpowered by the sauce like General Tsao's chicken... Shiitake mushroom wrap is well balanced with the herbs",0,0,0,Lydia C.,"New York, NY",1,28,79
4.0,4/16/2019,"Nix is a local favorite vegetarian (but we carnivores love it too!) restaurant on University Place. The menu is incredible, making it very difficult to decide what to get, so we almost always over order.  The tempura cauliflower on sticky buns is a must. Their wine list is also quite notable. You really can't go wrong with anything on this menu. Just go hungry, and plan to drop some coin, because you, too, will likely over order.",0,0,0,Kellie B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,7,0

5.0,4/4/2019,"We have been to many of the high end vegetarian and vegan restaurants in Manhattan, had our favorites and kept going back until I found Nix. Looking for a change in venue we tried Nix. It has shot to the top of our go to places! The decor is chic, minimalist with smooth textures and comfortable ambient lighting. The wait staff was absolutely wonderful, very attentive, knowledgeable and personable. The drinks were superb. I had the Playa II tequila, passion fruit with a champagne foam...amazing! My husband had the Macha, bourbon, poached pear, apple and toasted green tea...insanely delicious! We tried quite a few dishes such as the Winter Summer Roll with marinated tofu that left us wanting more! For our Mains we devoured the Cauliflower Tempura with Steamed Bun, Pan Seared Gnocchi and the Shiitake Polenta Cacio e Pepe!

3.0,3/29/2019,"I was frankly pretty disappointed with this Michelin Star restaurant.  Our service was horrible for lunch on March 29, 2019.  Nobody even stopped by to ask us how our food was.  I could've overlooked that if the food would've blown me away.  We had the Tandoor bread with 3 dips.  The hummus was very good.  The eggplant and avocado both had an odd flavor combination and the eggplant was bitter.  The polenta fries were fine, but nothing special.  We had a mushroom soup that was very bitter.  Our best dish was the pea dumplings.  They were beautiful and had great depth of flavor.  I wish all of our dishes had been that tasty.  Our final dishes were the tempura cauliflower and hummus bowl.  The tempura cauliflower would've been much better had it been fried crispier.  It was soggy and the cauliflower was under cooked and overly crunchy.  The hummus bowl was a lack luster dish.  We left most of it sitting on the table.  I wouldn't visit Nix again.",1,0,0,Cyndee N.,"San Diego, CA",0,12,0

3.0,3/25/2019,"Nix is a fine place for a business lunch, especially for vegans and vegetarians. Overall, it was a 3.5. Nice ambiance and decent food.Three grain stir-fry, lily bulb, edamame & avocado (4.5/5) was the tastiest dish I tried. Spicy with a great mix of texture and flavors. We both had it and enjoyed it.Sweet potato and ginger dumplings, scallions, carrot* (2/5) Each dumpling had very little filling. I don't remember tasting the sweet potato at all, and the tangy sauce overwhelmed the dish. Plus the dumpling was extremely chewy.Raw veggies, red pepper & walnut dip (3.5/5) The raw veggies were crisp and the dip tasty. I prefer this a little chunkier; this dish was fairly creamy.My guest had a mushroom veloute, and liked it.I had hoped to be wowed by the food. It was solid.

3.0,3/25/2019,Was extremely excited to try the Michelin vegetarian restaurant and unfortunately a bit disappointed overall. The one dish that I definitely wouldn't recommend is the cauliflower bao buns. They were not cooked well and definitely Not seasoned appropriately. As an fanatic of burrata I was extremely impressed by the dish as it was paired with figs and pesto and extremely unique. The service was adequate and might be due to the fact it was a Friday night. I did come in with high expectations but was but disappointed in the overall meal though some dishes like the Caio e Pepe definitely stood out.,0,0,0,Rid D.,"Manhattan, NY",454,45,87
4.0,3/23/2019,"Pretty good as a vegetarian place, hits all the right notes in terms of taste. But I'm a spoilt brat who expects to be bowled over at every michelin star restaurant. That wasn't the case here.We were a group of four and ordered a bunch of dips, small and large plates. Among the dips, the hummus and romesco were really good- go perfectly well with naan. Jicama ribbons were the highlights in the small plates. Back in India we eat Jicama just by itself. That's so boring. Here they jazz up the crunchy Jicama ribbons with spicy chiles and orange pieces... delicious!Among the entrees, the spicy tofu dish was a nice take on mapo tofu, with mushrooms and kale added for extra umami and crunch. Also the cauliflower tempura with Bao buns was very tasty.Dessert was kinda meh though. We got the Tandoori pineapple which was a special. Apparently it takes 30 mins to make and we had to order it in the beginning. But I didn't find the final product too impressive. Pineapple wasn't grilled enough, so tasted kinda flat. The almond cream and macadamia nuts on top were far better.Overall, a good choice price-wise. Lot of spicy and playful flavors, but some dishes seem a bit too acidic. Worth a try though!",0,0,0,Subhabrata M.,"New York, NY",152,67,135
5.0,3/17/2019,As a non-vegan and dining with a vegan/vegetarian was completely taken by surprise with tasty entrees/main courses.  Gnocchi and shiitake mushroom dishes with creamy polenta were a hit.

3.0,3/14/2019,We had a reservation at 8pm on a Wednesday night in March 2019. The food was very good but it took forever to come out. We didn't receive our appetizer until 8:45pm and didn't receive our entrees until 9:30pm! They really need to improve service during peak hours.

5.0,3/3/2019,"This is so far my favorite vegan/vegetarian place in the city. I was there for brunch today, we were a party of 8, including kids. Our server Neev was extremely sweet. Let's start with the brunch coctails first. I ordered the Pllaya ll, it's a tequila based drink with champagne foam, omg it was soooo good, just perfect for a boozy brunch.Mimosa was average.Let's get to the food now we kind of ordered almost everything on their brunch menu.For starters we ordered the Tandoor bread with three dips. The bread was freshly made and all the three dips were amazing my favorite was eggplant.The polenta fries were good not great.My favorite was the maple French toast with orange marmalade believe me I ordered another one and it was the best ever so delicious.The tofu scramble was super good and the Patriot pancakes It was so different not sure what exactly it was should have checked with our server but had kind of coconut flavor it was gluten free and so yum.We also got the three grain stir fry with avocado and veggies and the cauliflower tempura with steamed buns. Both of them were good. Kids loved their banana muffin (gluten free). Fingerling potatoes were ordinary.And finally for dessert the chocolate mousse as a anniversary surprise for our friends. They served it with a sparkler which was too cute.Overall a great place I recommend to go in a group so you can order and try most of their dishes.Everything so different and so unique and looked so pretty perfect for my instagram blog @eathoppernycIt's a good mix of Mediterranean, American and Asian menu caters to every taste.Thanks Nix for a lovely experience.",4,0,0,Natasha B.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,18,76
4.0,2/28/2019,"Overall, a great upscale vegan/vegetarian spot. The place had a romantic setting and I really enjoyed the fruit made house sodas. The buffalo cauliflower was really great and the buns on the side were tasty. My girlfriend and I split the tofu skin dish and cauliflower dish and we were satisfied. The hummus appetizer was excellent. Service was very attentive and speedy. Just really didn't care for the tofu dish as it was pretty bland and small for the expensive price tag.

4.0,2/24/2019,"I came in at 5:15p on a Sunday. They had seats available as long as I was out by 7, and also had seats at the bar available.  The bartenders were super busy the whole time making drinks for the table. Even on a Sunday night they were very busy. Of note: the food came out super fast!I started out with the Broccoli & Artichoke dumplings. The sauce it was prepared in had a really nice flavor and the additional veggies in the bowl added great flavor and texture. Next I had the cauliflower tempura steamed buns. It was tossed in a tomato based Chile sauce. I was not a huge fan of the sauce it was tossed in. I likely would try something different next time. Next I went with the Shiitake ""cacio e Pepe.""  This had great flavors and the polenta was a nice touch to add to the creaminess.  Also of note, the pepper didn't overwhelm which can tend to happen.  I finished up with the chocolate cake. It was moist the way a chocolate cake should be. I'll give it to the avocados (though you couldn't taste them). There were a few things on the menu that I really wanted to try but didn't have space for. That doesn't happen often.

It's TBD how much excitement the menu can provide over the years, but in at least my last three visits, I have not yet exhausted the variety.+ The wine program is fantastic, and is a welcome addition that is often lacking in the particular class of vegetarian fine dining.+ The place works well for more casual brunches and fancier dinners; the setting is that peculiarly modern in-between that dresses up and down and feels unfussy.",0,0,0,Joe S.,"Plano, TX",6,147,5
3.0,2/19/2019,"Came here for a Sunday brunch with a reservation, around 12:30pm. The space is mostly white, with pockets of greenery all around, and the diners inside that day looked like vegan intellectuals (if such a thing exists). Most tables were already full by this time. We were seated and brought water and menus immediately, and ordered shortly after. The wait time for our food was standard for New York restaurants, about 20 minutes. The waiter who served our food mumbled a bit when dropping off the food, leading to confusing situation, as my husband's ordered dish resembled what I thought mine was supposed to look like. He had ordered the egg in a whole, though mine came with a whole egg, sunny side up, on top, and his appeared to have no trace of an egg, he said it was on the inside. My mad hatter pie, strangely resembling an egg in a hole, also included egg, as well as cranberry beans, cheese, pico de gallo and avocado. It was served with a light side salad. The dish was underwhelming, with little elements of flavor. Similarly, my husband did not like his dish. I had taken him here to show him that, yes, vegan food can be delightful and delicious, and worthy of Michelin stars also. But alas, I came away defeated.",0,0,0,Su L.,"Manhattan, NY",122,267,1105

The drinks were solid and creative in the way they paired spices such as tumeric and cardamom with spirits like tequila and mezcal. The burrata cheese was absolutely incredible and paired super well with the figs and walnuts. The papadum with eggplant dip reminded me of flavors from home, and the spicy tofu with schezwan sauce paired really well with the bamboo fried rice.

5.0,2/18/2019,"I came here on my birthday with my family.  It was DELICIOUS and service was good (a little slow at times, but still very professional and not bad enough for me to take off a star, especially because the food was so good :)).  Cocktails are also great.  I got The Nix, my mom got In Pink, and my sister ordered Albion -- all were really nice, not too strong nor too sugary.  And now the food (we ordered a ton because we were starving)!- Tandoor bread with smoky eggplant dip and avocado/ginger/mint dip:  bread was so delicious, nice and warm. Cooked just the right amount. Wish there was more of it since we had some dip leftover but not enough bread. Eggplant dip was great if you like smoky flavor.  I liked the avocado dip best -- the ginger/mint flavor was lovely.- Edamame: pretty standard - the pepperoni salt to go with it was a nice touch- Winter summer roll - a pretty standard summer roll. Good, but nothing too spectacular.- Ribbons of jicama- i LOVED this.  It is a pretty small/not filling dish since it's really just jicama, but it was amazing.  The chili and blood orange sauce coating the jicama was incredible and paired so nicely with it- Sweet potato and ginger dumplings -- LOVED these too!!!- Cauliflower tempura with steamed buns -- this is their signature. I liked it, but my family members def liked it more.  I think it was my sister/mom's favorite dish.- Bamboo rice stir-fry -- really great, excellent flavoring. The edamame went really nice with it. Rice was cooked to perfection- Spicy tofu dish -- SUPER spicy, so do not get it if you can't handle spice!  My family likes spice so we ordered it.  It was good!- Miso-honey avocado with black truffle -- a contentious dish.  This was possibly my favorite dish, although i love truffle.  The truffle was incredible, especially with the avocado and the daikon.  If you do not like truffle (like apparently the rest of my family), do not order it because the truffle flavor is very intense!- Dessert:  chocolate mousse (vegan) -- very good, although it would be nice if they paired it with some type of ice cream to balance the intense chocolate. We ordered the Vanilla creme fraiche so that solved the issue for us!  They also brought out a ginger cake with a sparkler on it for my birthday, which was very nice.  Ginger cake itself was just okay.Overall, an excellent culinary experience!!! I really loved all of the flavors.  We left super full!",1,0,0,Dori A.,"New York, NY",2,63,66
5.0,2/11/2019,"Having one family member who was vegetarian and that one member having a fairly important personal milestone, I bit the bullet and took the plunge into the dark chasm of Vegetarian/Vegan restaurants. I spent the whole day with the anxiety of the decision and had even more doubts when their sibling chimed in when told of the choice. And then the experience at Nix. Cocktails were well done. Perfectly mixed and each one of us enjoyed our choice. We proceeded to order and found that everything else was as fabulous and special. Now a majority of the items making up the ""lighter"" and ""bolder"" sections might not be something I would choose on a different menu, but the preparation and delivery of each of dishes was top rate and clearly why the restaurant has earned its reputation; it's well deserved for service, style and the quality of the food.In the end, there is no way I will ever discount a vegetarian restaurant as a choice and and would recommend that if you want to have an all around wonderful dining experience, Nix offers one.",0,0,0,Michael S.,"Redding, CT",0,28,3

5.0,2/6/2019,"Vegetarian Michelin restaurant that also offers a vegan menu. The food had small portion sizes but were delicious, and the cocktail menu was to die for! I'm not a vegetarian, but loved everything I tried. The experience was all around amazing and one of the more unique NYC dining experiences I've had. FOOD: -They recommended getting a ""first order"", 2 ""lighter"" dishes, and 2 ""bolder"" dishes off the menu for 2. We were starving so we got a first order, 3 bolder dishes, and a dessert instead. We honestly could have eaten more, but were full nonetheless. All in all pricey for the portion size, but delicious-Tandoor bread ($6) with spiced eggplant dip ($7): I get that this is a Michelin restaurant, and you're going to run up a bill, but the bread and dip size were pretty small. The bread and the dip were both very tasty-Cauliflower tempura with steamed buns & house pickles ($24): this seems to be one of the most popular items on the menu, which was confirmed by our waitress. It was honestly okay. I felt the tempura could have been fried deeper as it really lacked a crunch. The buns were just not good. I'd still probably try it if it's your first time coming to Nix given that they pride themselves on the dish, but I will not be ordering again-Pan-seared potato gnocchi, chard, canneli beans, crispy capers, lemon ($27): must-try! This is another one of their most popular dishes, and for good reason. It came with a measly 8 (or was it 10?) gnocchi pieces which is kind of a joke, but the sauce was to die for-Tofu-skin pockets, sweet potato, tomatillo-pepita salsa ($20): another incredible dish. It sounds kind of gross, and definitely doesn't like appetizing in pictures, but it was so delicious-Tandoor roasted pineapple and tamarind glaze, vegan whipped cream, macadamia: we ordered this because of the New York Times review. You have to order this at the beginning of your meal! Definitely worth trying as it's a super unique dessert.DRINKS:-Carnaval (cachaca, pineapple, coconut, espresso powder): literally one of the best drinks I've had in my entire life. I ended up ordering a second, which was unfortunately a little more watered down than the first. It kind of resembles the taste of Asian milk tea to me. YOU WILL NOT REGRET GETTING THIS. -In Pink (pisco, grapefruit, pink peppercorn, champagne): solid cocktail but not super memorableSERVICE:- I came here with a friend and had a reservation, but we ended up waiting 15 minutes on a Friday night. Not a big issue in NY, but not a problem I've run into at other Michelin restaurants - just something to note. -Solid overallTldr; Overall, I had an amazing experience. I will definitely be back for the drinks (!!) and to try out the other menu items. I definitely see why it's a Michelin restaurant but the Cauliflower tempura really fell short for me.",2,1,1,Peggy W.,"New York, NY",577,248,288
3.0,2/3/2019,"If NIX has a Michelin star, Greens in San Francisco should sure have one. I found the use of vegetables to be tasty, but the creations here not other-worldly or even mind-blowing. Maybe San Francisco produce has given me high expectations?Vegetables grown by monks and crafted into dishes such as the aforementioned have made me feel that rush, but here I feel the emphasis is on being 'tasty'. This would seem like a strange statement, except it's to say that when working with vegetables, I'd love at least one dish to feel incredibly creative and uplifting.The jicama ribbons were close. The form factor was lovely here, but why the creamy sauce? I understand it's chilly out, but I feel like this restaurant is catering towards traditional eaters (meat-eaters included) rather than really going for the heights it could go for. The Shitake Cacio e Pepe was a favorite, though it seemed like they were going for approval based on the abundance of mushrooms--in a base way, this worked for me.

The dessert was a tiny piece of ginger cake made with WHITE FLOUR AND SUGAR, there was so much ginger in it it was awful and we couldn't finish it.  Also the service was horrible, we asked for drinks and had to request them about five times before they came to the table.  At least the servers were friendly.  I cannot imagine how anyone could give this place four or five stars and I would not return.",0,0,0,Ellen L.,"New York, NY",13,46,0

Although I am not vegetarian, I eat pretty light fare/vegan on the regular so I was looking forward to trying out a rare vegetarian Michelin star restaurant!To start off, the experience was amazing from beginning to end. I was celebrating my move here (randomly put that in the section when making my res) and they ended up putting out a special card and giving us rosé on the house! These small touches on top of the incredible food made the entire experience so special!The food itself was ridiculously good. We ordered the tandoor bread with smoky eggplant dip, the winter-summer roll, the white carrot tabbouleh, spicy tofu, and cauliflower tempura dishes. The bread was so soft and fluffy and the dips that came w each dish were to die for! I LOVE spicy food and Nix delivered on that in each dish. The plates were all so unique and the flavors all went really well together. In addition, I ordered the ""in pink"" cocktail which was amazing! We finished off with the ginger cake which was incredible as I love ginger as well. All in all, the food was seriously amazing and our server was so helpful and great in every way.

3.0,2/1/2019,"This place was kind of a disappointment, maybe I hyped it up too much in my mind. The highlights were the sweet potato dumplings and the mousse cake.Started out with some Housemade Sodas:Pear & cardamom and Blackberry & juniper. I liked the first one better, it was more refreshing.For Restaurant Week, I got as my first course the Sweet potato & ginger dumplings, scallion and carrot (vegan) - the dumplings themselves were tasty, but the sauce was too salty and there was too much of it. My companion ordered off the regular menu the Tandoor bread and House hummus with zaatar - he had this made vegan. The bread was quite nice, fluffy without being too soft to put the hummus on. The hummus itself was average. Our server told us that this used to be an Indian restaurant and they still have the tandoor oven, which is why the bread was so good.For my second course, I went with the Shiitake 'cacio e pepe' with haricots verts and creamy polenta - I guess this is good if you love mushrooms, but I'm not much of a fan (there were a LOT of mushrooms). The polenta was tasty, but not as creamy as I would have liked.My other companion got the Chayote squash milanese with celery root gribiche and bitter greens - had a bite of the squash, and it was nice and crisp without being too tough.For dessert, which didn't come with the RW lunch, I had the Nun's puffs with peach/passion fruit and white chocolate/cinnamon dips. The puffs were actually nice and soft, although I would have liked more browning. The dips were just meh, but the puffs actually go really well with the dessert my companion had:Chocolate mousse cake, passion fruit, amaro (vegan) - at first, I didn't like it, but after a while, it grew on me. Probably shouldn't eat anything sweet before this.

The skin is a bit too chewy for me. The Squash Milanese is really strange, the squash being overly salty and the breading constantly falling off.

4.0,1/26/2019,"TLDR - order the gnocchi, it's heavenly.Overall a lovely vegetarian dining experience. The restaurant itself had a warm ambiance, with minimalist decor and lots of plants. Coat check was a definite plus, and I loved the half-booth seating. The only ""cons"" (which weren't huge cons) is that I would say service was just ok, and the table/space was overall a bit cramped. My chair kept getting bumped by staff passing behind me, and the table was a bit small for all the plates/waters/drinks. That being said, the staff were very diligent about clearing the tables of empty glasses and plates on a regular basis. The food was all very good. You can't go wrong with the Burrata (although can you ever go wrong with Burrata?) and the tandoor bread was nice and hot. The real stars of the show were the sweet potato & ginger dumplings, and the gnocchi. Both were stellar, and I'm still dreaming of that gnocchi.",1,0,1,Kristian B.,"Boston, MA",84,161,132
2.0,1/25/2019,Two stars because the service was good.  Take one look at this photo.  A Michelin starred restaurant that can't bother to make a gluten free menu.  They cross off the items that contain gluten and write gluten free on top.  Really?  At these prices?  And the tofu skin pockets (which happened to be delicious) had a carrot garnish.  Runner brought the dish and said carrots on the side -didn't say why and who would think they had gluten? But yup chef chooses to use soy sauce instead of wheat free tamari but I didn't know that until after I had had some....   why wouldn't they use tamari.  Thankfully one of the guests at the table didn't have any as she's celiac.  The tofu dish on the menu is also not gluten free because of soy sauce.  Maybe chef doesn't know that tamari is GF?   Here's a suggestion for the menu.  Put a Star next to the gluten free items and then on the bottom of the menu do this:  *Gluten Free.   I will acknowledge that the aquafaba whipped cream on the made to order pineapple dessert was the best whipped cream I've ever had.   Second time here.  I don't believe I'll  be back.  Very Expensive for fair food and small portions.  I don't have an issue with small portions but I do when the food isn't superb....  the Michelin Star is for what?,0,0,0,benay v.,"New York, NY",0,3,1

We devoured the delicious bread - it was so delicious that we ended up putting away 3 orders of it. The roasted red pepper dip was a fan favorite.

3.0,1/21/2019,"This is a 3.5 star review, with a few things holding it back from being a 4 star review.  Neither 3 or 4 really feels right, but I had to choose an option.Nix's veg-fine-dining appeal is a very interesting promise, but for me the execution didn't follow all the way through.  The food:* The tandoor bread with eggplant dip was basically just a standard babganoush thing.  It was fine, but not really exciting or interesting/unique* The Winter/Summer roll was similar - tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary.  A very standard spring roll with veggies* Sweet potato and ginger dumplings - pretty good.  Tasty but again just pretty good, not VERY good.* Kale gallette - my wife enjoyed this a lot.  I thought it was quite good.* Cacio e pepe with shiitake, green beans and polenta - this was the standout dish of the evening.  This was very, very tasty.* for dessert we had a ginger cake and vanilla bean mousse.  The ginger cake was mediocre, like most vegan baked goods.  They never taste quite right because they can't use milk, eggs or butter.  The vanilla bean mousse dish with some chilled fruit puree was very good and I enjoyed it a lot.So overall the food experience was a bit mixed.  Most of the items were good, but only a few had any pop or 'wow factor' to them.  Given that Nix is likely a $100 per person experience with a few drinks, a reasonable person will hold them to a high standard.  I had a good meal, but it wasn't an amazing meal that I thought blew me away for the price point.In addition, the service was unexpectedly very spotty.  The service, when it was being provided, was extremely professional and was high quality.  It's just that it *wasn't provided* at times.  My party of two had two separate drink orders simply never appear.  Then we had the request the check multiple times, after being forgotten the first time.  Then the drinks we had ordered but not received were on the check. It didn't ruin the meal or anything, but it was just a bit frustrating.So I settle on 3.5 stars here.  Nix is a good meal and has some very good food, but I'm not sure that the experience lived up to the price point given that many dishes were just ok and the service was spotty.",1,0,0,Danny O.,"Manhattan, NY",12,139,0
4.0,1/20/2019,"As a life-long vegetarian, I was really excited to dine at NIX, it being one of the vegetarian Michelin-starred restaurants in the city (no idea why I hadn't been sooner).So, I walked in on a freezing Sunday night without a reservation and the hostess was ready to have me seated at the bar in a few. But before things could get into motion, two new patrons walked in and created an awkward situation which made me decide to pass on dining here altogether - I immediately booked my cab to another place. As I was waiting outside, the hostess popped out to ask me back in and have me seated at a table that just opened up. I thought she was incredibly gracious in this situation and agreed. So, finally seated and at a table, my waitress kindly helped me with the menu, and I placed my orders. 1) Tandoor bread with Hummus & Zaatar: The buttered tandoor bread was good, soft but slightly crispy on top; and the hummus was smooth and flavorful.2) Burrata with Truffle pesto, figs & walnuts: I love burrata and this was an excellent take on it with interesting well-balanced flavors and textures - rich creaminess of the burrata, the crunch from the walnuts & the sweet figs, and the savoriness & umami of the truffle pesto. Would definitely order this again! 2.5) Sweet potato ginger dumplings: I didn't order this dish myself, but the hostess had it sent to me on the house and I was glad that they did. I love Asian food and absolutely love my dumplings, and this dish fared quite well - delicate dumplings with a tasty filling and a sharp vinaigrette to go with it.3) Cauliflower tempura & steamed buns: This was a DIY bao with the fixings all provided to you separately - the cauliflower tempura slathered in sauce, warm pillowy buns & pickled vegetables. This dish fell short of my expectations though. I found the sauce on the cauliflower tempura to be a big letdown with its generic barbecue flavor. I would've appreciated flavors of garlic / ginger / scallion or some kind of acidity (which the pickles provide, but not quite enough) - just anything other than bbq! It was an alright dish, but could've been way better. I passed on dessert given how much I was ordering for just one (haha!). Service was prompt with courses arriving perfectly spaced out. The staff were all kind and seemed well-trained. I must give a shout-out to both the hostess, Edie, and my waitress, Sydney - both of them so warm & cordial. Overall, an experience that I would recommend to members of the vegan / vegetarian community.",1,0,0,Uma G.,"Charlotte, NC",56,11,29

We finished with the nuns for dessert which were so light, they dissolved in our mouths. Vibe in the restaurant was exactly what I look for on a weekend night in the city. Great lighting and perfect music. The only thing that I felt was a little off was the slightly slow service, but we were in no rush.

1.0,1/20/2019,"I don't typically leave reviews but this was warranted. Particularly for a Michelin star restaurant, I expect better. Let me start with the good -- service was excellent. The food sufficed if you were hungry, which we were, but frankly I went home and ate a second dinner. - At $22, I expect Burrata to be served at the appropriate temperature and to be served with something to capture its lovely gooey factor. Eating Burrata that is still a little too cold with a spoon is not inventive or original, it's just nonsensical. Also there was zero truffle flavor. - Cauliflower tempura could have been a true star, but the cauliflower to bun ratio was way off. The cauliflower is very sweet. In making this an entree size, someone decided to present half a plate of cauliflower. Now, each of the 4 steamed buns presented holds approximately one floret of cauliflower and one pickle. The buns ran out way before the cauliflower, which is too cloying to eat on its own, and the pickles followed soon after. As with the Burrata, I was left wondering why the accompaniments hadn't been thought through from the diner's perspective. - Gnocchi was a butter bomb. I like butter but it shouldn't be the only flavor note present. - The only thing that seemed appropriately scaled and served was the apple salad. Tasty, though small for sharing. Noise was pretty high, no space for coats leaving folks cramped between tables, but overall very attentive service. Won't be returning or recommending.",0,0,0,Jennifer P.,"Brooklyn, NY",85,8,0

5.0,1/14/2019,"Nix has had a HUGE improvement in the last couple years, which earned it a Michelin star. Totally deserving of it!The dips are all amazing - especially with the tandoor bread which is super soft and fluffy. Must try at least a few of the dips.Everything on the menu though is excellent. The food in general has a special Asian flare, and is relatively healthy. The sweet potato and ginger dumplings are delicate, with none of the flavors overpowering each other. The burrata was one of my favorites - so creamy with the fig adding a bit of sweetness. The gnocchi is perfectly chewy. The shiitake cacio e pepe is a heavy (but extremely delicious and satisfying) dish, so beware! The spicy tofu with chanterelles is thick and saucy - to me, it was an interesting spin on the traditional Chinese dish Mapo Tofu.The cauliflower tempura is a bit overrated. It is one of the most popular dishes on the menu, but there is not enough flavor to go with the steamed buns it comes with. Will definitely be coming here again to try the remainder of the dishes.

The inside has a small bar in the front and tables to the side and back. Not a huge restaurant but not tiny either.We started with the Tandoor bread with red pepper & walnut and labneh & marinated cucumbers. The bread was okay, kinda tasted like a wheat pita bread. The dips were delicious however. The red pepper dip was a little sweet and the labneh was a little like a smooth cream cheese taste. For my main meal I got the Shiitake ""cacio e pepe"". It was a small dish with polenta on the bottom, green beans in middle with shiitake mushrooms on top. The shiitake mushrooms on top were delicious and had a ton of flavor. The polenta on the bottom however was pretty bland and tasteless.

That's something I've never seen before."" And I was there too lol. But personally, it didn't taste like something so unexpected or anything in that matter. It was interesting how they combined different cuisine, like for instance the cauliflower tempura with steamed bun was an interesting idea, and that dish was very flavorful but after few more bites I got bored. I've been to other Michelin star restaurants but ehhh the portion is small relative to their price. If the food is gonna be pricey, I expect either to be in a 'meal-worthy' portion OR to be flavorful and good but Nix kinda failed to do either one. Especially the avocado dish I had should've been an appetizer. Ya. I don't understand how that end up in the bolder section of the menu.

Miso glaze avocado with truffle.  I get that this dish has black truffles on it, but it's half an avocado and is $28.  It was good and definitely interesting, but I would probably skip it if I came back.I'm not a vegetarian, but I did enjoy my overall dining experience. It was filling but I felt healthy.  I'm not sure if I'll come back anytime soon, but worth it to come give it a try.",1,1,1,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634
3.0,11/6/2018,"Came here for my husband's birthday dinner. We opted to do the chef's tasting menu. Having done other tasting menus at other restaurants, we were not impressed. We were told it was 4 savory and 1 sweet course, however I wouldn't consider bread and hummus dip a course ... thats like chips and salsa! We has hummus with naan, summer rolls(somewhat bland but the green dipping sauce was great), tofu skin wraps (really flavorless), and an eggplant curry with lentils (lentils definitely needed more seasoning).The flavors were somewhat bland. Some dishes could have used different flavors, and perhaps more seasoning. I was also disappointed the dessert course was 2 of the same item- usually tasting menus give you 2 different desserts so you can share and try 2 things! Was not a fan of the dessert- it was a weird ginger flavored cake. Will likely not return. We have been to other vegetarian/vegan restaurants like Blossom and Candle 79 and the food is way more flavorful and creative.

The sauce that comes with it pairs well.The cocktails were refreshing and we ordered tandoor bread with some dips which was not memorable.

4.0,9/5/2018,"A great upscale restaurant near union square, Nix specializes in vegan and vegetarian fare. While in truth this is not typically my jam, I have to say the restaurant is beautiful, the dinner menu is interesting, and the craft cocktails are especially delicious. With a focus on shared plates, the mezzes/ Mediterranean small plates are a great option for starters. As far as more substantial main courses the cauliflower tempura and seasonal vegetarian dumplings are well worth trying. The ambience is very romantic and clean, from the natural drift wood light fixtures, clean colors, semi exposed kitchen under half open Venetian blinds and a cascade of shelves plants, the aesthetic makes for an inviting modernist combination.",0,0,0,Rachel E.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",166,21,17
3.0,9/2/2018,"I went to Nix with 5 friends, and we were seated at a cozy booth. Note: only two people in our party were vegetarian while the rest of us were not. The ambience itself was probably better for a date than for a group of friends, but it was pretty loud in the restaurant so being in a group was no problem.The pros were the drinks and the majority of the food. We all ordered cocktails, and they were all well done, ranging from girly cocktails to your bourbon-based concoctions. All of them were stronger than expected (although you couldn't really tell until they were finished).The food was pretty good. I would suggest to NOT order the avocado focused dishes. We ordered the half naked avocado and the miso avocado, but they both might as well have been half an avocado on a plate with nothing else. Even with additional ingredients, they were just so bland... The egg salad was much more basic than expected - it was essentially boiled egg with potato crisps on top. Another issue was the fact that there are so few pieces of food in each dish (e.g. 5 pea dumplings in the dish, 8 pieces of gnocchi in the pan seared gnocchi dish). However, everything else tasted really amazing. We loved the dips, especially the labneh and the eggplant, and make sure you order the tandoor bread (naan) with it. The burrata was very nice for the summer. Although the English peas had very few pieces, the dish was packed with flavor (the wrappings could be thinner, though). Definitely order the cauliflower tempura - it's one of the best dishes we had that night. The pan-seared gnocchi is a must-order as well (you might want to order two of them if you have more than 2 people). One other aspect of the restaurant that may have indirectly affected our experience was our waitress, who never smiled at us at all. She had a very matter of fact attitude, but she did answer our questions about how many dishes to order.I'd probably come here again, as long as I don't need to eat the avocado dishes again.",0,0,0,Lu Y.,"Chicago, IL",147,86,42

2.0,8/30/2018,"After returning, I'd have to say this place is hit or miss, and service is just ok - depending on how much your waiter guides you in the menu, you can either have a great or an ok meal. During my second experience here, we had two bolders that were just awful. The cauliflower tempura was covered in a soggy breading and sauce that recalled cheap chicken wings at the local college town pizzeria, and the ""spicy tofu"", which was more or less poorly done mapo tofu, was virtually inedible because it was so spicy. The side of soggy (literally, swimming in a pool of water) ""fragrant rice"" did nothing to help, and we didn't finish the dish. All in all, I felt we would have had a better meal in Chinatown when it can to the bolder dishes, and at $28 for tofu and $16 for tempura, I expected better. Not at all deserving of a Michelin star restaurant. I felt pretty disappointed and I probably won't be back.",1,0,0,Hui C.,"Manhattan, NY",326,291,131

1.0,8/15/2018,"Their menu seems to cleverly put together veggie/vegan flavors from different cuisines. Seems to, because in practice they've optimized for chic preciousness over taste. The dips are pretty nice, I'll grant. But then dips are generally hard to screw up.Everything else was simply dreadful. The egg salad was dismal, it was pretty much an egg with some mayo type thing on top. Bewildered that a restaurant would serve so insipid a dish, we speculated that the egg might be a vegan imitation, consoling ourselves that if so that at least was well done. No, the egg is real. They put some goop on top. Yippee.They also have a cauliflower tempura, which is pretty much a bad gobi manchurian served with bread. And there's this tomato soup that tastes like dish water. Oh, and be warned off their ""special dessert"" which is pineapple. This dish has as its sole virtue that of truth in advertising. if you're suckered into getting it, they will place before you a large plate with half a pineapple on it, softened by heat, with cream on top.I found out during the meal that this place has a frickin Michelin star.

Then you have the highly recommended Cauliflower tempura which had an overwhelming gloopy and saturated barbecue sauce that masked any other flavors of the vegetable. It really was worst then any dish you would find in a mass produced Chinese buffet.  We order 2 nice appetizers: red peppers & walnuts and Labneh cucumber and then 1 order of Papadums to scoop up the dip.  The Papadums where about 1.5"" in diameter and so few in the dish we had to order another to finish the 1/2 eaten dips.  Of course we were charged $6 twice for about 10 little crackers.",1,0,0,B B.,"Rye, NY",0,8,0

The gnocchi and polenta were good but a little too heavy/creamy. The schezwan tofu was pretty spicy but good flavor (tofu a little too soft for our taste). The cauliflower buns sounded great but were pretty bland and flavorless, also had a weird taste in the batter and some were so overcooked we couldn't chew it.

5.0,7/18/2018,"Thank goodness for Nix. Seriously. As a vegetarian, I have noticed that there is a SEVERE lack of high end delicious vegetarian options out in the world. Do chefs think we don't want well made delicious vegetarian entrees? Do chefs just think, ""oh well you're a vegetarian. You truly only eat pasta, veggie burgers, grilled vegetables (mostly eggplant), grilled vegetables on pasta, and....that's it."" No. I love food. I love well made food. I love well put together dishes with flavors that compliment each other and are complex and wow me just like every other person who loves food. Chefs don't seem to think we do. Frankly, it's lazy.But then in comes Nix. I have been dying to come here ever since I heard it opened but have never been able to get a res during times that worked for me. Finally, I tried to get one during the summer when people are away and voila! My friend and I started with the burrata with charred marinated tomatoes and the naked avocado with smoked crepe fraiche and chili oil. Burrata is always a good choice and this was no different. An actually good sized burrata and the tomatoes went PERFECTLY with it. Such great flavor. The avocado was so interesting! The freshest avocado with a smokey creme fraiche was so unique. I have never had a Smokey creme fraiche before but the flavor matched perfectly with the avocado. We got the morel ""Cacio e Pepe"" and the turnip risotto. This was a really hard choice because truly everything on the menu looked outstanding. I have never been in a situation before were all the choices were available to me and I was loosing my mind. We weren't going to share originally but decided it was probably just the best course of action. My god was this food good. The complexity of all the flavors that all paired perfectly together. I can not rave about this meal enough. My god was it good. This is what I have been waiting for as a vegetarian. My mouth is actually watering right now just thinking back to this meal.

3.0,6/24/2018,"Favorite of the night was actually the avocado mint dip. Like a way better version of guacamole, served with their bread, which was like naan. Second place goes to the pea dumplings (so flavorful and tasty though also very tiny so goes super fast and is truly an app) and the mushroom polenta (very filling). While in usually a fan of beets, I didn't love the way the roasted beets were prepared, and felt the various textures of that dish were a bit confusing when combined. And then the cauliflower tempura that everyone talks about was a cool concept, but tbh I felt like there wasn't enough flavor, even with whatever sauce they provided with the dish. The buns were clutch though. Love those types of buns (basically same white bun you get for pork belly sandwiches at ramen spots). I had a hard time deciding if this place was a 4 or 3 and ultimately settled on 3 because the drinks we had weren't that great either (wines by the glass and cocktails were mediocre).

1.0,6/19/2018,"Wonderful MenuExecution of the ideas fail.Shiitake Mushroom wraps the mushrooms to chunky to wrap.  4 lettuce leaves were not enough.  Mint was old and wilted! Shiso leaves were old and had brown bits.  Jicama sticks were rubbery not crisp.  Fail on the whole dish.English Pea Dumplings were chalky and wrapper hard and too thick.  I tasted no ginger, ONLY VINEGAR LOTS OF VINEGAR, so much my mouth puckered from over use of vinegar.   basically bland and boring and horrible texture.  Worst was cauliflower tempura  Buns , which no where on menu or from servers description was it told that it would be covered in a sweet sour thick tomato sauce which made tempura soggy and like a stew.  We thought it would be tempura as described on menu??? NOT.  Again only 4 tiny buns to put the stewed cauliflower in and should of had 8 buns to be able to eat all the stewed cauliflower..  the sauce  should of been on side.  No where was it mentioned it would be drenched in sauce.  My guest has a sensitive digestive issue and can not eat tomatoes.  The waitress was cold, uneducated on menu.  She was rude from the moment we asked for lemons with water.  For the prices in this restaurant service does not at all reflect.  Still sitting at table they removed water carafe and we had 1 empty glass and never replaced our waters  than someone ended up taking my water glass completely without asking if we needed more water. We were excessively thirsty from salty sweet cauliflower stew that was SUPPOSED to be Tempura.  This whole place was a fail.  Kinda dirty restaurant needs a new paint job as around the edges its dirty.Way way way overpriced.

3.0,5/28/2018,"All vegetarian menu or a vegan menu with a mix of Mediterranean/Asian /Italian inspired dishes. Very accommodating for vegans. This place also has one Michelin star so was very excited to try for dinner. However the high prices were not reflected in food quality or creativity. Most of the food items you could find elsewhere for cheaper, similar/better quality, and bigger portions. Was expecting more interesting dishes from a Michelin star restaurant with such high prices. Tandoor bread and red pepper dip: Bread was ok but basically a drier, smaller Naan bread from an Indian restaurant, red pepper dip was good but similar to store bought red pepper hummus. Candied walnuts made this slightly different.Spicy Tofu: Best dish with biggest portions of the items we got. Similar to a soft tofu curry with a mix of greens and veggies. Was mildly spicy. Well seasoned but nothing you couldn't find at a korean/chinese restaurant for 1/3 the price.Gnocchi: Very small portion. Filling tasted like slightly sour mashed potatoes. Bamboo rice: Got this without egg so maybe it impacted taste. But was bascially a bland fried rice.",5,1,1,Sind P.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",205,47,122

While apparently waiting for other diners to finish, a table was empty right in front of us, which we eventually got. The host and the server seemed vague, tired, and frankly bored, and the menu choices were rushed through and not explained properly. The food was average, un-subtle, not beautifully presented, and I'd say only on a par with somewhere like Wagamama in taste.

3.0,5/2/2018,"First off I want to say that based on my last meal, I would give Nix a 1/5. I've had dozens of meals at Michelin starred places and my brunch on Sunday was easily the worst I've ever had. Because we really liked our previous two meals a lot (both food and service), I thought a 3/5 was fair. We went with a few friends for brunch this past Sunday and it was actually pretty embarrassing that we had been talking Nix up as every facet of the meal was incredibly disappointing. Atmosphere: very loud which would be fine except our waiter had an incredibly soft voice. It was almost impossible to hear him and even though we did get everything we ordered, he did mistakenly not box up my leftovers. Service: took almost 10 minutes for anyone to come to our table. Our server was a tall guy who, as I mentioned before, spoke so quietly that he couldn't be heard. One of us asked about a dish and his answer was so quiet we couldn't even hear it. We didn't see him after ordering until flagging him down for the check and asking him (we thought) to box up leftovers. Easily the worst service I've ever had at a Michelin starred restaurant. Food: We ordered three appetizers (dip trio, red pepper dip and polenta fries) and four mains (cauliflower tempura, beet burger, monastery breakfast, pancake). 1. Dip trio -- we had tried this one before: the eggplant dip was as amazing as ever and the hummus was completely serviceable per normal, but the avocado dip was somehow blander than just eating an avocado. The tandoor bread was also overly charred -- a third of it was inedible. 2. Red pepper and walnut dip -- first time we have tried this one: the dip was a bit too sweet but the veggie crudités were delicious. 3. Polenta fries -- my wife's favorite item: they still tasted good but they were room temperature when we got them. 4. Beet burger -- first time: it was lots and lots of beet (a patron next to us returned hers after one bite) but I like beets so that wasn't a problem. That said, the bun disintegrated after two bites (and that's after I cut it in half as there would have been no way it wouldn't have fallen apart). It's basically a beet and horseradish salad crammed into a bun. Don't think I would try it again. 5. Monastery breakfast -- also new to us: it was literally six slivers of roasted vegetables, half a cup of completely unseasoned brown rice, four pickle slices and a small bowl of almost inedibly salty miso soup. It's sort of an insult to the restaurant itself to even have that on the menu and even more of an insult to charge 18 dollars. I hope it was envisioned for either sedentary monks or monks who lived near Golden Corral to eat lunch there as it was maybe 300 calories worth of food. 3. Pancake -- literally one really tall pancake with a smattering of blueberries. Decent but 14 dollars for a pancake? 4. Cauliflower tempura -- my favorite item from previous meals: it absolutely had been sitting before making it to the table for at least 5-7 minutes. It tasted like gloopy Chinese buffet food as the sauce had congealed by the time it was served. Kind of a complete disgrace that, again, a Michelin starred restaurant would actually serve something that tasted worse than Cafe Duke's pay by the pound buffet in Midtown.

My daughter had a cocktail with grapefruit juice, I don't remember the name. We both decided we ordered perfectly.What I really wanted, but didn't have, was the tempura cauliflower. It looked amazing, but I didn't want the tempura calories. But I can't stop thinking about it, so I will return and order it. I was very happy with the Beet Burger. It's actually a beet on a bun, but so so good. And I'm not the biggest beet lover in the world! They made the horseradish sauce vegan. The bun and cucumber and the sauce together made this a perfect choice. My daughter had the three grain stir fry. It was kind of small, but I tasted it and it was delicious. She said after eating it, she was satisfied.The dessert menu was limited, so we opted to go find her favorite vegan ice cream place.Service was great.

4.0,4/11/2018,"NIX is a gorgeous, chic restaurant and is perfect for vegetarians, vegans, and even meat eaters!We did the ""Garden Walk"" lunch ($36 pp) that consisted of 5 courses:- tandoori bread with three dips (eggplant, hummus, guacamole type avocado dip) all three dips were great and the bread was delish!- their take on a split pea soup topped with an unfamiliar herb and some fresh peas. I enjoyed the soup, but felt it was one dimensional for a michelin starred restaurant.- small tortellini/dumpling like pastas with a very vinegar-y broth... it was enough on the bottom of the bowl to be mistaken as broth and when I took a spoonful, I was unpleasantly surprised but the pastas were very tasty!- my favorite was the tempura sweet and sour cauliflower that came with build-your-own bao buns, kind of banh mi style. A little spicy for my palette but very good when combined with the creamy sauce given.- the dessert was a spread of vanilla bean custard/cream/I dont know topped with some macerated fruit. While it was good for what it was, I'm a HUGE dessert person so needed to go get some ice cream after this. This restaurant has a nice ambience, good service, but for a michelin star it left some to be desired. We came towards the end of lunch service so our meal felt rushed (they put our next course down while we were halfway through the one before).

3.0,4/8/2018,"I had really high expectations for Nix, but was unfortunately pretty disappointed in the whole experience. The main issue is that the restaurant lacks cohesiveness. There's no theme or defining characteristic. The ambiance is clean, intimate, modern, albeit quite plain and minimalist. The food was the biggest disappointment, however, and that's largely because it lacked flavor. The spiced eggplant dip could have used a pinch of salt or something to kick it up. The dumplings were average and the accompanying radishes and broccoli didn't bring anything to the dish. The cauliflower tempura wasn't bad; it had a nice crunch, but again the chosen pairing of basil and radish didn't do much. We really enjoyed the fried cactus, but were not a fan of the veggies on top. It just felt like a strange hodgepodge of cuisines that didn't belong in the same meal. There were Indian flavors in the tandoor bread and eggplant dip, Southwestern flavors in the cactus, and Asian flavors in the tempura and dumplings. That's the biggest gripe I have with vegan/vegetarian restaurants - a lot of them will try to cook everything under the sun instead of sticking to one cuisine and doing that really well. Clearly there are talented chefs working at Nix, I just wish they would narrow their focus. It could really bump up their game.On the bright side, I really liked that you can get sparkling water instead of tap at no additional cost.

2.0,4/5/2018,"Nix was honestly one of the biggest disappointments of my New York trip. I had a free night on my own so I decided to make a reservation after reading some reviews and checking out the menu. A few days ahead of time I received a voicemail asking to confirm my reservation and when I called back it took nearly 10 minutes for them to find it. It was also listed for 2 people when I'd originally booked it just for 1.I was seated quickly when I arrived but the hostess didn't bring me a menu. I waited for quite awhile before my server brought it over. She let me know the best options for solo dining before walking away. I decided on a drink and took a look at the food menu. Again, I waited for a comically long time. When she finally came back, she didn't ask if I had a drink order so I ended up ordering everything all at once. The drink arrived quickly and my food soon followed. This was honestly a bit disappointing as it would have been nice to have a pre-meal cocktail. After my food arrived, I didn't see my server again until I had to ask the man filling my water if I could get my bill. I would have loved to have had a 2nd drink but she never came by to see if I wanted one and never checked in to see if I was enjoying my food. After waiting for nearly 30 minutes, I gave up and decided to call it a night. I don't know if this level of service is standard for Nix or if they were having an off-night, but it was disappointing to say the least.While the service at Nix was underwhelming, the food and drinks were fantastic. I honestly can't stop thinking about the Honey Bee cocktail. It made my lips tingle (in a good way) with every sip. For my meal I had the cauliflower tempura with steamed buns. The dish was served with homemade pickles on the side. I was really impressed with the combination of flavours. While the cauliflower was hot and spicy, it was offset by the sweeter buns and tangy pickles.

Normally if I saw a dish advertised as tofu and mushrooms I would think it would be sort of boring but it was cooked perfectly with the perfect amount of spicy accompanied by rice which happened to make it incredibly delicious.The tempura fried cauliflower was very good as well, accompanies with buns, the flavor was unexpected on a dish that appeared basic.

4.0,3/25/2018,"We were very excited to hear of this one Michelin starred vegetarian restaurant (not vegan, but totally OK because I dig dairy). During the weekday, it was a non-issue to get a reservation fairly last minute. The restaurant was quaint and not pretentious at all. We were seated quickly and provided a menu. What was really nice about our lunch was the freedom to choose between the prix fixe lunch menu of  6 (yes SIX) courses (including a dessert and a soup). Since my wife doesn't eat that much (sometimes), we were given the option for me to do the prix fixe and for her to order a couple items from the a la carte menu.6 course Prix Fixe $36/pp1. Tandoor bread with three types of dip (smokey eggplant, hummus, and avocado)...the only dip that stood out was the smokey eggplant. Great texture, flavor, and depth. Tandoor bread was descent. Served with endives which made a great spoon for the tip as well. 2. Egg salad with habanero cream and potato crispies...really loved this dish. Simple yet very flavorful, the crispies were a basic idea but added a lot of nuance to the habanero cream which was delicious 3. White asparagus soup (small, more like a palate cleanser)...I think this soup was only OK. A bit too tart and the asparagus slices were slightly bitter. I just thought of it as a palate cleanser 4. Delicate broccoli dumplings...for an Asian dude, these were not bad at all. The broth was light and soy sauce-based. Executed well, actually, with nice radish garnishes. 5. Cauliflower tempura with steamed buns and house pickles...similar to Gobi manchurian, but with an obvious Asian spin with the buns. Side note, our first set of buns (baos) were tough and hard, had to send them back for a redo set, which were then fine. 6. Dessert: citrus fruits supremed with mint and creme fraiche, olive oil...absolutely delicious and a perfect end to this meal, with elements of tartness, sweet, cream, herb (mint) to balance it all out. Wished it was served in a bowl rather than a plate, though. A la carte 1. polenta fries with dill and creamy feta (detected meyer lemon zest on top as well) - absolutely delicious but would definitely share with 1-2 other people as 2-3 pieces is enough2. Shiitake mushroom lettuce wraps with hoisin sauce and thai chili The service was average, nothing special. Not sure if being a Michelin star restaurant their service should be more ""tight"" but then that would just add more pretentiousness to an otherwise pleasant and enjoyable lunch experience. Lastly, regarding the Asian inspired dishes (Cauliflower and shiitake mushroom wraps). I can't say that I was blown away with these dishes since I'm used to eating very authentic Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai food, etc. I had to remind myself to keep an open mind and appreciate the flavors as they are presented in the dish themselves - and they do work. Certainly, a place like this reminds us that eating vegetarian is great for the environment, can be immensely delicious, and can be very reasonable priced, especially with a $36 6-course prix fixe meal.

Artichoke and Broccoli Dumplings -- These were just okay, they had a lot of ginger in the broth which was a bit overpowering and was masking the other flavors. Shiitake Cacio e Pepe over Polenta - This was good for the first bite or two, and then I realized that the polenta was a bit over cooked and it was a little to rich for my taste (too much butter or oil perhaps?) Overall the flavor profiles weren't quite there for me. The service was friendly but our server was pretty rushed and preoccupied with other tables the majority of our dinner. The atmosphere was cool, although kind of loud so maybe not the best place for a first date or if you're trying to have a decent conversation. Also they could use some art or plants on the walls.

5.0,2/24/2018,"I had high expectations for this place given their Michelin star, and also because the last higher-end vegan spot I went to was ABCv which was amazinggggg. So I really was rooting for Nix ... and it definitely did NOT disappoint!!!My boyfriend and I came here, we are both vegans. We had a reservation but went in about 15 minutes early and they were able to seat us right away, even though it was Valentine's Day (!) Immediately I fell in love with the atmosphere of the place - we sat in the back portion, which is nice and cozy without being tight. I love how the layout of the restaurant sort of gets lower as you move far back - it makes it seem much more intimate as you feel like you're sort of underground, or at least in a super calming environment (just me????). As for the food, I thought it was all VERY delicious and very filling. Higher-end restaurants, let alone those who are vegan, tend to give smaller portions which is always frustrating. But at Nix you get a really decent amount of food that doesn't leave you with that I'm-sort-of-still-hungry feeling at the end. Our waitress did a great job of explaining how to order - their menu has lighter and heavier portions, as well as various dips for appetizers. She recommended how many to order of each section, so that we would guaranteed be full by the end. She also was very accommodating with our vegan diets and immediately gave us the vegan menu. FOOD: My boyfriend also ordered a pear + cardamom homemade soda which was deeeelicious. As per the waitress recommendations, we ordered two dips (appetizer), one lighter entree, and two heavier entrees. Dips: spiced eggplant, and avocado. It was evident that they really thought through the types of flavors they wanted to combine within each dip, and these flavors REALLY worked well together. To dip with we chose the raw veggies (of course so fresh), but they also have tandoor bread and papadum. Lighter entree: we had dumplings, I believe they were broccoli or mushroom? They were in this crazy rich balsamic reduction that was so good we were literally taking spoonfuls of it and eating it. Heavier entrees: Cauliflower tempura + steamed buns + vegan mayo (yuuuuuuum ugh) and spicy tofu, which came in a little hot pot and was so silky. The mushrooms cooked with it were perfect. Dessert: this specific dessert you have to order at the beginning of your meal, but we knew we wanted it from the start - their signature half slow-roasted pineapple. It had vegan whipped cream, toasted coconut, and macadamia nuts and it was perfect.I'd honestly give it all 5/5, I have no complaints. And I imagine the fact that it was V-Day means that they were the some of busiest they get, and the service was still top-notch. Everything was very fresh, the hot items were piping hot, and the flavor profiles were unique. I was so full I really barely ate the next day because of it lol!

The best dish we had was an appetizer ""Delicata squash & mushroom dumplings, kohlrabi, ginger & scallion oil"" - the flavor was great and they kind of melt in your mouth (but it was $17 for 5 dumplings, so...). The main dishes were less satisfying and not filling. The ""Spicy tofu, chanterelle mushrooms, kale & szechuan pepper"" was crazy hot and even though I was still hungry I could not eat more than about 1/4 of it. The ""Bamboo rice stir-fry, lily bulb, edamame & farm egg"" was very tasty, as was the side of rice ($6!!) we got with the spicy tofu to calm the burning (and we eat spicy often, this was just crazy and with no warning on the menu or from the server).

I had to flag down some to ask where our starter was after three dishes arrived at once. Throughout the night as soon as we put down a fork it was instantly snapped up by someone. While I appreciate the dedication, it didn't give the flavors or experiences any time to linger. It was just, BAM, removed and table wiped, bam new dish.The food was pretty good. Highlights were probably the Brussel sprouts and sunchoke salad, although the dumplings were solid. The cauliflower was good but overwhelmed with sauce and lacking finesse.

And as soon as we got that they brought our light courses which we were not ready for. Afterwards the bolder courses were disappointing, but the worst was the inedible tandoori pineapple (supposed to take 45 mins which we pre ordered at the beginning), it was not hot and we had to wait a long time for crap. The chef should make up his mind exactly what cuisine and style he is going for because Nix is all over the place.

I will say the service can be hit-or-miss and the bill can add up, but you won't find another vegetarian restaurant in NY that offers such varied, creative options as Nix. For brunch, I'd recommend ordering the patty melt which is a black bean burger nestled in the middle of a grilled cheese-style sandwich.  Not exactly the healthiest option, sure, but bursting in flavor and a great guilty indulgence.  Would also recommend the mad hatter pie which is a riff on a mexican-style quesadilla but instead of using a tortilla, they wrap the filling in a delicate filo pastry.If you're coming for dinner, definitely order the cauliflower tempura - it's one of my favorites and has always been a crowd pleaser.  The bao buns are incredibly soft and a nice contrast to the crisp, right-out-of-the-fryer spicy cauliflower.  The menu changes with whats in season, but going off server recommendations has usually served me well.",0,0,0,Shivani B.,"Manhattan, NY",25,65,53

4.0,12/21/2017,"This place has been on my list of places to try for a bit. Being one of the few vegetarian place with a Michelin star, I had some high expectations for this place. I made a reservation through seated so when I got there, everything was set. The atmosphere was great. It was dimly lit making it super romantic, which is a plus since I was with my girlfriend. The had candles at every table which added a nice natural lighting to the place. I also remember my gf commenting that she liked the waitresses uniforms so that's a plus!The service was good. The waitresses came out at decent times and our tables were cleared fairly promptly. The waitress also did a good job of explaining how their menu worked and what to order and such (one lighter and one bolder for each person). However, there was nothing spectacular about the service (probably cuz everything went so smoothly). The food tho...that's the important part of this review. It hard to exactly describe how I feel about the food. Since I had such high expectations, you could say I was disappointed. However, it was also the most diverse and complex portrayal of vegetarian food I've ever had. We first ordered the avocado, edamame, ginger dip which was very refreshing (bet you didn't expect that adjective) and good. The mushroom dumplings we ordered had a lot less umami that I was expecting (and hoping for) but it had a very interesting balance of acidity and bitterness to it that I knew it would be difficult for me to get sick of. My only problem with it was some kind of herb (I think) poked into my gums and it was tough getting out. My gf was staring at me like wtf. I just hope that isn't a common occurrence as it was very uncomfortable (not painful interestingly). The Brussels sprouts weren't as sweet as I thought that were be but they were very well balanced. For our older dishes, we got the gnocchi and tofu. The gnocchi was probably the softest gnocchi I've ever had, but only second best (the best is reserved for this other Michelin star restaurant in Chicago). The tofu was made on a Chinese way that wasn't as homey or satisfying as it could be but it was also very well balanced. Overall, no one thing really wowed me or made me want to jump out of my seat in joy. However, everything was done so well and well balanced that I could probably eat this stuff every day and not get sick of it. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for some vegetarian/vegan food. Just don't expect it to be cheap or something that will blow you away but it'll be damn good and still somewhat memorable. Also, make a reservation before coming because I doubt you'll get a seat without one.

1.0,12/17/2017,"Unbelievable that this place gets rave reviews and has a Michelin star. If you want high-class vegan/vegetarian food with terrific service and a creative menu, go to Avant Garden instead (where I had what was easily one of the best vegan dinners of my life).Why Nix sucks:* Terrible service. Only interaction with my waiter was a very brusque ""what do you want?"". Dishes were dropped onto my table by random busboys. In contrast, my waiter at Avant Garden always explained all the ingredients and highlights of each dish while I was being served (doesn't seem all that special when I write it, but it was very nice service).* Very ordinary, run-of-the-mill food. I ordered the tandoor + an eggplant spread to start. Tasted like warmed up pita bread from the freezer and I didn't finish it. * Had the cauliflower tempura with buns as a main. I had no idea how to eat this, and nobody explained. Do I put the cauliflower in the buns? Eat them separately? What were the pickled veggies and sauce for? Was the sauce even vegan? It was extremely bland anyways: I've had better cauliflower bbq wings from Veggie Grill (a fast-casual vegan chain), and better $0.50 Asian buns from any cheap restaurant in Chinatown. I took a few bites and stopped eating.When a random busboy came to clear the food, no questions were even asked why my food was barely touched.This place should certainly lose its Michelin star next year.",0,0,0,Mal L.,"Wichita, KS",2,20,1
3.0,12/17/2017,"Glad I tried but wouldn't return. I had heard a lot of hype about this restaurant and was excited to finally go. Unfortunately I was let down. We started with the brussel sprouts and dumplings. The sauce on the brussel sprouts was really good but the brussel sprouts themselves were a bit soggy. The dumplings, however, were really tasty. This was probably my favorite dish. For mains we got the cauliflower and cacio e pepe. The cauliflower was a big let down. Everyone raves about it and the presentation looks amazing but the sauce was lackluster and bland!  The cacio e pepe was tasty and the polenta was a great addition to the dish. For dessert, the chocolate molten cake was embarrassing. It was dry, very dry. No melted chocolate inside. Don't bother. Everyone seemed to have some pineapple with whipped cream for dessert. Maybe this is better? I wouldn't know, it wasn't on the menu and our waitress failed to mention it as a special. For a Michelin star I was expecting more.

4.0,12/17/2017,"Went in for brunch with a party of 5 (three of us vegetarians). Right off the bat, they'd set us up with three mini tables that seat two each, and then, as we sat down and got settled in, ""asked"" (without waiting for a response, which would have been a no) if they could squeeze us into two mini tables (meant for four). Our entire meal was cramped, and I had to take off a star for this. Figure out your booking system so that people aren't struggling to leave the tables for the restroom or get elbow room. If you are going to make it cramped, maybe don't give us a prior option of space and then take it away. That said, let's get to the food. I had the matcha white chocolate tea, and it was simply wonderful-only the slightest bit earthy and herbal but smooth, with a round of white chocolatey sweetness that really made it come together. We then shared the cauliflower bao buns (I thought these were great as is, but most of my friends wished that there was more salt), and I had the french toast and tandoor bread with dips. The tandoor bread was essentially a naan and pretty authentic to taste, but it was small compared to the dip ratio, and I had to leave nearly 3/4 of each dip serving on the plate. The eggplant dip was well flavored, the hummus was good but nothing special, and the avocado was a waste of space. I wish they'd focused more on quality than quantity. I also had a side of the french toast. Let me just say that this may just have been the BEST french toast I have ever had. Each bite was pillowy and soft, without an overwhelming egg flavor, and the bread was perfectly crisped at the ends. It was covered with a strawberry coulis that just added the perfect sweetness (No maple syrup necessary!). I may come back on my own just to grab some of this french toast again; it was THAT good. My friends also had the dutch pancakes (They thought the lack of gluten really affected the texture, but it was tasty) and the patty melt. I'd say the food is worth it, as a vegetarian, because we rarely have the luxury of so many wonderful options on a single menu. One last thing-prices are really strangely thought out here. French toast, which is heavy enough to be an entree but is listed as a side, is $8 while my little naan ""first order"" was $14, and didn't fill me up at all. In addition, black coffee is $6 !!!!!!!! while my matcha green tea white chocolate specialty drink was only a dollar more (and I thought the drink was unique enough to be worth it).  Honestly, I don't care if you picked the beans yourself. Coffee should not cost $6.I personally don't understand it at all, so read your yelp reviews and think about your order before you figure it out (and work with your table to share things!) so things don't go overboard.

The red pepper walnut dip was great with a consistency similar to hummus. Loved the nutty taste.On the other hand, the housemade ricotta pesto dip was my personal favorite, with bold flavours of pesto combined with creamy ricotta on the bottom.The ribbons of jicama was very different from what we have had in the past and it definitely worth a shot. The hot fresno chilli definitely blended well with the raw taste of jicamaFor our entrees, we decided to get the cauliflower tempura (based on prior reviews) and the potato gnocchi. The tempura tasted bland and we weren't sure if it was suppose to taste that way. The buns served with the tempura were fluffy, but didn't add any flavor to the tempura (in addition to the pickles) The potato gnocchi on the other hand was  mesmerizing. They were made with just the right amount of cheese creating a plethora of flavours in your mouth. Finally the worst part of our meal arrived, the chocolate molten cake. The cake felt more like a rock than anything else. Definitely not expected from a Michelin star. The cherry sauce was the only good thing about this dessert.

Later, a different server dropped some glassware and they did not clean up some fairly large pieces of glass near us either.

1.0,11/27/2017,"We had Thanksgiving dinner at Nix, expecting creative and delicious twists on perfectly prepared vegetables, with maybe a touch of whimsy in homage to a vegetarian Thanksgiving.  The entire Nix meal, from start to finish, was a disappointment.  Brussel spouts were served with scissors.  That's as creative as the meal got. The hummus had an odd acidity to it.  Not impressed.This was our first experience with a Michelin Star restaurant.  Give that star back.  I mean it.  I hate to speak in absolutes, but please believe me that none of the food was beyond lukewarm.  None of the food was interesting to look at.  The little dish of mashed potatoes was cold.  How could any vegetarian restaurant fail at mashed potatoes on Thanksgiving?   Two of the dishes were heavily over salted.  The sweet potato dish was not only unattractive, it was inedible.  The flat bread was served with a smear of what tasted like cold country gravy, and topped with a clunky carrot slice that was hard and unappealing.  What bothered me just as much was that the staff my wife and I dealt with appeared to know it.  Dishes were reluctantly placed on the table.  There was no joy in their faces.  And it's very telling when wait staff never once asks how your meal is.  Not one time.  I believe that's because they knew it was sub-par.  They clearly noticed we ate no more than one or two bites off each dish.  It is only because we were seated so closely to other couples on either side that I didn't ask to speak to the manager... it was Thanksgiving, and I didn't was to ruin someone elese's holiday experience like Nix had ruined ours.  However, I now regret not doing so. I also regret paying the $200 bill for that weak meal.  My wife and I just completed a full week in  NYC.  This was the only horrific food experience we had.  One thing the restaurant did get right is it's name... because we will never eat there again.",0,0,0,Stephan S.,"Austin, TX",0,2,2

It was all bland, there were two or three types of mushrooms, all tasting the same, i.e. tasteless. Even the cheese could not liven it up...- sides - there were three of them, the peppered green beans were...well, peppered...which means that they had some taste to themselves, the other two were unremarkable- desert - the most generic thing you can get into a grocery shop - a square jelly, mini pumpkin pie and something wrapped in a cellophane which was too sticky to unwrap, the wrap would break and content stick to it, I had to dump it altogether...Ambiance was good, lighting and music tasteful, so was the decor.

2.0,11/21/2017,"Seriously disappointed. This is another one of those aesthetically minimalist restaurant with a very polished look. The interior is warm and inviting but it is too bad that they chose to seat us on the worse table in the restaurants (all the way in back, on a communal table in front of the kitchen), despite having made a reservation a few weeks in advance. I am not going to lie but maybe the fact that we were the only group of POC was the reason ... Especially since we were early and there were numerous tables with a couch-side available. Our waitress was very curt and at times even rude (like when she slammed down our check on the table). But on to the food. 1. We started with the avocado dip with tandoor bread. The bread was awful, undercooked inside, burnt on the outside. It had barely risen so most of it was just flaky. Dip was a glorified guacamole than wasn't very good, even Dos Toros could put it to shame. 2. We had the mushroom dumplings which was probably one of the better dishes we had. Nothing memorable though. 3. The cauliflower tempura was a joke - basically the flavors of a fast-food joint but I'd much rather go to an actual fast-food place in that case. I thought this was a Michelin-star restaurant? Way too saucy and sweet, the buns were a curious complement that did not make the experience better (if anything probably worse). 4. Warm avocado with lentils, Brussel sprouts and curry. This was a complex dish with many interesting flavors and textures, which held great potential BUT was very poorly executed. The curry sauce was undercooked and grainy, basically curry powder that barely had time to be cooked into a sauce. 5. Bamboo rice. For a moment we thought we had a winner. Not that it's particularly hard to nail a good fried rice dish. But then when we got to the bottom of the bowl, we discovered that it was *swimming* in oil. Even my corner Chinese take-out does not disappoint like that.TL;DR Nix is an attempt to ""elevate"" Asian cuisine with a modern twist but fails miserably. Totally misunderstands Asian cuisine and food in general. But I am sure the vegan hipsters who have too much money to spend will continue flocking here.

So, my friend suggested Nix and booked us a reservation this past Tuesday at 9PM.I'm going to skip the whole ambiance and service (lackluster) bit of the review and just go straight into the food.My friend got the Blackberry & Juniper house-made ""soda"" to start. The reason why I would put soda in quotation marks is because it had zero carbonation and can be better described as juice. The juniper was not overwhelming and played well with the blackberry. We both agreed flavor-wise, it was good but might be deceiving to call this soda.To our waitress' suggestion, we got the Tandoor Bread and a dip to start. Then a ""Lighter"" dish, finishing off with two ""Bolder"" dishes.The Tandoor bread came out hot and fluffy. It also had some nice char to it. To pair with the bread, we ordered the hummus. Not the best and not the worst hummus I had before. It was okay.For our ""Lighter"" dish, we shared the Delicata squash & mushroom dumplings. The filling was finely pureed and had a subtle ginger taste. As for presentation, there were some small diced celery pieces and 2-3 kohlrabi shavings, dressed with a mild chili oil. I would've liked some more texture to the dumplings.Next, we had the Cauliflower Tempura. To start off with the positive, the cauliflower had a nice texture, elevated by the use of, I want to guess, poppy seeds. Now to the bad, it was drenched in a lackluster BBQ sauce and as a result, made a less than appealing dish aesthetically. It was obvious they were trying to make a veggie friendly version of General Tso's. Overall, my partner and I agreed the sauce overpowered everything else on the dish. If you like sauces and heavier dishes, you might enjoy this.Our last dish was the warm avocado with lentils. The curry was delicate and refreshing. Perhaps the dish we liked the best, it also had its pitfalls. We both agreed the lentils were under-cooked, making a dry, gritty mouth feel. The plate was also dominated by lentils. It also seemed like it was a lazy presentation attempt - the vegetables were piled on top of the lentils and pushed to one side of the plate.For dessert, we had the quarter roasted pineapple with whipped cream, topped with toasted coconut flakes and macadamia nuts. This was another plate that was overwhelmingly covered with some kind of a sauce. The cream was piled up so high and thick, we couldn't see what we were cutting into. The pineapple was sweet, especially after it has been roasted. The coconut flakes had a strange texture. Dare I say, like stale cereal?Would I go back to this 1 Michelin star restaurant?

Expect to pay $18+ for an entree. An apple/caramel dish that we did not order came to our table. At first, the server saw it and said ""oh, that's not for you,"" then corrected himself and said it was from the kitchen for us. lol...not going to complain about free apples with dip but the way it was handled was interesting.THE BAD: Major downside: my tofu scramble was heavily salted--the curry and other seasoning on it did not come through at all. While the texture achieved was nice, I didn't like this dish simply because there was no complexity on the palate and it was quite monotonous (a few lentils in a sea of tofu, a tiny portion of greens, and two pieces of yummy bread). For a michelin starred place, I expected a bit more of a gastronomic experience. This is a dish I would have expected at a much lower-scale vegan diner as opposed to brunch at Nix.

Would recommend dishes, then say she actually doesn't recommend them. Drinks were never refilled. Waitress never came around to offer a dessert menu after our dinner plates sat empty. She cost the restaurant money. Worst of all, we were there for a birthday.. we let them know.. and they still fail to offer a dessert menu before kicking us out. Very very frustrating.

3.0,10/16/2017,"I've had the opportunity to dine at Nix on four separate occasions, and would say my most recent visit left me with a 'funny taste in my mouth'. The service was very off. This was my first brunch experience and shortly after ordering the waitress came and put down two dishes that we did not order. The table got very excited and thought the kitchen was sending a special treat. Shortly after, the waitress came back saying that she made a mistake, and took back the food that she had already placed on the table. Given this is a 'nice' restaurant, the waitress should view this as a courtesy mistake. One individuals food came out 15 minutes after everyone else's. Coffee had a pile of grounds at the bottom. Overall, this most recent experience was not like my first three. I will, however, note that the cauliflower tempura did become a larger portion than when they first opened.",0,0,0,Jaclyn S.,"Huntington Station, NY",1,19,31

5.0,10/9/2017,"Nix was fantastic. I was fully prepared for it to be a nicer (i.e. more pricey) meal. We walked over on a whim and they had a table for 2 open, but I'd recommend making a reservation ahead of time. I'd been waiting to add Nix to my ever-expanding repertoire of vegan/vegetarian meals. It didn't disappoint. We were feeling like we needed a lighter meal, but I liked that there were heavier dishes to satisfy bigger hunger. I liked that we were offered either the vegetarian menu or vegan menu (the vegan menu is just a subset of the vegetarian one, not an entirely different list). I asked for both so that I could get an idea of which dishes were dairy-free. We went for two dips to start: eggplant and avocado. They charge extra for the things you dip these with (tandoor bread or raw veggies). The pine nuts sprinkled across the eggplant dip made it a home run. Crudité costs 6 dollars, and it was a very small portion of prettily-arranged veggies and slices of green apple on ice. We added the pea dumplings with radish, ginger & scallion oil. They are more wonton-like, for the savvy, and they are delicious. The broth is quite sour on its own, but the pea concoction inside the wonton wrappers was delicious and had such an interesting texture. I tried the tofu-skin pockets filled with sweet potato and topped with tomatillo-pepita salsa. So delicious. The pepitas added a satisfying crunch. My date had the seaweed kale caeser, which was a good portion of a salad with interesting texture on top from the nori breadcrumbs. The ambience was romantic and hip (dim lights, candles, interesting wooden sculptures and lamps), and the waiters were prompt and friendly. Great for a date or celebration (the vegan dessert sounded fantastic but we were being good that day).

4.0,10/4/2017,"Who knew vegetables could taste so good and be so bad for you?

I was excited to celebrate my 30th birthday and made a reservation for 12 people  a few months in advance. They called to confirm a few days before the day but then the morning of my birthday I get another call claiming their policy is to have the order be placed in advance for 10+ parties and they email me menus asking to pick all the food before we get there. So I spend half of the day asking 12 of my friends mid work day to look at a vegan menu they have never seen without ability to ask any questions from waiters and make their decision so the restaurant can bring out all dishes in random order as soon as possible once we got there and have us out  of there within an hour so they can give the tables to someone else and get more $. I find that absolutely ridiculous. During service no one really checked in with us or asked if we wanted anything else and we felt very rushed. I would expect more for $700+ bill. They also messed up a drink but said we can have it anyway instead of it being thrown out, so we agreed. Guess what, it sure was included in he bill.

5.0,9/3/2017,"What a fabulous meal! My partner and I really enjoyed Nix and would definitely recommend it. I love checking out vegan/vegetarian restaurants in other cities and had read about Nix when planning a recent visit to NYC. I made a reservation a couple of weeks in advance to make sure we could get in. This was my first Michelin star rated restaurant (that I know of) so I was super excited.We arrived a few minutes early for a 9:30 reservation on a Saturday night and the place was packed. We were seated after waiting for about 15 minutes. The restaurant is small and the bar was busy so we waited outside and did some people watching. The hostess checked in with us a couple of times while we waited.Once we were seated we were promptly served and our server went over the menu and explained that the menu is tapas style. The menu is divided up in ""lighter"" and ""bolder"" dishes. The lighter are cold salads/dishes and the bolder are hot dishes. There is also an assortment of dips that are either served with crudites or tandoor bread. We tried the avocado, mint, and curry dip and opted for the crudites. It was really good and the serving was enough for two. Avocado and curry make quite the combo. We debated ordering multiple dips, but one was enough for an appetizer.We skipped over the lighter dishes and went right for the bolder choices. We ordered the warm avocado and the mushroom risotto. Both were amazing! I think the mushroom risotto stood out a bit more if I had to choose a favorite. The flavors were incredible. Nix has a vegan menu and a vegetarian menu. I normally stick with vegan but when I am on vacation I loosen up and often eat vegetarian. Either way, Nix has plentiful options. If you have meat eaters in your group, they will be fine. The food is delicious and they won't miss it for one meal.The cocktails were unique but a bit on the sweeter side for me. To put it into context, I'm an old-fashioned drinker so I like my cocktails very alcohol forward. I tried ""a peach"" and then switched to rose. There were some awesome dessert options but we were too full to partake. Nix was our splurge meal while visiting NYC. I knew it would be pricey, but worth it. We came in at about $160 for two (including tip) and that included an appetizer, 4 drinks, and two entrees. Pretty pricey but you do get what you pay for, as they say. This would be a great special occasion spot if you need an excuse to splurge. The ambiance is nice but not pretentious. An overall win!",0,0,0,Lindsey E.,"Atlanta, GA",175,345,217
4.0,9/2/2017,"Michelin star aside, there's a lot to love about Nix. Much of the restaurant's produce is sourced from the nearby Union Square Greenmarket, the menu is fun and innovative, and the interior is modern and spacious. Offering an array of diverse dishes to share amongst the table, Nix invites its guests to partake in a celebration of vegetables.We selected two items each from the menu's ""lighter"" and ""bolder"" sections. The tandoor carrots with sorrel, jalapeño-basil vinaigrette, and cured egg yolk were a bit salty, but the bitterness of the sorrel balanced it out. The cured egg yolk, resembling grated cheese, was the reason for the saltiness, but in moderation, it provided a nice seasoning for the carrots.The pea dumplings with radish, ginger, and scallion oil had to be savored, as there were only five tiny dumplings included in a single order. This, however, left room for the tofu-skin pockets, stuffed with sweet potato and smothered in a thick tomatillo-pepita salsa. Best described as Nix's interpretation of enchiladas, the tofu-skin pockets are chewy and substantial.The cauliflower tempura is clearly modeled after steamed pork buns, but the impressive texture and flavor of the cauliflower makes it a commendable vegetarian alternative. Instead of attempting to simulate meat, the restaurant crafts the vegetable to assume similar qualities, such as a crispy outer layer and a sweetness imparted by the sauce.I couldn't leave Nix without trying the roasted pineapple, a deceptively simple dessert that needs to be requested in advance, due to its preparation time. The quartered pineapple is first glazed and roasted in a tandoor oven; afterwards, it's topped with vegan whipped cream, and then sprinkled with toasted macadamia nuts and coconut flakes. Forget cakes and pies, this pineapple is the most delicious, tropical dessert this city has to offer. Make sure to ask for it as early as possible!",5,2,4,Daniela L.,"New York, NY",374,155,37

We ordered the naan (do not skip the naan!!!) with avocado and straciatella. I never thought avocado and curry would make such a harmonious duo. Then our ""lighter"" dishes arrived: the pea dumplings (another must order) and the burrata. The pea dumplings kind of stole the show. You will notice how ridiculously beautifully plated they are. The pasta is perfectly al dente and the filling is savory and satisfying. It is paired with a slightly acidic broth- the perfect accompaniment. The burrata could have been bigger- given how much tomato the dish came with. The tempura cauliflower and gnocchi were both great as well. The gnocchi is unlike any gnocchi you have ever had.

And the food was totally underwhelming.Everything is full of sugar (yuck), there are no bold or interesting flavors and everything is swimming in some oil sauce that will give you a stomach ache.I started with an alcohol free cocktail. Pear and cardamom. Nothing to write home about. Most beverages in the cooler of your local bodega will be tastier. They pour it out of nifty little bottles though.Appetizers:Nix - home of the $6 Tandoori Bread. We had all the dips.

Like a tasteless white blob of grease.On to the mains:Portobello carpaccio, summer truffles, sarvecchio & celery:They have a lot of mushrooms on their menu. I like me a good mushroom. And so does my wife. I usually complain to her having fresh mushrooms in the fridge without a container because - well - fresh mushrooms can be quite fragrant. No danger here. The Portobello mushrooms had no fragrance and no flavors. You could taste the truffles with saved the dish.  But that was kind of it.Pan Roasted Potatao Gnochi, zucchini, corn, jalapeno & mint:Dish comes out.

I'm a true carnivore so I wasn't too sure how much I would enjoy a vegetarian restaurant, but this may have been one of the best meals I've ever had in my life. Not only are the prices REALLY reasonable for a place that has a Michelin star (our bill only came out to be around $70-80 for two people), the food was delicious and the portions were really generous. The staff usually recommend you order at least 1-2 things off each part of the menu (appetizers, salads, and main course) because it's all meant to be shared. So in total, for about six dishes, $70-80 is a steal. The ambiance is very nice and quiet, or at least it was on the Friday night we were there. Staff is attentive and very nice.

3.0,6/23/2017,"NYC, NY: I don't know what to say about this place, which I suppose isn't a great way to start a review. Most of the menu was hit or miss so more than anything, I was bothered by the inconsistency.I started my meal with a pear and cardamom soda, which, quite honestly was utterly bland. As an Indian who uses cardamom in my chai to give it an oomph of flavor, I wonder if someone forgot the cardamom in my soda all together. Our group of three then grabbed some ""tandoor"" bread (which as a side note is actually ""naan..."" calling it ""tandoor"" bread is awfully pretentious), which was $6.00 a piece. Even to a New Yorker, it seems absurd to charge $6.00 a PIECE on one piece of naan. I will say, however, the dips were truly exceptional - we grabbed the house hummus, red pepper and walnut, and spiced eggplant. Afterwards, we had some jicama, which was truly awful, though I'm not sure if it's because I've learned I detest jicama or whether it was the dish that was unsavory. I'll chalk it up to my own distaste of jicama. We also had the braised baby corn, which was the best dish by far. Not sure what the sauce has in it but I was moments from licking the plate, it was that delicious. We ended our meal with some spicy tofu and chocolate mouse cake. The tofu was genuinely spicy - which is always a plus - and the cake was terrific. One bottle of Chianti and a couple hundred dollars later, our meal was over.While the meal was a bit hit and miss, and unnecessarily expensive, I will give full marks to the service. My glass of water was always full and the servers were efficient, if a bit unattached. Despite being a vegetarian, I don't frequent vegetarian restaurants often. I'd come back here for the baby corn and the cake, but I won't be paying $6.00 for naan again.",0,0,0,Shehnoor G.,"Tallahassee, FL",73,96,36

The menu continues to change a bit every season - I really enjoyed a dish featuring sunchokes recently and I was so happy to get my hands on another cauliflower tempura bun! For brunch, there's a great range of lighter options to a very hefty patty melt - oh my gosh the patty melt is good, and great to split! Filled with a dense beany patty, plenty of caramelized onions and gooey cheese, it's so so good. The mad hatter pie was also really nice and filling. Will be returning soon for the upcoming summer season! There's no need to emphasize that it's good vegetarian food, it's just good food period.",2,1,2,Lillian Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",461,285,1300
4.0,6/18/2017,"Lovely, lovely restaurant and meal. If you like vegetables and creative flavors (and don't mind a meal without meat), then Nix is a gem. Despite its possession of a Michelin star now, it's still extremely unassuming and easy to get a reservation at. Will be coming back!FOODWe got the tandoor bread with three dips--a must! As good as everyone says it is. We also got the naked avocado, which I LOVED. The polenta fries were unique and tasty, but I would put it below the baked avocado and dips.We then had the pea dumplings, which were light and elegant. The cauliflower tempura with buns really stole the show, though--the bun was perfectly steamed and slightly sweet, and it's amazing how versatile cauliflower is! We also got the patty melt, which was only so-so (hence the 4 stars)... which makes me think that one should steer clear of the dishes that try to mimic meat, so one can really enjoy the creativity of the vegetables!And there is free sparkling water! (Having accidentally ordered $50 of sparkling water once at a meal, this is always a plus for me.)SERVICEWaiters were extremely nice and attentive. We had to ask a few times for refills, but it wasn't hard to get their attention.AMBIANCEI love the decor and feel of the restaurant. It is so light and bright and filled with plants.

The cocktails (Baja and Honey Bee) were average and lacked complexity. The service was very inattentive with huge gaps of time between courses, no one even checked on us after receiving our entrees, and dirty dishes and utensils were left on the table between courses.

We got the tandoor bread to start with the labneh & marinated cucumbers (highly recommend! so fresh), and the charred avocado a la plancha which our waitress recommended to us.

2.0,5/15/2017,"Nix is a classy vegetarian restaurant serving New American with a South and East Asian twist. Unfortunately the ""twist"" could have been better executed, IMO. Their well-known cauliflower tempura was overly sauced up, and began to look and taste like an orange chicken take out dish. It came with white pillowy buns (identical to ones that come with Peking Duck at Chinese restaurants), which were too doughy, overpowering the tempura, and hard to wrap around the unusual cauliflower shapes. The polenta fries were tasty and crisp, topped with shredded parmigiana. But the fries weren't enough to make the meal.

3.0,5/14/2017,"I was very excited to try Nix.  We have been to Fraser's Dovetail and absolutely loved it!  So needless to say I had very high expectations for Nix.We started with the Tandoori bread hummus, avocado dip and eggplant dip.  I was not very impressed.  The tandoori bread is something you can get at any Indian restaurant, there wasn't anything about it that set it apart from the traditional tandoori naan.  The hummus was good but it was nothing extraordinary.  The avocado dip was very similar to guacamole and the eggplant dip was very similar to an Indian dish called baigan bharta.  I was looking for more contrasting flavors in these dips that complemented each other but they were really your standard hummus, guacamole.We ordered the pea dumplings from the lighter menu.  Now that was absolutely DELISH!  The one thing Fraser does well is dumplings/raviolis.  Even at Dovetail the chickpea raviolis were my favorite.  The pea dumplings were melt in your mouth and full of flavor.  I wanted to drink the sauce it came in.We then ordered the cauliflower steamed buns, polenta and the vegan rice dish.  I didn't care for the cauliflower steamed buns.  I'm not crazy about cauliflower and I felt like I was just eating a big head of cauliflower with sauce smeared on it.  My husband enjoyed it more than I did.  The polenta was good but after a few bites it felt too rich and buttery.  The rice was very good but again it was rice - I wish there was some tofu in there.  Overall - I wasn't too impressed with the main course.   For dessert we got the chocolate cake - my kids really enjoyed it but for me it was ehh.Now for the drinks.  I got the Shiso cooler and it was solid.  Loved it.  Definitely felt like a cooler, refreshing, cool with just the right amount of alcohol.  Overall, I would go back for the drinks and the pea dumplings.  And this time I would try the potato gnocchi as well.",0,0,0,Bonnie D.,"Edgewater, NJ",16,72,7

Service was quick and attentive for the most part. I started with one of their speciality iced teas, which was very refreshing. I liked that they had unique non-alcoholic beverages including home-made sodas and teas. Our table ordered several appetizers to share including the naan, trio of dips, onion dip with veggies, and polenta fries. The dips were unmemorable... They were not unique or particularly outstanding flavor wise. The onion dip was too reminiscent of the Lipton onion soup packet that I used to mix with sour cream for parties back in the day. The polenta fries were out of this world incredible! That was the only appetizer round winner in my opinion.The main menu did not have enough gluten free options. Although they claim to be GF friendly, they aren't super friendly if you know what I mean. They are definitely more vegan friendly. I wound up ordering the beet burger sans bun. I'm not quite sure what I was expecting, but it definitely wasn't what I got. What came was literally a large grilled beet with some cucumber slices and a little mint. No flavor whatsoever. Beyond disappointing. The dessert round was the meal standout. I had the citrus salad with tapioca. It was refreshing, and probably one of the best desserts I have had a restaurant that wasn't death by chocolate or that made me want to lie in the fetal position writhing in sugar pains.

5.0,3/10/2017,"Short story - Nix is definitely on my hit list for out-of-towners. Amazing food, well deserving of Michelin status, star-studded place, and FANTASTIC service. The latter comment is quite ironic because I made a reservation there to celebrate my birthday with a dear friend and when we arrived they didn't have it noted. My reservation was for an usual time (8:15pm) so when I told them it definitely didn't seem made up! I was also able to tell them when I booked it and before what time so the hostess gave me the benefit of the doubt which was pleasantly surprising (esp for a posh resto like this). She was incredibly apologetic and told me the best she could do was seat us at the bar, so we took it because we were starving.Long story short, the bartender was incredibly hospitable and attentive. He walked us through the menu, asked us about our food allergies, suggested their best dishes, and gave me the heads up that a few starter dips were going to come our way due to the mix up and my bday.What ended up happening was they served us 3 dips (1. House hummus, zaatar 2) Avocado, mint & curry and 3) Labneh & marinated cucumbers), bread, and raw veggies... all incredibly fresh and tasty. Then came our main dishes we ordered (1) Cauliflower tempura with steamed buns & house pickle 2) Three grain stir-fry with market veggies, chanterelles & farm egg and 3) Shaved brussels sprouts, butternut squash & almonds). All stellar. But the kicker? On top of all that (and at this point we were both pretty full) they sent out TWO more surprise dishes compliments of the chef! It ended up being the 1) Potato gnocchi, celery root, chestnuts & truffle butter which was AMAZING as well as the 2) dumplings. Overall, I had such an amazing experience at Nix and would highly suggest anyone living in NYC or visiting to book a reservation. Nix is truly a class act, in terms of food and service.PS I never usually take the time to write restaurant reviews but I was too compelled not to!",0,0,0,Karen L.,"New York, NY",0,4,0

From the bread to the dessert the food was without exception perfection. However......there was one thing that made the evening a horror and that was we were ushered thru the evening by THE MOST irritating server EVER!!!At one point we actually laughed thinking that we were being filmed for a Candid Camera type show. She was ridiculous. At our table telling us what to eat, how many dishes to order....can she take our plates away while we were still eating and generally at our table every two minutes....even....telling us HOW to put broccoli INSIDE steamed buns? Gosh, they should really outfit the place with high chairs when she's on duty.....NOT a pleasant dining experience. THEN....when we told her we were still eating, she sent over two guys to clear the table. Crazy! It's too bad because service is an important part of the dining experience and she really wrecked it. They can kill themselves in the kitchen but if you are irritated at your table and interrupted constantly it is not pleasant.Somebody better control that gal....people on both sides of our table commented on the same thing.I wonder if they deliver.....",0,0,0,Suzy B.,"CANAL STREET, NY",0,4,0

Started with tandoor bread that was pretty fresh but probably the most expensive I ever ate @$6. Red pepper & walnut and spiced eggplant and pine nuts dips. While both were pretty good I liked eggplant better. Ribbons of jicama with fresno chili & blood oranges salad was very tasty and fresh. That was my favorite item. Tried Shiitake ""cacio e pepe"" with green beans and creamy polenta, while it was very tasty it was one of the ""heaviest"" dishes I ever had keep in mind I am a carnivore. Probably all the cream.

3.0,2/26/2017,"Kind of surprised.  I guess if you've never had vegetarian food than you'll think this place rocks.  But the food was overly salty and very rich. Of course, I only had a few dishes, so take my opinion with a grain of salt (haha).  The bread, hummus and avocado was great, but of course, you can get that anywhere.  As a vegetarian, I'm glad that restaurants are promoting more plant based cuisine.  So if people flock here then I guess that's great.  But chef, couldn't you create dishes that don't overload us with needless sodium?  I mean, if you cut the salt content by 25% the dishes would still be delicious and still have plenty of flavor.  The prices were high but I'm ok with that.  Heck, it's chic New York.  The service was great and of course it should be for such a restaurant.  Anyway, if you're looking to give vegetarian food a try, or you're looking for a fancy place to have vegetarian food, then give Nix a try,",0,0,0,Scott K.,"Nutley, NJ",0,20,4
2.0,2/26/2017,"Wow... What a disappointment.I wanted to go there because I'm vegan and there aren't that many choices for upscale-ish dinning in the City if you like your food cruelty free. I had no idea about the Michelin star chef bla bla blah... So I didn't really have any specific expectations, but I had to make my reservation 3 weeks in advance... So I assumed it was going to be somewhat special.The first red flag was the service... The waiter was super pompous, and fake friendly, with that ""I'm not even gonna pretend it's real, just give me 20%"" attitude you see sometimes... Bummer.Then the food... The naan I get delivered from my neighborhood Indian joint is better, and the dips were decent, but nothing special... The smoked eggplant one was way too sweet.The Brussels sprouts were so sour that you couldn't really taste the ingredients... Just vinegar. Someone dropped the bottle in there by accident?The salad was just a bunch of lettuce in a plate. Yes, it was good lettuce... But basically no dressing or anything at all memorable.The cauliflower buns... It was good. But definitely not ""to die for""... More like $7 Chinese delivery in my hood kinda good. And the buns were clearly frozen ones... Not homemade. Pretty shameless if you ask me.The other thing we got, something with broccoli rabe, was once again... sour. Basically, the whole dinner was sour. Everything was flat, uninspired, lacking subtlety, or harmony... Even the presentation wasn't that great.We even went for the pineapple desert that supposedly takes 45 mn to roast... Sounded fun, and I love pineapple. But again... Disappointment. It was just a warm pineapple quarter, drowned in whipped cream and macadamia nuts (which were not very good either! And I freaking love macadamia...).To top it all off, our friendly waiter brought the check while we were still eating our pineapple, and started clearing everything on our table, and making it extra obvious that he was checking if we dropped the credit card on the table every 2 minutes... When I spend $200 for 2, and I've been seating at that table for only 1h45, that's just not acceptable.The food is not terrible... But the place is pretentious, overpriced, and I'd much rather go back to Avant Garden, or Dirt Candy instead...

5.0,2/22/2017,"Nix is a vegetarian paradise by Chef Jon Fraser who is clearly one of the most incredible culinary talents in NYC. He is also the Chef of Narcissa, which I just reviewed on here, although I did not know the two were related! I guess that shows what I know =P My wife and I are temporarily living in the neighborhood, and have been to Nix three times: twice for ""brunch,"" and once for lunch. We have not gone for dinner yet, and I thought maybe I should hold off on the review until I had, but since their ""open for lunch"" sign is relatively new, I thought folks should know that the best vegetarian restaurant in the neighborhood is open for scrumptious lunch.I'm normally a ""screw brunch"" kind of guy; I don't drink, I don't eggs, and I think brunch is pretty much a rip-off. But good lawd, Nix does it right, and has lots of options on the menu for those of us who don't want to get drunk and eat dessert at 11 in the morning (as well as plenty of tantalizing options for those who do). First off, their tandoori bread with dipping sauces sounds simple, but you will fall instantly in love. I've become patently addicted to the green goddess sun choke salad, which is unusual for me, but the flavors just permeate all the way down to my soul. My wife is an egg eater and she has their Market Scramble which she assures me is one of the best egg dishes she's ever had. The Cauliflower tempura is *pure craziness in a bun*. Seriously I'm eating it in my mind right now. It is everything. For lunch, the stuffed tandoor bread with broccoli and cheese is just. I'm not quite ""eating it in my brain right now,"" but when I was eating it in real life on President's Day, I was very happy indeed.And for dessert... I haven't sampled the ""Nun's Puffs"" yet, but holy sweet craziness the Chocolate mousse cake is bonkers, bonkers amazing. You will not believe that it is vegan. It is simply just from another planet.If you happen to be someone like me who a) doesn't drink and b) is obsessed with fruit juice, you owe it to yourself to try the Blackberry & Juniper Soda. I'm a dark fruit juice nutcase, and this is without question one of the most delightful beverages I have ever had the pleasure of imbibing. Now here's a pro-tip: if you don't have a reservation (you should make one, even for lunch at an offbeat time), you might actually be doing yourself a favor, as their bartender (I believe his name is Cody, but it might be Corey, and if you're reading this, I'm sorry for butchering your name) is the sweetest guy on the planet, the full menu is available at the bar, and it's a great experience. Honestly, I feel like when we sit there, we've got the best seat in the house. It's funny to find out as I'm posting this that Nix and Narcissa share the same Chef, but it totally makes sense. I'm glad Chef Fraser has gone all veggie with this new outting because I'm trying to stick as close to an all-vegetarian diet as possible. But it's nice to know I'll be supporting the same team when I take a pilgrimage to Narcissa to eat their Fried Dover Sole to satisfy my bloodlust.",1,1,0,Ben W.,"Brooklyn, NY",143,13,3

The entire restaurant has a spa like aura - suuuupes relaxing and just generally beautiful. Our waiter was really attentive and I tried a blackberry cocktail made with him. Yum but a bit pricey for $16?You order food family style and share so we wound up getting:Flat Bread (tandoori style) - $6 Eggplant dip - $5Roasted red pepper and walnut dip - $5Tempura cauliflower - $18Stir Fry rice and veggies - $20?? (can't remember now)Fried Potato Bread - $18 Flat bread was good and as everyone else here mentions the dips are delish,  but if you're super hungry $16 for what amounts to one pita bread and a bit of hummus isn't ... economical. Delicious though don't get me wrong.If you're going to order anything, you have to prioritize the cauliflower. It is perfectly breaded and fried - weirdly reminds you of eating orange chicken or something. Comes with steamed bao buns to wrap it in and some odd pickles that i couldn't figure where they played into the dish.Stir fried rice with veggies was probably the most savory dish - basically a bimbimbap without meat. Seasonal veggies and a bit greasy but any of your meat lover friends would be happy to eat it.Fried bread was good too - kind of felt like eating fish n chips but not. Comes with a really awesome carmelized onion dip and some very weirdly fried whole onion pieces.Overall, a steal for a 1 michelin star joint, but as always with vegetarian restaurants i leave and find myself bloated, full of gas, and somehow still a bit hungry.If you, however, can handle fiber more than my body can, I HIGHLY recommend Nix!",0,1,0,Kelly E.,"New York, NY",126,400,57
3.0,2/10/2017,"I had some of their vegan options, the brussel sprouts, fried rice, and tofu and they were all incredibly delicious. My problem with this place is that the waitress told us that the portions were made to share, yet when the items were brought to us they were too small even for one person. Vegans are BIGGGG eaters, that fried rice thing would probably be half of a serving for a plant-based person, so recommending all those dishes to share was really really horrible. After those tiny servings the bill was over $100 dollars which i would be perfectly ok with if any of us were even remotely satisfied.

5.0,2/4/2017,"Simply Amazing. I have been there twice: once for lunch and once for dinner. The lunch was very good but not as mind blowing as the dinner. For dinner, I ordered the tandoor bread with avocado dip, the jicama salad, and the maple custard.I had the tandoor bread at lunch the first time, and decided another dip this time. For some reason, the bread for dinner was even better than the one for lunch: so much warmer and crisper, and the dip had a much more delightful and interesting flavour: very fresh, very sour, but so very good!As for the jicama salad, it might be the best salad I have ever had in my entire life. I normally never order salad, because it's never done very good, but this salad! I devoured it!. It tastes better with each bite: the blood oranges, the jicama, the perfect balance between sweet and sour, I can't stop raving about this simple yet amazing dish. The maple custard for dessert was again wonderful. The chef didn't overdo it on sweetness, and with the cream you get to pour onto the custard, it's little morsels of heaven!I'll be sure to return for a third and fourth time to try more dips, maybe next time the ""Cacio e Pepe""!",0,0,0,Xinyu W.,"New York, NY",0,1,0

I loved the jicama salad and wok roasted carrots. Also, the cauliflower baos are brilliant. Not delicate at all. Bold flavor, crunchy but divine. The shittake caccio e Pepe was another fave but I didn't care much for it. I loved the broccoli rabe and artichoke however! This is delicately balanced. Skip the grilled pineapple.

I'm glad that I have made more vegetarian friends lately so I get to try different places :P. It's kind of refreshing to go vegetarian once in a while. Came here for lunch/brunch. The entrance is tiny so I kind of got lost for a bit but once you open the door, the interior is upscale but the vibe is chill. We started with the three dips. Every dip is super yummy and I especially love the eggplant and the hummus. I asked if it was supposed to be tapa style or if each one of us should order our own dish. The server told me it really depends on what you prefer. Even though we each ordered our own thing I feel like sharing would be a better adventure. At least I like it better because I like to try a little bit of everything. I got the three grain stir fry. It tasted really healthy and yummy as well. I liked it. I also tried the eggs Benedict. I really like the hollandaise sauce! It tasted like a blend of the traditional hollandaise sauce and ketchup.

3.0,1/20/2017,"3.5 stars.I've found myself dining at Nix multiple times in the past 2 months, and that's a sure invitation to get back on the yelp review scene. (HELLO ALL!!)Being located in the Village, you can't fault Nix for being tight on space (let's go ahead and call it cozy). The selection is a combination of flavours and creations from various parts of the world, somehow condensed into just 15 to 20 items. From your predictable kale salad to the unpredictable shiitake cacio e pepe; from the oriental cauliflower tempura and buns to Indian style bread and dips; from the refreshing jicama blood orange salad to greasy fried bread; they have it all.I can review the dishes I have tasted, but that might be of limited value given their changing offerings. But I'll still go for it. My favourite items on the permanent menu were the Tandoor breads and spiced eggplant and avocado mint and curry dips. The chewy bread with the freshness of the herbs in the dips works really, really well together.They have a section of Lighter items (read salad, mostly cold items). The spicy deviled eggs, that come with a real kick and shaved fried potatoes on top, were a hit. As were the roasted sunchokes. The apple and edible flower salad was just plainly a bunch of ingredients thrown into a plate with barely any dressing at all. Moving on.. Kale salad with pistachios did you say? Been there done that. Moving on..(Sense a pattern here? Go light on the lighter section of the menu).Among the Bolder menu items, I found several favourites. The cauliflower tempura and bun just hit the spot. It was like all five tastes doing a happy dance on my tastebuds. fantastic. The cacio e pepe was good as well, comforting and cheesy, but best if shared because it is so rich.  The tofu skin dish was yummy also. The only thing I would avoid is a butternut fry bread, unless you like your food heavy on oil and light on flavour.What's a meal without dessert? As soon as we had sat down the server said to us, ""Our dessert special tonight is extra special. It is a grilled pineapple with vegan whipped cream. If you want to order it, you have to tell us now because it takes a while to roast.""It all sounded very festive and of course i always want the dessert special. When it arrived, it reminded me of those luaus where they serve a whole roasted pig. There was the entire half of a pineapple, with stem and stalk and spines, roasted and glazed with a tamarind sauce that was only present in spirit. Topped with an aquafaba meringue. In a total anticlimax, it was OK. I will add a few notes about the whipped cream though. This is the vegan's answer to meringue!! I couldn't tell the difference. I know chickpea broth (aquafaba) has been taking the interwebz by storm in the past months, and might I add, for good reason.The other dessert, pushed to the background, one that had zero ceremony and was not much of a looker, was one of the most delicious luxurious ones I've had. Those who want their desserts only subtly sweet, those who are craving a parfait at dinner time, those who want silk in a cup - my friends, this is for you. 5 stars,Nix fulfills a niche that few restaurants in the city have caught on to - being merely accidentally vegetarian. They have a great format of family style dining, and a menu that doesn't run into pages. However, when you have but 20 items on your menu, I expect all of them to be stellar. Some were, some weren't.

As the third course, we had the cauliflower tempura on bao buns and shiitake cacio el pepe, both of which were amazing. There was a SE Asian/Indian flavor/feel to the cauliflower tempura, and when mixed with the radishes and pickles, and placed into the soft buns, it was amazing!

Having dined at both Narcissa and Dovetail, with the latter earned him another M star, I simply cannot wait but to have a brand new dining experience at his newly established place.No prex-fixe menu at Nix, so we sampled several small dishes. Loved the spiced eggplant dip came together with the piece of bread - the bread carried a light burnt taste, and went perfectly well with the slightly savory eggplant smashes. While one of our main dish - the tofu skin pocket, was a bit of a let-down (too sour!), we both loved the shiitake - that light touch of truffle scent was nothing but fantastic. Desserts were also underwhelming - both the chocolate mousse and the maple custard were way too sweet...There were lots of misses in this meal, but I still call it solid, solely due to its signature dish shiitake. In other words, one would probably better off by ordering this single dish and calling it a day. Decent juice too, but that was of secondary importance.I was only half convinced by your Michelin star, Nix. Please show me more.",10,6,8,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1221,1748,5633
4.0,12/15/2016,"This place is great and the ambiance is deserving of 5 stars. The inside is really hip and makes you feel hip too. The food is really good as well - we ordered the roasted eggplant spread and mint/curry spread for appetizers and they were easily the best thing I've eaten in quite a while (we paired them with the tandoor bread which was also a great choice).For the main course I split the egg salad, cauliflower tempura, and gnocchi with two of my friends. The cauliflower was definitely worth it but I'm hesitant to declare the gnocchi worth $30. The egg salad was yummy too but be warned that the habanero cream is actually pretty spicy.Cocktails were delicious and pretty strong and wait staff was really nice. I wouldn't recommend the chocolate mousse cake for dessert (not worth it in my opinion).Overall this place is really yummy, great for vegetarians and meat eaters alike, and just earned a Michelin star this year!!

I've had this dish at Dirt Candy, but also in lesser known vegan diners in the suburbs of Boston. Adding steamed buns to this dish does not qualify it for fine dining or justify the $18 price. The tofu-skin pockets with sweet potato I've also had in a suburban vegan diner. It was tasty, but not revolutionary and not worth $16. In short: the food is good, but uninspired and overpriced.

4.0,12/9/2016,"Modern, slightly quirky, slightly upscale vegan. I definitely had a unique, fun experience here.This restaurant is more tapas/sharing style, with lots of small dishes categorized under ""cold"" and ""hot"". My boyfriend and I shared 3 things and it was the perfect amount.Tandoori bread with artichoke mint curry dip. Bread was not that impressive - I was expecting fluffy and chewy but it was definitely more flat and crispy. The dip was super interesting, but somehow the minty and curry flavors worked really well together. It was $11 total for the bread and dip, which I thought was overpriced for what we got.Cauliflower tempura buns: I personally loved this way more than I expected to. The cauliflower was made in such a way that it tasted just like, if not better than, meat! There was a definite umami flavor which paired perfectly with the creamy side dip. Bun itself was soft and fluffy and slightly sweet.Gnocchi: amazing! So creamy and pillowy, with such a strong truffle taste. There were some crispy pieces on top too, which provided a nice contrast in texture.Service was nice, but a bit cold. I thought it was interesting how all the women wore kimono like dresses and all the men also had on matching outfits.

Quite a lovely way to start the meal.Next we had the brussel sprout salad with roasted squash, golden raisins and almonds.  It was a great, fresh taste and also a nice, light start.  The variety of textures in the salad made it a bit more interesting than your average brussel sprout.The roasted maitake mushroom with truffle butter and tempura cauliflower were next.  The latter was a recommended dish from the waitress who said it was a house speciality.  You get a plate of tempura cauliflower in a spicy sweet sauce, and then place it inside a teamed bun to make a sandwich.  The sauce was zesty and balanced, with a nice kick to compliment the smooshy steamed bun.  This was the most surprising dish and also my favorite for the night.The maitake mushroom was lovely, it arrived in a skillet with roasted goodness at the bottom of the pan.  While I love mushrooms and the sauce was yummy, I'm not sure this dish was worth $22.  It was literally a small-ish mushroom, roasted.  While it was super yummy, I would try a different dish next time - maybe the butternut fry bread!I highly recommend this restaurant for a special meal, every day catch up spot, and new regular on my list of go-to's!",2,0,0,Katie G.,"Brooklyn, NY",64,198,317

There were no tables available and we didn't realize they took reservations but said we were welcome to sit at the bar which was fine by me. For starters, we shared walnut buns with cream cheese frosting. There were four in an order and they were done perfectly, not greasy and very flavorful with walnuts. The cream cheese frosting was perfect, not overly sweet and nice portion to dip our walnut buns into. I decided to order a Bloody Mary, and was told by our friendly server/bartender, Cody, that he made the mix himself.  It was a perfect Bloody Mary, his combination of ingredients was spot on. For our main entrees my daughter had the avocado toast on brioche bread, which was tasty. I had the mad hatter pie which was cranberry beans mashed and then made crispy, on top was a sunny side up egg and avocado and heirloom cherry tomatoes on the side. Portions are perfect, not huge and you don't feel grossly stuffed when done. This was a great little neighborhood find and will definitely come back.

I usually err on the side of caution when it comes to ""vegetable forward"" restaurants such as these as dishes usually end up being weird combinations of vegetables that don't go together; however, Nix's menu is innovative and everything we ordered made us wonder why we had never tried those combinations before. The service is attentive and the ambiance is hip/trendy without being pretentious.  We ordered the following:- Tandoor Bread with Red Pepper and Hummus: I'm generally skeptical of anything Indian made at a non-Indian restaurant but Nix's tandoor bread was fluffy, crispy, hot and fresh! We all have pretty high standards when it comes to hummus but Nix's did not disappoint. The red pepper dip really stole the show though, so much so that we considered ordering a second round of it for dessert...- Brown-Rice Stir Fry: This is on the lighter side as it was your standard stir fry dish. Nothing to write home about but we're glad we ordered it. - Cauliflower Tempura with Buns:This was great as the tangy-ness of the sauce went well with the natural sweetness of the bun. The white sauce on the side was good as well. I definitely recommend ordering this dish. - Charred Asparagus: The asparagus was cooked perfectly with the crepe and mushrooms!- Shitake Cacio E Pepe: Another great and innovative dish!

Obviously not many people were there at that hour, but the restaurant has a nice spacious feel, nonetheless, and we were seated in a 2-person booth, which was great since other diners weren't right on top of us.We took it easy on the cocktails and just had one drink each, but we were both very pleased with our choices: I got the Albion (fresh blackberry, juniper, lemon, mare gin) and he had the Peach & Love (fresh peaches, vodka, lemon, anise hyssop). Both were summery and refreshing, but I liked mine a little more. I think the anise in his threw me off.The food menu is divided into three sections: first order, lighter, and bolder. They recommend that you get some things from each section, but we opted to skip the first order section and just focus on the other two. So, we got the following dishes:--Heirloom tomatoes, nix cottage cheese & bitter leaves--The tomatoes and cottage cheese were delicious as was the dressing that coated them, but the bitter greens were too bitter for our liking and detracted from the rest of the flavors.--Chopped kale, beets, pistachios & aged goat cheese--A delicious, creamy kale salad. My only complaint is that there weren't many beets.--Baby carrots en papillote, cracked bulgur, almonds, moroccan spices--Beautiful presentation in a paper package. Great flavors with the spices and the almonds, but we both thought the dish would have been better if the carrots had been cooked more. They were pretty close to raw.--Yukon potato fry bread, highly decorated--This is basically a pile of fried dough, and I mean that in the best possible way. What's not to like? It melts in your mouth.--Shiitake ""cacio e pepe"" with green beans & creamy polenta--If you like mushrooms and polenta, you really can't go wrong here. Lovely woodsy flavor.Five dishes was plenty of food for us to share, so we skipped dessert. We both liked everything overall and thought the service was good as well. They were very on top of changing out plates and silverware with each course, and there were no significant lags between courses.We're looking forward to returning later in the year.",1,0,0,Leslie G.,"Brooklyn, NY",129,278,28

4.0,8/18/2016,"I went here for a birthday celebration on a recent Wednesday night. My reservation was for 6:45 and we were seated promptly. The restaurant is not as crowded as I expected based on other Yelp reviews and the noise level is about average for a NYC restaurant. The waiter was quick to explain the way the menu works, offering suggestions of ordering one to two selections from each section of the menu (first order, lighter, and bolder). We chose the Tandoor bread (they offer a vegan version, as well) with two dips: Spiced eggplant, pine nuts and the Avocado, mint & curry; the Yukon potato fry bread, highly decorated; Cauliflower tempura and steamed buns, house pickles. The Tandoor bread was thin and crispy with a pool of olive oil and spices in the center. It proved to be a good vehicle for the two dips, of which I preferred the avocado. The mint is refreshing and the curry adds a little spice to the avocado base. The eggplant was a little harder to dip but the pine nuts added a nice crunch. We chose to skip the lighter course, as nothing immediately jumped out but in hindsight, we should have chosen one instead of the potato fry bread. While the potato fry bread is good, it is really nothing more than a loaded baked potato. It is ""highly decorated"" with sour cream, cheese, radishes, and broccoli. It is difficult to eat more than one small portion as it is heavy and rich, so I would suggest this dish only if you have a party of 3-4. The Cauliflower Tempura was EXCELLENT. As I do not eat pork, I've never had a steamed pork bun but I imagine this is a wonderful substitute. It came with various toppings--pickles, beets, radishes, and mayonnaise. I enjoyed creating my own little cauliflower buns, and I'd definitely return for this dish. We finished the meal with the Tandoor-roasted pineapple with macademia nuts, toasted coconut, and a cashew-whipped cream (vegan!), which you must order at the beginning of your meal as it takes 30 minutes. I am obsessed with everything pineapple and while it was a bit sweet, it was a lovely ending to the meal. To drink, I had the Peach and Love, which was nothing remarkable. They offer the option of still or sparkling water at the beginning of the meal and they keep your glass full throughout the entire meal. Service was impeccable.",1,0,0,G H.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,18,5

Great right-sized menu with the right amount of options for both vegans and vegetarians. Excellent place for splitting plates so everyone at the table can taste a variety of dishes. Highly recommend the lighter fare watermelon dish and the maple custard with huckleberries. Our waitress was attentive without being annoying.

1.0,8/13/2016,"An awful experience. We were incredibly uncomfortable because the lack of air conditioning, the very crowded table, and the terrible service. The air conditioning wasn't working and it was unbearably hot. The manager promised they'd do what they could, but they didn't bother - they could have put out fans, or at least refilled our water. In fact, when I asked the sommelier for more water, she actually rolled her eyes.Despite a reservation, our party of seven was seated at a table for four, so we were forced to sit sidewise to eat! The food was uneven, but certainly not designed for sharing like they advertised, there were too many flavors in each dish to only have a bite of each. This was supposed to be a birthday celebration, and instead it was a $400 sweaty uncomfortable evening.",1,0,0,Lita C.,"Boston, MA",0,18,0
5.0,8/12/2016,"My wife and I, long time east village residents, finally scored a reservation at Nix tonight. Honestly, I am normally meh about vegetarian food, it just always sounds better than it is. But I must say Nix was so far superior to any other vegetarian restaurant we have ever eaten at, or most any other kind of restaurant we've eaten at for that matter. And that's coming from two extremely discerning consumers who are no strangers to fine dining. Not one thing disappointed, from the service, to the ambiance, to the drinks and wine, to the creative and excellent food.We were welcomed  by wonderful greeters and our server, Dominique, couldn't have been nicer or more helpful in advising us of our food choices. The restaurant is so pretty and we were seated at a great table. We could hear each other speak the whole time without needing to scream, which is an anomaly in the village. We loved the tandoori bread and hummus - both great, great. We then had the carrots which were the best carrots we have ever eaten. They were cooked in paper, fabulous. We loved the kale salad and I normally hate  kale and the present kale frenzy which I blame on being imported from the skinny people in LA.We were already stuffed (we're Little women) but then moved on to the cauliflower with buns - can't even begin to describe how delicious those were. The cauliflower  had a smoky robust flavor and putting them into the steamed buns was a bit like a Momofuko event. Lastly we had the brown rice with mushrooms and an egg which we loved but could barely touch, we were so full.We brought home lots of leftovers which we plan on eating again tomorrow.As an anniversary gift Dominique offered us a wonderful custard which we didn't think we could eat but was so light and delicious we were able to scoff it all down.

5.0,8/1/2016,"This place is pretty great. Being a vegetarian I love places that can execute a satisfying and flavorful meal with no meat involved. I have dined here with carnivores who enjoy themselves fully and don't feel the need to grab a street hot dog after our meal. The Cauliflower buns are delicious, full flavor and big delicious chunks of sweet and savory cauliflower- I never want to share. My favorite has to be the polenta- so rich and creamy, with a robust meaty flavor from the mushrooms. I had skipped dessert my first go, and upon my second visit learned what a horrid mistake that was. My friend and I split the donut dessert dish which was MINDBLOWING. Custard-y and rich yet light little popovers with the most scrumptious dipping sauces. It was like eating little orgasmic clouds. We literally couldn't stop moaning as we ate them.. it was probably quite disturbing to people dining nearby. That being said, they do pack the tables in PRETTY tight (hence disturbing our neighbors so easily with our dessert-moans of delight), and both times I have found the waitstaff to almost be attentive to a fault- they were VERY pushy both times with trying to upsell us and they look like they belong in a cult with their matching robes. However- very enjoyable and can't wait to continue to go back.",0,2,1,Angelique L.,"Manhattan, NY",234,53,0
5.0,8/1/2016,"I like vegetables. I really do. They look very nice in small quantities next to large pieces of meat. I'm even lucky enough to have gone to restaurants that source fresh and delicious ones and prepare them so well that I actually enjoy eating them. All that said, it is truly, truly rare that I so thoroughly enjoy an entire meal sans meat. Granted, my wife essentially tricked me into dinner here, but good work, Nix.Good work in renovating this simple, elegant room and making the most of your space (the hostess stand is six or seven millimeters away from the door, and there's no room at the bar for drinking, as it's packed with diners).Good work on training your staff. The service was essentially perfect, although the patterned kimono things that the ladies wear is a little weird.Good work on the truly interesting cocktail list, and I'm glad that I can get a decent martini as well.Good work in the tandoor bread and all the dips. I would happily eat this bread and the various dips until I die of a bread and dip overdose. Good work on the charred pineapple dessert, the tangy tomato water that the avocado a la plancha comes swimming in, the rich and wonderful mushroom ""cacio e pepe,"" and those cauliflower tempura buns with the perfect pickley touch. Good work on that egg salad dish. With the layer of habañero cream, and the potato crispies on top, it hits all my salty, crunchy, spicy cravings all at once.And overall, thank you for making a vegetarian restaurant that doesn't suffer from some misguided need to make everything healthy. That's not why we go out to eat. If I want healthy vegetables, I can steam them at home and I don't have to pay a restaurant markup.

If you are are a lifelong vegetarian that appreciates flavor, taste and is looking for something new or innovative then Nix is a big disappointment in all respects. The highlight of our evening were the glasses of white wine we ordered and excellent table service by our waiter.Food was so pedestrian and unimaginative, unsatisfying that we went for a slice of pizza after our dinner. We will think twice about following the NYT's recommendation next time on a veg place.

We started with a few cocktails; Peach & Love, the Playa and the Honeybee- all were sweet, almost nectary in flavor.  Would recommend the Honeybee for a summery, refreshing drink.We started our meal with the 4 dips platter which was excellent, with big love to the spiced eggplant and pine nuts dip. The dips come with a large piece of charred, spice tandoor bread which wasn't too heavy for an appetizer, I would recommend it for sure.We ordered 6 different dishes for our meal but the standouts for our table were definitely the Potato gnocchi dish and the outstanding, I MEAN OUTSTANDING charred asparagus, spring onion crepe, creamy morels dish which blew our table away and we ended up ordering it again for desert- true story! We loved it.We didn't stay for desert, preferred to get ice cream elsewhere to beat the summer heat. In summary- come to Nix with vegetarian happy, explorative eaters. There is a TON of flavor in these recipes and each dish is a little different from what the menu might suggest, we often struggled to identify the dish from the menu description.

2.0,7/25/2016,"Here is a review of what we had:Nan bread: good, but too many dry herbs on it. Red pepper and nuts dip: very liquid with a lot of vinegar... Feels more like a salad dressing.Avocado and curry dip: terrible... Just smashed avocado covered in curry powder... Way to pungent. No one at the table was able to have this. I actually spit it out. Cacio e pepe: good dish but there is so much pepper your mouth and throat will burn.Cauliflower tempura: the sauce is too tangy and sweet and covered in poppy seeds... The taste is too aggressive and doesn't really go with the cauliflower and bun combo.Yukon bread: basically fried bread with tiny pieces of potato in it and covered in sour cream and parmesan and shredded broccoli. It was good but too oily to have more than a few bites. I am sorry for such a negative review but vegetarian doesn't mean you have to throw all the spices and fat you have in the kitchen into you dishes.

3.0,7/25/2016,"Went for a birthday dinner on 7/21 and all the staff was very nice and polite, MINUS THE WAITRESS. She was horrible! I could not believe how much she was rushing us, that I almost was going to talk to someone about it. We ordered some of the fresh sodas, which she didn't even mix before pouring, so all the flavor was on the bottom. We ordered several starters, and in doing so, she demanded we let her know if we want the ""special"" dessert of the 1/4 pineapple. She kept switching her words sometimes saying it takes 20 minutes and other times saying it takes 30 minutes to prepare. I told her I'd like to think about it and discuss it with my partner before putting in the order, as he was on the phone. I also mentioned that anyways we're just putting in the orders for the starters and will be ordering our food in a little bit, so I'm sorry, audience, you tell me if I'm wrong, but in my mind when we put in the orders for our entrees, that gives plenty of time to bring us the food and still have time for the damn dessert to be made if we wanted it. As soon as he hung up I began to try to tell him what she was talking to me about, and as soon as I spit out 3 words, she was back at our table in our face asking if we made a decision! I was literally shocked and getting very angry at this point. I said no, I was just discussing it with him, and she cut me off and began describing the dessert to him. We were so irritated that we just told her no, we will just order from the dessert menu. At one point, she even came and grabbed our glasses. I don't know what her problem was, but we had several others refill our water or fold the napkins, or bring the food out, and she was the only one with a stick up her ass! She made the entire dinner unpleasant. Now onto the food...the food was delicious, and everything had very distinctive flavors. We ordered the tandoor bread with spiced eggplant, labneh and avocado mint curry. All was yum! I saw someone posted a pic of a stuffed bread n that looked delicious, but did not see either the bread or chimichurri on the menu. In the lighter foods, we ordered the jicama, which was light and refreshing, but packed some heat, if your sensitive. The Persian cucumbers, which did not taste like Persian cucumbers because they taste better than regular cucumbers and this was nothing special. It had a lot of the jerk spices on it, which in not used to that flavor, so I wasn't crazy fond of it, but it wasn't bad. We ordered the Yukon potato fry bread and cauliflower tempura to go and ate it at home. The cauliflower tempura, maybe because it wasn't straight out of the oven, was nothing that great...the flavor was ok. The Yukon potato fry was odd....very oily and remained very crispy till we ate it at home. This had a weird bitter taste and was heavy. Not sure what's inside of it, but if you like that kind of thing, than go for it! We ordered the chocolate mousse cake and the maple custard. Both were amazing! The mousse was not too chocolatey but just enough for my taste, and it almost was crunchy, not really like a mousse texture. Wasn't crazy about the amaro and passion fruit sauce on the plate, I liked the cake on its own. The maple was also amazing, if you don't like chocolate, get this, I'd say screw the 1/4 pineapple broiled with coconut cream and slivered almonds  All in all, nothing was extra memorable, especially for the prices and shitty service (by the one waitress) is go back for some of the items, but I'd be careful whose helping me!",3,0,1,golnaz b.,"Union City, NJ",8,39,38

Because our food is kinda of too heavy and greasy, we decide to go for real green salad instead of dessert. The lettuce plate is small, and doesn't worth $13 because it's so simple and plain.

A light, satisfying dish ... perfectly paired with my dessert which was my main intention when coming into Nix.I got the chocolate mousse cake with amaro and passionfruit sauce. This was good, but did not wow me. Very chocolatey. I wished there was something on the plate to balance it out a bit--perhaps a light vanilla (or some other, less decadent flavor) ice cream. I also expected (and was hoping for) more mousse, but it was more like a small roll cake with less mousse/cream filling. The sauce was very interesting, but still was not a huge wow thing for me. I'm also not a huge fan of fruit with chocolate (but I keep convincing myself that this will change) ... this was intriguing, but it did not change me.Other things on the menu looked really good--want to try that brown rice asparagus egg dish next time! The maple custard sounds good, too, as do the hummus and other dips.Also was a huge fan of the bathroom wallpaper decor",1,0,0,Sohee C.,"New York, NY",7,61,76
4.0,6/22/2016,"Stopped in here for drinks and tapas with a friend and was not disappointed!First round: the Honeybee was amazing. I'm a big sake fan and this combo with gin, Thai basil, and clover honey made for an incredible flavor profile. Next I tried the Valentine, a unique combination of vodka, rose water, and almond milk.For snacks we ordered the popular tandoor bread with labneh cucumber dip and red pepper walnut dip. It was a great combination as the spice of the red pepper was balanced by the cooling yogurt in the labneh- my only complaint is that the tandoor bread is certainly not a large enough portion size to satisfy both dips. All in all a lovely experience, recommend to anyone looking to splurge for adventurous drinks and food with an emphasis on vegetables and spices.",0,0,0,Karen C.,"Manhattan, NY",488,7,9

4.0,6/14/2016,"KenScale: 8.5/10What happens when a celebrated chef known for his vegetable dishes partners with a former editorial director of an influential lifestyle magazine? If you have heard that for the first time, you would expect something like a haven for yoga pants wearing, model-figure vegetarian diners out there. I've always been a fan of chef John Fraser, where I have witnessed how vegetable dishes are done right at his Dovetail and Narcissa restaurants. Chef Fraser has shown that vegetables don't have to be boring, and in fact a lot of creative ideas and techniques can come out from the kitchen. When he decided to open a new vegetarian restaurant Nix with former Conde Nast editorial director James Truman, I knew I had to check out this restaurant. On my recent weekend visit, chef Fraser has shown that he hasn't missed a step when it comes to playful yet thoughtful vegetarian cuisine.If you think Nix is going to be all kale salad, you would be sorely disappointed. I was deeply impressed with the way the kitchen was putting together beautifully plated dishes that show that a vegetarian meal can be fun. Any meal at Nix must begin with tandoori bread with a dip or two. My dining companion and I absolutely enjoyed the dip of spiced eggplant that came with pine nuts as well as avocado accompanied by mint and curry. The unexpected mix of different ingredients proved to be quite successful. Baby carrots en papillote where the carrots along with cracked bulgur, almonds and spices were placed in a folded pouch was magnificent as well, with all the ingredients inside the pouch creating very balanced flavor and texture. The Yukon potato fry bread that everyone seems to be talking about these days was surprisingly pedestrian (to be fair, I think the whole concept of fry bread is this fancy idea that has yet to be executed perfectly as I have also witnessed at Covina), but there was a lot of excitement from my part the moment I saw cauliflower tempura with steamed buns and house pickles. Inspired by the Chinese steamed buns, I actually liked the cauliflower better in its crunchy texture by itself without somehow compromising it with the steamed buns. For someone who has become a regular consumer of cauliflower, I do think this dish should be on everyone's table. Who says vegetable dishes can't generate rich flavor? Shiitake ""cacao e pepe"" with green beans and creamy polenta was pure decadence that had all the richness of a pasta without overpowering your palate. Don't skip the dessert, either. Tandoor roasted pineapple was another show stopper at the restaurant where, combined with tamarind glaze, vegan whipped cream and macadamia, the dish became quite a delight to end the meal in a very satisfying fashion.Getting a reservation can be pretty tricky at this hot spot that has been open for a couple of months now yet still going strong, so make sure to book in advance. I absolutely loved the clean décor of the dining space that makes you feel like you're eating at a bright cottage just next to the garden, full of energy without being rowdy. Nix has full bar with some creative, vegetable-inspired cocktail options that I highly encourage to complement your meal. Nix is another winner from chef Fraser and I would absolutely love to come back here to explore the depth of the vegetable feast that the kitchen is putting together.",1,0,0,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

We also ordered the egg salad and avocado from the lighter section. The egg salad was my FAVORITE dish there. The habanero added some surprise spice to the dish and the potatoes were nice and crunchy. The avocado dish was super flavorful. For mains we got the shiitake and cauliflower dishes.

3.0,5/28/2016,"Firstly I have to commend the service in this restaurant. Secondly, the food was very good and on that basis alone, I would be inclined to come back. The Shiitake 'cacio e pepe' was the best dish of the evening but I enjoyed everything else as well. The restaurant was quiet when we arrived at about 18h00, but extremely noisy by the time we left. I guess that is to be expected at most popular restaurants. My only real complaint - and hence the omission of two further stars, was the overall price of the dishes. Way too expensive for a vegetarian restaurant. Certainly going to exclude the university crowd and at $140 for two, I will not be back in a hurry",0,0,0,Claudio F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0
3.0,5/26/2016,"I wanted to love this place. I really did. Instead, I left with a bag of mixed feelings.THE GOOD1. The dips were absolutely delicious and I highly recommend them. We got the Red Pepper and Walnut dip along with the Avocado, Mint and Curry dips with tandoor bread. Word to the wise, the bread is maybe enough for one dip and we ended up getting veggies to finish it off (more on that below).2. The food really is a celebration of vegetables and I LOVED that. The Baby carrots en papillote, cracked bulgur, almonds, spices was serviceable (I mean, we did eat all of it so it wasn't awful), but my real favorite was the Cauliflower tempura and steamed buns, house pickles. Definitely get those!3. The cocktails weren't a terrible price (for NYC) and they were quite delicious. We were happy with our selections of the Baja, the Oakland, and the Hopscotch.4. The decor was white and very trendy. I'd probably move in.THE BAD1. It's ridiculously loud. Maybe I'm a cranky grandma at heart, but I'm not a fan of yelling at my dinner partner just to be heard.2. The staff tried to upsell us on EVERYTHING. It got to the point where I realized that none of the 3 people stopping by our table were actually trying to be helpful and recommend items that they absolutely felt like we couldn't miss. Instead, they pretty much just wanted us to order more, more, MORE. And dude, your restaurant is pricey enough. 3. Speaking of being pricey, the Pea green dumplings, maitake mushroom, white asparagus was the most expensive item we ordered at $25 and it was far and away the most disappointing. We only ordered it upon recommendation of the waitress, who we trusted way too early on to steer us well (see point above).4. Not only did it feel like they were always trying to get us to order more, when it became clear that we were full and happy, it was time to rush us out of there. Despite them taking forever to deliver our food, once our check was dropped and everything was cleared away immediately, including the half finished bottle of water. Come on, now only was that annoying, but you're probably going to toss the water out so it wasn't even environmentally conscious of you. At least let me finish the water.So all in all, (mostly) amazing and innovative vegetable-based dishes with delicious cocktails at a high price point and kind of annoying service.",6,1,2,Kristin K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,0
3.0,5/25/2016,"I felt really cool eating here. It's loud, it's dark, the servers are all wearing some kind of weird pinafore apron, and there are many delicious vegetables. The things I had, in order from my favorite to least favorite:-Tandoor bread: YES. Order at least one for your dip and then another to mop up your delicious sauces from other dishes. - Persian cucumbers: Probs the best cucumbers I've had in life. - Roasted pineapple dessert: mmm caramelized fruity goodness. Not sure why it comes with the huge knife, considering that it's already sliced. -Tofu skin pockets: kind of a weird texture, and the least- sweet sweet potato-containing dish I have had in recent memory, but definitely satisfied my desire for something meaty-Avocado, mint, curry: kind of forgetable tbh -Shiitake cacio e pepe: I really wanted to like this, but it was all the things I don't like about mushrooms-- funky, rubbery, smoky, blah. Might have just been the insufferable wall street bros next to me or the fact that their taps were broken and I didn't get to try the very delicious sounding cider they had, but I wasn't as crazy about this place as my sometimes vegetarian dining companion was.

I usually avoid purely vegetarian restaurants, even though I am one, because they tend to be boring and flavorless, punishment food for those who don't want to kill animals. But the chef at Nix has brought us a dazzling array of dishes - the Yukon fry bread, the pea-leaf dumplings - that do the marvelous things with vegetables that other master chefs do with meat. The planet has a happy future if all meat-lovers could be exposed to food like this.The service, too, was excellent, and showed in one small detail: they bring you a fresh, cold bottle of sparkling water when you're three-quarters down on the old one.The seats are very comfortable (try to get the two-person booths) and the lighting conducive to intimate conversation.

I had some dips as an appetizer, the tofu skin dish, and the cauliflower buns. All were incredibly delicious! I also enjoyed my gin cocktails. The aesthetic was clean and modern and I liked the little touches such as the paper flowers at each table. It gets very busy very fast, so try to make a reservation if you can.

My only request to the restaurant would be to give more than 1 piece of tandoor bread, for $5 you only get one piece that's about the size of a small tortilla.  Not enough for 2 dips.I could get into how delicious everything was, but I think that's a given at this point. I can't wait to go back again and try more dishes, I'm really impressed with how innovative and tasty all the vegetarian dishes were.  I've been trying a lot of new ""farm to table"" restaurants that feature vegetarian entrees - but the quality and craftsmanship when it comes to the vegetables are never up to my standards (especially when they're charging $26 for a plate of mushy, steamed asparagus with a side of salad - I'm looking at you Blackbarn!).My one question for Nix is - are the vegetables/ingredients all organic, local or sustainably sourced?  If they're not, maybe you should consider using ingredients that are locally sourced, organic and grown without chemical pesticides - that would really take the restaurant to a new level!Thanks for the delicious meal, Nix.

The food itself I'd say is a 4, but I'm subtracting two stars, one for how ridiculously expensive it is and one for how small the portions are. I'm already abstaining from meat, you might as well give me a little more to make up for the lack of protein. I should say that I am not a vegetarian, my friend is, but for a non-vegetarian, I quite liked some of the menu items - I thought they were very inventive and and tasty and very fresh.We started out with cocktails, I loved my Honey Bee (Thai basil, clover honey, gin, sake) - light, a bit sweet and refreshing. My girlfriends liked their cocktails as well. We ordered the tandoor bread (which I recommend highly) with three of the dips: spiced eggplant with pine nuts, labneh & marinated cucumbers, and avocado with mint & curry - all three were excellent.From the lighter portion of the menu, the Persian cucumber salad was fantastic. From the bolder portion of the menu, the shiitake ""cacio e pepe"" with salsify & heirloom polenta was good - the shiitake mushrooms were divine, I could've eaten a whole bowl of that, but the rest of the ingredients in the dish were a bit on the bland side. The cauliflower tempura and steamed buns with house pickles was a total miss for me. The cauliflower did not resemble or even taste like cauliflower. The pickles were my favorite part of that dish and that's pretty sad. $82 later, I was still a bit hungry and felt like I had eaten nothing more than bread and salad.Would I encourage you to try it for yourself, sure, especially if you're vegetarian.

Could use some shredded chili peppers maybe for contrast, but pretty good.--Morels with asparagus, shishito peppers, barley and poached egg: The best of spring. A nice counterpoint to some of the heavier dishes.--Drinks: Had the mango-paprika soda and a gin cocktail, both respectable but not mind-blowing.Finally, a note on the prices. On the one hand, some of the dishes seem too expensive for vegetables and bread. On the other, the caliber of cooking is high, and the veggies are all sourced from Union Square Greenmarket, where produce and eggs can be very spendy, so can't complain too much.",1,0,1,Jeff O.,"Manhattan, NY",274,278,702

5.0,4/22/2016,"Nix deserves all the accolades attached to being Michelin-star chef John Fraser's restaurant, but EVEN MORE because it's a top contender in a saturated market of vegan restaurants in NYC. My take is that Nix is better than Dirt Candy, Blossom, Peacefood Cafe, Avant Garden, Franchia, and Champs Diner. Though I've never been to Candle 79, my date said Nix was definitely better.It's now my favorite vegan restaurant in NYC. If we're talking best vegan restaurants on the East Coast, the almighty Vedge in Philly has only a slim margin on Nix. Here's my rationale:1. Food - You MUST start with the Tandoor Bread + hummus/zaatar and avocado/mint/curry dips. Flavorful masterpieces. Can't get more savory and saliva-inducing. Cauliflower Tempura with steamed buns/house pickles easily takes the title as best entree in regards to uniqueness, taste, and mind-blowingness. I could eat the Tofu-Skin Pockets with kabocha squash/quinoa/beans/pepita salsa every day for dat protein. Eggplant broccoli rabe stir-fry with preserved tomatoes is a solid dish with a kick and smokiness. Yasssss.2. Dessert - You MUST save room for dessert or else you won't experience the best vegan desserts I have tasted to date: Chocolate mousse cake (made with avocados) with amaro/passion fruit and Fuji apple sorbet with candied olives/lime. Not overbearingly sweet, full bodied richness, and delightful flavor contrast.3. Ambience and Service - Beautiful modern layout and eclectic, warm decor. Classy and hip music vibes with great acoustics. Unpretentiously dressed waitstaff who deliver incredibly attentive service - everything from clearing the plates for the next course to filling the water. The team was a well-oiled machine. Our server was super friendly and offered killer recommendations on the menu.TL;DR - You MUST come to Nix if you eat a plant-based diet or you just want to be healthier.

3.0,4/21/2016,"Thought we were going the healthy route with the vegetarian theme, but every dish turned out to be decadent and indulgent - delicious, but undeniably too rich. Many items are fried or dressed in abundant cream and sauces (not to mention the chefs were extremely heavy-handed with the salt), which made it difficult to finish any of the dishes.We went with the waitress's advice of ordering three dishes for the each of us, and we left feeling uncomfortably full, and not in a good way. Would definitely recommend starting with ordering less and adding on more if you're still hungry.- Tandoor bread with dips: we ordered three. Avocado dip was by far the best - creamy but well balanced with mint to lift the flavor. Labneh and eggplant are both nothing special.- Jicama: the lightest out of the items we ordered. Very delicious and nicely balanced with chili and oranges, which add a welcome spice and citrus flavoring to an otherwise very salty meal.- Beets: when this came out of the ""lighter"" menu, there was a cause for concern for what's on the ""bolder"" menu.  Main problem was the salt - we have had plenty of variations on the beet / goat cheese / pistachio theme before, but none quite as salty. The dish is also slathered in yogurt, which was much closer to cream than some 0% Chobani y'all might be thinking about and lacked the tanginess the dish needed. Pistachios also didn't help to make the dish lighter either.- Tofu-skin pockets: had to order this to be remade because it was inconsumably salty the first time around. Second time was a little better, but still on the saltier side. If you could get past the salt, the dish is actually very delicious and a modern take on enchiladas, filled with delicious butternut squash and black beans. These aren't small puppies either - one is more than enough to get a fill of the flavor, and the plate comes with three.- Shiitake ""cacio e pepe"": shiitake, polenta, and cheese are all among my favorite food items, so I thought this dish could have been heaven on earth. However, it is extremely delicious, but rich to the point you cannot really quite eat more than two or three bites. The mushrooms are very meaty, but lacked the texture or flavor to cut through the very creamy polenta. Wish there was something that could lighten up the flavor a bit (common theme). Service was decent, ambience modern and sleek, and the place is definitely popular (easily filled on a Monday evening), but most of the dishes just did not seem balanced, almost as if because everything was vegetarian there was an excuse to go even heavier with cream and salt. Compared to other new vegetarian places that are making it hot (e.g. Avant Garden, Wassail, etc.), left feeling like one of the most gluttonous meals in recent memory.",2,0,0,Chenxi L.,"Manhattan, NY",574,14,41

5.0,4/12/2016,"This week's fashionplate keeps things light and healthy.  I love indulging in decadent meals as well as eating clean and healthy.  I've been wanting to check out the new vegetarian restaurant on University Place- Nix.  My dining companion got a ressie here around 7:30 and the place was packed for early in the week.  We opted for a nice red wine and started with a few of the dips with both the bread and veggies.  The eggplant was our favorite but the hummus and labneh were also amazing.  Then we moved on to the jicama salad and the roasted cucumbers, both which were amazing.  We obviously had to get the greatly touted fry bread and this was basically an orgasm in your mouth.  The tofu skin pockets were also great and similar to enchiladas.  The spinach and dandelion pie was also amazing.  We were stuffed but there are still more things I will definitely be back to try.  This might be my new favorite veggie resto.The crowd was more gender balanced than most veggie places because Nix has delicious plant based foods that even meat eaters adore.  I rocked our new Katy leopard print blouse which matched perfectly with our booth as you can see.",3,2,4,Sascha M.,"New York, NY",593,822,7
4.0,4/11/2016,"Solid 4 stars. After reading that John Fraser, the Michelin-starred chef behind Narcissa and Dovetail, was opening a new restaurant near Union Square, I had to give it a try. I don't profess to know of that many highly-touted chefs, but after trying both of his restaurants, I was reasonably assured that our experience at Nix would be up to par, and I have to say, it was. The menu is completely vegetarian, with some vegan offerings as well. The inside is pretty bright, spacious and nicely lit, and the vibe is pretty good for both casual get-togethers, and the two-person booths make it also a good place for a date.We got the stuffed tandoori bread special, which came with some kale chimichurri. Incredibly cheesy, and the chimichurri was an excellent contrast to the richness. In addition, we also got the red pepper and walnut dip, Yukon potato fry bread, cauliflower tempura steamed buns, and the shitake ""cacio e pepe"", which was actually made with polenta instead of pasta. The dip was very smooth and nicely spiced, the fry bread was rich and delicious, and the cauliflower tempura was very crispy and flavorful. I'm really enjoying how I'm seeing fry bread on more menus these days, even if it just fried dough. However, the star of the meal, in my opinion, was the shitake polenta. The mushrooms had a nice subtle flavor, and the polenta was silky, rich, and incredibly satisfying. I could have kept eating that over and over. Service was very friendly and attentive, although there was just a little bit too much of the waitstaff milling around doing nothing, which was a little disconcerting. I'm fully aware that they were also trying to train some of the new staff, but it just made the space a little cramped and having some of the staff wait around our table was a little uncomfortable. Prices were reasonable for the portions, although I wouldn't particularly recommend their cocktails, since the ones we ordered were both incredibly weak.Very glad I gave Nix a chance, and would easily recommend it for vegetarians looking for something a little heartier. I'll likely be back when I have vegetarian friends visiting, or if I want some really bomb polenta. Hoo wee.",46,26,45,Eric J.,"New York, NY",490,923,1792
4.0,4/7/2016,"I'm so happy to see more and more trendy vegetarian restaurants opening up!  Even though I am not a vegetarian, I am a health food and veggie lover.  My two girlfriends and I had dinner at Nix last night.  Both the location and atmosphere of the restaurant are great.  The one downside to our experience was that our waitress was a tad pushy.  She kept insisting that what we ordered to share wouldn't be enough.. but indeed it was.We started with the raw veggies and two dips - red pepper & walnut and the spiced eggplant with walnuts.  I liked the eclectic selection of veggies and the beautiful rich color of the red pepper & walnut spread.  Both were very flavorful and nice to start with.We then had the winter kale salad and the wok roasted cucumbers.  The wok roasted cucumbers were spectacular!  I loved the jerk glaze and touch of candied kumquats.  Would love to replicate this dish at home!And for our main courses, we shared the tofu-skin pockets and the eggplant/broccoli rabe stir-fry.  The tofu-skin pockets were hearty and delicious - we enjoyed them very much.  The eggplant/broccoli rabe stir-fry was good too, but I probably would have opted for something lighter in flavor like the spring pea dumplings?  Keep in mind that there are a ton of strong flavors in each dish, so it's best to balance your plates with milder options too.It's not often I try a new restaurant in NY that I'm willing to go back to, but Nix is definitely a place you must try once!",3,1,3,Danielle M.,"New York, NY",396,512,41

(4.5 stars maybe not the full on 5 :-)  Our server was very sweet - she made the recommendation as first timers to choose the tandoor bread, two dips, two lighter dishes, and two boulder dishes to share for two people and helped us with our selections (everything vegan).  Summary:  The FLAVOR was - wow.  My boyfriend who is a self described cucumber hater loved the cucumber dish on the lighter fare - I'm not even sure he knew he was eating cucumbers.  Everything was truly delicious but it was a LOT of food to recommend/order for two people.  After the dips, drinks, and the lighter dishes we were already full and couldn't believe we still had our boulder dishes coming out.  By the time they arrived we tried to stuff down a few bites but were so full we couldn't even enjoy them.  I would definitely start with less and order more if you are still hungry!  On top of the delicious food - the space is really beautiful. I go to a lot of plant based restaurants and it's really nice to go to one that feels just like a nice restaurant - not a ""veggie restaurant"".  You know what I mean if you're a plant based diner! ;-)If I was going to critique...........-We arrived 3 minutes early (literally) of our 9:15 reservation and the host told us you're a bit early for your reservation perhaps you want to have a drink at the bar as your table is not quite finished up yet....It was pretty silly for the host to say we were early.  The table wasn't ready on time, that's fine!  Just say that. :-)-It would be nice to have menus at the table when seated.  We waited about 10+ minutes for our server to come over after being seated and since we already had drinks from the bar we had nothing to really consider/look at - especially after drooling over dishes we saw at the bar we were curious over what they were.  We could have looked at the menu and decided in that time.-Highly recommend that the bartenders watch their taste testing practices.  I know it gets busy but after seeing this at the bar we ordered wine and beer from then on...",1,1,0,Emma J.,"New York, NY",0,48,1
5.0,3/26/2016,"Absolutely surpasses the hype - insanely good, innovative and utterly delicious vegetarian and vegan food that non-veggies can enjoy too. The atmosphere and decor is cool and relaxed - not worthy and sanctimonious like many veggie places - the staff are super sweet, friendly, helpful and they know the menu - I went with a couple of their recommendations and was delighted I did. The dips are not to be missed, the apple and cabbage Asian salad was light and just divine and prepared me nicely for the mind-blowingly clever tofu skin pockets which were kind of like enchiladas and just bursting with flavour and so filling. Do not skip dessert - I had a special which was a caramelised quarter pineapple with macadamia nuts and vegan whipped cream. The only thing that disappointed me - and it is a very small and personal taste issue - was the relatively small number of drink options of you don't drink alcohol. There were, I think, five freshly prepared sodas - I had a plum and five spice which was beautiful and I would highly recommend- but I really wanted a basic juice. One of the owners, a kind and generous man named Peter, heard me complain and very kindly nipped out and got me an orange juice - so with that impeccable level of service combined with the outstanding food I don't imagine it'll be easy to get a booking but do yourself a favour and keep trying!!  I cannot wait to go back and have been telling everyone about it! For anyone who's been to Vanilla Black in London, this is literally like a million times better in every sense. Doesn't even compare.

5.0,3/20/2016,"My husband and I dined here last night (Sat) for the first time and absolutely loved it. Our waitress Dominique was incredibly patient with us, making suggestions of her favorite dishes and accommodating nut allergies. In addition to this place being vegetarian they have a separate vegan menu which they're happy to give you. The food was absolutely phenomenal, from the shared dip to the entrees, it's all very shareable and makes for a fun night. We made a 7p reservation on Open Table and when we got there, every table was full. The bar was also packed with people eating and drinking + they had a nice bowl of spiced pumpkin seeds to pick on while we waited. It feels like a southwestern vibe with rounded corners, greenery, and a warm moody ambiance. Even the bathrooms were sweet and thoughtful! Without hesitation we'll be back here but regardless of the day, I'll be sure to make a reservation.

4.0,3/16/2016,"If I could give 3.5 stars I would. Summary: The food was delicious and different, the cocktails were good, the service was awkward and not very hospitable but I guess they are new and working on it, the space was comfortable and airy and it was pretty pricey.I enjoyed my dinner here a lot. I love vegetables but I am not a vegetarian. If you are vegan, they have a vegan menu that has most the dishes on theI came to dinner here with a girlfriend. It was delicious, we ordered about 6 dishes between the two of us and only 1 was a major disappointment. The disappointing dish was Eggplant and broccoli rabe stir-fry, preserved tomatoes. It just was sad with a group of things on a plate that had nothing to say to each other and capers. I love eggplant, broccoli rabe and tomatoes so I thought it was going to be great but it was awful. We got 2 tandoori breads (one vegan, one not..my friend was experimenting with being a vegan that night so she had the vegan one) and all 4 vegan dips. The bread and dips were delicious, my favorite being the roasted red pepper one, the avocado one was a close second. I also had a baja cocktail which was delicious. The highlight of the dinner was the Cauliflower tempura and steamed buns, house pickles which was delicious, Maitake mushrooms, baby leeks, lentils was insane and the Wok-fried farro, brussels sprouts, hodo tofu was smoky and delicious. We had the grilled pineapple special dessert which was delicious as well. In total we were 2 girls, ordered ~6 dishes (4 dips, 2 breads, 4 dishes from bolder section and 1 dessert) with 2 cocktails and 1 glass of wine and with tips, tax (20%) we paid around ~180$. We have huge appetites and we were stuffed but we barely touched the eggplant dish. Service: the service was very awkward. When we first walked in, it was pretty empty (6 pm on a Thursday) but no one really greeted us until we greeted the host. Then we were taken to our table. Our waitress was a little pushy with drinks which is annoying bc maybe I dont want to drink! She also spilled wine on the table and me and made me feel very uncomfortable. When she asked us how we were doing at various points we were very positive and said great, everything is delicious but when we were served the eggplant dish we told her how disappointed we were with it and how we would not like to finish it and she just took it away awkwardly. Its a new restaurant, I would imagine any feedback to be helpful. She made us feel bad for not liking it. Anyway, overall a pricey meal but great place to go with a friend or group especially if they are veg forward. There is NO meat on this menu, just veggies, fruit, butter, cheese.At this price you can skip down to blue hill and sit at the bar and have their vegetable tasting menu which I believe is around $70, much better service as well.",3,0,1,Peggy J.,"New York, NY",6,127,87

5.0,3/14/2016,"Nix makes vegetables the star without trying to imitate meat. I've always found imitation meat a strange concept as I think vegetables can be delicious on its own and nix delivers. What's even better is that the menu doesn't play along with the traditional health norms of your everyday vegetarian meals; rather it leaves you fully satisfied and comforted. The menu incorporates a number of ethnic cuisines reinvented with a modern flare. Like the tandoor bread. Even the avocado dip comes with a sprinkle of curry spices, which is interesting and positively delicious. It's a must. The cauliflower tempera buns are a play on the famous pork buns so you would think it's set up for a disaster but oh boy, I was pleasantly surprised. Who knew fried cauliflower would do so well with steamed buns?! But the sauce is what threw me off my chair. You just have to try it for your own. As a warning, it has a small kick so be aware! The farro is a crowd pleaser for sure. It nails the Asian flavors of fried rice especially with the egg on top. Most people forget that we Asians like to add an egg to top off most of our rice dishes so it was a nice touch. For dessert, don't forget the Nun's puffs. They are like zeppole but lighter and softer. What I loved is that it didn't have the heavy feeling associated with most fried dough so you can feel SOMEWHAT guilt free ordering. And who wouldn't enjoy caramel to top it off? Literally brilliant. Fried dough with caramel is the way to my heart. In terms of service, my waiter was super knowledgeable. She knew the menu like the back of her hand and recommended amazing dishes which also happened to be my favorites of the night. I realize for a vegetarian restaurant it might seem high, but compared to what it normally costs to eat John's food at the other restaurants, its comparably affordable.

4.0,3/13/2016,"Nix is yet another vegetarian place with food so good that you won't mind that you're not eating meat.Like a lot of vegetarians places though, the food here is very pricey. For example, the Winter Kale Salad is pretty tiny and goes for a whopping $14, but it is better than most any similar salads that you see on every menu these days.If you don't want to break the bank on a few greens to start, the Tandoor Bread is also a must order to start ($5). You'll need at least one dip to go with it, which go for $4 each, and are more satisfying than the alternative of a small bowl of raw veggies ($5).Next, aside from that salad, we skipped over the rest of the ""lighter"" section of the menu and tried a bunch of stuff from the ""bolder"" section:- Yukon Potato Fry Bread, highly decorated ($14)This is the thing everybody's talking about and ordering here, and with good reason. This definitely belongs in the ""bolder"" section, as it has a heavy taste from the fry aspect, but it so addictive it will still make you want to eat the whole thing.- Cauliflower Tempura and Steamed Buns, House Pickles ($14)Another delicious option, this is a dish you assemble yourself by placing some of the pieces of sweet fried cauliflower in the fluffy steamed buns, along with pickles if you choose. Both the buns and the fried veggies were great.- Shiitake ""Cacio e Pepe"" With Salsify & Heirloom Polenta ($18)After David Chang added his spin on Cacio e Pepe at Nishi, different takes have been popping up on menus everywhere. This iteration was the least like Cacio e Pepe, but still delicious and worth trying. It was mostly just like a mushroom polenta.- Wok-fried Farro, Brussels Sprouts, Hodo Tofu & Poached Egg ($16)This was a great dish for a riff on fried rice. The ""poached egg"" was actually just a runny egg white, which was a little disappointing since some yolk would've added some nice flavor to it, but the farro was actually pretty good.- Chocolate Mousse Cake, Amaro & Passion Fruit ($11)For dessert, we went with the Chocolate Mousse Cake, which despite actually looking very unappetizing and non-photo-worthy, was very good. The drizzle of passionfruit around it added a great sweetness to it too, making this a great option to end on.Service was great and it's a nice, relaxed atmosphere. If you are a vegetarian or vegan, you will probably be in heaven.",19,9,11,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
4.0,3/11/2016,Let's start with the good! The food is wonderful. Vegetarian. Nice mix of flavored. Unusual.  I especially loved the tofu skins rolled and filled with apple and butternut quash. The chef is brilliant and creative. Why not a 5 star? The front of the house does not seem aware of what the chef of doing. It is an expensive restaurant but any questions about the menu our waitress (who was very nice and tried really hard) didn't know the answers to anything. Asked about ingredients in dishes she guessed. This may sound fussy but this is the kind of place you want to know. The descriptions on the menu are very simple but the food is subtle and complicated. You definitely will want to know what you are eating. Our waitress told us the plate were for sharing.  They definitely were not. If I had been with anyone I was not super close with it would be awkward. They were saucy and messy and not at all easy to share. It was the kind of food you definitely want to eat of the plate that it is nicely served on for full enjoyment. I can't imagine sharing with a group. The space is nice. Comfortable. But so loud I heard the neighboring tables conversation and not my own table's and the waitress couldn't hear our order.

4.0,3/5/2016,"Super great new spot!!! I've been doing the vegetarian thing for all of about 2 weeks and the struggle is real. I'm a big fan of the other restaurants by this chef and I'm always down for trying something new. We had an early rese for dinner on Friday night and were warmly greeted upon walking in a few minutes late. The atmosphere is inviting if a bit too bright but come to find out they were having problems with the lighting so when they get that worked out it'll be all good. The service was impeccable. We started with some cocktails, the martini which had a nice twist with the thyme and the Baja which was really quite refreshing. We moved on to the naan and veges with two dips, the avocado and the spicy eggplant, both of which were phenomenal, my only suggestion would be to add a few different vegetables on the plate, the celery was meh. Everything on the menu sounds fabulous and with the very reasonable price of each dish, you can try so many different things. The spinach pie is a must order, light flaky crust with a boatload of flavor. On the large plates we ordered the faro and Brussels sprout dish and we were definitely fighting over the last few bites. I'm not a real dessert fan but the flan like dessert was ridiculously insanely scrumptious. Hey, I'm only 2 weeks into my vegetarianism but my bf is a card carrying carnivore and as we walked out the door he turned to me and said "" if we lived across the street I could see myself going there 2-3 times a week"" well done Nix!!!!",2,0,2,Leslie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,444,2
