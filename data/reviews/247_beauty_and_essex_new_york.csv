2.0,4/29/2019,"Came here for our anniversary dinner. While the concept is cool...that is really only the best thing ever. There's a hurried, noisy unprofessional army of servers followed by minuscule portions. We ordered shrimp cocktail...$19 for 4 shrimp? Seems unreasonable. My vegan dish was equally tiny and tho I am not a big eater I left feeling hungry! The service tho was actually the worst. He was hurried...didn't try to sell or recommend anything and on top of that my desert took 30 mins while the table next to us had theirs ahead of mine tho ordering after. Terrible...will never go back and it was a disappointing anniversary night.",0,0,0,Arantxa M.,"Caryville, FL",17,2,0
5.0,4/29/2019,"It doesn't look like a restaurant upon initially viewing it from the street. I didn't understand having a pawn shop in the storefront, but going through the rear door opens up to a completely different look and feel in the restaurant, it's kind of cool. If you got it, spend it but in my opinion, this is a place you take someone you've been dating for a while, someone you care about and want to spice things up with here. This is one of the places where the ambiance and energy of the place will entice you to want the food here - you will NOT be disappointed. You can split and share everything, our waitress recommended 4-5 items and that is plenty for a dining party of 2. It was my pleasure to share this with you all who read it, you'll enjoy it.-The grilled cheese dumplings tasted great and I'm glad I followed the crowd on this-The Burger is a mix of different meat and is delicious, and the fries seasoning complimented it greatly-The spaghettini was extremely flavorful, don't let the zucchini distract you from choosing it!-The dessert shot was a perfect sweet nightcap to the meal. I was too full to eat another actual serving but was happy to have something sugary. Good:-Grilled cheese, smoked bacon & tomato soup dumplings (MUST HAVE)-House Salad (refreshing and tasty)-Chicken Meatballs (it's chicken but still tastes like something your grandma would cook for you on Sundays)-Spaghettini (the lemon makes the taste pop)-Beauty & Essex Burger with BBQ Fries (I didn't want to share this)-Birthday Cake Milkshake Shot (ice cream with Jack Daniels)-RSVP via OpenTable for points-The ambiance is energetic-The music being played in the background made you bop your head while you were eating (older hip hop and R&B)Bad:-Cranky New Yorker rant: the people/customers, in my opinion, I felt wanted to be seen and photographed here mattered more than taking in and appreciating the full speakeasy experience/vibe and enjoying the meal. By no fault of the restaurant, it can feel pretentious, don't let that deter you from the delicious meal you'll have.",1,0,1,Daniel J.,"Hempstead, NY",57,273,291
5.0,4/29/2019,"Love this place, SO good! We treated ourselves and split the burger and BBQ fries as well as the crispy eggplant pizzetta. I am dying to go back to order the pizzetta again. Everything from the sauce to the whipped ricotta made this plate phenomenal. I haven't tried brunch here, but that is up there on my list.The place is a speakeasy when you enter, and then you walk in and it's a 2 story lounge with club vibes (not a club though!). The lighting is pretty dark inside like you're in a club. We weren't there on a weekend night for dinner, so there was no music blasting like there typically is on a Saturday night.

5.0,4/28/2019,"So you think this is just another boogie NY club, you're not so wrong, but the food is also really damn good. Its almost like a Gatsby moment, when you walk to the storefront, and the host takes you back to the restaurant to reveal a spiral staircase, candle lit bar, and folks dressed their best. 1) Kale and apple salad, like probably the Best kale and apple salad I've ever had. 2) Chile relleno empanadas, so bomb. Small but mighty 3) Thai style deep fried shrimp was amazing !!! 4) Spinch and ricotta ravioli was great especially with the sunny side egg 5) Wild mushroom toast was good, not extraordinary 6) Oven braised chicken meatballs left much to be desired.7) The steak though, wow the steak is so soft and tender. 8) Got the dessert carosel ! So cute and each was pretty delicious cons: 'mood' lighting is a bit dark, I ask them to turn the lights up because I can barely see the person i'm talking to , or see my food that I'm eating. It was also extrememly loud in here, with some electronic music being bumped almost to the point where you couldnt hear the person next to you",0,0,0,Taylor K.,"Portland, OR",500,178,1110
5.0,4/27/2019,"Great upscale food, drinks and atmosphere if you're looking for comfortable weekday night crowds and city nightlife bustle. Definitely tamer during the week but I prefer this than the insanity/stupidity that can be NYC weekends. Great for those times where you feel like ""getting dressed up a little (or a lot) and going out"". Fun spot to be the observer or the observed. And who doesn't love the entrance? Hard not to be charmed even if you've been here many times. Great date spot for when you don't want a quiet night in. I don't think it's so scene-y but it's easily seen by those who don't generally like to ""go out"" as pretentious. Weekends there can be some door bitch bs and lines but it's not the establishments issue, it's the individual. One of my go-to spots for visitors.",0,0,0,Elaine Q.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,7,0
4.0,4/27/2019,"Seven years ago I came here with a party of Seven and absolutely loved it.  The ambience is quite trendy, fashionable and fun.  A classy hipster vibe that actually is friendly. We had reservations so it wasn't difficult to get in.  The front lobby was filled with an assortment of jewelry and musical instruments (maybe different today), with tight security at the door. Standards are high and the interior boasts a certain style and decor.  Posh is probably a better word. The bar is ridiculous (in a good way) and I didn't mind it on a Saturday night. The open dining room area is even more spacious and not too loud either. We sat down and ate like royalty.  In a large dining hall that felt like a scene in GOT. A delectable assortment of foods- worth the price tag.  Desserts were actually kind of fun- do get the donuts and mini cupcakes- wow!Hope to return someday for brunch.",0,0,0,Christian R.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",135,228,24
1.0,4/25/2019,"I reseaved the table here for a birthday party.  The service is worst.  Since entering the restaurant,  the host informed my group that we can't stand by the others way but why the host didn't take us to sit at the table.  Even though we have been here for a long time  and that I considered the worst thing would be an employee who pushed the chair that my sister was sitting  and my sister is pregnant. The employee didn't push just once and that made my sister feel unsafe. Your employees honor just Americans people  because the side of table are Americans who want to put more chair after  but your employee chose to push people in my desk  who is pregnant.  If restaurant would like to serve only American people, do not sell to other people If your employees are discriminated against. We have called to ask from the employee but your employee answered indifferently and also using the words ""oh my gods"" and saying that they didn't do that. We think  If there have some influence on the mind or even the body  to my sister who is pregnant.  I will gather all the evidence to talk to a lawyer. I have chosen this restaurant from the reviews which many say it's good  but when the foods was come which the taste is normally and it can find in other restaurants.

4.0,4/24/2019,"Hostesses were a little cold when i walked in. Food was very good. Though I ordered a dish off the vegan menu that wasnt supposed to have zucchini on it and it had zucchini. So I had to eat around it. Waiter was nice. Tomato soup/grilled cheese dumplings were yummy ( i was able to get bacon on the side since i dont eat meat). Doughnuts for dessert were delicious! My entire party loved their food. OH...the bbq fries. I could not stop eating them. Highly recommend those too. I did feel everything was overpriced for what it was though. Also, I have to say in reading the reviews I am super annoyed at the group of 13 people that keep posting 1 star reviews about their pregnant friend's chair accidentally being pushed in. We get it. Not everyone in your party needs to post about it. And each person keeps embellishing the story. This is ruining my ability to weed out and read actual reviews. I am on the team of the guy who accidentally knocked into the chair. Next time don't put your friend on the aisle. You are a really really annoying group of people.",0,0,0,Miss X.,"Forest Hills, NY",0,35,1
1.0,4/23/2019,"One star is twice what this place deserves based on our experience last night. We chose to come here on my birthday and were hugely disappointed. The food is just fine. Everything else about the resturaunt was horrible. *****The runner shoved our pregnant friend twice. Tight quarters but still he heavily bumped into her twice and acted incredulous when we pointed it out*** We all saw him push the chair twice... And he said He didnt do that... After Fake apologize ... Splite the word on top of my head *oh my god* without any quilty.Drinks crashed to the table rudely every time. We were huried through our meal and treated like an anoyance. I would describe the attitude of the busperson, waiter and manager as disrespectful and defensive, hostile. We were a big party and I realize large tables can be a challange but we followed all the rules as we understood them and were civilized. We left Beauty and Essex wondering what we did to get on their bad side, offended and disgusted. Btw, we were required to pay for half the meal upfront just to secure the reservation and required to choose a tip amount beforhand, we unfortanetly  chose a 20% tip on a 2k bill. *** Plus ***whats culture pass the bill pay over top of the head and that head is my friend who pay your bad service 20 percents. ****Very rude! *** Plus If you saw my account , Never give one star to any resturant before even not as a good service that we gave a tip.

He said he didn't push but everyone on the table saw that and heard that what was going on!!!!Then he just said "" I am apologize "" with his very bad attitude and walk away with swearing in his words ""OH MY GOD"" Unbelievable, you said this words with your customer.   Cocktail and food were just ok it might be we pick something wrong because we didn't finish it all of them.  Please!!! try to training your staff to the right way.

1.0,4/22/2019,"I made reservations at Beauty &Essex for my friend birthday dinner. I have to say tonight we had a beyond terrible experience as we were having dinner. From the moment I walked in the experience was unpleasant. First we'd have to wait as they cleared table.  I feel like 20 mins wait, when I already had reservations was a bit much. But to be honest I expected the food to be a lot better :( Nothing really to rave about. Spaghettini was sooo flavorless. Salmon was very much dry... Food definitely wasn't worth it. The guy one of the runner team push my friend chair almost hit the table. She is pregnant. He said sorry, but not authentically apologizing. The restaurant is super cool looking. But the music is downright awful. Also the music was absurdly loud. If you want to be a club, be a club, but you're a restaurant. However, I would not recommend being there for a birthday or a special event. It was very was lackluster service to say the least. The worst, worst, worst birthday dinner experience I have ever had was at this place!!! Nasty staff and mediocre food. Also had to wait even with a reservation. So rude! So inconvenient! Horrible service and for sure Overrated! Puting one star on this review is already too much. If I could leave zero stars I would.

1.0,4/22/2019,"Seriously! I cant stop questioning how this restaurant becomes so famous???? We were so disappointed. Even if one of my friend highly recommended us come and celebrate Birthday party here.   The service was not professional at all. No one says excuse me to one of us when they came into our business. The sound when the silverware hit the table made us feel so harsh. Once my Birthday Girl handed the check file to the server, His hand was over my other friend's head and he didnt even notice since she said excuse me to him.   The food was just ok. We might pick the wrong choices so we were totally fine with it.   After all we got hit so hard to the deep feeling. It was a very rude runner pushed my pregnant friend's chair twice. We warned him in the very polite way but he end it up with angry and bad attitude. He rip off ""OMG"" after back turned but not even pass our table yet.

We sat on the big table in the middle of the dining room, and one in the group she's pregnant. At that time while we waiting for the check one of the food runner guy he walk pass behind my pregnant's friend he pushed my friend chair by his hip... yes!!! he pushed the chair like heavily twice (yesss 2 time), heavy like her chest was touch the table.I would say like honestly because I'm the one who sat opposite to her ,and I saw everything since first happened. The thing is the booth table behind my friends seat they put extra chair that's mean it's block the way when the people walk pass.After the guy pushed her chair and left by he didn't feel anything like he did that like usual,my friend she was panic and almost cry then.We wait until that guy walk back and we call him and let him know about the situation First- he disagree he said he didn't push or nothing And I was strong saying to him ""yes you are I saw that""Second- he said apologize to us but with his bad attitude and spilt the word ""oh my god "" to us and walk away.This guy was terrible aggressive and didn't feel bad for the situation with six months pregnant I strongly thumb down for service First step of the service was slow but our waiter he's okThe appetizers was good ,some entree we didn't finish it.This is we got from the professional restaurant who got good reviews.

However, behind the heavy, blue door pure elegance awaits. The bar is very posh and classic. The Hennessy Sidecar was quite tasty, but my drink of choice quickly became the Beauty Elixir - Gin,Strawberry Cucumber and Sparkling Rose'. It wasn't too sweet and definitely packed a punch! I started with the Red Velvet Waffles. The presentation made me not want to ruin it but I'm so glad that I did. They were drizzled with a light cream cheese sauce, melted in your mouth and were very rich. Jackpot! My main course was the Lobster Hash. The potatoes were roasted with a slight crisp, with a hint of sea salt and pepper, and filled with succulent and tender chunks of lobster. Truly divine! As if that weren't enough, I ordered the NYC donuts for desert. You could certainly tell that they were made to order. Warm, soft and melt in your mouth! The caramel sauce was probably my favorite.

The hubs and I dined here for our 3 year wedding anniversary, and enjoyed every second (minus the fact that when we made the reservation & stated our anniversary, not one waiter, hostess, or staff member wished us a happy anniversary). Moving on to the food, every morsel was delicious. We stared with the Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos and the Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings - WOW. The dumplings took the cake. We would not have offered this ""odd-sounding"" shareable if it weren't for the raving recommendation from our waiter. I'm so glad we gave it a try bc I could have ordered more & enjoyed this as my meal. This dish is a must try!! We then ordered 2 mains: Spinach & Ricotta Ravioli & the Atlantic Salmon with the BBQ fries ! Both meals were also very good. The fries were flavorful but a little too salty!

The devil's food + marscapone cake with milk ice cream was a mic drop. I'm dead.

Service was really great.  The ambience is nice and as everyone knows it's cool to walk through the pawn shop to get to the big restaurant in the back.  Now for the meal.  I wasn't impressed by the wine.  I did do by the glass so not a lot of options per type and it tasted cheap.  My friend and I split the kale and apple salad which was good.  Then she had the carpaccio and I had the grilled cheese bacon and tomato soup dumplings as well as the Thai shrimp.  Those dumplings are to dye for.  They are the main reason to come here.  I seriously dream about them.  The shrimp was just okay.  For dessert I had the cannoli pana cotta which was not like I expected.  It tasted like cannoli whipped cream and had coffee ice cream on the side.  It was ok just wouldn't choose it again when I return.  Overall great place and will return for dumplings service and ambiance.  I do wish to find other amazing items on the menu in the future,1,0,2,Sandy J.,"Westwood, NJ",193,186,185
2.0,4/14/2019,"Pretty disappointed by Beauty and Essex. After all the hype, I was excited to go for a bachelorette brunch with a group of 10. We were late to our reservation, and they still sat us promptly which was great. After that, the experience was below average. The restaurant was beautiful, but the food left a lot to be desired. The plates were tiny, and we weren't being shy with our ordering, but by the end of it, I was still hungry. The empanadas and dumplings were good but again, I got maybe a bite of each despite ordering several for the table. The rest of the food was really bland and lacked flavor. We also ordered mimosas which were billed at $17 per mimosa. That was the final nail in the coffin for me - there's no reason a mimosa should cost the same as the specialty cocktails, and $17 for some OJ with a splash of champagne is awful.

They cater to a club crowd so it's sort of like having dinner in a club. Food reflects that and lacks sophistication. Service was fine when we got to the table though.

5.0,4/9/2019,"Beauty & Essex is nondescript from the outside, taking the guise of a jewelry shop. However, once you enter a door from inside the shop you are transported to a chic supper club. You really feel like you are entering somewhere exclusive.Attendants take your coat and you're directed to your table. This place so distinguished, you will feel like you're in a James Bond movie...especially looking up at that gorgeous skylight. The food was simple and sophisticated all at once:Roasted bone marrow: incredible. The shallot marmalade gave the marrow a savory sweetness. The Texas toast on the side was a welcome crunchy touch. Lobster mac & cheese: light with a kick. The lobster was tasty and they aren't shy with the portion.Double cut lamb chops: Jesus Christ, this lamb was cooked to PERFECTION. Nice crust on the outside, and inside was soft and juicy. Once you get the bone the flavors literally slap you in the face. The polenta underneath was creamy and seasoned.Grilled cheese, smoked bacon & tomato soup dumplings: these are popular and were highly recommended...for good reason. I'd wager to say this was the best thing on the table. This is an example of what I meant by simplicity and sophistication. Something as simple as grilled cheese and tomato soup was presented and tasted worthy of a dish from a Michelin starred restaurant.Beauty & Essex was really something special.

She was rude and extremely unprofessional. She refused to answer questions and rolled her eyes a lot. If you are going to charge the prices you do, (I.e. 22 dollars a drink) then you should hire people who aren't rude and ghetto and make your 59 minute wait a bit more comfortable.

There is so much to choose from on the menu, from full entrees to appetizers and tapas. Make sure you order the Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon, & Tomato Soup Dumplings ($17). They're bite sized and packed with flavor. You'll see them floating around the restaurant, as everyone seems to order them -- for good reason!

Personally, I didn't really like the sauce that came with the Beef Wellington. I also got the tomato tartare, I thought it was interesting and reminded me a lot like steak tartare, but it's probably not something I would order again.

3.0,3/26/2019,"While looking for a unique dining experience we came across Beauty & Essex and made reservations for Sunday evening.  From the outside, most might think that this is a pawn shop but once you walk in, a second set of doors open and you step into a modern Victorian era/Interview with a Vampire like setting.   After being greeted by the hostess we were immediately taken to our seats...Ok, so without getting caught up in the whimsical and eye candy of the place I've decided to break this review down to make it as objective as possible.Food... I give this a 3The Thai Shrimp were light, crispy and flavorful.  We also enjoyed the smoky and cheesy flavor of the grilled cheese-tomato soup dumplings.  Things turned around for the last two dishes which came out cold- the Peruvian chicken, along with its sauce and sliver of vegetables, was very bland.  I rarely use salt, however this time I was very disappointed to not find it on the table.  The last dish, the spaghettini, was so overloaded with parsley and oregano that it was too overpowering and overwhelming to eat.  I would pass on these 2 dishes in the future. Service... I give this a 4Our waiter was very responsive and attentive, and didn't make us feel rushed.  I didn't interact with many employees in the restaurant, but he definitely represented them well.Ambience... I give this a 4.  I has nice décor and warm lighting, it's a speakeasy, and I almost thought I was going to see Eric Northman from True Blood sitting on his throne at the front of the restaurant...pretty cool.So even though the food was .....ok, overall I still enjoyed my dining experience.  Perhaps, I'll be up for a second try.

1.0,3/23/2019,Love this place but the italian dark hair about 5'7-5'8 bartender from the second floor is the most unpleasant bartender of all of LES. My friends and I were deciding on which red wine we wanted. He gave us multiple tastings and then refused to serve us the drinks until we all provided our IDs. Which makes no sense at all because we've got our ids checked at the door and he gave us a taste of the liquor prior to asking us for our IDs. As we handed our ids to him he screamed out for the security guard to watch us the whole entire night. Which was so uncalled for because everyone who was sitting at the bar turned to us and looked at us like we were low class criminals. EMBARRASSED US!

I went to Vandal awhile back, and since I loved the experience, I decided to give this place a shot.My initial plans were dinner, but I had to make a change. I wanted to do brunch somewhere else, that was nearby, and come here for drinks and small eats since it was additional friends that were going to join that weren't at my brunch. Upon entry, we saw the flower shop and made our way to the couch area, that is located across from the bar. One of my friends went to the bar to get some drinks but a server came over and wanted us to order through her. I wish I got her name, and she was very pleasant the entire night, but I didn't ask as we were too busy talking and drinking. We spent about two hours here and enjoyed every minute. I didn't see anything on the menu that I wanted but my friend did order me a birthday cake from the dessert menu, which the wonderful server,not only comped the dessert, she gave me an extra cupcake.

The supposed to be called 'manager' came to is in a very rude way to wake me up (I have to say I was battling a bad cold and not feeling well) was just waiting for our food to arrive. He came to us and yelled and accused me of being drunk on the table. When the truth was that I was very sick from the cold weather. We clarified that I was really sick and we just wanted our food.He kept checking on us and making us feel very uncomfortable. This is why we asked for the check and canceled the order. He followed me to the entrance and asked the bouncer to kick us out because I was a ""threat"". I have never been more offended in my life! I am a frequent customer on all excellent restaurants where I receive excellent service and this guy made me feel very discriminated.Later on another 'manager' came to us trying to justify the rudeness of the previous one. But it was already too late. The bouncer got very aggressive not only with me but with my wife and my friends, and he tore apart my Moncler jacket! When he realized he ripped it, he got scared but was too late again. Never in my life (I am not a 20 year old, I am a grown up man) I've been treated this way. Your staff should be trained to treat customers in a diplomatic way, with values not how they treated us last night. I am sure they are not trained to perform that way. And I am sure they are pod to do their job properly. Cannot express enough our disappointment and how upset we are. We had to go back to the hotel with this terrible experience on our last night in NYC. I will definitely take further action on this! This cannot stay like this, and any decent person needs to be treated like we were. Is not fair when you are going to a place to spend money on a good meal and good time.

We had the infamous tomato soup and cheese dumplings, an order of the chicken and biscuit bites, pastrami mac and cheese ... and bbq fries that never made it to our table. Before ordering our apps, we tried placing an order for the lobster Mac and cheese and onion rings but our waitress advised us that those were specifically only for lunch and we couldn't order those for brunch. The appetizers were decent, nothing mouthwatering or jaw dropping. The tomato soup and cheese dumplings paired very well together, but it was average in my opinion. The chicken biscuit bites were average and a very small portion. The chicken meatballs were my least favorite, nothing spectacular about it. And last but not least, the bbq fries that never made it to our table but only because I believe our server forgot about it which was no biggie because we were ready to leave and get our real grub on anyway! We went upstairs, and the vibe was definitely the brunch vibe everyone's looking for, ratchet classy, aka my type of party!

This may not have been the restaurant's fault as table turnover can depend on the guests, but it was a rather long wait. In addition, the service was not the greatest although this could be due to the high volume of customers in the place. The food itself was amazing and the drinks were phenomenal. I started out with and stayed drinking the ODB drink throughout the night. So delicious. We then began with our apps: the soup dumplings and the empanadas. Both so creative and so delicious!

Seated around the boozy brunch crowd, I wonder what life choices I had made that resulted with me ending up here.

The table across from us had a birthday party of drunk girls taking flash pictures the entire time. When our waiter arrived, he was very friendly. However, he noticed we had the wrong menus... After getting us the right menus what seemed to be at least 10 minutes later, we ordered our food and drinks at the same time. This place redeems itself in terms of food. My steak and eggs were cooked extremely well. My friend's burger and BBQ fries were amazing. Our service was slow, but I think the waiter had too many tables.

I just went again this Saturday with my boyfriend. Our reservation was at 5pm, but we arrived about 10 minutes after. We were shown to our table right away, but I soon realized they were putting us at a two top in between two other two tops that all share one long booth. They are exactly like the seats at Cheesecake Factory that are way too close together so you are practically in the other tables' conversations. I asked the hostess if we could sit directly on the other side of the dining room at similar two top tables that no one was at yet. She was hesitant and said we would have to follow her back to the front to see if it was alright. She explained that they have closing servers and opening servers and there might not be someone serving the section yet. It seemed like a hassle so I agreed that we would just sit in the middle of the two other tables. Not even 10 minutes later one of the other tables across the dining room was seated. This was very frustrating. When you go to an upscale restaurant like this you do not expect to be seated uncomfortably close to other people.  I love the food, but this seating for a party of two and their unwillingness to accommodate a simple request set an unpleasant mood for our entire meal.

4.0,2/17/2019,I really like this place. Was in the city for a few days so I decided to make reservations for dinner since I heard good reviews on their brunch. I first get there and the entrance is misleading lol. I thought I was walking into the wrong place but I liked the concept and thought it was original. Opening the doors to the real restaurant and all I saw was madness trying to get to the hostess for my reservation. I'm assuming people's tables were backed up and that's why the space was crowded but being cramped with a ton of people isn't fun. We got seated after10 minutes and after that was smooth sailing. The waiter was cool. Food was great. I'd recommend the dee friend shrimp and the lobster mac. Drinks were good also. Loved the champagne bar in the bathroom. Would definitely come back.,0,0,0,Mecca A.,"Philadelphia, PA",34,31,12

2.0,2/16/2019,"I made reservations at Beauty & Essex for my birthday dinner & was super excited about finally visiting. However, from the very moment I walked in the experience was unpleasant. First off the hosts were incredibly rude. The host counter was completely clear, not a single person waiting to be helped besides me. But for some reason. None of the host felt the need to make my presence known or ask how they could assist me.. Therefore, I get even closer to the counter to let the host know I had a reservation at 8:45 and that my party would now be 4 instead of 5 because someone was no longer able to make it. The whole time she barely looked me in my face, and had such a weird tone to her voice when she responded. Whatever.. Also, I understand that because there were changes to the party size we'd have to wait as they cleared another table. But sheesh! I feel like a 35 min wait, when I already had reservations was a bit much.I will say, the service was slightly better when we were seated since our host wasn't mean. But to be honest I expected the food to be a lottt better :/ Only one person in my party actually enjoyed what they ordered which was the Peruvian Chicken.I ordered the Garganelli pasta and Yukon Gold Potato Purée. Both dishes were okay. Nothing really to rave about. My friend order the burger and fries which I tasted as well and the burger was sooo flavorless. She even ordered it medium well so it could be juicy and it was very much dry.. Overall I would say the decor of the restaurant is absolutely beautiful. Definitely something I admired while I was there & it's pretty neat how they have a complimentary rosé bar in the women's restroom area.

3.0,2/14/2019,"I have been wanting to try beauty and Essex for a while and finally did last night for a pre Valentine's Day dinner with my boyfriend. We sat downstairs in the main dining room and I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant. They sat us at a table that was super close to two other tables at the side of us. The table was wobbly which made dinner not as comfortable. We eventually got so annoyed we asked the waiter to see if he could make it stable. He was able to fix the table in a matter of seconds. I found the waiter to be bland and not personable in the slightest. However, he was very attentive throughout dinner and kept asking if we needed refills for our wine glasses. For dinner we decided on getting the ribeye tacos as an appetizer. It was delicious and the steak was very tender. For mains I ordered the spaghettini. I was surprised on how large the portion was but disappointed on how the dish tasted. It had an over power lemon taste to the pasta and it basically ruined the dish for me. I left most of it. My boyfriend liked his entree which was the spicy veal bolognese. For dessert we got the sorbets which was really yummy. I especially liked the banana one.

3.0,2/6/2019,"I wish I could give 3.5 stars but that is not allowed on this app. I came here for restaurant week and order items off of both the restaurant week menu and the their regular dinner menu. For appetizers a friend and I had the lobster Mac and cheese, the smoked bacon and grilled cheese dumplings, the kale and apple salad, and the poke tuna wonton tacos. We had to try the dumplings because they are a staple but I was  underwhelmed. I did not enjoy the smoky flavor of the bacon, I feel as though it took away from the rest of the appetizer. I enjoyed the kale and apple salad but it had too much mayo or what ever sauce that combined the salad on it. Mid way through the dish, I started to get tired of the mayo like sauce because it became too heavy. The lobster Mac and cheese lacked flavor and cheese. I will admit there was a decent portion of lobster in the dish but the lobster was a little too chewy. My friend enjoyed the tuna tacos but I did not try it because I do not enjoy poke but my friend spoke highly of it.For our entree, my friend had the salmon and I had the short ribs. The short ribs were very tender but needed more flavor. My friend enjoyed her salmon but also stated it needed more flavor. I ordered the ODB specialty cocktail. The drink was strong but it did not have a great berry flavor. If this drink was made with a bourbon or whiskey, it would definitely taste better. The tequila did not mix well with the rest of the flavors; it over powered the rest of the mixers For dessert I had the LES Donuts. I have absolutely no complaints about the donuts. They were soft, hot, and the different dipping sauces were a nice touch. My friend spoke highly of the sorbet and spoke very highly of the cream on top of the dessert.

The crab wonton things were NOT good and lacked flavor. The soup bites and chicken meatballs were alright, nothing out of this world in my opinion. The service here was not very good, and our waiter was pretty bad.

Every food selection was flavorful and delish I could not find a flaw.  I do not want to forget to mention the grilled cheese dumplings in tomato soup served on a spoon as it was amazing.

The food was flavorful and well-executed. Service was attentive, but we were given our bill with dessert. Even though the server said no rush, I couldn't help but feel like they were hoping to get us out as soon as possible (lots of people were waiting in the front bar area when we left).

One of my guests had to leave soon so he suggested what to order first and brought out the food really fast. Also got complimentary birthday dessert and song. Food : love lobster Mac & cheese and chicken meatballs in sheep milk. Had decent chunks of lobster in warm and creamy Mac & Cheese. The meat balls were tender and delicious. We also got Pearl of the Sea platter which has oysters, shrimps and lobsters in it - both east & west coast oysters were plump and fresh. Bone marrow toast was rather interesting. The gelatin-like texture in bone marrow goes surprisingly well with the saltiness in caramelized onion spread. Onion rings were my least favorite of the meal - they were crispy but not unique enough to pay the price or call it fancy.  Setting: Intimate.

Nevertheless, we got a nice booth that was perfect for the 3 of us.After perusing the RW menu, I decided to go with the tuna poke wonton tacos, the braised short ribs, and the doughnuts.The tacos had great flavor, but were definitely on the smaller side. My friend ordered the pizzette, which was decent and a much heftier dish.The braised short ribs were also good--but again, a bit on the smaller side. My friend ordered the chicken, which was tasty--and probably 3 times as much food.For dessert, they told us that they had run out of the sorbet, so we all got the doughnuts--this was probably the least impressive course as it was still good, but nothing to write home about.We were also shocked because about an hour after we had ordered, another table received the cherry sorbet that we had been told was not available--so not quite sure what happened there.Overall, this place serves up some decent food that is worthwhile for the RW pricing.

We were large group and sampled the crispy fish tacos (meh - fish was not fresh), Peruvian chicken, chops (good), raw bar (oddly seasoned - wouldn't order again), and grilled cheese and soup - like I said, something for everyone.  Lots of business groups during the week as well as tourists and folks from the burbs.  But everyone is happy to be there and be seen.  The weekend crowd is largely the same - sans business folks who are replaced by a younger upscale crowd.  Service is polite but the kitchen is slow.  Got there early during a weekday around 6:30 and promptly ordered - appetizers weren't served until 8 (good thing we were drinking - haha).  Service on weekends is even slower.  Our college-aged son loves this place and its not horrible - so we've been a few times.  Simply not the place I would chose for myself, but it is   fine as long as you keep your food expectations in check.",0,0,0,Lisa C.,"Forest Hills, NY",3,71,0

Every time I've dined here the food is incredible. The dishes are made to share so you order a few for the group and all are outstanding. This matches their beautiful interior decor and the music is so good you can see people trying/trying not to dance while seated at their tables for dinner. Really a great place to get all dressed up and go out with your friends (but only if you're classy!)Service is usually very professional, with the exception of security being a little douche-y sometimes and an occasional blip with trying to order delivery (which, btw, they are one of the only places that I'd say their food is just as good delivered as it is in house) but nothing to doc any stars over.

This is apparently a chain with locations in both Las Vegas and LA. The ambiance is nice with a retro throwback vibe. Reservations are a must as this place gets packed quick! We went for brunch as soon as they opened at 1130 AM and it wasn't long before the place was to capacity with people waiting to be seated. They apparently serve champagne in the bathroom although I did not go to confirm this. The food is served tapas or family style. Ordering multiple small plates to feed a table. We had the NYC donuts, ricotta pancakes, eggs Benedict, tomato soup dumplings, steak and eggs, and chicken biscuits. The food was pretty good. I would only give it a step above decent however. The fried chicken was not very flavorful and the tomato soup dumplings were a bit cold. All in all it's a great place to go for ambiance and probabaly cocktails.

When I decided to leave at 1130 and asked for refund process, representative gave me wristbands for me and my group. Can barely walk inside, the event was way oversold. Lines for bar were ridiculous. Event was supposed to last past 0400, but they decided to close before 0200 (probably because they were concerned the fire department was going to be called because they were so over capacity). Could not get to coat check from main stairwell, there was a bottleneck with a mob of people, and Security was completely useless in trying to manage the situation. I was escorted down a back staircase by an employee, finally get to the coat check, and my boyfriend's coat has been stolen. Management doesn't care.

Once inside it was crazy crowded with no semblance or order. It was a fight to get drinks or get your coat - if they didn't lose your coat, that is. My friends and I made the best of it despite the overall poor management of this event. It's a shame because the venue seems cool and perhaps on a normal day it's not such a disorganized shitshow.

We arrived at the venue at 9:30 (when doors were supposed to open) to be greeted by a line of soaking patrons waiting to get in. I was very confused at first and started asking everyone around us if they had purchased tickets, we all had. After about an hour I was pretty much done; I was wet, cold, and tired of waiting in a line that was not moving at all. I had asked the bouncers multiple time what's taking so long and receiving nothing of substance... I was ready to leave, but stayed at the request of my girlfriend. We welcomed the New Year while waiting in line, soaked to the bone. I've attempted to contact the Tao Group (the restaurant group), Beauty and Essex, and Joonbug (the event coordinator), all with no response. I've contacted my bank's fraud dept. to get my refund, I was using one of the post on Beauty and Essex's Instagram (that had a multitude of people complaining in the comments) as proof for my services not provided claim... but they seem to want to just forget NYE instead of taking responsibility, as they've since deleted this post. I'm an veteran, and a full-time student; the price of the tickets may be trivial for some but for me they are a substantial amount. It is disgusting the way this business has treated it's patrons.

We purchased Lounge Seated VIP tickets for $150+ each which clearly states reserved seating and a VIP line. The multiple websites stated that open bar is from 9:30 pm-1:30 am and doors open until 4:00am. We arrived around 9:30 to a ""VIP Line""- more like a throng of angry, drenched people waiting to get inside and a GA Line that went to the end of the block, neither of which were moving. After an hour of figuring out why no one was getting in they told us they were denying access to all VIP because they couldn't find wristbands. Seriously. We finally got in at 11:00 pm and checked our coats. We then had to ask FOUR different staff members where the seated lounge area was. Clueless. We went upstairs and flagged down a waitress who actually was very helpful (wish I knew her name, that 1 star is for you girl) and found us our table - she had to clear out the group of people that weren't supposed to be there. It is now 11:30. Missed the countdown/ ball drop due to the LONG line at the bar to get champagne, so that was cool.Night starts to get better; we're drinking and dancing, then the lights go on, music stops. It's 1:50. They start clearing everyone out. I will repeat it is ONE-FIFTY AM. I honestly thought this was a joke. Then coat check. What a nightmare. The stampede of people pushing and shoving to get into the tiny doorway/stairway was insane. We even tried staying at our table to finish our drinks and wait for it clear up. They took our half finished drinks away and insisted we had to leave the lounge and go get our coats because they needed us out. Luckily once we got to the basement we recovered all of our belongings but I witnessed numerous people around me freaking out because their jackets were missing and had been stolen- WITHOUT APOLOGY.

Our line got moved from one side to the next and we wound up waiting in heels and dresses in the pouring rain from 9:15-11:30pm. Not a single security guard or bar personnel was there to assist or explain. Not a single question we asked was answered, no one seemed to know was was going on. We finally get in, soaking wet and exhausted and it was impossible to get a drink, no food left, and when we were brought to ""our table"" it was occupied. The place seemed oversold to the max. It was almost impossible to move. The woman assisting us said she'd ""be right back"" while she figured out why people were sitting at the table we paid for but never came back. So fine, we accept defeat and hit the bar downstairs. We happen to get 2 drinks in us and it hits midnight, we finally start enjoying ourselves. Come 1:30am, they turn the lights on and kick everyone out, totally ignoring the fact that we purchased tickets for an event that ran till 4am.

The food was good  but the portions are wayyyyy too SMALL! you get like 5 different things but it comes out served like family style but only enough for 1 taste serving per person. Empanada was the size of my thumb!?  the eggs were good , the fish taco was not good no one at our table  touched it except for one person. So for 68 dollers (85 after tip and tax is added ) your get a taste of each appitzer . On top of all this my husband goes to the bar to get us a drink and the guy at the bar ( who is the bartenders brother )  feels entitled to act up with customers and provoke fights because the people who work there ""have his back "" and we would be the ones to  get  "" kicked out "" (his staggering words lol) which we felt like we was correct because immediately the bouncer is talking to my husband in an accusing mannor , meanwhille he didn't do anything !!!  So how it happened ..the bar was super crowded and my husband asked for a drink and the bartenders brother starts getting in my husbands face cursing and yelling like an immature little girl/frat boy screaming with a bit of added whining  ""you could have said f$&@$ing  said excuse meeeeeee"" repeating the same thing  over and over and getting confrontational trying to provoke a fight , mean whille my husband is a classy gentleman there with his wife, friends and buisness partner. This guy made me feel  so uncomfortable and threatened so we paid our bill and instead of staying and drinking and dancing like we planned , we left , ruined my night that i had planed all week !

I ordered the garganelli (the pasta Bolognese with whipped little Italy ricotta) and was so satisfied. I thought the ricotta may be too much but instead it was perfect and was busting with flavors. My boyfriend loved his salmon. The fish tacos came with 3 and were about 2 bites each (1 bite if you have a larger mouth). But they were my favorite thing I ate so I would definitely order them again. I was so upset because I ate half of my broccolinii and was planning to take the rest home. They wrapped it up for me at the end but when I left to use the bathroom, they had thrown it out. I feel like it should have been replaced or given to us for half the price but oh well.

I was sad that they were out of the crab Rangoon which is what I really wanted to try but maybe next time. The chicken meatballs weren't for me as they had a lot of parmesan and I'm not much of a fan. But everything was phenomenal. This place is perfect for a girls night out or a date night.

First of all, I love the fact that this place is situated behind a pawn shop and therefore has a cool speakeasy vibe. I love the fact that the food is great (I regularly go out to ""clubby"" places like this and beauty & Essex has by far the best food). And I ESPECIALLY love the amazing performers that come out to showcase belly dancing, etc. Whenever I come the drinks are free-flowing and and the crowd is amazing - just a very fun, friendly environment. My favorite dish is the little tomato soup/cheese bite things. I also love the salad and the pizza.Aside from the quality of the food, the thing that really stands out about this place is the niceness of the bathrooms and the number of stalls.

In addition, all the dishes were perfect for sharing and I recommend any group do the same. We also got the beauty's wonder wheel ($32).

3.0,11/18/2018,"3.5 stars. Came here with a group of 8 for Saturday brunch. We decided on brunch late the night before and they were one of the few restaurants who could accommodate such a large group at such late notice.SERVICE: Solid. Our waitress didn't come by often to check on us but she was sweet and explained the menu clearly. FOOD: Most of the food is meant to be shared, with the exception of a few dishes like the salmon and burger. None of us really feeling a tapas-style brunch, and since there were so many of us we'd have to multiples of an item if we all wanted to try, say, the avocado toast (which comes with three pieces per order). We decided to just each order our own dishes, even if they were meant to be shared. I got the burger, which is normal-sized and comes with BBQ-seasoned fries. The fries were good and served with both ketchup and mayo (in separate containers); the burger was meh. I got mine cooked medium but should've asked for medium well; it was a bit mushy and the flavor was lacking. I didn't end up finishing the burger. DECOR & AMENITIES: It's a beautiful place, if a little dark. In the main dining area, most of the light comes from the ceiling's massive skylight. It's also a little cramped - the tables are packed together and there's not a lot of room to move around.To get into the restaurant, you have to pass through the associated Pawn Shop, which sells everything from  jewelry to custom musical instruments. The bathroom here is gorgeous, and the front desk for the restaurant is a counter displaying vintage jewelry. All the aesthetic feels.NOTE: They won't seat you unless the whole party is present. We were waiting for a while and missing one person; they agreed to seat us if we ordered for the missing person at the same time as the rest of the table.It's a nice place, pretty and well-designed, but I probably won't be back for brunch.

As for cocktails and mocktails, the Bloody Mary was great as well as the platinum peacock. Aside from the food the part that really killed it was our waitress. She was never around which was highly irritating. We asked her to split the bill 5 ways and ended up with different amounts on our checks. As a group we all agreed we'd tip x amount that would make it so everyone's check total was $67. This meant some of us tipped $1.37 and others $30. As we were leaving I happened to catch the waitress making a snarky comment to other staff about the different tip amounts. I approached her and explained had she split the bill evenly like we'd asked, it wouldn't look so odd. Regardless of her inability to do basic math, her tip still came out to 20% of the total check cost.

5.0,10/31/2018,"We were a party of four going out for dinner. One of the party members had been here several times and truly recommended it. First of, I must say the entrance is very cool. Very speakeasy feeling to it as you walk through a little store and through a big door in the back. I would have never known that there was a restaurant there!When seated we ordered drinks that were all very good. We also had a great white vine after suggestions from our waiter. Moreover we had the waiter put together a meal for all of us so that we got to try out more than one dish from the menu. Everything tasted delicious and was presented very nicely. We also had just the right amount of food for the four of us. The ladies could report that sparkling vine is served in the ladies bathroom. Although it is kind of pricey it was definitely worth it!

3.0,10/31/2018,"The place is a happening.  Most of the food is excellent to amazing albeit very pricey.  Drinks are also very expensive.  Yeah I know it's Manhattan but I'm not sure how a Stoli costs $19.  I'd be afraid to ask what they charge for one of the more premium brands.  I thought our server was outstanding.  He was very helpful, pleasant, professional, and full of explanations.  Our tip was about 21-22%.  I know some people will tip more but that is still a lot of money with what they charge there and I bet they get people there who tip significantly less.  I sensed he wasn't happy with his tip since he barely said thank you at the end.  I may have misread that situation but I don't think so.  Who knows?  I would pass on ordering the rib eye steak again.  Normally, I wouldn't order it outside of a steakhouse but based on the place's reputation and the $63 price tag I was expecting something amazing.  It was good but no sizzle, no char, no heat.  I know I sound negative but we had a great evening.  The place is trendy and has a great vibe.  The small plate dishes were outstanding especially the Thai Shrimp, the Eggplant Pizza, and the Soup Dumplings.  That wonder wheel of desserts is a must have or is it a must see.  either way, order it!Oh yeah, for the women, make sure to visit the ladies room where they serve complimentary drinks.  If it wasn't for the disappointing steak, it would be 4 stars.",3,2,2,Lenny K.,"Edison, NJ",303,768,394

We visited on a Saturday at 5:45pm. The place opens at 5 and it was already filling up!You arrive to what looks like an old pawn shop storefront with the beautiful glowing Beauty & Essex sign. When you walk in, its like a jewelry/niknak shop. Then you walk through the green doors into a massive restaurant. Its such a cool speakeasy vibe! We were taken immediately i gave my name. The ambience was a little louder than anticipated, and of course a bachelorette party was seated right next to us which was a bit irritating, but we managed. I loved the details within this experience so much. Its a very vintage/lounge feel. The bathroom was insane! It had a minibar and a lounge couch!Onto food and drinks. The cocktails are $17 each. regularly sized as well. I had the LES Crush which was delicious! Perfectly flavored. He got the black tie white noise. We were expecting this to be black based on the Yelp photos, but this drink arrived orange. The flavors were too woody for my liking. For apps we got the grilled cheese dumpling w tomato soup, and the octopus cassoleut. Both were delicious. The dumplings came out a little cold though. The octopus dish was basically like a chili, but im a sucker for chorizo which made it so tasty!I wasnt aware that the ""entrees"" were more of a tapas. For my entree i ordered the wasabi crusted tuna, he got the scallops. When both arrived i was shocked at the quantity.  I mean really these prices are insane and i left a little hungry still.  The scallops esp. They were $34 for only 3!! At least 4 like cmon. Granted these scallops were enormous, and were like butter so good! The tuna was good, a basic ahi tuna steak flavor. Before we left they gifted 2 mini cupcakes for my bday, which tasted store bought needless to sayThe service was great throughout! Our waitress didnt rush us out and was very patient with us. Overall, i do feel like this place is a bit overhyped.  For first timers, id def try to come for restaurant week or something. Or if i do come back, id either only come for drinks, or like 1 app and a burger being that the prices are insane!Apparently theres a party room upstairs also which i def would like to see next time as well!",0,0,0,Dana A.,"Queens, NY",47,113,210

The wheel of desserts is just instagram worthy but none of the candies were even edible, forget being yummy. And guess how much that dessert is for-$32. It's a sham. I think since it's been in NYC from quite a long time hence it's so popular.. I do think that there are way better places giving better food, drinks and services around the city.

The waitress was very nice and personable.  I ordered the fish tacos as an appetizer and their steak, egg, n potato dish as my main course. We were eating downstairs, so it was quiet and intimate.

My group of friends had reservations (made 30, yes 30 days in advance) and were seated right away. The interior is absolutely gorgeous!I started with an Emerald Gimlet, which was Belvedere Vodka, basil, lemon nectar and fresh lime. Delicious, a little tart and packed a kick. I was feelin good! My friends liked their drink choices as well.The dish to try here is the Grilled Cheese Dumplings. Picture mini grilled cheese wrapped into a dumpling covered in bacon, nestled in creamy tomato soup in a large spoon. Absolutely fantastic, and every single table had an order on their table. For my main, I had the Garganelli, which was spicy veal Bolognese with whipped ricotta. The ricotta was sheep, which I don't love so I had to pick around that, but the pasta and sauce were very good. I also tried the chicken meatballs and I think they were the best chicken meatballs I've ever had! Still thinking about them a week later!We all split as sides the Broccolini (awesome sauce with a bit of a kick to it) and the Yukon Gold Potato Puree (yummy but typical mashed potatoes).

Once there we had to wait a while in the bar area and thankfully caught a section in the sofas because it was packed. The cocktail menu is great, everything sounded really good. I tried the beauty elixir and it was amazing, I had 3 and would've gladly had more if I could lol. We were all blown away by the appetizers as well. We tried the dumplings, thai style deep fried shrimp, chile relleno empanadas and the BBQ fries. The dumplings were top 1 for us, they were served in a spoon with tomato soup - very cheesy and full of bacon flavor. Unfortunately it all went downhill with the entrees. My friends ordered the burger and hated it - they said it had an overpowering butter taste. My other friend wasn't impressed with the lobster mac and cheese. I got the Spaghettini and it was just okay - it was more herby than what I expected and very very dry. I don't think anyone on the table really enjoyed their entrees. We also tried the dessert wheel which seems to be pretty popular. It has a good variety of treats and I loved them all, especially the cake pops and the caramels.The restaurant itself is beautiful and its spaced out in 2 floors.

Very good cocktails at a typical price for a trendy spot such as this. We also got the famous tomato soup dumplings to start and just wow.

I could've ordered 5 plates of them and eaten them alone.We all got different mains and it was just to see there was a whole separate menu for my vegan friend! I went with the ricotta and spinach ravioli which was so good. Very creamy and cheesy sauce so I highly recommend.

Better yet, unlimited bubbly pink champagne was being served by a happy staffer from a pretty little bar.  Great tunes and frequent trips to the bar kept my girls and I in the bathroom for who knows how long!  When we eventually returned to our male companions, who were waiting to order, upon hearing the amenities in the women's bar said, ""What bar;  all we had was (blank, blank).  Oh well Now for the food!   We devoured the Pearls of the Sea (massive presentation of raw delicacies, lobster and shrimp cocktail); fought over the double orders of Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings. The Crispy Fish Tacos are made with Chilean Sea Bass y'all!  We all chose different entrees, but you cannot possibly go wrong no matter what!My Grilled Lamb Loin disappeared before my eyes; several big ole Bone-in Ribeyes were cooked to perfection and the creamy, cheesy, lemony, pesto flavored goodness of the Spaghettini knocked me out.  Of course we had the Crispy Panko Vidalia Onion Ring - so yummy;  killer Lobster Mac & Cheese... oh my goodness and fresh, crisp Grilled Asparagus.  Naturally, every dish was presented just so. We were too busy eating to take pictures so you're going to have to come check it out yourself.

(like no im not waiting for something im not late to just because you guys overbook your venue) they were all over the place first they said my table was down stairs (booth which i requested) then they placed us upstairs right away (after letting them know that we were annoyed). So the waitress took all of our orders ans forget my friend and my drink . which is annoying and i understand places are busy but then you should have more workers. The main point is customer service ! without customers theres no business. Then we asked the bouncer looking men if they can kindly take a group picture of us and he denied it and walked away? like rude much? Then our food came I ordered 2 different dishes and still didn't like it so I gave up at this point with dinner. The waitress never came once ! NOT ONCE ! to ask us if we need anything or how our meal was going. I would say the only good thing was the dessert so because of that I gave 1 star. But thats it! When we needed to get the check that took another hour , it took longer to switch meals then it took for us to eat. Lastly my sister had to use the restroom so she asked the bouncer guy where the restroom was and he said ""2 flights down"" (which is so inconvenient) and she said ""really"" and he said ""does it look like im joking ?""

I took my husband here on Saturday for his birthday and we both adored the entire experience.The restaurant is very vegetarian friendly and have plenty of dishes that the staff can exclude the meat from.The menu is tapas style and the portions are pretty small; so I would recommend around five to six dishes for a party of two.What We Ordered:1. Chili Relleno Empanadas (the jalapeño-lime crema was delicious on this dish)2. Crispy Eggplant Pizzetta (great flavor and the whipped ricotta is to die for)3. Grilled Cheese & Tomato Dumplings (they taste just like a grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup from when I was a kid)4. Lemon Pepper Ricotta Ravioli (so much flavor! I loved the asparagus and mushrooms in the dish)5. Yukon Gold Potato Purée (so creamy and so rich with flavor)6. Thai Style Deep-Fried Shrimp (these were for my husband, but he said they were delicious)For Dessert:1. LES, NYC Doughnuts (the dipping sauces are everything)2. Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot De Crème (so much deliciousness going on in this little dessert)The drinks and wine are fantastic at Beauty & Essex as well. If you like a good smoky drink I would try the O.D.B or the Merchant (my husband and I really liked both of these drinks.I would definitely visit Beauty & Essex again! They have so many more dishes I would like to try.If you are in NYC I would highly recommend checking this place out.Thanks for making my husbands birthday dinner very special.",1,0,0,Charles B.,"New York, NY",123,124,164

Later on in the night as our group number started to dwindle, we returned to Beauty & Essex. This time I was with my friend who used to live in East Village, she called out Ken doll on his bluff and he let us in without a cover (surprise #3).

I hate eating out because the menus are limited for places that aren't vegetarian based but i had no issue here. The place is relatively expensive but nothing too crazy. For 5 people the bill was 250 but we didnt get anything extravagant nor many drinks. It was okay though. 62 pp and paying for the birthday girl is not unreasonable but the portions aren't large.

I've never had a restaurant do that before.The food, although very good, came in very small portions, so prepare for that. I would say my favorite of all the dishes was the Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon and Tomato Soup Dumplings. I don't eat red meat, so they put it on the side for us, which was very nice. I also enjoyed the Lemon-Pepper Ricotta Ravioli. It was really moist and flavorful.The best part was the drinks. I had the Beauty Elixir.

Main course I split the short ribs and salmon. The short ribs were delicious, sort of reminded me of a bbq plate, but the portion was quite small. The salmon was good, nothing unique, but a great portion size. For dessert I had the coconut peanut cake pop, which I did not like at all because the inside had chunks of peanuts in it and it wasnt a smooth cake texture and also I found the flavor combination weird.

4.0,8/20/2018,"Came here on a Friday evening during restaurant week and ordered from the restaurant week many. For starters my husband and I shared the empanadas and the kale salad. The kale salad was actually delicious and definitely big enough for the 2 of us the share. The empanadas dish came with 4 small empanadas; they were good and kind of tasted like a creamy jalapeño popper. For the main dish we both got the short rib. The dish seems small but was surprisingly filling. Just an FYI it comes with a cold potato salad. For dessert, we both chose the donuts that came with a berry, caramel and chocolate sauce. The donuts were pretty standard, but I loved the chocolate and berry sauces. In terms of food, I felt like we got a good value. We both each ordered a cocktail, which were pretty standard, nothing impressive and about $18 each. For 2 of us ordering from the restaurant week menu and each getting a cocktail we ended up paying $150, which isn't bad.

4.0,8/17/2018,"I would give this place 3 stars, but the only reason I'm giving it 4 is because of the beautiful ambiance and the fact that they have a vegan menu (very accommodating). I had reservations for 8:15 and I wasn't seated until 8:40, which sucked. I understand the place is busy but if you have a reservation you shouldn't be waiting that long. All that aside, the place itself is so trendy and filled with younger groups. You almost feel transformed when you walk into the restaurant doors like you're in a completely different area. It's definitely romantic, but the music is so loud it's hard to hear your date! The tables are all pretty packed close to each other, so be mindful of that. As for the food, the only thing worth it to me we're the tomato and grilled cheese appetizers. So unique, creative, and my god were they full of flavor. I never thought I'd be so impressed with a grilled cheese! My boyfriend got the salmon entree, which was a decent size. I got the vegan meatballs, which had lots of great flavor. But the serving size was so small! 4 meatballs for $23- a complete rip off.

The vibe is amazing, décor is great, people watching and cocktails great, food presentation beautiful, but the food mediocre. The 3 of us in our party selected 6 different foods to be shared. The Tomato soup on a spoon was fine not a huge amount of flavor. But we were building on flavor or, so I thought. Next the most memorable selection was Caesar toast. I was delicious. The Past Garganelli was okay not a bold flavor. We had meatballs which were fine and the sauce was a little bland. The broccolini was also pretty good served with soy and garlic. The final item we shared was dessert. A chocolate layer cake with vanilla bean ice cream. It was okay but I would not go here again and spend a lot of money on food and cocktails.

It's beautiful and fun, their drinks are great and they have a rose bar in the women's bathroom and the bathroom itself is beautiful. My fiancé was jealous that the guys don't have something similar in their bathroom. It's also a very trendy, social media-photo-sharing-worthy type of place. You'll find most people dressed their best while you're there, so, if you don't want to feel out of place, I suggest dressing the part but no pressure. Oh yes, food, how can I forget about that part, right? Their food is served ""family style"" with the beginning of the menu being the tiniest portions and the larger or the closest thing to entrees will be found in the back of the menu. Just keep in mind their portions aren't large in general, it's more like tapas or appetizer size. It's best to get a few different things and share. It's great for dates, meeting and eating with friends and family.

Yum!The Kale & Apple Salad with apple cider vinaigrette, pancetta, candied pecans, shaved goat cheese was not bad. I missed the part about goat cheese, or I would have had them leave it out. They were amenable to taking out the pork, so I'm sure they would have taken out the cheese. This was a very large salad.The Peruvian Chicken with jalapeño salsa verde, sweet peas, carrots, zucchini & yellow squash was a little better. I'm spoiled by the salsa verde from Pio Pio, so I didn't think much of the salsa here, except that it did have a nice kick.

Peruvian chicken (very flavorful), and the bolognese pasta (my favorite dish!). We also ordered 3 desserts - the carrot cake sundae (I would order this every time), the chocolate cake (very good!) and the strawberry shortcake.

Natural lighting during the day and subtle mood lighting in the evening. The service is quite good and so are the drinks. You can definitely tell the people working there know what they are doing. I started with the avocado toast which was good. Its avocado toast so its hard to be life shatteringly good but I liked it. For entree's I tried both the short ribs and the salmon. What I did notice is that the portion size vary quite a bit across the menu. The short rib portion was small and the salmon portion was sizeable. The shortribs were cooked well and the dish was tasty for sure. Wish there was a but more. So was the salmon and couscous, although it was pretty forgettable. To end the meal I had the sorbet. It was partially melted when it got to me but my main issue was it was super sweet and quite grainy like it was over-churned. Ultimately it was a solid meal, even considering the short comings here and there. Almost 4 stars for sure.

Food:We decided to share everything and we got the Crab Rangoon Toast, Chile Relleno Empanadas, Grilled Cheese Smoked Bacon & Tomato Dumplings, Bulgogi Ribeye Tacos, Doughnuts, and Butterscotch Pot de Creme.  Everything was equally delicious but I really recommend the Bulgogi Tacos and Butterscotch - definitely the highlights.  The only thing I would say are the portions are small.  The food is high quality, but if you are coming with an eater you can definitely spend a lot!Ambiance:It's definitely bougie, but sometimes that's nice right?  The front pawn shop is cool, the inside of the restaurant is gorgeous and even the bathrooms are super nice.

They were able to get our party of four in a quiet little couch by the bar. If you think you're walking into a pawn shop, that's what it looks like from the outside but when you walk through their ""secret"" door you instantly feel like you're in a movie scene of an exclusive club. Glamour, bling, ambiancé, vibes, it has it all. The service is amazing, you feel like an elite, a superstar. We came here to order drinks but we were starving so we decided to go for it and try out the food. From my experience, places like these just don't have good food. They'll have overpriced food with tiny bites and you leave starving. Well, I have to say I was wrong and pleasantly surprised. The drinks: let's start with the drinks. What each one of us ordered was on point. Each individual drink was amazing. High end, delicious, strong. Exactly what I wanted to get. The drinks definitely took us there, they were 5 out of 5.The food: OMG. I definitely wasn't expecting the food to be THIS amazing. We ordered ravioli :: drooling :: it was rich, it was explosive, delicious. I also ordered an eggplant pizzetta. Eggplant was crispy, airy, fresh mozzarella, fresh ingredients. 5 out of 5 once again.This place, even the ladies room was AMAZING. I was so upset I left my phone in my purse and didn't bring it down with me. The powder room experience is out of this world. Glamour, mirrors, private bar, couches. You literally just want to stay in there all night. It was amazing. This place is a 5 out of 5. Definitely a MUST if you're in the city.

4.0,7/25/2018,"Mmmm, I've been here multiple times and each time the food did not disappoint. Note that the portions are small but high quality, and the price reflects that. Would highly recommend to make a reservation in advance.I called ahead to tell them we were going to be late because it was the weekend and the M train wasn't working so we had to walk from Grand St. They said they give you a 15 minute grace period. I was hoping that we would make it there within 15 minutes but ended up being closer to 18 minutes late because it was raining too. Even though I called ahead to tell them I would be late, they still gave us a slight attitude and told us to wait (but they didn't know how long it would be). We ended up walking around the place to kill time and ended up waiting half an hour before another table was ready. Anyway, back to the positives. Here are some of my favorites:- Grilled cheese, smoked bacon & tomato soup dumplings- Crispy fish tacos- Oven braised chicken meatballsWhat was great was that they are flexible in adjusting the servings based on the number of people at your table. Such as, one of the dishes comes with 3 things but since we had 4 people, they were able to serve 4 in the dish instead so you're not awkwardly having to split something with one person from your party.Word of advice, check out the champagne bar in the women's bathroom, make reservation in advance and don't be late, enjoy the tapas style (they suggested for a party of 4 to order 6-8 things), and be prepared that your bill will be high.

As I mentioned earlier, the service was not great, but our server mentioned that they were short staffed. It did seem like there were many people working (hosts? managers?) who really weren't doing much except walking around the dining room while the bus boys and servers diligently worked to keep things running smoothly.

2.0,7/21/2018,"2 stars for decor. Given all the hype on yelp, i thought this was a speakeasy like the Aviary where you needed reservations so I made a reservation for 10pm. I called ahead telling them I'm going to be 15min late because of the rain and traffic. The lady said I have a 15min grace period after which thee would be a wait.. I was a little confused by that bc the point of calling ahead was to let them know to hold the table.We got there at 10:15pm no one greeted us or directed us anywhere, and we didn't get seated until 10:45pm. We just waited and didn't order anything at the bar because wanted to make sure our waiter would be able to benefit from the tip. It was annoying to wait but then we were finally seated. We got our drinks. Drinks were mediocre - sound fancy but not worth $17 plus tip. My drink from the sweet section wasn't sweet and my husbands got a drink from the savory section but he didn't like it so told the waiter. He literally tried to drink it but couldn't. The waiter basically said he can't trade it out until we order more drinks and to get something else on the menu. A good waiter (literally everywhere else in every other city) would have tried to make it better or swap it out because which bar wants to be known for having bad drinks?Then he asked us if we were going to order food like 3 times and finally at 11:30pm when we said no, he had the nerve to say management doesn't like the tables to be used for drinks but he is personally ok with it... ummm first if he's actually ok with it, he wouldn't have said it. Second, if management cares so much then they should write that on opentable. And third, not sure how many people eat dinner at after 11:30pm. There were plenty of empty tables... if I was a restaurant/bar owner I would feel like an idiot saying that to my customers... there's a time and place for that policy, and 11:30pm is not it. I was expected this place to be like The Aviary or a small speakeasy where you needed reservations (like the ones in San Francisco). Instead it was really loud (we could barely talk), and it was two stories, playing clubby music. It's everything, a restaurant, lounge, club, speakeasy, can dress up or dress down.... can't be everything.. I will give this place 2 years before people realize it's not worth it. Service really left a bad taste in my mouth. Won't be back again ever, nor would I recommend this place to anyone who wants a guaranteed good time.",2,3,0,Dipika S.,"San Francisco, CA",1,18,27
5.0,7/18/2018,Such a fun spot. Food is great! Entrance is deceiving which makes it that much more cool and interesting. Service was great. Fast and hot. We got our dinner right after the appetizers. The waiter was super sweet and recommends great drinks as well as have us a glass of champagne and desert on the house to celebrate our anniversary! Upstairs is a cool lounge area to continue your evening instead of heading out to find another spot to have drinks.

5.0,7/17/2018,"Beauty & Essex has to be my favorite restaurant in New York. The only reasons I typically don't take photos in an establishment is because I'm underwhelmed, the food doesn't look good, or there's nothing worth taking photos of. From the second we walked into Beauty & Essex, I was in awe and taking it all in. From walking into a pawnshop to a restaurant with gorgeous decor and a stellar menu, I forgot I even had a phone and was too busy living in the moment and enjoying everything this restaurant had to offer.The ambiance was beyond unique, the service was perfect, the drinks were creative and fun, and the food was mind-blowing. Over dinner, I enjoyed the Emerald Gimlet and Green With Envy cocktails. They were fantastic! We had the Kale & Apple Salad, Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos (our favorite dish of the night, so we orderd a few), Crab Rangoon, Grilled Cheese & Smoked Bacon Tomato Soup, and Bulgogi Ribeye Tacos.

The hostess stared at her computer screen the WHOLE TIME.When we were finally seated, we literally sat there for 26 MINUTES. Not one person came to the table to ask us how we were or even offer a glass of water. COMPLETELY DISGUSTING. Then a group of about 7-10 caucasian women came in and they were immediately seated as well as served water and were even placing orders! After my party and I were fed up, we decided to get up and leave and the nerve of the hostess to say ""Have a Nice Day!""I am truly not the kind of person to bring RACE into situations but this was truly an evident situation in which was obviously a factor.

Every single dish was cooked perfectly and presented well. Our waiter even took it a step further by getting us a 4th Seared Scallop as the dish originally comes with 3.  This place has great customer service.  We always had clean plates for the next dishes being served. There was even one time my water was halfway full and when I reached for it, it was full. My friend had to tell me they filled it as we were talking.

When you go allow enough time to explore the items for sale. We didn't do this because our time was short. But wow what an experience. From start to finish. What I loved about our experience was there were 5 of us and the plates were big enough to share, if you wanted. My food was out of this world. The grits were amazing and smooth and full of flavor. Well, sweet flavor so it was different but I'm a good way.  I can't begin to describe all of the dishes we shared during our meal but everyone one of them were amazing. And our dessert.

I was raving about needing to come here on our last day in NY. (We came here on a Saturday 1:30pm)First of all I'm not the one to really stress prices because if it's worth it then why not! But $17 for a crappy mimosa?! Second, I ordered the chicken meatballs thinking they would be as good as the ones in Vegas.... one word; flavorless. Don't do it. We also ordered the eggs and grits that were bland and flavorless as well. The Cesar toast only came with three slices so the waiter askew if I wanted an extra slice since it was two of us and I said yes.... the meatballs also came as 3 but the waiter decided to add a 4th one as well without asking. The crappy meatball was 6 extra dollars on the bill that we never agreed to. Anyways, spare yourself and visit another place. We are in NY after all",1,0,0,Camila D.,"Hollywood, FL",0,18,6

Just handed us the drink menus and didn't say a word throughout our 45 min at the bar. He was like this with every customer that ordered. Wouldn't kill you to smile or interact a little. Anyway, drinks were good regardless. We decided to order the grilled cheese dumplings, ravioli, carpaccio and the burger with bbq fries. Our server was great-recommended some popular dishes.

The crowd was great and so was the ambience. Very dim, casual and cool vibe. The food was excellent, the service was great as well. Evening heading to the ladies room was an experience - they were serving champagne! What I loved about this place is that we didn't want to leave.

Great music, food and crowd is usually the case...however, I would not recommend being there for a birthday or a special event weekend. As a prior server I try my best to be as understanding as possible, however it was very was lackluster service to say the least.My group and I had ordered vegan and non vegan items for the table and also explained that one person was allergic to pork, the soup dumplings got dropped with bacon so they kindly replaced it with another however our server looked turned off that we had eaten dropped off mistake dumplings. Most high end establishments comp their mistake but I was given the impression that wasn't the case. Our server came back and said: so you guys liked those huh? ...I wished they would have taken it from our table if that wasn't the policy. My friend's drink was also forgotten to no real apology except a smiley attitude (response: you don't want your drink now? You have more food otw), and to top it off our first round of waters had raw onion in it. We ordered two more dishes and a fry was clearly forgotten as it was dropped off 10 minutes later. She seemed to touch other tables for extended amount of times and had no real convo with us. I'm assuming she had friends on other tables as that was made apparent throughout the night. It was my 30th and I wished B+E did something to acknowledge a special milestone as noted in my reservation. Having been and worked in high end restaurants I was sadly surprised. I got more acknowledgment of my high school diploma at a Red Robin. I did not want to write this review as I love b+e except I also took my time to kindly explain all of this to a manager it seemed like she would give us a round of shots on the House but instead we got a bill with mistake dumpling, nothing comped, with an additional 15 minute wait for a fix. By the time we finished with a long 3 hour dinner the dance floor was already closed, had service been more smooth without as many mistakes and actual customer service occurred with a regular conversation it would have been clear I was there for a birthday and wanted to dance for a few songs.

EVERYTHING IS TAPA STYLE SO ORDER FOR THE TABLE.We had:- avocado toast (small so order two if everyone loves it)- chicken tender sliders (also small) - kale salad -amazinggggg - blueberry pancakes SO good.Upstairs there's also a party after brunch and there's a brunch up there too. must go!!!-",3,1,1,Camila M.,"Orlando, FL",309,78,45

5.0,5/25/2018,Stopped in here for a quick bite with the fiancé and had the chicken burger and veggie burger. Fiancé was hesitant about the veggie burger but they assured her it was top of the line so she took the plunge. She tends to be picky about her food but all her doubts were reassured once it came out. Veggie burger is definitely the way to go. Emmy was our bartender and she was outstanding. She explained all the drinks and food on the menu and was really nice and accommodating. She definitely made us feel at home and we'll be back for some of the specials she mentioned.

4.0,5/23/2018,"In the land where secret code entrances and invite only moving parties reign supreme, Beauty and Essex gives us regular people a taste of the exclusive life. Fronted by the fanciest pawn shop front I've seen, hidden doors give way to a lavishly decorated, mood lighted resto-lounge verberating with the latest club bangers (but still low enough for conversation). We arrived relatively late (around 9-10pm) so the place was full but with walking and sitting room. After some confusion with seating, we were placed in a booth in the main dining room. Between 3 people, we Ordered the roasted baby carrots, broccolini, spicy salmon tartare, shisito peppers, Thai style shrimp and some other items I can't quite remember. While the food was good, I wouldn't say it was fantastic. Maybe it was the timing (1hr to close) but, I could barely eat the overcooked carrots soaked in a sweet sticky sauce and the Thai style shrimp lacked the depth and tang of most Thai style dishes. With a couple of tequila shots and drinks, our bill came to around $180USD with tax and gratuity. It wasn't cheap but, it wasn't overly expensive either.For the atmosphere and uniqueness of this place, I would come back for a second try. It wouldnt be at the top of my list but, if I had friends who wanted to try (even just for the experience/atmosphere), I would definitely come back.

1.0,5/23/2018,"My boyfriend and I came here for my birthday on Sunday night. It was good, but that's it. The food was just as good as any cheaper gastropub, so that was very disappointing. For those prices, I expected it to be amazing, or at the very least great. The drinks were also just Ok; again, not great for those prices. The waiter was for the most part attentive, except when I asked to see a wine list later in the meal. I assumed he'd come back sort of quickly knowing I wanted to order a glass of wine, but I had to flag him down to order it. Not a big deal, though. I really wanted to give it 2-1/2 stars because the most disappointing (and grossest) part was a bunch of stuff or something floating in both of our waters. We didn't say anything because we didn't notice until after we signed the check, and the waiter didn't come back. All in all, good experience, but I definitely wouldn't come back or recommend to anyone.UPDATE: I meant to update this a couple months ago and forgot. I changed my rating from 3 stars to 1 because it gave me diarrhea that night. Also forgot to mention how loud the music was.

I had been looking forward to coming and sampling the cocktails.  I called to confirm and was told we needed to come at 8pm instead of 8:30pm to increase our booking to 6 (we requested).  We showed up at 8pm and were told the table wasn't ready and were given a pager. After nearly an hour we finally are paged and leave our seats upstairs in the lounge to gather at reception and learn that our table still is not ready.  So we stand in the crowded reception area for 10 more minutes and are finally seated after WAITING AN HOUR.  To compensate we receive a round of very sweet prosecco.  Sparkling wine is free in the ladies lounge downstairs...The food was the highlight - perfect scallops on a delicious corn relish (excellent!), bone-in prime rib, beet salad, and the hamburger were outstanding.  The cocktails we had upstairs were good - especially the gimlet.  At dinner, the same cocktails were completely different.  Overall the cocktails were overly sweet - even the savory ones.  I ordered a Manhattan that was good.  We would have appreciated having a bottle of water on the table since our glasses were not refilled often enough.  No need to ever return, but I hope the bachelorette groups keep coming to B&E and stay away from the places I love in NYC!",0,0,0,Stephanie W.,"San Francisco, CA",44,67,2

5.0,5/19/2018,"Everything about this place is extremely unique, from the exterior to interior design and the food itself.The outside of the restaurant is deceiving; it looks like a record store from the outside. My friends and I were extremely confused at first and when we walked in to ask we were shocked to find that it was actually the restaurant. Another door inside the little front reception area leads to the actual restaurant itself. With the mix of the name, almost reminds me of a Beauty and the Beast themed restaurant with the chandelier lights. I went for a bachelorette party and our servers suggested a tapas style dinner which was basically selecting up to 8-9 different types of food on the menu and they'll make one serving for each person at the table. This is a great way to try multiple different foods. One of my favorites was wonton tacos and bbq fries. The fries reminded of basically lays bbq chips! Highly recommended for a fancy night out!

1.0,5/19/2018,"I wanted to come here for so long. I was going to give the food 4 stars until I went to bed and got the feeling I had to sh*t my pants. My stomach hurt so bad, but I had ate a lot of food that day so to make sure it was Beauty & Essex that gave me food poisoning, I texted my friend: ""I think I got food poisoning from dinner, are you ok?"" She responded, ""literally was thinking the same thing! I had such a bad stomachache and could barely stand up/walk back. Had to lay down immediately. I think it was the salmon tartare."" The salmon tartare wasn't even that good. It came on top of rice crackers and it just was a weird texture combination. The ""crispy"" fish tacos were NOT crispy. The breading of the batter is not meant to be give you that crispy outer layer. Not only was it soft and not warm, the taco was the driest taco shell I've ever had. It tasted like a cheap fast food taco. What a rip off. It could have also been the food poisoning culprit because it tasted like it's been sitting out for a while. If you deep fry a fish, it's supposed to come out piping hot. The food was room temperature, you can guess for yourself how long it's been sitting out. The only decent dish was the octopus cassoulet. It was spicy and had chorizo that saved the fish. The octopus as really tender, the beans could have been more tender.Obviously, I know you run the risk of food poisoning if you consume raw food, and that's why the put the * so they don't incur liability. But it's not ACTUALLY supposed to give you food poisoning unless your restaurant is unsanitary. I eat sushi all the time and have had no problems. I didn't expect such a local favorite to give me and my friend food poisoning.They serve champagne in the bathroom. But I would be so hesitant to get it because the place looks dingy. When I walked into the the restaurant, I caught a whiff of urine smell. I was like whatever, it's new york. But she lead us upstairs to our table and the smell continued. I can't tell if it's their cleaning supplies or the diffuser they use but I can't be the only person to think it smelled like urine in the whole restaurant!!!!

4.0,5/14/2018,"Came with 6 girlfriends to celebrate a birthday this past Friday. The food, drinks, ambience were pretty fantastic overall!Food: 4/5, in order of most to least favorite.Bulgogi Tacos- 5/5- the marinated ribeye was just so juicy! That tender meat was amazing with the crispy wonton skin shell but the kimchi slaw was what made this dish unbelievably tasty- perfection!Octopus Cassoulet- 5/5- the pieces of octopus were very well cooked and the spicy tomato broth was amazing! I liked the little beans and bites of chorizo too- added different textures to every bite.Chicken Meatballs- 5/5- these melt-in-your-mouth meatballs were so succulent and creamy! That ricotta cheese and truffle oil made these so indulgently delicious! Kale and Apple Salad- 4/5- the bite of pancetta and cheese were sooooo good with the acidic apple. The kale was crisp and refreshing with the tangy vinaigrette. Works well to balance out the heavier dishes we had too. Roasted Bone Marrow- 3/5- this was ok- nothing too special as every restaurant seems to offer this dish now. The marrow itself was a bit on the hard and slightly stringy? side but the red marmalade was a nice tart addition! Lobster Mac & Cheese- 0/5- the biggest disappointment of the evening. There are barely any lobster pieces in here so you're basically paying a ridiculous price for Mac and cheese... honestly the entire dish was suffocated by dry bread crumbs that made it super grainy so this is a hard pass.Drinks: 5/5Red wine- bottles of Malbec were delish! White wine- bottles of Albariño equally delish!Ambience: 4.5/5The place is very fun, hidden behind a thrift shop store front. The waiters were all great- until the end when they kept forgetting to bring us additional glasses of wine...And yes, like others, we also spent an inordinate  amount of time in the bathroom- courtesy comfy couches, sparkling rose champagne, and lovely ladies just wanting to chat with each other.We met several gal groups from out of state- and even ended up going to Mr. Purple (rooftop bar nearby) with a trio from Cali!

4.0,5/12/2018,"B&E is every bit as grandiose as you probably already imagine it to be.  In fact, it might be even more so.  But what's impressive is that as over-the-top as the decor may be, it's still incredibly stylish and trendy (except the upstairs bar that glows pink).We came here on a Friday night with a 7:15 reservation.  OpenTable reservations are accepted no more than 30 days in advance, and prime times are snatched up quickly.  When we arrived, we were told there was a table just paying their bill and were handed one of those tacky buzzers that would alert us when our table was ready.  The front entryway was madhouse packed with people all waiting for a table, which was really annoying.  We finally got seated around 7:30.  The dining room we were seated in had 4 empty tables, so I'm not sure what the delay was about.The restaurant is known for their tapas, which our waiter suggested we order 3-5 of for 2 people.  We tried their popular grilled cheese dumplings ($17), bulgogi ribeye tacos ($19), and fish tacos ($24).  Both of the tacos come in servings of 3, so our waiter gave us the option of ordering 4 at an additional cost (+$6/bulgogi and +$8/fish).  The dumplings were my favorite of the tapas; cheesy and tomato-y and bacon-y.  The bulgogi tacos came in 2nd; the meat had the perfect balance of sweet and savory, but the kimchi was a bit too spicy for me.  The fish tacos were also good, but a bit more average.For entrees, my cousin had the filet ($48) with BBQ fries ($12) and I had the lobster mac & cheese ($18), which was actually a side, but the portion is pretty big.  The filet was a disappointment, especially for the price.  My cousin ordered it at medium doneness, but it was cooked well-done.  I'm sure the kitchen would've fixed this if we notified them, but my cousin refused to send it back because she felt bad.  The fries were tasty, but just a bit too reminiscent of BBQ potato chips.  And the lobster mac & cheese had large chunks of lobster and was very cheesy, but just a bit underseasoned.The cocktails ($17) are well-made and delicious.  On the menu, they are categorized as sweet or savory, and I got to try both.  The ODB (Old Dirty Bramble), the Ruby Mojito, and the Woodsman all had well-balanced flavors and gave me a nice buzz.PS.

It was pretty empty inside when we first arrived. The only caveat was that we had to get up in an hour and a half to accommodate for the actual reservation.

The spices they added layered well and the bbq fries are my new favorite thing. The decor was totally my esthetic. The pictures don't do it justice.

Once you tell them you have reservations they open a door and your lead into a really cool hip looking spot. We were on time for the reservation but our table wasn't ready so we grabbed a drink at the bar. Shortly after we got sat. Majority of the menu is small plates so we ordered a few to share. We got the poke tacos,  gilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings, and the thai shrimp. All the items were great with the star being grilled cheese dumplings with tomato soup. Very tasty! The service was a bit slow and I found out why- our server told is mid meal she was leaving and someone else was taking the table. It was 11pm at night and the place was packed so kinda odd.All in all a nice spot but a bit pricy. definitely a good date night or girls night out place.

It ends up being much more cavernous than I expected, and the restaurant has a bar in front, but many more seating options in the back. There are tables, booths, and face-to-face couple seating - so plenty of configurations depending on your group size.Be prepared to be yelling because of how absurdly loud the music is. The menu is interesting - lots of creative spins on NYC takeout food, served tapas-style and meant for sharing. Think tomato soup dumplings, spicy salmon tartare, burgers with three kinds of meat, etc. I think the food was pretty tasty, and would have definitely given the cocktails a try if I were up for drinking.I just hated how trendy of a vibe, how ""wannabe"" the guests were at the restaurant, dressing up to the nines and such. It's not my vibe, but if you wanted to impress Cousin Maryanne who's never been to the big ol' city, I think Beauty & Essex would be perfect.",0,0,0,Jin C.,"New York, NY",36,1100,328

The entrance itself was fun and unique, I was hoping to surprise my son, but after our horrible drive, which we could have walked faster, I just wanted to get inside before it was too late. Tables are really close, so if you plan on having an intimate dinner forget it, but who does anymore, when you look around each table and everyone is on their cell phones. :(Service was top notch, as we looked at the menu and asked what is their speciality, the hype was the grilled cheese tomato soup dumplings, fun, unique presentation. Once we finally ordered, our waiter came back to tell my son, they ran out of salmon, it was only 8:30 PM. really?, that was disappointing, he opted for the tuna.

3.0,4/24/2018,"I have mixed feelings about this place.  It's loud, with good music and a busy crowd of people (ideal for people watching). It felt like an upscale and packed Applebee's because you're standing there for an hour for a reservation you made a week ago, and they hand you those little buzzers while you wait. Unlike an Applebee's or ruby Tuesday's, the  food was actually decent and did not go bad after an hour of sitting. Despite this there were no standouts in the 4-5 dishes we ordered (including the burger), but the drinks were strong (which I was hoping for). I still can't justify the price. Personally, a place this trendy I recommend for boozy birthday brunch or if a friend is visiting from out of town, but it felt a little bit overrated upon reflection. My one eye roll moment was the girl in the scantily clad bandeau dress and nude six inch heels who was having a photo session that blocked the stairwell from the bathroom to the first floor. She was frustrated by the people coming and going. Gee I'm sorry you are not able to capture the ""200+ likes"" worthy Instagram photo you're trying to achieve in the middle of the stairwell.

5.0,4/23/2018,"Went for DinnerFood - 5/5. The food items are creative and delicious. Tuna sashimi was fresh with the avocado mousse adding a rich creaminess. Grilled cheese soup dumplings were a nice take on a classic comfort food. The soup had just the right amount cream to tomato ratio and the grilled cheese were in delectable little bites. Surprisingly, my favorite was the side of broccolini. The greens were cooked to a great almost al dente bite and had a really good mix of salty and spicy dressing. The surf n' turf was disappointing compared to everything else. The sear on the meats were good but the hard pork belly and soft scallops didn't really contrast well together and just created a wonky texture when combined. The puree was sweet and smooth enough to cover the meats but it wasn't strong enough to replace a sauce.Service - 4/5. Very professional and courteous. We came near the time of the kitchen closing so they were prompt with the service but we never felt rushed.Value - 4/5. Food is delicious and has a lot of unique experiences to offer.

This review is months overdue but I can still remember that first bite of the:- Grilled cheese, smoked bacon, and tomato soup dumplings. It was presented on a spoon as it is a one bite type of food. So juicy and a burst of flavor! - Roasted bone marrow with added truffle: it was standard bone marrow. Barely got any and the added truffle was a bit disappointing bc I didn't really get that potent truffle flavor.  Not my fave dish.- Spicy Salmon Tartare: fresh, tasty and creamy with the guacamole! Must get if you love anything salmon. - Surf and Turf: pork belly was so crispy yet tender. The scallops were cooked perfectly - bouncy yet has an outside char. Must get too :)- Lobster mac and cheese. It was good but I think Mastros version is better for the price. - Biscuit and Apple Bread Pudding: I LOVE bread pudding and order it everywhere I go so this was a no brainer.

At $95 a person they serve you one glass of champagne and a fixed menu of basically appetizers. I felt they gave very little food. I definitely left there still very hungry. The ambiance is beautiful. Dj is lit. Drinks are normal Manhattan rooftop bar prices. All in all great place to go. However the brunch just is not worth the price. Also nothing Boozy about the brunch seeing as that you get one glass of champagne. I'm issued to the nyc boozy brunches with unlimited drinks.

Anyhow, the food tasted like a slightly better version of TGI Friday's or airport food, considering that this is New York (home of some of the best restaurants on the planet) I was very disappointed...maybe this would be good for somewhere like Alabama...maybe. The majority of people that come here seem to be tourist, i guess I was one of the few New Yorkers who didn't get the memo. The space itself is beautiful but everything else is so tacky that you end up overlooking it and just not caring. Also the cheese factor is off the charts. They try to make it look ""exclusive"" and ""hidden"" by making you enter through a mock guitar shop, before you go in they check if your name is on the list. Sorry, but cheesy.

Still a romantic setting, just a little bit loud. It's a scene. Dress for the occasion. Make a reservation even if it's a weeknight. It's best to save yourself the hassle. All staff is a little pretentious, but that's what I signed up for when I came here. Also, service wasn't that great- our waiter was MIA most of the night or just day dreaming. I had to wave him down to order, to get the check. I would have given 5 stars, but they lose a star for service. The quality of the food pleasantly surprised me. For two people, were ordered 3 tapas because we were only moderately hungry. The waiter told us that parties of 2 usually order 5-6 plates. I thought this sounded excessive and I'm glad I didn't listen. We didn't even finish our 3 plates. Chicken meatballs- Small plate. The hint of Truffle oil is quite strong, but still tasty. The fresh ricotta made this plate. Eggplant pizzetta- This was the largest plate we ordered. Crispy, rich sauce, and again, the whipped ricotta was the highlight. Thai deep fried shrimp- Small plate.

Maybe come when it's a special occasion or a rare girls night out because the ambiance is really nice and lots of photo ops, food to share (they're tapas style), interesting cocktails (both w and wout alcohol), and free champagne bar in the ladies room. My husband and I came on a Monday night and the crowd was right up our alley. More our age (over 30), music wasn't obnoxious, service was phenomenal (Amber was our server and loved her). I imagine the weekends are filled with a younger crowd (as some reviews say) and is much busier/crowded. So try to come on a week night. Food is pretty good. Maybe those reviews with disappointment came when the kitchen had an off day?  We ordered the tomato soup dumplings, braised chicken meatballs, and bulgogi tacos. The dumplings were the winner. Wish I could've tried the raw bar but I'm pregnant and sadly had to stay away.  The tacos were messy and a bit greasy to eat but good beef flavor overall. Chicken meatballs were good but maybe order a pasta to share? The devils food layered cake was ok. The cake could've been more moist but the vanilla mascarpone filling and ganache icing were the stars. Garnet gimblet was a virgin cocktail I ordered and if it wasn't $9 I'd have ordered another.

3.0,2/19/2018,"This spot is super kitschy and fun, but there are some drawbacks to eating here.You walk through a jewelry store and on the other side of the wall you are transported to a chic new world. Super fun! Also on the other side, it's gorgeous with a sweeping stair case and a gorgeous foliage covered sky light. As with most New York City restaurants, space is a bit limited. We were seated quite comfortably, however the table next to us was a veritable revolving door of diners, each being seated and then asking to move until some unquestioning college kids were placed there and didn't know enough to ask for a switch, despite waitstaff and other patrons struggled to get by through out their meal.We were here for restaurant week, which allowed us to try a number of different items at a bit of a lower price. However, there was one item not included on the restaurant week menu that our waitress vociferously recommended -- the tomato soup with grilled cheese dumplings. And honestly, this dish was the most disappointing of the lot. The soup was kind of lukewarm and the dish was just not as mind blowing as we were led to believe. Oh well, you live and you learn. I was glad I tried it either way.For our first course, we went with the chile relleno empanadas which were super delicious and on another waitress recommendation we went with the tuna poke wonton tacos, which were solidly good.Second course, we went with the braised short ribs, which was good, but the vegetable hash underneath was very acidic and vinegary.  We also ordered the spaghettini, which was delicious, but incredibly spicy and there was no mention of it being spicy on the menu, at all.For dessert we shared the vanilla panna cotta and the LES, NYC doughnuts. You can't go wrong with either of those.I would come back with maybe a larger group to get a good sampling of all there is to offer, but overall I wasn't terribly impressed by what we ordered.",2,0,1,Katie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",144,220,20

5.0,2/18/2018,"This was my first stop during Restaurant Week. This  place set high expectations for the others I visited! I love that you walk into a pawn shop and then walk into this grand, almost mansion like restaurant. What a surprise! Started off with the grilled cheese bites and tomato soup. DELICIOUS!!!! The presentation was very cute too. First course, I chose the Chile Relleno Empenadas. Thought it would come with one, but came with 4 mini ones. The flavors were good and they were crisp! My friend had the kale salad, very big portion and the dressing was perfect. Second course was the Braised Short Rib and OMG! The meat melted in my mouth, easily cut with a fork. Sauce perfectly complimented it. Creamed Brussels was nothing I expected. They were chopped and seasoned well. Everything on the plate was to die for. Damn near wanted to lick my plate!!!! My friend chose the pasta, which was good as well. Had a little kick to it, which I liked. For desert we chose all 3. 4 huge donut bites, with 3 different sauces. Donuts were warm and not too chewy. Red velvet cupcakes were moist. But the Panna Cotta was the star! It was dense, but a perfect consistency. Underneath was a berry sauce and when scooped all at once it was the best bite!The other win for this restaurant is if your a lady, please visit the restroom. There is complimentary champagne!!Overall, I would come back here any day. This place has great presentation, everything is seasoned well and cooked perfectly. No complaints!!!

4.0,2/11/2018,"Made reservations here for my best friends birthday. Beauty and Essex has been around for a few years and never seems to disappoint. They're known for they're thrift store entrance, without looking on yelp  or looking online you wouldn't know what to expect. Once you enter through the thrift shop entrance you approach double doors which is the real entrance and WOW you're blown away! The ambiance is sexy, and alive. The bar is buzzing with tons of people, as they have some of the best mixologists in town. We had a 6:45pm reservation on a Friday night, we arrived about 10 minutes late and was told we would probably have to wait at the bar because they can't hold tables for that long ‍. Luckily, the hostess was able to accommodate us, and seat us just minutes later. We were seated in the larger dining room which has high ceilings and the lighting is dim. We ordered A few appetizers to start to share, like the lobster Mac and cheese which is super cheesy ( delish but so much dairy is not a good idea ) we also ordered a round of oysters, a salad and the soup to share ( I forgot what the soup was called but it was no ordinary soup. It was on a spoon, 6 spoons to be exact hence why we were able to share . Our waitress was busy, you could tell because the place was busy and she never really checked up on us. I was to deep in conversations to care, but others noticed. I ordered the salmon, medium. It was pretty good.. nothing crazy. What was crazy, was our bill . I mean we did order a lot and the guys kept tossing those drinks back but sheesh. $600 for all of that...which resulted in all of us putting in $150 each, not horrible but my eyes definitely almost fell out of my head when seeing the bill that high.

While i really enjoyed a few items like the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings, i thought everything else was just average. The red velvet waffles were a little dry, the mac and cheese was slightly runny, coffee was bland and tasted like it came from a diner, and the chicken biscuit sandwiches fell apart after the first bite. The staff was nice overall, but they did forget our fish tacos until the very end and took 20 minutes to get it to us after they realised. To top it off, it was pretty overpriced for what it was.

The eggplant almost felt like they are pepperoni without the guilt. Empanadas: not bad, but nothing to write home about. Short ribs: a bit dry. It has nice marbled fat, but the ribs could have used more spices, sauce or rub. Salmon: nicely done.

4.0,1/28/2018,"TLDR: Upscale place for tapas at fairly high prices. Reserve in advance. Best dishes are lemon pancakes, grilled cheese dumplings, and short rib huevos rancheros! Overall rating: A-For first timers, here's how you get in: Walk through the pawn shop and head to the big door in the back in the left corner. Open it and head into the secret sanctuary. Dress up a bit. It's pretty fancy in here. It's hard to get a reservation. You need to make it well in advance to get your pick of times. Especially for brunch. I went here for my birthday brunch this year with 3 friends. I made a reservation a month in advance for Saturday at 1:30pm. Make sure you get there on time. They generally can't accommodate late parties. They will hold your table for about 15 minutes. It's beautiful inside. The ladies lounge downstairs includes complimentary prosecco during dinner hours only I think! It wasn't available during brunch. Make sure you bring singles for tip! You don't want to be THAT person! There were mostly women brunching when we went. A lot of them were very dressy. There's a big skylight in the center. They need more air conditioning though. It was pretty warm in there. It was 50 degrees outside that day. They suggest 6-8 small tapas dishes for a party of 4. We got 6 dishes. We were way too full. We will get only 5 dishes next time. We had 3 light eaters and 1 person with a big appetite. Most dishes seem to serve 3 but they'll ask if you want the portions to feed 4 or however big your party is (which means additional charges of course). The service is pretty good. They bring you out a couple dishes at a time. It took us about 2 hours to finish our meal.  The sixth dish took much longer to come out. Make sure you save up. This is a pretty expensive restaurant. Onto the food:-LEMON BLACKBERRY PANCAKES (sweet ricotta cream): Full sized large pancakes! So good and fluffy! Not too sweet. Also served with syrup if you prefer added sweetness. Not much fruit in the pancakes though. I think I just got one blackberry in the center. I'd love a couple more blackberries dispersed throughout the pancakes. We received 4 pancakes. A-GRILLED CHEESE, SMOKED BACON & TOMATO SOUP DUMPLINGS: Imagine a dumpling filled with cheese and topped with bacon crumbles sitting in a big spoon full of thick slightly spicy tomato soup. Perfection!! We received 6 dumplings, which is not easily divisible for 4 people though. A+-BRAISED SHORT RIB 'HUEVOS RANCHEROS' (sunny side up eggs, black beans, cotija): 2 inch wide fried wonton cup filled with  delicious braised short rib, cotija, and each topped with a sunny side up egg. This sits atop a delicious red sauce and black bean puree. Amazing! We received 4. A+-RED VELVET WAFFLES (cream cheese icing): Cute tiny mini waffles. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The cream cheese icing is very sweet. I got this in place of dessert. We received 4. B+-FREE RANGE SCRAMBLED EGGS (smoked salmon, boursin cheese, chives): I hate seafood. This was no exception. I hear cooking smoked fish makes it stink. We received 4. I took a tiny bite and it was horrible! For me, the salmon ruined the dish. F--FRIED CHICKEN BISCUIT BITES (tabasco honey butter, red cabbage slaw): This came out after a long wait. I think the kitchen was backed up from the larger parties. We received 4. They're mini sandwiches. The chicken had too much breading and overall bland. Weird sweet butter. Skip! D-RISE N' SHINE cocktail (stoli vanil, cold brew coffee, coconut milk, vanilla, aztec chocolate bitters): Tastes like a spiked Vietnamese iced coffee! Yum!

I get that many people come here because it's ""the place to be"" but the crowd is just such a turnoff. Portions were resized appropriately for our group but this just meant that everyone way overpaid for what are already very expensive apps and entrees. Additionaly, we were here for a surprise bday party and the hostess(es) told us they couldn't seat us until the full party was here. ...I get that, I really do, but from a customer management point of view, and in light of the fact that it was a surprise bday dinner, they could've at least seated us when the majority of the party was there (which we tried to ask for but were ultimately denied). When we finally got them to seat us with a *gasp* two people (the bday boy and his fiancée) still missing, the hostess's exact words were ""Ok but you have to order as soon as you sit down.""...Um.

The whole ""enter through the pawn shop"" thing is a little kitschy because it's clearly not a secret, but the ambience inside is awesome.The first several times I visited, we did the a la carte brunch, where you're seating in the main dining area. The menu is small plates, which can get a little pricey and if you add drinks (cocktails are $17), it's definitely a bit of a splurge, but so good.Recently, I made reservations for 1pm on a Sunday and they accidentally assumed I meant Champagne Brunch. Best mistake ever! I will only attend Champagne Brunch from here on out. Everyone is seated at the same time, upstairs. The room is more intimate than the main dining room and dark. There's music and towards the end they come around and hand out glow sticks. It's tons of fun. But the best part is the food! I assumed the menu was a ""pick one from each category"" sort of affair, but no, you get everything on the menu, plus champagne! I think it cost around $60/person which is less than our normal brunch spend and we got way more food. The only thing that concerned me a little was the table next to us had 3 people and they received the exact same portions as our party of 2, even for items like the grilled cheese soup dumplings (you get 4) which aren't ""shareable."" Since you're paying per person, I would expect the portions to be divided evenly. Mostly, I made a note to myself to only come in even groups.Some menu highlights: Red Velvet Waffles, Kale & Apple Salad, Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings, Fried Chicken Biscuit Bites",0,0,0,Andrea L.,"Manhattan, NY",11,43,16
5.0,1/19/2018,"How have I never reviews this place? This restaurant is probably my boyfriends and mine absolute favourite restaurant. We discovered it during restaurant week and have gone back twice. Once even not during restaurant week. The food is small but delicious. Absolutely delicious. The vibe is dark and intimate. The drinks are delicious and strong. They get booked fast so make your reservations early or you'll be like us, making an early summer evening reservation: enjoying a delicious and intimate dinner.

3.0,1/16/2018,"First Impression- I decided to have my birthday dinner here, an intimate date with my friend and I on a Friday night. Upon arrival, we're greeted by a doorman and passed what seemed to be a line....or just a couple of stragglers. He asked if we had reservations and directed us to the pawn shop once we informed him that we did. Many reviews state how sketchy and unassuming the front of the restaurant is. How unassuming can a big ass storefront sign fitted with neon lights that blare ""Beauty & Essex"" be? I'll never know. We walked through the pawn shop and opened the doors to the most immaculate dining establishment ever. Gorgeous decor and illuminating fixtures cover every inch of the restaurant. If beautiful people are eye candy, B&E is a goddamn candy shop. This restaurant is apart of the Tao Group, so the decor in some ways is reminiscent of Tao and Vandal, with its own unique appeal of course. Dim lights and clubby music seem to be the preferred ambiance for trendy restaurants nowadays. An elaborate chandelier centered inside of a luxe spiraled staircase makes for beautiful photo ops and after dinner, I seized the opportunity. Dining here makes you feel so fucking classy.Service-Here's where stars begin to come off. The hostess led us through the beautiful and pretentious crowd laced in their Sunday's best and seated us in a large booth where we waited for our server. And waited....and waited. It was 20 minutes before our server acknowledged us. I spotted him walking across the dining hall and we locked eyes; this prompted him to approach us. He greets us. His name is Santiago. He asked for our drink order, but being that we'd already waited I gave him our entire order. Despite our wait, we were very friendly. From the beginning, Santiago seemed disconnected and kind of cold. We order the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings, the seafood tower and the Essex burger.  We had two cocktails; the Beauty Elixir and another savory drink I can't recall. I asked him about the lobster Mac and cheese and he recommended it. My friend chimes in and says he would like one as well.  Santiago proceeds to say, ""Two orders? Oh, you must be rich."" Wait,....what? I rolled my eyes so hard I could see the back of my head. I don't walk around with a stick up my ass and I'm not easily offended. His comment just seemed super inappropriate and not made in jest, mostly because he didn't seem welcoming, to begin with. He disappeared the rest of the night checking on our table only once after we received our food. I wanted another cocktail but our phantom server was m.i.a. After our dinner was finished we waited around another 20 mins for the check. My friend reminded him it was my bday (we mentioned this earlier). He came out with a candle and a cake pop. Food-Grilled cheese dumplings were amazing and the best dish we'd had. We immediately wanted another order. Seafood tower was as expected, fresh oysters, little neck clams, etc. Lobster Mac and cheese was average. They drown it in breadcrumbs which detracts from the flavor. Not recommended. Cocktails were delicious and strong.Conclusion-Service was slightly disappointing though the restaurant is everything and more. All in all, I'd definitely come back. It's best to come with friends imo, as the clubby music, upstairs lounge and small plates seem more appropriate. It's paradoxically superficial but with substance,​ because the food is actually great.",10,1,1,Shaquana S.,"Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, NY",7,26,16
4.0,1/16/2018,"Went here for brunch this past Sunday. Called and made reservations the day before, there weren't many availability but we made it work. It was supposed to be 5 but last minute change made it 4, they accommodated the change immediately, they also have a 15 min grace period which is great because parking sucks in the area, ended up parking in the lot, anything over 1hr is $32. Anyway, food is ok, nothing spectacular, the steak and eggs are pretty good and flavorful, they also make adjustments one of my friends asked for steak and scrambled eggs with cheddar, odd request but they did it. The pastrami Mac and cheese was not bad but not good.  It tasted more like bacon than pastrami and I don't like bacon so there you go. The red velvet waffles were served 3 mini waffles but they were yummy and the icing topping was superb. The lemon and avocado toast was perfectly light and flavorful, so much so that we ordered a second round. The fish tacos were good but there were 3 small tacos for $24? It's brunch, so I guess it's expected. There's was a toffee creme brûlée of  sorts which you musttttt try! The drinks are ok, they have a full bar so order whatever, I had the ODB, which had fresh fruit!! the bar tender was making them pretty strong considering it was 3 pm. The service is ok, not great, the staff are nice and friendly but not very attentive, once they walk away from the table they seem to forget you :( had to waive someone down for more drinks several times.",3,0,0,Esmira J.,"HOWARD BEACH, NY",3,99,224
3.0,1/16/2018,"My boyfriend and I came here with a gift certificate.  Making a reservation here for prime-time is a pain in the a$$ -- you can only make reservations on Opentable 30 days out and of course as soon as it opens the reservations are scooped up.  We settled with a 9:45pm reservation on a Friday night.  I was surprised no one called me to confirm the reservation the night before/day of so I called.  While I had them on the phone I asked if there was earlier availability and there was not.  We gave ourselves extra time to get there because of inclement weather and street parking, but ended up arriving early.  We checked in and expected to get a drink, but at 9:25pm they were magically able to seat us. Also surprisingly, no one asked to check our coats so the waitress kindly did it for us after we were seated.  We weren't feeling the love for a bit as we saw employees whizzing around without anyone stopping to offer us water or taking our drink order.  I digress, let's get to the food.  We started off with the grilled cheese dumplings which were easily the highlight of the meal, like wow, we should have ordered two of them!  The tuna tacos were also very good, but the wonton shells were heavily fried and had an oily flavor to them.  The lobster mac n cheese was pretty good, but I'm a purist and the breaded topping was a buzzkill.  The bulgogi tacos were also good, same comment about the wonton shells. The crab rangoon was nothing to write home about and I wouldn't recommend it.  The fried shrimp came heavily recommended from the waitress but we didn't think it was anything special, I also wouldn't recommend it.  The ambiance is dimly lit, fun, trendy, with current music playing and plenty of interesting patrons to people watch. It's kind of like if a club and a restaurant had a love child. If someone is visiting town or you're planning a fun night out with a group of people this would be a fun place to come.",1,1,2,Stacey T.,"New York, NY",158,146,156

You must dress up when you come here ! You will definitely be singled out if you don't! My girls and i got a few cocktails  and the delicious dessert shots ! Our waitress was super friendly and nice ! Girls- BTW! You'll love it when you enter the bathroom. Honestly you can just hangout in the bathroom . They had champagne for us in the restrooms, and all the girl amenities that you'd need: body mist, deodorant, hairspray, dry shampoo, baby powder, face wipes, and cream/ body lotion.

Saw some unsavory items on the sidewalk outside which I will keep to myself due to sheer modesty, gross. Walked through the front of a tacky jewelry store and saw the flashy interior through the ""secret door"" with a large staircase and thought ok maybe this could be cool.  Inside is dark and very, very crowded on a Saturday night. Despite having a reservation we waited and waited but had fun with some ""creative"" cocktails. My quotations are to imply an eye roll that you can't see while reading. The drinks were $17 each and garnished with thyme and shrubs and tasted like cough medicine. Come on with the foliage that belongs on a turkey!  You know when a place just tries too hard to be trendy and cool yet it's crawling with tacky tourists?  Welcome to Beauty and Essex. The people watching here is the best part of this place. Expect to see everything from an out of towner carrying a fannypack, to a very awkward first date to women that look they have plans working at a gentleman's club later in the evening. I was there with a few friends so we ordered pretty much all of the shared plates. The grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings were delish but all of these plates are tiny. Don't expect to get full after spending good money for dinner.  People leaving this place after dinner can expect to get wasted due to lack of nourishment!

Perfect place to come on a date or for a night out with friends.As for the food, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I decided to go with the Crispy Eggplant Pizzetta for appetizer. It was good, tasted like your typical flatbread. Now for my entree, I got the Beauty & Essex Burger which was amazing! The combination of: lamb, short rib, and brisket made it taste very unique.

4.0,1/9/2018,"I came here with high expectations based on recommendations and prior reviews. With that being said, my expectations were almost all met, which is saying a lot. Warning- prices are high! Ambiance:The highlight of the visit here was the ambiance. I was in search for a hip, trendy spot with great food and this place fit the bill perfectly. You enter into a pawn shop and the door opens into the restaurant, a large dimly lit elaborate space with an upstairs and downstairs. We were told there would be live music but it was nowhere to be heard, but the upscale, trendy vibe of this place made up for it. Service: We had reservations and were given a beeper to wait by the bar, no big deal. We only waited 5 minutes and didn't get to order drinks, which is a plus because we shouldn't have to wait long with reservations. We were taken to a table in the main dining room, and our server was ok. She seemed to be in a bad mood or just didn't like us because she was super chatty with the tables next to us. On the brighter side, the way the staff helps each other is impressive. A new person was bringing dishes/drinks out and refilling our water each time, and was super polite. Food:I was really impressed with the food. We just got apps and tried a few items. I would save room for dessert. I tried the tomato soup dumplings (5/5 must order), shishito peppers (4.5/5) and the tuna tartare (4.5/5)For dessert we shared the butterscotch pot de creme (4/5) which was nice but not my favorite- my favorite item from the entire night was the White Russian dessert milkshake! (5/5) Definitely order that- it's very sweet and indulgent.Drink:Beauty Elixr is a great drink although it is not very strong. I could barely taste the alcohol but I guess that's the whole point. On the other hand, the fat Frenchman and ODB are very potent. Proceed with caution lol Overall:I would return again mainly for the ambiance and to try a few new dishes.

4.0,1/8/2018,"1/5/2018 - 8:00 pm reservation. What started off as a not so great evening, quickly turned around. I had called a few days in advance to make a reservation for Friday and had specifically requested a more intimate table (booth) as my boyfriend and I were celebrating our 5 year anniversary & did not want to be crammed in a tight space in other people's conversations. We're not local to this area but we quickly discovered that the spacing in New York is very tight. Upon our arrival, we were told if we waited longer we could be seated at a booth. We waited about 25 minutes and was finally seated to a TIGHT spaced table. I was very clearly upset but our server, Eva (Yvette) was SO unbelievably kind and attentive. The service we received from her was unbelievable and had completely turned the night around. 5 Stars for the following: 1. Service was outstanding. Eva, you were amazing and I can't thank you enough. I hope this restaurant recognizes employees like you. 2. Food was great! Kind of small plate but everything had great flavor. If you have a sweet tooth, I highly recommend the donuts! 3. Despite the tight space, the environment is cool. Dim lighting and lounge vibes.*1 star lost for the host who was SO rude.

The drinks are a big rip off, we 1400 on food another 1400 on drinks, when you spend 1400 on drinks you are expecting somebody to be drunk, everybody was sober, you know why? Cause the drinks are all watered down.  You ask for vodka with a splash of sprite and instead it's reversed and they are charging you $19 dollars for it.  When we confronted the waiter it was like he knew it happens, they refunded 1 drink when asked for 5.  There is no reason when we are paying $2800 we need to lie about drinks feeling watered down.Just really torn cause the food is out of this world good, the service and the way they are running it no where matches the food.  If your classy you understand we aren't arguing about $100 dollars when we are already shelling out $3k.

They give you 3 small little tacos but they tasted so fresh and delicious. I should have savored it more, thinking back about it now. Surf N' Turf ($35)-3/5 This dish had 2 pieces of scallops and 2 pieces of pork belly. The scallops were so salty I felt like they came right out the sea. And according to my sister/cousin the pork belly wasn't anything special. The best thing about this dish is that the purée was very delicious. P.S. the peppers on the ""salad"" was very spicy... that my cousin needed a glass of milk. Spaghettini ($22)- 3/5 This was way too lemony to the point that it hurt our tongues. The lemon flavor took away the parley pesto flavor (the main flavor). Octopus cassoulet ($16)- 3.5/5 Portion was super tiny compared to the Yelp pictures.

After walking into the pawn shop and drooling over the Gibson 335 and several Les Pauls, we entered the restaurant through ""the door"" in the pawn shop.  It is the most unique entrance second to one in Atlanta where you walk through a bakery to get to the restaurant.Our reservations were at 8:30 and we did not get seated until 9:30!  Now I was pretty fuming at this point as we were told another group paid but was not leaving the table. It happens but I was surprised nothing was being done to accommodate us for the wait.  Well they definitely took care of us after we were seated.  Complimentary sparkling for the table (4 of us) was a nice way to accomodate.However after we ordered, they added several items on the house and integrated them in with our dishes. Now that is what I call EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE.The wait staff were great and now for the big review!All items were tapas, one piece per person. There are main dishes but why anyone would want one big dish and not explore all the flavors of the chef's creations is beyond me.We had:ThaiShrimp- an amazing very lightly breaded large prawns which were full of sweetness and heat from the red peppers and some sort of sliced root that accompanied the dish.  Shrimp very fresh with a nice snap to them, Definitely a must dish.Avacado Toast- ok the new frozen yogurt rage of the 90s is now Avacado toast rage of 2017. Although it's really a chinky guacamole that was very tasty there was nothing really creative about mashed avocado on toast but it was tasty. Salmon Tar Tare Toast- amazing combination of flavors on this dish and nice presentation, I always love a great tar tare of anything and this did not disappoint.Mini Tuna Taco- was a great mini taco stuffed with ahi tuna and a wasabi cream. Excellent and a must get.Crab Rangoon- a real classic served on an asian style rice puff crackerCeaaer Toast- a unique twist on individual toasts. The salad was great, dressed perfectly.Empanada- very good. a mini serving in a nice crisp and light pouch of fried dough.Bulgogi tacos,- one of my favorites with great moist, juicy sweet bulgogi meat server in the same taco as the mini tuna tacos. Excellent!Tomato Soup Dumpling- a great spin served in a wonton soup spoon filled with tomato soup and a nice quarter size dumpling floating on top. This was a fun dish and I loved the presentation.Lobster Mac and Cheese- omg so good with massive size pieces of lobster and cheese throughout with large pieces of pasta.Shishito peppers. Done in a very unique sweet and spicy sauce that really gave extraordinary flavor to what is usually a fairly bland pepper with a surprise hot one at random that makes eating them a fun time.All in all this is one of THE places to go in NYC and I will come back here for sure on my next visit next year.5 stars and then some!Tip: The music is loud, the crowd is loud, so drink well and often so you don't care.",11,2,3,Jay G.,"Castro Valley, CA",133,360,2432

Also  I was a little late for my reservation and the staff was nice about it and the dancing crowd was friendly. Im always weary when traveling with big groups of my friends and I (majority of poc) to upscale places but we were treated with respect and like everyone else so I will be back!

5.0,12/11/2017,"Been here a few times and I'm always blown away by the decor, the details.  I can't stand how crowded it is though. I would never come here without a reservation or casually for a drink.  That's a shame because it's probably one of the best cocktail menus i've seen at any restaurant, but that crowd just can't be avoided, even with the two bars they have.Went for a birthday dinner not too long ago with 20 people.  One long table so either you're playing musical chairs all night or you're talking to the people in your immediate vicinity.  They did have better, rounder tables but it was a busy saturday night.My brother set up a fixed menu with a million courses on it.  Unfortunately i recently went vegan and when i told the waiter, he just looked at me and said he wish they knew sooner, but they got me.  And boy did they.  One of the most impressive displays of culinary finesse to not only cater to my vegan needs, but to have it be delicious and comparable to what the rest of the party was having.  For example, they brought out seared scallops on a salad, and i got a sear piece of tofu about the same size.  And they did that for everything.  Instead of duck chilaquiles, i got something that didn't make me miss duck or cheese (and i love both).  The rest of the dishes everyone had included some sashimi everyone raved about, from fish mongers to the ""i don't like the smell of fish-""types, everyone loved it.  The pizza was really good (even my version), short ribs on mashed potatoes, scallops, toast with a bunch of delicious toppings, a really lovely pasta dish, and like 8 other things.  I was a few drinks in so you'll have to forgive me.  OH, all the drinks are amazing EXCEPT the one with activated charcoal.  It tastes exactly how it sounds, like an ashtray.  The only thing I've ever had there that made my heart sad lol.And yeah it was crazy expensive but you get great food, service, and a memorable experience.",7,1,3,Hasan M.,"Williston Park, NY",84,59,177

Other than this slip up, we were really pleased with the overall experience. Our favorites were the grilled cheese & tomato soup, and the ahi tacos.  I certainly recommend this place for a fun dinner with a good vibe.

The food is GREAT.  It was probably the best avocado toast I've had in my life.  The grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings are to die for.  I could have eaten 45.  I was there with 6 girls and we shared 5 entrees which only came to $16 per person (excluding a bottle of champagne paid for separately) which is very reasonable for the level of service and quality of food.  I will say you probably don't want to come here if you're starving because the tapas style of food makes for very small portions.  The upstairs floor on Sundays has a prefixe menu for around $65 and is much more a scene with glowsticks, dancers and a DJ. There is also a bar area where you can hang out and get a drink.  Definitely more of a party brunch upstairs but I definitely recommend it here if you're looking for something a little different than your typical brunch!",0,0,0,Sarah E.,"Manhattan, NY",267,32,27

5.0,12/8/2017,"I was making last minute arrangements couple weeks ago to celebrate an engagement with some friends. The reason that it was last minute is because the guest of honor commented that the other place was too far (*insert eye roll*). I was nervous that I could not find a nice replacement so last minute, but I took my chances and they had a last minute reservation at 5:15 on a Friday, so we jumped on it.When you first walk in, you will see a gift shop, and the restaurant is behind that. They were quick to seat us, and had a complementary coat check. The restaurant is really pretty and grand, and the ladies restrooms were very clean and had a royal feel (bathroom attendant, supplies and all). Beauty and Essex has the perfect date-night feel.We were a group of three and we ordered the following to share:-Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos -Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings-Chocolate Peanut Butter Whoopie -""Les, NYC"" Doughnuts-Beauty & Essex Burger w/ crispy bbq fries-Braised Short Ribs-Beauty Elixir (gin, cucumber, strawberry, sparkling rosé) for me.The appetizers and the entrees were solid choices, but nothing stood out more than the desserts and the beauty elixir drink. They were my favorite parts of the entire experience! the drink is fruity, but not overwhelmingly sweet and is mixed very well. The desserts were both a very solid choice (but I would suggest sharing between two people vs. three if you have a true sweet tooth). This was overall a wonderful experience, and cost us about $150.

3.0,12/1/2017,"Went here earlier this year with friends. As many others mentioned, it's like a speakeasy restaurant. An assuming in the front, looks like a pawn shop. Honestly, we were a little confused looking for it when friends asked to meet there. What's most memorable to me is the place itself. Go beyond the back door in the pawn shop and be awed by the beautiful restaurant behind with a swanky bar and lounge. To be seated, we climbed the lovely grand staircase to a cozy corner table and shared lots of dishes among the four of us. What is most memorable to me is in the women's bathroom, which is fairly large, is a bar that serves champagne. Kind of funny because remember going into the stall the use the the bathroom, and could hear some girls say ""cheers!"" and clinking glasses. Then as I washed my hands I craned my neck around the mirror to see the bar. Weird or cool? You decide. But definitely different!Food was good.

Food was mediocre (except for the spaghettini and tuna appetizers which were delicious).

The food is partially good but only 3/5 dishes we ordered were good. The octopus cassoulet was undercooked and tasted just like the tomato soup dumplings we ordered which were bland. The bone marrow was $18 and contained 2 BITES of it and the rest was bread (thank god for the bread to fill us up). The tuna tacos were good but tiny. Picture a taco made for a Barbie.  My dad's gin and tonic was half full when the waitress just grabbed it and removed it from the table without asking if he was done. That was a $15 Gin and tonic. Needless to say we will not be going back. $200 for a small meal and just average service. Also when it hit 8pm the music got loud we couldn't hear one another. We were forced to check our coats when we got in. And the lady's room is ridiculously tacky with a champagne bar and someone following you around to put soap in your hand and give you a free paper towel for a tip. Honestly if you want a cool experience please go to Ippudo. Also having to go through a pawn shop is also so tacky.

Of course I am disputing it with my credit card and am sure they will refund me but this whole thing just really rubbed me the wrong way. How can they be so busy as to not take care of a double charge?!  Accidental or not?!  If you are running a business- you need to have someone available to handle things like that and teach your staff to not tell customers to ""keep calling"".  That's definitely one place I'll never call again.",0,0,0,Rita L.,"Phoenix, AZ",10,47,0

5.0,11/8/2017,"Came here for Sunday ""champagne brunch"". Went on a limb and booked a table from 1-6 (which required each person to commit to spending a minimum of $110 *$55 of which was the brunch which included 2 glasses of fair quality champagne and the rest, I was told could be put towards bar or bottle service*). Food was excellent and our waiter was phenomenal, he was super attentive and very sweet. Once 4pm rolled around we wanted to be more in the lounge/dance floor area and the server as well as the manager was extremely accommodating. My only issue was that when the bill came around they tried to charge both my friend and I $110 each on top of the two bottles and couple of glasses of champagne we bought. It took showing 3 people my email from when I booked the reservation to convince them that I was word for word told that I just needed to exceed $110 per person and that it was not going to be $110 per person + extra bottles I purchased. All that matters is that in the end they fixed it. It was overall a great experience just be sure to double check your bill(we were almost over charged $110 all together). Also if you want the more lively part of brunch book the 3-6 spot, it didn't get too upbeat until around 3. I was also slightly disappointed in the other patrons attire, they send an email suggesting upscale attire but don't really enforce dress code. It kind of dampers the experience when you took the time to get ready and dress up and half the other people are wearing jeans and over sized sweaters.",0,0,0,Julia K.,"Boca Raton, FL",202,24,7

Don't remember having a bad experience with the food first time around but that was a few years ago. This time, I didn't like it. We ordered the Salmon tartare, Avocado toast and the Scallops. I guess the Avocado toast was the best of the three. Scallops were ok, I've had better. But the Salmon tartare was dripped in (chipotle?) mayo. It tasted like badly made sushi.

2.0,11/7/2017,"This place is more of a ""scene"" than a dining experience.  It was extremely loud and hard to have a conversation with our friends across the table.  Our waitress was super sweet and mindful of my husband's dairy allergy (which was nice).  When the food arrived everything was barely warm, definitely not hot.  It tasted like it was prepared an hour ago and left under a heat lamp.  The Shishito peppers were all cooked unevenly and they poured a bunch of citrus juice over it to make it interesting - kind of a fail when it comes to shishito peppers.  I was hoping it was going to be much better than it was.  It was all heavy and pretty average in my opinion.  The worst part was the bill was almost $400 and only 3 of the 4 of us ordered one cocktail.  We left hungry and dissatisfied.  I understand tapas adds up but this was stupid.  We also had a reservation for 8:30 and still waited to be seated until 9:10.  I am surprised by all of the good reviews.  Perhaps we had an off night for this establishment.",0,0,0,Athena B.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,32,14

4.0,11/1/2017,This pat Monday was my birthday and it was so easy to book reservations last minute at Beauty & Essex! From the entrance to the decor everything was just perfect. My guest arrived a little earlier than I did and they were taken care of and made comfortable until I arrived. Seating was perfect and our waitress Sheila was absolutely AMAZING!  The food was superb and the drinks were at the same level. I absolutely loved this restaurant (and it was my very first time going) I am a designer and influencer so of course I needed to take photos with my photographer this wards the end of the night and the managers had no problem with me doing that. It was amazing. The reason I didn't give Beauty & Essex FIVE STARS is because there was one man who was VERY VERY rude to us. As soon as we were about to leave we were taking some last photos and I guess he had a problem with that so he kept pacing back in forth in front of us making us extremely uncomfortable. After about him doing that for a while he went and got the doorman to ask us to leave instead of him doing that himself. I asked him why didn't he just politely ask us himself and he gestured a shrug at me then rolled his eyes and continued to walk away. What was a surprise to me was that there were other guest taking photos as well but he didn't say anything to them. It wasn't the best way for me to end the night on my birthday and I would love to attend this restaurant as long as this male wouldn't be in site.,1,0,1,Stephon M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,2
3.0,10/30/2017,"Seems like a good place for a lively and special occasion brunch, but is definitely overrated in my opinion. Some of the tapas were great, but others were a miss.

The biggest disappointments were the grilled cheese tomato soup dumplings which came out completely cold... Totally unacceptable for soup to ever be served cold.

5.0,10/29/2017,"Went to Beauty & Essex last night for a one-day stop in NYC and was far beyond impressed. Upon entering what looks like a pawn shop, you are led to a back door which leads you to the beautiful hybrid restaurant/bar/club that is Beauty & Essex. I came in at around 10pm to have a late dinner which was great timing. There were lots of people, loud music, food, drinks, everything! The beautifully decorated and well-organized area gave an extremely positive and fun New York City vibe which I had never experienced before. I had a reservation so I was seated fairly quickly despite the amount of people. MAKE A RESERVATION!! I was led to my table up a large spiral staircase beneath a beautiful chandelier. We passed a dance floor and super cool bar with lights and a DJ booth (which, btw was playing the absolute best possible music the entire time). We sat down and ordered the drinks we had already selected- Emerald Gimlet and The Woodsman. Both drinks were brought out momentarily and were phenomenal. The Emerald Gimlet is a fresh vodka-based cocktail with cucumber/lime flavors and a perfect hint of basil. The Woodsman (served with Woodford Reserve) was described as a lighter, more refreshing version of an Old Fashioned. We paired these drinks with a couple of small plates and entrees.The first thing we said when we sat down is that we will need to be patient because it's busy and our food will definitely take a while. This was not the case at all! The first appetizer that came out was the Hand Cut Steak Tartare with Swedish pickled beets, anchovy crème fraiche on top of a mustard dill rice cake. We also ordered a side of the octopus cassoulet which was very unique but also had amazing strong flavors of tomato broth & chorizo. For entrees, we shared Brick Pressed Lemon Chicken and Braised Short Ribs . The Brick Pressed Lemon Chicken was served with hen of the woods mushrooms, kale, and a delicious chicken jus sauce which brought all of the flavors together. The Braised Short Ribs were amazing. Cooked perfectly and were so tender you didn't even need to use a knife to cut them! Served with creamed Brussels sprouts and pearl onion gastrique all on top of a bed of smoked yukon potatoes. The presentation of medium-sized short rib chunks on top of the potatoes really allowed for you to get all of these flavors in every single bite! This was definitely a favorite! We were so genuinely impressed by this meal. I could not have asked for anything more!Going to Beauty & Essex basically make my one day in NYC absolutely perfect. There's something to be said about the fact that I had been running around all day, missed a few big landmarks I wanted to go to, was tired and disappointed but then I went to this loud, crazy, crowded spot and my mood was just completely turned around! I already can't wait til the next time I go to NYC to I can come back to Beauty & Essex and try the rest of their craft cocktails, phenomenal plates, and dance around the lights and upbeat music!",4,1,2,Danielle P.,"Orlando, FL",932,141,1500

Service was so friendly and knowledgeable. Our waitress offered great recommendations.We got a bottle of sparkling rosè which paired well with everything. We started with complimentary pumpkin soup, then tomato tartare with quail egg. This quail egg was so savory and warmed perfectly. Eggplant pizzette and chicken meatballs were ok. The best was the bone marrow. Savory, salty sweety. I could eat like 50.I don't really go nuts over desserts. Usually only one or two bites and just sip Sambuca. That was until I tried the Peanut Butter Whoppie Pie. Woahhh! It's genius. The Marshmellow with salty crunchy peanut brittle was amazing. I dream about it every night.This restaurant is pricy!

The upper level is a lounge where you can sit on the couch and have dinner/drinks or sit at the bar area. They also have a DJ. I'm not sure if the DJ is there every night but all the times that I've been there's been one. Again, I love this place!

I run my own business and try to entertain my (prospective) clients over dinner and drinks in the hope to maintain my accounts and bring in new ones. Last Saturday October 21st my business partner and I took one of our newest clients for a night in the town (drinks and dinner at one of the hottest spots in the city). I made a reservation in advance for the three of us. We still had to wait (which is expected for a Saturday night and therefore not an issue). While we were waiting we had some drinks at the bar upstairs. However, the wait had become too long so my business partner went to check on the status of the wait. So the issue as we found out was a faulty ringer. So they gave us another one, put us back on the queue and they compensated us with a round of drinks. Since we had already ordered I asked the bartender Joey (I didn't go to the bartender that was helping us because her rudeness was too much to bear) to get us the check discounting those drinks and he told me ""you do not tell me what to do"". Up to that point I had been trying to put us patiently with the situation but it was about time to escalate the issue.The manager Ken Yoon saved the entire situation and made sure that we had a great night.

The bathroom is fully decked out with any and all little necessities you may need that you didn't bring. Like a glass of champagne :) because nothing makes a trip to the ladies room more fun then a big luscious red couch some bubbly and a few good movements of experiencing  something old school and slightly over the top.... indulge for once. Tip the ladies a few in good spirit. The service was amazing as well. Our waiter was Santiago. He was very professional and always around when we needed him. For starters we ordered the shrimp cocktail, fried oysters and bone marrow and we got a taste of the pumpkin butternut squash soup.  Shrimp was basic. Nothing special. Bone marrow, was my first time time trying such a dish and it was amazing. The bread was perfectly crisp and the onion jam was delicous and sweet with some salt on top I was in heaven. The fried oysters were good but not worth the price. For entrees we got the salmon and pearl cous cous, 24 oz ribeye medium rare with a side of the Yukon gold potato puree, BX Burger and a pesto dish with an egg. Everyone enjoyed there dishes.

Anyway everything else was amazing. The ambience and decor here is really so beautiful it really is a cool experience. It really gives off a cool speakeasy vibe and we loved it. We both had the beauty elixir cocktail which was delicious and generously poured I got up to use the bathroom and I definitely felt tipsy after one. We split the wontons in the tomato soup which was a flavor explosion in your mouth so good. I had the tuna which was served rare and was the best I've ever had.

They sell lots of vintage items, such as jewlery, records etc. The decor in the restaurant is also very nice, it has a great romance feel. It's an excellent spot for date night!We heard the tapa portions were small, which was confirmed by the plates customers ordered next to us. When our waiter arrived he recommended that we order 6 plates for the 3 of us. Each plate is around $30 dollars, so it would have been around $60 each to eat like birds and leave hungry. No thank you!We all decided to get a more substantial meal and we all ordered burgers and ordered 2 sides. Going this route saves us about $15 and we were stuffed!The burger was really good and well seasoned. The bbq fries had way too much seasoning and as a result too salty. I LOVE fries and couldn't finish them in fear of my sodium intake!To add veggies to our meal we got the kale apple salad, which was also pretty tasty. I normally don't like raw kale, but with the dressing, apples and walnuts the salad was delicious! The salad also was a sizable  portion.Last minute we decided to get the lobster Mac and cheese. Which was yummy! There was a good spicy kick to it (avoid if you don't like spicy). Unfortunately, there wasn't much lobster :/ and the dish was pretty small. The 3 of us could only have a scoop before it was finished. Sadly no seconds with this dish :(Overall, this is a nice spot for drinks and tapas (as appetizers).

You kind of walk through what looks like a pawn shop to get into the restaurant, so don't be alarmed. Once you get inside you will be awe-struck by the beautiful interior. The grand dining room is beautiful and buzzing with activity. The food - excellent. The shrimp appetizer is a must! I really enjoyed my BBQ ribs but I would order something different next time as it was heavily charred (and a wee bit dried out) and a heavy meal. My table mates all loved their dishes as well. The food here is top-notch. You can tell from taste to presentation - they care about your culinary experience.Bring a date or a group of friends.

2.0,9/29/2017,"Really wanted to like this place. My friend and I were looking for a fun place to grab a higher end dinner than we normally eat. I'm in town for just the week. Unfortunately this place seems more like a club than a restaurant. The restaurant is super cool looking. But the music is downright awful. I don't know who chose the playlist but if I'm going to pay a hundred bucks or more for a meal I don't want to be listening to bad pop music and radio nonsense. Also the music was absurdly loud. If you want to be a club, be a club, but you're a restaurant so people need to be able to have a conversation without yelling over music. We had a 9:15 reservation but were still given a buzzer and asked to wait with no acknowledgement of how strange that is. If you have a reservation why should you have to wait? Anyways after 5-10 min we were seated. As for the food... the sweet potato ravioli and the chicken meatballs were definite standouts. Although nothing about them really wowed me. The grilled cheese dumplings were good but nothing special. The roast beef ""carpaccio"" was unimpressive, I thought it would actually be carpaccio but it was just roast beef and seemed too low end even with the way it was plated. We were still hungry after though dishes so we ordered the lobster mac and cheese. It was highly disappointing. We searched for lobster and there were no joke 2 pieces in this $18 plate of mac and cheese. Pretty ridiculous. I will say our server was lovely and helpful. And all the other staff (aside from the hostesses) were friendly and helpful. Then to top off our OK experience, I got food poisoning from something at the restaurant (I noticed the chicken meatballs were still a little pink on the inside but thought it was just the lighting). Woke up in the middle of the night sick to my stomach and that was the only meal I'd had within 12 hours. Super disappointed in this place.",0,0,0,Moranda B.,"New York, NY",27,193,86

Lobster Mac & Cheese topped all our lists!  The Grilled Cheese Tomato soup dumplings were a very close second!

5.0,9/18/2017,"I've come to Beauty & Essex before for a Christmas Party one time with my Bar Lounge Family, and I never gave a review -- must've forgot. This ""speak easy"" restaurant always can set the tone for a good night to shop, and eat. When you first walk in it is a jewelry shop, but as you go further into the place you'll see it's more than just that! Loveeee this place! Starting off with my girlfriends and I we went to pamper ourselves and in the ladies room there is someone always offering complimentary champagne. First off! I love anything complimentary especially in a bathroom lol.. when you walk upstairs you are greeted of course by a host and seating CAN be difficult depending on the time you go, because it's always busy. It has two floors with a range of great music as well. Since it was around 10 PM on a Thursday we picked the right time to get served. Our waitress was great (can't remember her name) but she had no problem suggesting signature drinks for my liking. I'm a whiskey girl so anything with that I'm sold! So, I ordered ""The Woodsman"" very delicious and I love the arrangement of the pears. Loved it! The drinks were definitely made to perfection! I would say two of those and you should be good for the night (maybe) lol.. I also was craving a burger, and I haven't had a good burger in a while. I had the Beauty & Essex burger cooked Medium Rare of course (winks*) and it was absolutely delectable. This place is great for an intimate dinner with your date, or significant other or a night out with friends. I recommend this place anytime to anyone!

They serve their own special champagne in the ladies room. Definitely completes the whole ambience and decor! Cute place for a girls night out. Try to get reservations! They didn't have any open reservations, but you can sit at the lounge/bar and order the full menu. The service is a bit slow but it did get super crowded. The whole lounge was packed, it felt like a club. For food, We got the Bone Marrow, the Grilled cheese and Tomato Soup Dumplings, the Scallops, Mini Donuts, and the Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese. The bone marrow was fatty and big. It spread well on the crispy toast. Definitely my favorite. The Grilled cheese and Tomato Soup Dumplings seemed really cool but it was just okay. It was good at first but then just fell flat after one. The lobster mac 'n' cheese was good, but nothing amazing. The scallops were pretty good!

I definitely suggest the dumplings and, depending on your mood, the chicken meatballs and roasted carrots.

3.0,9/6/2017,"After having this place bookmarked for ages, my friends and I finally  made it in for restaurant week on a Friday night. Once we were seated, we looked over the menus a bit. We each had a drink and then ordered the tomato soup/cheese dumplings to start. Then for RW, I had the empanadas, salmon, and petite cupcakes. My friends ordered the eggplant pizza, spegattini/pork belly, and peanut butter mouse/panna cotta. The portion sizes were ample, especially the entrees! For RW, it's a nice surprise to get so much bang for your buck. Everything was good overall. Not the best I've ever had, but certainly good. The ambience is very bustling. It's a speakeasy restaurant, where you have to enter in through the back of a pawn shop. Once you're inside, it's extravagantly decorated with chandeliers, dim lighting, and velvet booths. It's pretty loud and is a mix of diners and people who just want to drink at the bar. It was a fun atmosphere, but not for a calm night if that's what you're looking for. Service was decent, our waitress was nice, but she seemed more concerned with the whiny, rude couple next to us. The main reason for the lower rating, is the hostess/check-in process. We had a 7pm reservation. We arrived right on time and were told that our table wasn't ready. We had a buzzer and just sat around near the stand waiting. After about 30 mins with no acknowledgement from the ladies up front, I walked up to check in on our reservation. They said i needed to wait a moment...considering I hadn't even said anything yet, it was a pretty rude way to acknowledge my presence. Before she asked what i needed, our buzzer magically went off...no apology or ""thank you for waiting/you're patience."" I understand it gets busy, but it's in poor taste to make someone with a reservation wait over 30 mins and then not even graciously acknowledge the amount of time they waited.

We started off with the tuna tacos which comes with three small tacos. The tuna was very fresh, and the vegetables and spices were greatly paired. The second plate we got was the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings. This came prepared on six serving spoons, and it was delicious! The last dish we got was the empanadas. I believe there were four on the plate. This was also very good. Our favorite was the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings. These three plates were definitely enough to fill up two girls. We also each got a dirty martinis which were amazing! After our meal we went upstairs to the bar and had one more drink. The upstairs atmosphere is very trendy and fun.

The baby back ribs were so salty that it was killing our appetite as we could barely get through 2/5 pieces of the ribs. At first i thought it was just me until the people on other table were complaining about it as well. It was kind of disappointing because I was looking forward to the ribs and i was expecting it to taste good. The baked chicken on the otherhand exceeded my expectations in both taste and texture. I was surprised by how good it tasted as i had a fairly low expectation for it . Last but not least, salmon was a disappointment as it was overcooked. One of the worst i ve eaten. We wanted medium rare but it came as medium-well. Meat was dry and unevenly cooked . In conclusion they dropped the ball on both ribs and the salmon dishes.

But my favorite was the eggplant pizzetta - the crust is thin and crispy, and pizzetta sauce and cheese were flavorful yet light. In addition to the restaurant week appetizers, we also got their signature bacon and grilled cheese tomato soup dumplings. It was delicious! My only regret was not ordering more than one for each of us.For entrees, we had the heritage baby back ribs and spaghettini. The ribs were delicious, but a little too tangy for my personal taste. It also comes with hush puppies and dip and they were the bomb! I could just eat them for a whole meal. The spaghettini was delicious as well. I've had some pretty mediocre zucchini pasta before which were soggy and watery, but Beauty & Essex does a pretty good job of it. Definitely order this if you're into zucchini pasta. For dessert, we ordered the creme brulee and mini cupcakes. I was glad the dessert didn't come out immediately after our entrees. We were already so full so it gave us some time to rest. The creme brulee was pretty decent except some of ours were too runny. They also gave me a free cupcake for my birthday. It was alright, not the best I've had. I was also confused why they had cupcakes at such an upscale restaurant as part of their restaurant menu.Overall, the restaurant week menu was definitely a bargain for Beauty & Essex. We had a great time, and I would definitely consider coming back for their regular menu.",3,0,1,Jacqueline C.,"New York, NY",421,209,372

We got seated immediately, got drinks and food rather quickly - considering it was a Saturday night we thought dinner would take forever but we got to enjoy everything. Towards the end as they were getting backed up with people waiting to be seated and we were done with our good, the hostess asked if would mind moving to the bar which we didn't mind as it ended up getting us a bottle of champagne on the house!

5.0,8/5/2017,"I think this place is somewhere fun to at least check out once. As you can see from other peoples pictures, you walk into a pawnshop and then a door opens in the back to enter into a posh restaurant. It's a little gimmicky, but an awesome place to take your out-of-town friends and for anybody living in New York you really should visit this place at least once. I see a lot of people have written bad reviews about the food, however, everything I have ever ordered has been great. The ahi tuna poke tacos and empanadas are delicious for appetizers.

4.0,8/4/2017,"Beauty & Essex is a 3.5 stars. Led by Chris Santos, guest star of Chopped, the restaurant is a well-known trendy establishment in the Lower East Side, NYC with additional locations in Vegas and LA. The exterior to the restaurant is a little interesting. It is not what you expect and has only the sign of the restaurant displayed. The first thing you see when you walk in is a pawn shop, with no signs that there may any evidence of a restaurant. Take a closer look and there is a door behind the cashier that will lead you to the actual restaurant. Immediate thoughts was this must definitely be a place where all the socialites and A-listers hang out. It has a bougie-type vibe to it with the dimly lit setting and the young, well-dressed professionals occupying the space. There are two levels to this restaurant with our waitress taking us to the upper level. He was friendly, responsive, and made sure that our first experience went well. I took some recommendations by Yelp and these were some that we orderedOrdered: Appetizers- Chile Salted Shishito Peppers (4/5). Decent appetizer. The peppers are crunchy and a refreshing with a small hint of heat to it - Tomato Soup Dumplings (5/5). Delicious and one of my favorite dishes out of all we ordered. Each spoon had a small dumpling on it and the key is to eat it with one bite. This appetizer reminds me of the 'Din Tai Fung' experience when ordering perfect dumplings - Crispy Fish Tacos (5/5). Excellent. The diakon and carrots complemented with the sea bass. A must tryMains- Chicken meatballs (3.5/5). You will know it is gourmet meatballs but there is something with it... I've had better versions (e.g. Julianna's in Brooklyn)- Pan seared scallops (5/5). Great. Always a fan of scallops and this was beautiful with the homemade harissa paste - Lobster Mac & Cheese (2.5/5). Firstly, I am not a big fan of cheese so my review is a bit skewed. That said, this dish was not that good as it felt dry and the lobster didn't very come out of the dish - ""Fries"" (1/5). Cannot remember the name of the dish on the top of my head but it was like a poutine of fries and meat. It was not so good. Very cold, old tasting, and overall a disappointmentDesserts - Box of Doughnuts (5/5). Delicious and I don't like desserts. The raspberry jam donut holes are a must try. It instantly melts in your mouth and you will be doing the famous 'Mark Weins' facial expressionOverall, B&E is a decent restaurant but I would go here for the appetizer / drinks to celebrate or have a happy hour",0,0,0,Kenny N.,"Minneapolis, MN",284,188,270
4.0,8/4/2017,"Loved it!  The environment is so cool and they have a good amount of seating though I would highly recommend making a reservation because it was totally packed on a Thursday.  It's on the noisier side and I saw a baby in there but please don't be the parents that bring your kids here, this is not a children's restaurant.  They also have a great bar upstairs with some lounge seating.  The waitress was SO NICE and the manager even allowed us to substitute a different dessert on the fixe menu.  The food honestly took a long time to come out which is why I can't go 5 stars and it's a bit on the pricey side with dinner for two people probably falling in the neighborhood of $100-150, tip and tax included (also, we don't drink alcohol so budget accordingly because that will quickly drive up the total although the cocktail list looked really great so it's probably worth it).  I'd highly recommend this place for a special night out with friends or an energetic evening with your significant other.",0,0,0,Michael B.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",88,93,1

3.0,8/3/2017,"It's bougie for one thing. Came for restaurant week and was seated fairly quickly. The waiter took a while to take our order because he was busy dealing with 3 other tables around us (which is completely fine) but he checked up on other tables more often than ours. Onto the food. We basically ordered everything on the restaurant week menu and also that grilled cheese dumpling on a soup spoon (because everyone orders it, i mean, come on now! #igworthy) The eggplant pizza was amazing, perfectly crusted and plenty of cheese on each slice (humongous portion too). Had the poke taco and it was definitely my fave, love the texture and the crunchiness from the taco shell. For the entree, I got the ribs and I have to say that the dish was the reason I gave this restaurant 3-stars rather than 4. The ribs were cooked a little too long so the meat was dry and not tender at all. The meat still fell off the bone but it was just so hard to chew. Also, the sauce that the ribs were drenched in. It was so strong in mustard, that's all I tasted in my mouth as well as salt. It was so salty, I drank 3 glasses of water to relieve my tongue of the pain. It was such a shame not to be able to enjoy the one thing I was looking forward to. Anyway, at least dessert was good. Because I had 5 other people in my party, I was lucky enough to try all the desserts. My favorite, by far, was the creme brulee. I'm normally not a creme brulee person but the custard inside the creme brulee was made so well! It did not have an eggy taste at all, which is the sole reason why I don't eat it in the first place. Sorry for the rambling. Dessert was just too good that my mouth just started watering. Overall, I would come back for the atmosphere but not the food.

3.0,8/1/2017,"Came here for restaurant week with high hopes. Unfortunately the hostess dashed those hopes as she was extremely rude by ignoring me as I stood there to check in for my reservation and helped 2 other people who jumped in front of me. My friend was waiting for me at the bar and apparently she'd done the same thing to her by answering the phone while she stood there and having a full blown conversation instead of pausing to help her. I get that this place is trendy and it's the ""place to be"" because it was packed on a Monday night but the hostess needs an upgrade in her hosting skills. Now the bartender and wait staff are another story. I wish I had gotten their names but the bartender whipped up this pineapple peacock mocktail for me and it was divine. And god bless my waiters heart for making sure I got extra dried pineapples when I ordered my second drink.The restaurant week menu is limited but it suited me just fine. I had the empanadas which were just ok but the salmon was great and the petite cupcakes were delicious (although the Christmas confetti sprinkles were a little too hard to chew.)

They had given my group of 18, two separate tables for seating, had the food come out at two different times making one table wait while the other is eating. Bus boys have no idea what they're doing and the manager that goes by the name of Art needs to be fire because he does not know how to communicate well with customers. Our waiter Mark was great, he tried everything to accommodate. If you want to go with a small group of four, MAYBE that would be fine but they still make you wait for seating 30 minutes.

The side of sautéed onions that comes with the dish really adds an extra flavor element that sets it apart from other bone marrows I've had before. The BBQ pork ribs my friends ordered were HUGE! The portion was more than enough for two meals and they ended up having leftovers to take home. The maple butter was divine and paired perfectly with the side of hush puppies. I got the tandoori chicken and the meat was cooked well, not overdone, with a great sauce pairing.

The chef's small empanadas were just okay. I got an egg plant pizza for appetizer ...It was cold and 8 dollars pizza near my work is way better than this seriously ..the main dish was the worst. I got the baby back ribs and It was simply junk bar food. I wouldn't eat this unless someone paid me to eat it. I had so much leftovers after paying $120. The service was also bad but I don't even want to get into it.If you are a foodie, take my advice and walk away. There are so many other restaurants with better food for much less money.  The only good part was the fancy interior. You are pretty much paying $120 just to sit in a fancy restaurant for 2 hours.

A few of their small bites were delicious but the main burgers and entrees were average. Maybe I went into it with high expectations, and it ended up being a letdown.

We were actually able to get reservations for a Saturday night.  I recommend reservations as far in advance as possible.  We had to eat with the senior citizens but no one ever rushed us.  I do not recommend kids on a Saturday as this is a place to see and be seen.  Most people are dressed to impress, especially by the bar as the night wore on.  It's tapas style so you order and sample a bunch of amazing foods.  We even tried the bone marrow!  My wife loved the fish tacos.  I loved the steak.  The burger and the bbq fries were so good too.  The onion rings were done to perfection.  The kale salad was well balanced.  The grilled cheese tomato soup dumpling is a must try.Service was beyond reproach.  It was about pleasing you.",0,0,0,Jojo R.,"Bridgeport, CT",36,73,20

5.0,7/3/2017,"I absolutely love this restaurant. I started to come here two years ago for my birthday and am continuing the tradition this year, actually in 19 days! Although it's a tad pricey, I don't mind because you get great food. The atmosphere is vibrant and the service is impeccable. Last year my server was so adorable. She was so sweet and noticed my birthday presents and for dessert, she sent over a candle in a cupcake that I didn't even order! I am recently vegan so I'm interested in what they have to offer that I will be able to eat. Hopefully it's enough to fill me up and not be too overpriced!

We booked our table ahead of time and had to wait about 10 minutes on arrival. Those 10 minutes were spent enjoying free champagne in the ladies restroom. Major props to the genius behind that idea!! Go easy on the champagne as the cocktails here will blow your mind. The Black Tie White Noise and the Emerald Gimlet were ridiculously delish (and strong)! The grilled cheese and soup dumplings were a big hit with us! The eggplant pizzetta was good but nothing special. My husband devoured his crab rangoon in minutes. For dessert, we chose the butterscotch pot de crème and devil's cake. Yum yum!! I gotta try the shake shots and doughnuts next time coz they looked real good.This was such a fun dinner place.

I've been to their sister restaurants in the city and the food is great. But, my pizzetta tasted cool, the 'bacon and cheese' dumplings were not good at all, unless you like the taste of breakfast from a street cart and paying $18 for it.Main course of ribs and ravioli took no longer than 5 minutes to come out, not a good sign. I've had better food in a bar, which is sad because I did go in with high expectations.

3.0,6/27/2017,"My husband and I recently dined at this restaurant for our anniversary, and despite the food and beauty of the restaurant,  I probably won't return. We walked into the cute thrift shop and my excitement built as we walked through the doors into the beautiful restaurant, but thanks to seven people at the front table, we waited for 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged we were there for a reservation. It was 5:10 and no one was really there except us. After standing there so long we began questioning whether they worked there or waiting for their party to arrive behind a glass table until one girl picked up the phone for a reservation. We got seated only to find a dirty mojito glass, and I wouldn't have noticed in the dim lighting except there was still sun out. Our waiter who was a gem came and made recommendations and we placed our orders and were explained they'd come in separately which was what we wanted. Then came the complimentary course which looks huge in pics but it's basically a bite sized pita with beets, which after eating reminded me of the garbage I took out that afternoon... also I'm not a beets fan. Once the food came, things did get better. We ordered the go to bacon cheese dumplings in soup which we could've eaten all night! The duck cervillas was a bit disappointing as it was basically day old nachos with duck sprinkled in. Next came the pork ribs and hush puppies which were a salty sweet mix my personal fav! The ribs were juicy perfectly seasoned and not too rubbery, fall off the bone with some 'graceful' mouth work. Lastly the lamb burger which was actually done right, not super gamey or smelly like some places. And the bbq fries were a perfect compliment and again I could eat them all day.  I'm pretty sure this place only gets first time diners as I noticed the groups around us were new to the place, because it is overpriced and basically food you can try in little Italy or an American bistro. The waiters and staff that refill water and clear plates are the real Mvps, whereas the front staff could all be chucked and drive costs down for the place lol.",0,0,0,Jessica C.,"Bellmore, NY",206,140,238

We had to wait not very long after our whole party came to be seated. The  place itself is very pretty and decorated so nicely. It had such a cool vibe. The music was ok definitely better than other places I've been to but the DJ could have played better music.We started off with drinks, I had the ruby mojito which was okay. It wasn't as sweet like I like it but it had a nice taste to it. As for the food I had the chicken meatballs, bad choice. I did not like this at all. It tasted tart and they were mushy and no flavor whatsoever. I tried to be a good sport and get through it but I really couldn't. There were 3 more people in our party that ordered it as well and also couldn't eat it. We just had to send it back and order something else but the waitress was so nice about it! And she allowed us order something else right away. I opted for the Wild mushroom ravioli, very yummy and filling surprisingly. We didn't have any dessert but I tasted my friend's birthday cupcake and it was good. We went upstairs to the lounge after our dinner, there wasn't anything serious going on up there really but it might have been because they were shutting down soon at 2am and we got up there by 1:30am.

After you enter, there's two floors, with the restaurant downstairs while the bar and seating area are up a grand staircase. My favorite drinks are the Beauty Elixir and the Woodsman. Beauty elixir is really sweet and there's barely any alcohol taste, while the Woodsman is stronger and also an interesting green color. Cocktails are expensive at 16 $ but the environment and decor is nice, so if you're willing to spend a little this place is perfect. Haven't yet tried the food here since we usually go upstairs to the seating areas. Also, in the girls bathroom there's a area with a few sofas and rosè or champagne in exchange for tips.

Me and my 5 girlfriends were on vacation from California and had the best, unforgettable brunch experience ever. From the beginning walking in you knew this place was unique and had a great vibe. The servers were amazing and friendly throughout the whole afternoon. We were there for the champagne brunch ( they say 2 glasses included but that's a understatement ) I am pretty sure me and my friends had 12 bottles of champagne :) The 5 course meal was perfect, all the food was just amazing but my favorite by far was the dumplings in tomato bisque. At first it started off like a cute classy brunch but things got really interesting once the champagne kicked in. People were dancing on tables and they even give you glow sticks to get the party started. I highly recommend this place for a birthday or just a Sunday funday.

They were along the best that I had, the flavor were fresh and juicy and also crispy to the right amount. It was DELICIOUS!!! Of course we also had the Roasted Bone Marrow and the Lobster Mac & Cheese, but there were just okay in my opinion. Red Hook Lobster in Brooklyn is wayyyy better and with a bigger portion for the same price, you should go try it if you haven't yet! Overall this place is a solid four star for me, server were all very friendly and attentive (they keep changing our plates when it's not even dirty).

We sat at the bar and had a couple drinks. Ok, can we talk about  those dranks?! SO GOOD. I don't remember what it was called but I had something with some jalapeno juice or something in it.

He then asked me where I was going I told him my friend had reservations & he still made me get on line. The next bouncer/doorman was telling me to take off my headphones as if I was a child & he stamped my wrist before entering.This scenery of this place was very nice. It was a bit dark, but I guess that was the theme. When we were seated we was placed directlyIn the middle of the restaurant, so this is where all the foot traffic was. Aside from that me sitting there my chair was tapped multiple times that night. They did give out complimentary Moët in the restroom which I thought was cool.The food menu was blah.

You can then drown it with adulthood libations. The cocktails were excellent. The service was very pretty, attentive but not all that bright. Food knowledge was not on par with the menu.

The drinks were great I had the emerald gimlet and he had the SCOFFLAW (real mccoy 12yr rum, luxardo, amaro montenegro, green chartreuse). We order the tomato soup with grilled cheese dumplings, braised short ribs, penne with veal Bolognese, oven braised chicken meatballs. We loved every dish. Those chicken meatballs were fantastic and my husband loved the penne the most. For his birthday they brought out a cupcake with a candle and he ordered a Margarita dessert shot which is lime sherbet with tequila. We would def come back here. We tried comparing it Stanton social since it same company and it is also a favorite of ours. Food quality is just as good my husband think food was slightly better here. And alot more going on, trendier, good music. But we still love Stanton social as well! This is more upscale.",0,0,0,Amelia R.,"Brooklyn, NY",91,45,35

The place was packed, the wait time for a table was an hour, I was lucky enough to snag a spot at the lounge without a wait time. My friend and I spilt the Tandoori Chicken then each got two cocktails. Definitely pricey, but that's NYC for you.

I went in with an expectation that serving complimentary pink champagne was really cool...that was a let down when the server had her back facing everyone the whole time with empty glasses on the bar...so I didn't feel welcomed to even ask for it......even the attendant was too busy counting her tips to ask if I needed soap or hand me a napkin..........then we get to our waitress....I think it was at least 20 minutes before she came to us to get our drink order or even greet us..she probably came over Bc another table sat down next to us.....we were a party of two...I think we saw the food runners more than our waitress....no I take that back...we saw her when we had our card ready to pay.....My Bf had to stack his plates up for the manager to come over but I was also dying of thirst Bc my water had been empty for a good 10 minutes.....really not impressed........for NYC.",0,0,0,Christy M.,"Houston, TX",181,37,37

We had already studied the menu, now starving, so we quickly ordered appetizers once we sat down. The four stars are well deserved for the food and service! Our waitress was awesome and knowledgeable about all the menu items. The grilled cheese, bacon and tomato soup dumplings were ammmazing and the tuna poke wonton tacos were my favorite. The Thai style shrimp were recommended by our waitress and were soo good, as well as the empanadas! The baby back ribs were by favorite entree, the mushroom raviolis were very good as well as the Garganelli. We ordered five of the desserts, but my favorite were the donuts, OMG.

I'd be happy eating here every day.At times service was a little challenging. Its a busy place so that's somewhat understandable. The worst was at the tail end of my dinner.  For a period of about eight minutes I couldn't get anyone's attention while in need of some fresh silverware to replace a dirty spoon which had arrived with dessert.

Everything was perfect, Food, Music, Ambiance.to start off, our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu, being a vegetarian he recommended many dishes that the chef can modify for my needs.(THIS IS ALWAYS A BIG PLUS FOR ME). He also warned us ahead of time that the dishes are all Tapas/Small Plates so we would need to order about 4/5 dishes between two people. We started off with a complimentary dish from the chef and it was delicious. We didn't quite get the exact name of it but it was some kind of a Savory Beet dish. We also ordered the Tomato Tartare, Grilled Cheese & Tomato Soup Dumplings, Avocado, Lemon & Espelette along with one with other thing. Although all the dishes were fabulous my personal favorite was the Grill Cheese, Smoked Bacon, Tomato Soup Dumpling (without the bacon of course). For deserts we had Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Crème & a cookie spoon which was amaaaazing!!!! you have to try this. The food can definitely be a bit on the pricey side for the portions that you get, so I would only go here for special occasionsThey also had very good music playing in the background which was fun.

The food was pretty good but again, slightly changed so that it wasn't the wonderful experience I had the first time around.

5.0,5/8/2017,Everything you hear about Beauty & Essex is true. It's not hyped up its really that cool and really that good. Walked in and it was super cool to feel like you were walking into a hidden space. Don't expect to get a table unless you have reservations. We were a group of 4 and took our chances and ask for one. We were told they wouldn't have one until 10pm. So we asked if we could sit at a bar and they were friendly and showed us up to the second floor. To our surprise the lounge area was deserted and we could sit there eat and mingle. So we did. The one thing I know I'll be back for is the lobster mac and cheese. It's probably on my top favorite mac and cheeses ever. I took back everything I ever thought and said. This place definitely meets the hype.

4.0,5/7/2017,"The entrance is really interesting. There's a gaudy sign outside that definitely stands out in the neighborhood. I think the place used to be a beauty parlor? Now there's a pawn shop out front, and you walk through it to get to the restaurant. Once inside, it's totally different from the outside, and the decor is gorgeous.Amuse: Beets with chive yogurt on a cracker Drinks: - Old dirty bramble (ODB): tequila based. Lots of blackberries, not too sweet - Emerald gimlet: bright green from the basil. I didn't love this drink- it was a little overpowering from the basil - Black tie white noise: completely black in color with the activated charcoal. There's also islay whisky to make it peaty. I chose this one because it sounded interesting and not like a standard drink you can find just anywhere. It was definitely unique and well balanced Food: best done family style.  The server recommended 4-6 dishes for 2 people.- Tomato tartare: super intense concentrated tomato flavor without tasting like just a sundried tomato. It was one bite with sunny side up quail egg on top, sitting on a parmesan crostini. Having tried to fry sunny side up quail eggs with a runny yolk, I appreciate the work that went into this  - Bone marrow toast: a ridiculously big portion with 3 married. It came with grilled thick toast, a good onion jam, and some greens with capers.  This was a good bone marrow dish - Chipotle duck chilaquiles: more like nachos, not a lot of sauce; I didn't particularly like this one- Grilled cheese smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings: cheese dumplings with a good sear outside, soft inside, topped with bacon and parmesan. They're one bite served on a spoon with a tomato soup base. I really liked this play on grilled cheese and tomato soup - Pressed shawarma chicken: chicken breast with blistered tomatoes, kale, apricot glaze, black lentils. It was a good chicken dish, but not as interesting as the smaller plates I would definitely come back for the tomato tartare, grilled cheese tomato soup dumplings, and bone marrow toast again. Most dishes are best shared between 2-4 people, but there were lots of larger parties in there (I think two bachelorette parties the night I was there...). It's a fun vibe with interesting food (hit or miss) and cocktails.  Definitely make a reservation.",3,0,0,Marilyn T.,"Palo Alto, CA",81,2089,202

Once you walk through that, you'll find yourself within a massive two story restaurant/lounge with extravagant chandeliers and fancy design. With that being said, you're looking at higher prices. For those looking to spend a little more and enjoy one of the best scenes the city has to offer, I definitely recommend. I have come both for drinks and dinner and I would have the say taking the drink route is probably better. The food is average and overpriced.

2.0,5/6/2017,"This place is a total rip off. Came here for dinner with my friends and made reservations only to get an attitude from the door man, some man in glasses, because he told me to walk down ""any of the blocks"" to throw out my empty water bottle instead of just letting me throw it out inside. Mind you- its raining. A simple accommodation for a guest is out of his reach apparently. Okay forget that guy with his attitude. I finally get inside to be seated for my dinner only to find out its tapas style? EVERYTHING WAS TO SHARE. And if your party has more people than the standard serving size, THEY PUT IN MORE ORDERS FOR YOUR ORDER TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE EATS.Whats that... when people make reservations you LET THEM KNOW when something different from regular dinner takes place. A simple ""have you been here before"" just like the waiter did when we got there would have been nice upon making the reservation. No one could decide on main courses to share since not everyone eats the same types of food so they all wanted to go elsewhere. This place RUINED my entire birthday. THE ONLY PERSON who was nice was our waiter because he saw that my birthday was literally ruined. He brought my me a birthday cake but I didn't even have dinner first, I could barely eat the cake because I was starving and wanted REAL food.

There's also a downstairs bar and a dining area. So overall It was quite a big restaurant, which was great! I have to also add that the restroom was so beautiful. I would describe it as vintage glam. If there's such a thing. Aside from the beautiful decor, you will be served complimentary champagne. But make sure to bring an ID with you.Now on to the service and food. Service was good. We came in a group of eight. And we were seated about 15-20 min upon our arrival. During the wait, we hung out in the upstairs lounge. Okay so now to the food. The food was very disappointing. I ordered the jerk chicken. Uugh big mistake! Absolutely no flavor, it was so bad. As a person from the Caribbean you simply just have high expectations for a dish such as Jerk chicken to be well seasoned and favorable, but it was the total opposite. Will I ever go there again?

We also had the ahi and ramen noodles, and braised short ribs.  Again portions were not huge but because the flavors are so well done, you are satiated.  The mini donuts for dessert are a must...so good!  As I mentioned, the crowd here is fully of attractive people who are well dressed...probably not a place to roll in with flip flops and shorts.

Seemed to have a few tables opened, it was a week night. The atmosphere was full of life, bumping music and exciting! The ambience was perfectly lit and gorgeous to say the least. As soon as we sat down we ordered a bottle of wine. Then, We were told that 4-5 dishes were appropriate to share between the two us, after a few minutes of decision making...we ordered 5 dishes. Our server also said, they'd course them for us.The dishes seemed to fly out of the kitchen and everything was very delicious...Half way through the meal we were convinced to order another bottle of wine, which we did. Their was a bit of hovering to take our plates away and a few ""are you done with that"", which made us feel a bit rushed. The restaurant was bustling when we got there and then around 12:45, about 5 tables were left in our view. A freezing draft of air started to sweep by us and you could over hear others noticing the chill in the air. When we asked why it was so cold and if they could possibly shut the back door. They said they couldn't, they were taking the garbage out. I guess that's their way or tactic of getting people to leave and it sure did work. Within moments those tables were leaving. We still had a half a bottle of wine left and were not even offered dessert or coffee. The check was dropped off. You could see all the employees counting their tips at a table right by ours and we felt the uncomfortable stares, so we felt compelled to leave our expensive bottle of wine behind. Our bill was $250 for two people, not including tip...which is not a cheap experience. Just seemed very rude and almost scamming to encourage us to eat all these dishes, then order an additional expensive bottle of wine.

We shared 3 orders of the chicken and biscuits, which were delicious and then everyone went their own way and ordered their own meal. The hubby ordered the pork belly BLT and I ordered the eggs Benedict. The hubby was expecting small chunks/pieces of ""pork belly"" in his sandwich, but to his surprise, it was just bacon...... the sandwich was good, but the hubby would have preferred a different bread. The fries were actually very good. I usually opt out of seasoned fries and go straight for regular, salt fries. These were better than most seasoned fries I've had. My eggs Benedict were good. Prosciutto rather than Canadian ham, which didn't make much of a difference to me. Everyone else seemed satisfied with their dishes. The huevos rancheros were beyond small, so make sure to order them as an app and not your main meal.

The rest is just drop dead gorgeous everything is over the top beautiful even down the bathroom where they serve courtesy drinks !! The upstairs also turns to a club/ dance party on specific nights.They serve small dishes I believe that's called family style where you just order multiple meals so you can share them with your table! The price I believe are extremely reasonable which came as a shocker!The drink selection and the waiters/waitresses know their drinks! And they are on top of their tables but don't hover!

5.0,4/16/2017,"Right on par with his Las Vegas location, Chris Santos has once again created a dining experience that's more than the food and drinks offered. From the ""pawn shop"" that adorns the entranceway to the dimly lit dining room and plush upstairs bar, this is a restaurant that's tailor-made to be the cornerstone of your night. Honestly, I cannot commend the staff enough as they were friendly and attentive from beginning to end. The decor also lends to a sort of mystique that only adds to any selections you make off the menu. Personally, I highly recommend any of the raw offerings and/or the bone marrow, which I first tried in LV. While things can get a tad pricey here, especially if you're going to order a few cocktails, it's all very much worth it. Don't come here for a pop-in dinner or drink.

Made a reservation for 5pm for a party of 6 on a Saturday for a birthday celebration. Arrived at 5pm on the dot with the party of 5 people. Tried to check in but the girl at the reception desk said she's unable to check us in until the full party is here. 30 mins later my full party arrived she finally checked us in. She gave us a buzzer to notified us when our table is ready. We sat by the bar and ordered a few drinks while we waited for our table. An hour had pass I went and ask one of the girls that check us in how much longer she said another 30 mins or so we waited another hour in a half. I went and ask the same question she responded ""she don't know if there is going to be any tables available at this point"" what the heck?!! they couldn't come and tell us that ? What's the point of reservations? At that point I had no more patience we were so livid we all just walked out. We were basically starving at that point.  Their hospitality sucks they are so unaccommodating unorganized. I have NEVER waited 2 hours at a restaurant and still not be able to be seated.

2.0,4/4/2017,"We arrived early for an 8:45PM reservation and were escorted to the hostess stand where we were told our table would be ready shortly. The hostess area was packed, and felt more like a nightclub than the entrance to a restaurant. We were patient for about 30 minutes, and then began to get frustrated. We ultimately waited over an hour for our table, after being told repeatedly that we would be seated ""momentarily."" A couple members of our party were older and due to how crowded the entrance was, went to wait outside. When our table was finally ready, we went to go get them, and the door man refused to let us back in. He was extremely rude to me. The hostess was with me and told him that she was escorting us to our table, and he still gave us a hard time about reentering the building. Again, he was incredibly rude and disrespectful, especially for people who have been patiently waiting for an hour past the reservation time. I will say that the manager was very accommodating and sent over a couple of free tapas and dessert, which we appreciated. The place was very cool, but the music seemed overly loud (which makes me sound old, I know), which made it almost impossible to talk to people across the table. The food was also very good, but I would have a hard time recommending this place after our experience.

Food was fantastic. All small plates. Our favorite were the fish tacos. They had an unusually thick but delicate crust. Delish! Skip the eggplant flatbread. The sauce tasted like straight up tomato paste. Broccilini was fantastic but drenched in an oil based sauce. Husband had a burger. He said it was different than most burgers and the fries were the VERY BEST we ever had with a dry rub that made it difficult to stop eating them!! Waiter was accommodating.

There was a minimum to spend at a table ($1000 for the table) but they allowed us the bring in as many guests as possible without waiting in line to enter. The music was mostly hip hop, top 40s. Definitely something to get you moving too. The crowd was mid to late 20s. Mature. Overall experience was great but I must give this place 4 stars because of their customer service over the phone.

The Spaghettini was alright, the soft egg on top balanced put the flavor of the zucchini, which was a lot stronger than I expected.

I had never been here before but had heard about it and was told from a friend that it's a ""boujie"" kind of place. I love boujie so of course I wanted to go and see what the hype was about. I liked that when we got there we didn't have to wait in line for very long and we didn't have to pay a cover charge to get in, however this could be because we arrived after 11:00 pm. When we stepped in I was kinda surprised that it looked like a jewelry shop and was a little confused, but once we opened that door I felt like I had walked into boujie girl heaven. The interior of this lounge/ club  is super sexy and chic. There's chandeliers hanging throughout the space and everything is dimly lit. I was convinced that Lisa Vanderpump designed this club personally herself (she's the main wife on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills). If you've ever been to SUR ( Lisa Vanderpump's restaurant) it has a similar sultry vibe. This is definitely a place to go for a girls night or date night. If you're like me and the ambience of a space is important to you then you won't be disappointed. The music was also on point ( a lot of 90s rnb and new stuff as well). The reason why I gave this review four stars instead of five is because some of the bouncers in the club are a little over the top. I wanted to take a picture on their grand staircase with a backdrop of the chandelier and he was literally forcing me to continue up the stairway. I could see if it was super busy, but there was literally no one coming up the steps. The drinks are on the weak side as well, like they skimp on the alcohol.

That was pretty unique IMO. Odd, but unique. Judging by the groups of ladies who were hanging in the salon portion of the ladies room sipping champagne, it is a pretty popular option!We started with the bone marrow, which as very good, but for the piece I had barely had any marrow in it. I brought it to the attention of the waitress and they brought another one, which was nice. We moved on to the fish tacos. I wish there were more of them, they were on of the best things I had all evening. But for $24 for 3 mini tacos, not a great value. I LOVED the broccolini, it was delish!! The price issue was the same with the grilled lamb chops and the baby back ribs, delicious, but EXTREMELY overpriced. The amount of food for the price was a bit 'under the top'. Overall I have to say I enjoyed the food. And dont get me wrong, I love Tapas and eat at Tapas places often and as with many Tapas restaurants the prices tend to be high, but in this case they were VERY high!I am giving it 4 stars due to the food quality and the general character of the place, but if cost is a factor...",0,0,0,Margaret F.,"Long Island, NY",27,81,69

Beauty & Essex was the place!  I made a reservation on opentable for six on a Saturday night and we were seated within a reasonable time despite being a little late. And honestly, my friends and I all had a wonderful experience! Since it's tapas style, we all tried a little bit of everything and it all was amazing! We started with half-dozen oysters, tuna sashimi and the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings. Those dumplings were so unique and perfectly captured that classic flavor! So delicious! We then ordered the thai fried shrimp, lobster mac and cheese and braised short ribs. I really couldn't find a flaw with any of those dishes--they all were so good! I'd say the lobster mac and cheese was my favorite as it had a nice crispy topping and didn't skimp on the chunks of lobster :)  We ended the meal with the pumpkin cheesecake and the dark chocolate peanut butter mousse. I have to say the mousse was the clear favorite. Some other folks ordered the burger and fries and there were mixed reviews on the actual burger (temperature issue) but the dishes I had were all A+!The ambiance here is prefect for intimate gatherings. With the dim lighting, classy decorations and unique seating arrangements, Beauty & Essex is the place to celebrate special occasions or just a place to pamper yourself with delicious foods and cocktails.

I've always heard great things about Beauty and Essex so we were all hopeful. The place was honestly really nicely decorated inside and it was cool walking through the thrift store to enter. We decided to sit across from the front bar just inside the door. I went up with a friend and ordered two cocktails from the menu as there didn't seem to be floor service at that particular part of the bar. I gave the bartender $40 for two cocktails and stood waiting for my change as the menu said (If i recall correctly) $14 per cocktail. The woman didn't come back with any change and went down the other side of the bar while I stood waiting. I waited a minute or two trying to make eye contact as I was shocked she was trying to jipp me for $12 on what subsequently turned out to be an overrated cocktail. I had to wave down a barback to get her attention. When I asked her where my change was she sighed and went over and stuck her hand in the tip jar and took out $12. I was shocked but out of my own consumer guilt still gave her a tip. I manage two large bars uptown and was shocked at this bartenders lack of respect for clientele.

The drinks were AWESOME.I also tried the lemon pancakes which were fluffy and delicious and perfect. The pancakes and the BLT were the largest dishes that came to the table (they give you a huge amount of bbq flavored fries with the sandwich and they're like crack), and everything else was small. Really small. Ok, they were tiny. Hey, I live in America, this is not what I want to see. It also was annoying that the small plates cost so much. Delicious, yes. Worth the price? Possibly. But make sure you are ready to spend a crud load of money with the possibility of leaving hungry. What you will have will be great, there may just not be enough of it.Would definitely come back here, but not too soon as $300 on brunch is a once-in-a-while kinda thing for me.",2,0,1,Galit T.,"New York, NY",47,167,4
5.0,3/5/2017,"I don't know what it about the Cosmopolitan's restaurants but it's the only hotel in Vegas where I've now tried every venue. I found myself with the opportunity to eat at Beauty and Essex on my last trip in January. I'd heard great things about their other location in New York so I wasn't going to miss my chance. The drink menu is spectacular, we'll crafted cocktails, I had one too many of the Emerald Gimlets. As for the food, since the restaurant recommends eating it tapas style we got a try a fair share of dishes. My absolute must try dishes are the Tuna poke wanton tacos (small but tasty) and the steak tartare. My friend made me try the French onion soup dumplings and I'm glad she did, what an amazing taste explosion! (Even for a guy that hates French onion soup). If you aren't full yet (don't be a wuss) you should try two more things.....the short rib Mac and cheese and the oven braised meatballs. My God, the flavor!!!I know this doesn't cover any of the main dishes but it's almost like you have to decide your approach when you eat here, do you want a main for yourself and maybe an appetizer or do you want to share and try a bunch of things? I obviously picked the latter and I'm quite happy with my decision!",0,0,0,Mauricio B.,"San Diego, CA",43,64,11

Just know that you should also commit to dressing the part though it's not required.

The vibes are perfect! It is a very low light environment that can be both intimate or group friendly. The service was amazing! The waiter was very friendly, knowledgeable, & prompt. The food and drinks.... amazing!!! For drinks my friend got the Pink Panther (Hendricks Gin) & I myself got the Emerald Gimlet (Belvedere Vodka). These drinks were very tasteful but had just the perfect amount of kick. Now we never really had official entrees but more shareable plates between three girls. We did the get the Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos, Crispy Eggplant Pizzetta, Lobster Mac n Cheese, Grilled Cheese with Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings, Asparagus (so good), 'Pastrami' Style Beef Carpaccio, Tuna Sashimi, & topped it off with their very rich Devil's Food Layer Cake.

1.0,3/1/2017,"Horrible from start to finish. I walked in at 5 and they had just opened. None of the, like, seven people standing in the front said a word to me as I walked in. The bartender was CLEARLY not ready to open. I stood at the bar while he ignored me. Finally I asked if he was open and he gave me a menu and I sat down.None of the signature cocktails looked good. A vodka cocktail, infused tequila, etc. Finally I settled on the black tie white noise and it was sweet and tasted like cough syrup. Unbalanced, just gross. I should've gone with my instincts and gotten a glass of wine. I work in the industry as a server and bartender and I have a great cocktail palate. I've had sommeliers and bartenders alike come to me for my opinion on their cocktails. That being said, I'm not as pretentious as I sound; I just seek a unique or classic balanced cocktail. It was just gross.The worst part, though, was being ignored, essentially, by the bartender. He never made eye contact. Never gave me a glass of water. Just nothing. And here's the big surprise: no one said anything to me as I left. Who do these people think they are? It's embarrassing.I would, however, be willing to give this place another try because it's gorgeous inside. But it's hard because I know better. I know that if there wasn't a single person in that building who could've exhibited any indication toward me of knowing anything whatsoever about hospitality, then that's probably an indication of what I can expect there in general.

We checked in, and waited at the bar for someone else, the drinks are expensive ($24) for a Red Bull & Hennessy, but it was my birthday so screw it! They did have someone coming around for coat check, and we decided to check out the infamous bathroom, which does serve complementary champagne, please don't forget to tip. The bathroom has old glass perfume bottles on shelves by the sinks, a nice little sitting area also, perfect lighting for some great pictures, you can definitely spend a lot of time in there, which we did. Once my other friend came we were seated, at first I didn't like where they were going to seat us, it was kind of like a hallway, I kindly asked to either be seated upstairs or the main dining room, it wasn't a problem, and we got a nice booth. Our waiter at first was a man, but then switches to a really nice woman, wish I would have gotten her name, she was great, always checked on us, made sure the drinks kept coming, and even came to the table with complimentary donuts for my birthday, even though we ordered the chocolate cake. Both were amazing! The food is mostly tapas, to share, we ordered the, grilled cheese dumplings, which were my favorite! Lobster macaroni & cheese, also very good, Thai shrimp, it had a nice crunch, and spicy flavor. Another favorite was the short ribs, which came over a nice variety of vegetables. The empanadas were good also, but extremely small.

We were about 10 minutes late for our reservation but managed to squeeze ourselves in on time. (We were told she would get charged if we missed the reservation, but once we got there everyone was very nice). It is dimly lit in Beauty & Essex and it can get a little loud to hear your friends, but the atmosphere definitely works for the environment they are going for. While you wait, I highly recommend you spend some time in the ladies' restroom if you can, to take advantage of the champagne bar and sit down in a less-crowded area. I will say that bar backs were coming in and out frequently so you definitely don't get as much privacy as you'd expect in a restroom, but the bathroom stall doors are floor to ceiling. We ordered several plates to share off the menu - the menu is built this way, and only the burger is meant to be for 1 person - and it was excellent. My friends raved about the grilled cheese tomato soup bites - though I wasn't impressed - and the shrimp and shwarma chicken dishes were my absolute favorites. The server was also so nice about splitting up the checks for us, though we did designate a certain amount to each card. I know this is time consuming so we all really appreciated it.

I wish i tried more cocktails but I was so stuck on their most popular ""beauty elixir"" that I couldn't peel myself away to try something else. We ended up having a lot of oysters which happened to be my favorite, we also all enjoyed the tuna tacos, which were very fresh, crunchy and full of flavor. The place and ambiance is obviously the best part... on a weds it was a full house, but not overly crowded where the noise level makes it unbearable to hold a good conversation. The desserts were pretty good, we had the chocolate cake, the box of donuts and i believe this creamy caramel mousse pudding... from all everyone agreed the chocolate cake was the most disappointing, it just tasted beyond average and nothing special or that flavor to just make you want to close your eyes and savor the chocolatey flavor (that I would have loved to experience being a chocolate lover) the box of donuts were most popular at our table.overall it was great experience, I wish the server came and checked on us more, we had to keep trying to flag her down to order more drinks and food, but still everything else more than made up for it.",1,1,1,Iliana D.,"Manhattan, NY",98,343,163

Beauty & Essex has a speakeasy-style entrance, where you enter into an antique shop that actually sells a variety of different things. You then go through a large door in the back that opens up into a dimly lit restaurant that was packed with people! The crazy thing was also that even though it was 1pm on a Sunday, some people were insanely dressed up--think Meatpacking or Vegas on a weekend night dressed up!Anyways, we were seated quite quickly once my full party arrived, and led deep into the restaurant to a nice plush booth + chairs for 6. Our server was pretty attentive, and explained to us that the meal is best enjoyed by ordering several tapas / small plates and sharing them. We ordered several dishes--the red velvet waffles, lemon blackberry waffles, smoked salmon + scrambled egg toast, lobster chorizo, pastrami mac and cheese, empanadas, and braised short rib huevos rancheros. Everything was yummy, and quite reasonably priced, although portions were on the smaller side. Our waitress was very accommodating with noting to us the quantity of items that each plate came with and offering to up the count for our group--very useful for large groups if everyone wants to try the dish and you don't want to cut it in bits. The only thing was that the mimosa was $17!!!!! I didn't even notice until we got the receipt, but that is ABSURDLY expensive even by New York standards for something as simple as a mimosa, with mostly orange juice and minimal champagne...

Asked a few people for a chair at the end of the table but nobody ever came back. Had to steal a chair from a neighboring table when they left. First two people to order decided on an entree and to split an order of toast. The waiter rudely and awkwardly tells her it's ""too much food"". The rest of the table orders and food came out at 3:50. (In the meantime, friend #1 that ordered steak and eggs was told the restaurant didn't have steak any longer and had to change up her order). When a waiter denies an order/money for their restaurant you'd expect decent portions and LOL they're tapas. ""Grilled cheese with bacon and tomato soup"" was soup samples with a cheese nugget in the middle.. Nice tasting but something Costco would sample.Another friend told the server she was still waiting for an item and he asked her if she really wanted to order that... Like why would a server be judging this poor tiny girl for asking for food she told him she wanted?! Just obscene. We got the check and said never mind.

They messed up one of our appetizers and gave us the eggplant pizzeta instead of the empanadas but decided to let us keep the pizzeta while the empanadas come out. That ish was delicious! Flat, crispy bread, thick tomato paste, yummy, delicious crispy eggplant and soft and creamy burrata. The tuna poke wonton tacos were delicious and the wonton shell made the app. The empanadas were delicious and cheesy. For main I ordered the ribs. You know how some restaurants during restaurant week have small portions? This was not the case. They give five meaty ribs with a side of hush puppies and this crack they call honey butter. I could swim in it tbh. Everything was delicious, flavorful, and the ribs weren't too dry. Dessert was all around delicious.

Also, he noticed I was opening a gift when we got seated, and after the dinner he came by with a cupcake with a lit candle in it and was like ""I saw you open a gift, so I hope you don't mind me assuming it's your birthday."" What a thoughtful dude! Made my night.I love this place. It delivers in all aspects. Would definitely recommend to everyone and anyone.",2,1,4,Tiffany O.,"Newark, NJ",314,516,1390
5.0,2/5/2017,"One of the best options you can get for Restaurant Week - beautiful trendy classy decor and DELICIOUS food from New American cuisine. Definitely worth EVERY SINGLE $ of your $42 for Restaurant Week deal.First of all, this restaurant is HIDDEN behind a hippy pawn shop. If you are not coming here, you wouldn't even realize that it is a restaurant/bar or that there is a huge hidden space behind the shop. You might want to ask that rebellious-punky-looking girl at the guitar counter ""how do I enter the restaurant?"". Don't. Just go straight in, push the door and welcome to the secret world. You are 50% likely to be greeted by a receptionist with some ambiguous European accent.The decor is something to notice - it is definitely reminds me of those bars and restaurants in Gossip Girls where the young trendy upper class New Yorkers socialize. Pendants hanging from modern chandeliers. Jewelries in the boxes on the wall. It plays very well its ""Pawn Shop"" theme. It has the bar area with nice sofa and pinky catchy lightly. There is also a cool staircase that leads to the second floor that will make you feel 10 times more special as if you were on your way to meet a billionaire in a private mansion. The vibe is good - it is classy but trendy, it is crowded and loud but exactly the right amount to heat up the vibe. Now let's talk about food.Since I just did Restaurant Week options with my friend, my food review is limited to Restaurant Week options.[Appetizer] Good:- Poke tuna taco: very good fusion dish that combines the richness and flavor of poke tuna and the crispy texture and refreshingness of lime; recommendedSo so:- Empanada: tastes like regular empanada with some green sauce on top - not sure why this is special[Main Course]Good:- Short ribs with potato ball (?): OMG, the ribs are SO GOOD, period. The meat is so tender and juicy and so cooked that it automatically comes off the bone. The sauce is just right - not too sweet nor too salty. The potato balls are fine. I usually frown upon unhealthy American food especially BBQ as it was always too overwhelming but this is really really good and worth the try.- Pressed shawarma chicken: Amazingly spiced up chicken and tender in texture. It blended very well with the couscous and rice. But it is definitely outshone by the ribs.[Dessert]Good:- Passion fruit panna cotta: spot on as post BBQ ribs refresher. The fruity taste blended perfectly with the milky cheesy base - not too sour/sweet nor too rich. - Chocolate peanut butter mousse: Not bad choice and the peanut butter mousse was rich inside. But it kinda reminded me of taste like ""Reese"" so...In general it was very good experience especially given the good deal of Restaurant Week. It got really busy after 7PM and glad I got the reservation early (book via OpenTable early on!) But unsure if I would come here just for food with full price. I'd come here again to have drinks with friends just for the vibe.",4,1,1,Shen Q.,"San Francisco, CA",756,116,510
3.0,2/4/2017,"The environment is very lux and seems like a beautiful place to spend a night in the city and celebrate friends. Unfortunately the customer service was less than favorable. An hour and a half past our reservation time we were still waiting in the bar area. But what made it unpleasant were the hostesses. I have never had a human being pretend that I am not speaking to them as I inquire about a delay in seating. I understand that the restaurant is busy and perhaps the hostess was encountering a lot of problems at that time; however, me and a group of friends waiting over an hour for a reservation made a month in advance is also a problem. Once seated the Manager did come to speak with us, apologize and brought complimentary appetizers. Our waiter was also amazing. Great vibes, good food.

The downstairs bar is pretty and perfect for waiting for the rest of your party. The melon mojito is The decor in this place is just so good. Frames filled with antique necklaces line the walls of the upstairs dining room and they are so pretty to look at. I've been seated in the upstairs and downstairs dining rooms, the downstairs being my preference. Dinner I tried 2 apps- the tuna tacos and the mini empanadas, both amazing.

4.0,2/1/2017,"Came here last night for restaurant week. The place is great! You walk in through this little pawn shop place and all of a sudden you're in this sultry lounge. This is not a place for you if you don't like loud music, or tight seating. Everyone was really nice from the second you walked in and spoke to the hostess and coat check guy, to the lady in the bathroom serving free rosè champagne, to the service. (The champagne in the bathroom was almost my favorite part!!)The only reason I did not give five stars was because of my servers lack of wine knowledge, not necessarily her fault, but we were sold a ""Pinot noir with a full body"" and it tasted like juice, of course we could've sent back the bottle, but us being servers and not picky just dealt with it, we did not want to start our night like that. Especially with these more expensive bottles of wine, we opted for one more in our price range. The drinks are a little pricey as well but I've heard great things about them. We got restaurant week but decided to start with the bone marrow, that was a first for me and it was DELICIOUS!! The warm marmalade that is served with it was great as well. We had the empanadas and the kale&apple salad. The empanadas were vegetarian and still delicious! It did not need any meat, a little spicy too. And for someone who would never even think about ordering anything with kale, the salad was delicious. Kale is bitter and whatever they did in that salad they cut that bitterness perfectly. For meals we had the spaghettini, zucchini mixed with regular pasta in a pesto type sauce with an egg on top..... I was skeptical about this, but it was AMAZING!!! Looks like a small portion, but trust me it's enough. My friend had the salmon, again this portion was huge she had enough to take home, it was served over a corn relish. Dessert- the peanut butter chocolate mousse, very very rich, but excellent flavors. The mini cupcakes were so cute, my friend enjoyed them as well. I definitely recommend this place for a date night or girls night out, Tuesday's seems to be a popular night to go there, the crowd started picking up as we were leaving closer to eleven.",0,0,0,T T.,"Tarrytown, NY",176,31,55

5.0,1/31/2017,"Great energy, great good and a really good time. Good for groups. Got to be willing to drop a lot of cash but worth it for a night out. Perk: free champagne in woman's bathroom. Becauase why not?The tomato soup dumplings everyone raves about to me were just okay, I think because the flavors were pretty simple, nothing special in there. But it is a unique idea. My friend ordered the Tuna tataki, I tried a bite and it was delicious. The tuna was cooked perfectly and just melts in your mouth. And they gave a huge portion of that.I had the seared scallops. Also delicious. Small for 32 dollars. The cocktails are also well made and they have a lot of specialty cocktails. The best things I think on the menu are the desserts. Cant go wrong with the cupcakes or doughnuts but what really stole the show for me was thier layered chocolate cake. The best cake I ever had. Its a huge portion and comes with ice cream. Its layered with creamy marscapone and covered with chocolate ganache. Literally the best. I think about it every day.",2,2,2,Marisa M.,"Suffern, NY",230,111,259

You go here for the scene, the loud, pricey, gaudy, velvety scene. You don't necessarily go here for the food (though it is solid) just over-priced.So good if you want the full vibe of 22 yr old aspiring models walking around and fancy cocktails made with premium branded spirits. Not the place to go for cutting edge food, impressive technique nor certainly value. It's all about whether you wanna pay up for this atmosphere.

4.0,1/30/2017,"After trying some appetizers at the grand opening of Beauty & Essex, I was excited to try a full meal at the original New York location. I was in town for Restaurant Week, so I made my reservation a few weeks in advance. As it neared the day of the event, I changed my time and party size with the restaurant a few times, and ended up with 8 people at 8:30pm on Thursday night.Half of my party was on time, but the restaurant didn't want to seat us until our entire party had arrived. It was just before 9pm by the time they arrived, and when I approached the hostess to let her know, she handed me a pager. 9:20pm went back to the desk and was told ""the table has their check."" 9:40pm went back and was told ""the table still has their check."" At just before 10pm, some of my party had to leave as they had other plans afterwards. That's when we found the manager PJ who finally took care of us. He bought us a round of drinks and finally had the remaining 5 of us seated. We were pretty frustrated, but we initially late so partially to blame. But still, an hour and a half late with a reservation?Our server Nate apologized for the frustrations, but he was not to blame. He brought out a couple of appetizers courtesy of PJ, which was a nice touch. I feel like they made up for the delay with this and the drinks. From then forward, Nate was awesome and all of our needs were met. One of our party was lactose intolerant and all the dishes were customized to accommodate.Even though I tried a tuna taco already, I chose that as my appetizer. Great dish, and I could easily put away 20-30 of these bad boys. I couldn't decide on a main course and ended up with the ribs per Nate's recommendation. Not the best ribs I've ever had, but they were pretty good and I can't say I was unhappy with my choice. Dessert was the dark chocolate peanut butter mousse. I'm a PB lover, so this was the perfect end to my meal.The vibe of this place was awesome, too, almost feeling like a nightclub. It's a scene for sure. This place could have gotten 5* if only we didn't have problems getting seated. But again, they made up for that very well. I'll have to come back again!",4,3,5,Rob P.,"Austin, TX",2111,2530,1129

The decor is stunning, and the little pawn shop that fronts the restaurant is adorable. We were seated in an intimate booth and indulged in some truly incredible food. I highly recommend the grilled cheese dumpling appetizer and the box of doughnuts for dessert. Our waiter was very attentive and helped us navigate our way around the menu, there are a good amount of different plates to choose from. The only downfall of this place is that it is very pricey for the amount of food given to you. The portions are a bit on the small side, and the drinks are much pricier than any other location I have been to in the city of the same ambiance.

There is a restaurant both upstairs and downstairs and I honestly don't know the difference. There is also a bar both upstairs and downstairs. with lounge sofas to sit and chat on. Crowd is full of young professionals, more women than men I felt like probably because of the free champagne in the women's bathroom which is a really nice rose. There is also a nice lounge spot in the bathroom if you need a break from men.

Hidden behind an in-operation pawn shop, you're let in through the back door and into a beautiful restaurant - a lot of natural light and the dining room is big so seating is spacious and it's not too loud. My boyfriend and I went for brunch and we arrived half an hour early for our reservation, but the hostess was nice enough to seat us ahead of our reserved time. We started off with coffee. My boyfriend's espresso was good - my cappuccino was extremely average. Our waitress informed us that the menu was mostly small plates/tapas so we decided to share everything. For a starter, we split the avocado, lemon and espelette toast. Very fresh and delicious - we devoured it. Only complaint was that it maybe could have used a little more seasoning. For entrees we shared the Huevos Ranchos and the steak and eggs. Both were absolutely delicious and presented beautifully. To finish it off, we split the pot de creme and it was one of the best desserts I've had in a long time.

I have been a big fan of his sister store, Stanton Social, for a while so I wanted to check out Beauty & Essex. First things first, the decor here was amazing, it has such great atmosphere and is a really nice date place or for girl's night out, they even give out free champagne in the female bathroom. The other incredible thing is the number of gorgeous girls that dine there and work there, it was eye candy galore!The food: Brussel Sprouts & Crispy Serrano Ham- Fig-goat cheese, smoky aioli. This was my fav small plate and it kinda surprised me. The Brussels sprouts were good but they were oddly not very brussel sprout-y, they were kinda on the soft side. But overall, the flavors were great. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings- So their sister store does French Onion Soup dumplings and they were fantastic, the ones here were not bad but kinda too simple. They just tasted like tomato soup encased in a eating vessel.""Chile Relleno"" Emapanadas- Poblano, manchego, Jalepeno-lime cream. I thought the flavor of this was good, but the portion was ridiculously small. Crispy Fish Tacos- Chilean sea bass, yuzu aioli, pickled daikon and carrots. The fish tacos like the empanadas were good and made well, but they were so minuscule. It was almost like they were bite sized apps. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs- Sheeps milk ricotta, wild mushroom, truffle. My fav part about this dish was the sauce, the sauce had such an earthy flavor from the truffle. The meatball itself was nice and tender but I wasn't a fan of how grainy the ricotta was. Lobster 'Mac & Cheese""- Pickled jalapeño, jack cheddar cheese, gremolata bread crumbs. This is kinda the hoodwink dish, there was basically no lobster in it. This was such a waste of money since the mac was sub par and there was so little lobster, they could have easily used plain mac & cheese and I wouldn't have known the difference.Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot De Creme- Coconut chantilly. The desserts here really shined. I was really in love with their pot de creme, it was like a really wonderful chocolate pudding. This is a must get. yelp.com/user_local_phot… Box of Doughnuts- Vanilla beignets with chocolate hazelnut crème & raspberry jam. The doughnuts at Stanton Social are wildly popular so it made sense to bring them over here and they were awesome. Perfectly warm and I thought the texture was great.

Tuesday January 10th we went for Drinks and they have an event call Beauty Parlor Tuesday's with a DJ spinning and a lively crowd. From being Greeted by the best hostesses ever, our fav is Danjiella. She was AWESOME open arms very pleasant. We were also greeted by the best coat check cuties (Sway and Raul) who comes up and take our coats asking for initials and providing us a tag. From there were lead upstairs the awesome spiral staircase with and even better chandelier in the middle. We sat at the bar which offered hooks for your hat purse etc. The bar offers awesome craft cocktails and they have a great bar menu (we had already eaten) We were served by Gabbie. The music was great and the crowd was lively. We had a awesome time. We danced laughed, meet locals and enjoyed throughly. We already had reservations for dinner for the next day (my 40th bday) and us having drinks the night before made us even more excited about dinner. As we left we talked with Danjiella and she asked us our names and we left. January 11th 2017 Bday dinner. When we came in we were greeted by Danjiella who remembered our names and greeted us with hugs. They ushered us upstairs and we were able to take pics on the stairs under the grand chandieler. We sat at the bar and had drinks pre game with Gio and he was awesome look for him as we waited for the rest of our party. Again awesome service and great drinks. As we were seated at one of the best tables upstairs which allows us to hear the music and see the people. Our server ROCKED, she took pictures, suggested lots of great food options, friendly, and she was from our city, chicago. The menu is somewhat tapas and we order sooo much food to share. We tried some of everything. Shrimp, fish tacos, peppers, lobster mac and cheese, mushroom ravioli, Brocollini, Lamb chops, Scallops, Food was excellent and full of flavor. I almost forgot; Ladies the bathroom located downstairs is AMAZING. It has music pumping, champagne flowing with bartenders pouring (Thanks Jessie) There is a whole couch and lounge area where you can catch up and have ladies convo.

5.0,1/12/2017,"Let me start by saying ""Whoa you have to check this place out"".. I am a fan of the finer things in LIFE and people full of LIFE and GOOD Energy. This place has it all from start to finish, From Entry to Exit From The Bar to The Dinner Table From the 1st Floor to the 2nd Floor from The stairs to The Ladies Room and everywhere and thing in between.I usually get out once in a while for dinner and drinks while in NYC for business or when in town visiting my inlaws. I've had this place bookmarked on Yelp for sometime now and said I wanted the perfect time to HIT me in my FACE and say GO. Well 2017 made that happen NOT once but TWICE (in my Drake voice ""Back to Back""). My girlfriend flew in to hang out with me while I'm in town for business and it just so happen to be her 40th Birthday week so we made dinner reservations for her actually birthday Wednesday Jan.11, 2017 for a part of 7 as she has friends in the city as well. Since we got in town on Monday and had been roaming the city in the evenings I went to B&E website and noticed that Tuesday they have an event called  Beauty Parlor Tuesdays in which they have a DJ spinning and a lively crowd so we decided to spend her Birthday EVE (just 3 of us total) at the event. We walked in and of course from the outside it look as if it's a peculiar pawn shop. Once you enter it's definitely a pawn shop equip with security and cashier for the many wonderful items that line the wall and the glass cases. Standing toward the back corner of the small pawn shop is a MEN in BLACK suited guy who gently grabs the handle to what appears to be a door and WHA-LA it is the DOOR and once opened you won't believe your eyes. Absolutely Beauty hence the name of this place. THe Bubbly, personable and Beautiful ladies at the front desk welcome you with a smile and offer to have your coat checked. They have their radios and ear buds and signal for the coat check cutie (It was a young handsome guy only 22 and still wet behind the ears but still CUTE ;-) who comes up and take our coats asking for our initials and providing us a tag. We came in dancing and smiling as the music was so awesome so the hostess said to us immediately, I honestly suggest you all to go upstairs to hang as the dj is there and the music will fit your energy on that level. Best advice EVER as we definitely took the advice and started off to the stairwell which is spiral with such a Beautiful chandelier hanging in the middle. Once upstairs we opted for bar seating which I was happy to see that there was purse and scarf hooks under the ledge of the bar which is always helpful for storing purses, man bags, scarfs, hats, etc.. out of the way of the actual bar where the drinking and eating need to have room to HAPPEN ;-)The DJ was grooving I think I got my bar stool pregnant how much humping we did (if I was male) and we also cut a rug (old school terminology for dancing LoL)with some locals out for a good time. We arrived around 9pm and there was a nice intimate crowd that quickly turned to a larger yet still trendy, sleek and hip crowd all full of live and LIVING it in 2017. We laughed, we danced, we drank, we met locals who we invited out for night#2 and we had such a good time.Next, The LADIES room is A- MAZING.. Did I tell you that the ladies room has a bar and a bartender serving Rose' while you get prettified. There is a complete couch and lounge area to sit and met people and catch up with friends in the LADIES ROOM. Yes all of this from FAB mirrors, good lighting, Beautiful and Friendly Bartender to toilet host showing you which stall to enter and providing you papertowels to dry your hands and snacks to munch on while you mingle with other LADIES and drink and do you make-up touch ups (if that applies) or to SNAP or IG SNAP or FB Live LoL. Whatever floats your boat..Day2: Wednesday Jan.11, 2017 My friend 40th Birthday dinner and once again we are welcomed with open arms by the Hostess with the Mostess Daniella who remembered all of our names from the night before           and escorted us this time to a table for dinner which was upstairs right off the bar area. I pre-ordered her a Birthday cake which she was clueless about. We had great conversation, great music and GOOD food. Our server ROCKED, she was very friendly and compensating to my PICTURE fetish as I ask for about 10 options and poses ;-) and an EXTRA plus is that she was from Chicago (My CITY). We ordered sooo much food as the set up is Tapas so you can just have fun ordering and trying stuff which we did. We ordered some of EVERYTHING.Shrimp dish,Fish Taco,Peppers,Lobster mac n cheese,Mushroom ravioli,Brocollini,Lamb chops,Scallops,etc.All the food was amazing and full of flavorThe bartender upstairs who we preGamed with name is GIO look for him. Other notable staff that made our visits amazing are Jessie and Gabby (Ladies Room Bar) and  Sway & Raul (Coat Check Cuties). Daniella again was amazing,We shopped he pawn shop brought jewelry :-)",6,6,5,Bianka M.,"Charlotte, NC",329,529,2592
5.0,1/11/2017,"I've walked by this spot soo many times that I actually thought it was a pawn shop. When my friend brought me here for drinks, I was questioning his taste in bars. Once that back door opened, bam! My jaws dropped at what we found was another speakeasy type setting bar.It was also a very fancy restaurant as well if you're interested in getting food.Cocktails are a standard $15-20 a pop, but taste in drinks exceed my expectations. All appeared to be made by professional cocktail mixers. If there was a Bobby Flay for cocktail drinks, these guys are it. These drinks were that good.The dining section of this place I am unsure as we were not here to get food, but I would definitely bring a date here just to see what this place is about. That's if I can get her to enter a pawn shop without questioning my taste in restaurants.",3,3,2,Jacky C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",171,351,205
3.0,1/11/2017,"So I've been here before and must say I did not enjoy the food last night. It was rather mediocre for over priced food. Not dying to come back to eat. My table shared the ribs with hush puppies, salmon, and the braised meatballs. My favorite drink to get when I come here is the Elixir. I love the decor and the best part is the free champagne in the bathroom. They seem to keep everything clean and put together. They need to update or change the menu a bit because they don't have many gluten or diary free options.

5.0,1/10/2017,"Celebrated my early birthday at Beauty n Essex while I was in New York for a vacation. We stopped at this place so called pawn shop, I was so hesitant and confused, as I walk in the restaurant it was so glamorous, pretty and elegant. The decor was simply beautiful. This place is trendy and hip. Must see when in NY.Since our table wasn't ready, we decide to hang out at the bar. The bartender was very accommodating with the request I had in my alcohol, so he made me an elderflower drink! It was the best drink ever.. so good! As we sat down in our table. Their table space could be better But anyway their food was simply amazing and creative. Serving are small portions so if you're hungry, this place is probably not the best.

5.0,1/9/2017,"Come here to see and to be seen. By far one of the trendiest places in Lower East Side. The scene embodies both a bold and daring crowd yet also sophisticated and attractive. Cocktails are very pricey (over $20 with tip), but hey the restaurant has gotta charge for their atmosphere some how. Was here with several friends for a trendy late night dinner on a Thursday and being with several bros we naturally ordered tons of food. Our favorite dish was by far the Chipotle Duck Chilaquiles. The Braised Short Ribs were a close second. Least favorite selection was the Caesar Toast (tasted a whole lot like a salad). Drinks were stiff and delicious. We were so full by the end that we had to skip desert.",2,0,2,Frank W.,"New York, NY",217,111,75
4.0,1/9/2017,"I came here with a party of five during my best friend's bachelorette weekend. The restaurant ambiance is just stunning. It's decorated beautifully and the music that they were playing was fun and upbeat while not being distracting. As other reviews mention, you enter through an antiques shop at the front which is a really quirky ""speakeasy"" touch. We had a reservation for 8PM on a Thursday and still had to wait a bit before, but we posted up at the bar and had some delicious cocktails. My favorite was the Emerald Gimlet - vodka, basil, lemon nectar, and lime. I am someone who loves basil cocktails, and this one was delicious. Be warned, your bill will not be cheap. One cocktail is $17. I get that this is NYC, and the drinks are delicious, but you should know this going in!We were seated upstairs where we ordered some more drinks and checked out the menu. It was recommended that we order 6-8 dishes for the five of us and we ended up ordering seven including beef carpaccio, avocado toast, grilled cheese/bacon/tomato soup dumplings, thai fried shrimp, chicken meatballs, spaghettini, and side of broccolini. The spaghettini was kind of ""meh"" but everything else was great, with our favorites being the beef carpaccio, toast, and shrimp.Adding to the speakeasy vibe, there is a little bar in the ladies restroom where complimentary ""champagne"" is served! We had such a great time hanging out down here and chatting while touching up our makeup. The service at Beauty & Essex was on point. We really felt taken care of and even received another complimentary dish to share among the group. I would definitely go back to B&E, but I think I'll save it as a ""girls night"" place vs. a date night with my boyfriend. I just get such a fun, flirty, feminine vibe from the place!",1,0,1,Megan G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",182,117,14
5.0,1/8/2017,"Came here for my 25th birthday last night. I can honestly say my friends and I loved being here. It was our first time here. To begin with the place is absolutely gorgeous. We love anything and anyplace that give us that Sex and the City vibe and this place did just that. Reservations: I had no issue with getting a reservation for 8 on a Saturday. However, I may suggest you call no less than a week or two in advance. Service: Everyone was pretty friendly. From checking in to the waiters to the attendants in the restrooms. They were all nice. You can tell these workers like their job.Decor: I mean, it's beautiful. Whether you're out with friends or with a special someone it's really sweet. Large chandelier when you enter. Spiral staircase. There are two bars, one on each floor. The women's restroom is sooo fabulous. Clean, too. They serve FREE glasses of champagne. They have lounge chairs in there too. Perfume and hair sprays for touch ups. My friend said the Men's restroom was really clean too. It's dimly lit but not too dark. Who was the DJ or playing music because the tunes were on point! Oh yeah, there's FREE coat check. That's great because you can walk around or sit down to eat without worrying about a bulky coat in the way.Food: Loved it. I heard from a friend that it wasn't all that but after trying it myself I think they were lying. I order the tomato soup with dumpling that come in individual spoons. That was really good. I also ordered the onion rings. Good! Came with a spicy ketchup sauce and a honey mustard sauce. My guest had the lobster Mac and cheese and the salmon dish. They said those plates were pretty good as well. I recommend! We also got complimentary soup shots. Those were tasty.Overall: Yes, this place is pricey but be real you're getting to dine in this gorgeous place on the LES. Plus free champagne for the ladies and free coat check. It's worth it to me. I would definitely return and this has become my friends and I new favorite place.My 25th Birthday turned out fabulous thanks to Beauty & Essex!",6,5,5,Keiarra L.,"Columbia Street Waterfront District, Brooklyn, NY",43,16,113

4.0,1/5/2017,"Oh what took me so long? I did come in here once last summer after walking over the Williamsburg Bridge after a beer tasting....and proceeded to have three extremely well crafted gin cocktails, but clearly my memory is fuzzy. The space is large and fabulous, three floors of a speakeasy theme that doesn't take itself too seriously. They like to serve good food and drinks in a classy, hip atmosphere, and it stands on its own. This time around we sat in the lounge area on the third floor. Not the most comfortable place to eat (I hate leaning over coffee tables), but a great place to talk and hang out. And on New Years day, or evening rather, they were playing almost exclusively classic rock! Numerous Beatles songs were heard, and so many others I wish I could remember but I was a very happy lady, it was something I wasn't expecting. It also wasn't out of the place with the vibe. I was not in the mood for any of that hair of the dog nonsense, so I ordered a virgin cocktail for the first time in my life: the Garnet Gimlet. This is a delicious option with basil and lime...and possibly watermelon? It was definitely red, but not overtly sweet. It felt like I was drinking something both tasty and healthy. We ordered the burger well done (not my choice, and it came out a proper medium rare anyway), shrimp cocktail, East Coast oysters, tuna poke tacos, and chicken meatballs with ricotta and wild mushrooms. Their burger was solid, I didn't think there was much to it, I definitely preferred their small plates and raw bar. Do keep in mind, these plates are SMALL. Each taco is about two bites for a small person, a larger one will finish them off with a single chew. But they are wildly good, bursting with freshness and bright flavors, it was my favorite item of the night. The shrimp and oysters were all fresh as well, great quality. They also give you extra horseradish, I love when a place does that. The chicken meatballs come three to an order and were tasty, a much heavier choice. I wouldn't come here to get full. The ground floor has a beautiful dining area, bathrooms are in the basement. Each stall has a door that covers you from floor to ceiling. There is also a bar in the bathroom and a couple of seats...I've always found bathroom bars very dangerous. My only issue the entire night was with our bus boys. Their attentiveness was actually really overbearing, almost to the point of it being funny. My partners plate was literally removed from his hands while he was taking his last bite of shrimp. We wanted to keep the sauces, which he could not explain with his mouth full, so a silent tug of war briefly ensued to get the plate back. We were a little taken aback. Then we asked for one extra napkin, which was brought and then handed to my partner while both of his hands were full, again! We thanked him and told him to just leave it at the table, at which point he grabbed a second napkin and tried to hand it to me, but I already had one and was also enjoying my meal. Things like that kept happening throughout the meal. Not a big deal, maybe our fella was new and trying to make a good impression! I know what it turns into on the weekends, so I don't venture here on peak nights. But I think it's a nice option to jazz up a mid-week night.",2,0,1,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",149,1401,3214

My personal fav. -The empanadas were great as well, very small though, i wouldnt consider them cocktail size tbh -The bone marrow was good!

4.0,1/3/2017,"I went to Beauty and Essex for a girl's night out as a recommendation from a New yorker a couple months ago. Somewhat similar to restaurant in Boston called yvonnes for anyone that has been there. It has a speakeasy vibe with a pawn shop entrance which opens up to an extremely glamorous restaurant with an upscale feel. The decor and ambiance is a 5 star experience. We had reservations. The food is mostly tapas style in which it is recommended to order 4-5 dishes to share for two. My friend and I ordered the grilled cheese/tomato soup dumpling (heavenly bites of comfort food), brussel sprouts/Serrano ham toast (excellent), chicken meatballs (solid), empanadas (delicious but small), and lobster mac and cheese (disappointing). I forgot what drink we got but it was great and strong. Overall the food and service was pretty great. Prices are higher than average but it is kind of worth to for a memorable night out. I loved the place and would say it's more of a 4.5 star. Also, ladies need to go to the restroom! There's something special and unique in there waiting for you!

The braised ribs, rabbit and tuna poke tacos were delightful. The burger veal/rib/lamb mix was just mediocre, expected more from having tasted a similar one at DBGB restaurant. We then moved our party upstairs to their lounge/bar area which was fun and not at all crowded like most bars/clubs for NYE where you are literally inches away from your drinks being knocked over. The clientele was also impressive, mostdressed elegantly and formal casual. Loved every minute of our first NYE city experience as husband and wife.

As a tourist, this restaurant had the cool vibe I was hoping for in NYC.  Waking up to the pawn shop and going through the side door to enter a different world was super fun!  We had to wait an hour past our 9:00pm reservation to be seated but the club area was a fun place to wait. Three out of the four dishes we ordered were amazing. We had the cheese dumplings with tomato soup, Brussels sprouts on toast and bone marrow. I could have ate a second order of the dumplings by myself. They are severed in a spoon full of tomato soup. Adorable. The sweet and salty combo is perfect. The Brussels sprouts were perfectly cooked and the bone marrow tasted very buttery. I'd order all of them again.  Do not order the chicken shawarma. The tomato sauce tasted like ketchup (from a bottle), the chicken was cold and the lentils were over cooked. We should have sent the dish back. This was disappointing because everything else was excellent. The shawarma is why I give this place 4 stars instead of 5. Wish we had tried the desserts.

The crispy texture of the bacon complemented perfectly with the dumplings and the soup...can't go wrong. The lobster mac & cheese was delicious as well, and so was the burger. The burger had brisket, short rib & lamb, and while I don't usually prefer lamb, it wasn't too gamey and the combination just worked. Some reviews commented that the ciabatta bun was too soggy, but we experienced the opposite. When I cut the burger in half, the bun gave a nice crunch, and stayed that way the entire meal.

We were a party of 7 and I made sure to request a nice table for the party. We rented a limo for the event and our entire party arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation. The lobby of Beauty & Essex was incredibly small and the hostess asked us to wait closer to our reservation time for a table. It was complete chaos waiting in the lobby as it was crowded and people were very drunk, rude and pushy. Not a very classy affair at all. We actually witnessed someone falling head first down the stairs. A man even tried to physically touch/grab me while we were waiting in the lobby (I had on a birthday sash & tiara). We weren't actually seated until 10:40pm. An entire 40 minutes after our ""reservation time."" We stood in high heels in the lobby with a 12 degree draft from the door opening and closing for a total of 55 minutes!!! It was absolutely ridiculous and SO inconsiderate! It was my 21st birthday after all; we could have stayed in the warmth/comfort of our limo! The hostess was very rude and kept giving us excuse after excuse about them having to clean the table, etc. Since when does it take 40 minutes to clean a table???? After waiting for 55 minutes, our table was AWFUL. It was small, crowded and ugly in the middle of the room downstairs with absolutely no ambience. The McDonald's on 42nd has a better view! I am especially upset about this because other parties with the exact same number of people got much better seats and they hadn't been waiting nearly as long as us. A table behind us had their waiter surprise them with a small birthday cake and long sparkler candles as they sung ""happy birthday."" Our waiter did not bother to do the same for me and it couldn't have been more obvious that it was my birthday. I had on a freaking tiara and sash that said ""happy 21st birthday."" After my friend complained about the disparity in service, the waiter said that if we brought dessert they would throw in something extra. The other table was not required to purchase any dessert to get a complimentary birthday treat. This was literally the WORSE service that I have ever received in Manhattan.Furthermore, the food was 100% subpar and the waiters were rudely cleaning table while we were still sitting down and hadn't even received the check yet. Our table was cleaned and reset before we ever left, so please, Beauty & Essex, explain to me why we had to wait 40 minutes for ""our table to be cleaned.""I had a terrible experience here.

3.0,12/12/2016,"Had our Sunday family dinner here. Made a reservation for 6pm but the dining room was not ready until 6:15pm. People were piling up before 6pm. Hostess (an Asian woman) was not very friendly.  Once seated, the place is very elegant and comfortable. Cocktails are on the pricey side. Everything we ordered was very good, small portions though, and again on the pricey side.  Noticed that the waitress(es) are trained to get you to order more, in a friendly tone but quite noticeably pushy in that regard, which can be annoying.  I think people can decide for themselves that if the food is not enough they will order more! Overall, I think this place is so hyped up.  Nothing spectacular although not bad. It is expensive so be prepared.  I may or may not come back....",0,0,0,Anna C.,"Staten Island, NY",0,3,0
5.0,12/11/2016,"I've been here a few times. The first time, my girlfriend and her fiancé treated my husband and I for my birthday. We sat upstairs and had a super sexy small plate dinner and the bill was a whopper. I loved sneaking off to the women's bathroom for pink champagne in the salon. It's so cute down there; mirrors everywhere, music and a bartender that's slinging pink bubbly for the feminine patrons that are hiding out from their dinner mates. We spent a good twenty minutes sipping champs and freshening our makeup. The food was equally impressive as the sexy decor and ambience. It was a no-brainer to bring my girlfriend back for a birthday brunch. We enjoyed some Beauty Elixir cocktails and a lot of food. We eat well and B&E served up some sultry dishes.",15,6,10,Amanda G.,"Yonkers, NY",1010,912,5110

Do not be fooled by the clever entrance. What appears to be an awesome shop (and is) sits right in front of the main entrance.To start, door woman was great. It was VERY busy when we arrived but she was so accommodating. When our 3rd guest arrived we were quickly seated at an adorable little booth inside.First thing i noticed was how BIG this place it. literally levels to this shitWe didn't order much food but for what we did have (fries, other random munchies) it was delish! I had a cocktail off the menu that was soo good, and the rest of my party did as well.Later, more friends joined us and they had no issues getting in or being able to join us at our table.The most memorable thing about B&E tho, is the ambience. The music was top freaking notch, the dim lights, the decor, it was all so incredibly intimate and sexy.Now, the rumor is true... there is a bartender IN the ladies room - serving up FREE champagne as you wait in line. i mean, that alone should have you coming here again and again.I really hope they do open in LA. ive been telling all my friends about what a dope place b&e was and i hope they all get to experience it.",3,1,1,Arati P.,"Los Angeles, CA",301,158,44

These were my favorite thing.  Also the pork belly BLT which was really good.  We also had the steak and eggs-which was cooked perfectly.   Also lobster and chorizo hash.   We all got coffee at the end and luckily I was able to spike it with my peppermint schnapps in my purse.  No shame!  I doubt I will be back. Again the food was terrific but very small portions for the money and the atmosphere was a little too uppity.   Too many other places to try in NYC to make a repeat visit.   Also have been to their other restaurant Tao a few years back and it was fantastic.",0,0,0,Nicole B.,"Newark, DE",28,454,331

It's decorated beautifully--pretty modern but with a glamorous vintage flare. One downside is that we were seated at 9:45 for an 8:45 appointment and from what I'm reading it seems to be the norm so be ready to wait a WHILE. On a brighter note, the drinks and bar area were wonderful--very flavorful and the food was great too.

4.0,11/30/2016,Came here on a Sunday afternoon for my best friends birthday brunch. They have a special brunch menu which is around 55 dollars a person plus tip and tax for a glass of champagne and 6-7 items on the menu. I was vegetarian so I. Like to eat a few of the things but the staff really worked with the chef to accommodate for me so they swapped out a few items that were meat with a veggie friendly palette. The ambiance gets a little rowdy after everyone has had food and the booze really starts flowing. Good dance music overall but I think the crowd gets a little nudge and tunnel after sometime. I think the place is less New York City but more outside of manhattan since it's been published. Overall a good experience but I don't think I would come back again due to the fact that there are hundred more places in the city with better food and crowd.,0,0,0,Kosha S.,"New York, NY",66,40,52

So when we made eye contact and flagged him down, we saw us, and walked away. It wasn't until someone brought us four complimentary Earl of Pearl cocktails (booked from Amex concierge) that someone finally paid attention to our table. So what, we need to be of some status to be treated equally?Food was fine. Scallops were great- I'd get that again. The ""soup dumplings"" (or dumplings on  top were fine too.

I'm a sucker for those things.Food: Nothing particularly *amazing* but it was delicious! The Crab Rangoon Toast was great and I ordered the Garganelli w/ Bolognese as my entree. My entree was definitely the best dish we got. My boyfriend ordered the Baby Back Ribs and they were very tender - meat melted right off the bone! Drinks: AMAZING cocktails. The Beauty Elixir is on the sweeter side and the Melon Mojito is a more refreshing drink. Service: The biggest reason I really can't give the place 5 stars is the service. Our server was relatively friendly, but pretty lackluster. Nobody seemed to really care how we were doing our how the food was...our server never made any conversation or an effort to make us feel particularly welcome.

The tomato soup/grilled cheese was very good, and we got the kale salad as well. We also ordered the tuna/soba noodle dish... and it was great, but I think it didn't match the other two things we ordered. I wasn't completely thrilled with the food, a bit of an odd menu assortment, but what we got was yummy. Also got the chocolate cake with ice cream... that added a whole star to this review :P Highly recommend.

Well, there's a regular menu where you can order actual entrees - we had Roasted Bone Marrow, Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings, Crispy Fish Tacos to start.

1.0,11/7/2016,"I really genuinely wanted to like this place. The restaurant itself is beautiful. Unfortunately that's where the buck stops.ROUND 1: The menu is huge; 5 pages of California Pizza Kitchen and Guy's American Kitchen's greatest hits. Started off with the steak tartare, which tasted like raw hamburger meat and chili sauce. The brussel sprout toast tasted like ham cheesecake, and was the first item of the night we had to spit out. What followed was a flurry of unidentifiable proteins on rice cakes and friend wontons, all of which were insipid, uninspired and probably borrowed from a Dave and Busters menu.ROUND 2: The waitress recommended the Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup Dumplings. They tasted like out of the jar marinara with a piece of greasy bread on top. Horrible. The Shishito peppers were actually the highlight of the meal and the only thing on the menu I can recommend. The Chile Relleno Empanadas belong in a chafing dish at a bowling alley buffet. Greasy, chewy and no better than a gas station taquito roller.ROUND 3: First up the Octopus Cassoulet, or as I called it ""baked beans and fish bait."" Took one bite and had to spit out the octopus, which I can only speculate was improperly refrigerated in transit. The meatballs, which our waitress also strongly mentioned were not horrible, but really lacked salt and were essentially indiscernible from Ikea brand Swedish meatballs. They also definitely contained a heavy helping of that god awful truffle oil instead of the just using porcini powder which would have given it an earthy, umami flavor with none of the processed taste. Finally the Short Ribs on top of the same brussel sprout matter that we couldn't stomach the first time. These were actually okay, but very one noted and clearly had not been butchered to remove the exterior gristle.THE SERVICE: Waited 45 minutes to be seated despite making renovations well ahead of time and arriving early. Our waitress was cold and uninterested in our well-being. Our water glasses were filled once and only after we requested that they be. We never had silverware after any of our courses because they cleared our plates and utensils a never replaced them. When we sent things back that we could not eat she looked at us like we were crazy. I'm guessing the server was inexperienced and had no knowledge of NYC standards of service because that behavior would not fly in any serious restaurant.Enjoy the nightlife and generously poured drinks at this speakeasy bar and steer clear of the TGI Friday's food and waitresses.",0,0,0,Brian S.,"New York, NY",0,1,0

4.0,11/2/2016,"Came here for a birthday dinner and it was perfect.  Apparently this place is owned by the TAO dining group so it makes sense the kind of atmosphere.RESERVATIONS:  Called to make reservations a month in advance and got my first pick of a Thursday night.  When we actually came the place was packed so make reservations in advance (no more than a month).ATMOSPHERE: Like you've probably read, the outside looks like a pawn shop.  I think you can actually buy stuff in the store.  Don't worry about getting in because it's kind of obvious with 2 bouncers standing outside.  Once you walk in they welcome you and point you to the door to get inside.  Once you go inside it's very dark, romantic, trendy with music blasting, candles lit and chandeliers. There are multiple rooms, if you want to sit in the main one you have to go further in, we got seated in the ""hallway"" room, but it was still nice.  FOOD: They suggest 4 dishes for 2 people, and it was definitely enough.  Each dish is around $15-20 each.GRILLED CHEESE DUMPLINGS - there are 6 of them that come out so it's definitely a good dish.  The ""dumpling"" is a bread like dough filed with cheese sitting on top of a soup soon filled with tomato bisque soup.  It was pretty good, and unique.BONE MARROW - a last minute addition was our favorite dish.  It comes with 2 huge bones and bread, a ""jam"" and salt/capers to put on top.  it was buttery, fatty, delicious and with all the flavors at once make for a great bite.MUSHROOM RAVIOLI - the most forgettable dish, it was decent but not sure their pasta is their forte.BURGER - if you don't like lamb, don't get this.  Despite it being mixed with different meats, the lamb does come through.  For me, I loved it but my husband wasn't a fan.  It's also very big and comes with bbq fries.  The fries taste like lay's bbq chips in fry form.  What I really enjoyed about the burger (other than the patty being juicy and very flavorful) was that the bun had a slight chew to it.  Reminded me of a mix between a brioche and ciabatta bun.  It was very good.Overall, definitely a great place to take someone for their birthday or to celebrate a birthday.  We saw lots of groups of girls, which makes me think it's also good for a girls night out.  The food was above average but the atmosphere really makes it.",5,1,2,Brittany T.,"Manhattan, NY",1379,808,1533

4.0,10/31/2016,Came here with my friend yesterday for Champagne Brunch. We had a 3:15pm reservation and were seated at 3:30pm which was fine. Very cool ambiance. You walk thru a Pawn Shop which is cool in itself and then the door opens and your inside what feels like a massive vault but so swanky! It was super busy upstairs. It is definitely a party scene upstairs with awesome music pumping by the DJ and the music was great. Such a good mix of music... the brunch which is $55 per person includes 2 glasses of champagne. I have to say either we were just lucky or they are super generous but the champagne was flowing all afternoon! It was such a fun time! Everyone was in party mode... the brunch was great and so generous with the amount of food you get. Dishes kept coming out plus the service was fantastic. Nothing slipped thru the cracks considering how many people were there and how chaotic it is. I saw a ton of birthday parties - def a great spot to have a birthday.

Beauty and Essex has been on my bookmark ever since I moved to NYC and when I finally came here, I loved the vibe, food, and overall experience!*Tomato cheese dumplings- they are served on the spoons we are used to seeing in Chinese restaurants. Our waiter recommended these and although I was weary at first, these were the BEST part of our dinner. The tomato soup isnt too tomatoe-y and not too creamy either! DEF GET THE DUMPLINGS!*Crispy fish taco- don't underestimate these! Theyre so flavorful and Comes with 3 tacos and although they're small, they are filling. *Crispy Wonton Poke Taco- fresh tuna stuffed in a wonton shell. Its tasty but Im not sure if I would get it again.I dont recommend the burger. The bread is a ciabatta style and get soggy. The patty is very juicy, which is good until it gets all over your hands. YuckkyDinosaur and I came here for our date night and while we had a blast, I think this place is also good for girls night out. Dishes are shareable between few girls and not really for a big hungry appetite person like my Dinosaur. And I love the bathroom - feels like a department store ladies room!Tip: Don't get confused- the store front is a pawn shop.

3.0,10/27/2016,"My friend and I came here for brunch on a Saturday around 1:30PM after hearing this was a great brunch spot in the LES. The outside of the restaurant front looks like a very old pawn shop from the 1980's and when you enter the front vestibule, it is the same. Kind of love this tribute to the LES of the 80's (minus the heroine). It also gives it a speakeasy kind of vibe. There is front desk where reservations are honored or made. Once you pass this, you open and enormous door and enter an Old Hollywood glamour, kind of boudoir inspired room that is HUGE. I did not expect the space to be so big inside! There is another desk inside where you can checkin for your res or see if they have room for your party. I highly recommend making a res. The place was absolutely packed when we arrived and got even more packed as the afternoon wore on. There was no room at a table for us but the full brunch menu is served at the bar and the short cocktail tables in the bar area so we opted to eat at the bar because we could do so right away. The cocktail menu is very inspired and the drinks are very expensive, but worth it. We each got one and throughly enjoyed them. They were very well made. The menu is small but has a pretty good variety of items. The only unfortunate thing about the menu is that a lot of the elements of each dish are pre-made, so if you are vegetarian like me, this eliminates 80% of the menu for you. I settled on the lemon ricotta pancakes with blackberries. They were good! My friend got the breakfast pizzeta. She thought it was great! Great flavors. This place was cool but sitting at he bar was VERY annoying. By the end of our meal, the place got really packed and lots of people were waiting for their tables. Which meant they were all in the bar area. Crowding around the bar getting drinks. By the end of eating, there were a multitude of 20 somethings hovering around me, over my shoulder, trying to get a drink. I could fed my pancakes into women's mouths right over my shoulders. I would be sure to make a res so you can actually get a table. Beauty & Essex kind of reminded me of a place you'd see the characters of Sex and the City patronizing. It was a cool place with decent food but it is definitely a place where people want to be seen, so that type of crowd goes here.",0,0,0,Joanna V.,"Brooklyn, NY",153,1361,1267

I called the restaurant the next morning and no one got back to me until my third call two days after. Waited at the restaurant for an hour to retrieve one of the gifts which was unwrapped and tore. Seriously? How could you unwrap your customer's gift and not to mention tearing it up? The restaurant said they didn't have the package nor the bag of the gift. Wow so the gift just unwrapped itself?!

1.0,10/24/2016,"Ate here on 10/15/16 for my bachelorette party. One star is for delicious food and for the waiter we had that evening.The behavior and attitude of the front of the house was downright despicable. I'll start from the beginning. When my friend called to make a reservation 2 months before, the reservationist said for a table of +10 people, the only two seating times were 7:30 and 9:45. At the time we had 10 girls who were joining so we were able to get a table at 9pm. Closer to the actual reservation date, we had anextra guest who wanted to join. They refused bc there were allegedly only two tables for that size party and they only sat larger parties at the two aforementioned times. She was also told that if we were late, our reservation would be forfeited and she would still be charged for our meal. We arrived around 8:50 and checked in with the hostess. 9:15 we were still waiting. The girl who was at the front told us a large party was finishing up. 9:25 we were still waiting. 9:30 we were still waiting. We asked for the manager and he apologized, offered champagne and went upstairs to see what was going on with the large party. When he didn't return, my friend had to go upstairs to find him and demand what was going on. 9:40 we were still waiting. I told the girl at the front desk how ridiculous it was because we were not able to include the extra guest due to their strict reservation rules. She shrugged her shoulders and verbatim said ""well what do you want me to do?"" (NEVER apologized)We finally sat down to eat. The waiter and manager  brought us rose champagne when we sat to apologized for the wait. Halfway through the meal, my fiancé asked his sister if we ever got the rose champagne he had sent to the table. Yes, we had gotten it but the staff at Beauty and Essex decided to pass it off as if they were giving it to us ""on the house"". I have never experienced such disgusting and unprofessional behavior and treatment from a restaurant, which is unfortunate because I frequent Stanton social as well. I will not be returning to either establishment unless there is a change in management.

That dish was followed by the bagel and lox pizzeta, which was so fresh I had to pause between bites to breathe and tell myself I wasn't dreaming. I'm not normally a huge fan of ordering lox because I find it to be overpowering, but this lox was paired with an amazing poppyseed flat-bagel base, cream cheese, and roe. The flavours took traditional bagels and lox to a more refined level. The final fish was the burger with brisket and lamb with the BBQ fries. I can't properly describe this one other than saying that if you are there, don't miss it. The bun was amazing. The patty was amazing. The toppings were amazing.

5.0,9/25/2016,What a unique place for a fabulous dinner.  Not sure what I liked more - the food or ambience.  It's set up like speakeasy.  Resell store in front with door that lets you into another world.   I jumped out of cab as my friends were paying.  They had no idea where I went as it feels like Alice in wonderland.  The food is top notch and so are the craft cocktails.  And the bathroom has free champagne.  Women were socially hanging out in bathroom which I haven't seen since my college days.  Very trendy and fun.  Would come back in heartbeat.,0,0,0,Cherie C.,"Birmingham, MI",1,38,3
5.0,9/23/2016,"I came here for the first time last night with a party of 5 and we had a great experience. The vibe is welcoming and un-pretentious. You enter into a little shop downstairs which is a little strange, but go through the back door and becomes the bar/restaurant area. We ordered a range of drinks from champagne to jalopeno tequila drinks - all were great. The tomato soup dumpling spoons were FANTASTIC.  It's really dark inside and music is loud for talking, It was a bit pricy, but our waitress was excellent - friendly and attentive. We stayed till a little past closing and weren't even pressured to leave. Great staff and great experience overall - will definitely be back",0,0,0,Katie O.,"Mahopac, NY",98,42,31
5.0,9/23/2016,"Great place to hang out and eat and drink. I love all their food. Let's start with my favorites: drink - Emerald Gimlet! food - their dumpling tomato is the sh*t. You can't really go wrong with anything on the menu.This place can get really pack so I suggest you to have a reservation before you come. I never been here at night, all my visits were during the day and so far so good. I prefer to sit towards the back of the room where they have the sunroof so you can some natural light, beside it's also far from the bar where all the noise usually come from :PThey serve tapas style it is recommended to order certain amount of dishes even for only 2 people. So don't feel weird or anything when the waiter tell you that you need to order 4-5 dishes for 2.PS.If you guys like this place too you might want to check out Vandal and Stanton Social. Yup! thanks to Chef Chris Santos now we have more places to go hang out and eat good food.",0,0,0,Michelle P.,"Brooklyn, NY",155,133,358
5.0,9/22/2016,"I came here for the first time when I was scouting out places to go for my birthday. I'm a big fan of craft cocktails and this place certainly knows how to make them.On my first visit on a Monday night I tried the A Taste to Topaz which is a sparkling cocktail and it was delicious. The restaurant section was pretty full but we were able to find two seats at the bar and were very comfortable sitting there for an hour. I was so impressed by the drink that I ended up making a second visit on a Saturday night a couple of weeks later.Arrived around 10:30 on a Saturday and it was PACKED on every level. It was actually difficult to get to the bar to even order. My four friends and I ended up going straight downstairs for the free champagne in the ladies room so that we could sip on that while we scouted out a place to hang out near the lower bar. We were finally able to order drinks. I went for the Pink Panther while one of my friends ordered the Emerald Gimlet. Usually I'm not a fan of drinks with ingredients like basil (which is in the Emerald Gimlet) but this drink was so well balanced and refreshing. Seriously, their cocktails do not disappoint.I can't speak to the food here, but have thoroughly both of my experiences visiting. I would probably knock it down to 4.5 stars if I could, since the lack of seating is disappointing when you're paying $17 for a cocktail and $8+ for a beer, but this is simply how it is on a Saturday night in New York. The ambiance and quality of the drinks makes up for it.",0,0,0,Jessica W.,"New York, NY",0,15,0
5.0,9/21/2016,One of my most favorite restaurants in NYC #beautyandessex is like an adult Alice in wonderland speakeasy created by the talented #chefchrissantos.

5.0,9/21/2016,"I will try to make this review short, but we all know thats not going to happen lol. I was visiting NYC for the weekend and was invited out to brunch. My date had a Uber to pick me up, so I had no idea where I was going or what to expect. Because usually I yelp places before I visit. Once we got inside, I noticed that it was a small pawnshop. I was intrigued and wanted to see more. Once we went through the back door of the pawnshop, it was as if we had entered a different world.      The Hostess table was actually a jewelry counter with sparkly costume jewelry inside. We had reservation so we were immediately seated. As I was admiring the atmosphere, I noticed that the place was quite packed.  It was fairly dim inside, slightly above average in noise, but we were able to hear each other talk.       We started of with a round of mimosas.  I was slightly surprised that the items on the menu were small plates instead of entrees. That's when I knew that I should just look cute, sip and let him do all the ordering lol.     We ordered the double cured and maple smoked bacon, lobster and chorizo hash, skillet roasted potatoes, braised short rib, chicken fried steak, and the chicken meatballs as well. So yes, we had a lot going on and our little table was full.  He wanted me to try the whole restaurant I guess,lol.        The funny thing about this is that none of the items were what I was expecting when they came out lol. You know how you have a picture in your head of what the dish is going to look like? Well, I was wrong about everything lol.   Hmmm, being that I was in another city, being adventurous and on a date, this mysteriousness ( if thats even a word)  was right up my alley.  I cant remember the specifics of all the dishes, but I enjoyed everything. I don't usually eat eggs or seafood and the majority of these dishes had either one or the other so that says a lot. I also had another drink  that tasted like orange sorbet, but cant remember the name.       So basically, I did all of that rambling just to say.... try this place out.",1,0,1,Ashley M.,"Dallas, TX",228,149,52

5.0,9/18/2016,"Don't judge a book by its cover--the outside pawn shop would have you believe this place doesnt exist or is super divey but a secret entrance lies behind those doors which will make you feel like you've stumbled upon a secret society.For this visit, we shared:-Beef Tartar-Bacon Cheese Dumplings with Tomato Soup-Seared Scallops-Short RibsAdmittedly, this was my first run-in with beef tartar and it was pretty good. The dichitony between the soft meat and the crispy fried rice cake it sat upon balanced the texture well, but I could have used a little more rice cake. B+The Bacon Cheese Dumplings stole the show for me. They arrived in small ladles with a little fried gem sitting in a tomatoe sea. I want this as a main course! A++The Seared Scallops were cooked to perfection. I've never had scallops prepared so well. They melt in your mouth and are packed with flavor. A+The Short Rib was just okay. I'm not sure exactly where this dish fell short but I felt it was a bit bland by comparison to the other dishes. Short ribs tend to be fatty and this was no different. Not a huge fan of fat, but I don't fault the restaurant for this. B-Just a quick word on the service: Thank you for a stand-up job. PLEASE come to South Florida and hold lectures on proper service. This experience was top-knotch from beginning to end.

My first time visiting I was disappointed by the long wait despite having reservations. But because of the fantastic food and lively atmosphere I really wanted to give it another go. I spoke with Amy, the reservation manager beforehand, and not only did she make sure we were seated promptly, but we received top notch treatment throughout the entire meal. We ordered a wide array of dishes. Some to note were the fish tacos, chicken meatballs, Thai style shrimp and empanadas. Everything is plated with such precision and finesse, and it all tasted equally good. Our server, Mark, was a riot. He was attentive, knowledgeable and had some smooth dance moves! And the dessert. The dessert was un-frickin-believable. Box of donuts, the best chocolate cake I've ever had, and black bottomed butterscotch creme de pot. You guys, the dessert was epic. This was definitely one of the most pleasant dining experiences I've ever had. You truly get what you pay for - and it's worth every penny.

3.0,9/6/2016,"I have lived in New York my whole life and have never stepped inside until now. My friend was visiting from LA and wanted to check this place out. It was hard for us to get a reservation online with the time we wanted so I decided to go through Amex Concierge. Thankfully they were able to secure us an 8pm dinner on Labor Day Weekend. Upon arriving, we still had to wait another 30 mins for our table to be ready. That already got me a bit annoyed, as we had plans after. However, not only did we have to wait, but everyone we seemed to encounter from the hostess to the waitress seemed like they hated their job! They weren't necessarily rude to us, but they definitely weren't nice. I'm not too sure what the reason was. However, once they saw that the reservation was made through Amex, their personalities seemed to changed. Everyone in our party even got a free drink!The food portions are small like what everyone else had said, but we knew this going in. We ordered the tomato soup dumplings, the Salome ceviche, and the scallops. It was good but nothing to die for.The bathrooms are clean but upon leaving, 3 out of 4 stalls were out of service in the basement, causing a long line.All in all, definitely a place to check out at least once, but I'm not sure if I'll be returning.",2,1,1,Wendy H.,"New York, NY",356,54,26

5.0,9/1/2016,"This is a classic favorite. I've been here about 5 times and love it every time. It's hip, swanky, fun, and delicious. The atmosphere is great. It's located behind a pawn shops and once you go in its luxuriously decorated with chandeliers and comfy booths. It's a very young crowd that's usually there, and there's even free rosé served in the restroom. (Just tip the attendant.) There is even a large couch and sitting area in the restroom so you can go sit there and enjoy some free rosé while you're waiting on your table. To avoid a wait, I would definitely make a reservation. The food is all delicious. I've tried a large variety of it. The grilled cheese dumplings with tomato soup is a classic that you will not regret. The lobster Mac and cheese is absolutely fabulous topped with crispy bread crumbs and so much cheese. The burger and fries are also good for a larger more filling portion that's a less expensive option. The other pastas are also good as well as the tuna tacos, bone marrow, and oysters. You'll have to try their cocktails as well. The Beauty Elixir is one of their most popular and the perfect sweet pink cocktail for GNO. I love going here with a bunch of my girlfriends, and it's always the best time. Dinner and brunch are fantastic. The restaurant is decently pricey, and portions are not that big especially if you're ordering the appetizers. But it's really fun to just share with the table and order a bunch of different things to try. The waiter will probably encourage you to order more plates than you'd think to share...you can usually get one or two less than they say especially if you choose some of the more carb-y filling dishes (like pasta or burger).

The brisket, short rib, & lamb worked well together and was placed on a bun that wouldn't back down! The BBQ fries were hot and seasoned. My GF enjoye her spaghettini and said it was more filling than she thought it would be. The portions are tapa sized so I can see why, I saw one table split a Spaghettini into thirds. The food turnaround was fast, possibly the fastest I've ever had any fine dining retaurant turnaround our order.

It's pretty and the tapas style makes it easy for sharing.I've been here before with a girlfriend and again last night with the hubby. The food is pretty good but not dream or crave worthy. The drinks are okay but it seems to try too hard to be special and elevated but it's nowhere on the same level as say, Employees Only.We had the Crab Rangoon and Grilled Cheese with Tomato soup to start with. You can't really go wrong with good crab or grilled cheese and soup so they were good but not impressive. We also had the Baby Back Ribs with hush puppies and Spaghettini. The ribs were fried which took my hubby from Texas by surprise but it was still pretty good. He enjoyed the hush puppies with butter but not sure if he'd return for the dish. The spaghettini was pretty good but not great. We wished the egg yoke was less cooked but then again- we're comparing it to dishes from ABC Kitchen and Herb Saint in New Orleans.We had a number of cocktails like Beauty Elixir and ODB. All were OKAY but none were really good. It seemed like the bartenders tried too hard to concoct something original and praise worthy but ended up falling short of achieving their goals. I suggest they go to Employees Only to see how cocktails should be done.Anyhow- all in all not a bad experience but  considering the place isn't that cheap, one can't help but compare it to other places that's worth the money and return visit.Another note- I didn't like that they asked for ID in the bathroom in order to get a champagne. I'm 38 and I'm clearly over 21. Who goes to the bathroom with ID unless they're on their way in or out??And the music was extremely obnoxious. It was Monday night and they were playing club music from 10+ years ago. I understand some people may like throwback music from yesteryear to sing along to but it was a bit too loud and clubbish for a Monday night. The music alone takes it from chic to douchey.

My next dish, their ribs was also very good. The ribs had been smoked well and fell right off the bone. I was very impressed especially considering that this isn't a rib place. My brother ordered the jerk chicken which he wasn't a huge fan of. The panna cotta was also really delicious and had just the right texture. Service: the service was excellent right up until the very end. One of my pet peeves is wait staff who take the check before I leave the table and the waitress did so.

I came here for restaurant week with the hopes of stuffing my face while keeping it classy. As soon as you walk in you see a really cool guitar shop with other various jewelry like rings and costume jewelry, really vintage and totally NYC. Getting a reservation here is tough so I had to do it on opentable two weeks in advance , but when we arrived earlier then expected we were seated right away.  This place has several floors , felt like I was in a glamorous mansion with the high ceilings, beautiful murals and art on the wall, comfy couches like a separate lounge area to drink , tons of gorgeous crystal chandeliers . Even the bathroom was fancy with an attendant , all marble everything  with pretty mirrors and a separate bar and lounge area for some champagne while you wait . As far as the food goes , the restaurant week menu had really nice options like poblano empanadas , eggplant flatbread , followed by dry rubbed ribs , salmon , jerk chicken , or spaghetti made of zoodles and eggs on top, the dessert also has fresh pana cotta or mini cupcakes . We both decided to get the empanadas which had tons of flavor and were really cute , it has a zesty sauce on top and it was crispy and filling . They also gave us complimentary beet crackers I loved how light they were . My dish of choice was the spaghettini which had lots of fresh herbs , a huge pile of green and regular pasta , and a fried egg on top which really complimented the dish , it was super filling and very unique since it was zesty . The pork ribs are to die for , they came right off the bone and were seasoned right and not too fatty , the hush puppies also had nice seasoning with a peppercorn butter dip , excellent portion. Oh and the alcohol was strong AF, two lemon drop martinis had me twisted and my bf Captain Morgan was very dark and strong . For dessert we both opted for the petite cupcakes which were so cute in terms of presentation , the red velvet with fresh cream cheese and edible pearls was so delicious , and the chocolate ones were moist . The staff here is really nice too , the waiter was patient and knew the whole menu by heart , security is all around to prevent any drama or arguments since it's such a busy hotspot . Everything was served fast and I really treated like royalty . I would come back here to try the rest of the regular menu or to even have drinks in the lounge, this place is beautiful .",7,3,7,Michelle C.,"Brooklyn, NY",880,417,506

5.0,8/19/2016,"Came here with a fairly large birthday group on a Tuesday and the place was as lively as a Friday night. Of course the main draw of this place is the pawn shop entrance that leads you to the dark and glamorous restaurant. You can buy items from the shop but this night my friends as I were more concerned about food and drinks. A few girls from our party were late so we had to wait for them to arrive but were seated fairly quickly after everyone was there. It was restaurant week, so we all ordered three courses and a few bottles of wine. We were all pleasantly surprised to find that free champagne is served in the bathroom. Everyone loved their dishes. I had the jerk chicken which came with polenta and was delicious. Sure this is one of the more expensive places around but the prices aren't really that bad for a place that gives you great food and a unique experience.

We had the tuna poke tacos (the taco shell tasted dry and the tuna not fresh), the salmon.. Wayyyyy too much vinegar and lemon on the Swiss chard.. Overpowering and left me with an awful belly ache afterward. My husband had the jet pressed chicken. The polenta made the dish but otherwise wellBelow average. We also had the crab Rangoon toast which was NOT worth $17!!! Way overpriced, food lacked flavor and maybe since it was a Sunday.. The seafood really didn't taste fresh.

I wasn't expecting that but I was impressed. So they get two stars because of this but I doubt I'll come back. There were too many things that were wrong, I was expecting a meal but was completely fooled by the size of their foods. I guess I missed the memo that it was a small plates place (and by small I mean really small) and if it was at least good then I'd be okay with it but it was simply okay. I'm a foot enthusiast so getting cold grilled cheese dumplings in tomato soup was a turn off. So come here, for the experience but stick to the bar or go to the lounge and just drink.

3.0,8/13/2016,"My fiancé and I went here yesterday with a couple of his friends who live in New York. It was the first time for all of us. I have to admit, I had high hopes and was expecting delicious food. We went during restaurant week and for $42 you got a 3 course meal: appetizer, main course and dessert.  My fiancé and I both chose tuna poke for the appetizer. He had the baby back ribs and I had grilled salmon for our main dish. For dessert we chose a raspberry pane-cotta and chocolate hazelnut truffles. The Tuna poke was excellent. We each had three and the poke was stuff inside a wonton taco shell. Our main course was where it went south... His ribs were too salty and one piece was so salty, he wasn't able to eat it. My salmon was over cooked and dry. The dessert was ok... But nothing exceptional. The ambience was unique... You enter through a pawn shop, and as the door opens the restaurant appears. It is very trendy hot spot. I think there was probably a 4:1 ratio of women to men. A lot of really dressed up women here. It appears this is a single girls hang out spot. Also the music was so loud it was impossible to have a conversation in there. One perk however is that there is free champagne in the ladies bathroom. Unfortunately... They ran out of clean flutes so even though I went to the bathroom twice... I was only able to get champagne the first time. Overall... I would not return again.

When we went into the pawn shop, you can imagine my confusion like ummm where are we going? Then when you open up the ""secret"" door, you're basically transported into a whole new world. It's almost like a little great gatsby feel and just huge and beautiful.  The drink menu was extensive but the food is what really stole the show. If you go there, you HAVE TO get the cheese and bacon dumplings in a tomato sauce. My friend got the eggs benedict which wasn't too shabby, the eggs were perfect.

So why not 5 stars?  Well, 4-1/2 isn't an option or that's what I would give.  I'd give 5 because it was damn close to perfect - but the fries were a little too spicy for my taste and the ac was a bit high so I was cold (Thats really something, as I am usually sweating when it's 70 degrees).  But lesson learned - next time I'll get a different side and bring a jacket.  And there will definitely be a next time.",0,0,0,Heidi S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,12,0

The Decor: beautiful, lavish, romanticThe service: we were well taken care of. Waiter came by to take our orders promptly and refill our water multiple times throughout the night. We were there for a few hours and did not feel rushed even though it got busy later on The food: we ordered most of the RW menu. Appetizers - we tried the poke tuna tacos (soooo good we played ""guess the number"" to compete for the last one), empenadas (a little soggy, lacking in flavor, not the best one), and the eggplant pizette (couldn't really taste the eggplant but had a nice sauce to cheese ratio, which I always appreciate. Really big for an appetizer and definitely able to split between 5 people) ---If you had to pick one, go with the tuna tacos, then the pizette, then maybe order the kale and apple saladMains/Entrées - We ordered the speghetini (flavorful pesto with a pleasant lemony zing to round off the dish - really good), baby back ribs (5 ribs each - hefty portion. Well seasoned and charred to add the extra flavor. Fall-off the bone tender and meaty. Delicious!), and the salmon (tender, lightly seasoned, and flaky). --- If you had to pick, the baby back ribs and speghetini were both exceptional. The salmon was good, just not significantly different than the typical salmon dish from other places.Dessert - We ordered the cupcakes (cute, moist, and yummy little bites), pana cota (so creamy and well balanced with the fruit gelatin layer on top), and chocolate (don't remember the name - rich, smooth, and full of great textural contrast with the pop rocks and rice krispies). --- If you had to pick, the chocolates and pana cota are tied.

They can also alter the alter the menu for you to accommodate dietary restrictions.They pass out glow sticks and light up rings to light up in the dark and get the party going.FYI, Bathroom is a troop and is located all the way down 2 levels!To celebrate your birthday and make it extra special they come out all hyped, with sparklers and a sign with your name on it.

We ordered a few things off the menu, we started with the Lobster Tacos, Chicken Meatballs, and Grilled Cheese Dumplings. All were pretty good, we could've done without the Lobster Tacos, they were very small and they didn't really include much lobster in them at all.

The sauce was well done covering nice chunks of shrimps which were not really deep fried (more like a good sear). The pan seared scallops was also delicious, too bad it only came with 3 pieces. The baby back ribs were literally fall off the bone tender. They paired well with the onion rings. The lobster mac and cheese was missing the lobster, not a memorable dish.I've heard about the free champagne in the ladies room before but it's totally a different experience in person.

I typically dine at smaller restaurants so Beauty & Essex initially shocked my senses in its pure size. It's glitzy and glam and extravagant and massive and beautiful and really anything that a girl could want. And I guess this as good a time as any to mention that this is the PERFECT spot for a girl's night out (contingent on all party members' willingness to shell out more cash than they typically would at a bar/restaurant). Before diving into my experience, here's why large groups of girls flock to this place:-Everyone here dresses up. Fancy dresses, high heels, lots of sparkles. Who doesn't like to feel pretty?-The drink menu isn't spirit-forward. I happen to love spirit-forward drinks but most of my girlfriends don't-The menu (much more on that later) is set up such that all plates are meant to be shared. Not only that, a good number of the dishes (at least those that are appetizer-sized) are on the lighter side. So you likely won't feel grossly full after eating here-The luxury makes its way into the bathrooms too. Bathroom attendants, couches and free champagne. Let me repeat: FREE CHAMPAGNE. So if you're waiting to be seated/on your way out, get some bubbly and rejoice in the fact that it's so, so free. So now onto our experience. We came here on a Saturday night for a late dinner and as expected, the place was packed. After helping ourselves to some of that complimentary champagne, we moved onto the good stuff at our table. We both started out with the Pink Panther (gin, St. Germain, pink peppercorn syrup, lemon), which is a fantastic first drink. Fresh and wonderfully-balanced. My second drink, The Woodsman (bourbon, allspice dram, maple syrup, lemon, muddled pears), was wildly different from the Pink Panther but just as good. Sometimes I'm wary of bourbon/maple syrup cocktails because when the ratios are off, they can turn out sickly sweet. Thankfully not the case here. A note about the menu before I jump in: I want to reiterate that these are small plates. They suggest 4-6 as most tapas sports do, but these portions are smaller than most. Typically me and one other person will order 4-5 and end up pretty full. On this particular night we had nothing left over after ordering 5. I do think we ordered some of the lighter dishes, but you should still keep this in mind when assessing your hunger level. Eats below: Salmon Ceviche w/ jalapeño, mango, crispy corn tortilla: A-Fresh and incredibly flavorful. The jalapeño adds a pop of spice here which paired nicely with the mango. You get three in an order and they're virtually impossible to split so keep that in mind when ordering. A yummy summer dish and a great way to start off our meal. And *beautiful* preparation.Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos w/ micro cilantro, radish, wasabi kewpie: AAlso 3 to an order. So if you're a party of two, it works out well if you order both this and the ceviche. As long as you don't have the same favorite one, you'll be able to avoid all tension. But most likely, someone will have to concede, because these tacos were just better than the ceviche. Poke is all the rage these days, and for good reason. It's fresh, healthy and you can do tons of fun preparations with it. That wasabi on top is bomb.Hand Cut Steak Tartare w/Swedish pickled beets, anchovy crème fraiche, mustard dill rice cake: AThis dish is different. Unlike any steak tartare I've had in the past. For some reason it took us both a minute to decide whether or not we liked it. Once my tastebuds assessed the situation, they were very pleased. It might've been the anchovy creme fraiche that threw me, but once I adjusted, I thought it actually made the dish. Crab Rangoon w/ warm jumbo lump crab, sweet thai chili pearls, crispy crab cracker: A+The star of the night. Though we were expecting toast as opposed to another set of little tortilla/cracker bases, this dish was a total flavor explosion. It's hard to beat succulent lump crab. Serious mastery over the 1-2 bite dish here. This dish also came with three pieces but we managed to split the last magnificent morsel between the two of us (we also saved it for last).'Chile Relleno' Empanadas w/ poblano, manchego, jalapeño-lime crema: AYet another flavor bomb. 4 perfectly crispy empanadas, lots of drool-worthy manchego, spiciness from the pepper with a dollop of light crema on top to balance it out. Nice antidote to all of our seafood.",8,7,7,Molly T.,"New York, NY",887,463,1480
4.0,7/16/2016,"When I came here it was packed and everyone was wearing their best. This is definitely the place you want to go to if its a special occasion. The decor alone is great for pictures. We were told to go upstairs where we sat in the couch lounge area adjacent from the bar. I had the chicken meatballs which were really delicious. One thing I definitely remember was the service. It was packed by the time we were done eating when two girls approached us and saw that we were just done with our meal, waiting for the bill. I told them sure sit next to us we're leaving now. And the manager swooped in and told them that the table was reserved and that they need to wait. I told him its really okay, but I think that was nice of him.",0,0,0,Amika N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,98,1

Tomato soup/ grilled cheese spoons were the best by far but nothing amazing.",0,0,0,Sarah S.,"Tampa, FL",1,11,3
5.0,7/13/2016,"Beauty & Essex is THE perfect spot for great food and drinks! We went to Beauty & Essex for a friend's bachelorette party on a Saturday night. The entrance is a pawn shop (very kitchy and full of character). The restaurant itself is beautiful! Chandeliers everywhere, amazing decor! Our waiter (Bryan?) was so sweet and was so attentive. The food and drinks were so wonderful! For 6 girls, we ordered 12 dishes (food is served tapas style, so it's normal to order a bunch of dishes to share) and tried many of the cocktails. I would say my favorites were the spaghettini, grilled cheese dumpling with tomato soup, salmon ceviche, and the lobster tacos. The drinks were outstanding...you could really taste the fruits/vegetables! We also got a complimentary beet concoction on a cracker and the duck chilaquiles. Both very delicious! For dessert, we got the butterscotch dish and the box of donuts. So wonderful and more than enough for us girls. Since it was a special occasion, we got complimentary shots of chocolate cake liquor! Another wonderful and kind of unknown fact is that they serve pink champagne in the women's bathroom in the basement. The bathroom itself is so classy and swanky, with vanity mirrors along the middle of the room and comfy couches in the corner. The pink champagne was the cherry on top. Such a wonderful thing to offer to diners. What restaurant serves free champagne in NYC? Nowhere :)The price was so affordable (considering how much food and drinks we ordered). At the end of the night, Bryan? asked us what we were doing later that night and we were going to do karaoke but he said that if we wanted, he had spoken to his manager and they had a table reserved for us in the upstairs lounge. We decided to go up to the lounge for a little bit and then head to karaoke but that didn't happen because we spent the rest of the night in this amazing lounge! The lounge is beautiful! There's a huge pearl chandelier in the middle of the room and features various shades of pink all over the lounge. Bryan? got us another round of shots, which definitely kicked off another part of an amazing night! We tried more cocktails (which were all so good and very strong) and danced by our table. There's also an iPad in the pawn shop where you can take fun videos with your friends and email to yourself to remind everyone how much fun you had here!Beauty & Essex is great for a girls night out or just hanging out casually. The food/drinks and ambiance makes you feel like you're not even in NYC. It truly is an experience you should definitely try!",1,0,0,Jennifer C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,39,4

5.0,7/7/2016,"My bf and I found this chic restaurant while we walking around in the lower east side. The real restaurant is hidden behind a thrift store, and you need to pass through the secret entrance to get in. The ambiance is definitely gorgeous.

5.0,7/2/2016,"Jaysus. Can tapas get any better? The answer is no. If you're hesitating on whether or not to go, please just do yourself a tremendous favor and book the reservation. Just go for it. Trust me, your taste buds will thank you. ----Anyway, I went here on a whim with my friends after a recommendation from a coworker. It was so good that I couldn't wait to go back to work (hahhhh - no, but srsly, I was actually excited to talk to my coworker. Nvm the whole working bit though) to tell my coworker how thankful I am. IT WAS SO DAMN GOOD. My friends and I ordered a bunch of dishes (we have an issue with dish management - oops) and they were ALL good. How is that even possible? I mean sure, there were one or two were I was like ehh it's not as good as the others, BUT they were still pretty darn good. ONTO THE FOOD :DWe ordered the tuna tacos (nom nom delicious, please order it), bone marrow (yesss, so good), tomato soup dumplings (this was alright for me but my friend enjoyed it), lobster mac and cheese (this was yummy but I think it wasn't something mindblowing - more of a dish to order if you ran out of things you want to try), scallops (ORDER THIS. I've never seen such big scallops. I loved them), and the bone-in rib eye (yess, I love meat and it was cooked just right). For dessert, we went with the box of donuts (omg beignets - my weakness) which was SO DAMN GOOD so it's a must try. And because we're fatasses, we decided to also order some peanut butter chocolate mousse which was alright - it was a little salty after a few bites but it was an interesting contrast. But if you're stuck between that mousse and the beignets, pick the beignets. Don't make me side-eye you through this review for not picking the beignets. ONTO THE SERVICE :DI loved that everything was portioned out to fit my party. I'm not sure if this is a normal occurrence, but somehow everyone in my three-person party was allowed at least two pieces on each plate. Basically, they made sure we never had to play that awkward game of ""who gets the last piece???"" Loved that. Aside from the food, the ambiance and environment was lovely. I loved the decor and low-key attentive waiters (I always love places where the servers know how to act attentive without being impossibly overbearing). My friends and I felt completely welcomed and not rushed throughout the whole experience. It just made me love this place even more. Definitely will becoming back. ------If you're all like omg, TL;DR: 5/5 for food, decor, service. If that doesn't convince you to try this place, I don't know what would.P.S. Don't be confused when you first walk through the door of a vintage shop. I was so lost when I came in that I had to double-check the sign before cautiously stepping in LOL.

Look no further than Beauty & Essex. All the dishes were exceptional, cocktails too. Sadly, another thing that was exceptional were the prices- we were a party of seven eating dinner and drinking cocktails. For that type of meal, expect to be shelling out half a month's rent. Drinks and food are typical New York City prices (maybe a little more,) but tapas-style means you have to get a bunch and it all adds up very quickly. It's definitely a special occasion type of place. You could just go for the cocktails, but the food was all unique and a real stand-out. They can also accommodate for vegans.

The decor is fab and when you have guests out of town it's a unique place when you have to go through a pawn shop to get to the restaurant, it reminds you of an old secret speakeasy. The food is full of flavor and extremely interesting, drinks are strong. The service was polite and were always there to top up drinks.The only reason I gave a minus 1 star, is because our waitress was a bit too pushy. She advised us to get another main, as basically you get a load of dishes and pick n mix and share with your friends/family. Me and my mum don't eat that much of big meals so we said no, and had to deny her 4/5 times saying it's ok no more thank you and she was still persistent we would be hungry. Low and behold we ended up leaving food, and both of the men were full. Plus you want to leave room for dessert and more drinks. I understand maybe it's her job to get more but we ordered a total of 7 plates between four people so it's not like it wasn't a lot. So it got a little annoying/uncomfortable.

Everything was quite tasty, even the kale salad which I really doubted. While the food is described as ""tapas"" size, the servings were actually quite large, and the food itself was quite heavy. Two appetizers and two entrees were far too much food for us, and I was so sad that I didn't have room for the even more amazing sounding dessert.

As I approached the bar upstairs to order, a man seated there suddenly puked onto the floor, and it splashed all over my strappy leather sandals and feet. Literally the most disgusting restaurant experience I've ever had, and I fault the establishment for this occurrence. Whether they served this man til he was excessively intoxicated or not, the fact is that it's easy to spot someone who is THAT drunk and he should have been ejected. He literally was face down on he bar, and the bartenders and management did nothing. Like what kind of staff overlooks this, and at a super upscale restaurant? Such a joke. We only stayed to dine because our friends from South Carolina were visiting and specifically asked to go here, otherwise I never would have spent money here after my experience.

Some people were really dressed up (cocktail dresses and heels) and some were really dressed down (jeans and sneakers), kinda awkward. The fried chicken on a biscuit & BBQ fries were sooo good! Virgin Garnet gimlet was also yummy & sweet. Empanadas were nothing special and the Mac n cheese with lobster hardly had any cheese. We noticed a huge pearl chandelier on their 2nd floor so we went to see it before leaving but it was a totally different vibe up there! It looked like a bunch of sweaty high schoolers who were drinking alcohol for the first time got in with their fake IDs. Some were dancing then falling off chairs in their heels, others were struggling to stand up and most were spilling their drink all over the place (not exaggerating). Everyone was packed in like sardines so we left right away lolMight come back for the food, definitely will avoid the lounge upstairs like it's the Zika virus.",1,1,1,Sahra T.,"Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ",63,42,263
1.0,6/5/2016,"Being a restaurant manager myself, I forgive a lot of restaurants mistakes, but not this place.  Only after asking twice about our 10:30pm reservations 45 minutes late were we rudely thrown a drink card to compensate. Then we finally sit, next to a speaker that is blasting so hard & loud, it was worse then a concert.  The manager says, smirking, sorry nothing we can do.  I find that very hard to believe, it's a knob you turn down or move us.  She gave no solution, not what a good manager would've down.The hostess' better than everyone attitude is obnoxious.  You're seating people, not curing cancer.  Smile maybe, say sorry sincerely.Needless to say, we left, leaving a $20 for the server (not her fault, she was very pleasant) & took off before ordering so I can't say if the food was good. I wouldn't have been able to enjoy it in that atmosphere.",4,3,0,Candace M.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",91,29,45

Downstairs is mostly where the dinner area is, but you can also enjoy a lounge and bar too. Upstairs is where the dancing area, bigger bar, and bottle service groups are, and everybody seemed to be having a good time. There is also a dinner area upstairs, I believe. Decor is really nice. Staff is amiable and the crowd seems varied to me which I enjoyed: not trying too hard and not too good not to try at all. Great music too. Not drinking these days but seems to have a good selection.

5.0,6/4/2016,"Another amazing brunch spot in NYC, no surprise as they are sibling to ""The Stanton Social."" The restaurant is gorgeous and the vibe is fun and upbeat. Cocktails were great and strong, which I love. Similar to Stanton, food is served tapas style 5 dishes recommended per couple. I love that they course out the meal so that you never end up with an overcrowded table. My favorite dish here is definitely the grilled cheese tomato soup dumplings. Little cheese stuffed dumplings individually served in tomato soup filled spoons- absolutely DIVINE! Moving along, the lobster and chorizo hash are a perfect side to accompany your meal. (I am guilty of stealing every last piece of chorizo from the bowl- shhhh.) In addition, we had the chicken meatballs, braised short rib huevos rancheros, chilaquiles, and pancakes.

3.0,6/2/2016,"This is the type of place that you have to be into in order to enjoy. And I think that a relatively narrow crowd of people would enjoy the vibe. I went on a Sunday afternoon and encountered a full fledge dance party complete with short tight dresses and sky high heels. I don't hate on anyone who can rock sky high heels - in fact I am quite impressed - so that isn't a con, but once again you have to be into it. The music was good and it looked like a good time. On a different day I might have been into it but on that day I was looking for something more low key to catch up with a friend from high school so we ended up leaving. The decor/ atmosphere was pretty upscale but I cannot vouch for the food or drinks. Service wise, it wasn't the greatest. I had never been there before and wasn't familiar with the setup and the there wasn't much guidance. We finally asked someone if we can get a table and they said talk to someone else who eventually told us they were in between brunch and dinner but we could order from a limited menu but no one ever came to take our order.

5.0,5/30/2016,I wish I could give it more stars! Yelp did it again! Some restaurants have ambiance and some have good food. This one has BOTH! It looks like nothing when you walk up but it is a serious WOW! When you first walk in there is a super cute jewelry case with some fantastic jewelry pieces so make sure you stop and take a look!Then you enter the restaurant and the smell of the food literally overwhelms you. The chandeliers and decor really set the mood and felt so chic. We sat in the main dining room under the gorgeous oversized skylight and the view was beautiful. Now for the food....oh my god the food!! We started with some light apps. Trust me when I tell you ORDER THE GRILLED CHEESE BACON AND TOMATO SOUP DUMPLINGS! Seriously the explosion of flavor was out of this world!! We also got the kale and apple salad (amaaaazing flavor!) and the tuna sashimi ( so fresh! If you don't like spicy though this isn't for you)For our main dishes we ordered not one but two orders of the baby back ribs. Holy bomba! Fall off the bone delishhhhh. They come with hush puppies and this dipping sauce that reminded me of a creamsicle. So different but so good!Chicken meatballs!! SUCH good flavor! The cheese and the truffle tasted like heaven. Spaghettini this was probably my least favorite if I had to choose but it was still very good. A very clean fresh flavor. So then i went down to the bathroom and had no idea what I was about to walk into! The women's bathroom legit has a champagne bar and lounge in the bathroom! Whaaat! Oh and no big deal but there's a chandelier over each toilet! I've never felt more fabulous!Absolutely do not leave before going upstairs and checking out the bar! Honestly this place is a 10!

My favorite was the candied bacon.

4.0,5/29/2016,"It's the LES speakeasy that isn't really a speakeasy. ""Hidden"" behind a thrift shop, this multiple-story throwback bar/restaurant is one of those places in New York where you have to step up your fashion game a little more. It gets yuppie up in here though. The vibes can be too much of a scene to hang.The cocktails are good but pricey ($20 each). They're less craft and more run of the mill but the flavors are solid and the alcohol content is pretty high. The food is above average but with the tapa like structure, be prepared to share and order more things (aka drop more cash). I recommend the tomato soup dumplings, which are superior to Stanton Social's.I recommend stopping in at least once.

It's on a side street in the Lower East Side, very conveniently placed (though parking was a bummer due to construction when I went.) I loved entering through the pawn shop, some might've found it strange but I thought it was intriguing! The restaurant itself is so beautiful and elegant and we were seated almost immediately. Our waitor was knowledgable about the menu and made lots of helpful suggestions. Our food arrived fast and it was delicious. Grilled Cheese Dumplings in Tomato Soup:Better than they sound. A lot better. I wasn't too sure about ordering them but I'm so glad I did - they were INSANELY delicious. You 100% have to get themLemon Blackberry Pancakes w/ Ricotta:Also really really ridiculously good. Highly recommended as wellChicken Meatballs:Really good, just a very small serving.Chile Relleno Empanadas:By far my favorite item on the menu. Bursting with flavor in every bite, even the crust. If I could eat one thing for the rest of my life, I'd probably choose these. My only complaint is that they're SOOO small, and when something tastes that good, they deserve to be much much bigger.After we ate, we went upstairs to, I guess it was a club? I don't know, but there was a bar and a DJ and people were dancing, so I'll call it a club. They were handing out light up rings and glow sticks, which was fun and nostalgic. We only stayed up there for a few minutes but it was very memorable.The only complaint I have is that the empanadas were ridiculously small, but other than that, this place was amazing.

2.0,5/23/2016,"I came here with a group of friends for a bachelorette dinner on a Thursday at 8pm. We were visiting NYC from Nashville and had made the reservation 1 month in advance. After checking in right on time and being told our table would be ready soon, we were still unseated at 8:45pm. When we inquired about the delay, we were told there was a large party upstairs delaying all reservations. We explained we had a show to attend at 10pm and this delay could compromise our plans. We were told there was nothing they could do, and we'd be seated when the large party left. We were finally seated at 9:20pm, nearly 1.5 hours after our reservation time. We were given a complimentary round of drinks after speaking with a manager, however we still missed our 10pm show which was quite disappointing. Once seated, the food was very good - we had the raviolis, zucchini pasta, meatballs, broccolini, burgers, and BBQ fries. Cocktails were tasty as well.

3.0,5/23/2016,"I gave this place 5 stars based solely on its speak easy theme and gatsby decor. Unfortunately, the food has brought it down to 3 stars. The food was very delicious, but extremely small portions. When looking at the prices, you think the place isn't expensive, until you get your plate of food. Their Tuna Poke Wanton Taco was really to die for and very fresh and delicious, but again, a very small portion. Comes with 3 tiny tuna tartar filled tacos. The Herb Ricotta Ravioli was also very delicious and not heavy on the cream; but the size ruined it all. There was literally 6 small pieces of ravioli that didn't even satisfy my hunger one bit. I found myself licking the plate clean wanting more, and not because it was outrageously delicious and I was being my usual ""fat ass"". We also got their Flash Seared Tuna. Once again, very yummy, soft, and fresh. But the perfect sized portion for an appetizer, not a main entrée. Due to their small portions, we ended up ordering two desserts. We got their Devils Food Layer Cake and a Box of Doughnuts. The Devils cake was very delicious and filed with this very delicious marscapone filling and ice cream on the side, but not as moist as expected when having Devils food cake. There was also A LOT of crunch due to an excess amount of sugar. I felt like I was getting a new cavity with each bite I took. The same goes for the doughnuts. They were so delicious, they were either filled with Nutella or a raspberry jam. But the sugar ruined it all. Each doughnut was layered with this extremely thick layer of sugar, so thick to the point you couldn't taste the actual doughnut or filling itself. I had to sit there, with my fingers, and take the sugar off. Which resulted in a huge mess. All in all, really really beautiful hip ""speak easy"" place.

We tried the beauty elixir it was really good! We also ordered the BBQ fries- they were packed with flavor!Next we had the mushroom crusted sea scallops with potatoes. The scallops were so nice and tender and flavorful. The mashed potatoes that come with it were divine! We also ordered the chicken meatballs. I think those weren't the best I think it should be paired with something other than the truffle sauce. For dessert I had the strawberry shortcake with pistachio ice cream. I loved the warm and cold mix! The ice cream was delicious! My friend had the white chocolate and rhubarb selection. That was actually my favorite. The interior of the restaurant is a bit dark but sultry. It has a very sexy feel to it. This is a great place for GNO or even date night!

Showed up on time and took a cab all the way from FiDi to make sure we weren't late, after 15 minutes of waiting I asked the hostess who said our table was about to be ready. Finally after sitting there for 30 minutes after our reservation, I asked again to which the hostess said that the group at 'our table' was eating dessert. I worked at restaurants in the past, and a certain table is NOT just designated for a reservation if the place is packed. If any table becomes available, you give it to the next reservation, and we watched plenty of groups be seated with no reservation. I was about to leave but thought I'd give it a few more minutes and I asked the manager if he could help. He said yes and that he'd be back, waited ten more minutes and he didn't return. Literally ruined our entire night and my boyfriend's day which was supposed to be special. We ended up being so bummed about it that we just went home since we were so excited to try this place.

4.0,5/17/2016,"The last time I had come here in a large group for weekend brunch and hadn't really liked the experience as much and I confess it was in large part the company I was with at the time . . .  I was taken here as an initiation brunch by a bunch of girls led by what I can only describe as the grown up version of Regina in ""Mean Girls"" . . . no joke.  We ended up voting on which dishes we would order with the majority ruling though I recall the ""Regina"" in the group had a big say in terms of everything we did.  Being solicited after the champagne brunch shortly after this event by the Regina did not help my experience.  This time I was there with a close and nice girlfriend and it was a much better brunch experience.  The beauty of Beauty & Essex is the almost speakeasy like entrance of the pawn shop in front which hides a door to a lovely restaurant within, which looks like a nice trendy Manhattan brunch spot.  And I say lovely because it is excessively girly.  This is definitely a co-ed or all girl's kind of place though.  You will not find a table of men here.  Now that I have brunched what feels like every nook and cranny of Manhattan, I can more objectively say this is a four star brunch experience.  I like the sky light.  It gives it an airy open feel on a nice day.  If you have some say in what you order like I did this time, it makes for a better experience.  Amongst the two of us, we ended up getting four tapas dishes per the recommendation of the waitress.  That included something sweet (donut like), something savory (the dumplings), something with egg (the frittata), and the fried chicken dish which came highly recommended by the waitress.  All this with coffee and orange juice and no champagne. It was the perfect amount of food actually and on the good side.Definitely check out the bathroom while you are there.  It is unique is all I'll say.  I don't know if I'll be back having been twice already and my habit of always wanting to check new places out, but I would recommend others to brunch here, especially if they are girls and visiting the city and do want a really ""New York"" experience.",0,1,1,Christine N.,"Manhattan, NY",138,374,294
4.0,5/16/2016,"We enjoyed this restaurant/bar very much for a night out with the girls.  The environment was very beautiful, especially upstairs, with a glamorous chandelier, and atmospheric rooms.  The food menu (though a bit ""comfort food"" for my taste) was unexpectedly tasty for a place with the emphasis on the bar scene.  We are in our 40's, and although the typical 10:30 dinner patron was younger, consistent with the lower east side neighborhood, we felt very comfortable.  I particularly appreciated that you could have dinner and take in the music and bar scene while still being able to sit at your dinner table in the adjacent area and have a conversation and cocktails with one another; I would recommend a later dinner seating in order to allow you to do that after dinner without their needing to turn the table.  Waiters switched over during our desert course, and although the first was fine, the second was inattentive.  While the cocktails are decent, Beauty & Essex does not have the same emphasis on quality craft cocktails as other speakeasy places like Raines Law Room.  Beauty & Essex is a large, lively establishment, and fake pawn shop entrance aside, it's more a restaurant/club than it is a speakeasy.  That said, it's an attractive, fun place, and unlike many smaller speakeasies, you can actually get in--with a reservation, provided you are eating something.  As someone who is past the phase in life of waiting in line for admission to any bar, that's a big plus in my book.  Glam yourself up, go and enjoy the evening!",0,0,0,Heather M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,9,0

I'm not a huge fan of peppers, but everyone else liked them- Thai Style Deep-Fried Shrimp: Favorite dish of the night. The shrimp were large, nice crisp exterior and really good sauce. Highly recommend!- Braised Short Ribs: I was getting really full at this point, but of the small bite I ate, the meat was tender. Also, the mushroom risotto under it was bomb.- Mushroom Crusted Sea Scallops: Cooked perfectly, but it was your average delicious scallop- BBQ Fries: Must get! These fries surprised me. I don't normally like BBQ flavored things, but these had such a good flavor- Box of Doughnuts: Comes with 2 flavors (chocolate & raspberry). Go for the chocolate.- Melon Mojito: A little too sweet & could have used more mint - The Woodsman: Good It was pricey, but for a once-in-a-while-night-out kind of thing, I would definitely recommend!",1,0,0,Angela T.,"San Francisco, CA",246,94,117
5.0,5/5/2016,"First of all this place is a must....their tag line should be ""business in the front and party in the back"". Because after all it is in the back of a pawn shop. Rose served in the women's bathroom with couches available was a nice touch! We decided to eat tapas style which was recommended by the waiter and we loved it. For 3 people they suggested 7 small plates which was the perfect amount. The salmon ceviche, grilled cheese and tomato soup shooters, and the mashed cauliflower definitely topped our list. Cocktails were delish! And we had to finish with dessert which also did not disappoint.

Now, that it's ""little less popular"" it's easier to book, but still a great night out.  I really have to try to talk myself out of coming here every time I'm in the city.  It's so much fun!Food/Drinks:Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings (my favorite dish - everyone loves this dish - it's such a pleasant surprise and been great since the beginning. If you have more than two people or more than one - trust me!), Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos, Chipotle Duck Chilaquiles (good, but can get a little soggy), Lobster Tacos (one of my favorite dishes - battered lobster, simply prepared but very good), Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs (one of my least favorite items that I've tried, but my husband loves this dish- sheeps milk ricotta, wild mushroom, truffle)Drinks - Beauty Elixir, The Woodsman (balanced), Electric Avenue (boozy), The Bajan (my husband's favorite drink) Atmosphere:This place exudes sexiness!  Even after several years since it opened, it's still has a trendy, sexy crowd out for a fabulous night.  I love the people watching, when I'm not too busy dancing in my seat! Which leads me to the MUSIC!  The Music is off the chain.  They play an amazing mix, but mostly hip hop and R&B.  It's like going to a nightclub, but having a seat and good food.  I love it and wish we had something like this in Chicago or even more options in NYC.  Service:Can be spotty, but has gotten better since it's a little less crazy to book. It doesn't bother me as long as I don't have to wait too long for my table (less than 15-20 mins - while I have a drink at the bar), b/c I'm so busy enjoying the music and drinks.Overall, B&E was good food, not amazing, but good.  The reason for the 5 stars is, I really believe they are one of the best to do it for a fun/lively dinner.",2,0,0,Christina T.,"Chicago, IL",22,97,363

A side of cauliflower and cheese was dire. Music was excellent (we both liked it - how rare is that), and the place filled up to capacity after we were seated which made for a fun ambiance. Our lovely waiter kindly delivered a surprise cupcake with dessert, which was nice and low-key. Loved the boozy treat in the ladies' room.

It's all mouth-watering. We loved the grill cheese and tomato soup samplers, the tomato and quail eggs, the short ribs, and the empanadas. My least favorite, actually, was the chicken meatballs. Although they were very good. But for $27, I've had better meatballs. The drinks were DIVINE. I might add that I am 7.5 months pregnant and ordered virgin drinks (Garnet Gimli YUM!!). And the thing that MOST impressed me is that I was treated with such caring and respect. The maitré d brought me a memory foam pillow from SOMEWHERE in the establishment, that kept me so incredibly comfortable on the wood chairs, I could have given him the biggest hug!

3.0,3/20/2016,"I received a gift card for Beauty & Essex from the girls at the lab as wedding gift. 2 years of happy marriage later, we finally used it! The place is easy to miss because it's just in a brick building. When you come in, it's a small pawn shop, and not until you open the 2nd door you've entered the restaurant. Kind of like super Mario 64 when he enters an unexciting room in Bowser's castle and notices there is a portal to another room with more action.We thought we could easily order enough food to leave full and only spend 50-75% of the gift card's value, and come back a second time. That didn't happen. We had:Steak Tartare: the freshness and texture were the best parts, but overall it was a bit bland. All I tasted were the capers. No lime aioli or cilantro flavor like the menu said. And...the portion was too small. 4 tiny little triangles of rice cakes with the tartare for $18? Overpriced.Baked chicken meatballs with ricotta: The perfect comforting choice for a chilly winter evening. meatballs were nice and big, seasoned and cooked well. Yay no rubbery balls!! The sauce that came with the meatballs was a truffle mushroom sauce. The meatballs were sitting in a bowl of truffle sauce. I would have taken a picture but it was dark and my camera is not so great. There was in imbalance in the balls:sauce ratio. With the amount of sauce in the serving, they should have given us bread to soak up the rest of the sauce or at least a spoon to finish it. But no bread and no spoon.Sea scallops with truffles, yukon mashed potatoes and leeks: This was my favorite, taste-wise. I haven't had many experiences with scallops cooked so perfectly, grilled crisp on the outside and buttery on the inside. Each scallop was crusted with mushroom and served over a bed of yukon gold mashed potatoes and leeks caramelized in a butter sauce. Now the drawback: it sounds filling, but was definitely not. Each scallop/potato/leek was one bite sized. This was listed in entrees and cost $32. And the portion consisted of...ONLY 3 SCALLOPS!! If I am paying $32 for something like this, I had better be getting at least 8 of these delicious scallops. Chiselers. BBQ fries: Loved these! They gave us a lot of fries and the mesquite bbq taste was delectable. We had the choices of mayo and ketchup for dipping. But they just were good on their own without any dip. This is one of the better choices, a lot of food in the serving for only $12!Lobster mac & cheese: After eating the teensy weensy scallop ""entree"" I was still hungry so ordered this. This was filling. Cheesy and savory, and also a bit of a bbq taste but that could be residual from the BBQ fries.Layered devil's food cake: Thus far most of the portions at this restaurant are too small. But this was too big! The giant cylindrical cake was layered with marscarpone frosting and covered in dark chocolate fudge and came with a side of vanilla ice cream, though the ice cream was more like a gelato/italian ice and also felt IMO like a refreshing palate cleanser. We ate the cake and got bouffed. Petite cupcakes: we got them wrapped to go, couldn't finish them because we were so stuffed from the cake at this point. 3 little red velvet cupcakes with cream cheese frosting and 3 little guinness cakes with baileys frosting. They will be tonight's dessert!",0,0,0,Justine C.,"Seattle, WA",55,87,5

Champagne Brunch features a club scene with great music, food and flowing mimosas. I am a girl who loves her whiskey--on the rocks or neat. I hardly ever get cocktails...but at Beauty and Essex their cocktails are so yummy!! I had the ODB which was delightful! Another favorite of my group was the Beauty Elixir...yum! We had the brunch menu which was a sample menu and can I say, everything was beyond my tastebuds expectations. Just perfect there was not one dish that we didn't love! The scene is turnt all the way up with glow sticks and tons of good vibes. There was also a really huge and cool birthday plaque where they put your name and well wishes.

3.0,3/17/2016,"Classy restaurant with great vibe and decor, but food was unimaginative and mediocre at best.  Cocktail drinks were excellent, however.  A friend and I walked into what looked like a small pawnshop and I was immediately confused.  I thought we had walked into the wrong place, but the greeter asked us to enter through the back door and I was shocked at how beautiful and grandiose the space was.  We were seated right away.  As noted above, the drinks were delicious.  As a fan of St. Germaine, I got the Pink Panther and my friend ordered the Beauty Elixir.  As for food, we ordered the Chile Relleno Empanadas, Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings, Cauliflower Gratin, and the Braised Short Ribs.  The short ribs were good, the soupy cheese dumplings was an interesting concept, but nothing excited my palate.  I do admit that we ordered all heavy, cheesy dishes, so maybe you'd have better luck if you mixed it up a bit and tried some of their lighter fare.  Service was fine.  Fun tip: Sneak in as many bathroom trips as you can ladies, during dinner.  Free sparkling wine in the lounge!",2,1,1,Eunice J.,"Santa Monica, CA",482,283,325

4.0,3/16/2016,"Went here for a fancy birthday dinner on Saturday with some friends (shout out to Chelsea on her Jordan year). The food was good and also somewhat pricey. Food: 4Drinks: 3.5Service: 4.5Ambiance: 5Overall experience: 4.5Food: I ordered the Beauty & Essex burger. It was actually larger than I expected and also very tasty. I couldn't even finish it but that's probably because I also got the Lobster Mac'n'Cheese, which I shared with a friend (I couldn't have too much of a food belly, y'know, because I was looking cute). So, in this burger, there were three different meats: lamb, brisket, and beef - I'm not to sure about the last one since brisket is the breast of beef. Whatever the case, the burger was delish, greasy but delish. If you're a NYer, it tasted like a gyro from the Halal truck. I had grease dripping down my hands and thank God for the napkin because my dress would've smelled of it, as well. Back to the burger, it had goat feta and that was very noticeable. If you're not a fan of feta cheese, please stay away. Thankfully, I LOVE feta! I only ate one half and even that I shared. In short, the burger was worth it, so were the fries. It had this yummy bbq seasoning that is actually making my mouth water as I write this. I only had about ten and had to have the burger and fries bagged. The Mac'n'Cheese, however, was cleaned out because three of us ate it. It went from the two that ordered to three because my friend that got the sweet potato ravioli basically got slop. It was the portion size for a two-week old baby. Literally, she inhaled it. The presentation was amazing and it tasted good but it wasn't worth $21. Let's just say she paid for ambiance. Back to the Mac'n'Cheese; it was so underwhelming. It was not cheesy enough, there were too many breadcrumbs distracting from the main item, and the tomatoes were a shocker. Great portion size, not so great taste. Drinks:- Friend 1: ordered 'The Bajan,' says excellent- Friend 2: ordered 'Pinot Noir,' says not worth the money; two others took a sip and agreedService: I think this was impressive. Adonis was on his A-game. He knew the menu well, made some recommendations, answered every question we had, got our orders right, our food came in a timely fashion, and our water was filled every time we blinked. Patrick, who I assume is his superior was also very available and made sure that our two birthday girls got their cupcakes. I wish the staff would've sang happy birthday but we did it on our own, so no biggie.Ambiance: The restaurant was dimlit, fancy, and chic. The bathroom was freaking superb. I was confused for all of 30 seconds because I thought I went to the bar downstairs but no, the bar is in the bathroom. They gave out glasses of Rose (I don't quite remember). It was good. That's all that mattered and the mirrors atop the sink were reminiscent of my mother's armoire but flooded with lights.I will definitely return, probably closer to payday though.",1,1,0,Gawjous O.,"Hollywood, FL",46,71,129

3.0,3/11/2016,"The décor, feel, staff, and desserts are all pretty phenomenal. My $16 melon mojito was also great.The waitress came over and said that the portions are large enough to share between two people - everyone at my table (party of 9), didn't listen and decided to get their own plate - except for me! I decided to get the lamb chops and convinced my friend to share them with me. They were $44 - I asked the waitress if it was an entire rack, or what the portion looked like - she said yes, its an entire rack cut in half. Perfect! (I thought).My order arrived - a single piece of lamb on one side, and a double bone filled lamb on the other. This portion didn't even fill my friend who is teeny and eats very little.Though delicious with a great wine glaze there is no way to justify such a small portion for $44 - if I go again, with someone who will pay for my food (probably my husband), I would order the smoked salmon or the short ribs.I also got the cauliflower side - it was gross. and for $12, I was sad to leave half of it on the little pan it comes in.The chocolate cake dessert was great.This is a great location for a guy that wants to impress someone he is dating.

4.0,3/7/2016,"Great place for a GNO!! I came here to celebrate a Bachelorette party and we had a great time! The number of times I've been to this place I primarily go for drinks and dancing but this time I came for dinner and it was surprisingly good!! The ambiance here is dressy and sexy so please feel free to dress to impress. There is a mixed age range for the crowd but it was mostly young professionals in their late 20's and 30's. Upon walking in, past the pawn shop, you will encounter a large circular staircase with a sparkling chandelier on the ceiling- definitely creates a gorgeous, seductive atmosphere. Soo pretty!Unfortunately we made reservations short notice so we were only able to get a reservation at 10:45pm on a Saturday night. We also arrived over 10 minutes late so we had to wait an additional 30 minutes for our table to be available (I totally blame us not the restaurant for the wait). We opted to hang out by the bar and get pre-dinner drinks but I guess everyone else had the same idea as the bar was PACKED! Luckily, the bartenders were observant and quick and we were all able to be served drinks after only a few minutes of waiting.Once seated, our waiter was very attentive and service was speedy even though the dining room area was very busy and every table was full at 11:30 pm for dinner. There were a bunch of tables celebrating Bachelorette parties and GNO and the dining room was filled with rambunctious chatter and also was playing loud music (I'm assuming music that was streaming from the DJ upstairs). The music was awesome and I felt like everyone was eating dinner and dancing the whole time. Such great ambiance and another reason why NYC is the greatest city (sorry I just had to slip that in there). I definitely do not recommend this place for date night with your man cause it is WAY loud in here. The restaurant dining room seems better geared for large group tables having fun, not intimate date night. So please don't bring anyone here on your 1st date unless you love shouting over loud people and music to have conversation. Food here is meant to be served tapas style so sharing is encouraged! My favorite dish was the Crispy Eggplant Pizzetta- a mini pizza/flatbread with ricotta cheese and eggplant...soo good!! The Roasted Bone Marrow was yummy and went well with the buttered bread and marmalade spread. We also tried the Thai Style Deep-Fried Shrimp and Cauliflower dish which were both good as well. My not so favorite dishes were the Orange Glazed Baby Carrots and Lobster Mac & Cheese- both dishes were unmemorable. Overall, food and service was great so I wouldn't hesitate to come back here for dinner!My favorite part of this place was the bathroom!! Soooo clean with plenty of stalls, there rarely was a long bathroom line. There is a bathroom attendant there at all times and she's awesome so don't forget to tip her! There are also lounge chairs to sit at in the bathroom (in case you're tired or waiting for your friends to pee) and EXTRA BONUS- there was a mini bar in the bathroom that night serving complimentary champagne (just don't forget to tip her also)!! I felt like there was no need to even leave the bathroom...free booze, toilets whenever you needed it, music streaming in from the speakers, and lounge chairs to relax in...I could totally have my own party with my friends in there. Anyway, I digress....come here for GNO!! It's fun and you won't be disappointed!!",2,1,1,Diana S.,"Houston, TX",182,197,491

Dinner service at Beauty and Essex is beyond amazing but keep in mind that they get extremely busy, so make reservations. Also, dress to impress. I'm not sure if there is a dress code, but the club upstairs opens up, so you will see a lot of well dressed folks rolling through. Anyhow...This place is so extravagant and...sexy. Yes, sexy. While waiting for your table you are encouraged to have a drink at the bar or lounge on their couches to get comfortable.Their drinks from the specialty menu were fantastic. I had the Beauty Elixir, which was amazing. It would be one of those drinks that you could drink 4 of without realizing that you're wasted. Deliciously dangerous stuff.  I would usually never order a specialty drink at a busy bar but I am so glad that I did. I had a chance to check out the bathrooms and it's true, they have bar service in the restrooms. Mind blown.Service was great. Our server was so attentive and sweet. She gave us great recommendations on drinks and each part of the menu. I don't think we had anything that we would not have ordered again. The tuna poke tacos were my absolute favorite. They came as three tacos, but each taco was just perfect. My eyes literally rolled back as I bit into these delicious little tacos. Their appetizers are their specialty.

Probably one of the trendiest places I've been to on either coast (I'm from LA but currently live in NY)! This establishment is so cool there's a bartender in the bathroom serving complimentary rosé. Yes, you read that correctly. A bartender in the women's bathroom serving complimentary rosé...So why is this place called BEAUTY and Essex? After a conversation with our waiter, it seems that the makers wanted a more feminine feel to this place, as the male version is The Stanton Social. If you observe the restaurant, each room is designed like a jewelry box! One room has a lot of mirrors, and the ceiling is the ""lid"" of the jewelry box. There's another room with pearls, and another locket-themed room. There's a section called ""jewels on toast"" in the menu. How clever.SERVICEOur waiter was friendly, and I especially liked that he told us his recommendations whenever he gave us the menu. The only con would be that we ordered a bottle of wine but it was not kept at the table, and we kept having to ask our glass to be refilled. The staff also communicate well, and things run smoothly here w minimal wait. FOODOf all the $$$ new American tapas style restaurants I've been to, I would put Beauty & Essex near the top. Every dish (minus one which I'll tell you about later) had us squealing. -Tomato dumplings: everybody raves about this on Yelp so we had to try it. I'm not a huge fan of cheese so it wasn't too amazing, but it tastes very cozy. Like a bite bursting with grilled cheese and tomato soup-Lobster tacos: this was also popular on Yelp which is why we had to try it. Just three tacos, but each taco was STUFFED with so much lobster. It surprised both of us how generous they were with the lobster-Cauliflower: basic dish, very-well made-Mac & cheese: this standard dish actually turned out to be my favorite dish of the night. There was minimal cheese (just the way I like it), the macaroni was perfectly done, the breadcrumbs on top were on point, and the depth of the dish was perfect where every bite came with crusty crumbs. I don't really like mac & cheese, but Beauty & Essex may have changed my mind!-Braised short ribs: unfortunately our main entree wasn't that good. The meat was on the dry, tougher side.

The music is great and loud enough to get you moving but still low enough to have a conversation. On weekends the upstairs turns into a lounge atmosphere by the bar. Be warned, if you order wine it will not come in a regular wine glass. It will come in what seems to be a smaller than a champagne flute that you can drink in a gulp.

4.0,2/16/2016,"My fiancé and I have been here a few times and always have a great experience, but last night was the best because we had the best server!  If you get a chance to request a server, ask for Femi.  He made our night.  Drinks and food got to us very quickly which is obviously the most important thing in life.  He was very friendly, professional, didn't hover and showed up exactly when we needed him.  Anyway, we just loved Femi and wanted the world to know.  On top of the great service, the food is always fantastic... the tuna tacos are a must!  Always a favorite there.  Chicken meatballs with ricotta were good, but not as tasty as thought they would be.  Still, can't complain.  We also had some semi-freddo chocolate dessert.  Delicious and perfect portions.  Thanks for another great experience Beauty & Essex!",1,0,0,Katherine K.,"Astoria, NY",0,4,0
3.0,2/16/2016,"The place itself looks nice, I was really surprised hearing the rap/r-n-b playing on Monday night but I do like that kind of music ;). Food was pretty good, however, our waitress Olga looked annoyed and not really friendly, food runner messed up our entrees by giving my spicy one to my friend that can't eat anything spicy at all. Waitress came to the table, did say sorry but walked away after repeatedly saying that it wasn't her fault. So we were sitting at the table wondering if she ll do anything about that or not, she did come back and said that manager took one of the entrees off the bill. Which was nice I guess. Another thing is that I ordered woodford old fashion downstairs at the bar, and they charged me 18$ for that and then I had another one at the table upstairs and it was 14$. I would probably go there again to have a drink or two( with the fact that price would be more consistent) but to have dinner.. I don't think so because you can find a lot of places in NYC with better food and definitely better service.",0,0,0,Lana L.,"Stamford, CT",0,4,1

1.0,2/15/2016,"I have been to Beauty & Essex several times before and had a great time. Unfortunately such was not the case this Valentine's Day. I made reservations over a week in advance for us and another couple to whom we previously raved about this restaurant for a special Valentine's Day Champagne Brunch at 3:15PM.  We arrived there at 3:20PM and approached the hostess - tall skinny blond woman with long hair.  She proceeded to tell us that there is no brunch and that the pre-fix brunch menu was not available after 3:15PM. This made no sense at all since our reservations were for 3:15PM, the second seating of the V-day brunch. The hostess repeated herself in a nearly rude manner and said it was miscommunication on their part. She was rude overall and did not offer an apology for the clearly obvious mistake, instead kept repeating her rude responses. Moving passed that, we agreed to stay for the dinner menu. When we were finally seated, the waitress said that there is no dinner menu until 5PM and gave us the very limited afternoon menu. We told the waitress that we will order a bunch of appetizers from the current menu and then order entries and more food from the dinner menu when it becomes available at 5PM. The waitress came back in a minute or two and told us that they will be really busy and may have to move us elsewhere after 5, this was after the waitress was notified that one of the guests in our party was pregnant. Over the next few times during which the waitress approached us she kept concentrating on the possibility of us having to move later on and of is having to close out this check and start a new one. Ruined the entire experience. Eventually she called over the manager - David.  He apologized for the miscommunication about the Champagne Brunch at 3:15, rudeness of the hostess, and bad service from the waitress and said that they will ""take care of us"". The rest of the evening went similar to the start. We got bounced around to another few waiters who were all terrible and showed poor service with many mistakes. The food wasn't bad, but was so so and overpriced.  Considering the terrible service, food isn't worth it at all.  At the end of the ruined Valentine's Day dinner we were at least expecting some sort of remedy for the many mistakes made by Beauty & Essex that night. Well, surprise surprise....nothing was done. We paid the $320 bill for 4 people for some average food and terrible and rude service. My advice...stay away.  This is unacceptable.  Fortunately, one of our guests is a senior writer for one of the major NYC magazines so stay tuned  for a detailed piece on this terrible V-day experience at Beauty & Essex within the next 1-2 issues. There are plenty of better places such as Stanton Social, Coop, and Hotel Chantelle.",2,1,1,Alex M.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,8,1

You have to walk through a little pawn shop before entering the restaurant. Once you enter, you see a big chandelier! :D There is a bar if you walk straight ahead and there is a bar upstairs. While you wait to be seated, you can grab a few drinks and sit on the couches to hang out a bit. While waiting, I went to the bathroom, and it is really cozy. Haha. They have nice couches and bar service in there! Crazy right?! At first, I was wondering why there were people sitting here holding drinks. Haha, but I realized there was bar service. How awesome! We ordered the Tuna Poke Taco, Empanadas, and Crispy Eggplant Pizzetta for appetizers; Paprika Spiced Atlantic Salmon, Beauty & Essex Burger for entrees; Petite Cupcakes and Vanilla  Panna Cotta for desserts. I would say the Tuna Poke Taco was the best plate of the night. The empanadas and crispy eggplant pizzetta was alright. The eggplant had too much cheese on it for my liking. The salmon and burger was nothing special. I have had better burger elsewhere. The cupcakes were really cute and regular red velvet with cream cheese and chocolate cupcakes.

As in.. you cannot even move without being bumped into and your martini spilling everywhere.  We waited to be buzzed for 10 mins... 20 mins....30 mins.... went to ask.. and the girl was not friendly... finally about FIFTY MINUTES later we were FINALLY seated.  What was the point of the reservation if we are going to wait almost an hour?   Anyway, finally seated and they squish us into this corner table where I sat in the aisle seat.  Literally was getting so annoyed because everyone that came through kept bumping into my chair..even the servers... clearly this table should have been for four... someone needs to work on the seating arrangements here...ANYWAYYYY despite all of these things I thought the food was pretty good.  We started with the empanadas, tuna tacos, and the famous dumplings which were all delicious.  I ordered the salmon for my main... and it was pretty over cooked so i was not loving it..  My friend ordered the spaghettini, which tasted very fresh.  For dessert we all got the semi freddo which was also pretty good.  All in all, I'd come back...skip the main courses and just order everything as tapas since the best dishes were the appetizers.. and just know in advance you are going to wait !!!",3,3,2,Lauren A.,"New York, NY",237,239,442

To start someone with a bad taste in their mouth for a dining experience is not how to enjoy a meal. I've worked in the food industry for over 15 years now & believe me I get it faking the smile, high pitched speech & biting your tongue because the customer is always right but this was the beginning of your shift/day I was nothing but nice & cordial towards you. I simply stated I was just checking in for a birthday. Not saying hello, not smiling, looking down, not making eye contact, acting bitchy, abrasive & as if I'm bothering u is ALL wrong. You're supposed to be setting an example for all the other hostess you work with. You're ruining it for returning customers so CHECK YO SELF! I doubt your bosses would like if a $1200 table didn't want to return & caused a scene. NYC is big with high turnover rates of restaurants don't add to the statistic!"".

5.0,2/6/2016,"Went here last week with friends for restaurant week dinner.  The restaurant entrance is through the door toward the back of the pawn shop.  There was a doorman there opening the door for everyone when we were there.  Decor was modern and classy.  Lighting was just right as it was easy to see the menu, but still soft enough to set the mood.  Service was excellent.  They really made us feel special.  Before we even ordered a complimentary appetizer was brought to the table.  Drinks were expensive ($16), but worth ordering since they were strong and they made sure you enjoy your drink.  My friend ordered a melon mojito.  At first she couldn't taste the melon in the drink.  I examined it and another friend also did.  We agreed the melon was weak.  Our waiter saw us smelling and staring at the drink and asked us if everything was ok.  My friend told the waiter that she could not taste the melon.  He gladly took it back and had the drink remade with more melon.  The remade drink tasted great and the melon was more prevalent.  Another friend didn't like his drink at all and was able to exchange it for a different one.Food was creative and delicious.  The tuna tacos had a good crunch to contrast with the soft tuna.  The tuna was fresh and the addition lime enhanced the flavors.  The eggplant pizza was also very good as the eggplant was not watery and was seasoned well.  Crust was soft and toasted just right.  I had the jerk chicken for my entree which to my surprise was pre-cut so less work for me while eating.  Seasoning was perfect as the jerk seasoning was strong, but not overly spicy to require a drink after each bite.  Polenta was creamy and went well with the chicken.  I also tried the salmon with Sriracha vegetables.  Salmon cooked to medium well was tender and juicy.  Surprisingly the Sriracha vegetables were spicier than my Jerk chicken.  My favorite part of the meal was the dessert.  I ordered the chocolate semifreddo which is a cookie with pop rocks embedded in it with chocolate mousse on top all encased in a dark chocolate shell.  The mousse was light and had a good balance of chocolate and sweetness.  The cookie had a good crunch to it.  After chewing and swallowing the dessert was when I felt the pop rocks going off in my mouth, which was really fun.  The woman's bathroom was well stocked with perfumes, lotion and other supplies you may need to freshen up.  There was also a small bar and lounge area inside that was packed, so I did not get to try the free champagne that was being given out at the bar.  I asked the guys if there was something similar in their bathroom, but they said there was no bar in the men's room.",0,1,0,Kelly D.,"Merrick, NY",223,260,865

To cut it short I was very disappointed, our server was a young Asian woman who had a not so friendly exterior, she killed the vibe of the evening before it began spoke to us like children explaining how a prefix menu worked (yes lady I think its common sense to pick one out of every category), the food was mediocre, I work at a upscale restaurant myself so I kinda know how things go and the food did not impress or was good at all which shocked me for all the hype this place had. We had the salmon which I could have made better and the spaghetti which just tasted like pesto on spaghetti. except for the Panna cotta which was enjoyable . For a pricey dinner I expected more.

3.0,2/5/2016,"So I went to Beauty and Essex for Restaurant Week on a Wednesday night for a 7pm reservation. If super trendy and very impersonal is your thing, this is your place. I really liked the speakeasy concept of the pawn store with the gorgeous lounge/restaurant in the back. There are some really great pieces in the pawn store for purchase but the lighting isn't the best. Coming for 7pm reservation and meeting a group of five was really difficult because there were droves of people just being hoarded in to be seated and hanging out at the bar area that is really too small for the volume. Although, seating was pretty prompt once our party arrived, I took issue with the lighting. It was really difficult to navigate to the table and read the menu. The ambiance with the music was great but we were sitting at the back tables. There was a lot of space and pretty quiet but it was cold at times.Our waiter was nice but a little flustered and needed a lot of guidance. I was really turned off when we were still eating dessert and he just placed the bill on the table. The menu had cute choices -- we decided to try the famous Lobster Mac and Cheese, which was okay. My entree of salmon was overcooked even though I was asked and stated medium well, but I really enjoyed the empanadas. The desert of petite cupcakes was less than satisfying. So I took issue that the The Bajan cocktail wasn't made with Mount Gay rum, but it is minor. I didn't come away with a good idea on what I could except if I came outside of Restaurant Week. I actually gave them an extra star because in the beginning hustle and bustle of getting the table, I lost my tag for my coat and the ladies in coat check were really accommodating and found my coat in less than 10 minutes even with the high volume of ppl that they were dealing with.",0,0,0,Alana B.,"Brooklyn, NY",69,82,28

As per the above, the ambiance here is trendy and over the top. Dress to impress (I missed that memo, whoops) and be prepared for some serious people watching. You should also come hungry; although Beauty & Essex has a lot of tapas-sized plates for sharing, the portions are pretty big. Also: the food is really, really good.The dranks: I had the ""Beauty Elixir"" cocktail, a very refreshing mixture of gin, strawberry, and cucumber. This is one of those drinks that I could drink 5 of without even noticing, and then fall on my face immediately after.The appetizers: crispy eggplant pizzetta (huge portion. The whipped ricotta was amazing), tuna poke tacos (spicy!), and grilled cheese and bacon tomato soup dumplings. Let me repeat myself. GRILLED CHEESE DUMPLINGS IN TOMATO SOUP. Served in individual soup spoons, these were seriously addictive and absolutely incredible.The entrees: I had the paprika spiced salmon, which was my least favorite part of the meal. It was cooked well, but didn't have a lot of flavor. It also came with a side of roasted cauliflower and kale that was basically doused in sriracha (definitely not a fan). In comparison, the burger looked awesome, and the accompanying BBQ fries were amazing.The desserts: panna cotta (can't go wrong here) and the chocolate semifreddo; the latter was essentially mini chocolate mousse bon bons with pop rocks (?!) and sea salt. Every bite surprised me with a different texture, and a perfect size for ending the meal.Now that I'm adequately prepared for what to expect at Beauty & Essex, I'd definitely return.

I couldn't have spoken to a ruder person who clearly didn't seem to care too much. After multiple eye rolls and sarcastic responses, we kept waiting. Around 7:45 we finally got a buzzer and I asked again if our table was ready since we had a 7pm reservation. Her response, ""you have a buzzer don't you?"".  We were finally seated near 8pm. We were seated right next to the sheer bar curtain on the first floor. Our server was great and welcoming, very accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu. During the meal, one of the servers shattered a glass right between the sheer curtain and our table, causing shards of glass to fall on me and near my bag. All we got was an ""I'm sorry"" through the sheer curtain. No body from management, or even our server, came over to apologize and provide a remedy for the situation. The food was average, overpriced for what it is. The BBQ fries were the best part of the whole night. I'll never go back and I would never recommend this to anyone.

With tuna poke taco and eggplant pizzetta, my palate has been completely opened. Eggplant was so crispy and I could literally feel it popping up in my mouth! For main courses, we opted for the salmon and spiced chicken. Apparently they were less satisfactory.

My bf got the empanadas and it was really yummy too, but the tuna tacos was def my fave. Entrees weren't bad either but I didn't enjoy mine as much as I would've enjoyed another twenty tuna tacos LOL I ordered the salmon and it was cooked nicely but I guess I'm not really a big fan of their sauce. My bf got the burger which was pretty damn juicy and delicious. If I had to pick between our entrees, I'd choose his. It also came with fries and who doesn't love fries?! The dessert was a bit underwhelming. I got the red velvet cakes but they're just mini cupcakes pretty much. The bill came out to be $110 for two if anyone's interested in the price. And this is with the restaurant week menu. Overall a good experience.",1,0,0,Fionna C.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",22,77,85

5.0,1/26/2016,"Rarely do places like these live up to their hype, but Beauty & Essex defies the odds.  I can only speak for the brunch-- of which I have been to the regular brunch downstairs and the, ehm, promoter brunch (hey, I'm not one to miss an opportunity for free food) upstairs.  Each time the food is consistent, and by consistent I mean consistently good. Every single dish I have had has been outstanding. It's tapas style, so you have the option of ordering many different plates for the table to share.  Some that stood out for me was the kale salad (shocking for me since I, 1. Hate salad and 2. Hate kale), eggplant pizetta, chicken biscuit bites, and the marscapone grits.  They also have a wide array of cocktails. What makes this place unique is the fact that it's a speakeasy-- to get to the restaurant you must enter through a small (and fully operating) pawn shop. The atmosphere here has a lounge-y, Art Deco feel.  The lights are dim, the music is downtempo, and the crowd is generally of a cooler variety (but I've seen a good mix of people).  Beauty & Essex is a must go if you're a fan of brunch, as well as, the whole speakeasy thing.  Oh, and a tip from the bathroom attendant, apparently they serve champagne in the ladies room at 6:30 pm (sorry men I don't know if the same goes for you).",0,0,0,Miranda P.,"New York, NY",2,6,0

I highly recommend the grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings (literally to die for), 'chile relleno' empanadas, mushroom crusted sea scallops, paprika spiced atlantic salmon and the beauty and essex burger.

For the drinks, we had the melon Mojito and woodsman and I would have to say the woodsman was an excellent fruity bourbon drink. But the greatest thing I ate while I was at Beauty and Essex - the vanilla panna cotta. Incredible!!! So creamy and delicious. 3 stars: main course. We had the burger and the salmon. The salmon was very average. It was extremely spicy and lacked good flavor that wasn't well put together. Don't get the salmon. The burger was good but not the best burger I've had. Overall 4 stars.

5.0,1/23/2016,"Absolutely love this place and wish we hadn't waited so long to finally go. However every time we have tried to make a Fri/Sat res - whether the day of or 9 days prior - we get stuck with 5:30pm or 11pm for seating. Our first time we were lucky enough to find 2 seats by the upstairs bar around 7pm but had we come 1-2 hours later the bar would  already have been too slammed to eat or even get near the bar. And I know this because of the many hands reaching over my lobster tacos for their vodka tonics. We settled on about 5 small plates along with the grilled cheese dumplings of course (if you don't get these, you basically didn't even eat here) which all left us full but ready to go out and not want to crawl home in a food coma. I will go out of my way to ask if a bar has a cucumber based drink and 3 beauty elixirs later I was a rather happy little lady. Came to about $200 for 2 people with probably half of that being from mixed drinks so not terribly outrageous for nyc...or perhaps I just like the place enough to defend their champagne-filled-bathroom honor. The bartender serving us (Ednan?) was kind of a buzzkill and quite obviously not interested in talking to us while sitting there for 2 hours saying no more than he had to. You'd just expect more with the upscale vibe and it being part of his job and all BUT we caught Mike working the front door this particular night (usually in the kitchen) who gave us some fun background info (they actually sell the jewelry you see on occasion) and seemed eager to chat and hang before we headed out for the night.

The food was not hot at all and with all the cheese or sauce on each item, it was congealed and not very appetizing.  But the worst part of the meal was the set up.  We were placed at a corner table in upstairs restaurant right by the bar.  They then seated a large table of women behind us, on top of us.  They were loud and a larger group than the table could accommodate but enjoying themselves.  It was not their job to understand the wait staff had nowhere to walk in between.  So apparently it was me that suffered. no less than 30 times in a 2 hour window was I bumped into by staff and customers being seated.   Very poor planning from such a ""in"" place.  We tried to go to the ladies on the way out and a man collecting coats blocked the entire doorway and refused to move.  Really?

5.0,1/15/2016,"if you r ever in Manhattan, this is one of the restaurants u MUST to come visit at least once. Beauty & Essex is one of the coolest places for food I have ever stepped in. they also serve the most delicious n pretty tapas/small plates I have ever eaten. the exterior of the storefront is just a facade while the party is really happening on the inside. the design is like the growing trend of speakeasys. (it's been trending in Asia for years.) when u walk into the store, u r actually standing in a pawn shop. to get into the restaurant, u have to walk through another door in the back where security stands guarding the entrance. it makes u feel like u just sneaked into a very exclusive club for only the super cool peeps. they have a great selection of cocktails. all of which were very tasty n had a good amount of alcohol in them. I tasted my friend's Woodsmen n it was super strong! also a cool hangout is the downstairs women's restroom/lounge. there's a server standing there with glasses of free champagne for each lady. of course it isn't Cristal, but free is still good!Beauty & Essex is a very popular place for ppl to hang out at (especially for celebrating.) so make sure to get reservations in EARLY. our friends made reservations 2 weeks ahead. I would say the food r all delicious. it's tapas so u need order more for a large group. the best cocktail I had was the Beauty Elixir.

It's not often that I'll walk in somewhere for the first time and the atmosphere immediately has me saying ""yes, this is awesome"" - but then again, how often do you walk through a pawn shop, open the back door and walk into a expansive, dimly lit restaurant/lounge with a beautiful downstairs bar and a spiraling staircase the the 2nd floor dining area?The food is also really fantastic. My characterization of it is that it's gourmet/creative comfort food. Think, ""grilled cheese tomato bisque dumplings"" - the simple menu item of a grilled cheese that's been given a creative flare and presented as fancy tapas.A great wine selection is also on hand with a friendly and knowledgeable staff.

4.0,1/10/2016,"had a great time celebrating a friend's birthday here last night.Ambiance: Very swank, lots of beautifully dressed people celebrating events or just grabbing a bite to eat. The music was BUMPING, great great music selection... but the type of music being played (lots of old school R&B and hip hop) didn't match the ::ahem:: crowd, but my friends and I were jamming in our seats. The music was a little loud for the place and it felt like eating in a club at times, but somehow it worked. Food: looking at the menu and reading Yelp reviews may be a little misleading. Yes the portions are small, but the tapas serving are based on how many are in your party and it's still the same price as listed. If there are 5 people, for an $18 dish, there will be 5 servings and it will still be $18. Same goes for if there are 2 or 10 of you. Nonetheless, you'll still only get a bite size of what's being served, but hey. The food was DELISH. The eggplant pizza, the short rib and kale/apple salad were all standouts. Everything was hot and fresh and there were no complaints about the food. Because there were a lot of us, the bill was also very, very reasonable. The food does ""look"" expensive in comparison to the portion sizes, but if you are in a large group...it's really not bad. Don't come here if you are expecting a belly ache from eating so much. Service: No complaints here, the waitress was attentive and accessible. She answered our questions, food came out promptly, we didn't have to go looking for her. There was a bit of a wait for a table despite having a reservation and our whole party being present. Misc: After eating, we chilled in the downstairs bathroom for a bit. Sipped some pink champagne, freshened up, took some photos. Great time. THEN we ventured upstairs to the lounge. GREAT music selection and attentive hostesses.

I thought the service overall was great when we were there, and the staff was so great about keeping the dinner a surprise for our guest of honor.

4.0,12/31/2015,"This joint exudes coolness. It's a fun speakeasy-style concept with delicious food, strong cocktails and EXCELLENT people-watching.From the outside, the restaurant is a bit unassuming, concealed by its pawn shop facade. But inside, the chic decor will transport you far, far away.I met up with a few friends here a couple of weeks ago for dinner. We had reservations for 8:45 PM, but unfortunately, we weren't seated until closer to 10 PM. Not the end of the world, but it was extremely annoying. Luckily, we were able to enjoy martinis while we waited in the downstairs bar area. And we may have enjoyed some of the complimentary champagne that's offered in the ladies restroom. That's a really fun touch.The food here is excellent, and there are a couple of items that I'm still thinking about. The oysters and tuna tacos blew me away! Other folks at our table seemed to love the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings (they looked amazing).The bill was high, but I think it was worth it.

Food was served tapas style - with just 1 bite per person per course.  Althgough they didn't count the number of our party correctly, and the birthday boy was out of luck with food -- he didn't get any, ever.  So we all had to share our one-bite with him.

And there's a blaring ""BEAUTY & ESSEX"" sign...They didn't have any open reservations, but they allowed us to sit at the lounge and dine in, which was fine with us. We got table service (albeit slow) there as well. It got pretty busy throughout the night, and some woman screamed out, ""Push like it's a club!"" And honestly, it was at some point. The lounge was completely packed with people standing around with drinks.Moving onto the food, we shared the Bone Marrow, the Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup Dumplings and the Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese. The bone marrow was perhaps my favorite - a good, fatty portion with crispy toast. The Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup Dumplings were too single-dimensional in flavor for my taste. It was tasty for the first bite, but with even my 2nd spoonful, I was bored. Same for the Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese - nothing outstanding.Overall, I'd rate this place a 3.5 stars, but bumped it up for pretty cool decor.

During a recent trip to NYC, my girlfriends and I spent a Saturday night here and had the best, most memorable time ever -- even if we had a 10:30 pm dinner reservation and didn't get seated until two hours later!It's a nice little pawnshop out front, and a huge, super-swanky, multi-level restaurant and club inside. The main floor has the reception, a bar, and the restaurant. Coat check and bathrooms are in the basement -- and yes, there is champagne service in the women's restroom! We spent several minutes chilling on the couch in the restroom lounge. It was chic, comfortable, clean. The upper level has the club, which wasn't all that big, and it gets very, very crowded. The night we went, it was packed like a can of sardines with not much room to move, but everyone still had an epic time bumping and dancing to the music. The DJ was brilliant and knew exactly how to work the crowd. None of those crappy EDM remixes of great-as-is hip hop/dance tracks! We were starving as we waited for our table, but we had so much fun dancing and drinking in the club that it didn't matter much!The food was bomb. It was all small plates, so we ordered a variety, including the chipotle duck chilaquiles, flash seared tuna, and a steak. There was not one complaint about the food on the table. I personally enjoyed the chilaquiles a lot -- it had a sunny egg, lots of cheese, lots of paprika cream, and a generous amount of duck meat! The flavors went perfectly together. I was just so hungry that I wished they gave me a bigger serving for the $17. Service was stellar, though.Bartenders poured great drinks. We all got to try the Emerald Gimlet and loved it.

Finally they got it figured out and let us up but that was kinda weird. The atmosphere is cool and they play good music, so I'll give them that. The upstairs was so crowded it was hard to move through people to find my friend. Although the music is good, nobody was dancing and there was no room to dance anyway despite the place having quite a bit of space. I ordered the O.D.B cocktail ($16) which was good but NOT strong at all. If I'm going to pay that much for a drink, I better get my money's worth. A lot of the space (upstairs and downstairs) was taken up with tables for people dining there, but I'm not sure why anyone would choose this place for dinner since the music is so loud you can barely hear the people you're with. It's kind of an odd choice... I don't mind loud music in a lounge/club, but if I'm having dinner with people that's the last thing I'd want. Also, there's no bathroom on the upper level so you have to go all the way back downstairs and then down another level to the basement.

Was given a pager upon arrival and check-in. 20 minutes later asked the hostess if they had our reservation or if there was some mistake - and viola we were seated immediately. Upstairs the waitress took our order (the pre-fix menu, of course, we like to eat all the things) then proceeded to ignore us the rest of the time. We had to get up to ask for more water, coffee, and our 2nd glasses of champagne (meanwhile, the other tables around us were getting very attentive service. Is it because we were only a party of 2? Who knows.) even the guy going around passing out the blinking rings passed us up, (like offered them to the lounge seats to the left and right of us but walked right past us) then when he came to clear our dishes (after we asked for someone to) I ""jokingly"" said I wanted one too and he made a big deal of being so apologetic. 30 seconds later he passed out glow sticks and magically once again forgot we were sitting LITERALY directly in front of him. It was so weird. We got up to pay our bill at the bar when it became clear our waitress was never going to glance over or pass by our table again. We paid cash and left..... Then the doorman chased us outside saying she was looking for us. Went back in and she apologetically said ""never mind we found it"" - I guess they thought we walked our tab even though she is the one who handed it to us at the bar. That was the most she had paid attention to us the entire time. Just a terrible, unpleasant and insulting experience. We were trying to figure out if we weren't dressed enough or something but no - a girl at the table next to us was literally in a sweatshirt and leggings. (And not like a cute sweatshirt.

The impossibly crispy bits of bacon atop a dumpling that is simultaneously reminiscent of a gougère and a quiche, perfectly balanced by the slightly sweet, slightly creamy soup. The orange kissed salmon ceviche was incredibly refreshing, with the citrus essence really making its presence known. Chile relleno empenadas accurately capture the flavor and character of the cheese-stuffed pepper inside a flaky crust. The broccolini was perfectly cooked and simply seasoned, and the puréed beet amuse-bouche was just as memorable as anything we ordered.

When elected to plan a ""Friendgiving"" this year for my co-workers I was ecstatic to announce that we would be coming to this place. Hidden behind a Pawn Shop, under a giant, electrifying sign outside is Beauty and Essex. Certainly a gorgeous, immaculate restaurant, bar and lounge. Be sure to dress up a bit, some of our party in jeans felt quite uncomfortable. While none of the several dishes we had here stunned me, I feel that the food was pretty good. This place is definitely not built for larger parties. Most of the dishes are ""tapas"" style...yet only come with 4 pieces on average to share. Even with our party of 8, it was awkward how we each got one shrimp, one small taco, one small scoop of salad, etc because of the very small portions. (Food discussion to come later) The service was excellent. There was a man standing at the ready for any and all issues with the dining experience who would speak into his lapel into a small microphone and clear any issues immediately. For instance, one of my friends wanted to know if the ""crunchy things"" on top of her steak were gluten free. Within a matter of seconds and speaking into his mic, we was able to confirm that they were gluten free. This was impressive, top notch! The drinks were way to pricey for me...about $15 a drink! Small too. Food:Salmon Ceviche, Onion Rings, and Duck: Can't review them because our waitress never put in the order. She admitted that she wrote down the items, but just never put them in. Was very apologetic about this and took it off the bill. Still though, kind of disappointingHouse Salad: Light, delicious, crunch chick peas were a plus!Empanadas: A true hit with our table, these went the fastest, excellent!Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup Dumplings: Dumplings were definitely amazing, but not filling. Especially considering the little bit of soup served on a very shallow spoon, not easy to eat at all. Was expecting more. Still, no other place has this and it was pretty good.Thai Style Deep Fried Shrimp: These were HUGE shrimp, biggest I've ever seen. I'm indifferent to them, thought they were OK.Lobster Tacos: Pretty good, not sure why the lobster was rolled into a ball in a taco? Very awkward to eatLobster Mac and Cheese: EXCELLENT, not overpowering fishy flavor, on point! My favorite. Regular mac and cheese was great tooBBQ Fries: Great, no complaintsOven Braised Chicken Meatballs: Perfection. Tied with the lobster mac and cheese. Loved these.

3.0,11/28/2015,"Beauty and Essex was a really cool place, but if you go, this is what to expect. The crowd is verrry boushy and tends to look you up and down often. This would be ok but the staff does it too. We just wanted a quick couple of drinks and dessert and when the waiter found out we were not ordering food, he immediately changed his tune and became very shot with us. Shocking since he made $30 off of us in 15 min from 6 drinks and 2 desserts. The restaurant was expensive, which again is fine, as long as you are expecting it. At one point during our short time here, they were moving things around the restaurant and my boyfriend gold elbowed in the back of the head while we were sitting at the table. Although it was an accident, the staff member didn't even apologize. The bathrooms are very inconveniently located downstairs and if you are dining in the restaurant, you have to crawl through everyone hanging at the bar to even get there.

We were seated upstairs where we decided on several selections of dishes to share amongst the 3 of us.We ordered:Brussels Sprouts & Crispy Serrano HamRoasted Bone MarrowChile Relleno' EmpanadasOven Braised Chicken MeatballsSpaghettiniGarganelliThe dishes were amazing but the only dish I wouldn't order again is the Spaghettini. I wasn't very into the parsley flavor.,0,0,0,Michelle C.,"San Francisco, CA",387,167,441
4.0,11/24/2015,"Great drinks, food was hit or miss (though I think I just ordered wrong for me on that ""miss""). You walk past a bouncer into a pawn shop (which is actually functional. You can buy stuff. They have one of those antique clickity-clackity cash registers). Into a super posh bar.And yes, the ladies' restroom has a mini bar with champagne. Technically free, but I would feel judged if I didn't leave a tip in their quite-ostentatious tip bucket.And if you're in casual garb, not dressed to the nine's for a night out, be prepared to feel the teeny tiniest bit judged. Nothing outright.. just a glance here or there, a slightly off-handed way the staff acted. They were perfectly polite, technically.No wait ~5pm on a Sunday. MUST-HAVES: Woodsman (for the whiskey-lovers). Lobster Tacos.Check out my photos for additional info!COCKTAILS - SWEET* O.D.B. ""Old Dirty Bramble"" (milagro reposada tequila, smoked blackberries, honey, ginger juice, lemon) - 4 starsLove love love the blackberries. Logistically a little hard to sip with the straw - it is the exact size of the little blackberry bits that end up being mixed in to the drink. Quite strong, but still very well-balanced for a strong drink. When you eat the blackberry, you can REALLY taste the smokiness.COCKTAILS - SAVORY* The Woodsman (woodford reserve bourbon, allspice drain, maple syrup, lemon, muddled pears) - 4.5 starsWell-balanced, good combination of booziness and fruit flavors (i.e. the muddled pear), with a nice finish from the maple syrup. * Lobster Tacos (beer-battered Marine lobster, red cabbage slaw, poblano crema. $22) - 4 starsExcellent! You get a giant ball of lobster - dang that meat is so fresh and has that perfect crunch!! - the batter is great. The toppings are simple, but that's good because you could focus on the quality of the meat.* Spaghettini (zucchini, lemon, parsley pesto, sunny-side up egg. $19) - 3 starsGood in theory, but the lemon was WAY too strong. The pesto wasn't as sharp as I'd hoped. When you had a bite of the pasta coated in egg yolk, that cut the zest of the lemon quite a bit.",4,0,3,Ziyan C.,"San Francisco, CA",83,2073,9557

2.0,11/20/2015,"The mister and I love tapas and so we decided to come here to celebrate his birthday with his family. I really wanted to love this place, but....I can't give this place 5 stars because it's a bit misleading. I love tapas style restaurants and this place was not. I feel like it should be called ""price per bite!"" I'm used to the small dishes and family style sharing, but this was definitely not it. The menu is badly labeled. What they don't tell you is how many are served on each plate. They make it sound really nice that everyone at the table can try a bite. So typically, each plate comes with 3 (this is after we asked the waiter because it's not written on the menu). If you have 5 people, you will need to get 2 orders, but it comes with exactly 5, and you'll get charged two-thirds of the second plate. Get it? Yes, a bit confusing, but definitely adds up. I went with a party of 6, so we were told to order about 9 plates. I would say 9 is a bit too many because we were all full by the 7th plate. If everyone in your party picks a plate and then maybe an appetizer or two, you will be good to go! As for the ambiance, it was nice, but I don't know how I feel about the pawn shop in the front of the restaurant. Once you walk through the pawn shop, there's another door that leads to the restaurant. The place was very spacious. They have an upstairs bar to hang out and host parties. That was cool. Also, our reservation was at 6pm. We showed up fifteen minutes earlier and they wouldn't seat us until 6. It was a bit odd because by the time they would seat us, the restaurant was practically half empty and they sat us right by the restroom. What a disappointment. Anyway, cool place for the hip and trendy. Great date spot and the food was good. Would I come back? Probably not. I think there are a lot of other great restaurants to try in the city.

4.0,11/19/2015,"I had my birthday dinner here on 11/14/15 and had a party of 9. You definitely need a reservation if you want to dine. Pros: The ambiance was beautiful. It had a vintage feel that I loved. The food was amazing with fast service. The hostess staff and wait staff were friendly and upbeat. The place is a restaurant/lounge/pawn shop which was nice. It was loud, but you were able to communicate. Cons:If you drive, there is absolutely no parking near the restaurant. So take the train or park 3 blocks away. It was way to crowded. It felt like a can of sardines. The upper level where there was a bar section/lounge area was very close to the dinning section. They have security which keeps everyone in their own section, however it's very crowded, and you had to push through people to get to and from the bathroom. It's a little pricey, but that's what you're going to pay for upscale dinning. Overall, I had a wonderful time and the waitress surprised me with a birthday cupcake. It was delicious.

I had the emerald gimlet, and loved it! Super refreshing, would recommend. My favorite part of the restaurant was the women's restroom. There was someone serving pink champagne and a small loungey area with very comfortable couches / chairs. Definitely could have spent most of my night there, as it was pretty social with women hanging out with their friends there.

If you can get on a list or reservation- that's the way to go. Coming from Chicago- I didn't know what expect. It was nice to go to that side of town and enjoy the chandelier setting rooms and strong drinks. The bartenders are really friendly and it's a fun lounge/club environment.

The bathroom is probably the most beautiful bathroom I've ever seen at a restaurant. There was even champagne service in the bathroom. It is definitely a must see! To start, I got the beauty elixir and my friend got the emerald gimlet. Both drinks were so fruity and delicious and strong too. The restaurant is tapas style with small plates to share. Our server recommended we order about 4-5. We got the steak tartare, foie gras (no longer on the menu), Thai shrimp, and the garganelli pasta. The Thai shrimp was my favorite by far. The shrimp were cooked to perfection, so crunchy on the outside and succulent on the inside. The sauce was super delicious, sweet and savory with a little tang. A must have! The steak tartare was also super delicious, my second favorite. I really liked the crispy rice that the tartare was served over. The foie gras and pasta were also very good, but the shrimp was definitely the star of the meal.Great food, great drinks, great service, great decor!

5.0,11/12/2015,"New American small plate dining at its very best.  A fabulous overall experience starting from the curb, where the ""front"" for the restaurant is a fully operating pawn shop (see photos posted).  Behind the innocuous white door at the rear of the pawn shop is beautifully appointed multi-level restaurant with a contemporary speakeasy feel.  Clubby vibe, very social buzz with lots of happy young 20, 30 and 40-somethings chatting it up to a near roar, and clearly without concerns about the impending steep bill.  Very nice bar/lounge to start things off.That aside, the five stars come right out of their kitchen under the direction of celeb chef and co-owner, Chris Santos.  Our group agreed the highlight was the sliced ribeye steak.  The quality of the beef was beyond compare and something you just can't buy from a retailer.  I believe they source their beef from Pat LaFrieda out of Jersey, but I may be wrong.  Nevertheless, I've can't recall ever tasting steak so tender and flavorful with only artisan salt and smoked pepper applied (yes, I asked).  The tuna, oysters, bone marrow, baby back ribs,and empanadas had eyes rolling (in a good way!), and the chicken meatballs were a monster hit and a heavenly surprise to all.Our waiter, Nathan, was very attentive, extremely knowledgeable, and very willing to provide answers to my (very likely) annoying questions about ingredients, food sources, operations, building info, etc.Don't forget to make reservations and plan for a special and delicious dining experience.",4,1,0,David L.,"North Andover, MA",60,129,84

3.0,10/27/2015,"Beauty & Essex is definitely more of a girls night out kind of place. They have acceptable eye candy service, pink champagne in the ladies room after 5:30PM for a nominal tip of $1, great music, and sectioned off bar and dining. With a facade of a pawn shop leading to a trendy bar/dining place, Beauty & Essex was a delightful place to visit.I came here with the boyfriend. I wasn't feeling well so that might have affected my experience. But we had a relatively early reservation at 5:00PM and they don't seat until 5 on the dot. So we grabbed a drink in the bar area and lounged on the couches to pass the time. Settle the bar tab as soon as possible so the maitre'd doesn't stand there awkwardly as you whip out your card and wait for the transaction to happen. I just wish we could have been brought to our table and also settled the tab or something. The food was good. The cheese & tomato dumplings were tasty. The soup was hot and the bite size spoonfuls were welcoming. There isn't much to write home about the ribs. They weren't even hot, let alone warm. The uneven numbers of spoonfuls, ribs, and pieces of food in each dish made me wonder how they decided on these amounts. I heard it's possible to request the entree or app to have an even amount of pieces for your party, so like if you had 6 people, and there are only 5 ribs, they will throw in an extra rib.  The drinks were expensive but tasty, playfully named but rightfully strong. If I had some kind of celebration there I'd throw more money at the bar for drinks, but unfortunately as a first time kind of thing I was more refined and kept the dollar bills in my wallet for a go at the champagne. The Sapphire Seventy-Five was fruity ""blueberry-brown sugar Bombay Sapphire, prosecco, Thomaso's sour mix"" and The Woodsman ""Woodford Reserve bourbon, allspice dram, maple syrup, lemon, muddled pears"" was a big boys kind of drink. $17 per drink and $12+ for tapas plates, guess you gotta pay for that chic and sleek, especially with all the lotions, hairsprays, and perfumes in the ladies room.

The food was delicious - the beef tartare and the chicken meatballs were our top choices. I could have eaten them all night - absolutely delicious. Our server was very nice, but what struck a negative cord was the pace he was trying to move us out of there. It was alarming - and, it isn't just him - I am sure the B&E management team encourages/requires the staff to turn tables as fast as possible. Normally, we order our dinner in stages, to avoid being rushed or served too soon. Our server said that the Chef prefers to have our entire order to best time the meal. That was a joke. There was no ""staging"" of the food. Everything came out almost all at once, or we had to take the last two bites off a plate in order to make room for entrees. It was ridiculous. But then, the worst happened. Our desserts had just been served, and we were taking the first bite when, and I kid you not, the server PLACED OUR CHECK ON THE TABLE! Seriously? This isn't an inexpensive place - $300 before tip for 2 people (and we each only had 1 drink and 1 was non-alcholic)...one would think that they would KNOW HOW TO APPROACH CUSTOMERS and HOW TO TIME THINGS in a place as nice as this. We were outraged. With that being said, I would go back, but with a different strategy.

5.0,10/18/2015,"In all honesty, I'll be thinking about our dinner at Beauty & Essex for awhile. Right next to the subway station, the front of the restaurant is a pawn shop that leads through to a dimly lit, sorta Gatsby-ish restaurant. We sat upstairs, a bit before the dinner rush. By 6, it was considerably filling up and by the time we left, it was nearly full. Our waiter was kind and had us order everything at once - little tapas and our entrees. Between the three of us, we ordered: grilled cheese & tomato dumplings, piquillo peppers on toast, eggplant pizetta, lobster Mac and cheese to start. For entrees, scallops, Essex burger and lobster tacos. It sounds like a lot, but portions are modest and we ate nearly everything with room for the Elvis sundae. If you're hungry, the Essex burger was definitely the best value. Huge bunch of fries that were deliciously seasoned and a juicy burger. All together, it hit around $160. The food was incredible and the ambiance of the restaurant was second to none. Lockets everywhere, sexy lighting, the whole thing.",1,0,0,Kate B.,"Tallahassee, FL",228,193,353
3.0,10/18/2015,"I'm so torn about giving this places 3 stars or should I give it 4. I feel like Beauty and Essex is a solid 3.5. Positive points- Fist off there is FREE champagne in the ladies room, which is pretty awesome. - It is absolutely beautiful inside, regardless of where your eyes wander of to, you will be pleased with what you see. - The waiter was quick and very kind. Negative points- They don't seat you until your entire party is there. We had a party of 9, but 2 were running late. I don't understand why they couldn't have brought us to our table with just 2 people missing. - PRICEY and tiny portions. I spend ~$110 and that was just my part splitting it with a large party. Drinks had here: Beauty Elixir - Sweet and refreshing. I ordered this one twice! Food: Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos: SO good, at first I was wondering how a raw meat taco would taste but they were delicious. 5/5Crab Rangoon: Another great pic! Crispy cracker with the delicious crab on top. 5/5Crispy Eggplant Pizzeta: Very tasty, the only issue was that some pieces were a bit soggier than others. 3/5Guanciale Pork Pizzeta: Y-E-S. SO Good, crispy crust throughout, great flavorful pork and sauce. 5/5Chicken Meat Balls: I would say skip this. Very bland. Our large group kept passing the last meat ball around. 1/5Thai Style Deep Fried Shrimp: Super huge shrimps covered in a delicious sweet sauce. I loved this one the most. The textures felt right (crispy outside soft inside) and the flavors just blew my mind. 5/5Ravioli (cant remember what was the filling): Good but for a place like this I expected more. 3/5BBQ Fries: My biggest disappointment. I thought they were good, like McDonald's good but with a 1000% mark up. 1/5Lobster Mac - N - Cheese: Tasty, very well done with the crispy top and soft noodles. The cheese sauce was on point! 5/5Desserts:Pumpkin tart: Tasty, it came with a scoop of ice cream and caramel sauce. 4/5Box of Donuts: Too average, so average i split a tiny one with a friend because I didn't care to add on the calories for something that wasn't that great. 2/5Averaging at 3.54 (yes I did some maths).

The dining room is perfectly lit with dim chandeliers and candlelight. The dinner options are meant for sharing and did not disappoint. We ordered little neck clams, oysters, pan seared scallops, tuna, pressed jerk chicken, crab Rangoon, and grilled cheese with tomato soup. All items were delicious and well portioned.The service was great. I appreciate that he told us in advance that sharing items come with three servings, and you may order an additional fourth portion if that suits your group. Additionally, I asked if the meatballs contained breadcrumbs and he inquired if I was gluten free and then brought a separate gluten free menu. It was incredibly helpful to know what was gluten free- which was a surprisingly large amount of menu items.The bathrooms were well-appointed with flattering lighting and flattering mirrors, which I always appreciate!

My girlfriend found a Groupon somewhere and had been wanting to go, so we went on a Saturday morning. We shared four dishes: the lemon ricotta blackberry pancakes, the lobster hash, the fried chicken biscuits, and the mini cupcakes. The pancakes were some of the best I've ever had. They were the perfect texture, and the lemon flavor worked well with the sweetness of the syrup. I would go back here just to have the pancakes again. The lobster hash sounded interesting and didn't disappoint. I love potatoes for breakfast, and these were made with an interesting blend of ingredients. Would definitely recommend them. The fried chicken biscuits were good, and the slaw worked well with the richness of the fried chicken and biscuits. The only slight complaint I would have is that because the biscuits were small, they weren't very warm by the time they were served. We finished the meal with Guinness and red velvet mini cupcakes.

The other staff members were incredibly attentive as well, clearing our table as soon as we finished each plate and constantly refilling our waters. And, of course, the food was just amazing. We ordered the lobster tacos, lobster mac & cheese, the philly pretzel, and the tomato soup dumplings. All of which were A++. I especially loved the lobster mac & cheese. It was absolutely perfect. I'll most definitely be coming back to try the other plates on the menu!!",0,0,1,Sue K.,"Villa Park, CA",2,3,0

4.0,9/9/2015,"This place is awesome. Hidden behind a pawnshop, this speakeasy-esque restaurant really takes you to another place. The lush decor definitely sets your expectations high for the food that was about to come. We had the bone marrow which was fantastic. The fattiness was nicely cut by the accoutrements. The steak tartare was delicious as well...something that really makes you go ""wow"". We were disappointed by the foie gras as we thought it was a bit too sweet. The empanadas were pretty standard and we could have done without them. The Chipotle Duck Chilaquiles were pretty much just nachos...but tasty. The chicken meatballs were okay but could have used something more. We finished with the donuts and they were a fun end to the meal because the presentation was amusing- they came out in a long rectangular box that made them look like a present. They were a bit too sweet for me, but my boyfriend enjoyed them. So in the end, the food did live up to the expectations for the most part but it is the environment that will keep me coming back.",0,0,0,Michelle T.,"Jersey City, NJ",58,27,22

I think it's a great place to come with girlfriends and have a good time. oh! and starting at 8 pm, they serve champagne in the ladies room...the dishes are tapas style and my friend and I were hangry so we ended up ordering too much food however it was worth it.we started with the half dozen oysters which was a good portion. then got the lobster tacos and tuna sashimi. the lobster tacos were by far my favorite thing and the lobster was a good sized portion, the tuna sashimi had a kick to it from the jalapeño on top which kind of overwhelmed the tuna. next we had the spaghettini and onion rings, the spaghettini wasn't what we expected, we thought the noodles were going to be the zucchini regardless it was pretty good. the onion rings were a little too salty for my taste but the crispness was on point. we ended with the chicken meatballs which was really good, I wish we had this before the spaghettini, cuz the pasta filled me up that I wasn't able to enjoy the meatballs. we washed everything down with a bottle of rose.overall, the experience was wonderful, service was good. most of the plates were excellent and the price wasn't too bad.",0,0,0,Jessica K.,"New York, NY",355,1093,842

4.0,9/2/2015,Been waiting to try this place for awhile now and what perfect time than a birthday dinner. The pawn shop frontage is cool chic with the bouncer at the far end of the door. The woman behind the pawn shop furthers the allusion although it does look like you can purchase if so desired.Passing through the rabbit hole bring you inside another world. A cuisine playground. The interior is transitional modern. The stairs bring you up onto a second floor of beautiful people all laughing and drinking at the bar. The comfortable banquettes lets you watch the surroundings.The food is on par with the ambiance and service. Top notch. Most are small portions to share.

2.0,9/1/2015,"Beauty and Essex is just a pretty face with no personality.This is a total girl fest. Mostly large groups of girls or people on dates. It's definitely geared toward women.The entrance is the pawn shop. Just go to the big door in the back. I addressed the women standing at the pawn shop cashier and they gave an attitude that said ""duh, just go on in the restuarant"". Well excuse me! It was my first time and I was just trying to be nice.Inside the restaurant, the service is not much better. The host was fine, but the bartender was not friendly and acted as if I was taking up his time by ordering my drink. And he made my drink without any care and even just mixed it in the glass that it was served in. Um, what? $17 for a shitty cocktail? Oh hell no.And they don't let you transfer your check to the table, so I had to close out at the bar when my friend came. And the hostess makes sure that you close out. It's a very awkward and annoying situation.Our server was fine, no complaints there. The food was pretty much overpriced bar food. For the price, the quality should be better, but I think you're just paying for the decor here. We had the burger, bone marrow, and dumplings. The dumplings are really just some puff pastry with cheese sauce and tomato soup. The bone barrow and burger were fine, just overpriced for the quality that you actually get.Finally, the free sparkling wine in the bathroom is an awkward setup.

3.0,8/29/2015,"I love the speakeasy concept, where the facade is a vintage looking antique and operating accessory store which I bought a pair of earrings from. It was surprisingly easy to get into on a Thursday night at around 9pm. It was little loud in there but maybe that's just me getting old. Definitely don't go there if you're looking to have a catch up with a friend. You'll end up drained screaming at the top of your lungs. Food was pretty good but prices here for both food and drinks are a wee bit high for the small portions and limited variety of drinks. You have to get early to find a seat, which is much faster than waiting for a table for dinner. I wasn't impressed with anything else except the speakeasy concept and decor. It's good that they have two stories though, makes for more space than usual micro sized bar restaurants. Music was good though. Old school rnb jams.

Two of us shared: one bottle of sparkling Chandon (crisp & lightly sweet bubbly), 4 savory dishes and 1 sweet dish which included: Lemony ricotta pancakes - DELICIOUS my favorite! Fresh, sweet, perfect combination of ingredients on upping the boring pancake.Cheesy bacon dumplings w/tomato soup - tangy veggie tasting broth, but the dumpling was the rockstar- smoky and melty, you really just want to keep eating these. The broth was lukewarm, only downside.Huevos Rancheros - moist and flavorful shredded beef cupped with a perfect egg yolk and beans- yumLobster & chorizo hash- paired well with the egg yolk from the Huevos rancheros, but alone it was not as flavorful as it appeared to be.

The restaurant itself is huge and really nicely decorated. The ambient lighting gives the restaurant a warm and romantic feel, but it's a great place for any occasion. The food was excellent as well. They recommend sharing plates tapas style, which I second. Unfortunately our table was too big to split dishes, but every dish I tried was delicious and I would want to try a bit of everything. The lobster mac and cheese was amazing. The portion looks a bit smaller than other dishes, but it's extremely creamy and filling. The bone marrow was great as well. It's definitely one of the most unique dishes I've experienced. The bone marrow is cooked and used as a spread for toast. It's extremely savory and great as an appetizer. Drinks are pricey, but they're strong. I got the melon mojito and whew, what a drink. We also got the frozen margarita dessert shots and they were delicious though not strong.

5.0,8/24/2015,"Our tourguide Patch planned out our extravagant NYC weekend for us. He said he had reservations at this hot restaurant, and our reservation was a midnight. When Gster and I gawked at the time, he said, ""it's NYC. The city never sleeps!"" and claimed it was totally normal to be eating this late. We met at 8 for drinks, and went to bars around the area until dinner. When we met up with his friends, they exclaimed the same as us.... but they were all from NYC. Our tourguide led us to believe that eating at NYC was so normal... just another inconsistency with our trip with him. However, at this point, we were a few drinks in, ordering apps, and ready for this delicious meal. Quite a few drinks later, and approaching midnight, we went to B+E. I do wish that I hadn't drunken as much so I have more recollection of the evening, but from what sticks in my memory, I am in love. I kept asking Patch to bring me to somewhere ""cool"" where you go through a backdoor to a backdoor to a restaurant. B+E you have to go through a Pawn shop on the street to get to the restaurant! This is what I am talking about! That's one thing our tourguide did fulfill. Upon entering, there is a beautiful, grand staircase. You imagine that a princess, or a celebrity will come down at any moment, which they might since celebs are known to frequent here. In the middle of the stairwell is the most stunning chandelier I have ever seen, with diamonds/gems that cascade down, the length of the entire stairwell, and lit by a ring of bright lights in a circle at the top. It is stunning. We got drinks at the bar downstairs. Each room is unique, with a different feel. Some are dark, some are sexy ,some are chic, young... it really just depends where you are. Regardless, everything is high class, with intricate decorating, and even if you are the type of people like us that can only get a midnight reservation, you still feel like you might be in the midst of papparazzi any moment. It is a magical feeling, that gives your heart a flutter. I liked it.We had a large party, and the restaurant is tapas style. We ordered lots more wine, lots more expensive drinks. It felt like we were the special guests of the evening. Due to our large number of people, we ordered several different tapas. While I don't remember all of them, I remember that A. they were all delicious, with SO much flavor  B. the presentation was very gourmet, chic and artistic C. the grilled cheese was the best I had in my life!Given our midnight reservations, the extravagant elegance of the restaurant, the draping chandelier, the hidden doorway... everything and the whole experience made me feel like I was a modern NYC Cinderella.

5.0,8/18/2015,"This past July, I had my birthday boozy brunch party here during their Sunday Champagne Brunch party that runs from 1pm-6pm. I can't say enough about how happy I am that I chose Beauty & Essex to have my celebration! I don't normally do reviews, but this definitely deserves one. From the initial planning to the very end, everything went so smoothly. I worked with Amanda, one of the event coordinators, and she was very helpful and explained all the packages that they offered in great detail. I had a party of about 30 people so you can imagine my nerves in making sure we got the best available deal for a successful brunch party that everyone would enjoy. So on to the details..- Considering how large my group was, we were able to sit up in their Pearl Lounge. It was a great and intimate space to have everyone together. - We paid $55/person + tax and tip. That price included a 7 course family style brunch and 2 glasses of champagne for a 2.5 hr seating time. - EVERY SINGLE course was absolutely delicious! Everyone loved the food! Chocolate croissants, eggplant pizzeta, tomato soup dumplings, chicken and waffles, lobster tacos, red velvet cupcakes etc! All amazing!- And as for the drinks, let's just say they aren't stingy with the champagne. ;) We also purchased a bottle for our table, so that may have helped, but by the end of the brunch party, everyone in my group was full and feeling good. The only thing about the brunch party was that it wasn't easy trying to eat off small cocktail tables all while drinking and dancing, but our server, Katrina, was an absolute doll! She was so sweet! She made sure I was aware of all the courses that were coming out and that I was able to eat while partying. OH, one thing that I was pleasantly surprised about was that my 6 year old nephew was able to come to brunch haha! I guess since it's during the day, it was ok? Either way, he had a great time (sans alcohol of course) and kept talking about ""the club"" for days after lol!The last thing that really stuck out to me was the moment we were all leaving. Prior to the event, I completed my contract with Amanda and opted to include my tip in the final payment cuz I knew I wouldn't be in any condition to calculate tip once i received the bill. Thankfully my fiancé took care of handling the bill, but he didn't know I had already included tip so he tipped even more on top of the grand total. Any place could have just seen that, been ecstatic that they just received an extra $500 tip and kept quiet. As we walked out, an employee, probably a manager, was kind enough to stop my fiancé and informed him that we extremely overpaid. A great gesture that unfortunately, most places won't do these days. It left a lasting impression to an already great birthday celebration! We'll definitely be back to have just good ol' brunch to sit and really enjoy the food!",3,0,0,Annaliza F.,"Rockaway, NJ",54,5,2

3.0,8/14/2015,"I came here for restaurant week, and I'm very sorry to say that I was disappointed. I've had this place bookmarked on yelp for a while and was very excited to finally be checking it out. To start off with the physical, the ambience is wonderful as well as how the interior is set up. Cozy booths, gorgeous main chandelier when you walk in, mini chandeliers above tables, and the stunning skylight in the main room were all exceptional. Not to mention the girls bathroom downstairs is amazing. (They serve you free champagne, how can anything get better than that) Now on to the food, because I came here for RW as I stated earlier, I had a choice of 3 appetizers, entrees, and dessert. I went with the tuna poke wonton tacos, the beauty & essex burger, and petite cupcakes. The tacos were my favorite part of the entire night. The tuna was delicious and fresh and the wonton shells complimented it so well, not to mention to line slices they give you to spritz on topped it all off. However, I was very disappointed in the burger, the bun was way too chewy and nothing stood out, I've had better burgers elsewhere- I couldn't get myself to finish it. The only good thing about the burger were the fries that came with it. Those barbecue fries were among the best fries I've ever had. I wished I could've just ordered a tub of fries instead of having the burger. Finally, the cupcakes were just standard cupcakes- they were moist and super cute. You get 2 red velvet and 2 chocolate. My friends got the crispy eggplant pizzetta which was amazing and the mousse and other desserts (I didn't taste their desserts so I can't review them) Lastly, the reason I gave this place 3 stars was because of service. I clearly noticed the lack of service my group was getting compared to all the other tables surrounding us. They did however do a good job of refilling our water glasses every time any waiter walked by. They leave you a big glass of water so you can refill it, but they refill it for you anyway. But my table seriously lacked service from the waiter that was assigned to us. For every 3 ""visits"" he went to all the other tables, we barely got one.

It took a good 45 minutes to get seated - we both ordered a drink at the bar area before we got to our dinner table. The area would have been nice to chill in for a bit, but our table became ready right after our drinks were brought out so we moved right away.Drinks - I had the beauty elixir (gin, cucumber strawberry, and sparkling rose), which was quite tasty. It also felt a bit stronger than what I was used to in Toronto. My friend wasn't feeling too well so she just had a non-alcoholic drink.Food - the menu was tapas style, so we ordered a few things to share, based on a recommendations from a friend. We had the smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings (pretty salty, but cool presentation), tuna wonton tacos (this was yummy, and probably my favourite), a pizzetta (nothing special), and tacos with sliced pork (a bit on the dry side). We also shared some oysters. Overall, I find the prices to be on the high side for what you're getting. We also ordered a bit more than needed for 2 people.The decor of the place is interesting - I would have liked more lighting but that is probably just a personal preference. The service was not bad (although I think some tables were more attended to) and the ambiance over all was good.

For 17 bucks for a dab of crab and a HUGE blob of mayo? Yuck! Really wasn't good at all and I have NO idea how this passed as a good meal?BBQ Fries- To die for. Def order. The drinks we ordered I can't remember.. something muddled with berry and it isn't on the menu anymore.. was tasty.. Also had a Vodka soda , strong, nothing special. The bar tenders on both floors were very nice.. and the one upstairs was very friendly.. again it was like prob 8pm on a thurs and the music wasn't even starting yet... the place was pretty dead. Although people had reservations and sat at the tables.. I remember the bar being 4 deep last time.. this time you had available seats.So fear not if you don't have a reservation... just go early!!!! 6pm!!!! you should be ok to least sit at the bar,, and enjoy a drink and try a few apps. overall nice experience. The girl at the door should smile more. She looked annoyed. But was ok. =)",0,0,0,L K.,"Manhattan, NY",7,37,0
3.0,8/11/2015,"I was very excited to go to Chris Santos' restaurant for the first time!  I also liked the fact that I would be able to do Restaurant Week and give to a good cause. Certain unique and fascinating highlights were the entrance through the pawn shop and the restroom complimentary champagne! As I waited for my cousin to arrive I had a cocktail at the bar.  I choose the Electric Avenue. It was very good and perfect to get my tastebuds ready for some foodie fun! I figured anything with Bulleit and Campari as some of the ingredients has to be good. When we checked in, my phone number was confirmed so I could be texted when the table was ready. It was funny that we waited 20 minutes for our reservation but we were told all party members must be together to be seated and only a 15 minute wait window for any missing members.After we were seated were presented with a watermelon gazpacho. It was tasty but I can't say I liked it. We decided we would order different items and share, after all this is a Tapas themed place. With the Restaurant Week menu we were each able to order one appetizer, main and dessert item each. We shared Chile Rellano Empandas and Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos for appetizer.  Spaghettini and Pressed Jerk-Spiked Chicken for main. Petite Cupcakes and Vanilla Panna Cotta for dessert.The empandas were not anything special and the fried taste was too strong. The tacos were YUMMY, we wished there were more. The flavors were so bright and stimulated the palate.The Spaghettini was fantastic. It had zucchini,  lemon, parsley pesto, parmigiano and a sunny side egg on top. The yolk perfectly oozed over the bright herbaceous noodles and was perfection! The chicken was tasty but the chicken skin was not crispy and when the flabby skin hit the tongue it was a turn off.The cupcakes were very dry and did not meet the expectations of description. There were 2 each of red velvet cake and cream cheese frosting/Guinness cake and Bailey's frosting. The Vanilla Panna Cotta was EXCELLENT! The mouth feel was perfect. The raspberry gelee topping was a bit too acidic.I had the Pink Panther cocktail to have with dessert and really enjoyed. The gin was enhanced by the pink peppercorns in a very unique way. I can't remember the other ingredients but it was very good. My cousin had gone to the ladies room a few times and she reported back that it was a must before we left because the lounge had a bar with complimentary champagne. We people watched and had a flute of champagne to end a fun culinary experience. Sadly when I requested to keep the restaurant week menu I was denied. I have never been denied this keepsake at any of the other restaurants I have gone to so it was disappointing!",2,0,0,Maryanne D.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,110,341
5.0,8/11/2015,"Came here for restaurant week and at first I couldn't find it, but then I realized you have to go through a little antique shop to actually get to the restaurant. That was a cool experience in itself, but then you open the back door and are transported into a beautifully elegant space which you never want to leave. There are no windows in the restaurant, but the giant egg shaped skylight in the ceiling provides just the perfect amount of light. The restaurant week menu did not disappoint. My tuna tacos were overstuffed and since there were 3 on the plate, I was able to let my husband have one (just one though). Entrees were well portioned. Glad I had the Jerk Chicken because my husband's burger and fries that fell from heaven was just giant. I will say that I like a little more spice to my Jerk Chicken, but I would definitely order it again. My panna cotta dessert was the perfect finish.

Beauty & Essex fit the bill with it's locale, extensive and creative selection, and just overall awesomeness. Some of the items on the menu may seem a bit unexpected, but you just have to trust the creative minds of the chefs, because all the flavors work.

The portions are small and looked like they were just thrown on the plates and not wiped because sauces were dripping on my shirt as the staff served food over my shoulders without once saying EXCUSE ME even though I kindly asked them too. had it not been a celebratory meal for my nephew's birthday I would have ""went off"".When people are dropping $618.41 before tipping which was an extra $100. Your waiter as well as staff should be way more attentive and courteous to guests.FOOD: Nothing special about it.

The bathroom was on-point (many people in there were taking photos) and well-decorated. Delicious Tapas: 1)Lox with bagels. The salmon was fresh and delicious, and the bagels perfectly toasted. Capers and spiced tomatoes added a wonderful touch. 2) Red Velvet Waffles. Enough Said.3) Lobster Tacos. Also enough said. Perfectly complementary sauce. Mediocre Tapas: Fried Chicken Benedict.

Upscale, classy, intimate, rosè in the women's bathroom....I can't take anything away from the ambience.To start we had the eggplant pizzette and the tuna wontons. The pizzette lacked some love, maybe a dash of salt or red pepper could have elevated the dish. The wontons were fresh and light. Our server suggested we also try the grilled cheese dumplings and I'm so glad we did. The grilled cheese melts in your mouth. It's butter, it's cheese, it's heaven rolled into one bite.For our entrees we had the jerk chicken and the burger. The chicken had a nice kick to it. I wasn't thrilled with the burger but those fries were damn addicting. Finally dessert was the cupcakes and the panna cotta. I'm not a huge fan of dessert but the red velvet cupcakes were pretty good, and who doesn't like red velvet anyway?I left buzzed off of 2 drinks which says something about their mixology skills.

All of these items had a high-quality taste and their presentation was impressive.Cons--The seating was a little cramped.

They were blasting 90's hip hop music which didn't really seem to fit the restaurant theme, but I didn't mind too much.

After we were seated, it took over 15 minutes for us to be acknowledged by a waiter. We had to ask the busboy to call a waiter. The waiter did not introduce himself and was disinterested the entire time he served us. We ordered a bottle of wine with our dishes. At the end of our meal, the waiter dropped the check on the table, without asking us if we wanted dessert or anything more. He also did not finish pouring us all the wine from the bottle we ordered. We had to ask for a dessert menu and for the remainder of the bottle to be poured. He never apologized. Service was terrible and I would have understood if the restaurant was packed, but it was not.

5.0,8/2/2015,"Wow! Wow! Did I say wow?! I absolutely loved this place. Came here for the first time to try it during restaurant week. This is a hidden gem tucked behind a pawn shop. Once you pass the pawn shop you enter pure luxury. From the gorgeous marble staircase leads you up to second floor bar, lounges and another dinning area. It also has a very impressive chandelier hanging from the ceiling. One of the first things you see when entering. Two key items I remember to be my favorite. The ribs and melon mojitos!!! Had a few mojitos that evening and was feeling super happy by the end of the evening. We had a 7:30 reservation but did not get seated until 8ish. But it was ok because we got to explore the two floors and two bars which have plenty of seating lounge area. I am sure later in the evening it is very busy and you won't be able to count on the seating in the lounge sections. We ordered the following: tuna poke tacos very fresh and flavorful, chile relleno empanadas which were not so spicy but very tasty. I love the crunchy feel of the empanadas. Not overly cooked but enough to be crispy. Grilled salmon dish for entree and the ribs which are on the main menu. To die for try them and thank me later. Very flavorful, huge portions ribs for tapa style. Topped it off with pans cotta and strawberry moose cups. We couldn't finish all our food and definitely had left overs. The room we were seated in reminded me of a green room. There was a ceiling window that revealed greenery on the roof. Gave it a magic appeal to a very large room that would otherwise be enclosed. Be prepared to spend some $$$ regularly as drinks themselves were $17 each. It's definitely a great time for girls night out and the food was to impress. I will be back and soon.

Desserts were strawberry mousse and panna cotta which were fine. Extra star for being such an interesting space. Definitely played the tourist here bc I'm not cool enough otherwise. Storefront is a real pawn shop maybe and you have to go thru the door in the wall like a speakeasy and opens into this massive dark über cool space with a skylight. Servers were all so cool too. Fun to people watch. But friendly. Seating is pretty tight so get cozy with strangers. Booze always helps. Savory cocktails are still sweet - had something with Campari pearls and thyme.

I had a taste and I have to admit they were really very good! I had the Lamb - excellent! The scallops??? Among the very best.  Finally - we got there pretty late and the entire restaurant was fast becoming a high energy night club.  I let the waiter know that we needed move quickly through this meal (most ppl were casually dining (partying really - straight shots at the table etc) and socializing - my wife and I would've had a blast with some friends, but it wasn't a good scene for my teenage daughters and I) and he was very accommodating and understanding.  He put our orders ahead of others,  paired a great wine with my lamb and made for a very enjoyable meal for us.

Even better than Stanton Social now in comparison and they are sister restaurants. Now that says a lot. I fell in love with everything at Stanton Social. Now coming to Beauty and Essex, just wow!!! What an amazing place. Tucked behind the pawn shop is the restaurant and bar. Wow so innovative. As soon as you pass the large white door, you are mesmerized by the decor and ambiance. It is very chic and sleek. It reminds me of a modern speakeasy. I love it. I met up with my best friend for a ladies night out. We wanted to try this place for some time, so why not during restaurant week. We snagged a coveted table for 2 at prime dinner time and we were ecstatic. Originally the rsvp was for 3 people at 7:30pm, but they were very accomodating when we changed the rsvp to just 2. We checked in and the very nice hostess said if you would like to have a drink at the bar, the table will be ready soon and we will text you. So we did. We ventured upstairs passed the amazing chandelier and the spiraling staircase to a very nice bar and lounge area. We snagged a couch across from the bar. Score. We took a gander at the wine and cocktail menu. The melon mojito caught our eyes. So once the waitress came around we ordered a round. Pow . . . were these mojitos strong. Great mixologist. We didnt even finish half of the drink, when she got a text that our table was ready. I went downstairs to let them know we were closing the tab and we would come downstairs. The hostess took us to our table. I love the decor. There are beautiful chandeliers all around the restaurant. They even have a glass dome above the main dining room. It is very spacious. They have a smaller dining room upstairs. Very beautiful. We both looked at the restaurant week menu and looked at the regular menu. There were certain items that we couldn't pass up. So my best friend and I ordered each a different dish for app, entree and dessert to share, even with the tapas style from the restaurant week menu. We ordered for apps the chile relleno and the tuna tacos. Omg were they delicious oh so good. As for the entree we ordered the jerk chicken with polenta and the salmon with grapefruit. Plus she wanted to order the baby back ribs with hush puppies and black pepper butter. Once again deliciousness on a plate. The jerk chicken had just the right amount of heat and the polenta was oh so creamy. The salmon was cooked to perfection and was fresh. The grapefruit added a lightness to the dish that cannot be replicated. Omg we were so happy. The baby back ribs were so good, fall off the bone good. They were so juicy and well seasoned. Amazing. It was so much food that my friend took a doggy bag home. The ribs were so good that I took an order to go. Delicious. All throughout the night we ordered more melon mojitos. The first one we ordered from the waiter was a lil sweet for our liking. So my friend asked if they could make the mojito a lil stronger since the bartender upstairs was on point with the mojito. The staff was so accomodating. They were great. The next round of mojitos were now on point and stronger. They brought us our desserts. We ordered the panna cotta and the strawberry mousse cups. So decadent and rich. So flavorful and just what we needed to end the night right. Once again amazing. Did I say the ambiance was great. The music was awesome. All that we needed was a dance floor. R&b old school beats. And I got to see Executive Chef Chris Santos across the dining room relaxing and enjoying the night as well. What a plus. For those who do not know who Chef Chris Santos is, he is a judge on the Food Network show Chopped and Executive chef at both Stanton Social and Beauty & Essex. Oh and another thing. They were serving champagne in the ladies room. What?! Who has ever heard of that. Their were even loungy chairs and couches for you to sit on. Just wow. Such an incredible night.

The eggplant pizzetta was also delicious - simple, flavorful, not too greasy.  The food is decently priced - a bit expensive, but it's well prepared and nicely presented.

I found the menu a little bit difficult to pick from at first because it's difficult to work out what to expect from the descriptions at times but everything I've ordered has always been fantastic, I have not had one thing I didn't like. My favourites are the tuna wonton tacos, Brussel sprouts and ham on toast (sounds strange but seriously, go with it) and the pork pizetta. The doughnuts for desert are also so good. I love that they take reservations and are pretty good at honouring the time.

Honestly, I just think we were too big of a group to be there anyways, but the place is really nice.Perfect to go with a small group of friends. Drinks were great, expensive, but nothing out of the ordinary for being a bar in Manhattan. The appetizers that we ordered came out really quickly and they were tasty (I ordered at the bar).

This last May, Beauty and Essex was on this list. I had made a reservation for 1 on a Sunday at 7. I realized earlier in the day I wasn't going to make my reservation so I called to cancel and then asked if they serve dinner at the bar. Whoever answered the phone said yes. I arrived around 8 and the restaurant was very active. I sat at the bar and ordered a glass of wine and the lamb chops. As I was waiting, I asked the bartender if they served bread, I was starving, and he said yes. He then turned to the female bartender to enter bread into the computer and she told him they don't serve bread. Then she called him back and said to charge me a dollar. Really, for bread. Here I sat with an $18 glass of wine and a $39 plate of lamb chops and they want to treat me like a vagrant with a glass of water filling up on their bread, which was grilled bread, no butter, no oil, no pesto, just dry grilled bread. It all worked out as I noted on the credit card slip that I generally tip over 20%, but since they charged me a buck for bread, they were getting a mere 15% tip less the $1. Their poor service saved me money. Will I go back again? Absolutely, the lamb chops were delicious, and it's as if they're discounted when they charge you for bread.

5.0,7/4/2015,"Nuts and bolts: we drank the Oaxacan Old Fashioned ($16), The Woodsman ($16), and the Telluride ($16), and ate the Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos ($16). Went here on a first date for cocktails and an appetizer, late on a Tuesday night. We were seated immediately, and the service was warm and intuitive. The server (whose name, I believe, was Adam) gave excellent suggestions, knew the menu perfectly, and was generally totally lovely. My Oaxacan Old Fashioned blew my mind--spicy, refreshing, and utterly surprising, not at all sweet. Don't be dissuaded by the chocolate bitters; I suspect they're to balance the mezcal, not to actually make the drink chocolatey. Neither of us were a fan of the Woodsman but we generally both dislike non-dry drinks. The Telluride was quite good, and recommended to anyone who likes an Old Fashioned but wants to think a little harder. At Adam's suggestion we had the tuna tacos, and we were not disappointed. The ambience was gorgeous. In the large room, there is a glassed window on the ceiling covered in plants. There was complementary sparkling rose in the ladies' bathroom. Every detail is considered and carried out completely. Full of beautiful people, mostly younger. We were the last people there (so, so sorry, but it was an excellent date!) and they didn't rush us in the least. TLDR: if you like Mezcal or tequila, order the Oaxacan Old Fashioned.

I can't remember what drink I had, but it was served in a glass that made me feel like I was on the set of Mad Men. Once we were seated, we started with the chile empanadas. They were crispy and well-done on the outside, a little too much for my taste, but the inside was a rich and creamy chile paste. Then, we had the panko-crusted onion rings, the seared tuna, and the chicken meatballs. Keep in mind that these are very, very small plates, so one small plate between two people isn't really enough. Even with what we ordered, and I felt like we ordered quite a bit, we didn't leave feeling overly stuffed. There were 4 empanadas about the size of a mini deck of cards, three chicken meatballs a little smaller or roughly the size of golfballs, 5-6 slices of tuna, about the size of a dollar coin, and 6-7 onion rings--normal size.

Don't have many complaints besides it being more expensive than I'd like. I would definitely come back again though.",2,0,0,Betty B.,"Flushing, NY",388,110,181
5.0,6/15/2015,Did not expect such a huge space inside after going through the pawn shop. Very nice atmosphere with cool decoration. Cocktails are very very good and subtile - perfect way to wait for your table! Food is also great. Portions are a little bit small but with 5 plates for 4 we were good. We really enjoyed the chicken and the tacos which have multiple different spices/herbs tastes.My only regret is the crowd: Noisy and not very chic while the environment could be taken as an upscale one. Would not go for a romantic diner. More for a friends night out.,0,0,0,Marine G.,"New York, NY",61,39,0

2.0,6/11/2015,"Yes, Beauty and Essex is beautiful. Yes, it's a ""scene."" No, it's not a good bar. (This review is only for the bar since we didn't eat there.) A friend and I came here on a Monday night for a couple of drinks after dinner. It certainly looks like it should be good, but alas, I was pretty disappointed. I had the Sapphire Seventy-Five (blueberry-brown sugar Bombay Sapphire, prosecco, Thomaso's sour mix), which was mediocre. For my second drink, I departed from the menu and ordered a Tom Collins, which is a classic gin cocktail that's actually pretty simple to make if you know what you're doing. I find it to be a good litmus test at cocktail bars, however, because so many places get it wrong. Let me just say that this Tom Collins was undrinkable. In fact, calling it a Tom Collins is a complete misnomer. I have no idea what it was, but it wasn't that. I never send drinks back, but in this case, I did. I asked for a gin and tonic instead, and to be honest, that wasn't much better.I will say that we experienced some good people-watching here, though. If you want to see women wearing party attire and tottering around in 5-inch heels on a Monday night, this is the place to be.  Beauty and Essex definitely falls into the ""looks can be deceiving"" category.",0,3,0,Leslie G.,"Brooklyn, NY",129,278,28
4.0,6/10/2015,"I was worried about taking out of town guests here since some reviews mentioned rude staff or waiting for ages with a reservation. Thankfully my experience on a Friday night was amazing. It can't be beat for atmosphere and experiences like the free champagne in the ladies' room (let's hear it for bring in back the ladies' lounge!). Everyone from the hostess to the wait staff and even the manager where actually exceptionally pleasant, helpful , and good at their jobs. We were seated immediately with our Open Table reservation and I was glad to see this place has entrees since I'm not really a fan of tapas but a lot of reviews made it sound like it was tapas only. My pasta was a little dry but everyone else seemed to enjoy their meat and seafood based entrees. This seems like a good place for birthday dinners, showers, etc bc it has that special feel. Will definitely be going back. Oh, and the box of donuts seems boring but when it arrived I nearly died. SO GOOD.

5.0,6/9/2015,"Second Yelp review ever but well worth it. I hosted a bachelorette party brunch for my friend here last weekend. I've been here for dinner before (loved it) but never for brunch. Usually, restaurants skimp of breakfast/brunch food. In comparison to Bagatelle which charges $250 minimum spend per person, B&E's $55 champagne brunch seemed insanely cheap, so I assumed it would lack a little in quality.It did not. This was the last even of many that we attended during the bachelorette weekend and it was the best. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. The food was unreal and you get a LOT. The DJ was playing great party music. They hand out glow sticks and necklaces. The brunch comes with 2 glasses of champagne each but let's just say they aren't stingy with it. They also have sparklers and personalized signs for birthdays, bachelorettes etc, which was a special surprise I wasn't expecting.Also, Lily was our waitress and she gets special props, as taking care of a table of 14 is hard as it is, let alone with the party atmosphere.

4.0,6/6/2015,"I was in NYC for work and Beauty & Essex, which I know you may think is a cigar bar based off of the spectacular performance by James Spader in the Blacklist, passed what I consider to be the ultimate test - I went there twice in a week and did not get bored of the food.  Ostensibly, the most challenging part of the Beauty & Essex experience is finding the place.  If someone didn't tell me what to expect, I would have been screwed, but I'm not going to ruin the surprise for those of you that have yet to go. :)  Trendiness is ubiquitous throughout B&E, from the quasi speakeasy bar to the Meat Packing-esque restaurant portion.  The only issue I had with the ambience was the overly eclectic playlist; one song would be 1990's boy band the next would be mid-2000's hip hop, then it switch to Journey.  Other than that, great atmosphere.  The food was great, too - American-style tapas.  We had a lot of food both times, so forgive me for not remembering everything but the highlights were the grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings, lobster tacos, roasted bone marrow, lobster mac & cheese, and the bone-in ribeye.  The cocktails were spot-on, too, not Death & Co quality, but they certainly won't disappoint.Come prepared to spend $100 on dinner & drinks.",0,0,0,Chris P.,"Manhattan, NY",42,59,0

4.0,5/30/2015,"I'd heard of and always wanted to go eat at this place. So for my bestie's birthday I made reservations. Traffic was ridiculous and we ended up being about 30 mins late. I called to see if they could accommodate is. They said they'd keep the reservation in mind and work us back in when we arrived. That didn't happen. We waited over an hour. Which isn't entirely their fault, I know we were late. We had 2 bellinis at the bar for $30. They weren't that strong. When we got seated we were squeezed in next to two tables. That's fine, it's NYC. Unless you have a larger group...you get squeezed in. The entire gimmick is smaller plates meant for sampling and sharing. The choices were varied and all sounded appealing. We ordered quite a few different ones. Red velvet waffles and vanilla beignets were sweet and delicious. The Mac and cheese was okay. The lobster and chorizo hash was good too. The lobster tacos were her thing not mine, but reported to be tasty. The waitress wasn't particularly friendly,more task oriented, but knowledgable when we asked questions of her. The crowd was partly pretentious, but it's NYC so you roll your eyes and do your thing. The adornments inside were lovely! I live for the atmosphere and there were great photo ops. Both inside and in the pawn shop in front. Even outside the store front! I would return again, but not regularly. More of a once in a blue thing. A few plates for the two of us was about $200 including tips. So you be the judge for a ""Sunday brunch"" price.",0,0,0,Alyssa W.,"East Orange, NJ",6,34,4

She nailed it! The ambiance was exactly what I wanted especially considering it was a Monday night. The four of girls started at the bar and the front area knew we were ok for a while, and told us to let them know when we were ready for a table. We had multiple rounds of amazing specialty cocktails. The best one is an earl grey tea with vodka! Of course we made a trip or 2 to the bathroom during our few hours there. It's downstairs in their basement level. But nothing short of glam!! There's a champagne bar in the ladies bathroom, beautiful couches to hang out in and just absolutely beautiful decor that makes you want to linger... Now dinner: we were seated shortly after we let the front know we were ready to eat. We ordered a bunch of share plates and we ended up leaving out the little soup appetizers since we were unsure. They brought it out to us anyway! They were the cutest little minis and perfect teaser, done in 3 sips, compliments of the chef! All of our other tapas style plates were unique and delicious, no complaints anywhere. Service was top notch all around, from bartender to waiter and every hostess and bathroom bartender in between!

We had the tomato and cheese dumplings, Philly cheesesteak pretzels, tuna tacos, kale salad, chicken meatballs, bbq fries, doughnut and margarita shot. I had wine - which I didn't love the choices the waitress gave me. My husband stuck with virgin drinks and the peacock passion was delicious (as was the margarita shot). Of the food, it was really nothing special- best perhaps were the tuna tacos and the fries? In my opinion - if you want good tapas go to Stanton Social.

Our waitress was very attentive. The food is small plates/tapas style, and she recommended 5-6 plates for 2 people so we got 6. You have to try the grilled cheese plate!

Service was attentive and constantly checking out us (refilling the ice, removing dishes, etc.) Our only complaint was the DJ, ugh! He was awful!! There was no flow from one song to the next and it felt like was playing for himself. Someone in our group requested songs to be played but he had no idea who the artist were.

The location was questionable for me at first but once you walk in it's a hidden jewel.The initial walk in was weird for me since it has jewelry and other odds and ends for sale I guess. The old cash register was really neat but overall really cute and antique looking.After entering the 2 floor establishment, the stairs were really cute but dangerous to me based on the many drunk people I saw nearly falling trying to walk down the stairs but made good for group conversation lol . The chandelier was extremely beautiful which complimented the beaded chandelier in the adjacent room. The place was pretty crowded so wasn't enough room to move around or dance. The drinks are on the expensive side and depending on who you go to are worth it. I initially went to this lady who screwed up my Jack & Coke  but after telling the other bartender it sucked he made me another which was perfect .The place eventually thinned out and were able to dance.

Next up Lobster Tacos & Philly Pretzel Steak , I am not a fan of lobster but these tacos where amazing the beer batter gave it a nice taste.Philly Pretzel shaved NY strip w caramelized & Gruyere cheese , good piece of meat & the onions gave a nice sweet taste. Next the Grilled Salmon & Orange glazed Baby Carrots , this place had me really enjoying the seafood part of our menu Salmon was very good & so we're the Baby carrots.

4.0,4/28/2015,"This place was out of this world. Easily one of the top 5 meals of my life. We were a group of six, seated about 10 minutes after our 9:30 p.m. reservation. The food was simply AMAZING. Must try: 'Philly' Pretzel & Grilled cheese, smoked bacon, and tomato soup dumplings.You should also visit the ladies room for free champagne! It was so pretty, and the lighting was perfect for photos.The cons (reasons for 4 stars): Music was VERY loud -- drinks were just okay, nothing out of this world -- and our waiter said he saw me try to get his attention, but he couldn't come over because he was busy. For 15 minutes. WHAT?! Well, it is New York after all. Do NOT pass this place up.",0,0,0,Effie O.,"Foxboro, MA",90,29,4
5.0,4/28/2015,"I love this restaurant for both the food and the ambiance. Hosted a bachelorette party this past weekend and it was phenomenal!  Great food to share, and it's a fun atmosphere for a social event.  The tapas style menu gives enough options for various tastes, and everything was high quality.  Our waiter Ryan was fantastic (thanks for insisting we get the grilled cheese dumplings - you were right!), and the whole staff was very accommodating.  Some of the group ran late for our reservation, and they still helped us get seated as soon as everyone showed up, and it only took a few minutes.   I've been a few other times and always had a great experience, even once in August when the A/C broke in the upstairs area we'd reserved and we were sweating to death - they comped our b-day party group a bottle of champagne.  Things happen, and that's understandable as long as they do whatever is possible to ameliorate the inconvenience.  Overall, I give this restaurant the highest rating, particularly for a group outing, or a celebration. I would probably not recommend this as a first choice for a first date or romantic occasion, since it gets very loud and would be hard to hold an intimate conversation.",0,0,0,Erica M.,"Weehawken, NJ",82,22,0

1.0,4/26/2015,"Absolutely unacceptable experience. Made reservations for 6 upstairs for my friends bday. We arrived early and were waiting on out last guest to arrive. We checked in and confirmed that we were told we would have a table upstairs. Our friend arrives and we are then informed that upstairs is full and we must sit downstairs, which for a bday party brunch is a big deal. Upstairs is a fun party scene and downstairs is boring. We get to our table downstairs and are told ""your server is busy can we get you drinks"" ... We order wine & such & the. ""Are you ready to order food because we switch menus in 5 min""..   Excuses me??? Is this our fault? And still who is out server? Food was averageService was beyond below average drinks were not strongI ordered a $16 drink and tr bartender charged $17... Overall bad experience.

2.0,4/26/2015,The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous the details and the decor are stunning. I guess that would be the best part of the restaurant. The menu is pretty sad and simple especially the main courses and desserts. Our food literally came out after 7 min within ordering and I'm talking about main courses. We couldn't decide on anything so we just went for main course. The dinning experience is not worth the prices and food selection I would only recommend this place for cocktails and to lounge. I had high hopes for this place but the menu is a great loss for the place. It needs to be more innovative and concise or just keep it simple.

5.0,4/24/2015,"This place is great! Entry though the pawn shop is novel but makes the place easy to find! The hostesses were welcoming and friendly and we were quickly shown to our table. This place really is very ""cool"", interesting decor, a beautiful skylight, delicious cocktails and dance music playing you do worry if it's going to be more style over substance. We needn't have worried though as the food was amazing! Everything is to be shared and whatever you order arrives looking completely different to how you imagine it. Our waiter was more than happy to answer any questions and was very attentive throughout our visit. We had the Phili pretzels, the chicken meatballs, the lobster mac n cheese, the ribs and the carrots and BBQ fries on the side. Everything was so delicious, the lobster mac n cheese was luxuriously decadent, the ribs fell off the bone and the fries were some of the tastiest we've ever had! We then shared the mini s'mores cups and the devil's food cake for dessert. If I have one tip it's to leave room for dessert! The s'mores cakes had a nice spice to them and the meringue was creamy yet light, and the devil's food cake - wow! A huge portion with milk ice cream and it was so, so delicious! Rich, gooey, chocolatey, creamy... Just amazing!!! Sometimes I worry going somewhere with sharing plates that you will leave wanting more but we were stuffed to the brim! The food is quite pricey but you are getting delicious decent sized portions in a great setting so we were happy to pay. The nice thing about this place is even though it's cool and edgy there were all different kinds of groups of people there and everyone seemed to be getting great service and having a great night, there was no pretentious judgmentalness you sometimes get at stylish trendy places.

5.0,4/22/2015,"This past Saturday, I finally tried this place out.  I have a friend who kept telling me to go here, and he kept telling me how much I would like it.  Well, I did like it!  It's very much a lively, bar scene, fun dinner spot.  You have to be in the mood for somewhere with loud music while you eat.  It really reminded me of Vegas, and a lot of the places I have been to there.  Same type of vibe.  The food is a tad bit pricey, but I think it's worth it for the environment and the type of people it's aiming to cater towards.  I really liked that the crowd was very age diverse--well, at least between those age 25 to 40.  My absolute favorite thing we had was the foie gras appetizer.  It's definitely something I'd go back there to eat.  My second favorite thing was the beef tartare.  I wish the rice cake was a bit crispier and less chewy, but having said that I would order it again.  The dessert was also really good, and I recommend it if you're craving sweet, warm, sugary, chocolatey donuts.  Overall, I'd come back here with a small group of people, because the environment was so upbeat and energizing.",0,0,0,PaperPearl K.,"Manhattan, NY",4,17,0

We sat in the main area which was also beautifully decorated. We had a tasting of most of the brunch items so I got to try it all. The banana bread was my absolute favorite!

2.0,4/21/2015,"I was looking forward to this place, especially since I couldn't find a bad review.  This place has great atmosphere it is huge and every table was full.  My problem is with the food,  we ordered 9 dishes for 4 people and each had a few drinks the bill was over $500 which would be fine if the food was great and we didn't have to hit a shake shack on the way home.  We ordered all the meats medium and they all came out moo-ing, also the steak was full of fat and uneatable.  Bottom line its a great place for a few cocktails and a snack, most of these tapas places are not a place to eat dinner or you would have a bill over $1,000 for 4 people.  You've got to give them credit they figured out how to charge you for a full price dinner for 3 scallops which forces you to order additional plates at the price of a full price dinner and you still leave hungry...lol",0,0,0,Devlin M.,"Bay Shore, NY",0,6,0

Pretty solid if you ask me. They probably hear it all the time about being late, but they were nice about it and that made me feel better.The food:Great, no REALLY great.Steak tar-tar... AMAZING.

SUCH a scene and really delicious food and drinks.  The decor is beautiful and the pawn shop secret entrance makes it feel extra special.  Since this was completely spur of the moment, I was horribly underdressed (still in my flight clothes!) but luckily it was dark and I was too hungry to care.The menu is really killer, everything we had was so yummy.  My favorites were the gnocchi with scallops, and the grilled octopus on toast.  I love how everything was shareable.  FYI every dish we ordered came in a set of 3 (3 bites, 3 tacos, 3 scallops, you get the idea), so if you can come in multiples of 3 people, sharing will be a piece of cake.My only gripe was how insanely loud it was.  Anyone who knows me will attest that I love some untz untz wherever I go, but when I'm at dinner I'd like to talk with my group without yelling.  Maybe turn it down a notch or two B&E.  Either way, I'll be back here on my next trip for sure.",1,4,0,Lindsey G.,"San Francisco, CA",437,137,45

2.0,4/11/2015,"I've been here twice, and both experiences were very different. The first time I went with a couple friends, and we did not have a reservation and were told that we could stand by the bar for drinks, or take one of the bar tables if they opened up. We ended up staying at the bar for the entire time (between 3 of us, we only had 2 chairs and one person had to stand). We came on a Saturday night, so it was understandably busy due to the popularity of this place. I did not have much of an issue, except that it was a little annoying that they did not have enough seating. The second time, I had two friends visiting from out of town so I made sure to make a Friday night reservation well in advance. I made the reservation for 9:30 as I wanted to go here for drinks after dinner. We sat down when we got there, and the waitress came up to us explaining their tapas menu. We politely told her that we did not want dinner, that we just wanted to order drinks. She left the menus and came back a few minutes later explaining that their policy required all tables to order food, but that she would make an exception in this case. So my friends and I decided to order dessert along with our drinks to be courteous. She still didn't seem happy, and while we were clearly still working on our drinks, (and intending to order more) she dropped us the bill. We were in shock. All three of us had intended to order at least one more drink (which would have been an extra $60 on our bill) but clearly we were being kicked out. We were all angry at that point, and continued to work on the drinks we had. She came back a couple minutes later to take the bill, and we told her that we had not taken care of the payment yet, which she was not pleased about. After we finished, we paid and left (and were not sorry about leaving a terrible tip). Our bill amongst the three of us came out to over $100, so it was not as if we were not ordering much and taking up table space. It just does not make sense, as someone ordering food and no drinks would end up having a bill roughly the same as ours. I've never been treated so poorly at a restaurant before. Yes, this is a bougie place in New York. But clearly their attitude and service reflect the traditional New York stereotype. I won't be coming back.

The grilled cheese and tomato soup dumpling was also very interesting and delectable. I asked for no bacon, as it usually comes with bacon, and there was no problem with having that accommodation. Finally, the spaghettini was also very flavorful and had a pleasing light taste while very filling. This is a great place decor, service, and food wise. 10/10 from me. Definitely worth the price.

The vanilla beignets with raspberry jam. A must try for a starter. Fluffy and full of flavor. The bacon, tomato dumplings. Superb. I went with the braised short rib huevos rancheros. The perfect amount of kick and seasoning.  My gf went with the mini cubanos. The pickle brought out so much flavor and blended well with the pork.

As for the desserts, the frozen margarita shots were alright, I would prefer the smores cup more even though the chocolate cake on the bottom was a bit stiff and not that fluffy.

When we were seated on the first floor, which I recommend for dinner, the manager came over with a round of fruity birthday shots for the table and one for himself too :) Any questions or issues, he handled in a heartbeat.

Beauty & Essex happened to be one of our stops.I LOVE speakeasies. Just the overall concept and the fact that there is usually a full functioning shop of some sort as the entrance is intriguing to me. You begin by walking through the jewelry store in order to make your way to the actual restaurant/lounge. Being that this was my first time here, I was in awe. This is a fancy place, so do come dressed up. Everything is beautifully decorated and it is rather sophisticated - pretty people, pretty clothes, you catch my drift. Very high end New York.We definitely enjoyed the music and a fair share of delicious cocktails. It started to fill in quickly once we got there. The nice thing about Beauty & Essex is there are two levels. The first level being a more subtle and low-key area, but still fun. While the second level I would describe as the ""turn up"" level. If you want to be able to hear yourself and have conversations, stay on the first level.The only downside that comes with almost everything that is nice/high end is the price tag.

The menu is massive which I was expecting, and was pleasantly surprised by. Pricey pricey pricey.

4.0,3/31/2015,"You see the New York exclusive and extraordinary party's  in the movies. At Beauty & Essex you can experience it for yourself. Enjoy good food and pretty nice cocktails. You dance to but the music is horrible. The entree of Beauty & Essex looks like a jewelry store. Don't think it's a hidden gem, because the sign is pretty clear. Also the line with people in front of the door makes it pretty obvious. When you enter the second door you think you ended up in a 18th century prestigious building with a impressive staircase. We had a reservation on friday night on 10:45 PM. It was very crowded. People drank cocktails, were eating or (in case they had already a couple of drinks) dancing. Everybody did their best to dress and impress. I mean really impress. You are a European visitor? Just go for your favorite outfit that you wear if you are going a night out (a good night, like a dress). You are an American visitor? Go to Zara or any other European brand were the clothes have a slim fitting. The food was delicious. It is sharing food, but I think the word 'tapas' is not the way I would use for it. The dishes are indeed little bites for sharing, but it's not typical Spanish. It is an American and Japanees fusion. With two persons, after 4 or 5 dishes (included dessert) you are okay.De service is really fine, but I had a little problem going to the restroom. Okay, de champagne is very impressive. But when I went back to my table on the first floor the place was so crowded that I've had to wait for almost twenty minuten to go upstairs. When I said to the guard that my boyfriend is waiting for my with a dessert I told me that there was notting he could do. Come on?! I was still eating?! Please make a special entree for dining people or at least build some toilets upstairs. Another thing that annoyed me was the music. It was very very loud, but the worst thing: it was horrible awful music. I do not think this kind of music fits in a place like this. It was that kind of music that you hear in the touristic bars in The Netherlands. It is cheap and again horrible. I think they'll have to go for more relaxing, clubbing and deephouse music. And please no Afrojack. There is al little tiny thing I noticed too: the 'cool' people eat here, drink one cocktail and then leave to another (maybe cool) place. The people that came after they left you can describe to as snobby. But that's just an observation.Still I've had a fun night and we left around one o'clock I think.

4.0,3/30/2015,"This place has been on my list of restaurants to try for a while now, and it's next to impossible to find a reservation between 7 and 9pm on a weekend. Luckily, my friend and I found a 6pm (close enough) reservation here a MONTH in advance, so we sealed the deal on that as quick as we could. We did kind of feel like we were eating at the early bird special because of the time, but it's better than a 10pm res. We were a little early so the hostess gave us a pager until our table was ready and we made our way over to the bar for a drink in the meantime. I'd say we waited maybe 10 minutes..or drinks weren't even done before our pager buzzed. Yay! Time to eat!We ordered more food than we should have for the two of us, but yolo so whatever. Tuna poke wontons - delicious but small, basically sushi in a taco. Grilled cheese soup dumplings -  a MUST get. I could eat about 1000 of these and nothing else for the rest of my life and would be happy.Eggplant Pizetta - also really good. A larger amount of food compared to the rest of the tapas, and the ricotta on top really makes it. So smooth and yummy.BBQ fries - basically BBQ potato chip flavoring on french fries. DELICIOUS.Brick chicken - eh...fell flat in my mind. Not much flavor, although it was good really well.For dessert we got the s'mores in a cup and the butterscotch creme de pot. Ok...we really did NOT need both. The butterscotch creme was AMAZING. The texture was so smooth and the taste was phenomenal. The s'mores were good but not as good as the creme de pot. I only tried two cocktails during dinner and they were both well made and delicious so I'd imagine the rest are just as good.Most of the food came in waves, but they did bring our brick chicken at the same time as 2 other tapas, and since it's more of a meal, we were hoping they would bring that last..so we were a little disappointed that when we finally did get to eat it, it was cold and the polenta was congealed. That was probably the only real downside to the food service. The service was great, we didn't feel rushed at all even though I'm sure there was quite a wait for a table by the time we were finishing up. Our server was friendly and funny and gave us great recommendations. The place itself is beautiful, feels very high end and swanky but not pretentious in any way. Dim lighting and upbeat music. I would definitely come back for a special occasion because it IS pretty expensive..be prepared to spend a pretty penny. Glad I finally got to try it out!",2,3,0,Christine S.,"Manhattan, NY",46,165,2

After grabbing a drink at the bar Our party continued to the seating area which was sectioned off by a veil almost making me feel as if I were in an airplane. The music was a cool collection of r&b and rap. Our server was attentive and the food was delicious. We began with the delightfully refreshing and crunchy tuna poke wanton taco appetizer. For our main course there was grilled salmon on top of a bed of spinach and couscous and then the heritage baby back ribs with hush puppies and a sweet butter dip. The salmon wAs amazing and the ribs were falling of the bone good. We finished off the meal with some kind of margarita shots that were exquisite. We order another round of the shots because it was so tasty and refreshing and not overly sweet but made me feel as though it were summer again! Then we had the Devils food layer cake with milk ice cream. Step aside Momofuku because this is what real milk ice cream tastes like. The chocolate in the cake was so delectable and strong we couldn't finish it! We also had these mouse peanut butter cups with salt which were delicious!

We ordered five dishes for 3 people and it was just the right amount! In particular, I like the steak tartare and bone marrow! The beef short ribs were a little dry. I was really excited about the lobster mac and cheese, but it was only okay. It was as creamy as how I'd like it and I didn't really taste the addition of the lobster either.

From the outside, you can't tell that this place is a restaurant. After you go through their tiny pawn shop, through the magical door, you will find yourself in a huge restaurant with 2 floors and a huge bathroom. The ladies room has multiple sinks, double sided vanity mirror, and a make up station... and of course multiple bathroom stalls! so short bathroom lines ladies!! whoot whoot!During brunch, each dish is served tapas styles. Most dishes come with 3 pieces to share but if you have more people in your group, you could add an extra piece for about $4.I absolutely recommend the philly style pretzel! The gruyere sauce on that is amazing! Definitely my favorite dish during brunch.The grilled cheese soup dumplings is served on a spoon with spicy tomato bisque and bacon. It's good but has an overwhelming taste of Velveeta cheese, worth trying but I wouldn't order it twice.The most disappointing dish I had here was the Everything Bagel and Lox Pizzetta. The pizzetta wasn't crunchy (kind of soggy) and had too many capers, which ruined the taste of the whole dish for me.I would also skip on the Avocado toast. I've had better and for cheaper. The piece of toast was big and the avocado spread on it was similar to over mashed guacamole. I personally like my avocado to be a bit chunky on the toast and with taste of lime. Their avocado toast isn't worth $11.I hope to come back soon to try their dinner and drinks menu.

If you want something really decadent go for the s'mores but if you're looking for something a little lighter then go for the doughnuts. Both are delicious so you can't go wrong ordering either one.

5.0,3/12/2015,"My wife and I were in New York last week and overall had a fairly miserable experience. The weather was dismal. There was one snowstorm after the next. After each snow came frozen rain and high winds. The day we went to Beauty & Essex was a miserable cold, rainy day. We got to the restaurant approximately 4:30 PM for a 5:00 pm reservation. It was the only reservation available that day. It was a Tuesday. The restaurant was not open yet and there's nothing around the neighborhood except an ethnic market where we hung out for 30 minutes waiting for the restaurant to open. I was completely prepared to make this one of the worst days of my stay. By the time the restaurant opened at 5 PM, I was ornery, hungry, freezing cold, and quite cranky. Wow - what a surprise. Everything was spectacular. Amazing.  Anyone who thinks New York does not have the best food in the country has not been to Beauty & Essex. Everything was indescribably delicious.Dinner started with a free serving from the kitchen. Some type of a butternut squash/pumpkin bisque soup. What a wonderful and warm surprise this was. Just enough to realize that we were in for quite a treat.Next course - 'Philly' Pretzel. Almost impossible to describe. Not really a pretzel - more like bruschetta. But everything about it was spectacular to the crunch of the bread to the fresh melted Gruyere cheese.  We also had the Kale & Apple Salad, Grilled Cheese Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings, Lobster Tacos, and Crispy Eggplant Pizzetta. The amazing dessert was something called Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Crème Coconut Chantilly. It was unbelievably decadent. Every item was better than the next. The service was absolutely top notch. It was the type of service you only get in the very best restaurants. The server was knowledgeable, attentive, and always available - but not intrusive. Our water glasses remained full and empty plates were immediately removed. We went to see a Broadway play after this dinner - but the entire trip home all we could talk about was the meal. It was superior to the play and quite frankly the best part of our trip to New York - Winter 2015.I can't wait to go back. There are so many more things on the menu I want to try.",2,0,0,Ralf J.,"Delray Beach, FL",2,12,6
5.0,3/12/2015,"Been wanting to try this place for a while so went this past Saturday for brunch with my two daughters.  Our reservation was at 11:30 when they opened and if your entire party is not there, they won't seat you.  Place is very eclectic, you walk through a small pawn shop which sells kind of nice stuff such as chanel flats and Louis Vuitton bags.  I thought the decor was trashy chic and the bathroom was cool as well with free standing sinks and mirrors with shelves of empty perfume bottles.  Attendant in bathroom as well.  Back to food.   Waitress was very friendly and helpful, forgot to ask her name though.  My daughter ordered some kind of martini drink that had blood orange vodka with fresh squeezed blood orange juice.  It was amazing.  Perfect amount of everything.  My other daughter got a platinum peacock which was non alcoholic with fresh cucumber, apple, mint and was so refreshing.   We ordered a total of six things to share between the three of us:  Red velvet waffle which was perfectly chocolately but could've used a little more of the cream cheese frosting.  The everything bagel and lox pizzetta was delicious.  Flatbread kind of cracker with smoked salmon, cream cheese on top, big portion.  The grilled cheese with tomato soup dumplings were amazing!  I could've eaten these all day.  The cheese just oozed out and the soup was tasty.  The philly pretzel was shaved beef on bread with melted cheese and onions, also very tasty.  The chicken meatballs were delicious and served in a creamy mushroom sauce.  The lobster tacos were my least favorite as they were breaded instead of just the meat and had red cabbage on top which I'm not a fan of but overall still good.  For dessert we had some kind of s'more dessert which was just okay.  The presentation on all the food was beautiful.  Would definitely go back again with a bunch of girls. Not cheap once you order drinks and all your picky foods add up but definitely a nice day out.   I think it's more of a girly place, not for a man who is into his steak and potatoes type place.  Also, there aren't any garages around to park.  You can park on the street, but have to feed meter again after one hour.  Better off taking subway.  Entrance close to restaurant.",0,0,0,Beth P.,"Bergen County, NJ",5,195,167

But once you find it and pass the front pawn shop, you will enter a fancy 2 floor restaurant with a lounge and bar on both floors. Where do I begin? I was here for restaurant week and had scored reservations (yes, this place is difficult to get reservations as it gets busy) but my friend was running extremely late so I had asked the hostess for options and she told me that I can sit at the bar and won't lose my reservations and to just let her know when everyone in my party arrived. It was cool with me anyway as it was Friday night and I wanted to get a drink anyways ;P I had tried the Art of War made with Brugal rum and it was strong and not watered down. I also ordered the infamous Cheese and Tomato Soup Dumplings and it was very yummy but kind of pricey. Most of the cocktail mix drinks are $15 and the dumplings were 6 spoons for $14. After we were seated for dinner, I ordered the Chile Relleno Empanadas, Beauty & Essex Burger and Donuts for desserts. The empanadas came in a set of 4 and had a slight spicy kick it. The Beauty & Essex Burger I ordered it bunless and it was juicy and yummy made of lamb and beef meat, tomato, goat cheese, lettuce and came with BBQ fries. My friend kept stealing my fries lol. I also sampled her salmon which was very fresh and flavorful with the kale and pearl couscous. This place really knows how to present their foods. The donuts were okay. I don't find it as out of this world as everyone else. Definitely overhyped but it was very cute that it came in a box. Oh, the rumors are true... Bathroom does serve pink drinks but because I forgot to bring some change to tip, I didn't feel comfortable taking a drink so I missed out :( The service was very nice and I definitely had a great time.

The pumpkin portobello mushroom soup. Yummy!!! 5 out of 5. Appetizers2. We ordered the Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos (micro cilantro, radish, wasabi kewpie.) It was good tasting. The tuna was fresh. Flavorful. It kind of tasted like sushi. 4 out of 5. 3. We also ordered the Chile Relleno' Empanadas (poblano, manchego, jalapeño-lime crema.) This empanadas are meatless. I like the flaky crispiness on the outside. It was a light empanada even though it was fried. It was okay tasting to me. 3 out of 5. Entrees4. Ordered the Grilled Salmon (herry vinegar glaze, pearl couscous, red chard & sunchoke puree.) It had a sweet and flavor with a crusty outside. The grilled salmon is suppose to be under cooked, but still tender. Good flavor. The couscous could have used a little more seasoning. 4 out of 5. 5. Bricked Pressed Chicken (creamy mascarpone polenta, blistered tomato, Sicilian style bread crumbs.) Chicken was juicy and moist. A nice little acidity flavor in it. Polenta was so flavorful. I loved this dish. 4.5 out of 5. Both entree dishes were very light, but still filling and tasty. Desserts6. Ordered the Petite Cupcakes (red velvet cake & cream cheese frosting, Guinness cake & Bailey's frosting.) I must say it was the cutest looking cupcakes I have seen. It has stars on top of it. The Guinness cake was good. I like that liquor taste to it, but it didn't mask the flavor of the cake. The Red Velvet cake was amazing. A true Red Velvet flavor. Yummy!!! 4.5 out of 5. 7. Box of Doughnuts (vanilla beignets with chocolate hazelnut crème & raspberry jam.) Chocolate Hazelnut creme had liquour in it as well, but you can still taste the chocolate hazelnut flavor. It was okay to me. The Raspberry jam was nothing special to me either. It had sugar coating on top. 3 out of 5. Presentation of every dish was definitely a 4.5 out of 5.

I am pretty sure my boyfriend would not have been a fan of me spending a good hour in the bathroom sipping on champagne and taking selfies in the bathroom. The food was pretty great. We went for restaurant week but ended up ordering off of the regular menu. I highly recommend the grilled cheese dumplings. The restaurant is tapas-style so be prepared to spend if you are really hungry. The drinks were pretty expensive but the happy hour crowd was huge. Overall it was a good experience and I intend on bringing others here for the ambiance alone.,1,0,0,Desiree S.,"West Islip, NY",2,14,0

The entire meal is huge. I was in a fatty mood, and this completely fulfilled that.

4.0,3/7/2015,"I went during restaurant week to celebrate my friends birthday. This place was great. You walk thru a small pawn shop only to walk into this beautiful 2-floor restaurant. The decor is amazing and the food was out of this world. I had the eggplant pizzetta, spaghettini & the ice cream for my choices.  Everything was delicious. The ice cream/sorbet are chef's choice & come in three small bowls. The flavors we got were a bit odd but that's expected when it's chef's choice. The bathroom is a treat too because they have couches for you to hang out on while a woman behind a makeshift bar serves champagne. We must of hung out in there for 20 minutes just chatting and no one rushed us or pushed us out. It was nice. We also tipped both women (the champagne server & bathroom attendant) which may have helped. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars was the service. They told us that our whole party had to be there before they would even give us a buzzer for our reservation and there was only a 15-minute window. I can respect that for such a busy place but we were there 15 minutes before our reservation and still weren't seated until almost 20 minutes after our reservation. On top of that we had brought an outside cake for our friend's birthday and they charged us a per plate fee to cut the cake. This wouldn't have been so bad if the waitress didn't give us a little attitude when we requested smaller containers to carry the cake home. They only cut the pieces necessary for the table and then left the cake whole. So we had to be the ones to divvy it up into the smaller containers. If they're charging you a fee to cut the cake - the least they can do is go the extra mile & help set it up for us to bring it home.Otherwise I recommend going. The food was very good.

5.0,3/3/2015,I'm confident enough to leave 5 stars for this restaurant before we reach dessert. The entrance was a pawn shop which to me was awesome. It made us question if we were in the right place for just long enough for this to seem like an exclusive secret. The decor is rustic meets swanky. Truly magnificent in greys/silvers and purples with aged wood tables and chairs. Our server was wonderful and explained the tapas style and how many dishes are recommended. We ordered vanilla beignets with raspberry preserves which would rival those from their origins in LA. Fluffy pillows of air with flavorful dots of warmed preserves. We then ordered the eggs Benedict. I'm a bit of a hollandaise enthusiast and this one took the cake. Light and buttery with the perfect amount of tang. We then ordered a juicy lucy sausage biscuit. Spiced perfectly the sausage broke open to reveal the gooey melty pimento cheese center all on a biscuit my southern grandmother would be jealous of. Next was the chilaquiles. The chips stayed toothy and they were stacked so perfectly that breaking the yolk was more like watching lava flow down a mountain. The black bottom butterscotch pot de creme came with adorable and yummy cookie spoons. It was a clean and creamy finish to a perfect meal.

We were told upon arriving early that the upstairs would open at 1PM.

The upstairs is large and a pretty cool spot for brunch. As the plates started coming out, things looked promising but we quickly learned that we were expected to SHARE. I'm talking about 3 people to a plate. The whole concept of brunch is combining two meals and suddenly I have to share? Not pleased.

2.0,3/2/2015,"I don't understand how this restaurant has been rated so highly. We just went for restaurant week dinner and found almost every aspect sub par. The front room was beautiful and I'm glad we sat there. The second room seemed too dark and noisy. Every piece of food was lukewarm bordering on cold including the coffee. There is no bread or nibble offered other than a shot glass of pumpkin soup which was too sweet for our taste. I had the mini empanadas. The cheese filling was good but the dough, too thick & tough. The crema, skimpy. My friend had the eggplant pizza which was hard & boring. We both ordered the pasta which was from a box and just weird - overdressed in a green pesto mess  that had little flavor. The ""sunny side up egg"" on top added nothing & was not cooked as stated. It was overcooked with a hard yolk, not the runny yolk that is meant to enrich the sauce. The mini donuts & teeny cupcakes, passable. Service was inattentive, rushed & slow at the same time. The entrees were served before my friend had finished her appetizer so we requested it be held a bit. It took 15 minutes and 4 requests for her to be served and by then, I had finished. Forget trying to get a refill of water. I think you can tell a lot about a restaurant from the restrooms. The upstairs loo was pretty but dirty (it was only 7 pm) and the downstairs bathroom, disgusting. Cheap faux tile plastic paneling on the walls that I haven't seen since the 70's.

I give 4 stars just because some of the portions are tapas style.. too small considering the price. However the main dish's size was ok. Let me tell you that the desserts were to die for.

We ordered the vanilla beignets, lemon blackberry pancakes, eggs Benedict, kale and apple salad, crispy eggplant pizzetta, mac and cheese, bbq fries, chilaquiles, jäger mister chocolate shots, and the petite cupcakes.

3.0,2/28/2015,"I was so excited to go to Beauty and Essex and it wasn't what I expected. The restaurant opens exactly at 5pm so if you have a 5pm reservation they'll make you wait outside (in the cold) instead of letting you come in and sit in the waiting area, which I found to be extremely rude because I got there at 4:53pm and they watched me stand in front of the door for 7 minutes. The front of the restaurant is a pawn shop which is unusual but the decor when you step in to the restaurant is nice and the ambiance is very dark and romantic. Our waiter was the sweetest guy and he was very attentive to us and paid attention to my dietary restrictions (allergies and religious) which I appreciated a lot.  We did the restaurant week menu and tried a variety of things. For apps we tried the eggplant pizzettas (IMMACULATE! It was the best thing I tried at the restaurant) and tuna poke wonton tacos (ok but not extremely good- too much soy sauce for my liking). For the entree we tried the grilled salmon ( not grilled the way I like it- it was a little underdone) and the kale/couscous pairing had an unusual taste that I didn't really like. For dessert, we tried the cupcakes (4 in a serving) and box of doughnuts (3 in a serving). The Guinness cupcakes were different and my personal favorite over the red velvet. The box of doughnuts had way too much sugar crystals on it and I'm not a big fan of super sweet.

Unless you are all about that type of pepper.- The House Salad - even if you do not like salad, you might start liking them after this one. - Grilled Cheese Tomato Soup dumplings - Amazing, i dont think i need to go further into this- Duck Confit - this dish was like a duck/tortilla casserole thing. A favorite of many of my fellow diners that evening.- Broccolini and the Scallop w/ pork belly entree - I hate broccollini and I hate scallops but now I crave it. What does that tell you?- Lobster and Squid Ink Pasta - Was very good, just wasn't as memorable as the other dishes. - Brussel Sprouts - get your veggies in.

My appetizer (eggplant pizzette) was absolutely amazing- it was so flavorful and really blew me away. However, my spaghettini was disappointing. In all honesty, I probably ordered wrong because that is not something that I would normally get. I was looking for a healthier meal, but it really did have a lot of flavorful (considering it is noodles made out of zucchini). My date had the veal bolognese, which I found to be underwhelming for a dish that can be delicious. The mini donuts for dessert were so delicious!This was my first time trying foie gras and I will not be having it again any time soon - although that may not be through any fault of the chef here, maybe it is just not my thing.The drinks were strong but very tasty.

We got here around 8:45pm, checked in our coats and went upstairs to the lounge area for some drinks after a long day.

I have been to other restaurants where the it seems like the wait staff looks down on you because you come for the restaurant week menu but not here. He was great!! We got the wanton tuna tacos, kale and apple salad and the eggplant pizza. Everything was really flavorful and delicious!! Would definitely recommend all 3. My friend and I got the lamb burger (medium) w| goat cheese with the fries and the aoli dressing. The lamb burger was hands down one of the best I have ever tasted! It was so juicy and cooked to perfection! The seasoned fries were amazing as well and I could not stop eating them!! My boyfriend got the salmon on top of a bed of lentils and spinach. The salmon was delicious, but I did not love the lentils and spinach mix, it seemed like it was missing something (maybe some salt would have helped). For dessert we got the 6 mini donuts and the 6 mini cupcakes. We loved the donuts! They were warm and filled with chocolate (3) or berry jam (3).

They're pretty serious about reservations so definitely make sure your party is 100% on time or they wont seat you. We got there right on time so were seated immediately. The front of the restaurant is beautiful - it looks kind of like a cross between a chic thrift shop, a fancy hotel, and a club. We were led to a booth-style table looking out to the middle of the restaurant next to a vase of peacock feathers. Lighting was dim, but it wasn't too loud so we could still have a nice conversation. I'd suggest going with a group of 5 or less - the booths are definitely the place to be, and the tables didn't look too intimate in comparison. We first ordered drinks and my friends and I got the Beauty Elixir which is a combo of gin, strawberry, and cucumber. One of my friends got the Emerald Gimlet which was a vodka drink with basil in it. We absolutely loved them since they were both strong and refreshing, but they were definitely on the pricier side with $15/drink. Not to brag, but I think I ordered the best off the restaurant week menu. The kale & apple salad was HUGE, but so fresh and delicious that I was still hungry enough to continue to the next course. I'm not one to ever say that I ""like"" salads, but I can honestly say this one was off the charts. Even if you're going after restaurant week is over, I would definitely recommend it. The Beauty & Essex Burger though blew my mind. Of course it comes with this giant thing of BBQ fries which are the most addicting things I've ever had. The combination of the garlic aioli with the goat cheese was absolutely incredible, but the burger was so huge that it was hard to finish. Finally, the desserts were out of this world... I think you should definitely go with either the box of donuts (which you could actually take away with you) or the cupcakes. The ice cream was a little mediocre with weird flavors like ""milk"" and ""brown butter."" The cupcakes are tiny and adorable, and the red velvet basically speaks for itself. The donuts come in a pack of six - 3 jelly-filled and 3 chocolate-filled. Absolutely incredible. The service was decent, but they never really came back to check on us with the food.

The decor is to die for like I feel like I could hold a wedding and its reception upstairs! lol i loved the pink champagne served in the restroom along with the comfy seats. It definitely made up for the long wait time. Overall I will definitely come back but I'll be sure to make it there on time seeing as it was insanely crowded on a Monday night at that!",2,0,0,Stephanie P.,"Brooklyn, NY",352,5,5
4.0,2/16/2015,"I went here with my girlfriend on a Sunday for brunch. It was very lively and had decent music. The food here was spectacular, specifically the steak and eggs. Have the steak cooked medium and the over easy eggs were cooked to perfection. The lobster tacos were packed with meat and I wish they came with four rather three. But I must say the grilled cheese dumplings with tomato soup was a great appetizer but after each bite I was wanting more and then they were gone. The bar upstairs is like a club. I thought it was Saturday night still rather than Sunday. For the fellas, there were a lot of potential women for you to approach (women go to brunch over dudes anyways).

I have had better and the beignets were too sweet and the sweetness is artificial.Also, I think Beauty & Essex is better than Stanton Social.

Interested yet?From the two-story chandelier to the peacock-themed grand dining room to the free-flowing pink Champagne in the ladies' room, you're sure to have a good time whether you go for the drinks, food or people watching. Most speakeasies are small low-key lounges whereas this one is grande, extravagant and trendy.

5.0,2/15/2015,"You'll see the golden ""Beauty and Essex"" sign from really far away as you walk down Essex Street. For those that are not in the know, they'll think it's a pawn shop as all the other reviews have mentioned.  Walk in through the back door of the place and you'll walk in to a totally different world.  There's a guy off to the left running up and down the stairs checking in coats. Off to the right will be a guy telling you to go upstairs if you don't have a reservation(on the more busier nights).  Walk past the check in area(where they'll give you a buzzer similar to what you'd get at the cheesecake factory and many other ""large"" restaurants and you'll be presented with a pretty crowded bar to the left.  These guys make a decent cocktail but far from what I would expect at a ""speakeasy"".  They do mix very strong but you'll never realize it....till  you stand up.Fast forward a bit and we got seated about 10 minutes after our set reservation time(we showed up at 9:20PM for a 10PM reservation).  The DJ was doing a great job with keeping the crowd entertained.  Lots of top 40/old school hip hop and slight touches of EDM.To start, we got the bone marrow/toast and the lobster tacos. Both of which were excellent but the bone marrow is what will bring us back.  For the mains, my wife had the pork belly and scallops and I went with the 24 ounce bone in rib eye.  Everything on the menu looked awesome, it took my wife over 20 minutes to figure out what she wanted to have.  They didn't mention it was dry aged on the menu, but it most certainly was.They presented the food to us and it looked awesome.  The portion of scallops was quite generous and though the pork belly was good, it just couldn't compete with the amazing flavors that the scallops were cooked in.  My rib eye was cut up in to thin pieces and served with four different dipping sauces.  The creamed spinach sauce and the ""white cream"" sauce were my favorites.  The steak was cooked up to a nice medium rare and virtually melted in our mouths.  We really wanted to try dessert, but we were so full(and tipsy) that we couldn't proceed any further.  We took a peek upstairs to see what it was all about.  There was a DJ and a lot of people standing around. Nothing exciting there at 1AM.  It was also a holiday.  I'll definitely come back on a ""regular"" saturday to check it out.  We loved it!",2,0,2,Biru S.,"Mamaroneck, NY",333,671,153

5.0,2/13/2015,"This place.Ok, I love speakeasys, so let's just start there. You walk into a very nice pawn shop, which I would have rated this place the same, if the venue stopped there. But it doesn't. They open up the back door which leads you into a lush, dimly lit but ultra fab restaurant that makes you feel like you had to know people just to get in.The bar greets you on the left, and what a warm welcome greeting indeed. They can mix a drink. Get the Woodsman. It's Whiskey with a whole bunch of other greatness that hello! Knocks you right on your ass. In the best possible way, don't get me wrong. Beauty and Essex can beat me up any day of the week.Ok, now the food. The waitress assesses how large your party is, what your food allergies are, and instructs the kitchen to perform their magic. Try all the dishes. Even if you aren't sure how well some flavor combinations will execute, order the dish. Because the kitchen knows, and everyone else dining knows, how great it is. If you take a moment away from your whiskey drink (just a moment, promise) to look up around you.. you'll see pure joy and happiness and empty plates on the diners tables surrounding yours.Hold on now, it gets better. I know, I know. Just wait.If you're a girl (i don't know if this applies to men as well, because alas, I am a woman) GO TO THE DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM. Don't even waste your time on the upstairs one, because the downstairs bathroom serves your already drunk ass PINK CHAMPAGNE. YES. Bring your phone because you'll need to shamelessly selfie a thousand times with all your gal pals and the pink champagne BECAUSE ITS PINK CHAMPAGNE IN THE BATHROOM. And don't even worry about looking like a basic bitch selfie-ing (?) because not only will everyone else be doing the same thing, but it's pink champagne. No one looks basic with pink champagne. Even if you have a pumpkin spice latte in the other hand.",4,9,3,Jess P.,"Long Beach, NY",18,66,18

5.0,2/7/2015,"Per a friend's suggested my husband made reservation for us on short notice for Thanksgiving dinner. We took the long commute to Beauty & Essex to encounter the pawn shop. Yelp prepared us for this reveal. After a very gracious greeting the security guard opens the door to a staircase and our hostess leads us to this hidden world of dimly lit decadence.Dark but sparkling we were escorted to our seat with very few guests for our 545pm reservations. This is of course because it was a holiday. Which made me feel a little bad that this staff had to be here instead of their families. However, the staff were lovely and attentive but the food did take a while to get to us.I told my love if E&S had been the location of our first date it would have left me entranced with him even faster. In other words it would HAVE BEEN ON! But instead my soulmate wooed me with a week together at Comic-Con International in San Diego, California which is THEE epicenter of cool nerdom. But I digress, we ordered B&E's version of Thanksgiving dinner. It was incredible, delicious, worth the wait and the price. Delighted to see that steak tartare was an appetizer option that was our first choice. It was good but not great and a small portion. But I would order it again since it is quite difficult to find in our hometown of San Diego, California. Turkey was a tiny bit dry and a little cold but it was still flavorful. Stuffing was fantastic. Mashed potatoes were good. Oh my gosh the brussel sprouts were the best. There was nothing that wasn't tasty. We were too stuffed to have dessert so I was not lucky enough to further indulge.At the end I visited the ladies room. Wha? So fancy. The attendant turned the water on for me but left it running, which to a Southern Californian (drought ridden) is a bit worrisome. I tipped her and as I dried my hands I took notice of the bar and lounge area. Had I known I would have visited this space during the long wait for the food and grabbed a champagne glass. This hidden gem was completely worth it and in the end our indulgent meal for two was approximately $100 (including one adult beverage).

3.0,2/4/2015,"I love the entrance to Beauty and Essex - you enter through a pawn shop and walk through a door which opens out into the huge bar/restaurant space.  There is a well organised, free cloakroom which was a bonus.The food here is fabulous.  The style of the menu is sharing plates, so rather than ordering a main each we ordered a number of small plates for the table.  I'm a vegetarian, but this was no problem as one portion of the meat dishes was substituted for a veggie option.  The food was so tasty and well presented - and surprisingly reasonably priced.After dinner we had drinks at the upstairs bar - and this is where B&E loses 2 stars from me.  We sat down at a vacant table, only to be told by the waitress ""you can sit here, but if someone comes in who I think will spend more money than you, you'll have to move"".  I thought this was incredibly rude.  We ordered a number of drinks and were never without a drink in our hands, but the waitress was very pushy and tried to force us to order more and more.  Because of her attitude, our group only left a 10% tip.  Upon leaving, we were stopped by the manager and told our tip was too low!  This was completely inappropriate and soured my evening.  There should be no requirement to give an extremely rude, bolshy waitress a 20% tip (which is what I would usually tip for good service).I'll return to B&E for the food - and hope the waitress in question has moved on to another establishment!",0,0,0,Rachel S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0

I went for a saying goodbye to the roaring 20's theme, so Beauty and Essex definitely fit the bill.  The restaurant is BEAUTIFUL.  Ladies, be sure to bring a few bucks to the ladies room to tip the bartender for the free sparkling rosé (yes, powder your nose and have a drink).I had 12 guests, so we went with the tasting menu.  Scallops were cooked PERFECTLY.  The chicken meatballs were also great (not dry at all).  The shaved brussel sprouts with duck on toast were very tasty (they put pomegranate seeds for a touch of sweetness...this may have been my favorite dish).  Lobster tacos had a huge chunk of lobster tail which was a bit of a surprise (I expected chopped lobster pieces with filler) - good piece of meat but not my favorite dish (it's deep fried lobster...eh).  Specialty drinks are $15 per - the one with basil and vodka is my favorite.  I think this is a bit odd to say about a restaurant, but they play really good music. A lot of it was from early 2000's, so it was a great way to get my friends ready for the bar party after dinner.As you can see, there are a lot of pros, but there are two cons. We waited about 30 minutes for our reserved table, which is annoying. The price of the tasting menu is a bit high for tapas servings.  No one left hungry, but the amount of food for the price we paid per person seemed a bit steep.  To be fair, this is a nice restaurant, so I wouldn't say don't come here because of the prices, but know that you're paying for more than just food -- it's the whole package including the ambiance, the speakeasy vibe, and the free rosé. ;)  I would consider this a special occasion restaurant.",2,0,0,Joyce C.,"New York, NY",6,56,10

We all ordered cocktails and everyone loved their drinks except me. First Im not a big drinker so if it isn't sweet with a little alcohol I don't like it LOL.

I shared an entree of the ribs with onion rings and it was enough to satisfy us.  Most of us shared entrees except the greedy birthday girl who was being treated LOL. Unfortunately we couldn't chill and laugh as long as we wanted because it was a 2 hour limit to dine. Towards the end of our 2 hours the waitress served us complimentary dessert to expedite our departure and we were OK with that arrangement. LOL. We feasted on like three different dessert dishes (chocolate cake w/ice cream and mini cupcakes). We ate those desserts so fast it was hilarious.After dinner we went to the restroom to freshen up for our next stop of dancing.

Private enough to hear your guests yet it's open to the rest of the restaurant so you still feel part of the scene. Best drink is the earl the pearl which is sweet tea vodka and lemonade. Please don't ever get rid of it! It's been 3 years and it's still my go to. The lobster tacos are amazing and you can't go wrong with the filet with the truffle dipping sauce.

5.0,1/12/2015,"I have been wanting to try this for a long time. But it is so hard to make a reservation. So I tried my luck and just walk-in, we didn't get the regular seating. However, there are plenty of seats in the lounge area on a Friday night. And I actually think it's better since it's more chill and intimate. We had the grilled cheese, smoked bacon & tomato dumplings. It was prepared different from what I expected. And it was great! Great for sharing and as a finger food (can't imagine it? Check the picture I uploaded). We also had the Heritage baby back ribs. It was really soft and juicy. The meat fall off the bone easily. So don't be afraid to order it even you are on a date ;) The hush puppies that came with it tasted amazing after I rubbed it all over with honey butter! We also had the lobster jambalaya.

5.0,1/5/2015,"Absolutely gorgeous space!  With the high ceilings and the large skylight and the chandeliers and booths, there was just enough light streaming through in the winter morning that they didn't need to turn on the lights.  The food was tapa style, so we ordered a bunch of dishes to share.  Among the dishes we ordered were the chicken and biscuits, red velvet waffles, lobster hash, huevos rancheros, baked eggs and grits, beignets .  The portions were all small (as tapas usually are), but all super, super cute.  I can't say there was any item that I did not like!  The only thing was that there were 5 of us, and all of the plates came with either 3 or 4 items, so we ended up cutting them.  We ordered 8 items for the 5 of us, and I think that was enough.  Prices are on the higher side, with each plate being around $15.I heard this place turns into a lounge at night, complete with free champagne every time you visit the restroom (which had it's own attendent, btw, even for brunch!)",1,0,0,Miss Maggie C.,"Saratoga, CA",104,468,88

We sat in a corner, which was nice because it was a bit quieter, despite the several large groups of people in the center of the room.  The only thing that was a liiiiitle bit annoying was that it was positively freezing in there.  Otherwise, there was decent space between tables and it was pretty decent service, for how busy it was. As I don't make decisions well, a tapas place is definitely among the better places to take me.  I didn't have to order anything either - it was all ordered for me.  There were a bunch of dishes, and I don't remember all of them, but the oysters, the kale and apple salad, and the scallops stand out in my head (especially the salad).  I'm positive the several other dishes were equally as good, but those three were especially delicious.  It was relaxed, I never felt rushed, and the food came out at a good pace.  There was just enough on each plate to try everything, enjoy a bit more if you liked it, but not too much as to waste it.  Of the handful of tapas places I have been to across the country (and in Spain), this is one of my favorites.  It was a very nice place with good food, good service, and an atmosphere that lent itself to everything from a romantic date to a celebratory dinner.",0,0,0,Jenna D.,"Bellingham, WA",150,431,44

3.0,1/3/2015,"Beauty & Essex has become somewhat of a touristy location.  The decor is very modern and chic, and the dining hall itself is hidden away behind the doors of a pawn shop in a very speakeasy like fashion.  The menu recommends family style sharing of tapas, and I couldn't agree more.  The dishes were set up more like bites, with each dish accommodating four to six bites.  The Good:Foie Gras - melt in your mouth goodness over a tartineTomato Soup with Bacon Grilled Cheese Dumplings - just read the description again, can't go wrongBeef Tartar - perfect in execution and portion sizeShishito Peppers Grilled - awesome, cooked the perfection, and light seasoning with a hint of acidity The Not So Good:Beef Carpaccio - flavors were great, albeit a bit Southeast Asian, but the beef was drySalmon Tartar - too much sweetness in the sauce.  Again, very southeast asian flavors ended up covering up any taste of the salmonFor what its worth, B&E is pretty expensive given their smaller portion sizes.  However, you're really paying for the experience and venue.  I would recommend it to friends visiting, but probably would go elsewhere on a normal basis.PROTIP:  free champagne for women in the restroom",1,0,0,David C.,"Mountain View, CA",907,1716,3680

3.0,12/29/2014,"Very good food, a trendy ambiance, but service and overall dining experience left something to be desired. The interior is dimly lit, elegant yet modern. The restrooms were quite nice. Every dish was very savory, some with interesting flavor combinations. An amuse bouche soup was delicious. Salmon ceviche was light and fresh. The steak tartare was topped with grated parmesan, a unique touch, but there was too much of it. Surprisingly the side dish of Brussels sprouts was excellent, very tasty.Aside from the great food we felt rushed for most of the meal. Dishes came out too quickly and were not paced. What was supposed to be a martini came out as a gin and tonic in a martini glass. The glassware was substandard. Having all of the wait staff wearing ear pieces makes it feel like a chain restaurant and clashes with the otherwise classy ambiance.

Excellent flavor.  I just love the tacos here.  And the bahn mi tacos are no joke - it's like eating a bahn mi sandwich - in taco form!  It's not fair though, because tacos just make everything taste better (and in such easy-to-eat format...)-Lobster tacos: Also really good.  Seriously consider just getting taco dishes.-Penne: I'm sure there was a longer name to this, but it was pretty good.  And not gimmicky - just a plain penne with great sauce and great flavor.  Good to see something without frills done well (but the frilly stuff is also good...)-Ravioli: I think this had sweet potato in it? It was excellent. Get it.  And like, one order of all the taco dishes.-Meatballs: Also really good.  A strong contender to sub out one of the tacos (but just get it with the tacos...)So, yeah, solid every time we go, and always great decor and service.  If you can get a Gilt deal or groupon or whatever, so much the better.  Just make sure you get reservations.",2,1,0,Jason H.,"Manhattan, NY",528,388,2

5.0,12/28/2014,"I don't even know where to begin with writing about Beauty & Essex because it was just such a great experience overall. From looking at the interesting items in the front pawn shop to the chic decor in the interior -- my group overall had such a fun brunch outing here and I will be back to try more of their amazing food. We made reservations for brunch on Saturday and the restaurant was not overly crowded which was nice because it felt like we had part of the restaurant to ourselves. We shared almost everything (with the exception of 2 people who ordered entrees but let us have bites of what they got) and I recommend ordering little plates of a lot of things so you can try more. We ordered the red velvet waffle, vanilla beignets, lemon blackberry pancakes, Philly pretzel, free range scrambled eggs, grilled cheese smoked bacon tomato soup dumplings, mac and cheese, creamy mascarpone grits, lobster and chorizo hash, oven braised chicken meatballs, braised short rib huevos rancheros, and for dessert shots of jagermeister hot chocolate and pumpkin pie bread pudding with gingersnap ice cream & cranberry compote. Although everything we had was really great my standouts were:- Red velvet waffle: not overly sweet, perfect portion to share with a group & it was light, fluffy and everything a waffle should be- Grilled cheese, smoked bacon tomato soup dumplings: everything I love in the world (cheese, bacon, soup dumplings) was on this perfect (AND I MEAN PERFECT) bite. They serve it on Asian soup spoons and they give you a little bite of the soup dumpling which has great cheese and bacon flavors but the star here was the tomato soup. It was seasoned perfectly and made it want to swim in a vat of it.- Oven braised chicken meatballs: I'm not the greatest fan of chicken meatballs because of their tendency to get a bit drier than regular meatballs but this was not the case here. They also had truffle oil on these babies and I am the BIGGEST fan of truffle so this was instantly one of my faves. - Shot of Jagermeister hot chocolate with a marshmallow: this was the perfect end to the meal. The jager wasn't overpowering and the shot was also not overly hot so you could enjoy it in one go and it was so good. The chocolate was nice and creamy and the portion was perfect.Definitely worth the money that was spent here.

Although he apologized & clearly did not do this on purpose, our group was disappointed by the way that management handled this. Instead of comp-ing her drinks or food, they offered her a reimbursement on dry cleaning. Let's be serious, she's not going to go all the way downtown to provide a receipt for a dry cleaning bill. She sat through the dinner with stains of red wine on her clothes and she was wet, which made her cold. Not cool.The interior design & decor is gorgeous, the pawn shop entrance is creative, the champagne being served in the women's bathroom is a nice touch & the food & drinks are pretty good.

4.0,12/1/2014,"Getting home from a night out in the LES can be painful! The F train is just a nightmare, which is why I tend to shy away from visiting this area. And when you've visited most places around the area (verlaine, local 138, la caverna, rivington hotel etc etc) you know that you can find the same type of bars elsewhere with a more accessible train. But B&E is such a unique space! This is probably the only place I'd be willing to make an exception for and take the F. For a speakeasy bar, it has an amazing set up, it is very decorative, chic, sophisticated, elegant...just plain classy. As a girly girl this is the perfect place to get all dolled up and look glamorous for a dinner event. Cocktails are $15 and food prices are not cheap! But you're paying for the quality of the food and the elegant setting. Unless your wallet can afford to spend this amount of cash on a regular basis then I would save this place for highly important events: birthdays, anniversaries and so on. And, after dining here you might as well stay around the area and continue your festivities elsewhere. If not, this can also be a place to visit once in a while but I wouldn't name it a regular weekend spot.This past wkend my bf and I sat at the bar (which is fairly tiny) and the place soon started to get crowded, which is why I wouldn't count much on staying by the bar the entire night. I am a fan of the restaurant! My bf and I have already agreed that this will be the place where we would like to celebrate our upcoming anniversary. Hopefully, we'll be able to visit this place before that date, but if not highly looking forward to coming here then.",4,2,4,Jess G.,"New York, NY",136,142,277

Yea, pretty late dinner, but apparently there are quite a lot of other people who eat that late also! So I know this place is not the ""new new"" but for me it was. And again, I will say, just as I did with my friends probably 10 times. ""I love this place!"" ... ""omg, this place it awesome"" lolTo enter you go through a old school pawn shop which is quite exciting. Then a wall opens up into a fancy schmancy dimly lit magical place lol.

(Note- I went on Sunday, according to my friend the other nights are much more crowded, dancing and play lame edm #sorryimnotsorry) The place wasn't too crowded just the right amount of people, which was a perfect send off.We ordered a ton of food. Keep in mind it's NYC so you are bound to pay like $15 for a small tapas plate. Deal with it. I don't think Gatsby shopped at the dollar store- let's be real.We ordered the following and I had a party in my mouth :)- Bone Marrow---Melt it your mouth goodness.- These cool spoon things filled with tomato soup and a grilled cheese dumpling like balls---Some pretty good comfort food with a twist.-Tuna wonton tacos--- Ok. - Foi Gras  =)- Rissoto scallops --- Good, but I've had better- Duck confit nachos --- Looked cool, was so full by this but my friends really liked it.I also ordered a drink- it was a green one, a gimlet of some sorts.

I want my restaurant to be about the decor certainly but it's about the food primarily, and the food here was not anything special. We tried many dishes and none of them stick out.

1.0,11/22/2014,"Came here for a birthday brunch. We had a reservation for 2pm and weren't seated until 2:45, even though our entire party was present. Things just went downhill from there. To start with, our waiter was intermittent at best - he'd appear every 10 to 15 minutes and then disappear again entirely (when we finally received our food, he never even came back to check if everything was ok), to the point where we had to start asking other waiters passing by for what we needed (a drink order, etc.). He was truly terrible and did an awful job explaining menu items, especially how they'd be served (for example, 2 members of our party ordered Huevos Rancheros, and instead of serving them separately, the two orders - which was just a paltry 4 eggs - were put on one plate, leading us to believe that we only received one of the orders as opposed to the 2 that were requested). If it was up to me (which it wasn't, since it wasn't my brunch), I would've left the waiter a 10% tip, and he barely even deserved that. The food itself was meh. In my opinion, it was exorbitantly overpriced for a minimal amount of food. I ordered the Fried Chicken Biscuit Bites, and while they were ok, they were JUST ok, not nearly worth the $14 pricetag (it only comes with 3 biscuits, by the way). Looking around the rest of the table, there was nothing that stood out to me, and my tablemates seemed equally underwhelmed. This place only gets one star from me for its decor. I must say that it's quite posh and dazzling inside, especially the skylight. Aside from that, save yourself the grief of waiting an eternity, eating sub-par, overpriced food, getting spotty service and the high noise level of being surrounded by gaggles of sorority girls recounting the exploits of their drunken evenings/weekends.",1,1,1,Amanda O.,"New York, NY",10,134,20

Service at the bar was, to put it bluntly - shady. Be careful when ordering wine by the glass. My friend ordered a nice glass of South African Sauvignon Blanc and our bartender began to fill the glass with Casillero del Diablo Sauvignon Blanc. The bottle only had enough wine for about half a glass. Without skipping a beat, our bartender opened a fresh bottle of Casillero and topped off my friend's glass. After the drinks were placed in front of us, my friend and I gave each other a quizzical look and asked the bartender if he poured the S.A. Sauvignon Blanc. He replied that he had, so we subsequently asked if we could check out the bottle. At that point he realized he was in the wrong, apologized for the mistake, and poured a new glass with the correct wine. I don't consider myself a suspicious person, but as a professional bartender, the dude had to know what he was doing.

Guided by the lingerie store keepers standing behind the counters, their fingers directing into a backroom where a large doorman grants your way. As you enter the second door into the restaurant, you notice the darker ambience of wooden tables and rows of antique chandeliers, though you still feel it roomy by high ceilings and skylights. You let the music, appropriate for the scene, river you past the bar into the seat. Seats rocky on purpose.

In addition, the presentation of the food is phenomenal. My party and I got onion rings for the table - they came in a nice pretty pyramid stack with some creamy, sweet sauce to go with them! Then came the other food - some friends had ordered lobster tacos, and I got the chile empanadas and lobster mac and cheese. The chile empanadas were yummy - they tasted great with the sauce they came with and had a slight kick that was perfect for the flavors they showed. The lobster mac and cheese was a hit! The garlicky bread crumbs added phenomenal flavor to the dish, and the lobster was well cooked and interspersed between the cheesy macaroni. A friend got the eggplant pizzetta which she enjoyed, but I think the winner of the table was the brick pressed chicken - it was cooked to perfection and on a flavorful bed of polenta and topped with some tomatoes. On the whole, however, this place was a little too pricey for my student budget. Once I start earning money, I would love to come here and try more of their entrees.

The service at B&E has never been so great every time I go. I cannot speak on behalf of the entire staff but every time I go I get ignored or receive attitude from one server or another. The food on the other hand is decent. It is an upscale restaurant so be ready for high prices and small portions. I recommend getting lots of dishes and sharing. I loved the kale and apple salad, tomato dumpling, and the grilled shrimp.

Worth every penny.Was in town for a business trip and a friend recommended this place for a late night dinner, after the description of ""speakeasy restaurant in a pawn shop"" I was 100% in. It's easy to find and after entering a small antiques pawn shop we walked through the back and entered into a really beautiful three floor 1920's-style building. We were taken upstairs and quickly seated at our table, where we spent a good ten minutes admiring the decor. Decorated with the same antiques that could be found in the pawn shop, I really loved it. Our waiter came and took our drinks and first round of food (it's all done sharing plates style) and quickly returned. This is where my taste buds started doing backflips.. every bite was so wonderful. The grilled cheese dumplings (I could eat these every day, at every meal), ribs, lobster tacos and lamb were particularly good but really everything was so great. I think we ended up ordering three times what we had planned but we just couldn't stop.I really loved the champagne bar inside the bathroom as well, and every person on staff was wonderful.

Spiral staircase, gorgeous chandelier- so perfect. And best of all- the food was great as well :) The menu/dining style is tapas and there were 6 girls so we pretty much ordered one of everything.  This gave us enough for everyone to taste. We ened up re-ordering two of the items they were so good. Tuna tacos, steak tartarte- so good. Also- they served champagne in the bathroom which also had a DJ.  I'm not from NYC so while it may be an every day occurence there; it certainly gave us a story to remember.

1.0,10/17/2014,"This is not a casual and baby friendly place. I visited only because of Brunch with my Baby's baby friendly restaurant reviews. The staff was not very friendly nor hospitable. We stood there a good 10 seconds looking boggled at the entrance. It seems like there's a counter with jewelry for sale, 3 young hostesses standing there staring at the monitors and chatting with each other before noticing us.Continuing on, because we did not have reservations, they did not have any tables available in the dining area, they sat us at the lounge area...seeing that we had a stroller (toddler sleeping). So we sat there for 5 minutes and still no server. We had to ask the coat check girl to help get a staff. The bartender, right in front of us (the lounge area) did not care about anyone other than the people at the bar and chit chatting (even though she saw us being seated).Menu, they did not offer a wide variety of food, only 5-6 items. They had side orders, which we ordered. Food was ok, not too bad...a little different. Staff did come and check up on us twice after our food came. However, it took us another 5 minutes before hailing down someone to get our check.Overall, staff is very stuck up and snobbish. They're very prejudice of people who are not stylish and of families with young children. I was hoping to have been able to try some of the food which people have mentioned and which I've seen pictures of from different sites, but they did not offer any of them so it was disappointing.

3.0,10/12/2014,"There are a few instances in outing where the ambiance precedes the food and or service being received. Sat. night, it was one of those instances. The decor and interior design of this bi-level venue was impressively reminiscent of the 1920's. Upon entry for my friend's dinner (at an unheard of 1145p), I was enamored by the long spiraling staircase to the right and the business of the crowd inside.   I went upstairs to check the scene and discovered the DJ booth at the top of the stairs and more revelers dancing away at what appeared to be more reserved spacing. I then went back down to the main floor as our party was seated. Amy, the host was seemingly pretentious but still friendly. She explained to us that the menu/dining experience is designed to be tapas style; small portioned for us all to share but that we could opt to order individually. The menu's options were immensely limited excluding the drink menu(s) of course.   I wanted to make sure to be intelligent enough to not overspend on my first time dining here and to not receive a plate small enough to not even enjoy. I decided to opt for the *Basil Pesto Ravioli* (blistered heirloom cherry tomatoes, & pecorino) while the others went for the grilled shrimp, burger, fries, and etc. but I was disappointed when I my dish arrived with six small ravioli pasta. It was satiating to my palate but was definitely too small of a portion. By the time I was done everyone was still just starting on their dishes. I tried my company's BBQ fries and some of another's salt and vinegar fries and they tasted great!   All in all I had a pretty decent experience, but nothing at all to rave about to any and everyone. Will I return? Most certainly so as it's pretty rough to judge a place on one experience. Nevertheless, I must say that this venue is way more ideal for a party or group than a couple affair as the music was very loud and the environment far from intimate. Then again, I've come to find out that they offer brunch here as well in which I'm sure isn't as crowded and loud from blaring music. NOTE: As loud as the music was all night, it was great music!

So when we walked in and realized it's one of those club/bar/restaurant places, it was already starting from behind the eight ball. We were seated in good time but at a table directly under a speaker. From that point until we left, we had spoken about 10 sentences to each other because it was just too difficult to hear what the other was saying. The waiter started out as nice but service was slow and whenever we tried to get his attention he was preoccupied by the tables on either side of us with larger parties (and I can only assume larger tips). The food....delicious. Absolutely delicious.  It was the saving grace. So good in fact, that after we were done with the first four items we ordered, we decided to be adventurous and order a few more things that sounded amazing (and more wine of course). We finally got the waiters attention and asked for another glass of wine and a menu again. Several minutes later, he brought the wine and needed to be reminded about the menu. The good news is that I got the menu! The bad news is he never returned. Fifteen minutes later we decided to pay and go. I had to rudely interrupt he conversation with the table next to us and ask for the check. ""Oh sure"" he said. ""Can I get you another glass of....no thank you, just the check please.""On our way out, we asked the hostess if Sunday brunch (which my better half had made reservations for as well) was the same atmosphere? She informed us that the music is playing but perhaps a little quieter. We cancelled our Sunday brunch reservation.

3.0,10/7/2014,"FOOD: about 3 stars - SERVICE: 1 star - AMBIANCE: 4 starsThe ambiance is very nice, very Hollywood 1920's and the fact that it is ""hidden"" behind a pawn shop made me curious enough to take a friend that was visiting town. The menu is a little limited (beware if you can't have cheese or dairy as many dishes have it and they WONT skip it if you ask them nicely to--which was a huge disappointment as I wanted to try the Garganelli). Overall I liked it but wasn't impressed as much with the food --which was good, but not great. And the service wasn't excellent either.We came on a Sunday night (8pm restaurant was in full house), the hostesses at the counter were more insipid than their chimichurri sauce, they didn't seem too happy with having us, or life itself, but at least the lady that sat us was nice enough to change our seats as per my request. I typically don't complain or mind about small things but at first I was seated on a seat that was broken. Like a totally sunken uncomfortable seat. The hostess non-chalantly suggested I moved more to the right and pushed the table to the side (extremely rude tbh, and on top of that, it was in between 2 tables that were just too close to each other, so it looked like we were gonna share dinner with strangers).We waited about 10 minutes for a another table (we had reservations btw) and finally we got better seats.The waiter came in and suggested we ordered 7 to 8 dishes since it was tapas style. I had read the menu before and was dying to try their citrus salmon ceviche but they didn't have it. Ordered the Garganelli (which is a pasta with meat (veal) sauce) with no cheese as I can't have cheese. ""Sorry, NO. we can't do that"". Ok.. It was a bit frustrating, so in the end the 2 of us ordered the 24oz Rib eye (slightly undercooked but tasty), some spring onion & potato puree (for myself only though), and the Kale & apple salad. That was good for the 2 of us. But if you are hungry then you might want to add something else. We did order the Shishito peppers but BEWARE they are extremely HOT. We couldn't eat them but it was my fault for not asking. They were nice enought to take it back.Also, I ordered the Emeral Gimlet cocktail which was good.The Rib eye comes with 4 sauces, one of them being the chimichurri sauce. That was a flop. A big fail. It just looked and tasted like a parsley paste. No flavor. It wasn't horrible, it  just wasn't real chimichurri sauce, I don't know what it was but it was bland. The nicest person we encountered was the girl in the restroom giving out complementary rosé. Overall the service was: mediocre to OK. The food was ok to good. The ambiance was: Very nice. Would I comeback? Not sure yet. Probably not.Tip to the restaurant: Don't have pretentious hostesses as they are serving to US, the customers.

Chorizo shrimp and pasta large plates are also good.The only reason I give this place 4 instead of 5 stars is that the service good be better. I've been here 5 times now and I find the servers to be a little distracted and aloof. Sometimes they try to move the tables to quickly other times they don't come back often enough. They also spilled a glass of wine on or table and floor and were haphazard with the clean up.

Ten minutes after ordering I stepped out to make a quick call and returned to find every dish we ordered crammed onto our table.  It was an impressive sight- it appeared as if the menu vomited on our table.  Salads, appetizers, pasta, main courses strategically arranged to accommodate the surface of the small table.  It was overwhelming and disappointing.About ten minutes later, the staff apparently decided it was time to begin removing our plates, irrespective of whether the plate was full.  This proved to be an issue that was difficult to resolve, as the staff had ninja-like abilities.  For instance, in a split second when my friend's head was turned, her beloved salad she was enjoying had disappeared with the staff no longer in site.  It was almost magical.  As a result, we pleaded with them to stop and asked them to keep our dishes on the table. The ninja magic continued approximately every three minutes. We snapped.  Subsequently, they returned and attempted to take my cocktail, which was half full, but I was ready for them and politely grabbed the ninja's arm.  We had enough, got the check, and fled.The food we were able to eat was good.  A little heavy on the salt, but good.

4.0,9/20/2014,"Tapas/family style brunch. Best if you come with a group (3-4) people so that you can try a variety of goodies. Also recommend making a reservation, because brunch anywhere in the city equals plenty of waiting. Hangry waiting. Don't put yourself in that situation. Once you get inside, you will be shocked by how large the venue actually is. It is beautifully and modernly decorated, classy and sexy. Food comes in sets of 3-4 but they can increase the number of each according to the number in your party. This leads to everyone getting to try everything.Bombdotcom would be the mini chocolate croissants because the proportion of chocolate to flaky outside goodness is too great to be beat. Lemon ricotta pancakes were fluffy and delicious, despite me not liking lemon in my baked goods. Truffle chicken meatballs were really good, especially when you get a large dallop of sauce and ricotta on it. Grilled cheese dumplings with tomato soup on a spoon were tasty, and adorable. Everyone devoured the lobster tacos, which actually had a good sized chunk of lobster in them. Eggplant pizzeta was surprisingly extremely tasty with little fried eggplants on top and a crispy crust. Free range scrambled eggs were also suprisingly delicious. Drinks are alcohol-heavy, so have some fun. The virgin drinks are also delicious.

5.0,9/19/2014,"Roy's Top 5 Things to Know:1. Great trendy, sexy restaurant in lower Manhattan. The restaurant itself is hidden behind a pawn shop. 2. Highlights of the meal were the tuna tacos, salt and vinegar fries, and the tomato, bacon, cheese dumplings. Those dumplings were slamming. Keep in mind these were all small portions. 3. Also had the chicken meatballs which were so so, added tomato sauce from the dumplings since the meatballs were dry. The lobster tacos were okay, the white sauce that it came with was essential to it. The blueberry cheesecake was okay as well, probably wouldn't order it again. 4. Ordered white wine, pinot grigio, go with the $68 bottle of pinot grigio instead of the $40 one, huge difference. 5. With a place like this of course the service was immaculate, timely, friendly, knowledgeable on the menu, waitress gave great recs, just on point. But this place is very pricey for the portions you get. You'll either leave with a hit to your wallet or hungry.",5,0,0,Roy C.,"Manhattan, NY",36,143,87
3.0,9/19/2014,I would have given it four stars if it wasn't for the hit and misses on the dishes we tried.   This was my second visit to the establishment and second time I was taken on a roller-coaster culinary experience.  So many ups and downs I couldn't really get sense of it.  One moment I thought I had the best tomato tartar and then wen had a bite tuna wonton taco I thought I was having refrigerated food.  The same with the drinks; some were great and some were lacking. On a positive note; the room was filled after 10pm on a Sunday and the music wasn't too bad.   It can get loud on that second floor so the atmosphere is not for everyone. I'm not quite sure if I will be returning any time soon as there are so many new interested place to take my chances with.,1,1,1,Eros A.,"New York, NY",422,319,25
4.0,9/15/2014,"I went here a few weeks back for my girlfriends birthday in a group of 7. Upon arrival I was so confused. When you look at this place from the streets its a pawn shop, NO JOKE. But once you go inside and they open the big door within the pawn shop its the restaurant. I made late reservations at around 1030pm. It was poppin' at this hour!We walked in and talked to the hostesses and they handed us a beeper and said that it'd be a few minutes.My girls and I went to the bar and ordered some drinks. The bar was super packed but still manageable. I had the bartender make us whatever, it turned out to be really good. As we waited we visited the upstairs lounge area. Basically a room with a bar with people who weren't interested in eating. We waited about 15-20 minutes...you'd think that people stopped eating at this time but not on Fridays they don't and not in NY. The 7 of us get sat at a round table towards the back. The decor is dark, velvetty and the ambiance LOUD, music LOUD, it was like clubbing and eating at the same time. High five if your a fan! 8)We ordered a bunch of things as a group. I specifically ordered the kale and apple salad served with apples, sweet pecans, pancetta, and goat cheese and salmon. The portions were medium, but delicious! The salmon was served with couscous. Great combo and very good. I also tried my friends dish the Lobster and Squid Ink Tagliatelle. Which was thick black noodles with a buttery sauce with chunks of lobster. Great dish!Over all great place. It's a must try when in NY...but I won't be frequenting this place for dinner cause you can;t hear each other talk.

Chicken meatballs were huge and were so good that they didn't even taste like what you would think a chicken meatball should taste like(yes think about it). The gravy and whipped potato that the meatball is served with is to die for. I would not recommend the tuna dish, it had a bit too much black sesame.Dessert we had the smore and something + box of doughnuts.

They use a special sauce for their onion rings which is HORRIBLE quite frankly.Lobster Tacos ($21): Delicious! Was still disappointed when they only served 3 lobster tacos on a tray. They were so tiny.Dumpling soup ($14) Amazing! Ridiculously good!Here's what I didn't like. If this restaurant is attempting to give off a high-end/Sex in the City vibe...you kind of ruin it when you have your waitresses dressing in club attire.  The dress code for waiters/waitresses should be a wee bit more professional.What I hated the most....while I am eating, why is a waiter coming to the table to take away my plate before I even bit into my lobster taco? I was extremely turned off by that because I felt rushed to finish my meal. Allow the customer to actually enjoy their meal and their conversation instead of rushing them out of your restaurant where we are already paying an arm and a leg for small portions.This is a place where you take a 1st date IF you're trying to impress her.

2.0,9/1/2014,"Beauty & Essex is an exquisite space located in the back of a pawn shop. By day, it's a  glitzy brunch joint, and by night, an upscale speakeasy. I've been at both times but was very disappointed with their brunch. To sum it up: miniscule portions, pricey, and slow service. It's a tapas style joint with a menu that ranges from red velvet waffles to fried chicken biscuits. This is more a place to impress out-of-towners who want a glamorous New York brunch than a legitimately good restaurant. Some of the dishes are tasty, but you'll literally get a bite and a half of each item and leave feeling hungry lest you are willing to drop $50+.3 is the magic number, as most of the plates come with 3 items. We ordered 6 dishes and my friends each had a cocktail. We spent about $40-55 each, much more than I'm normally willing to spend on brunch. Unfortunately, service also felt incredibly slow and I was starving as we waited for the dishes to come out.What we ate:Lobster tacos ($21) - probably the best dish, with a decent amount of lobster, but still really small for the price point. You could easily just get a big lobster roll for less. It also falls apart and is pretty hard to eat.Chile relleno empanada ($13) - this was tasty and I loved the jalapeno-lime sauce on the side. Would recommend.Lobster mac n' cheese ($15) - Only OK. This dish was way too cheesy/salty/overdone for my liking, but it's pretty filling compared to the other items.Red velvet waffles ($12) - We got it for the novelty factor, but it was utterly disappointing. It's so bland and, again, small (literally consumed in one bite).Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs ($16) - I was intrigued by the truffle and sheep's milk ricotta but again, a dish that's drowning in cheese and extremely overdone. Fried Chicken Biscuit Bites ($14) - This was good! If you like savory dishes for brunch with a kick, definitely get this. It comes with a tabasco honey butter.IN SUMMATION:Go if you like people watching, pretty spaces, and chandeliers over your head while you dine.Don't go if you want a really delicious, economical brunch or if you're in a hurry.",4,0,0,Valerie L.,"San Francisco, CA",245,652,2

The food was OK.  The 7 of us ordered like 8 dishes. I loved the tuna tacos, but that was the only memorable things to me. Maybe another one was the bacon cheese tomatoes in the spoons. Other than that, the rest was not very impressive, although they did have some innovative dishes there.Another thing is, before we went, we called the place about their dress code, and they said no shorts, no tank tops, no sneakers, etc. Basically no casual dressing. However I saw many people dressed very casually, one of them even had the tank top, basketball shorts, and a cap on... everything that's on the ""No"" list.....

Patrick, one of the managers, is an amazing individual and blew us away with customer service. The whole restaurant vibe is worth experiencing and can't really be explained over yelp. Now for the food.... YUM!!!! Patrick was very nice and allowed us to experience the grilled cheese dumplings (heaven) while enjoying a drink before being seated.

4.0,8/17/2014,"Really enjoy this place. It's very much one of those loud-ish, trendier places in LES, but a very fun vibe. The front is designed to look like a pawn shop, and then you walk into a gigantic two floor restaurant. Arrived at 7:45 for a 7:30 reservation and was seated immediately, but do note, they wait for the entire party to be there before letting you sit.Cocktails are great here - and the cocktail menu is quite large, so there's really something for all tastes. This past time I had the Ruby Mojito - definitely not a classic mojito (not as minty), but the raspberry lemon soda added a nice touch. My boyfriend got The Woodsman, which he liked (had 2 of them), but said it was a bit watered down each time - overall he liked the flavor though. I've also been when not drinking alcohol, and they have a few great virgin juices and drinks.We're vegetarian, and the menu is not extremely friendly for that, but they were accommodating - we split everything between the table. Their ""Jewels on Toast"" are great - very flavorful and mostly veg friendly! We had the Hot + Sweet Marinated Tomatoes and the Avocado, Lemon + Espelette. The tomato had a great kick to it, but a nice contrast of flavor. The avocado was thick and creamy, and was my favorite part of the meal. The rest of the table also had the Chile Relleno' Empanadas, which I didn't have since I don't eat fried food, but they were all eaten and enjoyed. We were also able to order the Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings - without bacon (but they did put it on the side, as one dining companion did eat meat). The dumplings were great - each served on an individual spoon, with great zesty tomato soup on the bottom and a smoked cheese on top of a puff pillow - delicious and creamy! Also split the Roasted Sweet Corn - avocado pieces were small in this, but the lemon had a nice citrus kick to it, and the overall flavor of this dish was very strong (in a good way). Finally we split the Broccolini - this was a bit saltier than I'd had from B&E in the past, but a nice taste of garlic and chile.Service was a bit slower than I've had in the past, but very friendly and food had something for everyone!

The trifecta!My first visit based on a recommendation of a friend and I could not have been more pleased. As noted in some of the other postings, you'd never know the place was a restaurant/club from the exterior, which is a pawn shop, but walk through the pawn shop, open the door and be prepared to be impressed.First the atmosphere which I would describe as hip with an air of sophistication. Mostly locals from what I could gather as you're not likely to find this place unless you're looking for it. On a Friday night, I had only a short wait to get a spot at the bar which is where I ate and watched the crowd. By 8:30 the place was crowded but not packed. The food was wonderful. I started with the roasted bone marrow as an app, then moved to lobster tacos and both were outstanding.  The Service: Perfect. Unlike so many NYC restaurants, the bar staff here are friendly and eager to make recommendations. Suzie who waited on me has taken the meaning of service to an entirely new level. Prompt, attentive, and friendly, she makes you feel like she's really glad you're there. Try getting that elsewhere.Upstairs is the club with a DJ playing a mix of 80s to current music.

Ordered coffee, she pushed cappuccino, order 3 waffles she pushed for 4, ordered 6 plates for the table she pushed for 10.

5.0,8/11/2014,"After waiting to be seated until about 8:40pm for our 8:00pm reservation, which wasn't ideal, the rest of our night was a wonderful experience.Unaware that there was a dress code, We were told to show up 15 minutes prior to our reservation, so we stood and waited in the entrance for a bit until a table opened up at the bar. The Beauty & The Beet cocktail was fantastic - highly recommended.After closing out our bar tab, we brought our drinks upstairs to our table. The whole decor of the place is very appealing. It's dark inside (you walk in through a pawn shop and the ambiance instantly surrounds you), and there are picture frames with velvet backgrounds and jewelry lining the walls. Nearly all dishes are intended for sharing. The portion comes with a certain number of pieces for each dish, but they are very accommodating and will gladly add a piece or two to match the number in your party (we were a party of 4). For our meal, we ate the following:Green Gazpacho Shot - This game to our table on the house at the beginning of the meal. It was delicious, and a great way to cleanse the palate before eating.Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings - These were incredible. A picture of them was our inspiration to make a reservation in the first place, and they did not disappoint.Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos - Also incredible. Definitely worth ordering.Flash Seared Tuna - Delicious, but a bit too peppery.Pan Roasted Scallops - Perfectly cooked and delicious.Heritage Baby Back Ribs - The meat one these was incredibly tender and fell right off the bone. Would absolutely recommend.Roasted Sweet Corn - A good side, but not crucial to order.Salt & Vinegar Fries - These were incredible. I am a huge fan of salt and vinegar chips, but had never imagined the same seasoning on french fries. I would also highly recommend ordering these.Our server recommended ordering 8 dishes (depending on size) for our party of 4. We ordered 7, and the 7 dishes listed above were perfectly filling for our group. However, there were many more dishes on the menu that we would have loved to try.

You don't need to dress up. Basically you can come in here with a t-shirt, jeans and flip flop and no one will say anything. Attire on Yelp shouldn't even be dressy. Should change it to casual. We were seated quickly at a 6pm reservation. We ordered the1) Cranberry Lorraine (cocktail) $15.00 Pricey, glass was small, nothing special, no cranberry taste, should have gotten the virgin cocktail which was much cheaper at $6.00 :( 2) Bone Marrow Toast $17.00. A must try. If you love fat and oil, you'll love this. You get two bones with fat on it. You get six pieces of small toast so you can spread your fat on it atop with salt, shallots and some greens. 3) Tomato Soup Dumplings: $14 recommendation by the waitress saying it was their signature dish. Basically cheese balls with bacon sprinkles on a spoon with tomato sauce.4) Chicken meatball $18: too crumbly and mushy. 5) Beauty and Essex Burger $18.00: if I knew and read the ingredient I would not order this because I don't like blue cheese or whatever cheese it had in there it just ruins the taste. The bbq fries was seasoned well. Only 1 restroom for table service area. Overall too pricey for tapas.",0,0,0,Carmen L.,"New York, NY",8,235,2458

Women's bathroom serves champagne and has a seating area where you can hang out away from the chaos of the main dining area.  Only downside was the waiter's push to get rid of us once we were done eating...us southern girls take our time, and we don't appreciate the overly attentive.",2,0,0,Catherine C.,"New Orleans, LA",84,108,59

There's a champagne bar and a lounge area in the girl's bathroom and the second floor is basically a club. The staff members were also surprisingly friendly and not snotty at all.

Came in with a large group and were very pleased at how they were able to add extras to each appetizer so there were enough pieces for each person. I ordered the baby back ribs as my main entree. They were DELICIOUS! Would have given 5 stars if the waitress had been a bit more friendly. We brought in a birthday cake which they charged us 5 bucks person for cutting fee (no big deal). The cake was HUGE! They took the cake to the back and gave each of us a tiny slice of it. We called the waitress over to ask if she could bring out seconds for a couple people and she proceeded to roll her eyes and try to tell us that the cake was divided evenly among 6 people which was obvious by our entire table that was not true. She came back 5 minutes later with a slice a cake and said ""my fault"" and scuffled off quickly. So she was really my only bone to pick! We were also asked to move to the lounge area since I guess they needed the table for another reservation. The manager was however very polite in asking and also gave us a round of drinks on the house. The decor and atmosphere are very lovely. Love the fact you have to enter through a pawn shop.

Our dinner consisted of the steak tartare, bone marrow, lobster mac & cheese and the seared tuna.  I enjoyed how the steak tartare is on a sticky rice cake while the bone marrow is served with the shallot marmalade along with the usual toast and sea salt.  I also enjoyed the crusted tuna.  For desset, I had the butterscotch which was good. Ambiance: The restaurant is good for large parties.  Granted I went on a Sunday which is probably a quieter night (The restaurant is still full), I saw many couples but this place is good with a good group of friends who enjoy sharing small bites and delicious cocktail drinks listening to a more popular genre of music.  This is my second time coming to the restaurant.  First time was with my girlfriends and even though both were different experiences, I appreciated the complimentary champagne in the women's bathroom and enjoyed both times equally.  Kudos Chris Santos for providing this type restaurant in the lower east side!",0,0,0,Mai F.,"Manhattan, NY",177,4,2

The inside of the restaurant is gorgeous, and everyone from the host to the bussers were very friendly. The waiter we had, however, was SO PUSHY. He kept saying that us 6 girls should order two plates each (WTF) and all share everything. I know there's a large group of us, but we're not going to eat two plates each. He kept coming back and asking us which dishes we were going to order. We were too busy catching up and waiting on our other friends that we weren't making any progress. When we tried to ask to order one plate while we ordered, he insisted that we order everything at the same time. He was really annoyed of us.What we got:Warm Lemon Blueberry Scones (+) - The scones itself were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Paired with the peach jam, these pastries were the perfect start to our meal.Short rib huevos rancheros (++) -  I just ate this for brunch, and the waiter gave me a stank face and goes ""Are you sure that's gonna be enough? It comes in two pieces."" It was two sunny side eggs paired with tender short rib and crispy tortilla. I was full. SUCK IT.Eggplant pizzetta - It was good. For listing on the menu that it's ""Crispy Eggplant Pizzetta"" it was actually soggy, probably because it was warm, but still it was soggy. Mimosas - Standard. I like how they're pulpy. That's not everyone's favorite, though.Earl the pearl - basically an alcoholic Arnold Palmer. It was good, but it didn't look/taste like anything special.Overall, this is a classic brunch place to go with your date or girl friends. I have been here for brunch before, and the service is always impeccable.

This place is a healthy surprise when you walk in. They have a pawn shop in the front which sort of confuses you if it's a restaurant at all. But once you go past the pawn shop it's a nice upscale restaurant. My friend picked this cause she is a Chris Santos fan and wanted to find a place with a right balance of vegetarian and meat dishes. Plus since they have tapas/small plates, you can try out a lot of stuff and get something for everyone.I don't remember the drinks that everyone got, but it was an assortment of cocktails, beers, scotches and margaritas which were all pretty good.We ordered the below items (not in any particular order) and maybe some specials that I can't see on the menu right now.Tomato TartareRoasted Bone MarrowKale & Apple SaladChile Relleno' EmpanadasCrispy Eggplant PizzettaOven Braised Chicken MeatballsBasil Pesto RavioliSpaghettiniFlash Seared TunaThe best out of the lot was the spaghettini and the tuna and since we had equal number of vegetarians and meat eaters in the group, it worked out well.

There was also a miscommunication about the desserts where we got cupcakes instead of the ice cream/sorbets but that wasn't a big deal. What really ruined everything was that they charged me two times for the food. It was my first time using a gilt coupon and going there and it was honestly a disaster. I ended up paying $159.21 for finger sized food. Not even a baby would have gotten full. I tries calling them and was redirected and called back over 4 times. They said it was fixed but according to my bank account, nothing was fixed. I swear it's a whole loop with them. They'll be fast to take your money but slow to give it back when they're the ones who messed up. If I had known this would have happened I would have just gone there without the coupon or just gone somewhere else. Completely ruined my date with my boyfriend. That's what I get for trying the whole coupon thing. Never again. Never using gilt for food and never coming here again. This was the most expensive brunch I've ever had and it wasn't even great.

However, it is not the case here!We ordered some cocktails at the bar while waiting for our friend. I had the ""Beauty Elixer and my friend had ""The woodsman"". It tasted pretty average and I could not taste much  alcohol inside. It also took forever for our bartender to give our changes back when we were paying the drinks. And they do not transfer your bill to the table.After our last friend finally arrived, we were finally being taken to a table. We ordered roasted bone marrow, house salad, Beauty and Essex burger, and grilled double cut lamp chops to share. Overall the portion was larger than I expected and we all got really full ( 2 guys and 2 girls). I didn't like the bone marrow that much as it was quite greasy. However the lamb chops came out to be very tender and delicious. The burger and salad were also pretty well seasoned and were above average.Despite the great quality of our meals, the waiters here were very pushy and wants to take your order ASAP and get you to order desserts ASAP and get you to pay your check ASAP.

If you're going to the restaurant then you will probably be less impressed. The food mostly tasted rich, heavy & cheap to me. Beef carpaccio was all right, but it's a difficult dish to ruin. I loved that they served some microgreens with it, but hated the bacon crumbles. The bitter greenss plus the bacon bits overpowered the flavor of the carpaccio. The salmon ceviche was a little too sweet and too citrusy, and not as fresh & flavorful as I would've liked. You really couldn't tell what kind of fish it was by tasting it. The tomato soup with grilled cheese dumplings were just awful. I am positive they are using canned Campbell's soup. This may be a wonderful, nostalgic flavor for some people, but I couldn't have been more disappointed. The grilled cheese dumplings were not dumplings, they were more like a mini round piece of toast with cheese in the center. The eggplant pizzetta was all right. It had two kinds of cheese, and way too much of both. The chicken under a brick was all right, but again too cheesy. It wasn't awful, I'd go again, mostly for the atmosphere. Also, the food all came out way too fast. They were bringing tow items at a time, and bringing another round when we had barely even started on the first item. They need to figure out the timing on that a little better. The waiter suggested we order 7 items to share, and my date (who is a pretty big guy) and I were full before the fourth one was done.",0,0,0,Anne H.,"Old Greenwich, CT",0,143,1
5.0,7/5/2014,"I have used yelp to plan my life in New York for the last 3 years at least and I am ashamed to say this is my first review, but as they say better late than never!  I am rating Beauty & Essex a five cause it truly is awesome and I am very glad to have this be my first review (of many more to follow).My wife and I decided to skip the 4th of July fireworks and came here for a nice dinner instead, and we couldn't be happier with our decision.  We started the night with some cocktails, she had the Old Dirty Bramble and I had the Woodmans, both were very good but I am sure the others are as well.For appetizers we had the grilled cheese and empanadas, and for dinner we had the spaghettini and brick chicken and broccolini as a side. All of it very good. I highly recommend the chicken and the sauce for the broccolini was Asian flavors done very simple but delicious.  They also were super accommodating for my wife, who is vegetarian, and had no problem serving 3 of the 6 grilled cheeses without bacon. For dessert we shared the s'mores tart with some cappuccino/macchiato and it a perfect balance of sweet and salty.  Overall the experience lived up to the hype!  We are fortunate to come on a night when the place wasn't super busy which worked well for us.  I would recommend this for anyone looking for a special night out and looking to eat and drink well in a very chic place.  We will definitely return and look to try some of the other things on the menu.",4,0,0,Rahul D.,"Manhattan, NY",4,23,0
4.0,7/5/2014,"Gorgeous restaurant- there's a reason ""Beauty"" is in the name of the restaurant.  The dramatic oval skylight was the focal point in the middle of the restaurant and we sat at a table right at the edge so I could gaze at it throughout my meal. Tables are a bit close together...it was a bit uncomfortable with a couple practically sitting in my lap at the table beside me.Love the Pink Panther cocktail- gin, St Germain, pink peppercorn...so pretty and very tasty.  Scrambled eggs with eggplant on tiny pieces of toast was not really worth its price, though it was tasty.  The grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings, served on the soup spoons you usually use with Asian soup noodles, were delicious...gooey little bites with a little bit of crunch on the edges of the bread, and complimented by the tangy tomato soup as a sauce.  The kale, goat cheese, and apple salad was delicious...definitely recommend this to balance out the carb-heavy brunch menu. The storefront antique pawn shop is a unique lobby area, leading to the host station and bar area.  Convenient location just down the street from the subway stop.  On the day I was heading to Beauty and Essex, there was a police-escorted cavalcade of motorcycles going by....interesting to watch go by while in front of the restaurant.",2,0,0,Lucy W.,"Atlanta, GA",18,1033,683

Spoke to the manager who didn't even know the employee's name, who didn't resolve the situation. This situation totally destroyed my experience, as a server from what I know you are suppose to please your guest. Anyway horrible experience and racism is still alive sad to say.

A couple of my friends and I got there before the rest of the group so we were waiting at the bar, the bartender was a bit unfriendly and looked miserable. When we finally did sit down at our table our server was nice but I think she was brand new. She completely forgot one of my friends order and then tried to throw it back on my friend for confusing her- it was odd. But besides the sub-par service, the food was ridiculously good. It is a bit pricey for the portion size, but it's good to try at least once. The ambiance was nice as well, the dining room is really large and open.

4.0,6/29/2014,"Review by Paige is accurate! i too had a similar experience Friday night. I have had some great service upstairs in the past, but Friday this waitress was trying to ""layer the sale"" hard. She acted as though she had to authorize our food selections with management. (Are you getting a bonus on receipts on top of you 25% tip I left- even after your bad attitude)  We spent over $200 on drinks, food and an order of delicious warm donuts with dipping sauce.note that  this was AFTER we had already been to Gemma (Bowery Hotel) for drinks and dinner.  We were there to eat, drink and socialize - not buy a car. I had a $50 voucher from Open Table to apply (we eat out a lot).  She only applied a $20 credit and I had to chase her down to fix it. I now have 2 $200+ pending charges on my credit card! Ive been here about 10 times over the last 2 years. Not sure ill ever go back. While the food is good - lobster tacos, dumplings, empanadas and grilled cheeses bites - it wasn't fantastic.  Note to waitress - Be pleasant, not pushy it goes a long way. Had a great experience at STK rooftop and at Revel ((both in meatpacking) Saturday evening.   There is  a lot of competition for your $ in the city, I'm just saying.",5,1,1,Susan M.,"Narragansett, RI",74,264,330
3.0,6/29/2014,"I really love the concept of this restaurant and was a huge fan until my last visit. I had a reservation for 4 for later on a Friday night and it was pretty crowded. Our waitress was borderline rude insisting we put in a ""full order"" before she submitted our order to the kitchen (we weren't sure how much food we would be hungry for). Wasn't a fan of that type of pressure especially since our food order wasn't skimpy and we were already two rounds of drinks in. The waitress also overcharged us $30. I'm giving 3 stars for the unique and usually pretty delicious food menu. However, there are tons of places in the city with both great food and great service!",1,1,1,Paige E.,"New York, NY",8,14,0

The entrance is in a pawn shop, then it opens into a beautiful restaurant and bar with a second floor. I had the grilled cheese, smoked bacon tomato soup dumpling and fries which were excellent and was just enough for a late dinner coming off a plane from LA. The smores tart was ddellisshh. Music was hip hop tonight, and the crowd was lovely. Fun place to go with friends, maybe not a date place as it's quite loud.

4.0,6/27/2014,"Disclaimer - this is a bar/drinks review!Beauty & Essex, what can I say? The idea is brilliant to use a pawn shop front as the cover to this intriguing speakeasy. When you finally make it past the pawn shop into the bar/restaurant you are regaled by the Gilded Age decor. It is similar to a scene out of the Great Gatsby all down to intricate gold plating on the doors. There are two levels to this place. The first level has a bar in the front and then a restaurant towards the back. Take the windy staircase to the second floor and here you find a lounge area for sitting and chatting in a bigger group and another bar area. The drinks here are definitely on point.

4.0,6/24/2014,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Beauty and Essex.  We found the place through a buzzfeed article about hidden restaurants in NYC and we were not disappointed. The atmosphere was hip but welcoming. The dress code is kind of vague. About half of the customers were more casual than I expected. I would dress nicer next time to be on the nicer side. The food was delicious: small plates made to share. Our favorites were the grilled cheese dumplings and the New York bagel. Definitely will recommend this restaurant to someone looking for an adventure.,0,0,0,Joel C.,"New York, NY",1,21,1

5.0,6/23/2014,"Where do I even begin. I've been here a few times on date nights and its always a winner. I went this Friday with a group of what was suppose to be 8 but ended up being 16 and most of the party was over an hour late. There is a ton of security but there aren't pretentious, they were super helpful & funny even helping me down (part of) the two flights of stairs to women room in my 6 inch sandals, after watching my drunken self stumble like a new born deer.   Once the manager (DAVID) realized there were too many of us, he instantly put his cape on to save the day. As a hospitality professional I can honestly say David went above and beyond for us. At first we were just going to get two tables, not wanting to separate us David give us what I assume was the VIP section in the lounge area. At first we were told we could only order drinks & apps. But then David said we could do a pre fixed menu which was fine for most of us. After David saw some guests responses, he allowed us to order from the regular menus. Again with my profession being what it is I understand that David was being literally http.www.DABOMB.com Lol.    Our Waitress was ok you could tell she wasn't pleased with such a big party so late in the night, and we completely understood. The food wasn't as good as I remembered but every single drink I had was soooooo good. My only other complaint was the food trickling out. I received my entree first and it was a good 15 minutes before everyone else. So once I dined my ravioli was super cold but still good.   All in all this is easily on of my favorite restaurants, I'm a tough critic but place is the sugar honey iced tea.

4.0,6/22/2014,"One word: AH-MAZING. Besides the on-point music, the great atmosphere and decor, and great bits of tastings - this place is literally a gem, hidden behind a pawn shop. First, we ordered some drinks - I got the Ruby Ice Tea which was sweetened with a burst of mint and lemon. We ordered a few brunch staples such as the warm blueberry lemon scones with a thyme orange jam, 'jewels on toast' which were hot and sweet tomatoes- midori sriracha, house made ricotta and arugula. The scones were warm and slightly sweet, but not overpowering, and the jam was a perfect addition- sweet, but not sour with a hint of thyme. Although the tomato toast was a slightly small plate, it was a perfect bite filled with ripe tomatoes and creamy ricotta. For the main course, we got the chile relleno empanadas with a crispy exterior and a perfect amount of cheese with a jalapeño lime crema that was creamy and light to top off. Lastly, the eggplant pizzeta was a thin as paper pizza with a thicker-than-average pizza sauce and ricotta, topped with crispy fried eggplant rounds. I have to say the plates are small but filling. The atmosphere is exciting and the music is on point. I would recommend this for a girls brunch out or taking friends from out of town to lunch.",1,0,0,Krutika D.,"San Francisco, CA",195,84,5

5.0,6/18/2014,"I thought I'd never give an establishment five stars, but trust me, this place is worth it. From the ambiance to the decor, to the attitude of the servers and the timing of the food, the bathroom (that's right, they serve champagne there), the cocktails and  of course... The tapas. Every single one of everything we ordered was perfection. Every single one. Chris Santos, you're almost a genius. It's kind of difficult to get spoiled like that. I almost feel like I don't want to eat anywhere else. You can even dance upstairs or just lounge after meals. So here's the breakdown of what we ordered:Cocktails: Smooth Criminal, Ruby Mojito and Earl The Pearl - not what I ordered, but I tasted it and it's the best among these three well balanced cocktails. If you have already perused the menu and your stomach was set on certain things, chances are you couldn't go wrong because I felt like everything was that good. However, for me the lobster tacos, the Calabash Fried Oyster and the pan roasted scallopsare a must try. We couldn't decide on one dessert so we  ordered three. S'mores tart, pot de creme and the doughnuts. All were a delight. And if you must only order one then I feel bad for you.

Plenty of great options!

For dessert we had 6 scoops of ice cream. They were all delicious but the Hash was didn't appeal to me. I couldn't tell if there was lobster in it. It was more than enough food because we got complimentary order of empanadas which was delicious and an order of Red Velvet Waffled and extra orders of the Grilled Cheese Tomato soup. Extra food that's always a plus! We left the place full and satisfy.My favorite would definitely be the Red Velvet Waffles, Lemon Black Berry Pancakes and the Fried Chicken Bites.I liked the decortations but it is a bit loud.

1.0,6/3/2014,"Went here with friends for a celebration. Three problems:1. The food was not great - nothing exciting or special, everything I tried was average and nothing was remarkable. The smoked salmon flatbread was chewy and not very good. The frittata was a little bouncy tasteless and the potatoes were terrible, they just tasted fried with no complexity. My friend's drink was so poorly made he had to send it back. This of course would be a reason to give a place 3 stars or maybe 2 for an expensive restaurant. However, the other two problems caused me to rate this as a 1. 2. My best friend is a vegan and the waiter could not understand that vegan and ""gluten free"" are two separate dietary restrictions. He kept offering her gluten free options with meat. At this price point and in a major city not being able to accommodate a simple dietary restriction seems extremely odd. In fact, she was offered the potatoes as a vegan alternative and they arrived with cheese. I do not understand this terrible service.3. We were a large party with different dietary restrictions ranging from religious to personal. We ordered a number of dishes some to share some for individuals and said as much to the waiter. He added additional portions without asking and charged us for them. For example, for a three meatball portion he added an extra two meatballs (which we did not eat) and charged us for them without asking prior to service. I would be very careful about specifying the number of items ordered. Our party was charged an additional fifty-seventy dollars without being asked.

The lower level  has  a seating area in the ladies room and an attendant that serves free champagne.I love places that are well thought out; all it takes is one thing; but Beauty & Essex has many little things that make it interesting.Small Bites and Cocktails:Lobster Tacos Are Excellent- however, watch out for the red cabbage slaw if you are looking cute in a light colored outfit, because it will stain.And we wouldn't want this to sour a sexy evening out now would we?NY Strip on pretzel- very good choice with a lil' touch of mustard. Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings- Mouth Party-A MUSTTempura Vidalia Onion Rings with blue cheese dip- YOU WANT THIS! So GoodMiso Glazed Baby Eggplant ginger, snow peas, toasted sesame-Flavorful. Get your own too small to really share.S'mores Tart- All about presentation here. Not the best desert you'll ever have.Crowd Pleasers:Emerald Gimlet and The Pink Panther - Fresh clean and citrusy.

4.0,5/26/2014,"I've known about this place for a while now but the mixed reviews kept it away from the top of my must-try list. However, when a friend of mine got engaged this seemed like a great place for some celebratory drinks.First, a few words on the space. It is gorgeous! I expected nothing less as the folks from AvroKO were responsible for the design. The pawn shop façade is cool but once you step in you instantly see how everything is designed to exude glamour. I didn't really check out the upstairs but the lower level itself is very beautiful. I can see now why some of my girlfriends love this spot. Or why women in general would. My friend and I almost felt a little under dressed. So as far as the atmosphere goes it's perfect for a girls night out or for the menfolk out there, for those times when you're going out on a date and want to impress her. Of course, all this glamour does mean the menu is on the pricey side. And since we didn't have any food I can't say whether it's worth it or not.. As for the drinks, aside from a good list of wine and spirits the cocktail program is pretty good. I'm a bourbon girl so I immediately gravitated towards The Woodsman cocktail. The allspice, maple syrup and pears combination was perfect even though it's definitely more of a fall cocktail. So yes, I wouldn't mind coming back for drinks but again, at $16 a cocktail I have to admit that I'd rather go to The Nomad. In any case, if you've never been give it a try and see for yourself. I for one will probably grab a GILT discount and come back for weekend brunch.",0,0,0,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",227,1549,2438

3.0,5/24/2014,"My experience is very fresh since i just walked into my home and laid down in bed after spending an hour in B&E. I was expecting  A LOT MORE ELEGANCE! The pawn shop leading into the lounge/restaurant is nothing spectacular. It's just a white walled room with instruments on the wall and a few glass cases full of jewelry and stuff.  Then they open the door to the lounge and yeah the first floor is nice. There's a bar/restaurant there and the people look like the clientele that I was expecting that can afford $15+ drinks but THEN you go upstairs to the main loungy area and boy is it GHETTO! Looks like the people from the surrounding projects were hanging out up there. In the women's room they were all laying on the couches and taking selfies. Definitely not what i was expecting or cared for. The ""chic"" vibe definitely died upstairs. I give it 3 stars because downstairs was alright and i enjoyed my shrimp cocktail and chocolate layer cake.

We were seated promptly and had the nicest waiter, Adonis. He was so sweet and gave us his recommendations from the menu and the most popular dishes without sounding pushy at all. (The front of house staff seemed a little snooty so I wasn't expecting the waiters to be so personable but I was pleasantly surprised). The food: My brother got the ribeye for himself and onion rings which were both very good. The steak came with 4 delicious sauces. My parents and I ate kind of tapas style. We shared the kale and apple salad - MUST have! Great way to start the meal. We also had the empanadas - very good but nothing outstanding, I would try something else next time. The guajillo shrimp were AMAZING! I loved the mango and white bean salsa on top. And lastly, the scallops were my favorite part. Perfectly cooked and seasoned with some risotto underneath, not too heavy but just enough to complete the dish. For dessert, we all shared the peanut butter chocolate semifreddo and the smores  tart. Both were delicious but the smores tart was my favorite. All in all, we had a great meal. I'm happy we went early because it gets pretty noisy. So I will definitely be back for an early dinner with the family...or a later dinner and drinks with my friends. Also looking forward to try brunch one day!",0,0,0,Ashley G.,"New York, NY",378,17,7

4.0,5/23/2014,"Came here for my birthday with a friend. Had such a great night. It was so fancy and elegant with such a chic vibe, we really had a fun night. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, is because they messed up with giving us our table in time. We had reservations for 10:30. When we entered the place was pretty packed. Music was  playing and people were mingling and dancing around the bar. We were given a beeper type device, and said we would be seated shortly. We did not leave the building at all.. We went upstairs to hang out, and mainly stood in the bathroom. Drinking champaign and hanging out on the couches that were down there because upstairs was pretty packed. It's now 11:30pm and we are getting tipsy from the cheap champaign and we are starving. We go upstairs to see what's going on with our table. Apparently they said they were paging us for some time, but we never received a page. Other then that the food was very good. It's a tapas place everything is meant to be shared. We had the bone marrow with little crusted bread toast, scallops, steak tartar, lobster tacos and at the end we had a cupcake! I personally loved the bone marrow. Just spread it on the toast with the onions and with the salt on the block. Wow! It was like eating a steak without the steak. I was not a fan of the steak tartar, but everything else was amazing.

3.0,5/17/2014,I've been twice to this place and both times I have felt the same way. The food is great. I've tried  a few of the appetizers and my favs are the lobster Mac and cheese and the  eggplant pizza. For entree you must try the ribs with salt and vinegar fries. The dessert is amazing. They serve these warm tiny filled jelly donuts that I would go there just for that.  I must say the food is delicious here but going with a group be prepared to empty your bank. Prices are are ridiculous and drinks way too expensive. That's why I gave only 3 stars. Plus they don't put enough food on the plate. They leave you wanting more. We also made a reservation and still had to wait with a beeper for 30 mins. Place is always crowded and extremely loud.

The waiters all look like models (super fashionable attire there) which may be why I'm intimidated and expect the service to be snarky/awful but they consistently surprise me with how good they are.

Drinks were amazing, and the music kept us in a lively and good mood. The ambiance is sexy, mysterious and intriguing. Our server, Stacey was a sweetheart and patient as we were indecisive about one or two things. We were a little loud as we shared laughs with a nearby table, but no one complained. Customer service was excellent.  After eating we headed upstairs to the lounge and danced. We shared a few small plates which I believe were well priced and they were good - not as good as our drinks but good.

When we arrived, our New Yorker friends laughed at our reactions to the pawn store facade which through us off a bit (in a good way). Thanks to some strategic reservations, we were seated right away in a comfortable corner booth. Our waitress made some great wine recommendations, and we were impressed with the two bottles from the Willamette Valley region that we tried. Overall, we enjoyed every small plate we ordered (of which, there were many). Our favorites included the duck pizzetta, the chicken tamales, the empanadas, scallops, and the tomato soup dumplings. All the flavors were quite distinct, but went together incredibly well. One of the best parts of this restaurant is that they will add more pieces to the plates for a small upcharge to ensure that everyone at the table can try at least one, something more tapas-styles places should incorporate. Dessert might have surpassed the actual meal - a difficult feat considering how amazing that food was. We tried a s'mores tart and buttercream dish that we never wanted to end.

Since I was more interested in hitting up the Meatpacking district at night, so I had to settle on brunch here. Someone mentioned that this is a ""local's place,"" but I find that hard to believe when there are so many reviews of the place on Yelp and tourists flock to that... But anyway! We ordered lobster tacos (delish!), grilled cheese dumplings and tomato soup (my favorite and so creative!), lobster and chorizo hash (barely any lobster, pass!), tomato tartare (very tomato-y, what do you expect!), and eggs benedict (which my friend was the best eggs benedict she ever had). Overall love the place! And the ladies' restroom is so cute, with a little lounge and couches and bar area down there. We didn't order any drinks because we were kind of hungover from the night before, but sat at the bar and watched the bartender make beautiful drinks. I'll be returning here during my next trip to NYC!Oh BTW if you sit at the bar... oh just have a good view of the front door, it's a great place to see tons of beautiful and stylish people.

1.0,4/19/2014,"Never ever go to brunch here.  This is the letter I wrote to Beauty and Essex.  Their response was as sorely lacking as the service.I have eaten at Beauty and Essex many times.  It is my favorite restaurant.  I have never had anything I did not enjoy here. I had seen a brunch advertised on Gilt and bought it for a friend and I.  We had intended to have a party of 2.   When we found out her daughter and her boyfriend were in the area we asked them to join us.  They were held up on a train and arrived late.  We were told we could not add items to the meal but had to purchase another voucher.  This was agreeable to us. When we went to order we were told that although we had 2 vouchers, there were not 4 choices for each voucher.  The whole table had to share the same 4 items.  Honestly, this does not seem fair.  if we are purchasing 2 separate vouchers, we should have to separate selections.  Although I was not pleased I would have never given it a second thought if that was the only issue. We had placed our order and the first course was placed on the table.  The plate held 4 Red velvet waffles.  As our 2 guests were not there yet, we waited for them.  Minutes later someone came back, took the food OFF our table and put it on another table.  We objected and were given a plate with 3 waffles.  When we questioned this we were told parties of 2 get 3 waffles, parties of 4 get 4 waffles.  There are so many things that bothered me about this that I am going to list them in no particular order: If you make a mistake an give me food for another table and you walk away, please don't take it off the table.  If you do I will assume that you could have left my food at another table then gone back for it and served it to me. I watched you take the food off of my table and give it to someone else.  To me that is similar to eating off a stranger's plate.  It was revolting.  I watched every plate come up the stairs after that to make sure my plate did not have a stopover on someone else's table. People should get what they paid for.  If I purchased 2 vouchers that each have 4 options, I should have 8 options.  If 2 people get 3 waffles, 4 people should get 6. If a customer is upset by something, stop and think do I REALLY have to do this?  If the answer is no, then DON'T DO IT.  If something has to be done, the words ""I am sorry"" should be uttered and an attempt to make the customer feel better should be made. I love Beauty and Essex for dinner.  The food is amazing .  I recommend it everyone, however the brunch was a disappointment.  This meal was not up to what I have come to expect from Beauty and Essex.",2,0,0,Barbara H.,"Farmingdale, NY",2,2,0

3.0,4/15/2014,I would have given the place 4 stars but they are really bad at honoring reservations and its just too noisy and crowded in the bar to be kept waiting 45 minutes. Then we didn't even get a table in the main dining room which is so much nicer than the area next to the bar. Then they had run out of our favorite dish.  They suggested too many dishes and we had ordered way too much food. Best things on the menu were the tomato soup dumplings and the bbq ribs (and that was a nice portion). Ricotta cheese on toast was just meh. And the worst thing on the menu is the RISOTTO  DO NOT GET THAT. We were hosting a friend from Europe and I was sorry we had picked this place.

2.0,4/7/2014,"The food is EXCELLENT. We got the ribs, brick pressed chicken, and the lobster mac and cheese. The menu is tapas style, so we shared everything. The chicken was very flavorful, and the same with the ribs. I am an expert on mac and cheese, and the chef definitely got it right! There were two things that annoyed me about this place though. First, when I make reservations prior to arriving, I do not want to wait more than 5 minutes...10 TOPS to get seated. This is my third time coming here, and it's been the same 20-25 minute wait each time and that is unacceptable to me - even though I'll go down to the bathroom and get a sip of champagne, it really doesn't pass the time because it really is only a SIP (but it's free so I don't expect anymore than that). And this is when everybody in the party is present at that.Another thing that annoys me is when myself and my date spend $150 in the establishment on drinks and food and order a birthday shot for the birthday boy and are told if we want to continue drinking we could go to the bar because they had this table reserved for someone else. I get if all we were doing was drinking at the table, but we ordered food as well, and just wanted a final shot! I guess because the bill was already on the table it was too much to ask for at the point. Go figure.  For this reason I will not come back to this establishment because I do not care what table is reserved, I never expect to have a time limit on the table I'm seated at...especially when we spend a considerable amount of money in there for two people. We did not want to go to the bar because it was super crowded and we're not fighting our way through a crowd to get a shot so we left and went elsewhere.Beauty and Essex is a very popular place so their attitude about this review would probably be whatever because I'm sure they wouldn't hurt that badly without our little $150 bill. That is the attitude of most places in NY unfortunately....so if you want great food, a time limit on your table, and to wait a little bit for it then this is your place, its just not for me anymore.

4.0,4/5/2014,"Food (4/5)   Decor (4/5)   Service (3/5)   Value (4/5)Beauty & Essex was recommended to me as a good place for brunch and I was still very pleasantly surprised by my experience. For one, the decor is very unique. When you first walk in, you actually find yourself in a pawn shop, but once you walk through it, you find the restaurant in the back. The ambiance is a bit dark and reminded me a bit of a night club/bar which is a little odd for brunch, but I suppose we can call that ""character."" The dishes are served in a tapas style and you're expected to order things to share for the table. The Warm Lemon Blueberry Scones and the Fried Chicken Biscuit Bites were probably my two favorite things that we ordered. The scones were really soft/gooey and just fell apart as I ate them, which is quite different from what I normally expect in a scone (tough, hard, and tasteless). The fried chicken in the Fried Chicken Biscuit wasn't too greasy and was sandwiched in a fresh, warm biscuit. Everything else we had was really good (Brunch Pizzetta, Pressed Cuban, Burger, and Empanadas) as well, but those were the two things that stood out a little more. The waitress told us to order around 6 items for 4 people, and we felt that this may have been a little too much. 5 items would probably have been enough, though 6 may have been better if we'd ordered more of the lighter, breakfast fare rather than almost all lunch foods. Service was pretty normal. They are pretty attentive about clearing your plates and giving you new ones as different entrees come to the table. I was a little disappointed by the terse response I received when I called in to inform that I was running a little late due to traffic. (the only hold your reservation for 15 min)All in, it was a great experience and will look forward to returning in the future.",2,0,0,Taylor Y.,"New York, NY",30,50,0

I guess she never found a moment to ask anybody cuz I never got an answer.The Food:--Vanilla Beignets raspberry jam (These were mini fried donuts, dusted in sugar and filled with jam; they were decent but not worth the price; I would not normally pay $8 for donut holes that have a crispy San Gennaro festival funnel cake consistency)--Red Velvet Waffles cream cheese icing (These were very good, but very chocolaty; they needed more cream cheese icing to offset the richness of the chocolate cake consistency of the waffle. When I asked for more icing to do just that, I was told the kitchen did not have anymore.)--Eggs Benedict jamon serrano, hollandaise (It was Eggs Benedict on top of cut-up English Muffins; they were not the business)--Salt & Vinegar Fries (They were good)",1,0,0,AJ S.,"Riverdale, Bronx, NY",6,110,50

We were seated promptly but told that because they are so crowded the usual allowed 2 hours to dine would be cut. They emphasize a sharing style of eating for there restaurant but most of my party likes to take home leftover so some shared while others ordered individually. I had the BBQ ribs and lobster tacos which were both absolutely delicious! My ruby mojito was also great and I absolutely had no complaints!

There's a reason why Denzel Washington is a regular here :) ** Note: this review is for drinks and also the Gilt City brunch ** Firstly, B&E is a great spot if you're looking for ""a night on the town"" w/ a group of dolled up folks (girls: you can wear your fancy Vegas dress out & not feel overdressed!). Saturday nights: cocktails, shots, dancing the night away, bottle service, douchy people & good times. The chandelier looming over the windy staircase is divine. Cocktails aren't cheap but then again, who wants to give off the wrong impression, right? :) Coat check available which is nice, but I do feel awful for whoever's on shift as they have to go up & down the stairs for each coat... Tip nicely! ** FREE CHAMPAGNE IN THE LADIES RESTROOM ** (yes, it's true) just be sure to tip nicely!!!For Fri & Saturday nights, get.here.early. They do take some bar and bar table reservations, but if you don't have one, get here by 8 to avoid massive crowds. BRUNCH REVIEW: It's a fancy spot for day time dining, think - Sex & The City meets Gossip Girl. My friend & I ordered the Gilt City brunch offer last month: $70 for a 5 course meal to share (3 savory dishes, 1 side dish + 1 sweet course) & a bottle of Chandon brut sparkling wine. Awesome deal since you get a full bottle of wine & you have a selection to choose from each category. Dishes we chose from the menu: - Lemon blueberry pancakes w/ sweet ricotta - Grilled cheese & tomatoe soup dumplings- Braised short rib Huevos rancheros- Skillet roasted potatoes side dish - Cupcakes for dessertThe food was really delicious. With the Gilt offer, this was a fantastic meal. I wouldn't come here for brunch though without a deal; each dish is overpriced and not hugely portioned to justify the cost. The Huevos rancheros & the pancakes were amazing.Also, we felt very rushed at brunch. Stephani was our server, and while she gave us a few minutes to look over the menu before we decided which courses to order, she was a bit abrupt and we felt like she wrote us off bc we had a Gilt City discount. Looking around though, it appeared that almost everyone at the restaurant that day was there b/c of GC! While they do have a tasty brunch menu, I wouldn't necessarily come here again for brunch. I like a more low key, southern comfort kind of feeling when I brunch; no need for shiny forks & chandeliers.

I made reservations I'd say a month in advance. *I like to plan ahead.* All for nothing because little did I know I'd be taking much longer to get ready on my birthday. My girls and I were running late. Nervous our reservations would be cancelled, we called and they let us know it was cool as long as we arrived within a certain time frame. No problem! Our cabbie put the pedal to the medal and we arrived STAT.  When you walk up to B&E it's business in the front (pawn shop right before you walk into the restaurant) and party in the back!We were seated immediately. The kitchen was closing soon and our waitress made that very clear (with lots of attitude) but her sass was disregarded. I was not moved by anything on the menu so it took me awhile to decide BUT I certainly would not be rushed or feel pressure to order just anything.We got our orders in. Waited. Took photos. Danced in our seats. Swooned as we watched Victor Cruz pass our table. And took in ALL of B&E's beauty.The food was pretty good. The gals and I were pleased and thought everything was priced reasonably. Of course, a surprise b-day dessert came my way. DELISH chocolate mini cakes with vanilla ice-cream scoops on the side!After dinner and dessert we headed upstairs. The DJ was playing ALL of my hits. I'm talking hip-hop from the 90's and 2000's. Think Big Tymers, Juvenile, & Cam'ron. I was in HEAVEN reciting every last word to Birdman's ""What Happened To That Boy"" in a peplum dress and 6 inch heels. What?! The crowd was mixed. Mature and younger men & women. Some creeps, *it never fails.* You had the wannabe ""ballers"", the women plotting whose table they were going to raid for free bottles/drinks, the chill folks, and the 'I'm here to be seen' party goers. For the most part though, everyone was enjoying themselves just having a good time.We started to wind down and headed to the restroom. Another surprise! It looks like it's own chic lounge. Literally, you can have your a lil' shindig down there.Overall, I recommend this place to anyone thinking of having a birthday party. My issue every bday is picking two locations: a restaurant and a lounge to gather a small group, get a table, and get my dance on at. B&E eliminated ALL of that. You can eat downstairs and go upstairs after you've devoured your food. Get a table and dance the night away with your homies. I guarantee an amazing night!",2,0,0,Dira C.,"New York, NY",1,91,53

My friend however, was extremely tired and jetlagged from a flight in from London and was dozing off a little while we were waiting - Hostess sent a bouncer to threaten to kick us out as a result. I explained the situation and said that I completely understand that it didn't look good but he was extremely tired as it was 2AM in London time and there was no space in the bar to sit. Bouncer was rude and did not care for the situation - I understand if we were at a club and my friend was drunk and passing out but we were just at a restaurant and he was merely tired. Right after the threats and lecture, the hostess came to seat us. The service at the table was amazing - our server was excellent. When we asked for the bill, I asked to speak with the manager to explain what happened when we were waiting for the table. She was in a rush to leave and basically brushed me off - she said and I quote ""I am very busy, and I am just going to walk away right now"", and she did just that. I managed to get a hold of the manager to was starting her shift after the first, and she brushed me off too - she said and I quote ""Well she (the first manager) already left, so what's done is done"". She proceeded to GRAB my credit card of our my hand - I guess she was afraid we were going to eat-and-run?Right after I signed the check, she told us that she needed the table back immediately and that we had to leave that instant and that if we didn't security would escort us out. I told her that I needed to use the bathroom first and she was not very happy that I wanted to use the bathroom right next to our table in the restaurant and not walk back out and go downstairs to use the one that apparently had 'no lines' - I guess they were REALLY overbooked?

Beauty + Essex really blew me away, and I have to give this place props in my review.I came here yesterday on the deal from Gilt City with my wife, as she got it for us for my Valentine's Day gift. You roll up to the place, and I said to myself ""There's no WAY this place is legit."" It looks really abandoned and shady from the outside, in a bit of an odd area. But once you walk in, that ALL changes pretty quick...You enter into a small pawn shop. Pretty odd, but interesting. They have a lot of jewelry and antique stuff for sale, and it isn't huge. It's kind of a pass-through to the main entrance of Beauty and Essex, and it worked. As you enter, you see how huge and well-done this spot is. The decor and ambiance are both spot-on: dark, lit by scones on the wall and candles on a smaller tables to sit at. We were seated immediately, and as we walked by, you see this awesome, swanky bar on the left. Looks really vintage and has an awesome waiting area next to with a huge, leather sofa.+The staff: For such a huge place, pretty attentive and responsive. Got to us our champagne and orders quickly.+The Food:*Lemon and Blackberry Pancakes: absolutely fantastic. Tasty with a topping a sweet ricotta cheese that's OUT of this world. *Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon, and Tomato Soup Dumplings: probably our favorite offering for the meal. These were absolutely fantastic, and even though they were the smallest offering of our meal, they were done perfectly. Found its way to my ""top ten things I've tasted"" list. *Huevos Rancheros: also an unreal offering in a breakfast-style item. The eggs were done perfectly, the beans were nice and hot, and all served perfectly and stylistically. *Lobster + Chorizo Hash: the hits kept on coming with this plate. A small bowl of Peruvian potatoes a la hash browns in squares mixed with lobster, butter and cilantro. Another solid offering.+Dessert: we opted for the B+E cupcakes. Four, small little cupcakes: 2 of Guinness with bailey's frosting, 2 of Red Velvet. They were both nice and tiny, so they didn't overfill you after a meal that hit the spot. The Guinness cupcakes were something I'd never had before, and by golly they were delicious. The entire meal was done perfectly, and I honestly have no complaints at ALL.

Apps..we had the Beats and Butternut Squash Salad, Chicken Tamales, Lobster Mac and Onion Rings.  The salad was the best thing I ever had, so amazing, full of flavor and it was so interestingly put together.  A MUST HAVE.  Dinner, we had the Chicken Meatballs, the Spaghettini (pesto with zuchnini pasta with a sunny side up egg, sounds weird but it was just amazing!...also a little spicy it was great to have the egg to have an offset), had the Chicken and Polenta and the Seared Tuna.  The Meatballs are just so great because it was soaked in truffle, so you cannot beat it....but if I went back I would have the Spaghettini again! You should try this.  Desert we pigged out and had the Chocolate Cake, the Butterscotch Creme, the Chocolate Bread Pudding....it was all so amazing! So fattening! lol Drinks:  Great menu.  Ordered two bottles of champagne.  OF WHICH the waitress opened and accidentally spilled some.  She walked away saying she would get a new bottle since we lost some from that bottle.  When she came back, she didn't open the bottle at the table and we noticed that the second bottle didn't last as long the first.  I think we did not get a full bottle but yet were charged for it.  I am not happy about this, but because it was my birthday we didn't say anything.  Otherwise I would have.  Price...dinner was like $300 for four of us...not terrible at all.   Overall great, not head over heels but a great experience with good food.",2,0,0,R L.,"New York, NY",153,462,19

They really don't treat you as well as they should (especially considering how expensive their food is for items you can find anywhere with comparable taste). The crowd/staff can be really stuck-up. The managers and servers just don't use their common sense at this place. You don't tell people they can use the lounge area , and then attempt to kick them out one hour later saying it is ""reserved""  when they are ringing up a tab of $400 ordering drinks and food. Thus, it was pretty much a buzz kill one hour in, and instead (after much debate) they made us move to another ""non reserved"" lounge area.

When we arrived we were escorted upstairs and at first I was nervous to be out of the main dining area but honestly, I glad we ended up there. Main dining area is VERY dark although trendy. Upstairs was perfect. Still had a very cool vibe but didn't need flashlights to eat! The décor of the place is really really cool and quite unique but its the food and service that leave the biggest mark. Best to come with a group four, trust your waitress and get ready for some delicious food. It is also fun playing amateur food critic as you discuss and debate each plate you share because they space them out perfectly. The wait staff is RIGHT THERE making sure you have clean plates and forks. and empty plates are removed immediately. Drinks are very good but can get a little weird. But after some tasting and swapping, we always found one of us who loved something from each round. Again, trust your waitress and tell her your likes / dislikes.They had a squid ink pasta with lobster special that we all fought over. The spicy pasta Bolognese was delicious. Roasted bone marrow and tuna poke tacos were a favorite too. Save room for dessert and go for the donut box.

The deal was for Saturday brunch that included four shared plates, one dessert, and a bottle of champagne for two. All in all a great experience, they didn't follow the ""dress code"" that was written on the website, maybe because it was for brunch. The staff and waiters were attentive and my glasses were never empty. So onto the food...Red velvet waffles. Not too sweet, super moist, and drizzled with cream cheese frosting. Definitely not as heavy as it sounds. We were both fending for more cream cheese frosting!Grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings. My boyfriend said it was dangerous because it comes in a bite size piece in a spoon. We downed it within 5 minutes. Good flavor and with crunchy bacon bits.Chilequiles. I seem to can't go without ordering chilequiles when I see it on the menu. Although not the best I've ever had, it's pretty darn good. Chicken was moist and good tang from the lime juice. A good portion to share and probably too big to finish solo.Side of lobster chorizo hash. Flavor is there just wish I could see my chorizo and lobster. It was finely chopped bits so I had to scoop it with my fork.Dessert was mini cupcakes. I didn't care for those so I also ordered the warm chocolate mini croissants.

The food was unique and fantastic as well as the cocktails (no complaints) EXCEPT for our dessert.  We order the apple pie with ice cream dessert and the apple pie was COLD and hard.  We only took a few bites and gave up on it.  We told our waitress about the cold apple pie and her response was ""it's suppose to be that way so that it won't melt the ice cream"".... are you shitting me??? I'm sure the whole purpose of any warm pie over ice cream is the hot and cold contrast.  I had better pie experience at DENNY'S.  For an expensive dessert, we only enjoy the small 1-scoop ice cream that came with the apple pie.  Our waitress didn't even try to make us happy.  Her reasoning was the biggest TURN-OFF for this place.The coffee we ordered to go with dessert was served very unprofessional.  A different girl came out with a tray filled with coffee cups for other guests as well as ours.  The tray was too heavy so she placed it down and grabbed our two coffee cup by the lip area (which grossed us out) and served it to us.  The whole delivery was unprofessional.I would recommend trying their fig pizza!  Delicious!  TIP FOR THE RESTAURANT:Waitress to slow down... our waitress seemed to be in a rush all the time.  For the amount of money you charge for your food/service, great service is expected.Coffee person to bring out coffees per table vs try to carry a whole tray with other coffees for others she can't carry.Apple pie should be served warm/hot.  No excuses!  If manager heard her response, they would NOT be happy.",0,0,0,Lynn C.,"Lynnwood, WA",4,39,8

Visually, this place is stunning inside, high ceilings, big chandelier, pawn shop items on the walls, very speakeasy-ish. The whole pawn shop entrance is extremely clever and somehow makes this place even more glamorous. I would recommend that you honor their dress code, as it makes the whole experience a little more fun and fancy. Waiting for our table we grabbed seats at the bar and ordered some very well made drinks. Coat check was complimentary. I ordered a bottle of champagne ahead of time for the table to surprise my friends and the Beauty & Essex staff handled it wonderfully. They let me fill out a form ahead of time so it would be charged to me rather than the table and brought it, already chilled, as soon as we sat down. This is technically a ""tapas"" restaurant but the portions are very large for tapas. We were four people, and we ordered about 8 or 9 plates. I didn't eat all of them (because I don't eat seafood) but everything I had was delicious, I had not one complaint about the entire dinner. And I'm a complainer so that is saying something! We ordered: Spaghettini, Scallops (I was told these were good but they sort of had a taste of hot dogs, so that's weird), Chicken Meatballs (I was shocked at how delicious these were because I feel weird about chicken in meatball form; they were awesome), some kind of green beans, broccolini (it was in a soy sauce, delicious), a brick pressed chicken dish which was laid on a bed of amazing polenta, Vidalia onion tempura (light and crispy) and the baby back ribs - I only tasted these but they fell right off the bone, and they also came with the onion rings. We were all comfortably full with this amount of food, I believe we may have even left some of the chicken so as to not be stuffed further. For dessert we ordered the pistachio baklava and the Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Crème. I thought the baklava was amazing, I thought the waiter hyped the butterscotch thing a bit but I'm also not a huge fan of butterscotch. We did not finish all the desserts because we were pretty full. We were there on a Saturday night and it did get quite busy for the waiter was a little slow toward the end. But we didn't mind as we were enjoying ourselves and the atmosphere. I really do recommend Beauty & Essex for a bit of a fancy, stylish evening. It seemed like downstairs people were just there to drink as well, which I didn't realize was an option. Also, funny enough, they give you complimentary pink champagne in the women's bathroom apparently to make up for women having to wait in line for the bathroom. There are also seats in there to hang out, making it a very posh bathroom. I heard the men's bathroom didn't have anything fancy. Enjoy!",2,0,0,Samantha M.,"Brooklyn, NY",119,32,9

I thought she was going to cry after our first shot.  So being the kind loving friend I am (muahahaha) I said let's go.We got to the door.  I told her to take a look.  She had a I don't likey look on her face.  Then BOOM! they opened the huge door and her jaw dropped!  I was good! This is a sexy place. Everybody and everything was looking good.The food was delicious! The kale and apple salad was tasty!  Everything we ordered that night was great!

LOLThey had music, which was quite loud and didn't match the mood of the place.  But who am I to say what music matches or not. :-PThe ladies ended up going to the restroom and not returning for a while.  We all got caught in the lovely little bar they had for us down there.  I loved the wall of perfumes they had dividing the sinks.  And for some reason unknown-est to humans, there's always a line for the bathroom stalls so don't not expect them and get your panties in a bunch. FYI, must bring ID cards if you intend to have a sip of champagne down there. Someone told me it was family style but it wasn't.  It's more like how many people are eating this dish and they'll put the same amount of servings on it.  So you're basically paying for your own plate on a bigger plate with other peoples food on it also....?Comprende?

Additionally, it was tough to get a drink!  We had to flag out waitress down to get a cocktail and had she been on point, we would have probably drank much more.  I found the drinks overly sweet and like the rest of the night, very forgettable.",0,0,0,Sam C.,"New York, NY",0,7,0
5.0,12/30/2013,"Came here with a bunch of friends and I think I may have quite possibly found my new favorite restaurant!! Aside from the cute pawn shop with a secret door entrance kinda thing-- the restaurant in itself, service, food, drinks, and lounge made our night.Our server was more than helpful and very knowledgeable of the menu as well as the gazillion questions we had about cocktails. She was even nice enough to allow us to switch a drink at no charge if we didn't like the taste of our first choice. She was extremely attentive to our table and kept on checking in to make sure that we were okay. Shall I keep going??Yes... onto the food!Our server explained that although a few dishes came with just a few items per plate, that she'd be able to do add-on's to accommodate everyone. We started out with the Pearl of the Sea (a 2 tier) raw seafood bar, which consisted of lobster tails, shrimp cocktail, oysters and clams. It was the perfect dish to get our appetites in full gear. We then moved onto the Thai crab cakes (to die for) and the salt and vinegar fries. Moving right along, we tried out the bone marrow which came with soft, little slices of bread and a fig like spread to go with it. This was a pretty unique dish but should NOT be overlooked-- it was one of the table's favorite. Next, we got the Braised Chicken meatballs which was also pretty good but after having such flavorful dishes, this was a bit on the blander side. Last but most certainly not least, we got the lobster tacos and the pan roasted scallops--holy mother of God! Why thank you Beauty and Essex, this made my night.The Lobster tacos are absolutely amazing, filled with fresh lobster meat. The scallops were perfectly seared with a slight hint of a smokey taste and a good pairing of rissoto to go with it.Suffice to say, that my friends and I were more than satisfied after our dinner and can't wait to return!",0,0,0,Veik S.,"New York, NY",2,175,22

The 1920's speakeasy vibe permeates, and I got the feeling of a old timey dinner club when I walked through the restaurant. We went for a friend's birthday, none of us had been before but it looked like an interesting place. I didn't have any of the food, we went to the lounge area upstairs. Drinks were OK, ambiance was nice but nothing special, which really leads to my main point about Beauty and Essex: its not anything spectacular, especially for their prices. If you want to be be upscale with your pricing you need to deliver on service and they did not. Their coat check even lost my friend's stuff, so be forewarned. There is no shortage of places with unique decor and ambiance in the LES, and while I liked Beauty and Essex the price was just too much for what they delivered.

4.0,12/26/2013,"Beauty and Essex is a New York dining experience. Enter through an old school pawn shop into a gorgeous space with a skylights and chandeliers, with a modern sleek interior.  Beauty and Essex is sexy New York, and incredibly trendy with even the ladies room serving complimentary champagne. Beauty and Essex, like it's sister restaurant -- The Stanton Social, specializes in creative American small plates with ethnic fusions. The flavors are bold, and anything you get here will be great. Their drink menu is impressive and delightful. My favorite was their Emerald Gimlet made with Grey Goose, basil, lemon nectar, and fresh lime -- perfect infusion of basil in a cocktail. We ordered 8 plates, shared among 5 people. The Chicken Meatballs were the most memorable, served with sheep's milk ricotta, wild mushroom and truffle. The oven braised meatballs, are cooked to tender meatball perfection. The ricotta adds a creamy, rich dimension of flavor and the mushrooms and truffles take things to the next level. The Grilled Cheese Dumplings are Beauty and Essex's signature dish. This plate comes with 6 spoons filled with creamy tomato soup and a grilled cheese dumpling with smoked bacon. I'll let you be the judge if these, or the French Onion Soup Dumplings at The Stanton Social are better. I loved the Tuna Tacos served with micro cilantro, radish, and wasabi kewpie. The tuna was fresh, the wasabi sauce was deliciously spicy, tucked into a petite wonton taco shell. The Whipped Ricotta on crostini was another highlight, served with grilled peaches, chilis, basil, and honey. Fresh and light, the combination of grilled peaches and ricotta is genius and even more so when served on crispy bread enhanced with the spicy flavors of chili, the sweetness of honey, and freshness of basil. We stepped outside of our comfort zone and experimented with the Roasted Bone Marrow served with a rioja braised shallot marmalade, sea salt, micro arugula and crostini. This dish was the talk of the night as half our table was repulsed by what was before them. I enjoyed it and I was especially impressed by how artfully plated bones could actually be...Other menu items we tried and loved: Grilled Asparagus with lemon and truffle vinaigrette, Lobster Mac & Cheese with sicilian style bread crumbs, The Stanton Social's Chipotle Grilled Shrimp with tomatillo and feta relish and the Beer Battered Lobster Tacos with red cabbage slaw and poblano crema. And be sure to leave room for dessert. We got the Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot De Creme with coconut chantilly, Molten Chocolate Bread Pudding with hazelnut ice cream and the Box Of Doughnuts with vanilla beignets stuffed with chocolate hazelnut creme and raspberry jam. The Box of Doughnuts are awesome. It was a memorable night at Beauty and Essex and I can't wait to dine again.

Brick Pressed ChickenThe chicken was very tender and moist.  The tomatoes were zesty and paired great with the chicken.  It was a good dish, but nothing to write home about.Deep Dish Apple PieThe crust of the pie was harder than I wanted it to be, with not enough sauce to cater to all of that crust.  The caramel cinnamon ice cream was the real treat on this plate.  It's just too bad that there was only a small scoop of ice cream, which wasn't enough for the size of the pie that accompanied it.After dinner, we headed upstairs to check out the lounge.  It's a great place to go if you want good music.  It's not the best place to go to have a nice dinner with friends due to how loud it is in here.",5,0,2,Lily M.,"Dallas, TX",621,875,1389

The food is pretty decent, and they have some very tasty drinks. The only thing is that they are $14, which is normal, but they are not boozy. I had 4 cocktails before, and didn't even have a buzz. The last time I went there I bought 2 $14 drinks from the bar, and the total came to $30 even. Then my friend and I snagged 2 seats in the lounge area, and ordered another 2 drinks. Except his time it came to $30.40... Forty cents is no big deal, it is just weird how the price is different literally 7 feet from the bar.Now the place attracts a diverse group of people, but there are heaps of douche bags. My friend and I were sitting in the lounge in front of a little table, and some guy who was old enough to be my dad just starts moving his hands,  telling me to move over. I look at him and ask him where he wants to go, because if my friend moves anymore he will be on top of the other group of people sitting down. He tells me that he has been sitting for an hour, and that I need to move. Well unfortunately for him, his table kept adding more and more people, he lost his spot, and I wasn't moving. So this douche bag knocks my cocktail out of my hand all over the floor. A staff member sees this whole thing transpire, and just walks away. At that point, my friend just finished his drink and we left.So unless you are going to have brunch or dinner, making sure you don't get stuck in the row of tables that are an inch apart, stay far away. There are a lot of other fun places nearby to get your drink on without all the douche bags.",0,0,0,Mark L.,"Washington, DC",235,44,6

I said I had a rez.  When I repeated that and questioned what happened... he immediately realized his mistake.  Another 25 minutes later or so, we finally sat.  No real apology from him... a bit pretentious.  Where is my adorable Kyle?  He's got a much better bedside manner.  Time to send Paul Bunyon to coat check, friends.  I understand you're busy and all... but I took the time to make a rez... so please take the time to apologize for your oversight.  Thanks, Proud Member of the Human Race.Anyway, the adorable waitress that let us sit in her bar section while we waited for our table was super sweet.  Kind and considerate.  Definite asset to your team, B&E.As for the food, loved the complimentary eggplant caponata amuse bouche.  The jewels on toast were delish... got the ricotta one & NY pretzel.  Tomato soup dumplings and fried oysters were amazing.  Also had the pumpkin risotto and the lobster mac-n-cheese.  Finished up with molten chocolate bread pudding.  All in all... a perfectly-coursed and delicious meal!!!",2,2,1,Barbara D.,"Denver, CO",462,395,9
3.0,12/1/2013,"I've bookmarked B&E for a while and could never really pull the trigger given that the menu never really jumps out at you. Is it a tapas place? Is the food American, Italian, Asian, French? If you read Yelp reviews prior to visiting a place the buzz words for B&E are free champagne in the women's bathroom, beautifully decorated, loud, young...it is rarely about the food but more about the buzz.So here's the scoop, since I am a dude, I am all about the food, and for that B&E gets a flat 3 stars. Flat mainly because the food was somewhat flat and perhaps a touch under seasoned? I am probably spoiled by great food from other places at similar NYC prices (Buddakan, DBGB are tops on my list of great tasting food and focused on the food region). I just think the menu is a bit of a mixed bag on hitting all regions and don't necessarily tie in together. The highlights of the night were the lamb chops perfectly cooked medium rare with a good port wine sauce, excellent when paired with the broccolini and a glass of cabernet (excellent wine). Had the Tuna poké wonton tacos and lobster mac for apps - these were ok. Seared Tuna was also just ok...not wow. Chicken meatballs was soft and tender but again it was missing one thing - some sweetness from onions perhaps...I may be getting too technical. It's like you have to find the perfect pair of tapas to go well with your entree and it's a bit of a stretch to figure out yourself.For dessert I had an above average molten chocolate bread pudding with ice cream and a perfect macchiatto, not a bad ending for a dinner at around $100 per person plus tip. Service was actually quite excellent and attentive, but we dine early to avoid the 7 PM dinner mayhem.B&E is an ""ok"" place for food but a great place to hang for drinks, check out pretty people, pre-game, check out pretty people...where girls can have free champagne in the women's bathroom apparently (also saw lattes heading towards the women's bathroom?)

But that's where all the good things end.Two of my friends got the Essex burger and asked for it cooked medium-well, and they arrived medium-rare. We sent both burgers back, and even upon returning twenty minutes later with fresh burgers, one was still medium-rare while the other was medium. Moreover, the burgers were average, not particularly flavourful. But the accompanying fries were extraordinaire! The service was atrocious. Our server was pre-occupied/not paying attention and kept hurrying us into ordering despite the fact that it was noon (two days after Thanksgiving) and the place was fairly empty. He was also flippant when we informed him that the burgers were still undercooked the second time (despite the fact that we weren't sending the second round back, because everyone was starving). The woman at the coatcheck disappeared for an extended period of time, and left us waiting - ticket in hand - for our coats.Overall, I would really think twice before coming here a second time because the service was really lacking.",7,4,4,Aditi T.,"Upper Arlington, OH",183,48,20
3.0,11/29/2013,"Go-to spot for finance guys since it's an all-in-one type of spot. You can do drinks / dinner / after dinner lounge all under one roof. So great spot to go if you are entertaining clients. The food is good but the portions are small so it's hard to gauge how much is a good amount for the table. They will definitely make you over-order if you're in a larger group. Although one occasion we did have to order another round of our entire meal since it wasn't enough for the neanderthal brokers at the table. That said, it's a beautiful space with a great bar upstairs and downstairs. You can reserve an area in the lounge for after dinner drinks. B&E does well because the space is so pretty, but wasn't overly wow'ed by the food by any means. Some stand outs of the menu include the rigatoni (tiny tiny portion), and the grilled cheese.",0,1,0,DineGirl K.,"Manhattan, NY",46,104,0

Each room is decorated differently with a specific theme, and there are private rooms if you want some privacy for a special event.  I've come here about 4 times and have never been disappointed with my food or drinks.  Once we started the night off for my bachelorette party and had dinner downstairs and then had drinks in the Pearl Room upstairs near the DJ.  The food is fab, you must love small plates - everything is really intended to share so that you can try a variety of menu items.  There is free champagne in the restroom for the ladies so make a trip down there.  I usually bring friends here when I have guests in from out of town and it never fails to impress from a New York City ambiance, and food quality point of view.  My favorite items are: Braised Chicken Tamales, Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings, The lobster tacos, Crab cakes, Grilled Shrimp, Salt and Vinegar fries, Scallops.  For dessert I've had and really enjoyed the Pumpkin Ice Box Cake, Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Crème, Chocolate Peanut Butter Semifreddo, Devil's Food Layer Cake.",1,0,0,Mary A.,"Fairfield, CT",3,23,4

4.0,11/25/2013,"The initial cool thing about this joint is that you have to walk through a pawn shop to get inside. The pawn shop is actually real where you can buy/sell but it's obvious that it's not a ""real pawn shop"" with stacks of random crap and a hard-looking store owner. Instead, it'll be some dudes in suits who make sure you're dressed appropriately before entering the restaurant. I had a business casual outfit on with a beanie and they politely asked me to remove the beanie. I like when places actually adhere to a dress code--definitely affects the mood.So my friend who works here invited me to come visit her when she was about to get off. I enjoyed a smoky cocktail at the bar and sulked in the fancy atmosphere. I didn't get to try any of the food. I did some exploring upstairs and downstairs--this place is classy. Up the spiraling staircase is another bar and a room with a DJ. It's no wonder why many celebrities come here (Drake, Drew Carey, etc.).I highly recommend this joint for a date or special occasion.

It didn't appear to be the nicest area in town, but that all changes when you walk through the door. You enter through a pawn shop and head through the rear door that opens into a huge restaurant with a spiral staircase  ascending up through fur-covered walls and around a large chandelier. The plates are all small portions made for sharing, and each one was absolutely delicious! We tried the NY Pretzels (which weren't really pretzels, but rather small slices of bread topped with mustard and roast beef), chicken meatballs (wow...totally amazing! They were topped with a truffle sauce and whipped ricotta--so rich, you really only want one), fig pizza (good sweet and salty mixture, but the flavor is so rich, you really can't eat a lot), eggplant pizza (this was my favorite--it's a thin crust pizza topped with tomato sauce, a slice of fried eggplant and topped with whipped ricotta--like a bite of eggplant Parmesan!).  The plates are not cheap (chicken meatballs were $17 if I remember correctly, and you only get 3), but they are good. Dessert was incredible!! We had the black bottom cake, which was like a chocolate pudding topped with a decadent whipped cream and served with candy spoons made from thin butterscotch cookies). The decor is awesome! The walls are lined with framed necklaces from the pawn shop and chandeliers are everywhere. This is a great place to go if you want to get dressed up and go out, or for any special occasion. It is a rather loud place, but the music they played the night we were there was awesome!

2.0,11/12/2013,"I will start off by saying the food was really good. I went here for brunch and I got the beignets (so amazing!), eggs benedict (also amazing), pretzel (really good!!), lobster chorizo (good, but better on the West Coast), and fried chicken bites (really good!). My big objection is the service, the manager, and their unbelievably deceptive pricing. First, we had a reservation and we still waited 20 minutes, not the biggest deal because its Manhattan and you always wait, but still, that's what reservations are for. They also mixed up a couple of our plates and forgot some tea, again, not the biggest deal in the world, its a busy restaurant. It was my first visit to your restaurant and the waiter explained it was tapas style and it could be divided depending on the number of people. What he didn't mention (neither did the menu or anywhere else) is that certain dishes come in set numbers and that there is an added charge if you add more to the dish. While this policy makes sense (obviously it costs more to give me 4 of something than 3) he never said there would be an extra charge, so the surprise came when we got the bill.It was never made clear how many portions of each dish were included. For example, an order of beignets or tomato soup includes 6, the lobster and chorizo are served as one dish, but the pretzel and eggs benedict come as 3. We were a table of ten, but decided to order in two groups of 4 and one of two. As a group of 4 we were not informed of the difference in the portion listed on the menu, and therefore what would be included in the cost. The waiter asked if this would be for the four of us, and automatically added the extra, but did not reduce the number for dishes that came in sets of 6. If we are paying for 4 of everything, including an extra fee for adding, we should have been presented with the option of reducing our order for things that came in sets of six as well, but we had no idea the quantity included.To make matters worse, when I asked the manager about these charges he treated me with disdain and condescension, as if I was too stupid to understand the policy. As I said, I understand why there would be a price difference between 3 and 4 items, my objection is that it is purposefully not presented to your customer. The manager rolled his eyes at me several times and gave me ten% off, but patronizingly told me I didn't understand and this was how it was always done. I have never been treated so rudely by anyone in a service industry. We spent over $500 on brunch, including several drinks. I was not trying to be ""stingy,"" but instead express how misleading the menu and waiter's explanation was. The manager blew me off and then thought that giving me the 10% off would shut me up and make me leave.I will never come back. It is a shame, because the food was very good. There are a lot of good brunch places in Manhattan, and customers deserve to be treated with enough respect to know what they are paying for and to be taken seriously if they have a complaint.",0,0,0,Rachel B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,0

4.0,10/19/2013,"Overall, a great (although not perfect) experience in a beautiful restaurant.Jumping out of your cab and arriving at Beauty & Essex is an experience in itself. You arrive at what appears to be a pawn shop. Upon walking in you are led through a secret-not-so-secret door into the expansive and beautiful restaurant. The foyer is small but large enough for about 10 people to wait comfortably.We had 9:45 reservations, but we didn't get seated until almost 10:30. Annoying, but we were able to pass the time in the bar area. Heads up, you might not get seated right when your reservation is. Boo.The restaurant has a bunch of large tables that are good for groups. Which is good as we were celebrating my little sister's 30th Birthday, 6 of us sat comfortably.Since this place is a Tapas style sharing restaurant - we ordered 12 dishes for the 6 of us, and yes it was a ton of food. Almost too much.I can only remember a few of the things we ordered and I will jot them down below. These are the dishes I loved the most, so, if you'd like to follow my recommendations, choose the at least one of the following three dishes (with very limited commentary):*Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos -- They'll melt in your mouth. *Open Faced Tamales --  Yummy*Hand Cut Steak Tartare -- Just DelicousThe servers are also very well-versed so they can help you should you appear to be struggling.Desserts, awesome.Like I said, besides dealing with the seating thing, a pretty awesome experience.",3,1,0,Richard T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1006,546,290

While none of the dishes particularly stood out, the food was very good and I'd definitely return. We finished the meal with their homemade ice cream - 3 flavors and great consistency. However, we couldn't tell one flavor from the other and each employee we asked offered different answers. Not an ideal place to have a nice meal with mother;the decor was perfect, but it was very, very loud.

3.0,10/8/2013,"The place is gorgeous with enchanting décor, beautiful people and equally visually stunning food.  The way the restaurant works is interesting and mildly confusing. Food is meant to be family style, like tapas made for sharing. The server also recommended that each of us get a completely different starter and a different main (far too much food).  Each item was customized for the number of guests. So no duplicates and everyone tried everything. Pros:All of the drinks we tried were tasty and strong, from the pretty in pink Beauty Elixir to the savory green Emerald Gimlet.Hand Cut Prime Steak Tartare - Close to the most delicious things we ate all night. It was magical-- the dissonance of the cold temperature of the raw beef and the warm sticky rice cake created an amazing play and extreme layers, but the freshness and innovation was a twist on the usual tartare.Sashimi of Tuna- Another item off of the raw bar menu which was absolutely stunning. The fish was fresh and cool, topped with lemony olive oil and a crunchy stud of chorizo. The different textures along with the flavors really set the item off.Bone Marrow- This was a really fun, decadent and delicious interactive dish. It was gratifying to scrape the marrow out of the bone and smear it on the toast, but it was buttery, rich, and fatty. Even though it was do-it-yourself, it felt like a delicacy.Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon and Tomato Soup Dumpling- This full bite is every childhood dream all grown up and transformed into a spoonful of steaming memories. The shallow pool of tomato soup swam around a circle of hot grilled cheese, salty and savory just like the steamed bacon.Cons: Many of the entrees we tried, including the ribs (not remotely interesting or flavorful), the Garganelli pasta (too al dente and not at all memorable), the scallops (cooked well but super salty and something with them tasted like deli meat) were lackluster compared to their starter counterparts. Even the desserts we tried-- the petite cupcakes and the beer and pretzel sundae--were hardly worth mentioning, no matter how whimsical they were.",3,0,2,Randi E.,"Hoboken, NJ",388,155,456

Although we had an amazing time, we didn't get to fully enjoy our experience because we waned to order food, along with our bottles, but there was no place to hold our plates. They couldn't offer us another table or anything and due to the limited amount of room, one woman dropped her hot plate of ravioli on my friends foot and suede shoes. Staff wasn't as attentive as this went unnoticed for some time. But they did offer to replace it. However, the food was amazing! All except the Lobster Mac N Cheese. All we tasted was the bread crumbs and a whole lot of cheese in the pasta. BARELY any lobster pieces at all. And three of us had this dish and were all in agreement. This is definitely something they can improve on. The ravioli was amazing! The oysters were also fresh and delicious! And the lamp shops looked appetizing although I didn't actually have it myself.

4.0,10/6/2013,"It's stylish. It serves small plates. It has vegetarian friendly options. Beauty and Essex essentially checks all the boxes for a good place to celebrate with a group in New York City. Plus it's hidden and all that, so I suppose you could earn some points with your out-of-town friends for being a local with the inside knowledge. Except, er, a thousand people have reviewed it on Yelp already.I usually end up getting the pan con tomate and the whipped ricotta to start with, and they are both rather delicious. Among the main plates, I suggest you try the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings, which they can make vegetarian. And while the crispy eggplant pizzetta is tasty, it is rather reminiscent of some of the other items on their first course menu. The mushroom and ricotta ravioli does nicely to finish off the savoury courses.Moving on to their sweetmeats, Beauty and Essex does serve up some delicious bakes! The devil's food layer cake is good, but who on earth eats that much cake in one sitting? the black bottomed butterscotch pot de creme and the molten chocolate bread pudding are my favourites. They also have milkshake shots that I should totally try the next time I am there.The drinks at Beauty and Essex are above average for a restaurant, but there is certainly no mixology magic happening here. I'd stick to the wines if you're a cocktail snob. Finally the service is friendly and approachable, and apart from the one time they brought us non vegetarian food by error, it's been pretty efficient.Yep, I foresee several more visits here.",4,2,1,Madhuri I.,"New York, NY",289,272,0

At first sighting, this place looks like a pawn shop in the middle of a defined hipster/sketchy dangerous neighborhood.

Nicely decorated in what I felt was a roaring 20s scene, with business men in suits and pretty women in dresses mingling.We were seated immediately (got there around 7pm). Our waitress was quick with drink orders and helpful with menu selections. We got the oysters, bone marrow, apple & kale salad, pizzetta, and empanadas. Everything was very savory (almost at the brink of being too salty for me) but I would definately come back. They have a huge selection of tapas style dishes and I have a tiny appetite for one dining session. We ordered the butterscotch desert, one of those deserts you find yourself unable to stop trying.

So we picked a place that was cool and hip that none of us had been to before. Success!!I love the front of the place, with items in the store that date back to who knows when, and then you enter the restaurant via a door in the back. Now the ambiance was awesome, the place not loud at all, and the bar area was not packed so we sat down once we all arrived. Since we were all late, our reservation got pushed back, but we made the best of it and sat in the comfy sofas and ate by the bar. The drink menu is fantastic, different combinations of drinks that one would think don't go together, but they do. I love the tapas menu, and we tried so many different combinations that all of them were delicious. The tiny tuna tacos were one of my favorites. We did so much eating from the tapas we didn't have stomach space to sample the rest of the menu but that's ok. Next time!Bathroom is downstairs, clean, with bathroom attendants.

Came in on a Friday around 7 with a reservation for 10 people for a birthday celebration and the place was bustling. We all ordered several dishes and shared everything. Oven braised chicken meatballs - bland, mushy and overly cheesy. Lobster tacos - pretty good; no complaints here. Probably the best dish of the night. Wild mushroom ravioli - nothing special. I've had better ravioli from other places. Like at an Olive Garden. Or from the fridge at Trader Joe's. Lobster mac and cheese - not enough lobster or cheese. Grilled cheese bites - kind of soggy. I ordered the Guinness and prosecco cocktail. My initial reaction when I saw it on the menu was that it was weird. Should have went with my first instinct. Tasted like Guinness that went bad. Sour almost. You don't mess with the Guinness. You're definitely better off ordering a pure one. If you do decide to come here, don't expect to leave stuffed. Do be prepared to have a pretentious small bite to eat though. Maybe I'm just biased since this isn't really my scene. However, I do have to admit that the atmosphere was really nice - and sophisticated. Also, our waitress was super patient. We were in Beauty and Essex for what seemed like 6 hours and she kept her cool the whole time. I probably would have punched a bitch out by then.

Thank goodness for an extra side of the crema because I dropped mine. *Crispy Oyster Rockefeller (4 pieces) - Previously known as chicken fried oysters, a deep fried oyster is served in a soup spoon and topped off with a herby green sauce and piece of bacon. *Garganelli - My least liked dish of the night.  Pasta tubes are tossed in a spicy bolognese sauce, mixed with chunks of veal and topped with a dollop of ricotta.  The dish certainly had a spicy kick but the pasta was too dry.Though we were stuffed, we decided to conclude our meal with the mudslide chocolate bread pudding topped off with a scoop of hazelnut ice cream.  It was moist and not to rich.SERVICE:Our server, Cedric, was fantastic!  He was probably the friendliest server I came in contact with during my NYC visit which lasted over a week.  He was great with the recommendations and introducing us to the menu since we were first timers.

Except the mac and cheese we could have lived with out that.For the prices though, i do think our server could have been more attentive. She didn't really check on us and didn't even refill our glasses of wine (we had a bottle) when our glasses were empty. The prices here are a bit high but I think worth the experience.

Yes we are disgusting. No, I'm not sorry. It was awesome. Faves were the garganelli, bone marrow, and tomato soup dumplings. The drinks were strong and on point. Service was just okay.

3.0,9/14/2013,"This place is definitely unexpectedly trendy because when you walk in you are greeted with items that they are actually selling. This place reminded me more like a jewelry store front. As you walk in through like a secret entrance door, the maitre d' is to your right hand side. There were three of them standing there. One was on the phone and the other 2 was putting the menus together. I was disappointed that none of them acknowledge us and said hi or say ""pls give us a moment"" When the young lady got off the phone she finally asked for the name on the reservation. For this, I subtracted 1 star. The place was very trendy and up scale and if you want to keep that persona at least acknowledge your guest and make them feel welcome.The food was great and it's portions are small because they're served as tapas. We ordered tomato tartare, sashimi tuna, lobster tacos and meatballs. The lobster tacos was my favorite and my least favorite was the meatballs with truffle oil. The food was decent with reasonable price because of the ambiance. I'm taking 1 more star away because our waitress although she was nice wasn't really attentive to us. I had to flag someone down to get our waitress for many occasion.

3.0,9/6/2013,"Beauty & Essex is a trendy restaurant riding on a tide of youth and snobbiness. 20-something year olds dine here to feel a sense of glamour and gaudiness to make up for the fact that they can barely afford rent. As much as I dislike the facade of it, I can't stop myself from loving the food. Gosh darnit, the food! Everything on the menu is reliably good (at least it better be with this kind of price to quantity ratio) definitely try the tomato soup dumplings and peach whipped ricotta bruschetta. Though they are barely bite-sized, they are dangerously addictive. The lobster Mac and cheese is good, but pretty standard with most I have had--not blow-my-mind Wow factor. I also enjoyed the tuna tacos: perfect bites of Tuna tartare hugged by crispy tortilla. The portions are definitely not filling, but filling you up is that's not what they are trying to achieve here. Rather, they are more concerned with upholding their image of chic and trendy, with minimal portions.

But, I had a birthday event there for about 15 people and we were essentially kicked/rushed out by the staff. Not only does it take a little while for fifteen people to finish their meals, but people like to schmooze at these types of things. Once the waiters saw we finished our food they pretty much tried to escort us out by signaling to us (and telling us) that we had to leave soon. I find this outrageous for the price you pay, and for the fact they knew a brunch for 15 people was occurring about an hour before their downtime in between meals.

But after seeing pictures of the red velvet waffles (which weren't on the menu for the deal), we decided to just order from the original menu.We shared the tomato tartare (quail egg and prosciutto crostini), brunch pizzetta (chorizo, manchego, quail egg and potatoes), watermelon and avocado salad (the watermelon was the best part, to be quite honest) and the salt and vinegar fries (it was way too salt and vinegar-y...impossible to finish). Oh, and we shared the empanadas but for some reason, it tasted and stunk like balls. Sweaty balls. It was so horrific. I couldn't even eat the whole thing, which wasn't even big to start with. My friend got the red velvet waffles and fried chicken biscuits. And in the end, we shared the assorted sorbet and ice cream for dessert.

2.0,8/5/2013,Stopped by for a drink as part of general Friday night festivities.The 2 stars are for the overall decor of the place and for the people at the door who were friendly and cheerful. The place is largeThe drinks were pretty bad. The bitter Secretariat was undrinkable and the others had no nuance. We were served by an atrocious bartender who seemed to deem us unworthy of her lousy mixing skills. Bizarrely she started by asking to see all of our IDs again which makes me wonder if what happens at the door stays at the door.The vibe was a little strange with a strange long line suddenly forming to go to the upstairs when we were told a few minutes before that it was off limits.May be worth going to on a quieter evening or for food but I'd advise skipping the friday night attitude.,0,0,0,Arup S.,"New York, NY",21,19,0

You walk through a beautiful door into a nicely appointed bar/lounge area and an adjacent dining room. Just gorgeous! The service was attentive. We were there fairly early in the evening so we planted ourselves in the bar/lounge area until the rest of our party arrived. I mostly ordered martinis, but my friends ordered from the menu and I picked from there. Lobster tacos, truffle French fries, empanadas...all good. As it started to get crowded, we were moved upstairs. The decor was unbelievable. The highlight of the night was the champagne in the ladies room, however.

Ambience: the outside is definitely a little deceiving but i expected that from the pictures and my coworker telling me about this place. I also think its pretty genius to disguise it with a pawn shop in the front. Kinda gave it a speak easy feel. But once you open the doors....OMG! The decor was breathtaking (sorry to sound corny, but its how i felt)!! Tall ceilings, beautiful decor, intimate lighting. Amazing!!Food: The menu I chose was awesome...food for DAYS! my friends and I left with SEVERE itis and 9 trays of leftovers. We had a hard time deciding which was our favorite! The ribs are awesome, the chipotle shrimp are CRACK, the salmon was so succulent! I can go on and on but there's no room to list everything! Lobster tacos are awesome too!!The wait staff were attentive, friendly and very nice. It doesn't hurt that the ladies room gives you free pink champagne either ;-). The drinks are very creative and very delicious. This place is pretty pricey but I think it's worth the quality and service you get. It's definitely fun with a lot of your closest friends.

4.0,7/29/2013,"I had one of those experiences in New York last night that feels like I was swapped into someone else's life. The last time I felt this was on top of the Standard at LeBain. I found myself transported to a place. Surrounded by a cross of a mansion with a nightclub wrapped inside of elegance. Each bite was a moment of edible incredibleness. I needed not lift a finger for anything. I blinked at an empty plate to reveal emptiness in it's place - plate disappeared. Each drink, including the crystal water had an overwhelming smoothness and perfect proportions. A nonchalant pawn shop bejeweled with necklaces and charms of yesteryears shrouds the entrance to a place of dreamland. Past the door opens with grace and ease to chandeliers, moody purple and gold lighting, emulating royalty. While many faces were in attendance I felt a sense of exclusivity. Bar service was quick and unhesitant. The floral scents of juniper escorted me up a staircase straight out of Titanic to an expansive ballroom boasting black leather and tufted banquets; busy models and actors playing waiter and waitress roles. Comfortably nestled in at a surprisingly simple table front it became clear the naked timber slab was just simply a vehicle for our destination to promenade of palpable pleasures. A dining dance of taste buds and delectable delicacies. An amuse bouche ascended and was acquired by hurriedly hands all too soon. Gone and gobbled, greek yogurt was all I remember about the round wafer with rosy red accents. Round 1 was easily as quick. A crystal dish adorned with luscious limes and ruby red and tangerine orange rubies and gems. A crunchy bite into a tender tuna taco yielded a flavor explosion. Calm at the lighting of the fuse, and then BOOM! Almost candied-like tomatoes, sage, rosemary... Ricotta, eggplant and warm toast followed and flowed like a smooth lake of creaminess, light crisp and sweet/savory sensations. It was a double-take when a round pyramid of onion rings introduced itself to the mix and a quarter of empanadas (Stated as spicy in the menu and leaving us licking our lips for a little more flavor). Boardwalk treat turned runway wowzer the O-rings had me saying ""Oh!"" and swaying in my seat. Paired with tomato's finest incarnation and an unknown side dish, white and hovering like a ghost. Consuming and paralyzing like the bite from a vampire - I was howling at the moon. And thus, the moon controls the tide. A tidal wave came my way at first bite of the spaghettini - bursts of lemon, parsley, more lemon, enriching olive oil and a perfectly prepared egg over-easy had an easy ""best thing ever"" response! It was a show-stopper pleading for applause. Every act has an encore and the orchestra behind the line crescendoed a harmony reminiscent of childhood fantasies. PB&J Creme Brulee. Heaven is indeed a place on earth when diving into the crusty bed of Willy Wonka's tears. Peanut butter creme hoisted by a raspberry raft had me sailing off down Delancey St. Beauty is within every fiber and flavor of the establishment.

And a trip up the extravagant fur lined spiral staircase to the terracotta room with the pearl ceiling, should seal the deal for fun. But, the icing on the cake is that the food gets better every time I go and I go often. My last meal there with family, included almost the entire menu and everything was perfectly executed and delicious. And it was very busy at the time as well. I love it here.

Very nice and chic atmosphere (something you wouldn't really expect from viewing the neighbourhood it is in) Dim lighting, but the music is lively and hip enough that it's not one of those dimly lit restaurants that make you want to fall asleep. The service was great all around- the waitresses were very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and were readily at your service. They give you new plates in betweem each dish which is nice.The food is tapa-style and so everything comes in small portions to share. THE FOOD IS AMAZING. Some of my favorites:-watermelon and avacado salad (surprisingly not that small!)-the tuna tacos (its like a tuna tartar taco- so amazing, has a bit of a kick because of the wasabi)-lobster tacos The spaghettini was interesting at first, it was a taste quite new to me. It was a pesto based pasta with a hint of lemon, but after a few bites, it became way too salty. Almost to the extent that it hurt my mouth, but don't get me wrong, I still think it was good- i guess mainly because it was itneresting. The scallops with the sweet corn risotto were good- but not the best scallops ive ever had.Overall, I had a great dining experience and I think that I will surely be back.

The restrooms are always clean and maintained and offer several sinks for washing and private stalls. I came here a few times and spent some decent money and time at the downstairs bar and upstairs bar. The crowd is a little bit mixed. Still its a nice place to chill or get a little crazy with your friends. The second time I came for a meal. BTW this place takes reservations and sometimes 3-4 weeks in advance... The tapas style meal involved us picking a few options, ending up with a ton of options and gluttony. Highlights:1. The chicken meatballs are very good. I think its the gravy sauce which contains truffle oil. That shit makes everything better.2. The empanadas are very good (if you like empanadas). Almost better than the mama.3. The tuna tartar taco is also a treat. Imagine taking a fried taco and put tuna inside.4. The lobster mac and cheese wasn't that great. I've had better.5. The bone marrow is the best thing ever. If you like bone marrow that is. Its offered with pieces of French bread like toast and a bed of capered greens, a jam or jelly that I couldn't quite figure out. You spoon that marrow on the toast after placing some capered greens there and put jelly on top and bam, instant hearty and amazing dish.6. The drink to get has tequila and blackberries in it.

It was a great place to go on a date or with a group of friends.  Now, the food quality and taste has really gone down. They make you wait an hour at least, even with a reservation. Don't be 5 minutes late because then they will punish you.  It seems like every group is a birthday party or tourists. Sometimes you cannot sit down at all while waiting for your table, because of the number of over-bookings or people dallying at their tables.  I guess this is OK if you are a tourist, but the place doesn't have that cool NYC vibe anymore.  If you are on vacation in NYC, it is still worth your while to go here.  If you have never been here, go.

I would go back here just for those. The grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings were too much for me. They were too cheesy and heavy; I prefer normal soup dumplings thank you very much.For entrees, the brick pressed chicken was juicy and tender, but the filet mignon blew it out of the water. In terms of steak, I prefer my ribeye but this filet was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. I liked snacking on the salt and vinegar fries too.For dessert, we tried the petite cupcakes which were very cute and moist. For drinks, I liked the Brooklyn Cooler. I also got the Emerald Gimlet which was good but a bit too strong on the basil front. Love the decor here and the fact that they serve free champagne in the ladies' room.

We called over our server who got the manager & his response was ""OMG that's so disgusting!"" Not exactly how that situation should've been handled. He said he would take it off our bill but then brought out a fresh order of salad, which of course none of us wanted to eat. After that the experience just went downhill. We were paranoid & inspected every other order that came out. The manager never came back over to see if we were ok. And never offered any complimentary dessert or anything.

3.0,7/13/2013,"I felt the need to write this review to forewarn other folks about the GILT Beauty and Essex brunch deal. There is nothing worse than a ""deal"" sounding great and looking reliable only to arrive to redeem it and find it has some shady clauses. In regards to the GILT Beauty and Essex Deal: It is important to note that you have to choose one item from each course to share between the 2 of you. Secondly (and most importantly) if you go as a group with a gilt deal for each pair they try and make all of the people in the group  order the same items for each course. Apparently this is written in the ""fine print' - but we read it carefully and there is no such thing stated explicitly. We ended up talking to the manager and after a lot of discussion she agreed to allow us to order separately by pair. However, having these numerous tense conversations after we had arrived really put a damper on our mood. With that said I will say the food was excellent - the red velvet waffles are AMAZING!  They are apparently having the group of people at brunch issue come up a lot yet the GILT deal continues to be available without revised terms and conditions. It seems like if you make enough of a stink they will honor the original deal even if in a group but come prepared with the right mindset.

It tasted great and I could identify  whole pieces of lobster.The place is aesthetically beautiful, the food was delicious and the service was attentive i.e they refilled the water glasses promptly.

You can tell when you walk in that the place is a bar/restaurant. I guess I'd give it half a star for the semi-novel idea, but it does not appear to be a functioning pawn shop at all, and it just came off as underwhelming. Here's the real problem- RUDE staff!! We bought drinks, eventually headed downstairs to the ladies' room.  The RUDEST attendant informed me and my friend: ""Champagne is closed, girls."" 1) We're women not girls.2) YOUR FRIENDS ARE SITTING ON THE COUCH SIPPING ON CHAMPAGNE.3) Chilled champagne, glasses are VISIBLE TO ME RIGHT NOW.Lame. We left right after that.

You walk through a pawn shop through a set of dingy doors, only to have a literal ::gasp!:: moment to realize how grand the inside of the restaurant is- very unassuming from the outside, and the actual restaurant itself is low lit, grudge-meets-chic vibe.We had to wait 20 min for our table even though we made a reservation weeks in advanced...and only after my sister went to the hostess to remind them that we were still there. A rocky start, however after the wait, everything the service was prompt and timely. It's family share style, and perfect to come in multiples of 3, since most of their plates come with 3-6 of each thing. All of our cocktails were surprising and yummy. We ordered Lobster tacos (overwhelming beer batter on them), Scallops (awesome), their 'famous' meatballs (ate mine in 4 bites), and their ribeye with truffle sauce (I could cut this thing with a butter knife it was amazing). After our main courses, my sister wanted to take my mother to the bathroom, which was fine by me.  But I was getting wary when our strawberry peppercorn dessert came out and I was still waiting on them. They finally came back, and when I asked what took so long, they told me to go to the bathroom after dessert. okay.

2.0,6/11/2013,"Went to Beauty & Essex last week to meet a cousin of mine for the first time (we live in different countries) and was appauled to say the least. It was an important dinner for us because our mothers are very close and this was the first time we were able to bond in the flesh. To cut a long story short the cocktails were expensive but good. The dinner menu was bizarre to say the least, I really wished I had checked it online before maing a booking like I usually do with new places. The waiter tried to explain it but even he seemed unsure.They reccomend that you share the ""main"" plates because they are ""large"" portions, but we chose to get separate mains because the waiter didn't sound very sure of himself and THANK GOODNESS we did. I ordered scallops and risotto which cost $26 + tax, what I got was THREE tiny scallops on a bed of what looked like 3 teaspons of risotto!Great if you have an eating disorder, but bad if you actually enjoy food. My cousin got  chicken and rice which was a better portion than mine. Her boyfriend got a spaghetti bolognese type dish which was decent. Almost as soon as we were done with our meals the waiter (who had been rather pleasant throughout our time there) placed our check on the table! A bit rude but whatever. We paid the $250 bill for three meals + cocktails (me, my cousin and her boyfriend) and proceeded to chat over additional cocktails which evidently did not sit well with the waitstaff. Within 10min of us paying the bill we were asked to leave by the manager because ""other peopl are waiting."" What kind of place is this? I can understand this occuring at an all-you-can-eat buffet in Korea town but at a place that prides itself on being pretentious and expensive...I was gobsmacked!On a positive note the manager did take it upon himself to find us a table in the lounge area so that we would not have to leave the establishment entirely, but still...it was very rude and we were not comfortable so did not stay long after that.Pros: strong cocktails, good-looking people, great music, free quality champagne for women in the bathroom!Cons: self-important bar tenders, overpriced, confusing menu, obnoxious waitstaff and manager. i would not reccomend this place to anyone!

I prefer the intimate feel. the women's bathroom was beautifully and ornately decorated. I was stoked to get the ""free champagne"" I'd heard about so many times. Unfortunately, not only was the bathroom bartender rude, but she asked for my ID. When I told her I had already gotten ID'd to get into the bar, she said she didn't care. I'd left my bag upstairs with my boyfriend, so she wouldn't give me a glass. When I returned later for a second trip, she seemed even more annoyed. I showed her my ID and she poured approximately one sip in the glass and handed it over. I mean, I guess the bathroom bartender is not one of the most desired positions, but still... come on!Also, there was sort of a hamster-cage smell permeating through the entire venue.

I asked for a certain drink and she tried to keep a straight face but kinda cringed and said although those 2 items are great separately...together not so much. And suggested the Bombay 75 which was awesome! (Thank you!), 2) Our server (I did not get her name. Yes, rude but we were a table of 6 with a baby), was fantastic! She was attentive, made great drink suggestions (Brooklyn Cooler...yum) as well as food suggestions which included the baby, 3) Food and drink live up to the overall hype of the place. That said...B&E is pricey but it's all because of the drinks which I think are overpriced at $15 but it's NYC. The food itself is reasonably priced and delish for the most part. The chicken meatballs are totally missing their potential because too much attention is being put into the sauce. Season the meat and those balls will come to life!

4.0,5/21/2013,"If there's anything I've learned about out-of-town visitors, it's that they love being taken to places hidden inside of other places. (Between Beauty & Essex, PDT and The Back Room, you should be set.) So if you've got friends in town, have them duck through the jewelry shop on Essex and show them a good time here.To be perfectly honest, Beauty & Essex isn't really my scene, mostly because it IS a scene. It's dark and sexy, whereas I am (oftentimes) pale and unattractive. The waitresses are scantily clad (and visibly freezing), and the clientele (at most of the times you'd want to go) is unfailingly obnoxious. That said, I don't believe in bashing a place because of the people who patronize it. Especially not when the eating is so very good. Perhaps we just made excellent decisions, but I thoroughly enjoyed everything that was put in front of us. I started with The Bitter Secretariat, a combination of three of my favorite things to drink: bourbon, Fernet Branca, and ginger beer. It was unsurprisingly refreshing and delicious. But I'm all about the food, and I loved it all:The Lobster Mac & Cheese: Obligatorily decadent.The New York Pretzel: An excellent and fresh take covered in meat and crispy shallots. The Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos: Wasabi kewpie? Yes, please.The Kale & Apple Salad: Well-dressed, easy to eat, balanced and delicious.The Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings: Yes.The Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs: Fluffy and flavorful.This is how I love to eat; I want to try as many different dishes as possible, and much like their sister Stanton Social, that's the name of the game here. Perhaps things could be a bit less pricey, but given the atmosphere, the city, and the portions...you could do a lot worse.

4.0,5/19/2013,"Similar in some ways to the owners' other restaurant, Stanton Social, only with more of a theme: kitschy pawnshop in the front / lush and decadent speakeasy in the rear.Similar type of scene:  skewed female/male ratio--very much a girls night/brunch out thing going on.  Tip to single guys:  this is where the hotties are hanging.You'll also recognize some of the food from Stanton Social, though it's not exactly the same. Served as small plates and in slightly different incarnations, e.g. at Stanton Social the French onion soup dumplings are replaced at Beauty with tomato soup cheese and bacon dumplings served on Chinese soup spoons.  Somewhat formulaic to the other restaurant but, hey, it works.In fact, all of the food is very good, and rather unique.  Read the other reviews for details, but the tomato soup, the bacon/chorizo hash, lobster tacos, lemon pancakes, salt and vinegar fries, and the desserts are excellent. Best side of bacon of my life. We went for brunch, which was definitely out of the ordinary.  Beauty is now high on my list to try for dinner.The cocktails are also quite nice. though at $14 they'd better be.Very pleasant environment, good service, though on the loud side (but what isn't on the loud side in Manhattan?)  The champagne bar in the women's bathroom helps on the decadent scale.  Big party room upstairs.

3.0,5/12/2013,"Beauty & Essex deserves TWO stars for attendee demeanor as well as lounge service - imagine being herded through a crowd of faux-hipster snobs with their noses in the air, the lounge stinking of inherited wealth and it's accompany sense of royal entitlement. A man in an 'ironic' tweed blazer shoulders into you as he crosses the floor and gives you a look of disgust as his ginseng lemongrass martini sloshes slightly in the glass. The bartender ignores your attempts and tends to those in Armani while another yips snappishly at you when you wander towards the latter end of the place - ""Are you ORDERING because THIS area is reserved for RESTAURANT patrons"" - it's 1:30am and the people eating are crowded at the bar - the floor plan was open and, with the exception of a few gaggles of apparently privileged people spread across the wide span between small tables, there were no diners to be seen. Is it such a major faux-pas to explore - what if I DID want to order?But enough on that. You can see I gave the lounge three stars, one more than I said it deserved above. Why? THE ATMOSPHERE. Definitely on of the most unique and captivating scenes I've experienced in New York City. Priceless jewels in glass cases create dividing rectangles, almost like filters as you walk in - causing the curious to pause for a look and allowing the well-versed to slide by without much trouble. A winding staircase, walls mirrored and covered in unusual light fixtures, beautiful tile floors, all leading to a grand entrance into the bar and 'mingling' area, a few feet before the forbidden 'restaurant' area begins. Every added touch is a captivating work of art. I spent half my time just viewing them, and that, I think, gave me the most satisfaction. I would not go again, but I will never forget reaching out and gently resting my fingertips on the mirrored wall of lights, feeling as if another dimension lay just beyond my touch.On a final note, there is a free bag check, gloriously ornate and spacious restrooms (with - ironically - the most friendly staff), and no cover charge. Nice! in a way, these things allow you to check out the place without any real commitment, and you can decide for yourself what you think.",0,0,0,Carrie Rose L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,0
4.0,5/7/2013,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning with a group of four. You enter the restaurant through an unassuming pawn shop, which though gimmicky is actually pretty cool. The restaurant itself is very wide and open with a beautiful glass skylight. Decor is very twenties glamorous with a touch of modern. Great place to bring friends who are visiting as the setting leaves quite an impression. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. The one slip up was that he suggested my boyfriend's sister was my mother when carding me which didn't go over very well at all (I'm 23, she's 30). He should have kept his age judgements to himself. The food is served tapas style. They suggest you order 8 or so things for a group of 4. We went with: scones, pancakes, lobster potatoes, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, eggs Benedict, grits and mac n' cheese. Everything was great. The standouts for me were the mac n' cheese and pancakes but others thought the grits were best. Overall a very enjoyable brunch.

4.0,5/1/2013,"I had a very enjoyable experience at B&E. I came on a Sunday with my parents for my birthday. Full disclosure I am a sucker for a speakeasy. It may be gimmicky but it gets me every time. You walk through a door in the back of a little pawn shop. It feels like stepping through The looking glass. You enter into a beautiful space with a spiral staircase and chandelier at the front.  I immediately went downstairs to the bathroom because I was so excited about the free champagne bar in the ladies room that I've heard so much about. I got to say it is a really nice touch. It makes me appreciate being a lady even more. I did however actually order a cocktail non gratis. It was called an ODB And was essentially tequila with muddled smoked blackberries. I thought it was pretty unique and you can actually taste the smokiness of the Berries.Onto the food... Being that it was my birthday I was feeling awfully gluttonous. I definitely enjoyed the apps the most. My favorites were the tuna poke wonton tacos, ny style pretzel, and the lobster tacos. The pain con tomate wasn't my favorite but my brother seemed to enjoy it, and since his girlfriend is from Spain, he knows a thing or 2 about pain com tomate. The one dish I didn't like was the charred shishito peppers. I am the biggest shishito pepper fan and got really excited when I saw them on the menu. But we all agreed they tasted kinda weird. They had an overpowering fake lemony flavor. We ended up sending them back. My family is pretty healthy and we aren't really meat eaters, so the mains stayed pretty light. I gotta say I think my favorites were the sides of asparagus and broccolini. So often at restaurants vegetables get drowned in butter. Not the case here. Fresh and delicious. The spaghettini was pretty good, very fresh tasting. Tuna was nothing special and I didn't try the salmon but my dad seemed to enjoy it. For dessert I followed yelpers suggestions and got the black bottomed pot de creme. My expectations were maybe too high because it was good but it didnt blow me away. Not worth the calories in my opinion. They brought me a cupcake for my birthday and it was probably one of the best I've ever had... And I've had a lot of cupcakes in my day! The pb and j creme brûlée was nice... I mean it tastes exactly what it sounds like... I definitely prefer plain or pistachio creme brûlée but it was cool to see a fresh take on it. Overall I had a great experience at B&E. the space was beautiful, the menu was playful, and our waiter was great. He actually looked exactly like dwayne wade.

3.0,4/18/2013,"Food was pretty tasty and loved the free champagne in the ladies room. Service leaves a lot to be desired though. We went for brunch with 2 others at 2:15pm on a Sunday. The reservation was for 2:15 but we then were told to wait at the bar for about 10 more minutes. Unfortunately, although we were standing at the bar for over 10 minutes, the bartender couldn't manage to get us 2 Bloody Marys and 1 Mimosa in that timespan. When the hostess came to seat us, we had to tell the bartender to cancel the drink order. Once seated, we re-ordered said drinks but then had to wait another 15 minutes for them to arrive. The waiter actually came to take our food order before the drinks arrived, and when we asked when the drinks would be coming he copped a bit of an attitude and told us the bartender was ""really busy"" and that we basically should STFU. Sorry, but that's not my problem. I've worked in the restaurant industry and it should never take 30 minutes to get one Bloody Mary. Besides the ridiculous wait for drinks, the food was decent. Not amazing, but not horrible. The avocado salad and eggplant pizzetta were okay. When the bill came, it boiled down to about $60 per person for 5 tapas plates and 2 drinks each.  Overall, really overpriced for such a ""meh"" experience. Honestly, the free champagne in the ladies' room bumped this up to 3 stars for me.

3.0,4/18/2013,"Okay, I will preface this review by saying that my friend who made the reservation did not tell me anything about the weird entrance so I ended up standing outside for 10 minutes wondering if I was at the right place. I eventually made it into the restaurant but was a bit annoyed/embarrassed at this point. So they sat us down at a small table about a foot from other guests on either side. Not exactly an imitate setting. To drink I had the ""Platinum Peacock"" which is a virgin drink made of pineapple and some other stuff. It was really good! I don't drink so I always enjoy when they have special virgin cocktails at restaurants. We started the meal off with the tuna tacos and the NY pretzel, both of which were really good. However the NY pretzel dish did not resemble anything close to a pretzel. I mean I get that its supposed to be deconstructed and ""fusion"" or whatever but it was basically beef on top of a piece of bread. We also had the tamales and the wild mushroom pizza, both of which were quite good. The service was fine, other than at the end of the meal when the waiter didn't give us our credit card back and took forever to find it. I was told by my guest that the women's bathroom is really awesome, but guys let me tell you the men's is nothing special. Not that I would take a star off for this, I mean it's a bathroom.

Dimness, loudness, and elegance filled the atmosphere... even the female bathroom was feminine and inviting with a sofa and champagne bar. Too bad I went to bathroom alone, otherwise I'd be drinking there too. Food was good, had the Spanish dumplings [forgot what they were called], mushroom ravioli, and salmon entree. The salmon dish was small, but surprisingly quite filling. Couldn't even finish the chocolate cake and ice cream we had for dessert.  I had one bite of the chocolate and it was too irresistible!

I love tapas style b/c I'm a taster so we ordered about 5 small plates and an entree each. I'm sure all of the other reviews delve into the ins and outs of what to order so I'll stick to 'everything I ate was good' and therefore I need to go back to try all of the other things I missed out on eating. The drinks were excellent, strong.

Love the bathroom downstairs with the Champagne served as you powder your nose which ompletely supports why women need to go to bathroom in groups....so they can toast with some bubbly.  You must come in for some cocktails to check out the whole scene if you weren't proactive enough to make reservations.  The B & E cabernet was smooth, medium bodied to compliment the diverse food options.  The must have is the NY pretzel which is razor thin slices of roast beef served on pretzel bread.  It had a wasabi creamy kick to it.  Lobster Tacos were petite, but delicious.  I could have passed on the Roasted Corn, it seemed relishy and better if it was served on top of a protein.  Save room for dessert: Get the Pot with the cookie spoon.  Tiered sweetness to die for.  I have brought my 3 kids all under the age of 7 here twice, once for brunch and once for dinner.  If you come for brunch or eat early enough (5:30 reservation), it is very kid-friendly.   Coat check guy was so accommodating carrying the stroller downstairs & the servers were so great with the kids.  I was an out of towner taking an out of towner out for dinner & this place was spot on.",3,0,0,Kara P.,"San Diego, CA",327,416,1683

It seemed like they were waiting for the empty tables and by than I was jist really hungry and got frustrated. The place is nice and a bit fancy than I thought it'd be but what's the point of all that? It was really loud and the entreé I ordered didn't taste all that great. It was scrambled eggs with supoosedly sausage on top of bite size bread. I could've done that myself. For $14 idk if that was worth it. Our waitor was really awesome and he was really kind and I appreciate him trying to help and talk to us bout the menu but it seemed like there wasn't enough waitors/waitresses cuz he took forever to get to us to after another half an hour we placed an order and than another half an hour waiting for the food to finally come to us. Even our waitor passed by us 2-3 times and mentioned to us where our food was! That's how long we waited! Just to have brunch at a place that made us wait for so long didn't taste that great. At least not my entreé. For $14 I could've gone somewhere else. Besides the nice waitor, I don't have any other good reasons to why I should come back.

1.0,4/1/2013,"Wow... Talk about a lot of hype.....My experience at this location was not a pleasant one. It's a nice looking venue don't get me wrong but don't let the decorations fool you. The servers are to snobby and rude for my liking. The food was not all cracked up to be. I tasted the empanadas, not at all enjoyable. Literally tiny bites as small as my pinky finger. Then there was the enchiladas again very super tiny bites and didn't have the true taste a a Mexican enchiladas. I felt like a giant eating them. Last there was the salt and vinegar fries, which needed to be cooked more instead of being soggy limp fries with no crunch.Over all, this place is no bueno. Also to add, only one open bathroom for brunch hours and one stall. One bathroom downstairs because they closed off the upstairs bathroom not really sure why. In closing, if you want super tiny like food and not worth the price they mark it for then go here. But if you want real food that will feed your hunger head else where :)  and pronto!",2,0,3,Mae M.,"Auburn, CA",190,282,22
5.0,4/1/2013,"DELISH!!!!I've been here twice. First time is for one of my girlfriend's birthday and second time was this past saturday. Their food was good the first time and the second time is even better!I've passed by this place many times before but never new what it was because on the outside, they have a  pawn shop and when you get passed the doors, the restaurant is there. The one thing that I remembered the most from the first experience was their bone marrow so I HAD to order it the second time.Appetizers:Bacon & Cheese Dumpings - Anything with bacon is good but with CHEESE TOO?? perfect combo! This comes in an order of six and each dumpling is served in a spoon with some tomato soup so you can just eat it from the spoon (how thoughtful and convenient). Their presentation was nice and even the table next to us asked us what it was. French Fries - So crisp and flavorful. The waitress said it was salt and vinegar flavored. Came with ketchup and mayo for dipping. So good!Bone Marrow - Came with six pieces of toast and also some caramelized onions on the side. So delicious if you're a fan of bone marrow like me :) MUST TRY!Entrees:Chicken Meatballs - Came in an order of three with a tasty sauce. I ordered this because of all the reviews on yelp. I actually did not enjoy this because it was a bit bland for me. We didn't finish the last meatball.Rigatoni - Came in a decent sized bowl and also provided extra cheese and chili flakes on the side in case you want an extra kick to your pasta. This dish was surprisingly good! Very flavorful and that extra cheese helps!Side of Corn - DELICIOUS! I love love love love love corn so this is probably my favorite thing of all time! Roasted corn with lime, avocado and red peppers topped with cheese. HOW GOOD DOES THAT SOUND??? Must get this!They also have a HUGE selection of alcoholic beverages, from wine to beer..so you will definitely have a good time!If you haven't tried this place out yet, must try!",0,0,1,Karol L.,"Brooklyn, NY",132,242,350

We had: red velvet waffles, grilled cheese & tomato soup dumplings, the fried chicken biscuits, and the lobster & chorizo hash. RV waffles: were fine. Probably the lowlight of our meal. Ask for extra cream cheese icing. Dumplings: AMAZING. So good. Would come back for these alone. Chicken Biscuits: Good. Flavorful. Comes with a good Orange Sauce. Hash: Was fine. Forgettable, but added something as a side. I felt a little neglected service-wise since we were dining on a coupon, but no serious complaints.

4.0,3/31/2013,"This place was so awesome. I loved it. First of all, there's FREE champagne and a couch in the bathroom, how cool and swanky is that? I don't judge places on ambiance as much as I judge it on food, but I loved the ambiance inside. Hidden behind a pawnshop, the decor upon entering was gorgeous. I'm not exactly sure why but the winding staircase and the space structure and lighting reminds me of what I would imagine an old southern plantation house would be like. The following dishes are ones we shared that i absolutely LOVEDDDDDD:1. Lobster Tacos2. Lobster Mac and Cheese -- I eat a LOT of mac and cheese. It's my favorite food so I'm pretty picky when it comes to judging mac and cheese. I love when the spiraly pasta is used (which it was). Instead of being super cheesy, this mac and cheese was surprisingly more lobster-y. The touch of bread crumbs on the top was awesome. 3. Crispy Eggplant Pizzetta4. NY Pretzel5. Yellowtail Crudo6. Peanut Butter and Jelly Creme Brulee - not entirely the most amazing thing but I really liked it because it was different. You don't get peanut butter creme brulee everyday!Other dishes we had that didn't really make the amazing cut but were still pretty delicious:Mushroom Pizzetta - definitely go for the eggplant one instead!Salt and Vinegar FriesPetite CupcakesOnion RingsMolten Chocolate Bread Pudding Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos - definitely go for the lobster ones instead! The service was good and upon walking out (we dined on Saturday night around 9pm), it seemed like the bar was pretty hoppin' too.

Our waiter went missing for some time, but the quality of the food and the presentation alone made up for it! Try the hand cut prime steak tartar, and  the grilled cheese dumplings in tomato soup, these were by far the best.

I understand you have a job but come on REALLY, My friend came out to get me and then we got in. This place is not that big, We went down stairs to do a coat check which was smooth and fine, Now there is another line just to get upstairs and yet we had to deal with another bouncer.

I ordered a $125 bottle of champagne and she brought out DIRTY champagne glasses. REALLY?!?!? Fail to refill the champagne without having to asked. Had to raise my voice and hand to get her attention only to have her give me the index finger and told me to hold on. I usually tip at least 20% being that fact that I'm in the industry. I left her less than $4 on a $400 tap. I hope servers have to tip out there cause I want her to pay to have me sit at her table. I wrote the manager a note only to find him approaching me and apologizing for her mistakes.

4.0,3/15/2013,"I came here using a Gilt City Coupon for the $75 brunch for two that included 4 courses (and a side) and a bottle of champagne.When you first walk into this restaurant/lounge, it looks like a fancy pawn shop, but there are multiple open rooms.  I was quite in awe of the size of this restaurant considering we live in a tiny island called Manhattan.  Onto the brunch food: Lemon Blackberry Pancakes with sweet ricotta: The pancakes were a decent size and there were actual blackberries in the pancakes.  They were light, fluffy and delicious, and went well with the first round of champagne.Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings: A very interesting concept.  The dumplings ended up being a bit chewier than expected.  Also, when I think of soup dumplings, I cannot help but think of Joe's Shanghai.  This particular soup dumpling's tomato soup was more like a tomato sauce.Lobster & Chorizo Hash (peruvian potatoes, cilantro butter): A little too salty, but crispy (which I love) and only a couple measly pieces of lobster.Braised Short Rib 'Huevos Rancheros' (sunny side up eggs, black beans, cotija):  The short rib was cooked well and I love sunny side up eggs.  However, I thought the hard shell taco discs were unnecessary.Molten Chocolate Bread Pudding (hazelnut ice cream): absolutely delicious. I thought it might be too sweet, but it wasn't at all. I would've loved to eat more of it, but I was too full from the rest of the meal.An additional perk: if you need some more booze and you are being mindful of your wallet, just go to the bathroom and you'll get a complimentary glass of pink bubbly.Overall, my experience with the food was okay, but the service was good and I love the atmosphere.  I would definitely love to come back for dinner.",1,0,0,Sarah L.,"Los Angeles, CA",215,176,93

5.0,3/13/2013,"Oh sweet Jesus. What do you get when you cross a Beverly Hills pawn shop with a 1920's, Upper East Side flapper hot spot? I'll tell you. It's Beauty & Essex. And if you don't like either of those two things, then stop reading this right now because there is no hope for you as a person.During my recent weekend jaunt back east to the city, I was able to score a semi-last minute reservation for a Friday night and was anxiously awaiting dinner time throughout the entire day.  Our driver dropped us off out front and the only telltale sign of this place is the huge light up sign on an otherwise blank wall of buildings and New York City grime.  (cue flapper hot spot).  When you walk in the door, you are greeted by a cramped, odd pawn shop that is literally overflowing with pretension.  I wish I had spent more time browsing here because at first glance I can tell you that everything in there is expensive, beautiful, and vintage. WIN.Making your way through the shop and into the actual restaurant, your senses will explode.  The vaulted ceilings, beautiful people, intricate lighting, and glass atrium that marks the center of the dining room come together to form something out of a movie.  Shock and awe factor in full form.Like any good dining experience, we had about three different people serving us the entire night and never had an empty drink or empty plate!  I love good service.  Naturally, we spent more money on drinks than food...which isn't too hard to do considering the specialty cocktails were $14 each but so worth it.  All of the food is essentially tapas style and we got four dishes between two people and were set.Food:Oysters (East coast and West coast): Being from the east coast, I may have been partial, but the mixture was pretty solid.  The condiments were great and each piece was fresh.  Tomato soup and grilled cheese dumplings: If you take away one thing from this, it should be to GET THIS DISH.  Little spoons filled with tomato soup and a huge bacon stuffed grilled cheese dumpling floating in it.  NEED I SAY MORE?!Eggplant pizzetta: I wish I could eat this every day for the rest of my life.  Even if you don't like eggplant, you should try this dish.  Recommended by everyone I talked to in the restaurant and in NYC that weekend for that matter...Broccolini with garlic, soy, and chile:  Basically broccoli that looks like asparagus.  The soy and chile gave it a pretty nice Asian-fusion taste.Drinks:Emerald gimlet, broken blossoms, masterly touch, opal martini.  Unfortunately I don't even remember what was in each of these (I'm sure it says on the website...) but they were all phenomenal.

Fair enough I suppose.Our 4th arrived at 1:25 and I told the hostess. She acknowledged me and said it would be a few moments. After 10 min, my fiancé went to see how much longer the wait would be. The hostess said that we missed our reservation - and that we would have to wait for all the other people to be seated before us. That hardly seems fair. We were 10 min late and they said they had a ""15 minute grace period."" Well apparently, the hostess hadn't heard me when I reported that our party was there, and she recorded the time at 1:34 as having us all arrived. I was fuming.Around 1:50 we were seated at the back albeit WORST table in the restaurant. But, surprisingly the food was rather tasty. Small portions, but pretty good.Not good enough to go back and face the booooch staff endure the rigid time policies.",5,3,0,Shelly D.,"Chicago, IL",100,76,0

Seemed a little pretentious when i walked in because the hostess was on the phone and refused to look up at me to see if I needed help. Well anyway, my friends arrived a bit later and we said we had reservations and everything was fine after that. Decor is classy. Good tapas, and good drinks! There is champagne is the girls bathroom, made me happy. One less drink to buy (pretty expensive, $14) We had the lobster tacos, salt and vinegar fries, box of doughnuts. oh and that grilled cheese soup thingy is sinful! loved the beauty elixir drink.

The place is child friendly, just don't bring any strollers. The food is absolutely wonderful. I have eaten at their sister restaurant and I just adore the idea of ordering 8 or 9 dishes and they are all miniature sizes. My absolute favorite dish is the dumplings in the tomato soup. The manager actually was so kind to send us a order of the chocolate cake and ice cream for my cousins birthday! Champagne in the restrooms and a book keeper to have you bouncing off the walls!!

4.0,2/28/2013,"Went here with fellow Yelp Elite Albert L. for a weekday dinner. Not having down my usual research on this place, the pawnshop storefront threw me off at first. It's kinda weird, but a neat idea though. The actual behind the door is huge and very classy and trendy.The menu has a lot of dishes and it's hard to choose between all these items that sound great. We ordered the tuna tacos, bone marrow, grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings, kale & apple salad, and ribs. The standouts were the bone marrow and dumplings. The bone marrow was huge! What a generous portion. Two delicious crosswise-split bones, a pile of buttered toast, and a sort of jam. We almost got full off of this. The grilled cheese dumplings were true to taste and served in cute little spoons. Points for creativity.The other dishes were also pretty good, except that the ribs were bland and a little dry. After eating the other four dishes, we could have definitely done without this one.And of course, if you're a girl, you gotta check out the gorgeous ladies room! Coolest bathroom EVER. How can you not love a champagne bar in the bathroom?Points for the great music playing in the background ( hip-hop and 90s jams - I dig it). but a big MINUS for not giving us an amuse bouche! We saw other tables next to us getting one, how come we got shafted??All in all though, it's a fun, neat place, great for friends or a girl's night out.",2,1,1,Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",478,767,323

5.0,2/25/2013,"I found this gem of a deal on Gilt City in search for an early birthday gift.  It was brunch for 2 with free champagne for $75. I chose this place because of the decor that was shown on both Gilt and Yelp.  Both the food and service were amazing.

4.0,2/24/2013,"First and most importantly, shortly after my last review, a representative from Beauty & Essex contacted me and asked me if I would discuss my experience with the manager.  I agreed, and I was almost immediately contacted by the manager, who expressed his disappointment in the situation.  He invited us to come back for dinner, and he personally made our reservation and was on hand to ensure things went smoothly.  I am very impressed that B&E takes customer feedback as seriously as it does, and I appreciate their commitment to making sure their patrons are completely satisfied.  So ... moving on to the actual meal ....My girlfriend and I had dinner at B&E last night. Our reservation was at 7pm, and we waited only briefly to be seated - just enough time for a quick drink at the bar.  The bar area was almost completely empty, but the restaurant was fairly full. Our waitress was attentive and explained how everything is designed to be shared. She suggested we order five small plates and indicated she would bring them out in courses.  We ordered the General Tso's monkfish, the Stanton Social's Chipotle grilled shrimp, broccollini, and we each ordered a burger, as we were starving.  The grilled shrimp and the monkfish came out together as the first course, and they were both standouts.  Both dishes were delicious, and I was surprised by how generous the portions were.  The shrimp dish offered four very large pieces and the monkfish was a large serving dish filled to the brim.  Super! The broccollini came next and it was fine.  I can't really get overly excited about broccollini, but as far as broccollini goes, this was good - very fresh with good flavor. The burgers were our last ""course"" and they were also good.  There was nothing particularly special about them, but again, very generously sized, very fresh, and tasty.  We skipped dessert, which was probably a mistake, but as I said, the portions here are BIG and we were stuffed.  By the time we left (about 9pm) the bar area was jammed, the music was pumping, and it was very loud.  We chose not to stay and moved on to a quieter place where we could have a conversation without screaming at one another. Overall, I'd say B&E is a great choice if you want  good food, good drinks, and a ""scene"".  I'm not sure that I'd come back for dinner, but I would definitely consider giving brunch a go.  Well done, Beauty & Essex!",0,0,0,Danielle A.,"New Providence, NJ",52,53,1

I went with my boyfriend here for their Gilt City brunch and was very happy with the service.  The staff is really accommodating and pleasant. The food was great as well the sharing portions. Here are my favorites from the Gilt City Brunch list.  You should order:- Cheese, Bacon, and Tomato soup dumplings ( the name does not do it justice but think of it as eating the smallest grilled cheese sandwich on a soup spoon. Delicious-Sunny Side up Eggs w Braised BBQ ribs Huevoros w Black Bean and Montija- they come in these cute tortillas bowl shaped and layered with tons of shredded ribs, topped with a sunny side egg ( which looks more like poached egg style instead)Amazing- it can be quite messy so eat cautiously-Kale & Apple Salad: I'm a sucker for anything kale and especially in a salad- I'm sold on that concept.-fried chicken bites- although I did not personally order this, I will have to say this...it was a big big big hit and success with people who did order this around me.

Framed pictures adorn free space on the wall. !FOOD: 3.25 starsHaving never been to Beauty and Essex I didn't know what to expect.  We order cockails and about 5 appetizers.  East West oysters, lobster tacos, garganelli, Wanton tacos,grilled cheese dumplings, chipotle grilled shrimp.  It was just average.  Only dish that I actually enjoyed was the Lobster tacos.  The food was  comfort food persuasion.  The try to make it fancy but I'm not buying it...  Nothing wrong with that of small tapas style dishes; you definitely wouldn't find fine dining at these prices in these quantities. Still, some more reasonably priced or better yet better tasting would've been appreciated.SERVICE: 3.5 starsWe had a reservation but were kept waiting for 15 minutes. The place was packed, so this was somewhat understandable.Service was adequate.  Our waitress was a hottie.  Wow!  Extra half a point ;)OVERALL: 3.5 starsSince Yelp doesn't allow for partial ratings, I'm choosing to round down to 3 stars. Though the food was somewhat tasty, it wasn't too memorable and the quality could've been better. Service could've been better, and m3aybe that's due in part to the uncomfortable seating arrangement.

4.0,2/23/2013,"We came here on a Friday night. Didn't know what to expect, but we had heard a lot of great things about this restaurant.The restaurant was very nice. if you can, try to make reservations for the back, big room since it's fancier than the first room.The waitress had recommended that we order two or three dishes a person. We went ahead and ordered a total of seven. Yes, there was too many items on the menu that we couldn't turn down.We started with the New York Pretzel. It was pretty good and the mustard aioli sauce gave it a nice kick. My wife ordered the Charred Shishito Peppers, but I didn't care much about them since I'm not a fan of peppers. She enjoyed it a lot and raved about the seasoning. They then brought out the Lobster Tacos which had a bit of red cabbage and poblano crema to top it off. They were very good, and if you like fish or shrimp taco, you'd definitely like them. I ordered the Pan Roasted Scallops, which I thought was excellent. It was served on top of a sweet risotto. I'm normally not a big fan of risotto because of the strong cheese taste, but these were very good. We also ordered a side of the Vidalia Onion Ring Tempura, which we both thought we should have skipped. They tasted like regular onion rings that you order at a diner.My favorite out of everything was the Grilled Double Cut Lamb Chops that my wife had ordered. They were flavorful and very delicious, and most likely the best lamb chops I ever had. They also went very well with the Yukon Gold Potato Puree. I highly recommend getting both of those.To end it, we shared the Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Crème for dessert. It was simply superb. Tasted delicious. Totally a must-try.Overall, this was a very nice restaurant, and perfect if you'd like to bring a date.

The hostess was incredibly rude, unsympathetic and kept saying the table would be ready in ""5 minutes.""  An hour later, I asked for a manager. He was very, very sweet and apologetic and comped champagne and dessert. But had I not asked to speak to him, I'm sure the gal at the desk wouldn't have seated me or comped anything. Her attitude was enough for me to go elsewhere. (And I hope her boss reads this).As for the meal, good food and cocktails. Liked the salt and vinegar fries the best.

Overall it was honestly GREAT!Food: 1st) Lemon Ricotta Pancakes - These were delicious and so filling! My friend and I were not expecting such large portions after reading all of the ""tapas-like"" disclaimers. There were 3 fluffy pancakes topped with a dollop of ricotta and a side of maple syrup. Not only were the pancakes fluffy, but hello surprise of lemon! So lemon-ie and so so good, also in the middle there is an amazing blackberry or blueberry compote surprise. After one pancake I was full but there were still so many courses coming!2nd) Tomato & Eggplant Pizetta - Again such a large portion for 2 people. Little flatbread squares with a delicious tomato sauce, some cream or cheese of some sort and the amazing fried little eggplant slice. Let me preface by saying, I am a vegetarian and I do not like eggplant. This eggplant was fantastic! They tasted like little sausages which was odd but great.3rd) Egg Frittata - Lots of little triangle slices of Fritatta came on a long plate. By now we were pretty stuffed and forcing food down. That and the oncoming buzz from our bottle of champagne. This course was good, nothing to write home about. It was also the only meatless option in the 3rd course category so unfortunately for my meat eating friend it was our only option. 4th) Grits (marscapone and vanilla to be exact) - My first experience with grits and I was pleasantly surprised. They were hearty and sweet with a great texture.5th) Chocolate Bread Puddings (we subbed out the hazelnut ice cream for vanilla due to allergies). OK we were full, so so full and said ok just one bite..... That did not happen because this final dish was oh so decadent and amazing. I am a fan of bread pudding but usually prefer the classic flavors and was apprehensive about a  chocolate take on the dessert. This was like a filling, hearty chocolate souffle cake.Overall way too much food! Which was great and we could have easily had an additional person join us (if the deal allowed).The restaurant is beautiful inside..very shwanky. The bathroom downstairs is lovely. We left full, buzzed and smiling on this snowy day. The service was fine. No complaints but also nothing to rave about. I will be re-visiting for sure! I think it is all about what you order and there were so many mixed reviews on Yelp it's hard to tell. Portion wise I think we accidently ordered the largest dishes for each course.

The storefront is designed to look like beauty parlor, so don't be deceived. Once inside, the ambiance is beautiful. One of the classiest and most feminine spots I've been to on the Lower East side.

5.0,1/31/2013,"I was here for brunch with two friends from out of town last sunday.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was a glass case with antique jewelry and vintage designer accessories displaced out front. Chandeliers and dim lighting and lush sofas along the wall with wall-fixtures just makes this place for lack of a better word, """"Beautiful"".  Even the bathrooms are beautiful and old-timey, with antique perfume bottles lining the softly lit mirrors. As we waited for a short while at the bar, my friends and I kept saying, ""this place is so beautiful"" from the diners, the plating, the decoration, the seats, the serving staff, just the overall ambience embodies classiness, beauty, nostalgia, and romance. Bring a romantic date here or your favorite girl friends for a lazy weekend brunch. In the evening on weekends they open the second floor as a lounge/dance club and the first level as a bar/lounge area with hot music and beautiful people (or so I've heard). For a party of three at brunch they recommend about 5 - 7 plates, as it is a tapas style with bite-size portions. I recommend the lobster tacos and the red velvet waffles (they are mini and bite-sized, but I've said that already).  Make a reservation in advance and schedule your birthday brunch at Beauty & Essex :)",0,0,0,Grace Lee A.,"New York, NY",42,311,54
5.0,1/31/2013,"Chris Santos, my culinary crush on you has been amplified times 1000! You have created a GEM of a space, worthy of spending into the triple digits. Absolute kudos to every member of your staff, who were all well versed in the art of customer service. My party of three was seated in a cozy corner booth, which had plenty of room to spread every which way we felt without being obtrusive to other guests dining around us. Our server was DARLING - Lando made some great suggestions right off the bat, had a positive, upbeat attitude about him, was absolutely attentive when needed and checked in with us throughout our dining experience. The food runners were equally as positive, bringing us our selections in succession with genuine excitement. And now that I have eaten Mr. Santos's cuisine, I understand where that excitement comes from. The empanadas, lobster tacos, yellowtail tuna crudo, scallops and rigatoni were all flavorful, complex and with just the right amount of bite and heat to them. Served tapas style (the best way to dine in my Greek opinion) and perfectly spaced out, each mouthful could be enjoyed without impeding on the next one. The oysters from the raw bar were a perfect start to the culinary experience of the evening. Where special hat tipping is due would be with the signature cocktails. I have NEVER tasted anything as refreshingly potent as the Beauty Elixir. Everything about this drink sang SUMMER, but felt oddly appropriate paired with the picante elements of the dishes we dined on. In contrast, The Molten Chocolate Bread Pudding with hazelnut ice cream had a bruleed shell that was all warm, wintry spice and sugar. Best three way desert EVER. After paying our bill, Lando thanked us for coming to the resteraunt in a manner that I have never really encountered at any other eatery. If all the servers are like him, I can see Beauty and Essex setting the bar on what a modern, hip fine dining experience should be.",0,1,0,Julia F.,"Brooklyn, NY",122,200,62

1.0,1/29/2013,Before attending beauty and Essex I was so excited from reading the menu with all what I thought would be wonderful tasting tapas brunch dishes. That was not the case. The service was terrible. It took about 20 minutes to get a drink and that was the only highlight of my meal if your into very spicy bloody marys. The food was awful. No one at my table enjoyed their meal. We got the Pork Belly BLT which was really an overly cooked piece of bacon smothered in mayo to mask the taste. The grilled cheese spoons were a cute presentation but did not taste like tomato soup and grilled cheese but cardboard instead. The fried chicken bites (a recommendation by our waitress) were less then desirable and inedible. To top off this horrendous meal the ceiling had a leak in the restaurant so the restaurant was sopping wet and a table had to move causing a big commotion. For the 2 hours I was stuck there the water did not stop pouring out it was disastrous. Despite the amazing ambiance the food is inedible at best. Immediately leaving this place I went over to the local grocery store to get food that I was actually able to eat.,1,0,0,Shayna B.,"Miami, FL",2,52,1

3.0,1/23/2013,"I went here on a date and I'd definitely give my date two thumbs up for picking this place! Let's start off with the fact that when you arrive at this place, you think you're walking into a random pawn shop...until they ask you if you have a reservation. You walk inside and the place transforms into this beautiful (and huge) bar/restaurant. I went on a Friday night, our reservation was for 11:30, and this place was PACKED. We sat down in their dining room which was quite beautiful.Pros: The cocktails were DELICIOUS. I would definitely go back here for their bar. The service is fantastic: our waitress was friendly, helpful, and attentive. The environment was definitely interesting, and beautiful. Definitely a nice place to get dressed up for. And lastly, there was champagne in the ladies' room. 'NUFF SAID. Cons: It was dark (not really a con) and LOUD. Music was blasting, had to yell at my date to get anything across. It would have been nice if the volume was brought down just a tad for the dining room area (which is right next to the bar). Food gets a B-, I think. They definitely have interesting options, but the execution could use a bit of help. Food ended up being quite bland. One thing I would recommend, however, is the spicy grilled shrimp. Regardless, for the amount of food you get (it's tapas style) and how much you pay, I'd rather go to another restaurant where the food makes a lasting impression. I don't think this is the greatest place to take a date, mainly because you have to yell at them to understand them (and half the time, even when yelling, I couldn't understand my date). That being said, if you want to impress someone, definitely take them here.

I was a little confused when we came upon a pawn shop but then we were ushered into this totally swanky glitzy retro space. The waitresses were all friendly and cute (which is rare, usually it's one or the other). Now for the food. We must've made some good choices because I don't think I could complain about anything. We had the tuna tacos (perfect raw tuna with crunchy shell and citrus), eggplant ""toast"" (actually on soft focaccia so it doesn't tear up your mouth like real toast), and the grilled cheese dumplings. Oh my heaven, they were so great, and I just had to get all the tomato soup out of the spoon they were served on (trust me, it looked a little indecent but was worth it). We had the baked chicken with polenta that was so moist and tender. For dessert we had the doughnuts and molten bread pudding. At this point we were disgustingly full but dessert was so sweet and satisfying, we powered on. The bread pudding has like a burnt sugar crust to compliment the soft, gooey interior.

Food was pretty good - bbq fries were amazing while the pork belly BLT was mediocre and bland. Other people seemed to enjoy their food, but nothing very rave-worthy. Service was bad . Our waiter said things were family-style. We were a large group so decided we would each order our own food and pass things around to share as we saw fit. When we told the waiter this plan, he seemed annoyed and told us food would come out as they were prepared. Fine, whatever, no need for the attitude (food all came at once anyway). Also most of the food on the brunch menu were pretty large portions, despite tapas-style suggesting that servings would be small. Service got worse when we paid - we used only 2 credit cards and cash (for 6 people) and wrote amounts down very clearly by last name. He screwed it up (put one person's charge on another's card) but we were nice and let it go. Then he comes back and said we underpaid by $35.

If the price for it all were ok then we'd be friends as well. But the nearly $400 per person for a table on new years eve was sooooo far from what this place has to offer that I thought I would highlight it out loud, even though you might never consider it for new years eve (even the $200 for ""VIP"" entry was crazy enough)...cause of course new years eve is different, but it puts in plain view how badly this place fucks up something so simple. And so it reflects badly on its other assets as well.See New York, I know you love to spend money and then to try and justify it by saying how good and grand it all was.

5.0,1/9/2013,"The other reviewers are correct - this is one of the most feminine big-city hotspots I've ever seen. Look at all the chandeliers, curves, and frills! Great job with the decor here - it's sexy, though you wouldn't know it via the odd-but-fun pawn shop entryway (yes, really). This is a perfect place for ""Ladies Who Brunch,"" a demographic clearly evident during the Sunday morning brunch service for which we had reserved a table. Another brainchild of ""Chopped"" judge Chris Santos (also of Stanton Social fame), expect tasty, inventive small plates; though thankfully not so small that they couldn't be easily shared among a party of three.I had too many excellent cocktails during my short stay in New York to wax poetic about any one; at any rate, the specifics of exactly what I imbibed are a bit fuzzy. However, I can say that the cocktails I tried were outstanding - all pleasingly experimental, adhering to a more nouveau cocktail philosophy rather than retro tradition. With the food menu (again, this is brunch I'm referring to), it's difficult to go wrong. We ordered an assortment of plates, starting out with pumpkin scones with cinnamon butter. I'm not a huge fan of scones, because the tendency is to be too crusty - but of course, these struck the perfect balance of just crusty enough on the outside yet soft and warm inside. And that pumpkin was so pure, it tasted like the month of October thrown in a processor and fashioned into a baked good. With the cinnamon butter, I could have greedily mopped the scones up myself.Then, the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings came out. Reminiscent of the Stanton Social's French onion soup dumplings, these were a great idea. Served in ceviche spoon bar-type spoons, they were instant hits, perfect little flavor bombs. In an attempt to order something somewhat healthy and thus balance out our gluttony, we tried the kale and apple salad. It held plenty of texture, with the nice fresh kale and candied pecans, bound together with a bracing acidic vinaigrette.Then came another gut-buster - our order of chilaquiles. If you only order one thing from the brunch menu, do the chilaquiles. It's a hearty mound of pulled chicken with egg, cheese and pickled red onion, nestled among crunchy tortillas. Full of flavor, it's the perfect amount of non-overbearing spiciness, with all the elements in proportion. Service was helpful and accomodating. I can't speak for this place in the evening, but brunch was just about flawless. Value-wise, it's not inexpensive, but split among three, the bill wasn't all that eye-popping, either...and I left satisfied.

4.0,1/8/2013,"I've been here twice now and both times had a fun evening.  The first time was two months ago, as part of a birthday dinner.  I had to come late, so I missed most of the food, but my friends enjoyed it.  That night I also discovered the free pink champagne in the ladies room (yes please!) and I saw Usher!  (He's short.) The second time, I waited in line for a few minutes since I was with two guy friends.  Got in okay, and was able to take a spin around the upstairs.  It's pretty small, and best if you're at a table up there.  I came back down and hung out in front of the bar the rest of the evening, and made some new friends and had too much whiskey.  Always the sign of a good night! I have yet to check out the pawn shop in the front, but I'll be sure to do that next time.",1,2,1,Dione D.,"Atlanta, GA",104,606,455
4.0,1/8/2013,"Came here on a Friday night in January with 2 of my girlfriends, we had a great time. We were seated about a half-hour early for our 10pm res and ordered some cocktails to start. I had the ODB (old dirty bramble) which had tequila, ginger syrup and smoked blackberry. It definitely wasnt short on tequila! For dinner, we ordered the grilled cheese dumplings (delish) yellowtail crudo, eggplant and ricotta crostini, mushroom ravioli, scallops, seared tuna and a side of veggies. The crudo, crostini and tuna (most expensive entree) were all forgettable but the scallops and the ravioli were all up in that umami goodness, OMG still salivating!!! Also the grilled cheese soup dumplings were delectable, add smoky salty porky bacon and now they're just sinfully delicious. Also had the pbnj creme brulee which was oh so yummy (though the macroon on top left much to be desired). Overall it was a great night out. The only con was in order to get to the fabulous champagne bathroom, you had to fight through a PACKED and loud restaurant. Other than that it was a great night with my gals.

The chicken fried oysters were too salty for my taste. The serving size was perfect for us to sample each dish off of without getting too full. We also shared the bread pudding for dessert which was really good as well. The setting was very cute, cozy, and romantic! Our server was very attentive and helpful.

Beet Amuse Bouche - If you love beets like I do, this is definitely a treat!The Decent BitesLobster Mac and Cheese - needed more lobster and cheese, but still pretty tastyGrilled Shrimp - tasty but needed a bit more sauceTuna Poke Wonton Tacos - good, but probably wouldn't need to order it againMini Cupcakes - I tried the chocolate guiness one and it was quite moist, but I probably wouldn't need to order this again eitherThe ForgettablesMushroom Pizzette - kind of bland Beef on Pretzel Bread - a little too roast beefy for meService though was on point and super friendly.

4.0,12/18/2012,"Beauty & Essex is one of those quintessential ""it's who you know more than what you know"" type places. Thankfully, I know the right people that guarantee an amazing night each time I visit. B&E is where I go when I want to feel fancy without having to walk around with a stick up my ass underneath my sexy little black dress. And ladies, while there isn't a dress code for us - trust me, you want to look sexy. For those of you who care, it's not uncommon to find a celebrity of some sort at one of their VIP. For those who don't, there's plenty other reasons to care.What I like even more than the vibe are the drinks. The Earl of Pearl, which tastes like a spiked Arnold Palmer is the best take on it yet. And the Coronado, is one of those ""creeper"" drinks where you can barely taste the tequila, but can definitely feel it after just one. What I like even more than the drinks, is the FOOD. The roasted bone marrow, chicken fried oysters, lobster tacos, grilled cheese and smoked bacon tomato soup dumplings, and black bottom butters cot pot de creme ARE AN ABSOLUTE MUST here. But I'm warning you in advance: the crowd can get a little pretentious, it's a bit pricey, and you may have to wait in line.

The food has never been to rave for, so let's leave that where we all know it is.  Beauty & Essex is a girl's dream.  It's a place that was ""cool"" in NYC for half of 2011 until a boat load of other places around this wonderful city decided to make their debuts.  Needless to say that's ok in NYC because Marquee was still rocking for yearsss after the initial coolness of it.  But, it's just not worth the pricing anymore.Listen, it's a lovely place with some very cool decor, but, there's nothing more to it.  It gets crowded but the crowds are so weird that it misses on creating a heartbeat and vibe for itself on almost any night. I truly recommend coming in the middle of the week, on hump day maybe, or mon-wed for that matter.  You will have a much better time and if you have never been you will enjoy the experience and get to feel cool with the toys from 2010 we left over for you to play with.

I had Earl The Pearl, which was vodka, early grey tea and honey. Unfortunately, my drink was soooo overly sweet. I let my 2 friends tried it and both of them disliked it very much.

This place gets cool points for the pawn shop entrance. It's a very cool and unique concept. Also, once you get pass the door the decor inside is impressive. Beautiful chandelier over a staircase that takes you to a second level where the party is...or so you think. There's not much of a dance floor. You can either sit at the bar (good luck trying to get a seat) or on the couches directly behind it. If not, you're stuck somewhere in between with not much moving space. Awkward set up. Here's my other issue. Why is there such a huge line on weekends? I think lines draw people in, because REALLY you are not missing much. There's no cool party inside people!! It's just a regular bar with mediocre well drinks. If you are not with a private party, you'll probably wait 30 minutes on line for nothing.

If you're planning on using a Gilt certificate, good luck.....it's the biggest pain in the ass EVER?!!! My two friends were using the certificate, but I wasn't.....so they wouldn't let them use it bc everybody at the table has to be using the Gilt menu. Not sure whats up with that. Overall I was underwhelmed......I ordered steak and eggs and there was absolutely nothing impressive about it. One of us got the entree about 20 minutes before everybody else so we had to watch her eat so that her food wouldn't get cold.

5.0,11/18/2012,"I really had no idea what to expect with Beauty & Essex, and my first-take impression was not all that encouraging given I'm not the nightclub type. But once I took a bite of the food here, I was hooked. I only became aware of this place through Chris Santos' regular appearances on that addictive competition series on the Food Network, ""Chopped"". I just had a great dining experience at Scott Conant's Scarpetta in MePa last month when I was in New York, so it was just a matter of time before I tried this place. By happenstance, my good friend Carlos and his partner Jamie had just moved to the Lower East Side this past weekend, so what better way to celebrate their housewarming than taking a stroll to Beauty & Essex.The speakeasy motif is getting to be commonplace these days, and sure enough, what you see first is a thrift shop storefront, granted one bathed in lime-green walls and populated with luxuriant antique jewelry in period display cabinets and pricey guitars hanging on the wall. An imposing doorman allows you entrance into what looks to be a chic, darkened nightclub with even more antique jewelry in display cases. The house music was blaring, and there were so many sharply dressed people in the lounge area that I was wondering if it was a big mistake to be here. We were gratefully seated in the corner booth in the front room, which was well lit and far enough away from the bar for us to feel a bit more relaxed.Almost immediately, we were served a tasty amuse-bouche, a red-beet tapenade scooped onto a crispy chip and topped with a dollop of creme fraiche and chopped scallions (see photo). The menu selections proved daunting since we wanted to share several small plates to maximize the variety of flavors to be experienced. While we were deciding, we ordered their $9 virgin cocktails. Both Carlos and Jamie sipped on the Garnet Gimlet, which blended strawberry, basil, lemon nectar, fresh lime juice and ginger ale into a not-too-sweet concoction served in a martini glass. Mine was the decidedly more tropical Platinum Peacock, which mixed cucumber, granny smith apple, pineapple, and mint into a mojito-looking drink that proved most refreshing even on a most wintry evening (see photos).Our first dish was the $17 Roasted Bone Marrow, two big bones oozing with fatty carnivery that was absurdly decadent in rich meaty flavor. It was accompanied by a rioja-braised shallot marmalade that we smeared generously onto grilled wedges of bread along with the marrow (see photos). The combination was simply sensational and over with far too soon. The second dish was actually six spoonfuls of the $14 Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings, a velvety creation that evokes after-school snacks in a most adult manner (see photo). Again it was digested in a matter of seconds, but it was lovely while it lasted. The third dish was labeled an accessory in the menu, true ballpark fare but done so well as to defy expectation, the $9 stack of Vidalia Onion Ring Tempura.They were like no other onion rings I've ever had and perfectly complemented by the buttermilk-blue cheese dipping sauce (see photo). The $13 trio of Carnitas Pulled Pork Tamales was next (see photo), and Carlos said they were even better than the ones his father makes at home in San Jose. Ladled with a tantalizing mole sauce, the tamales were downright creamy in texture with enough kick to make an impression on our respective tongues. The $16 Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs came next, huge spheres of homestyle goodness slathered with sheep's milk ricotta, wile mushroom and slivers of truffle (see photo). The climax came with the $18 Pan-Toasted Mezze Rigatoni, which was mixed with a hearty sauce of merguez sausage, mint, brown butter and ricotta salata (see photo). Amid stiff competition, that was probably my favorite dish of all.Dessert anyone? The $10 Pumpkin Pie Eclairs were simply to die for as it featured a concord grape sorbet, pumpkin seed brittle and a buzz-worthy cinnamon-caramel sauce (see photo). The $10 Peanut Butter & Jelly Crème Brûlée was an excellent twist on the classic with the jelly oozing underneath the pudding and a raspberry peanut butter macaron thrown in for good measure (see photo). But the best, most abundant meal ender was the $11 Molten Chocolate Bread Pudding, which was quite huge and luscious with a hard crust of chocolate on top to provide a nice contrast to the bread chunks in the bowl. A generous scoop of hazelnut ice cream finished it off (see photo). Speaking of which, we were finished off, too, and quite sated from our culinary indulgence. We just loved the food here.FOOD - 5 stars...new jack American cuisine impeccably executed and bursting with flavors both familiar and unexpectedAMBIANCE - 4 stars...speakeasy quaint gives way to nightclub chicSERVICE - 5 stars...genuinely attentive and alert without being intrusiveTOTAL - 5 stars...surprising in all the best ways possible",11,7,8,Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4521,4629,37977

The atmosphere was dim lit, music was loud and it was a bit dancy. (trendy spots do this i suppose. id suffer that for some  good food.)The menu is set up tapas style so we ordered three dishes: Lobster Mac and Cheese, Mezze Rigatoni accompanied by a lovely tomato sauce with merguez sausage and pressed chicken with a mascarpone polenta and blistered tomatoes. Lobster Mac and Cheese: it was like essence of lobster and the breadcrumbs on top, though tasty was a bit too much. The pasta was cooked properly and it was a nice cheesy-ness to it, but its not what i think lobster mac and cheese would taste like. Both Phil and I were a bit saddened by this. Oh well.Mezze Rigatoni- I devoured this! the sauce was simple yet perfect, the sausage was authentically spiced merguez and the rigatoni wasn't over cooked.Press chicken with polenta and tomatoes- This dish was proper. The chicken was succulent, the skin just fell off and had so much flavor.

As for drinks,  the only cocktail I tried was the Beauty Elixer - gin, strawberry, and rose.  It was AWESOME (at least for those among us that like girly, fruity drinks).  And prices are standard ($14) for your average cocktail.  As for atmosphere, Beauty & Essex did a great job of creating a space that feels somewhat intimate, somewhat classy, and somewhat sexy.  No other way to describe it.  Even though the place is multi-leveled (one floor is more for dining, and the upstairs has a large space with a bar), this place wasn't overwhelming, like many larger establishments in NYC feel.

It's a beautiful gem in the gritty location of lower east side.Music is ON POINT. Trap night upstairs which had me happy dancing all night. Drinks are steep but strong, bathrooms are out of this world gorgeous. Felt like I was in Vegas.  There was a small bar with a lady handing out champagne glasses IN THE BATHROOM.

I ordered a pre-drink cocktail (strawberry martini) which was awesome; the waiter was very helpful and gave us recommendations. I loved the beef carpaccio, the jewels on toast were great as well. My favorite 'tapa' was the grilled cheese and tomato dumplings, which you can get with or without bacon. It was amazing! I also let the restaurant know that it was my mom's birthday, and they brought her a cupcake with candle- nice touch!

We got the menu and everything looked delicious so we were really disappointed when the waiter told us that we could only pick 1 item from each of the 4 sections for the entire table (we had 3 vouchers, 1 per 2 people so we assumed each pair would get to choose). I have to say that was really annoying and definitely not a good way to start, especially as it mentioned that no where on the vouchers or on the menu and after reading other reviews it does not seem to always be the case. Definite points off there.Our waiter was entertaining, but in the same way as a drunk guy at the bar towards the end of the night that is walking a fine line between charming and useless. He definitely erred on the side of useless but I think because he was so lazy we ended up accidentally getting extra champagne because we poured a round for ourselves when he was nowhere in sight and we were all empty. Turned out I don't think it was our bottle. Oops!The food was ok. All very small portions except the dessert which was inexplicably large compared to everything else (I guess they figured they would get lots of complaints about not enough food so they stuff you at the end). red velvet waffles- pretty dry and not enough of the icing on top to actually be reminiscent of red velvet caketomato soup bites- these very actually pretty clever little bites that did remind me of grilled cheese and tomato soup, yumfried chicken biscuits- these were just ok.

4.0,10/13/2012,"Over the past few years, my friends and I have had a love hate relationship with LES. There's a combination of the grungy/ dirty, casual/ trendy bars/ clubs in the area which is part of the allure that is LES. After hearing so many good things about Beauty & Essex, I am surprised myself that I have never been here.During my friend Feng's (Feng H. if you wanna add him on Yelp) and my little LES bucket list outing (we tried to hit up as many places as possible on a Thursday night)... we were having a tough time finding a good spot to stay. This led to us roaming around Essex and it finally dawned on Feng that I have never been to Beauty & Essex. We get to the front, it looks like some crazy vintage jewelry / odds and ends store with  random stuff for sale. You look at your watch and realize it's wayyyy past time for any stores to be selling anything. You walk inside the shop, there is no password or reservation needed to head to the bar. The bouncer was a really friendly woman. After she denies or grants you access into this bar, a fake door opens up and you see a staircase to your left, and a bar/ dining area to the front. It is a really sleek and beautiful bar (and very clean for LES). We decided to go upstairs and there is louder music playing and a crowded bar. We stuck around for a little, but what keeps this from being 5 stars is that there really isn't a dance floor and there isn't much space in general to encourage people to go there other than to just sit at the bar or go eat. The music was realllyyy good, they just need a little more space either at the bar or have an area to dance to just encourage interaction.  Or, maybe if there is more space to get a drink?  I definitely want to come back and give this place another chance- I really want to try dinner here sometime! Overall, really nice place. I want to see what it's like on other nights as well! I also hope to be there on one of the lucky nights when they serve champagne in the lady's room!",1,1,1,Erin M.,"Manhattan, NY",1318,563,412

3.0,10/9/2012,"Visited Beauty & Essex on a during a business trip with six of my colleagues. The front of restaurant is quite unique as you enter through a kitschy pawn shop, past a rather large doorman/bouncer to a dark and glam entryway/bar. The ambiance is quite cool, dim lighting, dark rich colored furniture and decor. We had a reservation and upon our party's arrival were whisked upstairs and seated at a nice large round table in the center of one of their dining rooms. Honestly, the place is not ideal if you're interested in talking to anyone in your group. The music was incredibly loud and I had to raise my voice just to talk to someone seated next to me! For the size of our group our server suggested we chose 6-8 dishes and they would serve them up ""tapas"" style with a serving of each selection for everyone in the party. Loved this idea and it was perfect! We all selected something that looked good and we all got to try a little bit of everything. Here's what we tried:Tomato Tartare- (One Crostini per person) served on a parmesan crostini with a tomato ""tartare"" and a sunnyside up quail egg. I was a little leery of the quail egg, but it's soft, buttery texture was perfect with the savory tomato tartare and crusty salty crostini. Kobe Beef Carpaccio- Super thin slices of Kobe Beef served atop an arugula salad and dressed with a light oil dressing. Simple, fresh and savory!Kale & Apple Salad- I'm not normally a fan of raw kale since it's a too tough and dense, but for this salad, it was sliced thin with tangy apple strips, pancetta and light apple cider vinaigrette. Very refreshing.Lobster Tacos- (One Taco per person) Mini 2-3 bite taco with beer battered lobster, cabbage slow and a slightly peppery cream sauce. As long as the lobster is fresh, can this really be bad? It was fresh and it was good.Vidalia Onion Rings- Tempura battered sweet onion rings. Pretty standard, fried sweet oniony goodnessBasil Pesto Ravioli- (One large ravioli per person) Cheese filled ravioli in a basil, pesto, brown butter sauce. Nice large ravioli, creamy filling, nice fresh rich sauce. Pan Roasted Scallops- (One large scallop per person) Perfectly seared scallops served atop a yummy, creamy corn risotto. This was my pick and it was a winner :)Grilled Salmon- (Approx. 1 oz per person?- It was about 3 bites) Grilled salmon with a sherry glaze served on top of couscous. I didn't care for the couscous, but the salmon was good- tender and flaky beneath the sweet, tangy glaze.After our merry-go-round of entrees, we of course had to try desserts!Molten Chocolate Bread Pudding- My choice..YUM!! Rich, warm, decadent and moist chocolately bread pudding. Love that this is served warm with a gooey center. So good!Devils Food Layer Cake- Moist chocolate cake with a mascarpone filling. I liked the mascarpone filling instead of the standard whipped cream or buttercream filling...it was a nice, savory twist. Bourbon Vanilla Ice Cream- A rich vanilla ice cream with bourbon infused flavor. Nice combo and it was a good compliment to the other chocolate desserts.Overall a good dining experience. The service was prompt and efficient. Food came out timely and hot. Again, the music was blaring so it was hard to have a conversation with anyone, let alone the server. I'm surprised she could hear our orders. BUT she did and got them right! Last, there was the bathroom, while nicely decorated, it was a mess even though there is a bathroom attendant. My stall barely had enough toilet paper and had trash on the floor, the waste basket where you washed your hands was overfilling  and the sinks were soaked. But I guess when you're too busy texting, it's hard to think about doing your job and clean. The irony, she actually had a tip jar. Crazy. Though if I were stuck down there I'd be pretty bitter too...but still a job is a job, they're paying you to do it, so do it. Despite the bathroom, I would return.

The entrance is threw some pawn shop that I can't really tell you anything about, and I'm not sure why people are obsessed with it. When you enter and get passed the bitchy hostesses, the atmosphere is a lot of young people, the girl's bathroom has champagne and the music during the entire dinner was awesome. It was hip-hoppy circa 2003 and evoked some great memories from my high school years. Our server was very nice, attentive, and kept the drinks coming. We ordered more than we could eat, which is surprising because the dishes are small tapas style so order as you go! Don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach, especially for a $15 plate with 3 pieces of bread on it. There is a club upstairs that we chose to skip, but I will definitely go back to this place.

Even some of the dishes that I was hesitant to order because I feared they would be boring (like the spaghettini) turned out to be amazing. The spaghettini was spicy and well-flavored and although the pasta itself probably wouldn't compare to the best Italian restaurants I've dined at I enjoyed this dish as much as I have nearly any other pasta dish (and better than places that people consider excellent Italian places). The other experience at Beauty & Essex is the ambiance. This place is a scene! Let me preface this by saying I don't live in NYC. If I were Beauty & Essex were in my hometown I think I'd find this place overwhelming, pounding music, crowded rooms, and a dance club atmosphere. But in New York, it just kinda makes sense in a weird sort of way. We were in the upstairs dining area and I'll have to say a walk through of the downstairs appeared a little more subdued but don't come to Beauty & Essex expecting to have a thoughtful and poignant conversation with your date.

Our experience wasn't as bad as some of my fellow yelpers but it certainly wasn't as good as we had hoped.The ""Pawn Shop"" in the front was cute and gimmicky. Gave the restaurant a speakeasy exclusive feel. When we entered the restaurant itself, we were shocked by it's size - ENORMOUS!! We were greeted by a hostess and waitresses in skin tight short dresses who were extremely friendly and accommodating.We were led to a table that had couples on either side of us who looked just as out of place as we did - we were all looking for a sophisticated fun night out but ended up watching very young and hip people trying too hard to look, well young and hip.

4.0,9/19/2012,"It was ""go big or go home"" Wednesday at Beauty and Essex and we ordered a ton.  I've been here for drinks but have never tried the food although I'd heard amazing things.We started with the sashimi of tuna (Tonnato Style) with lemon zested olive oil, crunchy chorizo and sea salt which was good but not particularly memorable (you are about to see a theme here).These were probably the second best things we had - bruschetta essentially.  We tried the whipped ricotta with roasted pumpkin, crispy sage, pumpkin seed oil and fig balsamic and the avocado, lemon and espelette.  The ricotta was delicious and the bread was nicely toasted (I like my toast a little burnt) but the pumpkin didn't really add much.  The avocado one just tasted like avocado paste.  Both had the beginnings of being really good but were missing that extra layer of taste.These were my two favorite items - the charred shishito peppers and the grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings.  The peppers were piping hot in a nice sauce and the dumplings slid right off the spoon and were a mixture of amazing flavors that almost tasted like mac n' cheese as opposed to grilled cheese.  I think I stole about three of these...While it was a beautiful presentation and all of meat, the heritage baby back ribs (Cuban style) with guava glaze and pickled green papaya slaw were also kind of tasteless.  It's so weird how all the dishes are beautiful but don't have much flavor.  So strange.  The papaya slaw was actually the most flavorful part!Last and probably least were the oven braised chicken meatballs with sheeps milk ricotta and wild mushroom truffle.  As we know I'm not a huge fan of mushroom and now I'm not a huge fan of chicken meatballs.  The ricotta was the only winning part of this - some of the best cheese I've had... wonder where they buy it from.My overall impression was the venue is really cool and our waitress was AWESOME (super sassy) but the food was like a top model - beautiful to look at with not much to keep you around.  I'll be back from drinks but probably not for dinner.",3,0,0,Laura H.,"Sydney, Australia",412,394,3
2.0,9/18/2012,"Unfortunately since my first visit in December 2010, this place has gone further down than Lindsay Lohan's career. When I first visited for dinner then, I was allured by the amazing range of shareable and even affordable dishes (RIP grilled apple pizzetta with bacon and truffle oil and baby back ribs with tempura onion rings - both under $20 at the time) and didn't mind shelling out $15+ for creatively addictive cocktails like the Sour Blush or a sophisticated Manhattan. However, for dinner, the menu has continued to change with many of these more popular items (based on observing what everyone around me was ordering) being removed from the menu and replaced with smaller portions at higher prices that are just not as tasty - probably with the goal to make more $$$ per table.DINNER  - For dinner, this place can still impress your out of town guests given its true scene-y vibe. It's fun to walk past the line on a weekend night when you have a dinner reservation and fight through the bar crowd to feel civilized again once you arrive at your table, where you dance in your chair to loud pop remixes and occasionally see a celebrity (or someone dressed to impress like one) sashay past your table. You probably score another point when you instruct your female friends to head downstairs for the bathroom for a complimentary glass of pink champagne. You even can wow them by telling them which of the complex cocktails are the most delicious or request the bartender makes something special that night. However, that's where the fun ends. The servers over the past 10 or so visits have continuously encouraged each person at my table to order a mininum of three plates each, which originally was too much food during my earlier visits, but due to cost cutting over time has now become more do-able. Still, I'd recommend subbing one of the three plates as a side item though since many of the tapas are incredibly small even compared to Stanton Social. BRUNCH - The meal that's gone downhill the most dramatically is brunch. I recall a Gilt City deal that allowed us to get unlimited mimosas with four courses that were absolutely divine. However, the most recent ""deal"" that limited us to two bottles of warm Chandon left more than just our stomachs sour. The servers have become increasingly more bitter - not sure if it's the lower quality crowd (i.e. crazy tourists with luggage or just B&T who find it too difficult to trek into the city late at night. Now, the whole table must agree on one item even though we could have easily been two or three tables since we have multiple vouchers to redeem. And once we aligned, the eggs benedict with serrano ham, the fried chicken bites and lobster chorizo hash did not disappoint as usual (though the presentation was a bit sloppier), but the long gap between courses left us very hungry.(Tomato soup/grilled cheese dumplings while delicious can only hold you over for so long.) With hardly an apology or any type of make good from the waitress after airing our concerns for waiting an HOUR between courses, it's hard to justify why we still had to pay the mandatory 20% tip. There are far better brunch places that will offer you good drinks and better quality food (the Smith, Zoe, heck, even Essex)OVERALL - The only reason I am not giving B+E 1 star is that I would still highly recommend coming here for weekday night drinks after dinner in the LES (perhaps before a burlesque show at Nurse Bettie's or after $18 Wednesday Night lobster at nearby Essex) or for a lively date/stop over between bars. But you will rarely find me investing in this joint for food much longer due to your sassy servers. It was a good run though! see you at Zoe for brunch and the Dutch for dinner! xoxo",4,2,2,John H.,"Manhattan, NY",64,22,4

My wine glass never had a chance to be empty and the food was lip smacking goodness. Truffle meatballs, lobster tacos, empanadas, fried ricotta, huge shrimp, etc. All superb.

I recommend the Chicken Fried Oysters, the Chile Relleno Empanadas, Oven Braised Meatballs, Brick Chicken and best of all THE WHIPPED RICOTTA.  This is an amazing slice of heaven --- Roasted Peaches with thai chile, basil, honey and ricotta on a crustini.  We liked this dish so much, we ordered two!This place would be great for a girl's night out, but I would not recommend for a business dinner - unless you don't need to talk about much because this place is loud.

2.0,8/22/2012,"I've been meaning to get around to writing this review & feel that it's very important that I do. I came here for my birthday back in June with 8 friends. We set a reservation far in advance and showed up on time. We were seated shortly after arriving to a great table right in the middle of it all. Coming to a place like this - we came out expecting to spend money and were hoping for a unique and better than normal experience. When we ordered, the waitress tried to get us to double our order for EVERY item. We declined and placed our order, only to have doubles of every plate brought to our table. We had the extra plates (that were not needed as we had ordered plenty) removed from the table, completely untouched, by the waitress who was aware that we did not want those plates. The waitress continued to make comments like ""well don't you want more?"" or ""I don't think that is enough"" despite the fact that we were not soliciting her advice. We ended up having a great night together and enjoying the meal, we tried a variety of things all of which were really good (especially the mini lobster rolls). When it came time to get the check, the waitress brought it to me and said ""Don't worry, we removed all the extras off the bill, so if you just want to give me a card, I'll go charge it"" clearly trying to avoid having me review the bill. After declining her offer and reviewing the bill, 4 things were not taken of the menu that we had not ordered or eaten. I called over the waitress who was very flustered/rude/annoyed by me for even inquiring. She grabbed the bill out of my hand and said ""Fine its fine we'll take it off"" before I could even say a word to her. Even though the food was good, the service was bad and for that reason, I think this place is highly over-rated and I can find something just as trendy and delicious elsewhere. My expectations for this place (that has a seemingly positive reputation) were much higher. It's a shame because the food was pretty decent.",0,0,0,Julia G.,"Manhattan, NY",2,47,1

Great if your on a diet.  I needed 3 ravioli orders to get full.  The ambiance is excellent.  Now for the bad.  They say they have bottled water and they charge you for it but it's filtered tap water.  They should not charge for something like that because the piping in those buildings are so old and filled with lead they have to use filtered water.  This is one thing that will keep me from coming back.  If you have high blood pressure stay far far away.  After about 30 mins after leaving I was so bloated and thirsty I must have had 1 gallon of water.  They put an insane amount of salt in their food it should be illegal.For dessert I had the box of donuts, what a joke.  It was 5 munchkins, like the ones front dunking donuts.In closing:  we had great company which made this dining experience wonderful.

The two hostesses looked at one another and snickered and told us we'd just have to wait. No thank you. We said we would finish our drinks but we werent going to stay to eat. When they heard that they just rolled their eyes and whispered about us to one another like we were in high school.

5.0,8/21/2012,"I can't even explain how much I love this place. In early May I came back to the city for a business trip and on a free night I went here with a friend and one of her girlfriend's who highly recommended this place. We were so confused going in the front entrance and were completely shocked by what was behind that antique door. Beauty & Essex paints the perfect picture of what New York City really is at heart-- dirty and gritty on the outside but completely gorgeous, decadent, and fun on the inside. We were immediately taken to our table since we had a previous reservation. We were given the beet-yogurt amuse bouche, complimentary of the chef, and immediately, we were in love. We, of course, ordered the roasted bone marrow, kobe beef carpaccio, lobster tacos, and chipolte shrimp. Everything was nothing less than perfection. I'm not the most adventurous eater, but I guess ""when in Rome"" and what not. I absolutely fell in love with B&E's bone marrow. It was such a culinary experience. I honestly have nothing bad to say about this place. A few nights later, our friends begged us to bring them here because we couldn't stop raving about it. On that occasion, we were given the chef's complimentary appetizer once more, and ordered the bone marrow, beef carpaccio, east coast oysters, grilled cheese smoked bacon + tomato soup dumplings, and the spaghettini.(Two things we realized New York does better than our native California-- east coast oysters and bone marrow. I have validated this more than once since I've been home.) Once more, nothing less than the exceptional dining experience. My original friend and I even spent the rest of the night upstairs in the lounge until close.

Our food came fast every time, the waitress was helpful and friendly, and everyone who worked there was on top of their game! Then again, I came on a Wednesday evening...so it might not apply to the weekends. But they cleared the tables and came with new food so fast, I'd like to think they're still on top of their game during the weekends.Here's what we ordered (and its corresponding score):Chicken Meatballs: 4/5. These meatballs are pretty big! They're delicious, but not my favorite if the bunch.Lobster mac and cheese: 6/5. Yes, I said 6 out of 5. This place is known for their mac and cheese, and for good reasons too! If you had to order one thing, this is the dish.Tomato Soup Dumplings: 5/5. They come out with 6 of these on spoons. The flavors of this is sooooo delicious that you'll scavenge for more of its tasty goodness!Chicken Fried Oysters: 4/5. They only came out with 3 of these...which is fine. But compare them to the tomato soup dumplings (which the waiters brought these 2 dishes out together), I was more in love with the tomato soup dumplings. But the chicken fried oysters were crunchy and full of good flavor too.Asian Ribs: 5/5. YUM!!! I love how they serve their ribs in big portions too! Recommended if you have a large group. The glazing is so delicious on these too!I had such an amazing time here. Be prepared to try new things and leave with your stomach happy. My friend and I appreciated that we were brought these cute mini-bruchetta treats (except it was on a tiny tortilla). It's nice to get a taste of what's to come!Also, the bathrooms are really nice!

It comes with 6 spoons though, so it's a good dish to share.My husband and I split the ribs and scallops for our entrees, and both were delish. I am partial to scallops and often order them, but these were three very plump and perfectly seasoned scallops and the tomato and corn on the side was a perfect accent to the dish. The ribs were really good too and a good portion size, but they were a little too ""cooked"" for my liking.We started with a couple cocktails from the menu, which we both really enjoyed as well.  The decor is really neat too, everything is decked out in jewels from the entryway to the chandeliers.All in all, a fun place for a night out on the town, but if you want a peaceful place for date night or to just speak to your waiter without having to yell, this is not it :)",0,0,0,Kelly O.,"Atlanta, GA",87,141,0

Dinner: the food was amazing!!!! This place serves everything tapas style so we just got a bunch of things to share: Recommendation: steak tar tar, bone marrow (comes with a side of delicious caramelized onion) the salad with apples pecans and goat cheese (can't remember what this one was called)For dessert: the donuts filled with hazelnut cream and jam!!! They re to die for and they come warm absolutely deliciousThe service wasn't great, our waiter seemed new and was not really friendly and he barely understood my request to bring a candle out for my friends birthday. He also forgot one of our orders and we had to remind him.Bar/clubThe music in this place was great, and people were dancing... So if you like to dance this is a good spot!  but as the night went on the doorman let in too many people and they were over capacity so they started kicking people out and it was a mob.

I went with my food loving girlfriends and boy did we overdo it this time. But it was all worth it. I never say no to bone marrow and it did not disappoint, it was buttery goodness. The barrata toast was good as was the tomato soup dumplings, very flavorful. Now I don't know if I was already getting full at this point but I was not impressed with the lobster Mac and cheese or the garganelli sadly. But the beauty and Essex burger, wow. Was not expecting that to be a highlight. I wish I had paid more attention when my friend asked what was in it, I think it was a combo of lamb, pulled pork and steak? Definitely one of the best burgers I've had, the crispy bbq fries it comes with was equally good. Almost forgot about the scallops, perfectly cooked and they each sat on a little bed of risotto, delicious. In hindsight I wish I wasn't so stuffed so I could savor everything but I know what I liked. Clearly we have eyes bigger than our stomachs, we were planning to get 2-3 desserts but in the end only had room for 1, which was the butterscotch pot de creme, wasn't a fan of the actual butterscotch bottom, but everything in the middle and above was so good! There's a nice, spacious lounge area up the spiral staircase that would be good for girls nights out or get togethers. Very cute that they do sell things out front, I believe they're all pre-owned but some have never been worn or look brand new!

4.0,7/16/2012,"Been here twice. Once for my bestie's birthday and once for a girls' night out. Both experiences were equally amazing. This place is best if you come out as a group since all the plates are sharing plates. The space itself is very posh, high ceilings, nice furniture, chandeliers, dim lighting...like a castle. But the best part- amazing soul-ful, funky music (mostly Hip Hop and R n B). Love that! There is free champagne in the ladies' room so hey- no complaints about that. I am totally serious when I say this- everything that comes out of their kitchen is amazing. So flavorful. they are very nice about accommodating special requests: We were two vegans at the table, and the chef immediately brought out amazing all vegan appetizers, salads, main courses and even desserts! Gotta appreciate this kind of service! The drinks are strong and very well put together. Their specialty cocktails change but they are always fresh and tasty.

Awesome!The downstairs restaurant is gorgeous and comfortable. The bathroom is darling, with free champagne and lounge chairs/sofas for 'girl talk'.

4.0,7/10/2012,"Having fallen in love with Stanton Social, I decided to take a trip over to Beauty and Essex. We started the meal with some tuna poke tacos, which reminded my sister of the awesome poke she had in Hawaii. Following the wonton tacos was a gorgeous oven roasted bone marrow. Top if with some micro-cilantro salad and a little onion chutney, and wah lah... a super delicious crostini. We went on to try a good portion of the menu, including the burger which was outrageously good. Prime rib and lamb in a burger patty with a garlic aioli... What's not to love? However, the shining star of the night had to be the scallops. Seared to perfection, the gems sit on a bed of super creamy corn risotto. The braised chicken meatball were succulent and soft, topped with fresh ricotta, it sits in a bowl of jous. Yum! The spaghettini was a very refreshing dish, though I wish the sunny side egg on top came a bit runnier. The fresh parsley pesto went super well with the lemon, and the zucchinis gave the dish a bit of a crunch.The relleno empanadas were also nice, and surprisingly light. Like the empanadas, the chicken fried oysters felt very light. With a super crispy outside, the oysters were creamy and sweet. It was a delightful spoonful of yummy goodness.The pulled pork tamales were a big hit at the table as the texture of the tamale itself was spot on! We also tried the grilled cheese tomato soup dumplings, but had all agreed that the French onion soup dumplings at Stanton Social takes the ball in terms of ""soup dumpling"" wise. When you do go, please make sure you save a bit of room for the devil's food cake. Layered with vanilla mascarpone and covered in a thin layer of shiny ganache, the cake is paired up with an awesome milk ice cream, which tones down some of the sweetness of the cake. It is... The best chocolate cake I've had in a long time!Overall, the food was great and I'll definitely go back, but the only thing that fell short for me was the lobster Mac and cheese.

4.0,6/4/2012,"Scrumptious!  An aroma of flavors!!!The most surprising ""thing"" for me about Beauty & Essex was the Pawn Shop exterior.  I nearly walked past the place.  Once you're inside, it is GORGEOUS.  There is a spiral staircase behind the hostess station located across from the bar.  Boy, was I ready to sit at the bar (gorgeous people working) and excited to come here for Sunday Brunch.There are so many clever items on the menu it was difficult to choose.  We decided on the fried chicken biscuits with red-cabbage slaw; poached eggs over short-ribs (I think) and black beans; and my midwestern friend ordered a cheesburger! I wanted to try the chilaquilles!  But, next time!  For desert, I had the butterscotch pot du creme.  Holy Moly!  It was was of the most delicious things EVER to grace my tongue. YUMMY!I was fortunate to get-in as the early reservation I'd made online was NOT in their system.  Kooky?!  But they were gracious enough to accomodate a party of two at 12:30pm.  I LOVED the atmosphere (with skylight and chained chandeliers); I LOVED the cusine (inventive and flavorful); yet, the restaurant looses one STAR due to the ""snooty and dismissive"" staff.   The girls at the hostess station were having a personal conversation and ignored me a bit as I waited for their chat to end.  There was a point when I could not find my waiter to ask for the check. And, I wanted to buy a pair of earrings in the ""Pawn Shop"" entryway, but the employees couldn't find the keys to open the glass case! Rediculous. Two girls working there basically said, ""we don't have keys, sorry."" So I asked who did? They replied, ""the manager.""  Where is she? ""I don't know.""  REDICULOUS.  What are they paid to do? Talk, I guess.  I heard the entire conversation.  It was about whether it is better lifestyle in San Diego or Brooklyn.  Yep.  The FOOD and ATMOSPHERE made up for the loopy staff.  Oh yes, the bartenders were the exception to the rule -- fast, kind and suggested the loveliest concoction which I savored into my meal.Enjoy!",0,0,0,Jill D.,"Los Angeles, CA",28,244,834

The surprise when they swing open the door is tantalizing, and the layout of the restaurant - much like a railroad apartment - makes you feel like you're on a catwalk as you walk to your table. We were all the way in the back, but I do want to come back and chill in the lounge area which looks gorgeous. We had a special prix-fixe menu that let us sample a lot of food, and everything was delicious! We had beet carpaccio on papadums, empanadas, bruscetta, mushroom flatbread, grilled asparagus, brick pressed chicken on polenta (the best thing all night!! I want to drown myself in that polenta), and steak. The steak was surprisingly my least favorite - although very tender and perfectly cooked, it was a bit too salty (brined?) for me. Dessert was a selection of ice cream mini-bombes and MINIATURE CUPCAKES, the star being the red velvet. Service was on-point: friendly, unobtrusive and yet responsive when needbe.Cocktails are imaginative and delicious - I wanted the Woodford Wilson, but they weren't making them that night. I had the Earl the Pearl, which was delightful, and a spicy one that doesn't appear to be on the menu anymore. The spicy one made me regret ordering it at first, but it was so spicy I just wanted to drink more and more of it, like a really good vindaloo that you know you'll pay for in the morning.It's definitely a ""scene"", but don't let that keep you away.

4.0,5/21/2012,"3.5 stars. The girlies - or ""ladies who lunch"" as they would be called at Beauty & Essex - and I had brunch here for my Birthday. I love the pawn shop entrance and fancy decor. I also really like the bar/ waiting area with couches and newspapers (kind of makes you think you'd come and hang out with a coffee and the times), even if they did make us wait 30 min after we were told there was absolutely nooooo way we could push back our resie... Yes, the place is a bit pretentious, but I'm pretty sure that comes with the territory. We were seated in the large dinning room in a sexy leather booth. The room has a great sky light, which on this particular day had the sunshine streaming in (I would have been pissed if we were stuck in the gloomier dark room on this lovely day). Anywho... our particular waiter was great, but service as a whole was lacking a bit. We had a Gilt City coupon for the ""Saturday Brunch"" which comes with a bottle of Champagne... Yay Bubbles! We got our choice on 4 different categories and everything comes for the table to be shared. To start we had the lemon blackberry pancakes and the cornbread waffles. The waffles were a bit dry and I preferred the pancakes. The we had the kale and apple salad, which was so crisp and refreshing, and the tomato soup bites which were quite tasty as well. The next bites that came out were my favorite - the braised short rib huevos rancheros was excellent as was the fried chicken biscuit bites. The sides we choose were the roasted corn with cilantro and the lobster chorizo hash, both were good but the chorizo is so overpowering in the hash you cannot really taste any lobster. For dessert we had the molten chocolate bread pudding, which was rich and decadent. The food was all tasty, but nothing oh my god out of this world. It's the type of place you come for a celebration as it's better for a group, pricey, and not a place to be rushed. Our brunch was lovely, but this certainly isn't a place I'd come rushing back to again. I would like to come back for drinks sometime, especially on a dressy night as the ambiance is perfect for that.

Each dish was tweaked so that there were 8 pieces - perfect! Loved the bone marrow, tacos, and mac n cheese. Pot pie was rich and filling. Skip the meatballs.

We chose: Eggs Benedict: Nice sized poached eggs, drizzled with hollandaise and served on a slice of Serrano ham and baguette. I also detected truffles! Grilled Cheese, Smoke Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings: It kinda tasted like generic potato soup in a mini breadbowl on tomato soup. I get why people say it tastes like generic grocery store stuff. But it's in the best way. Fried Chicken Biscuit Bites: The honey spicey butter they serve this with, which I initially thought was an aioli or something, is phenomenal. I wanted to drink it. The fried chicken could be a  bit more crispy/ battered, but the biscuits were perfectly buttery-doughy-flakey. Lobster & Chorizo Hash: I couldn't figure out what the black cubes were... but they were the potatoes. I think they use blue potatoes or something? Small chunks of lobster and smaller chunks of chorizo. I thought this could have been a bit meatier. Chocolate Bread Pudding: Forgettable. The hazelnut icecream tasted no different than vanilla. The portion was kind of oversized, if you're into that kind of thing.We went for brunch on a Saturday and it was busy but not too busy. There were more women than men but not as much as I expected. The attire... was interesting. Some people were dressed like they were going out to a club. But most were dressed in normal brunch attire, so jeans. They also dress the servers in terribly unforgiving tight, short dresses, which made me feel bad for them. They looked somewhat uncomfortable. The service was pretty good. The server was attentive, and they bussed our table super fast (which could be a pro or a con, in my opinion). I did not go to the famed ladies room for the champagne.

4.0,4/25/2012,"I had been dying to try Beauty & Essex for months since I am a huge fan of Chris Santos. I love his approach to cuisine and the fusion blends he creates. A pal and I decided to have brunch after hearing recommendations from other female friends to come here. Below is my review:1) Ambiance: This place takes the cake with the ambiance. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful! It has high ceilings, dark hues with the sky light that lets light in to the middle of the main floor, and decorous chandeliers on high ceilings. The opulence and the theme of the restaurant is quite unlike anything I have ever seen. I love the fact that the facade of the restaurant is a a 1940's pawn shop! My only complaint is that this type of ambiance isn't really useful to attract men to the restaurant. Indeed about 90% of Beauty & Essex's clientele for brunch that day was about 90% female.  I think its a great place for a brunch or dinner with the gals. 2) The ServiceThe service was Fabulous. No complaints. Our waitress was super nice, didn't rush us, and was at our service. 3) The FoodWe shared 5 courses between 2 people as Chris Santos is known for small plates that are meant to be shared. First Course: Blueberry and Lemon Pancakes - These were so fresh and buttery. You can tell its a home made batter  that whips the egg whites seperately and then adds it to the batter because it was buttery but light.  The lemon was very distinguishable. They were delicious.Second Course: Pizzetta -WOW I was so amazed that ingredients such as cheese and olives could be so refreshingly tasteful. Third Course: Chicken Biscuit Bites - In order to enjoy these you have to cute through the whole biscuit with the chicken and the cabbage in one bite. I ate the chicken alone and it reminded me of Mc Donald's chicken Mc Nuggets but I could tell the chicken was fresh from the color. Once I took a whole bite, the cabbage adds the salt and really brings out the flavor of the spicy butter and the chicken. Overall, these were good.Forth Course: Lobster and Chorizo Potato Hash - The flavor was spot on. I would have liked more Chorizo though.Firth Course: Ice Cream and Pot de CremeI wasn't thrilled with the homemade ice cream, but the butterscotch pot de creme was the highlight of my meal. It was light, airy, rich in flavor, and absolutely amazing!!",1,0,1,Chamila B.,"Bronx, NY",29,8,0

There was no chance of us gettng a table without a reservation until 11 but we got lucky and 2 seats at the bar opened up. I wasn't too impressed. I'm not sure if that's because we weren't at a table. I thought the bartenders seemed very unwilling to serve you at the bar. Having just come from the Mulberry Project where the service was excellent this led to some disappointment. I ordered Spaghettini for dinner. It was ok. I thought the lemon was too much.

They were so impressed with the decor, the service, and the delicious food that one of them promised me that he is going to join Yelp just to write a 5 star review of your restaurant in Italian when he returns to Italy. I was quite happy already when we scored a nice table downstairs (Downstairs is definitely cooler than upstairs) but that was just the beginning. The surprise started when all 9 of us received a delicious empanada as a part of the complimentary dish, followed by yet more scrumptious complimentary dish consisting flatbread topped with ham and poached egg. To top it all off, we were offered 4 different amazing desserts all on the house!!!! I bet you could imagine us flipping out with joy that we got free desserts which were all quite delicious, especially ""Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot De Crème"", that was our favorite out all of 4 that we've tried, followed by ""Molten Chocolate Bread Pudding"" which was served with hazel nut ice cream. However, the amazing service didn't end here.... Now here's the jaw-dropping part of the whole brunch:Everything was on the house!!!!! I'm not kidding, it's true! Yes, I know, how lucky can I get??? When the restaurant contacted me to invite me for another brunch on the house, I already happened to have a reservation the following day. Despite my previous experience, I couldn't think of other cooler brunch place to impress my friends so I was planning to take them there anyway. Luckily the offer came at the right time, so I replied that I'd be more than happy to accept the offer but since we are 9 of us, I mentioned I'd be happy if I get 1 person meal free. Seriously, that's all I expected at first. I had absolutely no idea that the restaurant would make such an incredibly generous offer!!! This is by far the best customer service I've ever received at any restaurant besides my dear Chef friend Didier's restaurants. It is definitely not my intention to  encourage other Yelpers to make complaints just to get free meals. I really think I just happened to be one lucky customer whom the restaurant decided to invite back after some careful considerations..... I doubt they make such offer to just any complainers so don't bother trying what I did. The good news for the restaurant is, I've brought 5 potential new returning guests who had never been there. The rest of the friends were already familiar with the place because I've brought them there 3 times and they all happened to be with me at the last disappointing visit. But obviously all of us left the restaurant very happy and we left some generous tip to show our appreciation for the top notch brunch. Maybe when Tiziano writes his first Italian Yelp review, it might bring more new European customers too!Kudos to Beauty & Essex!!!!

3.0,4/3/2012,"In China, there is a saying: ""eating for the ambiance."" Beauty & Essex is a perfect example of this phrase. A couple friends and I came here for brunch last week and I must say, I was impressed by everything except for the food. The interior of the restaurant is the perfect setting for an all girls dream lunch - the space was filled crystal chandeliers, peacock feather and gold flowers. Also, the service really tries to pamper you and cater to your needs. However, the quality of the food was somewhat to be desired. We ordered the four cheese fondue, the braised chicken meatballs with sheep's milk ricotta, the avocado espelette toast and the tomato soup dumplings. While there was nothing overwhelmingly bad about our dishes, each dish had a textural problem that made it less appetizing. Specifically, the avocado on top of the toast was rather dry; the chicken meatballs were mealy, the fondue was slightly gritty; and our soup dumplings were rather rubbery. To add further insult to injury, my friend noted that all of the dishes we ordered were essentially overpriced, ""fancy"" versions of hors d'ouvers that we can easily make at home. The one saving grace of our meal was the chocolate molten bread pudding we ordered to end our meal. The hot dessert was topped with a very generous scoop of delicious hazelnut ice cream that was separated by a crunchy, bitter cocoa nib shell. It was amazing -  the cold smooth quality of the ice cream was a perfect complement to the warm, nutty, cinnamon and chocolate laden bread pudding. The shell in between the two larger components also added a necessary crunch, bitterness and temperature separation. Best of all, the pudding was big enough for three people to eat!Honestly, I think I'll come back just for dessert in the future. Yuhe's Suggestions:- Boys, this place may not be for you. The clientele was about 95% posh girls on the day that I went (I was slightly uncomfortable...). Girls, if you want to go, call up a few friends and spare your boyfriends the frou frou decor and tiny plates.- Please skip the grilled cheese soup dumplings. They tasted like Totino's Pizza Rolls cooked in Campbell's Tomato Soup. :(- I hear there is a free champagne bar in the bathroom that is open during dinner service.

4.0,3/30/2012,"Honestly everything written about this place is true. Is it trendy? Sure, but not obnoxious and filled with ""hipsters"". It is filled with lots of beautiful people in close proxy all having a good time and not being pretentious at all. If you live in NYC and go to places like this you know that's hard to come by. My fiance and I arrived to our reservation a bit early this past Tues. Seeing how crowded it was we were worried we'd have to wait. Not at all. The hostess took us to a great little spot towards the back of the room where we were able to make friends with the people sitting next to us. We usually like to keep to ourselves, but both of us can be quite talkative and seeing as though it was my birthday I was ready to tie one on. We started with a few speciality cocktails that were really delicious. I had a Woodford Wilson and and the Meyer Margarita. I forget what she had, but she said it was awesome. Anyway, by reading the other reviews by now you understand this is tappas style place where all dishes are meant to be shared. We ordered five plates and it was the perfect amount. Here's what we ordered: Tuna tartar (very tasty), Oven braised chicken meatballs (wowsers, get it), Korean style spare ribs (prob my fav of the night), Short rib stuffed pablano peppers (a close second place), and the Kale and Apple salad (it was tasty). What's so good about this place is that they have such a wide range of food that you can really please any type of eater. If someone is picky this place still offers a great selection.

5.0,3/19/2012,"Where do I start? This is definitely a place that you want to check out. The ambiance and randomness is on point and reminds you of why you probably moved to NY in the first place or why it's hard to leave to move somewhere else after living here. I ventured here on a Sunday night with a friend. We had reservations and definitely needed them. The lighting is perfect, bright enough to read the menu and dim enough to be comfortable and relax in your seat. The music was appropriate too. I read complaints in other reviews about the music, but I found it to be pretty mixed the night that I was there and loud enough that it definitely could not be considered background music, but I didn't feel as though I were at a club. The food: it's tapas style, so hopefully you don't mind sharing with your friend or date. I tried a variety of things: oysters, lobster roll, pasta and Asian ribs. I definitely enjoyed everything. It's not the best food ever, but you won't be sissapointed either. The service was on point too. I never had to look around for a waiter or feel as though I waited a year and a day for my food or drink to arrive. Even with the tables being very close to each other, the staff remained on the move and made it work. Nice touch: complimentary champagne as you leave the ladies room. Sure, it's not the best champagne, but it truly is the icing on the cake. Not sure that I'd want to head here on a Saturday night based on what I've read as it seems like it could be a bit overwhelming, but I would come back on another off-night (does such a thing exist in NYC?). The most negative thing that I can say about Beauty & Essex is that they didn't have Shiraz by the glass and only offered one Shiraz bottle option at $300. I wouldn't exactly call this a deal breaker kids. Final verdict: Check it out with some friends (this restaurant has several large tables) or a date. It's worth it.

I wondered why the restaurant was given its name. And now I know: the restaurant also doubles as a vintage store (which you encounter first, upon walking in)! Hanging on the walls are vintage guitars (not my thing, but hey) and other antique finds. In the display cases, I spotted Chanel jewelry and leather accessories (swoon), and a beautiful gold clutch covered in Swarovski crystal tulips. I declared said clutch as the most beautiful purse I had ever laid eyes on and vowed to carry it on my wedding day. But I digress, lol.I was at Beauty & Essex for my friend Sureme's ""Girlfriend's Brunch"", so this was certainly a fitting locale. B&E serves both unique and delicious takes on American fare in a space you wouldn't expect to find in the neighborhood. The bi-level restaurant space has an old Hollywood feel, from the leather, burgundy chesterfield couches to the two-story chandelier hanging near the entry way.

The accompanying onion marmalade and capered greens went perfectly.  The chicken meatballs were luscious - fluffy (yet you can't figure out what's making it fluffy - it's not breadcrumbs) and in a pool of melted buffalo ricotta with truffle oil.  The tomato soup grilled cheese dumplings were delicious too - you can definitely taste the pancetta.And for dessert, we got the molten chocolate bread budding with hazelnut ice cream.  It was ridiculous.  Portion was definitely big enough to share. The bread pudding on top was crunchy, like a crust, but inside was totally molten.  The hazelnut ice cream was perfect on top.I am still dreaming about this meal.I'm surprised this place didn't get higher ratings for food.",0,0,0,Jenny L.,"New York, NY",2,65,4

4.0,3/4/2012,"Enter nondescript pawnshop into Diddy and JLo's  luxury NYC loft (or at least what I imagine it would be like had they stayed with each other and decorated a loft together).  This place screams OH YOU FANCY HUH? what with the giant chandeliers, grand spiral staircase, white faux fur wall coverings, and all.  It was a bit overwhelming for this little meatball in a sundress on a warm wintry day being surrounded by all this fanciness but I got over it- 5"" heels and skimpy Herve Leger dress noted for next time.  I've only been here once- late on a Saturday night- so I can't say much about their food or overall crowd attendance but I can say what I did see is enough to keep me coming back- mostly after payday because this place runs on pre-recession prices.  They had a good mixed crowd- suits and hipsters, hoes and ladies, young and old, broke and rich, black dudes tryna act white and white dudes tryna be black, rico suaves and Tito from the block- everyone surprisingly acting equally proper thus answering the age old question ""Can't we all just get along?"".  Why yes, yes we can.  Just put us in a room full of expensive breakables, scrutinizing eyes and the threat of a long, winding staircase roll down in front of everyone and we ALL can manage to get along!  The music selection was more lounge-y than dance-y so minus half a star for that cuz I like to put my dancing shoes to work; not sure if it's more bumpin earlier in the night but I'll definitely be back soon to find out.  The other half star deduction is for closing at 3AM.  What kinda NYC club closes at 3 in the morning?!?!   All in all a great place to see and be seen so dress the part.  Just a quick note to all my lovely ladies- try not to get sloppy drunk on the 2nd floor cuz the only way down (I think) is that aforementioned spiral staircase.  I managed to witness an unfortunate soul in uber high platform heels trying to make her way down in her drunken stupor and it wasn't pretty- bitch clung on to that handrail and did everything short of crawling down the stairs.  You don't want to be her now, do you?",2,13,1,Angela A.,"Manhattan, NY",36,12,2
2.0,3/4/2012,"If you came for the food, I feel sorry for you.Went there for brunch with a couple of out-of-towners. The main attraction is the not-so-hidden-at-all entrance, furry stair walls and upstairs' chandeliers. The rest is absolutely useless.Food came out cold and tasteless. The lobster tacos tasted fishy which is the internationally recognized sign of non-freshness, unless you're a sea otter. The fried chicken was fried beyond recognition and the biscuits were impressively bland. If you tried to serve food that bad, you couldn't, but somehow their chef pulled it off. The service is as snappy as a snail marathon after the first rain. Some patrons may be beautiful but they're oh-so-punchable in the face type of pretty walking like they own the place. The champagne service in the ladies' room was nowhere to be found, so I ended looking bad when I insisted my female guests to check out the restrooms.It's this type of places where you go just to check it off your bucket list.

Since our table was taking forever we tried to get at a drink but we were mobbed by the crowd. Who places a bar at the entrance of a HUGE dining room? It looks like complete chaos in there on a busy night. In my opinion this place is FAR more CHEESY then TRENDY. I guess it seems cool for a bunch of people who grow up in the suburbs watching sex in the city. I must admit there are 1 or 2 things on the menu that are very tasty the tomato tartar is incredible and so is the devil chocolate cake but that's about it. Their prices are insane for the quality and quantity of food. There is nothing classy about being jammed into an over sized room full of bridge and tunnel leftovers.The service is a disorganized mess. I HATE when Food comes out at random times and everyone is waiting while their food gets cold for the rest of the group to receive theirs. Personally when I go out to a restaurant I go with the purpose of eating a good meal not to ""try"" and feel cool. Stanton Social their counterpart is great.

We sat at a table in front of the bar upstairs and had an attentive waitress.I took my boyfriend here a few weeks ago, hoping to get their awesome dirty martini again. I was soo disappointed. Too much gin. We both got it and were both trying to force it down. At $14 each, I wanted something better. Also, the bartender was kind of rude.

5.0,2/26/2012,"Earlier in the week, a visit to the LES church of small plates, Stanton Social, NYC gifted me a new happy place. Three-hours of well crafted cocktails and innovative apps left us sated amid the low lights of this lotus blossomed lounge. This level of culinary satiation in a space so beautiful you want to take up residence lead me to make an actual reservation for the companion restaurant around the corner, another Chris Santos dream, Beauty and Essex.  Planning a few days ahead is something I never seem to do.  But when you find something this good you plan to have it again and plot accordingly. We arrive through the pawnshop storefront into the interior. There is a sense of arrival, and not just because of the secret passage into spectacular chandelier lit space. But because your entire experience has been designed and the brush strokes don't show.  They thought of the lighting, they thought of the comfort of the booths, of the weight of the flatware, of the shape of the plates, of the scents and flavors. They remembered to train all of their staff, not just the waiters. Everyone from the hosts to the waiters to the busboys achieve the new formal dining standard;  Formal in form while friendly, accessible and informative. Ah the food. from the raw bar items, to the toasts, veggies and entrees each thing was perfection.  And for the reviewers that seem to think small plates are a snore because everyone is putting little portions on little plates these days and calling it Tapas, don't worry this place does it right. The portions increase in size as you move through the menu and the flavors build and compliment the next in the progression. You can select a type of cuisine and move through the menu (Asian influence, globetrot or pick a protein and select it in different incarnations, raw to cooked, or pick flavors you want to combine across the menu). If you take a minute to study this menu you can see the permutations were planned to ensure that your ""spontaneous"" choices build smart flavor profiles.  Long live Santos.",0,0,0,Heather G.,"San Diego, CA",10,24,0

5.0,2/22/2012,"My favorite place in the  city at the moment. I've been three times in 6 months which is saying a lot because I almost never visit trendy places and visit so often. i even threw my birthday here because i knew my friends would be impressed. I have to say the first time I went my waiter Chris? ( i think) was fabulous and i was there for brunch pretty early on a Sunday. what can i really say about the atmosphere that hasnt been said already? it might be one of the most beautiful restaurants in the city. the first floor's main room decorated with gold and peacock feathers is like a girlie-girl's dream. (i am a girly-girl, i eat this up) the bathroom which offer free pink champagne and haas vintage perfume bottles is what i hope my bathroom looks like when i grow up.the second floor, where there is often a dj most nights, has rooms: Pearl and locket....and they are just as beautiful as they sound.i will try my best to remember everything i've had there and describe it.the first time i went i had the jewels on toast with tomato and cheddar: SO good. its like an egg scramble with sweet tomatoes and grated cheddar on top. I also had the lemon blackberry pancakes with ricotta. Perfect. Just perfect. Exactly what i expected, perfectly portioned pancakes with a brilliant citrus flavor and blackberries that dont overwhelm with a scoop of ricotta (unique)the second time i went i got a little more adventurous and had the tomato tartare, which is small  but delicious, nothing really to special. its a small canape with tomato and a quail egg on top. Very fancy. and then i had the lobster tacos. this is an interesting way of making lobster more of a comfort food and more casual. it was fried lobster meat with a spicy chipotle mayo and pickled cabbage on top. it has to be one of my favorite dishes on the menu besides the jewels on toast which i also ordered. for dessert i had the beignets, i love fried dough and i love sugar. but there was WAY to much sugar on them.the third time i got the tacos again and then i had the cheese ravioli with mushrooms and parsnips. for me, the ravioli is the best savory ive had in a while. period. for some people, they may find it a bit on the salty side, since it is cooked in butter. but i loved it. and one more small tid-bit their signature drink the ""beauty elixir"" is a refreshing delicious drink worth getting. its a mixture of gin, cucumber, strawberry and sparkling rose, how could it not be good?there is no shortage of unique dishes or beautiful ambiance here, and its perfect for dinner and drinks/dancing. be prepared to spend a little more to feel full and to dress sharp, because as the other reviewers have pointed out there are LOTS of beautiful people there.

The atmosphere is cool, swanky, and unlike any other place I've been too. The cocktail menu is out of this world. I highly suggest going with a group and trying one of each. The three of had the Meyer Margarita, the Ruby Mojito, and the Beauty Elixir. All of them were equally delicious, but the Beauty Elixir won our hearts! Perfectly fresh and bubbly. The food was delicious. We ordered an abundance of different items, one better than the next. Our top 3: The Grilled Cheese, Bacon,and Tomato soup Dumplings, the Tuna wonton Tacos, and the Braised Short Rib Tamales.My mouth is watering just thinking about the bursts of flavor and the presentation. After dinner we went upstairs where we could be closer to the ""club"" atmosphere. We danced until our feet couldn't take it and went on our way. The music choices were impeccable. There was a little bit of everything...people in the dining room were even jumping out of their seats to get down. The hostesses were sweet and accommodating, our server was helpful with making suggestions, and the bartenders were quick and efficient. Make sure to check out all the decor elements (my favorite part) from the pawn, shop to the lobby, the spiral stair case, the dining room...not one aspect is the same. Definitely make a reservation up to a week or so before going if you plan on going on a weekend.

So I am enjoying a few of these broken blossoms and just having a great time.  My friends who I was with informed me that the Ladies washroom had free flowing champagne,  I was like wow that makes this place just a little bit more cool, too bad I could not take advantage of that but I was perfectly happy with my cocktailsDinner was kind of late so we did not order too much but we shared all of what we had.  The truffel meatballs were so good and tasty, also the lobster tail tacos.  My friend wanted to share a burger which was good but nothing that I would order again.  I just felt all the other food was so much better.  I wish I had ordered the lobster mac and cheese.  Especially after trying the lobster tacos.  I would definitely come back here and it was a very cool place to hang out with friends.  I would probably skip dinner and just enjoy their expertly crafted cocktails.",1,0,0,Sheenon O.,"Venice, CA",328,138,12

4.0,2/8/2012,"Beauty & Essex is a strange place, and I mean that in a good way.  Its bizarre pawn shop entrance and beyond-eclectic interior are dazzlingly weird (white fur wall!), and its large and interesting menu was enticing enough for us to work hard to book it for a weekend in the city.The meal was a lot of fun, I'll say that.  I drank one drink all night, the Sapphire Seventy-Five (blueberry-brown sugar Bombay Sapphire, prosecco, sour mix), and it was delicious again and again.  The food was interesting and fun... but objectively non-astounding.  The best item of the night was likely the goat cheese, fig and onion toast, which was delicious, but the other dishes we ordered (grilled cheese dumplings in soup, ribs, fried oysters) didn't do anything to astound (though they did all satisfy).  Nothing was bad, but little was great.Beauty & Essex is an experience.  It's fun, it's vibrant, it's loud, it's different.  It's not a culinary revelation, but you're probably not just going for the food.",0,0,0,Steve M.,"Philadelphia, PA",173,124,38
3.0,2/7/2012,"It's pretty yes; magnificent, really.  But for $50 a person for brunch (without alcohol), I'm not really sure the food was worth it.  I will say, however, that the dark chocolate croissants and the lemon pancakes with ricotta left a lasting impression on me.I really also think it bizarre that all the waitresses wear really tight, short matching dresses (regardless of their shape and what would flatter them).  Some of us don't want to see that.  Just saying.I'd recommend this place for some snacks and drinks (vs. a whole meal) with friends, just because the atmosphere is cool and super eccentric.",0,0,0,Nicola M.,"New York, NY",65,91,0
4.0,2/7/2012,"If you're looking for a scene in New York, than this place certainly has it. When entering, you walk through a pawn shop to an entrance with a beautiful circle staircase, stunning chandelier and a place covered in candles. It was a great place for a birthday dinner during our stay in NYC. We were seated upstairs in a cozy booth and proceeded to have delicious cocktails. Our waitress was a tad slower than I would have liked but the bus boys were great. I swear an empty glass or plate didn't stay in front of anyone for more than 3 mins and that is pretty impressive for a small plate restaurant.Now onto the food. The food was good. It was by no means great. Some of my personal higlights included:- Wonton tuna taco- crunchy, fresh, approachable and delightful- goat cheese, fig and onion toast- it was salty, sweet and creamy delicious!- grilled cheese tomato soup dumplings- they were served on a spoon and the second I bit into the dumpling, it was a cheese explosion. As a person who loves cheese, I couldn't ask for anything more.To sum up, Beauty and Essex is more about the whole package. The place, the food, the drinks ( even the champage in the ladies room) make this place together but nothing really shined alone. I would reccomend it but probably not go back for a whole meal of food.",2,0,3,Lindsay H.,"Philadelphia, PA",125,220,10

The decor is stunning. First it looks like a tiny cute pawn shop, than you walk through this door and its a hustling and bustling restaurant. Great music playing and you can tell from the vibe, it's going to be a good night.We started off with the Tomato Soup and Grilled Cheese dumplings, amazing! and the Ricotta and Pear bread thing, this was even more amazing. We were also given something else compliments of the chef, it was tuna or lobster (as you can tell I do not eat seafood) but it was ok. For my main I had the Beauty and Essex burger. It was so juicy the meat was falling apart, I also had  the Yukon Gold Potato Puree, which was amazing and the BBQ fries were so tasty as well. My friend had the Rigatoni which was delicious.For desert I had the Pot De Cream. It literally melts in your mouth! and my friend had some cake which was good. The amount of food we had was ridiculous. I couldn't even finish my main or my desert that's how filling the food is.The service there was impeccable. I would return here again in a heart beat. They were so nice there they comped a few things for us, which was nice.Also, if you think you can just walk in and get a table, good luck.

4.0,2/5/2012,"I have to rant a sec again-- peeve: stupid reviewers. Idiots shouldn't be allowed to Yelp.  Reviewers that said Beauty & Essex lets anything and everything through the door must have forgotten that people can make reservations to the restaurant and a business can't exactly exclude patrons from eating at their restaurant for being ugly. Now with that said, after eating downstairs, no one prevents you from grabbing drinks at the bar or going upstairs for more drinks and dancing. Get over yourself!! If you want to go to a place with a strict door go to Meatpacking joints, not the LES, thanks. 4.5 stars for the decor. It's romantic and classy and I wouldn't describe the place as being full of chandeliers but there are a few throughout the space. There's even a mini chandelier in each bathroom stall.  Very sexy spot, definitely old Hollywood. Marilyn Monroe would've looked right at home in Beauty & Essex. 4 stars for food, reminded me of Stanton Social food-- nicely presented and tasty.  Dessert was amazing, esp the devil's food layer cake, so decadent.  Service was a bit disorganized though, the waiter thought we got our food already when all we got were drinks. 3.5 for the crowd on a Saturday night-- everything and everyone. Hot ( lots of hot modelesque girls), ugly (no explanation needed), old (40+), young (mostly girls trying to snag some old rich dude), fat girls (more than a few of those), and of course good and bad combinations of all those.  Seriously you name it, they were all at Beauty & Essex.  A plus for the dudes though-- seemed to be way more hot chicks on the prowl than there were hot guys.  One glance around the room and you'll cringe and drool at the same time...Con-- We had an 11:15pm reservation and were not seated until after an hour but we were given a round of free drinks. Overall-- I'd go back but only if I had a dinner reservation before 10:30pm and to impress out of towners.",3,3,2,Yolanda L.,"Brooklyn, NY",142,190,38

Yes the tapas style food and flirty drinks were tasty. Yes, it was surprisingly affordable. No, I don't think I will be going again.Why? I believe it was the night we dined, which was Friday. Let's just say this: it was BEYOND bridge and tunnel and all they played was rap music. In all seriousness, it was 100% rap and hip-hop.

I have tried the tuna sashimi, roasted tomato pizzetta, and the rigatoni. I have zero complaints on the food.The service is a little grating though. We had to wait almost an hour for our 10pm reservation on a Saturday night once. But who cares when you're sitting in the ladies room drinking free champagne, and you are already mentally prepared to be starting out a late night? When we got to our table, we ordered more drinks, and the waiter carded us. We commented on this since we were all 27 year old girls, don't really get carded anymore, and weren't carded in the bathroom. The waiter said, ""oh well it's brighter down there."" ZING! You calling us old? At the BEGINNING of the meal?I love the decor here. It's really dark, and really grand. There is a huge staircase in the entry lobby. The main dining room has very tall ceilings and skylights. I like the faux speakeasy-style entrance too.I read that this place is ""for the girls."" That is definitely true. There are a lot of girls here, it's a place you wear your heels, and I'll admit I only come here for ""girls night"". There is free pink champagne in the ladies room, but not the men's.

Restaurant itself looks like a nightclub with low key dance music playing in the background. Food is good and meant to be shared so this is a nice place to go with several folks and share several entrees.One issue is that my chair got constantly bumped by staff and other patrons while at the our table.  There isn't much room between tables and I got bumped numerous times during the night which was annoying. Also the coat check needs to be handled better. Coat check is downstairs near the bathrooms and the girl has to go up and down stairs all night to get your coat. Even worse, my coat got lost and was eventually found. I'd recommend holding onto your coat at your table if possible.Overall food and service except coat check was good.

What we ordered: 1) Vanilla Beignets (keyword for dunkin donuts jelly munchkins). PASS. Not worth it. 2) ""Cornbread"" Waffles: We all agreed that the waffles were way too hard. Put a lot of syrup and tons of butter on top to soften it up. I personally liked the flavor... they just need to work on the consistency. 3) Fried Chicken Biscuit Bites: Way more biscuits than chicken. We had mixed reviews about this one. The biscuits portion was tasty! There could have been more chicken. It was basically all bread crumbs. 4) Lobster Tacos: Probably the best dish we had while there. We are all lobster lovers.5) Creamy Mascarpone Grits: My friend said it tasted like oatmeal. I guess this is a bad thing when you're expecting grits? No se. 6) Free Range Scrambled Eggs: Ok. Decent.

The atmosphere was great because it was busy. Music is fairly loud so this is not a place for a romantic dinner for two. The food like salmon, fresh fries, lemon tarts etc were fabulous. The staff was friendly. I just didn't like that they removed plates with food from the table so quickly that I couldn't finish my plate. They were too quick obviously because another group was booked for this table.

2.0,1/21/2012,"My colleagues picked out this restaurant while we were on a business trip to NYC. I will start off by saying that the food was decent, not stellar, but pretty good. The wine selection was lacking though. Now, to the reason for the 2-star rating ...the atmosphere, crowd and loud music. Talk about a scene...sheez. Everybody, the patrons, hostesses, servers and bar staff, were so stuck up and seemed too cool to be doing their jobs. They spent more time standing around gossiping and playing with their hair and dresses than working (and as much as i like pretty women, i don't need to see your butt cheeks hanging out of your way-to-short skirts and the trendy tatoos all over your body ... while i am eating). Our waitress was actually pretty good, but just watching around the room was embarrassing. The patrons were also too cool for everyone and i'd say half the people in the very narrow bar area weren't even there for dinner...they were just there to hang out and be seen. Madhouse. Also, we were seated 30 minutes late and didn't get our first bite of food until an hour later. The music was so loud that it gave you headache, and forget about talking to your friends at the table. We all woke up with raspy voices from shouting. Oh, almost forgot about the price. Tapas were between $15-25 each...and since we had 7 people, we had to add extra pieces to all (most tapas served 3 or 4). Almost $1000 for 7 people for just decent food and average wine.

Not too bad considering the quality and quantity of the food.)They play old school hip hop and rap and I loved it! It can get a little loud sometimes but the DJ was throwing on some tracks I haven't heard in years. My bf took a picture with a random guy which I later found out was Iman Shumpert of the NY Knicks. Some random facts:-they really do serve ladies free champagne in the restroom-you walk through an operating pawn shop to get to the restaurant (speakeasy-ish) -it's a celebrity hangout (Mos Def and Talib Kweli was there that night too)-the burger is too juicy. it's a real mess to eat-there is a glass atrium in the main dining room-upstairs has a bar and lounge,0,0,0,Vanessa T.,"Honolulu, HI",155,449,14

One good thing about NYE is that if you get close enough to it, all the amateurs that go crazy on that night stay home for the few days before so they can rest up. I snagged a 6:45 reservation, I know not ideal but better than 5:15. I was running late and was not going to make it all the way down to the LES on time so I called to cancel...sniff sniff. The girl that answered the phone was so nice and accommodating. She asked why I had to cancel and I told her I was running late and she asked me what time would work. I said 8:00? and she said ""how about 8:15?"" score!!! We walked in and the hostess told us it would be a minute and we might want to have a drink at the bar. The bar was jam-packed but we squeezed our way in to order. I ordered a Manhattan, delish, and my friend had Apples to Oranges. The bartender wasn't that nice but my drink was outstanding...hers, ehh, skip it. We then were seated and presented with a very yummy amuse bouche of greek yogurt on some type of cracker. The only reason I'm giving them 4 instead of 5 stars is their wine list blows. Not much selection and WAY over-priced. I did order a nice Albarino but it was ridiculoulsy priced. On to what we ate...we had the whipped ricotta and sage on toast to start..great..then we had the kale and apple salad, unbelievable!, and the lobster pizzetta. The portions are medium to small but hey, it is a tapas place. For dessert we had the box o donuts. The jelly ones were insane but I'll have to say the nutella filled ones didn't taste like nutella?

Great service at the bar and the place was just happening.  Ordered a Essex sour blush and the drink was the prelude of what it would be a absolute nite to remember. It was that good. Ordered--1) The Crispy chicken croquettes2) Braised short rib tamales 3) Salt and pepper shrimp4) Chicken meatballs5) Kobe beef carpaccio6) General tso's monkfish.7) Paella.8) GarganelliEverything was out of this world. The Garganelli was the best. It was so rich and delicious. There aren't any words to decribe this dish because the moment it endered my throat I already felt that I was being transported into some grandma's house in italy. Ok.. not like that good but it was outstanding. The Kobe beef carpaccio was pretty well plated. It didn't have that weird smelly beef smell that you would get sometimes if you order raw beef. The beef tasted like butter like always with kobe beef. The salt and pepper shrimp was not as mayonesiasy as I expected but it was pretty good. The general tso's monkfish was also pretty amazing. It was light and had a nice subtle finish to it. Great dining here overall.See if i was a lady, I would take advantage of the free champagne.

But it's hardly hidden in my opinion.. I mean it was the only brightly lit store front at 10 pm at night with a big black dude checking ID's outside the entrance.. you do not need to see the drunk girls being carried out by security to know that there is something back there besides a really fake looking pawn shop...Upon entering the back, the downstairs area is much like a lounge restaurant while the spiral staircase that takes you up stairs to another bar and tables and couches.  It's very chic, very modern, and very crowded.We did not want to spend a lot of time and we found it hard to get a drink so we took out business elsewhere.Based on the ""coolness"" factor, I believe i would be a fan of this place!

Great service at the bar, gorgeous decor.I came here a few weeks later with some friends and was diverted so Stanton Social (see my review of that). I came back after going to Stanton Social with my two friends hoping to grab some dessert and drinks. The bouncer at the door said that they would not allow anyone in until 11 (the party was over at 10:30 and we were told to go back at 11:00). Then they said the would only allow people with reservations, as they had 200 reservations that evening. All of this dialogue was very rude and hostile. So, being the savvy foodie I am/ experienced NYC diner. I hopped on my phone and made a reservation for 3 for 11:15. I went back to the door and the bouncer who gave me a very pissed-off look and was sort of like ""what do you want"" etc. I told him politely that we had a reservation for 3 at 11:15 and we were ready to be seated. The bouncer immediately huffed and puffed and was very ""yeah-right"" about it as he asked the iPad holding reservation gal at the door. Oh, look at that. I'm in the system for one of those ""200"" reservations. The bouncer then barked at us saying, ""Are you SURE you're ready to eat a full meal?!"" Like I was from Kansas. (no offense). I then told him in my most obnoxious voice ever, ""Oh, we are staaaaaaaaaaaaarving"".Walked in and had 4 tapas plates and dessert. So much fun with my friends. I was appalled at this bouncer though.

I believe it's Chef Chris Santos's second restaurant in NYC (he owns   Stanton Social a few block away).  The ambiance is more of the style in the Meat Packing area where the space is very flashy and luxurious (think circa Glam 70s and sexy!). This is the spot to go with a bunch of friends, not if you want to have an intimate dinner or with parents who are in town. The main dining room is downstairs and upstairs is lounge style (you can order the full menu upstairs too.) Their tapas menu is big & food is very good. Often at this type of giant sized trendy spot the food is just ok ...but everything here is very good. The bone marrow with shallot marmalade is one of the best I EVER had, even better than Prune's ...and I love Prune. Trendy Japanese Shishito Peppers are a must to order and share.

4.0,11/19/2011,"customer service does still exist in manhattan. just because it's a classy establishment doesn't mean people should be pretentious (waitstaff and customers alike). but let me back up first. i've been here a few times, one of which was for dinner with a big group. we got a bunch of appetizers to share-- my favorite might have been the lobster tacos. we also got chicken fried oysters, lobster mac and cheese, broccolini (perfectly cooked and spicy!), the fries, baby back ribs, pressed chicken, grilled salmon. i wasn't COMPLETELY blown away, but all the meat/fish dishes were done just right, very tender. and i can't really complain about any of the other dishes. i would go back to try some of the other dishes (bone marrow? yes). so overall, pretty pricey for tapas sized portions, but tasty and fun to enjoy in a group setting. dessert equaled the box of doughnuts, chocolate bread pudding, and devil's food cake. those were delicious as well, the bread pudding was *almost* as good as dessert truck, and i loved the ganache on the cake. we caught an early dinner, and the place got REALLY busy by the end of our meal. they put our check down right away post-dessert, and we sat around chatting after we paid. we were literally about to leave, but the manager came over and asked if we'd like to join him for a drink on the house. now that's how you clear a table! you just exponentially increased your chances for repeat customers, rather than shoot yourself in the foot by being a douche and kicking your customers out. so we happily went upstairs for some drinks-- the beauty elixir is tasty (cucumber and strawberry), but depending on how the bartender is feeling, the gin can be a real kick in the face. i love the decor upstairs, the pendants hanging inside antique frames are really anthropologie-esque. the crowd is usually older, but at least you won't be witnessing a shitshow put on by 21 year old college drunkards. what else can i add...my friend's coat had some ice cream mysteriously spilled on it, and the management offered her free dry cleaning. another plus for service. i was really expecting a rude ""i don't care about you"" attitude at this establishment, but i have to say i was pretty impressed. beautiful.",3,0,0,Mel H.,"Los Angeles, CA",33,65,0

Now, as a restaurant the food was decidedly average while the service was impeccable. We tried the chicken meatballs and they were very bland and the goat cheese didn't help it was just overly creamy with no salty element. Also, the chinese broccoli was very plain and presented sloppily. The yellowtail crudo was fantastic, though and overall dinner was fun just not.... good.

I told her that I would re-asses the situation after the food came out and if we're still hungry we would order more.

Of course, we called her out on it cause she obviously just wanted a bigger tip. 20 minutes later after arguing to remove the items we didn't order, she took the extra portions off the bill. As a paying customer, l should be the judge of how much food I want to order, not the waitress!  on a side note, the lounge upstairs is great, beautiful decor, trendy, snooty, and difficult to get in.

I sat on hold with the restaurant - mind you for a combined total of over 30 min throughout this process - waiting to speak with the event planner who proceeded to tell me that parties of 8 or more CAN actually be booked 60 days in advance and that the availability was so limited for the night I wanted to reserve, that my party could no longer actually eat at the restaurant.So not only did I waste an exorbitant amount of my own time waiting on hold for a very simple answer (that could have been avoided entirely with a simple organizational system and the very minimum in customer service skills) but the restaurant also lost the business of 9 dinner guests and any ounce of class I mistakenly thought they had.",0,0,0,Naomi B.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,2,0

The amuse bouche to start off, beet chutney on a flat bread - great starter. We ordered the salad with apples and pancetta, mushroom side, tuna taco, beef carpaccio, and tomato tartare.. woweee wow. The best hands down, the tomato tartare. I was not eager to try it, but on the waitress's recommendation we ordered and it was a-maaazing.

My first experience when i came was after a long night in the west village my friends and I decided to hit up the Lower East Side for some downtown fun and of course my friend recommended this hot spot. HONESTLY MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A RESERVATION EARLY LATE AFTERNOON OR LATE NIGHT because to wait outside especially if its cold sucks alot. The lines are normally very long, but the bouncers aren't pushy or rude so that's a bonus.The pawn shop has some pretty cool stuff in it that people do actually buy, once you get in the place space is extremely cavernous and beautifully designed. The ambiance is unreal and the fur lined walls leading upstairs is a nice touch. This place is geared obviously towards Tapas and the restaurant scene but the bar/night life does get bumping here. You will def run into a beautiful crowd and celebrities as well. The girls bathroom has free champagne being offered and apparently is just wonderful. The food and the service is excellent, its better to go during the week or on a Sunday for brunch. If you go on the weekend your bound to hit the bridge and tunnel crowd and the lines/overcrowding will make you miserable.

4.0,10/15/2011,"This is a great place to impress a date or for a special dinner. Despite this being in the LES (my fond memories of the edgy gritty LES has been overtaken by B&T lamesters and jersey girls with bad shoes and split ends...sorry...) the cool factor begins once you enter the pawn shop entrance. Once you open the doors to the restaurant you enter a luxe foyer with winding staircase to your right and a long walkway to a bar and lounge to your left. Further past the bar and lounge you can see a number of banquettes and tables int eh distance. This place is beautifully appointed. This is expected since the restaurant was designed by them architect of the stunning Stanton social. Anyway,...aesthetically the restaurant is laid out. The restaurant is also but loud so don't expect intimate convo...that can be good or bad for you if it is a first date. Anyway on to the food. The plates are all made to share and when I tell you the food is good. It really is good!!! We ordered the kale and apple salad, the lobster tacos, the sashimi, the burger, and the salmon. Everything was wow excel the sashimi and that isn't because the sashimi was bad but in hindsight what can u really do to raw fish that hasn't been done. The standout of the night was definitely the lobster tacos...OMFG. The portions were great for sharing and they were tasty. For dessert we had the devil food cake (decent) and the pot de Creme (ehhh....not so much...). I am definitely going back and suggest that you go as well.

The front of the restaurant is unassuming, its oddly pawnshop themed, but there is a hostess in the front who will wave you back into the dining room. The dining room is dark and trendy, and would probably be a great space for a private event or a birthday party.Highlights: -the Ruby mojito was great, not too strong though (or maybe I just ate so much of the delish food I didn't feel the one drink at all)-Best dish that I had all night was the first, the fig and goat cheese on toast appetizer. Fresh bread was key.

3.0,10/4/2011,"From the front, i didn't really think it was a restaurant, more like a overpriced hipster pawn shop on the Lower East Side. When I ventured inside, it actually was pawnshop of sorts, with a superhero fetish undertone. Not really much indication there was a restaurant until they opened the giant door. Pleasantly surprised.A grand staircase led up to the upper dining area, and we passed through a bar area to get to our seats. The main dining area was interesting to say the least. I liked the large dome skylight, but the rest of it was too over the top for me. I get the light purple walls and the mood lighting, but when you add stenciled outlines of peacocks in gold glitter and have bouquets of peacock feathers lining the the walls, it was a bit too much to take in. The food was pretty mixed. Maybe because one of our guests was vegan, but the non-meat items such as the beet salad sucked. The two roasted bone marrows were huge, and from our friend who loves marrow, stated it was very flavorful. The chicken meatballs that one yelper raved about were excellent as well, but i was pretty apprehensive about it was first, because upon splitting it open, it looked undercooked (be assured i didn't get sick). As for dessert the berry crumble was good but the strawberry shortcake was a disaster, all the way down to the green mint whipped cream. I commented that a 5-year old could make that shortcake. Oh forgot about the General Tso's monkfish--soggy. If Panda Express made a frozen version, it would be this.And the rumor that there is FREE CHAMPAGNE in the ladies bathroom?

Then they open the back door, I was pleasantly suprised by what's behind the velvet curtain. Chandlier draps from the second floor by the staircase, full bar on the left, natural sun deck in the back of the dinning room. I went from EW-ing this place to falling in love with this place.

Scones were nicely made.  Chicken meatball was gooooooood. I almost wanted to lick off the ricotta cheese sauce off of the plate :dI must say that the waitress was a bit... snobbish I guess?

3.0,9/28/2011,"Making a reservation doesn't guarantee you a seat at the appointed time ... we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated for an 8:45 pm reservation on a Tuesday night. No apologies, just come see us when the beeper vibrates. No, please have a drink at the bar or check out upstairs ... just here's your beeper. After waiting 15 minutes I finally asked when we might be seated (nicely I might add) ... the hostess spoke into her microphone and asked that a 4 top be split into two 2 tops and Voila ... our table was being prepared as we spoke. It is very loud and clubby ... I essentially had dinner in the middle of an overly crowded non-dance dance club last night. Truthfully, my husband and I had no idea about the atmosphere; had we, we likely would have bypassed B&E. However, after eating the food, I'm glad we went (and stayed, we were considering other options as we stood waiting for our table). Our server was fantastic -- very attentive without being overbearing. It was very difficult to hear (I have hearing damage from an AC/DC concert I went to when I was 16), so we had to literally yell at each other about the menu. His voice was hoarse. We started with the ""jewels on toast"" -- we selected the fig and goat cheese. The thick(ish) slabs of toast was perfectly toasted; the goat cheese was creamy and fresh (and not too tangy for my liking); and, the figs and onions had been marinated in some type of wine (I believe). A very good start. We next shared the sweet tomato pizzetta with black olives, goat cheese, roasted garlic oil and fresh wispy shavings of Reggiano. The flavors were delicious, however the crust needed to be even just a bit crispier. The pizzetta is sliced into pieces about 1 inch by 3 or 4 inches and they were droopy. We also tried the tempura Vidalia onion rings, which come with a delicious home-made ketchup and a buttermilk blue cheese dip which I did not care for (my husband liked it though). The onion rings are about 1/2 thick and are tasty. The batter is well seasoned and with the sweetness of the onion itself, you didn't even need any dipping sauces. For my taste, however, the rings could have been fried just a bit more and could have been a bit less greasy. Next, we had the Ahi poke wonton tacos -- Chef Santos surely derives his inspiration for this dish from Gotts Roadside in California (formerly Taylor's Refresher) which has been serving crispy Ahi tacos for years. B&E's miniature versions of Gotts' tacos taste literally identical -- from the sesame oil, to the cilantro, cabbage, radish, and wasabi mayo (aioli vs. kewpie). Yum, but very familiar. We finished with the Garganelli - essentially ribless penne -- with a spicy (and I mean spicy (but not too spicy)) veal bolognese and fresh whipped ricotta cheese. It's served in a rustic bowl on a rustic bread board with lines of extra red peppers (which, if used in my opinion would ruin the dish with raw uncoaxed heat) and fluffs of Reggiano. This dish was fantastic -- not fresh pasta, but that didn't matter because the richness and balance of the sweet and smoky tomatoes with the spice made the sauce the star. There could have been a tad more of the whipped ricotta. Took the remainder of the dish home for breakfast. I had 2 very nicely made Kettel One dirty martinis -- no complaints from me about the size of the pour. My husband had 2 nice glasses of red wine from the by the glass list. I really like the decor of the bar and restaurant -- didn't get upstairs or use the bathroom so can't comment on either or the free champagne. The ambiance with all of the 20 and 30 somethings preening around the bar brought back memories. The crowd in the dining area was a good mix of 20 somethings up to to 50 somethings, all having to yell to hear each other. After about an hour, the decibel level seemed to abate ... either that or we became acclimated. Overall, something we don't see in Seattle so it was fun.

The server did NOT bring the little shaker to the table and pour, as a martini should be served. My drink came to the table not cold enough, in a dinky glass with half an inch of space at the top. The chile salt rim was a mess. The drink menu is great, creative twists on cocktails you already love. Too bad about the terrible execution and service.For me the food was a different story. It was something I enjoy, small plate new American. Tomato soup & cheese dumplings were not what I expected- they are cheese dumplings open at the top (like shu mei) browned in the oven on a bed of cream of tomato soup. I had envisioned a Shanghai-style soup dumpling but with tomato soup & melted cheese inside. But they were wonderful! We got the grilled corn which was also excellent. Roasted and then cut off the cob & grilled w chiles, lime & cheese. Brocollini was nice- perfectly done, fresh, with spicy red pepper. I liked the chicken meatballs, my dining companion thought they tasted like Swedish meatballs at Ikea. But admit it, those Ikea meatballs are tasty! These were much larger, fluffy with chicken & maybe chives inside, topped with creme fraiche and some yummy grated cheese. The last thing we got was the Kobe beef carpaccio, which should have been the first thing but they messed up and forgot to make it. They apologized, but a quality establishment will offer you a little something at the end like a dessert wine or a frickin dish of sorbet. Of course we were understanding, mistakes happen, but they didn't offer us jack. The carpaccio was great because the meat was great, but it was topped with what I thought was shallots but tasted like it had sprouts? Weird.

Rule #1 of tending bar- provide the patron with the requested drink.I ordered a Patrón Silver Tequini. Simple. Tequila, splash vermouth, dash of bitters. Bartender told me I really didn't want that and he would not suggest vermouth in a tequila martini. I was slightly taken aback but decided to go with it- perhaps this fella is the next Jerry Thomas in the making? Not so. I was still without a cocktail and asked the bartender to make me a Patrón Paloma. I got my drink and shortly we headed over to the dining area, my sip told me the drink was a dismal failure.  Proprietors, please: Learn your staff how to pour something other than vodka- tequila isn't just for shots and sunrises.",1,4,2,Maria W.,"NY, NY",974,773,735
4.0,9/8/2011,"This place was simply incredible. We went with another couple on a Tuesday night at around 9:30pm and it was bumping! I read some reviews and it said you had to walk through a pawn shop to get to the restaurant. Well, it's true. You really DO walk through a pawn shop--and they sell some pretty cute stuff, mind you. We entered the restaurant and the place was totally my style--crystal, mirrors, dark lighting, music, and just very fashionably dressed New Yorkers. I was in love. We went straight to the bar, where I ordered an Earl the Pearl, and my boyfriend had a dirty martini. Like my previous yelp reviews, I'm not a superfan of those strong alcoholic drinks, but my Earl the Pearl was delicious. Also, I've had some horrendous dirty martinis, but the one I tasted was just perfect. I had 2 other drinks: Smoked Opal Martini--SO GENIUS. I love the spice and smokiness, mixed in with the slightly sweet. I highly recommend this drink if you like spicy things. I also had a glass of champagne in the women's bathroom (yes, they serve it in there--which by the way, the bathroom is on another level. They have vintage perfume bottles which I was so tempted to steal it was so cute). All in all, their drinks were very good.As for the food, we ordered as much as we could (by the way, they're all tapas style)-Whipped Ricotta-BLT-Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup Dumplings-Braised Short Rib Tamales-Chicken Fried Oysters-Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs-Lobster Mac and Cheese-Heritage Baby Back Ribs-Lobster TacosDessert: Blueberry Crisp and Bread PuddingOf all the things we tried, I HIGHLY recommend the Grilled Cheese dumplings, the chicken fried oysters, and the chicken meatballs. My least favorite were the short rib tamales (you can skip those entirely. They were just decent) I wasn't disappointed by anything that I ate, and it just kept getting better and better! As for the dessert, I am not a fan of bread pudding in general, but this was just simply good. It tasted just like a brownie--my kind of dessert. The blueberry crisp was ok--they certainly didn't skim on the blueberries, but if I were to choose of the two, the bread pudding is definitely better.With drinks, food, dessert, tax, and tip, it was about $170 per couple, or $85 a person. Not the cheapest establishment, but the ambiance, food, drinks, was pretty worth it. Great place!",1,0,0,Victoria B.,"San Francisco, CA",40,134,2
2.0,9/7/2011,"This is a restaurant located behind a staged pawn shop. An attentive diner would realize that much like pawn shop inventory you need to be turned over quickly and what appears to be gold might not actually be. I believe the restaurant pushes through 4 seatings each night?! or at least on weekends. The faux exclusiveness / supper-club / speakeasy makes people feel like gold (fool's gold) and therefore willing to blow $18 on a tray of 8 cocktail hors d'oeuvers. Our waiter encouraged us to order a variety of items for sharing among a group of 8. Since sharing plates are appetizer size by American standards you will drop hundreds on a group dinner before you've even enjoyed a $10-$15 cocktail. I applaud the owners of this restaurant or pawn shop. Relatively lower rent, reduced food costs, high turnover, expensive drinks and that fake exclusivity feel to get patrons to talk about it and even return. I think Olive Garden is jealous. If you do go - the bone marrow is great and the meatballs are heavenly. The drinks are fairly tasty but the pours are not generous by NYC standards. Prepare for a loud and rushed night out.

4.0,9/5/2011,"I went to Beauty & Essex for dinner last night with a group of 5 girls. Based on reviews I'd read, I was expecting great decor and ambiance but the rest of the experience to be mediocre. I assumed  it would be another trendy, small plates hot spot. B&E exceeded my expectations! We arrived on time for our 8:45pm reservation and waited about 5 minutes to be seated. Just enough time for two girls in my party to get Ruby Red Mojitos.  They said they were good but not anything special. We were seated in a round table booth right inside the main dining room. We ended up a table away from some cast members from the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills which made for interesting people watching. Food: Very good and well executed but not mind blowing. We had:- Whipped Ricotta  ""Jewels on Toast"" ( light, interesting flavor profile)-Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos (good crunch but I've had better Poke)-General Tso's Monkfish (perfectly crisp, good flavor)-Griled Cheese & Tomato Soup Dumplings (very cheesy, not my favorite but loved my others in the group)-Lobster Mac & Cheese ( Missing lobster and enough cheese) -Brick Pressed Chicken (full of flavor, moist chicken, well done!)-Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs (to die for)-Vidalia Onion Rings (OK, could have done without)These desserts were the perfect sweet treat to end to our meal-Box of Dougnuts-Butterscotch Pot de Creme Noise level:  The noise level was pretty high which made it difficult to hear each other. We were a group of 24 year olds yelling like senior citizens. Service: our waiter was attentive. He wasn't  helpful in choosing menu items and couldn't give any solid personal recommendations which is a pet peeve of mine.  He did forget two items but when reminded we received them promptly and the flow of the meal wasn't interrupted. They promptly removed empty plates but not before we were finished with them and refreshed silverware, water, plates etc when appropriate. Between wine and food at dinner it was $70 a person. A little steep but we all left plenty satisfied. We ended out evening with a glass of free champagne in the ladies room!

4.0,9/3/2011,"One of the most amazingly disguised restaurant and lounge I had ever been to. In the area that it's located at, you wouldn't expect to see an elegant establishment around. You walk in and see a pawn shop, yep, you're in the right spot. Bouncer guy opens the door, and Wa-La!! Beauty is the decor. Let me walk you through the restaurant mentally. After you walk through the doors, behind you, the pawn shop, you are greeted by the host/hostess. Behind them are stair that lead to a second level of glamour bar lounging and a much smaller dining area. As you follow along the host/ess to your table, you pass another bar/ lounge area. Then you are in the dining area, along the walls are booth tables and center column are chair seating. Above is a glass ceiling looking through what I believe are apartment patios. Restrooms are downstairs. And if you've already read some of the reviews then you know that they serve free champagne, tips are welcomed. Perfumes available and lounge space. Food. Tapas style. Delicious and interesting all in one. Service: Host/ess 2 stars; servers: 3.5 seems they are selective with service. They came of as snobs. Yes, I said it, snobs. Tips: make sure your entire party arrives at the same time. You will not be seated until then. Warning: YOU HAVE A TIME SLOT! which means, your table is timed for the dining. Reason: they say it's because the place is so busy that they need to have it timed for dining. Overall it was a good experience. Service didn't bother me too much this time only because I was in a good mood.",2,0,0,Helena H.,"Los Angeles, CA",915,851,2816
2.0,9/1/2011,"This is an interesting restaurant.Outside:  Its exterior is a junk store.  Some would call it vintage, I call it what it is, junk.  Open the door to the junk store, and there you have it, overpriced junk that someone bough at a garage sale now being offered as vintage.  But, this isn't your regular Goodwill.  At the far end of the store there is a bouncer with dark glasses standing next to a large door.  Once you pass that interior door, things change.Inside:  Inside is a beautifully designed foyer with an adjacent bar.  Trendy.  The connected dining room is airy with a large skylight overhead that brings in lots of natural light.  Of particular interest is the mini-bar inside the women's restroom.  Free drinks in small flutes.  That's a nice touch.  Come early (6pm) because the place gets very busy.So far, the place exudes a fun trendy vibe that would be excellent for a first date.The food:  This restaurant is a tapas-like place.  According to the waitress, ""the food is meant to be shared.""  My take on such a statement is that tapas-like means the restaurant charges you $25 for chicken that would otherwise be a $10 appetizer.  The portions are truly miniscule.  (See other reviews).  The bottom line:  to have a nice meal you'll have to order 4-5 dishes, each at close to $20 a piece.  Think about this business model.  So far, not such a good place.  But, let's continue with the review.We are normally suspicious of a place that tries to make all things well.  There are tamales, seafood, Asian dishes, and steaks on the menu.  All of them good, but none of them great.  As an example, a steak costs $42.  It was not fully cooked, lacked a nice char, and not served on a sizzling plate.  In contrast, a good entree is the short-rib tamales.  Interesting.  Flavorful.  Decent price.Servers:  The service was solicitous.  The waitress was helpful with out drink orders and food selection.  Also, my water glass was always filled!  However, like other posts, the bus boys were overly eager to remove the plates, even when the food had not yet been fully consumed.So, why would you come here?  The vibe.  Period.  This is a fun, loud, happy place.  If you keep that perspective, and not set high standards for food, you will leave happy.  We did.  But that doesn't mean we're giving Beauty & Essex five stars.  The ambiance was great, the food and prices are so so.  We might return, but if we do, we will stick with drinks at the bar and eat elsewhere.",1,0,0,jones m.,"Princeton, NJ",1,33,3

3.0,8/24/2011,"Gorgeous entrance and interior. I like to walk past the pawn shop just to gaze inside. Lately I've eyed a pair of dazzling, sequined ""ruby slippers"" and a kitschy sign referencing turn of the century prostitution. The small shop in front and the skylit ceilings make the main dining room feel even larger than it really is, a very cool effect. There's a huge chandelier, fur on the walls, and champagne in the bathroom. It's all so cute, but I can see it getting old, really fast. I went for cocktails with friends in the lounge area upstairs and we ordered a few things. It took forever to get the attention of a waitress as the place was packed. We had the Pink Lady and Broken Blossoms, among a few others. Both interesting but nothing crazy. I enjoyed the cinnamon in my BB. All portions of food are uber small, which I find annoying, but it's tapas, so whatever. I guess I don't like tapas style. Very nice avocado on toast, but you can't mess that up easily. Chicken fried oysters were good. My friend who hates oysters actually like these, but I guess that's because they don't really taste like oysters. Pizzetta with apple and bacon was weird, and not in a good way. The crust was near paper thin and it was all way too hard and crunchy. Even the cheese. Dessert, the pudding/cake type thing in a jar definitely ended the meal well. Not sure if I'd go back and actually venture inside. We'll see.",0,0,0,Jessica D.,"New York, NY",196,82,0

2.0,8/22/2011,"Over a month ago, I went to B&E for dinner with two friends, trying it out and hoping to book phase 2 of my bachelorette party there. Service was amazing, food was divine and I booked at table of 6 for this past Saturday night at 1130p, for dessert and drinks. In the special note section, I wrote that we would be celebrating my bachelorette party and that we would be ordering dessert and cocktails.On Friday, I called and adjusted the reservations to 11p, and confirmed that everything was on the up and up. No problem at all.On Saturday when we arrived (at 11p sharp) a snotty hostess told me that they didn't have my table because they ""don't do reservations for like, dessert and drinks."" She then handed me a beeper a la Applebees in the 'burbs and said they would see IF they could do anything.My girls and I (some of which traveled for this party) hung out in the bathroom, drinking free champagne and I went back upstairs 15 minutes later, asking to speak to a manager. Because this was utterly unacceptable. I explained my frustration to the manager, who made it seem like I had screwed up. I slammed the beeper down on the counter and said I wanted a table NOW - that this was my bachelorette party and they were ruining it for me. That when I confirmed on Friday, no one mentioned anything about desserts not necessitating reservations. Surely they could squeeze us in since they had screwed up the reservations in the first place and had a policy that wasn't posted anywhere, but strongly enforced. I also through in there that they even had the table reserved with my credit card.They had us seated within 5 minutes but it was really clear that our waitress couldn't be bothered. She barely refilled our prosecco (I ended up doing it) and really didn't seem even remotely interested in uhm, providing service. When the bill came (35 minutes later), they comped the prosecco but still never apologized.

While the majority of patrons were dressed to the nines, there were quite a few fanny-pack wearing, I heart NY bag toting patrons as well.Most Unique Perk: Free champagne in the ladies room...The Food: Not bad.

Lots of interesting ingredients. The service: Now here is where I knocked the stars off. I'm allergic to cows milk and told my waiter straight off the bat. I ordered the Lobster Pizzette which had fontina cheese on it. My waiter said that they would be able to make it without the cheese, so I went for it!The pizza comes and there is clearly cheese on it. I tell the waiter and he explains to me that he told the chef no cheese... and therefore there cannot be cheese on it. he said I must be mistaking the onions for cheese, and walks away. A minute later, I discover that there is in fact cheese on this pizza.I call the waiter back and he takes the pizza away offering nothing for compensation. About 15 minutes later my table and I are offered a free round of drinks. Very nice (although, in my opinion, necessary). After we are done with our meal the waiter brought out complimentary desert because of the pizza mishap. Each and every  dessert had dairy. He brought out a POT DE CREME. Pot. of. Cream.

I actually had to spit out one of the chicken-fried oysters and we barely made it through half of the chicken meatballs. Dessert and cocktails were substantially better. We had a box of doughnuts and affogato shots for dessert, both of which were excellent.If I were to come back to B&E, which I'm not sure I will, I would return with a group of girlfriends. The ""funky tapas"" style food and small portions did not satisfy my boyfriend's appetite; nor was he pleased at the $200 price tag for 3 cocktails and 6 small plates between the two of us. In sum, recommended for cocktails and a light snack or dessert, but not for a full-blown dinner.",2,0,1,Emily N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0

The sleek interior crowned with a gorgeous skylight provided views to greenery and a sunny sky lightening the dining room. My girlfriends and I sat in a half circle banquette with great views of the entire restaurant - we ordered specialty cocktails, all of which were delicious and started ordering food right away.The hamaci was delicious, as was the beet, goat cheese salad... but my favorite were the cheese meatballs - light, airy, and delicately interlaced with ricotta cheese, they literally melted in my mouth - I was sad I had to share them with my friends. The seven layer chocolate cake - alternating with a cheese cake layer and covered in a shiny chocolate ganache was delicious and worth every calorie!!And the best for last...the Ladies Lounge, a true lounge plush with glass shelves, gold gilt mirrors, chandeliers and velvet couch, and free champagne!!

Upon waiting for my family I went to the bar to order a drink, hoping that the bartender would be cool enough to give me a drink just hours before I was officially 21. She turned me down, saying I'm not 21 yet. While I was disappointed, I quickly got over it and accepted the rule.So my family arrives and we sat down at the table. The waiter comes around and asks us for our drink order, he comes to me, I order a drink, and he DOES NOT ID ME. He leaves the table only to return about a minute and a half later requesting to see the ID of everyone ""under 30"".To make a long story short, he lied. The bartender who turned me down made it her prerogative to ruin my 21st birthday by telling my waiter I was a couple hours short of 21. Knowing this, of course my waiter could not serve me, but he was about to serve me underage with asking for ID, until the nasty bartender felt like ruining my birthday.",0,0,0,Michael R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0

Also there was a good amount of weird people there that just seem they was trying to hard to stand out and look cool. Not my type of place. Also the waiter got a few orders wrong for the people i was with and the food was ok.

His reply was, I just started i was not  here when you place your 1st order !

5.0,6/14/2011,"Very impressed. Came here with a group of 8 for my birthday this past Sunday evening. The upstairs was closed which was a bit disappointing but I was happy that the place wasn't as packed as it is on a Friday or Saturday. It's a phenomenal space, wonderfully designed with 2 levels of class and sophistication and it's not too pretentious. The cocktail list is divine, particularly the Cranberry Flower and Emerald Gimlet. The food is very good. We very much enjoyed the tomato soup dumplings, yellowtail crudo, filet mignon and pretty much everything else we ordered. The one dish we all weren't fond of was the tuna sashimi appetizer. It would have been better with a little sprinkling of sea salt and not the clashing flavor and texture of chorizo.The deserts were sublime as well. My one gripe is that as soon as we asked for the check, they swooped in and cleared the rest of our desserts, including the full box of donuts we hadn't even touched yet. I thought they should have offered to give us a to-go container considering we just spent a grand on dinner and drinks!The bathrooms are gorgeous and as everyone else has mentioned, offer free champagne in the ladies room - a classy touch to an already successful restaurant. I would return anytime for drinks, a small bite or a full dinner just so I can experience all of the different bar/lounge/dining areas.

WHY NO VODKA SHOTS IN THE MEN'S ROOM?In all seriousness, this tucked away (but certainly not hidden) establishment in the Lower East Side is one of the most fun I have been in the city. Hidden behind what I assume is a beauty pawn shop (a la ""Blind Bennys"" and ""La Esquina""), this lounge is one of the best decorated and sophisticated places I have been to in a long time. Chandeliers and spiral staircases make you feel like royalty, while the scores of beautiful women make you feel like a movie star. The drinks are middle of the road pricey at around $10 a drink, and the service is nothing to rave about, but the pros outweigh the cons in this one.

No lines or long waits either.  We had a reservation but there were plenty of open tables. I'm going to assume the music is different too. The tunes were pretty mellow and quiet, unassuming.  The hostesses were excellent. Waiter was competent though, strangely, he never smiled the entire time we were there. The food runners and bussers were great too. Some of the food was fantastic, a few were not great and all of it was OVERPRICED. Sorry, I didn't mean to yell but, really overpriced. Do not get the warm sticky buns. There were 3 for $9 and slightly larger in diameter as a dollar coin. That would be fine if they were melt-in-your-mouth amazing, but they were very dry and boring. The cornbread waffles were o.k. but totally upstaged by their maple-bourbon butter and spiced pecans. So so so delicious. Avocado toast was very good too. Skip the skillet roasted potatoes. You can get the same quality from your local diner. Not bad, just overpriced. The virgin drinks were over $10 each and tiny! They were a refreshing 5 sips though. It was a fun atmosphere for my teenage nieces and the look on their faces when entering was priceless. They really enjoyed the decor in the restaurant and the ladies room as well!

I tried the ruby mojito, which would be great if you wanted to drink Robitussin strait out of the bottle... which I don't. FAIL. We ordered a goat cheese and pear on toast appetizer... holler back, it was yum... but goat cheese and pear is always good.On to the lobster tacos which we were told to try... they were decent, but fried... not sure why lobster would have to be fried... but ok. Then we split the Branzino which was cut into 3 tiny pieces over some mashed potatoes in some gravy... needless to say that fish was not fresh, tasted wayyy too fishy. By the end of the meal, my fiance was having an allergic reaction to the lobster tacos. He's only allergic to shrimp, so either it was fried in the same oil... or there was shrimp stuffed into the lobster tacos somewhere. Little heads up there. By that point, we were completely over the place. To sum up- yes its beautiful, yes its' cool. I'd only come here for some drinks (not the Ruby Mojito), never the food... way overpriced and not so great.Our waitress was very sweet though, the hostess was very snooty and made us wait 25 minutes when were were 10 minutes early for a reservation.

Maybe we wanted to dunk bread or finish the little scoop of cheese left behind, sheesh!Dessert was eh...blueberry gratin with lemon ice cream was so tart and it left our  teeth blue for two days, throughout multiple brushings!All in all, fun time, bill was a tad more than expected, although eating in NYC usually tends to be an expensive night for us.",0,0,0,D D.,"Clifton, NJ",0,13,0

3.0,5/27/2011,"Before commencing my usual tirade I'd like to state that I liked this place and it had a nice décor. However, just because I like something doesn't mean I'm above degrading it.  Apparently to be exclusive nowadays you gotta get creative. So just in case anyone's wondering why you need to go through a pawn shop to get in I'm telling you the reason. I didn't really get a chance to see the downstairs because I went straight to the second floor via a spiral staircase that right away put me in the mood for romance. Unfortunately I have nothing bad to say about the food. It looked presentable, tasted good and most importantly didn't make me sick.  Same goes for the drinks. The music had a jazzy loungy vibe but just as I thought I had the style identified they started playing some hard core rap (which after a few drinks threw me off). The people were attractive but nothing to brag about-same as all the Manhattanites who like to go out and be seen. The only problem is the ogling; but if you like to be blatantly stared at, judged and gossiped about and have something to contribute in return then come on down. The best part for me was the unique/cool/weird jewelry display on the walls. I wanted to buy all of it and immediately informed the waiter (who in turn brought me a salad). Speak loud or face the same consequences. The pretentiousness doesn't end there. Just take a drunken walk down to the ladies room for a real shocker. Some bright idea man thought it'd be a nice touch to serve complimentary champagne in the ladies room (not men's) to class up the place. Maybe some people want to toast their success in the stall but the last thing on my mind when I want to pee is to drink more.

The cocktail list is just as well-done, though here, the inventiveness is a welcome success.It's tough to get in here for a night out, so if you're dying to go, just book a late dinner reservation.

This place was my dream boudoir come true, a place where I can play princess and my little pony games with fellow princesses. The space is softly lit and plushly textured, peppered with romantic french country accents, sparkly chandeliers and flickering candles. They even serve free champagne in the girls room! Completely seduced, I began to see everything through rose tinted glasses, and rationalized everything that I normally harshly judge. From the half wit hostesses to the forgettable, overpromised and overpriced food. But the one thing that even my glasses could not cover up, was the massive throng of young things grazing all over their markedly older companions while casting competitive glances at their peers. This place is as sceney as it gets and after a little while, all the sweaty people grinding on each other becomes less sexy and a lot more gritty. Once the beer (champagne) goggles were off, my romantic boudoir was starting to closely resemble a brothel salon.Come here when you need a sight for sore eyes, this place will not disappoint.

Yes it is pricey, yes the service is kind of lacking, yes it os crowded but I still say GO! (and make a reservations way in advance) The restaurant itself is also beautiful.  The one thing I don't get about this place is the music. They blast super loud club music in the dining room and bar areas. You have to shout. It's perplexing. Tip: I did go here for a drink once at like 5:30pm on a weekday and there was no loud music or mega crowd.",0,0,0,Miranda W.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,33,0
4.0,5/13/2011,"I revisited B&E a week ago. The increase to 4 stars is due to the food, which I tried for the first time. Like Stanton Social, they pack quite a delicious punch in their small dishes. We shared the fries, toasted bread with buffala and tomatoes, choco bread pudding, mini donuts and a few other things. Everything was delightful - but I think I'm partial to small plate sharing because I get to enjoy different tastes. Also, the cocktails are wonderful! I had a spicy one - forget the name - but it was one of the more satisfying well-made ones I've had (which is why I generally stick to red wine when out).",0,0,0,Kriti S.,"Hoboken, NJ",117,128,0
1.0,5/12/2011,"Beauty and Essex has great decor.... that's about it. A group of my girlfriends stopped there to start the night of one of their bdays. THE STAFF AT BEAUTY & ESSEX WAS SO RUDE. For people trying to get you to pay $15 per drink.... it's a little crazy how poorly they would treat patrons. For starters, ony of the girls dropped somthing from her purse. She bent down to get it and as she stood up, a waitress holding a tray yelled at her ""NOT SMART."" Then, one of the group members thought they did not get back their credit card when they closed their tab. They went to the bartender to ask, and security screamed at them that they could not be behind some line and to ""BACK UP!!"" It wasn't like we were some drunk, rowdy mob pushing people out of the way for a drink. It was one concerned 25 year old girl trying to figure out her credit card situation.The group of us sat down at a table and were quickly told that we were not allowed to sit, with no offer to find us another area or table. We were interested in buying a bottle, but we chose not to after the poor treatment.To top it off... the vibe of the rest of the crowd was rude. We had a camera out and were taking pictures of the group, and noticed a couple that was making fun of us for taking pictures. They did not realize we noticed, and the 5' guy came over to ""offer to take a group photo."" So immature.If you are looking for a good time, I would reommend to spend your night somewhere else.

3.0,5/10/2011,"I went with one of my good friends who is part of the Tao Group which is involved with Beauty and Essex. We were brought out more food then was necessary but it enable me to taste just about half the menu in one sitting. Please Note: (You will not find words like ""moist"", ""nom nom"", ""cheesy"", ""to die for"" in any of my reviews) Decor: 4 Stars The concept runs a very fine line between trendy and cheesy. The Pawn Shop is a novelty and after the first visit will lose its luster. The inside has a cool feel to it. I am not sure the layout makes much sense thou. You have to pile thru hoards of people at the bar to get to your table. I do like the music they played during dinner. The women's bathroom I am told offers champagne while you wait which is a classy touch. The upstairs bar and seating area might be a better atmosphere then the downstairs dining room. I liked how they always have a server around to provide you with what you need. Food: 3.5 I always prefer small plates over entrees when I go out because I love sharing. However, to master every type of cuisine is just not realistic. While everything was GOOD, I cant say anything was Great. And by great I mean it has me craving or plotting to come back for. The selection is good and caters to just about any type of eater. Everything was well cooked and presented very well. We probably had including dessert around 21 dishes. Below are some of the dishes I would recommend: *Ricotta Toast *Yellow tail Crudo *Lobster Taco *Chicken Fried Oyster *Wok seared Sugar Snap Pea *Roasted Bone Marrow *Devils Food Layer Cake *Chicken Meatballs *Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Creme *Molten Chocolate Bread Pudding ***Must Get:    Kale and Apple Salad Overall, I enjoyed myself and the vibe they had going on.

When I arrived at the restaurant, the poorly dressed hostess was rude, snobby, and kept telling me the wait would be ""15 minutes"". My friends and I waited an entire hour before being sat. -Ok, so maybe that's New York...I was hoping the food would make up for our long wait but sadly it did not.

It was way more than 290 ppl jammed in there based on the capacity sign on the wall. Our reservation was @ 9:45. We didnt even get to our table or should I say tables until 10:30. They gave us two tables We were confirmed  One large table.  Clearly NOT enough room for our party size. We sat down for the 1st time, my gf complained and they brought two baby tables to go btween the two large tables. We all had to get up again and stand around  bumping into other tables *no room* and wait for them to set the table again. At the end it looked like the kiddie table at Thanksgiving at your grandparents house. Still not enough room. My gf complained AGAIN! Two guests couldnt even sit down and our chairs were all against one another. We GOT UP AGAIN *2nd time*!!! They clear the tables and bring in this HUGE long table top. We sit down again and it is reset. By this time is 11:30!  What was really frustrating was that this was planned two months in advance with a contract and a guarantee on the amount of ppl, so management was well aware of how many ppl were going to be there. We were standing around more than enjoying her birthday. The food was crap!  For $128 dollars.. I got one curry covered shrimp, one end of domino's like pizza, two stems of broccolini, one slice of chicken a size of a chicken nugget, 1/8 a cup of lemon/pesto pasta, and four fries. WOW.. I have traveled to Barcelona and have had true tapas style food and this was just crap, over priced and over salted!!

1.0,5/1/2011,"If this site had stars with a minus next to it I would rate it that but I was forced to give it at least one star. One of my best friends had decided to have her birthday party there she had a signed contract and had planned everything months in advance. Due to the fact that we had 20 people on the reservation she was GUARANTEED a private room. All of us arrived at 9:30 only to be seated an hour later. The place is so crowded that our pregnant friend had to have one of the hostesses escort her because it is a hazard getting up the stairs to the dining area due to crowding. When we were finally seated there were two round tables that you would see at a kiddie party separated not the private room that was guaranteed. When the manager came over he was not willing to abide by the contract and said that it was by request not guarantee. However when she got home she read her contract and it was indeed guaranteed. My friend complained as this was her party and she wanted to have everyone seated together. They proceed to make us get up and combine the tables we still did not fit as we are standing there embarrassed as everyone was staring at us. Then they made us get up again and brought in a long table to which we still all barely fit and had to be squished like sardines while eating. On to the service.. The servers spilled water on me, dropped a knife one someones lap to which I remarked thank god that wasn't a steak knife and then dropped a plate on my lap without so much as an apology. The food was not even good at all after that you would think that would be the one positive but it was yet another disappointment. Also if you had to go to the bathroom you had to convince the bouncers that you indeed had a reservation so that they would allow you to re-enter the dining area. If you are looking to have a special occasion and a fun night this is NOT the place you are looking for.

Still, the hostesses were very accommodating and were able to score us a nice niche of couches. The lounge area is definitely conducive to mingling with your neighbors, too - I sat next to a pair of Australians and ended up sampling their chicken meatballs (that's what she said), which were awesomely delicious.

Service was muy excelente! Even though it was our servers very first table he had waited on (he was new), he was attentive, friendly, and enthusiastic.Of course, us gals headed to the restroom right after placing our orders.

A lady bartender handed us the infamous rose champagne and we sipped on it casually while engaging in idle chatter. Too bad all the seats on the couches were taken though! Women must be keeping all their dates waiting here. We felt bad keeping the one guy in our party waiting so we headed upstairs.Kobe Beef Carpaccio wasabi egg yolk, crunchy wontons, sesame nori: Ah, love that the meat went down well and there was no pungent taste to the rawness of the beef (as I experienced at other restaurants where I disliked the carpaccio *cough, Sprig)Dee-li-cious!Roasted Bone Marrow rioja braised shallot marmalade: According to someone in our party, bone marrow is healthy for you! If that is the case, I can finally devour fat (in the form of bone marrow). I always want to eat fat because it's so good (yes, disgusting), but fat rib on prime rib tastes so good. And, this was the case with our bone marrow dish-- tasted like savory meat fat but it was bone marrow fat and thus, even better to devour being able to have peace of mind our arteries were not being clogged! Basically, this dish is served with 5-7 mini bread toast slices that are perfectly buttered and crisp and you combine the bone marrow with marmalade atop to flavor it.Chicken Fried Oysters apple & bacon braised spinach: One bite into this, my gf uttered, ""This is SO GOOD!"" And, really, it just is. The crispness of the oyster and the combined flavors of the apple and bacon which complement the app ever so perfectly-- order this app, you will not regret it!Lobster Tacos beer battered maine lobster, red cabbage slaw, jalapeno crema: mmmm, fresh chunks of lobster and non-spicy jalapeno for us--- made me crave a lobster roll from Boston but still I felt satisfied to be eating this.Such a chill wonderful restaurant to lounge at with the sophisticated Lower East Side party folks. :) It's not crowded at all on a Tuesday night!

The bar was incredibly crowded between 11-1am, to the extent that I grabbed a table for bottle service after about 30 minutes in the squishy bar section to sit comfortably in the back of the upstairs lounge section.

4.0,4/10/2011,"I went on a Sunday with some girlfriends from work at the beginning of March knowing what I was getting into.  Despite being a Sunday, B&E is (of course) packed and we are handed a buzzer that will let us know when our table is ready.  I was fine with that, and let me tell you why:--Designed by AvroKO Design Firm, Beauty & Essex is a gorgeous monstrosity that has not one, but two bars; not one, but two levels, and a concept so amazingly simple (and gorgeous): Jewelry.  Each room is designed after a piece of woman's jewelry (i.e. The Pearl Room is a gorgeous lounge that has a canopy of white pearls dancing overhead, The Broach room has a mutlitude of women's broaches covering the walls, and The Necklace Room is delicately designed with a woman's neck in mind;).  So...It's beautiful.  I can wait while I'm standing in a beautiful space.--Complimentary bubbly courtesy of a delightful cocktail waitress...in the bathroom.  Yes it has been said MULTIPLE times by MULTIPLE women, but this is awesome. We spend so much time in the bathroom, gentleman (sometimes just looking in the mirror contemplating whether or not our shade of lipstick was the right choice),  that this is a real reason to stay.  Once again, gorgeous and beautifully lit (MTA did not do the light design, that is for sure), the counters have two sides--both obscuring eachother by large mirrors and a towering display of Perfume bottles (which, as we found out, because so many people tried to steal them, they were glued down...all but one:)--Find it if you dare)When we did get seated we walked through a crowded bar space to a low-lit plush round table and feast began.  Although we did get stuck with a waiter who seemed to know only little about the menu and seemed to dislike refilling our drinks, we enjoyed the tapas style portions and I would definitely recommend the seafood tacos--delicious!  The drink list is okay in comparison and when I eventually did get my second round (thanks to a waiter from another section), I found that the bubbly was perhaps one of the better choices.  The atmosphere as I mentioned before is very LES and did add to the evening (which does not always happen) and despite getting up-charged and forgotten by our waiter (who it would seem was working his last night...so sad), I would recommend an evening out to all.  And really, if any problems occur, the managerial staff is fantastic and very willing to help--completely worth it!",0,0,0,Norah J.,"Manhattan, NY",349,3,6

Next you walk through curtain draped over a doorway as if you were going into the back room of this pawn shop filled with boxes etc. but instead you find yourself standing in this huge foyer with a wide winding stair case to your immediate right which leads you to the upstairs bar and lounge area.

It was quite nice here because it was only us and a really nice, easy on the eye German bartender (mind you it was only 6:30) whose recommended drinks were all excellent. I forgot the bartenders name but she was awesome, fun to talk to and she even let us sample different things gratis. What I loved about the here drinks were they weren't your run of the mill mixed drinks they were carefully concocted using different and interesting ingredients where at the very least you felt you were getting your moneys worth. Before we left we did take the bartender up on her last recommendation which was the box of donuts which consisted of 8 small warm gourmet doughnuts. We weren't planning on eating anything here as we were going to dinner but one of the doughnuts had BACON in the title so for me it was a done deal and it was heavenly, they were all heavenly!  I thought this place was great, I can't speak for the food but the drinks and doughnuts were excellent and the staff was friendly.",3,0,0,Rohit J.,"New York, NY",95,151,353

And, that's just what it tasted like - like someone added cinnamon to a glass of fine tequila. It wasn't so good. So, I sent it back and ordered an espresso martini. The bartender told me that THOSE were not on the menu - she gave me a little attitude with that. I was actually embarrassed - was that some sort of faux pas?  My friend asked to see the wine list and tasted a couple of dreadful wines - she is a wine fanatic.I had the following:-Broccolini - tough! And no knife to try to cut it with.-Chestnut & ricotta ravioli - too complicated - if that makes sense. Not any distinct, memorable flavors.-Monkfish - I had a bite. No lovely monkfish taste. Tasted like cheap Chinese food. My friend, the wine fanatic, makes incredible monkfish.-Mascarpone polenta - that was my fave. Subtle and YUMMY.A third friend joined us and had picked up batteries for me along her way. I set money beside her on the bar - and the bartender picked it up. I explained that that cash was for my friend, yet the bartender claimed she didn't know what I was talking about.The drink that I sent back, remained on my tab. I can't say the bar staff was friendly.

Maggie, the cocktail waitress- who (barely) served us in the lounge, needs a serious attitude adjustment- as does the hostess with the thick bangs. Smile and be nice ladies! It'll get you a lot further, and more importantly, a bigger tip.Basil Gimlet is off the chain! Skip the salmon but not the beef carpaccio, lobster tacos or the bone marrow- it was fantastic! Forget about the desserts- nothing to write home about- just get another gimlet. DO NOT MISS the free champagne in the ladies room downstairs and closest to the front door (the server in the ""ladies lounge"" is 100% nicer and more welcoming than the two I mentioned before and she's down serving champs in the bathroom!!!)All in all, great vibe, awesome set-up, totally enjoyable and not overrated or overpriced for the latest trendy spot.

Every now and again I get in on the scene-y places and get to tickle my close-to-middle-aged Midwestern fancy.Because B&E is ever so fancy. It's true, the space is gorgeous, but it was hard to see all of the fittings for all of the masses of people and hair and heels and CHANEL in the dimly lit space. The joint was hopping! We had 9:15 rezzies and I fully expected to be seated at 11-ish. I was thrilled to get to the good stuff after waiting just a bit.I found absolutely not one complaint with any aspect of the meal. We ate a TON of food. I had the benefit of dining with people who've been there a few times already, so I was steered toward what they considered the solid hits. We also were guided by our super enthusiastic waiter who kind of reminds me of Chuck from Chuck's Day Off. He said that a lot of changes have been made from the early menu.Started off with the yellowtail crudo and some beef-carpaccio thing for the carnivore. Solid but not earth-shattering.Moved on to Jewels on Toast. Good God, people, get the pan con tomate and burrata if you don't get anything else. Amaaaaaazing! The avocado toast was also beyond fantastic. The whipped ricotta...yummmm...all were must-repeats.Chicken meatballs. Brick-pressed chicken. AND the General Tso's monkfish. Throw in a side of mushrooms for good measure. Hell, why not the onion rings too?? The ""mains"" totally put me over the edge; the chicken in the meatballs was soooo moist and light, not overwrought in the least. And the chicken with the roasted tomatoes...ohhhhhh...the monkfish was not crispy, but rather really soft and tender. And spicy. Ohhhhhhh...Are you kidding me? Of COURSE we had dessert! Got an order of Nutella doughnuts and an order of raspberry doughnuts. Jesus.The Bright Boy Martini started it all off and we had a nice red blend for the meal.Jesus.

But you have to be impressed by what chris santos did with it. I love the pawn shop out front opening to a HUGE secret space that transports you to the restaurant. it's like something out of Spies Like Us. I also like that the doorman didn't give us a hassle because we weren't with anyone on page six.The people are exactly what you'd expect from a scene like this; everyone laughing at each other's jokes and pretending to be unaffected and having the best time, while secretly keeping one eye on the other diners to see if they spot someone famous or if anyone's looking at them... or is that just my thing?as far as the food, overall I think I prefer Santos' other place the Stanton Social, but I was impressed by the kobe beef carpaccio - when the waiter said our meal was on the house we ordered another and paid for it. the pear ricotta toasts were 'okay', nothing great. and the yellowtail sashimi was good but not enough.good raspberry mojito - although i can make a better one - and a good apple pizza thingy, but if you go to a place like this, it's because you want to feel the electricity of the scene. it's a great place to go if you have no desire to speak to your guests as the music is incredibly loud.happy tmz'ing,df",1,1,0,David F.,"Jersey City, NJ",608,217,11

4.0,3/3/2011,"Theres so many elements to Beauty & Essex, so its hard to give a general rating.. but i'll break it down: IN SUM: I went for my (24th) birthday dinner with a group of 10 and planned on staying there all night for drinks n partytime. The food was great, but we ended up leaving 10 minutes after we finished eating. The bar scene there was very ""old rich guy"".. which I understand is appealing to a certain crowd, but not i... 1. RESERVATIONS: the girls on the phone were nice and accomodating. However, the entire party must arrive within 15 minutes of the reservation or else the table is up for grabs. This is a pain in the ass considering my friends are GIRLS and girls are often LATE. Thankfully, they held for me and didn't sabotage my birthday.2. BAR (downstairs): while waiting to get sat at our table, the cocktail waitress approached us with not even a trace of a smile, and made it clear that we were unwelcome in this sitting area because we were moving upstairs for dinner. She was nothing short of a BITCH. Totally unfriendly, totally rude.3. DINNER: our server was awesome. smiley, accomodating, patient (with a table of 10, things can get troublesome). I ordered a bunch of small plates for the table (the hits were the tomato tartare with quail egg, and the pear & ricotta jewels on toast) and then everyone ordered their own main course.. this method worked well for such a large party.. *they also brought a box of doughnuts and a piece of cake that was AMAZING DELICIOUS. i wanted to go back the next night just for another piece of cake.4. BAR SCENE: we finished dinner at around 9:30, and the bar was 3 rows deep. behind those 3 rows were tables and seats. and waiters/cocktail waitresses/busboys pushing through the crowd every 30 seconds. not enjoyable. the crowd was definitely older, nerdy (rich) men who were on the prowl.. and the female crowd there was definitely biting the bait. so i moved my party elsewhere.

The lobster tacos and the brussels sprouts stuck out in my mind as phenomenal fare and I will definitely eat them both again upon my next visit.  Do yourself a favor and try Beauty & Essex.",0,1,0,Todd S.,"Charlotte, NC",14,112,1

Once you're past the fake pawnshop you'll walk into a super trendy, burlesque-ish and posh area which opens to the dining room and then up the winding stairs you'll find a lounge with beaded chandeliers, super dim-lighting and real candles all around (actually, one of the guys in our group caught his jacket on fire...so beware!) On the night that I was there, it was definitely a 4:1 female to male ratio as Jane K. said, so GUYS - given the dim light and ratio - your chances are GOOD. I was in and out and only had one of the signature cocktails, the B & E Pink Lady which has gin, pomegranate grenadine, lemon and apple jack. Strong drink - they are not playing around!!! My friends drinks were pretty strong as well so you're definitely getting your $13 worth per cocktail. (okay maybe not, but that's what made me feel better about it.lol). The one issue, which was a bit crazy, the waitress gave my friend, let's call her Girl A, the wrong drink. That drink was Girl B's drinks but my friend, Girl A didn't know until after sipping it. Girl A tells waitress that there is a mix-up and she drank this drink. Waitress then takes the sipped drink and hands it to Girl B!!! YES!! It happened right in front of us! Foolishness..

I signed up for yelp just to write a review on this place.Heard good things about it so booked a table for 6 people on a Saturday night.  Secured a reservation for 10pm.  Wish I hadn't.  This place is absurd.  I was hoping for a sophisticated and elegant crowd - and some ""exclusivity"" on the inside.  Couldn't have been more wrong.  Hints - 1) Line outside 2) another line inside the 'waiting room)(yes - even with a reservation) 3) another line and a wait once we had checked in.  Let's talk about the noise level.  This place is a restaurant right? hmmm - looked and sounded more like a nightclub.  The people? Seems that those of us that live in Manhattan are already avoiding this place - I've not seen this much Bridge & Tunnel crowd in a while. Not even good looking B&T - think Jersey shore.   Exclusivity?  Absolutely none - the place was overcrowded and loud, and about as exclusive as terminal 3 at Heathrow.  I was embarrassed that I'd picked it for my visiting guests.  So - we eventually sat down at a round table in the middle of the dining room.  The music - Madonna, really? - was so f*cking loud we couldn't even talk.  Our fellow diners?  crews of 23 year old girls drinking, not eating, and dancing at the tables.  Christ on a bike!  WTF?  The food? Not bad.  The skylight above us - the only redeeming feature.  Did I mention the noise?  Summary.  If you live in Manhattan, then you should know better and steer well clear. Way too many places that put this zoo to shame.  Don't make our mistake.  If you are 23, think you are cool, live off the island, don't eat, like madonna, enjoy lines, don't care about conversation, love jersey shore, work out, dress up, etc then come one and all to the show.  Restaurant?

2.0,2/22/2011,"Does Essex girl mean anything to anyone over here? (I'm trying to devise an American translation... Not-so-wealthy-valley-girl perhaps? Someone (well-versed anglophile) please correct me I'd love to be properly educated with the appropriate lingo)In any case I'm dubbing this place... Beauty (salon) and Essex (girl)After reading the reviews about how ""beautiful"" this new neighborhood lounge was I thought I'd come check out the bar at least, only to be disappointingly affronted with what I can only describe as a trashy, miserably cringe worthy interiors nightmare on an alarming gigantic scale.The place is a whole block deep! Which feels especially expansive in the LES. You enter through a tacky pawn shop on Essex street (first indicative sign) into a beaded reception area which greets you with the option of taking either the sweeping spiral staircase (up past a 16 foot, panelized bleached cowhide wall hanging- yuk) to the lounge on the upper floor, or straight through to the ground level bar and restaurant area at the back.Z and I picked the latter as our poison and sat at the bar for a cocktail. I just couldn't feel comfortable there. Probably something to do with being unable to ignore the colossal cast bronze and bejeweled flower vine covering the entire wall opposite the bar, clashing the with seam studded velvet upholstered chaise-lounges and glittery, cheap chandeliers above.The bar was not impressively stocked- the same liquor bottles, few but only common brands. The cocktails- (after spying this not surprisingly) were dull. The bar tenders were friendly but looked as if they might have been filling in for the night after working a shift at Gristedes (bold blue attire included), and were not at all skilled in the drinks department.We tried to determine the crowd in attendance- maybe all those you would find at your typical Holiday Inn lobby? It wasn't fashionable in the slightest, and if some of the people there were- well I'm afraid they were hopelessly disguised with the enveloping bad taste. It would take something special to bring me back again.",1,0,0,Freya C.,"London, United Kingdom",152,377,30
4.0,2/22/2011,"Went here a couple of weeks ago with 3 of my girlfriends and we had a great time! Made reservations about 2 weeks in advance for a Thursday 7 PM reservation. The place is absolutely beautiful and like others have mentioned, you walk into what looks like a little ""pawn shop"" and don't expect to then walk into a beautiful multi-story restaurant. Our waitress (a perky, but not in an annoying way, blonde) was knowledgeable and friendly and the people watching throughout the entire restaurant was great. Good looking crowd ranging in different ages. The food was good, but not spectacular by any means. I think the food at Stanton Social is slightly better, although wouldn't go there for the food alone either. Of course the champagne in the bathroom is such a great perk!  All in all, I definitely plan on coming back.  I wouldn't go back for the food alone but just for the entire atmosphere and for a fun night with friends or your significant other.  Dress up and go here for a fun night, good drinks (at NYC prices) and you're bound to have a fun night, as long as you're not expecting an incredible meal.

2.0,2/21/2011,"A bit soon for a review update but after the glamor of the novelty, decor, and French 75 has worn off, I can clearly see the serious faults in this newbie restaurant on the LES scene.Still gorgeous as always, packed to the gills with females, my friend noted that this restaurant was designed as a woman's wet dream. Hm, beaded chandeliers, sparkling rosé in the restaurant/lounge downstairs...it's not so hard to decipher the reasons behind the 4:1 female to male ratio. But on to the reasons behind the rating drop: the food. It's hard to tiptoe around it. Of six girls sitting around a dinner table and a pretty good gathering of plates filled with various items, the only dish that was flavored correctly was the burger. While the lobster tacos had been a winner before, how the kitchen could taint broccolini (over salted, inedible and taken off our bill thankfully), meatballs (no sauce? bland), a frisee salad (tip: green croutons look like moldy bread), tomato tartare (a sour, fermented version of bruschetta?), and pizzette (a matzah cracker with asiago cheese microwaved on top) ... I have no idea.While it's so very good-looking, I do hope they switch their attention back to the food coming out of the kitchen. I can't recommend dating this beauty until they can offer the whole package.",39,15,9,Jane K.,"San Francisco, CA",4447,1217,1907
4.0,2/20/2011,"This place is kind of nuts. Went here with the boyfriend on Valentine's Day and wasn't surprised that the dining room was still packed out at midnight. We got some cocktails to start which were strong and sweet. We ordered the kale salad, chicken meatballs, brussels sprouts, apple pie with cheddar ice cream, and the star of the night, the doughnuts. The kale salad was oily but delicious, and the meatballs were super rich and decadent. Like everything else, the Brussels were super oily but a wondrous compliment to strong drinks. And finally, those pesky doughnuts that I couldn't stop eating... pumpkin, glazed, bacon... insane these flavors were. Even the chocolate doughnuts were delicious, and a good chocolate cake of any variety is not easy to come by.Food and drink aside, this place was a strange mixture of restaurant and club. We only spent time in the dining room, but apparently upstairs and downstairs has more of a clubby vibe, and is rumored to have free champagne in the bathroom which I seemed to miss entirely. The vibe is very glossy and shiny and new but with a funky sort of feel that comes with the whole secretive, club-behind-a-pawn-shop thing going on.

4.0,2/15/2011,"We went here after work one friday. When I tried reserving online the only able times available were 5:30pm and 11:30pm. So 5:30 was perfect for us . But I heard from others that all the times in between are booked for the next month. The sign outside is large and flashy and impossible to miss. You have to walk though a pawnshop, and there's a lady there in case you're confused and wondering if this was the right place. Once you step inside, you enter a completely different world. The decor is glamorous and ritzy. There's a huge chandelier hanging down over the stairs.  We were told that they were only going to hold our table for 15 minutes after our reservation. We got there a little after that, but getting a table wasn't an issue, though the girl did give me an attitude. At first our party of four was seated on the first floor, but we told them we weren't there for dinner, so they moved us to an upstairs area. The second floor was more of a loungy area.   It wasn't that packed when we were there. Our waitress was very helpful in suggesting drink recommendations. I thought the drinks were only just average.  I ordered the Pink Lady, nothing exceptional. And the same goes for the other drinks that I took sips of. We also ordered one or two appetizers. Don't get the onion rings. Not worth the money. It was like 8 dollars for like 8 giant pieces of onion rings. There was only one bathroom, so it was a hassle to go from the 2nd floor all the way to the basement. There was a lady serving champagne in the ladies room. Unfortunately they didn't have this service in the men's bathroom. So that was definitely a plus for the ladies. I would like to come back another time probably later in the evening.  This is definitely one of the more classy lounges in nyc.  Definitely a place to check out if you're into the pretentious and lavish scene.",1,0,0,Bonnie L.,"New York, NY",285,37,24

The food, service, ambiance, decor, and woman's bathroom are all perfection.the entrance through the pawn shop plays a role in the theme in the entire restaurant, jewelry is for sale on the walls! so fun..We must have ordered one of everything on the menu because food came out for days and days, so I can't remember all of it. suffice it to say I ate like a fat kid!!! It was all delicious. I did not have anything that wasn't  prepared well or not good in any way. most of what we had was a specialty dish with a unique flare. the only thing I wasn't excited about were the onion rings- I didn't have them so I can't say I didn't like them, I held off since I was already getting full- and needed to save room for sweets!the ""pot of cream"" is nirvana~ all the staff was friendly and helpful. It is a huge place and getting from the bathroom back to the table takes a hot minute- during the journey several hosts and servers take the time to ask if you need anything and give a compliment different from the one on the last trip to the ladies room.     There is one very good reason to take several trips to the ladies room and that is this; there is a bar in there that serves pink champagne on the house! my girlfriends and I sat on the plush sofas drinking our bubbly and forgot for a moment we had a man waiting patiently for us to return to the dinner table:) after dinner we went up the long winding staircase to the lounge under a pearl chandelier that covers the whole ceiling. in addition to this room there is a DJ booth and another table seating room with walls covered with lockets that are or sale.of all the drinks ordered at our table my favorite was the golden peacock- hands down.... it tastes as if its good for you and something you should have with breakfast. it is made with vodka, sake, pineapple, mint and cucumber..... so good",1,0,1,T L.,"New York, NY",6,65,5

3.0,2/10/2011,"I am torn if I should even write a review on Beauty and Essex. It was such a quick/strange experience that it's hard to rate it, but let me try.....So as you probably know, as soon as you walk to the location of this restaurant, you see a pawn shop. You have to actually walk into the back of the pawn shop to where there is a man waiting at a door. You tell him your name and if you are ""on the list"" you can get in to the actual restaurant. Once you walk in you are overwhelmed by this very lavish two story restaurant. Everything decorated to a T. There are mirrors and flowers everywhere, not to mention the largest chandler I have ever seen and a Champagne bar in the ladies room.Our reservations were at 9:00, but we were told by the hostess that if we get there early, we would be seated by 8:30. So needless to say, we got there around 8:00, received our beeper (a real one, not that crap you get at Outback), and headed straight to the bar. Two drinks and 45 minutes later we were still not seated. We started to get a bit concerned, since we had reservations at a comedy club across town at 10:30, so my bf decided to go and ask what the hold up was. Of course the hostess didn't know what to say, other than we will seat you shortly. 9:00 came and when. Then at 9:20 we went to ask again, because at this point if we were not seated then we had to leave. Thankfully we were next on line and were walked to our table. Now since we had to be out of there in basically 40 minutes, we ordered and ate very quickly. Everything was tapas style and pretty tasty, but then again since we were rushing, I don't think I got the full effect of the flavor of the food. I can't even remember what I ate, since the experience was so fast! I do remember that I loved the sea salt and vinegar fries, which we had to take to go since we couldn't eat everything fast enough.If I ever go again, I will make sure to give myself plenty of time to get seated and eat, since they are not very good at keeping to their reservations.",1,0,0,Crissy H.,"Warwick, NY",150,675,52
4.0,2/9/2011,"This place is a dining experience! I was skeptical of the over the top decor/ ambiance- it has the air of being gimmicky- secret entrance through a ""pawn shop"", super loud music blasting hip tunes- actually the music was loud enough to almost be a deal breaker- but there were some serious hits on the menu and having had the opportunity to try almost everything from it I would like to impart some recommendations. From the Apps: Tomato Tartare w/ Sunny Side up Quail Egg, Classic Pan Con Tomate w/ fresh Burrata, Whipped Ricotta w/ Griled Pears, Kale and Apple Salad, Chicken Fried Oysters, Lobster Tacos (skip the Lobster Dumplings), From the Mains: Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs w/ truffles, Pan Toasted Torchio (fish), Brick Pressed Chicken, and Crispy Hominy (side dish). The Ravioli were meh and the Tuna was blech.The best of the desserts: Blood Orange Merengue Tart (light and refreshing) and the Devils Food Cake with Marscapone (everything you could ever want from dessert. Skip the donuts- while a bacon donut sounds interesting enough to order them it wasn't tasty. Bacon Brittle is much better tasting in my book.I skipped the cocktails and went right for a moderately priced bottle of California Pinot Noir recommended by the server. Their were some excellent dishes on the menu and the ambiance is great for a large party, impressing some out-of-towners, or a hot date.

3.0,2/7/2011,"I didn't trust the restaurant that much to make a full-fledged dinner reservation, so we happily sat in the bar, ordering and sampling small dishes. Our lounge had spacious leather couches, a gorgeous ceiling covered in pearls, and a view of a lavish chandelier descending in the center of a sweeping staircase. What a feast for the eyes! I was ready for a similar feast for my palette. Funny thing - around 7pm, the music in the lounge got so loud that there was barely a difference between us and a dance club at 2 am. ""Excuse me, can you please turn the music down? It's not even 8 o'clock yet, I can't hear myself think! I'm not even drunk enough to raise my voice. This is not the right time for incoherent screaming, sir. I am saving my energy for that later, so please don't be my party popper"" I told the waiter.The cocktail list at Beauty & Essex is populated with gourmet mixed drinks, and designer prices to match. Um, unless you are Apotheke, please don't serve me $15 cocktails, and even then, after having 5, they all start tasting the same to me. There should be a rule: after 3 cocktails, we'll be served vodka+cranberry only. After 7, we'll be served served pure vodka. Advice: forgo all cocktails (unless you are at Apotheke or Bemelman's Bar), go for a good bottle of wine instead. Cocktails are too expensive, loaded with sugar, and will contribute to your hangover the next day. A nay nay.The food: well, let's just say that the best thing on the menu was the fresh burrata on a toast with tomato puree. Simple, elegant, and always a winner. Other dishes were tasteless, soggy, and forgettable. Especially the delicious-sounding lobster bisque dumplings: a soggy fired ball with explosive cream juice (bisque) - a little phallic, and less exciting than the real thing. All the signature dishes were a let-down; no one remembered anything we ate, and the only evidence I have are my pictures. The menu prices hardly reflect the quality of food - I am sure the priced are marked up to pay for all those pearls, chandeliers, and free champagne.The best part of the night was definitely the free bathroom bubbly - yes, it is bizzarre, but the ladies flock to champagne like bees to honey. Before you know it, you are stumbling down those dangerous stairs for another fix of sweet sugar. If you are smart, you will stick to your one cocktail, and get filled up with booze in the powder room. Unfortunately, men do not have that luxury. Why? Maybe because they are in cahoots with the restaurant, and want to see their women lose & wild upon the final exit. Mission accomplished!In the end, you may argue that I haven't ordered enough entree dishes - what about the burger, the chicken, and the bone marrow, you say? Well, the best burger is at The Diner, the best chicken is roasting in my own kitchen, and best marrow is at Minetta Tavern. I wanted to try new things, house specialty things, and all of them were less than stellar. I won't go back for food, but for ambiance and drinks - you bet! Besides, who doesn't love pearls floating in the ceiling and free booze in the loo?!Chicken Fried Oysters apple & bacon braised spinach - meh.Blood Orange Meringue Tart - good.Classic Pan Con Tomate with Burrata - excellent.Sashimi Of Tuna - meh.Lobster Bisque Dumplings - a no go.Box Of Doughnuts - wierd, but ok.",1,0,0,Alessia E.,"New York, NY",81,167,47

First of all, it is so great that such an establishment is now open in LES typically known for lowkey hipster small joints.

The front room looks like a vintage shop but when you walk into the ""secret"" door, you see the spacious first floor and a beautiful chandelier and a spiral staircase leading upstairs. I thought second floor was much more impressive in terms of decor than first. First floor is a drinks-only sort of space while second floor is a full on restaurant.

I was enamored by talk of the decor, free champagne in the bathroom, as well as the intriguing pawn shop on the outside. When I arrived, I fell in love with an inviting entrance as well as the overall initial mood. The hostess was friendly and our waitress was exceptional. Overall, I enjoyed being there and I give it three stars because I believe that it is will evolve into itself. Right now, it's attracting a lot of scenesters and has a bit more of a 'club' vibe than a lounge (which I wasn't expecting) The music was to loud at dinner, the food was good, but not GREAT, and the free champagne wasn't available into the bathroom when I got there.I see great potential for this place because I did love the general atmosphere, the concept of it, the decor and menu.",2,0,0,Katie Q.,"Chicago, IL",21,37,0
5.0,1/27/2011,"This place is tip-top, and deceivingly huge once you walk in.  I've been there twice, and with each dish felt like there was a little party in my mouth, everything we ordered was ridiculously good.  My favorites are spaghettini, tomato tar tar with quail egg, and the meatball dish.  The drinks are also top shelf, I've gotten the tequila martini and the earl of the pearl (think ive got the name wrong) which is a little on the fruitier side but still bangin.  Its expensive, but worth it.  Its a cool scene, great music, good vibes, and some good looking bebez walking around to boot.  I hope it stays cool and too many people dont find out about it, but with each new review and added hype, its inevitable.   Whateva.",1,0,0,Ryan S.,"New York, NY",33,81,14
1.0,1/27/2011,"This review is for the bar only. I'd like to come back at some point and try the food, but the bar? No thanks. First, there was a line outside that was excessively long and not really moving at all. Just before we were about to give up and leave, we got in. However, after being unable to even get to the bar to order a drink because it was so crowded, we made a trip to the bathroom for our free champagne and chatted on the couch for about five minutes before deciding to just leave. Beauty & Essex is trying to be too many places at once. It felt clubby, but there was really no music and absolutely no dancing. Then, there is this separate restaurant section which is really just kind of confusing for the space. There's nowhere to sit unless you're at the restaurant, and I'm not really into standing around with a drink just to be seen.",7,3,3,Megan C.,"Novi, MI",207,150,4
4.0,1/26/2011,"My companion suggested grabbing a couple drinks here the other night.  We walked up to what appeared to be an old pawn shop, but after stepping inside, I was shocked at how massive the space was.  The decor is very extravagant and over the top.  Good looking, well-dressed crowd...I'm still wondering where the girl in the sequined cocktail dress was heading on a Monday night.Cocktails were $13, we had two each.  They were really well made and delicious.  I had one tequila based drink and one vodka based drink, and I enjoyed both of them very much.  Didn't have any food, so can't comment on it, but the menu seemed pretty eclectic and prices seemed reasonable.Service was really great.  Hosted smiled and greeted us as we entered.  The waitress was very attentive, helpful, and beautiful.  I like to think I usually look presentable when I'm in public, but due to the EXTREME cold weather, I had opted for comfort and warmth over style, and was admittedly a bit underdressed.  Fortunately, I didn't feel like anyone was looking at me with disgust.I'm not sure if everyone would love this place, but I enjoyed myself.  It's the kind of place you'd maybe bring an out of town friend who loves ""Sex and the City"".  I'd say I'll probably be back sometime soon.",0,0,0,Jeff R.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,35,0
4.0,1/25/2011,"I was first taken here by a friend for dinner and drinks. We entered through a faux pawn shop and into this beautiful abyss. We ended up sitting at the bar and ordering dinner. I initially excused myself to the ladies bathroom below to adjust my much too tight bandage dress and found my way to the champagne station in the corner. I downed a glass and proceeded back upstairs and ordered a pink lady. Food and drinks ensued and people started to saunter in, mostly couples on dates and groups of 2-3 guys. Food was great according to my friend and all the plates that passed under my nose looked tres delectable.It was here that I had the pleasure of experiencing my most favorite bottle of pinot noir thus far...Ant Hill.

4.0,1/25/2011,"Oh sooo pretty! I love this new spot...from the pawn shop entrance to the gorgeous decor inside, it's completely different than anywhere else in the city right now. I thought about coming here with a guy, but my roommate kindly pointed out that this is a great place to go with girlfriends, especially because you want to lounge in the ladies room for a minute while you sip on your (complimentary) champagne. So a girls night it was and it didn't disappoint! This place has become popular so quickly that reservations are a must, I recommend late night dinner reservations...we did 11:30 and it was perfect. As for the food, everyone loved theirs. I opted for the burger with goat feta which was delicious...however the real winners seamed to be the lobster tacos (which my friend still raves about) and the kobe beef carpaccio. Also, be sure to try some of the accessories (aka appetizers) or jewels on toast (crostini).

2.0,1/23/2011,"restaurantbrat.comIt was to be an AvroKO weekend, as after brunch at Double Crown, we ended up at Beauty & Essex for dinner and drinks. Oh, how I wanted to love the place - foodie and party-loving friends alike had been raving about this new kid on the block for weeks, and Chef Chris Santos had done good things with the Stanton Social, one of my early New York haunts. And true to form, first impressions of Beauty & Essex were promising - hidden entrances always lend an exclusive mystique, and upon passing through the guarded door at the back of the faux pawn shop exterior, the cavernous space was breathtaking, a multi-storied shrine to old-world luxe, gold and gilt interspersed between mirrored surfaces, with a dramatic spiraling staircase wrapped around a veritable crystal waterfall of a chandelier. The vibe was perfect: the people were pretty and the drinks were strong; the dark, romantic atmosphere in the dining room gave way to a more lively, albeit sophisticated, buzz upstairs. Lithe lovelies in slinky cocktail dresses emerged from the ladies' room with glasses of complimentary champagne in hand. And the hostess told me she loved my vintage Paul Smith bowtie. Off to a good start then, I thought.An amuse bouche of Caesar's Salad Bites arrived first. The toasted croutons were crispy and brittle, the julienned vegetables that lay atop of them cold and creamy - the little hors d'oeuvres paired well with my Essex Sour Blush, a spicy potion that showcased the lovely booziness of Woodford Reserve Bourbon. A dash of Barolo Chinato added a luscious sweetness, tempered by a mild acidity from a fruity sour mix. A good cocktail, that tasted like syrup and smoke, tickling the senses in the most delightful manner. A plate of Yellowtail Crudo arrived next, and as lovely as the plate looked, the taste left much to be desired. Caramelized yuzu oranges overpowered the poor, delicate slivers of fish, and whatever taste of the amberjack that was left after the explosion of citrus was masked by oversized chunks of avocado and an overenthusiastically saccharine glaze. Just in time, a lovely Pan Con Tomate arrived (from the cheesily-named ""Jewels on Toast"" selection), served with what can only be described as amorous slabs of burrata cheese. These oversexed bruschetta slices were very good, bursting with juicy tomato flavor and all the rustic sunshine of an Italian countryside meadow. The burrata was a revelation: creamy and light in body, yet firm in taste - this was less cheese than it was an exquisite milky pâté.    Then an order of Banh Mi Springrolls. Highly recommended by our server, but quite simply - an inedible mess. They were advertised as containing char siu pork and cilantro, I tasted neither, and even copious scoops of the accompanying Sriracha aioli were not enough to mask the filth. The insides of each vile tube seemed filled with mush and bits of old shoes. I could not get them out of my sight soon enough. Short Rib Tamales arrived in tandem, so I moved on to those with a thankful vigor. Turns out the tamales were but the lesser of the two evils. Overly braised, with a grainy, almost sandy texture, and drenched in a sickly sweet sauce, the entire speckled, watery dish was alarmingly reminiscent of diarrhea.  Cooked in stale leaves.We moved on to Chicken Fried Oysters. While a step up from the previous two dishes in quality, I found myself crunching on the heavy layer of batter and breading that encased each bivalve and wondering why anyone would subject as subtle-tasting a creature as an oyster to such a preparation. All I tasted was the fried breading - a pity, as what one really wants to taste when ordering oysters is that pure, saline seabreeze which so characterizes the little mollusks. What a terrible waste of perfectly good oysters. Lastly, to finish off, we had a pot of Veal Garganelli - spicy veal Bolognese pasta with whipped ricotta. Finally, a good, hearty dish that I could really get behind. The neon-yellow, slug-shaped tubes of garganelli were not as al dente as I would have perhaps liked, but the sauce was meaty and savory, helping cover up any deficiencies in the pasta. I tossed in a pinch of roasted chili flakes and shoveled away - happy that at last I had been released from my springroll/tamale-induced hell. Sadly, Beauty & Essex, even the dishes that worked for me did not quite get there for others in my party, and one of my dining companions pushed her portion away, decrying the liquefied ricotta as way too gamey for her liking.I was disappointed with my experience at Beauty & Essex, but that was solely due to the food. Given that the place looks destined to stay a NYC hotspot for at least a little while longer, and given that I don't have a choice but to be seen at NYC hotspots, I'm sure I will find myself back at some point in the coming weeks. Next time, I'll stick to the drinks.",11,5,5,Bryan T.,"New York, NY",345,45,69
3.0,1/23/2011,"I have a feeling this restaurant will be pretty polarizing for many, with many arguments over style vs. substance. Very similar to how I felt after dining at their sister Stanton Social. This is the kind of ""fabulous"" New York place that Carrie and friends want to portray on TV. The venture itself is heavily marketed at young ladies (items on the menu classed as ""accessories"", many sweet cocktails). Inside, the setting is immaculate and modern, with a huge chandelier at the entrance, and a large open airy dining room. Perhaps the play on ""Beauty and Excess"" is exactly the point, a tongue and cheek play on its own pretentiousness? I hope so. While the food is good (and better than I expected), overall the place is a massive scene/wanky and ultimately I did not consider it good value. With a group of six having a cocktail each, solid amounts of wine and our food, our tab was $160 per person, which I consider expensive. As is common with trendier ""small plates"" places, it is difficult to predict how much food to order for the group, because the offerings/sizes do not conform to the standard norms of appetizer/entree. Our waiter recommended 2-3 dishes per person (group of six).... we chose two each and it ended up being too much food. I don't appreciate it when the waiters aren't more help at navigating a menu like this. Overall I'm not sure if I'll return.",5,0,0,Mike E.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,46,3
5.0,1/21/2011,"""Sex in the Mouth"" - that's the title of the review, but have to admit I stole it from our waiter, Joseph.  That's how he described our tomato tartare with quail egg, and he was quite correct.  From the moment you walk through the pawn shop, into the vast bar, then restaurant space - your senses will be overwhelmed.  The restaurant is in a gorgeous space - love the skylight; have to wonder about the history of the space because it's a gem in NYC.The drinks were fantastic - recommend the Zacapa Mojito and Ketel One Gimlet drinks on the cocktail list.  Stick to the drinks - no need to head to the wine list.  BUT - make sure you head to the ladies powder room, and tip the champagne lady well to get a nice big glass (or two) of champagne.  What a brilliant idea.The food was all great - get a variety from each area of the menu and you will be pleased.  The tartare, tamales, spring rolls, ravioli and rich truffle chicken meatballs are good reccos.  My friend was in town for a fashion trade show and recommended this place to all the other locals!  Not often we rave about a place as much as this one.",1,3,0,Stacey N.,"San Francisco, CA",13,18,16
4.0,1/20/2011,"Plenty of buzz about this place in the last few weeks, and ""in the know"" friends had suggested trying it several times of late, so low and behold I wound up at Beauty and Essex twice last week.  Occasions:  Wednesday night for drinks, Sunday night for dinner.Initial impressions:  Pawn shop entrance will either delight you or make you think this plae is awkwardly weird.  I fell into the former camp - I dig pawn shops, even ones that don't offer any items I want to buy.  Once you enter into the waiting area, you'll probably notice the enormous chandelier over your head.  I'm not an interior designer, but I thought it was impressive, and in general I think the decor of the restaurant is interesting and tasteful.  Definitely a pro.  Food and drink:  The cocktails here are good, but not amazing.  This probably isn't surprising if you've been to Stanton Social, or if you're measuring it against the best speakeasy's and other good drink establishments in the city.  That said, I enjoyed my cocktails and the wine list is solid, if a bit overpriced.  Try the Bierzo red wine - it's an up and coming region in Spain, and while the bottle if overpriced, it's still one of the best values in the restaurant.  Food was generally solid, though there is some unevenness to it.  The apple pizza was quite good, as were the salt and pepper shrimp (though they are quite salty, so be warned).  Lobster tacos are fine but probably aren't worth the price, and the chicken meatballs are overrated.  The ravioli was good, and the polenta was above average for places like this.  Service:  Again, solid but not amazing.  Scene:  Excellent.  Other reviewers have noted this, but this is a place to see and be seen.  There will be a mix of yuppies, hipsters, and random assorted passerbys looking to check out the latest ""cool"" place they've heard about.  This is not a place to bring your SO for romance and privacy, this is a place to bring friends, eat, drink, and be merry.  If you're up for that, then you've made a good choice.Overall - for the right occasion, this is a good choice.  Dinner with a reasonable bottle of wine and plenty of food ended up going for about $70/person, which isn't bad at all in this town for this kind of scene.  Enjoy the ambiance, flirt with an attractive diner seated next to you, and you'll have the makings of a solid night out.",0,0,0,Erick H.,"New York, NY",2,9,0

5.0,1/17/2011,"As a fan of the Stanton Social, I really did not expect Chris Santos' new restaurant to be able to top that for me.  I am a great fan of the ambiance, the bar upstairs and the food.  Here however, at Beauty and Essex, they have taken the meaning of the word NY Scene to a new level.  I was immediately taken aback by the sheer size of the place.  There was an upstairs, a downstairs with a lovely women's restroom serving champagne, and a large dining area on the main floor.  We got a beeper so they could find us, and admired the absolutely stunning chandeliers while we waited.  The decor is fabulous, and the music was also very upbeat, putting us in the mood for a fun night ahead.  As with every dinner with Chris, I was super excited, but knowing that Chris Santos was upping the anty with this one made the wait all the more enticing. We met Chris Santos himself, who had us moved to our table in the back of the main dining room immediately.  It was a half moon booth that was cozy yet comfortable and still gave us a great view of the whole dining room.  The chandeliers, the lighting and the beautiful people were all duly noted.  Our server Tim appeared with the menus and we immediately got to ordering drinks.  The drinks here, I have to say, are even better than the Stanton.  I had the flu (that's how dedicated I am, I came with the flu), so I sampled two cocktails, but the table was thrilled with everything from the Ruby Mojito to the Earl the Pearl.  The food however, was beyond delectable.  We were started off with a ceasar salad crostini that was the perfect prelude to what was to come. We entrusted Chris to ordering, and I am so glad we did; however, between him and Chris Santos' generous offerings ensuring we did not miss anything on the menu, I really was in foodie heaven.  To start we had the tomato tartare, the sashimi of tuna, tonnato style, the oysters (yum!) and the yellowtail crudo.  I cant say what I liked best, but I can tell you that the sashimi of tuna is something I did not know they could do with food.We then had the whipped ricotta and hoeny crostini as well as the roasted bone marrow.  That was the definition of what I want to eat before I die.  Perfectly roasted, insanely rich, wonderfully decadent.  Then came the general tso's monkfish, the brick pressed chicken, TWO plates of ricotta chicken meatballs, the lobster bisque dumplings, the lobster tacos and the garganelli with spicy veal bolognese.  The dumplings, the tacos and the meatballs were unbelievable.  I cant wait to go back and order everything again, but those were just something else.  At this point we were beyond full, and contemplating saving dessert for another day, when three plates of dessert appeared in the hands of our trusted Tim.  With much dedication and diligence we reached the bottom of the pot de creme, while the devils food cake was demolished.  The chocolate coconut bread pudding was my favorite, so I attacked it while everyone else was distracted.Overall one of my favorite new spots, and cant wait to come back for Maha's birthday on Thursday!",3,1,3,Lama B.,"Brooklyn, NY",229,592,50

3.0,1/15/2011,"If you find yourself confused because you're standing in front of a pawn shop, don't worry.  Just walk right in, browse at their wares if you want, but make your way towards the back, past the cashier and through a big door to one of the largest restaurant spaces I've ever seen in New York.  Inside, the rhythmic beat of pumping music mixes the vibrant buzz of conversation from your typically good-looking Lower East Side crowd to fill the former furniture warehouse.  The menu, while may be not as expansive as the space, presents a large variety of tapas style dishes.  The two most notable were the tomato tartare and the black-bottom butterscotch.The portions here are small and a bit pricey.  Some were delicious while others fell short of their potential.  The meal started and ended on a high-note with a few ups and downs along the way.  The tomato tartare ranks amongst one of the most interesting dishes I'v ever tried.  Chef Santos replicates the flavor and texture of steak in vegetable form.  Each of the four bite-sized servings are topped with a sunnyside quail egg which smooths out and adds a nice finish to each morsel.  For dessert, the pot de creme might sound boring but it was simply amazing.  Underneath the creamy butterscotch custard was an exquisite dark chocolate ganache.  Both elements are deliciously rich but the slight bitterness of the ganache balances well with the sweetness of the butterscotch.  The roasted bone marrow was good but the rioja braised shallot marmalade - sweet savory and sticky - makes the dish.  Another plate that held it's own was the short rib tamale served with a dark chili sauce.  It could have used a little more meat and the sauce could have used more kick but overall the tamale was pretty moist and flavorful.  The hamachi crudo wasn't bad but nothing to write home about.  And as previously mentioned, there were a few dishes that fell short.  The lobster tacos and oven baked chicken meatballs were both insipid and bland.  The lobster was a bit overcooked and deep fried in a pretty thick batter that overpowers the meat.  And I did not enjoy the awkward texture of the chicken meatballs.While the food may leave something to be desired, Beauty and Essex does provide a unique and fun dining experience.  So if you're not overly hungry and in the neighborhood it may be worth stopping by for a cocktail, a couple of small plates, and some people watching.stayfattyny.com",0,0,0,Calvin L.,"New York, NY",53,11,1
3.0,1/14/2011,"I'm loving the small plate phenomenon that is hitting New York. It's like the city is finally declaring that size doesn't matter - that the whole ""entree"" idea shall now be obsolete. It's vogue, and socialites love it. Clearly, one Stanton Social wasn't enough, they've opened a new place (also in the LES) that unabashedly revels in its own pretentiousness. A truly eponymous establishment: the walls are lined with peacock plumes, the people are young and fabulous, the entryway hosts the biggest fucking chandelier I've ever seen, and the menu offers no no, not ""side dishes"" but ""accessories"", like ""my dress was kind of plain, so I touched it up with some broccolini."" Don't get me wrong, I loved the unbridled narcissism. It was exactly what this place intended to convey and I think they pulled it off very well. Food and drink were excellent, though we may have been slightly better off ordering a few different menu items.

Unfortunately, the food was just so-so for me - I adore Stanton but I think this place is still working out its ""kinks"" in the menu. Some of the things we ordered was delicious - their quail bruschetta is so yummy! But other items seemed to need some improvement - we ordered pasta that was pretty tasteless/soft and had to ask for extra crushed red pepper and parmesan to give it more flavor.

5.0,1/11/2011,"Beauty & Essex is the new, swanky sister restaurant to the LES' revered Stanton Social. This luxe, palatial cathedral of excess is the transformation of the old M. Katz & Sons Fine Furniture that stood on the premises of 146 Essex Street for decades. The trendsetting team of Chef Chris Santos, Rich Wolf (Lavo) and Peter Kane (Happy Endings) completely gutted out and gloriously recreated this monolithic space into a cavernous 10,000 square foot mecca of opulence. The clever faux pawn shop front entrance leads one to a soaring, Tara-like staircase entrance adorned with a glittering two-story beaded chandelier. This place, in a word, dazzles! Upon arrival, the lobby had a bustling, carnival atmosphere. The restaurant can host 300 guests between both the dining rooms and the bar and lounge crowd. There must be at least 150 meticulously managed staff members working here on any given night. Chef Santos divides his time between expediting the kitchen service and welcoming the masses upstairs. The hosts checked us in and then handed our group a vibrating pager unit. At first, this seemed very ""Outback Steakhouse"" to me. But, then I realized they must use this system, otherwise, guests might never be corralled among the scrum of revelers. After a wait that was minimized by the assistance of management, we were escorted into the rear first floor dining room passing the packed Baccarat crystal lined bar surrounded with the random Guccis, Pradas, Helmut Langs, and Hugo Boss'. We then proceeded to plunge into a comfy half-moon banquette. This gave us a full view of the chic, yet elegant design implemented by the folks at AvroKO (Public, Double Crown). All of the smaller tables for two each have their own mini-chandeliers above their respective perches. A glass ceiling hovers centrally over the room allowing one to peer up into the Boho nighttime sky. Peter Kane's cocktail menu is a whimsical selection of suave concoctions like the herbal Earl (Grey) The Pearl Cocktail and the interesting Cinnamon infused Tequila Broken Blossom ($13). My friend Tod went with the potent Spanish Rioja ($13) and I chose the French Malbec ($14) to jump start my evening. I knew we were in for a marathon when Chef Chris sent out a crisp amuse of Caesar Salad Crostini on the house. My four dining friends entrusted me in choosing the menu; a bold gesture I thought. But, I was up for the challenge. The tapas parade of multi-ethnic decadence began with a trio from the Raw Bar. The Yellowtail Crudo with Caramelized Citrus Yuzu, Avocado and Cilantro ($15) was ocean fresh! Half a dozen of East and West Coast Oysters ($15) disappeared seconds after they arrived. Chef Chris treated us also to an awesome Sashimi of Tuna, Tonnato Style with Lemon zested Olive Oil, Chorizo and Sea Salt. From the ""Jewels on Toast"" menu, we devoured Whipped Ricotta with Grilled Pears, Honey and Basil ($10). After one bite of the Roasted Bone Marrow with Rioja Braised Shallot Marmalade, I went into a catatonic state of Nirvana akin to one that had once stricken me at Per Se. The barrage continued with an authentic General Tso's Monkfish ($16), a stunningly delicious ""chef-donated"" platter of Beer Battered Maine Lobster Tacos with Red Cabbage Slaw and Jalapeno Mayo followed by another heavenly ""gratis"" serving Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs with Truffled Sheep's Milk Ricotta ($18) which would rival The Meatball Shop's award-winning spheres. Our wonderful server Tim, like a conductor, diligently orchestrated the pace of each course. I was on automatic pilot..ready to continue ingesting WHATEVER came out for as LONG as it came out. The gluttony crescendoed with a vibrant Olive Oil Poached Day Boat Cod with Beet & Citrus Salad ($28). An intriguingly smoky Garganelli with Spicy Veal Bolognese ($17) paired well with the zesty Miso Sambal Salt & Pepper Shrimp ($16). Desserts, too, did not disappoint. A luscious Butterscotch Pot De Creme ($10) had slivers of spoon shrapnel at the bottom of it. The gigantic Devil's Food Layer Cake ($12) mirrored the magnificent quality that I have long relished at Black Hound Bakery. So stunned by this meal, the thought of coffee didn't even occur to us. We stumbled our way towards the exit in a passionate zen ""foodie"" trance and didn't awake until the startling cold of the night air hit our smiling faces and ""snapped us out of it"". Three stars for the spectacular cuisine, one for the exceptional and attentive service, one more for the brilliantly designed architectural retro creation.

4.0,1/10/2011,"Meet me on Essex  between Stanton and Rivington, in front of the pawnshop. Whaaa? Okay, so the pawn shop is a little cheesy, but effective nonetheless. You think you're walking into yet another lil' speakeasy but nOooOoOooo. This place is huge. Taking up a space that used to be an old furniture warehouse, you certainly don't feel like you're in the LES. The dapper man opens the big door for you and you're whisked into glam. For a second I thought I was at the meatpacking district. A huges floor to ceiling chandelier and spiral staircase to a loung/bar area upstairs, or straigh on through to the bustling bar. Keep on walking and then be seated at the restaurant area after the bar. Keep on going with your group of 4 or 6 to the next room where there are booth style seatings and larger tables. If you're having a really large party, maybe even be accomodated at the very large table alllllll the way to the back. You're officially gone down a block to Norfolk at this point.On to the good stuff.... FOOD!It's small plates/tapas style dining. So share and be merry! Try the various cocktails while you wait, munch, chat, munch and order another one. The food is good. Not spectacular, but good for a group of friends to enjoy and savor. Tried a few things... sashimi of tuna, tempura shrimp cocktail to start with. I like that they accomodate the portions for larger groups by adding a 'plus one'. Then off to some main dishes to share... the brick-pressed chicken was suprisingly flavorfull and the salmon pieces as well. Was not really feeling the short rib tamales. Could use a little bit more gflavor and meat as I found it a little bland. The chilly sauce was good though. Loved loved the spaghettini. It was just so simple and tangy that it went well with our other choices. We snacked on the vinegar fries then moved on to dessert. The box of donuts were nice and warm without being too sweet. The black bottom pudding disappointed a little. Had the macarons the last time I came here and they were also good.  The atmosphere is obviously the hit here. Think Stanton Social blown up to a whole wharehouse. I like that they have room or sections which can easily be closed off for private events. This place is becoming quite popular.

2.0,1/5/2011,"(Originally drafted Dec. 2010. Not posted until now due to laziness.)My one word review: Lackluster.My multiple word review:This place is beautiful, don't get me wrong. If I was judging it based solely on decor, it would get 4-5 stars, easily. One of those places where you feel special just for being there. That said, I'm not sure they put much thought into anything else. The cocktails were good, but at the prices they're charging, you're definitely paying for the rent and not the inspired mixology. In a city which houses cocktail shrines like Death & Co. or Little Branch, I wasn't too impressed. Though I suppose if you like your drinks more on the sweet side, you'll probably be pleased. Personally though, I'm more of a Negroni or an Old Fashioned kind of guy...The food is where my main complaint lies. It almost felt as though the food was an afterthought. Considering that Stanton Social is so excellent, I was truly disappointed. It's the same idea (small dishes, which are to be shared with the table), but the implementation left much to be desired. The best dishes were the chicken meatballs, lobster dumplings, ""General Tso's"" monkfish, and the shishito peppers; all of these were interesting and tasty enough. The rest of the fare, however, was rather boring. The spaghettini was bland and not actually entree sized, though it claimed to be; the hominy was overtaken by the citrus (I believe it was lime); the broccolini was cold and flavorless; and the onion ring tempura were simply diner quality onion rings served with blue cheese. Though the kitchen was ambitious with their flavor pairings in general, the end result sadly tended more toward homogeneity than the platonic ideal of a greater whole supported by the individual elements. It just feels odd sitting in that atmosphere and paying those prices, and then eating forgettable dishes...We had particularly bad luck with the service, so I won't complain about that, as it wouldn't be fair; they tried their best, but we were still at the restaurant for 2 more hours than we would have liked. Thankfully, in the end they comped a few of the dishes. I think as time goes on, they'll get their act together in this respect. It's a HUGE restaurant and it was packed with people, likely for one of the first times since it opened. Benefit of the doubt: check.After all is said and done, there was little here to entice me to cross the water from my safe haven in Brooklyn.

So they won't fill you up! Just leave you craving more!Lobster Tacos beer battered maine lobster, red cabbage slaw, jalapeno mayo - These had a nice kick to them. I like how they were mini, so you didn't feel bad if you ate more than one. Since there were three of us, we each had one!Kale & Apple Salad apple cider vinaigrette, pancetta, candied pecans, shaved goat cheese - Tona of flavor. I loved the taste of the panchetta in the mix!Olive Oil Poached Day Boat Cod beet & caramelized citrus salad - This was the only dish we were not too crazy about. It didn't have much flavor, and we didn't even finish it.Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs sheep's milk ricotta, wild mushroom, truffle - The portion size of this was nice, but I wouldn't order it again, the meatballs were on the dry side.Chicken Fried Oysters apple & bacon braised spinach - I am still in love with this dish! I wish there were more than four on a plate, so I ordered two separate orders and had one dish to myself! Every time I visit, this will definitely be on my list!24 Oz. Bone-In Ribeye - with Beauty & Essex Signature Steak Sauces: Au Poivre, Truffle Hollandaise, Smoked Bacon, Bleu Cheese - Horseradish & Chimichurri - When this dish arrived, the whole restaurant stared at us. Probably thinking - these three girls, ordering so much food, how are they going to finish it. I convinced them, I like to do it BIG. So we did, and of course, spooned the truffle hollandaise, directly into our mouths. Used the rest as dipping sauce for the fries. Took the rest of the steak home. **Sad they took the ""Duck Fat potato wedge fries"" off the menu. The server said they moved the recipe over to Stanton Social. Bring me the fries back! I didn't care so much for the regular herbed fries.Dinner could not be complete without the Devils Food Cake with Milk Ice Cream! We almost finished the cake. Not really, but we did take it home and eat it the next day. It still tasted as fresh as if it was just baked.I'm so into this place, especially since its conveniently around the corner from my apartment, that I am bringing my family in tonight and try more items off the menu!",4,0,2,Jerrica J.,"New York, NY",959,1361,221
3.0,12/16/2010,"What I liked most about this place was the decor, size, and the fact that it's not packed to the gills with trendy, good-looking people. I guess it's still fairly new, so I actually had room to breathe around the bar and a place to sit on the couch. You walk in and instantly forget that you're on the Lower East Side -- this place is very Gossip Girl: dripping chandeliers, horsehair ""wallpaper"", lots and lots of cocktail waitresses in borderline classy attire. There is free champagne in the lady's lounge, and you definitely feel classy... except for the part that it's so big that even when there are a lot of people there, it still feels mostly empty. I'm certainly not complaining... I enjoy being able to sit down in the massive seating areas around the two bars and not have to jostle around people to get served. But you don't really feel special for having been there.. it doesn't have an exclusive feel that's so necessary for nightlife.As for the food/drinks, I definitely can't complain -- we shared the roasted eggplant jewels on toast, the spring rolls, and the lobster soup dumplings. They were all very passable, if entirely forgettable. The drinks are about as inventive as any other bar/lounge in NYC. Then again, I'm not exactly the connoisseur. I'll drink anything as long as it gets the job done. Mostly, I was just glad to be able to catch up with some friends I haven't seen in a long time in a very stress-free yet still chic environment.. who knows how long that will last, though.",0,0,0,Olga G.,"Atlanta, GA",32,151,2
5.0,12/15/2010,"Beauty & Essex is the love child of Chris Santos of The Stanton Social, the design firm AvroKo, Peter Kane of Happy Endings, and one of the co-founders of Tao and  Lavo clubs.  It's a ginormous 10,000 square foot restaurant, bar, & lounge that uses a pawn shop as a front. The ambiance is everything one would expect from such a ingenious combination: trendy, sophisticated, sleek and A-list worthy (so I would assume haha).  Among the many trendy restaurants in NYC, it is very rare to find one of equal quality in decor and cuisine.  I came with a party of four people on their opening night, December 11, 2010, and the restaurant/bar/lounge was already filling up fast around 8pm.  Reservations had been booked solid already and I had arrived as a walk-in for dinner, hoping to snag a seat in their beautiful second floor Pearl Lounge, aptly named for the giant chandelier made entirely of pearls that covers the entire ceiling. Beauty & Essex, despite all the kinks that come with a debut, surpassed all my expectations.  The eclectic small plates menu had the same high quality elegance and taste that define Beauty & Essex.  The menu takes inspiration from many global cuisines, and the results were simply superb without being too over-the-top as some dishes at The Stanton Social are.  The menu is a bit more refined and elegant, and it works quite well here.  I can't wait to come again and try more dishes!  And YES, the rumors are true: there is free champagne in the ladies' lounge. Be careful though, those tiles are very slip n slide...LOVED: Tomato Tartare, Roasted Bone Marrow, Whipped Ricotta, Ravioli, Steak with these amazing sauces... one being bacon!",5,0,3,Jen J.,"Tiburon, CA",114,250,54
5.0,12/14/2010,"This place surpasses it's sibling Stanton Social in both looks and taste.   The pawn shop facade gives way to a surprisingly enormous restaurant space that would be great for couples or a large party--and, unlike many places, I had no trouble hearing my dining companion.The cocktail menu is solid with a couple gems, like the ""Bright Boy Martini""--a sweet cocktail with a habanero tequila burn--delicious and beautiful to look at.  The menu, small plates mostly, is surprisingly vegetarian friendly.  The tomato tartare (created to mimic the taste of a steak tartare) was complex and refreshingly different.  As for dessert we ordered the doughnuts and the pot de creme: the pot de creme was rich, but not too sweet, but the doughnuts were nothing special.Service was great, and we weren't led astray by any of our server's recs (the doughnuts were our idea).  I'll definitely be returning soon!  Happy to have this in the neighborhood.",1,0,0,Dee S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,0
