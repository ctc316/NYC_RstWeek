3.0,4/30/2019,"Just mediocre. The calamari was nice, along w the tuna app. But unfortunately the kohlrabi was cut to large within the avacado feta salad making it unappealing. The pizza was also too crispy for our liking but still good flavor. Not worth the hype or the price.",0,0,0,Rebecca M.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",0,23,4

4.0,4/16/2019,"After a year we came back to ABC kitchen. I ordered the same dish as last year - bunless burger with a side salad. It did not live up to the one from last year, but still good. I am dropping from 5 to 4 stars for a few reasons. 1. Last year the price for the burger was very high but totally worth it. This year it was still very high priced but it was not as good make it less worth the price. 2. Although all the servers were very nice, we had three different servers. Not sure why they kept shifting but they would always introduce their replacement.  3. The food was still good. 4.  The place is still very nice.

5.0,4/10/2019,Had dinner here with a group of people from work and had a truly fantastic experience.   The six of us shared a variety of appetizers all of which were spectacular.  Great flavors - both expected and unexpected.  Service was friendly and helpful but never intrusive.  The ginger margarita tastes very fresh.  I'd highly recommend it.  Pork chop entree was really flavorful and cooked perfectly.   Place is on the noisier side but has a very lively vibe which made it ok.  Original plan was to go somewhere else.  I'm very happy that the plan changed!,0,0,0,Greg P.,"Wrentham, MA",0,9,6
3.0,4/10/2019,"What I love:- Bar area with beautiful sunlight coming through the windows- Two or three high top tables- The food actually tastes very good. I had the egg and fried oysters and I would definitely recommend it- The service was really goodProblems:- The interior is very dark, not the best when you come here on a sunny day- They keep people waiting at the front of the restaurant when they have a ton of empty tables around. (Are they not well staffed?)- My friend ordered the kale salad with salmon added on and it was basically a piece of salmon sitting on a plate full of kale. Not worth the $31. There are other restaurants out there that have food that tastes good but at a worthy price.",0,0,0,Sherry J.,"Manhattan, NY",182,191,832
1.0,4/9/2019,"I usually am not one to write reviews, but I actually had such the most unenjoyable experience at this restaurant. The service was so horrible, I found all the staff to be so inattentive, dismissive, and unhelpful the entire night. The food was also beyond unsatisfactory--everything felt like the least amount of effort had been put in, the portions were oddly small (such as sides and appetizers). The restaurant is SO loud, almost impossible to hear anything or get anyone's attention. Overall, I would strongly discourage going to this restaurant. It's old news and beyond tired.",0,0,0,Julia H.,"New York, NY",310,3,0
5.0,4/7/2019,"Came here with a friend who was visiting the city for Sunday brunch. We made sure to book a reservation ahead of time as I heard about the super long waiting times on Yelp. Nonetheless, we had to wait about 10 minutes or so as our table wasn't ready yet, which wasn't a problem.We got a variety of dishes: Buttermilk and Crawford Cheddar biscuits, Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli, Smoked Salmon with Horseradish, Creme Fraiche and Lemon, and Eggs Benedict with Flying Pigs Farm Ham. I loved each single dish we had (minus the Smoked Salmon as I don't like Smoked Salmon but my friend absolutely loved it!)! The biscuits were buttery, flaky-ish, and overall indulgent in taste and texture. I personally preferred it without the butter but my friend loved it with the addition of butter so definitely try that. You could also really taste the cheddar and overall, it was just an amazing assortment of flavors. I saw that the Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli was a big hit on Yelp and the reviews were right on point! The crab chunks were beautifully fresh, moist (sorry but true), soft, and delicious. The lemon juice added a wonderful tang to the dish as well as the lemon aioli. The buttery toast also gave such a nice crunch and flavor. I highly recommend getting this!The Eggs Benedict was also a wonderful dish. The saltiness of the ham paired with the mildly seasoned egg really went well together. The eggs were perfectly cooked with a beautifully runny yolk. The hollandaise sauce was also really silky and creamy and made the overall dish a flavor bomb. The diced potatoes were also nicely flavored, so I give this dish a huge thumbs up as well!Overall, this is a nice place to dine with visiting friends, relatives, or even with a date hehe. It's not the cheapest restaurant, but the price is worth it in my opinion.",0,0,1,Tiffanii C.,"New York, NY",621,73,228

3.0,4/2/2019,"I hate to give this 3 stars because the food here is so amazing. The first time I went here it was perfection. However, we went back last week and it was a horrible experience.

4.0,3/29/2019,"Fun, modern and romantic atmosphere.  Crab toast is five stars - wonderful ratio of flavorful crab on perfectly toasted bread.  It is simple and refreshing.  Wasn't as big of a fan of the spinach ricotta pizza, although the texture of the crust was divine, in my opinion the flavor was a little too yeasty and the cheese was a little too strong.  Sea bass was delicious - outside had a nice crust on it and the lemon added a good twist.  The almond cake itself was five stars! However, I think that it would be better paired with a creamier ice cream/sorbet.  The almond and pear garnish enhanced, but the pear sorbet didn't really compliment the cake - it was a little too icy and overpowering.  Perhaps a lighter pear ice cream (or even vanilla or milk flavored) would bring the dish to five stars in my mind.  Will definitely be back to try other items on the menu.",0,0,0,Lauren H.,"New York, NY",3,127,296

5.0,3/21/2019,"There was an amazing ambiance entering the restaurant. The dim lighting and interior design was modern and visually appealing; this was expected since this is a restaurant of the renowned ABC Carpet & Home furniture store. The waiters were very attentive, and even though they made a few messed on our table, they provided excellent service. The menu was small, but that's what made the food extremely special. My personal favorite was the Prix-fixe lunch menu: Seared salmon, bibb salad, market vegetables, spicy buttermilk-herb vinaigrette. The salmon was amazing and I would highly recommend getting it medium rare. I was really satisfied with what Michelin Star Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's ABC kitchen had to offer and I cannot wait to come again!",1,0,0,Matthew K.,"Hoboken, NJ",52,1,2

Perfect place to take a date, huge restaurant with great ambiance, all the items on the menu are unique. Also a good place to take visitors to NYC.The entrance from the street is a little confusing, it's hard to tell which of the three ABC restaurants you are walking into.

1.0,3/14/2019,"This was one of the most disappointing dining experiences I've had in a very long time. My parents had been wanting me to try this place for a long time and as they'd been before and loved it. I was visiting for the weekend and we decided to go.We made reservation for Saturday brunch and arrived a little before our reservation time. There was about a 10 minute wait for the table which is common and responsible. The restaurant is wonderfully decorated and has a good ambiance. That's where the good things stop.Once we are sat at our table in the main dining room, we were not brought water or menus until we had been at our table for 15 minutes. We FINALLY received menus and water only to be ignored for another 10 minutes.At this point we had been at our table for 25 minutes and had not been able to order anything, even drinks. We weren't even sure if we had a server. After many attempts, I finally managed to flag down some poor employee and begged for some bread and someone to come take our order. He disappears and comes back with bread and the bartender who promptly asked us what we wanted. We were not sat anywhere close to the bar area so I'm still confused how he was the only person available to take a order.Out food comes out within a responsible amount of time and is bland and lukewarm. The only item we liked was the pretzel coated calamari. The eggs on the eggs Benedict were all massively over cooked. Everything lacked flavor. Nothing was hot. No server at any point checked on us. The only employees we interacted with were the food runners and the water-guys. Getting our check was another 15 minute process of trying to flag someone down. We never figured out who our server was.The final ""cherry"" on top was when someone (who maybe was the manager?) came over while we were paying to ask how our meal was. We answered ""not good"". Her response was ""oh"" before walking away. I'm not sure why she even asked. No one apologized to us at any point. For a restaurant with such a good reputation I expected a lot better. We will not be back.",3,1,0,Mary F.,"Arlington, VA",164,12,0
5.0,3/11/2019,"Came here with my parents for my birthday dinner and would recommend for any occasion-Service: The service needs to be noted here as it's impeccable. It felt like there was a team of servers all dedicated to helping out the table and no matter who you asked to help, all of them were more than happy to help. Food came quickly, everyone was super friendly, and overall very pleasant Food: Where to start?-Cocktails- got the Citrus Sparkler which definitely focused on the champagne. Also tried the sake which was nice, light, and crisp-Calamari- well fried, thoroughly breaded, delicious -Ricotta - great crusty bread and a good portion of the spread-Fluke and Tuna Sashimis- keeping these together but both had their own flavors and were both amazing, recommend for sure -Sea Bass- this was my meal, well prepared, flakey and great portion size. There was a broth in the bowl that was seasoned with thyme and rosemary and was unlike any preparation I've tried before, very good!-Fried chicken- half chicken deboned and cooked tempura style, was very juicy -Ricotta ravioli- classic and good -Chocolate Cake- super moist and flavorful-Cookie Plate- options for everyone!Atmosphere: The overall restaurant is super different. Everything is different yet somehow it all works together (lights, plates, anything). I appreciated the decor and presentation.

3.0,3/11/2019,"I've been wanting to try this place for quite some time and it was mostly great but a couple things made it feel like a rip off. Almost immediately after we ordered, two of our dishes came out and then a couple minutes later the third one arrived, so half of our items came out in the span of like 10 minutes. At first we were impressed but that quickly turned to annoyance that they were just trying to turn the table as fast as possible. There's really no need to be deluged with food from the get go, especially at these prices. Which brings me to my second point...it is expensive *for what it is*. The ambiance is amazing and the food is very good, but it is not unique. Many, many restaurants serve exactly this genre of food and do it just as well but at a more reasonable price. The kale salad is $18 and we literally laughed at the portion size. It was a light dusting of kale (we could see the plate through the salad) and it had maybe 4-5 small croutons and a couple peppers. It was good but should have been $10. Same with pretty much everything we tried - delicious but overpriced. This struck me as the type of place that's ideal for a group because it has a great vibe and there's something for everyone, but I didn't leave feeling like I had to come back.",0,0,0,Katie W.,"Chicago, IL",33,84,0
4.0,3/10/2019,"The best part of this restaurant is the ambiance, oh my god it is so pretty. If you ever want to propose to someone do it here, incredibly spacious and really amazing aesthetic. The service was also very nice constantly filling our waters and clearing dishes. The food was okay, I think you're definitely paying for the vibes of the restaurant and the food seems to be farm to table which ups the price but overall very good. We ordered the cheese and charcuterie board and the tuna sashimi to start. The cheese board was fine, very average definitely not worth $22 but the tuna sashimi was amazing the sauce and mint were amazing but it was extremely small portion wise and very light. I had the ricotta ravioli which was good it was in a sweet red sauce. My friend had the salmon which she was surprised to find out it was on a bed of mashed potatoes which she hates but if you like it then yay! Just a personal preference; this restaurant has paper straws which I absolutely despise so if you hate drinking the drink directly then bring your own straw.

5.0,3/9/2019,"Wonderful service and flavorful food! Overall the decor was a beautiful rustic farm look but a bit loud as the tables were set close together. You will also get bread only if you ask for it which is a concept I don't get because while you're waiting for food, you're left with a confused feeling of, ""Oh how come that table got bread? Is that something that comes with something they ordered?"" Our waiter apologetically said they are told not to suggest or even offer bread unless we ask for it. Strange.

The atmosphere is really nice and they have a variety of settings - main dining room has dim lighting that is great for dates, and no matter where you are seated, you'll be surrounded by fresh and modern decor. Likewise, the menu offers dishes with unique and refreshing taste. A few highlights:Crab toast: a delight to share with the table. Honestly I'm not a huge fan of crab to begin with, but this dish really works for me. Pairs well with the lemon aioli.Black Sea bass: Super fresh, and sits in a delicious herb broth. The fish skin was crispy, but otherwise was super moist!Pork Chop: the group's unanimous favorite - they give you a nice thick slab of juicy meat, rich in flavor. The apple mostarda was also tasty and balanced the meat well.Chocolate cake: has ganache in the filling, and has a toasted marshmellow icing - above average chocolate cake for sure!Service isn't the fastest, but the waiters were very polite and professional.",1,0,0,Matt H.,"New York, NY",273,264,748
4.0,3/3/2019,"Fun and great atmosphere. Loved decor and all that the restaurant stands for. The calamari was coated in pretzel crumbs which was very mild tasting but delicious. The crab toast was delicious and unique. Full of flavor and different that the norm of what you ""normally"" get on a menu, it was very light and flavorful. My pasta with bolognese was very good and spicy. So if you don't like spicy then stay clear. The porkchop on the menu was heavenly it was so juicy and tender and the apples added the perfect combo. It was spectacular. Got the shaved brussel spout slaw and it was bland, wouldn't get that again. Our server was super nice, but our service was slow at the same time. Needed to ask for a refill and to have my bread plate cleared after removing everything else. Overall, very minor and would definitely go back.",2,0,1,Melissa D.,"Carmel, IN",113,97,83
1.0,3/2/2019,"I was so excited to check this place out because of the reviews and general hype, but dad to say it was probably one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. We ordered the meat and cheese platter to start and the prosciutto smelled a bit weird and had excess fat on it. When I told one of the employees, they told me that's the way it comes. I come from a meat and cheese background and that's not how it's supposed to be. I asked for crackers but they said the best they had was toasted bread, but even that came out extremely burnt. Our drinks were watered way down. My friends ravioli had one peice of burned or over cooked ravioli. And the burger I ordered medium well was medium at best. Fries were coldish and droopy. Within 35 minutes we paid the check and left. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It may have been great at one time, but can't say the same now.",1,0,0,Jay G.,"West Babylon, NY",81,103,219

This was amazing and had a creamy taste with a tang to it! Following that I had the winter squash campanelle, which was good if a little overly sweet from the squash.

3.0,2/27/2019,"Nostalgia plays a funny trick on you. This used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but I don't remember the food being this salty! If you are in the mood for good eclectic food, then go here. It's a great place for sharing plates, like tapas style. That way you can taste everything. I've been here on and off couple of times over the years. You are better off sticking to what's popular: like that carrot and avocado salad, their pizzas. Avoid the squash pasta: one word salty. I had the steamed skate: the skate was really fresh but it was drowning in the soy sauce broth. It made me wish I had rice with that...I don't remember even the roasted carrot and avocado salad being that heavily flavored or salty. The last time I ordered that salad was 8 years ago. From nostalgia, I remember the food being very light in comparison.Then again, the last time I actually dined there was nearly 4-5 years ago.

4.0,2/25/2019,"ABC Kitchen is associated with the nearby ABC Carpet and Home.  Known for its cross between modern and classic design sensibilities, its wares are not cheap but they are whimsical and lovely to look at.  However if you ever wanted to have a meal inside the interior of ABC Carpet and Home, ABC Kitchen gives you that chance ! Walking into the restaurant feels like you have walked into a catalog complete with beautiful lighting, furniture and fixtures.  It is an absolutely gorgeous space with a modern, semi-rustic design.I came for a birthday brunch, so I was able to try several dishes.  Here is a rundown:CRAB TOAST WITH LEMON AIOLIThese small pieces of toast each came with a delicious crab salad.  The texture and flavor were both nice and smooth while the aioli gave it a bright ""bite"" of flavor.  Definitely get these!MUSHROOMS, PARMESAN, OREGANO & FARM EGG PIZZAThis small pizza is perfect for 3-4 people to share.  The egg may seem like an odd thing to add to a pizza, but all the flavors come together beautifully to create a very comforting dish.SCRAMBLED EGGS, CRISPY OYSTERS & HOT SAUCE BUTTERLike the egg on pizza above, this is a very unexpected combination of ingredients.  However, they somehow work together beautifully.  The egg was runny, just the way I like them and the crispy oysters offered a delicious contrast in both flavor and texture.  The hot sauce butter tied it all together.  This is a must-order!WOOD OVEN ROASTED MAINE LOBSTER (with Oregano & Lemon-Chili Vinaigrette)This was perhaps one of the most straight forward dishes we ordered.  While good, there was nothing outstanding about it.   It was moist, the vinaigrette was good, but I woul dnot say this is a ""must have"".Service was A+.  Our waiter was funny, attentive and answered all of our questions.  When his shift ended, he made a nice smooth hand off to our second waiter (who was also fantastic).Overall I loved my experience at ABC Kitchen and I cannot wait to go back.",6,3,6,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",393,1298,917
1.0,2/24/2019,"Went here for brunch today and from start to finish, it was a very disappointing experience. First of all, I did tell the waiter that it was my first time dining here and I did want to see his suggestions on what to order. He was not helpful at all.  Did not recommend anything on the menu to us. Since our waiter was of no help at all, we ordered the mushroom pizza. It was good, nothing to rave about, I have definitely had better pizza. Our waiter came over again while we were eating the pizza, asked what else we wanted, we said we don't know yet. With an attitude, he says ""is that ALL you will be ordering?""..... (people do NOT like to be rushed during their brunches)Then, we made a mistake of listening to our waiter who said the winter squash campanelle was ""delicious"" when we asked about it. It was one of the worst dishes I have EVER had in my life. The squash was NOT cooked and the taste of it was just terrible. On that note, we decided it would be best to get the check, considering we had poor food as well as poor service.  I was so excited to try this overly hyped restaurant.

Every corner is dripping with style, all within the uniform modern rustic theme.  - customer service is very professional and chivalrous, although slow. - had the mushroom appetizer, the sea bass entree, and the Brussel sprouts side. Everything tasted perfect, though portion sizes were way small, especially for the price, so keep the quality-over-quantity thing in mind when coming here. It's more about the exquisite presentation and the quality ingredients at ABCK. Also tried the kale salad with salmon added to it, which was actually a big portion and very lemony delicious. - special note to not sleep on the vegetables! There's definitely a special vegetable situation happening here! - coffee was great and was refilled as well. They have almond milk, score! Their iced tea looked great, too, though I didn't try it. - love how it's got the home decor extension, so you can take a fun walk after your meal!",4,1,6,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",978,2060,1393
4.0,2/17/2019,"Had Valentine's Day dinner super late (around 10:30) last week. Service was a bit slow and it took awhile before we got menus or offered  any water. We went with a bottle of Pinot Noir and some apps - crab toast and the shaved raw fluke. The crab was super fresh and served with a fab of what tasted like mayo. The fluke was absolutely delicious, flavor was well balanced with the horseradish and pieces of apple. For the main course, I went with the ricotta ravioli and my boyfriend had the friend chicken. The ravioli was definitely the best part of the meal. They were so fresh and tasted like they had been made by someone's grandmother! The chicken was definitely crispy though a bit bland. The mashed potatoes were super buttery and smooth. We also ordered the cheesecake, which had some sort of sesame crust and fresh blood orange on top. It was okay but very hard to eat, given how soft the crust was. Decor is beautiful, definitely very romantic dinner!",2,0,1,Kristie P.,"New York, NY",200,135,405

2.0,2/2/2019,"Such a frustrating evening. We were relaxed and happy and ready for a great meal when we arrived. The beauty of going to a restaurant of this caliber is that you know that you can relax and be taken care of. But that was not to be. We ordered a bottle of wine within a few minutes of sitting down. Then ordered food. They brought the food, which we had hoped to enjoy with the wine. So we just looked at it as it got cold whole we waited for the wine. We had started off the evening deep in conversation- like all great meals, we were ready to settle in and talk and enjoy the night. But the runners brought each dish within minutes of each other. By the third dish, the table was too crowded, so we asked the runner to hold off and let us finish. And still, no wine. After asking about the wine for a third time, it finally arrived along with a half hearted apology from our waiter. We mentioned to him that we had sent the third dish back, and that we just wanted to finish the first two.   He apologized. Thirty seconds later, the runner appeared with the third dish. We tried to make room and sipped our wine, trying to remember what we had been taking about. The food was... fine? Not bad? (The crab was really fresh. I liked the mushrooms a lot.)It just feels crappy to pay so very much for fine dining and to get such stunning mediocrity of presentation. And in a city with the most astounding dining experiences!What a huge operation, and yet completely devoid of pride and soul. Let the tourists enjoy it. The city has so much more to offer.

3.0,1/31/2019,"Came here for restaurant week. The ambience and the wait staff were absolutely lovely. However, the food didn't quite meet the mark. For prices so expensive and with many of the rave reviews I read I did have my hopes up but of course within reason. The coffee was decent but a little burnt. We ordered the bean soup and squash toast for appetizer - both were the best part of the meal. Neither was particularly incredible but both did offer an excellent balance of flavor and texture. For the main entree we ordered the chicken and spinach dish and the campanelle. The chicken was tender and delicious; the sauce that it sat on though was a bit too sour for my taste; and the spinach oddly enough had zero flavor - similarly to the campanelle. The campanelle was served looking like an orange squash glob and tasted up to expectation - no flavor, mushy and soggy pasta. For dessert we ordered the chocolate cake and the panna cotta. The chocolate cake was quite nice, though the burnt flavor from the torched marshmallow did overbear a few bites. The panna cotta frankly just tasted like spoiled milk; we could not eat more than a few bites.FYI don't get tricked by the menu as the spacing dooped us :( dessert is not included in the prefixe I had such high hopes for this place, especially as I instantly fell in love with the beautiful interior, but sadly I won't be coming back.",0,0,0,Gabrielle F.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,17,6
3.0,1/30/2019,"Grabbed lunch before hitting ABC Carpet & Home.  I ordered the Shaved Tuna Fluke & Winter Squash pasta (Restaurant Week lunch offerings), the horseradish on the fluke really gave it a good bite and the thinly sliced apple counterbalanced it nicely.  The portion of the pasta for Restaurant Week was just right, a full sized lunch plate would have been too rich for my taste.  Husband ordered the Bibb salad with chicken and fries.  Fries had a lot of salt (which we like, but for most people it would have been overly salty).  The salad looked great, and was missing the dressing so after flagging down are less than attentive waiter he brought some dressing which apparently ruined the salad according to my husband.  Husband ordered ice cream (it comes with three scoops) and he opted for vanilla & salted caramel, which was very tasty.  Vanilla was very clean, the salted caramel was good, just be prepared for pretty sweet.  I would have personally chosen two vanilla and one caramel.",0,0,0,Christina K.,"Arlington, VA",97,37,31

I would highly recommend everyone to check out the review of ABC Kitchen on The Infatuation which accurately describes the unfortunate decline of this NYC ""staple"" restaurant.-----Quick breakdown of all parts of the dinner:Atmosphere: The best thing they have going for them is the decor and vibes of the entire place. This makes it a good restaurant for business lunches/dinners and for people who are there to just chat and not really eat the food.Pasta: Our pasta dish came out cold and overcooked. With all the pasta options in NYC, there's no reason to waste time and and stomach space on overcooked cold pasta...Pizza: We ordered the pizza With Tomatoes & Buffalo Mozzarella. Out of the 4 slices, my friend and I had one each and decided not to pack the rest. Similar to the pasta, the pizza came out cold. The tomato sauce was thinly layered on and everything was just kind of bland.Crab toast: This was good.

The menu was personalized along with company name etc. everything was family style so it takes away from having to make a decision and you can just try everything on the menu. The waiters/waitresses went above and beyond. Anything we needed, they accommodated and the execution of this meal was flawless! Let's get on to the food:For the appetizers we had the sashimi tuna, the beet salad, and the ricotta cheese. Oh my god, I have never enjoyed beets but this beet salad was sent by the gods!! The tuna had a perfect flavor combination and the ricotta cheese was brilliantly smooth with a lite flavor. Not as harsh as some ricotta cheeses I've had. We also had the crab toast, the calimari, and the spinach pizza as well as the mushroom pizza. Everything was so fresh and flavorful!For the main courses: we had the pork chop, the ricotta ravioli and the seared salmon. Again, all executed perfectly. The pork chop was paired with spicy apples who've I have never experienced before but was so very pleased! For the sides: we had the mashed potatoes with sea salt, soooo creamy and flavorful!For desserts: we had the chocolate cake, the sundae with caramel pop corn and the almond cake. I was not a huge fan of the desserts I thought they were a bit too complex and needed to push back a bit on the strong flavor. But not bad at all, I didn't eat much of them honestly simply because I was so full from the rest of the meal!Thank you ABC Kitchen for such a pleasant experience!

He was sad it was such a little glass haha, but it tasted great! Service: this is where things fell flat. The waiter was great but there were SEVERAL issues with our ticket. One person ordered a coffee, but somehow our entire party was charged for the coffee. The manager was checking in and when my friend said something, he quickly and kindly amended the ticket. Later after we paid the bill my friend noticed that we had been charged for the bar drinks we paid for at the bar...twice! The manager was apologetic and then randomly a waiter came with the exact drinks we ordered, we told him we never ordered it... it was chaotic and a weird way to the end the meal. For such a famous and well regarded restaurant this seemed as if it it should below their standards.

The calamari was chewy and overfried to the point of tastelessness. It tasted like something you'd get at a bad diner. The sea bass itself was fantastic; however, the presentation turned the dish into fish soup and ruined the flavor. The fish sat delicately on a bed of spinach suspended in a very aromatic broth. There was so much broth that it could have been a soup. Once you cut into the fish, it dropped down into the broth and you lost all the flavor of the fish. It became a very unappetizing fish soup. If ABC Kitchen reads this, please cut back on the broth. Perhaps I ordered the wrong things on the menu.

For apps we got roasted carrot salad, kale salad, calamari, and ricotta. My favorite was the carrot salad. For entrees we got ravioli, salmon, fried chicken, and pork chop. The best was the fried chicken and salmon. For dessert, we finished off with chocolate cake, almond cake, and sundae. If you can, get all three!

1.0,11/13/2018,"TL;DR: Double check your bill! They added $2-3 extra to EACH DISH on the bill, without saying anything. Don't know how long they've been doing this and how much extra money they've made.I've been wanting to try ABC Kitchen for the longest time, and I finally got to last night. The food was as good as I expected it to be, the ambiance was romantic, and the servers were friendly. However, last night's experience only deserves 1 star and here's why:Our table reservation for 8 people at 9pm wasn't available until 9:30. For a restaurant that asks for a credit card on file for a party larger than 5, you'd think that they would be more prepared to seat such a big party; thus, we got 2 complimentary ricotta squash toast for the table. The biggest problem lies after dinner. When we got the bill, I saw that my sea bass was $36, $3 more than what it was priced on the menu. Then my friends checked their orders and we realized all our orders were $2-3 more than what the menu stated. We were also charged for the ""complimentary squash toast"" and a beer that we never ordered. If I hadn't caught that mistake, we would've paid an extra $56, not including tax and tip. ABC Kitchen's reasoning was that they changed the pricing of the food on the POS system but not on their physical menu that they give to costumers. They honored the price that was printed but they should have mentioned the price change or updated their menu. I don't know how long they've been doing this and how much they've scammed from their customers.",0,0,0,Cheryl K.,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",27,17,7
2.0,11/11/2018,"Sad to say my guests and I just had a sour experience at ABC kitchen today. We arrived at 2pm for our 2pm reservation. We sat at 2:35. Around 2:45pm I went back to the host desk to ask if there was a server assigned to our section as we wanted water and menus. Shortly thereafter, we were greeted with menus and water and I asked to speak with a manager. She came over and I informed her about the wait. Her response was: ""We know."" No apology or anything!Eventually we were able to give a server our order. 3 house cocktails and the squash toast and crab toast to start, followed by the  carrot and avocado salad with chicken, the fried oysters and eggs and the burger cooked medium for our entrees.The appetizers arrived before the drinks. The burger  arrived well done and had to be sent back. Otherwise the food was tasty and up to their usual standards. The second burger arrived cooked to medium and shortly after, our server dropped off a carrot and avocado salad to ""keep us busy while we waited for the burger."" It seemed so strange to offer a dish that was already on the table and the timing was clearly far off. The gesture was appreciated though as it was the first acknowledgement that anyone who worked there had made to our poor service. We had it wrapped to go since we already had one at the table.We ordered another round of drinks and the sundae and cookie plate for dessert. Eventually, since each interaction with anyone took ages, we paid in full for our meal. At that point, there was almost no one left in the restaurant but things still seemed to take forever to get done.I've been going to ABC kitchen, Cocina and ABCV for years and have celebrated birthdays, anniversaries etc. there. I used to look forward to ""wow-ing"" visitors there but sadly, it seems the customer service has taken such a turn for the worst that I doubt I will return again. 2 stars for the chef.

3.0,11/9/2018,"The food is still delicious and the bussing staff was wonderful, but I extend a 3 star rating because of the waiter that our table had. The waiter was rude from the first encounter. We had a five year old in the group, but he was behaving well and there was no reason to approach us sideways. We decided to share food and when a couple of plates were cleared, a busser visited to remove them. We continued to stack empty plates on the side of our table in order to make space and avoid a mess for our little one. Then, the waiter came and said we don't clear the table until everyone is finished, but in this case I will take them. I live in Las Vegas and hearing this instead of ""how is everything"" and simply removing the items was ridiculous. I felt like we were assumed to not belong in the restaurant, even though we caused no scene or trouble. While I thoroughly enjoyed my experience in 2016, I was disappointed this visit. Of the food we had, the crab toast was the best. Other items were good but not memorable. Our least favorite was the broccoli rabe.

5.0,10/24/2018,"We were recommended to this restaurant from a foodie friend, and it did not disappoint. Luckily, we were able to make a reservation a little less than a week in advance. Ambiance - (5/5) It's a beautiful and elegant restaurant. It is very dimly lit but a nice place to have a celebration (birthday, anniversary, etc.). The only thing is that it is pretty hard to read the menu in the dark. Service - (5/5) For a restaurant of this caliber, I expected great service and it deliver. I think that my water was refilled a total of 10 times throughout the entire meal. We were checked on constantly by the staff who were friendly and helpful. Food:Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli - (5/5) This was extremely tasty and loaded with shredded crab meat. The lemon aioli was the perfect touch of citrus and balanced the richness of the crab meat well.Shaved raw fluke, ocean herbs, and fermented green chili - (5/5) This was probably my favorite dish of the night. It was so light and refreshing yet each bite was an explosion of flavor. It was perfectly balanced with fresh herbs and the bits of fruit in the dish were delicious. It was sweet, salty, and sour in the perfect amounts. Line caught Tuna sashimi - (3.5/5) I don't personally like tuna very much. It was really good and like the other sushi dish, it was very refreshing but the flavors weren't as good as the fluke so I would choose that dish over this one. Black sea bass with chilies and herbs - (4/5) The sea bass was cooked perfectly, extremely fresh, and melted in your mouth. While the fish was delicious, the dish is essentially in a soup. I would have preferred the fish to be prepared differently. Sundae with Salted Caramel Ice Cream - (4.5/5) This was incredibly tasty and very salty (in a good way). It's not overly sweet but extremely tasty. The candied peanuts and popcorn were a perfect addition. The whipped cream and hot fudge was delicious.

4.0,10/24/2018,"The interior design is stunning. It looks like a garden with all the small white tables and big round wooden tables, given the fact that it is right next to ABC home & carpet. My friend and I came here for lunch, and we ordered crab toast with lemon aioli, squash pizza, and bibb salad with seared salmon. The waiter recommended their burger and sandwich, but it was a little too much for two girls. The portion size was big. We finished the crab toast and the salad, but only ate half of the pizza because we were too full. The crab toast was incredible. I am not a big fan of seafood, but the crab did not taste seafood-y at all because of the lemon aioli. The crab meat was shredded and cooked, and the toast was crunchy but not overly crunchy that it would cut your tongue. There were two lemons on the side in case you need more acid. I squeezed them and they brought out the flavor of lemon aioli and freshness of crab. Although there were lots of meat, $16 was still a lot for an appetizer. The pizza I had is no longer on the menu. It was a thin crust pizza with two types of squash, ricotta, and some chili flakes. It looked like it was cooked in a wood oven due to the charred crust. The ricotta tasted a little like goat cheese to me. The chili flakes added a bit spiciness to the pizza, which was great because I love spicy food. It also added more flavor to the squash. The salad was assorted fresh vegetables with dressing (unfortunately I don't remember the dressing). The vegetables are all organic produce from local farms. It is ABC Kitchen's mission to support these farms and encourage healthy-eating with best ingredients possible. The salmon was decent, not impressive. My overall experience was great and I would go back again for dinner. The price was a little high. Three dishes cost $65 before tax and tips.

4.0,10/20/2018,"Had been dying to try ABC Kitchen for 2 yrs and finally made it for my birthday with two gal pals on a Wed evening at 8pm. I made the reservation on open table 2-3 weeks before and didn't have a problem picking a time. As we walked in, we were seated promptly, which I always appreciate! The spot is surprisingly enormous. The fact that it is so hard to get a res here with ample seating is insane, but a great sign that there's always high demand.We started out with a bottle of chianti. It was reasonably priced for a notable restaurant in NYC. We started out with the house made ricotta and fig jam as well as the roasted carrot and avo salad. The house made ricotta was super fresh and creamy and was balanced perfectly with the sweet fig jam. The smooth textures of the jam and ricotta went so well with the toasted crostini. The roasted carrot and avo salad was surprisingly flavorful; loved how such simple ingredients had so much flavor!For my main course, I got the full portion of the campanelle in a tomato sauce with buratta, cherry tomatoes, and sausage. The campanelle was homeade and absolutely delicious!For my bday, we also split the chocolate cake, which was HUGE and phenomenal. Would definitely come back and try some of the wood fired pizzas, pretzel dusted calamari app and some different fish or meat entrees. The only complaint my group had about our experience was the poor service. We felt undermined by our waiter from the moment he spoke to us. He clearly didn't give us enough time to look over the menu and then came back every few minutes to see if we were ready yet. There was no reason for him to rush us and he could have used his social awareness skills to not ask us 4-5 times if we were ready to order within 15 min. He was also not friendly throughout the meal. When it came time to order dessert, he made a comment that the menus were on the table the entire dinner and seemed annoyed that we hadn't realized. For a meal that takes long to get a reservation and isn't cheap, I expect service to be top-notch and it was completely unacceptable that we weren't treated in a warm or respectful manner.",1,0,1,Alexandra T.,"Jersey City, NJ",353,407,326

We arrived to the restaurant early and were not seated until 20 minutes after our reservation time, which was a little frustrating but luckily things turned around from there. We enjoyed a drink in the beautiful bar area until we were seated. The dining room is gorgeous, with lots of white wood, glass, dim lighting and rustic yet modern décor.  To start we ordered the Roast Carrot and Avocado Salad at the recommendation of a friend. I know this does not sound exciting, but it was the most fresh, delicious salad I have had in a long time. Order it! The carrots were roasted perfectly, fresh avocado, crispy seeds, large croutons with a citrus dressing-perfection! They also start you off with complimentary bread as well. We all shared the Fried Organic Chicken, which was special too and not your ordinary fried chicken. The breading was extremely light and crispy, chicken was perfect and juicy as well all sitting in a decadent butter sauce. My other favorite of the night was the Winter Squash Campanelle with parmesan and nutmeg-a perfect dish for fall. I kept having ""one last bite"" and couldn't stop! We also had on the side, the Mashed Potatoes with sea salt, and those were fantastic as well. Rich and decadent!Before arriving I wasn't all that excited about the menu choices and not sure if ABC Kitchen would live up to the hype, but it definitely went beyond my expectations with it's extraordinary twists on their dishes.

This was a horrible experience. From the moment I sat down and was served Luke warm water, it started downhill. I'm an older guy & a few different people came by and I understood very little because it sounded like whispers. I let my son do the ordering & most of what we ordered was recommended by the waiter. The fried calimari appetizer was very small in size and not heated up well. The beat soup had unidentifiable spices that my wife and I thought was disgusted with out the sweetnesses of beats.

I had Monk fish consisting of 2 tiny pieces finished with 4 very small bites and was not worth $190. The inside of the place was attractive.

Seemed more lunch like to me. I ordered a cup of green juice which was quite expensive. I had the spinach and ricotta omelette that didn't do much for me besides being fresh. It came with potatoes that were quite hard on the outside and didn't offer much in the way of flavor.We did have some good, flaky cheddar biscuits though.

We had been years ago for lunch and had so enjoyed the atmosphere. The restaurant is set inside the store and has beautifully mismatched plates and an overall modern but chic decor. The atmosphere was still lovely, but the chaos, noisy-ness, and slow service made for an overall unenjoyable dinner. When I called, I had informed them it was my mother's birthday and was so pleased that they said they could bring out a birthday cupcake and candle at the end of the meal. However, we were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room - and it was so loud we could barely hear each other even when shouting. We ordered the new-to-the- menu cabbage and apple salad with apple cider vinegar and walnut dressing and the sea bass entree to split. The salad was okay - an interesting combination of flavors, but something I felt could be recreated in a home kitchen and with a more sizable portion. The sea bass was quite good as the fish tasted fresh, flaky and flavorful. While the meal was okay - waiting for our orders to be taken, the food to come, and then the plates to be cleared was frustratingly slow. The restaurant was filled with waiters, but getting the attention of any one felt impossible. By the time we finished our courses, spent ten minutes trying to get our plates cleared, another ten trying to get the dessert menu, and another ten trying to place our order, my mother decided she would enjoy a dessert in a calmer, less chaotic environment. The birthday cupcake never came and we left the restaurant feeling frustrated and with slight headaches.

4.0,9/22/2018,"Met up with two other couples at ABC kitchen for dinner.  The space is big, dark and interesting.  It's a bit loud, but the loudness helps isolate people in this festive space.  The waitstaff were uniformly excellent (and attractive).  We started off with some really good bread and olive oil.  Cocktails were on point, though my martini was brought on the rocks instead of up.  They're poured tableside, which I really like.  My main complaint about ABC Kitchen is the rapaciously priced wine list.  Even the obscure wines are expensive.  It's a challenge to find a good bottle of wine for under $100.  IMHO, every restaurant should offer a reasonable bottle of wine for $50 or $60 and let people who want to splurge do so.Rant over- on to the food.  The famous carrot salad was delicious.  The crab toast was very good, but mayonnaise heavy.  The fried calamari was perfectly cooked.  We split a bacon and clam pizza as an appetizer.  Unless you're a rabbi, how can you improve on this?  The crust was light, but firm and chewy.  Main courses were all well received.  The salmon was delicious. I had the monkfish which was excellent, but the portion was small.  Everybody who ordered a healthy entree were drooling over the diner who ordered the burger. He dropped out of the dinner conversation in order to concentrate fully on scarfing it down.  I know that Pete Wells is down on sundaes as desserts because they're a cop out, but I highly recommend the excellent one served here.  It's salted caramel ice cream, fudge, nuts, caramel and a bit of whipped cream.  Just typing that made me smile.Great restaurant, but not perfect- 4.5 stars.  A festive place to have a really good meal.",0,0,0,Joel S.,"New York, NY",37,675,16

They just weren't that great so it was like why aren't these just included? The chicken was  juicy and crispy but again, nothing out of this world. The blueberry pie and ice cream were  delicious.

4.0,9/8/2018,"A very solid Farm-to-Table JG establishment with the expected beautiful, spacious and light interior and semi-trendy, energetic vibe.  It's a nice break from the typical dimly-lit establishments.  The staff here, as can be expected, are very knowledgeable and attentive.  The food itself is simple but well-crafted and prepared so that the freshness of the locally-sourced ingredients and the innate flavors are brought forth with minimal alterations.  Definitely worth a try and great for a small dinner with friends - highly recommend sharing the dishes.  1. Fried chicken: Light and crispy seasoned batter with juicy and tender breast served with a spicy butter.  It's delicious - make sure you dig in as soon as it is served as it's best when hot and fresh from the kitchen!  The accompanying sauteed chard is a perfect complement to the fried chicken.  2. Crab toast: If you are a crab lover, this is a must-try.  Topped with a very generous portion of fresh lump crabmeat and a tangy refreshing lemon aioli.  A great starter and perfect for sharing - unless you are like me and love crab.  Then order at least 2 servings.3. Black Sea Bass: Tender sea bass seared to absolute perfection with a hint of basil and spice from the slices of jalapeno on top.  The accompanying sauteed spinach was a perfect pairing - light, silky, and savory.  The side of seasoned and simultaneously crispy and tender roasted potatoes completed the dish . 4. Buttermilk cheddar biscuits: Absolutely delicious - buttery and flaky with the perfect amount of cheddar.  If you thought that Red Lobster's Cheddar Bay Biscuits are good - you have not tried these.5. Pretzel-crusted calamari: I couldn't actually taste the pretzel flavor in the crust but that aside, the calamari itself is quite tender and good with an extra salt kick (maybe that is from the pretzel crust?).  The mustard and tomato aioli add a nice spicy kick.",1,1,1,Danan R.,"New York, NY",924,1915,85

5.0,9/3/2018,"Coming from the Midwest, my expectations were not very high for a 'farm to table concept' in the middle of Manhattan.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurants ability to serve up traditional American fare (much of which is sourced organically and locally) and at the same time provide a contemporary twist on these dishes.Huge fan of the interior environment, a mixture of modern and rustic.  I love the spacious seating arrangements - probably one of the most spacious, private seating arrangements for four I have experienced in an popular manhattan restaurant.  Food is exactly what I would expect from a farm to table concept - traditional dishes with focus on fresh organic ingredients. Appetizers - calamari is awesome - fresh, not chewy, and perfect amount of outside crisp.  Crab toast is probably their most popular appetizers - it was very good - overflowing with crab meat and they allow the crab to shine with low seasoning / mayonnaise.  Cheese and meat board was also good - appreciated how the waiter spent a good deal of time explaining the sourcing and preparation of each item.  Roasted carrot salad was also very good and would recommend for a share.Entrees - hands down the fried chicken is the best dish on the menu - and probably is one of the best in the city.  Super juicy chicken breast and an amazing light breading around it.  The breading is so light and crispy I thought it was a cream puff outside initially.    The pork chop is probably my number 2 on the menu.  Beautifully prepared with the perfect cook and seasoning.  Sea bass closely follows the pork chop, and would be a great lighter fare option.  Wrapped up the meal with a decadent blue berry cobbler with a side of goat milk ice cream.  I usually am not a fan of anything goat related - however the added sharpness to the ice cream as the perfect compliment to the sweet cobbler.Awesome meal. Highly recommend.  Use open table to book in advance as they get very busy.  Will be back.",1,0,2,Stephen C.,"Cincinnati, OH",123,109,567

We started with the fluke, cucumber soup, goat cheese pizza, fettuccine, calamari, and crab toast. It sounds like a lot of appetizers but the portion sizes were small so we were able to order entrees as well. Everyone agreed the food tasted good but our favorites were the pizza, pasta, and crab toast. Everything did taste fresh and homemade. For entrees we got the sea bass, monkfish, and pork chops. We didn't really share but everyone enjoyed their own respected dishes. For dessert we got the chocolate cake and almond cake. Both were different and yummy in their own way.

4.0,8/30/2018,"Food: 4/5Ambiance: 4/5Service: 4/5Value: 3.5/5I've been here a few times over the years, and nothing is quite ""wrong"" with this place but the food doesn't excite me. I also find some items overpriced. This is (I think) an older JG restaurant, and the menu reflects what was 'en vogue"" 10+ years ago. However, the space itself is completely modern and beautiful. Crab Toast (5/5) is something I could eat all the time, the crab is so fresh and sweet! Calamari (4/5) is fine, it's not the crunchiest and I didn't detect ""pretzels"" but the dipping sauces are good. Kale salad (4/5) is quite zingy but really needs a few more elements to justify $17. Fettucine with beans and pesto (3.5/5) is just pretty boring. I liked the summer squash pizza (4/5) much better - the crust was crisped almost as if fried. I wouldn't recommend the Black sea bass (3/5) unless you are dieting... served in a too-salty clear broth like a chinese steamed fish preparation. Definitely go for some fried chicken though (5/5). It was one of my favorite things, the exterior is ULTRA crisp and light. I was also a fan of the pork chop (4.5/5), a well-cooked thick slab with classically good pairings of cherry and crispy onions. I dared not order a side vegetable again, last time our greens were literally 4 bites. Save room for dessert. A large slice of chocolate cake (5/5) is airy and bouncy; the crumbly almond cake (5/5) is surprisingly addicting; and the sundae is the salty sugary dessert bomb to satisfy sweet tooths. TLDR: a solid safe spot for taking the parents, last-min special events, and a good option in this area.

1.0,8/24/2018,"We love good food. We live in NYC and enjoy trying all the culinary delights in this wonderful city. Last night a friend and I went to ABC Kitchen because of their rave reviews over the years. Except for their pretty decor, this may have been the worst meal I have ever had in this city known for amazing food. My friend ordered a appetizer cucumber salad . It consisted of a quarter of a thinly sliced cucumber swimming in a liquid dressing  on a plate the size of a teacup holder.. I had a salad of thinly sliced squash , cheese and withered arugula also swimming in liquid,on a plate slightly larger. The main course was even worse. My friend had unrecognizable Sea Bass on a very small bed of spinach. It was smaller than an appetizer size and not very good. I had a piece of Salmon on top of a succotash combination swimming in vinegar. All of this carried an above average price tag and attitude! For dessert we shared a piece of their signature blueberry pie which was a step above a pop-tart in both size and taste. The server didn't bring bread to the table although the table next to us did receive it. New York is the Mecca for some of the best food in the country. This restaurant was not worth any of the hype!

We also had the calamari, the roast carrot and avocado salad, and the line caught tuna sashimi. Everything we ate was flavorful, beautifully presented, and came out relatively quickly as well.

3.0,8/18/2018,"Great, but overpriced. The JGV name carries a lot of weight, and in this city, that weight comes along with prices that are about 20% more than they should be. However, I found the value of this place and the quality of the food to be substantially better than the Latin sister ABC Cocina.Went with a large group and split a number of appetizers among the table. My favorites were the roasted beets with yogurt ($14) and the crab toast with lemon aioli ($16). The beets were absolutely phenomenal and the yogurt was unlike any I've had before. The missable dishes were the roast carrot and avocado salad ($17) and the summer squash and arugula salad ($16). Neither were bad, I just found them to be the least-exceptional and most-overpriced of the apps. The pretzel-dusted calamari ($18) was great, but no better than calamari I've had other places. I enjoyed all the appetizers and found, later, that they were the highlight of the meal. We each ordered our own main dish - typically I would have headed straight for the cheeseburger, but being that I was at a business dinner I opted for the cleaner and more sophisticated monkfish ($34), which was served alongside summer squash, tomatoes, and basil. I had only had monkfish once before when it was one of the choices for the catch of the day at Seamore's, but remembered liking it. I'm not sure if it was something in the fish itself or the flavoring, but I was unimpressed, both by the dish and the portion size. For dessert, we again passed around a number of dishes. The best, by far, were the blueberry pie with goat milk ice cream and lavender ($13) and the peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream ($12). The almond cake and chocolate cake (the latter especially) were remarkably dry and bland. The interior is awesome and clearly adorned with pieces from ABC Carpet & Home. Service was professional but not stiff. All in all, I've found the JGV's restaurants excel with fruits and veggies but have yet to master meats/fishes/etc. Will try abcV at some point to test my logic.",3,1,1,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1025,331,1186

We got started of with a basil lemon soda and a gin based cocktail. They were very good. We got the heirloom tomatoes and the cucumber coconut soup which was also very fresh and rustic. For the entrees we got the salmon and the veggie burger. The salmon however was a little overdone and the veggie burger was decent. We ended our meal with an almond panna cotta which was perfect.

5.0,8/12/2018,"Came here for restaurant week. Food;You get complimentary bread. I would recommend accepting it as you can dip it into the amazing sauce from the shaved raw fluke appetizer. For the appetizer I got the Shaved raw fluke with market radishes, picked green strawberries and herbs. This was my favorite. The presentation was on point and was consistent with top quality and price. Beautiful assortment of colors, flavors, textures and finesse. This was an insta worthy dish. You are pretty much eating a garden with beautiful little flowers. The flavors we're sophisticated and blended so well together. This dish was a perfectly light and refreshing dish for the summer season. For the main course I got the seared salmon on the Bibb salad with market vegetables and a spicy buttermilk-herb vinaigrette. It was okay. It was certainly quite big and very filling. The food tasted fresh with good quality ingredients but I thought it could have been more creative. The vinaigrette reminded me of some sort of spicy ranch sauce and that wasn't something I expected in this type of establishment. So food wise, get the shaved raw fluke.Service; This was wonderful.

The toast is thoroughly soaked with lemon aioli which balances out the fishy taste and adds so much flavor and freshness. I couldn't stop eating it! My bf had the egg benedict which was good as well, the ham and the crispy potatoes are all cooked to perfection although it looks very simple. Well sometimes it's hard to make simple dishes really memorable... We also had the roasted portobello which has a simple pure mushroom taste, some might think it needs more seasoning but I actually feel like it's nice to taste the simple flavors of good ingredients.

5.0,8/8/2018,"ABC Kitchen is just a little too popular (and pricey) for me. However, it's the best of the ABCs and I accept that it's a vanguard of the NYC dining scene.The host at the front had excellent people skills and dealt gracefully with having to tell pretty much everyone that their tables were ""almost ready."" We waited about 15 minutes for our table on a 7:30 reservation; I maintain that the ABCs overbook their tables. Bartenders were also great and transferred our tab easily to the table. The bar area is nice, with a tastefully distressed mirror, and there were actually a decent amount of people eating in the area, though it seemed a bit noisy to me.I started with the Barrio Paloma ($16), which fits my usual love of tequila drinks, though it is on the spicy side. My other drink of the night was a glass of minutolo ($14), which was a new grape to me but delicious. It's an unbelievably cheap bottle for retail though, and one of the first time I've seen a glass over the price of a bottle!I started with the signature crab toast ($16), which had a nice pure crab flavor on a toasty bread, and a generous amount of it. The squeeze of lemon really elevates it.Black sea bass ($34) was hands down one of the best fish I've had in a restaurant. Soft flesh, crispy skin, beautiful broth. It irks me that fish is so often seen as the boring choice (and they certainly don't make it sound too exciting on the menu) when it can be so completely flavorful. Just loved this.We also had a side of broccoli rabe ($11), which had a ""fresno chili sauce"" that I mistook for pure sriricha. They actually do a great job with double whammy of the tough texture and the bitter taste that rabe typically has, but I wouldn't say you need it.Service seamless, pacing natural. The decor here is more romantic and less try-hard than the other two ABCs. Just a nice spot with a buzzing atmosphere.It's all very simple and farm-to-table in a way that feels outmoded now, and you feel a bit silly paying these prices (it was over $100 per person with 2 drink, a starter, and a main), so it's easy to discount the experience, especially given my mixed experience with V (and to a lesser extent Cocina).However, everything was excellently done. Maintaining this level of quality is difficult, and based on Yelp and people I know who come here regularly they seem to do it.

Sometimes places with very trendy aesthetics don't actually have great food. That was not the issue here. The pretzel dusted calamari was very tender. I didn't think pretzel dusting added much to it, but fried squid is delicious so I wasn't upset about it.I, like most basic white girls, must have my carbs. We ordered two pastas, and two pizzas. We got the ricotta ravioli since our waiter described them as ""little pockets of joy"". He wasn't wrong. We also got the fettuccine. My god those noodles were good. They were the perfect thickness and texture. Soaked up the pesto sauce really well. I think this pasta was easily top 3 pastas of my life.The thin pizzas were also very tasty. Structurally didn't hold up super well but was still good. I actually really enjoyed the crust of these pizzas too. They killed it with the carbs here.We also had the Black Sea bass. I think that the quality of the fish, and the technique it was prepared with was superb. It was so tender and just melted in your mouth. I do think that the sauce with it was that flavorful. It might have been intentionally more mild, but I'm not a mild man.No true dining experience is complete without dessert. If you disagree, that's fine. You're just wrong and I hate you.

We were there for my boyfriends birthday. I mentioned this to the waiter AND both hostesses. I was told they'd bring a cupcake and candle. We lingered for a while but eventually gave up. When I mentioned this to the hostess on the way out, he looked confused despite having just discussed this an hour prior and having watched him jot a note by our reservation listing",0,0,0,Alison M.,"Washington, DC",237,13,0
5.0,7/26/2018,"Food: One of the best culinary experiences I have had for a while. Every dish was perfectly crafted to stimulate the right senses! I came here for restaurant week and had the raw fluke (highly recommended!) -- absolutely flavorful and refreshing for the summer. For the entree I ordered the salmon salad which was perfectly cooked medium rare and that dressing though... Drinks: Wow I am impressed with the cocktails! I did not expect their drinks to be as good as their food items! The barrio paloma was perfectly mixed and recommended for mexcal lovers or not! They have a huge wine list but could not pass up the cocktails!Vibe: Elegant, boutique, and its located inside a department store.

5.0,7/24/2018,The food and atmosphere we're both outstanding. My fish was cooked perfectly and the flavors of all of our dishes were so fresh. Both of us we're totally obsessed with the crab toast appetizer and the simple side of peas and carrots. I have never asked a restaurant for a new table placement but the first table we sat at was in a high traffic area.

5.0,7/23/2018,Love this place. They have lot of good vegetarian options on the menu. Service was quick and fantastic.Came here for dinner. The decor is tastefully done. Lot of space as well.However do make a reservation before you go in. Ordered roast carrot and avocado salad along with pesto fettuccine. Everything was very flavorful. One of the best meals I had. Portion sizes were ok. If you are hungry order the dinner portions. Servers are well informed and would ask for our preferences to recommend items from the menu. We were done in less than 2 hours. Everything was perfect.Definitely coming back here again!!,2,0,1,Sunidhi G.,"Jersey City, NJ",190,131,197
1.0,7/22/2018,I've eaten here twice previously. First time they were very obliging I was traveling solo and happily sat at the bar to eat. The meal was very nice. Second time I made a reservation a few weeks out before I departed and I arrived and they had doubled booked!! I told them I'd wait in the bar until they found our reservation & table as it was late December & a very busy time.This meal was nice but certainly not raising the bar by any standards. This visit we stood at the entrance & the obnoxious staff didn't even come over to greet us. They most certainly saw us standing there. If I could swear in this review I'd write exactly what I feel your establishment stands for Absolute B.......C.....I love the store & shop there on every visit to NYC.

5.0,7/16/2018,"This was one of the best highlights of my trip to NYC. I took my boyfriend here for his 27th birthday and this place definitely surpassed my expectations.The crab toast with lemon aioli was one of the best things I have ever tasted. We also had for an appetizer, the shaved raw fluke. At first we were a little skeptical when ordering, but we were definitely wrong. This too was also incredible. The tuna also had so much flavor, definitely a must when coming here.My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken with a hot sauce butter. This sauce was unbelievably tasty I was in shock with how good it was.I ordered the salmon that was cooked over the best mashed potatoes I have ever had in my entire life. The salmon was also cooked to perfection & melted in your mouth.Overall everything we ordered was FANTASTIC. Highly recommend ordering all 5, you wont be disappointed.Also we ordered a bottle of the red Contessa Ava Chianti which was hands down one of the best wines we have ever had. I'm not dramatizing any of this, this restaurants deserves 11/10. To add, the service was also outstanding which made our experience even better than it already was.

4.0,7/13/2018,"I went to ABC kitchen for dinner with some friends. The place has a really cool vibe. It is rustic-chic, with dim lighting and a cozy feel. It would be a great place for a date. We started with a bottle of rose at the counter top by the window, while we waited for out table to be ready.  The rose was perfect after the humidity that was present that day.When we were seated, they brought bread. The bread was cold and stiff. It was pretty hard to chew through, so I would pass on this. Wait for the food itself! For starters we got the ricotta, tuna, and roasted beets. All were super fresh. You could actually taste each ingredient in its perfect form. The ricotta was my favorite! It is housemate and came with a sweet berry sauce. It was just overall incredible! But I loved all three of these things, so I would recommend all (but the ricotta is a must-get).We also had the goat cheese pizza, the roasted carrot salad, and the fried string beans. The goat cheese pizza was a little too charred for my liking, and it didn't have enough goat cheese. It was mostly kale and red pepper flake. The roasted carrot salad was delicious! Very light and refreshing. The string beans were also delightful, a bit greasy, but overall great.We also had the infamous popcorn Sunday for dessert (I had to get it after everyone talked about it on here). It was very disappointing. It was just bland and nothing special. The popcorn was also a little stale. I would pass on this, despite what you may have heard!Overall, great place.

4.0,7/9/2018,"This place was so cute! I love the atmosphere and the place settings. I love the decor, and that they have the fresh vegetables out and you can see them. Our table unanimously decided that this place was ""shabby chic.""We could only get a reservation for 6 people at 5:30pm. I called in advance the same day to see if we could get a later reservation and they told us we could come at 6 but we had to leave by 8 for the next table. I appreciated that they let us come a little later. One of our guests was not able to make it which we let them know when we revised the time of the reservation.When we did finally get there, it upset me that with a larger table of 5 that they wouldn't let us sit till the whole party was there. Who else are you going to give this table to? They also told us on the phone we had to be out by 8 for the next reservation at that table and we wanted to get started! But to no avail.  I would like to note that my table did have a weird request for the food (switching a sauce on a pasta dish) to which the kitchen graciously obliged. We really appreciated that they were willing to do this for us.Regarding service:Overall I was surprised at how slow the service was, and how infrequently we saw our server. I asked the guy that brought out our food for a few things a few times, but he had to send the waiter over. Also, after our appetizers, we had to wait a really long time for our main courses.  Regarding the food:roast carrot and avocado salad, crunchy seeds, creme fraiche and citrus 17 - amazing. Perfect avocado. kale salad with lemon, serrano chilies and mint $17 - it was just a kale salad ‍Fluke crudo - was light and bright - good flavors and texture. Really enjoyed it. Pea soup - it was a lot thinner than I was expecting and was served warm. Was almost like a pea broth. I would have preferred it thicker. Pasta with peas, pesto, parmesan - was good. Ravioli- the guests at my table wanted the ravioli with the pesto sauce instead of the red sauce. They were kind enough to accommodate for us. It was actually really good with the substitution. Chocolate cake - melted chocolate ganache and toasted marshmallow icing. It was okay. The icing was more marshmallow than icing. I couldn't taste the malt at all. Overall a solid meal. I would come back.  The decor was my favorite.",0,1,0,Rebecca D.,"New York, NY",27,94,990

The reservation form online asked if it was for an occasion so we put in that we were going for our (9th!) anniversary. They gave us two mini cupcakes on a plate decorated with ""Happy Anniversary"" in chocolate sauce, which was super sweet and we honestly hadn't expected that. The decor is also really nice. Definitely want to go back and try more of what they've got! Highly recommend the crab toast appetizer & the mushroom-crusted salmon entree.",0,0,0,Alyssa G.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,19,10

All of our dishes were wonderful: the fluke sashimi was perfectly prepared and seasoned, the pork chop was tender with a lovely crust, the calamari was one of the best I've had. Everything tasted so fresh and clean ingredients. I'd definitely come back!",3,1,4,Nina M.,"Laguna Hills, CA",160,233,96
5.0,7/6/2018,"ABC Kitchen's decor is full of contrasts, quirky and fun in many ways yet somehow manages to be trendy and chic at the same time. For example its bare concrete walls in the main dining area are unpainted, with exposed pipes and wirings overhead. On those same ceilings hung some fabulously intricate chandeliers. Strategically placed throughout the restaurant are art sculptures crafted from branches of trees and continuing the wood theme, bar tables carved out from the trunks of trees. In the dining area, modish white tables and chairs are employed. This juxtaposition of styles extended to its tableware, with the restaurant using mismatched vintage floral chintzy plates and a line of distinctly white tableware. After taking in the artistic flair of our surroundings, we turned our attention to the menu and ordered the Crab Toast to start. They were delicious - generous portions of fresh crabmeat on slices of warm toast dabbed with olive oil. Not surprisingly, the wedges of lemon on the side were left untouched. We eschewed traditional brunch favourites and instead chose two fish entrees. The first was Roasted Hake with fava beans & artichoke hearts in a spring garlic-lemon broth. The hake had a wonderful crispy finish but the flesh within was very tender, with a melt-in-your-mouth consistency. The inclusion of fava beans was unusual, but they complemented the fish and garlicky broth very well.  Our second choice, Black Sea Bass with chilies, spinach and basil was equally stellar. The sea bass was seared to perfection, its firm sweet flesh exuded a hint of basil possibly from the judicious addition of basil oil. Sautéed spinach leaves provided layers of silkiness while a few slices of pickled jalapeño peppers atop contributed a touch of heat to this dish. Would recommend getting a side of Buttermilk and Crawford Cheddar Biscuits. These were absolutely scrumptious, buttery and flaky with a lovely salty tang. So impressed were we by the food we ate thus far, that despite being quite full, we couldn't possibly pass up the offer of dessert. We got the Sundae to share. The salted caramel ice cream was fairly regular, except this scoop was lying in a most delightful pool of chocolatey caramel hot fudge sauce with candied peanuts & popcorn and a dollop of freshly whipped cream as toppings.

The dressing was very citrusy and just tart enough to compliment, but not overwhelm the fish.  Bibb Salad was even better - the dressing is tart and spicy with Tarragon, I really loved it.  Nice tender lettuces and the chicken paillard was shockingly lightly grilled and juicy.  My only regret is that I could not indulge in any of the delicious looking cocktails which I saw some (lucky) folks indulging in.

3.0,6/24/2018,"On entering ABC Kitchen, the vibe and the decor totally and completely grip you in. The interiors are chic and the servers are attentive, and the place itself is almost always buzzing busily. I am a loyal patron of Jean Georges restaurants, and I love ABC cocina, so naturally I had very high expectations of my first visit to ABC kitchen.  On a Sunday evening, we had to wait 30 minutes for our table which wasn't so bad. Between the four of us we ordered-Chicken Liver Patè on toast- the flavor was incredible but unfortunately I bit into a sharp piece of plastic while eating it and the server was very apologetic and gracious enough to admit to there being a mistake and to strike it off the bill. We also got a few complimentary sides to make up for this incident.For the complimentary sides we got-  fries, peas and mashed potatoes. I must say that the peas were the best tasting peas I have ever had. Having said that, ABC Kitchen has stellar produce which is sourced fresh and organic and one can taste that in the food too. The fries were nice as well.For mains we ordered-Fried chicken with collard greens- this was the best dish of the night. I have not had better fried chicken and collard greens any where, and I have eaten quite a few. The presentation was beautiful as well.Roasted Carrot Salad with goats cheese and avocado- I loved everything about it. The carrots were definitely the hero of the dish.Grilled Sea Bass- very average. The fish wasn't seasoned well and had a slight smell to it. Unfortunately, I was quite underwhelmed by this dish.Salmon- this too was nothing spectacular.Overall, I realized that the vegetables really do shine in the dishes and it's easy to see why ABC kitchen prides itself in its produce.

My man asked the bartender if she could create something fun with a mezcal base (they have plenty of options on the cocktail list but he didn't like some of the ingredients) and​ she sent out this chocolate bitters inspired ""martini"" and he really enjoyed it. The sweet bartender even came by our table to check on us to be sure he liked it- and the bar was busy - so that was super kind of her to find a moment to do that. I LOVED the Palmoa on the list- with a full sprig of mint! Christian, the Reservation Specialist, personally​ stopped by our table to welcome us.

The carrot salad was delicious, but the tuna dish consisted of just 5 small pieces, and the portobello of one portobello mushroom. While the tuna dish was very flavorful, it was too small for my liking. The portobello dish lacked flavor and was very plain. For main course, we ordered the burger medium well, and it came out literally raw. We sent it back and it took another 20 minutes for it to come back.

I celebrated my birthday with a large group of friends at one of the round tables. They are great for a large group as you can talk to the whole table instead of being only able to talk to the people around you.We started with a round of their cocktails. We ordered around 4 different varieties and everyone was extremely satisfied. They were refreshing and tasty, but not too sugary. We also received fresh bread, which we quickly devoured.For appetizers, we ordered the cured meats and local cheeses, roasted beats with housemade yogurt, housemade ricotta, and pretzel dusted calamari. While all of them were delicious, my favorite was the calamari. The pretzel dust added a hint of salt to the calamari, which made it unique. It's a dish I would return to ABC Kitchen just to get.For mains, we ordered a variety of of dishes including the fettucini, casarecce, and the fried chicken. The fettucini came with a basil-pistachio pesto that is one of the best pestos I've ever eaten. Although all the food was delicious, the fried chicken was the standout. I was nervous when the waiter recommended it to a group of Texans, but we were not disappointed. On the outside it was lighter and more crisp than your typical fried chicken and on the inside it was super juicy and flavorful. I don't think I will ever be able to return to ABC Kitchen without ordering that chicken.Overall, ABC Kitchen went above and beyond my expectations. It was such an enjoyable birthday dinner as they let us take our time throughout the night and we could talk to everyone at the round table. They kindly stored a birthday cake and brought it out with candles. Also, their delicious, but healthy options didn't make me feel as guilty for eating out.

All the entrees were tasty, but hard to share since they would give one entree to share between 4-5 people so we would have to figure a way to divide a sandwich and burger.

The asparagus was tasty. Light on the stomach and has a unique flavor - definitely a good option if you want something healthier. The fried chicken was amazing as well. It was very crispy while still being nice and tender on the inside. The sauce that it came with was sweet and spicy; it went perfectly well. The service was great, the prices were fair, and overall I left highly satisfied.",1,0,0,Anthony M.,"Austin, TX",585,365,557
5.0,6/2/2018,"ABC Kitchen was amazing! The fried chicken and extra side of mashed potatoes were absolutely epic. The skin on the juicy fried chicken was crazy crispy and thin, and the collard greens it came with was super flavorful, thanks to the hot buttered sauce in the dish. The mashed potatoes were the creamiest, most decadent mashed I have ever had. I will definitely be back just for these two dishes!We also had the whipped ricotta, green pea soup, and pesto pasta. The pasta was also fantastic, and the whipped ricotta was perfectly buttery.We also tried three desserts - the hot fudge sundae, almond cake, and chocolate Creme brûlée. The desserts were good, but not magical like the entrees.",0,0,0,Dorothy T.,"Santa Monica, CA",182,95,129
2.0,6/2/2018,"Wow I came here hearing that it's really hard to get reservations and I managed to get one! Imagine how excited I am to try it.We got the crab toast, fried chicken, and crispy pork confit, and fettuccine.The crab toast, like all others have said, is the best item and you have to get it. It's basically some buttered crab on some well toasted bread. I don't think it's particularly hard to make...but it is very tasty.The fried chicken, now that was very interesting. The fried chicken itself sits on some spinach and spicy sauce, so it reminds you of southern fried chicken. What's so unique about this chicken is that it's a large piece that has no bones! How is that possible?? Well they stitch together  chicken breast and thigh to make this possible. So some part of the chicken will be more dry than the others. As for the battering, it's a very light batter. I thought this was an interesting dish, but I didn't think it was particularly good.... Note, if you are sharing this dish make sure you don't just get caught with the red meat or white meat as that makes the experience very different :DThe pork confit wasn't that special either. There are two different kinds of pork. One is the main dish, a bit on the dry side. That's probably why there's mashed potatoes around it. Then there's a more saucy/asiany style pork belly. That is very firm and also very dry. Not that great....The fettecuni was really good. I lied, this is probably my favorite dish from the meal. The pasta itself was so good, it's firm and strong and it feels so fresh. There are a lot of fresh ingredients like the pesto, peas, and other veggies.  Overall this place was a huge disappointment given how good it was supposed to be. Wouldn't recommend spending a decent amount of money here.",0,0,0,Victor D.,"New York, NY",20,407,732
5.0,5/29/2018,"This isn't the first time I've visited ABC Kitchen and it definitely wont be the last. Everything from the food to the service has always been phenomenal. However, this particular experience was so good it's already had me planning for the next time I'll be able to dine here again!Our party of 4 walked in on a Friday evening at around 7:15 PM. Since we didn't have a reservation we were told that we could be seated immediately at the restaurant's communal table or wait until about 9 PM until an actual table opened up. We opted for the communal table, but were also told that since we were a party of four it was likely no one else would be seated at that table with us, which ended up happening! Regardless, definitely be sure to make a reservation if you're looking to dine here for any meal of the day. ABC Kitchen itself emulates a posh french countryside estate (in my mind). Set up with white tables and chairs, along with plants strewn across the space, it definitely gives off nature vibes while still being extremely romantic. Small candlelight's on the table also make this a must for a special date night. When it came time to order our party started with the Housemade Ricotta with Rhubarb and Grilled Bread ($15), along with the Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli ($16). Both appetizers were beautifully prepared and extremely flavorful. You can't go wrong if you order any of these for yourself.When it came time to order our entrees, I ended up choosing the Crispy Pork Confit with Smoked Bacon, Marmalade, and Braised Turnips ($36). This dish really blew it out of the park for me. The pork confit was cooked PERFECTLY. A hearty portion that was also organized well with the other items on the plate. The marmalade added sweet notes to the dish, while the turnips also increased the variety of flavors I indulged in that night. All in all this is a MUST if you're on the fence, or indecisive about what to order.For dessert we ordered the Rhubarb Pie with White Chocolate Ice Cream ($14) and the Chocolate Creme Brulee with Blood Orange Sorbet and Hazelnut ($12). The pie itself was alright, but what really stood out was the creme brulee. Warm from beginning to end, each bite was just as good as the last. The only thing that that left me disappointed was the portion size, but this also may be due to how fast our party devoured this particular dessert. :)Overall this was a great experience from beginning to end, especially since we walked in without a reservation. The servers and staff were hospitable and accommodating from the moment we arrived. I'd definitely put ABC Kitchen on your map if you're looking for the perfect dimly-lit date spot or somewhere to celebrate a special occasion. You can be sure that this restaurant won't disappoint.",2,1,2,Nicholas C.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",240,247,698

The kale salad was measly, flavorless, and not worth the $17 or so. Honestly, the kale salad in any Dig Inn, Sweetgreen, etc is better than the salad here. Ordered the margharita pizza and burger as well, and both were small portions and meh in general. 2 stars for the wonderful service and cocktails.

3.0,5/24/2018,"Went here on a Tuesday night around 7, it was pretty packed. We put our name down for 2 and were told it was about a 20 min wait. We waited outside but after 20 mins decided to go in and wait at the bar. A young man took a drink order but almost 15 mins later we still had no drink. He was clearly a barback and couldn't serve but was going to pass the order along to one of the bartenders. When we saw him again and asked how the drinks were coming he didn't even recognize us. Understandable as it was packed but now we've got no drinks and no table 35 mins later. They resurrected the situation by grabbing a bartender who quickly made our drinks then graciously offered to comp them. We decided to order food at the bar, and as our first dish came the host told us our table was ready, 50 mins later. We just decided to stay at the bar. The drinks were good, as was the food but I wouldn't say spectacular. The ambiance is enjoyable and the bartender who ended up serving us was nice but I would say overall this was average and not worth the hype.

5.0,5/22/2018,I have been so far to a few Jean Georges restaurants and this is definitely one of my favorites! I shared as an appetizer-The Crab toast:  this is like a MUST to order because it's more than delicious! - The ramp and goat cheese: very crispy bread topped with wild onions (which I assume is the ramp) and a few pieces of goat cheese. Sounds simple but it's very delicious tho!- and the beets: it's very refreshing since it was also mixed with a yogurt. For the Entrees we ordered:- the Cheeseburger: okay so the meat was juicy! And I'm talking about dripping juicy. And those burger lovers will know what I'm talking about it is really yummy!! It comes also with fries (: which were crispy baked. -Ravioli: I was not really overwhelmed with it. It lacked a little bit of flavor but that's just my personally opinion -and Fettuccine: it was really good! Amazing flavors combined But I would consider this as a really heavy meal. The desserts which is of course the favorite part:-Chocolate cake: it is a huge piece of cake! But let me tell you one of the best chocolate cakes I have ever had! Chocolate fan? Than this is a must order! (: -Almond cake: smaller piece. Comes with a light ice cream which almost reminded me of a sorbet and fresh strawberries. I liked the nutty crust of the cake I would almost say it tasted a little bit like Marzipan.-Rhubarb pie: this is a small personal pie. Like a whole pie. Just smaller haha. It also comes with ice cream. The pie crust very good- the rhubarb as it is sour. But all in all combined very delicious as well.

4.0,5/6/2018,"Food good, service terrible. The place is big and can get crowded and noisy, so it gets loud. The tables are pretty tightly packed together, but hey, it's new york. The service is way too slow. They need to be more productive and efficient. Or maybe the problem is too few staff. I don't know. But as a customer, I was continually frustrated by the super slow and inattentive service.One time, I ordered the lobster & egg. And then they brought out a completely different dish because they didn't have the lobster dish anymore. The problem was they didn't let me know. Instead they charged me for an egg dish I never meant to order. They should've let me know beforehand so that I could've replaced it with something else or just cancelled the dish. They often made mistakes with our drinks. Got the wrong drink at lunch, asked for the right drink and it just never came. A different time for dinner, a similar situation happened - we got the wrong drinks and we also randomly got drinks we never ordered...  they really need to step it up. It's a pity because I like the food but just can't stand the service. The food's always delightful - doesn't seem to matter what you get off the menu,. For brunch, I especially enjoyed the calamari. The sauce was  sweet and the calamari was light and crispy. Many times when I get calamari (at various places), it always comes too oily and either too soft or too hard. The pieces are usually too large and not sufficiently bite sized. And the calamari is often times too chewy. But at ABC Kitchen, it was delicate but with a satisfying crunch. The french toast was also very good. Very fluffy and egg-y and soft. I thought it was a little too sweet though. But overall, great french toast. The egg looks pretty plain - after all, it's just egg. But it was so good. Every bite was a burst of flavor.",0,0,0,Elei Z.,"New York, NY",109,90,487

The salad was dressed in a slightly sweet and mustardy dressing that paired well with the salmon.Lastly, the almond cake for dessert was sweet and the tart frozen yoghurt on the side was a good balance of flavours.

Had the crab toast was just ok. Not much flavor. Tuna sashimi was ok but lacking imagination; pretty much like you would expect it to be with some diced mint and soy sauce. Pesto pasta was a pile of undercooked stodgy starch. Oily and no flavor; barely touched and server didn't notice although when told it was was undercooked, offered to replace but did not remove from the bill. Ravioli was good.

So happy I got to experience this toast while ramps are in season (something crazy like 3 weeks I think?!) Next we had the kale and Serrano salad with lime. Dayum that Serrano is spicy! Luckily I was avidly to pick them out and give to my husband lol! The salad was great with the tiniest cutest croutons you have ever seen. Next we had the tuna sashimi which was melt in your mouth fresh. I rarely eat raw fish but I saw this dish and knew it was high quality tuna and worth trying. So happy I did! The marinade/sauce it came in was tangy and citrusy. Seriously delicious. The waiter suggested dipping the crusty bread they give for the table into the marinade and OMGGGGG. Next we had the fettuccini with fresh peas and pesto. Seriously refined and delicious. The perfect amount of pasta. Now, as you can imagine by this point I was stuffed. But we had ordered the mushroom pizza and that was up next.  To me, this was the weakest dish of the night compared to the awesomeness of the rest.

I came with a group and we were able to sample quite a few things:Cured Meats & Cheeses: I felt like this was just okay. If you're wanting some apps to share I'd probably pass on this one. Nothing was wrong with it, I just wasn't blown away.3/5Crab Toast: this was super light and delicious. Just the right amount of acidity. Would recommend.4/5Butternut Squash Toast: I think this had ricotta on it but I can't remember the type of cheese 100% (the menu recently switched and I no longer see this option.) That being said, this was by far my favorite appetizer of the night! A little sweet, a little salty, and I truly wished I didn't have to share this one with the group.5/5Tuna Sashimi w/Ginger & Mint: another huge hit. I could've eaten an entire order of this by myself. The marinade was to die for and the fish was super fresh.5/5Pretzel Calamari: a little underwhelming. You couldn't really tell the breading was pretzel (and I never would have guessed if the menu didn't say so). To be fair, I like calamari but it isn't a must order for me, so the fact that this didn't really feel special puts it lower on my list. It just seemed like regular fried calamari to me.3/5Tomato/Mozz/Basil Pizza: a classic dish done well. Everyone loved this and finished the pie with no complaints.4/5Ricotta Ravioli: someone else at my table ordered this and I was drooling over it all night. You get a fair amount of ravioli and this was definitely a nice, hearty dish.4/5Wood Oven Roasted Lobster: OH MY GOODNESS! I ordered this for my entree and I loved it so much, I could've eaten two. It's seasoned with oregano and a lemon-chili vinaigrette which made the taste really intersting, unique, and not something you'd normally expect from lobster. It was different (in a good way) and I'm totally here for it. Best lobster I've had in a long while, and it was both seasoned and cooked to perfection.6/5 Broccoli Rabe: delicious and a good way to sneak some veggies in! It had a chili sauce on it but I couldn't really taste it.3/5Mashed Potatoes: so creamy and flavorful. Order a few for the table, because everyone will want seconds.5/5Overall, I'd definitely come back here.

2.0,4/2/2018,"The food was good, but my overall experience here was undeniably subpar as a result of the service. I will not return - in a city filled with delicious dining establishments that actually have great service, ABC Kitchen is a pass in my book.We ordered the crab toast, asparagus and prosciutto whole wheat pizza, and the sea bass. I'm always skeptical of ordering toast at restaurants, as more often than not it ends up being one slice of bread with very minimal toppings and a hefty price tag. However, given the raving reviews about the crab toast, I decided to give it a try. It was very tasty, with the lemon wedges on the side being a key element. There was a good amount of crab atop the four bite-sized pieces of toast and the bread was toasted to perfection. The pizza was also quite good - I enjoyed how the asparagus was cut (piled into thin circular pieces) and the ricotta was great. However, this dish was a too salty for my taste, likely from the prosciutto. The sea bass entrée was great. We were confused by all of the liquid that the spinach was soaking in, but it tasted fine. There were also random bits of very spicy flavor - I enjoyed it, but it was not enjoyable for my friend who couldn't tolerate spice. I really liked the lemon marmalade that came with the sea bass - it really made the dish.Onto the service - we did not appreciate the waitress' continuous attempts at up-selling. It was not professional and felt dishonest. I don't mind spending for quality, but I am against restaurants that lack honesty and integrity, and attempt to swindle their patrons. I expected more from a restaurant like ABC Kitchen.Also, if you sit at the high top tables you will feel a draft given its proximity to the doors.

Soon as we sat down and ready to order, a white waitress walked to us and told us we can't move chairs at the bar, so I said ""ok, sorry"" while I saw there were a couple behind her taking three chairs with one chair for her purse. So I asked the waitress if she could ask the lady to take her purse and give us the chair. The waitress refused and said: "" Sorry no, we have to have 6 chairs at the bar"" and took the chair away. We didn't want to make a scene so we grabbed our things and walked out, but I think i need to voice out the uncomfortable experience we received from the staff at ABC Kitchen, i don't want to call her a racist but it was clear that other white customers moved around chairs and she rather let the other white lady to put her purse on another chair than give it to us to sit.

ABC kitchen blends casual and classy in a perfect manner, with food and service well worth writing home about.We came here for dinner on a Thursday night and the place was quite packed. The first thing you notice is the rustic chic decor of the place, with loads of unfinished wood and staff in flannel shirts. We had a reservation but spent a few of minutes at the bar while they got our table ready. Food here is a great example of 'farm to table' with some really innovative dishes. We started out with a complimentary salad that had some great roasted carrots in it. For our appetizer we got the crab toast, which was super fresh and tasty! The lemon aioli really adds a bright zing to the flaky crabmeat, and the toast is perfectly crusty. For our mains, we had the crispy pork confit and the fettuccine with basil-pistachio pesto. The pasta was good, perfectly cooked with a fresh flavorful pesto with the caramelized brussels sprouts adding a textural and flavor contrast to the dish. The pork confit was a standout dish! Perfectly sweet and smoky on a bed of creamy braised turnips, this is a must-try here For dessert we ordered the chocolate creme brulee which was rich and creamy and perfectly complemented by the tart and fresh blood orange sherbet. And because it was my wife's birthday, they got us a complimentary little chocolate cupcake with a candle in it - which was one of the richest little bites of chocolate cake I've eaten in a long time!Service wise we had no complaints, friendly and attentive and they did not put a foot wrong throughout our dinner.

Seems ABC, like many of Jean Georges older restaurants, is stepping back from what made it great, casual but attentive service and meticulous attention to the food. On a recent visit both missed the mark. A favorite, crab toast, was peppered with crab shell, a lazy oversight, but one that made it inedible. Service was clumsy, after asking repeatedly for lemon, none ever came, and a bottle of wine ordered far before the mains, arrived well after our entire table had finished. If the sommelier had put the same time into prompt service that he had into grooming his mustache... well, we would have had wine with our meal.

Meh.We had:- Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli - Good.  When we initially saw this, we were surprised it was still on the menu after all this time, after the rest of the meal we were glad it was there.- Cured Meats and Local Cheese - Meats were good, cheeses were so so. One of them was so ammoniated that I mentioned it to the waitress. She said the chef told her ""it was supposed to be."" Seriously? We have eaten at Artisanal and Picholine, places with amazing cheese courses. Ammoniated is not something you strive for. It means the cheese has sat too long and is past its prime.- Roasted Beets with Yogurt - Tasty- Mushroom, Parmesan, Oregano and Farm Egg Pizza - Yuck! We have had it before and it was very good. This time it was ridiculously loaded with what tasted like boiled mushrooms. Last time, it had a good amount of mushrooms, but this was insane. There was no parmesan and very little egg. It tasted like boiled mushrooms. - Roasted Acorn Squash - Could have been good, but every third mouthful had a very strong spice that burned our mouths.- Almond Cake - Good but basic.This was a disappointing dining experience and I don't think we will be back.",16,1,7,Jaimee A.,"Manhattan, NY",2284,1635,654

Even without reservations, we were able to grab a seat at the bar after only having to wait a short while which was lucky. Service was very friendly and attentive. Our food, however, was only so-so this time and that was really disappointing. I got the squash toast and the mushroom pizza while my friend got the calamari appetizer as well as a fish entrée. While I love the squash toast I do think at this point it is a tad overpriced for what it is (and I have personally made it before so I know how much work goes into it). It took a very long time for our entrées to come out and when they finally did my pizza mushroom had clearly been sitting out for a little while-it was a bit cold and the egg on top had been cooked too long and the yolk was no longer runny. My friend's calamari was pretty chewy and her fish dish was very unmemorable. Honestly, if we had been rating ABC Kitchen based on previous visits they would have received four stars easily at the very least, but unfortunately this trip didn't measure up. I still have fond memories of this place, and I do appreciate that we were able to still have dinner here without a reservation.

I also really enjoyed the crab toast lemon aioli, but thumbs down for small portions as a consequence of chic eating. Liked my entree even more, which was black bass with chilies, herbs, spinach and basil. Normally I wouldn't order fish just because I don't think it's worth the price and flavor. Yet this black bass had just the right amount of sweet and sour. Top it off with some baby market potatoes and I indulged myself in a good ol' American dinner.

I'm not a fav of butternut squash when it's served too sweet, this was not at all. It was savory, and the crunchy pumpkin seeds were such a nice touch. The salmon was cooked to perfection, and the dill sauce, radishes, and cucumbers were so complimentary. I LOVED the salmon, still thinking about it!And the chocolate cake was pure heaven. I typically don't gravitate toward chocolate because it can be too rich for my taste, but this was so so so good. I couldn't finish the piece, but I wanted to!

The food is very good--I love the use of fresh vegetables and the seafood is excellent quality. To start, I had the butternut squash soup with toasted pepitos and creme fraiche (delicious on a blustery February day), and my husband had the shaved raw fluke which was dressed in a lemony sauce and melted in my mouth. For the entree, we both got the seared salmon, which we asked to have cooked rare--which they did, perfectly. The salad it was on top of was pretty basic (bib lettuce, radishes) with a spicy dressing; TBH, I could've done without it. It didn't add much to the dish, in fact I felt the dressing overpowered the subtle, buttery quality of the fish. The dessert portions were extremely generous. I got the chocolate cake, which had a toasted marshmallow frosting on it, and my husband got the lemon tart. I thought the tart was better, but both were delicious.

5.0,1/29/2018,"Set a reservation for 5 at 1:30pm about a week before we ate there. This was a good idea because when we arrived it filled to the brink.  When I first arrived, only part of the group was there but they let us get seated before the whole group, what a nice privilege! The decor of abc kitchen was unique and chic (I think that's how you use that word).  The flowers on each table were new daily and it was the little things like that which sets this restaurant apart from your average lunch/dinner spot; the details.  What I ordered was: Butternut Squash soup, Seared Salmon on a bibb salad, and seasonal cookie plate. While we waited for our order, they brought out a sourdough bread which was cold (I am not sure why it was not toasted or put in an oven) and oil. It was actually find of funny, he poured the oil in a little plate and waiter was even impressed with his pour! The food:Butternut Squash Soup: absolutely incredible.  The actual temp of the soup was probably 10 degrees too hot so I needed to wait for it to cool down but I couldn't stop myself, I burnt my tongue twice! The sea salt with whatever nut combined with the creme fraiche (dollop of sour cream) was just a combination I was not mentally prepared for.  I am not sure it would fill me up but if I could, I would want to eat this soup weekly till I was put 6 feet underground.Seared Salmon with bibb salad: Easily the best salmon I have ever had in my 22 years on this earth. I got my cooked medium well which meant that it was fully cooked in the middle but before they served it, they put it on a stove of oil and made it crunchy which unbelievable. Then it comes to the bibb salad (that means that they take giant leaves of lettuce and that is the green part) with cut avocado in tiny pieces with thinly sliced carrots and radishes.  The dressing had kick but also sweet. The combination of salad with the salmon was too much for me. I could not handle the flavors, it was TOO good! When I asked my friends about it, we each thought we could eat this piece of salmon with the dressing every day till we died; what a piece of salmon! Cookie Plate: pretty average. You got a chocolate chip, shortbread with apricot in the middle, sugar cookie and some weird one with a jam in it.  I will say, you can see the picture of the Lemon tart and I think that dessert was the best! Something about lemon tart with a nice crust that makes my mouth water! Overall: The abc restaurants are incredible and during restaurant week they are a steal for the quality and the service! They changed our plates and sliverware between courses which I was impressed by! The type of plates were different for all of us and that was the final touch to a wonderful meal!

You order appetizers and entrees at the same time and they say they have a system that spaces everything out.Appetizers:*Crab toast with lemon aioli - not as much crab taste as I would like, but very fresh.*Chicory and roasted winter squash salad, maple-lemon vinaigrette and goat cheese - loved this, the vinaigrette had a little bit of a spicy kick to it but it worked*Pretzel dusted calamari, spicy tomato and mustard aioli - came out crispy and liked it with the mustard aioli more than the spicy tomatoEntree:*Crispy pork confit, smoked bacon marmalade and braised turnips - AMAZING. Wish I had more. The portions are small. The pork came out very tender and fell apart and the skin was perfectly crispy. There was a nice smokiness to the bacon marmalade and it was also on some mashed potatoes as well as the turnips.Dessert:*Sundae - salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts & popcorn, whipped cream, hot fudge - A delicious dessert to share with everyone. You wouldn't think popcorn and ice cream would mix, but it does.The service was great. We asked our waitress for recommendations and she went through the entire menu explaining what were top picks, which helped us narrow down our choices or reinforce what we wanted to try!The restaurant is so beautifully decorated and it is much bigger inside than expected!The price is a little more expensive than I would like, but it's the price you pay for the quality of food and farm to table style food.",0,0,0,Bernice M.,"New York, NY",2,17,64

For my entree, I ordered the akaushi cheeseburger which was amazing. How can they make a cheeseburger taste even better? Quite amazed. I also ordered this fuji apple ginger drink which was surprisingly delicious. For dessert we got the sundae which did not disappoint. I asked the waiter if he can put a candle on it for the birthday boy, and he actually brought out a chocolate cupcake with a candle, and wrote happy birthday on the plate.

The service was good in the beginning, until the part where the food was supposed to come, but just didn't... and the restaurant was only half filled by the time we were eating ~10pm. We sat for almost 30 minutes between the appetizer course and entree, which was just the raviolis... I didn't expect it to take over 30 minutes between collecting our appetizer plates to receiving it, to cook raviolis.... And they were a bit anti-climatic.

The hosts were welcoming and while I didn't have a drink at the bar, the bartenders seemed engaging and friendly. My friend and I were seated as soon as we both arrived. Our waitress was quite nice and knowledgeable about the menu as well. We both ordered the Kale Salad and added the grilled Salmon to it. We also got the Brussel Sprouts Pizza to share. Our food arrived fairly soon. The salad was really good and the salmon was cooked perfectly. The stand-out, however, was the pizza. It was VERY good. I was glad we ordered it. Not too cheesy, just the right amounts of everything. Brussel sprouts on a pizza may sound weird at first, but trust me, its a good choice. I highly recommend it.My friend, who has been here several times, told me that the dinner menu is excellent as well.

Despite noting it was a birthday dinner on the reservation and notifying the hostess....when I ordered dessert our waitress still forgot to bring out the dessert with a candle. So if you're thinking of celebrating any special occasion here, think twice!! There are many other places that will take better notice of such things.In terms of the food and service, there was much left to be desired, I was definitely expecting more. The service was haphazard at most which was unexpected for a longstanding restaurant. The food was mediocre, one of our main dishes was so salty, the waitress agreed to ask the kitchen to prepare it again, but when it came back it was just as salty as the first time. We didn't want to complain too much and ended up paying for a dish we didn't really eat. Overall, seems ABC Kitchen has gone downhill.",1,0,0,Rachel S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,8,0

We decided to sit at the bar and then they came up to us and offered us a table so that was nice. The menu looked fantastic I can't complain about that!

The first waitress had terrible attitude while our second waitress was very sweet. The food was just OK. We started off with the kale salad which my fiancé liked but I couldn't finish. Which is odd considering I love kale. The chili's were too spicy for me and I wasn't a huge fan of how much lemon was in it. For our entrees, hubby ordered the burger while I opted for the half portion of pesto fettuccine. The pasta was good, very warm and rich sauce. Probably my favorite of the night but again nothing that was WOW. Same goes for hubby's burger, which according to our waitress is Top 5 in Manhattan. The burger was a bit spicy in my opinion.

They were very professional in making sure the table was clean without interrupting our dinner. I must say that this was literally one of the best services I've had in NYC.Now to the food: Roasted Kabocha Squash Toast (5/5) - GET THIS!!! The sweet squash and soft ricotta melted perfectly together it was like heaven in your mouth. I'm still dreaming about it. Crab Toast (4/5) - Seems like a favorite but I preferred the Kabocha. There was a thin layer of crab topped with an addictive lemon aoli. Very good.Crispy Pork Confit (5/5) - HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I don't know what they did to the pork but it was so tender and flavorful. The whole dish was comforting and everyone loved it. Angel Hair Pasta (3.5/5) - We ordered a full size and sadly it looked like an appetizer. The garlic oil was so damn good but the pasta itself was overcooked. Sea bass (2/5) - This dish fell short for me. For $34 I was expecting at least 3oz of sea bass but it was so small. The fish was cooked perfectly but was underseasoned. It sat in this light lemon like sauce not too much of my liking. Plain and boring. Stay away. Mushroom pizza (3.5/5) - Average. The ingredients were fresh and the egg was a great touch. The paper thin crust had a great texture but did not hold up the heavy toppings. This was the least memorable dish of the night.Salted caramel sundae (3/5) - The only dish of the night that came large enough to share but wasn't so spectacular. It was something you can easily put together yourself at home. I'd say skip it. I would most definitely return. My only complaint is that the portion of the food was extremely small. Mid-way through dinner we had to pick up the menu and order more! Nevertheless it was an amazing dinner.",2,0,2,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",88,232,485

Once we finally got the attention of a waitress, things were great but it was extremely irritating being ignored. In terms of food, I really enjoyed everything I ate and loved the ginger margarita. It wasn't too sweet and was probably one of the best margaritas I've ever had.

At first, I didn't realize it since the lighting was so terribly dim that I was barely able to see my food, but then I shined a flashlight and saw an ungodly amount of RAW FLOUR.

If you are going off the Yelp reviews, PLEASE don't believe that this place is for vegetarians. There were I believe 4 entree dishes that were vegetarian. Regardless, the dish I got was perfect! It was hard to tell portion size tho as their menu lists an appetizer price and an entree price.

4.0,11/11/2017,"Gorgeous venue and impeccable food! I've been to ABC Kitchen a few years ago and was blown away by the experience. This time, my family and I cam back to celebrate my parents' anniversary. We made a reservation a few weeks in advance because this place is so popular. We started off with some drinks. We tried the the apple bijou, carrotini, and black mission fig martini. All three were delicious - the apple bijou was sweet and refreshing, the carrotini (my favorite) uses fresh carrot juice, and the martini was dark and strong. They were all $16, which was definitely pricey but it was a special occasion. For appetizers, we had the chicken liver toast, shaved raw fluke with gooseberries, and roasted carrot and avocado salad. The chicken liver toast was delicious, but I the chicken liver was spread so thin that I was left wanting more. The shaved fluke was refreshing with the sweetness the fruits and the kick of the chilis. Our favorite was definitely the salad though. It was actually a generous portion, which chunks of avocados, tufts of greens, and whole carrots. I don't understand how carrots can be that sweet and flavorful! For mains, we had the angel hair pasta with saffron, black sea bass, and crispy pork confit. The pasta was a bit of a let down. Although the taste was good and I liked the chunks of ricotta, the pasta was too soft and came out lukewarm. The sea bass was cooked just right, but the taste wasn't memorable. The pork confit on the other hand was amazing. I loved how they gave you two types of preparation - one that was crispy and one that was stewed until incredibly tender. For dessert we ordered the apple pie with Saigon cinnamon ice cream. The pastry was flakey and the center was gooey, and it paired nicely with the ice cream. We also got two mini chocolate cupcakes as a gift from the restaurant. It was such a sweet surprise!Overall, it was a lovely dining experience!

It's a beautiful layout and when you step inside you forget you're in the middle of a crazy city. My friend and I did the prix fixe lunch, and for $30ish it was good for the price. But, I definitely expected the food to be way way better. The butternut squash soup was good. I think out of all the dishes, this was my favorite. It was creamy and flavorful but not too dense. But it was lukewarm and I don't like lukewarm soup. My friend ordered the roasted beets with yogurt, and that was pretty good, but nothing to rave about. For the main course I ordered the angel hair pasta. That was quite mediocre. It was really oily and had no flavor. Like not even salt. I asked for some crushed red pepper and 20 minutes later, I did get it, but by that time I kind of ate enough of the bland pasta and I remained unimpressed. My friend ordered the salmon though, and said it was delicious. For dessert I got the salted caramel sundae, which was yummy but it was huge. It was for like 4 people. I felt so bad about wasting it! My friend ordered the almond cake, and that was amazing. I should've ordered that instead. Overall though, the portions of each course were huge. For a 3 course meal, I feel like you should make the portions a bit smaller so that you can eat everything?? But I guess that's good in a way. We did take home all the leftovers.I definitely recommend making a reservation. When the restaurant opened up at 12pm on a Tuesday, it was packed by 12:30.

Once we were seated we perused the menu and then waited. Waited. Waited. Where was our waiter? We wanted to order a drink but 15 minutes had passed and noone had even come to introduce themselves to the table.  Weird considering the restaurant was not full.  I finally had to ask someone to send our waiter over.By now we had also decided on food so we were able to order drinks and food at the same time.The appetizers came to the table - we ordered crab toast (still amazing, my favorite dish on the menu), ricotta toast which was good and the carrot and avocado salad, also good. They bought the bread to the table and water but still no drinks.The drinks only arrived as we were finishing the appetizers - which was a little frustrating as it got to the point where we had to check where they were.My friend then found a fly floating in her glass of water - quite off putting.  She asked for a new glass which was brought over promptly as well as a personal apology from the manager.On to the main dishes.  I ordered the fried chicken, my parents the pork and my friend the salmon.  We received a side of mash potato and a side of squash.Everything was brought to the table except my friends salmon.  We were told someone else had taken it for another table by mistake? We wanted to be polite so we waited before we started. We waited about 3 minutes so not that bad but i feel they should not have bought anything to the table until they were all ready.I have had the fried chicken before - usually its great, this time it was just OK.  It was quite fatty in parts.  The pork was great, the salmon was OK.For dessert we ordered the almond creme brulee and the almond cake.  The manager bought over a complimentary caramel sundae as a way i suppose to apologize for things.I expect better of ABC kitchen based on past experience and the price point.In NYC there are so many amazing options especially when you are willing to spend the money - next time i will take a seat at the bar and order the crab toast and a glass of wine.  I wont waste my time and money to enjoy the full dinner experience.  Such a shame",1,0,0,Alex F.,"Manhattan, NY",323,13,2

4.0,10/15/2017,"It's pretty unique for a restaurant to maintain its cachet and cool factor 7 years from opening, even more so one tucked into a home furnishings store.  But there is good reason for ABC Kitchen's continued success - good, straightforward food at reasonable value; lively atmosphere and consistent performance. We had another solid dinner here last weekend. It's upscale, but casual enough that things are relaxed and breezy. Good place to bring friends.Atmosphere- Rustic and eclectic, refurbished loft type of vibe which maintains the downtown cool factor (= those uncomfortable metal chairs).- Relaxed, great for meeting friends or casual date, but still very vibrant and active, it gets quite busy after 8pm-ish.- Not a fan of the back room (which connects with the store and ABC Cocina), you're basically under brighter fluorescent lighting and miss the ambiance of the main dining area. Think it's more often used as a group dining venue. Try to sit in main dining areas.FoodHas always been solid, good flavor combinations and well prepared, if not particularly exciting. Seasonal touches keep the menu refreshed. We enjoyed all of the items ordered on this visit. We sampled:- Housemade Ricotta, Fig Compote, Grilled Bread ($15): Shines in its simplicity, a great way to start.- Roast Carrot and Avocado Salad, Crunchy Seeds, Sour Cream and Citrus ($17): Love the cumin and pumpkin seeds, nicely balanced and a favorite of ours.- Chicory and Roasted Winter Squash Salad, Maple-Lemon Vinaigrette and Goat Cheese ($16): Really enjoyed the maple flavor, evocative of the fall, though it is rather heavy to call a 'salad' with the amount of squash. Would order just one of the two preceding.- Casarecce with Fennel Sausage, Broccoli Rabe and Shepherd's Basket Cheese ($28): Excellent pasta, classic flavors - nothing particularly unique, but well done.- Fig, Prosciutto, Arugula and Chilies Pizza ($20): Similar to the pasta, classic flavors done well - nice crust.- Toasted Almond Creme Brulee, Vanilla Sorbet ($12): Excellent, the almond flavor makes this classic much more interesting.BeverageAppreciate the fact that the wine list contains many options by the bottle that are not exorbitant. It really matches the food and vibe quite well. On this visit we tried the 2014 Francesco Clerico Barbera d'Alba ($56) which was a good pairing with the pasta and pizza once it opened up, though not particularly my favorite of this type. In the past we really enjoyed the Montinore Pinot Noir from Oregon which is also nicely priced at $52.Service- Similar experience as on prior visits: starts off strong, place becomes very busy later into evening, lags start to increase.- Our waitress was very personable, and pleasant to deal with though she became stretched pretty thin.",0,0,0,D.

Took out of town friends there after seeing a Broadway show, so around 11pm, and was a bit embarrassed by how subpar the service was and how it dampened our really good moods we'd had walking in there. The food is still tasty (my cod was a bit salty), the setting is pretty, but the waiter had an attitude, didn't make eye contact, and then neglected our table for the majority of the meal. A bus person who brought our entrées over just plopped them down on the table and ran off. Our waiter never checked in after we got our entrées. My friend had wanted to order a drink but couldn't because no one ever came at all the entire time we were eating that course. Then we sat there for a good ten minutes after our plates were empty before flagging down the one really attentive bus woman and asking her for our check. Also, the bathroom was filthy -- toilet paper all over the ground in the main one with stalls, a broken toilet paper fixture in the wall of a different bathroom -- and when I told a staff member I was pretty shocked by how slowly she went into action on it, and how spotty the cleaning was when we went back in there later that night. Normally I'm not that picky about service but if you're charging $34 an entrée, the bathroom should be clean and the waiter should check up on you, like, once whole time you're eating your entrée. We felt like the front of house did the chefs a disservice, as well as Jean-Georges's reputation.",0,0,0,Jada Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",223,5,0

1.0,10/4/2017,"THE ABC OF LIES LIES LIES. I have waited tables, cooked in the kitchen, managed and currently own restaurants. My family came to NYC on a family trip and wanted to come to ABC. Made reservations 2 months ago for 9 people at 9p. The reason it was so late is because when we made the reservations we were told their policy is that that is the only time they take reservations for party's our size. When we arrived we were told they were getting the table ready. LIE #1 15 minutes later it turns out they weren't getting the table ready because the table hadn't even finished and were still at the table eating dessert. NOTE:  THE TABLE WE WERE WAITING ON WAS A PARTY OF 9. REMEMBER THE RESTAURANTS POLICY OF RESERVATION SIZE?  LIE #2. The restaurant wasn't straight up with us from the start. I understand that things fall a little behind in the business but for it to fall 30-45 minutes late is completely unacceptable and shameful(we never found out how long it was going to be because we left at 9:35). The manager kept on coming up to us telling us the we're almost done and the check had been presented blah blah blah. LIES LIES LIES (I've lost count at this point). The manager kept saying that they can't ask them to leave. She would never do that to anyone. Finally we got out of her that the reason for it being so delayed was because the party had shown up late. Without a doubt,  at this point she should have told the party that they needed the table because they showed up late. There is absolutely no reason to have a party with reservations wait that amount of time. I don't care if you're the most casual restaurant in town or the fanciest. Who the hell do they think they are? The attitude and ego was palpable. It felt like we were doing them a favor by eating at this restaurant. Someone needs to teach them the ABC's of customer service and the food industry.",0,1,0,Benjamin H.,"Tampa, FL",0,8,0
4.0,10/4/2017,"I've been wanting to try ABC Kitchen for a while, one of Jean-Gorges restaurants. It is locally sustainable and ingredients organically sourced. Tip - definitely make a reservation, and request if possible to be seated in the back area (we sat in the area between ABC Kitchen and Cocina - usually reserved for dinner parties. It was bright and beautifully decorated). My friend and I ordered the following for our dinner: Appetizers - Crab Aioli Toast: highly recommended, it was simple and delicious. It tasted like it was dipped in olive oil but the toast was still crisp, a nice amount of crab meat on top. This might have been my favorite dish although portion is quite small if you are sharing (it was so good, we definitely wanted more!)Ravioli Ricotta - delicious and simple, it was flavorful and the ricotta was a nice touch. Classic dish and very well madeEntree - Ordered both fish for our main. Sea Bass and The fish was okay, well cooked and very healthy and light. It was more in a brothy light sauce versus heavy potatoes. The waiter did point this out to us and suggested we order sides. Portions were a bit small for the price.Dessert - Chocolate cake. Nothing extraordinary but it's chocolate cake! Overall, the ambiance was beautiful. I would consider going here for my birthday - great for groups as they have long tables. ABC vibe decor throughout (the furniture store is next to the restaurant so you can also shop there after your meal!), white wooden chairs and tables, pretty chandeliers, decorations that exude a classy, elegant, yet casual vibe like you could be in somebody's apartment for a dinner party. Loved the decor.",3,0,0,Eva L.,"Manhattan, NY",4,21,10
4.0,10/3/2017,"Even non-foodies know about ABC Kitchen. The ABC enterprise is a total juggernaut in the city. Whether you're lusting after Tibetan art at ABC Carpet & Home or drooling over clean, organic eats at any of the ABC restaurants, you're probably swooning over something here. The sheer number of reviews for ABC Kitchen almost makes me want to save my energy because I'm guessing that most things one could say about this place have already been documented here. But as evidence by that painful run-on sentence, I'm going to take a stab at writing ABC Kitchen up, too. It was a long-awaited trip and the food was delightful. It didn't wow me in the way that I was expected to be wowed, but my expectations were comically high. So considering that, I'm satisfied. We came here at around 8:30 on a Saturday night. And yes, for a primetime reservation like that, you'll need to book pretty far out. It's worth it, just to get the full ambiance of this place. I had already been to ABCv before dining at ABC Kitchen so was already familiar with the general aesthetic at all things ABC, but this was still a treat. Simultaneously trendy, warm, natural/earthy, elegant. Take a lap if you can while you're waiting for your noms to arrive. In addition to a superb wine list, ABC Kitchen has a good selection of cocktails. I get giddy ordering cocktails at the Jean-Georges establishments because I feel like the relative healthfulness of the drinks cancel out the fact that I'm drinking poison. There are always some fruit and veggie components, which is not the norm of mixed drinks. Nowadays I mostly drink wine (I ordered wine with dinner ultimately), but I made an exception for Carrotini here. Vodka-based, carrot, ginger, lime. I'm a health nut and this felt like a proper Juice Press shot--making me twice as happy because it also helped with the whole inebriation thing. The drinking experience was slightly tainted, though. The cocktail took about 30 minutes to arrive. The bartender did pour it in front of us which was a nice touch, but the flair was lost on me given how impatient I had become at that point. My glass of wine ""with dinner"" also didn't pan out so well. Our waiter was emphatic that the Sancerre would pair well with one of our mains (the bass--more on that in a moment), which I factored into my decision-making process. Unfortunately, the wine didn't arrive until long after we were served said main. It was tasty, but tardy. The food here is as advertised. Fresh and organic, clean flavors, healthy and interesting. Nothing wildly creative but all well-executed. We ended up splitting one of the smaller bites, one appetizer and two mains. It was just barely enough food--I was expecting the mains to be bigger, so we could've managed with one more app. Can't have too much FOMO, though. Our eats, below:  Crab toast with lemon aioli: AThe famous crab toast! I was expecting to have my world rocked, and that didn't quite happen. But man, this was still so very good. That lemon aioli on top was key. And as is usually the case with powerhouse toast appetizers (I've had many), I was very sad when it was over. I'll just order 4-6 of these and call it a meal. Roast carrot and avocado salad, crunchy seeds, sour cream and citrus: AThis is the first week it's really been feeling like fall, and this felt like a great transition. Summery with the avo, autumn-y with the carrot. Simply roasted, very warming. Liked the pepitas on top--added some lovely texture. Would've liked a tad more sour cream, but that's just me being nit-picky. Black sea bass with chilies and herbs, baby market potatoes and spinach: AFresh and delicious. Nothing particularly notable but I love sea bass so I was happy with a perfectly-cooked piece of fish atop some yummy spinach. Crispy pork confit, smoked bacon marmalade and braised turnips: A/A+This dish was a lot smaller than expected (they advertised it as being a sizable plate) but otherwise, a sublime combo of ingredients--very well thought-out. The smoke bacon marmalade was pure crap and the greens underneath were super flavorful and held the sauce nicely. I very rarely eat mashed potatoes (I know I know, so sue me) but these were a worthy addition as well. Creamy and rich. Definitely our most decadent dish of the night, but not uncomfortably heavy.",6,2,5,Molly T.,"New York, NY",887,463,1480

Our server was very attentive and we started out with the crab toast, which everyone seems to talk about. I did love the crab but our actual was a little on the burnt side which I didn't love. We then shared one of their amazing pizzas with a million mushrooms, it was definitely on the unique side and we enjoyed that. Then as stuffed as we were after drinks and appetizers, I knew we needed to get some dessert and something told me to get their chocolate cake.

The mushroom, Parmesan, and farm egg pizza was our favorite as it was interesting. At $22, it's probably the best bang for me your buck. We also loved the pork confit. It was almost like Chinese BBQ pork, but elevated. The pork was extremely tender as in melts completely when you jab your fork into it, but they managed to give you a crispy skin on top of it. It's also topped with bacon. We didn't order the fried chicken, but our neighbor did. We were slightly jealous. It looked really good.The okay -Crab toast with lemon aioli was our app. It was recommended by our waitress and the crab meat was fresh, but nothing too special. I did like it more than the crab cakes at Jean Georges. The cocktails at $16 were all just okay. Nothing too extraordinary and we tried almost all of them on the menu. I had to send a spicy watermelon Mezcal back because it was a little too blend.  We thought the strawberry royale was too sweet. Service was alright. Our server was nice. Not super attentive, but we got what we needed.The bad-Crispy mushrooms as a side. They were 3 tiny little mushrooms lightly fried with a lighter aioli type of sauce. The mushrooms weren't flavorful at all and the sauce wasn't extraordinary to compensate for how boring the mushrooms were. They just looked good. They could have given me mini portobellos and they would of have more flavor. Did I mention those 3 tiny mushrooms cost us $13!?!? If you charge that much, they better be special.

2.0,9/5/2017,"What happened here! Meant to make a reservation for ABC Cocina, but made it for here instead. Figured, why not try. WELL left on a pretty bad note and don't think it's worth trying again. The pros: decor was fantastic (so many details even down to the bread plates), prices were what we expected although still high and the ambiance is vary cool. Loud but still calm! The food options were great. Two of the dishes were pretty spicy but didn't have that denoted on the menu (even with just the word spicy), so that was kind of annoying because the same one person ordered them both and was struggling a bit towards the end of her meal as spice isn't her thing. I got the meat and cheese board which wasn't great - three REALLY strong cheeses that didn't go well together, but the meats were great. Also would have loved some thinner bread so that I didn't end up eating an entire loaf just to spread my cheese on something. The service throughout the entire meal wasn't great - we waited a really long time for our food and had to keep flagging random people over because we weren't really even sure who our waitress was since a few different people served us. Our food took over 30 minutes to come out, so we did follow up and ask about that, which I normally don't like to do. It was by no means crowded enough to have things take that long. Our actual ""waitress"" (don't know if we had multiple or she was the main one or what), we super nice and friendly, just wasn't around much. Anyway, we're all finishing up and I asked for some of my meat and cheese board to go as that's easy to eat later and I did have a decent amount of meat left. The cheeses were a little messy after having been cut to spread, so I wasn't expecting to bring home much of that anyway. We order dessert and my to go bag doesn't come out, so I ask and they let me know that they accidentally threw it away and that they're going to just prepare me a new one to take home. I let them know they didn't need to, but that I truly appreciated it as there was a decent amount left. Dessert comes, gets eaten, cleared. Check comes, gets paid, dad goes to get the car, PARKS it again, comes back in and we're still sitting there waiting for the meat and cheese to come back out. Nothing on this dish is cooked, so you would think there would be no delay in bringing another one out. We ask for a third time where it is and the original waitress finally comes out, very apologetic, and says here you go, double cheese and we leave. I thought double cheese just meant I was getting to eat the dish twice, but no, turns out they just put two pieces of each cheese (and already what had been my least favorite part) and NO meat, which is really what they had thrown out the most of. Also, what took an hour to cut 6 pieces of cheese?Really would have originally left it with a 3-4 star rating, but leaving almost an hour later than I needed to for THAT was ridiculous.",3,0,0,Monica F.,"New York, NY",163,193,140

The angel hair with saffron, golden garlic, jalapeños, herbs and fresh ricotta was so simple but had really nuanced flavors and a subtle kick from the peppers - incredible. I actually changed my mind and ordered this after hearing our waitress's description, and the entree size ($25) was a solid, filling portion. It comes in olive oil and our waitress suggested mixing it all together with the ricotta so create its own kind of sauce. My friend ordered the scrambled eggs with crispy oysters and hot sauce butter, which we were told they sell out of every brunch time. Again, perfectly soft-scrambled eggs with deceptively deep flavors. We started with the seasonal glazed donuts to share (one chocolate, one berry), which I would definitely skip next time as they were somewhat lackluster, especially at $10 for two.

Finally we settled on a reservation for 8 ppl at noon for brunch today, Sunday. While there were lots of friendly servers around the restaurant, somehow it took about 15 minutes for coffees to come out after we sat down and ordered them. Two out of four of the coffees arrived w sizable chips in the ceramic mugs and when asked to bring back a new mug that wouldn't cut our faces, we knew it would be ten more minutes until we saw the coffee again. We proceeded to order our meals. Beyond the French toast, I was shocked to see that none of the dishes looked remotely appealing. My Bibb salad with grilled chicken, (which cost $30!), arrived w four uncut lettuce leaves and some scattered veggies that looked like they were taken from my refrigerator at home. NOTHING special. My mother's egg omelette which was ordered plain (she has allergies) arrived full of veggies that she cannot eat. My husband's eggs arrived and literally looked like someone had already eaten the food off of his plate. After my daughter's pasta/butter came, it was spaghetti- which is the only pasta she won't eat. Penne, rigatoni are just more kid-friendly.  They subbed it for some scrambled eggs, which arrived with green garnish all over it. Really?! For a 4 year old?! Just annoying. My husband and I celebrated on our own last nite in pound ridge at Jean-georges' restaurant and it was worlds away from abc kitchen in terms of style, grace, presentation, and food quality and choices.

2.0,8/11/2017,"I have been wanting to try a Jean Georges Vongerichten restaurant for a long time so was excited to book ABC Kitchen during NYC ""Restaurant Week."" First, I want to say that the space is absolutely beautiful and the staff, very sweet & accommodating. Unfortunately, the food was a huge disappointment. I had the gazpacho to start which I did not eat because it was loaded with tomato seeds & skin. It was very off putting. My companion had the kale salad which she found to be overdressed & boring. We each had the saffron spaghetti with ricotta. As served, it was literally inedible for us because of the amount of grease it sat in. It was as if the pasta, which was over cooked & under salted, was sitting in an oil soup. Luckily, one of the waitstaff noticed me moving it from the main plate to my bread dish & asked if all was well. They nicely replaced the dishes but the pasta was still meh - too spicy, under seasoned, too much parsley & too soft. Some Parmesan cheese would have helped I think.

2.0,8/10/2017,"I really wanted to love this place. It has a hipster decor with all the servers wearing plaids. I never had a disappointed experience from JG restaurants. I came here for RW lunch. I ordered from RW menu, but my date ordered a black bass entree from the regular menu. raw fluke for appetizers: this was OK. The aesthetic of this dish was dull and unimpressive. It's simply white on a plate that looked like a paper plate. Taste-wise, it was ok. The horseradish with the fish tasted a bit like eating sushi but with an extra punch.portobello burger for entree: the first bite was delicious. The portobello was juicy and the sauce was awesome. The inner part was extremely SALTY to the extreme that it was bitter. Black bass (non-RW): the black bass had crispy skin but the spinach was inedible. It was so salty that we had to send it back. Worse yet, the new fish she got was significantly smaller than the initial one. The sundae with caramel ice cream was delicious, but they overdid it with too much fudge. It was way too sweet as you scoop to the bottom of the sundae.  Tl;Dr food was salty and they screwed up on the details. I am especially harsh on this restaurant considering its reputation. The service was subpar considering they weren't especially packed for RW lunch and the screwed-up dish wasn't even from the RW menu!",3,0,0,Patrick N.,"New York, NY",321,252,846
4.0,8/7/2017,"I'm visiting New York for two days so I saw the reviews for this place & decided to come. Honestly I'd give this a 4.5 (Yelp should give us that option), & the only thing keeping it from a 5 is the price. The food and service was fantastic. The ambiance was nice, one of the nicest interiors of a restuarant I've ever seen. We got a mixed drink I can't remember the name, it came in a pretty small glass & costs 18$!! For three ppl the bill after a roughly 20% tip came to be over $160, that's pretty expensive. But I can't deny the salmon was delicious, I had the pork confit which I loved (it was pretty small though), and my parents loved the calamari so we had a good time. So 4 stars cuz we were there for just a little less than an hour & unless you've got plenty of dough to spend, Id just eat somewhere less pricier or try out this place once if you'd like.",0,0,0,Megan D.,"Chantilly, VA",3,12,36

Unless you want to just stroll thru and eat by the bar or if you are lucky you might get a table.Tried almost everything on their menu besides their whole wheat pizzas.You can not go wrong with their crab toast, tuna sashimi marinated with ginger/mint and any od their seafood entrees. My favorite is the black sea bass.The bad.My least favorite was their fried organic chicken and their very uncomfortable seating chairs.

Second course was a salmon dish, soft and buttery, and a pasta dish, drowning in olive oil. The other 2 dishes were a turkey sandwich, which was really good and a mushroom pizza, very nice as well.

PWe were seated immediately and asked the waiter for recommendations.  Water came quickly and we placed our order.  We ordered several appetizers for our party of 9.  As the drinks trickled in over a 20min span, the appetizers slowly, one by one came to the table- it was ridiculous.  Over an hour later, we finally got the waiter to come by -  he immediately said the manager would be over shortly to address the long wait.  Her solution 1 and 1/2hr after being seated and waiting for our food, she said she was sorry and said there were three chefs working on our food. At 1hr 45mins, our food slowly started to arrive.  Our long awaited food was at room temperature and not appetizing at all.  Very disappointed.  My niece who was super excited to try ABC, left the table hungry.  Only reason I am giving them one star is because they comped the entrees.  Great place to look at but I do not recommend eating here.",0,0,0,Too S.,"Downtown, Nashville, TN",0,18,20

I won't get into it because its something worth seeing for yourself... We started with some wine and the pretzel crusted calamari-- incredible. They bring out bread too, which was awesome. I split the spinach and goat cheese za and the half size of the jalapeño and ricotta angel hair pasta. The other girls I was with split the other 2 pastas. The raviolis were DIVINE.

4.0,7/15/2017,"My third time dining at ABC Kitchen. Maybe it was the time of year but the experience fell short of the previous two meals. We had a 7:30 Opentable reservation but arrived at 7:15 and were seated in the ""transition"" room where the entrance to the store is and the entrance from the store to ABC Cocina is. Advantages is much less noise, views of the dessert kitchen, and brighter atmosphere. Disadvantages is the area is warmer than the rest of the restaurant.  Our servers were efficient but not particularly personable. Yet, they got the job done and nothing ever went wrong. We began with the Endive and Sugar Snap Pea Salad with parmesan dressing and herbs. There was nothing wrong with it, but there was nothing exceptional about it either and it seemed excessively sweet. Our other appetizer was the Tomato and watermelon gazpacho. I was a little disappointed in this dish since it has a strong tomato flavor with too much tomato skin IMO, and little if any watermelon flavor and was excessively sweet. One of our entrees was the Roasted Hake with Cherry Tomatoes and Basil. For $34.00, the portion was ridiculously small. The sauce was excellent but the fish itself was ordinary. My dining partner had the Black sea bass with chilies and herbs, baby market potatoes and spinach. It was good, but once again sweet. Dessert was Strawberry Rhubarb tart with buttermilk ginger ice cream. This dessert was amazing and by far, the best thing we had. Coffee; regular and decaf were excellent but refills weren't offered. Not a big deal since the mugs they served the coffee in were large and the cost, $4.00, reasonable these days. The servers seemed to work as a ""team"" but somehow missed teamwork.

I had also written on my reservation that it was our anniversary, and they brought out two cupcakes with candles and Happy Anniversary written on the plate!

We had the fluke starter, the roasted carrot and avocado salad, and the pork confit with a side of sautéed hemp greens. It was a bit light, but neither of us were starving. If you come in very hungry, one appetizer and one main per person should be enough. The fluke had such interesting flavors. The horseradish wasn't overpowering and went nicely with the lemon and oil. The roasted carrots had a delicious vinaigrette. I just wish that salad had had a few more seeds. The pork confit was out of this world -- melt in your mouth, and a great combination of smoky and sweet. The sautéed hemp greens were buttery and crispy.

5.0,7/7/2017,"Delicious food, and a killer vibe -- Jean-Georges does it again with ABC Kitchen.Located in the Flatiron District, ABC Kitchen is famed Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's answer to locally-sourced, organic cuisine. The trendy, yet casually-chic venue (located inside ABC Carpet & Home) makes for the perfect setting to enjoy some of the best food in NYC.My boyfriend and I went to ABC Kitchen on a Friday night for his birthday dinner. I had made reservations well in advance, and we were seated promptly upon our arrival at 8 PM. Although I had requested a quiet table (thanks to the advice from other Yelp reviews), it wasn't particularly quiet. Still--the loud noise is just part of ABC Kitchen's vibe, and we proceeded to make the best of the situation.While the restaurant was beautifully decorated, and the service was pleasant (we had no complaints about our waitress or service whatsoever); the real star of ABC Kitchen is simple: it's the food. Because SO many menu items sounded and looked SO good (some of those pictures on Yelp are just drool-worthy!), we opted to share a few dishes, instead of just ordering our own. More specifically, we started with the 'Roasted Beets with Housemade Yogurt', continued with the 'Mushrooms, Parmesan, Oregano and Farm egg Whole Wheat Pizza', and then moved on to the 'Black Sea Bass with Chilies and Herbs, Baby Market Potatoes and Spinach.' Finally, after a little birthday cupcake, we concluded the night by sharing the famous 'Sundae with Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Candied Peanuts & Popcorn, Whipped Cream, Hot Fudge.' Everything was just AMAZING -- it was one of the best meals I've ever had in NYC -- and I don't think I'll ever stop dreaming about that Mushroom Pizza! :) In addition to dinner, ABC Kitchen also serves lunch, and brunch on the weekends. While I have yet to experience those meals, I have no doubt they're FANTASTIC, as well.The restaurant's been a hot spot for 7+ years, and it's still going strong. Reservations can be difficult to get on short notice (especially for weekend nights) -- so if you want to ensure you can get a table at a good time, go ahead and plan your trip to ABC Kitchen well in advance. Trust me, you WILL NOT regret it! The only REAL issue is making the plan to return to ABC Kitchen, once again! :)",4,0,2,Anna K.,"Washington, DC",97,69,190
3.0,7/5/2017,"Out of the 2 reservations I made for our NYC trip, ABC Kitchen was one of them.  It was Sunday night, 9:30pm and the restaurant, although not empty, was not extremely busy.  The night started out great.  We got seated promptly, waters were delivered immediately, and server was friendly.  We ordered some appetizers and entrees to share (3 people).  First off was the Crab toast with lemon aioli.  This was delicious.  The crab was fresh and toast was crunchy!Next was the pretzel dusted calamari with spicy tomato and mustard aioli.  This was also very good.  Calamari was tender with a crispy exterior.  Both dipping sauces were really good. Appetizers arrived in a timely manner and were delicious however once we finished them, we waited almost an hour for our entrees.  About 45 minutes into our wait, we were given another appetizer on the house, heirloom tomato toast, which was also great, and told that the kitchen was a bit backed up.  Finally, our entrees arrived.  Mushroom pizza with parmesan, oregano and farm egg.  This was pretty good, with no shortage of mushrooms.  The farm egg was small and yolk was popped (not sure if that was intentional).  Not bad.Then our pasta dish was the angel hair with saffron, golden garlic, jalapeños, herbs and fresh ricotta.  This was a huge let down.  The angel hair was clumped together and cold.  The fresh ricotta was clumpy and none of the flavors really came together.  Our experience at ABC Kitchen started off great and slowly went downhill.  I'm not sure what caused the backup in the kitchen considering the restaurant didn't look as busy but it seemed as if the pasta was ready to go 30 minutes before the pizza.  Definitely an oversight on someone's end.",2,0,2,Sennett L.,"San Gabriel, CA",330,559,116

5.0,6/18/2017,"So pretty much I was blown away by this restaurant. I had been wanting to try ABC Kitchen for such a long time but you have to make a reservation early enough to get a table. After a few unsuccessful attempts at securing a reservation, I made it my mission to go to ABC Kitchen for my post-graduation lunch. The earliest you can book a table online on Open Table is 1 month before the actual reservation so I waited until midnight exactly one month before the day I wanted to have my graduation lunch, and then I successfully reserved a table for 8. I was ecstatic. Finally the day that I get to experience ABC Kitchen comes. As soon as I walked in I was amazed. The decor is so pretty with its beautiful light fixtures and flower arrangements, and the space is quite large. I would say the decor of ABC Kitchen is similar to that of Anthropologie so if you like the way Anthropologie looks you will definitely like this restaurant's layout. Now for the food. I was incredibly impressed. Being a party of 8, I was able to try many dishes including the roasted beets with housemade yogurt, crab toast with lemon aioli (OH MY GOSH TOO GOOD), spring pea soup with carrots and mint, pretzel dusted calamari, roasted portobello and celery leaves, housemade ricotta ravioli, akaushi cheeseburger with herbed mayo and pickled jalapenos, a side of the roasted asparagus, and the salted caramel ice cream sundae. I loved everything I had. Usually when I eat out there's at least one dish that isn't that stand out but not in this case. The one dish that I was absolutely in love with was the crab toast.  The crab was so fresh and had an excellent taste to it. My table of 8 ended up ordering two more orders of it, and I ended up eating about 2/3 of those extra orders. No regrets. I was also a huge fan of the roasted beets with housemade yogurt and the roasted portobello. But again everything was good. As for dessert, the salted caramel sundae surely did not disappoint especially with popcorn being in it. Similar to the food, the service was on point. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. My graduation ended earlier that I thought it would so I called ABC Kitchen asking if there was any way I could bump up my reservation an hour. I was expecting a ""no"" knowing how busy they are, but they were able to bump us up 30 minutes which was awesome.  In addition, even though we ordered many dishes and drinks being a large party, the service was quick and no mistakes were made.Since one of my family members told our waitress that I had graduated that day, our waitress brought me a very cute mini cupcake and wrote congratulations with chocolate fudge on the plate. Not only was the cupcake cute but that was also delicious.Overall, I was delighted with my experience, and even though my expectations of ABC Kitchen were already high, my expectations were exceeded.

Luckily for us we love to share, the chefs did an outstanding job splitting everything up before they even came out. Just to make things slightly complicated we asked the bar tender to get creative with a whiskey drinks, a perfectly done whiskey sour infused with a hint of orange and bitters swept us off our feet. The menu was quite detailed and provided a variety of options. We shared two appetizer/starters. The tuna ginger deluxe sashimi was absolutely mouth watering greatness. A taste I will never forget! Followed by the carrot avocado salad (a suggestion by the waiter) it was also very delightful! By this point we were already enthusiasts but we still had a few courses left. We ordered the buttery fried chicken with greens and it was probably the best chicken dish I have ever ordered. It was buttery, Spicy and cooked to perfection. Our dessert followed in perfect timing, this is the part I am always most excited about! The strawberry rhubarb pie was yummy but with the only let down of the night hardly had any ""filling"" with rhubarb and strawberry to it. It was mostly crust.

3.0,6/8/2017,I've been to ABC kitchen on a few occasions.  Once for brunch and two times for dinner.  My first visit for dinner was great.  We enjoyed everything that we ordered.  However on my most recent visit for dinner the food was just not good.  I ordered the carrot avocado salad as an appetizer as I did the first time and it tasted completely different.  The taste of spices and vinegar was so overwhelming that neither I nor my friend could finish the dish.  For an entree I ordered the angel hair pasta which was bland and flavorless.  Service was very good but I unfortunately will not be returning due to the meal I had.,2,0,1,Jennifer B.,"Yonkers, NY",31,120,510

Where I feel it loses a star would have to be in the details that make me willing to spend so much on lunch or dinner. I agree the food is awesome. For the money, I'd like a magical experience. Greeters at the door have a somewhat frosty attitude. You don't feel that welcome. Although there were many open tables, we were told to sit at the bar. Although the bartenders and servers were excellent, they were discussing the lack of lockers available to them right in front of us.

We had reservations for 6:30, I walked expecting the place to be pretty quiet for a 6:30 dinner but there was already a wait for the walk-ins. We started our dinner with some complimentary house bread and olive oil, which were good. For appetizer we decided on the house made ""Ricotta cheese with Rhubarb compote and grilled bread"" and it was fantastic! The ricotta was just the right texture! It was creamy and not too heavy and with the rhubarb compote being the right sweetness. The grill bread tasted like it was char grilled with herbs. It was a great start! For mains we tried the ""spinach, goat cheese and herbs pizza"" and ""angel hair pasta with saffron, jalapeños, garlic and ricotta"" Both were delicious. The pizza had a good balance of herbs to spinach, spinach was not overpowering the entire flavor of the pizza. The pasta was cooked perfectly and had a good saffron flavor seeping through each bite. We were already full by the time we were done with mains. But the hit of the evening is yet to come.For dessert we went for the ""Salted caramel ice cream with caramelized popcorn and peanuts with hot fudge"" Sundae! And this really made our day! I am not a huge fan of chewy caramel but this ice cream with the dark chocolate fudge was a heavenly combination! The perfect amalgamation of popcorn, peanuts, caramel with chilly ice cream and hot fudge brought a lot of textures and dimensions to each bite.

We both had the eggs Benedict, which were excellent, with lots of generous ham and a small portion of large cut home fries on the side. They have an interesting menu of brunch cocktails and a variety of sodas made in house. I had to try the apple ginger, which was a not-too-sweet fizzy delight. My friend's Paloma was well made and was rimmed with lavender salt, which was a fun touch. I didn't see coffee on the menu, but they have both regular and decaf, which were excellent and served in old fashioned real silver services, and were $4 each. For dessert, the cookie plate really caught my eye, especially the rose sugar cookie since I love anything rose flavored. Sadly, it tasted just like a regular sugar cookie with no rose flavor whatsoever. But, the rest of the treats were great. I especially liked the mallomar and the lemon cookie.

4.0,5/11/2017,"Great food and wine, great service. I moved to NYC from a little town in Texas so it took me a while to wrap my head around how there was a well-known restaurant inside a carpet and furniture store, of all places. But ABC Kitchen is so established for a reason. My friends and I tried several dishes for dinner - Crab toast with lemon aioli: I would literally come back just to eat this toast. The crab is so fresh and tender, and worked so well with the toast and aioli that my heart did palpitations. I think everyone should try this at least once.Shaved raw fluke with horseradish, celery root, and lemon: Very refreshing in its lightness, but also very, very, horseradishy. I didn't get much of the other flavors as everything was drowned out by one note.Pasta with pork ragu and chile oil: I think this was taken off the menu so I can't find the exact name now, but in any case, it was delicious. Very interesting combination of traditional Italian fare with Chinese chile oil. I hope this comes back sometime!Fried organic chicken with collard greens and hot sauce butter: This'll make you regret every bad decision you've ever made regarding your waistline, but it's guilty pleasure food at its best so get it anyway. To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure how well a pool of spicy butter works with crispy fried chicken; some people will be like 'gross' and some will be like 'give it here right now' and for better or worse my gluttonous stomach falls into the latter camp.Crispy pork confit with braised turnips and smoked bacon marmalade: Literally fall off the bone good - easily a crowd favorite.Salted caramel ice cream: Terrific. We agreed that we should've gone with the sundae though - it sounds like a lot, but several scoops of just salted caramel ice cream by itself, no matter how good, gets a little monotonous pretty quickly.The main gripe I have with ABC is that somehow, it feels too impersonal.

3.0,5/8/2017,"I came here because Miranda Kerr named this as her favorite restaurant. LOL. I am not from New York, but when I was planning my trip to NYC, I specially put this restaurant on my itinerary, because I really wanted to see what the hype was all about. I ordered the crab toast with lemon aioli ($16), because everyone on Yelp raved about it. And, it did live up to expectations. Thanks fellow yelpers! However, at $16 it is very pricey, and portion size is only good for one. However, I enjoyed it so much, I ordered it again in the same sitting and finished off the second one as quickly as I had done the first. The roast carrot and avocado salad with crunchy seeds, sour cream and citrus ($17) was really bland. Most people, I am sure, are pretty capable of making much tastier salads at home. I mean, if I am going to spend $17 on a small salad, it should at least taste good. This was a huge disappointment. With every bite, I regretted ordering it. I wish had just ordered another crab toast instead. The salted caramel ice cream sundae with candied peanuts and popcorn, whipped cream, and hot fudge ($14) - (another raved about Yelp suggestion) was almost inedible. It was way too sweet, to the point of being gag-worthy. The only reason I forced myself to finish it was because I paid for it. I could not even eat the candied peanuts, because they were stuck to the bottom of the dish, like glue. 5 stars for the crab toast. If I lived in New York, I would probably return at least once a month just for the crab toast. However, the restaurant as a whole did not live up to expectations....the other dishes would be 1 stars.

We ended up ordering the crab toast, mushrooms, parmesan, oregano and egg pizza, black sea bass, and pasta. The crab toast was tasty and had a lot of flavor. The sea bass was cooked perfectly. The pasta was something different, but it was good. However, I was very disappointed in our mushroom pizza. It's like they forgot that they were baking the pizza in the oven because my slice was completely burnt on the bottom. I basically took one bite and tossed it out. For desserts, we shared the salted caramel popcorn sundae. The sundae was pretty big and yummy. It satisfied my sweet tooth. Overall, I think my experience at ABC Kitchen was mediocre.

4.0,4/24/2017,"I have to thank my friend for waiting over an hour for a table while we looked for parking on a Saturday afternoon when the police blocked pretty much every other corner of the streets in the area, finally we went in and the hosts were ready to sit us. The space is probably over 2,000 square feet, it's not one of those narrow-halled, squishy and dim rooms so popular in the city, despite the fact that there were many guests in and out and servers running around, the three of us (one pregnant) got to sit at a HUGE table in the back...thank you.Their staff is very kind, we got there kinda late, they close after the 3pm brunch crowd and we were accommodated until 4pm, our waitress had to leave when we were still chatting (that's what happens when you have 3 ladies at one table), she professionally introduced another waiter (his name is Levi and he's very cute and polite).I think the pictures of the interior speak for itself, BUT the chairs seem cheaper than they look, it's got an Anthropologie atmosphere, but very festive at the same time, our table looked like a tree cut in the middle, our plates consist of English tea sets and interesting shapes, a nice mixture of table wear.Let's get down to the food, I know it's probably an exaggeration, but they make the best house fries with herbs, they are so tiny but probably fried in miracles (olive oil maybe? or better) and sauteed to perfection. Very nice texture as well. Another appetizers were fried calamari, served in spicy and herbal mayo, crab meat overload on crispy toasts, they are not the most innovative, but it's the thoughts and details put into creating and perfecting these dishes. They are very flavorful.We had the hake, tender meats with crispy skin, ricotta ravioli, great texture and very creamy, also sea bass, very yummy, and a side of crispy but sweet french toast goodness to share. We wiped the table, and were so full with joy.

4.0,4/23/2017,"I'd had my eye on ABC Kitchen for a while, but it took a special occasion (and the patience to make reservations well in advance) to finally secure a seat in the dining room.I was highly skeptical of the roast carrot and avocado salad that everyone raves about. After all, at the end of the day, aren't they just carrots? Oh man, I was so wrong. I had no idea it was possible for carrots to be that delicious. Slightly charred and perfectly roasted, they balanced well with the avocado. The crunch that would normally be present in the root vegetable was instead offered by the pine nuts, sprinkled on a bed of arugula and sprouts. The appetizer was finished off with a dollop of sour cream and a couple of croutons.I'd return just for this salad alone, which is a little embarrassing to admit, but it's seriously that good.The ricotta ravioli, on the other hand, were stuffed with so much ricotta that it overwhelmed the entire dish. I found myself constantly searching for more tomato sauce to counteract the amount of cheese bursting out of each piece. It's a shame, because the ricotta itself was high quality; it wasn't overly dense, or worse, grainy. Its smooth, creamy texture earned the pasta some points, but sometimes too much of a good thing can be a detriment.For dessert, the warm apple pie with maple pecan ice cream was a wonderful way to end the meal. I initially expected a slice, and was surprised to see a miniature apple pie on the plate (about the size of a personal pot pie). The crust was flaky and glazed with brown sugar, and the maple pecan ice cream complemented the apple filling within the pastry.ABC Kitchen lives up to its reputation without question.

1.0,4/20/2017,"Could not have been more disappointed by a restaurant. I'm not sure if I was there on an off night, or if somehow I got remarkably unlucky, but every course we ordered was truly, embarrassingly terrible. To start, they brought out two small radishes on a plate (""compliments of the chef"".....SERIOUSLY, does ANYONE ever eat those? It's possibly the most unappetizing looking thing I've ever seen in a restaurant). Next came three pieces of bread. This is a faux pas far too many restaurants make. If there are two people at a table, you obviously need to serve an even number of bread slices. It's moronic to bring three pieces of bread to two people. Next was a meat and cheese plate. While two of the three cheeses were good, the third was notably low quality (not to mention bland for a blue cheese). The accoutrements (cheap honey, vinegar-soaked carrots, mustard you can buy in a Shop Rite) were awful and made no sense whatsoever as pairings to the cheeses. And the meats were inedibly salty. Just when I thought things couldn't get worse, the pea soup came. Ladies and gentlemen: the single most disgusting pea soup in New York City can be found at ABC Kitchen. Rancid. Heinous. Lime Green. To think about it a moment longer will actually make me vomit. Last were our two personal pizzas--mine was spinach and goat cheese, my date's asparagus with prosciutto. Both were greasy, burnt, and all around unimpressive. Put simply, we couldn't have more than one bite of any of our courses. I wish this could be the end of my criticism, but unfortunately I haven't even touched on the worst part: the service. Our server was inattentive from start to finish. We waited far too long between courses, had to repeatedly ask for our wine and water to be refilled, and, by the end, our server was too embarrassed to even approach our table, opting to send the manager over instead. While the manager did graciously offer to amend our bill and invited us to come back again, he must be completely delusional to think anyone would return to a restaurant after such an experience.

We each ordered our own brunch meals, and decided to split 2 orders of the cheddar biscuits. Our waitress said ""today we have strawberry jam, would that be ok?"" We said sure and our came the biscuits with some jam and butter. The food was great and the service was also good. Out comes the check and she charged us for the ""jam"". It ended up being $6.

5.0,4/20/2017,"I've been here multiple times and it just gets better and better after each visit. Each dinner just reaffirms my love for this restaurant. First things first, the ambience and décor is phenomenal. Perfect date night feel but also good for groups and for any occasion possible. The service is impeccable and just the right amount- not too little where you're looking for them but not too overbearing either. You can tell that management really focuses on training their staff and this is something that is always so important to me. Now onto the more important parts- the FOOD.The famous crab toast- AMAZING and a MUST. I'm not going to lie that it IS pricey for ONE piece of toast just cut up into 4 pieces but its just so darn good that I would order if every single time. That being said, they definitely don't skimp on the crab and it is really packed onto the top of that toast. Crab is also fresh, toast is toasted to perfection and the lemon aioli works so well with the crab.. This appetizer is a win.Roasted carrot avocado salad- another win. The textures of the salad work so harmoniously and the flavors just dance in your mouth. Great dressing that is not too overpowering as well.Mushroom pizza- as a LOVER of mushrooms, this dish just knocked it out of the park. The mushroom flavors just pop out at you.Homemade bowtie pasta with meal meatballs- For my main dish I obviously had to opt for one of their freshly made pasta dishes. Phenomenal as well. The pasta had amazing flavor and the veal meatballs were divine. Definitely try any of their pastas during your visit.Black sea bass- This was my boyfriends dish and he loved it as well. It comes with baby potatoes and spinach. Definitely on the blander side compared to the pasta but still has the simple flavors of chilies and herbs that work with the sea bass.And last but not least for dessert, we got the sundae with salted caramel ice cream and popcorn- one of the BEST desserts I've ever had. We are a sucker for salted caramel anything so we knew we had to order this. The ice cream tasted to freaking yummy and the popcorn and candied peanuts added the perfect crunch to the dessert. Oh its also topped with whipped cream and fudge so you can't really go wrong there....This place is a must go. You gotta be on top of your game for reservations though so good luck!",0,1,1,Hyesil C.,"New York, NY",355,135,206

I reported that to this super nice waiter who gave us the free dessert instead but still I was more disappointed with the fact that I was waiting 30minutes for burned food in the restaurant where I made a reservation a month before.

5.0,4/12/2017,"Me and a couple of close friends had a ""Girls Weekend"" in NYC and were excited to try ABC Kitchen for brunch! A trendy farm to table restaurant. It was an amazing experience from start to finish. Both the food and décor were phenomenal - ABC Kitchen easily became one of my favorite dining experiences here in New York. The restaurant is beautiful and the menu had a great variety (salads, pizzas, pastas, sandwiches, seafood). Everything we had was amazing - you can't go wrong with any of the choices on the menu. Highly recommend the crab toast for the appetizer, and the salted caramel ice cream for dessert! My friends and I shared - * Crab toast with Lemonaioli ($16) * Mushrooms, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza ($22)* Summer squash, feta, caraway, chilies and lemon pizza ($20)* Black sea bass withchilies and herbs,heirloom tomatoes and arugula ($34)* Scrambled eggs with fried oysters * Salted caramel ice cream sundaeEverything was fresh and beautifully presented. The meal was so amazing that I have almost no words to describe it. Make sure you save room for dessert! What's not to love about caramel ice cream topped with hot chocolate, peanuts, caramel popcorn and homemade whipped cream? My roommate even said it was one of the best desserts she's ever had. This is hands down one of the best restaurants in New York! It felt like a gourmet experience - a great place for a special lunch or dinner.

4.0,4/9/2017,"The pessimist in me has forever longed for a Chef JGV restaurant that will underwhelm a large section of the populace. I mean when you have a staggering 30+(10 in NYC alone; 11 once you count the newly opened ABCV) restaurants, there are bound to be some duds. And yet time and time again, this Alsatian chef has managed to put in front of us dishes that are far from gimmicky. My first visit to ABC kitchen was way back in 2012 - a year after it won the best new restaurant award. This was when Dan Kruger was still at the helm; a newcomer, then, with a stellar resume that featured Danny Meyer's Union Square Cafe, Floyd Cardoz's Tabla and Tom Colicchio's The Core Club. He left ABCK in 2014 to open Loring Place, admittedly my favorite new restaurant. On a chilly Thursday in December, I decided to make a return visit to see if the elements that left me utterly impressed in 2012 were still there. Short answer: YES. ABCK, located inside ABC carpet and kitchen, is pretty difficult to spot during evenings. My friend who reached there before me passed by it twice without even realizing. There is no glitzy, bright neon sign to indicate its presence. The place itself is divided into 3 parts. A bar in the front; which was filled to the brisk on a weekday evening with a noticeably upscale crowd. And then a very large dining room divided by a beautiful glass wall; one part of this area is for people without a reservation (but this is not set in stone). We were quickly seated ( I was elated by the fact that we got a place with a clear view of the kitchen) and handed the menus. A quick glance at the surroundings should be enough to convince you just how lovely the setting is. Our server gave us a quick rundown of the restaurant's vision of sustainability that was present in not just the food but also in the decor and cutlery. We started with farro, chickpea, and white bean soup which was remarkably well done and had the perfect amount of tanginess. Ingredients in this dish complimented each other well above my expectations. The complimentary bread that was served with olive oil and salt was delicious. Our waiter informed us it comes from Sullivan Street Bakery. For my mains, I ordered fried (tempura-like) organic chicken with collard greens on a base of hot sauce butter was perfectly cooked. It was soft, tender, juicy, and well worth the high amount of calories that I ended up consuming. Kasha and bowtie pasta with veal meatballs was cooked al dente. The concoction of flavors your tongue will experience is nothing short of a culinary spectacle. For my deserts, I went with the crowd favorite. Salted caramel ice cream sundae with candied peanuts and popcorn, whipped cream, and hot fudge. I may be in the minority here but I really didn't think it was anything special. I felt the popcorn bits were more of a nuisance to the otherwise fine desert. We also tried creme brûlée which I actually preferred over the sundae. That said, it was warm unlike a lot of places where it is served cold (which, in my opinion, also adds a distinct richness to the taste). A septuagenarian couple decided it was too dark to even read the menu properly so they switched on cell phone flashlight. Another couple on the neighboring table decided to follow suit. I wouldn't blame them at all. In some sections, the place is painfully dark. Your loved one's pretty face illuminated by the only candle on the table is pretty romantic, I agree. Later on, however, I decided to change my opinion when it severely restricted my ability to deconstruct the dishes. That said parts of my meal were well illuminated by the flashes from the cameras of the people trying to take pictures of the food/decor. :PIn conclusion, things may have changed at ABCK over the years but the dishes coming out of that kitchen are as delectable as ever.",0,0,0,Brown B.,"NY, NY",0,2,13

1.0,4/3/2017,"ABC Kitchen came highly recommended by a friend.  Made a reservation for noon on a Saturday. We entered the restaurant through the back near the ABC carpet store.  Walking through the restaurant to the hostess stand--it was empty--tons of empty tables.  We checked in with the hostess right before noon who said we'd get seated ""in a few minutes""  We ended up waiting about 20 minutes before we were seated--with no explanation and no acknowledgement of the fact that we had a reservation.  And there were empty tables everywhere!Once seated it took over 15 minutes for a waiter to even come to our table and bring us a menu and water. We saw the waiter 3 times in total--the first time he came to our table to drop off a menu, the time he took our order and then when we flagged him down for the check. With a noon reservation, we finally received water at 12:50. We joked about just leaving at that point.  Food arrived and was nothing special (turkey sandwich & Angel Hair w/ ricotta).

4.0,4/1/2017,"Beautiful space. Magical ambience, lovely staff. Come early and look through the amazing store. Loved the flavors of the food. We started with some really delicious cocktails, a smoky, dry mezcal grapefruit lavender stunner in a highball glass had great mouth appeal, and the ginger margarita was not overly sweet and remained alluring at every sip. Very flavorful rustic whole wheatbread with a complex dipping olive oil, went well with the tasty mixed marinated olives. Kale salad with mint and Serrano, and the shaved fluke with horseradish came out first on smaller salad plates-- my first reaction to the visual presentation was a big Uh-oh. Both plates looked like scrap heaps, one white, one green. However, while the dishes were visually bland, (the fluke was visually unappealing) they proved quite delicious when forked up. The spring pea soup (also with mint) was vibrant and delish with some snappy whole peas in it, and the spinach goat cheese pizza was yummy even on a full stomach because the cheese was magnificent. We also tasted the homemade pasta with mushroom bolognase, which didn't shine at the same level as the other dishes and was overly oiled. The fava greens were simple and tasty. We finished the meal with an excellent double espresso, and had the almond cake with apple sorbet and poached pear. The cake was yummy, but there wasn't enough apple sorbet to ping pong the flavors around as you ate your way thru the cake..there was less than a tablespoon of the gorgeous stuff, on a small pile of candied almonds. I think they may have run out of sorbet as they were plating our dessert and pushed it out of the kitchen hoping we wouldn't notice. ; )  it was too good not to notice!

4.0,3/29/2017,"ABC is one of my all-time, classic favorite NYC restaurants. I've been going a few times per year for every meal since they opened years ago.One of the best parts about ABC, and one of the most important for me, is their transparency around the ingredients they use and how they go the extra mile to be as organic, local, and sustainable as possible. For ABC, these are not sly marketing buzz words you simply throw around like so many other restaurants tend to do these days-- it's their gospel.The beautiful porcelain plates and flatware are just a couple of the many special details that make ABC stand out. Every detail counts, and not in an old-school white-glove service way. The ambiance is really unique. Not basic, not cookie-cutter. The diners are low-key and appreciate quality cuisine. This is not an obnoxious crowd. There is no pretension or attitude here like you may find at a sceney place in Meatpacking or Rose Bar.As for last night (an off-night for ABC):We spent a very nice amount (celebrating our two-year anniversary) and noticed our server charged us for a beer we never even ordered. It makes them seem unprofessional and like they're trying to get free money (because I'm sure not everyone checks the entire bill, so is this a strategy to receive more $ and a higher tip?) anyway, we were not pleased with that since the beer wasn't even close to what we ordered (the only drink we ordered was an amazing bottle of wine... logically, why would we have even ordered a beer)? It was of course taken off the menu, however it was odd for a restaurant of this caliber to not check the bill before handing it to us. We also noticed when we got home that there were two other small charges that should not have been tacked onto the bill. Three small charges add up and that impacts the total and the tip we left, so yeah it's very unprofessional to sneak those in there.Also, our first of many dishes we ordered, the chicken liver toast, came literally over twenty minutes after we placed the order. It was a Tuesday night at 8pm and there were ten open tables around us. Chicken liver toast is one of those dishes where it's all prep and no cooking, so why the crazy wait? The biggest let-down was finally receiving bread just before the chicken liver toast was supposed to come out. When I'm about to share 5-6 plates, I can't fill up on bread, so we sent it back and asked our runner to please fire the chicken liver toast.If it's your first time coming, get anything but the pizza. As a native New Yorker who dines out frequently, I know better than to order pizza from ABC. It's nothing special. If pizza is what you want, go to Ops, Paulie Gee's, Emily, Emmy or Lucali. Definitely get anything seafood-forward, veggie-forward, and any of the starters at ABC. Those are their strengths. Oh and the pastas are pretty good.The sommelier did a phenomenal job at selecting the perfect wine for us, especially since my boyfriend and I have particular preferences that don't always align. It seemed like our runner(s) knew more about the status of our courses than our server. We also probably had about 4 or 5 different people come by our table throughout the evening (yet none of them asked how we were doing or if we needed anything!)The best dishes were the chicken liver toast, the lobster, and the handmade ricotta ravioli. Also I don't have a sweet tooth, but the chocolate cake slice was out of this world. That's the only cake I ever want at any of my birthdays moving forward.They also brought out two mini cupcakes (symbolic of two years) with candles on a beautiful porcelain plate and that said in chocolate cursive ""Happy Anniversary, Love..."" that was a very sweet touch. I love those small details.We will obviously still return, and I can't wait to try ABCv too, however I think our waitress was new and still learning the ropes. She probably just needs better training and to know when to fire the first dish so we're not sitting for 25 minutes sadly watching everyone else get a toast or starter but us.",0,0,0,Nicole K.,"Portland, OR",178,56,5

No reservation, no problem. Promptly seated and waited on. It was tough to decide whether to go more breakfast-style or lunch, since any dish you see pass by would sway you one way or the other. But, I'm generally more of a savory eater - so lunch it was. We pretty much shared everything, and we got:Apps:Pretzel crusted calamari - a really interesting twisted on your standard fried calamari dish; crispy and served with a delicious mustard sauce.Roasted kabocha squash toast with fresh ricotta and apple cider vinegar - yum!  I was a little skeptical - I like squash and all, but on toast? Yes. A tad little bit on the sweet side, but still really good.Crab toast - Bam. Yuuuge chunks of crab, served with slaw and a lemon aoli. These flew off the plate.SideRoasted Brussels Sprouts, Prosciutto, Apples and Herbs - I love me some brussels. This was no exception.MainsMushrooms, Parmesan, Oregano and Farm Egg Pizza - First off, I love that the pizzas are whole wheat. Decadence with a side of health(er).  Fantastic. A little bit of a tough time to cut, but just great. The runny egg kicked this guy off to the next level.Spinach, Goat Cheese and Herbs Pizza - Disclaimer that I'm pretty obsessed with goat cheese, so this was just the overall winner in my book.

She checked on us often enough and gave good recommendations.- Atmosphere: casual chic. It's a big, loud restaurant with tables close together.- Drinks: we each had a cocktail and a glass of wine. I had a grapefruit mezcal cocktail and my mom had a ginger margarita (both $16). The ginger margarita was the better of the two but I enjoyed both. We both got a glass of Chardonnay after which was good but pricey ($18). The wine list in general was pretty pricey by the glass. -Food: we had the beet and yogurt salad to start along with the crab toast. We both then had the roast hake. The crab toast was my favorite of all - it had big chunks of crab and had a nice spice. The beet salad was good as well but small. I enjoyed the hake as well but it was a little too spicy (it didn't appear spicy on the menu).-Price: about what you would expect in Manhattan.

4.0,3/22/2017,"I had high expectations when I came here since it feels like it takes forever to get a reservation here. It was hard to find - or perhaps it's because I need a new prescription for my lens. But I digress -- once found, it's hard to miss. When you walk in, the seating area is beautiful. The lighting makes the ambiance more casual and romantic. I'd imagine they would light up candles at night which would make the restaurant more on the romantic side. My friend and I were seated promptly after I told the ladies that I had a reservation for 2 at 1PM. A funny side note - the chairs are NOT coat friendly. When I walked to my seat, I saw a few jackets fall onto the floor. They had a wide variety for menu options but my friend and I went with the prefix. I had the beets with yogurt, ricotta and farm egg raviolo with the salted caramel sundae. My friend had the soup, roasted hake and the almond cake. Before our meal, they had given us 3 slices of artisanal bread (I hope I'm not wrong?) with a dish of olive oil. The olive oil taste was very present so it enhanced how I felt about the bread. Then came our appetizers - my friend's soup was good but I only had one spoonful so I cannot comment well. My beets were sweet and juicy(I'm not sure if I have the right word here...) that paired well with the tartness of the yogurt. Next came our entrees and from the bite of hake I had, it had no hints of fishiness and it tasted good. My entree of raviolo had a LOT of cheese on top. When I took a look at the other photos, they had less parmesan on top. My raviolo had enough parmesan to cover the plate! When I bit into it with the pork ragu, it was delicious. My favorite was my dessert of salted caramel ice cream sundae. It was very reminiscent of cracker jack's popcorn. Normally, I'm not a fan of popcorn but when it's made like this, it's heavenly. The salted caramel ice cream with fudge wasn't overly sweet. The peanuts ----- ahh, I miss this dessert already!I cannot wait to come back to try their pizza though. And their veal meatballs!

3.0,3/21/2017,"Had a terrific Sunday Brunch reserved at Noon. Place was just starting to fill and yet enough room for priivacy. The lighting and ambiance was very comfortable. Our party of 4 started out sharing  appetizer crab toast with lemon aioli and Line Caught Tuna Sashimi and a bottle of their Cava sparkling water.  We found the toast itself was very hard but the crab was delicious with little to no binding filler. So be careful not to bite too hard or you just may lose a tooth.  The tuna Sashimi was very fresh with nice consistancy of oil and tender (melts in your mouth).    As for Entree I had their Eggs Benedict with ham on a toasted muffin.  The  2 Eggs were perfectly cooked and I enjoyed how the yoke on both eggs just oooozzzed over the ham and muffin. Just perfectly cooked along with their potatos. We also had black bass over a bed of spinach which was cooked just right.  The other fish we had was their Roasted Hake. The waitress described it similar to a Halibut. Unfortunately, the Roasted Hake fish was almost the size of a deck of card and it was served with a (1) peeled brussel sprout. So this Hake fish portion was maybe enough for a 5 year old child. Our other party had their delicious sauteed Skuna Bay Salmon with roasted carrots and basil. He really enjoyed it but the portion was lacking as well. By this time we had just finished our round of drinks (2 Manhattan and 2 Grey Goose Martini).For desert we had their delicious rasberry sorbet (3 scoops). It wasn't overly sweet and the size was perfect. Also had they creme brulee and that was WOW with coffee.As for the service I would say she was okay. Nice but not rude. We got the feeling she had other things on her mind other than working that day.In all our meal with gratuity was shy of $400.  I would've given 4 stars if the portion was more ADULT SIZE vs Children SIZE and if we had a friendlier waitress.",3,0,1,Stan S.,"New York, NY",0,32,0

5.0,3/18/2017,"Great brunch. With awesome selection of appetizers, breakfast and lunch entrees. It was so hard to choose so we ordered a bit of everything! For appetizers we did Squash toast which was like fall on a plate. my favorite was the crab toast, so fresh. the pretzel calamari with spicy marinara and a mustard sauce. The cured meat and cheeses, which came with thick brown mustard and honey omg! What an amazing combination!, the tuna sashimi was some of the best and freshest tuna I've had in a while. We all shared the pizza with mushrooms and farm egg, and the dough was so chewy and delicious. The egg on top was really perfection. I had the eggs Benedict with a delicious ham, it was the quintessential delicious eggs bene! What did everyone else have? The burger, turkey sandwich, lobster, bow ties with veal meat balls. Everyone raved about their dishes! We also orders the cheddar biscuits for a side dish, major deliciousness! For dessert I had the almond creme brûlée and tried some of the cookie plate, with a cappuccino. The creme brûlée was one of the best I've had in a very long time, same with the cappuccino! For drinks I started with a healthy Green juice,  and switched to a "" healthy"" ginger margarita, both were refreshing and amazing.

3.0,3/15/2017,"Would give it five for the amazing atmosphere alone. My issue may have been specific to my situation, but the dishes I had (while good and interesting) felt like missed opportunities to give me something amazing-which makes me cranky in retrospect. Three stars because the mushroom bolognese came out looking like a portioned bag of dry microwaved pasta (with a GREAT sauce poured on top.) The hot sauce butter served with both the mushroom app and my entree of fried chicken was DELICIOUS... but why not serve the mushrooms along with the chicken instead of having both? Or put that fried chicken with a little more starch? The apple pie came out barely warm. Mainly, everything was good, but for the price I feel like more care could have been given to each dish- more so the process of cooking than the actual menu. It felt next level, but even I felt like I could have brought my food in the back and made it even better (and I don't claim to be a chef) I will say the cranberry compote with homemade ricotta was cool!",1,0,0,Onion N.,"Savannah, GA",52,10,9

5.0,2/28/2017,"ABC Kitchen is my top ""Sophisticated Adult"" restaurant to go to in New York. You know what I'm talking about. There are some places that are comforting in their casual, no-frills appeal (the Thai place around the block with the best summer rolls, the reliable $1 pizza joint). There are other places that you go with your friends to get silly (the dive bar near your office, the brunch bistro that caters specifically to the mimosa-and-eggs-Benny crowd). And then there are those places like ABC Kitchen where you savor every drop that crosses your plate and you do so in your best stretchy work pants. First, it's absolutely beautiful inside. ABC Kitchen and Gramercy Tavern both have some of the best interiors that I've seen (though, granted, I have not seen much). Second, the food is ""bring your parents here, bring your boss here, bring your in-laws here, bring your client here"" good. Here are the stand-outs:Crab toast. I've broken my no-bread rules for this. Squash toast with ricotta. Not as much of a head-burst as the crab toast but the kabocha squash and ricotta really pair well together. Mushroom, Parmesan, and farm egg pizza. SAY WHAT. Seared salmon. I have yet to try any of the pastas and the roast carrot and avocado salad was kind of basic for $17 but everything else was worth ruminating over several days later. And yes, my list skews more to the carbs side of the food pyramid but as I like to remind myself, you only live once. Chef Jean-Georges, please adopt me! No, seriously.",3,2,5,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1203,824,173

4.0,2/25/2017,"Came here for dinner on a Thursday night and I was impressed! Beautiful, intimate space with very nice decor. Decor which you could also buy right around the corner at abc carpet & home! We sat at the intersection next to abc cocina and carpet & home and it was a little amusing seeing customers at the furniture shop glancing into the restaurant. Great service and while the decor was classy, everyone was casual and friendly. Now on to the food:Crab toast with lemon aioli - This is a MUST order. Crab was chilled, sweet, and so fresh on top of a thick slice of soft bread. Very meaty and the lemon aioli worked perfectly. Great start to the meal. Pretzel dusted calamari, spicy tomato and mustard aioli - Crunchy crust and tender calamari! Not sure I could tell that it was pretzel dust, but it was a great crust. The spicy tomato sauce was not that spicy (great for me!) and I loved it! The mustard aioli has quite a kick so be prepared. Mushrooms, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza - Wasn't planning to order pizza at first but then saw other Yelper's photos and that changed our minds real quick. Whole pieces of different mushrooms perfectly cooked on top of the pizza. The egg was a bit overcooked so it wasn't runny as I would have liked, but maybe we should have ate the egg sooner! The crust was thin and had a great crunch, but a little burnt around the edges. Note - be careful, there was pepper flakes pre-sprinkled on top and I unfortunately had a bite of flakes. Wood oven roasted Maine lobster, oregano and lemon-chili vinaigrette - The star of the meal! Beautifully cooked lobster that they brought out split on two separate plates for us. The lemon-chili vinaigrette added great flavor to the lobster. The claw meat was take out already and the outside had a bite to it from the oven. We wished there was more tail meat, but overall great lobster! Mashed potatoes with sea salt - Buttery, whipped mashed potatoes that was a shining side to the lobster!

2.0,2/25/2017,"Heard a lot of raves about this place and it is always packed!  Went yesterday for lunch and did the a la carte menu.  For $150 with tip I believe you can eat better elsewhere. However, I may have felt differently if I had chosen the $34 prix fix. It is not top of the line and I won't be going back.#1 the crab toast (that everyone raves about) is very so-so.  It seemed to be made up hours before the lunch rush so the bread was a little soggy.  The crab itself tasted like it had been freshly washed from a can.  SKIP IT.#2 the roasted carrot and avocado salad also had been plated earlier and warm temperature (including the carrots) but was unusual and interesting and I would order it again.  The avocado though was so ripe it was liquid in the mouth.  Did not like that at all.#3 Both the entrees the hake and the black cod were nicely prepared.  The crispy cod was resting on a bed of wilted spinach flavored with basil and was very tasty.  We enjoyed the fish but the portions aren't huge and really ordering apps is mandatory to fill up.#4 cookie plate.  5 large cooked arrived and they were all interesting and we enjoyed them.The service was excellent.  It is a huge restaurant but once again the toilets are one for the men and one for the women and one that is for both.  By one I mean one room with one toilet.  So ,expect to spend a goodly amount of time in line for the bathroom.  I found this offensive at these prices.",1,0,0,Lisa Y.,"New York, NY",34,77,2

5.0,2/9/2017,"5 stars just doesn't do ABC Kitchen justice!Having wanted to dine at ABC Kitchen since they won the JBF Award for Best New Restaurant in 2011, I finally had a chance to visit when I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and did we ever enjoy the experience here.The outside of the restaurant was pretty unassuming, except for the small ABC Kitchen sign right above the entrance that was quite difficult to actually see in the evening. Nevertheless, we found it. Our dinner reservation was for Saturday, 6pm --- a bit earlier for dinner than desired because they were booked to the brim that evening. I made my reservation about 1 month in advance, so that goes to show you BOOK EARLY if you want to dine here!When we walked in, we walked thru the spacious bar and feasted our eyes on a really magnificently decorated, dimly-lit and huge dining area. The tables went back as far as my eyes could see. This was one of the largest dining ""rooms"" I had ever seen in an NYC restaurant! With the lack of space in NYC, I never thought I would see a dining area so long!The restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived at around 5:50, but by the time we finished at 7:30, it was almost at capacity. Surprising in that they could get such a large restaurant completely filled, not surprising in that it's ABC Kitchen and one of Jean-Georges' gems.I've written a book and still haven't gotten to the food, so here goes. One word, AMAZING. There was not one dish that we disliked and each dish had it's own uniqueness. There was something that stood out with everything we tried. We wanted to try everything, but went with what we knew was most popular:CRAB TOAST WITH LEMON AIOLISomething we saw a lot of on Yelp and it was much better than we even anticipated. First, the toast holding the crab was very large so it was easily shared between 2 people. The crab was cold, extremely fresh and melted in our mouths. It was some of the best fresh crab meat I had ever tasted. A must start with appetizer as we saw multiple tables order this.KASHA AND BOWTIE PASTA, VEAL MEATBALLSThe restaurant allowed for 2 options, an appetizer size or entree size. Since we wanted to try more dishes, we went with the appetizer portion. OK we were starving too, but trying a little bit of everything doesn't hurt either. The dish arrived in 2 small bowls, 1 for me and 1 for my girlfriend. The pasta was cooked al dente, maybe a bit under? I'm used to pasta being very soft, but the pasta had verrrrrry slight hardness to it, but it worked to perfection. The sauce wasn't overwhelming, but gave the pasta a great flavor. The little veal meatballs were scattered all around and complimented the pasta perfectly.PIZZA - MUSHROOMS, PARMESAN,OREGANO AND FARM EGGAlthough I saw this repeatedly online, our waitress and a busboy informed us that this was their favorite pizza here, so that's all the convincing we needed. Regardless of their opinions we were going to order this pizza and it met every piece of hype I read and heard. There was a ton of mushroom scattered on the outside of the pizza next to the crust, while the egg was floating around in the middle. Everything about this pizza was tasty. The mushroom had a toasty flavor to it, the egg mixed in well and the cheese was ... well very cheesy. An absolutely flavorful pizza for the ages.BLACK SEA BASS WITH CHILIES AND HERBS, BABY MARKET POTATOES AND SPINACHSince we were 2 people, the kitchen split our entree into 2 bowls. As to why restaurant don't do this more often, I don't know, but ABC Kitchen got it right. By the time we reached this dish, we were pretty close to stuffed, but after 1 bite of the fish, we easily made a bit more room (subconsciously). The skin was very crispy and it definitely made the sea bass that much more interesting. It sat on a little bed of spinach with a few slices of potato to the side. It was simple, elegant, light and, best of all, really good.SUNDAE WITH SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM, CANDIED PEANUTS & POPCORN,WHIPPED CREAM, HOT FUDGEYou can't have a meal at a James Beard award winner without dessert so we forged ahead despite our bloated stomachs. We went with the popular salted caramel ice cream sundae. To sum it up, it was a huge order of 3 scoops of excellent salted caramel ice cream. Texture and taste were right on point. And if you love caramel, there was some caramel popcorn (tasted like cracker jacks) spread out over it as well.Everything about ABC Kitchen was perfect. The service was fantastic. Since it was girlfriend's birthday, I walked up to a random busboy (during a ""bathroom break"") and told him if we could get a candle and small Happy Birthday dessert for my girlfriend and they came thru when our salted caramel dessert arrived. The atmosphere was laid back, yet romantic with the dim lighting. The dress code was casual amongst not only the customers, but the waiters as well.

4.0,1/22/2017,"I decided to finally check this restaurant out, I've always seen the entrance to it when shopping at the ABC store.  I did not have a reservation  so I was directed to the bar while I waited for a table.  I was dining alone so I didn't mind the short wait.  The ambiance is very inviting and charming. Every price of furniture looked like it was taken from the ABC store which I absolutely loved.  Ordered the lemonade cocktail...it wasn't too sweet but had a bit of an odd taste.  Maybe it was a liquor I wasn't use to tasting, but after a few sips I didn't mind it.       The wait for a table was short, maybe 15 minutes.  I wasn't thrilled with where they sat me...right near a register where all the waiters place orders but hey, I hear this place gets super crowded (which it was) so I couldn't complain too much. I ordered the eggs and crispy potatoes, the crab with Aioli.  Loved the crab dish....the eggs were ok but the potatoes were not crunchy...more like 1 minute away from being burned.  That was disappointing. I almost forgot to mention that I ordered the doughnuts which were ok.  Healthy version of doughnuts are always a bit saddening.  Waiters were nice and attentive. Maybe I'll come back and order dinner.",0,0,0,Ana S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,28,0
5.0,1/22/2017,"Hands-down the best dining experience I've had in a very long time. Our server, Emily, set the tone for the whole meal-- genuine, comfortable and an absolute delight. I come up the the city a fair amount and so often at nice places you are smothered with pretension. Both Emily and Scotty who guided us through the meal absolutely made the experience. Starter: Crab Toast. A little heavy (so definitely split), but SO tasty. Entrees: Fried Chicken: most interesting tangy/spicy sauce accompanying the chicken. Delicious!! Crispy Pork Belly: incredible. The mashed potatoes that accompanied the meal on the plate added such a delectable comfort. Dessert: SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT. Salted. Caramel. Sundae. I'm not a huge ice cream person but OH my. This was likely the best dessert I've ever had. From the caramel popcorn topping the ice cream, to the creamy ice cream itself, to the fudge and nuts that sit on the bottom of the bowl...just go for it.Oh! And I almost forgot-- I love a good ambiance. The details of each plate, the tiny flowers on the table, the lighting...all was subtly romantic and welcoming. I loved it all.

After we got seated, I noticed there were a few empty tables that never got filled during my stay, so my guess is that those are for the walk ins. The atmosphere here is undeniably intimate and the service is great. They have a lot of tables in the restaurant with some big round tables in the corner. Our table is in close proximity to our neighboring table (less than 5 feet away)For appetizer, we ordered the crab toast. It was really good! I think the white sauce covered the crabmeat taste a little bit. This dish is definitely refreshing but the taste of it mainly come from the natural taste of the crab rather than a well thought creation from the chef. For main meal, my boyfriend ordered the sea bass and I ordered the bow tie pasta with veal meatballs. They are both delicious. I am just a little disappointed because they tasted ordinary.

1.0,12/28/2016,"This review is not about the food at all, but a story about employee behavior, which I think the establishment should know about. Around 2 in the afternoon yesterday, my husband and I were strolling around the neighborhood, looking up restaurants through Yelp. This one showed up, so gave it a try. When we walked in and asked for a table for 2 but didn't have reservations, the 3 girls that were in charge got all a flutter and said we might need to wait up to 1 1/2 hour at the bar for them to possibly fit us in. They recommended that we go to a sister restaurant in ABC (and called them) to tell us that the wait there was 28 minutes. So we decided to forgo either restaurant, but decided to walk through the restaurant to go into the ABC store. When we walked through, more than half the (huge) restaurant was unoccupied! Needless to say we were totally bewildered about that interaction and behavior of those fluttery girls. We felt discriminated against, but that could hardly be the case, because we are somewhat generic New Yorkers (if that can be generic!). So what's up ABC Kitchen????? Since we were on the go, and a bit put off, we moved on. However, if I had read deeper into the great reviews about the food on Yelp, I would have walked all the way back through the restaurant and been a bit more insistent to have our lunch there.

Free of pesticides, fertilizers, insecticides, and GMOs? Yes, yes, yes!

5.0,12/22/2016,"With hundreds of restaurants in NYC and the hype surrounding them there's only a few that live up to that expectation and ABC Kitchen is certainly one of them. I've dined here twice now: once a few years ago, and the second time just this past weekend. I've only been here for brunch and both times I had to make the reservation well in advance. And by well in advance I mean several weeks.From the chic decor, to the dimly lit dining room with hanging chandeliers, the restaurant is every bit rustic, warm, and inviting. The restaurant was of course extra done up for the holidays with garland and lights strung everywhere. As we were waiting for our food, ""Santa Clause"" happened to make his way through the restaurant in full costume ringing his bell. He was headed towards ABC home (which is connected to the restaurant) for all the little kids waiting to meet him. It was such a cute little surprise for all the Sunday morning brunchers.Now let's get down to the meat of this review (if you've made it this far that is). ABC Kitchen is known for their use of fresh organic ingredients, sourced locally, and non gmo products. Everything is made in house and tastes fresh, clean, and just delicious. I started off with with their beet juice, which is a must to try if you're into the juicing trend at all!For savory we were debating whether to order the Eggs Benedict or their infamous mushroom and egg pizza. We decided to go for the breakfast pizza to try something new and I have to say we didn't regret it. The mix of truffle oil and crushed red pepper added such a great taste to the pizza.For sweet we ordered the French toast with caramelized apple and the popcorn sundae. What I loved about the French toast was that it wasn't too eggy and underdone on the inside. Topped with the fresh maple syrup it was just too good to be true. And let's not forget the popcorn sundae: the perfect combination of sweet and salty.From the last time I dined here, to my experience this time around, it was just as good if not better than what I remember.I'll definitely be back to check out more of their menu :)",1,0,0,Sanaa H.,"Manhattan, NY",298,51,79

From the moment we sat down, our delightful server Clare took wonderful care of us, guiding us through the menu, telling us about both the specials and her favorites, made sure our cocktails were in good supply, and arranged for a little surprise birthday dessert for the guest of honor. The server can often make or break a dining experience, but Clare was delightful, so be sure to ask to be seated in her section when you make your reservation.The kitchen was, to no one's surprise, firing on all cylinders, turning out a series of nicely prepared dishes that really featured the fresh ingredients in a lovely, creative way. From the crab toast with lemon aioli (don't think about it, just get it) to one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had to the perfect flaky crust of the apple pie and the decadent yet not overly sweet chocolate cake, everything was just right.

I was so surprised because it was always impossible for me to find an open table at a decent hour!We came for brunch. First off, the decor. Wow. It could have been in any home magazine. Rustic yet cozy and elegant. We had a mini photo shoot before we could even look at the menu. When we finally decided, we ordered the roasted carrot salad, I had the crab toast and then we shared a salted caramel popcorn with ice cream. The roasted carrot salad was actually my favorite dish even though I really don't like carrots. I usually never order anything with carrots especially if it's the main component of the dish. But this was so good with avocado and the charred flavor on the carrots and the sauce and the crunch from the pine nuts I think. Just very well balanced in texture and taste and perfect as an appetizer. The crab toast had been written about a lot but I didn't find it spectacular. The toast was too toasted and hurt to bite into. The crab was very fresh however and had the sweet taste of fresh seafood. It was perfect with some lemon squeezed on top. The dessert was way too sweet for me. The salty and sweet were both so strong they were fighting each other. However, I did like the popcorn which added a good crunch factor.

The ambiance is nice and relaxing, not too stuffy like some Jean-George's restaurants. Service was somewhat slow, but good overall. We started with the pretzel dusted calamari, bay scallops special, crab toast and the roast carrot and avocado salad. We loved all the apps, but the bay scallops and roast carrot and avocado salad were standouts. For our entrees, we ordered the black bass, the hake, the crispy pork confit and the kasha and bowtie pasta with veal meatballs. All the entrees were great, with the exception of the kasha and bowtie pasta with veal meatballs. There was some flavor that overwhelmed the dish (it was sagey and piney) and simply threw off he balance. The crispy pork confit is a must!!For dessert, we had the warm apple pie, seasonal doughnuts and almond creme brûlée. The warm apple pie and creme brûlée were phenomenal. They both were comforting and balanced - just the right amount of sweet. The seasonal doughnuts were decent, but didn't necessarily excite any of us (and I love doughnuts, but perhaps these were just a little too ""elevated""?). They also brought the chocolate cake pops on the house and those were very tasty! Overall a great experience.

Not sure what exactly hoe it was pretzel dusted, but I will assure you that it was delicious!Spinach and goat cheese pizza was extremely yummy!!!

4.0,11/29/2016,Love the decor and atmosphere!!!! Came here for early Saturday brunch. The service was great. Not so noisy. Just in general a great place for friends or date.The food was good but not as good as I originally expected (maybe I've heard too much good things and set my expectation unreasonably high).Small dishesCrab toast was special. Nice flavors and easy to eat.Roasted Brussel sprouts was good. But how can roasted Brussel sprouts not be good.Bowtie Pasta was flavorful and cute. But I wouldn't say this is a pasta place either.Mushroom pizza was interesting. There is a raw egg on top... so kind of messy to eat.Dessert:Caramel ice cream sundae was my favorite part of the meal. Really really sweet but still in a good way.Cream brûlée is a bit too thick for my taste. Kind of like eating butter.,2,0,1,Sherry Z.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",241,126,368

Candles and twinkly lights, the staff was delightful and very attentive.  We enjoyed everything we had, it was last month so I am sorry I can't remember each item, but we had vegetarian and meat eaters alike and everyone was happy.

Crab toast lemon aioli is tantalizing - it still makes my mouth water when I think of it. The fried organic chicken was tender and moist - lightly battered. Really complemented by the hot sauce. The kasha bow tie pasta with veal meatballs was good but needed a little more sauce - seemed to be a bit dry. The meatballs were amazing though. The mushrooms, Parmesan, oregano and farm pizza was interesting. It lacked a bit of flavor. With a $22 price tag - your expectation is obviously higher. After completely filling up our bellies with the above, we still ordered the sundae with salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts & popcorn to conclude the bf's birthday celebration.

I highly recommend the mushroom pizza with egg on top. It's awesome. Its small and you could eat it all on your own or you can be nice and share with your company.

4.0,11/14/2016,"Spontaneously decided to try out this place for brunch on a Saturday after hearing great things and got there around 1pm with a friend and with no reservations. The hostess told us it would be a 1 - 1.5 hour wait and there was open seating at the bar. We put our names down and thought we would try our luck at the bar. Other patrons were surprisingly aggressive about grabbing seats at the bar as soon as people finished their meals. After about 30 min, we managed to snag two seats and the hostess told us we could order our coffees at the bar and she would move us to the table when our name came up. We were finally seated around 2pm (so her estimate of 1 hour was accurate). Our server was super friendly when he seated us and took our order. He introduced himself, explained the dishes in detail, even telling us his personal opinions on the diffrent dishes and and even gave us some more info about their neighboring ABC Cocina. However from then until the check came he inexplicably disappeared and another waiter brought us our food. We had to flag servers down multiple times for water and no-one really checked on us during the meal. We ordered the mushroom, ricotta and farm fresh egg pizza which was phenomenal! Highly recommend. We also tried the cheddar biscuits which were fantastic!!! Definitely get these. Unfortunately we were disappointed with the scrambled eggs and fried oysters dish - the portion was small for the price and while the scrambled eggs were good the oysters tasted a bit off. Other highlights are that after our long wait, we were seated in these plush armchairs with a low glass-topped table to eat at and the decoration inside was gorgeous. I'm glad I finally got to try this place and believe they have a vegan restaurant opening soon next door - ABC V which I hope to try out.

5.0,11/10/2016,"Everything about this place was great! My fiance and I came here for a date night, but there were plenty of large tables capable of accommodating larger groups. The space was nice and open with really cute rustic decor. Service was amazing, with incredibly friendly and attentive staff that checked in often but not too often. I ordered the apple gold rush cocktail and it was fresh and tasty but still surprisingly strong!Every dish we got was superb!! We started with the crab toast, which I had seen many people raving about. It definitely lived up to its hype, with a good amount of fresh crab that was incredibly flavorful (just a dab of mayo, but not overwhelming) on a slice of toast that was just crunchy enough to support it without being soggy, but also still soft and chewy. Probably my favorite part of the meal! For entrées we got the hake with toasted brussel sprout leaves on butternut squash puree with chili oil and the crispy pork confit with smoked bacon marmalade and braised turnips on mashed potatoes. The hake was soft and flaky with a nice crispy seared crust. The sweetness of the squash puree was well balanced by the chili oil and the slight saltiness of the fish. I was afraid the dish looked a little small initially but we both walked out very comfortably full. The pork has a crispy skin with meat that was tender and not at all dry. The bacon marmalade was a great sweet-salty combo and the turnips were tasty and cute (I'd never had them with the bulb and stems together before!). We finished with the honey fig panna cotta which came with a scoop of tart lemon sorbet and a little well of lemony honey in the center of the panna cotta. Creamy, light, and tart - the perfect finish!All in all, if you're looking for a real treat for your taste buds, and don't mind spending a little more to get there, I'd definitely recommend this place!

1.0,10/30/2016,"The ABC Kitchen reservation people tell you robotically that they have a ""31-day wait"" as though this is something of which to be proud. That should be the tip-off: your experience will be impersonal, a business transaction and, as with a casino, the house will always win. In fact, we got a reservation a week in advance -- we were told we'd have to be placed at a high-top cocktail table to accommodate the addition of a third person to our party -- but in actuality when we arrived, we were seated at a table for four in a restaurant that was no more than 25 percent full. They're trying to simulate white-hot demand well after it has diminished. Our server was hard-edged, curt, in no way welcoming or helpful. She and her colleagues' repeated response to our requests was: ""Not a problem."" This phrase, a Millennial idiom, was dropped on us six or seven times during our dinner. One wanted to ask: ""And if it is a problem to bring us more bread, wouldn't  it be best for you to leave the hospitality industry -- and close this poor excuse for a restaurant while you're at it?"" Lighting is uncomfortable -- pin spots that leave much of the place in gloom; several diners around us had to use flashlights to read the menus. Noise level was extremely high despite the place being only two-thirds full by the time we left. (When full, the noise level must be violently, injuriously high).  The din is boosted by ""music"" that cannot be discerned clearly but which causes everyone to shout to be heard; conversations are strained and patrons and servers highly stressed. The food -- a kale salad and a carrot salad, a fish entree, a pasta entree, a side order -- was above average in quality, but in no way memorable, and portion size was very small in proportion to price. The desserts -- almond cake and chocolate cake -- were notably poor -- dry and bland. The wine list is interesting but, as with the food, priced 30%+ above an already high NYC restaurant mark-up.  A fresh fruit juice was perhaps four ounces for $14 -- insulting. We left hungry and dissatisfied, feeling ripped off and angry. We're New Yorkers, and we've traveled extensively in Europe, South America, and across the US, and know quality and creativity, service and hospitality, and what constitutes fair pricing for first-class cuisine. ABC Kitchen fails in all key areas. Jean-Georges Vongerichten should try to spend less time with his private equity investors and more time in the kitchen; if this place was ever any good, it now needs to be entirely reformed. But my guess is that JGV is too busy planning for his next quarter's shareholders' meeting.

Maybe it was just me, because the other three friends that I went with loved it. If I had to guess I'd say it was maybe horseradish or something like that. I don't like even a hint of that taste...But the dishes were good. The fried chicken was special, but I don't really like my greens drenched in butter... The pork shoulder was also interesting but it kinda fell apart into an indistinguishable mush (I think it was shredded and then molded instead of just taking the time to perfect the preparation of a whole piece of pork).

The ricotta was a rich buttery delight, beautifully complemented by the fig. This and the excellent olive oil are why I had too much bread. Also, wet plates should leave the table dry when everything is so delicious. The tuna was delicately seasoned with ginger and mint. It was like tasting tuna for the first time- as I've been on a baby-on-board hiatus.The sea bass presented over wilted greens in broth was excellent. The broth was clean and clear and why I had ALL the bread. This restaurant's food is note perfect and without pretension. My husband had the salmon and because he is a food-silly man who only eats three vegetables, I had his red cabbage and horseradish and it provided a side that gave interesting bite to my entrée. I also ordered the mashed potatoes which were sublime. I ate abundantly and without shame because I make milk and need sustenance. Dessert was an almond cake that was delectably balanced by an apple sorbet and a poached pear stuffed with some kind of sweet surprise.We had two bottles of Oregon (I think) wine that the French at the table ordered and we universally agreed were delicious.Baby decided to display her recently discovered vocal prowess but the ambience in the restaurant is the kind that absorbs high pitched noise.

The fried chicken was unlike any other fried chicken I've ever encountered - pan seared I think, and then fried in a super light and lacy batter with a spicy-tangy sauce on the plate.  The sea bass was amazing when it first came out with its super crisp skin which softened over time, but that's to be expected, it's sitting in broth - eat it quickly!  The dandelion greens were delicious too.  If you're as gluttonous as we are, you'd be crazy to miss the chocolate cake, and/or the apple pie to wrap things up.  Both were great.I wish we had finished earlier so I could have drooled my way through ABC Home instead of just pressing myself up against the windows outside and going home with Fishs Eddy instead.",1,1,2,Jennifer D.,"Sebastopol, CA",533,1779,86

My wife enjoyed her pizza as well.For dessert, we had the green apple sorbet (yum!) and chocolate cake with ganache and toasted marshmallow icing.

4.0,10/18/2016,"Awwww yeahhh: the mushrooms, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza. $22? I'd argue that's it's worth it. And I'm pretty cheap. I would also, however, argue that you can find comparable-tasting house-made chicken and pork sausage (with pistachio, potatoes and wholegrain mustard) elsewhere--instead of paying $18 for it here. But hey, this is a swanky place and you can rest assured that even if you break the bank here, you won't regret what you ate or drank.

5.0,10/12/2016,"Wow! Another fantastic experience in NYC.  I brought three clients to this restaurant on a recommendation from a friend I do some business with.  We dined a bit late around 9:45pm however the restaurant was busy and had a fun atmosphere.  The food = some of the best I have had in NYC.  I had the pork (photo attached) and my clients had various fish and steak options.  The drink menu was also unique however I went with my standard order Old Fashion with bullet rye and it was by far one of the best I have had in years.  For dessert, the carnal sea salt ice cream with Carmel popcorn on top.  It was delicious.  The wait service staff was also on point.  They worked in teams to ensure adequate service and they did a great job.  I'm looking forward to going back to this place when I return to NYC in a couple weeks.",1,1,1,Wade L.,"Orlando, FL",21,69,23
5.0,10/11/2016,"I have been fortunate enough to have eaten here twice now and have yet to be disappointed with the service, atmosphere and output of delicious food. I have tried multiple memorable things and everything is really worth a try and good to share. The table typically starts off with sourdough bread and radishes to clean the palette. Radishes can back some heat so watch out! Good and fresh nonetheless.As for appetizers, we shared the crab toast which was superb. I was able to taste the crab perfectly. Smooth on top with a good crunch from the toast. As for the pasta, I got the pesto fettuccine,entrée size, and it is definitely big enough for sharing. I thought it might have needed some salt but the pesto was there and the fettuccine was al dente. I also tried the ravioli with ricotta and it was like pasta puff clouds of cheese. Super creamy and yummy. I've also tried the infamous fried chicken dish and it really meets the hype. Crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside. As for the desserts, I tried the panna cotta and the sundae. The panna cotta was all right. Pretty standard. The panna cotta was soft and creamy and the fresh peaches was a nice addition to the dish. However, the star and the best thing I have ever had at ABC Kitchen is their Sundae. OMG it is just so good. I am not really a dessert girl but I would go back just for the sundae. The caramel popcorn, caramel ice cream, whipped cream, peanuts and hot fudge. It was all just so good and everything just perfectly complemented each other. My friend literally stopped talking after he took a bite in the middle of his sentence because he was blown away at his first bite. It was just that good.

4.0,10/10/2016,"Great restaurant for a nice date or dinner with friends. They definitely focus on the freshness and deliciousness of the produce. we found that the proteins were a little lacking in comparison.  Space is dimly lit but well decorated and modern. Like any other restaurant in New York space is tight but the restaurant makes you feel comfortable and it's cozy enough. We had the mushroom pizza and fish course both of which were good. The pizza has mushrooms, truffle oil, a fried egg and some other things that all make it a delicious umami bomb. Fish was a little overcooked and not particularly flavorful but the greens and tomato saved it.Expect to spend about $50 per person if you get a couple things. Great fresh food, particularly anything veggie. Not sure the service is up to par for the nice restaurant tier they're in.

4.0,10/10/2016,"I came for lunch on a Wednesday without a reservation and grabbed a seat at the bar. Obviously, the decor is beautiful. Shabby chic while still being polished, open while still being intimate. Everything from the tables to the plate ware was beautiful and bright, they really made a beautiful space. I went with the $34 prix fixe: Tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint, Ricotta and farm egg raviolo, pork ragu, chilies, sage and parmesan, almond cake strawberries & vanilla ice cream. To start I ordered the Mezcal Lavender Paloma with grapefruit ($16) and it was a delicious cocktail. They balanced the smokiness of the mezcal with the floral lavender perfectly, a great summer drink! The sashimi was probably some of the freshest tuna I have ever had. It practically melted in my mouth, very little chewing was necessary. And I'm not one to really care too much about presentation, but this was really very lovely in appearance, the pieces of tuna were arranged to look similar to a flower. And the flavors of the ginger and mint weren't too understated, I was worried that a classier joint would be a little too delicate with their fish but this was perfectly prepared. The entree was where things fell apart, and actually makes this review closer to 3 1/2 stars. It sounds great, it arrived looking rich and decadent. But I thought there was entirely way too much Parmesan. Some will claim you can never have enough, but it looked like my dish got caught in a snowstorm, and I didn't like how that factored into the dish when it came to texture. I also thought the pork in the ragu itself was overcooked. I was expecting something tender and almost shredded, but there were some sizable hunks in there that took too much cutting and chewing to get to. There was also a ton of sage, those wilted leaves were everywhere and were too overpowering for me. The ravioli itself was the star, with the delicious and perfectly cooked egg, and it was my favorite part. The dessert, usually my least favorite part of the meal, was delicious. The strawberries and ice cream were both so fresh, and the almond cake was moist but sturdy enough to pair with them. Overall it was an enjoyable meal with undeniably quality ingredients, but I'm not sure that I would come back without ordering from the prix fixe menu.",2,0,2,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",149,1401,3214

5.0,9/16/2016,"Finally a Jean Georges restaurant that I enjoyed!  I thought décor was very nice; similar to ABC Cocina - clean lines, almost rustic.  I enjoyed everything we ordered! - Line caught tuna - yum. Nice and bright flavor with the citrus that is added.  Fish seemed very fresh.- Crab toast - really yummy - clean - crab really shines through.  I kind of wish there was some avocado added, but it probably would have covered up the fresh crab taste. - Pretzel-crusted calamari: pretzel taste doesn't really come through, but the pretzel coating really makes it super crispy.  It's served with a chunky marinara and a mustard sauce. - Duck confit - omg that bacon marmalade that comes on top of the duck was devine.  The plate was put together so pretty too. - Fried chicken - upon receiving this dish, I was a little disappointed - it was a boneless piece of chicken on the plate with some greens on top of a mysterious yellow-orange sauce.  I still was unsure after the first few bites, but after a while, I couldn't stop eating it.  It's one of those dishes that make you confused, but in a good way.  I'm not sure why this worked, but it did.  It's like the faint spiciness was clawing at me to keep taking bites. Get it! - Sea salt caramel sundae - this was heaven in a little bowl.  They don't skimp on the ice cream - 3 scoops - so it's big enough to share. Below the ice cream is this rich chocolate syrup and there is a good helping of caramel popcorn and nuts all throughout.  Rich, salty, sweet... yum!

Also got the mushroom, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza which was delicious. For dessert, we had to get the Instagram famous salted caramel popcorn sundae, which was surprisingly not too sweet and I loved the crunch of the popcorn topping throughout.

We pretty much tried all the top suggestions on the menu which included the crab toast, the mushroom pizza, the snapper and fried chicken. All dishes did not disappoint! Although the crab toast was amazing as everyone suggests, a tiny flaw was biting into a hard crust. But don't get me wrong, I still highly suggest it as an appetizer! The mushroom pizza (about 10inch) was unique - it is topped with a sunny side egg that you're suppose to stir around the whole pizza. Also abundant on a variety of mushrooms! Yum! third dish- the Red snapper had juicy and thick meat, and to my surprise, topped with a crispy skin. And finally, my favorite, ""the famous"" fried chicken, as everyone raves about is indeed amazing! The dish is different from any usual fried chicken since it is crisped on very thin breading , and has juicy juicy meat. It's also topped with its house made spicy sauce (a variation of a Tabasco sauce), and comes with a bed of spinach. If you come here try it! We left with full and very satisfied tummies.

5.0,9/12/2016,"I've walked around ABC home and carpet quite a few times and every time I get to the back of the main floor, I always see this ""small"" cafe looking place where people are eating. Well little did I know, this ""small"" little appearing cafe is a huge restaurant down below. All I was seeing was just a small section. The restaurant decor is gorgeous. This restaurant is owned by the famous Jean Georges who also owns the 3 Michelin star French restaurant at 1 Central Park West (Trump International Hotel & Tower). He also owns the sister restaurant attached to ABC kitchen next door named ABC Cocina where they serve more of Latin based tapas. This man is doing it all! We ordered a prefixed ($34) with the raw tuna as starter, ravioli for entree and the salted caramel sundae for dessert. The raw tuna was very fresh and the sauce so good! The ravioli had ricotta cheese and a runny egg inside. When you cut it open, the yolk spills over the pulled pork under. I don't know what the heck they put into this dish, but the flavors were amazing. Everything went so beautifully well together. I personally had the lobster. I originally wanted the black Sea bass which I heard is super popular and wonderful, but they didn't have it today and was going to substitute with branzino fish instead which I didn't like so I went with the lobster. The lobster was roasted with some spices. The level of spice was perfect, just mild. It was simple, but somehow they still made it taste so good. Usually roasted seafoods are dry, but this restaurant was able to maintain its juiciness and texture, a plus! The crab toast appetizer was delicious. The bread was hard, but even the bread had flavor. I think they soaked it in olive oil. They use real crab meat and smear it all over the toast with a good amount of crab meat. You get 2 loaves, cut into 4 pieces. Last, but not least, the salted caramel dessert had 2 scoops of salted caramel ice cream with caramel popcorn on the sides and some fudge and peanuts. It kind of tastes like a snickers ice cream bar in some ways. It was pretty good. We also ordered a side of corn which was pretty good too. They cut the corn fresh from a cob, use their own homemade butter and threw some scallions and secret ingredients in it. This restaurant is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for which is Jean Georges deliciousness! Now, I want to try every one of his restaurants! Supposedly, he has restaurants all around Manhattan and is simply amazing. We randomly came in as walk ins for lunch and was lucky enough to have a high bar seating table. Make reservations.

I felt as if I was in Williamsburg rather than the city, and the decor was very beautiful.

So many good items on the menu that we had a hard time picking something out, so we asked the waitress to help us. She pretty much made the decision for us and we couldn't have been happier. The dessert was very fluffy and light and all the food was top notch, it also came out fairly quickly.

Ambiance: A+ Honestly, my favorite part of this restaurant is the decor and ambiance. I'm biased because I am a huge sucker for white, minimalist chic decor, and when I stepped foot in the door I feel in love with the place. I want to decorate my kitchen and living room a la ABC Kitchen. Service: A- Service was quite good, the waitstaff was accommodating when we asked to switch tables because our original one was awkwardly big for our group. Only downside was they charged us a $5/person fee for cutting the birthday cake we brought with us, boo. For that price I could have bought another cake. Food: AEveryone at my table ordered something different, and each dish was delicious!! I had the kasha and bowtie pasta with veal meatballs, which was very heavy and flavorful -- almost too flavorful because about halfway through I couldn't stomach any more but I finished it anyways because I hate wasting food. I preferred the more subtle flavor of my friends' halibut and lobster entrees. The buttered corn and dandelion greens side dishes were also incredible. I did love the watermelon mimosa and the sundae dessert I ordered though -- salted caramel ice cream with popcorn and hot fudge, yummy!! Overall, a solid pick for special occasions.

I came here with my sister for a late dinner and we ordered the calamari appetizer, fettuccine with pistachio pesto, the pork confit, corn (side dish), sparkling fuji apple and ginger juice, and the blueberry lemon trifle for dessert. We mentioned that we were going to share everything and, to our surprise, our entrees came already divided into individual bowls. Very sweet that the server remembered we were sharing. Also, ask for bread and they'll bring you some. The calamari comes with a mustard aioli (not a fan) and a tasty spicy tomato sauce. That was a hit! The main attraction was definitely the pasta. Pistachio pesto over thick fettuccine with green beans, tomatoes and sprinkled with Parmesan. So delicious and flavorful! Must try. The pork confit was yummy as well, crispy and flavorful. The beets that came with it were so good too! I'm usually not a fan of beets but this changed my mind. The blueberry lemon trifle was okay, not bad not excellent. I must mention, the service is really good. Water was refilled constantly, plates were cleared in a timely manner, the table was always kept clean and tidy by servers, and they were so friendly.

We sampled the sea bass, salmon, and pretzel crusted calamari.  All were fresh and delicious.

5.0,8/19/2016,"I came here in a group of 5 for a summer work lunch and the restaurant week menu ($29).  We made a reservation weeks in advance but I know some of the front tables are left for walk ins. The décor and atmosphere of the whole place is beautiful and modern, which makes sense since they own a home goods store.  We all started off with the Shaved Raw Fluke which was fresh and covered in a light dressing.  The cuts were the perfect size and a nice sized portion for the appetizer. The dressing was delicious and we used some of the table bread to dip in it.  We also ordered the Mushroom Pizza ($22) for the table outside of the Restaurant Week Menu. It was completely covered in a variety of different mushrooms, which I was a huge fan of.  It also had an egg in the middle making it richer.I ordered the Portobello Sandwich, and also got to try the Raviolo and the Salmon.  The Portobello Sandwich is probably the best I've had, for something that can be very bland.  It had a lot of flavor from the jalapenos and lemon mayo.  Also the rosemary fries that come with it are so good, wish I could've had more.  The Salmon is definitely the healthiest of these choices and comes surrounded by roasted carrots.  The carrot sauce was delicious if you like carrots, probably would've enjoyed the sauce a soup, to be honest.  The salmon was a very tender cut and nicely fell apart, we asked for it cooked to medium and I thought it was perfect.  The Raviolo was so good and rich.  It was excellent with the pork ragu sauce and the egg in the middle.  I would definitely recommend trying this with the heads up that it is very heavy.The two desserts were Chocolate Cake and Strawberry Pavlova.  The Chocolate Cake was the most moist cake I've ever had and the marshmallow icing added nice texture.  It also had malted milk chocolate balls on it.  I didn't know what to expect for the Strawberry Pavlova, but it was strawberry sorbet on top of a ""meringue"", with fresh strawberries on the side.",0,0,0,Chelsea L.,"New York, NY",8,17,0
1.0,8/18/2016,"It was a disappointing dining experience. We went for restaurant week lunch. We did expect it would be busy but we didn't expect that the service was like this. We needed to ask everything such as water, bread even our wine pairing by ourselves. Our server didn't introduce himself or say anything when he gave us the menus. While we were having appetizers, we found out all of other tables had bread on the tables. & we did see a small plate of salt and a small plate olive oil. So we asked our server if we can get some breads. (We did take some time to find our server.) We got wine pairing for our pre-fixe but the last wine didn't come with out dessert. At that time, out server was disappeared, so we asked someone else to find him and for our wine. The wine came after few minutes but we've finished our desserts already. Therefore, we had nothing to pair with.The servers didn't explain or say anything when they served our dishes or took away the empty plates.

3.0,8/18/2016,"Used to be one of my faves but prices are really too high to justify the quality of food.  The menu is thoughtful and go with the whole farm to table idea but poorly executed in my opinion.  This place is more about the decor and ambiance which is outstanding, but don't come expecting to be blown away by the food... most of the customers don't look like they eat much anyhow so perhaps they got it right with regard to their target audience.  Worth trying once, but don't expect value and don't go with that friend of yours who always seems to be in the bathroom when the bill comes (you know who i'm talking about).",0,0,0,Doug R.,"Manhattan, NY",160,68,0

4.0,8/16/2016,"After dining at ABC Cocina, we stopped by ABC Kitchen to check out their menu. I've been wanting to dine here every since. I loved how the menu really tries to showcase their market vegetables.The inside of the restaurant is what I want my future house to be. Rustic and homey, but still elegant at the same time with all white furniture. A reservation is recommended, otherwise I noticed they seat you more towards the cramped bar area. It is darker in the dining room than in the bar area though. I was able to make a reservation about a week and a half in advance.Crab toast with lemon aioli - I can't believe these tiny pieces of toast was $16. So expensive, but so damn delicious. They peekytoe crab was paired on a sourdough bread toasted with butter and taste of garlic. I dislike anything mayo-like, so I avoided the aioli, but my boyfriend said you could barely taste it. I definitely recommend to order the toast and shareButtermilk and Crawford cheddar biscuits - The biscuits were super fluffy biscuits with a subtle taste of cheddar. Not like Red Lobster biscuits at all that's just dripping with grease and butter. The waitress didn't mention it to us when she asked if we wanted strawberry jam to go along with the biscuits, but the jam is an extra $3. If I had known I wouldn't have ordered the jam. $3 for jam is such a rip off. She made it sound like the jam would be included. The biscuits were great without the jam, so save yourself $3.Mushrooms, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza - I love how they go all out and cover every inch of the pizza with the toppings they are trying to showcase until you can't see the cheese. No surprise that the pizza was extremely mushroomy, which was enhanced by the mushroom jus drizzled on the pizza. I did think the pizza needed more salt. The toppings made the crust extremely soggy, so it was a mess eating the pizza.Summer squash, feta, caraway, chilies and lemon pizza - I loved the flavor of this pizza even more than the mushroom. The mushroom pizza had a blander and more one-note flavor in comparison. This pizza was slightly saltier with the feta. I thought it would be like mush, but the thin slices of layered yellow and green zucchini were still slightly crisp. I'd order this over the mushroom pizza next time. I found out later that my boyfriend has a friend who actually works there. His friend recommend to get the fried chicken, which unfortunately is not served during brunch. I'll have to come back for dinner just to try it.",8,6,7,Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",479,885,4955

5.0,8/12/2016,"Great, trendy ambiance and very attentive staff made for a wonderful experience. But what made this a 5 star restaurant for me was the food. We had the lunch prefix which was absolutely amazing! I had the kale salad which was fresh and very nicely dressed, not drowning in dressing but also not dry. Made me really enjoy eating healthy. I do, however, regret a bit not getting the tuna sashimi, which bursted with flavor! Amazingly fresh, and sitting in a mixture of salty, nutty, zesty goodness, it sent my tastebuds in euphoria. My girlfriend opted for the portobello sandwich which as also busting with flavor but I think I did better in the main course round by ordering the raviolo. It was a hot summer day so I was a bit concerned about being overwhelmed by the richness of the pork ragu but I still went for it. And it was amazing- the perfectly textured raviolo had a runny yolk in it which coated the tender pork ragu making every bite absolute perfection! We ended our meal with the almond cake, which was yummy, and the salted caramel sundae topped with crunchy popcorn. The sundae was insane! It was so good I felt like it should be illegal! We also shared a beautiful bottle of Sauvignon Blanc, and I think for a lunch menu, there were plenty of options- both by the bottle and by the glass.I can't wait to return here and try the dinner menu!",1,0,1,Irina P.,"New York, NY",30,63,173
4.0,8/11/2016,"This is a review for their restaurant week lunch menu.First impression: Elegant and modern, farm-to-table atmosphere. Overall, the food is tasty with some hits in some places and misses in others. The service was less than stellar even though the place wasn't particularly busy with patrons because they were transitioning to their dinner menu. Our water always remained filled but the timing between courses took longer than expected, forcing us to twiddle or thumbs. It was a little difficult to flag down a waiter for the check after we finished and spent a while waiting for it. Even the guests who were seated next to us later in the afternoon ended up leaving earlier.We had a small complimentary bread basket to start with some olive oil and salt to accompany it. For appetizers, we had the shaved fluke and the tomato and raspberry gazpacho. The shaved fluke was delicious and bright tasting in the lemon, olive oil, and dill sauce. The gazpacho was good but I think I could have done without the raspberries. For the main course, we had the raviolo and the salmon. The raviolo was absolutely delicious with generous amounts of shredded parmesan. The egg in the middle was well cooked and the whole dish came together perfectly with the pork ragu. The salmon was served medium rare in a sweet and spicy carrot sauce. I generally do not like carrots but they were roasted perfectly and complemented the salmon well. The salmon was delicious and very tender but overall it felt like something was missing from this dish.Dessert was probably the most disappointing but I find dessert a little underwhelming at most restaurants. We got one of each of the desserts offered -- the chocolate cake and the roasted peaches with pistachio ice cream. The chocolate cake is great for any dessert lover who loves rich and decadent chocolate desserts because it was made with malted chocolate ganache and topped with a toasted marshmallow icing. The roasted peaches with the pistachio ice cream combination did not work for me. I love pistachio ice cream but it actually tasted too strongly of pistachio for me. The texture of the ice cream was closer to being soup or yogurt and not as creamy / airy as I would have expected. The roasted peaches were delicious but not enough to save the dessert.I think I might have enjoyed the restaurant more if I had tried their normal menu and not their restaurant week menu. Perhaps I will visit again and give them a better evaluation next time.Overall rating 3.5/5 rounded up to 4",0,0,0,Pam W.,"Queens, NY",283,40,11

We loved the decor and the organized quirkiness of the space. The service was attentive and professional. In the past I have hate Jean Jorge restaurants (been to 4) as I find the portions too small, prices too high, and food unremarkable. I didn't feel that way at all about abc. The food was actually quite tasty and I left full. I was not amazed by any dish but I thought each dish had a nice flavor profile and was well cooked. The least satisfying course was the appetizers. The kale salad was rather underwhelming and the fluke though flavorful seemed below quality (stringy and tough). Crude should melt in your mouth. But the fish improved with the Salmon in a terrific carrot sauce and the portobello burger was full of flavor. My favorite course as usual was desert. The peaches were cooked beautifully and full of flavor.  The pistachio ice cream actually tasted like pistachios and complimented the peaches terrifically.

The impeccably-cooked carrots had formed a sweet, caramelized texture and the crunchy seeds & sour cream ""dressing"" was lighter than I expected it to be. My entree, crispy shrimp salad with mixed grains, was slightly less impressive only because I thought the shrimp were slightly overcooked and too heavily breaded; I would've appreciated a light & airy flash fry on them.

I ordered the Crab Toast, which was heavy with an extremely strong, fishy aftertaste (even after I used the 2 lemons). This level of fishy flavor was definitely not expected. I had to force myself to finish the 4 pieces. The Roast Carrot and Avocado Salad was pretty good - the carrot was perfectly roasted and the seasoning was unique. They are generous with the avocado servings. I tasted my friend's Shrimp Salad and it was okay - nothing amazing.Overall, this place wouldn't sit high in my recommendation list.

4.0,7/10/2016,"After spending a few weeks trying to get a dinner reservation at a normal hour for my husband's birthday, I did get a table on a Sunday night at 5:30, right when the restaurant opens for dinner. It was nice to be one of the first to walk in when the restaurant was calm and quiet. We waited at the bar and I got a raspberry Bellini which was strong and sweet. The interior was beautifully done with a clean and modern yet rustic feel and as my husband noted, the restaurant probably used the very dishes that are sold at ABC carpet and home. (Make sure to take a stroll around the store, which is connected to the restaurant). Our server was attentive, polite and knowledgeable--one of the better experiences we've had in the city with servers. He recommended the roasted carrot and avocado salad and it was unique and delicious. The heat of the spice in the carrots was balanced nicely by the cooling avocado. We also got the cured meats and local cheeses which was good and fresh, but not amazing. We were most excited for the pasta with veal meatballs (veal was good but would have liked the pasta less al dente) but what was EXCELLENT was the mushroom with farm egg pizza. Don't be a snob, just order the pizza at this fancy pants restaurant and you won't regret it lol. The mushrooms were so savory on top of the creamy cheeses and the crust was one of the best given that it came out of a wood oven. When you hit the yolk, it's out of control creaminess :9 We also had the crispy pork confit which had a nice, crispy skin and tender chunks of meat. But honestly, after the pizza, it was hard to be impressed. But of course, we couldn't leave without eating dessert. I know everyone raves about the sundae with salted caramel ice cream and popcorn, but we wanted something light so we ordered the toasted almond panna cotta with glazed apricot and apricot sorbet. It was just the right dessert for us because it was light and refreshing. They also brought out a chocolate cupcake with ""happy birthday"" written on the plate, which was a nice touch. They don't sing at ABC kitchen, they're too classy for that lol.

4.0,7/9/2016,"We stayed in NYC for the weekend and picked this spot for brunch on a Friday afternoon. Service was excellent - the wait staff gave great recommendations and came by pretty often to our table. For food we ordered the famous crab toast and carrot salad. The crab toast was a bit too fishy for my taste and the lemons that came with it weren't quite enough to mask it. It was a generous amount of crab though and pretty tasty overall minus the fishiness. The carrot salad, as everyone has said, was delicious - huge chunks of fresh avocado with seasoned roasted carrots. Overall the experience and food were solid and I will be back to try something new!",1,1,3,Alyssa L.,"San Francisco, CA",9,37,140
5.0,7/6/2016,"I've lived in New York City for 3.5 years and this is by far one of the best restaurant experiences I've encountered. From the moment you walk in the atmosphere is incredible. The greeting at the host stand was lovely, we sat at the bar while waiting for our reservation and had a drink. Selection was wide and we were given samples of any liquor we wanted to try before deciding on a cocktail. They transferred our drink tab to our table when we were seated so we didn't have to worry about it. Ordered a bottle of wine and appetizers which came out quickly. Crab toast is as good as everyone says but a MUST is the carrot and avocado salad - the best carrots I've literally ever had. Mushroom pizza was incredible. We did not have room for entrees because we wanted to try to sundae which was also as amazing as everyone says.

5.0,7/4/2016,"I really enjoyed the food here. I got the lunch prix-fixe menu that came with marinated tuna, ravioli al uovo in a pork ragu sauce and the almond cake. The next time I came I had the mushroom pizza and the basil mint panna cotta. The almond cake didn't do much for me but everything else was delicious. I also tried the apple ginger soda and the basil lime daiquiri. Both were delicious as well. I couldn't believe how flavorful the panna cotta was. I love this place, but it is pricey. Also, I've come during the week between noon and 2pm, I think, and it seems hard to get a table if you're just walking in unless you are eating alone.

We found the entire experience to be fantastic. The craft drinks were cool and refreshing for summer.  For starters we had the highly recommended crab toast and the tuna shasimi  in ginger and mint which were both delicious and thoroughly enjoyable. Our waitress, summer, overheard us talking about the fettuccine with English peas and pesto and how was just too much food along with their entrées. She surprised us by bringing it out to us in a small portion size. It was to die for.  For our entrees, My wife  had the hake and I had the red snapper.  Both were amazing.  With no room for dessert we still ordered the chocolate cake because after all it was my birthday.

5.0,6/27/2016,"Every aspect of ABC Kitchen - the food, the service, the decor - is absolutely remarkable. My appetizer of housemade fettuccine with basil-pistachio pesto was by far the best pasta dish I have ever had. The fettuccine was a perfect al dente, the pesto was bursting with flavor, and the grated cheese added a perfect salty note. I will have dreams about this pasta. Regarding entrees, the salmon with a sweet and spicy carrot sauce and roasted carrots was simple yet sophisticated. Though this dish could have benefited from one additional component to make it a more cohesive entree, I did appreciate the quality of the ingredients used. The chocolate cake, which is filled with a malted chocolate ganache and topped with a toasted marshmallow icing, was a great ending to the meal, but the true standout dessert was the sundae with salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts and popcorn, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream. Our waitress informed us that this is both their most popular dessert and most consistent dessert, as it has been on the menu for six years. I can certainly see why. The ice cream is so soft that it almost has a gelato-like quality, and the salted caramel flavor really shines through. While this sundae can probably feed one devoted individual (example A: myself), it really is the perfect size for sharing. I honestly could not have asked for better service. Our waitress was a true stand-out. Besides demonstrating impressive knowledge of the menu and making valuable recommendations, she took the time to speak to the people at our table about topics not even related to her job (i.e. asking us about our plans for our time in NYC). I want to be friends with this girl hehe. Equally admirable is the interior decor, which simultaneously projects elegance and comfort. I could not stop admiring the white brick walls, beautiful chandeliers, and delicate china, to name a few.Can't wait to return!",2,1,1,Kate F.,"Philadelphia, PA",159,90,101
1.0,6/27/2016,"I had an ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE time at ABC Kitchen. The service was rubbish and the food was unimpressive at best. First, we made a reservation and arrived fifteen minutes early. The restaurant was quite empty, yet the hostess Laura with the pixie haircut was adamant that we wait until it was time. She didn't invite us to the bar, so we had to seat ourselves there. At the bar, the baristas and bartenders did not even take a look at us and did not come over until it was my third time prompting them. When we got to the table, we ordered bottled still water, but the water came in a sketchy bottle that made us question whether the water was actually bottled or just tap.  When we inquired, the server was incredibly impatient and really impolite. The bread that they served later was cold. Our server also forgot our order and had to ask us what we ordered for THREE TIMES. The food was not good enough to make up for the UNFATHOMABLY HORRIBLE AND ARROGANT service we had to endure at this restaurant. All in all a terrible experience. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.

We had to look at our menus with the candles as it was that dark, and we ordered a couple dishes to share. Crab toast with lemon aioli- highlight of the meal. Must order! Generous servings of crab with a nice light dressing to it.Mushroom pizza, parmesan,oregano and farm- bomb. The egg was perfectly runny, and the mushrooms were delectable! Asparagus pizza, bacon, ricotta, parmesan and black pepper- not as good as the mushroom (still yummy), but if you love asparagus, this is for you! The top is criss crossed layered with thinly sliced asparagus, and there's a ton of bacon everywhere. Nice combination of everything. House made chicken and pork sausage with pistachio, potatoes and wholegrain mustard- this was okay. Would not recommend.Fettuccine, english peas, sweet onions and basil-pistachio pesto- solid pasta dish! We finished this in minutes.ABC Kitchen I felt was a little hyped up, but it was still good!

We are in town only for a short time and the first thing we did was call the make reservations. Being the weekend, the available time for our size party(5) was limited as we were aware might be the case before calling. My wife called to make the original reservation and set a time before we had a chance to discuss the timing. While making the reservations asked if she could take the only available time for Friday and if it didn't work call back to change to Saturday. The person (Danny) on the phone said that would be fine. Within 2-3minutes we talked about it and decided to do Saturday instead and I called right back. The person I spoke with first told me the would be $45/person fee to cancel and make a new reservation. I explained to him it had only been made in the last 5 minutes. He said he would wave the fee and made a new reservation for us but before he hung up he said "" I fucking hate people"" and we I asked him to ""please tell me more"" he quickly hung up. Because of this extremely poor experience over the phone I decided to call and check on our reservation to only find out we didn't have one. So, needless to say we will not be eating there tonight and unfortunately will never on any future trip.

During my second visit to abc kitchen, I asked the waiter which dish he'd recommend from the brunch section of the menu. He proceeded to tell me that the brunch section was very short, and that everything on the menu was self-explanatory. I didn't ask for an explanation of what was on the menu, I asked for a recommendation. After the food came, my friend commented that ""perhaps he couldn't answer our question because he had nothing to recommend since nothing was worth recommending"". A pretty apt summary of our meal.

Started out with the crab toast which was, as promised, a revelation. Super crab-y and bright, definitely the highlight of the night. We loved the roasted carrot and avocado salad, perfectly dressed and the roasted carrots were delicious. Mains were the red snapper and the burger both of which were perfectly cooked (though maybe less unique). We had the seasonal cherry pie for dessert which was good though I would have appreciated more filling and less crust. The pistachio ice cream that came with it was the perfect mix of salty and sweet and was spot on. I loved my Meyer lemon mimosa and my SO enjoyed his pear and whiskey cocktail.

4.0,6/13/2016,"Really great service and good food. I got the rhubarb negroni which was pretty tasty. It wasn't too different from the standard negroni, really. Based on other reviews, I had to try the crab toast with lemon aioli. It was good but didn't quite live up to all the hype. The roast carrot and avocado salad with crunchy seeds, sour cream and citrus was amazing though. Definitely the best dish I tried. The carrots were so flavorful! And avocado makes everything better. For the entree I split the whole wheat mushroom pizza with Parmesan, oregano and a farm egg. The flavor was good, and you can't even really tell that the crust is whole wheat. They definitely aren't stingy with the mushrooms either. However, the egg white was not even close to being set! The egg white jiggled all over the place. So clearly I scraped that part off the pizza. I also tried the seasonal fettuccine with spring peas, ramps and basil-pistachio pesto. This dish was bright, light and full of spring flavors, but still satisfying. The ricotta ravioli served in a tomato sauce looked good too, although I didn't get a chance to sample that dish. For dessert we ordered the doughnuts. We got a simple peach jam stuffed doughnut (the best), a simple chocolate glazed doughnut and a blackberry glazed doughnut, I believe. They were all good. The trendy interior was fun, but a little dark. If your eyesight isn't as good as it used to be (I haven't got to that point yet) you might have to squint at the menu a bit.

3.0,6/2/2016,"Seriously Over hyped and for no reason labelled as fancy as per NYC standards. I think the sister restaurant ABC Cocina is a lot better food quality wise, taste wise and atmosphere wise too. We were at party of 4 and were seated immediately I think after having made a reservation 3 weeks in advance. I almost feel like they monitor the online traffic and just to over hype and increase the want of this place they dont show reservations online. For most of the time that we were there between 6-8:30 pm there were quiet a few tables and bar stools empty. We started with the mushroom pizza with the egg on top and the egg was a little runny and the pizza was overloaded with mushrooms. A little less mushroom with charred onion etc must have felt better. We also had the pasta with meatballs..the meatballs did not overly entice me. I have had better tasting meatballs from costco and the pasta knots got harder in the middle as if they were undercooked as the food got a little cold. Kale-avocado salad was Meeeh!. We ordered the fish and I would say..dont order it. 32$ could be well spent on two apps rather than the fish. For dessert we had the almond pound cake which again was a pound cake with a side of slit almonds and strawberries. surprisingly none of us at the table liked it. The sunday was a better option for the dessert.

Maybe it's cause I'm from SF where this concept of farm fresh organic ingredients in food is really big, so there are lots of better options.I came with my bf for dinner. Since we didn't have reservations, we decided to show up right when dinner time started. They seated us at high stool tables near the bar rather than in the back, which looked really pretty/romantic. We didn't really mind and were just happy to get a table.For entrees we decided to try the sea bass and mushroom pizza based on reviews and our server's recommendations. Both were meh, though I think the pizza was better. The bass was TINY and honestly was not cooked so well. It was a bit overdone for me and I'm not surprised since it seemed like they basically boiled it in broth. The flavors were so simple and too basic for $32 - I think basically lemon and garlic. I'm a small person and I probably could've eaten two orders of the fish and still be hungry. The mushroom pizza was a good idea because without it we'd probably leave with half empty stomachs. It was pretty big and came with tons of mushroom. The egg sounded good on paper but was really tiny and maybe one slice got 90% of the yolk. The serve free sourdough bread here, which tasted stale. Not great but we ate a lot of it since the entrees were disappointing and not filling.

3.0,5/31/2016,"Overhyped. Underwhelming.We came on a Thursday night with reservations. Located in the ABC Home store, the restaurant has a really chic, romantic atmosphere.The food, however, was mediocre. The ONLY standout dish we had was the crab toast. If you must come, get the toast. Light, refreshing, and deliciously seafood-y fresh with the perfect combo of lemon and aioli. We also got the pasta with veal meatballs - the sauce was overly sweet and the meatballs had a good texture but were a little too salty. The asparagus, bacon, ricotta pizza was alright, nothing really worth talking about. We also got the salmon w/spicy carrot sauce. This dish was also just mediocre, and a little overpriced for it as well.Sidenote, the cocktails were tasty though! Though for a Jean-George restaurant it's a little disappointing to say that the highlights was an appetizer and the drinks. Definitely don't need to come again. Sorry not sorry Jean-George!",1,0,0,Joyce W.,"Boston, MA",492,479,1163
4.0,5/30/2016,"Beautiful spacious restaurant. We ordered eggs Benedict and French toast with coffee. Was bummed to get skim milk again to pair with my coffee (what's wrong with you, NYC?), but in their defense the coffee didn't need any milk as it was quite good. The server was a bit slow in refilling though, seems they won't automatically do so. The dishes looked deceptively simple but once I cut into my French toast I was amazed at how crispy it was on the outside and how custardy and light it was on the inside. Thought they were a bit stingy with the apples (3 meager pieces for a $19 French toast) but I guess that NYC norm? Anyways it was delicious, so much so I didn't bother to taste the eggs Benedict. Liked the farm to table focus and would happily return to try other dishes.",1,0,0,Jennie C.,"Chicago, IL",120,548,1018

5.0,5/29/2016,"My daughter graduated from the New School, near Union Square, mid-day on a Thursday. I had to find a place for a graduation luncheon for eight, within minimal walking distance, that had a menu to please palates that ranged from ""salt is the only spice you need"" to ""I'll try anything"" and gluten-free options for the two celiacs in the group. Impossible, right? Wrong. ABC Kitchen to the rescue.Initially, I called for reservations at one of ABCK's sister restaurants who couldn't fit our group in the required time frame. After hearing my ridiculous  needs, ABCK was recommended; I couldn't be happier with the choice.The staff went above and beyond to make my daughter's day special. Our waitress was well versed in the menu's gluten-free choices and took special care to place the appetizers my daughter and I could not eat at the other end of the table from us. We've been diagnosed for years and know what we can/can't eat so this wasn't necessary for us but I was very impressed with the extra effort. If you are new to gluten-free eating, and are nervous about eating out, know you will be in safe hands here.Now, the food! Family and friends lived up to my expectations with varied menu choices. The calamari appetizer was a favorite as was the sugar snap pea salad. For entrees we had the akaushi burger and various pastas, fish, and chicken. Everything was delicious and perfectly prepared. Special kudos to the kitchen and wait staff: All food was delivered simultaneously; too often with large groups at least one dish is left withering under a heat lamp. That was definitely not the case here. We were too stuffed to order dessert, but the staff still made my daughter a celebratory sorbet; attentive to the end, it was a gluten-free alternative to what they normally provide an honoree.I highly recommend both ABC Kitchen and their sister restaurants.",1,0,0,Roddi S.,"Shrewsbury, MA",0,1,0

I ordered a delicious sweet pea soup, half order of the home made delicate taste ravioli and the succulent French Toasts. My rating for the food is 100+ I really enjoyed the experience. I started with a cocktail that I can't recall the name but it was a Margarita with ginger, extremely refreshing and ended with a green tea hot and with that strong green flavor that I like.It is not a cheap restaurant, I spent approximate $95 (by myself) but the experience was totally worth it and I am planning to return next time I visit NYC.",1,0,1,Arlynes H.,"Miami, FL",54,38,2

The decor is beautiful, and a friend of mine had raved about the restaurant- so I was super excited to get a reservation for my brother and I to celebrate his graduation.The two reasons I was disappointed with this place was that our waiter was very aloof - maybe we got unlucky as it seemed that most of the other wait staff looked open & friendly. He just seemed bored. Additionally - The bow tie pasta with veal was just not good at all. It tasted like pasta covered in teriyaki sauce and ruined the meal for both of us. Everything had been great up to that point- the crab toast, the roasted carrot & avocado salad... But please avoid the bow tie pasta because it is so gross. Gloopy, thick and over flavored....I was so sad that I couldn't even eat half. I Tried to give it to my brother since I thought it was just me but he was grossed out as well.

4.0,5/19/2016,"The fresh closures of Telepan, Perilla, and A Voce exhibit the caliber of New York's restaurant scene. It is not only over-saturated but also dense with merciless critics. Michelin restaurants are quickly transformed with new successors that share the same doomed fate... and eventually they become a Chase bank branch. Like a speakeasy there is a back entrance through ABC Carpet and Home, a store that provides environmentally sustainable furniture. All décor is supplied courtesy of this establishment. Brick walls are painted with thick layers of milky white lacquer. Pillars of dark wood, untouched by varnish are piped throughout the dining room for a striking contrast. Simple metal pendant light fixtures, bare bulbs, and traditional Victorian chandeliers dot the ceiling. After sunset, candles materialize on white table surfaces illuminating the dining room with a flickering luminescence. After we were seated, thick slices of sourdough bread swiftly emerged on our table warm from the oven. The ""green"" minded furnishing parallels the restaurant's ingredients perfectly: strictly local and fair trade farm-to-table. Pesticide, antibiotic, and hormone laced foods are forbidden under Jean Georges Vongerichten' watch. The chicken and pork sausage is a great appetite primer ($17). The ground meat is rolled in crushed pistachios, encased, and grilled until blistered. It is perched on top of a fortress of golden baby potatoes, parsley leaves, tamed discs of jalapeno, and translucent spheres of radishes. The calamari ($17), was coated with pretzel dust and deep fried presented alongside chunky spicy tomato marina and a creamy ground mustard aioli but underwhelming. ABC Kitchen proves that a vegetable pizza can taste amazing. Thin ribbons of asparagus, fat-streaked bacon, ricotta and parmesan cover the pie like a nest ($18). It has an impeccable crust to topping ratio. The pork confit ($36) flirts with different textures and flavors. It was both sweet and savory, proving to be a satisfying choice for the indecisive. The pork is cooked so well, it collapsed effortlessly on my tongue. One surface was crisped to perfection for a well-balanced texture. The confit was accompanied by a small pool of mashed potatoes, braised leafy white turnips, and a lumpy smoky bacon caramelized onion marmalade that was syrupy sweet. For dessert, a sugar rush fueled by Chef Sean Considine's cookie plate ($10). A saccharine bouquet of chocolate chip cookie, citrus cheesecake, vanilla mallomar, meyer lemon linzer bar, and rose sugar goodies.The handcrafted cocktails at ABC Kitchen are impressive. The Basil Lime Daiquiri ($16) has a base of Papagayo white rum which is hand shaken in ice with a watery mix of simmered basil leaves, lime juice, and dissolved brown sugar. The flavors reminded me of a Costa Rican getaway. The Lavender Paloma ($16) is disguised in a gentle color, pink from grapefruit juice but is full-bodied with a smoky-flavored mezcal. A landing strip of floral lavender-infused sea salt kisses a side of the glass to be used as an aide.Some Pro Tips: The crab toast is their top selling appetizer. Customer service is immaculate. Reservations are unavailable day of. If you do not have reservations, plenty of seating is available as soon as the kitchen opens at 5:30 PM; you will be allowed to hold a seat until 7:30 PM.

Quick breakdown of what we had: -steamed artichoke with tender greens and spicy oregano sauce: This was pretty yummy. The artichoke was just right. The oregano sauce has interesting flavors. Only complaint was the greens were a little on the salty side. -rhubarb + cheese spread:I forgot the name of this, but this spread had yummy fresh rhubarb spread mixed with cheese, oil, and pepper. It was tangy, sweet, and slightly savory. It was perfect paired with their bread.-kale salad with lemon, Serrano chiles, and mint: I loved our simple this salad was. The kale was so sweet. This was a perfect dish to pair with some of the other stronger flavor dishes we had for the evening. -Pretzel dusted calamari with marinara and mustard aioli: I couldn't really tell that the calamari was coated with pretzel? But it was yummy none the less. Also tasted great in the spicy oregano dip from the steamed artichoke dish! -crab toast with lemon aioli: seriously heavenly. I want to cry just thinking about how I can't have it here in LA. Mouthwatering. Fresh. So sweet. So yummy! I covered in in lemon juice and ahhhhhhh! YOU HAVE TO ORDER THIS. -salted caramel ice cream sundae: Okay, I don't have a huge sweet tooth, but the ice cream is so money! The caramel corn and chocolate drizzle was pretty rich, but the ice cream I would love to eat alone, mmm! I washed everything down with two glasses of ice cold rosé.

She was exceptionally attentive and detail-oriented.I'm newly gluten-free (I know I know...) and I hate being the problem child when I go out to eat but it's a new trial recommended by several healthcare professionals. We ordered several dishes to share at the table and Summer Rose let me know exactly what I could eat and put any and all possible gluten products on the side for me. She was very educated on each and every dish and each ingredient. If she didn't know a definite answer, she would go and find out - which for me wasn't that big of a deal because I do not have Celiacs but it made the extra mile so much more meaningful! She was showed the same care and attention to everyone at our table and all her guests at her surrounding tables. I worked in service industry for a couple years and I know how easy it can to become very jaded by it. This is clearly not the case for her. She made the entire experience exceptional for all of us!

My cousin got this reservation 30 days in advance of the day he was visiting. We were able to get a 5:30 pm on a Sunday and it wasn't too crowded. There's a 10-15 minute window where it's okay to be late.. DECOR: There's three main parts to this restaurant! The bar/waiting area, the dimly lit dinning area, and the walk-in/casual area. Decor was gorgeous! There's plants everywhere! Some of the decor pieces include a chandelier and a victorian bookcase. The walk-in/casual area has a bar and a beautiful staircase. SERVICE: I had a crush on our waiter because she was SO SO eloquent and knowledgable about the menu. She gave us lot of great recommendations with thorough descriptions. We also had a waiter that cleaned the plates after we were done eating. He was also so nice and added to our overall experience. DRINKS: She recommended the basil lime daiquiri, the fruity drink that girls would love! My cousin got the mezcal lavender paloma. It has this smoky flavor to it. My friend also go the vodka thyme lemonade, also sweet and delicious! FOOD: Soft Shell Crab was the seasonal special! I would recommend it if it's around May/Spring Season. It was fried, crunchy, and soft on the inside. It laid over a bed of spring greens, radish slices, asparagus. Our waiter recommended the Roast Carrot and Avocado salad, crunchy seeds, sour cream, citrus. The sauce on this was divine. The carrots were heavenly~ and sweet like how they usually are when they're cooked. Crispy pork confit, smoked bacon marmalade and braised turnips! That crispiness on the confit is unforgettable yummy. Mushroom, parmesan, oregano, and farm egg. The consistency on the egg white was a little runny but mmm I do love a mushroom pizza. The mushrooms were a good size on the slices. 2 appetizers, 1 whole wheat pizza, and 1 entree was pretty filling for 3 people. But there's always room for dessert! We got the Basil and Mint Panna cotta with Meyer Lemon Sorbet! The Panna Cotta was soft and light. It came out looking like an egg because of the thinly sliced lemon on top.

Very white and clean furniture mixed with plants and tree trunks. We came as a party of 7 around 9pm without a reservation so we knew we would have to wait a while for the table. We waited around an hour.. which was expected so we just waited at the bar. Ordered wine and the crab toast which was amazing. Comes in 4 pieces so the sizes are not ginormous. The bartender actually recommended this appetizer since it was one of their most popular dishes. Definitely did not go wrong with this decision. Loved all 4 bites of it. I ordered the kale salad to share along with the black bass. I was looking for something on the lighter side and this was exactly what I was looking for. The sauce is not creamy or thick. It is more on the light broth-like taste. Came with lightly sauteed spinache and potatoes. Portions are not too big so ordering appetizers is a good idea! Their appetizers are delicious as well. I shared the kale salad with 2 other girls and it was a good amount of vegetables for a meal's worth diet. Highly recommend coming to this restaurant! They have other restaurants as well.

2.0,4/22/2016,"2 Star Update on 4/22/2016 - My wife likes this place and chose it for dinner.  I recalled not liking it, but didn't realize that I had made a mistake agreeing to this place until I saw the menu.  Nothing on it sounded good to me.  Two stars may be a bit rough for this place, but after paying what we did for the meal...I would never want to send anyone there for such a lame dinner.  There are 100's of restaurants that are way better than this place.  3 Star Review on 6/11/2014- I know I'm going against the grain here, but I've given this restaurant two chances over about a 6 month period.   This place boasts  of organic food in a restaurant that is visually beautiful.  It is packed and has great Yelp reviews for the most part.  However, I often found the pairing of things to be off.  The celery leaves with the portobello mushroom didn't add anything. The fava beans with the salmon just didn't sit well with my palette. Finally, the caramel ice cream with caramel popcorn again didn't work for me.   My thoughts are that people are either giving high reviews because they are caught up in the organic food or visual beauty of the restaurant or they are just too afraid to speak what the really feel.  Give it a try, you may disagree with me, but just try and check you bias and really evaluate if that food is as wonderful as other say or if you've had better elsewhere.",1,0,0,Lance H.,"South Jordan, UT",6,200,37

The restaurant itself is nice, with lots of edison bulbs, flowers on each table etc.Our waiter came by, and we first ordered the roasted carrot salad as we were perusing the rest of the menu. We'd heard good things about the salad and thought it a good place to start. He immediately told us, ""it'd be better if we order everything up front, since it will be much faster that way"". This was what, 5:35pm, and he was already looking to get us out of there ASAP. I guess he figured we didn't look like we belonged there, and so he thought his job was to clear our table ASAP.We still said we'd wait, and first ordered the salad. He dropped by a few times afterwards to check if we'd made up our minds. Finally under pressure, we ordered a half ravioli and the margarita pizza. He told us that the half portion of ravioli would only include 4 pieces, but we were fine with that. Looks like he put in an express order, because the food came in 10 minutes. I think by 6:15 we were done with dinner (and this is with two drinks).I wanted to have a nice dinner with the missus, and given the reviews was excited about the place. Looks like the staff didn't consider us cool enough to be there, and wanted to turn over our table as soon as possible. We had eaten at Eleven Madison Park the day before, and while it was several orders of magnitude better as a restaurant, it was also several orders of magnitude less snobbish.I had a subsequent reservation at Nougatine, which I canceled. I'll never go to any JGV restaurant again. Disappointing such kind of a restaurant still works in NYC.",5,0,0,Sideshow M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,4,0

5.0,4/10/2016,"My bestie brought me here for my last night in NYC. We had a reservation for 10:30 PM and the place was still poppin'. I don't really know much much about the NYC dining scene, but I do know people tend to dine late. The interior is absolutely gorgeous! Can I just live here? Please and Thank you! The ambiance is sort of a natural, soft, glowy and semi casual. There were accents of sweet vintage plates, tiny tiny flower arrangements on each table and even cuter tiny silver bowls filled with sea salt. Mercury glass walls as mirrors in the restroom? Be still my heart! We ordered the following: Crab Toast: 5 stars, I am still dreaming about the thick buttered, grilled Italian bread topped with fresh lump crab simply dressed with dill, lemon and olive oil and some dollops of mayo. If I were to go back, I would order two of these and not share. This is a MUST!Fried Cauliflower: 4.5 stars I really loved this, and the only reason I am not giving it a 5 is because I wish it was cooked a bit more. I loved the fried egg on top and the walnuts. It was plenty to share. Fettuccine with Pistachio Pesto and Roasted Brussels Sprouts: 4 stars, The freshly made pasta was amazing! This comes in half sizes also, which I recommend if you are going to have any starters at all. The pistachio pesto was really delicious, however I feel like it was slightly too salty. They add a ton of cheese on top and the saltiness of the pesto was just tad too much and covered up the sweetness of the nuts.  Mashed potatoes: 5 million stars, this is an a la carte item, but DO NOT SKIP! Holy heavenly deliciousness. The most perfect buttery mashed potatoes I have ever put in my mouth. There are plenty to share, so don't be greedy. Caramel Popcorn with Salted Caramel Ice Cream: 5 stars, one might think that this is too sweet, and it probably was. However I couldn't stop eating it and I was stuffed to the gills. The homemade ice cream topped with the most delectable hot fudge sauce that was probably extracted directly from Willy Wonka's chocolate river and sweet and salty airy popcorn. Diabetes in a bowl? Probably. Zero regrets. Z-E-R-O.My bestie ordered the fish and it was melt in your mouth delicious. Overall the service was top notch, which created a very memorable dining experience.

5.0,4/4/2016,"Came here on a Saturday morning for brunch - if you're trying to do a walk-in during brunch/lunch hours, I suggest you come in at 11 when they open because at 10:45am, there was already a little line forming outside of the doors.Unlike ABC Cocina, the food is not meant to be shared tapas style, although you can certainly do so if you'd like. The portions are tiny, but everything is really good. Between the two of us, we split the scrambled eggs with crispy potatoes, buttermilk pancakes with lemon curd, and eggs benedict with flying pigs farm ham. The scrambled eggs were european style so they were runny on the inside and tasted amazing. Our server was also kind enough to split the eggs benedict for us onto two plates so we could share it. The scrambled eggs and eggs benedict definitely took the cake home.We also had a ginger shot and an iced matcha latte. The iced matcha latte is unsweet and perfectly tastes of pure matcha, as it should.A pricey but great little spot for a fancier brunch.

4.0,3/27/2016,"All around phenomenal experience from the food, ambiance and staff. The starters and market tableoptions were fresh and tended to be more veggie focused. The main menu has essentially only one entree dish for each type of protein which makes the choosing a little simpler. All dishes were excellent, well seasoned and plated perfectly. Ricotta with rhubarb purée - updated version of a staple at the restaurant to reflect the spring season. Super creamy ricotta with a consistency similar to cream cheese and doused with high quality EVOORoasted beets with yogurt - mix of golden and red beets, roasted and mixed with herbs and EVOO. Delicate flavors with a nice natural sweetness Pretzel calamari - really crunch and satisfying with a marinara and chipotle mayo dipping sauce. I wish they gave a bit more in a serving...House made pasta with veal meatballs - waitress have us the heads up that the dish is sweet and savory so we wouldn't be surprised. It was mildly sweet because the sauce made of reduced Carmelites onions but it's definitely a more savory dish. The pasta has a nice bite and the number of veal meatballs was balanced. Chicken - nicely crisped chicken breast/thighs with a few fried thin potatoes skins and sliced boiled potatoes. Really moist chicken, prepared simply with salt and pepper. Hake - flaky whitefish that's pan cooked. Light flavor with half the plate covered in micro greens so makes for a refreshing dish Pork confit - approx 2 inch thick piece of pork that's pull apart texture with a nice crackling layer of skin. Accompanied with potato purée and a couple of grilled/wilted spring baby greens Side of Brussels - roasted Brussels with small cubes of pancetta. Smokey flavor without the overly saltiness that the pork can provide. Nice accompaniment to the Hake Desserts are absolutely amazing. The almond and chocolate cake were moist and nicely sized for sharing. The chocolate cake is probably slightly better than the almond cake because of the ooey gooey marshmallow topping that's been lightly torched. Soo good!!",1,0,0,Julia K.,"Boston, MA",162,361,919

I had burger cooked exactly like I wanted and was one of the tastiest I've ever had. Out of the entire menu though roasted carrots & avocado salad was the best thing in this restaurant.  Who would have known. Drinks, order what you know stay away from specials or exotic stuff they recommend, definitely a waste. Now on cons: ambiance is kind of off, fancy meets ikea sort of feeling. Art on the walls, light fixtures and cheap looking plain rustic looking tables/chairs. Oh the individual paper sheets in leu of the table cloths made me feel as if I was eating in a cheap Woodside Filipino joint. Seriously sometimes less is less.

4.0,3/16/2016,"I came here for lunch to meet with my account manager at Salesforce -- lo' and behold, it was an old friend & colleague from my days at Gilt. She recommended this place which I've never been to (but have been meaning too, since ABC Kitchen is like a god damn institution); but there's always been some younger, new, buzzier restaurant every week that steals my attention away from the classics. I walk through the antique-looking French doors and am greeted by a triad of employees grinning asking me if I have a reservation (of course). I tried to score a seat by the bar windows because you know... I wanted to take pictures of food bathed in natural light... but alas they don't serve food there so I frustratingly sat down at a table with my account manager like a civilized individual. There was a hanging light immediately above me so no overhead shots unless I wanted half my body to cast a shadow.Because my friend/account manager was working on her wedding body and I, my Fire Island body, we opted for the Lemon Thyme soda for $7 instead of the Clementine Mojito for $16. For starters we ordered the crab toast with lemon aioli ($16), roast carrot and avocado salad ($17) and shaved raw fluke with marinated apples and mint ($19). The crab toast was phenomenal, light, and meaty. You definitely got bang for your buck. The roast carrot and avocado salad is award winning and was pre-split into two dishes for us (thanks!), and it was mind blowing good. If rabbit food could taste this good always, I'd be a vegetarian. Lastly, the fluke was fluke. It was good but not as good as the first two.For entrees we ordered black sea bass with chilies and herbs on a bed of spinach ($32) and my friend the roasted hake with crunchy potatoes, broccoli, and red-chili garlic sauce ($32). The dishes were solid but not as sublime as the starters. Don't get me wrong, the sea bass was great, and the hake executed perfectly but I prefer really bold flavors which moreso came from the crab toast than from my entrees. For some reason I expected a whole fish to be placed in front of me, probably because of my asian upbringing but remembered I'm in a fine dining establishment so it was decent portion.I didn't get a chance to order dessert because at this point, this one hour midday work lunch had turned into nearly two hours. I would've ordered dessert had it not taken a decade between the starters and the main course. I was eyeballing the cookie plate for $10 and the basil & mint panna cotta with meyer lemon sorbet for $12.Lunch is packed by the way, make a reservation. My friend had to flag down a diff. waiter and give him the card because ours was busy running around with his head cut off serving the other needy tables.

4.0,3/14/2016,"I am honestly shocked that I am writing this 4-star review right now.  I visited ABC Cocina last summer and had such an awful experience that I swore off Jean-Georges restaurants until just recently.  I hesitantly made a reservation for a small reunion at ABC Kitchen, and I'm glad I did.  I went on a weeknight with some girlfriends.  Myself and another member of our party were both over 10 minutes late, and they kindly sat our third friend on time, which I thought was super cool of them.  They also didn't make me feel horrible about being late.  Bonus points there.  The restaurant itself is very cute inside.  It is trendy and very open.  We ordered drinks first.  I got the Mezcal lavender Paloma, which I did not love.  One of my other friends got the ginger margarita, which I preferred.  I would probably do that drink if I could do it over again.APPETIZERSMUSHROOM TOAST: Served with cheese, lemon, and herbs.  I LOVED this.  Thick, crunchy bread.  They pre-divide the toast into 3 pieces, so it's easy to share.CRAB TOAST: Served with lemon aioli.  I liked this a lot but preferred the mushroom toast.  I felt like we had to order this because of how wildly popular it is.  I certainly enjoyed it.TUNA SASHIMI: OMG yes.  Small portion but amazing.  Very thin pieces of tuna in a sauce made with ginger, mint, and apparently fairy magic because this was amazing.ROAST CARROT & AVOCADO SALAD: I hate cooked carrots but even I could get down with this.  Reasonable portion of carrots, avocados, and some seeds.  I liked it.ENTREEROASTED HAKE: I split the hake entree with my friend.  It was served with potatoes and broccoli in a reddish orange chili sauce.  They let us put the sauce on the side and they pre-split the entree for us.  I really enjoyed this a lot - it certainly has a kick to it though, so put the sauce on the side if you are wary of spicy food.DESSERTSUNDAE: Huge sundae with caramel ice cream, peanuts, and popcorn.  It's kind of hard not to like this.  Great size for sharing.  The service was mostly good; our waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful.  All of the staff was polite.  I did feel a little rushed - one of the clearers asked me if I was done with my entree while I was still chewing (more funny than anything so no big deal).  I liked that our server was able to make recommendations based on what we said we liked.Total bill came to $211 for 3 people - it wasn't cheap, but the food was good and we left full, so I wasn't annoyed either.  It was the type of experience that made me rethink ABC Cocina (maybe we went on a really off day?) - I'm really glad that I gave this place a shot.  Would recommend.",2,0,1,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",285,134,933
2.0,3/10/2016,"I came here for brunch with friends who love ABC Kitchen. As someone who adores brunch in general, I looked forward to a real treat, seeing as how our reservation was booked 4 weeks in advance. Unfortunately, it was just an expensive blah. ABC Kitchen is trendy, sporting a rustic meets modern design (mismatched silverware and all), ironically set to a light 90s rap/R&B soundtrack. It's cute for sure. I stared and stared at the menu, with no idea what to order. Not because I couldn't decide due to so many options. I simply couldn't find anything that grabbed me. It all just seemed... uninteresting. I looked around to see what others were eating, and I found it underwhelming. We ordered donuts and cheddar biscuits for the table. At $10 for two tiny donuts, they'd better be amazing. They were fine, but nothing extraordinary- a theme that lingered throughout the meal. The cheddar biscuits were forgettable, and not served with the lemon curd they apparently complement, so I can't comment on that. We shared a mushroom and egg pizza, which was good, but not the taste explosion I had hoped for. Ultimately, I ordered the scrambled eggs and potatoes as my entree, which I never order anywhere, but I was that apathetic about the menu. The eggs were fine, I guess the best you can expect from a scrambled egg. The potatoes were bland and unseasoned. They went unfinished, and that's even with asking for Tabasco to add some taste. I didn't order dessert because I didn't see the point- $50 spent already for just myself, and I just didn't want to feel underwhelmed by another overpriced plate. Out of the 4 of us, just one person ordered dessert.

2.0,3/8/2016,"This is one of those times when I wish there were a half-a-star option. I could have gone with two or three stars. Two and a half would have been more appropriate. Ultimately, I went with two because it is highly unlikely I will ever go back. There was nothing redeeming enough to make me want to give it another chance. Other than being a bit on the expensive side, nothing was wrong, mind you. It was just terribly unimpressive. And when your restaurant is tagged with the ""celebrity chef"" category, you need to impress. Clearly they have pulled off a smoke-and-mirrors routine of convincing some people that ABC Kitchen is a ""happening"" place.We were there for a brunch. The restaurant made a BIG deal about needing a reservation. They even made half of our four person party aware that after 15 minutes they would give our table away (when the other two people were five minutes late). Yet there were PLENTY of empty tables in this rather large restaurant. In fact, people who walked in off the street holding yoga mats were seated without reservations. We started with the homemade donuts. There were two light and fluffy donuts on the plate (for a table of four??). One of them was OK. The other fell onto the take-it-or-leave-it side of the spectrum. However, when you're paying $10 for two little donuts, you shouldn't be inspired to leave it.The calamari was OK. Although, the best thing about it was the mustard aioli... which is a good thing- because the tomato dipping sauce was thin and watery. Our table shared a mushroom and egg pizza for our other appetizer. This was probably the best thing ordered that day. Still, not enough reason to go back. And from there on, nothing wowed. Our table included ravioli, an omelet, scrambled eggs, and a burger. The burger- which was ordered to be cooked ""medium""- was very under-cooked in the middle. The person eating it enjoyed it, but the red color in the middle was in NO WAY ""medium.""The spinach and ricotta omelet was OK... although the eggs were a bit overcooked and rubbery. The scrambled eggs were not fluffy at all. Bland. In fact, Tabasco sauce was requested to give the eggs some flavor.The dessert menu was uninspiring so only one person at our table ordered.

5.0,3/3/2016,"My mother always wanted to eat here and as an aspiring pastry chef and avid food venturer, I gladly took me and my mother here for lunch. We didn't make reservations and was told a table would be ready for us in ten minutes, but if we didn't mind the bar, we could sit and dine immediately. We chose to sit at the back bar which connects Abc kitchen to the abc store and the other abc tapas restaurant. The environment was absolutely exquisite and elegant. It had a modern, yet rustic and homey feel due to the white wall contrast to the wood piers and furniture. Everything from the plates to the tables looked organic. At the bar We had a lovely server- she was so sweet and took care of us.We ordered the mushroom toast, the beets with housemate yogurt, and the roasted carrot salad.My mother and I shared everything. We had cute European tea like plates which had a spring like feel to them. The other plates were thin and rustic looking made of clay in this cream Ivory color which complimented every dish. The mushroom toast came out first - it was presided into four pieces but presented as one whole toast- there were thin slices of pecorino cheese under a sautéed mushroom with a light gravy which was then added to some sort of lemon juice that didn't overpower the entire mushroom topping to make it super tangy or sour. It was absolute perfection - I'm craving it as I am writing about it- the bread was incredible- artisan and full of flavor, crunch with a dark crust. The beet salad came next- and goodness it was a sight to see!! The colors were vibrant and beautiful and the Reds, yellows and white and the small micro greens made the presentation look inedible. But we are it anyways. The housemate yogurt was so creamy and not too tarte. It complimented the balsamic glaze which sat at the bottom of the bowl topped with moist and perfectly boiled(?) beets of red and yellow. It tasted clean and fresh, a much different experience in your mouth and palate compared to the mushroom toast. Finally the roasted carrot salad came out- our sweet server told the kitchen we were sharing and kindly split the salad on to two separate plates for us! The carrots sat at the bottom while the toasted sesame and sunflower seeds decored the top of the salad. I believe what it was as broccoli or some sort of sprouts were the main green with a light (very light and perfectly) dressed with some sort of dressing. It was a very refreshing dish except I found myself disappointed because the carrots were surprising seasoned with curry- lots of it; so much that it overpowered the flavor of the carrots which I was hoping to taste. Overall, my mother and I were truly overjoyed with our experience there and will definitely plan to go back soon!",0,0,0,Anna K.,"Manhattan, NY",144,73,138

Definitely get the ricotta/cranberry on grilled bread, carrot salad (amazing) and the crab toast. I got the chicken entree, he got the lobster. What really set ABC Kitchen apart from the rest was the service.Our server's name was Emily. Not only was she incredibly professional and accommodating, but she went above and beyond to make our experience perfect. We shared with her that we were trying to get a reservation for Valentine's day, without success. When it came to dessert, we told her we were torn between the chocolate cake and the apple pie. We talked it out and we decided on the cake. To our pleasant surprise, she brought both desserts out for us.

4.0,2/27/2016,"3.5 StarsDecor is reminiscent of farmhouse meets simple, elegance - alot of wood elements and white used throughout.The complimentary bread with olive oil and sea salt on the side was quite good, nice and chewy.The crab toast was an enjoyable bite of crab meat mixed with aioli, tarragon, and herbs on top of crispy, hard toast. The lemon garnishes on the side helped cut down on the slightly oily feeling of the crab mix.The mushroom pizza with a runny egg on top was good but not a standout. The crust was very thin on the bottom and topped with dollops of three types of creamy white cheese (ricotta, Parmesan). I liked that the pizza had a lot of mushrooms on top...my favorite part was the mushrooms.The eggs Benedict was ordinary - a toasted English muffin with a poached egg on top, some hollandaise, and Flying Pig ham. The ham was really the best part, very tasty ham. The crisp potatoes on the side, with ketchup, were so-so.The brussel sprouts with bacon and pear was good. There was very minuscule amount of pear, the bacon didn't stand out, and the brussel sprouts were slightly bitter in the center. It was a simple dish.Most of the dishes here were simple, mostly good but not outstanding or wow-ing. I liked the crab toast the best and wouldn't reorder any of the other dishes.The dessert of salted caramel ice cream with chocolate sauce on the bottom, caramel popcorn sprinkled around and a bit of cream on top was good, not amazing but good. I liked the ice cream the best, it had good flavor, the extra garnishes weren't necessary.

The combination of flavors with the tuna was outstanding.  Tuna was fresh as could be.  We also shared the crab toast and were in heaven with this choice.  We both had dreams about it for days.  Small pieces of sourdough toast with a crab salad on top.  Slight touch of hot without taking away from the flavor.  For our dinner we shared a mushroom pizza with a sunny side up egg in the middle.  The consistency of this gooey egg combined with the pizza was heaven in my mouth!  The pasta dish we shared was spinach fettucine with shaved brussel sprouts and a pistachio pesto.  Also amazing.  Although we were stuffed we just had to get a dessert as recommnended by our waiter.  We chose the caramel ice cream with popcorn.  Ice cream was heaven.  Our waiter was very attentive and friendly and made great suggestions.  The restaurant is decorated so cute.  Very rustic and great mixed light fixtures with wooden beams on ceilings.  There was a really cool display of vegetables but not near me otherwise I would have taken a picture.  Will definitely be back again!",0,0,0,Beth P.,"Bergen County, NJ",5,195,167

2.0,2/23/2016,"I wanted to see what all of the ABC Kitchen hype was about since this place books at least a month or two out.  I have heard about this place for a few years and have always been unsuccessful getting a reservation.  I surprisingly got a last minute reservation a couple days before.  The ambience of the restaurant is really nice so it is a nice place to grab a drink at the bar or take a date to eat; however, the service was not good upon walking through the front door.  We arrived a few minutes prior to our reservation time and the hostess/host advised us that our table would be ready within a few minutes.  We waited approximately 15-20 minutes past our reservation time before sitting down.  There were plenty of empty tables and the place was not even busy for how hyped up this place is.  Once we sat down, it took a while (5-10 minutes) for our waiter to bring us water and take our order.  It felt like he had forgot about us throughout the entire night and we attempted to flag him down a number of times and were unsuccessful.Based on suggestions and also reading Yelp reviews, we ordered all of the top items and some suggested by the waiter: Crab Toast, Roasted Carrot and Avocado Salad, Mushroom & Egg Pizza, and some pasta that I don't even remember the name because it tasted like I was eating Spaghettios.  The Crab Toast could have been really good if there was some more flavor, but this appetizer was VERY bland.  You could taste that the crab was very fresh, but there was not much flavor otherwise.  The lemon aioli was very, very faint and I feel like there could have been a little bit more.  The Roasted Carrot and Avocado Salad didn't have much flavor as well.  The salad comes with all of the items not mixed together so if you mix all of the items it helps a little bit, but it was not my favorite and definitely not worth the price.  The pizza was a huge disappointment.  You could taste that the mushrooms were very fresh; however, it was very bland as well.  I would rather spend $1 on the pizza on the corner as opposed to $20 for soggy bland pizza.  Go to Italy if you want an amazing pizza with the PERFECT crust.. or if you can't go to Italy go grab a dollar slice.  The pasta dish was probably the worst dish I have tasted in my whole entire life.  It tasted like the chef opened up a can of Spaghettios and dumped the sauce into the dish.  If you like Spaghettios, then get this dish, if you know your pastas and sauces, DO NOT GET IT.  If you want good pasta, I can cook a better dish and I just started learning how to cook.It may be that this was an off night and there were different cooks because a lot of people have recommended this place, but based off of my experience, I don't think I will go back to ABC Kitchen anytime soon.  The dishes were way too overpriced for how everything tasted and bland.  I've had way better places in NYC that cost half the price and have as many different dishes than this place.",0,0,0,Alexandra V.,"New York, NY",1,7,4
5.0,2/23/2016,"We participated in a pre-planned shared menu for a group event and the dinner here was absolutely amazing.  Appetizers included roasted beets with yogurt, crab toast, tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint but the roasted cauliflower with onion and walnut crumbs was the most obvious winner.  The nutty sweetness of the crunbs complimented the cauliflower perfectly.  Another winner was the mushroom pizza with parmesan and farm egg- the creamy cheese and egg was well paired with the earthy collection of mushrooms.  Being an ardent mushroom lover, I thoroughly enjoyed the glazed assorted mushrooms sauteed with chilies and herbs.  For my entree, I ordered crispy pork confit with the smoked bacon marmalade and braised turnips that was amazing.  This dish was probably a high end interpretation of the usual BBQ pulled pork.  The pork was succulent and tasty and the smoked bacon marmalade echoed the taste of home made bbq sauce. I liked the added savory braised turnips as an added farm-to-table contribution. Don't forget to save room for dessert!  We devoured the almond cake as well as the seasonal donuts.  The salted caramel ice cream came with something that was reminiscent of cracker jacks (minus the toy in the box!) - this dish although tasty was not as well attended to since people preferred the almond cake and donuts.  The service was attentive and the sommelier was available to help us pair our wines.  This was an amazing dinner and everything was delicious.",0,0,0,Vivian T.,"New York, NY",145,280,152

I was thoroughly impressed with the decor and how true they adhered to the farm-to-table concept. The food was simple and delicious but not very inventive. I also found the huge list of suppliers in the back of the menu to be pretty hilarious like where the table and plates came from and and the pork and the veggies. It's almost mockingly detailed.Appetizer: At the recommendation of our waiter, we ordered the crab toast with lemon aioli. The crab tasted very fresh but overall the dish was a little too salty for my taste. The lemon aioli was also a little overpowering for the crab. Entree: I ordered the ricotta ravioli with tomato sauce which was delicate and light. The raviolis were filled to the brim with ricotta and the acidity of the tomato sauce cut through the rich cheese very nicely. Very simple but done with quality ingredients. Dessert: We ordered the spiced pumpkin creme brulee with pomegranate sorbet to share. For me, this was the highlight of the meal. The creme brulee was perfectly creamy and sweet with a nice crunchy top. The pomegranate sorbet was tart and went perfectly with the pumpkin spice. Overall, cool concept and meal experience.

4.0,2/18/2016,"IN SHORT: In the ground floor of ABC Carpet and Home, alongside the Latin-inspired ABC Cocina, lies ABC Kitchen, Jean-Georges Vongerichten's tribute to upscale, organic cuisine.THE STORY: When it comes to creating a restaurant, Jean-Georges Vongerichten is an expert at many things, not the least of which are the quality and creativity of the food emerging from the kitchen. Indeed, from a perfectly cooked piece of particularly herbal sea bass, to an addictively salty sweet pea guacamole, Mr. Vongerichten's empire has produced so many signature dishes that we sometimes forget new plates when they show up on the menu.Yet despite these plates of food that we just can't stop thinking about, Mr. Vongerichten's greatest talent may be his utterly unrivaled ability to craft a sense of place in his restaurants so articulately and so completely.So, missing your second home in Easthampton with its open, airy living space complete with artfully mismatched chairs made from reclaimed driftwood? Nostalgic for the way your staff acted at your Memorial Day party, with just the right amount of warmth and aloofness? Especially yearning for those summer afternoons when you could muse over the organic selections at Citarella while sipping fair trade coffee with the Barefoot Contessa herself?No? Really?? Well, ABC Kitchen thinks you do, and is here to provide all the upscale rusticity and shockingly good organic cuisine your sophisticated heart desires.Everyone who is anyone is raving about the Crab Toast, deliciously pink and briny with the juiciest citrus flavor from the lemon aioli, but people are also talking about the Roast Carrot and Avocado Salad, a deceptively simple dish that packs plenty of flavor and texture with crunchy seeds, sour cream, and citrus for a light, healthful finish.Shaved Raw Fluke presents a lovely, elegant marriage between the naturally sweet fish and marinated apples, while mint adds a compelling spicy, herbal note to balance everything out. If the plates ever feel like they lack a warm, more personal touch, it is only because Jean-Georges, like one's many summer cocktail parties, is so prolific. Tuna Sashimi can be found on the same menu, marinated with ginger and mint for a more Asian-inspired interpretation of the favorite dish.Pastas are the most mediocre options on the menu, and the Kasha and Bowtie Pasta is often too chewy and gummy, taking away from the tender pleasure found in the veal meatballs accompanying it. Pizzas, however, could certainly make an appearance on the table, particularly the mushroom, parmesan, and oregano pie topped with a delicately cooked farm egg, full of creamy, savory bites and just enough hearty, crusty texture.Still doesn't remind you of that perfect weekend at the end of summer when you sat in the sand in your $800 dress and nibbled on sustainably sourced caviar? No? Well perhaps this kind of loud, exhaustive, high-voltage atmosphere isn't for everyone. But at ABC Kitchen, the food is great, the room is pretty, the company is attractive, and sometimes it's worth feeling like you belong so inherently to this type of place.",2,2,2,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245

Entrance is on 18th street through a bar area. You can also enter from the ABC Carpet's main entrance on Broadway during business hours. Dining room was packed on Thursday night dinner at 8pm. It was somewhat loud so it wasn't that easy to keep a conversation going and also dimly lit.Menu has a lot of options, grouped by market table, appetizers, pasta, pizzas, entrees and sides. A lot to go over before making a decision but so many excellent dishes which makes it hard to just pick one for each course. It was group of us so decided to get bunch of dishes and try different dishes as much as we could manage.Here are some of the dishes we enjoyed; roasted beets, house-made ricotta, crab toast, tuna sashimi, kale salad, calamari, raw fluke, salmon, hake, chicken and the pork confit with mushrooms, brussels sprouts and braised cabbage for sides (didn't have room for pastas or pizzas this time).Start with cocktails or wine then share everything.

Portion size was very reasonable, around 6 pieces. Overall taste was pretty good. The tuna came in a mixture of soy sauce and other ingredients which gave it a nice tangy kick.Main Course: Crispy Shrimp Salad. Honestly this was the most disappointing dish which is why I could only give this restaurant 3 stars. The ~15 pieces of fried shrimp were average at best. The salad was pretty plain and also quite average. There was also a lot more salad than I had excepted.Dessert: Salted Caramel Ice Cream Sundae. Two scoops of salted caramel ice cream, caramelized popcorn and peanuts, chocolate fudge, and a small scoop of whipped cream on top. Can't go wrong with that combination, however, it was very sweet and even with my sweet tooth I couldn't bring myself to finish the entire thing. They had a large variety of different drinks, from wines to cocktails. I ordered a hard pear cider which was pretty good.

I only wish they had cut the sprouts in half before cooking. I always enjoy mine with a little crisp on the leaves. Regardless, this was delicious. Spinach, goat cheese and herb pizza-Amazing! The herbs make this pizza very unique and almost addicting. I would eat this over and over again. Crab toast with lemon aioli-The crab was amazing. Very fresh and not overly 'sauced'. It was simple and delicious. I do wish the toast wasn't so hard though. It felt more like a crouton and almost hurt to eat. Roasted carrot and avocado salad:Very delicious and highly recommended! The carrots are cooked perfectly and the dressing is a great balance. I will note that the complimentary bread wasn't my favorite. It fell short and was a bit dull.

Though juicy, the piece of chicken lacked a good sear and was extremely bland.

Scored a high top table for Monday lunch, just in time for restaurant week.  I've been to a few Jean George restaurants and this was one of the best.  They truly do have fresh and local ingredients.  Here's what my friend and I got the following for lunch:Appetizer: tuna sashimi and the lentil soupLunch: crispy shrimp salad and raviolo with pork raguDessert: almond cake with poached pear & green apple sorbet, salted caramel ice cream sundae with caramel popcorn and chocolate sauceHighlights:  The tuna sashimi was superb, very fresh!  The raviolo was delicious!  The egg yolk inside with the ricotta was perfectly made.  The pork ragu was a great pairing.  After a bit, it tasted a little salty and heavy.  We shared so having the salad was a good balance. The dessert was the cherry on top of a very good meal!  I loved the almond cake the most.  It was moist and scrumptious!The service was very very good too!  My water glass was never empty and the food came promptly dish after dish.  I was curious about the 'grain salad' blend and asked one waitress.  She didn't know but another waiter came by to tell me, which I really appreciated.  They gladly welcomed any feedback that I had too because some of the dishes were new.Will definitely come here again!",0,0,0,Tracy W.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",19,56,110
2.0,2/3/2016,"Restaurant Week 2016 Lunch - lentil soup, pork ragu and apple sorbet.  All mediocre - tasted like junior sous chefs were in the kitchen.  The lentil soup tasted like it came from a can.The skin of the large ravioli in the pork ragu was thick and rubbery and hard to chew.  The apple sorbet tasted like chilled ground green apples, no big whoop.Not as tasteless as Le Cirque RW, but mediocre nonetheless.  Nice, upscale floral ambiance though.",1,1,0,S S.,"New York, NY",4,50,7

5.0,2/1/2016,"One of our favourite NYC meals and definitely the best service we received!First off, the decor in this restaurant is cool. Loved the way the place looked with the exposed wood beams, and the mixture of natural wood and painted white for the furniture. The room felt warm and modern at the same time. When we were there, all the servers wore plaid shirts which helped them to stand out against the decor.This is probably the only restaurant we've been to in NYC where we had a reservation and they seated us BEFORE our whole party arrived! I was the first to get there and thought I would be waiting in the entrance for a while, but not the case! They seated me right away, no problem. Amazing. It was incredibly busy and packed while we were there but we never felt rushed and even after we had finished our meal and paid our bill, the servers kept coming back to refill our water glasses and make sure we were taken care of. Attentive but not overbearing. We tried several appetizers and salads, unfortunately I can't remember all of them. For entree, I had the Ricotta Ravioli which I loved. New York really knows how to do pasta right! We were stuffed by dessert but the 4 of us shared the Sundae - Salted caramel ice cream with candied popcorn and peanuts and chocolate sauce. I guess it's not really my thing (I don't love peanuts or caramel corn!) but I'm sure it would appeal to others. Wish I could comment more on the food (lack of memory, not that it was at all bad), but overall this restaurant really impressed and I would highly recommend it!",2,0,0,Mel L.,"Vancouver, Canada",55,190,111

4.0,1/26/2016,"After the huge winter storm blew over, we were lucky enough to find an early dinner reservation at ABC Kitchen - a place that I've always felt was pretty difficult to score a seat at. Although it was pretty empty when we showed up at 5:30 on a Sunday evening, it was definitely much more packed when we headed out a little before 7. The decor has a very similar feel to ABC Cocina, albeit a tad more intimate, with the ceilings being lower. That said, the noise was pretty manageable despite the low ceiilngs; if anything, the racket caused by the heating pipes coming to life was louder than anything else. Our waitress was very efficient  in taking our order and getting food plated, although it may have been that she was on her way out (the check was brought by someone else at the end of the meal). I had the mezcal paloma - a bit light for my tastes, and with salt way too far down on the glass - and the beer menu was somewhat disappointing - but that didn't hamper my impressions of the food.We started off with bread for the table - warm and chewy, very good for dipping in the olive oil provided; I did like the crystal salt that was provided as well to give it a bit more taste. We then started out with the best dish of the night, which was the crab toast. Such great flavor and moistness, contrasted against the crunchiness of the toast, made for some seriously tasty bites. When I come back, that is definitely one to repeat. The tuna sashimi was really good in the ginger and mint flavoring; arguably, the ginger in the sauce was a tad overdone (it was almost a bit spicy), but I really liked the strong flavor. Frankly, it was also needed because the cut of tuna wasn't the best - definitely more on the chewy side, and not something you'd see at a sushi restaurant - but I liked it nonetheless, as it allowed the sauce to really get soaked up into the fish. The roasted cauliflower, to be honest, was probably my least favorite dish here. Served almost like a toast, the onions and walnuts tasted more like a very generic spicy tomato sauce, and the fried egg didn't really work with it either. The pasta was better; the fettuccine with the basil-pistachio pesto (and a load of nuts to boot) had a very warm, earthy flavor to it. The brussel sprouts helped make the very green dish have a very homey feel to it, too. We finished up by splitting the lobster. Pretty tasty overall, with the lemon-chili vinaigrette definitely detectable from the heat in each bite. The meat was pretty flavorful, although I would say that at the menu price, I thought it was a little bit on the high end. The desserts were above-average, like the rest of the meal, as well. We shared the donuts; my favorite was definitely the Boston Creme imitation, while the lemon-glazed donut was a very tart take on a glazed donut. The spiced apple cider was a bit generic; I've never been an apple-infused donut guy, so that probably explains why I didn't really have much of a reaction to that one. The chocolate cake was very good, but somewhat standard; the main thing I liked about it was the toasted marshmellow 'frosting' around the edge; that gave a nice, chewy contrast to the decadence of the cake.Overall, the food here was very solid, although I would say that I did like my experience at ABC Cocina a bit better overall. I'd definitely come back, but I would probably check out some of the other dishes, as well as keep an eye on the check (it does add up pretty quickly here, especially when you are hungry after being snowed in). A great place for a cozy dinner that has a laid-back, chill feel to it.",2,1,0,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169
4.0,1/24/2016,"I came here for restaurant week lunch. The food was very good but more of a comfort food good. It was very filling. I started with the ahi tuna sashimi, flavorful but soaked in soy sauce. For the entree I had the raviolo with pork ragu. This is basically a giant ravioli that when you break it has an egg inside and ricotta. It's on top of delicious pork. This dish was so good, so very very good. However, it's extremely filling and is a dish I could have easily shared with someone (especially since you get two other dishes for restaurant week). We finished with the almond cake (excellent) and the caramel ice cream sundae with caramel popcorn which was good but nothing particularly special/innovative/exciting.The ambiance is fun. It's a very cute, well decorated restaurant. This is a good place to go to enjoy a good meal with friends.

2.0,1/22/2016,"Came here with a few friends for brunch on a Sunday. We had a little bit of a wait but we were able to roam around in the area while we waited since they have a text alert system. Always makes the waiting process a little easier!I loved the interior and decor, but can't say the same for the food. I was a little disappointed by the small selection, especially for the brunch options. Everything was pretty standard with your basic eggs benedict with ham, a few omelettes and scrambles, and french toast. I'm always looking for something a little more innovative especially when it comes to brunch, so I definitely had a difficult time deciding what to get. Ultimately I decided to stay away from the breakfast options and get the kasha and bowtie pasta with veal meatballs. Overall it was just okay, kind of bland and not really what I had anticipated. I think I had higher expectations for this place, so the fact that it was pretty mediocre was a let down.

5.0,1/22/2016,"I came here for the restaurant week deal and was very excited to try this Jean-Georges establishment. I had to really bite down and check for a dropped reservation every hour, on the hour this week and I finally snagged one for a Friday lunch. The entrance to this restaurant is deceivingly small and subtle considering how massive it is inside. It was very busy during this lunch hour, but because it was so spacious it didn't feel too crowded. The interior is very hip with young vibes and minimalistic in design which matches the organic, fresh theme of the restaurant. They first start you off with some delicious bread and olive oil which is always a plus for me. My boyfriend and I started with the TUNA SASHIMI and KALE SALAD. The Tuna Sashimi was tasty and buttery soft dressed with a light garlic dressing! The Kale salad was very fresh and fluffy (never thought i'd describe a salad like that), but a bit underwhelming. *tip* after I was done with the sashimi, there was leftover garlic dressing left and I dipped some bread in it and it was amazing! Just a little suggestion for anyone who orders the tuna!We then had the EGG RAVIOLI stuffed with a creamy ricotta cheese and a runny egg yolk (If you don't like runny yolk, you should let them know!) over a delicious pork ragu. This is probably one of the best dishes I have ever had in my life. The pork was braised perfectly and so soft and savory against the creamy ricotta cheese and egg. An unexpected combination that really delivered with all of its complementary textures. Also, I would like to note that I was stuffeddd after this dish. For dessert, we had the ALMOND CAKE with sorbet and the SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM with cream fraiche and popcorn. The almond cake was light with a very subtle almond taste which I appreciated. It was a bit dry so the cream that came with it really helped, but the SORBET. Ohmygod, hands down the best sorbet I have ever had. So light and tangy and refreshing, I would have just ordered bowls and bowls of that. The Salted Caramel Ice Cream was on the richer side with chocolate syrup underneath, but still delicious. The toffee popcorn was softer than I expected which is a big plus for me because I have sensitive teeth (I sound like an old lady). But,i probably wouldn't come back for that one, but definitely coming back for that sorbet though. All in all, great experience and service. Waiters were knowledgeable about the menu and were happy to give recommendations. Also, as a restaurant week deal, my boyfriend and I had the 3 course meal for only $25 each which is a steal!!! The ambiance was fantastic and I would love to come back again and try more things on the menu.

4.0,1/16/2016,"ABC Kitchen provides a full dining experience. From the food to the ambience and finally the service. The service is fantastic here. The waiters are so attentive that when my friend went to the bathroom, a waiter came and picked up the napkin he left on his seat and refolded it. He refolded a USED napkin. Maybe I don't eat at enough places with this type of service, but I was blown away. I even saw a hostess helping customers into their seats. Food: Overall, the food is good. The portions are actually enough to fill you up. Although it's very pricy, I can see how the chefs take the time to make sure everything is properly made.Seasonal Glazed Donuts ($10): They give 2 donuts. I was pleasantly surprised by both flavors. It turns out that the chocolate one was a Dark Chocolate Glazed! I was really happy that they used dark chocolate, but it was overshadowed by the second donut. The plain glazed one turned out to be a Lemon Glazed & after my first bite, I knew that was it. If I ever order this dish again, I would ask for 2 Lemon Glazed Donuts.The donuts weren't overly oily or fried. They were soft, but not the softest that I've had. Thankfully, both flavors weren't overly sweet. Burger ($24):My friend asked for the burger to be cooked medium and it was perfectly cooked. The cheese is grated, which is unusual technique for a burger. However, it's not the best burger that my friend has had.Scrambled Eggs with Crispy Oyster ($23):Crispy is just a fancy word for fried...there were about 5-6 oysters in the dish. It's not overly oily, but you can taste how unhealthy it is. My favorite part of the dish was the eggs. The scrambled eggs are soooo silky (I think they added some cheese) and soft, I LOVED it. Although the portion looks small, it was the perfect amount. I asked for the butter to be placed on the side, which I'm glad I did because it was totally unnecessary.This restaurant does have a long waiting time. Reservations fill up quickly, so book ASAP (like a week or more in advance). Otherwise, walk-ins are accepted. They do text you when your table is ready. At 12pm on a Saturday, I had to wait about 40-45 mins for a table of 2. I definitely recommend making a reservation because the tables they seat you at are nicer and have better lighting.

I would describe the decor as rustic chic, and the white furniture proved to be the perfect backdrop for the beautifully plated food. On to the food! ABC Kitchen commits to using the freshest organic and local ingredients possible, and the seasonal menu reflects that.

The first time I ate here, I had the pre-fixe.  I had the shaved raw fluke with crushed olives, dill, lemon and chilies, the ricotta and farm egg raviolo accompanied by pork ragu, chilies, sage and parmesan, and lastly, the almond cake with poached pears and green apple sorbet. The fluke was good but it was not memorable. The raviolo's best point was the egg yolk, which was made perfectly, and oozed rich buttery perfection into the pork ragu. I must admit the pork was a bit too salty for my tastes, but the egg definitely helped cut it. The cake did not astound me but since it wasn't too sweet, it added a great balance to the end of the meal. The second time I ate here, I had the housemade ricotta ravioli with herbs and tomato sauce, as well as the salted caramel sundae with popcorn and peanuts. The ravioli was delicious although I do wish the portion size had been greater. The sauce was just the right amount of sweetness and acidity. The caramel ice cream was subtly buttery and very sweet. I would definitely have the ice cream again should I return for a meal here. I would come here early for lunch if one would want a quieter lunch or more attentive service since the restaurant becomes extremely busy even around 2-3 pm on a weekday.

The sparkling water tasted like carbonated tap water. The restaurant is freezing and horribly drafty to the point where I had to go get my coat from coat check and wear it during the meal - I'm the kind of person that is alway hot. Everything was very spicy with no mention of this on the menu. Started with the tuna sashimi it was fine. The kashi pasta wasn't al dente it was hard and undercooked. We asked how the cauliflower starter was prepared it was insanely spicy and this was never mentioned. The lentil soup tasted like lawn clippings. The lobster was also undercooked and parts were raw - opaque raw. Everyone at our table has eaten lobster MANY times and at much nicer restaurants and this was raw. The manager came up to us and told us she checked with the chef and they were in fact not raw. I'm sorry you don't tell the customer they are wrong. Ever.

5.0,1/9/2016,"i loved this place!we came here for a company christmas dinner and really enjoyed our experience from the moment we came in to the moment we left.  we had a group of 15+ ppl and chose the prix-fixed menu ahead of time.  we got to share market table items, apps, sides, desserts, and each person get to pick their own entree.  i think for the price and quality, it's an excellent deal.so here's what we ate and drank:-roasted kabocha squash toast:  i love kabocha squash!  ABC's version featured sweet roasted kabocha, ricotta, apple cider vinegar on a crispy buttered toast.  it was sweet and savory.-crab toast with lemon aioli:  fresh crab meat topped with lemon aioli, on a buttery toast, it was so fresh and chock-full of crab meat.  it had so much flavor and possibly my favorite from the night, still thinking about it as i write this review.  excellent!-roasted cauliflower, onion and walnut crumbs, fried egg:  tbh, not a huge fan of cauliflowers, but ABC's version wasn't too shabby, the cauliflower was nicely seasoned, the onion/walnut crumbs were tasty!-tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint:  the marinade was flavorful and not overpowering, tuna was very fresh.-roast carrot and avocado salad:  the carrots were pickled and roasted, good contrast against the rich and creamy avocado salad.  -pretzel dusted calamari:  crunchy, tender (definitely NOT rubbery), flavorful, this was very good too!-mushrooms, parmesan, oregano, and farm egg pizza:  good earthy, robust mushroom flavor (i love shrooms!), but mushroom mixture was kinda ""wet"" and made the crust soggy.  -wood oven roasted lobster: sweet, tender, succulent, with a squeeze of lemon, we're in business!  i really liked it.-glazed mushroom:  sauteed mushroom, okay, nothing too special. -sundae with salted caramel ice cream:  their signature dessert and i really like the salted caramel ice cream.  it's perfect balance of sweet, creamy, and just a hint of salt.  the candied popcorn was great too.-chocolate cake with malted chocolate ganache:  moist and dense, however, a bit too sweet for my taste.-seasonal doughnuts:  there were three, a cream-filled chocolate glazed doughnut, a raspberry (or strawberry?), and a glazed doughnut.  my favorite is the cream-filled one, vanilla + chocolate glaze = perfection!-ginger margarita:  fruity and a good amount of booze that hits you later.  ;-)-lime and basil daiquiri:  fresh!the service here is impeccable, our plates and glasses were never empty (we had a few bottles of reds and whites, but i couldn't remember the names), food was perfectly seasoned and cooked, the portions were just right, and i left with a very full belly.  overally, possibly my favorite meal of 2015.  :-)",2,1,0,Wen Jin G.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",77,190,786

It makes for a great atmosphere for couples and groups alike.So, food: we had the tuna sashimi, avocado and carrot salad and three different pizzas. They were all delicious especially the salad. The pizzas are wholewheat and fairly small in diameter but come with a lot of topping and we found them really filling. I love the farm to table dining theme; there were many other things I would have liked to try!Our service was friendly and efficient.All in all, it was a lovely experience and definitely worth a return trip.

3.0,1/3/2016,"I really wanted to love this restaurant. I have been aiming to go for years, but since we don't live in the city, we cannot just stop by, and reservations are impossible to get for the times we need. But last night, we got there at 5:45 on the advice of the woman who picked up the phone there. She said that the restaurant was fully booked, but if we come by around 5:30, there might be seats in the bar area. She was right, and we were seated on a high table behind the hostess stand. It wasn't the most comfortable perch as we felt the chill every time someone came in or left, but alas we were in.So after the long buildup, I was primed to love the place. But I didn't. The food was fine, but nothing blew my mind. The crab toast as many have written is the standout. The problem is: if you eat the standout item right at the beginning of the meal, the rest of the night is a letdown. After the toast, we moved to the kale salad. Honestly, I have made it better myself. It was a smallish pile of thinly sliced kale with a hint of dressing and a few sliced chilies. Then it was on to the entrees. My husband ordered the salmon, which was described by our friendly but distant waiter, as coming from some special place. The provenance might have been special, but the salmon was just average. I ordered the kasha pasta with veal meatballs with a side of roasted cauliflower topped with a fried egg. We also got a side of mushrooms. The pasta was hearty and interesting, though I thought it was over-sauced. The cauliflower was surprisingly cold. Maybe it was supposed to be served at room temp, but at that temperature, the egg is a little rubbery. We enjoyed the mushrooms most. The service is slow. By the time we got to dessert, we were there for nearly 2 hours. Desserts were fine: pumpkin creme brulee, surprisingly really cold; almond cake, which we liked. One quibble, my cappuccino came much earlier than the sweets, which meant I had almost finished it before the desserts came.We didn't dislike the restaurant; we just wanted to love it. It was a $200 (one beer) evening that we are unlikely to repeat unless someone else is buying and has reservations in the dining room.",0,0,0,Jeanne T.,"White Plains, NY",2,33,0
5.0,1/1/2016,"Came here for a New Year's Day slash early birthday lunch with the family. Had a great experience - and now it's become one of my favorite restaurants in the city.First off, the atmosphere of the place was so cute and rustic. There were delicate China plates with rose bouquets in mini glass vases on every table. There were also lovely tree vines and white chandeliers throughout the dining room. Decor was definitely on point!For appetizers, we ordered he crab aioli toast and the tuna sashimi. Both were delicious and very flavorful. The ginger sauce on the tuna sashimi was especially memorable. For my entree I ordered the mushroom and egg pizza. SO good. Only gripe is that the pizza became easily soggy since the crust was so thin. Flavor wise the pizza was excellent and I loved how there was an egg cracked over the top! My sister ordered a brunch item - the scrambled eggs with fried oysters. Really yummy as well, the oysters were incredibly soft and tender. Portion size was small however. My mom ordered the veggie burger, which was more like a falafel sandwich. Super flavorful as well. Dad ordered the hake, a new item on the menu. The sauce was delicious and surprisingly spicy. The fish was really nice and flaky.For dessert, I got the chocolate cake, which they so kindly decorated for my birthday. Super chocolatey with a lovely marshmallow-meringue frosting. My sister got the pumpkin creme brûlée which was excellent - the pomegranate sorbet on top tasted EXACTLY like pomegranate. It was a little on the sweeter side though. My dad, who isn't much of a dessert person, really enjoyed his trio of sorbets.Service was really really good. Our waiters were very attentive and provided us with a lot of information when we were indecisive about dishes.

Service is impeccable- friendly, gracious, young and fun. Aesthetic is unique and fresh. I have been here twice, the first time was a 5 star experience for my food, the second was a 4 star. The problems the 2nd time around was the mushroom pizza with the egg was not hot enough to cook the egg sitting on it and just became very soggy in the middle, pretty unappetizing. The sashimi was out of this world good. The roasted carrot avocado salad is perfection. The chicken my husband got was fatty but tasted very good. Had I ordered the ricotta ravioli instead of the pizza I think I would've rated my second time a 5 stars too, therefore 5 stars overall. The salted caramel dessert was okay, nothing special, it needed more peanuts for my liking. The drinks and wine selection are very good.

5.0,12/30/2015,"Though this review is extremely delayed, I am writing it purely because I still talk about the meal I had here in July of this past summer. My friend and I wanted to try something new in the city after work. So, on a Thursday night, dinner time, we ventured to ABC Kitchen to see what all of the hype was about. The decor of this restaurant alone is amazing- I can't even begin to describe it, but it was very whimsical and intriguing, however did not take away from the meal itself at all. My friend and I have very similar tastes when it comes to the food we like, so we wanted to split most plates that we ordered. We ordered the pretzel calamari and roasted carrot salad as appetizers. The calamari came with two sauces, and the calamari was done just right. The carrots in the salad were cooked to perfection and were extremely tasty. As I had said, my friend and I had wanted to split the entrees we ordered: the fried chicken and cheeseburger. Our waitress had the kitchen pre-split our dishes, so we each got our own plate with half of the main dish on it. We were so happy they did this! The chicken was out of this world- fried chicken is not something I usually go out and order, but since we were splitting it, I decided to give it a try... and I'm SO glad I did. The sauce it was in was not too buttery and had a definite kick to it, which I liked because I enjoy spicy food. The cheeseburger was also amazing, and they even gave us each our own ketchup and french fries. It's safe to say that we both finished every last crumb of our food. And how could we leave without getting dessert? Our social media ""research"" of ABC Kitchen showed us that the salted caramel sundae would be the winner for dessert. Again, AMAZING! Though ABC Kitchen is on the pricer side (and I was an unpaid intern at the time of dining), this is a meal I tell everyone about, especially for its service, ambiance, and of course, food.

Their food is organic and they have a vegetable garden on the rooftop of their building and there's nothing I appreciate more than food that is treated properly. While there, our waiter was very attentive and professional and so was the rest of the staff that we came into contact with. There was the traditional complimentary bread served with a side of olive oil and I added some sea salt to it which I recommend doing. For an appetizer we got the calamari which came dressed like a pretzel and came with marina sauce and musters aioli. The mustard aioli really brought the pretzel idea to life. For my main course, I had the kasha and bow tie pasta which came with veal meatballs. Honestly it's been a year since I've eaten it but I still think about it all the time! Amazing, the sauce was a brown sauce which was sweet and came with this little round nuts that gave the pasta an nice crunch and the veal meatballs melted in my mouth. I highly recommend getting this pasta. Very wonderful. For dessert I had ice cream and sorbet and when getting this you get to choose three flavors. Great restaurant!

We made our reservations two weeks in advance, so we were able to get in. It was the girlfriend's birthday so we decided to go all out and we definitely didn't leave disappointed. To start, we were read the specials by the single worst waiter I've ever had, which was nice. Somehow he took five minutes to read a list of specials that included several items over $100, which was to be honest a serious misread of the night's budget.We went with three appetizers and a main course. As is tradition, we started with the Kabocha squash toast, and that's when I learned that Kabocha is a type of squash. It might have been the best toast I've ever had, so really good first impression, Kabocha. 10/10. We also got the carrot and avocado salad, which was crazy good but was still the worst thing we got. Maybe an 8?The the other stuff started coming out. We got the crab toast (we like toast apparently) and it was also delightful. It was a little surprising that it was cold, but that took away the urgency of eating it quickly while one of my favorite pizzas ever was sitting there hot. That mushroom pizza. It was awesome. The combination of mushrooms and cheese and that great crust was perfect. Totally didn't come in expecting to eat a top 10 pizza, but when life throws you a curveball, at least you get a great pizza out of it. Finally, the cherry on top of the metaphorical sundae was an actual sundae. It was MASSIVE. Like six scoops of ice cream, caramel popcorn, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, just...wow. It was perfect for five people, which would be nice except there were two of us. We left on the full side of too full, but that's ok, it was delicious. All around great meal.

She got short and snippy when I asked her to repeat the times and told me that I should just go online and make the reservation there instead. I was shocked. I replied to her rude attitude with ""....ok?"" And she followed up with ""ok."" And hung up. It's her job to help the customers and when I did go online after she rudely cut me off and hung up I found much fewer options listed than she had previously given me.

But again, the expectations were high and the restaurant fell one star short of 5* because the flavors were typical. Nothing wrong with that if you are not used to this Californian cuisine (fresh seasonal ingredients). I can find in San Francisco anytime; ie.

4.0,12/10/2015,"ABC Kitchen is the popular farm-to-table concept in Jean-Georges Vongerichten's empire. It's surprisingly hard to get a prime time reservation here even months in advance so do plan ahead if you want to visit. Otherwise I've also had luck last minute.First things first - I love the inside of this restaurant and the space is surprisingly bigger than it looks from the outside. There's a bar / standing area when you first walk in, followed by the dining room, then a space in the back with an upstairs (never sat in this area). The design is what I can only describe as rustic-chic (is that a thing?) - the wooden tables and wildflowers are balanced by elegant chandeliers and glassware.While the food is always solid, I don't think I've ever been blown away. The pizzas are always a highlight (especially the mushroom one!), but the pastas fall short compared to other true Italian joints in the city. The entrees are good but again - nothing that has stood out and made me reminisce weeks later. A plus in my books is that if you like to order family style, they'll split portions for you in the kitchen and bring out 2 half-portion plates for you.",1,0,0,Michelle W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",92,167,79
3.0,12/9/2015,"Too much hype.The decor is beautiful, let's get that out of the way first. The loudness is to be expected of trendy restaurants. Service from our main waiter was nonchalant but the other waiter was super nice and attentive, however, they have many different people coming by with either your drinks or food.The appetizer portions are large so SHARE! Especially since for parties of two, they pre-split the plates for you. We started out with the crab toast (YUM! and a must) and the kale salad. The salad was literally a plate of greens with a few mini croutons, so really depends if you love kale or not. For entrees, my friend ordered the lobster which was good. I ordered their famous fried chicken. The batter is really good, it's nice and light. The problem with this dish? The dark meat portion of the chicken was undercooked! The server that picked up my dish tried saying that the chicken is pre-brined so can be a bit pink, which I get, but this was way too soft to have been cooked all the way. While waiting for a new chicken, they brought me a squash and ricotta toast drizzled with honey. It's good but pretty sweet. Second piece of chicken was white meat so was cooked fine.BEST PART of meal was the dessert. We completely overlooked the creme brûlée option because so many people talked about their sundae, but so glad the second server suggested it! Pumpkin spice creme brûlée with pomegranate seeds and pomegranate sorbet. Two favors you'd never think would work but was amazing!OVERALL, I wouldn't go back unless everyone else in my party really really really wanted to.

The hake entree was excellent. It came with crispy potatoes and a sauce I'm still dreaming about. the sundae for dessert was amazing, although I could have done without the popcorn on top.

Thursday night, 6:30PM for 2 people.We made reservation 1 month earlier for the birthday dinner.---Environment---*Dining area:The decoration and ambiance of main area was beautiful and great, HOWEVER,  they sat us in the back bar area, which was a passage between ABC Kitchen, ABC Cocina, and abcmkt. It had no decoration at all. While we ate, some people were walking on the stairs above us (we were eating under the edge of stairs. I felt some dust were falling into our dishes from it...). The customers of abcmkt also randomly walked to our area and peaked into our dishes. I felt really uncomfortable about it. I understand they didn't want to waste the space and put more tables to make money, but they should probably make it only for the bar guests, not the customers who have the full dinner.*BathroomThe M/W I went was gross. Bed smell, pee on toilet seat, and toilet paper all over the floor!!---Food---*Lentil Soup: Very good. Hearty and flavorful.*Fried Calamari: ok and not memorable.*Salmon: ok and not memerable. *Red Snapper: Fish was cooked to right. Crispy skin and tender meat. However, there was too much spinach on the side. It made the dish unbalanced on both flavor and presentation.*Sundae: good idea to put salted caramel ice cream and popcorn together. It was tasty but it got very sweet at the end. The portion was big, so it's ideal to share it between 2-3 people.---Service---The staff were friendly. However, they were not attentive. It might be a busy night, so our waiter disappeared for a while time to time when we needed him. We waited for 20 mins to order dessert and 30 mins to get the bill. Some of the serving ways were also odd. Most of our dishes were dropped without any words. No greeting (we were still in the middle of conversation), no explaining, no ""bon appetit"". They just came and left like we were air...If you ask questions, they would answer politely. But it was really awkward.I've been to many high-end or Michelin starred restaurants. By the dining experience tonight, I don't think ABC Kitchen deserved Michelin 3 stars. Foods were good but not excellent, and the service, back bar area, and bathroom were not on the level.

I don't know if they are able to schedule reservations down to the minute, but I was impressed. The service was good and caring. The pork confit was good.To be improved: Like most restaurants in NYC, there is not enough light and the room was incredible noisy. For a meal consisting of 2 entrées, one dessert and tap water we paid more than 100$ plus tipping. My gf's dish was some fish on spicy sauce with potatoes and I wasn't convinced.

2.0,11/15/2015,"Food Review only.Party of 6, Wednesday night 10pm.The time might have something to do with the food quality.1. Fried Chicken - Breast and thigh portion. Breast was extremely dry. Thigh was decent. The ""breading"" is more similar to the one at Perry Street. Lacy and crispy, however the crispiness wasn't consistent throughout the whole filet. Mildly spicy, no other flavors coming through except spice. 2. Pork Belly - sweet. The confit was one note, and the pork wasn't as tender. The overall dish tasted like one sweet mess. 3. Sea bass - they completely wrecked this one. We had to send it back to the kitchen. Overcooked, high on the spice again without any other flavor coming through. 4. Veal pasta - sweet. Like boyardee.5. Squash salad - this was one surprising dish. The mellow flavors of the squash worked really well with the hint of shaved cheese. Pleasant, refreshing, kind of different. 6. Roast carrot and avocado salad - the carrots were definitely packed with flavor and aromas, pretty great dish overall. The textural balance was there and the avocado and citrus cut through the sharpness of the carrots nicely. 7. sweet onion, prosciutto, arugula pizza - classic. never a miss. sweet and salty with textural components.Advice: stay clear from the entrees unless this was an off night. The highlights were definitely the appetizers which were more focused in flavor and texture and seemingly had great concepts driving each one. The entrees seemed more like practice, unrefined, and definitely disastrous technique wise. If I would go back, I would treat this as a tapas place and just order plates from the apps.

We stood at the bar and yep- you can order food standing at the bar. It's not the most comfortable way to dine- but coming from DC and Chicago, we were eager to try this place for it's Michelin star and taste the french inspired food from Jean-Georges. The drink menu was expensive- but the Cabernet from Beckman Vineyards was heavy and perfect. It lasted me throughout my entire meal. For food, we ordered the tuna sashimi and don't be fooled- it was the best tasting sashimi i've ever had. It was so fresh, so tender, so wonderfully flavored, had a kick of ginger along with the soothing ingredients of mint that it was fully marinated in. We also ordered a small veal meatball pasta dish. The veal was so cooked so lightly it broke easily when I gave it a little pinch with the fork. The bowtie pasta tasted healthy and fresh and the organic. The farm to table experience spoke. The menu itself is outstanding. So many flavors to chose from all creatively listed. As far as the ambiance- brilliant. The dark lit room with rustic tables and small candlelights made you feel like you were in an outdoor brought inside wedding reception room. The wait staff is wearing plaid shirts and are very professional. Don't leave without ordering the sundae with salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts & popcorn, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce for 14 dollars. This dessert put me in heaven.

Was just all right.- Salmon- nice touch with sunflower? pumpkin? seeds on top of the fish. Green apple purée is refreshing, but beware of the spaghetti squash because it has a lot of ginger in it!- Halibut- best fish of the night. The crispy potatoes & sauce it came with were delicious!* Back to the kombucha squash toast!! This was my favorite dish by far. The squash and ricotta is a wonderful collab of sweet and savory, with the apple cider vinegar adding a tangy touch, which all come together to form perfection on a toast.

As far as service was concerned, we had multiple servers come tend to our table, and everyone was cordial. The food was great overall. We ordered the Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli and Wood Oven Roasted Maine Lobster with Oregano and Lemon-Chili Vinaigrette. Both were delicious. The ingredients tasted fresh and everything complemented each other nicely. We were wishing the portions were bigger! My friend got a glass of Grapefruit Juice, which was also really good.

4.0,11/10/2015,"This night did not start off well, but it did end well. First off, we were 15-20 minutes late for our reservation. The hostess asked if the kitchen was closed, and they decided to let us in, but our first (male) server was very surly about it. I appreciated that they were going to stay open for us (and was planning on tipping accordingly), but that's no excuse for a bad attitude. Maybe it was because it was the end of his shift, but we were given a second server and she was very nice. So the night started to turn around. We ate some delicious appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I have to say that the appetizers and desserts stole the show. The entrees were solid, but ABC Kitchen really shines in the first and third courses. As many people have mentioned, the crab toast is simply amazing and worth your cheat meal. As far as desserts, I think we tried at least four of them and they were all excellent, so you can't go wrong with any of your choices.",0,0,0,Jaclyn O.,"Houston, TX",42,53,8
5.0,11/10/2015,"With reservations at 11am, my friend and I were greeted with a line halfway to the corner because the restaurant doesn't open until 11 on the dot. Once let in, we were quickly led to our seats. Pictures don't do the space justice; it's beautiful with lots of rustic wooden pieces contrasted with metallic accents. We started with some cocktails; my friend ordered a green apple mimosa while I got the ginger margarita. They were perfect morning cocktails with fresh and fragrant flavors. As an appetizer, we ordered the crab toast. Then I decided on the highly-raved roasted carrot and avocado salad, and she got the mushroom egg pizza. The roasted carrots were among the best of the vegetable I've tasted, and the dressing was a crisp citrusy vinaigrette that perfectly cut the creamy avocado. I had a bite of my friend's pizza, which was very rich with a béchamel cheese sauce on it, but the mushrooms tasted so fresh! Unfortunately our crab toast didn't come until the middle of our meal. Luckily I got a salad and was able to enjoy (though my friend was stuffed from her pizza and only had 1 piece). The cool crab and lemon aioli were a perfect flavor combination. All of the bread - the crab toast, the complimentary bread basket, and my salad croutons - were all incredible and very flavorful.",1,0,0,Victoria L.,"Philadelphia, PA",97,404,23

Food was below my expectation.  Veal meatball with ribbon pasta was too salty. However, I do like the after taste of the sauce. You can never go wrong with fried calamari. I do like the 2 different kind of dipping sauce. Crab toast was just chunk of minced crabs that tossed on top of the over toasted bread but I do like the aoli. Although the service and food were below my expectation, we still tipped her 20% after taxed  but we will not return. Dissapointed with Jean Georges establishment again and qgain.

4.0,11/1/2015,"I have been dying to come here for so long so when I was finally able to get a reservation I did not think twice. (Seriously it's hard to get a reservation here without a lot of advanced notice so prepare accordingly). The ABC home good store on the top levels is really great to peruse if you happen to be early/in the area. It's absurdly expensive but they have some amazing products and decor and I really love that they use really stylish homey stuff to decorate the restaurant. Now to the food. First off the drinks here are mad good. They know how to make a nice cocktail. We started off with the carrot and avocado salad, mushroom pizza, heirloom tomato toast and tuna sashimi. The carrot was much softer than I would have liked and didn't have that really nice sweetness that you expect of a roasted carrot. I was definitely disappointed with that. The other dishes were very good with the mushroom pizza being my favorite. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken for his main course and he still doesn't shut up about it. He keeps asking if we can go back so he can get it again. I will say it was very good but much too spicy for me (if spice isn't your thing, this is not the fried chicken for you). I was less enthused with my cod. It was pretty bland. I think I chose the worst thing at the table though. The desserts were good too, I would recommend the popcorn sundae. This place definitely has its hits and for the most part the food was flavorful and well prepared but it was a little underwhelming for me.",0,0,0,Sami F.,"Manhattan, NY",526,179,281

5.0,10/25/2015,"ABC Kitchen oozes ambiance. The minute you step inside, you will melt into the rustic elegance. This place is BIG! I think it's a block long, we came in one door and I think the back door let out to a different street, there's also an eclectic furniture store attached. As I mentioned, the decor is rustic, the white tables and chairs French country, the lighting romantic, the food solid, the wine divine. Oh the lighting is magical...even more so after two glasses of wine...bare light bulbs hanging from the ceiling...candles on the tables. Bring your date here, bring your girlfriends here, have your next big event here (fantastic venue space!)...but do make reservations! We came in right at 5:30 when they open and snagged a walk-in table. Reservations here are hard to come by and need to be made well in advance.Now the wine...I had the most delightful cabernet sauvignon here. I loved it so much I searched online until I found the only wine/liquor store in Manhattan that sells it. The only underwhelming part of my experience at ABC was the food. I ordered the sea bass, which was disappointingly small for the price. It was well cooked but swimming in a bowl of bland broth. I tried pieces from my friend's charcuterie board and was equally unimpressed. Maybe we ordered wrong. If I were to rate the food only, I'd give it 4 stars (being generous). The dessert, however, saved the day! You MUST get the sundae with salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts & popcorn, whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Don't leave without ordering this, it's what they do right. Service was satisfactory, though distant, not overly friendly or warm. Very pricey.

5.0,10/18/2015,"Came here for a weekend brunch made ~ 3 weeks in advance (you will definitely need to do so if you're trying to dine at a normal time). One member of our party arrived about 20 minutes late, but we were seated immediately upon their arrival (I think they definitely factor this in when accepting reservations).Ambiance: phenomenal. The restaurant can be accessed through the furniture store, and the interior was decorated in a shabby-chic, almost-farmhouse style (think exposed pipes and wood ceiling, simple metal chairs, etc). Waiters are dressed in flannel and skinny jeans. It worked. Drinks: I had some sort of whiskey-based cocktail that balanced the sweetness of the rest of my meal. However, the whiskey was lightened enough by other aspects of the drink so that it still felt/tasted appropriate for brunch. Food:Crab Toast: it's as amazing as everyone raves. There was lots of juicy crab on a toast that somehow managed to balance enough satisfying crunch with a chewiness that prevented crumbs/mess. The small dollop of lemon aioli on top added just the right amount of creaminess. The balance was perfect; there was just enough crab flavor. Would go back just for this.Shaved Raw Fluke: definitely so-so. Obviously the quality of the fish was great, but I personally found the dish too lemon-y and oily. I also thought the dill and chilies were a bit overpowering - they were all that I could taste.French Toast with Caramelized Apples: I'm not even a French toast person and I found this delicious. The brioche was doughy but had enough air/fluff (so it wasn't undercooked or sticky). The glaze was just sweet enough. I expected more apples but it wasn't a big deal.Dessert: Almond Cake with Poached Pears and Green Apple Sorbet: try to save room here for dessert if you can. This wasn't airy, but was still light. The top had some crumble that added nice texture. The green apple sorbet was a little too tart for my liking but I'd still recommend this.Service: impeccable, as expected.

They spiced it up nicely.Drinks: I got a Moscow Mule and it was pretty good. Normally served in a copper cup to enhance the flavor I'm told, but theirs in served in a normal glass.

It took a while for us to get service, both for preliminary drinks and for food, but when our server was around he was very friendly and offered great recommendations to my family members. My reasons for knocking a few stars is that i (annoyingly) have celiac disease and so need to be extra careful about my gluten allergy. The server didn't seem to know whic items were gluten free (which is fine, it can be a lot to remember!) so I asked him to check on a few things before ordering. Then these things I asked him to check on simply came out with the rest of our food. When i asked a runner if an item was gluten free he said ""ummmmm yes?"" i asked ""are you sure"" and he said ""no. I can check.""

The dessert was pretty awesome too. The place lighting was subdued but it added to the ambience. Julienne was something - she was pleasant, always helpful, extremely attentive and unobtrusive.

The low key outdoor appearance can be deceiving...my advice? Make reservations or else your sure to have to wait at least 1 1/2hrs.I was so excited to try this place and moreover the signature courses. A bit disappointed that it did not live up to expectations, but surely worth a try. Started the night off with the crab toast. Super fresh and delicious with a kick. Only wish the bread wasn't as burnt...definitely get your own! 4/5 Second course, husband and I shared the Farm fresh wild mushroom pizza. Pretty good as you can taste the delicious mushrooms, cheese and egg. A bit of a struggle being able to cut thru it though and definitely not the best crust I've had. I'd have to give it a 3/5Final course we shared the Organic Fried Chicken in Hot Butter Sauce. Wow! Explosion of flavors! Definitely have not tried anything like this before. To start off very impressed they already split the dish in half for us in separate plates. The chicken is not greasy at all, but instead super moist, crisp and delicious! Must order!! The sauce was interesting, and the greens...wish I had a better knife to cut thru them more easily. Overall I'd give this dish a 4.5/5 I'd give this place a try, definitely for the crab toast and organic fried chicken at least. Service was great as well.

It's a bit rich for a lunch dessert.)The service is up and down. Our busser poured water all over our table and kept unnecessarily rearranging dishes.

The deserts are great and good portion sizes. The ice cream is a tad bit eggy! I don't like that after taste. Love love the chocolate cake and the sundae. The addition of popcorn is scrumptious. The almond cake in itself is good. The accompanying compote is very tart.Their newer restaurant ABC Cocina is much much nicer & my favorite place to go now.,2,0,0,Shruti K.,"Brooklyn, NY",149,179,152
2.0,9/29/2015,"For such a highly-rated spot, I expected so much more. There was not one thing that stood out. Had calamari to start, which was unremarkable. Main dish was the snapper with chile and herbs. An okay portion of fish on some greens. It was not bad, but nowhere close to the culinary greatness I was hoping. The sundae was pretty good, but it is just ice cream with popcorn. My expectations were too high. Oh, well.",0,0,0,Daniel K.,"Atlanta, GA",43,91,0

3.0,9/29/2015,"Reasons to come to ABC Kitchen:- Stunning decor: I mean, really. How can any place be so beautiful, so breathtaking, so deliciously, utterly DISTRESSED? (That's an interior decorating style, in case you're scratching your head.)- Fantastic mixology: Fresh ingredients, unique combinations, this is what NY mixology is all about. The Basil Lime Daiquiri with papagayo rum and fresh lime juice is a perfect example- Farm-to-table cuisine: The roasted portobello mushroom with celery leaves is like being served hors d'oeuvres by Mother Nature herself. The roasted cod with cauliflower, crushed herbs and lime is picture-perfect freshnessReasons not to come to ABC Kitchen:- The Happy Hour crowd: Prepare to be ogled by men (and some women). Prepare to be shouted down by your neighbors loudly discussing synergy and other corporate terms that have no relevance to you. Ear plugs and a proficiency in sign language are highly recommended if you are dining during these hours- The lackluster service: Perhaps fueled by the HH crowd, service is intermittent and not always the friendliest- Some menu duds: This isn't a place with a home run menu.

You also saw a celeb or two at their leisure.Now for the menu, they have a broad selection of wines with an sampling of choices for beers and speciality drinks. Their food menu is seasonal and featured market dishes, appetizers, pastas, main courses and sides. We split a bottle of Rose and I ordered the Lobster while my sister had the Fried Chicken. We split the fries and primed our course with the calamari appetizer. The food was worth he trip to Union Square and our walking it off after #fitbitonfleekWe were super impressed with the service and even more impressed with the serving size. I will probably make this place a city staple just so I can try more dishes! Phenomenal and very well lit with an excellent ambiance.

Some parts of the toast were a little too rough for my liking but plenty of crab on the top! Cheddar biscuits-yum! You don't really need butter or jelly in my opinion they taste good without it (they also charged extra for that). I got the turkey sandwich and it was very good. It was so fresh and everything they put on it came together really well. I got the jalapeño on the side-too hot for me. The fries that came with were good also. They had herbs, garlic and seasoning-yum! My bf absolutely loved the French toast! Looking at yelp pics I wasn't convinced it would be good but it really was delicious. I was also surprised by the portions. Pictures on Yelp definitely seemed like it was less food. I was more than satisfied. I felt like I was going to roll over. Drinks: I got a rum and coke and it was pretty good. Generally, I think their drinks are expensive but what else is new in NYC. Service: pretty quick service. Our waitress was a little strange. If I had to take a guess she is in theater. I'm not sure if our interactions were strange because we couldn't hear each other that well or what- but something was off.

5.0,9/18/2015,"I've been waiting a long time to eat here. They say its hard to get a reservation but I think its because they bake a lot of time into when you do make a reservation.

Service was excellent - warm and attentive without being over the top.Food was thoughtful and fresh, but seemed rather overpriced for the portions. The stand-outs were the crab toast, the mushroom pizza with a farm egg (I think I started giggling uncontrollably from joy with this one - it was quite good), and the carrot avocado salad. Less interesting were the tuna sashimi (marinade was a bit on the sour/lime side, not enough of the soy ginger) and the biscuits (the cheddar did not come through). I also did like the mustard-y dressed summer beans with hazelnuts available as a side. For some reason the entrees did not really tempt.

Comes dinner time, and at ten thirty we managed to still have no reservation. I made a res on OpenTable for eleven and voilà !! There it was, super easy. We were greeted at the door by a friendly set of host, one of which walked us to table 54. The table is located in the middle of the dinning room towards the wall, which allowed us to take in the fabulous decor. My boyfriend loved the food! It was a bit late for me to eat, but we returned that Saturday for brunch !!! Oh, I love me some brunch! Everything was fantastic. Needless to say my boyfriend wants to return again.  Oh well Denise girl, slow down! What'd you have?That's a great question! Besides waffles and French toast, I am a die-hard fan of fried calamari! Hence we indulged in pretzel dusted calamari as an app. And of course crab toast with lemon aioli. YUM! For my guac lovers ! Someone said avocado ?!

5.0,9/6/2015,"I'll add to the rave reviews - this is my all time favourite restaurant in NYC. I've eaten here 5-6 times, and every time I walk away satisfied. The food is just excellent, everything has that farm to table, ethical and sustainable feel, but with Jean Georges at the helm it's also inventive with lots of unique flavour combinations and ingredients. Every time I've been we always order lots of small plates to share, 4-5 between 3 people is plenty of food. My all time favourites are the roast carrot and avocado salad, pizza with the egg (not the official name), crab toast and the salted caramel popcorn sundae (a must order).The interior is just gorgeous - it's attached to ABC Home which is like an upscale Anthropologie, so everything is quirky, pretty and has plenty of character. The plates are all mismatched on purpose, for instance, and the lighting is just so damn flattering. You feel like you're eating in a really really posh friend's gorgeous home. It's not too pricey, either. Last time I went with my mom and friend, and between the three of us we ordered three small plates, a pizza and side of fries. It was about $75 in total, which we all agreed was beyond reasonable for the ambience, quality of ingredients and NYC. I really like the staff too, and their uniforms are so cute - checkered shirts and skinny jeans. The only problem is it can be tough to get a reservation, so I recommend going during an off time (like for a late lunch on Saturday at like 3 pm) or when they open at 5:30 pm as a walk in.

5.0,9/3/2015,"Definitely a place for a special occasion. Not because it's fancy (although it sort of is), but because it's just that good. Also you pretty much need to book a reservation at least a month out if you want to dine at a decent timeABC Kitchen, like the ABC furniture store, is beautiful and aesthetically pleasing. Sort of rustic modern homey decor. We sat in the area where the bar is, outside the main dining room. I actually preferred it because it was less dark and quieter. Except for the large table where a family was apparently taking their kids out for a ""casual"" dinner (Can I be in that family?).We ordered the following:1) Crab Toast - This is apparently a must-order item. After tasting the fresh chunks of crab with lemon aioli on toasted thick cut bread, I definitely agree.2) Shaved Raw Fluke - Nice presentation, and the fluke was very fresh. The olives, chilies, and dill gave it a salty sour combination that was odd, but grew on me the more I ate it.3) Roasted Halibut - While I like halibut and this was one of the better halibut dishes, it paled in comparison to the pork. It did make for a nice light summer dish with the vegetables and basil. Still, next time I'd probably choose another entree on the menu.4) Crispy Pork Confit - Was there any doubt that this dish wouldn't be excellent? It came with smoked bacon cherry marmalade and braised turnips. The pork was so incredibly delicious.

For appetizers I would definitely recommend the crab aioli toast because it was seasoned beautifully. We also shared the tuna sashimi drowned in a succulent ginger sauce. And to continue my seafood extravaganza, I ordered the black sea bass with herbes and chile with a bed of tomatoes and greens. Everything was light, refreshing, and well crafted. The chef knows how to enhance the beauty and taste of simple foods. The prices were a bit $$$ but if you have it, spend it here. You're guaranteed a modern not at all snobby NYC dining experience.

Now the food-- we ordered a lot of food for two people. -Raw Nantucket Bay Scallop- fresh and melts in your mouth (i'm not a huge fan of scallops but these left me wanting more)-Tomato toast- I'm not sure if this is on the menu but it was a compliment from the chef. the tomatoes were sliced thinly and drizzled with olive oil and some spices. Simple but delicious!-Green beans with hazelnuts- another one that i'm not sure if i saw on the menu but it was excellent. the hazelnuts gave a nice crunch and the green beans were firm and tender-Spring Onion Baked Prosciutto Pizza- AMAZING! I came with high expectations for the pizza and it was above and beyond. i think it has bbq sauce instead of tomato sauce which went really well with the onions, arugula, and prosciutto. also loved the thin, buttery crust!-Red Snapper- i only had a bite of this because i'm not a huge fan of fish. it was good but probably not something i would order for myself.-Akaushi Cheeseburger- by the time this came out, I was rather full but overall very flavorful and unique flavor from the herbed mayo-Basil Panna Cotta- my friend ordered this and devoured it. i took a bite but the basil was a little too strong for me to enjoy as a dessert-Salted Caramel Ice Cream Sundae- after reading all the awesome reviews about this dessert, i had to get it.... and the hype is real. the ice cream has a particular salted caramel flavor, not like the artificial, overly-sweet ice cream. the popcorn gives a nice crunch and adds a little more sweetness to the over all concoction.

5.0,8/20/2015,"1800 Yelpers can't be wrong, right?ABC Kitchen is a treat. I came here to celebrate my birthday and I can tell you that all the positive reviews are right on the mark. The atmosphere is amazing. We sat in the back room that connects ABC Kitchen, Cocina and the ABC Home. There was this tree structure reaching toward the ceiling, a rustic chandelier, and many strings of light leading to the upstairs of ABC Home. Lovely all around.Our waiter was great, and spot on with most of his recommendations.For starters, we had the famed crab toast with lemon aioli. It was a slice of rye cut in four with generous heapings of crab chunks on top. I can definitely understand the hype.Next, we had the shaved raw fluke with crushed ollives, dill and chillies. The fluke itself was okay, but combining all the sauces and flavors really made the whole better than the sum of its parts. Nice saltiness and spiciness.For mains, we shared two. The roasted halibut and the crispy pork confit. They split the pork confit across two plates, which was nice. I still think about that pork dish from time to time, like a forlorn lover. The skin on the pork was incredibly crispy, the bacon marmalade added a smoky and sweet flavor, and the braised turnips were actuall from root all the way to stem.The halibut, however, was just okay. It was served over crushed tomatoes, and had julienned squash. The best part was probably the fresh basil, but at $34, I'd skip it.For cocktails, I had the Vermont gold vodka thyme lemonade, which tasted like summer. Nice and refreshing.Reservations are hard to come by (at least at a reasonable time), so definitely plan ahead! Like... a month ahead.",1,1,1,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",884,3337,12015
5.0,8/18/2015,"What a lovely experience! My wife and I appreciate forward-thinking kitchens as much as we do a refined, chic ambiance; ABC hit the mark on both. I surprised my wife to celebrate her birthday after we both got off work  -- and also to celebrate her hustle, as she's seven months pregnant with our first and still working a 10-hour day. THE AMBIANCE: We arrived a couple minutes early and absorbed the atmosphere while they seated us. I'm a fan of architecture, design, art, and minimalism, all of which are seamlessly on display. Everything was pristine: white, off white, and wooden decor, recessed lighting by way of thin industrial bulbs hanging throughout the space, modern chandeliers that looked of porcelain, beautiful photography, floral plating, and fresh flowers and candles on each table. THE SERVICE: Our primary server was down to earth, casual, and extremely knowledgable. He explained the dishes perfectly, offered good recommendations, smiled the entire time, and never came off as pretentious. Other waiters kept our cups of water topped off without us even noticing. THE FOOD: Impeccable! We shared everything, as we always do. For drinks, my wife ordered the basil and lime house-made soda, and I ordered a fresh-pressed coconut water. Both were so refreshing on this hot day! We started with the crab toast, which was very tasty; crab was flavorful and highlighted by the lemons that came with it, and the bread was part crunchy, part soft and tasted of olive oil. Then came the kasha bowtie pasta with veal meatballs; it was cooked in a sweet onion reduction, with a lot of depth and heartiness, and had an almost Middle Eastern flare. The meatballs were the most memorable part of this dish, as they were delicate, flavorful, and made with such finesse. Next came the spinach + goat cheese pizza with lemon drizzle...My goodness! Dish of the evening. I told my wife I'd ""go to war for this pizza."" Finally the red snapper, which came swimming in an earthy broth over sautéed spinach and lemony fingerling potatoes, and garnished with some sort of sweet, tangy citrus that made every bite explode. We discussed the food the entire time.To top it off, they accounted for the note I left in my reservation and brought out a surprise birthday cupcake with a candle for my wife, who was ecstatic! This was our first Jean-Georges restaurant, and granted it wasn't his namesake Michelin-starred establishment, but it was still a beautiful experience nonetheless. Can't wait for more.",0,0,0,Ahmad A.,"Chicago, IL",8,30,13
5.0,8/18/2015,"My #1 favorite restaurant in NYC.  The decor is what I would call country chic - the china is floral and makes you feel right at home.  Farm to table cuisine is their mantra, and the food is fresh and tasty.  My favorite starters are the carrot and avocado salad (roasted carrots, avocado with a spicy kick to the dressing) and the beets (served with a tart yogurt sauce).  The pizza is amazing and not to be missed.  But the real stand out is the dessert.  The salted caramel sundae with hot fudge and popcorn is literally the best dessert in Manhattan (and accordingly has been rated as such).  Only complaint?  It's virtually impossible to get a dinner reservation.",1,0,2,Jules S.,"Manhattan, NY",67,176,1
4.0,8/17/2015,"This place promotes itself as organic. I would agree that the entire menu felt and tasted healthy.The ambiance was great. It was dark with the hanging lightbulb look, but it also had a more lighted area, where we sat. The menu paper is made from 100% post consumer material.  I really like that.The food came out as it was prepared. We had:Drinks: strawberry soda and lemon thyme soda.  My girlfriend had the strawberry soda. she liked it. The lemon thyme soda had the sugar on the rim. In hindsight, I should have drank the soda, then filled it with water and drank off the rim. Either way, it was really fantastic.Appetizer: Crab toast with lemon aioli: this was really delicious, every bite. the sauce was good. Not too strong, not too light where the crab takes over. The bread it was on was a good texture. not too hard and crunchy, but wouldn't fall apart on you. Entree: kasha and bowtie pasta, veal meatballs- the dish had a unique taste to it. If you know Korean food, it hinted of jjajjangmyun. The flavor was good, but there was something missing in the pulling together of the whole dish. I like strong flavors, but this wasn't as strong.Appetizer: house made Chicken and pork sausage with pistachio potatoes and whole grain mustard. The sausage was good. Not too greasy like you would think when hearing sausage. It lacked that certain punch I was looking for, but definitely above par. Couldn't really make out the mustard when eating.  Wish they threw in a bit more jalapeno? peppers, they were not spicy, but flavorful for sure.Dessert: seasonal donuts with cafe latte.  there were three donuts: blueberry, strawberry jelly donut and a glazed with chocolate.  They weren't oily and too heavy.  The combination of a bite of the donut and chasing it with the latte was good.  The mug was unique as well.Overall impression:I enjoyed the Crab Toast with lemon aioli the most, could have had 2 in lieu of the other appetizer! The set up of the restaurant is very romantic and definitely date worthy.  I liked their utensils, the bowls, and mugs.  I would return.",0,0,0,Peter J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",34,243,119

5.0,8/15/2015,"Enjoyed a fantastic and memorable dinner with my girlfriend and her family. The ambience, food, cocktails, wine and service combined for a tremendous eveningAmbience: really enjoyed the laid back and casual atmosphere that included the wait staff donning plaid shirts and the diners dressing ""smart casual.""  The restaurant is decorated like its namesake - the abc furniture store - with both minimalist and contemporary leanings. It's a big space with a fair number of tables squeezed tightly together but the noise level or space were never issues. Food: we couldn't say enough good things about the food. I'd recommend ordering several small plates and appetizers to share and then ordering individual entrees that are healthily portioned but can be finished. The highlights included the mushroom pizza, heirloom tomato toast, tuna sashimi, and the carrot and avocado salad. The fish and vegetables were incredibly fresh and also excitingly seasoned and the mushroom pizza is a cant miss for the excellent combo of the mushrooms and Parmesan cheese. I ordered the fried chicken as my entree and could not have been happier. The portion is very generous - it's a half chicken that is deboned and perfectly fried and crispy. The chicken is flavorful alone but the spicy butter sauce is an amazing add to an already great centerpiece. The desserts were also excellent with the can't miss dessert being the caramel popcorn sundae. Drink: we all agreed that the cocktails were top notch and the wine list is smartly organized by type and flavor instead of the traditional region ordering. Service: the waitress was very knowledgeable about the food and offered smart suggestions for both food and drink. The food was brought out at perfect intervals and the service never felt intrusive nor rushed.

2.0,8/11/2015,"I went here for dinner this past Saturday at about 7 p.m.  When we called early in the afternoon for reservations, we were told they were booked but we could stop in.  We were seated within 40 minutes, but instead of at the mail dining room, we had a cocktail table.  From what we could see inside the main dining room, it looked very pretty.  Our awkward table and uncomfortable chairs aside, our server was a breath of fresh air.  Remy was very nice, professional and extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  We started with the crab toast and it was amazing.  We would go back just for that (and only that, unfortunately).  Our main dishes were fish and fried organic chicken.  Unfortunately, the restaurant was on the cold side and the fish stayed warm for only a couple of minutes.  My husband didn't enjoy the fish because of that.  He also said it lacked flavor.  My chicken would have been delicious without the odd fried topping and the chili in the sauce.  It was way too spicy and it ruined the dish.  The mashed potatoes, olives, and swiss chard were very good.  I wanted to order the vegetable side but Remy warned me there was chili on that too.  If you don't enjoy spicy food, be careful what you order.  Our drinks were average and we skipped dessert.  Overall, the food wasn't worth the price, especially the main dishes.  One star for Remy and one star for the whole organic, locally sourced, recycled furniture thing they have going on.",3,2,2,Anna B.,"Montclair, NJ",332,89,12

5.0,8/7/2015,"Seriously the best semi- fancy Resturant experience I have ever had, my best friend and I came around 7pm they said the wait would be any 1hour so we left because she didn't want to wait and instead she got Chipotle, so we got seated and I waited for her to finish her food. When we got back to the Resturant it was 8:00 the lady said the wait would be  45 minutes my friend didn't want to wait but she knew I really wanted to eat here so we waited. You have to stand no seating or waiting area. Anyways we got seated early at the bar 8:20 to be exact I guess if we wanted a table we would have had to wait longer. We got seated at  the bar my friend didn't want anything since she had just finish eating chipotle but I told her she could try some of my food. The bartender gave us water which came in very small glasses and had small cardboard cut outs underneath as coasters the water was cold and she gave us the menu to look at. Then she gave us a sheet of I think paper and then a cloth, and silver wear. I ordered strawberry soda she made it right in front of me, came out of a squeeze bottle that looked like bbq sauce must have been the syrup to make it, tasted like fresh strawberries with a soda fizz. Then I asked the bartender if I could order my food. I ordered the crab toast which everyone raves about and the organic fried chicken with basil spinach underneath it  and hot sauce butter around it. The crab toast was AMAZING  before we even got it you could smell the crab it was cut into about 4 pieces it was oily or buttery I'm  not exactly sure but our hands were left greasy. A couple of minutes later I was waiting for my chicken it was taking a little longer to come, when it came I cut it in half to let my friend try she didn't like it but that's because she doesn't like fried things so I took it back I was not going to let her waste my chicken because once I got a bite of it, it was everything and more than I had hoped for I was starving and everything about that chicken tasted like heaven maybe because I haven't had fried chicken in a while IDK but it was everything the spicy butter sauce  complimented the bland spinach and kind of kept the heat down but I had water for that anyways. My bill in total came up to 59.88 the cheapest of the expensive restaurants I have had to pay for, the crab toast was $16, the chicken was 32 and then my soda was $7.00 I could be wrong I didn't see the cents behind the rest of the receipt I didn't look at it for too long.

My husband had the snapper, which he enjoyed, and I tried the house-made sausage special. Our daughter shared everything we had. Although the staff seemed apprehensive that we had a child with us, they warmed up to her and brought her some crayons. I got the impression that the staff expects children to misbehave, which is at best an unfortunate assumption and at worst a self-fulfilling prophecy.If you're near Union Square Park and are looking for a more upscale lunch experience, I would definitely recommend giving ABC Kitchen a try.

Probably the freshest food that I've had at almost any restaurant in New York - it literally tastes like it just came out of the garden. The decor is impeccable and everything about the look, feel, and taste is fantastic. However, the service was SO SLOW! Perhaps it was the day that we went, but our table's order got messed up, as well as the table next to ours. The waiters were gracious in fixing the issue and gave us additional veggie apps to make up for the slow service, but I was somewhat shocked by the execution of the dishes.Other than that, great meal and highly recommended. Here were the dishes:- Crab toast - it is everything the other reviews say it is! Lots of crab and great flavors. Really worth the price- Sugar snap pea salad - really on the dot. The peas were so crisp and quite large and the flavorings were rich without being heavy. Fresh and delicious. - Eggs benedict - one of my eggs came out fully cooked and it was immediately taken back and redone. Great hollandaise and I loved the home fries that went with it.- Scrambled eggs and crispy oysters - My personal favorite. The eggs are European style so more runny and almost cottage cheese like, but I absolutely loved it. The oysters added a great seafood and fishy taste to it, which I loved.

4.0,7/20/2015,Went here a few years ago when it first opened when Dan Kluger was still at the helm. Market appetizers are very tasty. The Striped Bass ( I know I know finger wags for eating bass - in my defense it was a few years ago) is flaky slightly spicy and acidic. I've heard that since Kluger's departure things have dipped a bit - on the plus side maybe now it will be possible to get a table impromptu. It's a great date spot as the scenery has a certain dreaminess to it. The service is attentive while being casual. If they stole a page from Perla's book and found a realistic way to reduce the prices this place would be an undeniable gem - but either way it's a nice place to try so long as you curb your expectations. If you can get a rare same day seat - go for it but certainly do not book far in advance for a mind altering experience because that's not what this is.,0,0,0,Yoni Z.,"New York, NY",1,86,0

5.0,7/13/2015,"I came here with friends.  Great vibe.The hostess was especially gracious since we were 30 minutes late for our reservation, but once we entered the space we were transported to an ultra-hip experience. I thought they did especially well with vegetables. The servers wearing flannel shirts was a bit much for me, but I get it.Apps- Portabello mushroom - maybe a highlight, this was perfectly seared and infused with a celery sauce. Rich and tasty- Avocado salad over micro greens - despite the strange gargantuan fried croutons, which everyone avoided, a good example of the fresh greens at this Kitchen- Meat and cheese board - cheeses were local from the Northeast and held their own against the more interesting charcuterie selections. The bread was a hearty multigrain variety, which my European guests did not appreciate as much as they would have a crisp, thinly sliced baguette- Sweet peas - a seasonal dish, small portion, but served with a sweet sauce and some ""long hots,"" IIRC, in Philadelphia terminology. I liked the sweet and peppery component of the dishMains- Akaushi jalapeno burgers - Japanese beef was excellent, and somehow more flavorful than some ""kobe"" beef burgers I have tasted in the past. The sesame seed bun was like a super high end burger-king bun (sorry to paint that image in your mind), but it was good. The cheese, great, the jalapeños a bit overwhelming. The fries with which it was served were standout- Halibut - perfectly cooked and complemented nicely were tomatoes and summer squash- Salmon - over sugar snap peas and herbs, the sauce was wonderful and a touch sweet, while the fish itself, a 7-ounce portion, was good if not particularly spectacular. I could have done with a slightly more charred skin, as it was somewhat all oily over the sauceFor desserts we split the cookies (delectable), ice cream sundae (as good as pronounced), and fruit plate (sophisticated, tiny strawberries = super sweet!).",2,0,0,David D.,"Newtown, PA",186,374,2556
5.0,7/12/2015,"This place lives up to all it's hype. Let me get right down to business. THE FRIED CHICKEN is AMAZING. It comes on top of collard greens in a hot sauce drawn butter. I will die for that chicken. But let me actually start from the beginning. During the Fall season, they have an appetizer called the Kaboucha Squash Toast that will blow your mind. It is one of the best things that I have ever tasted.  During the Spring, the ramp toast is also delicious, and all year round the crab toast is a sure bet.  The fluke also stands out for another small dish. The carrot avocado salad is nice and fresh, and those carrots are really special.  I had a glass of Sancere that was the perfect fit for these dishes. On to entrees. Like I said, the chicken. Next, the pork is amazing, and so is the lobster. Both are very, very good dishes. The mashed potatoes and the Brussels sprouts are nice sides to accompany these entrees. The Ricotta Ravioli is amazing. I've never had ravioli like that and neither has my super Italian friend that has had it the two times he's dined there. For dessert, the Caramel Sundae is a Jean-George's staple, and very good. My favorite dessert is the Almond Cake. Ohhhh the almond cake is so good.       The service here is top notch. God forbid my water glass should be empty must be a motto of theirs. The servers and backwaiters are very knowledgable, and the managers make sure that this place runs like a well oiled machine.

Many factors contribute to the "" feeling"" you have the hostess, server, even fellow dinners around you.  With ABC kitchen I am giving it 5 stars because of the feeling I had it was a true fun and memorable dining experience. I truly did not like my veggie burger ( too dry) but as tourists in New York we waited at the bar to be seated and sat next to a very talkative New York couple!

Apps: crab toast with lemon aioli: fresh, succulent, flavorful and excellent to share. I've ordered this several times.  Pretzel dusted calamari: TO DIE FOR! The pretzel crumbs transform the calamari by giving it a juicy, SMOKEY, flavor which is unlike any other calamari I've ever had.Roast carrot and avocado salad, crunchy seeds, sour cream and citrus: was nervous about having cooked carrot on a cold salad but it was fabulous; the seasoning perfectly blended with the citrus creating a wonderful mix of flavors Pastas: house made ricotta ravioli, herbs and tomato sauce--homemade pasta is ALWAYS worth getting Dessert: sundae with salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts and popcorn, whipped cream, chocolate sauce--I was hesitant at first because of the popcorn, but it blended well with the caramel like the chocolate sauce did with the nuts, very rich, so share it!It's a great restaurant to settle down at after a long day of walking around NYC, pre or post movie, catching up with friends, or a date.

4.0,7/9/2015,"Went into the ABC home store to check it out when we stumbled upon this restaurant. We ended up eating a late lunch/early dinner because we couldn't pass it up! I started with the roasted carrot and avocado salad and it was UNREAL. One of the best preparations of carrots I've ever heard. I told my family that I think I could eat it every day of my life. The avocado as perfectly ripe and the (pumpkin?) seeds added great texture. It also had watercress (I believe) and THE best croutons I've ever had. They were crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside, while they were also sopping up the amazing dressing (but maintaining their crunch). It was so wonderful I think I'll dram about it tonight.For my dinner, I had the veggie burger. I was not expecting it to be fried, so that was a disappointment. Overall, it didn't have the flavor profile I was looking for. If you really enjoy mint, it would be great slathered in the mint yogurt sauce, but as a non-mint eater I got it on the side. It just didn't do it for me! The rest of my family got pizza. My father got the asparagus and bacon one and basically said it was some of the best pizza he ever had. My mother said the crust was amazing (which means a lot coming from the avid crust lover she is).For dessert, we ordered the carrot cake and salted caramel sundae. The carrot cake was subpar and I would not was calories on it. On the other hand, the sundae was amazing. I was not actually the one to order it because it seemed boring to me. Sundaes, in my opinion, always need something like a cookie or brownie to hold it together. I was happily surprised to find that this sundae was amazing. The caramel popcorn added such a nice crunch and the peanuts at the bottom were a sort of brittle. They also didn't skimp on fudge! The ice cream itself was really delicious and smooth. When you get the perfect bite of peanut brittle, popcorn, fudge, and ice cream, it is just pure happiness in your mouth.The drinks were also really good too! I had the lime basil soda and really enjoyed it. I don't usually like very herby drinks, but the basil was subtle. My family said the wine selection was great, and my mother really enjoyed her rhubarb cocktail.Overall, a great experience at ABC kitchen!

I highly suggest to make a reservation for lunch or dinner because brunch is definitely not an area in which they shine. Perhaps we ordered the wrong dishes, but I shouldn't have to worry about that at such a highly noted restaurant. The french toast is not traditional and extremely custard-like. It was not appealing in the sense that it felt like an uncooked souffle hiding under a deep fried shell. Additionally, the buttermilk pancakes were simply dry, thin, and quite depressing to look at. However, the calamari, tuna sashimi, biscuits, and fries were delicious. The service and decor of the restaurant were also top notch. I liked how the location of the restaurant was low-key and frankly, like a whole in the wall.

2.0,6/4/2015,"How about some free-range and locally-sourced hospitality to go with the beautiful food and atmosphere?  I had an excellent lunch there last week, and was so pleased I brought another friend there on Sunday.  Yikes.  While the food was good, it would have been great if the (sublimely crispy) potatoes had been hot, and if the organic free-range eggs had not been so obviously sitting too long (film on top) as we waited and waited for our chronically wayward waiter....which brings up the big problem:  It seems that ABC Kitchen has not received the memo that the whole idea of treating guests like you can't be bothered doesn't ""play"" anymore.  Maybe there was a time when the ""rude waiter"" indicated clout (Reagan Era?),  and perhaps a few of the higher paid (read guiltier) CEO's in town still want/need a sound spanking with their brunch, but now, to the rest of us, you just look like jerks.  The hostesses could not have been less warm and inviting:  truly shocking.  Please please please ABC Kitchen, train your staff (front-of-house, too!) to be kind and helpful- not as if they are above it all.....perhaps remind them that they are in the ""Service Industry"".",0,1,0,Mary D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0

4.0,5/26/2015,"ABC Kitchen has a lot of hype around it, and it certainly did not disappoint. I made a reservation 2 weeks ahead of time and scored a 6 p.m. slot. When I called to change my reservation to a bigger party, they told me they were full, which was odd considering the restaurant was mostly empty when I arrived. Anyway, the decor is sophisticated, simplistic, and chic, albeit the door front a little raggedy. It's not my favorite in terms of ambience, but it is certainly unique and homey. The food was absolutely mouthwateringly delicious. My dad and I ordered the famous crab toasts and the fluke sashimi for starters. The crab toasts were unique, and the crab was super fresh - this is a must try! The cod was fresh, but I found the sauce a little overpowering. For entrees, I ordered the salmon, and my dad ordered the sea bass. The salmon, cooked medium rare, had crispy skin and a tender, tasty center accompanied by a tangy carrot sauce. The sea bass had hints of jalapeño flavors that added a special touch. We also ordered a mash potatoes to share, but that was meh. Our waiter noticed that we didn't touch the mash potatoes and took the dish off our check - great service! On the note of service, I appreciated the attentive but not over-the-top waiters. Our glasses were always filled and our tables and plates were always cleaned promptly.The check came out to be affordable considering the high quality food and service. We didn't order wine and dessert this time, but we received complimentary chocolate cake pops.

Chunks of sweet crab on a toast.  Simple citrus dressing. Roasted carrot and avocado salad was also great. Carrot was very sweet, but had spicy and citrus dressing. It was very filling for salad and very flavorful. I loved both of these small dishes, but was disappointed with the main course. We had Black Sea bass and the burger.

4.0,5/24/2015,I have wanted to go to ABC Kitchen for awhile. Jean George's casual spot so to speak attached to ABC Home. The place has gotten rave reviews both in Yelp and otherwise. I dropped in one Friday night and was told the wait was an hour but low and behold got seats at the bar in the back. Yes! The restaurant is absolutely beautiful - from he lighting to the big wood tables to be old worn steel - it's phenomenal. One of the more beautiful spaces I've been to. The service was also stellar - the waiters were dressed in plaid shirts of what seemed like their own choosing and then jeans. They were all highly knowledgeable and friendly - it was like you were with friends and they were a part of the environment rather than a separate entity. So how was the food...well...its a mixed bag. We got the following:- Crab Toast: Excellent with a heap of fresh peaky toe crab and crunchy toasted thick bread with a dollop of lemon aioli - yum- Black Sea Bass - so the flavor was good but I didn't like the skin. I mean the dish was tasty and the soup is nice to pour over the fish and spinach for more flavor but I just wasn't that impressed - Mozzarella /basil whole wheat pizza - also just ok. The sauce was very good and the pizza was well made but there is definitely better pizza in the city- Vodka Thyme Lemonade - great drink - highly recommended So our waiter actually had told us how good the burger was and the three Texans that had told him it was the best burger they had had...but we ignored him to our detriment. Additionally the oven roasted lobster looked amazing and the mushroom and egg pizza - but - we just didn't order them. I will definitely be back to order them and I'm sure this rating will go up but for now...this is what I got.,1,0,0,Bjorn P.,"New York, NY",22,675,682

3.0,5/15/2015,"ABC Kitchen has extreme diversity and change when it comes to their dishes, which I really like. There's so much to choose from, and you won't feel hungry afterwards. Their salmon is to die for, their pasta is delicious, and their desserts are out of this world. There's a great play on American food with hints and influences from other countries.

2.0,5/13/2015,"You know what? I'm over this place. I went here for dinner last week with my BF and our college-age niece and I was unimpressed. We ordered: chicken sausage, ricotta w rhubarb, mushroom toast, crab toast, a pizza, two ravioli orders & the fettucine, and a side of broccoli. All in all, it was a disappointment. The ricotta was just overrun by the rhubarb compote. The mushroom toast was lackluster. The sauce on the ravioli just does not compare with your local neighborhood go-to spot and my BF said the fettucine was just taken over by the lemon. Ah...and the pizza was also not good. Frankly, the pizza was an embarrassment for this calibre restaurant...never mind a city that prides itself on having good pizza. Oof and I almost forgot how unappealing the broccoli was. Who the heck puts mint on broccoli? I am adventurous and like to try new things but this just didn't work. In an effort to not bash everything, I will say that the crab toast was very good. So they have that going for them...Service-wise, our waiter practically disappeared between appetizers and entrees. I had to flag him down to get our entrees and the entrees must have been sitting ready for a while because a skin had developed on the sauce that came with the broccoli. The waitstaff responsible for water glasses was great though. I can't remember the last time I saw such attention paid to that and I did appreciate it. Waiter stunk though. I didn't even bother ordering dessert because a) I was not sure it would be any good and b) I really didn't feel like sitting around in there waiting for the waiter to get his act together. Not good. Not going back. With a name like Jean Georges and the price tag that goes along with it, we expected (and deserved) better.",1,0,0,Gir L.,"New York, NY",0,39,0

4.0,5/11/2015,"The restaurant had pretty good dishes (we had the fava bean puree, tomato ravioli (?), and mush room and egg pizza), but I didn't think any of them was particularly impressive.  I really enjoyed, however, the sundae with caramel pop corn at the end of dinner, which was probably the most delicious dessert I've had in new york city in a long time.  The decor was pretty exceptional, I would describe it as kind of barnhouse chic with some shabby chic but luxe fixures and flower arrangements.  Service was courteous, friendly and non-pushy.  One final comment is that it was very very loud when we went (saturday night around 10 pm) that it was hard to have a conversation.",0,0,0,Phyllis L.,"New York, NY",31,27,0

4.0,5/8/2015,"Can't believe it took me so long to come back to ABC Kitchen since my last visit when it was just open! And I am so glad I stopped by today for lunch with my foodie friend. The whole experiences def exceeds expectation.First and foremost, services were impeccable from start to finish.Decor. You would press hard to find other restaurant that is more chic than ABC Kitchen in the city. Now, food! We came here for the Blackboard Eats special menu $32 for 3 courses prefix. First course, I went with the roasted carrots and avocado salad. This is prob the best salad I have had in 2015 so far. The sweet carrots and nutty avocado are mixed with crunchy seeds , sesame dressed in light sour cream and citrus dressing. Healthy and tasty! The lady who sat next to us eye-feasted my salad couple times and I heard her murmured ""that looks great"". Second course, I opted for the crispy skate salad. It is a very colorful dish: golden crispy skate, purple yam chip, deep orange carrots, green romaines and white dill tartar sauce. Love the colors! The taste is even better! The skate is crispy outside and juicy inside, cooked just perfectly. The tartar sauce is lovely, with ginger, dill and hint of spiciness. The portion is big too- dinner size not lunch size. Although I failed to make a dent, I am happily packing it home for dinner :)Although I love my skate, friend's entree is more creative and interesting- ricotta and farm egg raviolo. At first glance, it looks like regular poached egg.  but take a closer look it is so much more than that - it is poached egg wrapped inside ricotta cheese. When cutting it open, the egg yolk is coming out like lava!! Woooo~~ It is #creamy #cheesy and eggy at the same time. Check out the picture. We were so amazed by the creativity and technique. Basically you drop the whole egg in the middle of the ricotta and boil them together. . The pork ragu with chili, sage and Parmesan adds savor to the dish, though if I could I would skip the pork - not a fan. Overall, we are very impressed. Creative idea and flawless execution. At this point, everything feels so perfect. Can it be even better? Yes, it can! Comes the dessert. We opted for the almond cake and salted caramel ice cream sundae with candied popcorn and peanuts. Both are outstanding. I am more in love with the ice cream - i don't even like ice cream in general! It is not too sweet, soft, almost weightless, purely heavenly. Now that I have rekindled my love with ABC Kitchen, surely I will come back more often. Just a tip. You don't necessary come in here with resy on a weekday for lunch. For what i saw, there are plenty tables open at 1pm though OpenTable keep telling you the earliest avail is 2pm :/",2,0,0,Nomad M.,"New York, NY",126,298,1138
4.0,5/2/2015,"We chose ABC Kitchen by searching nearby places that rated well on Yelp. It was freezing out and we were using Google maps to help us find the place. It is in the middle of the street and the sign is small and gray. This made it a little tricky to find. From the front it looks small but once inside you see how far back and wide it becomes. There's a bar along the right wall in the front, high top tables and then more normal dining sitting along the back. In the far back there's another bar that seats about 6 people. We sat at the bar in the front in hopes that a table would open or another bar chair would become available. They only allow you to order food if you have a proper seat/space at the bar. This doesn't include the service-drink-well on the side. My bartender friend expressed how annoying it is when patrons camp out at the service-well.

This was probably the best part of our meal.  The mint sashimi was tasty, but the portion was too small.  The mushroom flatbread/pizza was good, but we felt the egg was way too undercooked;  It was basically almost completely raw, and it made cutting the pizza so difficult especially since the raw egg made the crust soggy.  The seared scallops were good, but there wasn't anything unique about it.  Also, there was nothing too distinct/special about the pretzel crusted calamari....there was not really a difference between this calamari versus the regular fried calamari.",0,0,0,Jaimie W.,"Orange County, CA",192,386,622

So to the food...My friend and I are more into the heartier entrees and full plates so we decided to skip the market plates and appetizers and go straight for the main courses:Fresh Fettuccine, swiss chard and pistachio pesto - such fresh pesto which a great combination of greens. We got the half size which was a good size to split for two peopleWhole Wheat Pizza with asparagus, bacon, ricotta, parmesan and black pepper - was skeptical of this because I didn't know how I was going to handle a large stalk of asparagus but they slice it length-wise so it's more like shreds of asparagus which make for a green complement to the bacon and cheese. Definitely go for this one if you are debating on a pizzaAkaushi cheeseburger with herbed mayo and pickled jalapenos - a really solid burger with a slight twist. I couldn't even really taste the jalapenos (which for me is a good thing because I don't like spicy stuff) but if you want a little kick I would recommend asking for a little extra.Overall it was such a delightful meal and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality meal in the city.",0,0,0,Kate H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,0
3.0,4/7/2015,"It's a really cute place with nice ambiance. Perfect for a nice gathering of friends or a date.  Service is quite good although not exceeding expectation.  Their house-made drinks are pretty good, but i don't recommend ordering wine there because it's way overpriced for the quality that they serve.  If you want some alcohol, I would go with their cocktails.The food there is alright, but I like their appetizers way better than the entree. The crab toast is a MUST order, very tasty and a good portion for appetizers also.  However, their pizza (at least the tomato&basil) actually worse than most places in New York.  The only crispy part is the crust, the middle part is way too soft that it just taste mushy in general. The fresh mozzarella on the pizza also isn't chunky and chewy but taste a bit granulated. I've had better pizza on the street.  I would give this place a 4 star for great ambiance and good service. Much to improve on quality of food.",1,0,0,Wendy L.,"Taipei, Taiwan",143,104,433
4.0,4/6/2015,"Organic, grass-fed everything. I had previously been here for brunch, but recently snagged a reservation for 2 for dinner the week of. We decided that we would kind of go for broke and order as much as we cared to, throwing all caution to the wind. Very glad we did, because it definitely paid off. We made most of decisions off of Yelp recommendations, so excuse us for adding just another picture to the pile of 10,000. The decor is very quirky but still upscale and elevated. The only thing that I didn't quite understand were the misshapen plates that looked like pottery class rejects. The clientele is a pretty diverse mix, with couples just having an elegant casual dinner, to recently graduated young professionals dressed to the nines, trying to make sure they were seen at such a upmarket establishment. I was definitely the former, but I remember a time when I was just like the latter, so I can't hate.Anyways, we started the meal with the crab toast and the mushroom pizza which was perfect. Toast was just the right amount of crunch and chew, and the crab was fresh and well seasoned, while pairing well with the lemon aioli. The mushroom pizza, though, was probably my favorite thing all night. The crust was just right, the hen of the woods mushrooms were delicious, and the runny egg dropped at the middle of the pizza just put it over the top. For our entrees, we ordered the fried chicken over collard greens and hot sauce butter and the black sea bass. The fried chicken was huge, and just the right amount of crisp, and the fried crust soaking up that hot sauce butter was perfect. The black sea bass was cooked just right too, and was fork tender, without being mushy. We ended the meal with the salted caramel sundae, which was again, huge and great. There was just a huge pool of chocolate sauce on the bottom, and the salted caramel peanut popcorn and ice cream was a good counter for all the sweetness.One thing I should point out is that the service was pretty suspect. The roaming waitstaff were attentive enough in refilling our drinks, bringing out silverware, and our courses, but the waitress who took our order took an inordinately long time to check in on us throughout the meal. As a result, we ended up waiting almost 20 minutes for the check. Not great. Prices are what you expect from Jean-Georges establishments, but not entirely unreasonable. Just need to up the attentiveness of the service, and it'll be perfect. You kinda know what you're getting with this restaurant, and the food is definitely well-executed. It's a good place for a fancier-than-average date, or dinner with a small group.",13,8,12,Eric J.,"New York, NY",490,923,1792

We got in and were seated promptly. We opted for the 3 course lunch and added a dish or two just so we could try a little bit of everything.  The highlight for me was the raviolo. The waitstaff did some odd things like take away our oil and vinegar when we were still nibbling on the bread, so I docked a star. But overall, food was delicious and I would come back again.

3.0,4/1/2015,"Came to ABC Kitchen on a Tuesday afternoon at around 1:00 PM for lunch, waited about 45 minutes for a table of two.The decor in ABC is basically what you'd expect from your standard brunch place- very hip with a kind of natural feel to it. The food here is (unsurprisingly) very organic, and at the back of their menus they source all their food (eg. their eggs come from a particular free range chicken farm in Connecticut).It seems like they occasionally run out of items, so you may want to go earlier in the day for actual brunch items. We ordered the Portabello mushroom and the crab toast with lemon aioli to start, and we shared a ricotta and farm egg raviolo. The portabello mushroom was straight up just one mushroom, so I felt a little gyped on that one. The crab toast was great, a must get. The ricotta farm egg raviolo was very small, and very expensive.Overall you pay for the ambiance and the fact that you can tell your friends you've been to ABC, right?",2,0,2,Matt L.,"New York, NY",108,694,604
5.0,3/27/2015,"Jean-Georges succeeds yet again! More casual than Jean-Georges' usual fare, ABC Kitchen offers an organic, farm-to-table experience with rustic decor and absolutely delicious food. Not easy to get a reservation, but once we finally got one, WELL worth it. Very much looking forward to a return visit!Four of us went for a Saturday girls' brunch. The dishes were universally delicious, and most were also creative / different than the usual standard NYC brunch fare. We tried the following:* Squash & Ricotta Toast: Hands down, my favorite dish of the brunch. The ricotta and squash combination was melt-in-your-mouth worthy.* Kale Salad: This one was what I expected - a solid salad with a crisp lemony dressing that was neither phenomenal nor disappointing.* Mushroom Pizza with Egg: Very good, with a combination of strong flavors from the egg and mushrooms blending well together. Note that the pizza isn't crispy, but is soggier / easier to eat with a fork and knife.* Scrambled Eggs and Crispy Oysters: Not quite what I was expecting, but delicious, the oysters were fried like calamari and laid on top of the eggs.* Sundae with Popcorn: The combination of ice cream, fudge, and popcorn textures made this one unique. Some at my table swore by this, and I'd heard a lot about it before my visit. I personally thought it was good (it's dessert; of course it's good!), but not insanely exceptional.Beyond the food - the homemade, rustic co-op style of decor definitely put us in the mood for the organic, homegrown experience to follow. You can definitely tell that much of the style was borrowed from ABC Home, to excellent effect. The service was stellar, with none of the rushed mood that you often feel at overbooked, popular brunch spots.

4.0,3/26/2015,"The husband decided to treat me to a fantastic Jean Georges birthday lunch here and it was well worth it. If you haven't been to ABC Kitchen before, you could easily miss the entrance, as it comes across as pretty unassuming from outside. Once you step inside, you're transported to a beautiful, vintag-y space - the décor is part rustic, part uber chic with lanterns, wooden tables and eclectic chinaware which we loved. Perfect for a date night or a girls night out. The experience was pretty much seamless, like a well-orchestrated dance - we were greeted by the host + hostess warmly, checked in our coats and waited for 5 minutes soaking in the ambiance and then were escorted to our table. The Food: Since this was a casual Sunday afternoon lunch/brunch meal, we opted for a few small plates and decided to share. Now when these guys promise a farm-to-table experience with the freshest ingredients they mean it. Mostly everything we tried (except the pizza) was bursting with flavors and the presentation was lovely.  * Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli: topped with luscious crab meat and zesty aioli, it looked unassuming, till we took a bite. The flavors are quite rich and you must love crab to like this one. #sogood* Roasted Carrot Salad: Never been a huge fan of roasted carrot or given carrot as a vegetable much thought! But this salad will make me explore options when it comes to this underwhelming vegetable. We really enjoyed the salad, especially the pairing of crunchy seeds with the slightly charred carrot and the citrusy avocado. Perfect. * Spinach Goat cheese herbs pizza: I've had better, this one wasn't crispy enough and would have liked to see more of the goat cheese. The cheese to spinach ratio didn't work for me, nor did the addition of kale to the mix. Unimpressive.* Almond cake with vanilla ice cream, cranberry-orange compote: If you like simplicity, you'll like this desert - the flavors are subtle and the ice-cream is a nice creamy companion to the sponge cake. * Thyme lemonade - There was a green drink on the menu that I wanted to try (with Kale, spinach etc), but they ran out of it. So we got the thyme lemonade instead - it was super refreshing, but don't expect a jumbo glass of lemonade like your  friendly neighborhood café! While they are not exactly stingy, it's not a lot to keep you going through out the meal.The service  was top notch. With pretty much back-to-back reservations it must be tough to give everyone a consistently relaxed experience but they've found the right balance.PRO TIP: Must book at least 3 weeks in advance to get your preferred time slot or you'll be stuck with odd hours like 3 pm or 10 pm.",13,7,9,Arshi K.,"Hoboken, NJ",741,350,704
4.0,3/25/2015,"So we went here for the weekday lunch here coz me and my husband got lucky to get a nice Friday afternoon off. Anyway, it was a terrible snow day and I was sure that place is gonna be empty. I mean who is gonna go to lunch on Friday in such terrible snow storm. But New york never fails to surprise!!! The place was packed. No wonder their reservations are always full. Anyway, our attraction was definitely the $32 pre fixe 3 course lunch. An appetizer, entree and a dessert for $32. Pretty sweet deal. So i got kale salad for the appetizer. Good, a little tart. For entree, I had portobello burger. Personally I am not a fan of mushrooms but I am a vegetarian and that was the only vegetarian option on the pre fixe menu, so had to get it. I found it pretty bland though the bread was pretty nice. For dessert I got the orange tart. Too dense. Couldn't have the whole thing. My husband got raw fluke for appetizer. He loved it. For entree I think he got the pork. He said it was ok and trust me he loves pork. But the star of the afternoon was definitely his dessert!!! Salted caramel sundae with caramel popcorn!!! Amazing!!!!! I don't even like salted caramel, but that sundae was crazy!!! Drinks were great too!!! So i would say, even if u can't get a reservation for dinner, just go for drinks and salted caramel sundae and I promise you, You won't regret it!!!",0,0,0,Sakshi G.,"Long Island, NY",41,79,36

The butternut squash soup was delicious!  The dessert, salted carmel Sunday (candied peanuts and popcorn, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce) was amazing.  I have been there three times now, and it is the only dessert I have tasted because I just can't skip it now that I've tasted it! (Next time i'm determined to try something else)I will say I wasn't impressed with the actual main course - but I think if I would have veered away from the set grand prix options, I would have been happier as far as the main course goes.  So, if you have the money (which I don't) I would order off the grand prix and just order what sounds the best!",1,1,1,Jade F.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",89,31,64

5.0,3/23/2015,"This is a really pretty and chic restaurant with clean decor and cute tableware - plates, silverware, serving bowls/plates, etc. You definitely will need reservations even on a weekday to get a good seat, unless you don't mind waiting and eating at the bar or high-boy type tables. I came here for a friend's bday dinner and I think it's best suited for nice occasions unless you're Rollin' in dough and are willing to drop big bucks on dinner any ole day!The drinks are priced similarly to other nyc restaurants - around $15-$20 - and they're delicious! I liked the basil and lime daquiri which was about $15 and super refreshing! This is one of my favorite flavor combos so I am also somewhat biased. My friend had some cocktail with rhubarb and she liked it a lot. If I went back, I would try the big apple cocktail! There is a full bar so I'm sure you can get whatever you like though.For dessert, we got a *free* chocolate cupcake for my friend's bday! It was delicious! Size wise it was slightly larger than a baked by Melissa cupcake but so much tastier. The chocolate frosting was like a puddingy ganache and the cake was moist with the right amount of cocoa. We also tried the cornmeal cookie and the almond cake. The individual cookie was $3 and I don't recommend it. The lemon filing was super tart and the cookie was dry. The almond cake came with vanilla ice cream and a cran-orange compote. The cake reminded me of marzipan - not a terrible thing! The compote was sour and not super tasty. It would have been better in a main dish - not a dessert. The ice cream was phenomenal! The cost was about $11. If I go back, now that I know how amazing their chocolate dessert can be, I will likely try the chocolate cake. Also, a lot of people love the salted caramel sundae...kinda wish I tried it now!!! As for the main courses, we kind of ate the sides and apps all together with the main dishes. We got the roasted kabocha squash toast ($15) and it came with fresh ricotta and acv. It was legit amazing! I would totally order this again. The squash reminded me of curried sweet potatoes... Such good flavors! We also had the roast carrot and avocado salad ($16). It came with a sour cream and citrus dressing. It was slightly hard to eat but the carrots were amazing! I am going to try to roast carrots with cumin and lime to replicate the flavor and texture. The fettuccine ($25) was good but nothing super duper special. I wouldn't get that again! The Brussels sprouts pizza ($17) was super unique though. What a cool topping! I really enjoyed this pizza and am going to be eating more Brussels sprouts now haha! Finally, we tried a side of sunchokes ($16). They are totally vegetarian but their texture reminded me of mushrooms - super tough and chewy.Overall, I loved the food and ambience. This is a great place for a date or event.

5.0,3/21/2015,"Lovely dinner at ABC Kitchen.  We were celebrating a special occasion, and this was the perfect locale.  Cordial service, and I loved the ambiance here.The kabocha squash toast to start was excellent.  The kabocha coupled with the fresh ricotta and cider vinegar amounted to such a savory depth of flavor.Crab toast is obviously a must, and was so light, refreshing, and had a substantial amount of crab meat.Roast carrot and avocado salad.  I had to order this given all the hype it's maintained after all these years... I was afraid others at my table would mock me for ordering such a ""boring"" (ie. vegetarian) dish, but it was really great.  It (and other courses throughout our meal) got the highest compliment from my mom, who commented on the complex combination of flavors and textures and said she didn't think she'd be able to recreate the dish at home (which is her (and often my) measure of how good a restaurant is).Calamari was perfectly fried and crispy, if not particularly interesting, but others enjoyed it a lot.Scallop crudo was tasty and I loved the textures in this as well, but certainly not a must-getHousemade chicken and pork sausage- people loved the mashed rutabaga that accompanied itLoved the mushroom pizza - anything with a runny egg, and I'm sold.  I wanted to try the brussel sprout pizza, but at that point, we were already ordering to excess, so we had to go withoutAkashi cheeseburger- I actually thought this was quite a good burger.  We ordered one as an appetizer to split- the only slight misstep was that they brought it out with the entrees, but whatever, not a big dealFor entrees, among all of us, we ordered the veal meatball bowtie pasta, black bass, skuna bay salmon, crispy pork confit, more cheeseburgers, more pizza, and their special, which was a dry aged steak.Both fish were cooked perfectly. The pasta was super delicious, but I'm glad I was sharing it, because I can see it getting pretty heavy if you're eating the whole bowl yourself.  I really didn't love the pork confit; I found it disappointing.  It had a barbecue flavor of sorts, which I wasn't expecting.  As for the steak...it was...fine.  Nowhere near the best steak we've ever had, and certainly not worth the ($160), but my friend who ordered it didn't find any of the other entrees particularly appealing, so I think he was fine with his choice.Ended our meal of course with a couple of the caramel sundaes, which were very good, as well as the citrus pavlova (refreshing sorbet) and chocolate cake.I'm definitely glad I came with a big group and was able to try so many dishes.  The appetizers/small plates are definitely their forte- if I were to come back, I'd probably just order a bunch of those.  I know there have been some reviews lately about how abc kitchen has gone downhill slightly in quality...but if that's the case and they're still churning out food of this caliber, then I'd say they're in good shape!",0,0,0,Yoko M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,150,12

Twice it happened where our neighboring table joked with us about how close we were together. In all seriousness though, it made hearing the waiters and waitresses difficult, and conversation strenuous. I ordered a white aphro,  which carried an old, stale aftertaste. After that, I went with an SH double white that was much better. The draft choices were very limited. My sister got the chardonnay,  which she seem satisfied with. Before I get to the food, I'd like to mention that I had to ask for their complementary bread rolls three times before they actually arrived. A bummer given that the entree came at that time as well, and my sister had long since drank her progressively chilling pumpkin soup. For food, my sister made the right choice and went with the Ravioli. I tried it and boy was it tasty. My veal meatballs and pasta left me a bit disappointed.

3.0,2/28/2015,"Finally made my way to ABC Kitchen recently, and I was unfortunately disappointed. The ambiance is great, you know you are eating at a special place when you're there. I think the best move for ABC Kitchen is to go with a big group and share a bunch of apps/dishes/veggies for the table or go for brunch. On to the food. Crab toast - this was phenomenal, a must order. Kale salad - I thought this was a miss, the dressing was a bit over the top for me-too bitter. Kasha and bow tie pasta - I enjoyed this. Wasn't the best thing I've ever tasted but it was very unique and definitely worth an order (this will be on my menu at my next Jewish holiday!) Striped bass - this was a big miss for me. The fish was cooked perfectly but the sauce was way over seasoned and almost inedible. Cod - executed very well and tasted great, maybe a tad over salted. Fried chicken - thought this was a miss. When you order fried chicken at a place like this you expect it to be special. I thought this was mediocre at best and could have been much better. French fries - who doesn't love fries? Sundae - this was ridiculously good.Overall, some dishes were very good, some mediocre and some just disappointing. I expected much more from a Jean Georges restaurant of this popularity.",1,1,1,Mike T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0

It's huge for a nyc restaurant, put still feels intimate and it has an airy, whimsical feel to it. I was in love at first sight but the food sealed the deal.The four of us ordered two bottles of wine and probably a third of the things on the menu-- salads, soup, pasta, lobster, pork chops, dessert, etc. Everything we ate was phenomenal-delicious, fresh and beautifully played! 2 of our diners has some pretty strict eating restrictions and they were incredibly accommodating- which was extra special since it was valentines day.

The reservationist pay special attention to my gluten free dining allergies and the kitchen was notified before I picked up the menu. Our server Ken Toode announced a comprehensive list of gluten free dining options as well as several menu alterations to accommodate my sensitive diet. Chef Karen's comprehensive knowledge of healthy dining options is well executed with the freshest organic ingredients this city has to offer!The Pear and Apple Salad is a definite crowd pleaser with generous amounts of candied Pecans, it is a great way to start the meal.A must try is the Organic Fried chicken. Its crispy skin and juicy textures will leave you breathless. Wash it down with a wide selection of house cocktails.

We ordered the butternut squash soup and it was so good. It was not too creamy and it even had pumpkin seeds in it. The soup had yummy chile flakes that gave it a perfect spice in only a few bites. For an entree, I ordered the sautéed shrimp, not know what I was going to get, and it was a delicious shrimp salad. It was so good and the whole table loved it. We also ordered a side of Brussel sprouts. The Brussel sprouts came in a yummy sauce and were sautéed with fresh apples and onions. The pairing was great.

And so close to the store it felt like we were not in he restaurant but I did not deduct a star for this.

5.0,2/12/2015,"After hearing about this place for ages I finally went here for my 30th birthday and was not disappointed!The ambiance of the entire place is very warm and inviting despite the price tag. I can't often afford to eat at restaurants in this price range, but I was never made to feel uncomfortable or like I didn't belong. The decor is very thoughtfully done and strikes a nice balance between feeling upscale and trendy while still remaining approachable. Also, I really appreciated that we actually had elbow room and weren't sitting on top of other tables. Too many NYC restaurants try to cram as many tables as possible in and it just makes the place feel cramped; that wasn't a problem here.Our server Travis was excellent. Very friendly and definitely knowledgeable about the menu, he was able to answer all of our questions and steer us towards the best options for us. He checked on us frequently and made us feel like special guests. From what I can tell all of the servers were just as good, so I'm sure you'll get great service no matter where you sit.The food was amazing! It's all locally sourced (the back of the menu lists where each individual ingredient comes from) and the portion sizes are filling without being overwhelming. We started off with an appetizer of the mushroom toast, which is topped with a lemon vinegarette and finishes off with a slight bit of heat from some sort of pepper. For the entree, I got the absolutely heavenly fried chicken in hot butter sauce. The chicken was coated in a light and crispy batter that I couldn't get enough of, and was beautifully presented over the butter sauce and a bed of collard greens. My boyfriend got a delicious looking whole lobster that he devoured. For dessert, I had a divine blood orange sorbet (and complimentary birthday cupcake) while the bf had a caramelized apple pie that he loved.Dinner certainly wasn't cheap, but it was totally worth the price for both the food and the experience. I would definitely recommend anyone who is interested give this place a shot (be sure to book well in advance). A fantastic way to begin my 30s!",0,0,0,Jared W.,"New York, NY",0,8,0

Super cute place, loved the fresh flowers, the vintage style plates, rustic tables and wonderful service.  However, the appetizers and entrée themselves did not amaze me and was actually too greasy. Dessert was delicious, but the combination was a bit safe and didn't leave too much memories behind. We ended up paying average of $70 (without alcohol) for dinner. I guess the organic ingredients explained the price.The highlight for this place was only the decorations and the service for me.

We were seated within 15 minutes and bought our drinks over to the table. The restaurant is actually really big and spacious, i really like how we were so far apart from the other tables cause it gave us privacy while in a big restaurant.SO THE FOOD!!! all their food is sort of tapas style and are meant to be shared amongst the table. we got the crab toast, the pretzel crusted calamari, the fresh fettuccine, the mushroom pizza, the pork confit, and a side of fries. Everything was good and enjoyable but nothing was especially memorable except the mushroom pizza. The crab toast was delicious and flavorful but very tiny...don't let pictures fool you.

Service, food, and the atmosphere were all very welcoming. The restaurant was rustic, yet chic. The only thing that I'm uncertain about is the peep into their furniture store that takes out the romance, rustic, and chic feel of the restaurant. The food and cocktails were amazing. How you not love a Jean-George restaurant? I would highly recommend roasted cod with cauliflower, crushed herbs and lime if you enjoy good aromatics. The sautéed skuna bay salmon, weet and spicy carrot sauce, roasted carrots and basil was also good. Opt for that if you are feeling more on the sweet side. Keep in mind that restaurants of this stature comes at a price, so also feel free to get a side. Accompany your meal with their well-known cocktails. The big apple was more than your average martini. It delivered more of a ginger aroma and sudden sweetness. The sour cherry old fashioned would be more for those die-hard artificial lovers, or for those that enjoy the taste of cough syrup. Always ask your server for suggestions! It'll never go wrong. Enjoy!",3,1,1,Yimei M.,"Queens, NY",777,185,922

All were delicious, though I have to say that my favorite was the green apple.We sat forever talking and catching up, and no one rushed us from our table the whole evening.  Our water glasses remained well attended long after we had finished eating.Jack, our waiter, was wonderful.

The mushroom pizza with egg might be my reason to move back to New York city. I would brave alternate side parking in exchange for the delicious, gooey, savory heaven of your warm soft pizza. Biting into one slice of that deliciousness is like a warm comforting cheesy hug at the end of a long day.I just want you guys to know that in all of NYC, you are my favorite guilty pleasure. My friends and family are all going broke with me because they too, long for the smooth, yet complex flavors of your culinary perfection. I'm certain I've died and gone to heaven when I'm eating there. Come to think of it, ABC kitchen does some how aesthetically echo what I'd always pictured heaven to look like.

I've yet to have a dish (appetizer, entree, or dessert) at ABC Kitchen that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed. The daily special is always a safe option if you or your dining companions are particularly indecisive about the menu.  I typically enjoy the fish entrees - the fish is always well-done and typically accompanied by a simple side of dressed veggies or some sort of mash.

Service is very welcoming, kind, and helpful. Our waitress recommended several dishes that we loved. The crab toast is delicious, as is the fettuccine, but the star of the meal is definitely the mushroom pizza, which is complex and earthy without being too rich or overpowering.

It definitely feels upscale and trendy and all the words you use in connection with this area of the city, but it also just feels enormous. Maybe I prefer long waits so that I can feel like I've earned my reservation -- maybe we've just been in NY too long. ;)But honestly, the food here was perfect. I am not the biggest pizza lover, and I simply couldn't get enough of the egg/mushroom/wheat pizza; I would have been happy to eat one myself. The fried chicken with the hot butter-based sauce was very good (and huge), the fish dishes were well-loved.

5.0,1/3/2015,"I wanted to wait before I wrote this review to make sure the magic of the evening had worn off and I could make as objective a review as possible. Funnily enough, a week later and the magic still hasn't worn off and I look back at my meal with longing. A yearly tradition has begun where for Christmas, I go out with my sister and brother-in-law for a nice dinner. This was absolutely no disappointment. The meal started with a glass of wine and some Mckenzie Rye. We followed with our first course, where we had a mushroom bread, ricotta with cranberry compote, a particular favorite of mine, a fluke crudo with dill, tuna sashimi, and a special pizza if the night, dates and prosciutto. After our first course, we relaxed for a few enjoyed another drink or two and moved on. Our entree was amazing. We had the red snapper, the fried chicken which was hands down the most moist and flavorful fried chicken i've ever tasted, the mushroom pizza with egg, and the lobster special with truffle butter glaze.  To finish the meal off, we had the ice cream sundae, which is designed to be a deconstructed snickers bar with salted caramel ice cream, chocolate sauce, peanuts, and caramel popcorn. In addition, our waiter sent out a piece of chocolate cheesecake. Usually, one or two items stands out as a defining dish of a meal. On the flip side, one or two items stands out as being slightly less or even not worth ordering. However, after enjoying the meal we had, I can honestly say, everything was top notch. Every dish was perfectly balanced and I found myself sad when the meal was over. Our waiter was another particular stand out. He was intelligent, informed, helpful, mindful of us and funny. He'd provide suggestions that weren't just trying to upsell the next item.  I couldn't speak and higher of my experience here if I tried. If you're considering going.

I really thought this was going to be THE best food ever since it is such a popular place. Honestly for all the hype I was disappointed. I thought I would walk away giving this place a five star but sadly it's just 4. The food wasn't anything amazing and mind blowing.

I wished I was hungrier so I could have ordered more. The calamari was fried to a perfect golden brown and the marinara sauce had just the right amount of kick. Also came with another sauce that's was very good.  Missing the 5th star as it took a while to get the check. But I'd definitely be back.,0,0,0,Steve B.,"Princeton, NJ",6,12,1
5.0,12/30/2014,"ABC Kitchen opened in 2010 and it's still impossible to score a reservation. I wonder who you have to have sleep with in order to get a table here [at a normal hour, no less]. Lucky for me, I did manage [without undressing] to get a 9PM spot.  Jean-Georges really brought it with his farm to table concept, the dessert was the only fault in an otherwise really stellar dinner. Food:Homemade Ricotta [$15]: The ricotta was so incredibly light and plentiful. It was swirled into a cranberry compote and served with grilled bread [on the side]. The presentation was absolutely beautiful, it kind of resembled a flower. My only complaint was the over char on the bread, it tasted a little like gasoline or the bread was grilled too close to an open flame.Pork Confit [$35]: I was incredibly blown away by the pork confit. It was almost like eating a huge slab of bacon. Speaking of bacon, that bacon marmalade was wonderfully sweet and salty. There were actually bits of bacon swimming through it. The turnips, while delicious, were the weak point of the dish. Leaving the stems attached made them really hard to eat because they were long and slightly wilted. Roasted Sunchokes [$12]: I've never had a sunchoke before, but I really love roasted vegetables. They had a deep roasted flavor and were absolutely delicious, albeit, a little overpriced. I could make these at home for a quarter of the cost.Dessert:Salted Caramel Ice Cream Sundae [$14]: Sorry, I'm not on the bandwagon for this highly praised concoction. The salted caramel ice cream was good [but it's better elsewhere] and the whipped cream was fresh. I always enjoy a sweet/savory dessert. But anyone can throw popcorn on top of a sundae, plate it over a vat of chocolate sauce, and call it inventive. Drink:My friend and I both had two rounds of the specialty vodka cocktail made with ginger and apple juice [$15]. Served in a martini glass, these these things went down fast, they weren't overly strong and just sweet enough for easy drinking. Service:I would have expected the service to be a bit more attentive. The server was basically there to do her job while the woman refilling the water was warm and kind. The atmosphere/decor of the restaurant reflects ABC Carpet and Home, a little rustic, a bit modern, and a lot pricey. This was an expensive meal at nearly $100 for two. I must admit nearly a third of the bill was devoted to alcohol. Oops. Completely worth it though.",4,1,2,Felisa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,198,192
3.0,12/30/2014,"OK so I was extremely excited to go here and had read all of the excellent reviews. I put our name in on a Saturday for brunch with a 90 minute wait, and they aren't lying, it's no less than the time they give. Once we sat down there was a large party next to us with two long tables of people celebrating something. We had the same three waiters that they did and it was blatantly clear they were super focused on the party table instead of us. We never knew who our waiter was, it took me getting up to ask for our check or I'm pretty sure we'd still be there. I can appreciate the work that goes into a large party of 30 or so, but for a restaurant like this to let it disturb service so much, especially after you wait for 90 minutes...I was surprised. The unfortunate part was that the ravioli were amazing, unlike any ravioli I've ever had, perfect pillows of cheese! But the service kind of ruined it in my opinion.

5.0,12/29/2014,"ABC kitchen is everything you want in a dining experience: good service, great ambiance and decor, interesting and unique venue, amazing food. I spent a weekend in NYC, and my friend and I scored reservations here at 9pm on Friday Dec.26. We arrived a bit earlier than our reservation, and only had to wait a few minutes before being seated. Considering what a popular night in Manhattan this is, I was pleasantly surprised. It was packed!I was immediately struck by what a classy place this is, while still being unpretentious. A large warehouse space, ABC kitchen reflects the home and decor side of the operation with interesting chandeliers, dinnerware, and wall decor. In terms of service, our waiter was attentive, though a bit rough around the edges at times (read: snob). The woman refilling our drinks and clearing our table was more pleasant.Ok, food. I'm used to the whole urban farm to table theme since that's a huge trend in LA, and a trend that I appreciate, so I was excited for some interesting combinations of ingredients. I wasn't disappointed. Here are our eats:MARKET TABLE: House made ricotta, cranberry compote, and grilled bread [$15]: My friend got this, and really loved it. I tasted the ricotta and cranberry compote, and literally could have eaten the entire plate myself if my friend let me. The ricotta was so fresh and creamy, I don't think I've had better tasting ricotta. I didn't taste the bread, but my friend commented that it was a little too charred. Roasted kabocha squash toast, fresh ricotta, and apple cider vinegar [$15]: I was drawn to this because I love kabocha squash, and of course ricotta. I was afraid it was going to be boring since it's just squash and toast. But, the second I tasted it, all fear disappeared -- it was delicious!! The combination of kabocha squash with apple cider, and the creamy texture of the ricotta with the crunch of the toast made this really fun to eat! ENTREES:Sautéed skuna salmon, sweet carrot sauce, roasted carrots and basil [$31]: I was really looking forward to getting fish at ABC kitchen since they pay close attention to how their food is source, and where it comes from (meaning, super fresh and tasty fish). The salmon was cooked medium raw and was perfectly tender. The sweet carrot sauce was a nice accompaniment to the subtle flavor of the salmon, and the carrots were charred and sweet. Not a single bite left!Crispy pork confit, smoked bacon marmalade and braised turnips [$35]: I can't say much about this since I didn't taste it, but my friend couldn't stop raving about this dish. The bacon marmalade was on point, every morsel devoured.SIDE:Wood oven roasted sunchokes with hazelnuts and herbs [$12]: I pushed this side on my friend a bit! I love sunchokes and can never find them in LA, so I jumped at the chance to get them. They were really tasty - roasted just enough so they're crispy, yet still tender. I loved the additional of the hazelnuts.DESSERT:Sundae with salted caramel ice cream, and popcorn [$14]: I was least impressed with this. While it was still clearly tasty, and the whipped cream fresh as can be, I was expecting something a bit more interesting. It really is just salted caramel ice cream, whipped cream, and popcorn.DRINKS:We both got the special cocktail for the night. I can't exactly remember what was in it, but it was a combo of vodka, ginger, lemon, apple juice, and some other tasty things. It was delicious, so much so we got another round [$15].Total: basically $200. This place isn't cheap (but what place is in NYC?), but the quality of the food, and the venue really are stand outs, and I didn't mind dropping the cash on a place with such high standards.All in all, ABC kitchen hit all the marks.

Fortunately, the Union Square Holiday market was just a couple blocks away, so we  gleefully wandered around there. As I walked to the table, I was astonished by how beautiful everything was. It wasn't just the furniture, the waiters, and the food, these things a restaurant can control, but even the patrons were too! When it came to the menu, I managed to find a healthy meal that I couldn't make at home for less than $40, but it was a struggle and it didn't come from the brunch menu.

I was glad that the toast maintained it's crunchiness. - The roast beets came in three colors atop tart plain yogurt drizzled with olive oil. So tender were the beets, they slice right through with a butter knife. So fresh was the yogurt, it was as good as the best Chobani in Soho. Beautiful.

It was all rather unplanned and although we called them three days before the event they took such great care of us from the first phone call to the moment they clapped for us as we left the restaurant. It seems it was the first wedding party they had ever hosted there, and they really went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to make an amazing meal for us. Printed menus with our wedding as a header, a lovely table, and great service which flowed so naturally... I could not have asked for a better place to have a wedding lunch and for a happier day.

I kid you not, I found this place looking for a lobster lunch and after asking a few friends if they heard about it, their eyes just filled with glee. That was enough to to RSVP for lunch.The decor is wonderful and the place is immense. Do not take the large number of seating lightly as this place is well known to have a wait time. We were seated immediately in the well lit large wooden bench Victorian decorated dining room.Meal started with crab on toast, a dish that sounds simple but has wonderfully complex flavors. The lobsters as a main course comes deshelled with the middle split in half. Lightly charred to give the meat a bit of soft texture.Home made sodas kept us trying out new flavors during our meal.Caramel ice cream for desert was big enough for sharing. This was a real treat as the ice cream is served just at the right temp putting a large smile on my friends face at the end of the meal.From the host, to the waiter, to the coat check everyone is up beat and kind.

Our entrees included the large sized ricotta ravioli (!!), the Black Sea bass and the Salmon. Deserts were the apple pie and the popcorn with salted caramel ice cream.

3.0,11/29/2014,"This restaurant has a really amazing menu but fails to deliver on the details that should be expected given its reputation. The physical space is amazing and well-curated. The menu, as I mentioned, seems great and appetizing -- my wife and I wanted to try practically every dish. We had a reservation and were seated promptly and courteously. Service was relatively quick. Prices were reasonable for the market, ingredient quality, and reputation.And yet, it seems ABC Kitchen disappoints each time on a detail. It was the rare occasion for my wife and I that we seriously considered sending back a dish or two. A few examples to illustrate what we found to be true:My market lettuce salad had a delightful dressing that was quite enjoyable, but was sprinkled in the kitchen with far too much cracked black pepper -- the pepper became the dominant flavor. My salmon entree later suffered from touches of the same problem. Hold off on the pepper folks!Our brussels sprout side dish was so overcooked the sprouts were squishy and even the waitress noticed and took it off our bill. Nevertheless, my wife and I enjoyed the friend chicken, mushroom toast without complaint and we'd recommend both.I ordered a glass of a sweeter white wine, and is often the case with these less-popular wines, the wine was over-chilled and the bottle didn't get enough turnover.As I noted at the outset, we simply expected more. ABC Kitchen touts their local and carefully curated ingredient sources and a preparation that truly lets those ingredients shine would be best.Final note: we went the Friday evening after Thanksgiving. I would have expected service to be consistent if not superior given it was a Friday evening. But perhaps holiday staff scheduling made things difficult?",2,0,0,Josh M.,"New York, NY",32,4,1

For drinks we ordered the melon cucumber juice and the carrot beet juice. We also ordered the sea bass and brussel sprouts on the side. Everything was well done and delicious. I would absolutely recommend this place! I usually don't like butternut squash soup or brussel sprouts but they cook them very well here. Beets were an excellent touch in the housemade yogurt. When I drank the juice, I was instantly refreshed. For desert we had the salted caramel ice cream and mixed fruit plate. We also tried the coffee and a Spanish red dessert wine.

She is rude and snobby, I can't understand how she keeps her job here. Her demeanor is unacceptable. This restaurant has become a major tourist trap so of course they are typically busy, however, the hostess feels it's necessary to ALWAYS be running a wait so she KEEPS TABLES EMPTY. The ""reservation"" excuse is not always true, beware, once we finally get to sit after a long wait and finish our meal, those empty tables never fill up. It's bizarre. Also - most of the food is decent but the pizza has gone downhill since they opened AND their brunch menu is HORRIBLE. The french toast is deep fried like a burned doughnut - do not order it, ever. I had to send it back. The scrambled eggs with oysters, (also doughy, greasy, and deep-fried but not specified on the menu), is SO BAD and at $23, left me shocked it was served to us.

The cons: My friend and I had chosen the prix fixed menu with appetizers, entrees and desserts. He had the soup and fish dish (sorry, forgot the names - refer to photo), which ended up being nearly the same thing. The soup was almost like a liquid version of his entree and didn't stand out.

5.0,11/17/2014,"So good! I won points with my foodie hubs for booking this spot for our first dinner in NY. Even at 6:30 the place was bustling and got busier as the night went on. The interior is so cute - white brick walls, shabby chic and the staff all dress in plaid shirts. Julian, our waiter, was very knowledgeable of the menu and very polite. Vibe is casual. Bread with olive oil is brought after you order with a small bowl of sea salt to sprinkle on top. We started with the crab toast with lemon aioli - toast was so crispy and crab was fresh. If you're not a mayo person, ask for no mayo (or on the side) bc there are drops of mayo on top. Love that the toast was already cut otherwise I would have cut them in my favor and would have taken the bigger half. Fried chicken w/spinach and mashed potatoes (added on as extra, on the side). Hubs wanted comfort food and absolutely loved how crispy this came out. Crispy pork confit with bacon marmalade. Hello! you had me at bacon. I couldn't get enough of the crispy pork belly or marmalade! The potato puree underneath was so smooth and rounded out the saltiness of the bacon and pork belly.Cocktails - I got the 'big apple' and hubs got the basil lime daiquiri. The big apple was lightly sweet and a little strong. The basil lime was very herb-y and was very good. I would love to come back to this spot again.

Restaurant is amazing, loved the interior, the service, the food and the overall vibe. Really good vibe immediately when we walked in. It was a $36 uber SUV drive from Central Park in traffic so well worth it. I had a few cocktails from their menu and they didn't disappoint so A + there. I am picky about my old fashion and they rocked it. The service was great, attentive but not in your face. Hipster but not overly. The gal who came around to ensure we had water, bread, etc. was on point, she was all over it which is great. I hate when I have to flag down staff but  I didn't so that was awesome. Food, what can I say it was great. I had the fried chicken with a side of mashed potatoes and it was the best comfort I had in a long while. Reasonably priced as well.

The restaurant front is unassuming, so you've probably passed by a hundred times and not known it.  The place is much more spacious than I had imagined, which is nice, but also made me wonder why it's always been difficult to get a reservation unless you do so far in advance.  The restaurant was half-empty during the early evening hours on a weekday.  For such a large space, there's also only 2 BR stalls in the women's room.  Prepare to wait!The service was great though.  It's also good for groups as they have the space to accommodate it.  But I say check out other places for actually good food!",1,1,1,Cece Y.,"San Francisco, CA",2,731,873

Again, we were both super pleased.  As were all of the people around us -- especially the girls sitting super close that were chowing down in the burger and fries.We didn't go for dessert even though all of the options sounded amazing.Next time in NYC, I'll definitely be back for more.  You can't go wrong at ABC Kitchen, but I definitely recommend a reservation if you plan on going...  Enjoy!",4,0,3,Gabi M.,"Phoenix, AZ",3699,1987,3334
5.0,11/10/2014,"Getting a reservation at ABC Kitchen is near impossible! They are usually booked up to 6 weeks ahead for decent dinner hours, so I was lucky when my friend called me one night and asked me to go dine with her. What's even better was that it was for her birthday celebration!I got there 45 minutes earlier because I didn't want to be late. Fortunately enough for me, they have a small waiting area with a bar-like table facing the street where you could order drinks while waiting for your table. The waiting area had velvet chairs that caught my eye and a bar right next to it. There was a fair amount of people waiting for tables around 8:45, and we actually didn't get seated until almost 20 minutes after our reservation time. Just shows you how busy they are!We got sat for our table of 4, and something about this restaurant is that all the furnishing is curated by ABC home. Our table was a white desk with white plastic chairs. For larger tables they had a wooden top that resembled a sliced tree trunk. It was also interesting to see that they did not match their utensils. Every time they came to change forks and knives, they would bring a different set of fork and knives.Three of us ordered the Fried Organic Chicken, and the other one ordered.... the akaushi cheeseburger I think (oops). Oh well, seeing as I didn't taste the other dish it doesn't matter so much. Before the entrées came out though we received the Roasted Kabocha Squash Toast on the house. I'm starting to think that Jean-Georges restaurants do this for all their customers, not that it's a bad thing. This surprise appetizer was splendid! I don't eat squash normally, but this was a genius idea! The thick toasted bread gave an opposing texture to the jam like squash. Although it wasn't quite like jam, it was a light topping that paired very well with the apple cider vinegar and cheese. I would definitely order it again next time!As for the fried chicken, it was the best I ever had! My first impression was that this piece of chicken was huge! I was expecting something 1/3 of the size, but they actually brought out at least 12oz worth of chicken in this dish. The crust had a unique design to it, and gave a more elegant crisp compared to KFC. I think that the best part of this dish was the yellow sauce that was underneath the collard greens. According to the website it is hot sauce butter. As simple as that sounds, it did wonders for the fried chicken. You could definitely taste the sweetness at the beginning and the spiciness at the end of each forkfuls of chicken!I should also include that this restaurant claims to offer freshest, organic, and local ingredients possible in all their dishes. The theme of organic and earthy is apparent throughout the restaurant too.Shout out to our first waitress who kept bringing samples of wine for my friend!Compared to Perry St, ABC Kitchen is much more casual and relaxed. The menu items are also cheaper overall and seems to be more American styled with French ideologies.

4.0,10/31/2014,"Pretty solid brunch option. It's easy to find brunch in NYC, but it's hard to find good brunch that you could see yourself going back to again and again, and I'm happy to say that ABC Kitchen is definitely one of those candidates. My friend and I came right around its opening at 11am and were seated within five minutes. A few other parties who queued before us left saying that the line was too long which was weird since we got seated pretty quickly. Might have been a function of where we got seated--we had an awkward high table near the bar area. Not idea, but given that we didn't make reservations, we weren't surprised. Brunch menu was solid--my friend got the eggs benedict with flying pigs farm ham and I had the kasha and bowtie pasta with veal meatballs. I was super envious of the eggs benedict that my friend had--I definitely wish I had gotten that. Probably some of the best eggs benedict that I had, and a pretty filling serving as well. It comes with a large helping of potatoes. My pasta dish was also pretty good, the bowtie pasta was really interesting--not the type of bowtie pasta that you're thinking. Judging by its shape, I'd guess that they're handmade maybe? It was good, but the flavor of the sauce was a little strong for me. So even though it was good, I wasn't able to finish it.They have a pretty good dessert menu, but we were both stuffed and ended up not getting anything. It's definitely on the pricier side--I think we each paid about $30 for our meal. tldr; pricy, but pretty good. I could see myself coming back in the future. Not necessarily outstanding, but it's a solid brunch option",4,2,2,Jasmine X.,"San Francisco, CA",798,1110,1512

We ordered a few different appetizers and a few different entrees.  The 2 desserts we ordered were the donuts and the almond pear tart.Our waitress was so sweet and I swear my water glass was filled NONSTOP.

I couldn't help but notice the decor and the atmosphere of the place; it was stunning in a very simple and elegant way. There were tree branches everywhere and pictures of different bird paintings on the walls. It had a very rustic/comforting/elegant feel. On the tables there were little white candles, and little vases with different flowers. The noise level was good enough where you can keep a convo going without yelling across the table. The table setting also caught my eye because each plate was different for each person. They were also very intricately designed and had a very homey feel. The wait staff was on point and always made sure our glasses were filled, our plates/tables were clean, and most importantly that we were satisfied with our meals and experience. I really felt like they went the extra mile to take care of us tonight. Now, for the food. Wow. We had a ton of food; apps, entrees, and desserts.  If I begin to describe each meal I'll be here all night. Everything is just amazing. The food was flavored perfectly and was very rich and organic which is a plus in my book.

We came with a reservation (that was placed a couple of weeks in advance - their reservations run out REALLY fast), so we were seated immediately when we got there. I recommend that you make a reservation since it's a very popular place, but I saw that a good number of people walked in without one and were seated on one of the large communal tables right away.We both got the pre-fixe lunch menu, which was a great choice:Line Caught Tuna Sashimi: light but delectable appetizer dish. The ginger and mint marinade went very well with the tuna sashimi. The portion is quite sizeable too.Grilled Portobello Sandwich: I've never had such juicy and delicious piece of portobello mushroom in my life! Arugula, parmesan cheese, jalapenos and lemon mayo went perfectly with the mushroom. The fries served on the side were some of the best I've had as well.Salted Caramel Ice Cream Sundae: AMAZING. The ice cream itself is delicious too, but it was even better when eaten together with popcorn, candied peanuts and chocolate sauce. The portion was very generous as well.I really can't complain about anything about this restaurant. The food is superb and affordable, the service is fast and attentive and the venue has a great ambiance and is beautifully decorated. While it's on the louder side, I wasn't too bothered since it added to the casual and comfortable ambiance of the venue. Also, the portions are HUGE, so I was left feeling very full and satisfied in the end; well-worth it for around 40-45 dollars with tax and tip per person.HIGHLY recommended!",0,0,0,Elle C.,"Manhattan, NY",21,331,0

3.0,10/14/2014,"Yes I know its a Jean-Georges and its locally-sourced and its interior is an ethereal farmers dream but we had nearly everything on the menu and ABC Kitchen is a disappointment. To start, the fish crudo dishes were the best (but nothing truly out of the norm from elsewhere.. see Wallflower in Greenwich Village, Diner in Williamsburg, etc). The veal meatball pasta was tasty but dripping in grease.The vegetable sides, squash and crab toasts, brussel pizza (and a complimentary heirloom tomato pizza in honor of the friends I was with) - all left me bored and disengaged. I'd absolutely say skip the pizzas as they are mere soggy-crust piles of dough that could use a lesson from any of the 50-something amazing pizza places in the city. In terms of the entrees, the cod is engulfed in a less-than-harmonious herbed/earthy broth, skip it. The pork confit which I thought for sure would lift my spirits was dry ?? Maybe an off-night in the kitchen? Hasn't it been rendering in its own fat for the past few months ? And the salmon, again, was nothing extraordinary. I did not try the chicken as I was so underwhelmed that any more tasting would simply add salt to the wound. Then on to dessert...why is their ""signature"" dessert a bowl of chocolate syrup, ice cream and cracker jacks ? Plus their almond cake was dry and lackluster as well. I'd only recommend ABC Kitchen for a night out with the girls-- drink some wine, share a couple small plates and then be off to bigger and better things.

4.0,10/8/2014,"I had been wanting to eat at ABC Kitchen for a while but it was always so difficult to get a reservation!  A friend of mine was able to help me out with dinner reservations and my boyfriend and I celebrated our August anniversary here.  We started with the house made ricotta, fig compote and grilled bread and it was delicious.  It was a little on the sweet side for my personal taste but my boyfriend devoured whatever I was unable to finish.  For my main meal I chose the ricotta ravioli (because one can never eat enough ricotta cheese)  and it was BY FAR the best tasting pasta I have ever eaten in my entire life (and I have eaten in Italy).  There is such a freshness to the food here that helped me to understand why it is difficult to get a table.  However, the place wasn't packed at all.  We were there at 6:30PM after a Broadway show and there were tons of available tables around us.  I think ABC Kitchen might limit the amount of reservations that are booked in advance so that they can still honor walk ins, which is very smart.  If you intend to eat an early dinner on a Saturday night you shouldn't have an issue getting a table with a minimal wait.  The service was excellent.  Our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly and asked us if we were celebrating anything special after we ordered champagne.   We told her we were celebrating our anniversary and when we finished our meals she brought out a congratulatory pastry dish with candles.  It was SO nice and completely unexpected but great service leads to a great experience!  I look forward to returning in the near future.",1,0,0,Aileen K.,"ASTORIA, NY",245,121,82

5.0,9/27/2014,"I heard great things about this restaurant from my first week in the city, and finally tried it out after two years.The food here is phenomenal - I came for brunch and ordered the crab toast and french toast, both which had deep flavor, were decadently rich, and superbly unique. I really cannot explain how well made these dishes were, and I think phenomenal may be the only word to describe. I also ordered the very popular salted caramel popcorn sundae for dessert, but to my dismay this dish was not as on par as the others, and was a bit too sweet for my taste. I highly recommend asking your waiter to guide you through the menu or provide their suggestion.The ambiance was very unique - well-spaced, bright, trendy/chic interior decor. The space is very beautiful as you walk in and there's ample space between tables given the location. There's also an interesting combination of wood along with glass and metal, and the restaurant is conjoined with a furniture shop which is interesting.Service was fine, but it's more casual than formal. The waiters are very knowledgeable, kind, and check in often.Some items I disagree with about other reviews. First, I certainly do not think the restaurant excelled on every dish, especially since the salted caramel popcorn I did not find suited my palate, and in reading the reviews there has definitely been dissatisfaction voiced on some options. That being said, you'll be safe if you ask the waiters what's good and popular - I personally don't like French toast, but would have regretted coming here if I didn't order it, per my waiter's recommendation.The bill rakes up for the food you're getting - my three items along with a diet coke totaled to a bill of $55 including tip.

3.0,9/25/2014,"Uneven experience makes it impossible to recommend.  My wife and I heard so many rave reviews; but based on our first experience, it's marketing hype to us.  We were met by a courteous reservation desk and quickly seated because we arrived just at noon, opening time for lunch.  Robbie the waiter was pleasant and helpful.We chose one of the small pizzas ($17) for an appetizer, and we were very happy with it. About 10"" diameter, and it was loaded with broccoli, cheese and flavor. Our hopes were raised based on how good it was. We also had a small bowl of squash and pumpkin soup that was served steaming hot and was very flavorful. From there it went mostly downhill. The veggie burger ($17) is served in a fragile heated pita. Sadly this combination cannot work. The hot and moist burger (tasty) soon makes the pita disintegrate in your hands as you try to eat it. Don't they eat what they make as a test before placing it on the menu? When we ordered we requested french fries ($7) which didn't arrive until two requests to the waiter. And the dish was overflowing with fries. Unfortunately the majority of the fries were short end pieces, like from the bottom of the bag. They were unspiced, even saltless. The ravioli with egg filling was a good attempt at a slightly different dish. Unfortunately the first plate was at best, lukewarm. They apologised and brought another. It arrived hot, in a hot dish. Here they tried hard and cooked it hard. The ravioli was made from very thick pasta which was served dry and covered with shredded parmesan, in a pork laced base. The flavor was there, it just didn't chew well due to the heavy pasta and the salty pork. If they give you a finger dish of salt on the table (no pepper was ever offered) why make the dish so salty. It was odd to oversalt the dishes and then have no salt on the fries. Lastly, the ice cream sunday was fantastic. Really delicious. Worst Issue was a small piece of clear plastic I felt in my mouth while eating the ravioli. They were sincerely shocked and sorry. They gave me a reasonable credit of $25. It just creeped me out. So the total was almost $80 for a uneven lunch. We will have to think hard and long before we would return here.",0,0,0,J H.,"New York, NY",4,147,24

3.0,9/21/2014,"Actually 3.5 stars -- rounding down since it is fairly pricey.  Feel bad though cuz I had such a good time here though because I was in great company!!Crab toast and the cavatelli were the best dishes according to the overall consensus.  Everyone enjoyed the fried chicken as well.  I'd probably say skip the shroom pizza -- bottom was super soggy because they load on a TON of shrooms but super umami flavor.  The carrot salad that everyone raves about was good but not amazing.  Eggplant toast was meh.  Lots of vegetarian options which were all good, but none of the veggie dishes were mind blowing IMHO.  In my experience, farm to table, veggie dishes are best in SF Bay Area.  Sorry, NYC!Really beautiful venue with a good looking swanky crowd to match.  Service was pretty good, although it was kinda hard to find our actual server to get stuff sometimes.  He seemed really busy though, so all good.Getting reservations here is kinda insane -- you're probably not going to get a reso for a reasonable dinner hour unless you call the second the bookings open.",0,0,0,Latef X.,"New York, NY",37,576,652

5.0,9/19/2014,"So, your parents are visiting you in NYC in 2 weeks and instruct you to make brunch, lunch or dinner reservations... what do you do? Immediately go to Opentable and make a reservation at ABC Kitchen. Why it's worth it: This restaurant is located at the ABC Carpet & Home department store, which means you can browse trendy chandeliers and other items before heading to the bar...but back to the restaurant, this is how I would like to eat at my fancy country house, if I had a fancy country house.Vibe/layout: The vibe is organic and Hamptons, airy, open and relaxed. The theme is sustainability, as most things on the menu come from local suppliers; the menus are made from recycled paper, the dun-colored place mats are compostable and after closing time, all leftovers are sent off to the compost heap. Everything, including the antique armoires, reclaimed-wood tables, clay dishware, chandeliers and wildflower table settings are gathered from local artisans in CT, NY and NJ.Ideal meal: House made ricotta ravioli, herbs and tomato sauce ($15) or akaushi cheeseburger ($24)F.Y.I.: We recommend making reservations 10 days in advance, as this is a Jean-George Vongerichten restaurant.For the artsy restaurant goers: Among the local artists and artisans who contributed to this restaurant's decor are Jan Burtz (handmade porcelain plates), Jim Denney (recycle-wood tables), Eric Slayton (steel and concrete art installations) and Elena Lyakir (abstract nature photography).",1,2,1,Liza D.,"New York, NY",9,57,0

Their focus is totally on organic, pesticide free, synthetic fertilizer free and no hormones or antibiotics. A tall order in the fast food market but not so in the artisinal market. It is all about choosing your ingredients directly form the farmer. That means the price is higher. Who would not pay extra for quality that is evident in the taste?The room is gorgeous with soft and romantic lighting, odd decorative items and just the right touch of decor.We had the specials of the day which usually means the chef found some stuff locally to offer.Organic salads to start and the marinated olives is a mustI had to also have the carrot ginger soupMy wife had the grilled chicken breast that was moist and juicyI had the grilled sea bass fish which was served with a crispy skin and a  moist center. Done just right.ABC is also home to the fantastic design store so check out each floor for interesting items and design concepts.Lunch is served until 3pm but the dinner menu is pretty much the same price but at lunch they have a prix-fixe for $30.So if you sit down around 4pm its the dinner menuNYC has a gazzilion restaurants so after having a cheap lunch at the Shake Shack or the wonderful Halal Chicken with white sauce off the food cart you deserve a real dining experience with cloth knapkins.We skipped dessert and grabbed a Gelato at Eataly and then walked for a jaunt along the High LineMy friend enjoyed the recent menu item of wood oven roasted maine lobster and the kale salad",0,0,0,Johnny L.,"Maple, Canada",43,338,184

Pretzel Crusted Calamari - Perfect balance of the crunchy texture from the pretzels to the soft/tender texture of the fresh calamari I just don't understand why other restaurants are not frying their calamari in crushed pretzels. 2. Raw Scallops on the shell - They were so sweet and honestly melted in your mouth. This was by far my FAVORITE dish. 3. The Suckling Pig - Well this had bacon marmalade on top of it...Need I say more? 4. Fried chicken in hot butter sauce - You honestly can't go wrong with fried chicken and butter and this was so juicy and buttery that it was just amazing! The service was impeccable and the decor was perfectly trendy and romantic. In my opinion everyone needs to come here at least once.

And the fried chicken was delicious - a bit of a kick to it. However, I'm not sure if the menu would draw me back. I do love that everything is organic and farm to table.The service was ridiculous. The hostess seemed out of it and our server was even worse. He came to the table about 5 minutes after we sat down to read us the specials but until I asked for them, didn't realize he had never brought us menus. He brought bread to the table next to us but not to us, until we specifically asked for it. Every time we asked a question, there was a few seconds of delay where he just stared at us blankly, eyes glazed over, before forming an answer. Honestly, I think he was high. When we left, we went to collect our items from the coat closet and the attendant was asleep! We even said ""Hello"" loudly. Nothing. Glad our things were still there as anyone could've come in and just taken them.Good vibe in the restaurant but def not recommended if you're looking for a quiet dinner.

4.0,9/7/2014,"Decor/Atmosphere: 5 starsThe exterior of the restaurant is very misleading, kind of a grungy feel. I walked past it multiple times before realizing this was the place (the sign was also very small). But when I walked inside, I was blown away by the decor and lighting. Not exactly sure how to describe it, but it felt elegant, trendy, and romantic all at once. Must say this was a very pleasant surprise. Recommended for a date spot if you're looking to impress.Food: 3.5 starsMy friend and I shared the following:- crab toast with lemon aioli (the only MUST get item on the menu. probably the best thing here)- heirloom tomato salad with feta, cucumber, and red wine vinaigrette (this might be farm to table, but the $17 salad I got tasted like it came from a 24/7 deli in Times Square.. not from a Jean George's restaurant. Was very disappointed in this, but read the ""Service"" section on how ABC kitchen redeemed itself to me)- fried organic chicken with collard greens and hot sauce butter (very large portion, extremely well cooked and tender chicken, good sauce)- black sea bass (I'd recommend this over the chicken, but portion was slightly small)Service: 5 starsMy waiter was very friendly and accommodating. Everything was going pretty well until they brought up the heirloom tomato salad... It didn't say there were mushrooms on the menu, but there were on my plate... and i have a STRONG aversion to mushrooms (don't ask). Needless to say, I barely touched my plate. My waiter came over and was concerned I didn't like the dish. I explained there were mushrooms even though it didn't say so on the menu, that it was drenched with vinagrette, and was a rather mediocre salad.. He offered to bring out a new one from the kitchen or to simply take it off the bill. Wow! We ended up not having to pay for the salad. I think if we did, I probably would've given this place 3 stars. Thank you to my observant waiter :)Also to note is that they recommend sharing the plates here. My friend and I decided it was a good idea. But we were pleasantly surprised when all the dishes came out in 2's! They had split the apps/entrees in the kitchen so we didn't have to reach over to each other's plates. It's little things like this that make me feel like an appreciated customer.I'd recommend this restaurant to someone purely for the dining experience. I didn't think the food was exceptional (I've had better for the same price), but I'll definitely be looking for a restaurant that comes close to the decor and service at ABC Kitchen.",1,0,1,Sally L.,"San Francisco, CA",497,395,1195

I had no expectations coming in as I'd not been trying to go here- I just happened to wander by whilst exploring the Flatiron area and decided it looked like a place I might like. I arrived just a little after noon and was greeted warmly by the front of the house staff. I opted to sit at the bar like I usually do for my dining-alone adventures. The bartender was equally nice and was quick to bring over water and the menu.I opted for the prix fixe lunch. First course was the tuna sashimi. It was gorgeous. And delicious.Second course, I had the ricotta & egg raviolo over pork ragu.

It was so, so good- but I'm inclined to think anything with a perfectly runny egg stuffed inside cheesy goodness is perfection on a plate.Finally, dessert, a tart with lemon and blueberries.

We didn't have reservations but the host condescendingly informed us we could sit at the tiny hallway bar, because they didn't have tables open. I'd have no problem with this, if not for the fact that the entire time we were there (and it was a WHILE) more than 50% of their tables remained empty. I read another review in which the person felt they were treated like 2nd class citizens; that's exactly how it felt to us, too. Despite being stuck in steerage, we remained optimistic after hearing such rave reviews. Unfortunately, once you're tagged and branded as chattel, you're SOL at this place. No less than four bartenders ran back and forth in front of us and we weren't able to even order our drinks for another 15-20 min. Then it was probably half an hour until we received them.

You are better off buying a bunch of kale and just knawing on it raw because itll be better than this salad.

I would've been happen with a big bowl of that as a meal. The bread that they brought out was fresh and warm. For an entree I had the sauteed skuna bay salmon, which, while expensive and a small serving, was worth it because I can say that it was one of the best pieces of salmon I've ever had. She had the fried organic chicken which I tried as well. It was so flavorful and cooked perfectly. We couldn't decide on which dessert to split so we got a piece of the chocolate cake and a piece of the almond cake. The chocolate cake was fine, but nothing special. The almond cake was light and tasty and came with a yummy apricot sauce. The servers were very attentive and the food came quickly. We had an early dinner so that could have been a factor in the fast delivery, but regardless, everything was spot on!",0,0,0,Nicole M.,"Bethpage, NY",14,14,4
2.0,8/9/2014,"Simply put, there's nothing special here. For the prices, I expected them to put more thought into the plates or the service, but I was sadly mistaken. Service was slow and inattentive. As for food, the portions were much smaller than anticipated. Although the black sea bass had potential, it was tiny and the sauce tasted like salty lemon juice. The kale salad lacked flavor and was a miss. Ultimately, the kitchen needs to taste as they go along. I won't be coming back.",0,0,0,SJ J.,"Woodside, NY",3,6,0
5.0,8/9/2014,"ABC Kitchen delivered a phenomenal meal and is definitely one of my favorite restaurants. The menu has a great variety and caters to vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. I really appreciate the quality of the ingredients and the source listing for many ingredients and menu items. I enjoyed the 'roast carrot and avocado salad with crunchy seeds, sour cream and citrus' as well as the 'ricotta cavatelli with peas and mint"" (sans the smoked bacon). The salad was really impressive; tasty, textured, and generously sized. The cavatelli was cooked to perfection and I loved the way the peas were transformed into a pesto. I also sampled the house made ricotta ravioli which was very nice. I don't get to the city as often as I'd like these days, otherwise this would be a regular ""nice dinner out"" spot for me.

My guest and I  were clearly catching up and didn't even have a chance to browse the menu. We were queried twice in very short order for our selections. By the third attempt (within 10 mins) we felt pressured to order. Ok, chalk it up to over zealous service.  Appetizers were tasty and well presented. But, before we could finish them, our entrees came. There was a hasty and awkward shuffle on the table as we tried to make room for the extra dishes. This was definitely the low point. It felt like amateur night. Apologies were made but the experience was already marred.  Amateurs or just trying to rush us? Making matters worse was the over cooked and over salted snapper.

It took a while for us to get service, both for preliminary drinks and for food, but when our server was around he was very friendly and offered great recommendations to my family members. My reasons for knocking a few stars is that i (annoyingly) have celiac disease and so need to be extra careful about my gluten allergy. The server didn't seem to know whic items were gluten free (which is fine, it can be a lot to remember!) so I asked him to check on a few things before ordering. Then these things I asked him to check on simply came out with the rest of our food. When i asked a runner if an item was gluten free he said ""ummmmm yes?"" i asked ""are you sure"" and he said ""no. I can check.""

Everything was delicious and the menu is expansive enough that it's worth a trip back as well. It took us a bit of time to get the attention of a waiter to take our order, but it may have been cause it was a long week and neither of us were in the mood to obnoxiously wave someone down.

4.0,7/22/2014,"I came here for a post-graduation lunch with my friends and family. Owned by Jean-Georges, this restaurant reflects his style, down to the rural, country-inspired flower patterns on the silverware, unique and delicate glass structures, and vintage details. The prices are a little steep for lunch, especially when Jean-Georges boasts an excellent and affordable $38 two-course lunch at his three Michelin starred flagship restaurant, but it reflects the laudable promise of farm-to-table dining, which is highlighted by the extensive page on the menu detailing the farms where the food grows. My table ordered the following dishes: Line Caught Tuna Sashimi: light, flavorful and delicious. The amount of tuna was quite generous and not sliced so thin you could see through it. Akaushi Cheeseburger: apparently Akaushi is a type of Japanese beef? My friend who ordered it said it was very good, and struggled to finish it. Pizza with mushrooms, parmesan, oregano, and a farm egg: This was really yummy and we gobbled it in seconds. There was a perfectly wobbly egg baked in the pizza that, when cut into, drenched it in gooey egg yolk goodness. At least three varieties of mushrooms were present; it looked like honshimejii, button, and shiitake to me, -amongst others. Ricotta and Farm Egg Raviolo: More runny egg yolks! This was a very rich and filling dish, loaded with flavors from the pork ragu, spices, and parmesan cheese. Kasha and bow tie pasta with veal meatballs: Disappointingly, quite an average dish. The pasta sauce was not very flavorful and the meatballs were dry.",1,1,1,Nancy N.,"Los Angeles, CA",59,13,4

With no reservations and the wait being about 40 min long, we were lucky that the bar area was available. The inside is real nice and big. Very glam rustic. Unique and great indoor decor and well as design I loved the restaurant. The bar area was nestled in the back that seated about 6 so it was perfect since we were in a bit of a rush since her lunch was within an hr. A great restaurant for a date, dinner with the girls or for any occasion, business attire or dressy casual. Service was a bit slow and not the friendliest but it was busy. We did not order much since we were still pretty full from our late breakfast. _Line caught tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint ($16). Portion was pretty small. We ordered this twice because it was that good and refreshing. The ginger added a nice kick while the mint made it taste fresh and light. The first order came in 4 but the second came with 6 so it would be nice to know that we paid $16 for 6 and not 4. _Kasha and bowtie pasta, veal meatballs ($16 | $24). $16 for a small appetizer portion and $24 for an entree portion. We got the entree size and shared it. It was pretty big. The bowtie pasta was different from your average american style bowtie. A bit smaller and thin. I wish the texture of pasta was more al dente. The veal meatballs were cooked great and generous portion of meat. Not sure what the crunch was but I liked the texture of it since the pasta and meatballs were both on the soft side. The cheese and herb garnish added a nice touch to the dish. The dish was a bit on the sweet side so after a couple bites it got a bit overwhelming. Still great!_Chocolate cake with malted chocolate ganache, toasted marshmallow icing ($11). Possible one of the best chocolate cakes I've had! Nice big slice of chocolate cake. The cake was so moist and so light. The ganache made it taste rich but not heavy or overpowering. The marshmallow icing was fluffy and paired perfect with the cake without being heavy like most icing can be. A must try!A bit on the pricey side but well worth it.

To start, I was shocked by how huge this place was. Because of insanely limited reservation availability, I just assumed this was a tiny restaurant. Nope, it's humongous. No restaurant this big should have this long of a lead time for dining here. I seriously question the efficiency here. And if they're withholding reservations to create an air of exclusivity, well f you. Disclaimer, I'm a vegetarian. So perhaps the meat/seafood dishes would be more impressive here. We shared a few things:- The roasted carrot and avocado salad was by far my favorite part of the meal, it was incredible as far as salads go.- The kale salad PALED in comparison. Very boring and bland.- The mushroom and parm pizza with eggs was really good, but very rich. I couldn't get more than a slice down because it was sitting so heavy in my stomach. - House fries were predictably good.- Carrot cake for dessert was pretty bad. Not interesting or impressive at all.

4.0,7/7/2014,"ABC Kitchen is a prime example of how the YELP review system sometimes fails.  For instance, ABC is an expensive, world-renown establishment and compared to its peers, I think it gets like a 4.4 out of 5.  But, when compared to every restaurant in nyc it's clearly closer to a 5! Zagat, when it was online, had 4 criteria: food, service, decor and price.  I get that one overall rating is easiest but here's a time when it's confusing to users.  So, if I didn't know about ABC's reputation and just looked at YELP and looked at other places close by to ABC I'd say, hmm, this place ABC gets 4 stars, but so does Beecher's right next door and the only quantitative difference is that Beechers has 1 less dollar sign.  Does that dollar sign really impart the dramatic difference between Beecher's and ABC Kitchen?  Beecher's is great, but by assigning 4 stars to both is sort of an injustice.",1,0,1,Rick M.,"New York, NY",5,95,2
3.0,7/7/2014,"Everything was great... except for our waitress. The waitress was not personable and engaging as she was with the table sitting aside from us (an older couple)... When I asked about two different things on the menu, she responded in a very condescending manner. It was my first time visiting with my husband and baby, and I was unfamiliar with how the food was paired or if it was accompanied with anything. Instead of a friendly response, I got, 'it is what it says it is' tone.. When the couple was greeted sitting next to us, the same server greeted them with a background food knowledge of their produce, food and companies mission statement.. with us.. (maybe she was being discriminatory cause we had a stroller), she was very hasteful and I felt rushed!!.. I didnt have a chance to really look at the cocktail menu.. so when I asked for a suggestion, she gave me 3.. but didnt tell me anything special about any of them to entice my selection.. I tried again, to ask about a 'refreshing drink' and she responded, 'like i said, its either this one, this one, or this one'...So I just went with the Thyme cocktail... I dont know, the food, ambience, decor, and atmosphere outweighed the service by far... Our nieghboring table was very cordial and hospitable.. The wait staff just seems over worked and over it.. and you know what... It wasnt packed wall to wall like an ordinary brunch day, due to the holiday.. so I dont understand all the dreery faces and our waitresses rushing manner, (we did make a RSVP 3 weeks in advance) ... Cheer up! Its a beautiful place and cause to be apart of.. Was just very disturbed by the waitresses service.. Next time, I will address it and ask for a different server..",0,0,0,Noah L.,"Manhattan, NY",5,10,0

5.0,7/7/2014,"I made a reservation at ABC Kitchen after hearing that Chef Dan Kluger would be leaving at the end of June. I was on vacation two weeks ago therefore I couldn't make it here before he left. I haven't been here since 2010 and the food was still as amazing as the last time I was here. The new head chef and staff have worked with Dan for years. Hopefully they can keep up the great job.I ordered the Crab toast with lemon aioli and the fried organic chicken. The crab toast was fantastic. Not too salty with a generous amount of crab sprinkled atop perfectly toasted sourdough bread. The fried chicken was fantastic. It isn't really fried but rather flash fried somehow creating an amazingly light and crispy batter. It wasn't greasy or heavy at all. Very moist and tender and it comes with a delicious hot butter sauce and a side of sautéed spinach. Amazing. My fiancé ordered the roasted portabella and the entree portion of the Kasha and bowtie pasta. The veal meatballs in the pasta were a little salty for him but he still enjoyed his dish. You can order this as an appetizer as well. I would suggest that you order the smaller portion of this and get something else as an entree.We had to save room for the sundae with salted caramel ice cream, popcorn and chocolate sauce. I was only able to eat three spoonfuls of this but it was amazing.The cocktails here are great. I ordered the vodka thyme lemonade and the ginger margarita. They were very good with the lemonade being the better of the two.The service was excellent. We can't wait to come back!",1,1,1,Cuppy E.,"Long Island, NY",32,190,568
4.0,7/6/2014,"ABC Kitchen is a little slice of the Bay Area (CA) right here in Manhattan. The dishes are light, fresh and unique. I've been here a few times and tried all the frequently mentioned items. The highlights are, tuna sashimi, mushroom w/fried egg pizza and salted caramel sundae. In fact, the sundae is the best dessert I've ever had!This is a hard reservation to get but well worth the wait.

4.0,7/5/2014,"We had a delicious meal here.  Like most New York restaurants, the tables are fairly close together but other than that the atmosphere was nice.  The service was ever present but never overbearing.  We started with the beets with yogurt sauce and the steamed artichokes.  Both were delicious but the beets were incredible!!  My husband and I both had fish entrees, the halibut and the snapper, which were very good.  Do not miss the salted Carmel sundae!  It was practically perfect in every way.  The highlights of the night were definitely the beets and the sundae.  I have to add that I felt like this restaurant was pretty reasonably priced for New York standards.  We had wine with our meal and our bill was less than $200 before tip.",0,0,0,Audrey B.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",2,3,1
4.0,7/4/2014,"When I saw the menu online prior to going, I didn't fully understand why this place is one of NYC's 15 toughest tables to get. It listed salads, pastas and pizzas - regular Mediterranean dishes. When we arrived though, I was really impressed by the ambiance. It was such a perfect paradox of being earthy yet stylish, rustic yet modern! Loved the wooden pillars with traditional chandeliers. The lighting was just right - you could see your food but shroud your dining companion in a neat shadow. Service was casual but professional. They said that it took too long to bring out our pizza, so they gave us a complimentary beet salad while we waited. We also got the carrot avocado salad and really enjoyed it! The cavatelli pasta was really good - yummy mushroom broth! The pizza with an egg on it was unique, and good. The most surprising part was the price - we only paid $60 pp and also ordered cocktails.",1,0,0,Shradha A.,"Chicago, IL",703,2223,207
1.0,7/4/2014,"Just now writing a review because I don't use this site too much as I'm very busy with work on a computer so the last thing I want to do when I get home is get back on one, but when I do log into yelp- I do several review from the past weeks as we eat out a lot. I was very disappointed with this place. My fiancé actually took me out for my birthday and we were there for over 3 half hours before we fished out meal due to the slow service and a server that lacked Enthuastic, energy and just seemed like she absolutely hated her job (not sure her name, but she was thin, blonde, shoulder length hair and in her 30's.) When we first arrived we were seated and finally had to flag someone down just to get a drink order in and a glass of water. Granted I know it was Father's Day but e waited over 30mins just to get a greeting, a drink etc. After that it was another hour before we received our appetizers and the entire night continuing like this. Every time we needed a drink or to place an order for another course we had to flag someone down. We never really seen our waitress more than one other time during the service (which was fine) cause she seemed very unpleasant and in a bad mood. I assumed they pull tips but I felt bad for the bread guy and the water boy doing all the work. Anyways after watching five tables around is come & go with full service I was staring to feel it was personal. Not a god feeling for your special birthday dinner. Anyways we complained to the manager and she comped our drinks. Not sure if that was enough since we paid over $200 for horrible service if lack if it and it took up my entire night. Which my fiancé had to work in the morning and we didn't leave until almost 1am. Don't think I'll be back.

5.0,6/30/2014,"Everything about my meal here was excellent. The decor, the SERVICE (top notch) the food, all of it was excellent. Service: The service here is probably one of the best I've experienced in NY, Philadelphia, Boston or DC. Every waiter was attentive but not overbearing. They came often to refill water and check up on our meal without rushing us out the door. Very courteous and respectful. Great job. Atmosphere: I was impressed they were able to create this space in midtown Manhattan. a rustic and homey feel but still contemporary and clean. Exposed brick and wooden beams exuded charm and character. Felt classy yet relaxed at the same time. Food: ab.so.lute.ly. delicious. Sure, it's a bit pricey but everything is locally sourced and I'm more than happy to support local farmers and businesses. If i had to give one criticism, it would be that i had a side order of ""hand cut fries"" but much of the fries were tiny and it was pretty clear i got the bottom bits of a bag. But the rest of the meal and the dining experience in general vastly made up for it.

Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection. We had the ferns, an artichoke, beets, and squash for appetizers. Every bite was delicious. For entrees we ordered the salmon, the ravioli, and the snapper. All of them were on point. Very simple but with carefully chosen flavors. For dessert we had the salted caramel ice cream sundae and the bowl of strawberries. Again, awesome. I really can't praise this place enough. It's so rare that I like a restaurant this much.

4.0,6/28/2014,"Had a lovely lunch at ABC Kitchen. They have a nice prix fixe lunch for $32 - and best of all, not everyone at the table had to order it! So I went with that special - sweet pea soup, ricotta/egg raviolo with pork ragu, and the salted caramel sundae. The soup was okay but the other two courses were fantastic. The pasta dish was one jumbo sized ravioli stuffed with ricotta and a runny egg yoke - unbelievably good. The salted caramel sundae was also extraordinary - the ice cream itself was salted and then topped with hot fudge, caramel popcorn and peanuts.My mom did not order the prix fixe and instead tried the salmon sashimi toast and the mushroom egg pizza. Unexpectedly, the salmon toast was my favorite dish of the entire meal. Soft pieces of thinly sliced salmon over a scallion mayo type of condiment on crispy delicious sourdough toast! The pizza was a bit soggy and disappointing. Overall, nice experience!",0,0,0,Sol C.,"Cambridge, MA",176,625,950
5.0,6/28/2014,Each & every single time I come here it's as good as the last if not better!The food is simply flavoursome & delicious. Our server swayed us for the salmon sashimi toast as a starter & wow wow wow...it was delicious! It even tasted way more delicious than it looked. All thanks to the snow pea remoulade hiding beneath the salmon. The toasted bread underneath was smoky. & delicious too.Next we had the red snapper & the fried chicken. I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken as it's not the healthiest option but when done well I can't refuse...& at abc kitchen it's done so lightly in a gorgeous butter sauce (sounds bad but it was light & tangy & not swimming in the sauce). Definitely a big portion & balanced out the slightly smaller portion of snapper. The snapper was perfectly cooked sitting on a bed of steamed spinach broth with a hint of some kind of fruit chutney & minimal chilli. When teamed together it was light & fragrant. We couldn't possibly fit in dessert but the lime basil daiquiri is not to be missed. #alwaysdelicious,0,0,0,Nicole E.,"San Francisco, CA",15,270,433

My boyfriend got the sour cherry old fashioned which was crazy strong, but delicious. We moved on to a bottle of red, which my boyfriend chose and it was awesome.Appetizers:Crab toast was simply amazing, wanted more! Mushroom pizza was great considering that I absolutely hate mushrooms. The egg on top was a nice touch.Entrees:My boyfriend had the sea bass which he was in love with and perfectly seasoned. I had the lobster which of course.....was lobster and was seafood heaven in my mouth.Dessert:Ate a lot for our first and second courses, so we got ice cream and a latte for myself. We got the green apple and chocolate mint sorbet and the salted caramel ice cream. The green apple was my fave. They also sent out a mini cupcake and dessert, on the house. Both very very tasty.I wish I could remember the servers names because they were lovely. Had great conversations with one of the back waiters.

Wow, it leaves a bang in you mouth! Slices of deliciously creamy avocado slices with sweet yet spicy carrots. Amazing (& not to mention fresh!).The ravioloo was a special that i'm glad I ordered. I'd eat over & over again if it wasn't so filling. Egg yolk & ricotta cheese enveloped in a large piece of ravioli. Once I sliced it w/ the edge of my fork, the yolk started ozzing out in golden perfection. And w/ that sauteed kale & shredded pork??? BAM!

All of this is on too of a toast and the green fluke may disgust you at first but the first bite of the crunchy toast with the succulent flavors will absolutely drop your jaw. Just order this...We also got the pretzel dusted calamari as our second appetizer. Probably one of the best calamaris I ever had because it wasn't dripping in oil and the breading was still crisp. I recommend this too but if there's something else you have in mind to order, go for it. For our entrees, we got the  wood oven roasted lobster, slowly cooked salmon. I think the lobster is definitely worth getting. You'll notice all the customers around you get this. This says something. The salmon will melt in your mouth but prob won't hurt to try sth else too. The lobster and fluke dish made me want to come back but so much with the salmon.The chocolate cake with malted chocolate ganache with toasted marshmallow icing finished the night. Our waitress mentioned their homemade icecream flavors were popular but I was in the moor for chocolate. Very good, not too heavy than it sounds, moisty cake, unique due to the marshmallow which balances the sweetness of the chocolate. Again, I really liked it but I want to try something else next time.

1.0,5/19/2014,"Having been here a handful of times, I've tried most things on the menu and the standout is the lobster, by far.  It was moist and had a lovely smokiness to it.  My last experience was pretty subpar.  Aside from the lobster (which is always awesome), a number of other dishes were poorly balanced, and too acidic.  It's also a shame they got rid of their cauliflower dish (winter only).What was particularly absurd the last time I came (a late lunch on a weekday) was the maitre d told me they had no tables and were full at the bar, so I decided to stop by ABC cocina on the other side of the restaurant.  Walking through the restaurant, I could see at least 30% of the tables were empty (and remained empty during my lunch).  Luckily, the server at the bar in the back (which was also empty) happily accommodated me there. Now I know ABC kitchen tends to think of itself as quite the scene, but for locals, we dont need our restaurants to act like third tier meatpacking clubs.  Albeit slightly better dressed, the maitre d was on a power trip not so dissimilar from that of a washed up bouncer.",2,3,0,Kevin G.,"Manhattan, NY",83,36,4
4.0,5/19/2014,"I had always wanted to try ABC Kitchen per my best friend's wish to eat there since she's moved to the city but getting a reservation was always a pain since it is advised to make one pretty far in advanced. We decided to pop in on a Sunday morning for an early brunch to give it a shot - luckily they had a table for 2 with a 10 minute wait!----- Atmosphere -----The interior is very beautiful with a rustic touch. The servers wear plaid shirts and jeans will gives it a very casual vibe. I really enjoyed the restaurant although it was a little loud since it was crowded during brunch. They seated us at a teeny tiny table made of the trunk of a tree that would better serve as a side table as opposed to a dining table. I felt bad for the servers since our utensils kept falling off of our table from the lack of space when they were making room for our dishes. That is the only reason why I'm giving 4/5 stars because I don't think they should use that table to seat guests. Overall it was a very pleasant experience and the aesthetics were wonderful.----- Food -----Between the two of us, we split the Market Fruit Plate, the Scrambed Eggs with Crispy Potatoes, and the French Toast with Caramelized Apples and Cinnamon. I love french toast and they nailed it on the head with this one - it's the best french toast I've ever had!! The scrambled eggs were perfect and melted in my mouth. The potatoes were wholesome and crispy which really brought the meal together. The fruit plate was very fresh and delicious. I was really impressed and loved the food! I will definitely have to come back for dinner!----- Service -----Pretty good service. The servers were really attentive and checked in on us from time to time.I highly recommend ABC Kitchen!

4.0,5/19/2014,I had heard nothing but great things about ABC  Kitchen before dining there- and great is what they delivered!We ordered a bunch of dishes all of which were very delicious. I loved the whipped ricotta with rhubarb jam served with grilled bread. Sweet and smooth went well with the crusty bread. (Only my piece of bread was quite burnt)The kale salad was light but very spicy- so ask to hold on some of the Serrano chilies. The roasts carrot and avocado salad was interesting and very good. Great mix of flavors and textures. The tomato and mozzarella pizza was also good. Loved the sauce. The artichoke was served cold- so it wasn't my favorite- but the tangy sauce it's served with was quite yummy. Finally- the chocolate mint sorbet was probably the best I've ever had!

I prefer a light batter and because it was flaky, it wasn't drenched in oil. The chicken was very tender and juicy. The pizza crust was thin and chewy. I wished the farm egg was cooked a little more.

I called in 3 weeks prior and got a table for 6 on a saturday afternoon at 12:30.  To start I ordered the sweet pea soup with carrots which was not well done. It lacked flavor and felt like they dropped a few peas in a tasteless broth. My entree was much better, I ordered the Kasha and bowtie meatball pasta. This was delicious and the Kasha was a great addition to the dish. The dessert was the highlight of the meal, we ordered the popcorn sundae. It was prepared with salted caramel ice cream and the popcorn added a nice crunch.

5.0,4/30/2014,"While a dinner reservation here is pretty challenging, you absolutely need to make it a point to visit ABC Kitchen in The Flatiron District at some dining point, where it's lunch, brunch or dinner. This Jean-Georges restaurant is everything you'd expect it to be from him, nothing shy of amazing. I'm pretty obsessed with the aesthetic here too, it's rustic, meets French countryside, meets woodland nymph. Food wise, everything here is locally sourced, organic, and, well, delicious.To start, as a snack for the table, we ordered their House Cut Fries. These are so amazing. They're perfectly seasoned, crisp herbs and rosemary really add a nice dimension to the already tasty, crisp fries.Then, I went for their prix fixe lunch menu and, for my first course I had the Line Caught Tuna Sashimi (marinated with ginger and mint). Amazing. The dish has a little bit of spice to it with a nice hint of the ginger. The tuna itself is perfect and seems to almost melt in your mouth.Next, for my entree I had their Veggie Burger (minted yogurt and housemade whole wheat pita). I loved this. First off, the burger and pita are super substantial and hearty. The veggie burger is housemade, of course, and lightly dipped in an egg bater and quickly fried, giving it a nice crisp exterior. The minted yogurt was especially nice with this too, adding a nice creaminess to the meatiness of the burger. I really loved the carrot slaw here too, they had the nicest balance in texture between being tender and crisp, and lightly dressed in an olive oil. Then, for dessert, I had the Salted Caramel Ice Cream Sundae (candied peanuts & popcorn, whipped cream, chocolate sauce). Holy $&*!. This was so incredible, it's basically heaven in a bowl. The salted caramel ice cream is rich, and silky, and almost has a burnt sugar appeal. On top is a housemade whipped cream, light and airy and not even all that sweet, balancing well with the rest of the sweet dish. The chocolate sauce on the bottom is warm, and rich and chocolaty and almost fudge like. Then, you basically have a homemade crackerjack box confecting the sundae. It's all ridiculous and insanely delicious.",1,0,0,Katherine S.,"Manhattan, NY",160,257,919
2.0,4/30/2014,"I am giving 2 stars for this restaurant because the food/kitchen/dish was not cleaned and I suffered from diarrhea... So I came here with my girlfriend for lunch yesterday. It was crowded but the ambiance was nice. After being seated, we ordered the crispy shrimp salad and our waitress suggested us to order the mushroom pizza with egg which we did.Let's start off with the crispy shrimp salad, the shrimp has a little spice in it and was fresh, but the salad itself was pretty ordinary. The vinaigrette dressing you can find in any Japanese restaurant. It's also a bit pricey for a salad that has about 10 small crispy shrimps for the price of $25.Mushroom pizza with egg - this is definitely something special. They put an egg in the center of the pizza, so when you slice your pizza out, the egg yolk breaks and spread over your pizza. 1 star for this creative idea. But other than the egg, the pizza tasted just okay, I've had better pizza in other places like Adrienne's or TAPPO.I wanted to give a higher rating for this restaurant as the ambiance was nice and server was attentive, but the food/kitchen was obviously not clean and I suffered from diarrhea yesterday night.. After reading over the reviews, I found out someone wrote a review on this restaurant regarding food poisoning as well!! My girlfriend also had a bad stomachache yesterday, so it's really not just me.

5.0,4/28/2014,"ABC Kitchen is an American restaurant in NYC that sports a modern, fresh, and inventive menu.  With so many great restaurants in NYC, ABC Kitchen stood out for me as a perfect combination of an outstanding menu coupled with a great atmosphere.  It also helps that it's one of Jean George's restaurant.My Overall Rating - 5 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)Atmosphere - What I love about NYC is that most places don't have much of a restaurant ""front"" - unless you're in Times Square.  ABC Kitchen essentially has a pair of white doors as an entry, and if you didn't know that you'll miss it.  Once you open the door you enter a beautiful restaurant.  Up front is a bar and waiting area.  There is wood everywhere - white tables & chairs.  It has an elegant, rustic charm.  You know if this much attention is placed on the interior, the menu will match it.  1 Star.Service - Superb.  We seemed to have multiple servers, and our main server was very friendly and helped with menu recommendations.  Also, we were not rushed, even though they were getting busy.  They didn't press us to just get our orders in, instead they wanted to make sure were getting what we wanted.  They even split their famous carrot/cucumber salad for us, cleared the table after each course, etc.  Fine dining with even better service.  1 Star.Food - The menu is so fresh and unique.  The carrot & cucumber salad is the BEST salad I'd ever eaten.  The carrot is marinated and cooked, and has the texture of a protein in a salad - tender and hearty even.  Also amazing was their crab toast.  The crab tasted so fresh, but the star was the toast, which had held the crab for the initial crunch bite, and then softened as you enjoyed your bite.  My main course was a ravioli in a pork ragu.  The ravioli (single) was amazing because inside it was an egg!  Breaking into the ravioli was like breaking into a sunny side up egg.  I've never seen or eating pasta with this technique.  Desert was the caramel ice cream sundae, which was served over chocolate & caramel popcorn.  I was so full, but I still devoured the dessert.  One last note, their fresh cocktails (nonalcoholic) are as good as the food.  I had a cucumber line soda that was so fresh & delicious I would buy a case if they bottled it.  From start to finish the meal was flawless.  2 Stars.Will I Return? - Yes.  ABC Kitchen not only has a seasonal menu, but it's a menu where you want to order everything.  My next trip to NYC will no doubt include a trip back.  I can't wait to see what's next on the menu.  1 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.",11,7,8,Trinh T.,"Irving, TX",763,577,1788

5.0,4/26/2014,"Must thank my fellow BPB Yelper Brenda P for putting ABC on my radar. My husband & I had a fabulous meal here on a recent NY trip. I also must compliment whoever answers the phone when I called to make a reservation.  Calling just a few days ahead, there were no tables available. However, the reservationist went out of her way to ask if she could make a reservation for me not only at any Jean George restaurant, but any restaurant in the area!  Great training or she was just super nice!Without a reservation we arrived at 530 and were seated at a bar table. In order to try as many things as possible we ordered 4 apps & 2 mains. I know, gluttony!  Our first app, the Spring Pea Soup was probably the weakest for me. The peas were a little hard. Also, it was luke warn. Perhaps it was supposed to be like this was but I really like my soups hot. The Housemade Ricotta with Rhubarb Compote was very unusual but very good:  smooth, tasty ricotta with tangy rhubarb, served with grilled bread. Even my husband who does not usually try new things loved the rhubarb. Crab Toast came next. It seems relatively simple, a crab mixture on toast, however it was a burst of flavor in your mouth (just a tad too salty but hey, I would not hesitate to order again!). The Ricotta Cavatelli with Peas, Mint, & Smoked Bacon was excellent! The flavors melded perfectly together with the bacon giving it a great smokiness & the ricotta providing decadent creaminess. I could have been done then but we did order 2 mains. My husband ordered the Slowly Cooked Salmon with Creamy Favas. I don't  usually order salmon when I go out because to me salmon always tastes the same. This salmon however, had an ultra delicate flavor. It barely tasted like salmon. The fava purée was different & delish. I had the Smoked Pork Confit, Smoked Bacon Marmalade, & Grilled Ramps. What really makes this dish tasty is the ooey gooey marmalade.  With chunks of smoked bacon, how can it not be scrumptious? Ramps are in season but they did not add much to the dish.  Needless to say, we had no room for dessert, even though I was dying to try the caramel sundae. Next time!Service was friendly enough. Some dishes came right away and some we had to wait longer for.  The decor is absolutely lovely & different; you really have to see it!Since the menu is seasonal, some of the dishes I was hoping to try (like the Suckling Pig!),?were not available. Still, although, everything was not perfect, most dishes were original, delicious, & on point....a great experience.  I welcome a chance to return to try the other dishes!",5,2,4,Joan L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",678,971,6603

4.0,4/24/2014,"I've been there twice. My experiences were good but not spectacular. The first time our reservation was at 10 PM. It was too late for me to eat so I only had their kale salad. It was ok. Actually it wasn't that good. I didn't like the way they handled the kale. The leaves were still very stiff and I've definitely had better elsewhere. I didn't want to judge the restaurant based on that one experience, so I went back again and the second time was much better.We had kabocha squash toast as an appetizer and I loved it. The squash had this perfect blend of saltiness and sweetness and the toast was fresh and chewy. It was just great. For entree, I had some kind of fish dish. I don't quite remember because it has been a while since my last visit. I just remember it was good, but nothing special. For dessert, we ordered the salted caramel ice cream sundae with caramel popcorn and a dessert with fig in it. they were both delicious. I love figs so I preferred that one over the salted caramel ice cream.One thing I love about this place is that they use a lot of fresh local ingredients. I'm a big sucker for that. However, I'm not a big fan of the decor. This is a personal opinion but to me it just looks like they tried too hard. Overall it's a nice restaurant and I would come back.

2.0,4/21/2014,"This is generally a terrific restaurant with wonderful, fresh food and excellent wines by the glass.  I dine frequently at the bar, and on April 8th had invited one of my senior clients from a major newspaper to join me.The service is generally as terrific as the food and wine, but on this evening is was so embarrassing that I felt I had to post this review.  The female bartender working the street side of the bar was not only condescending, but grossly inattentive.My client ordered the Kabinett (as it was listed on the menu), but she kept correcting that is was a Riesling.  He did not understand what she was doing at first, and kept repeating Kabinett because he thought she misunderstood him, and because officially not all Kabinetts are Rieslings and their might have been another wine listed as Riesling on the menu.  This went on for a few rounds until he caught on that she was simply acting important, embarrassing him along the way and ultimately infuriating him.In addition, when we arrived, the bar was fully seated so we chose to order several courses in the standing-only area of the bar.  We had asked the bartender to kindly notify us if another set of guests closed out their tab, which she agreed to do.  Imagine when we looked around halfway through our meal and discovered that not 1 but 2 couples had vacated her section -- with no word from her.  When we inquired after this, she claimed that the other bartenders had dropped both checks without her knowing  -- in her own section.On top of this, it was impossible to get attention/service from her during our meal, despite the fact that we ran up a sizeable tab. We were grateful for the other male bartender who swooped in to help when he was able.    My client made it clear he was very disappointed with the evening because of the mar the service had on the night.   This was embarrassing to me, and I was embarrassed by the way two respectful professionals had been treated.   The only reason we even left a tip that night was because it was likely the bartenders pooled tips, and we did not want to disrespect the male bartender who had been so helpful.",0,0,0,L M.,"New York, NY",0,81,0

2.0,4/20/2014,"I'm writing this review now, a year later, because I just remembered the anniversary of my food poisoning from this restaurant. I hope they have improved their cleanliness because 3 of my friends and I got food poisoning from this ""upscale"" restaurant. We had diarrhea, vomiting, body aches, fever for days and some of the bacteria stayed in our system for months, our digestion never quite the same again. The DOH took our stool samples but we never heard back from them- the case probably closed- I wonder why and how...The manager at first tried to suggest other ways we all got ill but we wouldn't have it. In the end, he offered a free meal which was a nice extension from them towards us but we never took it. The funny thing is that I have eaten from many carts and smaller ""dirty"" restaurants which are constantly on watch from DOH but have never been food poisoned there but yet ABC-K such a famous joint by a famous chef made us sick. Looks like no one else on yelp had any issues which is great. Wonder what the hell went wrong with our servers/cooks/busboys..????Oh, onto the food. (This is a review of the food without bias from the food poisoning). It was pretty good but more about the ambiance. There are minor interesting things but nothing warranting 4 or 5 stars. This is just another over-hyped place where marketing wins and people who want to see and be seen go- the blind following the blind. From the dishes we had- chicken liver toast, fig pizza and some other things- I can't imagine higher than 3 stars. Service was okay, nothing too memorable. I'd prefer Red Cat, Good Fork, Salt & Fat or TRAIF which have a greater attention to the intricacies of flavors, textures and presentation.",4,3,0,beverly c.,"New York, NY",14,130,24
4.0,4/20/2014,"We did not realize there are two separate ABC's at the same location ..ABC KITCHEN and ABC COCINA....We now also know that open table reservations are not accurate  anymore.. The night we were at ABC KITCHEN 8PM on a Sunday, it was half empty. The menu in both places is also different. Get the reservations over the phone and to us it seemed like the COCINA menu was more interesting. Beautiful Ambiance in a Huge place (we even saw a couple of baby carriages being strolled around).

Their fried chicken is probably the best fried chicken I've ever had. SUPER JUICY!!! The crust was very light and crunchy in a way that I've never had on fried chicken before. Not to mention it's organic. Definitely worth the try. My friends had pasta and pizza, and they were both delicious. I would probably order every single item on the menu because they all sounded so good. Just wish I had room to try some appetizers. Next time for sure!

4.0,4/18/2014,"I have been wanting to check out this restaurant for a while. There is so much buzz around it and I was hoping it be a let down. It was not!When my gf asked to meet for drinks somewhere and suggested ABC Kitchen i jumped at the opportunity. They have the entire menu available at the bar which is great. I got 2 drinks. The first one was the ginger margarita. So good! it packed a punch and had this ginger salt around the rim i loved. My next drink , since i couldnt decide between these two was the basil daiquiri. This as well was strong and delicious. When i return i wouldnt be able to decide between the two and probably order both again.... yes i like my drinksWe shared the mushroom, oregano and farm egg pizza. It was not too big, perfect for 2 people to share and was delicious. I cant wait to return to order this again and many other things as everything on the menu sounds great.",2,1,1,Jessica H.,"Manhattan, NY",348,331,55
5.0,4/18/2014,"I adore ABC Kitchen...this ultra-stylish, farm to table restaurant is so pretty and the food is even better.   The commute to NYC is a bitch though. Jean Georges, will you please bring ABC to LA and be my best friend? Pwease?!To start: Crab toast, Ramp toast, heck... they could put a chicken beak on toast and I bet it would be delicious, just like these 2 beauties. Both had perfect textures atop a piece of crusty bread, fantastic flavor profiles and both left me wanting more.  Another good pick: the Tuna Sashimi with ginger and mint.  So clean and refreshing!Next: Ricotta ravioli.  Unbelievably delicate pasta, a velvety smooth filling and a lovely light tomato sauce. I gave the dishwasher a break and took the liberty of cleaning my own plate.  One of the biggest surprises was the mushroom pizza w/ farm egg.  First off, if you don't like mushrooms, you will probably want to skip over this part, and if you're at a table with someone who orders it, you should step outside.  It's a complete mushroom overload.... like, mushrooms on top of mushrooms giving birth to baby mushrooms. And with a runny egg, it's just WOW. Decadent, earthy mushroom egg-stravaganza. My favorite part? The whole wheat crust.  I'm a whole wheat kinda girl and WW is usually not as good as the white version.  But this crust was so chewy, airy and delicious, I was so happily surprised.They have an exciting drink menu both alcoholic and non, and service is spot-on. While you're there, you'll probably even see a celebrity or two. The dining room set up makes it easy to to eavesdrop on their conversations ;)  Everything is just so impressive and brilliantly styled.  And if you see something you like, well you can buy it for a ridiculous amount of money next door since everything is sourced from the fab ABC Carpet and Home... another store I'd like to have in LA!

The food was again delicious, especially the tuna sashimi and the scallops, and the service was much, much better. My only problem was one assistant server who rushed us with our appetizers. We still had almost half of the appetizers remaining, and she bussed our plates. When I told her we were still working on them, she said she was just making room for the entrees, which was kind of annoying, since she took our appetizer plates away and made it awkward to continue eating them.

Fish was perfectly cooked in a super yummy light broth, with the chili flakes bringing a nice touch of heat. I would order this dish again hands down. The ravioli was superb as well. I should mention that while the pizza was good, I probably wouldn't order that again. I felt the composed dishes were much more rave-worthy. I had a lemonade cocktail that was great.

We made reservations and were seated promptly at a gorgeous wooden round table, which looked like a tree trunk. The atmosphere is beautiful, rustic-chic, and a nice overall clean appearance. The entrance wasn't very easily visible from the street, but keep an eye  out for the small white hanging sign next to the white doors. Our waitress was awesome -- she even charged our cell phone for us!  To start my meal, I ordered an Ithaca Flower Power beer -- something I don't often find on restaurant menus but I was glad to see a craft beer selection! While we perused the menu, we had some bread and olive oil to munch on. I ordered off the prix fixe menu ($32) and got parsnip soup (creamy, but maybe I'm not ready for parsnip -- a little too zesty for my liking), followed by the ricotta & egg yolk raviolo atop a bed of spinach and pork ragu (outstanding and very filling), but the real winner of this meal was the dessert! You owe it to yourself to get the salted caramel sundae. Definitely share-worthy as well. Two scoops of salted caramel ice cream on top of chocolate fudge, and surrounded by caramel popcorn. It was absolutely sinful.We were so pleased with this restaurant. We were meeting for a family luncheon and spent about 3-3.5 hours there and never felt rushed or abandoned.

I found ABC Kitchen via a Google search (looking for healthy eats near Madison Square Garden) and was greatly impressed with the introduction on their website. This is no ordinary restaurant. If you are aware and conscious - about your body, health, planet, humanely treated animals used for food, and are inspired by ""doing the right thing,"" this restaurant is ALL about that.  Here's a snippet from their website:""We are passionately committed to offering the freshest, safest ingredients, presenting a seasonal menu, that is locally focused and globally artistic, and  cultivating a healthy relationship on our tables and for the planet. ABC Kitchen & Michelin star Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten invite you to enjoy our award-winning cuisine, curated in alignment with the farm-to-table movement.  Our menu is free of pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, insecticides, antibiotics, hormones, is GMO-free, and naturally and humanely sourced from regional farmers and fair trade cooperatives, celebrating community and the future of the slow food movement. Our atmospheric elements, under ABC Home curation, feature environmentally conscious stories, honoring the preservation of the arts and global sustainability.""We showed up with no reservation on a Tuesday night at 5:30 and even though the tables weren't yet full, by the time my boyfriend and I sat at the bar and were served our food some 15 minutes later, the tables were quickly filling with folks who had made reservations (we hadn't, but were offered seats at the bar which was just perfect). From the outside sidewalk, this place can be so easily overlooked. In fact, we questioned the cab driver when he told us we'd arrived. Don't let the outside appearance fool you.I asked the bartender his favorite meals and taking his advice, ordered a really WONDERFUL roasted cauliflower topped with onion, walnuts, and a fried egg (see photo below). Food and drink is pricey here but I feel is definitely worth the treat while in town. More than anything, I LOVE what this place stands for and the example they are setting with their farm-to-table movement. It's really aesthetically pretty too. I'm so glad I found ABC Kitchen.

To my surprise we got in without a reservation, although not able to sit in the pretty dining room we had a table near the bar. The ambiance gives off a rustic yet trendy vibe, with the lighting and mismatched china. I enjoyed reading about where everything was sourced from. Even though we had a bar table, the service was impeccable. Our server gave his recommendations and described all dishes with vivid detail. We started off with squash toast a recommendation of the waiter and the cauliflower. Both were great and provided sweet and savory flavors along with different textures. There were a lot of options I wish I could have tried more. I also wanted to try to the pizzas too...for next time. For dinner we had the pork and the red snapper, the presentation and flavors were great. I felt like both dishes had flavors mixed together that I would never think of and were meals that I could definitely not cook myself at home. For dessert we had the Salted Caramel Ice Cream sundae with popcorn and roasted peanuts as suggested by the waiter and which I had read about. It was good, the ice cream was whole made and again all the flavors mixed with the textures were yummy; but I wish I tried something else, because I was not blown away.

After all this is a part of the ABC furniture & decor store. On to the food - as a girl I can only eat so much. Everything is huge heavy huge. I had the famous butternut squash/ ricotta toast. It was yummy - the sweet and savory mixed perfectly well on an over-ly buttered toast. Wish it was not as heavy because this prevented me from trying their other food. I also got the lime-rosemary homemade soda. I love places that offer such drinks - especially at lunch when I don't want to drink alcohol and too bored of standard non-alc drinks.I did a cookie platter dessert to go - it had 5 different types of cookies. All for $10!

3.0,4/3/2014,"Surrounding ABC carpet and home lie Dan Kluger's ABC Kitchen and Cocina. Reservations would generally be a good idea, but I decided to try my luck with walk-ins and put my name down at both and start the race. Ultimately, the wait time was approximately the same, so I decided to go to the more famed ABC Kitchen. The concept behind ABC Kitchen seems simple enough, turn high quality ingredients into simple and pleasing dishes. As with all market-to-table restaurants, everything looks like a solid option but there's not really anything that really captures the eye. After glancing at the menu, my SO and I decided to go for our usual 1 appetizer, 2 entree approach. The appetizer list is long and enticing compared to the entree, and I would encourage larger groups to splurge more on them. The crab toast was outstanding. The pieces of crab on top were delicious and I found myself dreaming of more. My SO unhelpfully ordered the burger, but nonetheless, it was a satisfying burger. For $24, I would expect a burger to be much more than that, but I suppose that's what you get. I found myself ordering the sea bass after doing some research. It was delicious, especially mixed in with the spinach it was served on top of. However, this review may be inherently flawed. The ingredients were delicious, but I couldn't help but wonder to myself if I could cook this at home. I came away satisfied, but not impressed. Everything was too simple, but that is the point of a market-to-table restaurant. ABC Kitchen is definitely one of the better embodiments of that concept out there, but it fails to add that wow factor. 3 stars.

My boyfriend and I went for a quick meal, we split the crab toast, kale salad, and the burger. While the crab toast was our favorite part- there wasn't one complaint about anything that touched the table.    The service and the atmosphere are what REALLY made this meal so memorable. ABC Kitchen is probably one of the most trendy, must have's in the city (along side with the cronut) and it did not disappoint. The environmentally friendly decor matched the fresh and healthy ingredients. So simple and well done.Lastly, the service... you'd think a restaurant like this where you can only make a reservation months in advance would be a little pretentious and not very personable due to how busy it is. We were taken care of by Dennis and he is what made the meal. It is rare then when you tell a waiter that you're splitting food, they will do it for you, especially in NYC. He was so knowledgable and really engaged in genuine conversation about the restaurant and the food. He just really let a good impression on the whole experience. It's obvious to say we will be back.

5.0,4/2/2014,"Wow. Yes. Hell Yeah. Probably the most memorable meal I've had. I was super stoked to have gotten reservations via open table for lunch. I made them way in advance to ensure a spot during our NYC visit. Walking in was like walking into a magical wooded fairyland. The décor is unlike anything I've seen. Rustic, chic, modern, romantic. It feels almost fancy, but without the feeling of pretentiousness you see at other ""happening"" places. Our server was friendly and helpful. Started off with the carrot and avocado salad which was simply magnificent. We told them we'd be sharing, so they took the liberty of splitting our dish, which was appreciated. So many textures and flavors going on. This is a must order!We also split the Akaushi Burger. The freshest, juiciest piece of meat I think I've experienced in a burger. Bun was divine. Pickled jalepenos? Yes, I think I'll bathe in them. Homemade fries cooked to perfection and didn't resemble any grease or over salting like every other restaurant. Delish.The Salted Caramel Ice Cream sundae with popcorn and roasted peanuts. Wow. Rich, decadent, the salted caramel ice cream was the perfect, cool compliment to the richness of the sauce. What an amazing dessert. Not to be missed. I had forgotten when I made reservations I noted ""Birthday"" in special comments, as it was my husband's belated birthday lunch. The server came out with small homemade chocolate cupcake with ""happy birthday"" written in chocolate on the plate along with a candle. What a nice surprise. Service was perfection throughout the meal. Waters filled, not overly annoying, wiped crumbs off the table in between courses, changed out the silverware, folded up my napkin when I went to the restroom. The mismatched plaid shirts the servers wore added a casual, hipster feel amongst the elegant, yet rustic ambience. I was like a kid in a candy store just staring at each table with mismatched china, kitchen towels as napkins, reclaimed wooden tables mixed with modern pieces. The unexpected light features, glass shelved wall, the fresh flowers all added such elegance to the experience, but the menus clipped to cardboard added a flair of whimsy. I was surprised to see how reasonably priced it was, too. Especially when a place of this caliber prides themselves on local and organic ingredients. What a tremendous value.

Our serve was friendly, had a good sense of humor, was present at just the right times (and not too many times), and was very knowledgeable about the food, able to guide is in the right direction according to our preferences. The other staff was subtle and highly efficient. I noticed many times that I had a full glass of water and hadn't even noticed someone fill it - impressive! The place itself is gorgeous. When I first walked in and sat down, taking in the size of the place and the number of people in it, I expected it to be noisy and uncomfortable. But I was wrong. It was a bit loud, but not overbearing. The place has a nice, intimate feel. And on to the most important part... the food was delicious. I had to make a tough decision between the Crab Toast and the Tuna Sushimi. I ultimately went with the Crab Toast and it was to die for! I was worried it would be small, but it was not; it was large and filling. There were generous pieces of crab and the flavors of the lemon and aioli just made the whole thing melt in my mouth! For my entree, I had the ricotta cavatelli with fennel sausage, broccoli rabe, and meyer lemon. This was also delicious and hearty. The fennel was not overwhelming, which was something I had been concerned about. The textures and flavors of this dish were extremely satisfying!

I'm a bit of a snob since I've had the opportunity to go to a lot of fancy schmancy restaurants like Eleven Madison Park, Park Avenue [insert season here], etc.Sea bass: not that flavorful; I prefer Chilean sea bass... is Chilean sea bass just more moist and tender in general so it's an unfair comparison?Butternut squash: it's okay; I can make the same quality myselfBrussel sprouts: uhhh, these were charred/burnt!

This is the one item on the menu I keep coming back to and is always so great. anyways- here a breakdown of the food that I got last night:housemade ricotta, cranberry compote and grilled bread - GET THIS. you will not regret it. this was probably the best dish i had all night. roasted beets with housemade yogurt- another one of my favorites- yougurt, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and fresh beets on top. awesome combo.line caught tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint- eh. could pass on this. it was 4 or 5 very very tiny and thin slices of tuna and honestly wasnt that impressionable. skip this and get the two dishes i mentioned above.roast carrot and avocado salad, crunchy seeds, sour cream and citrus- this was fine too.good combo but didnt really blow me out the water. roasted cauliflower, onion and walnut crumbs, fried egg- YUM. not sure what spices they added but the entire thing was delish. i really liked the egg on top too. definitely try this. roasted brussels sprouts with mustard vinaigrette- i love brussels sprout, so this wasnt a hard dish to love. the highlight was the mustard vinaigrette, though. really great sauce. roasted sweet potatoes, cipollinis, cashews and maple syrup- this was good, but not as good as I had expected it to be. tasted a little dry. chocolate cake malted chocolate ganache, toasted marshmallow icing- honestly, i kinda expected this to be more rich. definitely could've skipped this. the cake/frosting werent that spectacular.keep in mind though that ALL of these dishes were shared between me and a girl friend. and no left overs. sooooo neeedless to say, AMAZING meal. definitely struggled to finish towards the end but was NOT able to stop eating. oh, the bar area is super cute and i think this could be a great great date spot as well.

4.0,3/23/2014,"Made it to ABC Kitchen last night for quite a nice dining experience.  I certainly didn't have to go to Five Guys afterwards to feel satisfied like I did after eating at Fish on Bleecker St (see my review).  That bit of unpleasantness aside, and being someone who hates the majority of these shitty Yelp reviews that don't say anything other than ""I liked it"" or ""the decor was good"" and giving a rating (if you are one of those people, offense was intended- get your fucking shit together), please see below for a detailed breakdown:Decor:Being idiots, girlfriend and I actually entered through ABC Cocina, which is behind ABC Kitchen.  When we made it, it looks something like a rustic European countryside courtyard.  There are a bunch of chandeliers and the walls/overall aesthetic was not unlike a vineyard in Europe or Napa.  The tables and chairs look intended for a high-end outdoor picnic.  The chairs are quite stiff and not very comfortable for a long meal though.(Disclaimer: I don't want to be misleading- I don't really give a shit about decor.  My philosophy is to pay for good food, not expensive looking stuff that I will look at for 2 hours max and does me no tangible benefit.  I just included this section for completeness, but it never affects final rating unless decor somehow detracts.)Service:The service was quite excellent, as you would expect from a Jean-Georges restaurant.  Quora has posts that detail what good service means.  Two highlights that I have taken to heart: 1) great service should be seen, not heard, and 2) great service should always be proactive- e.g., someone should be observing tables discreetly and should come right away if you make eye contact.  1) really means that when you go out to eat with people, you probably want to talk to your companions and not the wait staff.  The wait staff should not bother you or make fake conversation, but should be able to talk in-depth about the menu or engage in conversation if the customer requests it.  ABC Kitchen admirably fulfilled both.  The only minor blip was a slight delay in getting my check, as I asked for my check before a neighboring table but they received theirs first (we had the same waitress).  There is nothing I hate more than being finished with the meal and waiting to pay (hopefully some mobile payments company achieves scale and annihilate this problem soon).  However, this small inconvenience was not nearly enough to mar the otherwise impeccable service.Food:The total, including tax and tip, was ~$158 and we were extremely full and satisfied.  FYI, ABC Kitchen's whole theme is organic farm-to-table.+House-made soda: ginger-lime flavored, with ice.  Really good, the only complaint here is the lime flavor / tartness overpowered the ginger a bit.+Organic ice tea: super vanilla, as expected.  Don't know why girlfriend ordered this when for $3 more she could have enjoyed an excellent house-made soda in her choice of flavor (sigh).+Organic pear and apple salad: unexpectedly excellent.  The apple was sliced raw, while the pear was toasted and a bit charred.  Together with the greens, some pecan, and the excellent goats milk cheese (brie), the combination was quite spectacular.  Just slightly too much vinegar in the taste.  [As an aside, I never order any salads except at nicer places.  Ordinary salads are just some greens together with some shitty dressing/cheeses, definitely not worth money- spend it on something you can't make at home.]+Mushroom, parmesan, oregano, and farm egg pizza: absolutely amazing.  Ingredients come together very well and the runny egg yolk over it (probably cracked raw at the end of the pizza cooking) really melds things together and adds to it.  The pizza is a great value at $18 and is actually quite filling.+Black sea-bass: this was just ok.  The entree comes essentially submerged in some kind of liquid; the fish is surrounded by a bed of roasted potatoes and what seemed similar to bok-choy.  While the bok-choy and the fish were somewhat forgettable, the potatoes were the highlight of the dish- perfectly roasted and absorbing all the flavor of everything else while cooking.+Pork confit: this was really good, but I expected greatness which wasn't achieved.  Perhaps it has something to due with the sweetness of the sauce- it was sweet not in a BBQ or Asian-rib glaze way, but in a candy way.  Doesn't mix well with meat.  Vegetables were forgettable.+Chocolate cake: toasted marshmallow instead of cream on top.  Girlfriend thought it was phenomenal, but I thought it was just decent.  I actually like chocolate cake, so was a bit let down.  Certainly not bad.Overall this restaurant was quite excellent and I was torn between giving it the fifth star or leaving it at four.  Although I'm still a bit torn, ultimately the entrees lacked the extra exceptionalness to push it over.  They were merely very good, but not great.  Still, an excellent overall experience.  Going back soon.  Meow.",4,5,2,John Q.,"Philadelphia, PA",423,12,3

The food brings you to the happy place. The keep it coming kind of happy place, where you leave your meal fulfilled. get the suckling pig (that seems pretty consistent on the menu). It was damn good. tender, flavorful, filling, comforting, rich, delicious. Its hard to discuss specific things on the menu because it changes seasonally, but there isn't anything you can go wrong with. This is why I've come back so often. Everything is fresh, balanced and well cooked. There are some flavors that are explored that you may not always get in some restaurants. For example, one raw fish dish had a particular hot sauce /oil drizzled on it. The flavor was from the Caribbean, might have been a scotch bonnet, but it thought it was great because it reminded me of the ""pepper sauce"" my grandmother and aunts made, but done a modern way.  Overall, I don't really think it matters what you get, just get.",0,0,0,Regina H.,"East Elmhurst, NY",61,15,5

It was wholesome and flavorfull.- Chanterell Mushroom Spaghetti was a failure. The Spaghetti was over cooked and there was a guacamole like sauce that was overly pungent with rosemary that just ruined the dish.-Black Sea Bass was OK.

Highly recommended!My first visit was with a large group from work. We ordered one of everything and nothing was disappointing! My husband and I came here shortly after and shared a fantastic meal! To begin we shared some starters.  The shaved raw fluke, crushed olives, lemon and chilies and the line caught tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint dishes are the perfect balance of fresh, light and savory tastes. Great start to the meal. I think I could eat this everyday and be happy.When then split the mushrooms, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza. I'm not a huge fan of egg on pizza but this was executed so well, I wanted to eat the entire thing by myself.But I'm glad I didn't as our final course we split was the ricottacavatelli,fennel sausage,broccolirabe and meyer lemon pasta.

I brought my brother here for his birthday and we were debating between this place or a nearby steakhouse...very happy with our choice. Pricing may seem expensive but won't once you receive your food.Calamari is crispy but not overcooked and is delicious with their housemade habanero hot sauce. I had the black sea bass...the broth was so good I was considering drinking it! The fish itself was soft and flavorful, but the akin had a little crunch to it. The spinach and small potatoes were sitting in the broth and really soaked up the taste. My brother had the cheeseburger and was equally impressed (I thought the Patty part was much thicker than I usually see). I stole a few of his fries and could instantly taste the truffle oil and the rosemary.We both left feeling full but not stuffed. Great portion sizes. I usually worry that really expensive places with unique items will have small portions. This place had enough for you to clean your plate and not feel guilty or cheated.We didn't get to taste these items but saw them on others plates and thought they looked fantastic: fried chicken, seasonal donuts, lobster, raw scallop appetizer, cooked scallop entree.",0,0,0,Jhia L.,"Manhattan, NY",10,19,53
4.0,3/11/2014,"Despite the fact that I had already made my way over to ABC Kitchen for brunch, I couldn't turn down the invitation to try it again for dinner. Thus, I found myself back in the whimsical, semi-ethereal dining room on a Sunday evening, looking forward to trying a different selection of plates for the night.I'll avoid repeating what my previous review already covered in terms of decor and the philosophy behind the food served, but it's worth noting (again) the importance the restaurant places on utilizing fresh, organic ingredients and taking advantage of the farm-to-table concept as much as possible. Our group was able to order a variety of plates and share a few of them, so I'll simply dive into the specific plates:The Whole Wheat Mushroom Pizza should not be missed, and is easily shareable between any number of people. The pizza crust is substantial and crisp, and the melted parmesan cheese on top is complimented with mushrooms, oregano, and a barely-cooked farm egg in the center. The addition of the egg is ingenious, adding a certain richness to each bite, although it's rather difficult to split this component between four or five people. Use it as an excuse to commandeer it onto your own plate, if possible.The Akaushi Cheeseburger is a rather pricey item at $24, but is one of the more enjoyable burgers that I've found in the city. The meat comes from Akaushi cattle, which is particularly known for their marbled meat, and is a promising start to crafting a juicy patty. The burger is served on a lightly toasted Eli's bun, topped with grated Cato Corner Bloomsday cheese, and served with a fragrant and creamy arugula and basil mayo... but that's not all. The finishing touch is a spread of pickled jalapeno peppers placed on the other half of the bun, and the aggregate bite is an incredible array of flavors and textures. In your delight, don't forget the side of herbed fries that are served with their house-made ketchup.In sum: ABC Kitchen is a foolproof decision for brunch and dinner. You'll find the same commitment to high-quality, delicious food with a low-key setting that's still worthy of a night out. Don't be misled by the emphasis placed on ""organic"" and ""farm-to-table"" cooking; in the end, they still focus on the end product, and it consistently delivers a seamless dining experience.",11,5,8,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

2.0,3/10/2014,"From the moment we walked in, the hostess did not appear happy or pleased to speak with us. We were waiting for two of our guests, so she mentioned we would not be seated until they arrived - fair enough. However, no smile and no mention of having a drink before or browsing the menu. Upon finally being seated, our table of four was constantly passed up between 2-4 different people including a water boy, a server and some other random individuals who did not identify themselves. Our server was a younger female, and was incredibly awful with minimal attention to detail. Not only did everything from water, drink order and food take forever, she never apologized or even acknowledged that something was wrong.  This basically ruined the experience at ABC, as I had been expecting a lot given the reputation and raving reviews. Food wise - I ordered the pizza and shared a bite of the turkey sandwich. Honestly, it was just OK. For the price and the service, I would have preferred not to be there.

I got their ravioli which was AMAZING.  It was a large one, with an egg cooked inside.  It clearly took some artistry to manage this, but my colleagues and I had to restrain ourselves from licking the bowl.  The salted caramel dessert is a must have, but I'd steer clear from the dessert sampler.Topping off our experience was a David Blaine sighting, which is always fun!",2,2,2,Ammu K.,"Manhattan, NY",43,266,12

The food arrived promptly, very hot straight from the oven. It sounds like an obvious requirement for a restaurant, but so many places in the city don't focus on getting the basics right.Aside from that, I felt the ambiance was excellent. We were there on a busy Saturday night, right in the center of the restaurant, but could clearly hear each other talk, and were not bothered by the tables around us. Music was playing but it wasn't the deafening nightclub experience we've sadly become familiar with elsewhere.

4.0,3/3/2014,ABC kitchen is a beautifully decorated restaurant with a well executed menu and trained staff. The downside - you need reservations 31 days in advance and at 9 AM sharp (for a group of 6). The upside - everything else. We ordered a plethora of small plates to share. The homemade ricotta cheese is everything! The squash toast was really good. It was savory and combined with the fresh bread and ricotta it was close to perfection. The ricotta alone was a dish and it was excellent! The crab toast was pretty good but I enjoyed the squash more. Then there was the salmon sashimi style which was paired with a gingery mint dressing. Very well paired. The ravioli was just good. The mashed potatoes were a buttery heaven. We also enjoyed the hand crafted cocktails. Try the basil like dacquiri. You won't be sorry!

A delicious combination of dry rubbed roasted acorn squash with garlic roasted maitake mushrooms on a pool of a goat cheese dressing. SO GOOD!! The squash was seasoned with chili, star anise, and maple syrup...so fresh. Next was the pear and apple salad. Another amazing dish...the apples were caramelized and super sweet. Loved the pecan vinaigrette. The cavatelli with broccoli rabe and sausage was so delicious.

2.0,2/13/2014,"My experience at ABC Kitchen was totally underwhelming.When I first walked in, I was impressed by the space & decor. It's linked to ABC Carpets, so it's no surprise that everything is made up like a Home & Garden magazine. Beautiful lighting, furniture, and an interesting combination of two-tops + large round tables perfect for bachelorette parties.We were seated by a nice enough hostess, but I noticed there was no greeting when we first walked in. I feel like it should be a standard to make your guests feel welcomed and guided when they first walk in.Our server didn't get to us right away and when he did, I wasn't even sure he was our server. He didn't make any introductions, and he was at best apathetic throughout our meal. I expect a lot better service when we're paying these prices, and from the perspective of a former server, this was definitely not up to par.We proceeded to order:- roasted pear salad, apples, mammuth cheese and pecan vinaigrette- cavatelli with sausage- fresh ricotta, crispy prosciutto and dates whole wheat pizza- chocolate cake with malted ganache & toasted marshmallow icing- warm apple pie with cinnamon gelatoThe salad was actually the best part of the meal. It was a delicious combination of flavors & fresh ingredients, and the cheese was to die for. I mean, you can't really go wrong with pears, apples & cheese with fresh greens.It was basically downhill from there.The cavatelli was WAY too salty and the presentation was mediocre. I felt like I was eating a bowl of maggots, and the sausage was grounded and chopped in such a way that I couldn't even savor the texture or flavor.The pizza was eh. I wouldn't order pizza from them -- go to Luzzo's or Roberta's if you're looking for out-of-this-world specialty pizzas. The dates gave it a nice sweet twist, but other than that, I couldn't taste the prosciutto -- just got lost in there, and the ricotta was bland.I was looking forward to the desserts at this point to redeem the rest of the meal, and it completely fell flat. I LOVE desserts and I wanted to cry because it was so boring.The chocolate cake was way too sweet and dense. The marshmallow icing was pretty much inedible. I love chocolate cake and I couldn't even eat this. The apple pie was terrible. The crust was not flaky/buttery AT ALL... it tasted like some dried out vegan shit gone wrong. I wasn't even sure if they had any apples in the pie, since it was so overwhelmed by the yucky crust. Even the gelato wasn't enough to bring it back... in fact, I can't even remember it, it was so forgettable.Wouldn't pay $30 to eat here, much less the $100 I ended up spending.

The interior of this place is nice and the crowd is young/hip. Service: 3 stars. We sat at the bar and were greeted by a young man who gave us menus (He was not the waiter but was probably provider better service throughout the night). The actual waitress took entirely too long to come even greet us. Mind you--there were only 4 parties at the bar. To add to our frustration she took another party's order before ours despite us being there longer. When she approached she appeared slightly disinterested. When our first round of food arrived she never asked us how we liked it...Food 3.5 stars: speaking of food we had the burger, arugla and bacon pizza, and crab toast. I hated the pizza (skip that) and my boyfriend was raving about the burger--so much so that I ordered the burger. Yes, it was very good!

2.0,1/29/2014,"Way overrated. We went there and sat in the bar area where they have cafe-type tables and chairs. Probably the most uncomfortable chair I have ever sat in and I have a cafe-type table and chairs in my apartment.No wines of distinction. In fact they offered us a ""special"" light red from LI that was picked in October!! I bet it was ""light"", it probably tasted like grape juice. The Beckmans Cab is good but retails for about $16 per bottle and they charged us $15 for less than 4 ounces. At that rate, they can get 6 servings per bottle.My lentil soup was ok, but at $14 for a little over a cup of it was unreasonable. My akaushi cheeseburger was also pretty good, but $24 is a lot for a burger and fries. Also, I ordered it medium (I like my steak rare, but ground beef medium), and it was way undercooked. Rare to medium rare. My friend had the kasha and bow tie pasta with veal meatball. Even though the portion was very small, she did not finish it because the sauce was way too thick and tasted like canned gravy. The so-called meatballs were about the size of a dime.

This ranks in our top ten best dinning experiences.  Interesting note-the dress was more casual that I would have thought. I was business casual but actually felt a little overdressed looking at everyone else (maybe because the wind chill was 0?) A drink at the bar first is a must as they have a nice selection of wines, beer and top shelf. We were seated in the first dinning room. Such an appetizing room. Fresh vegetables are displayed and the fun, dim chandeliers make for a great vibe. Our server was all about serving US. Our group had many questions about the dishes throughout the evening and she was patient and knowledgeable. Unlike so many servers these days, she would really listen to you and answer your questions completely. Everyone loved every bit of their dishes. For starters we enjoyed bow tie pasta with kasha, kale salad, carrot avocado salad, smoked salmon and ricotta. All fantastic-but the best were the pretzel calamari and mushroom pizza. For mains we all shared the salmon, organic chicken, cavatelli pasta and Akaushi cheeseburger. For sides we shared the sweet potatoes (like candy), brussel sprouts (the best I have ever had), and the mashed potatoes (full of butter and salt). We have a very talkative crew and it got very silent when the food arrived. Yes-it was that good. For dessert we shared the apple pie, cinnamon ice cream and a couple of the sundae's.

I'll say it from the start that I'm not wealthy, so forgive my complaints about the prices. I also didn't taste any drinks or dessert here yet, so consider my review incomplete until then. I'll get the petty things over with: 1. I believe you have to enter the restaurant from the street (not from within the store) to be seated. My friend and I stood at what turned out to be the exit for a few minutes before noticing everybody was entering from another side. There really should be a clear sign, or the wait staff could at least tell the visitors that they need to enter from the other side. They simply ignored us.  2. The chairs cannot hold jackets well; your jacket will fall if you drape it over the back of your chair. 3. Tiniest vases holding the tiniest flowers ever - I don't know why it annoyed me, but it did. 4. Equally tiny water glasses. I guess what annoys me the most about places like this is that they make everything so cute, minimalist, and tiny. And then you realize you are paying a lot for a cute, minimalist, and tiny experience! We had very courteous service, and my chair was even pushed in for me! That was a first! Our waiter was polite and didn't fuss about splitting our bill between two credit cards. The staff is good about being humble and not rubbing the restaurant's classiness in your face. Bread service is free, if you were wondering, but the bread is very plain. They will give you more bread, but they will not give you more olive oil or sea salt (at least not without asking). My friend and I shared the pretzel-dusted calamari. It comes with a creamy horseradish-like sauce and a spicy red sauce. It was delicious, but I personally couldn't taste any pretzel. I ordered the spinach and goat cheese pizza, which was heavenly! Oily, but heavenly. Be warned, though, that the flavors are pretty strong and you will be dying for water. It also had some hidden spice. The pizza needs a side dish so you don't get tired of the goat cheese and spinach so much.My friend ordered the ricotta ravioli. He's a big eater, so he was annoyed at how tiny his ""entrée"" portion was, and we were wondering how comically small the appetizer portion would have been. Good thing he ordered the side of fries, which were deliciously seasoned with lots of rosemary. Even the ketchup tasted delicious like it was homemade. Overall, the food was delicious and the service very, very nice. This is a very, very nice place and you should try it (and the store, while you're at it!), but it's not worth it to penny-pinch here, as I have learned.

I was lucky enough to squeeze my family and I in on a weekday night over the summer. We were seated far to the back of the restaurant where it merges with the beyond gorgeous home store. While some may see being far off from the main dining area a drawback, I found it to be a pleasant experience as the section furthest back was significantly brighter and open, as well as a tad quieter. All of the dishes that I sampled were marvelous. Favorites included the salty sweet pretzel crusted calamari, crispy okra small plate, and the whole wheat mushroom pizza with a sunny side up egg plopped in the center. We topped it all off with their ice cream, which at the time was a malted chocolate. I remember being so satisfied after the dinner course that I couldn't force down that last spoonful of ice cream, leading me to regret it for an eternity (or at least until I collapsed of food coma when I got home).I know ABC Kitchen can be a total pain to get into but I believe your best bet is to walk-in.

4.0,1/17/2014,"Casual girls' night out - this place was the perfect spot for it. Nice ambiance, good food, and great service.We had a reservation for two at 6:30 on Tuesday night. I ran 5 mins late but checked in right away at the front. My friend was 25 minutes late and I was starting to get worried about our table... Did they still have it saved for us? Yes, they did and they sat us right away! - so that was a great start.The waitress was very attentive and super nice/accommodating. When she heard that we'd be splitting the entrees she offered to bring them already split in half. When she heard we were deciding on what beers to get she got us little tasters. She gave us great recommendations on the menu and overall the service continued to be great throughout our meal. Food was also surprisingly very tasty. We split the Akaushi cheeseburger with herbed mayo and pickled jalapenos ($24) and Kasha and bowtie pasta with veal meatballs ($24). The jalapenos in the cheeseburger gave it a little spicy punch at the end (but the spiciness wasn't overwhelming, which was great). In contrast, the pasta had more of a mellow taste to it. Both of the dishes were fantastic!We also ordered two desserts: Almond cake ($12) and Sundae ($14). The almond cake was very light... or maybe we thought so because the sundae was very sweet with a strong caramel flavor. Out of the two, I'd say my favorite was the Sundae which had salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts & popcorn, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce. Split this with your friend if you can!Overall, I will definitely come back!",0,0,0,Katherine N.,"New York, NY",200,51,33
2.0,1/15/2014,"I've been wanting to check out ABC Kitchen since I moved into the city, (only about 2 months). A friend of mine managed to get a reservation and I jumped at the opportunity. I consider myself pretty well rounded when it comes to food, and have been to my fair share of top notch restaurants. I wanted to like ABC Kitchen as I had heard incredible things. Unfortunately, I was let down on more than one instance.Appetizer.I went with a group of four, and to stay within budget we decided to share some appetizers. My friend had been before, and demanded we share the fresh ricotta, crispy prosciutto and dates whole wheat za'. Wouldn't have been my first choice but I had to comply. I recommended we try the line caught tuna sashimi marinated wtih ginger and mint (line caught sucked me in). Finally, I asked if we could split the marinated olives, $7, why not right?The pizza was sweet, very sweet. Not to say it wasn't good, but the dates just overpowered every bite. I would've preferred just the plain whole wheat pizza, with ricotta herbs and tomato sauce. The tuna was delicious, but when splitting five pieces of tuna sashimi each the size of a quarter amongst four people, you can't help but feel cheated. Not blaming the restaurant, as the appetizer for one person would've been sufficient, just trying to educate the reader, don't share this dish. Lastly, the olives. From the reviews this place has recieved I expected some bomb olives. They were not. Too big, too hard, and really just not that much flavor. The main course. Now I typically botch my entree order, but I didn't think the black sea bass could be that poor of an option. Boy was I wrong. The fish was overcooked and stuffed with what I'm guessing was spinach (not mentioned on the menu). Some bites contained weird lumps of what tasted and felt like fat deposits. It was disgusting. I didn't even finish the fish, and I'm not one to not finish a meal, even if it is pretty bad. Maybe I ordered wrong, but I don't think I willl be back to find out.Lastly, the dessert.I read some reviews on the sundae and heard it is a must get. Being that I was the only one that wanted dessert though, I had to settle for the Carrot Cake. My waiter informed me that they were out, but due to demand, were making another as we spoke. I told him I would wait as a hot piece of Carrot Cake with cream cheese icing seemed too good to pass up. About 5 minutes later the cake came, cold, old, and tasteless. The cream cheese icing needed way more sugar, and seemed hard as if to be sitting in a fridge for some time now. I didn't even feel like inquiring as to how a slice of cake that was just baked tasted cold and old. At this point I was too upset with the $70 I had just spent on a slice of pizza, one piece of tuna sashimi, and rubber fish to even bother saying something.Overall. The service was whatever. not bad enough to mention anything, but surely not up to the standards of a top-rated NYC restaurant.Overall, my advice is to avoid the black sea bass, not split appetizers, and don't order the carrot cake. The other dishes might be awesome, but as I mentioned earlier, I won't be coming back. Overrated and not worth the money. TL;DR Tuna is small, date pizza is too sweet, black sea bass was overcooked and rubbery, carrot cake was tasteless and cold with fraudulent cream cheese icing. Overrated.",1,2,0,Aaron A.,"New York, NY",0,24,0

5.0,1/6/2014,"I've never written a Yelp review before, but felt compelled to because my meal at ABC kitchen was probably one of the best experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. Or maybe any place ever. Before I get into the food stuff, let me first comment on the design of the space. My mouth dropped several times. I mean, everything is just impeccable. It's like stepping into a Restoration Hardware dream world, only cooler. And prettier. My fiancé and I were totally stunned and caught ourselves taking a break from our dinners to look around at the decor. It takes a lot to distract us from our food, but this place is beautiful, and every detail is just perfect. If I could, I think I'd live in the restaurant. Now, for the service. Without exaggeration, someone was paying attention to us, always. And not in an annoying way. In an amazing, I feel like I'm being really well taken care of way. When we got up to use the bathroom, someone was waiting to help us back into our chairs. If we needed the tiniest bit of refill in our glasses, someone was there to pour it. The treatment and attention to detail were extraordinary. Keep it up, ABC Kitchen! Finally, the food! I don't know what to say except that we wanted to eat everything on the menu but couldn't afford to. So we settled on an appetizer, a salad, a pizza, and two entrees. We chose the tuna sashimi, which tasted like heaven. A kale salad that was light, refreshing, and super generous portion-wise. (They split it for us without even asking. So nice!) Then we had a pizza with fresh truffles. That was off the hook. I couldn't sleep last night because I was still thinking about it. For realsies. And for entrees, we ordered the sea bass and the roasted lobster. Both were phenomenal, and guess what? I don't even like sea bass. The lobster was lemony and a little spicy and it practically melted in my mouth. I almost didn't need to chew it at all. After all this, we were so full and happy but we knew we'd regret it if we didn't get dessert. So we did. We ordered the carrot cake. I'm not even sure why, but you can't go wrong with cream cheese frosting. A minute later, someone brought over the chocolate cake. Oops. We didn't order that. Our server felt horrible for accidentally bringing us the wrong delicious dessert. He insisted on us eating it anyway, then promptly brought the carrot cake. Turns out, we liked the chocolate better. So, that was a big win for us. After our meal, we couldn't stop smiling and we told our server Alexander that we'd be back again. This, my Yelp friends is why you go out to eat. Not just for the food, but for an experience that you'll talk about later and hopefully relive again. Well done, ABC Kitchen.

Service was courteous, personable and capable, though at one point one wine glass did sit empty for a long while until one of us reached over to the bucket and poured anther glass ourselves. In terms of food (aside from the stellar crostini noted above), the highlight was the 4 cheese brussel sprout and cracked chili pepper whole wheat pizza, the roasted beets, and the crunch of the fried and deboned half chicken. Otherwise, the food was ok: the ""sliced fish"" was way too thickly cut, and not just thick, but shoddily and raggedly cut as well, which was rather disturbing. That was the first piece of raw fish I've allowed entry into my mouth since having sushi at Sukiyabashi Jiro in Tokyo, so I felt cheated. Anywho. The seasoning itself was totally fine, olive oil, citrus, salt, fennel: tasty but forgettable. The roasted cauliflower was meh. My pasta w/ veal meatballs was very flavorful for the first two bites, until the salt overwhelmed and nearly blew out my palate. The confit pork was tasty. The red snapper w/ spinach and consommé was delicate but just ok overall: the fish cooked well, though slightly over, and the consommé was boring but passable. The salted caramel ice cream w/ popcorn was pretty tasty, albeit a bit too sweet. And the carrot cake was moist and tasty but, again, too sweet. I'd def come back for the ambience and market dishes.

4.0,1/2/2014,"ABC Kitchen is another Solid creation of Jean George... it both is homely and lively... Sometime a little too lively for a relaxing evening dinner. ABC Kitchen is right on 18th Street in the Flatiron district.  It was late and we were craving to treat ourselves with a wholesome meal after some tiresome Christmas shopping...  Looked on Yelp to see what was nearby lord and behold ABC Kitchen check to see if reservation was available.  Lucked out someone cancelled.  Whohoo...  We snatched it and walked right in... It was 930 pm and it was swamped.  It was a cute place, spacious and cheerful with a lot of light. Service was friendly and reasonably attentive. I started with a bloody mary my friend ordered a winter ale beer.  It was spectacular. The bloody mary was thick, spicy and delicious - everything a bloody mary should be. The garnishes were also fantastic .  We started with some appetizers the Green Kale salad and Fresh Fluke.  Yummy the kale was fresh/crunchy/refreshing.   There was a hint of jalapenos and salt that went well with the salad.  The Fluke was fresh and refined.  It had a wonderful blend of garlic olive oil and spices.  Then came the pasta with organic mushrooms  We enjoyed this very much.  The pasta was perfectly cooked and the ingredients were simple superb.   Thankfully, the appetizers were was also delicious. We shared an order of the Sea bass... It was good but for some reason it reminded me a lot of PF Chang's Sea Bass dish.  Not that it was bad but it had a lot of similarities only difference was that the sea bass was so small.  Somewhat disappointing.  For dessert we ordered cinnamon apple tarts. They were warm and lovely, with good texture and not too much sweetness. the crispiness of the outer shell and warm gooiness of cinnamon and apple went well together..  Be prepared to pay up our bill ended up being $200+",2,0,1,Eric Y.,"New York, NY",424,163,73
3.0,1/2/2014,"We did enjoy our visit to ABC Kitchen (and Cocina for a drink after dinner) although I'm getting a bit tired of the ""sustainable"" concept that seems to be a staple of almost every menu we've seen in NY lately.  Politically, it seems to contradict the outright extravagance and commercialism that is going on right next door at ABC Home ($1000 for a small piece of pottery, are you kidding me??) It was a bit confusing to make your way into the right place...signs on the outside are very small and faint, I'm thinking that is to get you into the store first so you can shop and buy.  If you go through the Home store, the ""Kitchen"" is on the right all the way in the back and ""Cocina"" is through the doors on the left.  The place is gorgeous - right down to the white ""patio-like"" chairs and the dim lighting that perfectly accents the massive wood-beamed ceiling.  We started with cocktails and the Pretzel Crusted Calamari - a bit chewy and  ordinary - the pretzel coating didn't distinguish it from other calamari we've had in any way.  Our entrees included fish (Snapper or Salmon, I forgot which one) and the Crispy Pork with Braised Turnips and a side of their Mashed Potatoes with Sea Salt.  The mashed potatoes were by far the best item that we ordered.  I thought the pork was spongy and the bacon ""marmalade"" it was topped with had large pieces of bacon that were leather-like.  The flavor was decent but nothing special.  We didn't stay for dessert but did venture across the aisle to ABC Cocina to meet a friend for a drink.  The bartenders appeared to be very busy and it took some effort to get their attention.  The place was bustling - it is obvious this is a hot spot for more than just waiting for a table.  I wouldn't say that our experience at ABC Kitchen totally lived up to our expectations but it was enjoyable.  In my opinion, it wasn't great enough to warrant a second visit but it's something you might want to see at least once.",2,0,0,Toni F.,"Lemont, IL",193,483,291

4.0,12/26/2013,"KenScale: 8.0/10ABC Kitchen is renowned chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's farm to table restaurant (run by executive chef Dan Kluger) that has been one of the most beloved institutions by New York locavores since its opening in 2010. It is still one of the hardest tables to get, and a charming dining room with the fresh ingredients that translate to many vegetable-based dishes mean ABC Kitchen is one of the go-to spots for handsome young people in the city. Unfortunately, I had been underwhelmed during my previous visits to the restaurant, as I thought the farm to table concept was perhaps oversold and some dishes lacked the kind of flavor and execution that I would expect from a Jean-Georges institution. I decided to give it one more shot during my annual holiday dinner with friends. This time, I had a larger dining party so my friends and I could sample more dishes, with emphasis on appetizers instead of larger entrees (which were the chief source of my disappointment with the restaurant). Overall, the dining experience was much more improved, and my dinner turned out to be pretty satisfying.I shared five appetizers: crab toast, roasted beets, shaved raw fluke, raw diver scallops, and roast carrot and avocado salad. Among these, crab toast was the highlight, as I loved the freshness of the crab on top. Beets and carrot and avocado salad also had nice touches. I was slightly disappointed with the raw fluke and scallops, as the seasoning of chilies somewhat overwhelmed the texture of each raw fish. I hadn't had pastas at the restaurant before, and was pleasantly surprised with the two dishes I had. Housemade ricotta ravioli looked so simple, yet the flavor was quite delightful. I also really liked fresh fettuccine with lobster, tarragon and black truffles, one of the dishes from the prix fixe options that I was able to order a la carte (but was shocked that the appetizer portion of the dish cost $44 even though I could barely taste truffles). I hadn't had a pizza at the restaurant, either, and was pleased with the fresh mushrooms, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza as well. Even the two entrees that my dining party had selected turned out to be winners. Akaushi cheesseburder with herbed mayo and piackled jalapenos and crispy pork confit with braised turnips and smoked bacon marmalade featured tender meat that was seasoned just right, and worked well with a side of roasted brussels sprouts. For dessert, simple dishes like sundae (with salted caramel ice cream and candied peanuts and popcorn) and seasonal doughnuts should be the way to go. It's still very hard to secure a reservation at ABC Kitchen so the best bet is to show up during lunch time or make a reservation way in advance. I really liked the decor and vibe of the dining room, full of beautiful, energetic and young crowd. The restaurant has a full bar with some great wine selections as well.

3.0,12/25/2013,"I really wanted to be blown away by ABC Kitchen however after our experiences, I was not. Overrated? Perhaps. I did enjoy the ambiance. It's casual, inviting, has large opened space, upbeat and has a bit of ""shabby chic""-ness to it. The patrons range from a young couple in their early 20s on a date, a group of girls dolled up for the evening to a couple in their 50s enjoying a casual dinner out. Unfortunately, I was less than enthused about the food. It was just not memorable enough which was surprising for me since I've heard so much praise. I'm not saying food was bad; just not something I'd expect from a Jean Georges establishment. Service was great.

4.0,12/23/2013,This place is great for brunch. So many choices and prices are affordable. By far one of the best items on the menu is the burger. It is extremely tasty and juicy with a great sauce that is tangy and slightly spicy---excellent. Another great thing on menu is the Egg Benedict. One of the best- not too creamy or juicy and kept simple with lot of flavor. You definitely need reservation on weekend for brunch as it gets packed but dinners are even tougher to get without reservation.,0,0,0,Akshay S.,"New York, NY",13,52,17

They never have any, unless it's like 11 pm (seriously).  I can't believe that getting a reservation for 3 on a Tuesday leaves then with only one reso at 11 pm.  Anyways...

The food was just not good enough......I love the environment there -- casual, open, healthy, welcoming. People can chat loudly here and everybody seems happy. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. I like him. The only problem: Food. It might just because of Thanksgiving night, the food was kind of cold and the plating was kind of messy. Our meat was very well cooked. My port has this crunchy layer of skin. It was very delicious. But the side vegetable seems to be cooked before we get there.

Several people mentioned the ABC Kitchen and Cocina as the place to go, so I went in pretty confidant that we were winners.  However, I was still happily surprised by how every single item we ate was amazing.  I ordered and tried things I typically wouldn't just because it seemed like the right thing to do.

It's just decorated exquisitely from the minute you open the door. Service is impeccable and this place really lives up to its hype in every sense. Every dish is unique  and delectable.

3.0,12/1/2013,"This is such a beautiful restaurant and I wanted to like it SO much. I love, love, love the atmosphere and the vibe..  But the food just didn't do it for me.  Please remember, this is partially to do with it being a cultural issue, so when I order 'fried chicken', I didn't expect it to be deep fried.  I expected pan fried. That was a bit of a problem for me as I had been in the US for about a month and had eaten too much deep friend everything. That's my fault, and I accept that.  I should have checked.Another issue I had was that the vegetables and potato were just SWIMMING in butter. A massive pool of butter. I love butter, but it was just a bit much for me.  And your veggies don't need that much butter on them to taste delicious! Just a smidge will do.On the other hand, the cured meats and cheeses were delicious, the wait staff were attentive and didn't laugh at me when I couldn't quite read the faint coloured print on their drinks menu (thanks, 'cause that was super embarrassing...) and the restaurant was such a pleasure to be in with a great drinks list.If back in NYC, I will totally come back.  I won't order the fried chicken, and I might ask for less butter on the vegetables...  But on the other hand, I will totally enjoy the atmosphere and love the concept.",2,2,0,Vanessa M.,"Auckland, New Zealand",37,92,26
3.0,11/27/2013,"ABC Kitchen is probably one of the trendiest spots in all of Manhattan for dinner. The dining room has warm lighting with white walls and white tables and white chairs. The ambiance is simply charming and was my favorite part of the dining experience. The food was average. For appetizers, I tried the following dishes ranked in order, starting with the best:(1) Crab toast with lemon aioli. This was a solid appetizer...tasty indeed. Certainly one of the better appetizers on the menu.(2) Pretzel dusted calamari served with marinara sauce and mustard aioli. The description of this dish, specifically the pretzel dust sounded amazing. Sorry to burst your bubble, but the calamari tasted like regular calamari. I did not see or taste any pretzel dust. They probably sprinkled a tiny amount on top so they could slap the name on the dish.  (3) Roasted cauliflower, onion and walnut crumbs and with a fried egg on top. This dish did not have much flavor and was too salty. It felt like they just took some cauliflower, threw loads of salt on top and stuck it in the oven. There was not much to this dish. (4) Fresh fettuccine with black truffles, fresh mozzarella and parmesan. Again, the description of this dish sounded so scrumptious. Unfortunately, this dish was the most disappointing dish of the night. You see the word truffle and you automatically have high expectations. There was something completely off about this dish and I cannot quite put my finger on it. The truffles did not taste like truffles and you have to be skeptical when you are only paying $18 for black truffles. Usually black truffle pasta dishes range from $50-100. When I asked me server if it was real truffle to further investigate, he insisted that it was real truffle. Not sure if there was some sort of miscommunication, but I do not recommend trying this dish. For dinner, I ordered the black sea bass with chilies and herbs served with spinach and baby market potatoes. I did not like this dish at all. It was bland and a bit fishy for me. I attempted to eat the fish with the vegetables to at least get some protein in my diet but the veggies totally lacked flavor as well. I tried some of the lobster which again had no flavor. The fried organic chicken was actually pretty good but you can't really go wrong with fried food. Overall, I was not pleased with ABC kitchen. I was super excited to dine here as it was nearly impossible for me to snag a reservation for 4 people on a Saturday night. I will admit I am a harsh critic, however after consulting with the rest of my dinner party they agreed to share the same disappointment. Again, the cool and hip ambiance was my favorite part of the experience. Therefore if you are not a huge foodie or harsh critic, I still recommend checking this place out because you will definitely love it!",4,0,1,Kiki P.,"Boston, MA",238,261,1663

The hostesses were kind and welcoming and the wait was maybe ten minutes once we got there.Of note is the lighting - the tables were carefully placed with an overhead light shining right into the middle of the table and there were no other lights to create a shadow over your food by your head, but this lighting created a lovely calm atmosphere throughout. The service was very friendly and accommodating and the food was very good. I had some delicious bay scallop as well as maguro crudo. The salad of ""crispy carrots"" and avocado was good as well, but I didn't expect a miracle with the ""lowly"" carrot.The food and drinks were all served on and in plates cups and glassware that can be bought in the expansive (and expensive!) store adjacent to the restaurant.I highly recommend you try it, because it's a safe bet with excellent ingredients prepared in a solid, uncomplicated way; and I also recommend you going into the store just to see and FEEL the quality linen and cashmere they have as well.",0,0,0,Horns D.,"San Francisco, CA",1,38,0

They also had a great playlist going which set a fun, upbeat ambiance. The hostess sat us at a round table for our party of 6 which let us converse easily.For appetizers, we shared the crab toast, avocado and carrot salad and glazed doughnuts. One friend emitted a loud ""oh my god!"" after biting into the crab toast. It was as good as I heard it was. I was also impressed by the carrots which were so much tastier than I thought possible. I enjoyed the lemon doughnut as well.I ordered the burger (Michelle Obama got this when she came to the restaurant). I liked that it wasn't ginormous like so many burgers in NY. The herbed mayo and pickled jalapenos really made this burger unique and delicious. My friend got the spinach and goat cheese omelette which she didn't like because the omelette was all egg yolk. It gave the omelette a strange consistency and taste that she wasn't used to. Everyone else liked their dishes though.Service was spectacular and our waitress was sweet and attentive.

Less than enough to complement each bite unless I cut the apples up into tiny bits which made the dish feel a bit off balance. After all, it was listed on the menu as French Toast with caramelized apples and cinnamon, so you would think that apples would play a fairly significant role. Perhaps my expectations were too high.

In the past year, it's been our go-to restaurant for special occasions. My husband and I's anniversary and birthdays. This year, for my birthday, we decided to go for lunch. As usual, the service was amazing. Everyone was very pleasant and personable. Everything on the menu seemed appealing and it was hard to chose! I ended up choosing a light dish. Fish with spinach and heirloom tomatoes. It was delightful until about a quarter of the way into the meal, I took a bite and realized something just wasn't quite right. Somehow, a habanero pepper had made it's way into the tomatoes. Honest mistake in the kitchen - I get it! They were the same color, right? Needless to say, my mouth was on fire. I can't even describe to you the pain. My mouth, I believe, was still sore later that evening. I'm not a difficult person to please. I don't complain about food in restaurants. Our waiter was extremely apologetic. When we asked if there were supposed to be habanero peppers in the dish, he explained that they DO cook with peppers, although not in this particular dish.I guess in a restaurant with such an amazing reputation, I thought we'd get a little more of an apology. I don't know what I expected. Maybe it was because it was my birthday and I had set a high standard for my birthday lunch?After opting out on a replacement meal, I ordered the huge ice cream sundae instead (maybe I should have done that in the first place, right? It WAS my birthday, after all!). We ended up having to pay for the dessert. We weren't looking for a freebie, but I don't know.... something?

5.0,10/31/2013,"What a treat it was to dine at ABC Kitchen, an amazing restaurant by Chef Jean-Georges. For my first night back in New York, it was the perfect place to appeal to my  gastronomical sensibilities. ABC Kitchen is absolutely stunning in terms of decor. The interior is warm and inviting with its dim lighting and rustic touches. The ceilings and walls are accented by wood beams, all against the backdrop of a clean, crisp white color scheme. I'm normally not a fan of that type of palette, however the wood elements function to subdue and restrain it so that the space exudes a homey ambiance without the slightest  hint of pretension. A thoughtful design that I'm immensely impressed with.After starting with a round of drinks (I had dirty martinis that were out of this world), we decided to start with the following:CRAB TOAST with lemon aioli: A generous crab salad mixture atop toasted bread. The crab was fresh and plentiful; each bite had a portion of crab. Loved the invigorating flavors. An inventive starter that I adored.PORK BELLY SALAD & EGG: So wrong on so many levels, but delicious, nevertheless. Eating a salad is supposed to make us feel good about our diets, but this salad throws that notion right out the window. I loved how the pork belly didn't have that fatty texture to it that usually turns me off; it was nicely cooked, crispy, so that a lot of the fat was rendered away, seemingly. The chopped egg was a nice touch, tempering the bold flavor of the pork. Execution was wonderful.For my entree, after much agonizing, I decided on the KASHA & BOW TIE PASTA with VEAL MEATBALLS ($24). This is a more sophisticated twist to the Jewish classic Kasha Varnishkes, except that it's on some serious steroids. Pasta was cooked perfectly, and the amount of kasha was just right. I would have liked to have seen some caramelized onions, an element that is essential to the traditional dish. Their absence, however, didn't completely disappoint me. It was rich, hearty, and the portion was on point. The debauchery continued with dessert. We all decided to share a slice of both the CHOCOLATE CAKE and ZUCCHINI CAKE. Honestly, I wasn't a fan of the chocolate cake. The toasted marshmallow icing, while it sounds good, just didn't work -- the texture was rubber-like, and the cake was a little dry. The zucchini cake, however, was wonderful. Extremely moist, and the cream cheese frosting was lovely. Service was phenomenal. Our waitress was dutiful in ensuring we were all happy during our visit. ABC was truly one of the many highlights of my recent NYC trip.Make reservations in advance as tables fill up fast!",4,3,3,Gary R.,"San Diego, CA",826,721,1896
4.0,10/28/2013,Beautiful restaurant. The food is delicious i wont go into detail because u can get it in the 100s of other reviews. Would 100% recommend it and will return. The ice cream sundae and the homemade sodas are a MUST! the reason i gave four stars is because the food took a while to come out while the table next to us food came out super quick. but overall great experience,0,0,0,A A.,"West Islip, NY",0,75,105
5.0,10/27/2013,I have to say it is always good.  I have been for lunch about 5 times and 3 times for dinner.  Nothing about it is ever bad.  It is hyped and lives up to it.  Great creative a la Alice Waters inspired food.  It can get very busy and hard to get a reservation.  The food is a bit on the pricey side but everything is always well executed.  Delicious local and organic options.  Great wine selections and I love the dishware and decor.   You don't feel gross when you leave here and over eat- the food feels clean and not fussy.  Really delicious and a must if you are a foodie in NYC.,1,0,0,Alice E.,"Brooklyn, NY",481,788,1
5.0,10/22/2013,"Amazing place that we discovered through a diner next to us the night before who told us it was impossible to get a reservation here.  Since we were going to a show the next night, I used an online app to see if we could make a late night dinner reservation and voila, we got a 10:30 spot.  After a quick subway trip, we got to ABC about 15 minutes early, but when we checked in with the hostess, she didn't have our names on the list.  Turned out the app had accidentally moved our reservation to the following week.  No worries, though, she was quick to accommodate us and we had to wait in the bar only 15 minutes for a table.From the moment you walk in, you can tell this place is the place to be in NYC.  The furnishings are white and chrome with black & white artwork. The crowd was hip and young and dressed to kill.  Our server was quite helpful, pointing out special dishes on the menu, and even offered wine suggestions for each entrée.  All the food is locally grown and mostly organic.  We both started with the heirloom tomato salad with strawberries and goat cheese, which was amazing.  The tomatoes were end of season, so they were juicy and ripe with a tang that perfectly complimented the fruit and cheese.  Hubby had the whole wheat pizza topped with spinach, goat cheese & herbs.  It tasted way better than it looked.  I had the halibut, which was flaky and cooked to perfection.  ABC Kitchen is obviously a trend-setter that deserves the attention it gets.  If you're in NYC, it's worth trying to get a reservation!",0,0,1,Donna B.,"Monrovia, CA",763,100,9
5.0,10/21/2013,"Lovely restaurant, excellent service. The food is superb. We went for dinner and shared everything- crab toast (fresh and delicate), roasted squash (perfect fall food), roasted carrots and avocado salad (best carrots I've ever had), and mushroom egg pizza (perfect combination of woodsy mushrooms, creamy cheese, and runny egg). We also had the fig cobbler (apple sorbet was the bomb) and a scoop of the cinnamon ice cream. Their housemade sodas were delicious too- I had a lime basil one that I'm still thinking about.

1.0,10/17/2013,"I simply had to write this review to voice my disappointment. My fiancee and I had set a goal to visit all the Jean Georges restaurants and for his 25th birthday, we settled on reservations to ABC Kitchen for an early dinner, at 5:30. We got to the place and at 5:20 it was still closed which was perfectly okay. Precisely at 5:30, we were let in and seated within a few minutes. So far so good. The waiter was also great and informative. However, this is when the positives of our experience end:First off, the food was absolutely not on par with a Jean Georges Restaurant. We had two appetizers, the smoked salmon which was lacking any taste and the ""Famous"" crab toasts. The crab toasts were pretty good because the crab was extremely fresh and flavorful however, the toast it was on was extremely thick and very difficult to bite into.For the entrees, I decided on their signature carrot and avocado salad and holy moly, those carrots were SO peppery it was ridiculous. My fiancee had the suckling pig and that was simply not good. The amount of salt was ridiculous. It's as if they weren't paying any attention to flavors. Needless to say, I didn't finish my salad and he didn't enjoy his dish as all which was extremely upsetting considering we were celebrating his birthday.  We also had 2 drinks which were simply okay. We skipped on dessert because by this point, we realized that we had just spent $150 on food that lacked any balance of flavors. As we ate our entrees, we heard the people complaining about the over seasoning on their carrot and avocado salad as well, primarily about those peppered carrots! Sadly, we completely agreed with them.",2,1,0,Regina G.,"Brooklyn, NY",175,39,10

The waitress was very apologetic as she knew we had been waiting a long time.My husband complained to the manageress and she comped our $72 bar bill and gave us extra dessert which satisfied us.Would go back because the food was lovely but the speed of taking orders and getting food out on time leaves a lot to be desired.",0,0,0,S G.,"Civic Center, Manhattan, NY",3,51,3

3.0,10/10/2013,"I have never wanted to come here due to the lack of interest of the menu during the times I checked.It was only recently their menu has appealed to me, unfortunately they had no reservations during the time when I was loving their menu.I got a reservations for a new menu, less interesting, but good enough for me to try this place out.I never knew how booked this place was, because seriously is this place this popular?I want to say the ambiance and the decor looks totally different from the outside. You would not expect this magical and alluring atmosphere.I love the chandeliers, the lighting, the petite flowers that decorated each of the tables. Lovely.We shared the line caught tuna sashimi - four pieces! The first piece, I didn't get much of the sauce on the first piece, but the second piece, I drizzle the sauce on top and it was much better. I love this sauce, it was spicy and full of flavour. H complained about the teaser and thought the pieces were a joke.H got the Grilled Salmon - I tried it and I still do not care for cooked salmon, it is too fishy.I got the Halibut - it also had a nice kick and was perfectly cooked.H got the cake, it was a bit dry - I didn't really care for the taste.I got the Apple Dumpling - it was decent, but there wasn't really anything else on the menu that I wanted.Overall, I enjoyed my fish, but the decor was better than the food.Also, my ginger margarita - where was the ginger? I found the tequila though - really strong.This is why I don't understand why this place gets fully booked every night.I give this place a 3.5 starsThe waitress was really pushing their heirloom tomato dishes on us, I love tomato, but I am not going to go to a restaurant to eat tomatoes that are sliced up.I can do that at home, I like to eat dishes that I cannot make myself or the preparation is tedious and hard to make.

The mains were also excellent, I had the turkey bacon sandwich - which was served with warm freshly baked bread - simply excellent!The only down-side about the restaurant is the noise level.

Third course:  Salad with Heirloom tomatoes, strawberries, and goat cheese.  With this we had the fresh ricotta topped with a fig compote and toasted country bread.  We liked the scallop dish so much, we added it to this course as well.All in all an outstanding experience.  Wish I lived closer so I could try more menu items...",0,0,0,Kim A.,"San Francisco, CA",79,198,131

Fortunately, my friends old roommate happens to work there and voila, we were seated just like that. I felt like the hot girls going walking into the club bypassing the line. Upon seating we were greeted with a complimentary flute of rose and heirloom tomato toast. What a great start to the evening. We placed an order for crab toast, the salad of the day, and the okra with shisito peppers. My goodness. Everything was great. Not a huge okra fan but the way they fixed this dish was simply remarkable. You can taste the quality of each item. For our entrees we had the halibut and the fresh linguine with corn. The fish was amazingly fresh and clean. The pasta dish is where my friend and I agreed was not the highlight of the night. It had good flavor but the sweet corn got overwhelming and killed it for us.

Our experience was nothing short of perfect, and I'm convinced that we made the right choice in deciding to celebrate here.I loved the atmosphere. I was looking for something that was intimate and extravagant, without being overly stuffy. It was also important to me that the space be open and roomy. Being an inch away from the table next to you when you're attempting to have a romantic evening is not what I was looking for. And, in terms of all these requirements it was absolutely perfect.Our waiter was awesome. He was attentive without being pushy and new when to give us our space. The food was nothing short of incredible. The crab toast and mushroom egg pizza that we started with were both mind blowing. The roasted snapper and poached halibut were perfect. Their attention to detail was also spot on: they delivered two mini chocolate cupcakes on a plate with the words ""Happy Anniversary"" written across it in chocolate syrup.

The carrot and avocado did not advise that there was an abundance of cumin spice, the bean side dish was overcooked, oily and cold, the pasta was mediocre, but the single serving of portable mushroom was nicely cooked.

I'll say this: The food was outstanding. And the staff was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating -- as long as you could find someone. There were four or five people working in various capacities behind our bar (where they didn't produce any drinks at all, oddly) but no one person seemed responsible for us. They all seemed overwhelmed with running around doing other stuff. They didn't even make eye contact with us, lest they be asked for something. We honestly would have had two or three drinks each -- and ordered more food (we told them we would, and even kept a menu) -- if they'd only checked on us.

Decor:The interior is straight out of a catalogue--unpainted wood interior with glass and white furniture. Trendy interior makes for a nice location for lunch and dinner with friends or a date.Service:Nothing to complain about--if anything, servers were a little too overeager (moving to stand next to each of us for our orders, rather than just taking orders standing in one place--it was a little awkward. We would try and say our orders but would have to stop midway to wait for them to round the table to stand right next to us....). Food:Delicious! We ordered the goat cheese and strawberry and tomato salad, and the tuna sashimi. Both were delicious and very unique. Food was fresh and the quality was good. I ordered the salmon salad for the entree and absolutely loved it. Having grown up in Seattle, I know good salmon and well-prepared salmon, and the salmon at this restaurant just MELTED in my mouth. Excellent, non-overwhelming seasoning on the salmon with spinach made for a wonderful salad for lunch.We also shared the caramel popcorn sundae and it was delicious, decadent, and hit the SPOT.

I had made a reservation at ABC kitchen a few days prior to when we were to dine there. I instantly received a confirmation call from their hostess to confirm my reservation. (I personally would rather a confirmation the day prior or the day of because that's when plans can change. It's obviously still a plan 5 minutes later.) But I returned her call instantly and confirmed. Well, when we arrive at the restaurant there was no record of our reservation. I look on my OpenTable app to find out I no longer had a reservation. The hostess had cancelled our reservation either by accident or she misunderstood me on the phone. So we waited about 20 minutes for a table. That's not horrible if you would like to get a drink at the bar, however, their bar service is quite slow for a restaurant that sees so much action. I was a little surprised with how slow and un-attentive the bartenders were at getting around to us. However, I will say they kept their cool, were friendly, and the drinks were fabulous. The food was outstanding! Everything was absolutely cooked to perfection! I got the halibut, which usually isn't my favorite fish. This, however, was one of the best pieces of fish I have ever had! I love that everything is eco friendly. The drink menu is great. The ambience is beautiful and creative. And our server was fantastic!

All the drinks on their menu--non-alcoholic included--sound delicious. So I ordered the strawberry rhubarb lemonade cocktail, which was supposed to have vodka in it. When the waitress brought it out, I took a couple of sips and tasted no alcohol. Hubster took a sip, didn't taste the alcohol. I'm pretty much a lightweight when it comes to cocktails, but after drinking about half the glass, I didn't feel anything.Listen, I wasn't fiending for liquor. I didn't NEED for my drink to knock me off my feet. But when you pay FIFTEEN dollars for a cocktail, you expect it to have some alcohol in it. And this didn't taste watered down; it tasted like it had zero alcohol. And yes, I know that in a good drink, the alcohol flavor shouldn't overwhelm the taste, but with vodka, you pretty much always taste it when it's there.Hubster and I debated whether to speak up. We didn't want to sound rude about it, but then we thought, okay, what if this is just an accident and she thinks I wanted a plain lemonade. So very politely and apologetically, I said, ""I'm sorry, but we weren't sure--we didn't taste the alcohol at all--is the drink I ordered a virgin drink?"" The waitress was totally ungracious about it. First, she raised her eyebrows and said, ""Oh. You want MORE alcohol?"" I cringed inside. Apparently, her solution was to shame me. It worked. Then my husband chimed in and explained that we just weren't sure there was ANY at all. Waitress: ""Well, to me, when I don't taste the alcohol, I know it's a good drink. I mean, that's what it's supposed to be like."" At this point, I was insulted. I'm not an idiot. I've had lemonade with vodka in it. I know the difference between a non-alcoholic drink and an alcohol drink. This waitress was looking at me like I was a simpleton. The icing on the cake? She said, in the most condescending tone, ""Well, I can get you another if you want. I mean, we can just make you another one."" I said, ""Oh, no, that's okay, it's fine, if this is the way it's supposed to be--"" She barged ahead, ""No, I can get you another one, it's totally fine, but we'd have to charge you DOUBLE because that would be a DOUBLE shot."" I declined as politely as I could.LAME. For all she knows, the bartender forgot the alcohol. Why did she just presume we were idiots who didn't know what a cocktail should taste like? Why didn't she do what you're supposed to do in service, which is try to please the customer? She didn't even apologize.I know this review is like a drop in the bucket and won't effect the hundreds of other five and four star reviews. But I've noticed that many of the good reviews offhandedly mention things that would probably merit fewer stars than five or four. Like that the service is shoddy. The wait is too long. The food is overpriced. The portions are small. Consider these things. Why do we have to pay so much money for mediocrity?",3,1,0,Esinam B.,"Manhattan, NY",5,25,0

3.0,9/7/2013,"Let me preface this review by saying that I have been to ABC Kitchen only for brunch, so I can't comment on how the food is for lunch or dinner.  I have found that a lot of times, brunch may or may not be representative of the food served during a more ""normal"" service.  ABC Kitchen was hyped up a bit for me as it was one of the new Jean-Georges restaurants in town.  Reservations are generally difficult to get and my friend procured one quite far in advance and was kind enough to invite me.  To start off with the good, the restaurant has a really nice ambiance to it.  Its decor is dominated by shades of brown to get it a nice earthy feel to it.  There are twisted tree root looking structures throughout the restaurant that help to add to the feel.  The restaurant feels comfortable and casual while simultaneously upscale and classy.  When the food started arriving, my experience went a bit downhill though.  I ordered a mushroom pizza, which was good but not spectacular.  It was like any personal sized mushroom pizza that I've ever had, and not as good as some of the better ones.  Some other things that were ordered at my table were a yogurt parfait and kale salad.  Each cost about $15 and the yogurt parfait was a tiny bowl of yogurt with some granola while the kale salad was literally a bowl of just dressed kale.  The food wasn't amazing and it most certainly didn't offer much value.  I would be willing to try dinner here at some point as maybe that is better and worthy of the hype, but my brunch experience would tend to make me unlikely to return or recommend it to others.",1,0,0,Taylor Y.,"New York, NY",30,50,0
5.0,9/6/2013,"I have been here twice now and each time was outstanding. This is the first restaurant that always comes to mind when I want a fresh meal I won't feel sick about afterwards. Too bad you to think about wanting to eat here weeks in advance if you want a reservation. But that's what happens when you want to go to an fantastic restaurant. ABC Kitchen is connected to ABC Home (which is a great store to waste 3 hours in on a lazy Sunday). And is also decorated with the ABC Home furnishings which makes for a beautiful setting. The menu is ever-changing and is local, organic, fresh farm-to-table affair.Then entrees I have tried:-Crab toast with lemon aioli: a must!!!!! amazing flavors and so fresh tasting.-Pretzel dusted calamari: an interesting twist on a classic. Wasn't an absolute stand out, but I did enjoy it.-House made spaghetti with sugar snap peas, pistachio pesto and lemon chili crumbs: this dish was fantastic, super fresh tasting, ate every last bite.-Black sea bass with chili and herbs, potatoes and spinach: the fish was perfectly cooked and came in a very light sauce. The dish was tasteful but not super filling, which left me with ample room for dessert.-The salted caramel sundae: I can't remember what exactly was in this, but it was EVERYTHING you could possibly want in a sundae - including some caramel popcorn which added the perfect hint of salty.

I love runny egg! I never had a pizza like this and ABC has SPOILED me... #CravingThisNowI also had the Avocado and Carrot Salad or the Roast Suckling Pig. I really like how tender the pig was with piece of glazed skin(?) and crispy bacon underneath that just really went well together. The salad was different, large spicy charred carrots with sprouts - this dish complimented the pig dish.For dessert, I ordered the caramel popcorn sundae which was a bit overwhelmingly sweet for me. I had a bit of my friends market strawberry which I regret not ordering for myself. The almond cake was so delightful.   SERVICE (5/5)Our server was the sweetest person. Their service was just way above  my expectations. The pizza was cut into the exact # of people dining at our table (5 people unless, they always cut it into 5 pieces). I split my salad and suckling pig, the plating was just impeccable... so ABC split the dishes for you and your dinner date and plate it beautifully for each plate.

2.0,9/3/2013,"I truly suspect that I got in on a rare, but bad night. Really would love to love ABC Kitchen, but just couldn't. I've heard so many rave reviews from credible sources. For years, I've wanted to dine here, though it's always a challenge with reservation...finally scored one over Labor Day weekend. EVERYONE raves about the food...which makes it all the more appealing. Walking in, the decor/ambience is stunning: very romantic and rustic. Our server was really sweet offering to take our picture for us. But the downhill starts here...Our foodrunner and busboy were polite, but cold. Food got dropped on the table without much explanation; ie two random pieces of red radishes we didn't order...uh, what is this for? (Palate cleanser, apparently. I found out mid-meal.) The couple behind us left with their meals untouched...have no idea why.What we ordered:APPS:1. ROASTED CARROT AND AVOCADO SALAD: bleh. Carrots were waaaay too salty, like they forgot to take it out of the marinade. My bf had bigger pieces so his were much better. It's unfortunate, cuz I can imagine the overall dish being great, otherwise.2. PRETZEL CRUSTED CALAMARI: standard. No better than any bars in the city, but you get to pay more here. The pretzel does nothing to the crust besides maybe making it more dense.ENTREE:3. MUSHROOM PIZZA WITH EGG: soggy. I love mushrooms, esp in pizzas, but this is not it. Crowding mushrooms atop a thin crusted pizza....thought the chef would anticipate and remedy the excess liquid. The egg was more gimmicky than a compliment. This is supposed to be gourmet, but execution is standard of a rookie. 4. KASHA AND BOWTIE PASTA WITH VEAL MEATBALL: Horrible. Think french onion soup with meatball and pasta, but on the way too sweet side, no cheese. The sauce was so unpleasant, it made my stomach turn. I couldn't eat it. SIDE:5. ROASTED CORN WITH CHEESE: good. Thank goodness something is. Smh.*The cocktails were good enough, but nothing to raise an eyebrow for.

If they don't know the answer, they ask someone else. They make suggestions and are attentive or can be gotten a hold of. Third, for people who want local, fresh, organic foods, this place couldn't be more ideal. They grow their own herbs, they list the farms from which they source on the back of their menu, the menu has an option for everyone, (safe choices and inventive choices), and the food tastes great.We were a table of six on a Saturday for brunch. The brunch menu has both breakfast and lunch options. Collectively we ordered:1. 3 Akushi Cheeseburgers - Akushi is a type of Japanese cow and it is served with pickled jalapenos and herbed mayo. Comes with fries. Everybody went through the roof for this burger. 3 people with different taste in food ordered this and each one loved it and finished it all.2. French Toast with Vanilled Poached Peaches - uses a thick brioche bread that is soaked overnight, flash fried, and then cooked to order. This produces a crispy exterior and soft, moist interior. The peaches are delicious, but too few! Overall, amazing.3. Ricotta Ravioli - this comes with tomato sauce and thinly grated Parmesan cheese. Honestly it is just not the best. First, the portion is tiny - $15 for 4 small raviolis or $23 for 6. Second, the raviolis are stuffed with ricotta to the brim and then topped with gobs of Parmesan. It is literally like eating spoonfuls of cheese. That's not what I go for in my ravioli, really. Also, too much salt. 4. Scrambled Eggs, crispy oysters and hot sauce butter - great.5. Side of Sauteed Corn - comes with manchego cheese, jalapenos and lime - definitely enough for each person to have a taste, but if you're splitting it as a real side, would feed 2-3. Unique, fresh off the cob, and delicious.6. Zucchini Cake - Good, not a typical dessert. Can't really taste the zucchini and not very sweet, so more like a pound or coffee cake.7. Blueberry Creme Fraiche Ice Cream - everyone went crazy for this.

You know how fast we New Yorkers walk. lol Well, first of all, location, location, location, heart of Union Sq, if you live here, you know that is an awesome area, and if you don't live here, well, I'm telling you, is an awesome area. lol If you don't know this restaurant, you will walk past before you even know is there, the front of the restaurant actually located on 18th Street between Park and Broadway, and the door is tiny, do not look like a 5 stars restaurant, and from the little tiny window next to it, if you walking by, you would thought this is an boutique flower shop or something. Restaurant also have another entrance located on Broadway at the ABC store, is probably one of the most expensive store I seen in a long time, a marble trash can selling for good $600, really? Anyway, let's go back to the restaurant. lol You can enter the store and it connected to the restaurant, the restaurant is huge, is divided out by 3 part, the front which is the front entrance I was telling you guys about, on 18th Street, and the middle section which is more quiet, and also the back, this restaurant actually took out the entire block. My friend and I sat in the middle section, so we can talk and actually hear each other. As usual, my friend always order for me when I go out with her, and we share everything, so we will get a good taste of little bit of everything. We ordered the ""cured meats and local cheeses"", follow by the ""Whole Wheat Pizzas with mushrooms, parmesan, oregano and farm egg"" I don't know about any of you guys, and you guys probably think I'm crazy coming into a fancy 5 stars restaurant ordering Pizza, but I gotta tell you, Jean-George make the best pizza everThat's pretty much all we had, since we are both not that hungry. Overall, I would give a 4 stars, the 1 star I took off is the table, they put us in this table with a very nice soft chairs, but the problem is, this stupid table is very small, they should not put anyone to this table for dinner, more like just 2 people sitting there drinking wine kinda table, you know what I mean?

The only thing I will say is that the servers were strangely trying to clear everything away seconds after we were done, including place mats??

It was served in a whole wheat pita with a tasty relish and some greens. Perfect.

It was worth the wait! The dining room is beautiful and cool in a rustic chic way, the mood is  lively, and the service is spectacular! (I will get to the food in a minute). Tyler was our server, and he was fantastic. He even overheard a toast to a happy birthday to me and brought a beautifully decorated little birthday dessert plate. We were mystified, because no one had told them it was a birthday dinner, but he confessed that he had overheard and arranged for the surprise himself. I felt spoiled to the max.

Nothing special but was quality tomatoes and enjoyable enough. Suffered a bit from ""could have made it at home"" syndrome though.The bad:-Kasha and bow ties - great pasta, great kasha, good meatballs, ruined by an overwhelmingly salty and pungent sauce. Left our throats feeling scratchy...-Suckling pig - overly salty turnips, overly sweetened pork glaze, but very good bacon and crispy skin.-Leeks - bland, chewy, utterly overpriced. Ridiculous that this was served.

This review is primarily for the awesome service I received.I was hosting a party of 9 people for a client dinner two weeks ago on a Tuesday evening.  I had booked a rezzie for 5:30 pm through OpenTable.  Unwittingly, perhaps due to oncoming senescence, I had thought my rezzie was for 6 pm.  Though the restaurant had called me at 5:45 pm to give me final warning, I did not hear my phone and arrived at ABC Kitchen at 6 pm (on time in my head).  They regretfully told me they had to give my table away due to my non-responsiveness. And given the large party size, there would be no more open tables till 9:30 pm.  You can imagine my horror and anxiety of having 7 of my clients taking the subway from Midtown to realize they had no table! No bueno!  Sensing my paranoia, the front staff (Lily) spoke to her manager (Stephen) on what possible options they could do to help.  What saviors they were!!!They managed to put together two tables in the bar area that cozily seated 9 guests.  It was actually a better layout that facilitated easier conversation among all the dinner party.  Thank you Lily and Stephen!!

I'm a huge fan of the restaurant, everything was white, cute decor and lighting.We had the mushroom/oregano/egg pizza which was my top two favorites tonight. The oregano worked well with the pizza. We also ordered the roast suckling pig for an entree which is also my top two. Can't decide which I enjoyed more. The waiter recommended a pasta dish which I forgot what it was, but it had blue cheese in it. Good, but didn't stand out. Fries were also delicious here. For dessert we had the butterscotch pudding, loved that it wasn't too sweet. Can't go wrong with Jean George's restaurants especially this one.",1,1,1,Christine T.,"San Francisco, CA",902,803,1042

5.0,7/26/2013,"There was a time when ABC Kitchen was undisputedly my favorite restaurant in Manhattan. Not ""best"" mind you, just simply my favorite after so many wonderful experiences for all occasions. It was a restaurant that rarely got anything wrong and produced a countless array of quality dishes that were delicious, potent with all sorts of tongue tingling flavors, and remarkable in their consistency and execution. After bursting onto the scene two years ago and winning a bevy of ""new restaurant"" awards, including one from the James Beard Foundation, co-owner Jean-George Vongerichten made the mantra of the restaurant quite simple: local, organic, with nods  to sustainability, presentation, and quality. Countless patrons, reviews, and reservations later, it still remains as one of the city's most popular mid-to-high end dining destinations.The trendy, yet contemporary decor is a nice departure from the other line of JG restaurants. There isn't a night where it isn't bustling with people and reservations are almost always recommended. Sit at the bar for a tasty cocktail or two and if there is time to kill, chance an experience with a walk-in anyway. The food is definitely worth the wait.To suggest that one can't go wrong with ordering anything on the menu may seem a bit ambitious, but my advice is to always heed the seasonal recommendations from the server and then choose a few dishes to share. Go for simple and eat something you know you're likely to enjoy. One can be like regular patrons and constantly shoot for something different. After all, not being afraid to experiment means there are plenty of surprises to be had.Their salads, appetizers, and seafood choices have been the strongest contenders on a plate for me. Salads like a beet or kale salad, which are both wickedly simple but are incredibly tasty and would count for meals on their own. Whether its the chicken liver pate toast or the lump crab meat aioli, or even the kombucha squash toast, all are stellar choices. From the sea bass, salmon, cod to the burger, fried chicken, and homemade sausages, it is all truly tasty and salivating from start to end. If there was anything to avoid, it would be the suckling pig, which at $34 feels like a lot to pay for a small brick of crispy pork.ABCK's price point of $$$ is pretty accurate and quite reasonable considering the variety they offer. Service is always outstanding and the wait staff is usually efficient and knowledgeable about the menu. The knock of course would be their wait times, which for many quality establishments is practically a prerequisite of something wonderful in the making.",25,10,17,Jando S.,"Queens, NY",2723,3529,17072
3.0,7/25/2013,"The food was decent but in my opinion nothing out of the ordinary- like i have to have this deliciousness. I had the pizza with asparagus which seems like a novel idea and was relatively tasty. I wanted to order two dishes of entrees because I heard raves about the food and was eager to try. However the waitress forgot about my order, maybe she was a little hard of hearing? Otherwise despite that, food and service was ok by New York standards, if not a little impersonal.

5.0,7/25/2013,"Finally visited ABC Kitchen this past Monday to celebrate my 30th birthday. We were a large party of 7, and made that reservation nearly a month in advance. If you want to be guaranteed a table, definitely call ahead and make a reservation. (The restaurant is on OpenTable, but OpenTable availability is more limited than if you call directly.)I had scoped out reviews and the menu prior to the meal, and was pretty excited -- happily, the food did not disappoint. The menu at ABC Kitchen relies heavily on seasonal fruits & veggies, which is something I really miss about living in the Bay Area. We began with a few small plates for the table to share: housemade ricotta with strawberry compote and grilled bread, salmon tartare toast with creme fraiche and sesame garlic crumbs, and a squash dish I can't recall exactly (and isn't listed online). All of it was delicious, but the squash and housemade ricotta w/strawberry compote were the standouts. Everyone enjoyed their appetizers and entrees. My roast carrot and avocado salad was AMAZING, as was my housemade spaghetti with sugar snap peas, pistachio pesto and lemon chili crumbs. And then there was dessert. We splurged, because you know, turning 30 and ordered a bunch to share. Truly, it was all really yummy. I'm not an ice cream girl, but surprisingly my favorite dessert was the sundae: salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts and popcorn, whipped cream and chocolate sauce. The ingredients were proportioned perfectly and the popcorn combined with the salted caramel ice cream was straight-up heavenly. TL;DR: This place deserves the hype around it.

5.0,7/23/2013,"this place is truly amazing. its a must try, at least once!Went here with my husband and my 10 month old daughter. they were so accommodating to our needs. We both started with a glass of wine, and the kales & jalapeno salad. it was so good! it has just the right amount of heat, and it was a large portion. We then shared the roasted beet and home made yogurt salad. (mainly bc i wanted my daughter to have some) we all loved it! the yogurt was beyond delicious. Next we had the tuna tartar. it literally melted in my mouth. the flavors in the ""broth"" were so bold yet didnt over power the tunas natural flavors.For dinner, i had the black sea bass with a spicy spinach salad, and my husband had the lobster. Although i do feel my fish was a bit on the small side, the flavor was unbelievable. the heat was just perfect, the spinach had the perfect amount of salt, and the bass was cooked to perfection. crispy skin and flakey inside. my husbands lobster was cooked perfectly as well. i'm not going to lie, we were still a tad bit hungry after dinner, so as we munched on our fries (which btw are like fried in garlic rosemary perfection) we looked over the dessert menu. i had the chocolate cake or something like that. it was sooooooo sweet and savory. perfect end to our dinner. my husband had a glass of port which paired perfectly with the cake.the service was perfect. from the hostess to the food runner, server and manager everything was on point. the food runner even stayed and entertained my daughter for a few minutes which was really cute.the decor is cute. very simple but elegant looking.",1,0,0,Danielle S.,"ROCKAWAY PARK, NY",185,102,7
5.0,7/22/2013,"I heard about ABC Kitchen from a friend who recommended trying it while I was visiting New York. I went there with two of my friends during lunch time on a random day of the week. We didn't have a reservation but the hostess sat us at a table near the bar. The decor of the place was really nice and interesting as it spoke upscale yet modern.Our servers were extremely nice and they came around so often to check up on us or to switch out our silverware that it seemed almost unordinary but I definitely did not mind. i ordered the lunch prix fixe for 32 dollars and had myself the sweet pea soup with carrots and mint which tasted delicious and for pea soup it seemed very light. We had another appeitizer for free due to an error on the server but we did not complain. We didn't even know what it was until the waitress told us it was fluke, which is a very light fish, sprinkled with many different herbs. It had an odd taste but tasty nontheless. For the entree I had the ricotta and farm egg raviolo with chilies, mint and parmesan. The mixture of the sauce and farm egg worked wonderfully together. Everything was perfectly cooked and was also very light. My friends ordered the mushroom, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza which I heard was one of their more popular dishes and it did not disappoint. Cooked wonderfully. And for the dessert, which I would recommend to anyone who goes there, I ordered the lemon bundt cake with whipped cream and orange ice cream. The orange ice cream was a little too sweet for my taste but the lemon bundt cake with small chocolate grazings over it really did it for me. It was heaven after the first bite. My friends assured me they were full before the dessert came but once they saw my expression after the first bite, they had to try it for themselves and they enjoyed every bite.I highly recommend this place if you're visiting in New York as it's a hot spot for not only tourists but locals and celebrities as well. Not too expensive for a semi-upscale place and definitely worth it.

Actually, i'm not crazy about the lights being dimmed because you can't see what you're eating nor the menu. Ok, so expect not so great service. I think they mean well but the place it's packed! So they can't help it.  When I left not a  ""thank you"", nor a ""come again"".But well, the food is GOOD. Had the homemade cherry cistrus soda, you can skip this one. Nothing special, but well refreshing and I liked that it wasn't too sweet. On the other hand I, had the mushroom pizza. Roberta who? I mean this pizza is awesome! if you're into oily things with fresh cheese, you'll love this.  The ingredients feel fresh and the thin crust contributes to the fact that the pizza is not overwhelming despite all the heavy ingredients. The plates and the silverware is amazing, dinning in such beautiful plates really adds to the experience. You can make this dinning experience very expensive by ordering their cocktails or you make it something average by just skipping the alcohol factor.Overall, great food not so great service.

3.0,7/5/2013,"A very good restaurant that's not really worth the hype.  For having to jump through hoops for a dinner reservation before 10 you expect greatness.  Minetta Tavern, for instance, justifies the difficulty of getting a reservation.  ABC Kitchen does not.The food was 60% underwhelming.  While my black sea bass was excellent, both the salmon tartare and the crab toast were only pretty good, overwhelmed by the heaviness of the toast (eat the seafood by itself first).  The ricotta pasta was mediocre; infinitely more tasty varieties can be found at any number of places (see: Babbo).  Service was surprisingly absent-minded; we waited, and waited for our pinot blanc to be refilled, until we finally had to ask one of the service staff to get someone to locate our bottle-gone-missing.  We were basically abandoned for a while, which is poor.  Atmospherically the place is simultaneously Martha Stewart and awkward too-loud music, including a mix of Coldplay (?) and Daft Punk (good, but...over dinner?) with bass that was way too heavy for an evening meal.  If you haven't been to a good NY restaurant before the decor might impress.  But otherwise not so much.In the end, good food with a bit of greatness in the sea bass but there are too many other good options in the city to be desperate for a reservation here.",0,0,0,Amir N.,"Manhattan, NY",1,23,0
5.0,7/5/2013,"This restaurant is everything you can wish for in a dining experience. Rustic interior, impeccable service, a green sensibility and of course amazing cuisine.Everything in the restaurant is either upcycled, from the cardboard on the menus, or locally sourced (vintage plates, artwork) and ingredients from the local green market at Union Square.Food is only half of a dining experience, but in this instance, it definitely wows and is a credit to legendary chef jean-georges. Our first time there, we indulged in some of the dishes that had been recommended - including the crab toast, roasted carrot salad (a must!) and the homemade spaghetti with sugar snap peas. The pasta dish was like spring in a bowl and I love that they change the dishes to match the season's offerings.For a main entree I got the mushroom, parmesan and farm egg pizza and my fiance got the slow cooked halibut, which he deemed to be the most perfectly cooked halibut he's ever eaten. It's a tough fish to get just right, so quite the compliment!For dessert, there were so many tasty options, but we had to go with their signature dish - the sundae with salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts and popcorn and chocolate sauce.One of the most amazing dinners I've ever had and I can't wait to go back!",0,0,0,Wendy G.,"Atlanta, GA",41,168,18

5.0,7/4/2013,"The outside is unassuming. It's a small sign starved door within a large building block. The inside almost replicates Anthropologie, from the upcycled frames to the worn wood floors. The servers wear etsy-esque floral aprons. The whole thing is so darn cute!!!Sure, there are plenty of places that do the farm fresh to table concept, but not quite like ABC and not quite as delicious. The serving sizes are a tad small, but makes up in big flavors. The vegetables de jour are all piled up on a big table right outside the kitchen, so you get to witness chefs coming out, smelling and feeling out the vegetables for quality. Then you get it see it on your plate. We ordered the carrot avocado salad, as recommended by yelp. The carrots were surprisingly small, but few bites in, and we had no complaints - it was delicious. The most notable part of the dinner was the suckling pig. Tender, juicy and flavorful. The skin is roasted to be crisp for bite. The whole meal was a bit on the pricey side, as we didn't leave full at all. Our satisfaction was full though!

5.0,7/4/2013,"My sister booked her birthday dinner at ABC Kitchen and from the pictures and website proclaiming ECO-friendly food, locally produced, etc. it looked nice. However, the pictures and website didn't do the place justice...You enter through a door that looks like they found it at the local dump (flaking paint, acid-washed glass) into a small-ish waiting area that borders the bar. It's pretty dark, so I didn't register how BIG the place was until our goddess of a hostess showed us to our table (she was at least 2 m tall in her heels with a long flowy dress and cropped jean jacket... oh, and she had a short punky mohawk. Her style and air screamed COOL).The building is like a warehouse, with exposed ceiling and pipework... but despite this it was very warm and inviting. The lighting was installed in a way that each table got its own warm, dimmed spotlight, creating initimate areas (an amazing feat considering what I previously mentioned). The plateware was a collection of odd bits and ends with what looked like country dish-towels as napkins, cute.Our amazing waitress for the night was a woman in her 20's... she was fast, funny (without being overbearing), talkative (without making us feel intruded upon), and always knew when to show up at the table for re-fillings and orders. I swear, she must have been telepathic.I ordered the fried organic chicken with rainbow chard and hot sauce butter (which was HUGE, more like 2 chickens... needless to say I couldn't finish it despite it being delicious) with a NY double IPA. My mom and sister both ordered whole-wheat pizzas with a double IPA for mom and homemade soda for my sister -- both were highly satisfied. Even though the food and drink were top-notch, the high point of the dinner would have to be the dessert. Our waitress came out with a chocolate-rich mini-cupcake complete with candle on a plate decorated with chocolate sauce that spelled out 'Happy Birthday' for my sister (she was delighted). We all three also ordered their sorbets, chocolate mint for my sister and meyer lemon sorbet for mom and I.OMGOMGOMGI haven't had a sorbet that tasted that good since I ate my weight in gelato in Rome, Italy (I am aware they are not the same thing... but the smoothness and powerful flavors were exactly the same). You can tell that they use organic ingredients when they make their sorbets. They taste like they're supposed to taste, nothing artificial about them.We rounded up with a cup of steaming hot coffee and floated out of ABC Kitchen on little clouds as the Hostesses smiled and waved good-bye.We'll be back, for sure.(My score: 9.5/10)",0,0,0,Emily C.,"Linköping, Sweden",1,15,6

3.0,6/26/2013,"I admit I was a little hyped up about this place from hearing good things from friends and from being a fan of Jean Georges. My friend (whose review is below!) and I were lucky to get a last minute reservation the same day. The decor was lovely - very whimsical. Our server was friendly and accommodating. We probably took at least half an hour to decide on our food but she kept telling us to take our time. We both got cocktails - a strawberry rhubarb lemonade with vodka for me (I'm a sucker for anything with rhubarb) and she got a cucumber fizz (wine cooler with cucumber flavor). The drinks were great! Especially the cucumber one - cucumber doesn't have a strong flavor but somehow they were able to infuse the wine with a very distinct cucumber flavor! I would come back for drinks if they weren't so pricey - $16 a pop. We shared a meats and cheeses plate to start - which was good. Nothing to write home about. For our mains, she got the sea bass and I got the halibut. The halibut was a little bland and the sauce was a little sweeter than I expected. The sea bass was cooked nicely and had a good crisp on the outside. However, in the few bites I tried of the sea bass, I found a bunch of bones! I probably would have choked on them if i wasn't such a careful eater when it comes to fish! We skipped on dessert since we were going to try out Doughnut Plant.Overall, it was a bit underwhelming.

My drink was very refreshing and it was their cucumber wine cooler or something like that. Who would have thought that you can get a cucumber flavor in wine?? However, the entree was probably where it didn't go as well as we had imagined. I got the black sea bass and she got the halibut. The sea bass still had BONES in there! It wasn't just one bone, it was 3-5. That disappointed me...the halibut on the other hand was sweet and tender. Everything was good but not up to where we had envisioned it to be.

Awesome!We showed up on a Friday night at 8 without reservations...we were told our options were to wait for seats at the bar or wait for a high-top table (in the front bar area) to become available. We told them either option would work...and we probably only waited about 15-20 minutes for a high top, which wasn't so bad since we were able to sit along the wall and order cocktails in the meantime.(Obviously, if you're keen to sit at a normal table with the rest of the well-heeled, trendy crowd that comes to ABC, make a reservation at least a couple of weeks in advance! The high-top was okay but definitely not the full ABC experience.)Food/ambience/service was excellent.

4.0,5/25/2013,"I'm going to basically agree with the sentiment on here.  Very good ingredient first food.  Had really excellent crab toast, carrot and avocado salad and halibut.  The preparation of the carrot (deep flavor substituting it for a protein) was one of the more interesting dishes I've had in NY (I eat out plenty).  I found myself thinking about the food more after this dinner than anywhere I've eaten in quite awhile. They also have a well constructed menu and wine list. Why not 5 stars?  A few reasons. 1.  It is painfully loud. Maybe they should get some carpets from ABC carpet.  I wouldn't go with a group larger than 4.2.  It's a scene with models etc.  Maybe that's your thing, but I don't personally feel it adds to the experience.  I found myself laughing at the collections of people and behavior at some of the tables...i.e a family of 4 with small children eating at a table for 8 at 11pm.  Wife was clearly a model/had been one.  Other restaurants probably wouldn't have tolerated this sort of thing, but I suspect they were special. All this excitement makes getting reservations exceedingly difficult if you don't have a personal assistant to stake out your reservation (to be clear I don't really hold against them being popular maybe just a bit on how/to whom they seem to allocate reservations).3. I don't know why some places do this, but can I have one server to take care of me for the night?  I think we had three people.  It's strange and disconcerting.  I mean to bring over my meal or whatever fine, but why is one person explaining the menu and another then taking  my order?  Bizarre. Overall though its a destination place and deserves to be.  I'll be back, but there are some things holding it back.",1,0,0,Steven S.,"Manhattan, NY",172,69,1

They had about 4 fish entrees, 1 fried chicken and 1 pork.  I ended up with a pasta entree with spring vegetables and peccorino cheese that was good.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the restaurant was so noisy!  I liked the music they played, but the volume level was more like a club than a restaurant.

The calamari was okay, not bad, but I've had better. Salmon entree was good, but also tasted like mint. Sometimes too much mint can taste like toothpaste, but I suppose it offsets having a fishy breath from the salmon. The veggies tasted fresh.

My friend had the fried oysters and she said she had no compliant at all. And she kept saying her ice tea was one of the best she've ever had and she ended up ordered two.

Not only were they all fantastic, but you could truly taste the freshness of each dish. It makes a difference when you use locally sourced ingredients. Everything was made to perfection and BURSTING with flavor. My tastebuds are not that sensitive so something really needs to have flavor for me to taste it--weird I know but I guess that makes me a really good food critic.

Looking around, all the other tables were bathed in a soft light - I wanted that romance too! It took asking twice to have them adjust it. It made a HUGE difference.2) Our waiter was not very forthcoming with descriptions, suggestions or any real finesse. He was pretty curt to (not really) answer our questions, and attempted to take away our utensils while we were still enjoying one of our appetizers. But on to the food - for our appetizers, we had the asparagus & egg salad and the raw scallop. Both were beautiful to look at, fresh, and had the perfect balance of salty/sweet/heat. Perfect way to start the meal.Entrees were: Pasta with spicy rabbit sauce, which was delicious and just the right amount of richness. It would have been nice if they came around with some Parmesan cheese though. The Halibut was cooked to perfection and was in a broth that tasted like magic. It was light and had complex flavors.

But it had to be ordered, you understand, because someone else was paying.I asked if any of the desserts were gluten-free and the waitress kindly brought out a salted caramel ice cream bowl with chocolate sauce and caramel corn.

2.0,4/10/2013,"Bad Service. Bad drinks. Bad food. Nice decoration.I went there with my husband to celebrate our 2nd anniversary. Due to our busy schedules we didn't plan in advance, it was a tuesday and we wanted to stay in the neighborhood.  I called  during the day to make reservation for that night. The lady that picked up the phone was very nice and said they didn't have any more tables, but walk ins were welcome. So we went there and wait patiently for 1h 20 min at the bar  (when she said a table would take 45 min). When we finally had our table, it was  a high table with stools, I asked If she could put us in one of the about 20 empty tables with more comfortable chairs ( my back was hurting after waiting for so long in the bar stools), she wasn't happy but she  said she would see if it was ok. 10 min later she came back, took our waters out of our table and took it to another table without saying a word. When they finally move us to one of the empty tables (it was 10:30 pm, nobody was arriving at that point) we order our food.We had raw scallops- to much cilantro and jalapeno, couldn't taste the scallops at all. My husband had pasta with veal meatballs - the meatballs were good, but the sauce was terrible, tasted like burnt onions and I had the Margarita Pizza. I can cook better then this and I am not a chef!Drinks weren't good and the wine was old (my husband had a pinot noir by the glass and it tasted like it was a week old) Well, thanks to ABC we had a bad memory of our second anniversary, but we will celebrate it again on Friday, going to the opera and a much nicer restaurant.",0,0,0,Brazilian G.,"New York, NY",5,4,0

5.0,4/8/2013,"I normally never write Yelp reviews, but for ABC Kitchen I feel compelled to do so, simply because it was such a fantastic dining experience. I've been to a fair share of restaurants around the city (hole-in-the-walls, Michelin rated, etc), but ABC Kitchen is just so amazing for the following reasons:Food - we had the crab toast (the crab was buttery and flavorful to perfection), avocado and carrot salad (I normally avoid my veggies so you know this is good when even I enjoyed it), fried organic chicken with hot butter sauce (tender and crispy with the best complementary sauce) and asparagus bacon pizza (so cheesy and fresh out of the oven). Of course the salted caramel ice cream sundae was to die for.Service - attentive waiters who weren't overbearing and knew when exactly to come with the drink menu, dessert menu, etc. Enough said.Ambiance - it's a mix between casual and loungey which I loved. Personally I was a huge fan of the wooden accents on the ceiling and the ""earthy"" feel of the place - made the restaurant trendy but not too snobby/stuffy if you get what I mean.Solid 5 stars.",1,1,1,Lena R.,"Manhattan, NY",60,23,3

Strange how something so simple can actually be so flavorful. Highly recommend it.Also tried the kombucha and ricotta on toast. I had to look up what kombucha was afterwards, but it was delicious.

2.0,4/5/2013,"Four of my girlfriends went out to celebrate a friend's birthday at abc last Saturday for lunch and we were stoked after hearing all the awards and accolades received by the famous Jean-Georges. We started off with chicken liver toast, crab toast, pretzel-dusted calamari and a variety of drinks (yuzu c, lemonade, and rhubarb royal- all of which were delicious and as advertised). The apps were fine. Best I've ever tasted? No. But it was good. Not the most original or creative menu, but the meal just began and I wanted to enjoy the experience as much as possible.  Everything was going very well. The ambience was just right, the wait staff perfectly attuned to your needs without being over bearing or stuffy. It felt as if we walked into Anthropologie's restaurant; shabby-chic, sweet without being cloy (even down to the mismatching plaid/flannel shirts worn by every server and worker), life-sized trees placed strategically throughout to make you feel as if you are outdoors aka relaxed, with pleasant ambient lighting so everyone looks their best. We munched on bread with oil and salt, enjoying conversation. Then our entrees arrived and everyone was happy with their food. I ordered the pizza of the day (figs, ricotta cheese and prosciutto) which was lovely. I don't recall exactly what everyone ordered but I know my cousin, K, ordered a dish with oysters. My friend, J, ordered a dish with salmon. The birthday girl, B, ordered the same pizza I did and my friend G, was full on apps. We topped off the meal with the must-have sundae. It was really sweet but I suppose desserts are meant to be. And then we left. It was great. Wonderful. Sunday passed. Monday night arrived and I started to feel funny. Tuesday morning my stomach started spasing out. I had the runs. Oh great. Must've been something I ate Monday for dinner. I also felt slightly feverish and oddly achey, but went to work nonetheless. By Tuesday night I had a high temperature alternating with uncontrollable chills that shook my body for hours at a time a well as a mind numbing headache. And of course, the runs. Every 20 minutes on the dot. I thought I maybe had the flu? Took some Motrin. I was supposed to meet my friend J on Wednesday but I felt even worse and told her my condition. I was shocked when she texted me that she had the same exact symptoms all developing the same time as me. We asked the other girls. They were all suffering the cruelties of....food poisoning. Long story short, I had 3 IV bags dripped into me, I'm on a variety of meds and I'm pretty sure I don't want to eat any of the above mentioned food for awhile. My BM lasted 4 straight days and counting. We contacted the manager and he was quite apologetic and sincere, asking us to return again so that he could ensure we have a pleasant memory of abc kitchen. I would never, ever wish what I endured upon my worst enemy. My cousin, K'a doctor took a stool sample so we will know soon enough if it was salmonella or E. coli or something else. Please, please be careful when you eat out. I think it was a beautiful place, but something went awry in their food preparation, handling or delivery. We couldn't have all developed the same symptoms coincidentally. Oh, and my friend G, who only ate apps? She just had her wisdom tooth extracted the day prior and was on antibiotics so she didn't feel a thing.",4,0,0,Caroline S.,"Queens, NY",35,33,4

2.0,4/2/2013,"If I were merely rating the FOOD here, the star value would certainly be 5 stars.  Yes, that high and yet, that low... So, I will start with what they do right - the food.  We got an appetizer of this fried squash with goat cheese and honey and deliciousness.  YUM!!  Then our entrees consisted of the fried chicken which was just perfectly fried and had a little bit of spice to make it the most juicy and delicious fried chicken ever!  Beyond that,  I cannot give more than two stars because when we walked in to be seated, the hostess hardly spoke to us - she just indicated for us to follow her and then she proceeded to march us past all of the roomy tables and then past the cozy tables for two and then she sat us off in a dim corner between a makeshift wall (with fabric covering the hidden area behind - perhaps a breakroom?) and the kitchen door... at a weird table for one that literally was a tree trunk or something resembling a puzzle piece and sat us in old chairs that the stuffing was missing out of the center of the seats!!  It was ATROCIOUS!!  The hostess dropped us off and then it took ten minutes for a server to come and bring us water and take our drink orders.  The service continued to be painfully slow and then somewhere between the delivery of our apps and our entree, I guess our server went home and never mentioned to anyone that we needed a new server.  After waiting 30 minutes past finishing our meals, I finally got up to find ANYONE to bring us the check!  We WANTED to order dessert and after dinner drinks but between trying to balance our plates on this Dr. Suessian table and the fear of never getting the attention of another wait staff again, we decided to cut our losses.  Interestingly, another couple was seated about ten minutes after we came in.  I observed that they were given a spacious and normal table and they received their meals before our order was ever taken.  What the Fraggle Rock?  I am posting photographs of our table and chairs because this scene was too unfreaking believable.  I am so tempted to downgrade the star rating to only one star but the food truly was outstanding.",2,0,0,L S.,"New York, NY",4,89,44

2.0,3/31/2013,"The name, Jean-Georges, is synonymous with excellence in dining in NYC. With this expectation, I was excited to finally try ABC Kitchen, the 2011 James Beard Award winner for Best New Restaurant. I arrived early and stepped into a well-decorated dining room. I felt like I had walked into an Anthropologie. The menu prices were certainly on par. However, when it came to the food, I was beyond disappointed. In fact, the meal was downright bad.Our party started off with three appetizers to share. The chicken liver toast tasted off. The pâté didn't have the smooth, velvety texture and there was no sweet ingredient to balance the flavors out. The pretzel dusted calamari was pedestrian. I cannot justify paying $16 for such a boring bowl of squid. There was nothing pretzel-dusted about it. The accompanying marinera and aioli has been done and overdone. Lastly, the roast carrot and avocado salad was nice, but again, nothing special. Onto the main courses. I had the black sea bass with chilies and herbs, with baby market potatoes and spinach. Sea bass is extremely difficult to overcook, yet somehow, they managed to find a way. The fish itself was completely bland. The chilies were so spicy to the point of making the entire dish unenjoyable. The chef was also a bit heavy-handed with the herbs - I think it was tarragon combined with the potatoes. I also tried the roasted maine scallops. If I'm only getting three small scallops, they better be perfectly cooked. Nope. They were rubbery and again, overcooked. Scallops can be easily seared and cooked within 5 minutes, so I don't quite understand how this happened in an hour. The one good dish was the whole wheat cavatelli with spicy rabbit ragu, ham and pecorino. The rabbit was very flavorful and the pasta was well done. The dessert. Everyone talked about the sundae with salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts & popcorn, with whipped cream, and chocolate sauce. I did enjoy the salted caramel ice cream and popcorn, but the chocolate sauce was overwhelmingly sweet. If there was one dish that could cause diabetes on that menu, that would be it. Overall, the menu was unimaginative and there were several execution errors. The plating didn't even look nice. How this restaurant won a James Beard Award is beyond me.

4.0,3/26/2013,"Went there on a rainy Passover monday for a late lunch with a girlfriend.Both of us ordered the set lunch  that  started off with the butternut squash soup. It was delicious! It's not your typical thick hearty soup. Light, not too sweet, was it truffle oil or something else that made it more savory? It was just plain salt, it had a bit of complexity to it.  Perfect soup for a wet and cold afternoon.Next,  I had the crispy skate salad. The portion was overwhelming for me. It was good. I wish it wasn't so heavy on the tartar sauce and they gave it a bit more of a tang to it. Maybe vinaigrette on the side? We noticed the ladies beside us ordered a la carte and every dish of theirs seemed smaller than ours, but perhaps they ordered small plates, sides and not main course. My friend enjoyed her ravioli, she devoured that but left the ragout meat since it was filling. We both had the sundae to finish off. We thought we were full, but when we started having the salted caramel popcorn sundae with fudge and all .... we were in heaven. Initially we thought one scoop of ice cream is sufficient, but we devoured the two that came with it. It was that good. I spent the next 2 hours trying to walk off just the fudge. Going out of order here... basil lime daiquiri was nothing to write home about. It was way too sweet even though it was really strong. We almost wanted to ask for that in a Bellini format instead. Service was good. I didn't like the fact there were a few of us at the bar with 2pm reservations and they kept us at the bar for a while when clearly there were tables in the back with place settings ready for patrons.

In true New York  City fashion I dinned alone (and this was a great spot to do it). I started with the much discussed roasted beets with the house made yogurt-great texture and layers and because the chef thought I was an ardent food critic he sent compliments over-the roasted kabocha squash toast, just kidding(the kitchen forgot my order, wasn't in a rush-brought my wk with me). The toast was a brilliant combination, a sweet taste from the squash and a tart taste from the apple cider vinegar. Main-I was suspect over the veggie burger...its a veggie burger, but I had to think about how much this lunch was costing me, so it should be pretty good or I was going to slam them on YELP....The veggie burger was great...I totally recommend it and I really liked the fact that it was in a pita, very filling but light if that makes sense.

I would opt to try the donuts -- oh my GOSH, they are so SO good-- or even better yet, if you are brave, you can take on the salted caramel ice cream sundae, which is literally orgasmic. Yes, I order this gigantic king of all desserts even at brunch, and yes, I savor every last morsel and spoonful. Salted caramel ice cream, peanuts and popcorn, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce to top it off. It is AMAZING. Absolute BLISS. To die for.

5.0,3/18/2013,"I've been here for dinner but this past weekend I came to check out their brunch (posted pictures).  To start we ordered from the market table their squash toast with apple cider & ricotta cheese.  My favorite dish, the flavor was perfect.  I'm a huge fan of foie gras so I decided to try the chicken liver, it was too overwhelming in taste.  The eggs benedict is always a solid bet and they did a good job, cooked perfectly.  For the table to share we tried the french toast, reminded me of Jane's with some stuffing inside.  I love having sweet & savory.  The salmon & potato cakes looked appealing but didn't stand out.  Service was on point, didn't expect anything less from a visit to one of JG's establishments.  Loved the large open space with white tables & had a very homey feel.  We were seated near the kitchen/ farm veggies area, adorable!

4.0,3/18/2013,"Wow ABC Kitchen is def worth the hype!! My date and I started off the night with the crab toast and roasted carrot and avocado salad. Both were amazing. We had ordered these dishes due to the great number of people who suggested it on yelp and from friends who had been to the restaurant as well. The crab toast was so delicious with the perfect amount of crab on top and the toast had just the right amt of crunchiness. The roasted carrot and avocado salad was so fresh and tasted so healthy. My date went on to say it was the best salad he's had and he's not even much of a carrot fan.  For the entrees, we had a hard time choosing between the pizzas because they all sounded so amazing. We decided to try the mushroom, parmesan, oregano, and farm egg pizza because it's a pizza very unique to ABC Kitchen. We were not disappointed. It's a must try especially for mushroom lovers! The egg definitely added a nice touch to the pizza. I was worried because I read some reviews that said that the egg made the pizza too soggy. But as long as you're eating it as soon as the pizza comes out, I didn't think of it to be too much of an issue. I def recommend this pizza! We also orded the suckling pig. I really like how they split the portions for you if you tell them you are sharing. We each got a portion of the suckling pig that was the perfect size for us because we were def getting really full. And on top of all our dishes, the chef provided a complimentary dish which was a sea bass with potatoes and spinach in a delicious soup broth. Even though we were both full, we finished every little bite. Boy were we stuffed!But for dessert lovers, there's always room for dessert right? I had to get the Sundae everyone was talking about. Amazing! Salted caramel ice cream with candied peanuts and popcorn with chocolate sauce. I def finished that with a quickness. Delicious!I will def be back! Even the interior was worth the hype. So beautifully decorated inside!I wanted to give ABC Kitchen 5 stars but I gave it 4 because our server was pretty slow. She took a while to fill my wine glass so I had to drink it extra slow when I was nearing the bottom of my glass. Every time we needed her, she didn't seem to be around. However, the person filling the water glasses was always on top of it and made sure we always had water in our glasses. Everyone was really nice but our service was pretty slow that day.",1,0,0,Jenn W.,"Fort Lee, NJ",14,37,11
4.0,3/17/2013,"3.6 stars.  Cute restaurant in the Flatiron District.  The more time I spend here, the more I'm impressed with all the great sights and dining in the area. We tried the chicken liver, ricotta with a marmalade on toast, and beets with yogurt sauce for our appetizer.  I thought that though they were all good, the most flavorful was the beets.  As you'd imagine, it was very refreshing, and surprisingly delicious.For my entree I chose the roasted carrot with avocado salad.  Though it was good, the mushroom, parm, and egg pizza was better.  Especially if you like white pizzas, you can appreciate this one.  My husband thinks it's comparable to Eataly's.  Not so much NY style, more italian.  I also tried the whole wheat pasta with rabbit ragu.  I'm not a big meat sauce fan and whole wheat pastas are tricky.  I thought it was decent for what it was.",0,0,0,Lan N.,"Wichita, KS",46,703,52
3.0,3/17/2013,"Can't decide if this place is a furniture store or an actual restaurant. I admit, the place was beautiful. After waiting in line outside in the morning cold, I felt like I stepped into a nice summer day in California. Every table was adorned with cute flowers and matching floral dish sets. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. We couldn't decide on our cocktails, and they let us customize our drinks! Ah, but if only the food was as good as the place looked. The brunch menu was limited and honestly nothing out of the ordinary. I ordered the spinach and goat cheese omelette, hoping that at least the food quality would be terrific. The omelette was flat and lacked the usual fluff. The spinach was all on one side, and the cheese on the other (it felt like I was eating two separate omelettes..). The only thing that really pleased me was that the potatoes on the side were cooked well. But that wasn't what I wanted. Basically, A+ on the decor and the service. Still, at the end of the day it's a restaurant, and I don't understand why people love this place.

4.0,3/14/2013,"Came here on a weeknight with a good friend. We had no expectations as we were getting our ABC Kitchen cherry popped simultaneously. The decor was very simple, yet modern. My friend and I had seen a number of establishments attempt to present themselves as eco-friendly by using old Ragu bottles as cups and paper towels made with recycled material, so we weren't so impressed...until we read their mission statement, of sorts, on the back of the menu. Everything, from the napkins and silverware to the tables and candles were handmade, recycled and/or refurbished. We were impressed with not only the conscious effort to be eco-friendly with the decor but the food being grown locally, them patronizing small farms, in addition to using non-GMO and cruelty-free animals for their meat. All the aforementioned made this San Francisco native VERY happy!We began with the housemade ricotta and grilled bread. I'm a vegan-tarian, (only eat cheese and some foods that contain dairy) and the ricotta tasted like pure milk, butter and egg whites. My friend enjoyed it a lot and practically ate it all himself lol For my meal, I had roasted brussel sprouts and the mashed potatoes. The sprouts were delish but the mashed potatoes were too creamy. My friend had the char grilled chicken and he absolutely loved it. For dessert, I had the doughnuts and my friend had the salted caramel ice cream. Both were very good and not too sweet, however the doughnut was less flavorful. I'll probably try something else the next time I go.A fantastic establishment to dine with good food, great service and great ambiance. I definitely plan to go again and try new items.   4 stars for the noise level and for the horrid pop music blasting on the speakers. Is this a damn club or restaurant?

However, as a girl with the best girlfriends she could ask for, ABC Kitchen was chosen to be place to have my belated birthday lunch. I had no clue what a treat I was in for!The restaurant itself is beautiful. It's modern, cute with a warm, inviting ambiance. Just looking around as we waited for our table to be set made my heart flutter. The staff here are exceptional, which definitely made the experience much more enjoyable. We came towards the end of lunch service at 3pm and even as the place emptied out, they never tried to kick us out! As we left about 2hrs later, we realized they were having their staff meeting. I appreciate that they let us be despite that. Our waitress overheard that it was my birthday and as as surprise, they brought out a heavenly dark chocolate mini cupcake with a candle on it! They even decorated the plate around the cupcake and wrote ""happy birthday"" around it!As always, we were a little ambitious and ordered a couple too plates too many. We were bursting out of our clothes in the end! Everything we ate was superb except for the bowtie pasta with veal meatballs. While it was good, it wasn't as memorable as everything else we ate. We mainly ordered a lot of their seafood dishes, each was fantastic. We were even given their Tuna Sashimi on the house and it was delicious. Their kale salad is one of the best I've had - the combination of kale, chili, mint and lemon was simply scrumptious. Do not miss out on the desserts, no matter how full you may feel. Their ice cream is divine - I was a big fan of their lemon sorbet! I was told getting a reservation here is difficult but be determined and get a table because ABC Kitchen will rock your taste buds!

5.0,2/28/2013,"I really love ABC Kitchen!! So impressed. This place definitely met my expectation and actually even exceeded it.Reservation is MUST as this place is so popular that its spot are fileld out very quickly. I always come for Sunday brunch, sometime in the morning or sometime later at 2pm-ish. My review is based on their weekend brunch menu. First, look at the drink menu before moving into the food menu. Their cocktail list is really great; especially its Bloody Mary is dangerously delicious as much as I can say this is the best in the city! I just crushed with their Bloody Mary and had as many as THREE glasses for one Sunday brunch!!! Appetizer/salad - Crab Toast with lemon aioli: fresh but not amazingly impressive. - Raw Diver Scallops with lemon verbena: this was also fresh but not amazing. Should go well with white wine. - Roast Carrot And Avocado Salad with crunchy seeds, sour cream and citrus: Now I agree with all of the hypes about this salad at Yelp. Yes, this is MUST-EAT at ABC kitchen. You can feel what ""Organic dish"" truly is.Brunch entree- Smoked salmon: TO DIE FOR! One of the best smoked salmon dish in manhattan, I would dare say. Really fresh and flavorful. It's perfect to have with white wine.- Housemade Ricotta Ravioli herbs and tomato sauce: I really loved this dish. You can choose either 4 or 6 pieces. Truly handmade, substantially filled with soft ricotta cheese. Their tomato sauce can't be compared to other italian places in manhattan. - Spinach goat cheese and herbs pizza: The dough is very yammy. Goat cheese in great quality and flavor. So fresh spinach. Impeccable. - Mushrooms parmesan with farm egg pizza: It was okay but too much mushrooms which smell very strong so that I can hardly taste/enjoy parmesan cheese and egg. **Tip - ABC kitchen makes their own organic tomate ketchup. Ask your server to bring this ketchup and dip the pizza dough in it. Pretty good combination.Dessert- Salted caramel ice-cream MUST TRY!!! Their lemon sorbet is also amazing.

3.0,2/20/2013,"For a classy dine-in restaurant, I expect high quality foods with superb taste. And although ABC provides great quality, the taste always seemed to be on the strong, pungent side. We came in with a table reserved for 20 people, and with a set-menu of approx 3 drinks per person, the total turned out to be about $140 per person. I liked that they provided small portions of a enormous variety of foods, so I felt pretty satisfied with both the variety and amount of food we got. Here's what we got and my ratings:AppetizerHousemade ricotta with grilled bread: 4/5. I LOVED the ricotta, it was SO good that I wanted to put it on everything! The ricotta itself was one of my fav items of all the appetizers, but this dish was RUINED by the 'grilled' bread, which was actually SCORCHED rather than grilled. It was so black at the edges that it gave the bread a very bitter taste. Crab toast with lemon aioli: 2/5. The lemon is much too strong and sour. It ruined the sweet taste of the crab.Roasted beets with housemade yogurt: 2/5. The roasted beets was good, but I still can't figure out why they decided to put it on top of the yogurt, which was very acidic. It doesn't help that the beets sweet so that the yogurt tasted more sour. Those two just DID NOT complement each other well. Raw scallops: 3/5. I prefer SLIGHTLY cooked scallop over raw scallop, because raw scallop has no taste whatsoever. However they did well in adding the right spices to make it taste fine. Overall, meh. Tuna sashimi: 3/5. Again, another 'meh' item. The tuna lacked the buttery taste that I usually find in tuna sashimi.Roasted butternut squash: 5/5!! My FAV of the entire appetizer. It was simple yet delicious. No extravagant spices that clashed on the palate. Mushroom, Parmesan, egg pizza: 2/5. I love mushroom pizza, I love egg, and I love parmesan. But together on a thin burnt crust just = no bueno. A bit too heavy for my taste. Entree:Roast pig: 4/5. I really enjoyed the sweet onions on top, and the tenderness of the pork. They even left a nice crispy skin on the very top layer that tasted like bacon. However the sauce was just too overwhelming. I wished they would just use the basic juices from the roast pig as the base, but again, everything about French food is all about STRONG tastes, so the sauce was again too flavorful. The presentation was nice though.  Side: Roasted brussel sprouts: 3/5. WHY do they SMOKE everything so that it's scorched?! I understand if you lightly burn meat or bread in the grilling or toasting process, but seriously vegetables too?! I like my veggies fresh and cooked as little as possible to retain their vitamins, thanks.Dessert:Chocolate cake: 2/5. Too sweet. Unless you're a dark-chocolate lover then you may just like it. Otherwise, too bitter for my taste. Red wine poached pear with hazelnut ice cream: 4/5. The pear was very tasty, but I could only do about 3 bites of it and then I'm done. I give them props for using red wine in making a very unique and creative sauce. However, they should have just drizzled it over the pear rather than DROWN the entire thing. The hazelnut ice cream, on the other hand, was DELICIOUS!Seasonal doughnuts: what can I say, they're donuts! They taste like normal donuts, but with more dough. Not your usual-light-krispy-kreme donuts and much better quality than your store-bought-packaged hostess crap. I've got high standards if you're going to charge $140 per person. Cost must equate to quality! GREAT table settings though- I loved the candles and the fresh flowers, but terrible furniture. I was sitting on white plastic lawn chairs that my coat kept slipping off of because it was so shiny and hard and well, plastic-y. Perhaps some of those fancy antler-looking decor should have been converted into coat hangers, because those chairs were certainly not high enough to keep my coat off the ground (when it DID hang), and trust me, I'm a short gal!",2,0,1,Rose W.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,166,465

Let's talk about the food.To start we shared the crab toast and raw scallops.  A complementary appetizer, the kale salad was also brought out.  The crab was tender and delicious, with a hint of spice and creamy texture, mixing perfectly with the buttery toast.  The scallops were sweet, with a hint of spicy and tangy flavors.  The kale was simple and delicious with a hint of mint and chiles.  Then came the mushroom pizza...with a runny egg. I can't say in words how delicious this pizza tasted, because the words do not exist. I will come back here just to eat this over and over again.  Amazing. For entrees (yes, shockingly, my companion and I are still eating), I had the artic char and my friend had the suckling pig.  My fish was well cooked and tasty, but the olive oil sauce was a little too much for me.

5.0,2/12/2013,"Rarely encountered such a degree of awesomeness. Everything, from the food to the wine to the service to the decor was picture perfect. Starting with the food: kambucha squash crostini with ricotta and caramelized onions, roasted broccoli with pistachio vinaigrette for appetizers. Both fantastic, the first one lusciously so, but well-balanced by the crispness of the second. An excellent light start, opening up to an equally fab entree combo: seared scallops with pink peppercorn and a lemony veloute, accompanied by arctic char with sweet and normal potatoes in a decadent yet delightful sauce (such ability to combine those two sensations...). Everything was coursed out without us even asking, and the service was attentive without being overbearing. Opted for a local North Fork gewurztraminer at $50 and were not disappointed in that department either - great balance between acidity and fruitiness, with layers of texture oozing on the palate. The ambiance is fantastic, too: rustic modern decor (bricks, white wood, black & white pix), lots of table space for a proper foodie party but also a very nice bar at the entrance for walk-ins and drinks.

5.0,2/10/2013,"Absolutely loved it here!  We couldn't get a reservation until 11p for a Saturday night and figured, we would just build our night around it and make ABC our last stop.  Got there probably closer to 11:30p and had no issues.  We were told the kitchen closed at 11:30p so we had to make our food decisions quickly - luckily we already knew we wanted to try to the pizza.  We picked out a butternut squash appetizer and two pizzas (mushroom/egg & ricotta/date); then asked our waiter if we should try anything else - he recommended the crab toast (so good!).  Our waiter was so pleasant and helpful, even though we only had a few minutes to order, we never felt rushed.  All of the portions were perfect and we even took some left overs home which were great heated up today for lunch.  The restaurant itself has a calm, romantic atmosphere - perfect for date night.  We would definitely go back.",1,1,0,Nicki H.,"Manhattan, NY",6,18,7

Been in the industry for a while and cant recall the last time I felt so much was worth so little. Bad experience from start to finish. Chilly service from jump. Douchey and aggressive bar crowd topped it off. Everything is overpriced but the jewels in the $$$$$ crown are the standard fare drinks and the beyond skimpy tuna sashimi appetizer. Have had 2 progressively waning experiences and thought I'd give it a 3rd go in the hopes that they could turn things around.

Pretty small portions but that was fine for me because I wasn't starving. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things but both dishes- veal meatballs and the ravioli, were just alright.

You know that shit is $9.99 a bottle at the store down the street...What blew my mind, though, were the raw diver scallops. Melt-in-your-mouth kinda nonsense.

4.0,2/6/2013,"One of my favorite place in the Flatiron area. Good for lunch on weekdays, in particular if you work in fashion, art, music industries. In the evening, it's a perfect place for bringing a date, or a group of (20's or 30's) friends. Getting a table in the evening without a reservation is possible, but you maybe asked to wait at the bar, for an hour / an hour-and-half. If you decide to eat by the bar or on the few tables around the bar, it's quicker, but nosier, and you will miss the decor of the all white / barn dining room.In Winter, they proposed a special white truffle pizza for  US 140, delicious but a little bit too small.

5.0,1/30/2013,"First and foremost, I have to give 2-3 stars for customer service. I called the day before I was taking clients to dinner and needed a reservation for 7 at 6:30PM (main dinner rush on a weekday). The hostess found us a table, which was unbelievable considering I haven't been able to get in here for months. I'm really grateful for her working to find us a place with such short notice.The ambience/decor of this restaurant is straight from the parent store, ABC Home... and I love it. We say at a large, round table that looked like a slice of tree trunk. It was gorgeous - and I enjoy sitting at a round table in order to have better conversation within a large group.We started with a bottle of Pinot Noir and another red recommended by my co-worker. Both wines were very good and reasonably priced. We started with two of the toasts (the crab was good, but the vegetable option was amazing), the meat/cheese plate, ricotta, scallops and a truffle dish. The truffle was by far my favorite of the starters. Small portions, so if you're with a large group, you should get 4-5 at least to share.I had the scallops as my entree and they were perfect. Seared and soft, not overcooked and lightly flavored. Three clients had the scallops, and they also enjoyed them.We split a number of desserts, and since I'm a sweet-tooth person, this was my favorite part of the meal (or any meal for that matter). We got the Apple Pie, the Doughnuts, the Sundae and the Cheesecake. The winner in my book was the Sundae - with carmel sea salt ice cream, fudge and whipped cream, it was the highlight of the dessert course.I would highly recommend this to anyone in an industry where they entertain clients.",2,1,1,Lauren C.,"Norwalk, CT",364,228,74

There are so many delicious things on the menu, next time I would want to just share everything instead of ordering my own entree, which ended up feeling like an after thought. Even though we were incredibly stuffed post all of these dishes, we shared two desserts: the salted caramel sundae and the cookie plate. Next time ill stick only to the sundae.

4.0,1/24/2013,"Many praise reports from friends and lovers of brunch on Yelp finally led me to brave the wait on a Saturday early afternoon.  Both my friend and I were a little bit starving and so a lot bit saddened by the 45-min wait.  Once we were seated, though, service was friendly, very speedy but not overbearing.  Yes, the space is beautiful.  The use of gorgeous wood for tables, whitewashed brick walls, and a mix of streamlined and artsy lighting fixtures makes you feel like you've been invited into a magazine-feature kitchen (ba-dump!).  We were seated near the bar and not the inner sanctum, but this location did not interfere with getting prompt service.For appetizer, we went with the popular recommendation for crab toast with lemon aioli and my friend ordered the well-loved spinach & goat cheese pizza.  True to form, I flip-flopped between french toast and pancakes and settled on the latter, which came with lemon curd.  Despite the rave reviews I kept my expectations low because how good can toast and pizza get?  Suffice it to say, I was proven WRONG and quite happily so.  The crab toast was every bit as savory as was promised and I took very slow bites from my piece.  The spinach & goat cheese pizza also surpassed all expectations with flying colors.  It's simple dishes like this that showcase the genius crafting of flavors that NYC has come to expect from Jean Georges.As other people have mentioned, the portions are a bit on the smaller side and that each taste experience felt a tad shorter than I would've wished.  Yet my friend and I left well content.  It's sad that portion control is many times a hidden fee that we have to pay at restaurants that tout the words ""organic"" and ""sustainable"" but it does make sense.  Just not cents.",3,1,4,Jean B.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",130,70,167

The english muffin was not overcooked.I also ordered the calamai for an appetizer and it was okay. It tastes like any other places' calamari. When I was eating the calamari with my fork, I felt a rough texture on my fork. I took the fork out of my mouth and realized that it had dried lettuce stuck on it!

Unfortunately not much ended up being delicious:*Crab Toast - this was very disappointing. The crab itself was fine but the toast was greasy and overly crunchy. I've had far better at Fig & Olive. We were not impressed.*Crispy Delicata Squash - these were basically onion rings dripping in oil. Disgusting. After two focred bites I couldn't eat any more of this dish.*Lentil Soup - decent but not better than Corner Bakery's version at half the price.*Roast Carrot & Avocado Salad - This was super tasty and really the best thing we ate all night. Loved it. It was a bit on the spicy side though.*Spaghetti w/Poached Farm Egg - The egg was cooked perfectly and was delicious. The rest of the dish was unbelievably spicy and very oily. And I'm half-Indian so my spice barometer is fairly high.  *Buffalo Mozzarella Pizza - This was dry and bland. I've had better pizza at CPK. Really.The Bottom Line: So we're obviously in the minority here as most people love this place. Not sure if the packed restaurant led to the sub-par food?

5.0,1/10/2013,One of my favorite places in NYC especially for brunch.  High quality in every way as you would expect from a JG restaurant.   Bring back that ridiculous portobello burger and this is coming from a carnivore that would eat meat 95% of the time!   Awesome drinks.,1,1,1,Loc V.,"Manhattan, NY",27,63,4
4.0,1/10/2013,"Came back for dinner and had a better experience. The spinach and goat cheese pizza was good, but very salty, and the chicken and pork sausage was also pretty tasty.

As far as decor, the restaurant is stunning. If I had an open floor plan apartment I would want it to be designed like this place. Now for the downside.... the food. Everything was mediocre at best.the ok- the beet salad and the goat cheese raspeberry toast.Mediocre- the kabocha squash dish ( undersalted), the spinach pizza ( slightly burnt).the horrible- the brussel sprouts (burnt to a crisp),the soggy fries,  the poached pear dessert which looked like a turd. the service was decent at best, I definitely will not be returning.",5,1,0,Puja M.,"San Diego, CA",273,97,33

3.0,1/6/2013,"ABC Kitchen is solid, but unmemorable.Bread-phenomanal; but I think it's baked by Sullivan Street Bakery.The pretzel-dusted calamari - outstanding.The Pizza with Tomatoes and Buffalo Mozzarella is excellent and part of what made it so good was that it's brought out on a grated metal tray that sits atop an elevated pizza stand. This type of presentation allows the pizza to breathe, thus preventing the crust from getting soggy.  It was a very nice touch.Kasha and Bow-tie pasta Veal Meatballs were just ok.  The veal meatballs were the highlight here. The sauce was a little sweet and rich for my taste.Wood oven Roasted Maine lobster, oregano and Lemon Chile Vinaigrette were gone in four bites, no complaints, and it was easy to eat because the lobster was split in half.For dessert, we ordered the doughnuts; however, I have definitely had better rounds of fried dough elsewhere. They would have been better hot or even warm, ie made recently.  I rate this restaurant at a solid three and a half  stars. While the interior was beautiful, the food was just pretty good, the service was unremarkable and a little slow (it took 2.5 hours to eat this meal).

I was so full i didnt even try the spaghetti but heard it had an unexpected but good spicy kick to it. even being stuffed we ordered 2 sundaes for dessert which were as tasty as promised! 1 is probably enough for 4 people but what the heck, go big or go home. really enjoyed and will definitely be back.",1,0,0,Christina H.,"Manhattan, NY",54,533,110

The service was incredible - our server was prompt, she was friendly, and she corrected a mistake with our order immediately. Their cocktail on Tuesday was also fantastic. I am giving ABC Kitchen four stars because the pork was nothing special. I could've easily found a pork dish as good or better for a lot less than $35.

It's right next to the ABC Store, but it's not too bright and they have the same menu. The wait to be seated was about an hour, but the bar had space so we just sidled up. The bartender was very nice and knowledgable about the menu, but as the evening went on and it got busier she doubled as a waitress at the tables behind the bar so that divided her attention and the time it took to get our check. The food was excellent and I particularly enjoyed the pizza with the figs. They had some great simple farm to table items for entree and appetizer that were also good. For some reason they had a $100 white truffle pizza special that just sounded ridiculous to order, but I guess someone must do it to impress a date or client.

4.0,1/1/2013,"I had wanted to come here ever since I read about the salted caramel sundae. That was my basis for *needing* to come.First of all, I loved the interior. Clean, modern yet classic, well lit. I miss places like ABC.I started off with a blood red orange bellini. It was great - not too pulpy, not too acidic and not too sweet. A little pricey for what it is, but what do you expect.To start the meal, I had a kabocha toast, which was good. The kabocha was just sweet enough, and it was on crispy bread. I tasted my boyfriends raw scallops which didn't do a whole lot for me. For lunch, I had the pizza with mushrooms and cracked egg. Wonderful! The crust was perfectly crispy and the pizza was loaded up with mushrooms and egg. It was split into quarters and I could not finish it. I'm glad I went with this option at the recommendation of our server.To finish, of course, the salted caramel sundae. The salted caramel ice cream was great - not too rich, with the perfect amount of salt. I could have eaten that alone and been content. The sundae came with chocolate sauce and Cracker Jack-like popcorn. It was almost too rich all together - the ice cream, chocolate and popcorn - but that didn't stop me from finishing it. If you are getting the sundae, split it with someone - it is rich enough to easily satisfy two sweet cravings at the end of the meal.",0,1,0,Tai M.,"Honolulu, HI",81,241,2

Even though it was split, it still was more than enough food on the plate.

Lentil soup was oily but upside down cranberry cake was pretty good.

The decor of the restaurant is great and well thought out. The lighting is dim and the furniture, plates and cutlery have great personal touches.As for the food, we had two entrees. First, was the ricotta ravioli which was very good. Only complaint with the ravioli was the use of too much pepper. Overlooking the over use of pepper, the ravioli was still great with an excellent sauce. The last entree was the baked lobster which was also very good. Again, slightly too much seasoning but still very good. As for side dishes, mashed potatoes are excellent and recommended. The mushrooms are good but may want to skip them if not into mushrooms.

We had reservations and it took them a bit to seat us (like 20 mins), which I found strange in a restaurant such as this, especially on a Wednesday at 2PM. Anyhoo, barring that and our ditzy server, the food itself was amazing. I ordered from the prix fixe lunch menu and had the Tuna Sashimi, the Crispy Skate Salad and the Cranberry Upside Down cake. Drinks were a bottle of  sauvignon blanc and an amaro for a digestif with the dessert. The Tuna Sashimi was amazing. Super, super fresh with the citrus dressing that was a perfect compliment. I don't usually like fried salad but the crispy skate coating was so light and was great with the mesclun mix and vinagrette dressing.The dessert was OK, nothing memorable - I heard from my coworkers that the sundae was awesome. I sampled some of my dining partners' plates and I can also cosign on the chicken liver pate, the cheeseburger with jalapeno and the pretzel dusted calamari.The decor was really airy and dreamy - it's such a beautiful setting for which to have lunch or dinner.

I have never eaten beets until now (I probably have, but have just not realized they were beets), and I swear by this beet salad of ABC Kitchen's -- I went on the internet and found Dan Kluger's recipe, and now whenever I see nice beets at the farmer's market, I have to get them. If you do try that recipe, I recommend halving the amount of salt it asks for when roasting the beets. And you can sub chervil with parsley or chives.A la carte, we got the talked-about pretzel dusted calamari with marinara and mustard aioli. Though it might as well just be called calamari fried in salted flour, it was superb. We also ordered the whole wheat mushroom pizza with parmesan, oregano and farm egg, and this is the reason I trust Yelpers to tell me what's good. It's goood. I'll have to come back for those doughnuts everyone is raving about.To me, ABC Kitchen is like a more casual, more affordable, more day-friendly version of Blue Hill.",1,0,0,Eva G.,"New York, NY",142,688,475

4.0,12/13/2012,"If I ever had the pleasure of opening a restaurant, I would want it to look exactly like ABC Kitchen.  Tall wooden beams and white brick walls make it very country chic.  I would also want a restaurant that has the same standards, commitments, and beliefs as ABC Kitchen too.  I appreciate that sustainability is a top priority for them and that they favor consciously sourced materials ranging from the produce they buy to the dinnerware they serve the food on.Our party of 6 sat at a long table towards the back, right in front of a large table with the most attractive spread of flowers, pumpkins, and tin buckets of other vegetables.  We could also sneak a peak at the kitchen right behind this cornucopia of veggies.  For food, get the chicken liver toast.  Our party liked it so much we ordered a second after we finished the first.  Pretzel crusted calamari was pretty good too.  The birthday girl of the group ordered the chicken dish and at first, I raised an eyebrow because chicken is usually the last thing I'd order.  But, I regret that I did not order the same as it was some pretty darn good, super moist chicken.  I liked it better than the arctic char I ordered, which had a salsa verde with cauliflower that seemed a bit too acidic for me.  Another disappointment of the night would be the peanut butter & jelly cake.  I expected a deliciously fluffy cake oozing with warm peanut butter and jelly.  Instead, the cake was pretty dry and included thin layers of room temp pb & j.  Nothing spectacular at all.  What was really spectacular was their homemade concord grape sorbet.

4.0,12/9/2012,"Came here for dinner Tuesday night with 3 friends and it was packed, for good reason too! The restaurant was beautiful, with these rustic-chic feel and all of the wait staff was dressed in flannel (I am so envious and wish I could wear flannel to work). We had a reservation for 8 and got to the restaurant around 7:50, but had to wait until about 8:20 before being seated. By then, we were all hungry and ready for food. Luckily for us, they quickly brought up the Roasted Kabocha Squash Toast, Fresh Ricotta and Apple Cider Vinegar, compliments of the kitchen. It was delicious and definitely my favorite dish of the night (not including dessert, which was also amazing and so hard to compare)! It was savory, but with some tanginess to it and just so incredible.With that to tide us over, we started to peruse the menu. The menu was artsy and also listed all of the farms where they get their food from on the back. Our waitress disappeared for a while, which was fine since we were indecisive about what we wanted to eat, but then she finally came back and took our orders.We started with drinks and shared several appetizers. I got the Vermont Gold Vodka Thyme Lemonade, which was dangerously delicious. It tasted like sweet lemonade with just a little bit of vodka, but was one of the strongest drinks I had ever had (yes, I have low tolerance, but feeling inebriated after half of a drink is pretty ridiculous, even by my standards). We then shared the Cured Meats and Cheeses; Crispy Delicata Squash, Maple Syrup and Grated Goat Cheese; and Roasted Beets with Housemade Yogurt. The beets with yogurt were pretty good. I never would've thought to put the two together but somehow it worked. It's a pretty simple dish, but really brings out the fresh flavor of the beets. ABC Kitchen really knows what it's doing with its squash. I'm personally not a big fan of fried food so I didn't love the crispy squash, but it was it still well-cooked and had a great squash flavor. The meats and cheeses were fine, but given how good the other appetizers are and how you can probably find better at cheese restaurants, I'd pass on this one and opt for more squash.Then came the entrees. I had the Seabass with Chilies and Herbs, Baby Market Potatoes and Spinach. Unfortunately, the seabass failed to impress. It had a nice texture and the spinach was good, but there was all around too much oil and lemon flavoring. My friend's Kasha and Bowtie Pasta with Veal Meatballs however, was delicious. All in all, we agreed that the market table appetizers outshined the entrees.After stuffing our stomachs with food and drink, our waitress asks us that ever so tempting question, ""Do you want to see the dessert menu?"" I shook my head no, but two of my dessert-loving friends eagerly cried out yes. Realizing how full we all were, we opted to share the Sundae. Good thing we didn't order more since we were also served chocolate Cake Pops, compliments of the kitchen again. The cake pops were a rich chocolate flavor and tasted great with the Sundae, which was amazing. Sea salt caramel ice cream with pop corn and drizzles of chocolate sauce, yum (there is whipped cream on it too, but I avoided that part). I was so full and my stomach was crying out to me to stop, but this dessert was so amazing and irresistible that I found myself eating a few spoonfuls of it until I decided that my dress had gotten too tight and I would literally explode if I had a bite more.ABC Kitchen lived up to its hype and as long as you're willing to endure some long waits in there, definitely check it out sometime. And if you do, I'd suggest just getting tons of market table/appetizers and dessert, and a drink or two of course.",2,1,2,Joanna C.,"Cambridge, MA",191,648,1109

As for the pizzas, given that some of Manhattan's best pizzas are within a mile of ABC Kitchen, it seems kind of pointless to order pizza from ABC Kitchen.For dessert, the sundae is terrific.  Also terrific are the various sorbets and ice creams.  It's actually great, because you can order up to 3 different flavors of the sorbets and ice creams, most of which are terrific.",1,0,1,Yen H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,0

While they were back there they ran into the head chef who told them he would send something good over to our table. Two waiters brought over one of each dessert on the menu (a total of 7 desserts) and told us it was compliments of the chef....but when the bill came, one of the same waiters said they had to charge us for 3 of them.

First of all, the place is adorable: perfectly lit, modern-ish nature chic decor with the right touches, set up wonderfully with a fairly spacious bar space in front with lots of lean-to and drink rest spots. Given the impossibility of getting a decent reservation, we went around 8pm on a Thursday with  fingers crossed. After an hour of lovely drinks with even lovlier service from a dedicated drink waitress, we were seated at a high top in the front of the restaurant. The food that followed was seasonally perfect, fairly simple but flawlessly prepared. A crispy squash with maple glaze was decadent yet light in texture, and the crab toast was incredible as promised. Our mains - a roasted chicken and an arctic char - were slightly less exciting, leaving me to wonder even more about all the other excellent sounding small plates that we passed on.

3.0,11/17/2012,"Note: 3.5 STARS (let us add half stars, Yelp!)I had no idea about the hype and fanfare that rotates around ABC Kitchen before my girlfriend told me we were going with Eric R. and Sandrine E. Apparently reservations are hard to come by.  I really hadn't even heard of it before I read somewhere that Barack Obama had dinner there during his 2012 campaign.  So I had no expectations going in.  I was just excited to go someplace new.  And their hook is all the food is local / organic? It's good to eat a nice guilt-free dinner that's prepared healthy.The restaurant is very spacious.  And bravo to whoever was in charge of the decor.  It has this modern urban rustic thing going on.  After grabbing a beer up front while waiting to be seated, the hostess offered to hold my beer on a serving tray and walk it over to the table with us.  That was a nice touch.  I liked the in-house music too.  They were playing stuff like Amerie, Phoenix, Jay-Z, Timbaland & Missy...a smart blend of hip tunes.  It added to the social energy of the restaurant.Now in general, as a whole, the food was good. Was I losing my mind over it and calling random people on the phone to let them know that my life was changing?  Definitely not.  I had the pretzel-dusted calamari for starters (really tasty), lobster with a side of mashed potatoes for my entree (just okay) and the apple pie w/ cinnamon ice cream for dessert (extremely good).  I washed all of this down with a couple bottles of Southampton Double White.  Their beer selection is on point.In respect to the lobster, I've had much better elsewhere.  It was a little firm but it did have some flavor.  I definitely finished it all.  The best dish on the table was ordered by Eric R. - roast suckling pig with smoked bacon marmalade and grilled baby leeks.  Glad I got to taste that.  So I guess it depends on what you order.  Some meals are stronger than others.However, the service was top notch.  There were a couple of small hiccups with some items we ordered.  But we weren't going to complain or anything.  We were enjoying the ambiance.  It was a Wednesday night and slightly busy.  Everyone's sides came like 10 minutes after the entrees did.  The staff did recognize that immediately and comped all the sides without hesitation.  We didn't expect that whatsoever.  That was pretty cool of them.I would definitely try ABC Kitchen again.  Because the menu is pretty extensive and there's more I'd like to sample.  I know the potential is there for me to go back and have an amazing meal.

That was a bit confusing honestly so try to get a table inside the main room.  Service was excellent.  They always made sure our waters were refilled, including our mimosas if needed.  Venue itself is absolutely ADORABLE.  A bit too girly for the gentlemen though but hey, you are there for the food!  I felt like I was at a tea party the whole entire time.  Their chandelier floral decor, wooden floors and ceilings, and floral dining sets were so pretty I wanted to keep it for myself :P Ordered:1. Peekytoe crab toast- their most popular toast ordered here!2. Chicken Liver with maple syrup toast- definitely fatty.  If you are watching out for your cholesterol, then I wouldn't recommend you digging into this heavenly toast.  3. Roasted carrots and avocado citrus salad4. Whole wheat mushroom, parmesan, and farm egg pizza- I had a small slice of it and it was actually pretty good.  Only reason why is because i am not the biggest mushroom fan quite yet right now..... but i love anything topped with an egg!!5. Blacked seabass with chilies & spinach- Jean George masters his fish dishes so well with his sauces.  Every fish dish that I have had so far whether it was here or at his main restaurant, the sauces were always full of flavor with a spicy kick to it towards the end... I love his sauces. 6. Ice cream scoops for $6: buttermilk lemon, malted chocolate, & salted caramel.. A great deal for $6! We originally thought that each flavor was going to be $6 but no it comes in 3!  My favorite was the buttermilk lemon since I love fruity desserts!  Nice way to clean your palette after a delicious meal.Definite Try!!!!",8,0,2,Kathy D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2136,1124,541

4.0,10/16/2012,"Jean-Georges can do no wrong. Living in Atlanta now, ABC Kitchen reminds me so much of all the great restaurants I love in Atlanta. In starts with the decor: it's modern and trendy, yet earthy and rustic. It's both simple and sophisticated. The menu is true Jean-Georges yet is clipped onto a piece of cardboard. Amazingly, the pace and energy of Jean-Geoges at Trump Tower has been transplanted here, but in a more relaxed atmosphere. It's fantastic. On two occasions, I've been able to sample a few of the dishes and none disappoint. Several of the appetizers are light, playful, and extremely delicious: ramp and goat cheese toast, roasted portabello and celery leaves, pretzel dusted calamari with marinara and mustard aioli, and especially, the line-caught tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint.  At lunchtime, the grilled chicken salad with corn and greens was a summery fare, that hit all the right chords and was rejuvenating. At dinner, the organic crispy chicken with potato and escarole is an absolute treat and makes you realize how every other chicken breast you've had in your life prior to this dish is completely inferior. The roasted suckling pig with bacon marmalade and braised turnips just melts, melts away, and the fat content ... Fat rocks. The quality certainly doesn't drop off for dessert.

I also digged the waiters in their cute plaid shirt attire...very country and wholesome =). Is it just me? I don't know, I'm starting to think my taste buds are getting desensitized from eating too much good food in NYC for the past couple of years! I guess you will just have to come and be the judge yourself. Our group of 4 ordered 2 appetizers to share: the fried squash blossoms and the crab toast. Crab toast was awesome and very tasty but fried squash blossoms were just alright. They had barely any substance (I guess that's to be expected given that they're just flowers...) and were more breading than anything. Would have liked slightly larger portions, the amount they gave us was pretty tiny. My entree was the black sea bass, which was a bit disappointing. It basically came sitting in a soup, which I was not expecting. Wasn't loving the flavor either, but I was hungry so I still ate it all up. Definitely felt let down by that one and I DON'T recommend this dish. Dessert was the best part for me, we ordered the strawberry honey shortcake (comes with the most mouthwatering sorbet) and donuts. I couldn't get enough! yummmm...so I ended the meal on a happy note.

YES! YESSSSSS! this surpassed my expectations. i hadn't even seen or heard of anyone else praising this dish. it was great. the potato pancake was like a giant crispy molded hashbrown with smoked salmon layered over it with tons of dill (so you should probably like dill if you order this) and a dab of cream cheese on top. so, so good. for him:-french toast with peaches - this was really intense and heavy. it was delicious but i'm not a huge fan of sweets for breakfast. i had one bite and decided that i wouldn't order this personally for breakfast, even though it was great. the peaches were very fresh and delicious. it seemed like the thickly sliced artisinal bread was soaked in batter then flash fried, basically leaving the outside golden brown and the inside like a warm, delicious, melty custard...if you like french toast for breakfast, this is probably the ultimate experience.what i would probably try next time-sad to sad, but probably the overpriced donuts. they just looked so good-beet + yogurt salad-basically anything else....i'm because i'm definitely coming back!",1,0,0,M L.,"New York, NY",7,83,8

4.0,9/16/2012,"A survey of Jean Georges Vongerichten restaurants which includes Mercer Kitchen, Perry St., Spice Market, and ABC Kitchen, questions the good character of an establishment that solely relies on the name of a celebrity chef alone to propel reviews and draw the crowds.While the latter two of the list fare more successful in their attempts to bring trend and good taste to the table, more than the ethnically exotic Spice Market, ABC Kitchen is worthy of the visit. Centered around the romance of climate, the menu is in harmonious dialogue with the fruits and vegetables of the season. Consequently, the fripperies which constitute the ABC brand and aesthetic, a devotion to irregular shapes, white ceramics, and distressed woods, turn to enhance as opposed to deter.For a non-alcoholic beverage with plenty of enthusiasm, opt for the Basil-lime soda. As for a starter, the Crab Toast is certainly worth the fondness garnered. Lighter than expected, a lemon aioli brings life to crab, usually lumped with creamier condiments.Given the establishment's repertoire as farm to table, true assessment came to light as dishes with vegetable focal points were ordered. Seared okra and Serrano peppers were a delight to consume. Pasta with squash blossoms, shaved zucchini, and a pistachio pesto made for a recipe of vegetarian decadence. Noteworthy was the special pizza of the day, dressed with homemade fontina and ricotta, squash blossoms, and heirloom tomatoes.

3.0,9/10/2012,"I walked into ABC Kitchen with high hopes after hearing such praise and regard for this organic/local farm-to-table spot. My immediate excitement upon entering ABC Kitchen quickly turned sour. I had a 10 PM reservation this past Friday evening. My friends and I had gotten there a bit early at 9:40 PM. Initially, I thought my reservation was for 9:45. When I checked in with one of the hostesses (she had straight blonde hair and wore a blue patterned dress with some orange color blocks), she sassily said ""Oh. Well you're mistaken because *we* don't do quarter-hour reservations at ABC Kitchen. We do it on the half-hour."" At first, I wanted to say something just as snarky in return, but was such in a good mood that I wasn't going to let a bitter hostess with a 'tude ruin my Friday night. She then said, ""The reservation will be closer to 10 even though you're early."" Then she just stood there and stared at me. I was waiting for her to proceed with the typical response of, ""While we prepare your table, you're welcome to have a drink at the bar and we'll call you when your table is ready."" Nope. She just stood there like a deer in headlights. So I said, ""Okay. (awkward silence) Well... (more awkward silence), I guess we'll wait at the bar then."" Her: ""Okay."" After trying to find a place to squeeze in at the busy bar (apparently they can't hold the reservation time for a lot patrons here), I thought we should just go outside and wait because it was too chaotic. I told her, ""We'll be outside and come back in a few minutes."" Her: (still passive aggressive and mentally checked-out) ""Okay."" Apparently, she doesn't have other words in her vocabulary except for ""Okay"" which is a little too casual and parochial for an establishment like this.It's approaching 10 PM, I walk back in and check with the other seating hostess (brunette with curly hair and glasses). She was a little warmer and said ""Oh yes. You're checked in. It'll just be a few more minutes."" Waiting... waiting... waiting... It's now 10:20 PM. I check in again with the blonde hostess with the attitude. ""Hello. I just wanted to check in with the table. It's a bit after our 10 PM reservation."" Her response was something like a ""Devil Wears Prada""/""Mean Girl"" snide comment, ""Oh I know. Uh-huh. Your table is being prepared, okay?"" She also said it with a facial expression similarly made when someone sucks on a lemon. My friends sitting on the stools near the bar could even tell from afar she was being rude. We finally get seated around 10:30. Absurd. Now... The food and everything else... Our server was friendly. He explained the menu, wonderfully paced with check-ins/drink refills, and did pretty much everything a good server is supposed to do. Appetizers: raw scallops (A-), calamari salad (A), fluke (A-), sashimi (A), okra (B+). I ordered the arctic char. The sauce was delish. My friend ordered the lobster and found it quite lovely except he wished it came with something else to eat it with. He ordered a side of fries with rosemary and parsley. I mean, protein is great and all, but some of us need carbs too! Another friend ordered the BBQ chicken. It was actually a surprisingly large portion. The combination of the plate size and the chicken size seemed off... issues with scale and presentation?... The cocktails were fine, but I found nothing mind-blowing. The ambiance: it's very lovely with lots of natural wood surrounding you. Tables and linens are white. Lots of small candles lit throughout. The food alone was 4 stars, but for me, that initial customer service left such a bad taste in my mouth, I'm subtracting a full star for this review (since not only were we early, but we were still seated very late from our reservation time...  and... the blonde hostess was far from gracious and almost felt like she was encouraging a word war with me... and all the hostesses looked like they lacked clear communication with each other in terms of seating guests). My recommendation: The food is delicious and in many ways innovative, but I'd skip this place on your list if you cannot stomach snooty and self-righteous restaurant staff.",3,0,0,James Z.,"San Francisco, CA",504,334,4494
5.0,9/8/2012,"I've wanted to try ABC Kitchen but just had not yet made my way there. Until last night..in search for a tasty meal we were near union square and decided to stop in..beautiful restaurant with great ambience and bar scene..the wait was 45 minutes.. I was too hungry for that.But, seats were open at the back bar..so if you don't feel like waiting check to see if there's availability there, they have full dinner service..so voila..suddenly no wait.Excellent wait staff with complete knowledge of the menu, specials etc. the menu is well appointed with options to fit anyone who accompanies you..and with the going trend..it's focused on seasonal, farm to table ingredients so the menu changes frequently..if you see something interesting try it today because it will likely be gone within a few short weeks.Opted for the kale with lemon salad and pretzel crusted calamari to start..an excellent a choice i might add. Both were incredibly flavorful and light.  I had the special pizza of the day while the hubby had the organic roasted chicken with bbq sauce and fresh corn...so GOOD!Now you might wonder why I chose a pizza..of all things??  Each pizza on the menu sounds amazing, each made with fresh wheat crusts and lovely assortments of cheeses and fresh veggies..but the server highly recommended the special with fresh squash blossoms and an assortment of cherry tomatoes on housemade ricotta and fontina..ok, so I had my natural lactaid pills with me so why not?One word..awesome! The pizza was amazing, fresh, and each flavor complimented the other..and the wheat crust is by far the best wheat pizza crust I have yet to have.Too full for dessert so unfortunately we had to pass..but ABC Kitchen is not only aesthetically simple, beautiful and warm, it has terrific, fresh, seasonally inspired food that, from what I can tell, definitely will not disappoint.Book a resy with friends or just grab your partner and take a seat at the bar..ok..i mean right now...",4,1,2,Kim L.,"Ridgewood, NJ",139,352,52
5.0,9/5/2012,"ABC Kitchen was fantastic.  Wasn't able to get a dinner reservation for two on the day of, but thought I'd give them a call anyway.  They said they take walk-ins and also serve the full menu at the bar so we were happy with that.We had the carrot/avocado salad and chicken/pork sausage for appetizers.  Both were so flavorful and delicious!  The salad was a bit on the spicy side for me but still good.For the entrees, we had the hamburger (the aioli sauce was remarkable, in my opinion) and the roast suckling pig... which was AMAZING.  Just the right size and super flavorful.  A beautiful dish!There weren't many appealing gluten free dessert options so we got that someplace else, but we were very happy with our experience at ABC Kitchen.  We ate at the bar so it took a bit of perseverance to get the attention of the bartenders, but we were fine doing that since we didn't have a reservation anyway.  Would definitely return on our next trip.",1,0,0,Ava C.,"San Francisco, CA",1,58,0

3.0,9/4/2012,"Like Marie-Antoinette pretending to be a shepherdess, ABC Kitchen is just not convincing. I was disappointed with the unexciting food. But I was also dismayed by the faux-simplicity (the plaid shirts on the servers, the fetishistic vendor list on the back of the menu) paired with sky-high prices. Worst of all, nothing I tasted made a real impression, except that everything seemed over-spiced, unbalanced, and irrationally expensive. My husband's beet and homemade yogurt app was creamy and mellow, while I felt the evening's special salad was overpowered by the kick of the pistachio-topped dressing.His beautifully cooked, but stingily portioned, arctic char was undercut by the mustard-heavy greens underneath. I preferred it to my own chicken, though, whose aggressive BBQ sauce dominated. When I peeled (yes, peeled) back the sauce layer, the chicken, while moist, had little flavor. The corn melange underneath was tasty, though. His sundae was gigantic, and the popcorn was a fun addition. My strawberry shortcake was more like a plain little round, not especially interesting but surrounded by punchy lemon and strawberry sorbets.The servers are warm, professional, and well trained. But they're forced into all manner of gimmickry. We were solemnly informed: ""The bread is from Sullivan Street Bakery."" Am I supposed to be impressed? I buy bread there myself. And please, let's stop having the wait staff ask, ""Are you done enjoying that?"" before removing plates. As it happens, I was not enjoying several of them. Thanks for reminding me.Service did not flow smoothly. Apps and mains arrived almost too quickly, with long lags elsewhere.

Sea bass was fresh, but a bit salty, was actually somewhere disappointed about the taste. Specially 3 cheese pizza with fresh veggies was good, but again, I was expecting more.Bottom line - if you are a veggie lover or into organic produce, this is the place for you.

5.0,8/29/2012,"ABC stands for Absolute Best Cuisine! This is by far my favorite restaurant in NYC so far. The dishes are inventive, delicious and beautifully presented. It's impossible to walk in and get a table but you can reserve a table or sneak to the back bar which is first come, first served, which is what we did. The restaurant is decorated white with lots of exposed wood and high-top tables. Very eclectic. Very cool. We also gorged ourselves....1) Roasted beets with homemade yogurt - I would NEVER order this normally but the waiter convinced us to try it and it was amazing. The sweetness of the beets with the slight tangyness of the yogurt made this almost like a dessert. It was light yet rich. SO GOOD.2) Roasted kobocha squash toast fresh ricotta apple cider vinegar - My other favorite of the night. The sweetness of the squash, ricotta and vinegar paired perfectly with the saltiness of the toast. Perfectly cooked - not soggy at all.3) The special was a baked burrata with black truffle that was good but not worth the $40 price tag. I've had better but it was still very good.4) Roast carrot and avocado salad crunchy seeds sour cream citrus - This dish was also very good although a little spicy for my palate. The fire of the spiced carrot was lightened by the softness of the avocado.5) Roast suckling pig, plum and smoked bacon marmalade and braised turnips - I'm sure just reading that description gives you a pretty good idea of how good this was. I was so full and still couldn't stop eating this. Crispy on the outside; melty on the inside.6) Sundae with salted caramel ice cream candied popcorn chocolate sauce (didn't get whipped cream and candied peanuts) - I really liked the ice cream but this might have been just a touch too much sweetness, but that could also be because I was bursting at the seams at this point.",3,1,1,Laura H.,"Sydney, Australia",412,394,3

4.0,8/28/2012,"A couple of years ago I decided that I would rather go out to a nice dinner than receive a birthday present.  This both saves my fiance from stressing out over my gift and allows me to try places that I wouldn't otherwise go to.  This year, my pick was ABC Kitchen.The restaurant is gorgeous.  I had seen pictures of it online, but was surprised to see that the space was much bigger than I had imagined.  This did lend itself to a loud dining experience, but it wasn't overwhelming.  I tried to choose the most seasonal items on the menu, starting with my watermelon cocktail.  It was light and refreshing.  We started with the tomato toast.  The tomatoes were really awesome: just lightly salted and doused with a bit of olive oil.  They made me want to take full advantage of the tomatoes this year before it's too late.  I had the halibut which was slow-roasted and served with a summer squash puree and nasturtium vinaigrette.  It was the best bite of food that I have had this year.  The slow-roasting rendered the fish very tender, and the vinaigrette added the perfect amount of acidity.  I am withholding five stars, though, because of my fiance's dish: spaghetti with pistachio pesto and squash blossoms.  It was surprisingly bland; I would definitely skip this one on a return trip.  We shared the peach cobbler dessert.  The peach/crust ratio seemed a bit off to me because the peaches didn't really shine.  The blackberry creme fraiche ice cream was tangy and provided a nice contrast.  The service was awesome.  Our main server was very friendly and helpful.  She didn't miss a beat when there was some miscommunication about the beer my fiance ordered.  She was aided by a number of runners and bussers who were constantly circulating to refill waters and clear plates.This was a really great birthday choice.  I am still thinking about that halibut, and am going to take a stab at making it at home.",1,0,0,Erin H.,"Atlanta, GA",91,157,13

5.0,8/12/2012,"Last night I had one of the best meals of my life at ABC Kitchen. I live in Fairfield County and was going into the city by myself for a dance workshop. I had looked at ABC Kitchen as a possible destination for dinner when I was planning my day, but figured it would be really busy and wasn't sure if there was a decent bar area for a single diner to enjoy a meal. So while I was on my way to another restaurant, I unintentionally walked by. I am embarrassed to say that I hadn't realized that this restaurant had an emphasis on organic, farm-to-table food, something that is extremely important to me. So I decided then and there I was going to make this work for me. And I was not at all disappointed.I sat at the bar in the back of the restaurant, close to the ABC store. The service was perfect; they were attentive and I immediately trusted their recommendations because they were so knowledgeable and seemed to be so happy to work there. I sat next to their most frequent diner (she eats there at least 5 times a week) and her enthusiasm added to the experience. I started with the crab toast (I had read so much about it, I had to get it). The balance of flavors between the fresh crab and the delicious, crusty bread was perfect - neither flavor overtook my palate. And did I mention that the crab was FRESH? I think FRESH is the best word to use for this whole experience. I also had their salad special, a butter lettuce with pistachios and shaved radish. Who knew something so simple could be so delicious? To go with my meal, I ordered their house-made lemon-thyme soda. I don't drink alcohol, and I love a place that pays attention to the non-drinkers of this world. That drink was one of the most delicious beverages I've ever tasted. It was so effervescent and invigorating! Perfect after 3 hours of dancing!My entree was extraordinary. I had the slowly-baked halibut with summer squash puree. There are few words to describe how perfect this dish was prepared and how amazing it tasted. The freshness of everything on the plate, the harmony of flavors, I was speechless and here I am the next morning still thinking about it. I am already scheming about when I am going to be able to go back into the city to get this dish before it's off the menu for the season.Generally, I try not to return to restaurants in the city because life is short and there are so many incredible restaurants out there.

We waited about 15 minutes before we were seated - not terrible but not great either. Once seated, we didn't need more than a couple of minutes to decide what we wanted. It took them another ten minutes to notice that we were ready to order. I was starting to complain about the service to my wife but it got better from that point onwards. We got the crab toast, cavatelli pasta with shrimp, tomatoes & chili flakes, lobster and the suckling pig. There were some definite high notes. The crab was very fresh and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente even though the sauce was a bit on the salty side. I also appreciated the quality and the freshness of the tomatoes in the pasta. The lobster on the other hand simply failed to impress and though the suckling pig had a bit too much sweetness for my taste, the skin was crisped to absolute perfection.We had told our waiter that we wanted to share the dishes so they split up the pasta and the lobster in separate plates for us.

4.0,8/5/2012,"This restaurant is different from anything else I have tried in New York. From outside looks like nothing spectacular, in fact we walked by it several times as the building looks like it is under construction. When you walk in, the room is darkened & filled with different ambiguous sculptures, objects and fish tanks instead of walls to divide the two rooms. The food & drinks are also very particular, but everything was delicious. Be prepared for long dish names filled with words you have never heard, you will be scrambling to find a familiar dish only to settle for something that you have never heard of prior.

4.0,8/5/2012,"ABC Kitchen is a bistro housed inside an enormous furniture store.  It features farm fresh of rather imaginative quality.  The decor is interesting; given the lack of light in the restaurant, it always seems like you're dining at night.  That's fine though, because the lighting is super restrained and cool.  The service is impeccable, waiters are very well trained to answer question about the menu and their attentiveness is impressed.  Best of all is the food though.  I had the crab toast, the cheeseburger and my fellow diners had the veggie and scrambled eggs with fried oysters.  The beef in my burger was clearly of a high quality and grilled medium rare, the cheese was very finely grated and the bun perfectly toasted.  It was very tasty without being overpowering.  Definitely coming back.",2,2,3,William S.,"London, United Kingdom",56,81,0

4.0,8/3/2012,"I can see why this restaurant is packed at 6 pm on a Wednesday. My table split a bunch plates so that we could get a taste of everything. I've ranked the dishes from favorite to least favorite.1) Crab Toast - I can see why everyone raves about this. A must have!2) Lobster w/Lemon-Chili Vinaigrette - Best lobster I have ever had. Tons of flavor.3) Cavatelli w/Shrimp - Cooked with these amazing chili breadcrumbs. Complex flavor for a seemingly simple dish.4) Corn w/Manchego, Jalapeno, Lime - An amazing side dish. So fresh and unique.5) Peach Cobbler w/Blueberry Ice Cream - The perfect combination of sweet & tart. 6) Chicken & Pork Sausage - The sausage was out of this world. But, it was served on a bed of dressed parsley. It needed actual mixed greens.7) Baked Halibut w/Summer Squash - Pretty bland. Skip it.8) Rasberry Linzer Torte - Not what I expected. The torte tasted like gingerbread. Combined with ginger ice cream, I was on ginger overload.Overall, a great experience. We had the food above plus 6 cocktails/wine for a total of $250. Definitely not a place to go for an inxpensive meal.",2,1,1,Jenn C.,"Manhattan, NY",3,36,0
4.0,8/3/2012,"I love the decor of the restaurant-low lights, lots of candles with antique like seatings and settings and hardwood beams.  It's definitely a place you would take your clients or someone on a special date to impress them.  The food was superb-fresh as they use organic and local ingredients which they also have a roof garden I believe.   I wish I was able to have taken pictures but was with a client and coworkers.  I think we order everything on the menu. We started off with crab toast, roasted beets (best that I've had), tuna sashimi that melted in your mouth and calamari.  We order ricotta ravioli which was cooked just right and order three pizzas-spinach goat cheese, tomatoes mozzarella and mushroom parm.  This sounds like a lot of food already but we kept going.  For entrees, we got all the fish and lobster dishes-black sea bass, arctic char, halibut, wood oven lobster and they had a lobster special of the night.  I must say I found a new favorite fish when I had the arctic char...it was tender and almost like sashimi.  I highly recommend ordering it.  We ended the night with strawberry honey shortcake, doughnuts and chocolate cake.   With all the food I had, I left the restaurant not feeling any guilt as the portions were just right and everything was delicious and healthy.  I have absolutely no complaints.  The service was also great and they have good wine selections.  Trust me...you will not be disappointed!",1,0,0,Jin C.,"New York, NY",44,70,455

I am all for organic food blah blah blah but that's not what made this restaurant great, it's simply that the food tasted amazing. Ambiance was beautiful, felt like anthropologie opened up a restaurant. My recommendations: line caught tuna sashimi (marinated oh so incredibly), crab toast with lemon aoli (skip the calamari, it's your average fried fare), then try the kasha and bowtie pasta with veal meatballs, fennel sausage pizza, and finish off with black sea bass.

4.0,7/27/2012,"Very special experience! This restaurant embodies what I want New York to be like.It is lively, yet somehow muted (like a secret between old friends), rustic, yet elegant and just wildly creative!4.5 stars:- Carrot / Avocado / Sour Cream / Citrus Salad - delicious! They somehow made the most unclassy vegetable (the carrot) classy! (~$15)- Halibut with Squash Blossoms - Exquisite! Fish is superbly fresh - squash blossom flavoring (~$30)3-3.5 stars:- Crab Toast w/ Lemon Aioli - the crab itself was great - the whole bite together was on the greasier side (perhaps my expectations were too high for this one) (~$15)- Raw Fluke / Olives / Lemon / Chillies - packs a flavorful punch (one of my friends said it was ""invasive"" - the other said it was a celebration in her mouth - seems hit or miss - but definitely flavor-overflowing!) (~$15)- Kale / Lemon / Mint Salad - perhaps I'm just not a huge fan of Kale - but I felt like a rabbit (it's tasty - but it's grass) (~$15)- Spaghetti with Pistachio Pesto - couldn't really taste the pistachio, although it was good, I would consider this filler food (~$15)- Salted Caramel Ice Cream - simple, unique, flavorful end to the meal - nothing exceptional - but exactly what we were looking for ($6)... we took the pizza we ordered to go (much too full)!The above + 1 Bottle of Wine (Dry, fruity Riesling) + Tax = $200.Will definitely return!UPDATE (original review on 7.27.2012, update on 2.4.2013)My mother and I returned to ABC Kitchen for a very special evening! The carrot / avocado salad is still the winning dish. A close second was the Portobello Mushroom appetizer.After two visits to ABC Kitchen, I can confidently say - don't waste your time or money on Entrees or Desserts; get a ton of appetizers instead.I will definitely be returning!!

4.0,7/24/2012,"Oh ABC Kitchen, I had such high hopes for you. I wanted to give you 5 stars... but you'll have to settle for 4.  Four of us grabbed dinner here on a Saturday night a couple of weeks ago. I had been looking forward to this dinner for over a year and we'd finally made it here. The feel of the place is cool. It's in the ABC home store and the rustic decor has a beautiful, warm feel. The bar in the front has a vibrant feel, and the cocktails are great. As we made our way to the back I realized the restaurant is much larger than I assumed. We couldn't all agree on whether we wanted red or rose so settled on 2 bottles for the table (yes, dinner was off to a good start already). We decided to share a bunch of things from the menu as a table and told our server Christina this when she asked which items we would like to arrive first. The food as a whole was quite good, with the appetizers being the highlight for me. Everything on the menu is organic, fresh, and local. We started with the chicken liver toast, roasted beets in homemade yogurt, both of which were excellent. Then came the roast carrot and avocado salad, which I was a tad skeptical about but other yelpers had recommended it and were right in doing so. The raw fluke was also excellent, and had a bit of a kick to it which I really enjoyed.Then the problems started. The next dish, the spinach & goat cheese pizza (which is a warm dish mind you) came out to the table before we'd even begun digging into our salad or fluke. The conversation had begun to lull, not because we were getting boring but because the food was being shoved at us we needed to stuff our faces. I was worried I was going to need some Pepcid AC when finally my buddy said something to our waitress. It wasn't like they were trying to turn the table, there were empty tables right next to us. We sent back the mains and asked them to give us 15 minutes to enjoy the appetizers and pizza. 15 minutes went by, then 20, finally over 30 and still no entrees... hmmmm. Like I said this was a night when it was packed. Finally the manager, Anne Marie, came over to explain that she was sorry (she didn't really seem it) and the entrees would be out momentarily. She then began to explain that ABC Kitchen didn't take well to being told to run their kitchen, a comment that resulted in some more arguments from my friends as I sat back and watched this scene begin to unfold. Oh boy... here we go... Finally the mains arrived, though one friend chose not to partake after all the ruckus (maybe smart - I bet someone spit in our food for that one). The Sea Bass was nothing to write home about, and I would not recommend it. Anne Marie must have felt bad about the service issues and sent over a plate of french fries... which tasted like... french fries... nothing earth shattering there. The sucking pig was actually quite tasty and I'd recommend that as your entree, although like I said the appetizers were the best thing about the meal. We had the famous sundae for dessert and Anne Marie sent over a plate of cookies along with her card to help obtain reservations in the future... alright I guess she was working her way back to our good sides. All in all the price really wasn't bad for the amount of food, lovely decor and quality. I'll go back again and give them a second shot at the whole service thing.",14,8,9,Lissa V.,"New York, NY",565,242,4
5.0,7/23/2012,"This place is pricy, but well worth it.You may have to wait, but we were lucky enough to get in immediately. They did stick us in the back though (I think we didn't look hipstery/food snobby enough), near the ABC Kitchen store that is attached to the restaurant, which is pretty weird, but who cares about that. The food is amazing.Here's what we feasted on:- Bread and olive oilThis is some pretty tasty complimentary bread they give you to get you through the few minutes of perusing the menu until the order is in and the food comes.- Chicken liver toast:This is a really rich, delicious way to start the meal. The chicken liver is smooth and  very satisfying and the bread is really nice and crispy. An excellent combination.- Kasha and bowtie pasta with veal meatballs:This is one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. The veal meatballs are juicy, soft and extremely flavorful. Luckily we had some bread left, which was perfect for soaking up the amazing sauce from the pasta and the meatballs.- House roasted turkey sandwich with fries:This was a really awesome sandwich. The bread was nice and hot and crispy and the turkey and avocado were delicious. The fries were fancy McDonald's style and were delicious with the fancy ketchup they provided.- Sundae (salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts and popcorn, whipped cream, hot fudge):This was the perfect ending to an amazing meal. This is one of the few times I've seen a dessert done right with popcorn. I have tried several such desserts, and the popcorn usually ends up soggy or stale tasting, which was definitely not the case here. This dish gives you one of the most perfect bites possible: crunchy popcorn, some nice salty peanuts, smooth and creamy delicious ice cream, and the hot fudge to round it all out. I would come back here again just to get this dessert.I highly recommend coming here - you will not regret it, as long as you save room for that dessert.",15,5,10,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834

Head Chef Dan Kluger delivers  a satiable menu that is sure to please any palate.  I had to make reservations about a month in advance, but I knew upon entering the warm and rustic restaurant, it was well worth it.My friend and I were seated immediately.  We perused the menu and decided to split two appetizers.  We started with the Crab Toast.  Charred bread and fresh, chunky crab served with lemon aioli.  The crunch of the toast and the creaminess of the crab presented a light but satisfying appetizer.In addition to the Crab Toast, I wanted to try one of their many whole wheat pizzas.  I had trouble deciding which one to get.  The server recommended the Mushrooms, Parmesan, Oregano and Farm Egg Pizza.  I hate when server's say they like everything.  I am very appreciative when a server can recommend one or two particularly delicious dishes.  The egg served as a sauce-like topping on the already flavorful thin-crust pizza.For the entrée, I got the Red Snapper with chilies, herbs, baby market potatoes and spinach.  Lightly grilled fish with a kick.  It was served in a delicious broth, which was suitable to sip on its own.  The potatoes and spinach absorbed the savory broth, only enhancing its flavor.Finally, the crème de la crème.  The Caramel Sundae.  This is not an ordinary sundae, my friends.  This mouth-watering dessert is made of salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts & popcorn, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce.  I love the mix of salty and sweet so this was a perfect sundae in my eyes.ABC Kitchen is most definitely one of NYC's top new restaurants.",2,1,1,Michelle B.,"Huntington Station, NY",816,1320,3063

The liver was good, a little too homogeneous though - I like really tasting that grainy texture in liver.

We wanted something lighter and with a different flavor than our other dessert, but we should have just stuck with the sundae.

From basic tasks such as asking about how your food is to refilling your water, the staff does so in such discreet yet persistent manner.  Your conversation at the table never feels interrupted at any point.  In my latest visit, my water was refilled about eight times without fail.  Moreover, a casual mention (to my party) of my lack of ability to imbibe a drink was picked up by two separate waitresses. Each waitress came up to ask about my satisfaction level from the drink and then proceeded to take my drink away even though there was no formal complaint from me at all.  Beautifully done, especially when it was never requested.

Really loved the decor here... all the tables had jars of fresh flowers!Food: 5/5 for my French toast. On the menu it said ""with apples"" but they happened to be serving it with cherries that day instead, which was fine with me. The toast was definitely different from your typical, sometimes-too-sweet French toast. It came with powdered sugar on top and syrup on the side so you could adjust to your taste accordingly. The cherries, with their slight tartness, complemented it very well.Service: 3/5 A bit on the slow sidePrice: 4/5 Not too bad for brunch. I was a bit blown away by the prices of some of the drinks though - my friend paid $11 for what looked like a glass of blended green vegetables.Overall- Definitely recommend their brunch!",1,0,0,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",423,287,2844

4.0,6/20/2012,"Knocking off 1 star based on my last dining experience, mainly due to lackadaisical service. Our waitress could have been having an off day, but she really did the bare minimum necessary to fulfill her responsibilities. Took awhile to take our order and clear our plates, forgot to bring us bread and only checked in on us once. Disappointing that my second brunch here was tainted by such lack of service... but the other staff were pretty nice!Foodnalysis update:- Pretzel Dusted Calamari with Marinara and Mustard Aioli - Was not clear to me how the calamari were ""pretzel dusted"", however they were delicious! Each piece of calamari was perfectly friend and seasoned. Served with two, round dishes of sauce. We particularly liked the mustard aioli (essentially french garlic mayo). This appetizer was quite small, however, so budget your stomach accordingly.- Eggs Benedict - The eggs were perfectly poached and ham was delicious. This dish was also quite small though! Served with a side of crispy, sliced potatoes which were a bit too crispy for my liking... not to the point of being burned, but practically crispy all the way through.- Roasted Carrot and Avocado Salad - This lived up to its hype. Showed how fresh ingredients and the right combination of textures (crunchy seeds, lightly roasted carrots, avocado, sour cream) and flavors (citrus, veggies) showcase themselves beautifully. Again, not a particularly filling dish, but a lovely taste of freshness.",1,0,0,katie j.,"Irvine, CA",139,175,20

3.0,6/18/2012,"1. It's definitely overpriced. The food is simple, fresh, and quite good but doesn't merit the cost. Two people eating modestly, with dessert and no drinks was close to $80. Minus one. 2. The food was definitely tasty. We had the following: Ricotta + strawberry compote on grilled breadChicory salad with sherry vinaigrette, cherry tomatoes, and vivace cheeseCavatelli with peas, morels, ricotta, and fresh chilesRicotta + strawb toast was really tasty, somewhat reminiscent of a bagel with cream cheese and jam. In a good way. The pasta and salad were too salty. Not inedible but the chefs went a little overboard. And a shame! Because that pasta was really special, and... really, really salty. Dessert was doughnuts. Chocolate, lemon-thyme, and blood orange. The doughnuts were kind of bready; almost healthy tasting. The chocolate one kind of boringly so. Lemon thyme was glazed and much better, and the blood orange one was good but should have been called ""creamsicle"". Also worth noting that they were advertised as 'warm' doughnuts but were decidedly room temperature - and the creamsicle filling was in fact cold. Which helped with the creamsicle vibe but was not advertised. Anyway, minus another one for salty sloppiness. 3. It's really pretty inside. There was a two hour wait for a table on a Monday, but we sat at the bar in the back of the restaurant (first come first served)! You should do that if you go.

No two pieces of silverware are alike, the bread bowls are made by the something something tribe, and the food is all locally sourced and responsibly grown.

I suggest furiously clicking on open table at midnight exactly 31 days ahead. I tried to get a reservation here 4 times with plans made first, I eventually resorted to just booking 31 days ahead then finding some to go with later. There is also no wait list until the day of.

We were seated and then patiently waited for menus and water for 10 minutes while several people of the waitstaff stood by idly. Finally my mom had to actually get up to get a waiters attention who after a few minutes finally poured us water ($5 a pop we found out later instead of tap) This did not set a good tone for the meal. In term of food I liked the sausage app and mushroom pizza. Crab toast was disappointing and the calamari was pretty standard. Rhubarb tart and sundae desserts were quite good.

To be honest, my omelette was not good. I don't like omelettes where the ingredients are wrapped in the egg separately from the eggs, not cooked with the eggs themselves. In this case, the eggs were thick and seemed very separate from the fillings of ramps, asparagus, and goat cheese.My starters were delicious though. We split the crab toast with lemon aioli, the roasted carrot avocado salad, the doughnuts, and the bacon biscuits. Everything was delicious. I definitely recommend the crab toast and the roasted carrot salad.

The carrot tasted like sweet potatoes. Between the 2 pizzas the Asparagus Bacon was better.

4.0,5/30/2012,"ABC Kitchen is a solid restaurant - farm to table done right. I've dined at a few casual JG restaurants in the city by now, and I have to say that ABC Kitchen is without a doubt my favorite amongst them all. Decor: ""rustic elegance"" probably sums it up nicely. I love the burnished wooden tables, modern photographic prints in black & white on the walls, crystal chandeliers that decorate the ceiling, and small simple bouquets that totally complement the organicness of all the furniture. Restaurants with this classy yet casual type of vibe is truly wonderful, and fitting for all occasions. Service: while the waitstaff here is just as professional as any other JG restaurant (or similar $$$ restaurants in the city), I thought that service here was much more approachable and genuinely friendly. I really appreciated that our waitress knew exactly what ingredients were in different dishes and how they are prepared as she offered up some recommendations.Food: I think ABC Kitchen doesn't try too hard to show off impressive gastronomic techniques or overly luxurious ingredients. The food here is all about highlighting fresh local meats and produce, and everything is executed beautifully.- Roasted beets with housemade yogurt - this simple starter of roasted red and golden beets with tangy, creamy yogurt was actually my favorite. I was amazed at how well the yogurt, balsamic and a drizzle of fruity olive oil played off the sweet beets. This totally beats the conventional beets and goat cheese thing everyone else does, and I can't believe no one (including myself) had never thought of such a simple thing!- Chicken liver toast - while I'm not a big fan of chicken liver, this was probably the best liver dish I've ever tasted. It was creamy, unctuous with just the right amount of fatty sweetness. Do order these to share unless you're a liver fiend - because even half of one crostini was too rich for me.- Roasted carrot and avocado salad, crunchy seeds, sour cream and citrus - I ordered this based on our friendly waitress' suggestion, and boy was she on point! This salad packed so much depth and contrasting texture and flavors, and was actually quite a substantial portion for an appetizer. I couldn't get over how savory and spicy the cumin roasted carrots were, it's seriously amazing how great a plate of baby vegetables can taste when treated properly. - Kasha And Bowie pasta, veal meatballs - I can see why this is one of the most popular dishes here. The flavors are robust and strong, even one bite punches you in the face with caramelized onion and reduced red wine flavor from the sauce.- Mushrooms, Parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza - I am typically a fan of red sauce on pizza, but I really liked the mild creaminess of this white pizza. The runny egg yolk, wild mushrooms and melted parmesan worked together very well to create a decadent umami party in your mouth. The whole wheat crust is also surprisingly tender and chewy, although not the best crust in the city.- Ahi tuna burger (daily special) - this special of the day I tried off the bf's plate was very fresh and incredibly flavorful. I don't quite remember what kind of aioli or sauce was smeared on the bun, but it packed a lot of herb and zesty heat. The rosemary fries that came with it were flavorful enough, although a little blonde in color and perhaps under fried. I really think that ABC Kitchen and chef Dan Kluger deserve all the critical acclaim they have received.

Yumm is all I can say. The maple bacon biscuits were wonderful. Chock full of chunks of bacon pieces with a slight sweetness from the maple. I added some honey and butter just for good measure to throw it over the top!! The scrambled eggs with crispy oysters was one of the best egg dishes I have ever had. Some may think its an odd combination but if you love eggs and fried oysters, why not? This turned out to be truly amazing. It looks small but is incredibly misleading. It is a deep, shallow bowl filled with soft scrambled eggs and I am not kidding at least 8 whole perfectly fried, steaming hot oysters. It was all sitting in a pool of hot sauce infused butter to give it a nice spice kick. The eggs are very soft so be aware if you don't like that. I prefer mine a little more set, but I didn't mind it. Eggs were fresh and seasoned well, oysters were delicious, and the heat from the hot sauce buttaaaaaaaaa made everything pop.

5.0,5/23/2012,"In my mind, this is quintessential New York dining - from the food to the atmosphere, this place services the after-work crowd of New York's trendiest (and hungriest).  Upon walking in, you're greeted with smartly-dressed patrons who are gathering with friends for a drink at the bar and surrounded by a warm glow emitted by gorgeous chandeliers, simple white tables in the main dining area, and wonderfully kitschy, elevated wooden tables that resemble a slice of tree trunks toward the bar area.  I was concerned that it might be on the pretentious side but was immediately put at ease when a male bartender sprung to our attention with a warm smile.Since we had no reservations, we waited at the bar for about an hour for a table for 3.  We did enjoy ourselves at the bar and the bartender was friendly and surprisingly attentive for such a busy night.  They were also very accommodating - since I had no particular hankering for anything on their drink menu, I decided to make my own by asking the bartender to add vodka to their homemade Cherry Citrus soda - delightful.For our little party of three, we started with the cured meats and local cheeses plate then had the mushroom pizza, black sea bass and roasted suckling pig.  For dessert we had salted caramel sundae and the slice of birthday cake.  The service was good - water glasses and bread basket were never empty.The local cheese platter was delicious and was a great starter.  The sea bass was flaky, tender and mild and wasn't too heavy which made it great for balancing out the roasted suckling pig.  As the name implies, it was quite heavy but delicious and no knife required!   But the star of the show was definitely the mushroom pizza.  Unassuming and simple in appearance, but it was by far one of the highest quality and best-tasting pizzas I've had.  I don't say that lightly, but the crispiness of the crust, the rich, musky fragrance of the mushrooms all topped off with creamy egg yolk was the trifecta of a perfect pizza.  Of course, this is not your usual NY slice, but as far as gourmet pizzas go, this takes the cake.  Speaking of cake... the birthday cake was dense, moist, and nostalgic and the sundae was unique and decorated with caramel popcorn instead of the usual sundae fare which was just a perfect end to the meal.",0,0,0,Monica H.,"Manhattan, NY",30,93,0
4.0,5/22/2012,"This place definitely deserves five stars for the decor.  SO IMPRESSIVE!  A combination of cute, romantic, and rustic.  If I could design a house, I would want the kitchen and living room to have similar decor inspiration.  Love.More importantly, the food.  My bf and I decided to share a pizza and an omelet.  The pizza was very flavorful.  I believe it had spinach, goat cheese, and bacon.  The omelet was not quite as impressive.  Very standard omelet, with a little too much egg and not enough fillings.  The potatoes that came with the omelet however, were amazing.  They must've been deep fried, because they were so deliciously crunchy on the outside, and soft and creamy on the inside.  With plenty of salt.  I love salt.I did try some bites of my friends' dishes.  The crab toast was amazing!  I think I would just get that with a side salad next time... if I didn't want to worry about butter and carb intake (which I wouldn't worry about, the crab toast is worth it).  Also, the pizza with mushroom and egg on it was also amazing!  I love mushrooms, but this was not an ordinary mushroom pizza.  I think I preferred the crab toast and mushroom pizza to the two dishes my bf and I shared.The service was good.  They were attentive with refilling water and coffee, and they were perfectly friendly throughout our brunch.  I'd highly recommend this place for brunch!",0,0,0,Jenna C.,"Pasadena, CA",365,556,587
4.0,5/18/2012,"I went to ABC Kitchen last Monday with my parents and we had a GREAT meal! We are big fans of Jean George and also ate at the Mark restaurant the day before and have been to many of his other restaurants but ABC Kitchen will have to be my favorite. It is definitely a trendy restaurant and you will notice that right away - the crowd is young and hip (Simon Cowell, Britney, and Demi Lovato were there the same night as us!). I love the style and decoration of the restaurant - picture the trendiest most beautiful farm ever. For me, the restaurant lived up to the hype - food was VERY VERY good. I will list everything I tried- Blood Orange Bellini - SO GOOD! I love blood orange drinks and this did not disappoint- Marinated olives - really nice array of olives! - Cured Meats and local cheeses - these were really nice, all were super yummy! - Beets with housemade yogurt - LOVE!! my favorite beet dish I have ever tasted - def get these! - Organic Crispy Chicken - absolutely DIVINE!!!!- Swiss Chard - amazing, it was cooked in balsamic, such a great taste- We also had a pasta that was a special I think and it was spaghetti and veggies but I remember it had so much olive oil or butter or whatever in it - did not love I also forget which wines we ordered since my dad did the ordering but it was great! The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is the service. I understand the NYC mentality that everyone is in a rush and people are generally rude but I will never understand why some restaurants do not stress the importance of great service! We are in the restaurant business and that is why I know how important service is. Our waitress was not terrible but definitely not good hence the 4 stars.

I did not post at the time but feel that I shouldI raved about this place to visiting guests (having gone once before) and we went for a post theater dinner.I understand by 10 pm things are slowing down but if you are going to take reservations for that time and still serve food I believe you ought to be on top of your game regardless of the hour. this was not the case:-- multiple servers asking us the same questions then disappearing for a long period of time-- I ordered apparently the soggiest mushroom pizza I have ever seen...it was so greasy and soggy that parts of it ended up on my dress as it was served to me by one of our waiters...the rest oozed on the table.-- who allowed this dish to go out of the kitchen? it was an utter mess (dripping everywhere)... even if I made this for my home I would not serve it to guests and I am not professional cook-- when I told another waiter... he brings me one of these ""pre-wash pens"" after 10 minutes... hmmm my dress was silk and this was certainly not cut the grease (it did not)finally we leave...the host/manager at the time asks me about the experience.... I tell her I am not happy...she apologize profusely at which point I have hopes... she offers to pay for he dry cleaning of my dress (silk) and gives me her email address (she did not have cards)for over 3 months I email her about this and nothing happens. Over a year later:still not paid for my dry cleaner and even though she has my receipt I never saw a dime. It's really not about the money but the principle...

The interior is large, airy, and open filled with lots of natural light.  The decor has a farmhouse setting that is accented by white lacquered tables and chandeliers and black and white art pieces.  I started with the going and juice, a Gin based cocktail with goji berry juice which was a little tart but refreshing. It is not overpowering with the goji flavor though. The pancakes were perfectly cooked and were a thick cake-like style. What pulls it all together though is the Meyer lemon butter. It is out of this world. The eggs Benedict were exceptional too, the ham and eggs both being hand selected from local farms (as everything else with the menu).

I absolutely love pate, but I really didn't like the tangy vinegar in this dish.I also tried the famous mushroom and farm egg pizza, and it was terrible. The whites of the egg were still raw and runny, and the pizza soaked it all up and became incredibly soggy. The mushroom flavor was overwhelming, and it was just too difficult to eat this pizza.I actually only ate 1/4 of my meal and looked longingly at my friend's french toast (which is to die for).Next time, I'm sticking to the french toast, eggs benny or smoked salmon (my fav).

Dessert was good, but not the same caliber as the dinner.Cocktails were meh, but the sommelier was informed and wine choices were on target.The reason this doesn't get 5 stars is that the service needed work.

We ordered over 10 dishes off the menu for 4 of us-- we did not need to be instructed that the kasha did not come with red sauce. We were capable of reading the menu and figuring that out.

5.0,4/21/2012,"I had a wonderful experience here. I came here with my parents for my birthday and it was a truly extraordinary night. Upon walking into ABC Kitchen one is presented with a cozy upscale barn interior replete with cool lighting and mod white tables. Food: We each ordered an appetizer. I ordered the Chicken Liver Toast, which I highly recommend. What distinguishes good chicken liver from bad is taste. Bad chicken liver has a terrible bitter metallic taste to it. This one has a whipped mouse-like consistency, smooth and creamy. The flavor was slightly sweet, yet it had a bright acidity. The toast was thick with a crisp exterior and fluffy interior. The bottom of the toast was brushed with fruity olive oil. My father ordered the Housemade Ricotta with Grilled Bread. The ricotta was amazingly creamy and smooth. There was some tangy tomatoey sauce and olive oil drizzled around as well that nicely cut the richness of the cheese. The grilled bread was  fluffy and lightly charred. My mother ordered the Butter Salad, which was composed of fresh lettuce, pistachios, and other things as well. I tried some and all of the greens were fresh and crisp. For my main course I ordered the Oven Roasted Lobster. This dish consisted of a whole lobster split and seasoned with oregano and red pepper flakes. The lobster was sweet and tender. The seasoning kicked up the flavor without overpowering the natural taste of the lobster. My mother ordered the Crispy Chicken. The chicken was moist and flavorful, while the skin was perfectly crisp, for lack of a better word. My father ordered the Roast Suckling Pig, which was wonderful as well. The pork was juicy and flavorful, perfectly seasoned. The crispy skin was so crisp that it was hard to cut. Everyone enjoyed their meals.Then for dessert I was presented with mini chocolate cupcake topped with crunchy chocolate beads. The cupcake was super moist and deeply chocolatey. It was fantastic and I'm not even a big fan of chocolate cupcakes. The frosting was wonderful as well, not too sweet due to the slight bitterness of the chocolate. I also loved how thick the frosting was. The chocolate beads added a nice textural contrast as well. Then we also ordered the Salted Caramel Sundae with Caramel Corn. The ice cream was not so thick that it bloated you, but it was actually surprisingly light. The caramel corn gave the sundae a great textural component, as did the caramel peanuts, way better than Cracker Jack.

The suckling pig entree was ok. The bacon marmalade was tasty but hard to make anything with bacon bad !  The suckling pig was tender but not as tasty as pork should be (or maybe I dont like roast pork). The sundae desert is really good - nice combination of multiple flavors and a large enough helping to share among 2-3 people.Drinks : The basil lime non alcoholic soda was good.  The wine I had was not a good - somewhat spoilt..

2.0,4/19/2012,"My love-hate relationship with ABC Kitchen continues. We showed up at 5:30pm, with a totally empty main dining room in front of us. After a few minutes, the hostess informed us that we had to sit in the 'cafe' (i.e. the hallway) just outside ABC itself because of other reservations. She said she didn't want to make us feel bad, but a lot of people were due to arrive at any minute.If this was my first time at ABC Kitchen, I wouldn't even notice. And, truth be told, I don't even care where I sit. But these people at the door deal the same lie every single time and they never ever fill up. Even after being told they were getting the bum rush, they still had at least 12 tables free (yes, I'm an ass, I counted) in the main room when we left.Being treated like a second class customer when I pay a $150 check leaves me with a pretty bad taste in my mouth. Some douchy hostess wants to hold tables for phantom superstars who never materialize? Oh, Justin Beiber may show up? This shitty attitude really makes me not want to eat here.I've never ever been treated like this at any other Jean Georges establishment, so I am sure it's the manager that's responsible for letting this kind of behavior exist. To the manager: F U buddy! I hope you're fired for sanctioning this kind of unprofessional behavior.That unpleasantness aside. AMAZING food. The suckling pig with smoked bacon marmalade was absolute paradise.

4.0,4/9/2012,"I made ressies long in advance for a dinner at Jean Georges' acclaimed new resto - ABC Kitchen! The moment I stepped in I fell in love with the ambiance and atmosphere. The decor was definitely organic and at one with nature. I almost felt like it was a very upscale farm ;)We started off with the carrot & avocado salad and peeky toe crab toast, per Yelp reccos and were not disappointed! You could truly discern the fresh ingredients in the salad and the peeky toe crab was just divine. There was a generous amount of crab atop the crostini as well.For entrees, we went with the mushroom, parmesan, oregano, and farm egg pizza ($18) and the organic crispy chicken ($26). I thought the pizza was just mediocre and the crust became quite soggy as the night went on. My dining companion enjoyed his chicken - I had a bite and it was nice and succulent with perfect fried skin. We finished off our meal with the salted caramel sundae ($12), which was very good and justified for the price tag. I must say though, my favorite part of ABC Kitchen are their cute bathrooms!

Before I even arrived, my friend text me saying what an adorable place it was and once I got there  - ugh, fell in love. The ambiance is awesome, makes you feel like you're in a friend's kitchy house. I loved the people who crowded the restaurant as we sat enjoying our meal as well. Everyone seemed so...""New York"". My friend ordered a pizza while I splurged (on the company dime, of course!) on lobster. I liked the lobster but with I'd ordered something else. My friend did, however, really enjoy the pizza! We had too many glasses of wine to stop ourselves from ordering the sweet dessert (some amazing pear concoction) and scarfed it down like it was our last meal. The bill was well over $100 for the two of us, but to be expected for the food, service and general ambiance. I would return again in a heartbeat and recommend to friends.

The organic mixed juices are rich and pure -- beet with carrot and ginger sooo good and also loved the green one with every green veggie imaginable. The maple glazed biscuits were savory but not too heavy, and definitely delicious. Seasonal glazed donuts melted in my mouth. Eggs benny was a good classic, french toast is very popular here.

5.0,4/1/2012,Let's just get the most important things out of the way first - the food is excellent. The pizza that we started with were just divine. My regret when visiting here is that I was not that hungry. We continued with the ricotta ravioli and the veal meatballs with kasha and bow-tie pasta. The pasta was also made to perfection. The wine we paired with it also went excellent with the food. We went on with the organic chicken and roast suckling pig. Unfortunately we were so stuffed that we could not have any dessert will have to be next time. The service was always very quick and good but when we received the bill they forgot to add any of the wine to it - pointed it out and they did then apologize and said they would of course not charge us for it.

Yea didn't make much sense, but the server said it was cooked in duck fat so that was good enough for me. Oooo it was so soft and tender and flavorful.

Very rarely does hype match experience, and you get it sooo right!!!This restaurant is a serious must-try for any foodie- they're not kidding when they say their vegetables will convert any carnivore! I went with a group, which was awesome because we got to try each other's stuff. Being a devotee of the heat, I was so pleasantly surprised to learn chilies were one of the chef's favorite ingredients, and he certainly knows how to use them. The thinly sliced scallops with green chilies and pistachioes are a must-try. I had seasonal roasted beets with yogurt- so pleasant. My main didn't make me as happy- it was a pasta with veal meatballs in a sauce that was a little too sticky sweet for me, since I'm not a fan of caramelized onions. Happily, I switched with hubby and got his juicy burger with jalapenos :) They also have refreshing homemade sodas- I got the ginger lime and it was yummy! For dessert, we tried chocolate cake/donuts/ice-cream. The cake is *heavenly* and rich, and donuts were fun!Service was also super-friendly and down-to-earth. We had a bit of a scare initially after the hostess couldn't find our reservation which was made a cpl of months prior, but she reassured us she'd try her best to find us a table rather than acting snooty about it. Luckily, once our friends who made the reservation got there it was cleared up (it was under another friend's name, which hubby and self didn't know about).I also love the decor and ambience- they maintain a very green cleancut look, and are attentive to detail about their eco-friendliness.All-in-all, brilliant concept for a restaurant, flawlessly and unpretentiously executed!Did I mention I love you?",0,0,0,Annette N.,"Somerville, MA",0,39,0

The little details really make ABC Kitchen a very special place.The mismatching dishes, tiny vases of real flower buds and the delicate flavors and sights make it an experience, not just a meal.I will say that it is so girly, and dainty, so I don't know how great it'd go over with a group of dudes on any given Wednesday (as opposed to an occasion) but it is the perrrfect place for a girls date. The back room has a gorgeous chandelier, a view of the kitchen, I prefer it a lot to the larger main room.The food is also so delicately prepared, the lemon aioli crab toast is delicious and perfect - you will for sure want to pop your pinky. The herby pizza has a hearty amount of sea salt on it, but there is a great bitterness from the herbs that goes perfect with the chewy bread.Definitely don't be scared to experiment, their menu seems to be practiced and perfected. I think the coffee was a thumbs down, and took quite a while - though I was warned that the barista was very busy.Something I also appreciated a lot: while waiting for a table, you can SEE all the delicious looking food being served, but you cannot/will not smell it! How the ventilation is set up in this place, I am not sure - but it preserves the whole feel of the place. It would not be as perfectly packaged if garlic, pizza and other smells were bombarding your senses.Can't wait to go back, will definitely look into how to hold an event here, am already preparing to replicate little details for my home!",1,0,1,Audrey K.,"New York, NY",302,377,559

The lighting it dim and romantic, the cocktails are tasty and the food decadent. Ordered the ginger martini, the beat dish and sea bass. Split a bottle of a red wine and had the sundae for dessert. It was like heaven in my mouth. Both the beat dish and sea bass were so rich in flavor and not like anything i've ever had before. The sea bass was about 25 bucks and the beat dish was maybe 12.

3.0,3/11/2012,"As the clock strikes 5:30 and the doors leading from 18th Street open to the ABC Kitchen, a mass exodus of people flood the hostress' stand. Some have reservations, some don't. An inexperienced hostess could easily lose her cool, but this one doesn't. She directs people without reservations to either sit at the bar or stand wherever and wait for a table. People with reservations are promptly seated, with the option of having their coats checked.I dropped by ABC Kitchen last night. I've been wanting to come here for a while, ever since last fall, when my gf and I walked in without a reservation and discovered a 1.5 hour wait. We instead opted to eat at 10 Downing, which in retrospect wasn't the smartest move, but I had a craving for pork belly that night. Since that night, everyone has been telling us how we must try ABC Kitchen.Anyways, I digress. I had a 6pm reservation for two last night (Saturday). Reservations here aren't hard to get, you just have to book a month in advance. Unfortunately, my gf had to bail at the last minute and while I didn't give up the reservation, I also didn't want to sit there, eating all alone. Struggling to find a friend to join me, I finally opted to eat alone.Fighting the mad chaos at the hostess' stand, I explained that I had a 6pm reservation, but my +1 had to cancel, so could I be seated now (5:30) and just eat alone. No problem at all. I was seated and brought menus from a young and friendly server. Shortly after, a second server came a filled my water. A few minutes after that, my original server came back to take my drink order. I had the Blood Orange Bellini, which was very good. It had a strong blood orange flavor and was sweet and creamy, However, the serving was small, making it incredibly overpriced at $16.I also told the server my order at that point. To start, I had the Raw Diver Scallops with  Market Grapes and Lemon Verbena. Brought to my table by now a third server, this was not a bad dish at all. The scallops were presented on a giant shell and were definitely very fresh, but I'd hoped for more of a briny flavor in the scallops. The accompanying grapes and lemon verbena complement the dish nicely and don't overpower the scallops when all are eaten together.For my main course, I was curious about the burger, but really - how many burgers have I had up to this point? I wanted to try something new, something that I hadn't had in a long time, so I went with the Roast Suckling Pig, which came with a Plum and Smoked Bacon Marmalade and Braised Turnips. I had Roast Suckling Pig many years ago in Spain and can still taste it. I was hoping the dish here would recreate that experience, but perhaps that's hoping for too much. Then again, in a Jean-Georges restaurant in Union Square, hopefully it's not asking for too much. In any event, the pig was good, but not exceptional and thus somewhat disappointing. The pork was very tender and seemed to have been braised, coming apart quite easily. It also had a layer of crispy skin on one side which was quite good. As for plum and bacon marmalade, I couldn't identify the ingredient which wasn't bacon and I didn't get much of the plum flavors in there. It tasted more like a relish than a marmalade. The braised turnips, however, were quite good. Oh, btw... my entree was served by yet another server whom I hadn't yet been served by, bringing my current tally of unique servers up to four.Midway through my main course, one of my friends called me and said they were on their way. The staff had no problem with that and quickly set a place for him. As for my friend, he came from a business meeting where he'd already eaten, so he had nothing. The staff didn't give any bad attitudes or condescending looks over that, which was nice.It is worth noting about the bread that is served here. It's continuously refilled throughout your meal, as is your water. The bread is always served with olive oil, salt and baby radishes. The radishes were excellent and I'm usually not a huge fan of radishes.In the end, I skipped dessert and just got the check. I paid $77, including tax and tip, for my appetizer, entree and beverage. The food was fresh, the interior is unique and trendy and while the food is decent, I wasn't blown away. I felt the vegetables were the only things here that really screamed ""market to table."" I understand that I'm in the minority in not being ABC's biggest fan, but I just felt that I was paying more for the JG name in Union Square. Definite nods to the service tho. Very friendly, polite and professional, but too many servers handle one table.In the end, I just didn't feel that the $77 was a good value for what I had. Next time I want to spend $77 on a meal at a JG restaurant, I'll just go have the $78, 5-course tasting menu at Nougatine. As for ABC Kitchen, would I come back here? I may, since my gf has also been wanting to try it. I'll just order differently and more conservatively.",2,0,1,John-Paul P.,"Madison, NJ",68,149,839

The atmosphere was a perfect complement to the food.  Very rustic, woody and clean with lots of light.  I love that this place is Conscious in it's sustainable choices and local,organic food sources.

4.0,3/4/2012,"I knew this was a good choice when I later found out that President Obama hosted 900 guests here paying up to $35,000 a plate.I love the aesthetic of the place: old paint & weathered wood on the outside make you second-guess choosing this pricier restaurant, but you step in and it's a bright, clean space with the decor of a fancy farmhouse. They are clearly going for the organic, locally-sourced food theme. The only complaint I have is that you are seated rather close to your neighbors so you won't have that much privacy.The food was good, thought we enjoyed the apps more than the mains:Housemade Chicken And Pork Sausage: super tasty, and the starchy, potato-like accompaniment was a perfect pairingChicken Liver Toast: perfectly crunchy bread topped with a thin, rich liver spreadBlack Sea Bass: fish was well-cooked and sides were good, but could've used more seasoningBowtie pasta with veal meatballs: delectableI'd definitely go back, but not often as the food is pricey!",0,0,0,Sarah J.,"New York, NY",22,63,5
5.0,3/2/2012,Place is insanely awesome in every regard. The lighting and the natural decor really set the mood. The menu explaining the type of organic food and the distribution partners they use was really cool.For Starters we had some squash toast which was the perfect blend of multiple flavors and the black truffle burratta that was straight ridiculousness.Then we had an carrot/avocado salad and brussel sprout pizza which were both excellent. For Desert we had was salted caramel ice cream sundae which might be one of the better deserts I have ever had.  The service was awesome and the drinks were great.

3.0,3/1/2012,"First time visitor on Monday, Feb 27 for a business dinner.  Given the pedigree - JGV - and the fact that one of my favorite places for  business and/or pleasure is Jean-George at Columbus Circle, I am sad to say that I won't be returning to this establishment. Dining out and paying the kind of prices, it has to be a total experience.  Happy to report the food is up to his normal standards, but the 'experience' was less than favorable.  Poor service--uneven, rushed, and unknowledgeable on the simple requirement of knowing who ordered what WITHOUT asking or placing the incorrect item down in front of the wrong person...................the noise level is distracting.  Sitting across at a round table of 6, it was hard to hear anyone other than the individual on each of my side.  Also, seating a party of 6 at a table that is more suited for no more than 5 is unforgiveable.  When you have to constantly keep thinking how to rearrange the table to accommodate a drink or plate of food--again unforgiveable.  (Please note:  When show the table and asked if a larger one off to the side was available, the hostess said it was 'taken' - we arrived at 6:30 PM - by 9:15 the table was empty.  Only by 9:20pm was a party seated at that table - my part departed at 9:30 pm.  Is this a way to run an establishment??? ) Finally, our table wasn't balanced - uneven floor I believe -- and we had to ask on three separate occasions to have the table leveled.  When the basic fear of placing a glass down on your table overtakes concentrating on the common conversation for fear of not knowing what will happen---again non-acceptable in such an establishment. As I said above, sad that such good food, no excellent food, can't mask what was basically a bad experience.  Memorable for how NOT to choose a place when the simple requirements of service and surrounding are so totally forgotten or over looked.   Come on gang, get you act together!

5.0,2/25/2012,"When you're in NYC, it can be difficult to decide where to go for a clean and delicious meal. Well, unless you've tried Jean-George's ABC Kitchen. It's the perfect place to slow down and enjoy natural, local and organic food in a serene setting. From hand-crafted artisan dinnerware and natural fiber table settings to wooden beams and candle glow, this kitchen is bringing it back to the A-B-C's of basics. With artful design and exquisite farm-to-table food, it's no wonder the James Beard Foundation awarded it the honor of  Best New Restaurant of 2011.  Here is how the lovely meal began.You guessed it, crab toast. With dill and aioli on a thick slab of toast, this was rich and creamy. A few good squirts of lemon really livens it up and highlights the freshness of the crab which is sweet and vibrant in it's own right.. The sweet shrimp with horseradish and olive oil was sweet and spicy. Served raw, these baby shrimp taste wet and have a sticky coating and firmness to them. This is a unique dish that is definitely worth trying if you enjoy trying new and interesting textures.Pizza with proscuitto, dates and ricotta has a smokey flavor from the the small bits of proscuitto that enhanced the smooth creaminess of the cheese. The sweet dates and spicy greens brought an additional kick to the palette that made this thin crust, whole wheat pizza all the more delightful.The farrow salad with cranberries, sweet potatoes and blue cheese was thick and creamy as risotto. All that full-bodied flavor and richness, without the gluten. These incredibly healthy grains are hearty and satisfying, and the tang of blue cheese made this silky salad even more luscious.The grass-fed beef burger with pickled jalapenos was a triumphant choice, as most good burgers usually are. The beef was perfectly medium-rare and juicy, even though grass-fed has 1/2 the fat of corn-fed beef, less saturated fats and more omega 3s. This lean cut of tender beef was delicious and I didn't feel sluggish afterwards like I sometimes do after eating fattier cuts of grain fed steak. I had a full night ahead and was still in party mode. Instead of fries I opted for the sea salt mashed potatoes. They were deliciously dreamy enough that I had to pinch myself to make sure I was awake. I wanted to dive inside that dish of perfectly pureed mash and lose myself in there forever.The dark chocolate cake with layers of ganache and toasted marshmallow was fit for a goddess, just divine. I couldn't get enough of the chocolatey, fudgy ganache. The tiny chocolate pearls were airy and lightly crunchy and the whipped marshmallow was sweet and fluffy. And hey! They say dark chocolate is full of anti-oxidants that are good for your heart.Next time you want to enjoy yourself and have a delicious dinner before going out NYC style, make a rezzie at ABC Kitchen. You can eat your heart out and not feel like you're dragging your feet around after. Sometimes being good to yourself in NYC is as easy as A-B-C.",2,1,1,Justine F.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,36,1

The room is beautiful - slightly stark with interesting decorative touches.....love the old school light bulbs over the tables. The service was prompt and friendly without being overbearing.My boyfriend and I shared the foie gras toast and raw diver scallops as an appetizer. The foie gras was very tasty but the scallops were a standout - light citrus-y dressing with a bit of a green chile kick - delicious!We had the black bass & suckling pig as entrees. Both incredibly enjoyable. For the 2 apps, 2 entrees & a moderately priced bottle of wine, we were set back only $160......not bad for a delicious dinner at a restaurant in the JG empire.

5.0,2/17/2012,"This meal was incredible. The only downside is I tried to make reservations more than a week in advance, and all that was available was 10:00pm on a Monday night. Fine. I took advantage and hopped to two bars before arriving. However we (drunkenly) had trouble finding the entrance, and arrived at 10:13. The hostess refused to seat us because we were late! Now let me tell you, if you make me wait until 10pm to have dinner I will be STARVING. If you don't feed me I might cry. Luckily with some (insistent) sweet talking (and the swooping in of a friendly gentleman who seemed above them in the workplace hierarchy) we were seated. (Note. Don't be late.)We ordered Mushroom Toast, the Roast Suckling Pig, a pizza with radicchio, prosciutto and dates (Y.U.M.), as well as the donuts and pear crumble for dessert. I did see a waiter drop one of my donuts on the floor... I'm pretty sure they didn't serve it to me. So that's a positive. The food was spectacular. The pizza was BLOW MY MIND good. I can't wait to try this combination of flavours at home. Yes, I was a little bit tipsy, and that might taint the review, but everything was really delicious. I appreciated that they split the suckling pig entree for us onto two separate plates without us asking.The boy put it in his top 5 meals we have had together. Period. So that's saying something.We expected the meal to come to more than it did. It helped that we had already had a few drinks (and 3 plates of oysters), so we shared a few things, and only had a glass of wine each, but compared to a few other spectacular meals I have had (Sky Room in San Diego for example) the cost was significantly less.

We stumbled upon it after being turned away from Pipas Tapas, and to be fair we didn't have a reservation on a Friday night but we were a little surprised since it was only 6pm. There weren't any tables left at ABC either, but they seated us in a cocktail area in the back, in comfy living room chairs, that in my opinion was even better than sitting at a regular table.Service was very attentive and our waitress gave us an excellent recommendation -- the crab toast. SO GOOD. I would come back for several orders of this alone. We also had the calamari (decent, not amazing) and roasted brussel sprouts with rosemary (so good, and healthy!). We were trying to eat semi-healthy and didn't want to gorge ourselves on a big expensive meal, so ABC was the perfect compromise. With three small plates we were comfortably full without breaking the bank. We each had a glass of wine as well, and the tab came to only $30/person, which is pretty unheard of for a nice meal in NYC.

3.0,1/8/2012,"After a debacle on our first visit where we ended up leaving before we ordered, I contacted the manager and he went above and beyond by inviting us back as his guest to make it right. WIth all the hype, the month+ of waiting and the mouth-watering pictures, i had really really high expectations. Unfortunately, the only incredible dish I had last night was the crab toast. It was so fresh and light tasting and I loved the aioli dotted on it. The calamari was good, but nothing I'd specifically come back for. The kasha with veal meatballs wasn't a pleasant mix of flavors to me and my boyfriend ended up eating all of it since he wasn't a fan of the fried chicken and said it wasn't worth eating all the grease. The still warm fresh mozzarella lacked in the flavor department and the char-grilled bread kind of overpowered it. I didn't try the ravioli but am told it was good. The salted caramel sundae failed to impress me, but as it melted and i started picking at it the saltyness started to come through more and I did start to enjoy it. Overall the service was much friendlier but pretty slow at times. If I was in the area looking for a snack I'd stop in for a blood orange bellini (delish!) and a piece of crab toast.",1,0,0,Jen G.,"New York, NY",36,188,0

5.0,1/4/2012,"ABC Kitchen is absolutely phenomenal but definitely requires advance planning because reservations go very quickly! After visiting on Sunday, ABC is definitely in my top 3 NYC restaurants.  The restaurant is beautiful inside, with great chandeliers and an almost country feel which fits with its organic/locavore menu. First off, our waiter was super enthusiastic. When we asked about the food, instead of just telling us his favorite, he launched into an entire speech about texture which was different but made sense in light of the food. We started off with crab toast with lemon aioli and the roast carrot and avocado salad with crunchy seeds, sour cream and citrus, two of their specialty appetizers. The two were quite different but both phenomenal. The crab toast had great but simple flavor and the carrot was well seasoned and the salad was an amazing meld of flavors. Instead of getting a drink at dinner, I tried their housemade ginger and lime soda. Even though I'm not much of a soda drinker, this was amazing. It wasn't overly sweet at all and the flavor was very distinct and a great complement to the meal. For our entrees, I got cornflake crusted skate with kale and sweet potatoes and my boyfriend got their fried chicken with collard greens and hot sauce butter. Both were fantastic. The skate had a great crunch from the cornflake and the plating with the sweet potato and kale was a great seasonal mix. The fried chicken is one of ABC's specialities and while I am definitely not a fried chicken girl, it was phenomenal. The inside was so juicy and flavorful and I was definitely happy to take a few bites as it was a massive piece. For desert, we went for the famous sundae with salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts and popcorn and chocolate sauce which was to quote our waiter, ""indulgent"". It was definitely large and needs to be split but absolutely delicious. Clearly, I'm a huge ABC fan and can't wait for another trip back!",0,0,0,Lauren D.,"Far Hills, NJ",0,3,0

The warmth we felt on entering the restaurant (early, and minus one in our party and they seated us right away and didn't make a fuss about our missing person) was particularly welcome given the dreadful cold rain outside. The food is delicious. I had the apple and pear salad, with perfect matchstick pieces of each; I could have eaten it for days, it was tart and fresh and crisp. I had a tender and perfect piece of cod. I'm kind of old fashioned--I tend to like my cod flaky and dry (i.e., fish and chips!), but this was tender, with a nice bite. This is one of the few places where I can honestly say that I want to go back and go back and go back so I can try more things.

3.0,1/2/2012,"We've been to ABC kitchen a few times, and we generally enjoyed the food and the service. (Btw, the food quality/portion vs. price ratio is very decent. I really like the food here.)Tonight was an exception. We were at table 52, and our server was Rachel. She completely ignored us for almost 20 minutes before she took our order. She was very cold. She didn't say anything about the menu, nor did she mention any specials for tonight. Then she forgot our lemon, then forgot our bread, nor did she remember to ever come to us to check on how things were. We were just left sitting there. Eventually I tried to get her attention when she was around us (after quite some wait), but she never looked our way (were we somehow invisible???) and then I was helped by a server who was helping a totally different area - Thank you very much! This is the friendly and helpful staff I know of at ABC Kitchen! We have always had great experience with the servers at ABC Kitchen, but Rachel was somehow very cold to us. We gave a fair tip because others helped out. But seriously, if the restaurant manager reads here, please take note and treat this as a compliment to the staff and a complaint to this one person.

It was an excellent place to celebrate my 6 year anniversary with my love.My advice would be to order something from each part of the menu. Some highlights were the kabocha squash toast, the raw scallops, and the cauliflower with fried egg. If you tell your waitress that you are splitting courses, they will do it for you in the kitchen. We split the pasta with chantrelles (they were out of the ravioli which i really wanted) and also shared the lobster. I thought that the brussel sprouts side were really nothing spesh otherwise the rest of the sides/apps - all great. The menu changes regularly to stay inline with the farm to table mantra.

5.0,12/29/2011,"ABC Kitchen is new favorite restaurant in NYC.  I was lucky enough to be able to go on a company account, so I didn't have to pay for it, but ABC Kitchen is definitely one of the places I would happily splurge at.  The restaurant itself is kind of funny to get to, chiefly due to the fact that it is attached to a home furnishings store (a few other places are also attached to ABC Kitchen).  It is then appropriate that the décor of the restaurant is absolutely stunning, since ABC itself is a pretty trendy place.  The plates were delightfully and deliberately mismatched, chipped, and discolored.  It is one of those things that is so wrong its right. The casual nature of the restaurant is omnipresent-the wait staff is deliberately underdressed and there is a  ""country kitchen"" type of feel to the entire experience.   In addition to bread and butter, a dish of radishes is set down, and bountiful appetizers await. I was with a group of about 20 and we had perhaps 10 appetizers, all of which were spectacular.  I won't go into detail about every single one of them, but the Salmon Tartare stole the show.  I've had a lot of salmon and a lot of tartars, however, never the two together.  It was amazing, and could have only stood out by using really high quality ingredients, as when you have a dish that is not actually cooked and is really just a bunch of raw ingredients assembled together, you cannot risk having it be less than spectacular.With respect to entrees, I ordered the fried chicken. It was good and was served as a huge portion.  Unfortunately, the chicken wasn't  anything special-the coating was void of any deep flavor and the portion was so large that I felt a little gross after eating it. Dessert was fine.  Doughnuts and an ice cream sundae.  It was actually very good, served with very good coffee, but I suppose a bit boring.All in all, it was a fantastic meal, and I would be happy to return for the tasting menu.  Adventurous takes on ordinary foods.",2,1,1,Abe G.,"Manhattan, NY",511,93,7

I ordered the thyme lemonade and he had a plain old vodka soda. The bartender was friendly and our table was ready within a few minutes.We were seated at a long table in the middle, which they sat another party of 4 at a few minutes later. They were far enough away that I wasn't bothered by it.  We started with the crab toast with lemon aioli and the spinach with goat cheese whole wheat pizza. Both were delicious, though I liked the crab toast the best. It was tempting to get another order. As my entree I ordered the black sea bass and he had the salmon. They were good, but I wasn't in love with either dish as much as I was with the appetizers.Our server was wonderful. She was very attentive and had a genuine smile on her face.

5.0,12/27/2011,"ABC Kitchen is Jean-Georges' venture into the popular locavore arena. Having been disappointed by some of his other restaurants, I was skeptical about ABC Kitchen despite the hype and difficulty of getting a reservation (settled for 9:30 on a Sunday 29 days out! I know, it was sloppy not doing 30).  After dining there, however, I have to say that all the praise is justified. This was definitely one of the best all-around meals I've ever eaten.I would describe the space as ""woodsy chic."" It feels like you've entered someone's decked-out log cabin. The noise level was surprisingly low for a packed restaurant, yet another reason you should bring a date here. The service was fantastic with our waitress describing dishes in a mouth-watering detail I've never experienced before. Nearly everything we ate was great or better. ABC Kitchen needs to be in the discussion for best restaurants in New York, especially among those you can eat at for under $100/person.Roasted Kabocha Squash Toast  - The squash was very fresh, soft and flavorful. It was very good but lacked the complexity of some of the other dishes here.Roasted Cauliflower - The cauliflower was crisp and tasty with the fried egg helping keep it moist.Farro Salad - The farro was mixed with sweet potatoes, cranberries and bleu cheese. The symphony of sweet, salty, tart and smoky was simply amazing.Whole Wheat Pizza w/ ricotta, dates, prosciutto and radicchio - We ordered way too much food and pizza was last but we couldn't stop ourselves from devouring it. The dates surprisingly didn't make it too sweet and the flavor of the baked ricotta was phenomenal. Throw that on a paper thin crust and it's one of the best pizza's in New York.Cornmeal Crusted Skate - Skate's not always the most exciting fish but the kale and butternut squash puree added a bitter/ sweet combo that was to die for.  Hope they keep this one on the menu as long as they can.Roasted Suckling Pig - Crispy bacon (and bacon marmelade!) on top and soft, melt-in-your mouth pork underneath.

It was the perfect place for my family -- beautiful design, relaxed but elegant vibe, not too loud, and most importantly, AMAZING food!! Between the four of us, we got the crab toast, salmon tartare, and cauliflower dish to start. The crab toast was RIDICULOUS. I'm still thinking about it. A must-have for sure. Salmon tartare was also amazing. Perfectly grilled sourdough bread as the base for both the tartare and the crab toast. We ordered the cauliflower dish with the egg on the side because I don't eat eggs, even though the waitress cautioned us that it might be a little dry--It was THE MOST DELICIOUS CAULIFLOWER I've ever had in my life!! Even my dad who doesn't love vegetables like I do agreed. Then for our main dishes we had the house made spaghetti with chanterelles, the tomato basil pizza, the burger, and the sunchokes. The spaghetti is now one of my top five favorite pasta dishes (along Scarpetta's spaghetti, and Spago's sweet corn agnolotti), and the sunchokes were an amazing seasonal special. Definitely get them while you can! I did not try the burger but they loved it, and the pizza was solid. I've definitely had better as far as the dough but their tomato sauce is really delicious. The pinot noir and blood orange bellini were also excellent with the meal. And for dessert, I had heard so much about their salted caramel sundae that we had to try it and it definitely lived up to the hype!! We also got the doughnuts that were perfectly light and airy.

Its beautiful in an industrial meets organic juxtaposition with exceptional service, and an incredibly diverse and ever-changing menu.We ordered:Butternut Squash w/ Parmesan - sweet, sour, crunchy, and nutty - nice portion size.Raw Diver Scallops - out of this world. A crazy flavor combination of sweet,fresh, nutty, and sea.Housemade Spaghetti w/ Chanterelles - Very generously sized entree, with large chanterelles - yet overly salty.Fried Chicken - good crunch, great sauce. Chicken breast only.Sunchokes w/ Hazlenuts - look like bamboo shoots or ginger, but taste like a crunchy sweet potato. Interesting and delicious.Pear Crumble w/ Ginger Ice Cream - comforting, fresh, and just the right balance of sweet, creamy, and crunchy.While the price seems high, quality was fantastic and service amazing. Demand is very high (with many full tables at 10:30 pm) so if you're looking to save cash, pray that ABC gets unpopular fast. With my stellar experience, I doubt it will happen soon! 4.5 stars",1,0,1,Suanne L.,"Brooklyn, NY",198,979,842
4.0,12/13/2011,"Definitely a fan of this place! Came here during lunch hour today to meet a friend and boy was it crowded! We opted to get a first available table which took about 20 minutes for us to get seated. Once we were seated, the waiter was very attentive to what we wanted to try on the menu and the food didn't take long at all to come out. My friend and I ordered the calamari which had two dipping sauces which were really a delight. The calamari was seasoned really well and very tasteful. For the entree I ordered the Roasted Turkey Sandwich with bacon which came with a side of fries, and that was pretty good. The one thing  I would suggest or would have wished about the bread was that it  be lightly toasted. It was kinda hard to chew, however it was still good. My friend ordered the cheeseburger and she stated that it was really good(from the look of her plate it must have been, lol). ABC Kitchen is a very trendy spot, so you could totally go with a group of friends or bring a date here.

If it didn't take a month to get a 10pm reservation for 2 and the service wasn't as bad as it was - maybe, just maybe, I'd give it a better rating. We get there at 10 to 10 and don't get seated till 10:05 - fine. Our waitress was no where to be found. She didn't actually come to the table till at least 1030 - which was when we first got a chance to take a peek at the menu and order drinks. We quickly ordered a meat & cheese plate since we were starving. The meat and cheese plate doesn't get to us till 1045 - I don't get it... nothing to cook there. We finally got out of there at a quarter to 12 and we didn't get anything special. The food was meh. We got the meat and cheese plate - nothing special, the calamari - was fine, pizza with fig and prosciutto -  liked it better after I picked the salad off the top, a pasta with lamb meatballs which they burnt, and the burger medium rare which came out seared on both sides but completely rare in the middle. Not only was it hard to hear because it was packed but they were also blasting rock music. Hey, i'm just as much as a fan of pearl jam as the next guy but come on - you're at a restaurant not a bar.

Our group had the pork, ravioli, sea bass, and halibut for dinner and everyone enjoyed their meals. For dessert DO NOT MISS the sundae, salted caramel ice cream with popcorn, peanuts and chocolate.

4.0,12/1/2011,"Update after dinner for 3 where everything was split  -- some things are still great and some were not so much.    They do a nice job splitting shared dishes for you.WINS:- Fried Chicken:  Huge, juicy, light and crispy on the outside, almost like tempura batter but even finer.  Delicious, and enough to fill up 2 people as entrees.  Collard greens on bottom and a sauce that was a little spicy, but thats it.  The chicken is the real star of the dish, and I liked that simplicity.  - Suckling pig:  A surprisingly smaller portion.  It was a rectangular cut of pork with some sweet chunks on top from the plum and bacon marmalade.  It was good but everyone liked the chicken more. - Prune pizza:  Take a gamble on these pizzas - they're good, creative, and unusual and will give your jaded New-Yorker taste buds a nice surprise.  This was the special pizza of the night, and we went for it because it sounded unappetizing.  I've learned from past experience here that the stranger sounding the pizza is the more delicious it is (ie clam pizza.  mm.).  The prune pizza came with endives and proscuitto - the combination of sweet prune and salty proscuitto was delicious.   - Roasted butternut squash - Mmm.  Good comfort winter vegetable especially roasted.- Chicken Liver Toast - Yummy.  Satisfying, light, crunch toast.  Nicely done.  BOOS:- Roasted beets with housemade yogurt: I love beets, but not sure why I read raving reviews about this dish.  Beets tasted very ordinary -- the yogurt was fine but didn't really enhance the beets in any way.  Left me dreaming of the beets with goat heese and pistachio dish at Purple Pig in Chicago.  Now THAT was a beet dish.- Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli:  This was a let-down.   I LOVED the Peekytoe crab toast appetizer the previous two times I was here.  I guess this is just regular ol' crab.  It didn't taste like much.  SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN:- Salted Caramel Sundae: I remember this as being amazing.  It was still pretty good this time, but wasn't as awesome as the first time.  Pretty generous dessert - 3 scoops of caramel ice cream with judge and popcorn.  Flavors still go well together, and isn't too sweet.- Scallops: Special appetizer of the night.  Good but nothing special.  - Brussels Sprouts: Roasted until blacked on outside and tender inside.  Decent side, but I've had much better brussels sprouts. Am I still a fan of this place?  Absolutely!  I still love the atmosphere, the space, the relaxed but efficient service -- definitely a fun spot to have dinner if you're not into stuffiness.  And the food, for the most part, is still very good.  It just may have lost a touch of its initial luster.  What's left is still a solid choice in the Union Square area for an upscale but reasonable dinner.",1,1,1,Lu H.,"New York, NY",1218,411,1977
5.0,11/30/2011,"I had Thanksgiving dinner here with my fiancé and future mother in law. We love fresh food, and the fact that majority is organic was a huge plus. Our reservation was for 2pm but we were hungry early and around the area about 12:30pm. I asked the hostess and she was happy to accommodate us at 12:30pm. The restaurant itself is really cool. All vintage mix and match China is used and the menus are printed on paper, and clipped to cardboard to make it more green then some book-style menu. The fact the menu changes often probably accounts for the menu style as well. The wait staff was very accommodating throughout the entire experience. We were there for almost 3 hours and we were never looking around for anyone. For starters we had roasted butternut squash, a Margarita pizza, & Salmon Tartar on grilled foccacia bread. It was all simply delicious. We had high expectations when it comes to ""farm to table"" restaurants and this was exceeded our expectations. For entrees, 2 of us had the Turkey special, (Thanksgiving and all) and the other person had the Chilean Sea bass. The turkey entree was so good. The stuffing was amazing. Everything was fresh, and prepared perfectly. My mother in law loved the sea bass so much, she was raving to strangers about the broth and taste for days. We also ordered a market table side of Sun chokes. They were very good. This was the first time I have ever tried them and liked them very much. For dessert it was chocolate cake with marshmallow icing. The marshmallow icing was out of this world. You could taste the granulated sugar particles in the icing, it was so fresh.

The decor is adorable and very chic- a bit dark, as mentioned, for a brunch, but has a very nice ambiance. The table settings are done in a rustic-style and I later saw all the items for sale in the store. I came here with two other girls and we decided to start with the mushroom pizza to share, and then I had the Smoked Salmon with Potato Roesti. A bit too salty and I wish I had some bread or something to temper it, but the smoked salmon was awesome, as was the crispy roesti. My dining mates had the Waldorf Salad (very good and light with nice crunchy apple matchsticks) and the Crispy shrimp salad, which I thought was a big underwhelming- it looked like a standard salad they serve you at a sushi place with the carrot ginger dressing but with fried shrimp on top. The salted caramel sundae is divine! The texture of the salted caramel ice cream is like nothing I've had before- It feels like it is compromised more of caramel than ice cream. It lays on a pool of chocolate and is topped with caramel covered popcorn. The service was friendly- they were busy but our server was quite cordial. I definitely recommend for a nice brunch- would love to come back and check out their dinner!A note on finding the place though- they have scaffolding up now so it's a bit hard to find from the street but look for the black flags with ""Ann Sacks"" on them and it's right next door.",1,0,0,Shiori I.,"Manhattan, NY",5,71,0

We started at the bar with a couple martinis that were done perfectly by a slightly unfriendly bartender... the other two bartenders were open and friendly and she seemed a bit off but everyone can have those days so on to the important stuff: food.Appetizers: pretzel crusted calamari and chicken liver toast, the calamari was better than an average bar and the toast was pretty spectacular.Entrees: Mushroom pizza w/farmfresh egg and the fried Chicken. Great, heavy, tasty pizza. I almost never order chicken (really don't care for it at ALL) but our entrees were based on a recommendation from a friend, who is also a chef...it was fantastic. The crisp was perfect, no bones and the white meat was so juicy/flavorful. Slightly fattier than I wanted but it's fried chicken. duh.Dessert: scoop of mint chocolate sorbet and the salted carmel sundae. Sorbet was ok, wasn't what I was in the mood for but the sundae was absolutely on point. It's very rare to find salted caramel that is perfectly salted and sweet, where neither the sweet or the salt overpowers the other. The popcorn on top was perfectly stale and crunchy and the heat of the chocolate balanced out the cold of the ice cream.  It would have gotten 2 stars had it not been for: fried chicken, the sundae and the super value of the wine list (a bottle of white bordeaux under $40?

Kudos to the use of organic ingredients and the environmentally friendly approach they utilize in their restaurant.   For lunch, I sampled the prix fixe menu ($28) and a few appetizers to share amongst my group.Appetizers:1. Crab Toast:  Definitely get this as a side!  The toast has generous chunks of crab piled high on toast.  Buttery (melts in your mouth!), sweet, and succulent- can I have my toast like this from now on?  Can't go wrong with this one.2. Raw diver scallops - Perhaps i was expecting whole scallops, like with Japanese places. Can you blame me? For 16 dollars, I get thin layer of scallops on a shell.  The grape pieces were bigger than the scallops itself.  it was seasoned well with lemon so it was like eating a ""thin"" ceviche but for the price you're paying for this dish, it's a bit much.  Maybe if I would have kept the shell?3. Line caught tuna sashimi with mint and ginger- This was good but quite frankly, I've had better tuna sashimi at Japanese restaurants for a fraction of the price.  Yes, it's organic so the price ($16) reflects it but just wanted to warn you that it's not really a plate meant for sharing. It had about 4 pieces of sashimi. The Prix fixe:1. Appetizer:  Roasted beets with house-made yogurt.  Ironic to say, this was my 2nd favorite appetizer.  There were 3 different types of beets with different shades of red.  The beets were sweet, soft, and complimented the tangy yogurt sauce.  It felt really fresh as if it was rightly plucked from the gardens. Loved it.2. Entree: Braised hake, which comes on a bed of green cabbage and other vegetables.  The fish was flaky and tender.  The fish was subtle in flavor but the cabbage was a bit on the salty side. It's best to eat it together so they compliment each other.3. Dessert was turnover cranberry cake, which was pretty good and came with plump cranberries.Overall, your best bet is probably the fixed price menu as you can sample a few dishes (and it saves money as oppose to ordering them individually).  Some of the sides are a little over priced if ordered individually so do note that they do come in small portions.  The rustic atmosphere though is calming and inviting and gives you a break from the hustle and bustle.",5,2,2,Wing L.,"Long Island, NY",201,245,78

5.0,11/5/2011,"Love this place so much. I went last week for lunch and ended up getting the prix fixe for $28.AppetizerI went with lentil soup ($13 individually), which I had tried before. There is a strong sense of basil but it's not overpowering. The lentils are cooked well but not to the point where they become mushy. I actually would have preferred that they were slightly firmer, but I can't argue too much with this. A great choice on a rainy day, as it was when I was there.EntreeBraised hake ($25) on a bed of green cabbage, seaweed, chilies. Hake is a white flaky fish. It has similar texture to cod and tasted somewhat similar to that. It was slightly undercooked, but I happen to like fish that way. The cabbage was really great. My lone criticism is that, like many dishes at ABC, there was more oil than I would like. DessertThe best sundae I've ever had. Here is how the menu describes it: ""salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts & popcorn, whipped cream, chocolate sauce.""The ice cream was fantastic. What makes the dish is probably the popcorn. Having that salty taste (the popcorn had caramel draped over it) meshes perfectly with the sweetness of the ice cream. Then there was the chocolate sauce, which was as good as I've ever had. CC Brown's hot fudge is famous, but this is better. It's lighter and sweeter, although it's still quite thick. I can't recommend this enough. If you're looking for a great dessert to try, this is it.Overall, the fixed price menu is the way to go. For $28, you end up getting what would cost $50-$60 if you choose the app, entree, dessert individually. As always, the bread and olive oil were great, as was the water that's distilled on-site. Make reservations early, though. Like, a couple weeks out.",1,0,1,Kyle S.,"Portland, OR",19,97,0

Cocktails were very good, love the ginger margarita taken from Spice Market. Food was excellent from appetizers through to dessert. Service was friendly & professional.Our one complaint was the timing of the food from the kitchen - one person in our group did not get her appetizer until the other 3 of us had finished ours - our waiter kept checking with the kitchen but something had gone wrong. Her main course was also delayed, but this time by only a few minutes. The restaurant removed the late appetizer from the bill, a nice gesture.

It's one shot each of  simple sugar, light rum and lime juice then you muddle fresh basil in it and shake over a martini glass. Voila! Don't worry about infusing the simple syrup its not really needed and you don't get the fresh burst of basil flavor without muddling the basil. This time around we had a manhattan more of the basil daquiri concoction. heirloom tomatoes. Fresh tomato cheese pizza and the clam pizza. I think the menu just shifted a little as it wasn't on the menu last time. Love it all. Saved room for the Sundae.  It was very good but not my thing. It had the salty sweet, fudgey, crunchy, gooey thing going on but all in all not my fave. The donuts that were on another guests table looked awesome though!

But they seated us about an hour earlier so that was nice.Honestly, not a fan of the decor. Not sure what the intentions are. It's fine but just seems a bit... disconnected. Anyway, only 3 of us ate.The waitstaff, cordial and helpful, brought out two complimentary appetizers - the crab toast and the butternut squash toast. The crab toast was very good, though I""m not a fan of crab, and had a healthy dollop of some sort of mayo/aioli that worked well. Was a big fan of the BS toast, sweet and creamy.Unbeknownst to the surprise complimentary appetizers, we had ordered two other appetizers:-The diver scallops - raw, chilled, served with concord grapes - was excellent. A highly refined plate that stood out amongst the others we ordered.-The Pretzel Dusted Calimari - not as special. Not sure where the pretzel came in because it tasted like plain old calimari to us. Not worth our stomach space.We shared three entrees:-The fried chicken - moist and delicious. Even the meat, regardless of the perfectly fried crust, was juicy and delicious. Served with a negligible hot butter sauce, on top of expertly cooked collared greens. The downside of the dish was that it was one LARGE piece of boneless chicken, which, convenience-wise, was okay, but taste wise may not have been as good as bone-in chicken, especially with some dark meat thrown in there.-The burger - cooked as we asked, medium-rare, and had a good jalepeno aioli to accompany which gave it a little kick, though nothing to write home about. We split this three ways so it was difficult to really assess with what little burger we each had but we all agreed that we could've ordered that for one of us (anyone of us) as a standalone entree and it would've made us happy.-The roast suckling pig - when we were given the three entrees, the waitstaff (a few members actually) commented that we chose their three favorite dishes on the menu. Whether that was true or not, the suckling pig was the least of our favorites. It wasn't presented in quite the way as we expected (almost like a meaty loaf), surrounded by bitter greens and the bacon marmalade, that had far more jam than bacon. It was a suitable dish but not quite as gracious as we had hoped.We finished with some salted caramel dessert which was fine, nothing spectacular.With a bottle of wine, the dinner came out to about $80/person.

A bit surprising considering the overall experience we had, but apparently people are in love with this place.As far as ambiance -- it's beautiful. White, crisp, clean and modern. Loved it.Our drinks were good, usual. I ordered on ""fun"" cocktail and then a glass of wine, boyfriend got his usual martini and glass of wine. All very standard.The amuse bouche was a radish with a bit of mustard seed dressing (?) on it. Like all uncooked radishes, it was a really strong bite. I was pleased when the bread came to fill my mouth with another flavor after the radish...We ordered the crab toast to start and it was delicious. The crab was wonderful and any good bread grilled and covered with that much olive oil is going to be great.We also ordered the pretzel covered calamari. There's nothing special about the pretzel covering -- tastes like any other fried calamari breading. That said, the calamari was fresh and the light fry was great on it.For mains, I decided to get the housemade chicken & pork sausage  and roasted squash with parmesan (both from the market table menu) while boyfriend got the roasted maine lobster ($37). He asked if the chef would deshell it for him as he was suited up and wanted to try not to make a mess. Our server said they would do it -- no problem.So my dishes were great. The parsley and mustard dressing that came as a side with the sausage was fresh and tart. The sausage itself was great and the squash was cooked perfectly. As for the lobster... it was the most tragic display of lobster we'd seen -- about as much meat as you would get from a lobster roll, scattered in little pieces around the plate which was drizzled with lemon vinagrette. The plate was practically empty. No garnish, no anything. At first, we thought they might have taken the plate before the chef was done plating but when we asked, we were assured that was it.I usually HATE uncomfortable situations with servers when you have to say why you're unhappy with your dish. I have to give our server lots of credit, he was warm, respectful and gracious (I think he agreed that the plate looked measly, especially for $37...) when listening to our issue with the lobster. I should mention, the few bites of lobster meat that were on the plate were delicious.Anyway, our server was sweet enough to comp us an extra dessert (like I needed TWO desserts) and a second glass of dessert wine (so nice). So we tried the warm donuts -- awesome, and a warm apple dumpling which was seasonally tasty and great.Service - A+Food - B (radish was weird start, lobster was a disappointment, otherwise tasty)Won't rush back, but not a bad option in the area...",1,0,0,Laura Y.,"Westport, CT",117,164,0

The scallops are not worth it, a little pedestrian in preparation and nothing special.

They have a brunch special which is deep fried oysters on a bed of soft scrambled eggs and a drizzle of jalapeno-laced butter, served with a side salad. Its like fireworks in your mouth - one of the most amazing things I've tasted in a long time! The other dish we had were the berry pancakes serviced with lemon custard and maple syrup. Also to die for! I'm not the biggest fan of pancakes but these take the cake! Will definitely be coming back for a second helping of these!

Yes, it's pricey, but I feel as though ABC serves you a meal that is worth it. I'm a sucker for desserts and doughy-things generally. If you are like me, you will be very happy with ABC's pizzas, sandwiches and cakes. All of the ingredients are fresh. The portions are not overwhelming, but rather a reasonable, satisfying size.

So you can imagine my disappointment when this restaurant--one of the ""hot places"" in New York right now--overcharged me by $30 (after I signed my receipt for the correct amount). $30 is basically just enough to make it annoying. I have since called THREE times to be told each time that it was the restaurant's ""rush"" hour, but I would receive a return phone call first thing the next day. I have still not received a return call. I think this behavior--basically credit card fraud--is extremely unprofessional for a restaurant of this caliber.

My husband had the Salmon, again cooked perfectly making for both our fish light and flakey.

We wanted to try something 'different' and it met every expectation in terms of decor, ambiance, service and it was delicious! I do agree that it's a little pricey, however my friend and I decided to get two appetizers and then a half order of the entree which was certainly enough. She ordered the pretzel dusted calamari (very tasty, cooked to perfection and not greasy) and I ordered the summer squash salad (with no cheese). The squash was sliced thinly over a bed of arugula and it was much larger than I thought - a good dish to share - and the squash was so flavorful. Side note - the vegetables are from the Union Square Market and are also beautifully arranged on a table in the room.For my main course, I ordered the spaghettini with shrimp and cherry tomatoes. Again, cooked to perfection and the shrimp was so tasty. My friend ordered the spaghetti with squash blossoms - it looked delicious but as I am lactose intolerant, I did not try it. Dessert: I ordered the chocolate mint sorbet which brought me back to the days of Mint Chocolate Chip at Carvel. It was creamy, rich and delicious and dairy-free! She ordered the bread pudding with homemade maraschino cherries. Asking for some extras as I wanted to try, they brought it on a separate bowl so not to touch any of the pudding. There was a hint of mocha flavor to them - really nice!I loved other touches - the decor, the fact that I went to the restroom and my napkin was refolded on the table.

The decor is absolutely charming and I literally could not keep my eyes from scouting the room (most patrons are quite put-together as well). It was a bit on the pricey side but in my opinion well worth it.That is, until my food arrived. I ordered the daily special. It was a homemade chicken sausage, an egg sunny-side up, and potatoes with caramelized red onions and some sort of peppers. The entire meal was scrumptious and I devoured it all but by far the sausage and caramelized onions were shining stars. My friends ordered pancakes- which I must say blew my meal out of the water. If I were to come back, that's what I'd get. 3 of the fluffiest, most perfect pancakes served with some sort of custard and fresh organic berries. TO DIE FOR I TELL YOU.

4.0,8/12/2011,"I've been waiting an entire year to come here.  I must thank work for providing me with another opportunity to venture at a desirable eatery that is once again out of my assistant price range.so first off, I LOVE abc kitchen decor, tableware and all.  just love it, i wish my own kitchen and dining room could one day have that swanky feel.now onto the most important part, the food!  i loved the crab toast appetizer.  I could have eaten an entire plate.  The beet salad was alright, beets are beets to me regardless where you are.  my table also ordered two whole wheat pizzas to share too; the mushroom one and a bacon one.  I loved the mushroom... keep in mind these were all appetizers and I had yet to have a main course yet.  I was getting so ridiculously full.  For my main I ordered the bowtie kashi pasta with veal meatballs.  As a fanatic of pasta and meatballs, i thought this would be a winner, but alas I enjoyed my appetizers way more.  Lastly to end off the night, we split some donuts, the salted caramel sundae, and their cookie platter.  The salted caramel sundae, as everyone expected, was to die for. SO DELICIOUS and i'm usually not an avid fan of desserts either unless they are incredibly fruity.  An extra bonus for ABC Kitchen was the fact that our party saw Carla from Top Chef eating there as well.  Coincidentally , my entire table was an avid Top Chef and Bravo audience, so that was entertaining as well.Sigh....this was a dream come true!",1,0,0,Eileen J.,"New York, NY",40,185,0

Love the food, the ambiance, the decor, and the service.  One thing I must mention: I usually like to order Eggs Benedict wherever I have brunch and ABC Kitchen is by far one of my favorite places for that dish.   I would recommend making a reservation for dinner as this place gets booked.  Writing this short review makes me want to go back!",1,0,0,J J.,"New York, NY",2,23,0
4.0,8/11/2011,"After hearing about this place non stop for quite a while, I finally got the chance to try it for myself, to see what all the fuss was about.For starters, the restaurant is huge. The bar area is pretty extensive and the dining area is enormous. The decor makes you feel like you are sitting out on a patio with the stars about you, a pretty impressive feat inside a Manhattan restaurant (and the fact that there is a ceiling above your head). Everything is made of wood and the tables are old looking and each plate and piece of silverware was different, almost like a mix and match, but it fit with the restaurant.The food. I ordered the fried calimari which were delicate and served with a duo of sauces, including a mustard. The calimari were battered in ""pretzel"" whatever that truly means i don't really know, but there were great. I also split the chicken liver toast which was absolutely a must try after all the reviews for it. Now i know they were true and will add to the list of those saying you must try it.For my main course i ordered the suckling pig which was another favorite among most reviews I read. The pig did not disappoint and the crispy skin was worth the price of admission. For dessert, they had a ridiculous salted caramel sundae, but i just tried a few of the ice creams, including that one. I would highly recommend this place as all the food is solid, fresh and really top quality.",3,1,2,Evan H.,"New York, NY",311,782,44
4.0,8/10/2011,"I loved it! So much space that if it's just a couple of you and you don't fit at the many tables, you can likely find a seat at the bar. It's huge and yet it was packed for lunch on a weekday. My friend and I sat at the bar by the front door. I had the prix fixe lunch for $25, which is definitely worth it. The beet and yogurt salad is awesome; I didn't even know there were non-purple beets and I actually like them better! The hake was cooked very nicely and the mustard sauce was delicious, but my one complaint is that there was too much black pepper in the dish. My friend had the gazpacho, which was good and definitely tasted like strawberries, but not overwhelmingly so. We shared the strawberry dessert which was scrumptious! And lighter than others, I'm sure. I love the ambience, such wonderful decor. Great place!! I will definitely be going back again and again.",0,0,0,K B.,"Cambridge, MA",0,127,23

3.0,8/4/2011,"I dined here over lunch with 2 friends.  We ordered a bunch of different things on the menu and got a pretty good sampling of what they have to offer.We had some serious service issues during our visit, which is why I knocked this down from what would have been a 4-star rating.  We had to wait FOREVER for our appetizers.  The waitress kept coming over to say that she didn't know what was taking so long.  Then, we had to wait over 25 minutes to get our desserts.  We were sitting without food or service for an exceptionally long time.  It was strange.  Especially over the lunch hour when people clearly have to get back to work.  Some thoughts:The portions are shockingly small.  I like it when restaurants give a ""normal"" portion and don't bring out insane servings.  But ABC Kitchen has the opposite problem.   My friend ordered the scallops and basically paid $20 for 1 sliced scallop.  It's a little ridiculous.  The prices are shockingly high.  I'm willing to pay more for high-quality, organic food.  I have no problem paying for a good meal.  Some of the dishes were worth a higher price and others weren't.We REALLY enjoyed a salad made of avocados and roasted carrots.  It was overpriced by about $4, but was really good so we didn't care.We thought the gazpacho was nice, but the portion was small and it was something we could've had elsewhere for less.The scallop I mentioned above was a joke.  My friend laughed when he saw it.We did not enjoy the raviolis.  They were slightly cold when they came out and weren't particularly interesting, original, etc.  It was a dish we could've gotten at any restaurant in the city.  Also, only 4 raviolis in a portion?  Come on!We liked the corn dish with the cheese and lime.  That was a standout.  But $9 for a tiny bowl of corn?  We also tried a few toasts and a chicken dish.  They were all ok, but nothing to write home about.  Definitely not worth the price we paid for them.I asked for a ginger beer and they brought me what appeared to be Schwepp's ginger ale.  Not the same thing.  Gross. The space is lovely.They could stand to have a few more vegetarian options and a few entree salads.",0,0,0,Kirsten K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,111,0

4.0,8/3/2011,"i will probably be vilified for saying this, but i was turned off by abc kitchen bc of the whole ""organic"", ""healthy"", ""vegetarian-friendly"" reputation it garnered by my friends.  and i fully admit it: I WAS WRONG.  abc kitchen is really very tasty.  i went twice within one week so that i could try as many things on the current menu (which has already changed) as possible.  i also love small plates to share, which are plentiful here.  more often than not, it was the simplicity of the high-quality, fresh ingredients (locally sourced!) that really made the dishes shine.my faves:-chicken liver toast - smooth, flavorful, wow-crab toast - my S.O., who doesn't like crab, ate every bit of these-warm mozzarella - this got mixed reviews at our table, but i loved the soft, warm cloud of cheese-carrot salad - it doesnt sound that exciting, but it actually is-roasted squash - so simple, so good-spinach, goat cheese pizza - wasn't that excited for it but was REALLY WOWED-corn (side dish) - the sweetness popped in your mouth-the market strawberry dessert - we were stuffed but wanted something sweet - this was perfect!the spaghettini w shrimp and the pretzel calamari were also good, but i dont know if i would order them again.there were a few dishes that i thought were less memorable (so much so that i can't even remember the details) - the ricotta toasts, a pizza special w bacon & arugula (i LOVE bacon, but this wasnt well-balanced) and a sashimi dish... i must note that both times, we didnt order entrees. i'll get there at some point!in terms of service, both times they were attentive, but nothing special.  the restaurant is pretty loud.  difficult to get reservations, but if you go early, it's a free-for-all in the bar area, where there is also table seating.  i can't wait to go back next month.",2,0,0,Christine Y.,"Manhattan, NY",4,27,3
4.0,8/3/2011,"The food at ABC Kitchen is delicious. I had the strawberry goat cheese salad and the chicken paillard, and both were really tasty. The chocolate mint ice cream was superb, and went well with the beautifully served cappucino. The turkey sandwiches looked phenomenal and the sundaes are famous.  The stars are for the refreshing ways to serve healthy and tasty food! The service is a little slow -- we had a reservation for noon and the place was still just about to open, with the staff folding napkins, when we showed up. Most of the customers seem to be taking the day off rather than stopping by for a business lunch, which was really refreshing. If you are in a rush, though, this place is not for you! My only real complaint the napkins -- if you are wearing a dark color suit, pants or a dress, be prepared to have a lot of white lint from the napkins on your clothes!  I wouldn't go as far as to demand black napkins, but napkins that do not make your pants look dirty would be nice.Also, if you are a celiac, you may have bit of a problem finding gluten free options on the menu. Many of the menu items have a lot of surprising spices (at least the pea soup and the chicken palliard) that include small amounts of gluten and the wait staff is not well informed about this. I specifically asked about flour, gluten and spices (red pepper and black pepper often include gluten), and still ended up with a dish that was not suitable for me.",0,0,0,Kirahvi S.,"New York, NY",0,10,0

4.0,7/28/2011,"We were here in May for dinner with our 2 young kids.  Food was very good and service was friendly, even though we were in our ""touristy"" casual attire.  I'd say the decor is more trendy casual. We started with the crab toasts which were good, fresh and light with fresh crab meat, great for summer.  The kids had the kasha and bowtie pasta w/veal meatballs which they enjoyed and ate up.  It wasn't anything too fancy but the sauce was good.I had the roast suckling pig which was great- so tender, melts in your mouth.  But it wasn't overly fatty so that you couldn't eat it, it was the perfect proportion of fat and meat and cooked so nicely. It was served simply with the grilled leeks.  My husband had the seabss with potatoes and spinach which was very good as well.  It was very fresh and simply prepared but cooked perfectly.For dessert I wanted the bread pudding, but my husband wanted the banana chip ice cream cake so we went for that.  Boy am I glad we did. It was SOOO amazingly good. I could've eaten two of them myself.  There were 2 layers of moist delicious chocolate cake with a generous layer of banana chip ice cream sandwiched between.  The perfect balance of chocolate and banana. I can't eat the baskin robbins ones anymore now.Overall a very good meal.  Food is tasty, not overly done up but simple, fresh and prepared very well.Go again?

We were promptly seated by our friendly hostess. I'm gonna go ahead and rate the food, before i talk about the things i did not like about the place (more like hate). We ordered the chicken liver appetizer whilst waiting for one of our friends that was running late. It was absolutely delicious and buttery, almost foie-like. I ordered the buffalo mozzarella pizza and my friend the veal meatball pasta bowl. The food was A-ok, nothing to die for but reasonable. The thing i HATED about this place is the service...it's not that it's bad, it's that i hate when i am waiting for someone to eat lunch, and the waiter keeps coming back to try and get us to order without the full party. This happened four times in 20 minutes!!! I mean, c'mon, you can see we are not ready to order, our friend isn't here yet!! and it's not like it's 12 30 and the place is packed, it was 3 o'clock and we were one of three tables, the only one starting our meal, so there wasn't an issue of turning the table, it was more just to annoy us. The 5th time the waiter came back he said what he should have said the first time, which was that the kitchen was about to close. Instead, he had to hover over our table every 5 minutes trying to get us to order without our friend! This is the only reason why i'm not giving this place more stars.

1.0,7/11/2011,"I was fairly disappointed by my recent trip to ABC Kitchen.  A group of 6 of us went for dinner last weekend and I found most of what we ordered to be mediocre.  The waiter had an unmistakable bitchy attitude.  He quite literally vetoed our wine selection, telling us that the three bottles we were interested in (all under $60) ""tasted like sherry"", and recommended only $100+ bottles.  We did share a few bottles of what turned out to be delicious non-$100+ wine, and enjoyed the cocktails, but the rest of the evening was less than stellar.The calamari, while I'm sure 'pretzel-dusted', tasted like the same fried calamari you've had everywhere else.  The crab toast was so-so, the insane prices for side dishes ($11 for peas and carrots) were hilarious, yet I felt compelled to try a few, thinking that Jean Georges must know what he's doing, right?  Wrong.  The jalepeno corn was somehow both spicy yet completely bland... was swimming in a thin/runny cream, and while once stirred with the mound of cheese piled on top (it's only saving grace) it was edible, I literally cannot say the same for the mashed potatoes.  I've never been served such an overly salted dish at any of NYC's fine dining establishments... while pureed (and probably sieved) smooth, they were crunchy with sea salt chunks, and after two bites (one which left me in shock, the second to confirm how hilariously disgusting they were), I was done.The fried chicken, while not as comically bad as the mashed potatoes, was an oddly massive pile of what appeared to be a de-boned half chicken flattened on top of a bed of greens.  The entire dish was confusingly larger than ever other entree on offer.  The crispy fried exterior was good, and the chicken inside was ok, but the curious bed of greens (which I initially confused for straight basil, but later determined, after asking a server, to be an odd combination of whole-leaf basil, dill and some spinach) was ridiculously bad.  At the end of the meal (we couldn't stomach dessert) the female server who cleared our table (and was much more polite than our bitchy male server) asked if everything had been to my liking, since I hadn't eaten much of my meal.  While I probably should have complained, at that point it seemed too late to even begin.  As an aside, my party found it odd that the only beef entree on the menu was a cheeseburger (aside from one pork and one chicken entree, everything else was seafood).  All in all, it's been awhile since I've overpaid this much to poke around and play with my food like a 7 year old... never eating any of it.We should have gone to Minetta...",1,0,0,D M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0

4.0,7/10/2011,"After reading through pages and pages of yelp reviews and various critic reviews I came to ABC Kitchen for brunch with sky high expectations.  While most Jean Georges restaurants follow his tried and trued formula of fusing Asian and French ingredients and techniques to create gastronomic masterpieces, ABC branches out by emphasizing simplicity.  Located just steps away from the Union Square Green Market, ABC Kitchen preaches and practices exactly what its name entails - simple food with techniques done to showcase and done to simply bring out the flavors inherent to the ingredient.ABC Kitchen is clearly a place to be - the restaurants patrons are fashionably dressed and is a well known date place of many of the rich and famous.  If you're like me and despite your best efforts have not managed to see a celebrity yet, staking out at ABC Kitchen wouldn't be the worst of ideas.  The food:Roasted Beets with Homemade Yogurt: Do I like beets? No.  Do i like yogurt? Not particularly.  Did I like the roasted beets with the yogurt?  Absolutely.  The two perfectly complemented one another - the yogurt's tanginess cutting the subtle sweetness of the beet.  Everyone on yelp raves about this dish and with good reason too.  Smooth.  Luscious.  Delicious.  You must try it.  The yogurt's also delicious with the lightly charred bread that they give you. nom nom nomCrab Toast:  Theres not enough good stuff to be said about the crab toast.  I had always thought crab was just ok; I mean I always thought it was tasty, but not my ideal choice at a restaurant.  ABC Kitchen completely changed my perception.  Soft perfectly seasoned sweet sweet crab on top of lightly toasted bread.  Even after me and my dining companion let the toast sit for a few minutes, the bread still never got soggy. (I still don't know how we did that with something so delicious).  I could've eaten one hundred of them and still be lusting for them.Spinach Goat Cheese Pizza:  What do you imagine when you think of spinach on a pizza?  A few soggy leaves on some fat droopy pizza?  Not so at ABC Kitchen.  Not with Dan Kulger manning the stoves.  The pizza is covered in spinach creating an intense flavor of spinach.  Popeye must have been eating the spinach at ABC Kitchen because it simply tastes more delicious and nutritious than normal spinach. Delicious overkill.Sundae:  Probably the most raved about thing on yelp regarding ABC Kitchen is the ice cream sundae - and it is delicious but don't get it if you're going with only one other person as I did - it's simply too much.  The toffee? ice cream is covered in home made cracker jacks, chocolate sauce, and peanuts - is it good?  Yes, but it was too much for two people to finish, its just too much of a good thing.  If you're in a party of 3 or 4, the portion size is perfect to share - otherwise opt for another one of their hearty and yummy looking desserts.Basil Lime Soda:  You can tell it's freshly made and the flavors just taste intense, like drinking concentrated essence of basil and lemon in carbonated form which is well, exactly what it should taste like.Service:  A little slow - had to wait a while to get our check and for the waiter to get our order.  Our water glasses were never let to empty and because my soda took a while to be prepared, it was comped on the house - gotta be happy about that!No razzle or dazzle at ABC kitchen.  Just delicious food prepared the way it should beThree stars for the food (one for the crab, one for the beets and half each for the sundae and pizza)  One stars for the ambiance.  Four stars.",2,1,1,Stephen T.,"Manhattan, NY",33,21,0

The pork shoulder had a thick strip of the candied skin, which is one of the tastiest things on earth.Our group shared one dessert, some sort of strawberry rhubarb pie thing, which needed a lot more fruit and a lot less crust.

4.0,7/7/2011,"The atmosphere was my favorite part of the entire experience. Wooden tables, plenty of space between tables so you aren't cramped, and calming decor all combined to make our party feel right at home. Severs were all super pleasant and friendly too, despite having to deal with somewhat fickle diners all evening.I ate a phenomenal amount of food here, so will only discuss the items that were truly memorable (we had a farewell dinner here, and ordered about 1/2 of the menu). Appetizers - go with crab toast with lemon aioli and diver scallops. It's actually jumbo lump crab meat on the toast, and the scallops come with some sort of pepper (don't think it was a jalapeno, but it could have been) that gave it an extra kick. A lot of other folks liked the sugar snap pea salad, but I can't seriously take into consideration any dish without meat.The whole-wheat pizzas are all delicious too, but I'd caution against filling up on these as you can probably find comparable ones elsewhere (cheaper too). Nice to have a slice after a smattering raw, organic foods, but not necessary. The meatball one was particularly tasty.OMG the steamed halibut was delicious. It had asparagus and some sort of citrus emulsion sauce that were all cooked to perfection. A friend of mine ordered the suckling pig which looked (and smelled) amazing too, but I'm glad I didn't order it based on the caloric intake I'd endured at that point.Finally...dessert. I'm not usually a dessert fan, but the caramel ice cream with popcorn was ridiculous. Sinfully tasty, and a great way to end the meal.This place is expensive, but not as much so as other comparable places (think Craft right around the corner).

I would have preferred the ham to have a bit more salt / flavor to it, but having a lighter flavor was probably the better move.  Also, the side of home fries / potatoes here were very good - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and seasoned with rosemary and salt.I probably should have ordered a side of bacon here, but I forgot.  I'll be back again, so I'll make sure to get that next time.

This is probably my new favorite restaurant, I took off one star for super snooty service (not sure the waiter ever made eye-contact) but the service was efficient at least. The highlights here are clearly the veggies. We ended up ordering a bunch, almost tapas style, because we couldn't decide on just one or two. The wood-grilled ramps were perfection. The peas with mint were just buttery enough. The squash had a perfect sear on it so that the outside was crispy (with parm) and the inside was soft (almost like a mashed potato consistency).We also split an entree, the spinach and ricotta ravioli (we got three each, for $31). The tomato sauce was perfect, extremely fresh and not doctored with any spices, just the right amount of olive oil and salt. Everything was priced well in the $10-20 range (entrees in the $25-35 range) except I think the ravioli were overpriced. They were good but not that great, I've had better elsewhere.A few missteps involved drinks. The housemade soda I had was spring herb, which was delicious, but came without a sprig of anything in it. My friend had the strawberry soda and it was very syrupy and didn't really taste like strawberry, a little odd ($5 a pop). We ordered tea at the end of our meal and the menu said fresh mint tea, so that's what we expected, not TEA BAGS. Hello! Missed opportunity.The dessert menu looked a little run-of-the-mill: chocolate cake, carrot cake, etc., so we skipped it. The ice creams sounded great, we just weren't in the mood.The atmosphere is very casual and relaxing and decorated the way you would think ABC decorates. It's also clean and not loud when it gets crowded and the tables are well spaced.

The food is phenomenal, the atmosphere is rustic-chic and the service is delightful.  If there were one restaurant I could pick up and bring back with me to LA, this would be it. Located in the ultra fabulous ABC home, ABC Kitchen took inspiration from the home store and built a spot that is both warm and inviting. Having eaten here several times now there are so many things I can highly recommend off the menu.  I'd suggest sharing several different appetizers for the table. The beet salad with homemade yogurt is a perfect way to start the meal.  It's light, sweet, tart and refreshing. The line caught tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint was perfect! The fish comes laying in the marinade and soaks up just enough flavor to give it a little bit of kick from the ginger. You must try one of the toasts--ramp and goat cheese toast was salty and sour with pickled onions and the salmon toast was clean and cool. Pretzel dusted calarmari is crunchy and satisfying with two different dipping sauces: a marinara and an aioli. For entrees, Chef Dan Kluger is a wizard with fish.  The black sea bass has become a staple menu item and is served in a lemony broth with wilted spinach and baby potatoes. The wild king salmon comes with a huge heap of fava beans and a fava bean puree. The fried organic chicken is a moist as possible and served with an excellent hot sauce butter. You MUST have dessert. I don't know anyone that would not love their sundae. Caramel ice cream is covered in caramelized popcorn, hot fudge, candied peanuts and whipped cream. A chocolate cake with ganache is finished with a toasted marshmallow icing.  For something ""lighter,"" try the market strawberries with mint, lime and meringue. A sour cream poppy seed sorbet tops off the berries for a nice finish. The best part about this food is that it is local, organic and seasonal.

Try getting a reservation now, it is sometimes weeks away. We were wandering inside ABC (as I usually do when I pass by) and realized that there is a brand new restaurant downstairs. We decided to give it a shot since we have nothing planned that night. The decor and the ambience was chic but very comfortable. It felt like we went into someone's summer house almost. I ordered beets with yoghurt and the fried organic chicken and my hubby went for the halibut. I couldn't believe how a simple dish like beets and yoghurt could taste so sophisticated and my chicken was tender and delicious. Hubby definitely like the halibut. All we did was to talk about the place, utensils, plates and what an extraordinary job they did for the place. Another important point for was their ingredients were organic and local. It has been a real delight! I tried going back with my girlfriends but we could only get to sit at the bar. Hey, word spreads really fast in NYC.

We decided not to sit at the bar but go elsewhere for a drink, came back in about 40 minutes and got seated almost right away. I ordered the Basil lime daiquiri and my friend got a glass of the Pinot Noir. The cocktail was good - pretty much what I expected it to taste like! For appetizers we ordered the Roast carrot and avocado salad, which was excellent and the sashimi marinated in ginger and mint which was nice but not amazing. We had read rave reviews about their mushroom, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza which sounded both interesting and weird. So of course we had to try it. I thought it was one of the best gourmet pizzas I've ever had. Dessert was the vanilla cream donuts with a bacon fudge sauce that our server recommended.

It was unreal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Make sure you squeeze the lemon on it because the flavors explode immediately.  It is one of the yummiest things I have ever eaten.  We then had the organic chicken and the black bass.  Both were unreal and had a really nice heat to them.  Perfectly seasoned and really enjoyable.  Finally for dessert we decided not to try the sundae and do something different...we went for the banana ice cream cake  and it too was unbelievable.  For $100 for the two of us the meal was a hit!

5.0,6/2/2011,"I told her to leave 6:00PM on Memorial Day free.  Truth be told, weekends leading up to that day had been reserved for families, both hers and mine.  I have a difficult time with reservations 3-4 weeks in advance. Maybe it's the notion that very few restaurants are worth that type of meticulous planning, or maybe it's because I subscribe to the mantra: I don't know what tomorrow will bring.  Rest assured, this was the time frame that Open Table presented when my interest in ABC Kitchen was first piqued. Note: Open Table is the equivalent of tits on a bull.  Be smart and call the restaurant.  We shared  the crab toast, the scallops with apple and mint, and the tuna with a hint of ginger.  The crab toast was delicious, but the highlight of the course and the meal was the tuna. The tuna sashimi receives a sparkling two thumbs up from Chris J, and goes down as the most memorable food I've consumed in at least a year.For entree, she had handmade pasta with spring vegetables and I had the jalepeno cheeseburger.  The cheeseburger was great and had it not been for appetizers and the dessert, I would have said the burger was the standout.For dessert we shared the salted caramel sundae, which was awesome and really something that must be tried if anyone steps foot in ABC.All of that for approximately $140 including tip.  It was expensive, but I would do it again without hesitation, save Open Table for a reservation.The short review would go something like this:Blah blah blah...locavore blah blah blah pucker up to JG's ass...blah blah blah great design/decor.",2,1,1,Chris J.,"Manhattan, NY",215,231,0

Appetizers did not disappoint (ramp & goat cheese toast, mozzarella made in-house), and the flavorful olive oil is still lingering under my tongue...Go for the donuts for dessert -- the bacon fudge sauce is an ""interesting"" accompaniment, but the warm vanilla center allows you to leave with a bite to remember.  And crave.Can't wait to return!",1,0,0,Stephanie L.,"Chicago, IL",53,58,0

4.0,5/25/2011,"Struggling whether to give this review 4 stars or 3. Dont get me wrong, I really liked ABC, but I think I went into it with my expectations set too high and was expecting the best meal of my life with everything I read and heard.... so forgive me if I'm being a tad snobbish with a 3-star rating. The one thing that WAS among the best things Ive had was the raw scallop appetizer with apples. MAJOR flavor, majorly amazing. Every bite was an eye opener. I also liked the crab toast a lot. The mozzarella appetizer was good too- although not as good as burratta done the same way ;) I think I must've mis-ordered my entree with the salmon and fava beans. It wasnt really that great. The fava beans I guess were the best part. I asked for the salmon medium rare and it was definitely at the VERY least medium, but felt too over done and really just didnt have much flavor.I think I could've given this place 5 stars if I just ordered the scallop app and the dessert. ABC might have created the greatest ice cream sundae ever.... salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts, popcorn, whipped cream and chocolate sauce... RIDICULOUS. I dont think I breathed once as I shoveled the sundae in my mouth. I was so full already, but it didnt matter one bit. Loved every second of it. licked plate clean. I would recommend ABC, but do feel there are so many fabulous restaurants with the farm fresh thing going on these days, maybe its not among the absolute tippy top???

5.0,5/24/2011,"The absolute best french toast I have ever had in my life!... And that is what I've been telling everyone since I came back from my trip to the Big Apple. I had a lot of memorable food on my quick trip there, but the french toast at ABC Kitchen totally blew me away. I'm not sure why I felt compelled to order french toast and when it arrived in front of me it looked like two large brown bricks. But when I sunk my fork in to cut a corner off I realized that these are giant fluffy Texas toast-style sweet bread slices! And OHMYGOSH was it delicious. I forced my eating partners to try it and they agreed that it was the best on Earth. I know it's hard to make really bad french toast, but the stuff at ABC Kitchen was just so surprisingly perfect!We started our brunch with the pretzel-crusted calamari, which tasted really fresh. It comes with the traditional red sauce plus an interesting deli mustard sauce -- maybe that's supposed to be a good pairing with the pretzel crust? I didn't love it, but I don't really like deli mustard anyway. It was hard to identify the pretzel-y part of the calamari but I will say that the coating was very crunchy and tasty.It should also be noted that everyone in my party enjoyed the ambiance in this place. For a restaurant in NYC, it is so spacious and open. The decor was clean and a bit country, and we liked it. Also, as a scientist, I very much appreciated that the milk for my coffee arrived in a beaker.

4.0,5/24/2011,"Dined at ABC Kitchen last nightFriendly greeting and seated promptlyService was great all night. Our server was professional, friendly & attentive. It looks like all of the servers were. There was a very high level of service hiding behind those dressed down plaid shirts. Water glasses were always full and even servers that did not have our table specifically seemed empowered enough to offer to take a drink order if they noticed you needed a refill. Whoever trained this FOH staff should be proud.FOODThe two of us shared all of the following:Beets with Homemade yogurt - Neither one of us is a beets person but this could have changed our minds. Neither one of us had beets prepared this way and then coated in yogurt. With a touch of their sea salt, it was a really nice surpriseRamps & Goat Cheese Toast - I had read about the crab toast but with Ramps being in season, how do you pass this up? 2nd best thing we ate! Perfect thickness on the toast. Just the right about of spread & topped with JUST enough cheese. Win. Win. Win. Something worth trying to duplicate at home.Carrot & Avocado Salad - Despite the rave reviews I read, this salad just didn't work for me. I tried almost ever conceivable combination of ingredients in different bites but didn't find one that really worked. A nice touch was that without us asking, the salad came out split in equal portions for both of us. Another tip of the hat to the wait staff.Pretzel Dusted Calamari - I like fried Calamari. Let me rephrase that. I love GOOD fried calamari. I hate 80% of Calamari I am served. My favorites are: Rocco's in Brooklyn & The Sesame Calamari at Calle Ocho. This may jump onto my list. Usually a little more coating than I like (I am a pure AP flour guy) on my Calamari but it worked. The marinara was good but I did not like the mustard Aioli. Fried perfectly.Mushroom & Egg Pizza - This was the single biggest disappointment of the night. We both love ALL the flavors on this pizza but when we asked for it well done, the over easy egg, came over hard. I was looking forward to the gooey egg yolk and it just wasn't there.  The crust was fantastic as was the pizza for 1.5 inches in from the crust. The middle 4"" diameter was inedible mush. There was no way you could pick this up and eat it as a slice. Not to be deterred, we just cut out the middle and ate around it. I would give them a 2nd chance on this one as all the flavor was there. Cook time was just off maybe.Fried Chicken- Ehhh. I had read a lot about this too and was excited to get it. Very moist. Perfectly fried. I did not care for the bed of greens it was on and I hated the spicy gravy on the dollop of mash. In my opinion, it ruined perfectly good mash.Pork Belly Entrée - Very moist also but texture was kind of disappointing and the glaze was super sweet. Nothing I would order again nor recommend. And then there was dessert...Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh­hhhh!!!!!!!!!!I am not a huge dessert guy typically. I usually like to indulge in another cocktail instead but I had read so much about this sundae that I had to get it. And...OH BOY...Did it not disappoint!!!Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Chocolate Sauce, Peanuts (sorry if you are allergic but you are missing out), Dollop of Whip Cream and Popcorn. Three words: texture, Texture, TEXTURE! All the flavors work and work together. There is nothing not to like in here! It is a top 5 dessert that I have eaten and it is gluttonous and non-pretentious. Thank you for this, Dan Kluger and/or Cindy Bearman!Dinner for two with cocktails & tip $250.

I also felt the need to unbuckle my belt and crawl into the fetal position and fall asleep in the corner. I can't remember the last time I experienced a meal that was so comforting and yet completely unfamiliar. Each dish that came to the table was near perfection. The ambiance was quaint with a hint of chic. The clientele, everything you'd expect from a trendy hole in the wall spot in the flatiron district. Beautiful people littered the space like a fashion show and yet all I could really focus on or care about was the food.Organic is the way of life here and you can taste the freshness in the dishes prepared. Each dish had full frontal flavors and layers of texture that made each bite a journey into something unexplored.Once the meal started, there was no going back... each dish came at us like a fleet of Japanese Kamikazee planes at Pearl Harbor.. diving deliciously into our bellies. We completely devoured the raw scallops with lime zest as if it was an oasis in the desert. The pretzel crusted calamari had a mild spice to them and were extremely delicate. The cured meats & cheese plate was layered with flavors and texture; great selection of cheeses and some of the freshest cuts of meat I've had in a long time. The ramp and goat cheese toast was a flavor I've never experienced before and I was amazed how the goat cheese didn't overpower the ramps. Next up were our entrees! To say we were stuffed is an understatement, we could barely lift our forks to the plate. I ordered the fried chicken with ginger. The chicken was PERFECT! Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, and more importantly it was plentiful! I could barely get through three bites when someone mentioned dessert. Dessert came and I felt the buttons on my shirt begin to give way. If you're going to go for dessert, there's only one dish you need to have. The sundae! DONE!

I ventured to try one that had avocado and coconut meat!!! Haha I felt so healthy...until my chicken liver came! It was so creamy and delicious, and just the right amount before our entrees came.I enjoyed a brick-oven mushroom pizza with a baked egg on top, while my guest indulged in the light-as-air pancakes with homemade lemon curd (a little too heavy on the butter, and not enough fresh lemon ...). Our dessert was a little on the sweet side, but for brunch, the food was definitely a home-run, no wonder these guys won best new restaurant of the year! The ambiance is amazing, the food is exceptional, and the quality of ingredients is top notch, but i have to say i was very disappointed with one thing...We were sat in the rear of the restaurant, and I don't know if it was because we were too tucked-away, or our waiter was having a rough Sunday morning, but it took 10 minutes for us to get any attention from our waiter, and 20 for any menu's. Once a different waiter took our order, and another brought our food out, ANOTHER person asked us how everything and took our dirty plates, which were left at the table for a full 10 minutes after we finished our appetizers.

I ordered the grilled organic chicken waldorf salad with pistachios, fennel, and apple cider dressing. Maybe I'm too 'San Francisco' for this joint, but $22 for a salad of apples and chicken is a waaay expensive. And there's nothing on the menu that hasn't been done a billion times over in any Bay Area bistro. Is organic produce that hard to come by in NYC? Because, it's like I flew 3000 miles to eat SF food and pay twice the price. Bleh.On the bright side, the decor is gorgeous and so thoughtfully executed.

4.0,5/16/2011,"Michael Jackson is a liar!  ABC is not as easy as 1,2,3 or as simple as Do Re Mi.  I saw that ABC won the James Beard for Best New Restaurant and grabbed the first reservations I could get (5:30pm - I should have been given a Senior Citizen Early Bird discount). I skimmed and saw their menu online and had it all plotted out: pork belly and halibut, but they threw me a curve ball.  Citrus was out of season so the pork belly with Meyer lemons was off the menu so I had to call an audible.  I went with the roast carrot salad, roast suckling pig, and carrot cake.  Here is a quick rundown of what everyone ordered and what I tried:- Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli: pretty good - the crab was very fresh- Warm Mozzarella with Olive Oil, Sea Salt & Black Pepper: nothing is better than the simplest of ingredients- Roast Carrot and Avocado Salad, Crunchy Seeds, Sour Cream, and Citrus: the carrots were roasted with a cumin taste - very nice and surprising- Scallop Crudo with Minced Apples and Citrus: probably the best thing I tasted and I was visibly upset that I didn't order it- Suckling Pig: it seemed very dry and not as tasty as other suckling pigs that I have had. I found the green vegetable very stringy and hard to cut- Steamed Halibut, Grilled Fennel, Blood Orange, and Chilies: boring way to cook the halibut and the blood orange sauce was very overpowering- Salmon, Crostini, and Fava Beans: I did not try it, but the person who ordered it felt it was well done- Carrot Cake with Buttercream Frosting: I felt betrayed - carrot cake is my favorite dessert and I didn't love this one.  The candied carrots on top were cute but the cake was dry and it should have been a cream cheese frosting- Salted Caramel Ice Cream, Candied Peanuts & Popcorn, Whipped Cream, and Chocolate Sauce: nice play on sweet and salty with the popcorn- Banana Chip Ice Cream Cake with Candied Walnuts: my mom taught me if you can't say anything good, don't say anything at all.  I liked the candied walnuts part of the dessert- Warm Doughnuts, Vanilla Cream, and Bacon Fudge Sauce: to me, a doughnut has a hole.  This doughnuts were stuffed with vanilla cream with a chocolate dipping sauce and they weren't sweet enough",3,3,2,Hector M.,"Jersey City, NJ",537,513,2227

The first few bites were mind blowing. It was SO good, my brain couldn't really comprehend what was going on. My other two friends both agreed that the pizza was in a class of its own.

But after having lunch here, I just want to say that all those 3 star reviews can shove it because this place is great!  Yes, the decor is a little kitschy, with the recycling theme, but overall I thought the dining area was very rustic, arty, and very beautiful.  The service was spot on with water refills, and bread refills, two people asked how our meal was going and two more people asked if we were enjoying our sundaes.  On top of that, our server came by to notify us that her shift was ending and that a new person would take her place.  Pretty swell, if you ask me.  Okay, now a breakdown of the most important: THE FOODAppetizer: mushroom pizza with farm egg - INCREDIBLE.  This is a must get.  The flavors are perfectly balanced.   The pizza is gooey between the mushroom juices and the farm egg, but it doesn't feel too greasy.  The crust is cooked to perfection.Carrot avocado salad: I will come back here just for this.  Completely amazing, between the soft roasted carrot, creamy avocado, citrus-y dressing, dollop of fatty cream, and nutty seeds.  I will try to make this at home, but I doubt I'll be able to execute it as well.Cheeseburger:  Okay, so a $22 cheeseburger may seem a little steep.   But, it's very very good.  VERY juicy, good flavors, and comes with fries/ (maybe) homemade (?!) ketchup.Smoked Salmon:  I didn't like this as much, but most probably because I don't like dill.  My mom, who loves smoked salmon said it was very good.  Caramel Sundae:  ANOTHER MUST GET.  Talk about exploring every flavor on your tongue.  The caramel was sweet/salty.  The chocolate was sweet/bitter.  The peanuts were salty.  The popcorn added nice texture.  The whipped cream tied everything together.  Total bill for three people: $102 (INCLUDING TAX AND TIP)",4,3,3,Opinionated B.,"New York, NY",117,307,45

While many of these places are memorable and the food very good, even excellent, I do not often return. This is New York after all, and another new restaurant will open for me to venture to next week, and if not, I have my staple hole in the walls to fall back on for my favorite, spicy foods of choice. The exception to this rule is most surely and most uniquely ABC Kitchen. Since it has opened I have been back again, and again, and again. Nothing can keep me away--not the difficulty getting a reservation or the decidedly hipster uniforms of the waiters.

4.0,5/4/2011,"ABC Kitchen has my favorite restaurant interior, so far, in NYC: bleached wood, whitewashed walls, chandeliers, something new and interesting to look at in every corner, and lighting that makes everyone look great. It was this month's dinner club and we started off sharing 3 appetizers: pretzel dusted calamari, chicken liver toast, and asparagus wrapped in prosciutto and cheese (the night's special app). All three were generously portioned, as would be true for all the food that night. The calamari is a must-have. We couldn't really make out any pretzel flavor but it had a wonderfully light and crunchy crust and the mustard aioli was great for dipping. I'm a huge fan of pate and was very happy with the chicken liver toast, which they thoughtfully cut into 4 servings, one for each of us. I am probably equally a fan of asparagus and I was a little disappointed in the special. It was too salty for my taste and I think both the cheese and the prosciutto overwhelmed the flavor of the asparagus. For the main course, I had steamed halibut with grilled fennel, blood orange, and chilies, which was delicious. The fish was perfectly cooked and the combination of the flavors of the fennel and blood orange complemented it. I would have actually liked a bit more of the blood orange sauce on the plate. My fellow diners had the sea bass (also perfectly cooked), the ricotta ravioli, and the bowtie pasta with crisp kasha and veal meatballs. For the two pastas, they ordered the smaller portion, which was more than enough for an entree. I especially loved the sprinkling of the kasha over the one pasta. I will probably steal this idea when I make pasta at home. A few other random tidbits from our visit.... We all found our knives to be very dull. Not a problem with the fish course but I was afraid I would send a piece of asparagus flying across the table. Maybe vintage silverware is not the best idea? The sommelier came to our table and introduced himself when we first sat down, which I thought was a nice touch. And, after our first courses, they cleared and replaced our silverware.

The combination of the delicate and the rough-hewn, uniquely mirroring the offerings of the furniture store, was a treat in itself.- The food, unremarkable. Lentil soup tasted like lentils and kale had been put into a soup. Arctic char melted in my mouth, just like it does everywhere else in the five boroughs. Broccoli and Parmesan were delicious, even though the chef brazenly replaced pine nuts with pistachios in this completely foreseeable and not-exciting twist on an old favorite. Rhubarbs in some kind of sauce for dessert. What can I possibly say about this that you are not already thinking.And  f i n a l l y,- The price, -- $135 for two.

It was the same size, and I was full after just eating that! My atlantic char was very tender and not dry at all. Loved the sauce, and tasted some of the pot roast (which was another choice on the pre-fixe menu). It was also very good if a bit heavier than my dish. I should have ordered the orange creamsicle tart for dessert. It tasted a little like a Chinese dan tat (egg tart), and was delicious! I got the caramel popcorn sundae, which was also delicious, but a tad too sweet for me. Must be getting old...Loved the atmosphere. Very clean, shabby-chic place.

I finally mentioned the temperature (which felt like 90+ degrees) to our server, who agreed that it seemed like the heat was on instead of the AC, and said it had been like that all day. She went to check with a manager, and returned to tell us the the AC was indeed broken. In the meantime, I overheard the couple at the next table complaining about the heat, and a group of gentlemen (who were seated later) immediately struck up a conversation with us about the stifling temperature. Everyone in the dining room looked miserable, especially the servers.I understand that NYC weather can be surprising, especially in the springtime, but it seemed odd that nothing had been done to remedy the problem during the entire holiday brunch service (we arrived at 3:30 in the afternoon). Surely the doors could have been opened (it was at least 15 to 20 degrees cooler outside), or fans could have been set up to give the air some movement. Our server, who looked like she was about to melt, was replaced by someone else halfway through our meal. I could only imagine that our original server had passed out somewhere.We ate quickly and skipped dessert in order to exit the dining room as soon as possible. The two stars are for the food and decor, but overall it was a big disappointment. I understand that technical issues can happen unexpectedly, but it seemed like the management was ignoring the problem rather than trying to find a solution.

3.0,4/21/2011,"One word review: salty.Came here for dinner. It got off to a slow start as we waited close to 20 mins before anyone even asked us if we needed a drink. The waiters/waitresses were all dressed in a laid-back fashion (jeans, plad shirts) which I thought was a refreshing deviation from the usual.Got the diver scallops for appetizer, which were excellent. Lime and apple went really well with the scallops. Friend got the crab toast, which was also good - pretty mild flavor.Also got the cavatelli for appetizer. This was when everything started becoming salty. The guanciale added a nice flavor to the pasta, and I did enjoy it (probably because I was starving)... but it was just too salty.Got the fried chicken for entree. Tasted just like how my mother would make it, which is a good thing. Light and crispy outside, and plump and juicy inside. However, for the mashed potato, I didn't particularly enjoy the gravy - I prefer a rich flavor but this one had a slightly sourness to it. Again, this dish was slightly salty overall.For dessert, ordered banana chip ice cream cake. Their desserts overall seem to be light. However, after a hearty meal, I was craving something heavy.So I can easily recommend their appetizers. However, everything else is just average to good. Considering how difficult they can be with reservations, I don't really think it's worth going back.",2,0,1,E P.,"Honolulu, HI",25,59,0
4.0,4/21/2011,"I've only eaten at this place for lunch, however I will surely be coming back for dinner!From start to finish, the entire experience was amazing. I went with my gf for a lunch date and were seated almost immediately despite the packed restaurant. The decor of the place has a contemporary look with vintage aspects. From the intricate designs on the china, to the flower centerpiece on the table, you get the sense right away how swanky this place is.My gf and I both ordered off the fixed prix lunch menu and we more than satisfied with our selections.  I ordered a pear/apple salad with blue cheese crumbles and candied pecans-absolutely delicious. Very nice contrast of the strong taste of the cheese with the sweet yet complementary taste of the fruits and nuts. For my main course, I was pleased with a very tender cut of pot roast atop a mashed potato bed with a side of greens. The meat was cooked to perfection and the mash was a good consistency, not too thick or runny. For dessert, I finished my meal with a fine selection of cookies. One was a dark chocolate with white chocolate chip morsels, the second was an oatmeal with raspberries, and the last cookie looked to be a slice from a cookie pie-chocolate chip with walnuts. I have a huge sweet tooth and to have ended the meal with a dessert like this put a huge smile on my face. Additionally, before even getting our food choices, we had some toasted bread with olive oil to start. This was also very tasty.I would recommend however when ordering drinks, to not get the smoothie called ""Solar Power."" If I am mistaken with the name, I know for sure that it has protein powder in the drink, and despite this healthy bonus, it tastes like blended grass. Try some of the other smoothies, or better yet, order one of the alcoholic beverages (my date had a margerita which was very good).",1,1,1,Lawrence J.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,7,0

The waiters and waitresses were very nice and helpful, and put up with my Dad's silly and awkward jokes (can you name all of the seven dwarfs?). We ordered a mini whole-wheat pizza for the table which was absolutely delicious, and we finished it in about 5 minutes. It's small, I think 4 slices, so if you're going with a larger group then order more. I don't really remember what everyone else got, but I ordered the french toast with roasted apples and cinnamon and ooey delicious goodness.

It's not exactly elevated a lot from ""regular"" calamari dishes though.Crab toast - This was refreshing and light, and I liked the texture of the toast.Pasta with veal meatballs - The sauce was scrumptious, and I liked how the kasha added a different texture to the dish. The meatballs themselves were fine but not particularly impressive. Apple crumb tart - This was quite delicious. It was not too sweet and the apple flavor was lovely.Chocolate cake - The cake slice also had a crunch element - like pieces of rice krispies or something similar, which I liked.

The calamari had a spicy batter an awesome aoili and marinara. Delicious. We also had the Crab Toast. I would only reccomend getting crabs in this place and this place alone. Fresh and well seasoned. We also had a pizza with mushrooms, fried egg, and i dont even know what else but every bite melted in our mouths.A few whiskeys later we started on round two. I had the Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes. This was no ordinary fried chicken. There were several things about this dish that had me, how you say... happy in pants? The chicken was fried perfectly, with lemon zest on top over a bed of baby bok choi with ginger. The highlight for me was the gravy. I used to refer to Maker's Mark as the nectar of the gods but this gravy was the tastiest and most indesribable thing i have eaten in a long time.

4.0,3/30/2011,"Getting reservations for this place is ridiculous.  It takes a month long.  Lucky for me I got it thru an industry friend.  It actually pays to work like a dog in restaurants.  Anyways..The place is decorated ok, nothing fancy.  However, you definitely know it's a Jean Georges place.  Was it the pretty hosts?  The prettier crowd?  I don't know, but it had an air about it and it smelled like Jean Georges.  When we entered the dining area, it was unusually warm for a restaurant especially in June.  It was as if they were cooling the restaurant with a home air conditioner.  Whatever... I'm here for the food.Since there was four of us (wife and I, friend (his bday) and his girl) we decided to get a bunch of small bites, share some apps and an entree each.  The small bites are categorized as ""Market Table"".  Whatever was fresh at the greenmarket 2 blocks away was served in this section and the rest of the menu.  So here's what we had.ROASTED BEET W/ HOMEMADE YOGURT - really good and the yogurt made it lighter than say a typical goat or blue cheese pairing.HEIRLOOM TOMATO TOAST - JG's interpretation of Pan Con Tomate and it seems like JG speaks Spanish well.CHICKEN LIVER TOAST - This is New York and you gotta have chicken livers.  It was so smooth and flavorful.  It was rich too because you could taste the shmaltz.CRUDITE ANCHOVY DIP - At the time we went, the market was gonna dictate some good veggies so we had to get this.  There was baby carrots, 3 different kinds of beets (all sweet), radishes and other root veg.  Besides the veg, the dip was slamming.  3 out 4 people at our table don't like anchovies, but they loved the dip.FAVA BEAN SALAD - Can't really remember but I know I had it so it was good but not memorable.ZUCCHINI BLOSSOMS - tempura battered, but I wish they were stuffed.APPS:PRESTZEL DUSTED CALAMARI with marinara and mustard aioli was pretty good, but being from new york, calamari has to be really different to be outstanding.  It was cooked well though.  Didn't get an oily feeling from it.ROASTED CARROT AVOCADO SALAD - this is what I consider market cooking.  Taking something so simple and making it absolutely delicious.  Superb.ENTREES:ROASTED SUCKLING PIG -  Me and my friend got this because we are men and from New York.  Awesome pig dish, very refined.  A nice brick of pork with super crispy skin with a cherry jus.  Yeah man!!BLACK SEA BASS with potatoes and spinach - my friend's lady got this, while my wife got STEAMED HALIBUT with shitakes, avocado and asparagus juice.  Both were really good.  I tried them both and loved it.  The fish were cooked so well and the veg for both were so fresh tasting.  As for the desserts, I'll just copy and paste my friend's review.DONUTS - chocolate sauce with butterscotch in the middle - this was so goooood! must have..Chocolate Ganache - brown butter, hazelnut crunch tart - excellentChocolate Cake - was good but i would say amazingRhubard Pie - this was great!! another item where because its so fresh, it was amazing.Overall, I loved it.  Another Jean Georges experience done right.  Going in a group of four is definitely the way to go.  You get to tatse a little bit of everything that way.  For the whole meal, with a bottle of wine and 6 cocktails really wasn't expensive.  I swear.  Take your girl and 2 friends and have a great time.",1,1,1,Mike S.,"New York, NY",29,42,0

It's a hip/green atmosphere where they plate your food on Patagonia serve-ware created by the indigenous natives of Chile and Argentina. My husband and I were seated at a cool bar-like table for two. While a few bigger tables can be found in the back room, definitely make reservations if you have more than two in your party. My husband and I waited about 25 minutes for a table which isn't all that bad in NYC at 7 PM. There is a nice waiting area next to the bar with pretzel snacks to hold you over until they can square you a spot. We found two great seats at the long bar table that pull up to the big front window; perfect for people watching and chatting. Also, the drinks are thoughtfully made. My scotch and water lasted 30 minutes (strong!). More than enough to last me until we were sat. One of the best surprises is that ABC's menu allows you to go light or go heavy depending on your appetite (or your goal if you are fearing bathing-suit season as much as I am). This is perfect because my husband doesn't ""diet"". He eats whatever he wants and nothing about him changes. I must be made from a few different ingredients, because I'm 5'3"" and therefore have to watch it. The ABC salads help with this. They are filling and healthy, but I promise you won't forgo taste or inventiveness for trying to go ""light"".

The food was very good and the calamari was a really good start. Great little spot to have a really good meal.,0,0,0,Julie B.,"Orinda, CA",4,89,0

4.0,2/24/2011,"I think I found one of the best salads in NYC, their grilled chicken Waldorf. Salads in the city are not as good as in Cali, where everything is fresh. But this salad was crisp, light, healthy and the chicken very tender. There is a heaping pile of shredded apples to keep the doctor away.I had the 24 Karat juice with beets and this funky green algae floating on top, very good. I split a wheat tomato, basil, mozzarella pizza - which was just OK (not their strongest dish). We looked around at other tables and everything looked so delicious!This is definitely going to be one of my favorite lunch places --it's a beautiful space and everything is organic!

3.0,2/21/2011,"ABC Kitchen is like a secluded haven in the middle of a busy city where sidewalks are littered with soda cans and hot dog wrappers. Jean-Georges' newest restaurant draws its ingredients from local, organic sources, preparing food that rivals in freshness food that is cooked at home.The restaurant is nestled in an alley and is hard to spot unless you're looking for it. The door frame is white and a small banner outside reads ""ABC Kitchen"" in faint letters. Despite the name, one would think that ABC Kitchen was a furniture store. The dainty white chairs screams for attention, juxtaposed against wooden floors and the wooden beams that seem to prevent the restaurant from collapsing on itself. The lighting casts an ambient glow on the dinner table, and mysterious paintings on the wall captivates the eyes for a time.The food follows suit, artfully crafted to draw oohs and ahhs. The bread is plain, but soft and chewy nonetheless. A wooden bowl emphasizes the rustic taste of the bread and compliments the décor in the restaurant. After the bread came a plate of Peekytoe crab toast. Although the toast seemed to be derived from the same bread served before, the Peekytoe crab toast provided a whole new experience. The outside of the toast was rough and crunchy, but chomping down on the toast shattered the toasted exterior into a warm, creamy mess. The next appetizer swooped in like a celebrity, elegant yet ostentatious. Prior to eating at ABC Kitchen, I had done some research on the restaurant, and the mackerel sashimi marinated in ginger and mint was the dish I had to try. Oval shaped slices of mackerel formed a star on a large plate. A puddle of orange liquid added vibrant colors to the dish, supplementing the light pink color of the mackerel. There were tiny bubbles, many of them, that crowded near the surface of the mackerel. Inside my mouth, the mackerel succumbed to my teeth like butter rapidly melting in a pan. Dishes like the mackerel sashimi define ""Upscale Healthy."" The final appetizer--my mom and I ordered three appetizers but only one entrée--was an intricately designed salad. A few long, roasted carrots intertwined with quartered slices of avocado. The flavor of the carrots and avocado was so robust that I ended up eating slices of carrot and avocado with some bread to damper the taste of the former a bit. On top of these giants was a mix of greens that looked like a bush straight out of a foreign jungle. A generous amount of pine nuts embellished the dish to perfection, and amongst the soft avocado and roasted carrots, the pine nuts provided a much-needed new dimension to the salad. ABC Kitchen's spinach, goat cheese, and whole wheat pizza is quite possibly the most healthy pizza I've eaten. From the name of the pizza alone, one could deduce that the pizza would be quite healthy. The dough on the pizza was so thin that the toppings were twice thicker than the base. The crust was also nicely charred. In fact, a chef who was dining next to me called the crust ""beautiful."" If the chef of a French bistro in New York City calls a crust ""beautiful,"" the crust surely must be a work of art. The same chef also let me take a picture of his pizza, so for your viewing pleasure, here is the morels, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza. The chef actually offered me a slice to taste since ""that's what being a foodie is all about,"" but I kindly refused. Reflecting back, I wish I had tried the pizza.If you like this, read more of my food writing at toastable.com!",1,1,2,Earl L.,"Washington, DC",27,51,4
2.0,2/20/2011,We went here for dinner on a Saturday night.  People were already lined up out the door.  They fit us in informing us that we had to be out by 7:30 which gave us an hour and a half.  Plenty of time.  The service was decent.  The best part of the meal was the crab toast.  The soup was mediocre and the fried calamari was like fried calamari anywhere else.  My pasta entree was so under seasoned I feel like there was no salt at all.  A rare complaint because I'm pretty sensitive to salt.  The scallops were okay and dessert was mediocre.  C'mon JG is this what you have to offer? Even if it is casual we still got a hefty bill and left wondering what all the hype was about.  I'm tired of people wasting time listing what farms things are from rather than caring if the food is good.,0,0,0,G.

We also ordered the striped bass with russet potatoes but neither of us liked it at all -- I couldn't even stomach it actually, way too fishy.

I must admit, I am more impressed by their concept than their food. They recommended the burger but I found the jalapenos to be too overpowering- I could not even taste the meat. There was also a special, the truffle pizza, and it was all cheese- even too cheesy for someone who loves cheese. However, there are quite a few great items worth mentioning. Their pana cotta is absolutely delicious. You can taste the purity of the cream. It's light and fluffy, unlike most panna cottas I've tried, and not too sweet. The mushroom pizza with farm egg is great to try as well.

5.0,2/6/2011,"I've had the pleasure of dining at ABC Kitchen twice, for lunch and dinner, and it proved to be a nearly flawless dining experience in every regard. For a celebratory Sunday lunch, a friend and I made a reservation a *month* in advance, and this evening my visiting parents and I luckily snagged a table without a rez for an early dinner (6 PM). (Never fear, walk-ins can eat at the bar if space isn't available.)Why is ABC Kitchen one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at -- ever? Let's start with decor. As the food here is local, wholesome and fresh, so too is the space. Clean design: white on white -- walls, tables, decorative touches -- aside from the dark rustic ceiling beams invoking humble country barns. Very nice. This philosphy continues with the servers' uniforms of neutral-colored plaid shirts. It could be pretentious but isn't, thankfully.Speaking of the waitstaff, service was on-point completely. Neither time did I have to wait for anything. Informative, polite, extremely well-trained. Excellent, excellent. They are also quite good-looking. :)But why ABC Kitchen really shines is the food. In a word, it is spectacular! The ingredients are locally sourced and very fresh. Nothing is overly sauced, spiced or saccharine, yet still manages to blast fireworks in your mouth. The quality of all the dishes is very high and the way even simple vegetables are prepared is really innovative. (Roasting carrots with lemon, coconut water and lime, for example.) The lunch and dinner menus are very similar. Brunch options are fairly limited but I'm sure quite good based on how great everything else has been.First of all, you absolutely must have the roasted kabocha squash toast to start!! It's a crostini of Sullivan Street Bakery bread with a thin layer of light ricotta cheese and the dynamic combo of sweet squash with carmelized onions tempered by apple cider vinegar. OH MY GOD. The carrot avocodo salad is also delicious! The carrots are roasted with thyme, cumin and chili pepper flakes, though it's not overly spicy, and is cooled by the slices of avocado. Very yummy.I've also tried their whole wheat pizzas, which are personal sized: I definitely recommend the mushroom pizza, which is topped with an egg, but only if you really love mushrooms. The best word for it is succulent, which I never thought that's how I'd describe a pizza but that's how great this place is. Their spinach and goat cheese pizza is also quite good, I recall that it's topped with dill and other herbs, but I prefered the mushroom pizza.At dinner, my parents and I ordered three different fish dishes; the portion sizes were fair, not monstrous, and very filling. We had the bass, the arctic char and the cod. I'd have to say that despite that they were all prepared very well, the cod was just ok and my favorite was the bass. Even so, they were all delicious. The cod was panko-encrusted and sat on a bed of mushrooms and fine slices of jalapeno. The arctic char was the most fun, it was placed on a carrot puree that was so good we mopped it up with the remaining table bread as a dip! The bass was served with spinach and slices of red potatoes in a lemony broth. Of course we had to get dessert. It might be seasonal, but if it's offered, go with the pear bread pudding. Translucent slices of pear chips layer a scoop of buttercream ice cream on top of the dense bread pudding along with bits of roasted pear. Mmm! I can also attest to the sorbets and ice creams, especially their rich chocolate. All in all, I adore this place and so has everyone I've been here with. If you can get a reservation you should definitely eat at ABC Kitchen.",7,0,6,Rita E.,"Brooklyn, NY",60,171,12
5.0,2/3/2011,"So glad I didn't Google before going.Been hearing buzz about ABC Kitchen for a while but I'm trying this new method of dining where 1. do zero research and 2. entrust my evening to the staff's hands. ABC Kitchen absolutely delivered. Don't get it twisted, there were lows but the highs definitively out shined them and I left HAPPY (CAPs was necessary.)This could possibly be my favorite in the city.The end of short version. Detailed long version.With the help of our server Anne Marie, we enjoyed:- crab toast with lemon aioli- fluke sashimi with caviar on toast- sweet shrimp (amaebi) and something- mozzarella, cranberries, arugula salad- scallops with cabbage and apple cider vinegar- fried chicken with collard greens and mashed potatoes - broccoli piracicaba (raab), bacon and something spaghetti- brussels sprouts with mustard vinaigrette - broccoli, pistachios and something else- doughnuts with bacon chocolate sauce- salted caramel ice cream with candied peanuts, popcorn and chocolate sauce- pear bread pudding with pear ice cream and caramel sauce- chocolate cake with ganache and marshmallow ice cream Lows: maybe I don't get it but as exquisite as the interior is, parts of the decor are imbalanced i.e. hideous mis-matching bread plates, dining room staff uniforms (plaid shirts and such) among a few other things just seemed out of place. Blood orange bellini was blah. The bartenders didn't have the same hospitable vibe as the rest of the staff. Some of the dishes were a touch salty for my palateHighs: knowledgeable, unpretentious staff. Our server Anne Marie and the back waiter Billy, specifically. As Billy was bussing some plates, I asked him what an ingredient on the dish was and he answered without missing a beat - that blew me away. The entire staff understands timing - a rarity. The details, omg it's all about the little things. I love how they use TOTO toilets. I've never seen such perfect lighting. Awesome cutlery -- that knife is off the hook. Every plate aside from the bread plate I want in my home. The coffee mugs.

5.0,2/2/2011,"You know what's a great (and terrible) idea? Going to dinner with someone who works in the food/service industry - inevitably, you will both wind up really fat and drunk because that's just how they do things. Case in point: a recent excursion to ABC Kitchen, a last minute reservation made to placate my disgruntled friend since I'd canceled ours at Maialino due to the impending inclement weather (which turned out to be not nearly as awful as expected). He showed up at the bar and groused, ""Hey, I heard this place has really great roast pig and pastas...oh, wait, this isn't Maialino."" But he was kidding, since we had both expressed interest in trying this well-reviewed restaurant out. I'd been only once, having a drink at the bar before meeting others at another nearby place to eat.A woman perched beside me at the bar and said I looked like a doll. She kept marveling over my face, and shit, that was pretty sweet. I was, obviously, flattered. But relieved when the hostess came over to escort me and Grumpy to our table because it's always awkward when people call attention to your appearance.Seated ""away from the riffraff"" as Grumpy muttered, we were tucked into a neat little table for two beneath exposed beams and beside a tree festooned with lights. Or maybe it just looked that way after one Ketel & soda and three perfect Manhattans. I have never had a Manhattan so smooth - and the drunken cherries were a lovely touch.The two of us perused the menu and went with:- fluke sashimi & caviar on buttered toast. Oh, what a lovely way to start: bright, fresh, and my only complaint was that it would have fared even better with a kick of something acidic.- pretzel battered calamari. Grumpy said ""I don't taste the pretzel"" but I told him, ""Use the mustard sauce"" and hey, that really enhanced the pretzel flavor. Not enough tentacles though - I know, who complains about that?- chicken liver mousse on toast. Was that a lovely tang of red wine vinegar running through the creamy spread?- mushroom, egg & parmesan pizza. Not really the best pizza ever, but still, a well executed and delicious one (despite much of the beloved egg yolk having dripped through the pizza tray onto the plate), effusively topped with maitake and enoki mushrooms. Enoki! I love those little guys.- brussels sprouts & pancetta in mustard dressing. Man, how did I grow up as a kid who hated brussels sprouts? I eat these babies like candy now. The version here is outstanding, but hey, Brussels sprouts can never be bad (unless they are boiled). - roasted veal shank, parsnip puree & i don't remember what else because i was so excited to dig all the marrow out of the bone. At this point, Grumpy and I looked at one another and said, ""Uh, this is way too much food."" Our server, who was helpful and came around frequently to check on us, replied, ""I didn't want to burst your bubble because you guys seemed so excited to order."" We had almost ordered a second entree but I deferred to better judgment (I am so smart! I am so smart! S M R T!) and am still relieved.We were sad to leave most of the entree but there was just no way either of us could finish. I mean, there was still a good three bites of marrow still hanging out there, having been excavated by my trusty knife. Alas. We'll have to return.Damage (aside from liver & brain, thanks to all the booze): I don't remember precisely because I was rather drunk buttwo market plates: around 25$ totalchicken liver toast: 10$ perhaps?pizza: 16$ mayberoast lamb shank: 35$ or so? maybe lessside of Brussels sprouts: 8$ areaa shit ton of booze: NO DIGNITY.

4.0,1/21/2011,"One month after moving to Los Angeles, New York Magazine cruelly published an entire issue dedicated to the future of vegetables. Fortunately, I'd already booked my friend's sofa for a return flight back East! I had to pull strings to secure a 8:00pm Saturday night reservation with just a few days notice... not that I actually know important people, but I do know their personal assistants!There was no question that the Roasted Kabocha Squash Toast with fresh ricotta and apple cider vinegar ($10) yelp.com/biz_photos/dMhR… would be the very first dish I ordered. According to all the press outlets that matter, it's a top vegivore dish at ABC. Was it life changing?! Well, no... but imagine silky kabocha slivers lying in a bed of ricotta and crackling whole grain bread with a sprinkle of rooftop basil leaves. It may not change your life, but it will give you a solid 10 minute foodie high.The tempura fried kabocha rings --because one can never have too much winter squash--appeared next, flecked with ribbons of aged goat cheese. The Crispy Delicata Squash with maple syrup and grated goat cheese ($13) yelp.com/biz_photos/dMhR… was a surprise favorite. Admittedly, I accidently ordered it, thinking it was the roasted kabocha squash dish championed by the critics.Without consulting me, my dear Dani ordered the Roasted Portabellos with Celery Leaves ($9). yelp.com/biz_photos/dMhR… I might have let her order it, but she often forgets that I hate mushrooms. Since they're a favorite of her's and her vegetarian fiancé, she frequently orders them by default as a ""vegetarian friendly"" dish. I understand that some people can't conceive of a vegetarian disliking mushrooms... just like I can't conceive of people not loving rainbows and puppies and vegan cashew cheese. But since these vegetables are reportedly at their transcendental pinnacle, I put on a brave face and forced a slice of my fungal nemesis through pursed lips. Then I did it again... because, by golly, this was a delicious mushroom! It lacks the pungent flavor of soil, enticing eaters with a mild musk--its collar of spore releasing gills adorned with a confetti of celery leaves.My seafood loving Beau laments that I can't share an occasional bisque with him--or perhaps he's happy my wondering spoon stays out of his bowl. Nonetheless, the dairy-free Cauliflower Soup with Rye Croutons and Rupert Cheese ($11) yelp.com/biz_photos/dMhR… may be the solution. This thick creamy soup came with high accolades from my dinner date, Jess, so we ordered two bowls for the table. It's unfair to say how ambivalent I felt about this dish since, for some bizarre reason, it was served at the end of the meal. With our bellies already beyond full, eating the soup was like force feeding a sleeping kitten- it wants to eat... but... can't... The thought of ordering a dessert at this point seemed absolutely revolting, so I left the choice up to Dani. She selected Malted Milk Chocolate Ice Cream ($6) yelp.com/biz_photos/dMhR… and Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Buttercream ($8). yelp.com/biz_photos/dMhR… Though I protested, I ate my fair share of both! The ice cream was as thick as concrete with a hint of ice crystals. Beneath the dense chocolate flavor, I could hardly detect any malt. Then again, I like to eat malt powder straight out of the jar, so my taste might be a bit skewed. The moist carrot cake, meanwhile, clung to our forks, as the creamy frosting beckoned us back for more.Despite the big ticket atmosphere, the approach to food is similar to other locavore restaurants like Eat. But here, high prices translate into perfectly executed haute flavor experiments. Young chef Dan Kluger (from the tutelage of Danny Meyer) provides a thrilling journey for those of use who've been eating vegetables for years--and can take on self-proclaimed carnivores too!

2.0,1/19/2011,"From the 30min post-reservation wait to the waiter trying to give the food of the table next to us to us - then immediately picking it up from under our noses and giving it to them, while they watched - to the weak atmosphere, mediocre-at-best food and general cynicism of the whole operation, I can say I haven't been to a more disappointing restaurant in the last two years. Kind of like eating in Jean-Georges At A Gym.  If this were a cheap restaurant, say, an Applebee's, or even a neighborhood bistro, some of this could be forgiven.  But it's not and it cannot.  This place is every bad ""locavore"" trend gone bad, coupled with a blisteringly loud room and a FOH crew that clearly doesn't give a damn.  To use the word again, ""cynical"" is the best descriptor of a place that is trying to capitalize on a conceptually honest trend without any generosity or decency.  Portions are small, the menu is deceptively designed to force you to order more (subcategories for ""market table,"" ""pasta"" and ""pizza"" in addition to the normal ""appetizers"" and ""entrees""), and most of it is about as good as a mid-upper tier Brooklyn restaurant (which would be fine, were it at their prices and level of comfort).  Save the (considerable) money you will spend here and put it down at an actual quality restaurant like Eleven Madison Park, Marea or Gramercy Tavern (all of whom this place competes with on price) or stick to your local bistro.  Total waste of time.",4,0,0,Jonas B.,"Brooklyn, NY",257,92,3

Not only do I have to wait outside til my reservation, but then I have to wait until the people without reservations get their name down?  Ugh, awful service.Luckily the food made up for the horrendous service.  The atmosphere itself is very countryhouse chic - all white furniture.  I got the local drink - cucumber, beet, carrot, local bee pollen and ginger.  It was delicious!  Had a strong ginger aftertaste, but could definitely taste the carrot/beets.  Was really different and healthy but also tasted great.  I tried the lentil soup which was good, but not mind blowing.  My friend had the calamari which he seemed to like.  We shared the goat cheese/spinach pizza which was truly amazing.  The roasted carrot/avocado salad was also quite good.  Portions were pretty good.  Unfortunately they brougnt out our salad after the pizza - again, awful service.  There isn't one particular waiter/waitress, just random people are going around refilling water, bringing stuff to your table, etc.  Also the waiters are all very hipster - LOTS of plaid and interesting hairstyles.Food was delish and worth going for!",2,0,0,Neha S.,"New York, NY",56,308,0

So true - It does feel like my [non-existent] vacation home.The space is best understood by going in person - beautiful lighting, a motley assembly of country chic furniture and pieces of grandma's chipped china thrown in for good measure - it all creates a mini cloud of luxury within the not so glamorous Flatiron/Union Square area.  Tapping the ABC Carpet & Home inventory, Kitchen uses sustainable, handcrafted pieces by local artisans as well as the indigenous Mapuche people of Patagonia.  The waitstaff, in their oh-so-cute plaid shirts, are perky and fresh faced... I swear, straight out of a Neutrogena commercial.As for the food...mmehhhh.  I shared a plate of Cured Meats and Local Cheeses ($17) with the table and then had a bowl of homemade yogurt with dates and granola.  Nothing was ""spectacular"" but certainly fresh in taste and well presented.  I attribute my lack luster reaction to poor ordering (bad M!) - their Housemade Ricotta Ravioli ($22) and the Spinach, Goat Cheese and Herb Pizza ($14) both look/smell incredible!  Their coffee, I must note, was outstanding and came in amazing pieces of pottery that practically molded into your hand.  Given the quality of the ingredients, prices were quite reasonable.I believe in second chances and plan to head back to ABC Kitchen for Part Deux (Dinner & Drinks)... that is, if I can ever get a reservation.Leave a Comment",3,1,1,Maggie A.,"Manhattan, NY",17,82,0

Only a 20 minute wait without a reservation at a busy time of year and we were able to sit for a glass of wine while we waited. Such an adorable restaurant. On first entering, I would describe it as a fairly fancy, 'lady-lunch' restaurant, but it was pretty cozy & relaxed. I loved the non-shabby shabby chic decor & serve-ware!I was easily convinced to go for the prix fixe lunch, I started with the roasted kabocha squash toast which was super delicious; sweet with a gorgeous bite to the ricotta & vinegar. Followed with the portabello sandwich which had a tasty lemon mayo dressing and jalapeno peppers for a little kick. I definitely wasn't too impressed by my glorified veggie burger, but the fries were pretty incredible. Super crispy & not too greasy with homemade tomato ketchup - yum!We split the salted caramel ice cream sundae for dessert and were both done after about two bites.

Book at least a week ahead for a table because the reservation times in opentable run out really quickly!Ordering the crab toast was a no brainer after reading all the hype over it on yelp. And this delectable appetizer was certainly worth the hype!!! I'm a big fan of seafood so I really appreciated the fresh taste of the crab. The crab is delicately garnished so as to enhance its flavor and the addition of crunchy toast makes this little genius a sure winner :) We only ordered the crab toast but I will definitely return to try the squash/white bean versions. For the entree I had the portabello sandwich which was good but it didn't blow my mind. Now to the important finale: the. salted. caramel. ice-cream. sundae. The finishing creation with popcorn and peanut sprinkles makes it a bowl of sweet creamy deliciousness. But I felt that the ice cream was simply amazing by itself. The portion is huge (bowl almost the size of my head) but I could easily finish the whole thing myself (but this is coming from a girl who can eat ice cream for dinner....). When I ordered it, my friend was pretty full and said she would take a bite or two (yeah right, this NEVER happens haha).

All of them.I love the clean yet comforting decor too, but that was all but guaranteed seeing as ABC is involved and they know decor. *Side Note: The fried organic chicken (sounds like an oxymoron huh?) comes with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy. While the potatoes are delightful, notice the gravy. It is BBQ sauce gravy. You read that right. BBQ SAUCE GRAVY. How did it take this long for someone to combine the two!?!?!?",2,1,2,Sam B.,"Boulder, CO",30,122,2
5.0,11/19/2010,"I've been looking forward to this meal at the newest Jean-George restaurant for weeks. Teamed up with ABC Carpet and Home, this environmentally-conscious concept uses organic, local and sustainable goods and is committed to growing whatever they can in the rooftop garden, using recycled products and supporting local artisans.         I walked in through the rustic doors to a modern, magical, snow-kingdom fairytale.  A vast space with a loft-like feel to it, high ceilings, exposed beams, and silver and white everywhere. Crisp simplicity. What an absolutely lovely setting! Natural tables with leaf-covered chandeliers, tiny mismatched antique bread plates and glass cube vases with miniature flower arrangements. This may be the perfect combination of minimalist and elegant. So hip, but something so timeless about it. It looks exactly the way the exquisite food tastes. When we realized there were WAY too many mouth-watering options to choose from on this beautifully written menu, my two girlfriends and I decided to order a bunch of small plates to share. We asked the waiter what the most outstanding plates were and ordered pretty much everything he suggested. It really sounded like we were overdoing it, especially for 3 petite ladies, but we managed to cleaned our plates with no problem.From top to bottom the dishes are as follows: The fresh crab toast was a hit with all of us. Flaked pieces of crab simply dressed on crunchy sourdough.A salad made from julienned pear, endive, candied pecans and some of the best bleu cheese I've ever had was impeccable.  This would be a great summer dish- not too filling but full of flavor and textures. I will definitely be trying to replicate this at home. This was my favorite dish: Arugula with homemade mozzarella, figs and balsamic. So incredibly simple, but it totally showcased what a few top notch ingredients can do together. Nothing overpowered the other, just complemented the distinct flavors of each component. The figs, as they are when they're in season (but wait, isn't this actually pretty late for them? How did they get such good ones?) were so velvety, sweet, and succulent that I wanted to marry them...or at least eat about a million more. The cheese was....just wow. I don't even have words for how good it was. Melty, soft in the middle with a slight pull to the outside layer. Seriously the kind of food I'd like to eat every day.The pizza was the only dish that we didn't think was noteworthy. The crust was slightly soggy except for the crunchy edges. It was a little too salty overall, and the fried egg- that was supposed to be on top judging from other blogger's photos, was undetectable. We actually think they might have forgotten it altogether. The mushrooms however, were superb- and although one friend felt there were way too many of them, I am a funghi-phile and loved them.The bruschetta with butternut squash, ricotta and mint was an autumnal delight. This was the collective favorite dish of the day. The squash took on a caramelization that could have earned this dish a spot on the dessert menu. Again, the quality of the cheese here proved itself again with sweet, creamy goodness.The pretzel dusted calamari was also delicious. Given the creativity of the rest of the menu, I felt that the dipping sauces- though excellent for marinara sauce and mustard, were a bit on the boring side.We were so full at the end of our many courses that when the waiter asked if we'd like dessert, we explained that although we really DID find the dessert menu appealing and tempting, we were just too full to attempt it. At that point, I gave him my blog business card and told him that I'd be writing a fantastic review of my new favorite restaurant. He must have taken that as a cue to make sure it held it's new top spot because the next thing we knew, he reappeared with two comped desserts for us to try. Wow. Niiiiiiiice. Even cooler was the fact that they were the two we'd been eyeing- maybe he overheard us debating whether or not we should order either. The first was the pumpkin spice cake with maple cream cheese frosting. To be honest, I wasn't crazy about this one, it wasn't particularly pumpkin-y and I actually though the spices were too strong. I do realize that my about-to-burst stomach might be too blame here though...However, I DID find PLENTY of room for the  salted caramel ice cream sundae. It was topped with fresh whipped cream, candied peanuts and popcorn and some of the best hot fudge I've ever had. Where there's a will there's a way. I can't WAIT to go back !",0,0,0,Carey Y.,"Sarasota, FL",407,338,3
4.0,11/17/2010,"Walked in on a rainy Tuesday night without a reservation.  At first the hostess informed us we could either eat at the bar, which i saw all the seats were already full or wait 30 min for a cocktail table.  We decided to try a bottle of wine from Spain, ""Goga"" at the bar recommended by the bartender and a a not too sweet concord grape soda. The wine was full bodied and comforting and the helpful bartender suggested it would go well with the lamb and burger.  Within 20min, the hostess said our table was ready and we bypass the cocktail tables and go through into the restaurant pass a few empty tables.  I guess they are told to tell patrons without reservations to eat at the bar/cocktail area but there was plenty of seating at 9pm this particular night.The ambiance was really cute with modern looking light fixtures and cocktail tables made from slices of petrified wood. The bar and table were simplistic and unremarkable. the noise level was fine, we had easily heard conversations with straining at the bar as well as the dining area.We started with  the yummy roasted squash toast with ricotta.  I REALLY should've skipped the chewey bread, but the olive oil was decent and i was hungry. we also split a half portion of bowtie pasta with lemon zest and veal meatballs.  This could've been my full meal b/c even halfing that, making it a quarter order i was content and althought the meatballs were average, the sauce and pasta was perfect.My cheeseburger was extrememly fresh tasting, orginal with the jalapenos mayo/aoili and was moist with perhaps a little too much of the shaved cheese on top for my preference.  The frieds were crispy and loved the rosemary/thyme but too salty!My dinner companion seemed to thoroughly enjoy his lamb with parsnip puree although i don't like like lamb and felt that this was particularly ""lamby"".We were too stuffed and happy with our experience for dessert but on a prior experience i tried the salted caramel corn ice cream and enjoyed it immensely.

Anyways, so pretty and great place to come for dinner. I guess it is the new hot spot because when we can at the opening of dinner, we were told that we would need to wait so the hostess could give us options. At this point, the restaurant had just opened its doors for dinner that night...it was still empty. Anyways, we just sat at the bar tables. Now to the food....we started with the roasted carrots and avocado salad. I AM DREAMING OF THESE CARROTS. They were so good and tender and just the perfect amount of spice and heat and goodness. I know I am blabbing now but OMG. We then had the bowtie pasta with meatballs and they were good but they had nothing on the carrots. Then came the fried chicken with collard greens and mashed potatoes. The collard greens had some kick to it which was nice. I don't even want to know how much butter and cream that went into the potatoes but they were so good. The chicken was crunchy and fried perfectly. If you know me at all, you would know I LOVE LOVE meat but after having the carrots, I couldn't stop thinking about them. They were better than the chicken.",1,1,1,Eve C.,"Manhattan, NY",355,876,1124

So to start, the bread is amazing so try not to fill up on it before your meal arrives.  we ordered the spinage whole wheat pizza, was delish, 4 larger peices, lots of spin and perf amount of cheese. not too oily or anything at all. Fiance got the burger, it was heavenly. cooked to perfection, so juicy, and the sauce on it was so good, totally different. i just couldn't stop taking bites pf ot.  the friees were good also, again not oily at all, and crispy.  i kept eating his burger bc unfortunately my meal sucked! i got the crispy cod w mushrooms. it was SO bland, and it had this crispiness to it, it felt fried.  it wasn't oily, it was just a heavy cripsy crust on such a delecate peice of fish, it didn't go at all. it woud've been good if the dish had some taste to it. it was so bland and the musrooms were just blah. i didnt like it at all.  the service was wonderful, very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable.  when our waitress saw that i hardly touched my meal and we split the burger (whcih was fine bc the pizza was bigger than we anticipated so we were kinda full anyway) she asked me what was wrong and i told her. she said she would let the chef know, she sounded genuine, and actually cared that i didnt like my meal.  i thought it was great and i wish more restaurants cared about their diners' opinons.  we ordered dessert, the pumpkin w this delish cream cheese frosting. it had the perf amt of frosting and constrated very well with the pumpkin.  plate was scattered w pumpkin seeds too.  i had also mentioned it was our anniversary on my open table resi, and the waitress brought out cupcakes w. a ""happy anniversary"" written beautifully on the plate.  was so nice of her! we were so full at that piont, but it was such a nice thought. bottom line is the space is gorg, service was aweome, and 3 out of the 4 things we ordered were extremely well executed. woudl def go back, and def not order the cod.",0,0,0,Andrea M.,"New York, NY",3,36,13

2.0,11/7/2010,"Came here with 2 friends on the blind recommendation that ABC Kitchen had a wonderful reputation and was supposedly amazing. It was Halloween Eve, so one friend was dressed in a Jets costume, and I in a Stepford Wife get up.The place is decorated like my dream - very Anthropologie-esque, classic baroque, deconstructed. I absolutely loved the style. What I didn't like was being sat at the high tops by the bar that felt super unsturdy and like cheap plastic patio furniture on stilts. Don't worry, thats not the only thing I didn't like.ABC Kitchen is all about fresh local organic everything, down to the beers. Wonderful. Great. (If you're into all that). I also feel our server was all about attitude, judgement and making an art out of not serving. Actually, the girl who was helping to bus was more friendly and engaging than our actual server, who barely looked at us and who had to be flagged down with immense effort to even put an order in. Once we did order, and I guess he realized we were spending money there, he began to do his job slightly better, but that really wasn't saying much at all.Food. We split the calamari to start, which was super salty and paired with a super salty mustard dipping sauce and a very bland marinara. It was only until the last few bites that I cracked the code and mixed the bland with the salty to make acceptable to be washed down with my Lime Basil mojito. I have to say one positive thing - the Lime Basil mojito was great. Fresh, interesting, tasty, and strong. We also had a fresh mozzarella and fig salad - the mozzarella was tasteless and nothing special. We were not a fan of the figs in combination with the mozzarella. Disappointing.The entrees - which took forever to come out - were not particularly fantastic either. This was probably amplified by the pretentious air circulating around the restaurant and the attitude the server was giving us. At least for cripes sake have some foodgasm worthy dishes to make me think there is something to substantiate the attitude. I had the Sea Bass with potatoes and spinach. While continuing a conversation, I was emptying a whole shaker of salt and pepper into the dish to possibly shock some life into the otherwise bland and runny dish. I'm sorry folks. Sadly, it was DOA. Very bland. Very disappointing. My friend had the Kasha and Bowtie pasta with Veal Meatballs, which was mediocre, but a bit on the salty side for the meatballs. Also somewhat disappointing. My other dinnermate opted for one of the pizzas which looked very dry and she was not amused at all.Naturally, we continued to down the drinks, which were honestly the best part of our meal, and opted out of staying for dessert.Bottom line? Super cute space. Super uncute attitude. Super bland and unimpressive dishes for the price and attitude we had to endure. Do not recommend, unless pretentiousness is your schtick. This review is now bland in itself, because there is no other word to adequately describe the banality of the food. That is untrue. There surely are, but the food was so ____ that I do not find it worth reaching into my vocabulary repertoire to describe it anymore.",3,3,2,Olivia V.,"New York, NY",123,169,29

3.0,11/3/2010,"Ate lunch here and sat at the counter. Started with the banana boat smoothie, which was very tasty. It had walnuts, chocolate and bananas, and tasted like dessert in an organic drink. The only complaint is that the smoothie should be thicker.I started with the chicken liver toast. The toast had a nice crunch and it was not too hard. The liver was creamy and had a great flavor and was the highlight of the meal. The fluke sashimi came with concord grapes and green chilies on top. The grapes were sour and the fluke was a little chewy. The chilies were not spicy, and the fluke needed salt to make it taste better.The cod with mushrooms was ok. The cod was flaky, and had a good crust, the chilies had a little heat, and the mushrooms were good but overall it did not wow me.The Akaushi cheeseburger was overcooked when it was delivered to me. I ordered it medium rare and it came back medium well, so I returned it to the kitchen (which is probably a bad idea in most restaurants). When the burger came back, it was cooked medium so I just ate it. The meat was chewy with an almost stringy quality, and the green chilies on top were nice. The bread was a sesame burger bun, the fries were crunchy and well seasoned, and the mix of fried parsley & rosemary added nice flavor to the fries. Overall the burger was ok, not great, and not worth $21.For dessert I tried the grape and almond tart, which was light. The crust was not too thick or sugary, but the tart only had a thin layer of grapes. It would have been nice to have more grapes.The restaurant is connected to ABC Carpet and Home and the menu tells you where everything comes from.

4.0,10/25/2010,"I think part of the hype here is the very Anthropologie looking decor and general atmosphere.  Soft lighting and driftwood tables can make anyone swoon, especially this girl.  I left ABC Kitchen feeling satisfied but a little disappointed-- I think we ordered all the wrong things.  Everyone in my 4 person party agreed to share a few appetizers and some pizza, which I was quietly against.  I agreed mostly because I didn't want to look greedy or like a food snob, even though I knew I'd regret not saying something.  We drank a pinot noir from Willamette Valley throughout the meal, which everyone seemed to enjoy.  From the market table portion of the menu we ordered the roasted kabocha squash toast, calamari, figs and bufala mozzarella, beets with homemade yogurt, and the crispy delicata squash.  After that we tried the spinach and goat cheese pizza as well as the mushroom and parmesan pizza.  The standout of the apps was definitely the delicata squash, which we totally forgot we ordered and took the duration of the meal to figure out what it was.  Flaky, soft on the inside with a sweet and salty topping, I only wish they had given us a bigger portion.  The beets were also really delicious and the bufala was at the perfect temperature and not oozing liquid everywhere.  The calamari was good but nothing special.  When I think of something coated in pretzels, I immediately think of the menu at a TGI Fridays so it seemed a little out of place here.  The pizzas were good, the crust was chewy and pleasant but I didn't love the toppings.  I really just wanted the traditional margarita pizza but again, the group won over and I didn't get my way.  I am also a total pizza snob and rarely if ever do I order pizza at somewhere other than a pizzeria.  That being said, the toppings were definitely fresh-- the spinach was bright green and full of flavor while the mushrooms were of all different varieties and sizes.For dessert we tried the pumpkin cake with a cream cheese butter cream which was absolutely delicious.  The perfect amount of frosting, very light and airy, and the cake was dense but seriously delicious without an overwhelming flavor of potentially artificial pumpkin.  The dessert menu in and of itself looked amazing, really inventive and seasonal desserts-- it was tough to choose one.  All in all, the service was really excellent and I will most definitely return, especially as I anticipate them changing their menu seasonally.",3,1,1,Laura R.,"New York, NY",122,100,15
5.0,10/22/2010,"I don't know what I did in my past life as to deserve to experience dessert heaven at ABC Kitchen, but I'll happily accept!  A group of friends and I stopped in on Sunday evening for dessert.  We were seated at a gorgeous, rustic table in the middle of the restaurant.  The restaurant is a beautifully decorated and large open space with a touch of rustic mixed with cozy.  It had high ceilings, dim lighting (enhancing our complexions), candlelight, pumpkins and autumn touches lined a table nearby.The wait staff was extremely accommodating.  They were able to take our orders and Elizabeth (who is dear friends with one of our fellow diners), the pastry chef even came to our table personally to greet us, explain the dessert menu and gave us recommendations.Within minutes of ordering, we were serenaded by dessert after dessert.  I'll go ahead and outline a few of our favorites:-grape tart: Delectable. Buttery. The subtle grape flavor brought us to a euphoric state.-sundae: A handful of popcorn coated in caramel made this sundae a grand dessert. Salty and sweet meets in this delectable sundae.-the doughnuts: Dear god, these things deserve a category of their own. Every single dessert we ordered was delightful, but I don't know where to even start with these. Just one bite of the puffy, perfectly crafted creatures caused me to moan like Meg Ryan did in that famous scene from ""When Harry Met Sally""... right in the middle of the restaurant.  The doughnuts are stuffed with a perfect vanilla and the side of BACON infused chocolate topped it off. Good Lord.  -lemon drop cookies: I'm pretty sure these are the ones straight from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory... growing among the trees along the chocolate river. Delicious.-lemon meringue pie: The most gorgeous of the desserts. So pretty you don't want to eat it.. Wait, no. Too aesthetically pleasing and delicious to pass up. The flavor of the lemon was just perfect. Not overpowering, and not too subtle.-the seasonal dessert: pumpkin cake with the IDEAL cream cheese frosting. The best of the best. The frosting that all cakes, desserts dream of being smothered in. The cake was mouth-watering, so decadent with the perfect touch of pumpkin.I can't wait to come back and visit the next time I'm in New York.  I'll be sure to eat lunch or dinner and save PLENTY of room for dessert.Thank you, ABC Kitchen and Elizabeth for an amazing first experience.  Bravo!",1,1,1,Annie K.,"Brooklyn, NY",63,244,7

4.0,10/6/2010,"ABC Kitchen is my second taste of Jean Georges - the first being Spice Market. The man definitely knows his stuff - ABC Kitchen is the kind of place to see and be seen in. The dining and bar rooms have this great energetic buzz that is truly addicting. Love the decor, love the eclectic lighting, and looove the tacky 70's/garage sale/Grandma-passed-it-down-to-me china. Okay, now on to the important stuff! Appetizers/Starters to share: - Peekytoe Crab Toast- Fluke SashimiThe toast was really good. Great fresh crab, delicately seasoned, with just the right amount of mayo dollops (I hate too much mayo). I had an issue with the crusts and the fact that they were burnt - a carcinogenic aftertaste is not the best - but the boyfriend dismissed that and claimed he loved it. Overall, a winner!The fluke sashimi was...a flop. The grapes were the highlight of the dish - what? I probably could've eaten a whole bowl of those grapes sans the sashimi. The seasoning was all over the map, leaving some pieces completely naked without any sea salt OR tarragon! I also felt like it needed just a touch more acid.Entrees:- Kasha and Bowtie Pasta with Veal Meatballs- Cheeseburger I am a major sucker for freshly made pasta that is perfectly al dente. Enter my bowtie pasta with veal meatballs! I was really debating heavily between this and the Arctic Char...pretty happy with my final decision (although I will definitely want to come back to give the Arctic Char a shot). The veal meatballs were delicate, savory, with lingering tastes of lemon. The sauce had a generous amount of kasha, which added great texture to the dish.The bf is a major burger fanatic, so of course he HAD to get the burger. I think the waitress kind of rolled her eyes a little bit when he ordered this. Um hello? Who orders the cheeseburger when they come to a JG restaurant? Obviously not me, since I didn't. BUT do not be fooled. The burger is actually really different and tasty. The spicy green peppers really give it the kick that brings it to the next level. The shredded cheese mound is really clever and subtle. Fries-wise, nobody can beat April Bloomfield's fries at the Breslin, but these get an honorable mention. Dessert:- Ice Cream SundaeTwo words: Whoa. Decadence. Salted caramel ice cream? Count me in! Mix candied nuts and caramel popcorn in and I'm ready to throw in the towel. So basically Brian and I stuffed ourselves to death and walked/crawled home, immediately followed by changing into our stretchiest pants. The end!",2,2,2,Nancy D.,"New York, NY",321,343,75
4.0,10/2/2010,"Bright. Airy. Unfinished decor. Recyclable elements. Rustic. Farm-to-table. Buzzwords? Yes. However, push aside the buzz, and let the food speak for them.It speaks LOUDLY. ABC Kitchen prides itself on using simple, fresh and local ingredients, we like that.Came here for brunch w/ great friends who love good food, and definitely picked the right place. Here's the rundown.Pretzel Dusted Calamari - Nicely fried, not greasy. The Calamari wasn't chewy or gummy at all--very tender and almost melted in your mouth. I guess it's a sign of freshness. Pretzel-y crust was perfect, light and crisp. The mustard aioli beats the marinara.Peeky Toe Crab Toast - Didn't have this b/c of my shellfish allergy. My friends said it was amazing.Grilled Portabello Sandwich w/ arugula & lemon mayo - Surprisingly ordered by my friend who's a meat-eater from Texas. The fresh ingredients and flavor were intense and well balanced.Akaushi Cheeseburger - Didn't have this either, but friends say good, not spectacular. Roasted Carrot And Avocado Salad - Suprisingly good. The carrots were perfectly roasted--smoky, sweet and slightly meaty.Goat Cheese Spinach Herb Pizza - Amazing. The saltiness of the goat cheese isn't overwhelming, but well balanced w/ the fresh spinach, parsley and dill--which brings a brightness and extra layer of savory. Toasted Corn w/ lime and cotija cheese - Simple, but you can taste the freshness in the sweet corn. Sweet, tangy and salty. Yum.Toasted Marshmallow Chocolate Ganache Cake - This was good, but not exceptional. My favorite part was the ganache between the layers. The cake was airy and rich at the same time. The Marshmallow frosting was indeed marshmallow-y. Fresh Glazed Doughnuts - Tasty, but would've preferred them warm. The strawberry rhubarb preserves are a perfect compliment.So all in all, a 4.5. Would've been a 5, but the dessert options didn't seem to live up to the rest of the meal. Aside from dessert, the meal was spectacularly delicious. Will I come back here? DEFINITELY. Jean-Georges has a magical way w/ his food and restaurants and ABC is no exception. Fresh local ingredients, simple preparation, and amazing execution.

I had their version of the tomato/mozzarella salad and it was SO good, they add sliced peppers of some sort and it really gives it a great zing.

5.0,9/26/2010,"I have been to this location many times before when it was Lucy's Latin Kitchen. They had the most amazing mango margaritas. Back then it was all natural woods, cavernous, with the adjoining ABC housewares available for purchase.  The woods are now all whitewashed, the room airier as a result, with organic touches of branches, and mismatched but beautiful dishes.We were here for ""work"" and our magazine partner made the res. Maybe because he used to work for Bon Appetit or maybe because his current mag is pretty chi-chi, we got a few dishes sent to us gratis (bruschetta and pizzette). Antonio (is that his name?) from Top Chef DC was in attendance with a PYT.Aside from that unusual perk a couple things stood out. They offer a juice menu of green juice or other cleanse type drinks if you fancy it. We had the pretzel dusted calamari, beets, squash, peekytoe crab (which our waited explained, when asked, was a misnomer for ""picked toe""), and the aforementioned freebies. Most had the special wild striped bass, moi, the baked lobster. The fries which were dusted with a mysterious fried herb, went quickly.Everything there is for sale, including the waitstaff (for a price, I asked ;) )",1,1,1,Jennifer H.,"New York, NY",74,337,33

5.0,9/22/2010,"This the definition of a five star restaurant in 2010. If I could change one thing: well I'd make it easier for me to get a reservation but only me. This place is hard to get a reservation at a good time. Try to book it in advance, weeks in advance, because it is worth it.I have been to ABC Kitchen twice. Once on a date with Natalie F., the other time with my parents and grand-mother. It is one of those rare casual restaurants that can be as fancy as you want it to be. If you came in a tuxedo, I don't think you'd stand out anymore than if you came in a t-shirt. Perhaps this is because the restaurant's interior radiates with a special soft light on white glow that oozes class. The lighting and unique decorations create a truly special atmosphere unlike any I have ever experienced. Another major plus as far as design does is the ample space between tables. So many Manhattan restaurants stack tables so close to each other that the restaurant itself loses any intimacy that it might otherwise have. The designer spaced the tables much farther apart than most NY restaurants do which really gives the place a much better feel that many other restaurants.As far as the menu goes, they have seasonal appetizers called the market table. According to our server, their specialties are their toasts. I had the peekytoe crab toast and it was really special. They also have a liver toast and another with tomatoes I believe.We had several other tremendously tasty appetizers. In particular, the calamari stood out as hands down the best calamari I've ever had. It came with a dipping sauce that made the dish as well as your traditional marinara. The heirloom tomatoes and mozzarella was also great and had a touch of jalapeño which stood out compared to other tomatoes and mozzarella dishes. The tuna sashimi was excellent as well.For entrees I have had the haddock and the lobster. Both were fantastic.The other people in my party had the chicken, bass, egg pizza, and cheeseburger. My mom said the chicken tasted better than any chicken she has ever had. The chef prepared it superbly, mildly crispy on the outside and moist in the middle. The bass had a mild spice to it that tasted different that most seafood dishes but worked perfectly to create a memorable entrée.The deserts were good but none of the ones I tried were the to die for desserts that I'd say you just have to try. If something looks good to you, however, you'll probably like it because they were pretty tasty.In conclusion, it really doesn't get any better than this. It is a 5 star dining experience and receives top marks in every category I can think of. If I ranked  service, food, and ambiance independently I would award ABC 5 stars in each category. When you put it all together it is a restaurant of the highest order. I cannot recommend any restaurant with more enthusiasm than I do ABC Kitchen.",2,1,1,Kyle W.,"Baltimore, MD",3,33,7

4.0,9/20/2010,"I didn't think I'd need a backup plan. My plans for date no. 2 with Madame X seemed pretty fail safe. Dinner for 2 at ABC Kitchen on Wednesday night.

WHAT!!!! Not possible. Oh, no, check your Open Table confirmation email. Oh no, possible. I totally f--- up. So not like me. And X is going to be here in 3 minutes. But X was a few minutes late, which gave the ABC hostess a little extra time to poke her head out the front door and see if I was still hanging around. ""Hey,"" she said to me, ""when you're both here, come on inside, and we'll see what we can do.""Um, seriously!? I love you! Not only that, they hooked us up with a sweet table. Yep, I liked ABC. I liked the cool Scando-decor. I liked how they had Southampton Altbier on the beer list. Yeah, best beer ever. I liked my organic grilled chicken, and X liked her steamed halibut.

They added thin slices of jalapeno peppers to give it a little kick. I ordered the halibut and my BF ordered the lamb chop. the only call out he had was there was a little too much sauce on his lamb chop but it was cooked perfectly. My halibut was light and flaky, sauce was not overpowering. other items we ordered: Chicken liver toast - very smooth and overall delicious mash potato sides - prob one of the most creamiest things I've ever eaten as for ambiance, it felt like you were sitting in someones patio. decor was very casual and comfortable.

4.0,9/19/2010,"Love the space and breezy atmosphere as much as the idea of sustainable food.  Was not that impressed with the actual menu however. I practically burned my tongue on the halibut so asked politely if I could send it back as there was no mention of any spice on the menu. Waiter insisted it was not spicy and thought I was crazy but agreed to take it back. It was returned sans spice so obviously they were able to pinpoint the culprit.  Melon bellinis unfortunately sound more delicious than they actually taste and while the pizza was good there's nothing special about it.  The highlight of my meal were the market strawberries with meringue, mint and lime.  Very refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness. I also sampled a chocolate cake which was pretty generic/dull.  Still giving this place four stars for the idea, ambiance, location, and the fun options for drinks, desserts, and teas.*Note: No reception with T-mobile in the dining room.

4.0,9/10/2010,"I'm slow to the dance, no doubt, but having finally made it to ABC Kitchen, I must share my thoughts. I love this place! Firstly, if you enter via ABC Carpets, you have an 'excuse' to browse all the beautiful items on your way to the back stairs. Once in the space that is ABC Kitchen, you will feel as though you are in a special place. The simple décor manages to be welcoming rather than sterile. A risk taken when white is the palette of almost the entire space. But the soft lighting and wood beamed ceiling save us from feeling like we're at the doctors. Instead, the white works well to liven up the space and not make it dreary being that it is the 'basement' of the store. But enough about the cool and comfy décor! The foooooood! Oh the glorious fooooood! ABC Kitchen is proof positive that simple dishes can be absolutely delightful when prepared with fresh organic ingredients. Instead of using heavy sauces and pounds of butter to mask canned ingredients they allow the wonderful flavors and fragrances of nature's best to shine through. For flavor, they rely on fresh tasty herbs that burst forth with flavor on ones unsuspecting taste buds. I also respect the chef's awareness of portion size. Let it not be misunderstood...the portions are not stingy or small. They are, in fact, what we as humans should be eating. I think I've gotten so used to having boat-sized pasta dishes and leaning-tower-of-Pisa sandwiches shoved in front of me that the plates at ABC Kitchen seemed demure...a welcome departure from the obnoxious. It's lovely to be able to eat like a lady at a business lunch rather than having to unhinge my jaw to take a bite out of a BLT. So then, I've revealed my chosen dish. I must say, it was after much deliberation that I went with the Turkey BLT. I did so because I knew...knew...it would taste so different and better than any I've had before. It did not disappoint. The turkey was moist and snowy white. The bacon was lean and crispy...no grease dripping down my arm. Naturally the lettuce (well mixed greens actually) and tomatoes were fresh and proportioned well with the other elements of the sandwich. (Clearly I over think my sandwiches.) The herbed Mayo added a great zing and the bread was perfect! It wasn't too doughy and I didn't slice up the roof of my mouth on a too-hard crust. Needless to say, if their sandwiches are this great the rest of the menu is phenomenal. I didn't even have time for dessert which was heartbreak but a welcome excuse to return...which I will...many times over. Bravo!!!",0,0,0,Monica V.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,33,0
5.0,9/9/2010,"Definitely 5 star.  Couldn't stop thinking about the meal and I want to come back.  For such amazing food, I love the casual environment - people were not dressed up to the nines, and everywhere you look around, people are laughing and talking.  It's got this nice warm light, a big farmhouse-like feel, simple decorations, and really good service.  Did I say the food was amazing? First the thick French bread.  The olive oil tasted really fresh and had a really great taste (i don't usually like the olive oil restaurants serve).  For appetizers, my bf had the peekytoe crab toast. Very good.  I had the raw diver maine scallops - these were delicious, super special.  They were thinly sliced, served on a chilled bowl of ice, were flavored with fennel, salt, some peppers, and I loved it.  Wanted every bite to last.  For dinner i had the black sea bass.  Didn't really like that it was in a broth of olive oil - a bit too oily for me, but otherwise it was very good.  I personally prefer the flaky kind - this was the crispy skin kind - but it was still good.  BF had the halibut.  He really loved how fresh and light it was, with yummy veggies. For dessert we shared blueberry pie with sweet corn ice cream.  I would have preferred it warm, but it was very good and not too tart. So much of the menu (and dishes on neighboring tables) looked good.  Saw the heirloom tomato toast, the pizzas near by looked super tempting (especially the one with big slabs of mozzarella, tomato, and basil), the summer squash salad looked very healthy...and our neighbors were raving about their salted caramel sundae with popcorn.  Overall, can't wait to go back.",1,0,0,Vivian W.,"San Francisco, CA",14,541,0

Thank God there were 3 of us so we got 3 different fresh squeezed juices...the highlights were the Market Fresh and The Local, which acted as a light, sweet, and refreshing appetite stimulant for a local, farm fresh culinary experience. I ordered to share the peeky toe crab toast and the roasted carrot and avocado salad. Both were OK, I liked the presentation of the salad, but I thought the carrots were a little to sour for me. The crab toast was OK, but I thought it could've been executed much better. My entrée was the portobello mushroom burger with fries. Yum! a thumbs up for this one cause I loved the portobello mushroom and the hint of jalapeno peppers that was incorporated in to the burger. I tried my friend's Artic Char.....I thought the crispy skin was AMAZING! I really liked it and the texture of the fish was perfect! That was another thumbs up! My mother ordered the pizza margherita...unfortunately was not the best pizza in the world, but the use of whole wheat flour earned them a third thumbs up...the pizza could have been hotter when they delivered it to the table. As for the dessert, we opted to order a dish from the brunch menu that our waitress recommended earlier on, which were the doughnuts and the strawberry jam. Now if you were to recommend something, it better be phenomenal and these doughnuts were not, actually slightly below the standards of the average Dunkin Doughnut, so I don't quite know what to say....I was just merely disappointed. The Acai berry tea was a very nice digestif...and now I was set for the day. #_# Oh, I must commend their cute shabby chic china and handmade plates and mugs...I am a big fan of organic crafts, each unique and one of a kind. :)",5,2,6,Renee C.,"Vancouver, Canada",401,613,115

4.0,8/27/2010,"I happily rolled out of ABC Kitchen last Friday night. It was one of those perfect NY dining experiences. The service was impeccable. The food was very good across the boards.  I got to sample even more dishes this time around. Again, I rolled outta that place...pants unbuttoned and all. No regrets really.I came here with my family to celebrate life - my new job and my sister surviving an accident. Perfect venue? I think so. Upon scanning the menu, I realized how it has already changed given I was just there a week prior. Guess I wont be reunited with roast pork tenderness after all *shrugs*  My mom gave me the go signal to select wine and plan out our meal.  She asked me which ones were good to which I replied ""every single savory dish is mom. Trust me.""  And she did. The result? A FEAST! Like kings and queens we enjoyed the following:Round 1: crostinis of peekytoe crab, chicken liver, heirloom tomatoes;  fluke carpaccio, roasted beets w yogurt, zucchini special. My fav: zucchini special, beets with yogurt, and heirloom tomato crostini. simple yet heavenly satisfying.Round 2: spinach with goat cheese pizza, mushroom pizza, mozzarella cheese w heirloom tomato and basil, roasted carrots and avocado salad, and a simple pasta dish w shrimp and tomatoes I forgot the name of. My fav: still the roasted carrot saladRound 3: (by this time my father jokingly asked to cancel the rest of our order) lambchops, broiled lobster, sea bass w spinach and potatoes, seared chicken with mashed potatoes, side of string beansMy fav: Chicken. Why? Because it was done perfectly. Moist and seasoned well...crispy skin and all. Round 4: We questioned whether we have space space for dessert. After eating this much, what's another bite of five right? We had sundae with salted caramel ice cream, strawberries w lime juice and poppyseed ice cream, warm doughnuts w dip and a cookie plate.  My pick: strawberries w poppyseed ice cream because it had a refreshing cleansing effect to end our meal.Everyone agreed with my earlier statement. Everything at ABC Kitchen is good.  Yummmaaayyy!P.S. My sister works here which allowed us to taste more dishes apart from the many we ordered. Big thanks!P.S.S.

5.0,8/26/2010,"Last night-my boyfriend and I went to ABC Kitchen for a little date night. We got there around 8:15ish and they said it would be at least 45 minutes. We said no worries-put our name down and we would go over to Pipa have a drink and come back. (pipa is also one of our favorite restaurants plus where we had our first date). The hostess who was very nice-Nikki-let us know to check back in 30 minutes. We did promptly and sure enough-our table was ready.To start-the decor of the restaurant is amazing-makes you feel like you are in a vintage-modern cabin of some sort. ABC really out did themselves with Pipa and now ABC Kitchen-its breathtaking! From the tables to the mirrors in the bathroom-the whole feel of the restaurant was very classy and homey at the same time.Our waitress greeted us and was very friendly and comforting. She helped us pick out a bottle of wine and recommended entrees. We ordered per her recommendation the Beets with their Homemade Yogurt Sauce (not my fav but my boyfriend loved it), the roasted squash with Parmesan, The  tuna carpaccio, and the Morels, Parmesan, Oregano and Fram Egg Pizza. Also we had the peeky crab toast which had a dollop of Aioli on top. -Very good!! But could have done without the toast. The crab alone was very fresh! and then for my favorite part....a side of the corn-which I am a corn connoisseur. It had a jalapeno lime vinaigrette/sauce with shaved Parmesan on top. I would have to say this was one of the best corn dishes I have ever had, EVER.So obviously-we thought we ordered enough food and we could have been just fine with that. (not to mention we did have Pulpo Gallego- sauteed octopus, roasted potatoes, black olives, paprika and the Vegetable Cocasroasted eggplant puree, roasted red peppers, tomato, corn, broccoli, cabra cheese)   But the chef kept sending plates to our table-which was amazing of course and we were definitely NOT turning these down. He sent over a piece of a baguette cut four ways that had a piece of fresh parmesean cheese on the bottom and fresh green, red and yellow tomatos sliced on top. FREAKING PHENOMENAL! Then he sent over a Pasta dish as well-Tomato, Buffalo Mozzarella and Basil Pizza. I mean talk about amazingess!Then since we didn't clearly have enough food-we ordered some sorbet. :)Time to go home! We ended the night being extremely happy. All the wait staff were AMAZING, very attentive from the person who filled our water to the hostess at the front.

""No, of course not, we source all of our eggs from a local farm and they are all organic."").  I also enjoyed the pacing of the meal.  It was leisurely but without taking all night.As far as dishes were concerned they looked beautiful and fresh and we tried a lot of them including: the heirloom tomato salad, tuna sashimi, diver scallopsi, cured meat and cheese, portabello mushrooms, calamari, goat cheese and spinach pizza, mushroom and egg pizza, and the halibut.  Everything tasted simple and clean and delicious but I just wasn't completely blown away like I expected to be.  I give the tomato salad extra points because of the addition of sliced hot peppers which made it more special than your average caprese.Oh and the desserts were a little over-hyped.  Tried the salted caramel sundae and the donuts.  Meh.Would I go back?  Absolutely.  Are there other NY restaurants I'd want to try first?  Also absolutely.",0,0,0,Karen L.,"New York, NY",40,37,3

My friend and I ate the crab toast and the spinach, goat cheese and herb pizza. Both of which were delicious. However, the problem that both of us had after eating that was that weird feeling that the dill gave our tongue and teeth. Just a minor thing. it was a weird sensation that we thought was funny. For dessert we split the salted caramel ice cream sundae, which was between good and sublime. the salted caramel ice cream had the chocolate syrup, caramel pop corn and roasted peanuts. It was a pretty good ending, if I may say so. My only problem for the cafe was the wait. The food came at a regular pace but the dessert took forever.

Add the fresh table salt and squeeze fresh lemon to taste.Then I had the pork and my friend had the cod fish. My dish was a bit salty but the apricots and figs made for a sweet and savory bite. The best part of the meal, however, was my red wine and the caramel ice cream sundae. The wine was the most expensive on on the list you could get by the glass at $15.

My friend and I shared the ricotta ravioli, the crispy organic chicken, and the chef gave us a free side of the corn--all absolutely delicious and gorgeously presented. For desert we had the salted caramel ice cream (with chocolate sauce and caramel popcorn), which was probably one of the most mouthwatering desserts I've had to enjoy in NYC thus far--the balance of the salt and sweetness was divine.

MainOrganic crispy chickenAs usual, lives up ot the JG hype around chicken. Very moist, simple, delicious, fresh.

Pretty good although taste wise, not that different or better than what I get from Baskin Robbins. More of the gelato would have made this dish.Donuts --- again, pretty plain, nothing special. The chocolate bacon dipping sauce was excellent, but the jam was not. Very good meal, you will not be disappointed. I felt like we had a meal the size of a 4 course (2 small starter plates, 1 larger but not huge main, 1 full dessert each) and the total food bill was $82 for 2 pre tax and tip. Solid!

5.0,8/5/2010,"Have never really gone to very chic or expensive restaurants much at all in my life.  But having trekked out to the big apple to visit with a friend from way way back, she took me and her daughter to this place right after I landed in the city.   The staff was very plentiful and mostly seemed pretty on top of things.  Our hostess was in a pretty cool outfit,  but then coming from Boston and never having gone to this type of place, I guess I'm not one to judge.   My host who hails from serious old money I guess, ordered some kind of cheese ravioli type deal, which was ok, but awfully small, again having never gone to this type of place, I don't get that the more money you drop on food, the less you get by volume.  I ordered the tomato and mozarella salad, which was quite good, and the marinated olives, which were very good, if not a bit sour.   My  friends daughter ordered some kind of portobella steak sandwich and they both had two smoothies.  For desert, it was some kind of sorbet I think with some strawberry sauce, again the serving was so small, when I eat ice cream at home, I tend to go through a carton in three days.  The bill came out to about three times what I usually spend at my favorite place in Boston for four people!   Thinking about it today, I am wondering if its because they put in the tip automatically and the fact that N.Y. taxes might be close to 20 percent if there is a city and state meals tax?   Anyways the meal was very good, but this kind of place, is not really in my normal price range and frankly with my metabolism, eating tiny meals just does'nt cut it.  But for the rest of the population with more money and more body fat, I highly recommend this place.   Having a rich friend pick up the tab  made the meal go down a lot easier too!",0,0,0,DEREK S.,"Cambridge, MA",23,16,0

All 6 of us.-c) 7 wanted to come actually but the restaurant refused to seat more than 6 at a table. Despite our table being able to actually fit a 7th. That was a shame.The redeeming feature though is that the awesome host came over to offer us complimentary cocktails on the house and we got free desserts for waiting so darn long.

I recently decided to run the Queens Half Marathon and what's a better way to celebrate a job well done than with a big, juicy burger? This burger has been like the carrot in front of the horse for weeks! So Saturday night when my friend and I (she ran also) sat down at the bar for dinner I was more than excited. When we arrived, we ordered cocktails as we waited for a seat at the bar. I had the basil lime daiquiri and my friend had the vodka thyme lemonade. Both were delicious and very refreshing. The herbs were the stars of the cocktails without being over powering. When we sat the bartender gave us menus and said something under his breath as he walked away. When I finally got his attention again, I asked him what he said. ""We're out of the burger."" WHAT?!?!I was crushed. It took me a few minutes to process this information before I could look at the menu again. We finally decided on the following:Crab ToastSnap Pea SaladBlack Sea BassPork and Chicken Sausage PizzaEverything was good. Next time, I'd skip the pizza. It was a bit too much food and while it was good, nothing to write home about. The other dishes were well composed, perfectly balanced and very enjoyable. The highlights for me were the snap pea salad in which the peas were julienned into fine slivers bringing a whole new dimension to snap peas that I had never imagined. The sea bass was incredible.  The menu doesn't do it justice. There was a beautiful cooked lemon taste throughout the dish with pieces of lemon throughout.

3.0,7/16/2010,"So I made my reso a month in advance but still got a 9pm-er.  Ive been wanting to check this place out for a while so I just took it.  I was the first to arrive from my party so I went to the bar to grab a drink while I waited for my friend.  The other patrons who were also at the bar looked like they were straight out of the show ""Hills"".  spoiled, annoying long island types - and not to mention very rude. In any case, my friend finally showed up and I went back to the desk to check in and they told me and my friend to wait a minute longer. So we waited...And then of course fran drescher walks in (random) and she checks in and gets seated right away.  I was a bit annoyed about that and I think the hostess saw that i was vexed and seated us right after.  The place has a very clean country feel (its the old Lucy restaurant). As for the food- The highlights are: chicken liver crostini . The Halibut entree was excellent and the salted caramel sundae was heavenly.  as for the not so memorable dishes for me: The fava bean salad wasnt that great (the fava beans were way overcooked).  The braised carrot salad was just ok.  And the ricotta ravioli was decent and small. I definitely went in with high expectations bc of the rave reviews.  Not sure if they were met tho",0,0,0,Christine M.,"New York, NY",8,102,0
4.0,7/14/2010,"Let me start out by saying this is 5 star food for me. Simply the freshest produce and fish and just amazing classic, clean flavors. I'm addicted to the crudite plate and the peeky toe crab toast, but to speak honestly every dish I've had there has been great to amazing. Only been twice, but was really wowed by the food.Place loses a star for having the cheesiest clientele ever. I know it's not the restaurants fault, but it makes going there pretty annoying. It's filled with a combination of ""skank in the city"" types, and loud financial dudes. The decor seems severely dated and reeks of a late 90s shabby chic mess. If you can somehow see beyond the loud, platic-like blow our haired ladies and the men that love them, you will have a great meal, but because the place is new and popular you'll have to wait with all these annoying people and it can severely detract from the experience.",1,1,1,evan d.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,152,0
5.0,7/14/2010,"This has been one of the better meals I have had lately! I really liked the space, and even though it seemed a bit cavernous, I enjoyed all the subtle, simple details to it. The menu looked really good and I started with the Mackeral Sashimi which had a wonderful sauce around it. Then, on the advice of some of the other yelpers, I ordered the Crispy Chicken, which was awesome! My girlfriend got the Arctic Char which cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful.For dessert, you can't go wrong with the Sundae as it's one of the best, especially the salty, caramel ice cream, which I could've taken a whole vat to go!",0,0,1,Sam G.,"Washington, DC",17,173,1
4.0,7/13/2010,"Everyone's been raving about Jean-George's ABC Kitchen, so I decided to see what the talk is about. The restaurant is part of ABC Carpet & Home. You can enter it from the furniture store all the way in the back or at it's official entrance on 18th Street. DECORI went in from the back since my friend insisted and had to walk all the way from the back to the front to be seated in the back again. It was very antique yet modern looking. I can only describe it as... yuppie-hipster. Everything gave you the ambiance of fresh, organic, green, and eco-friendly. It's as if they were completely furnished by ABC Carpet & Home, hmmm..... The plates were definitely from the home store...SERVICEBeside the really grumpy girl that gave my friend an attitude since he was trying to get seated 10 minutes before dinner opening, everyone else was very nice. Courtesy with a smile, very attentive and informative on the menu (I was confused about the difference between market table and appetizers; market table portions are smaller). I felt appreciated. FOOD- Chicken Liver Toast: I never knew how good chicken liver can taste as a spread.- Sugar Snap Pea Salad with Parmesan Dressing and Herbs: Fresh, crispy, healthy, unless you find the cheese too heavy (I don't).- Pretzel Dusted Calamari, Marinara and Mustard Aioli: Tasted like perfected fried calamari at a pub.- Whole Wheat Bigoli, Pork Ragu, Parmesan: I don't get it, but meaty.- Seared Arctic Char with Spicy Corn Broth: Fish is moist and flavorful combined with the corn broth. Skin is crispy. Combination is awesome. Lesie approve!- Salted Caramel Ice Cream Sundae with Candied Peanuts & Popcorn: I never thought I would like salty ice cream, but it works! The caramel flavor is light, so even with the whipped cream and chocolate syrup, it's not as heavy as it sounds! I think I can get used to salty ice cream!- Organic Root Beer: It's green! The root beer flavor is concentrated on the bottom. Floating around is the minty taste. Interesting...- Fizzy Lizzy Raspberry Lemonade: This was the first time I've heard of a Fizzy Lizzy (It's a bottled flavored seltzer/soda). Yummy!DISTRACTIONThere was a solo house fly flying around during the latter part of dinner. It landed on the plate on the table next to me. And then it tried to fly to my table.

5.0,7/12/2010,"Innovative. Ground breaking. I would say this restaurant marks the beginning, or rather the mainstreaming of eco-dining here in New York. While the trend has been around for a long time, it's nice to finally have a real temple of eco-obsessive gastronomy to worship at. Oh, and the food is just flawless.

3.0,7/10/2010,"3.5 stars.  Pace yourself. At least you're 'supposed' to at an organically-focused restaurant.  From the exterior, one would never expected a gastro-creation inside, but don't be fooled.  What goes on behind the minimal frames is most intriguing.  I scored a brunch reservation not because I was smart, but probably because people were either at the bar or at home watching the FIFA game (winning/losing bet at the same time).  I was greeted by friendly hostesses and waitstaff. Upon sitting down, for once, I took my time to study the utensils.  Each and every one was unique and different.  The bread plates, the knives and forks, all looked vintage-liked, like something from your grandmother's attic or from the Salvation Army.  Then I learned from their website their dinnerwares were crafted by local artisans or some farout indigenous from the Patagonia. I just wanted to steal them...but of course I didn't! If it weren't for the large space and modern decorations, I would've felt transported to an Americana kitchen served by a little old woman from the Midwest, with a garden right outside her cottage and yes, a brick pizza oven somewhere in between.  Hey, it's my dream.My companion and I were given an ample amount of time to peruse the menu.  Then the drinks came and then the complimentary bread  arrived (soft and mochi-liked, loved it).  You see, everything happened by steps, like a prix-fixe experience at other Jean Georges's restaurants, so be patient and enjoy your company.  I knew the menu from the website and I've to say, their dinner menu looks more interesting than brunch.  I went with a salad nad made some requests.  When those requests got messed up, the waitress took my dish back and exchanged for a new one.  I appreciated that. My companion chose the kasha, bowtie pasta with veal meatballs.  Sounded heavy, but it was actually a very small portion at $15.  So again, take your time and savor every pieces of bowtie.  I guess that's JC's purpose - slow eating promotes good health.  Throughout the meal, our water glasses were consistently refilled and all the diners seemed to be happy with what they ate.  Everyone looked so refreshed and trouble-free, so I guess the foods were doing their magic.   I would hope to see more 'filling' vegetarian/vegan-friendly dishes on the brunch menu though.",2,0,2,GarGuPi L.,"Flushing, NY",87,496,1696
5.0,7/9/2010,"Worth the hype.  2 dining stories.1) New York is one of those places where even chefs are celebrities...although I don't know if they count as B or C list celebrities or what.  Was dining with the SO and we were debating what to get.  Naturally, we do what everyone else does and blatantly stared at the 2 guys dining at the table next to us just to see what they were eating.  We strike a convo because their pretzel-dusted calamari looked amazing.  Turns out one of the guys is none other than Jim Lahey of Sullivan St Bakery and Co Pizza fame.  He was modest and at first said that he owned a pizza place.  But since I love pizza, I had to find out who which one.  We all had a brief conversation about pizza and sustainable eating, the type of conversation that really would really only happen here.  And naturally, at a Jean Georges restaurant to boot.The dining experience was splendid.  The calamari's batter was perfect and unfishy.  The sauces that came with it were equally tasty -- a mustard sauce and a marinara one.  Also had one of the pizza specials, which featured hen of the woods and a sunny side up egg.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the way the toppings turned out on the pizza, but the crust and sauce were great -- pizza menu by the way was designed by Mr Lahey himself.But more importantly, the burger is probably one of the greatest burgers in all of burgerdom.  Like it's THAT good.  Arugula mayo. Pickled jalapeno peppers.  Delicious delicious ground beef.  I mean it was amazing.  And the fries were perfect as well.2) Second time we go, manage to snag a reservation on the eve of the 4th of July because the city is virtually empty.  And since the city is empty and the restaurant is newish, the tourists don't know about it.  And like all good Americans on the 4th of July, I'm eating a burger (again).  And it was amazing again.  And we had the same waiter and upon finding out that we were miserable studying for the bar exam, he hooked us up with a free dessert.  A sundae.  The sundae was equally amazing.  A legendary sundae that's about as American as you can get.  Vanilla ice cream.  Tons of fudge.  Nuts.  And fricking caramelized popcorn!  Burger + Epic Sundae.  Really the perfect thing on or about the 4th of July.  Oh and on top of that, we also got the ice cream cake.  Which pretty much put me in a coma since I had forgotten about the free dessert that we had gotten.  Thankfully, I didn't end up like in that one Gluttony scene in Se7en.  Overall, this restaurant is awesome.  We actually got the same server on two occasions and he was great.  Wine selection can be affordable.  The cocktail list is pretty interesting and I have had a few from the menu although I can't recall what I got hah (i think I had a ginger margarita on my recent visit or something).  I really haven't explored the menu all that much because the burger is just too good. I may have to branch out though.  But the two times that I've eaten here have been pretty memorable.",3,1,1,Victor S.,"Brooklyn, NY",319,314,11
4.0,7/9/2010,"ABC Kitchen is an incredibly unique restaurant - one that is nearly impossible to review.  The long and short of it, is that this place has truly outstanding food, but the dining experience does not do justice to the special cuisine.  I cannot say that I necessarily have a problem with the dressed-down staff or the ""green"" theme that pervades ABC Kitchen.  The dining setting is certainly unique and eye-catching, and the servers were attentive, knowledgeable, and courteous.  But I suppose that the ""Green"" philosophy in ABC Kitchen extends to air-conditioner use and furniture as well - on a hot summer night, the restaurant was absolutely sweltering.  The chairs were not particularly comfortable either, and the acoustics in the space are very poor.  The bottom line is that the dining room is just downright uncomfortable.What saved ABC Kitchen, of course, was the kitchen.  The crab-toast appetizer was the best appetizer I have had in recent memory.  The entrees were all very good - and reasonably priced.  They save the best for last with dessert - the ice cream sundae with cracker jacks ranks among the best desserts I have ever had.I will definitely go back here, in the winter when it's not as hot.  If this restaurant could compromise a little bit on its motif - or at least find a way to make dining there more comfortable - it would likely get five stars from me.  Do they deliver?",0,0,0,Drew A.,"New York, NY",0,6,0

The menu in and of itself is interesting, particularly the write-ups on where they get their ingredients, etc. It's nice to know where your food comes from!We each ordered one app a piece to share. For a slight twist on an old classic, try the Pretzel Dusted Fried Calamari; enjoy the thinly sliced, cold Divers Scallops, but skip the bland Soft Shelled Crab. Our fourth appetizer ended up being a mushroom ""pizza"" we didn't order, but we kept it and they comped us for it; I passed as I am a pizza purist, but it looked nice.For my main course, I had the Black Sea Bass with Chilies and Herbs, Red Bliss Potatoes and Spinach; overall it was delicious and just the right portion size for me. The sea bass was flavorful and there was a nice heat provided by the concoction of chilies and herbs nestled in between the crispy skin and meat.

4.0,6/21/2010,"Each of Jean Georges' restaurants is a little bit different, but each is done extraordinarily well. ABC Kitchen, which incorporates sustainability and locally-grown and sourced components, might seem like riding the ""green"" trend factor, but the food speaks for itself. Case in point: I detest radishes, but the small plate brought to our table, along with bread, were so fresh and crisp - unlike anything you could get in the supermarket. The atmosphere reminds me of a country house in France - simple, inviting, yet chic. The service, however, was very confusing. The waiters wear plaid shirts and jeans, but that's not what was confusing. Our one main waiter was tripping on acid or something - he took forever to come by, awkwardly paused between sentences, and also closed out the incorrect cheque and swiped my card for it. The food was perfect, though. The market meat and cheese platter is perfect to share for the table and the peekytoe crab toast is delicious - I thought I could taste the ocean. My black sea bass was swimming in a bit too much oil, but the greens and potatoes that came with the meal did not become saturated and were very fresh. I tried the ricotta ravioli and these melt in your mouth! Dessert is AMAZING. Definitely save room for the ice cream cake - which is a cylindrical chocolate cake with vanilla inside - and also the rhubarb crumble with green tea ice cream. The two flavors compliment each other quite well and it's served warm - perfect comfort food. The caramel popcorn sundae is like glorified Cracker Jacks in ice cream form...it was good after the first three bites and then it lost its charm and got very cloying. I love how the coffee spoons are brought on little cardboard cut-out squares - when you think about it, the energy used to create a china plate, wash it, and cleanse the water used to wash the plate is far greater than this little cardboard cut-out.",2,1,3,Dana F.,"Queens, NY",665,925,146

4.0,5/31/2010,"At risk of repetitive monotony for half-star reviews, ABC Kitchen tested this more than any other I've visited. I really wanted to give this place five stars, because the food was solidly representative of a five rating. The service? While apologetic for the trainees on staff, the goofs and gaffs just couldn't propel this one beyond four. Yelping for holiday dining suggestions, ABC appeared. We called ahead, and were told bar seating was available, with the full menu. When Yelp says ""jump,"" we ask ""how high?"" and we were rewarded with immediate seating. Our server was obviously the trainee. She wasn't initially aware that specials had already been incorporated into the main menu, and then kept flitting from table to table putting out fires while we waited to find out what distinguished the place in terms of alcohol. Although friendly and socially attentive, she was obviously in over her head as a server, and was fatefully rescued by the manager-in-training, who--while competently smoothing her deficiencies--couldn't quite overcome them. He suggested the boutique Wisconsin brand ""Death's Door"" for our vodka and gin drinks. Excellent. Probably the best martini I've had in Manhattan. She took our food order, and promptly forgot my salad order, having my entree--the Bigoli pasta with the pork ragu--delivered immediately, and simultaneously with the calamari, the fiddleheads, and the crab toast appetizers. All were excellent. And we just decided to roll with the service and let the plates fall where they may, family style. The whole wheat bigoli pasta with the pork ragu was one of the most exquisitely exceptional dishes that I've ever had, either here in Manhattan or Los Angeles. A perfect fusion of flavors and textures, beginning with the al dente noodles, and blend of tomatoes, shredded  pork, and hint of mint. My friend ordered the burger, which he and his husband raved over, (although I abstained), and then the husband had the kasha and bowtie pasta, with the veal sausage. They were equally effusive over this dish, while I thought it paled in comparison to the bigoli. The flavors and textures were aggressive, and competitive. Overall, the price-point to quality ratio makes this place a Manhattan must in terms of dinner destinations. I definitely plan to return, and hope to revise this review to five stars.",1,1,1,Michael C.,"New York, NY",129,70,39

4.0,5/24/2010,"ABC Kitchen is Chef Jean Georges' newest restaurant (making this his 9th in New York). Following California's organic farm-to-table movement, I had expected ABC Kitchen to be good, but didn't think it would stand out from many similar restaurants in San Francisco. I'm glad I was wrong.The food was straightforward and rustic, but still exuded Jean Georges' talent and mastery of flavors. I was impressed by how incredible the simplest things (like carrots!) tasted. I had been gorging myself with so much food during this New York trip that I wasn't hungry at dinnertime, but the food was so good here that I couldn't help but to stuff myself some more...Peekytoe Crab Toast - this could not have been better! The crab was really fresh with just a bit of dressing to enhance its sweetness, while the dill gave it some bite. The grilled bread also had a nice crunch and smokiness.Roasted Carrot and Avocado Salad with Crunchy Seeds and Citrus - ok, I'm not one to get excited about carrots, but these carrots were AMAZING!! Best.carrots.ever. They had so much depth and flavor, brought out by the light curry rub. All of the components of this salad tasted beautiful together, especially with zing of the sour cream. My favorite dish of the night! Clam, Mint, and Parsley Pizza - this is the type of dish that I usually associate Jean Georges with...creative, and a fusion of exciting flavors and styles. I really enjoyed this whole wheat pizza - it wasn't grainy or bland (as whole wheat pizzas can be), yet was still light and a treat for the taste buds...plump, savory clams and a spicy punch from the chili peppers.Wood Oven Roasted Maine Lobster with Oregano and Lemon Vinaigrette - Although it was interesting to have a more rustic preparation of lobster and the wood oven gave the lobster a unique smokiness, I probably wouldn't order this dish again. It tasted good, but lacked the sweetness and succulence that I love so much in lobster.Salted Caramel-Peanut Ice Cream Sundae with Candied Popcorn, Whipped Crème Fraiche, Chocolate Sauce - now this is my kind of ice cream sundae! Fun and decadent, yet elevated to a new level by the sophisticated combination of flavors and textures. Loooooooved that salted caramel-peanut ice cream! I also adored the handmade porcelain bowl it was served in (they had lots of charming, vintage-inspired dinnerware). In addition to the delicious food, ABC Kitchen also had great service and a unique vibe. I liked the contrast of its simple white furniture and white brick walls with the exposed wooden beams throughout the restaurant. It was modern and minimalist, yet still incorporated natural elements and felt inviting. Oh, and the restaurant is located inside a furniture store, although it definitely did not feel like it!**If you want to see pics of each course, visit my blog under my profile.

3.0,5/22/2010,"We had a 6 pm res. on a Sunday night, and the place was more than half empty.  I was kind of taken aback when we were led to a table in the middle of the room  in the least comfortable and most crowded spot. Immediately putting on my NewYork-tude, and one-upping her tude,  I led the hostess to where we wanted to sit...in the back,  closest to the cafe...subtly lit and very spacious.  Come on...we don't look like tourists..not even close!   So 5 points got shaved off from the get-go. OK, so, we were willing to put these petty differences aside and get down to serious eating.  The waiter was excellent at steering us to the right cocktail... the margarita. Awesome. We ordered some calamari, (other-worldly), and  bruschetta, which was topped with a kind of pesto and artichoke...hearty and light, at the same time. To this, we added ravioli with a beautiful and sublime marinara sauce, along with steak , lobster, and sauteed fiddle heads as a side.  The steak was buttery, juicy, and a pretty hefty portion. The lobster was fresh, but not succulent...maybe needed to steam for maybe 3 minutes less, or else just sat out too long waiting for the other dishes to be ready. There is a definite trick to serving lobster in a larger restaurant...cook it at the very last second possible and time it carefully.   It  was also pretty meager, (abt. 11/4 lb.) for its $35.00 price tag. I would save that kind of a selection for a real seafood place here in town and stick to pizza, appetizers,  steak and salads here. Dessert came not too soon, as I was looking forward to the peanut sundae and it did not disappoint...come home to mama! It was sweet, salty, smooth and crunchy, in one felt swoop...You've got to save room for this one!  The brown butter tart, written up in TimeOut as served with toasted hazelnuts and chocolate ganache arrived like the bride who forgot her make-up and shoes. Nada, nothing, naked. I asked the waiter for a dab of whipped cream or ice cream..anything to salvage this poor sweet thing from its exile on this plate. Perhaps they still hadn't gotten their act together it being the first week?  Or maybe they don't dress up the desserts on Sundays? Who knows. But for the size of the check, really expected the quality of food and presentation J/G. is known for.",1,1,1,Lucienne D.,"Hoboken, NJ",17,171,0

Sifton (2 visits in, one to go).  While we had multiple different servers bringing dishes, clearing, water pouring, drink serving, it never felt overwhelming & our main waiter lavished much attention & conversation on us plebeians even while he was also in charge of no less than 3 tables of celebrities.  4 of us shared:fiddleheadscrab toastramp toast (special)calamaricarrot/avocado saladkasha/bowtie pastaricotta infused pasta (special)mashed potatoes - ed. note: craving of the preggers woman at our tablesea bassice cream sundaerubarb pieThat seems like a lot for 4 people when typed into a vertical list, but it was the perfect amount of food: all portions were well-sized, delicate, fresh.  Even the bill was reasonable.

5.0,5/17/2010,"I really adored this place from the second I set foot inside.  The decor is dainty and bright, everything is very refined yet casual, it makes you want to sip things and sit up straight in your chair.   The menu was all fresh, local, in season (mostly organic) items and it was a very extensive menu.  I was a little disappointed that my favorite in season thing wasn't on the menu or a special, soft shell crab, but there was still more than enough to get excited about.  Even if you don't make sure to eat seasonally and organic, you can't help but appreciate the fact that the ingredients were so simply made yet delicious because they didn't need to be complicated.The menu is 5 sections, a sort of antipasta section which is far from the usual Italian kind, it included different ""toasts"" like peekytoe crab, mushrooms and ramps, mozzarella and fish.  Then there were appetizers, pasta which you could get in a mid size or main portion, pizzas and main courses.  This doesn't include the extensive dessert menu which Ill get to later.  I had the mackerel sashimi which was amazing, it was doused in a light ginger sauce reminiscent of the ubiquitous (yet delicious) dressing you get on a Japanese salad, but way better.  My husband and I shared the mozzarella with arugula and olive oil (it was a little salty but the mozzarella was heavenly and tihs plate was BIG,) and my husband got a salad.  For mains my husband got the whole wheat bogati (I think that was what it was called,) it was very tasty.  My cod with jalapeno chiles, spinach and red potatoes in broth was by the best restaurant fish I've ever had.  To put this in perspective, my husband despises all things seafood.  He tried this dish and actually asked me to try to replicate it at home!  A miracle.The best part, for me, was the dessert as I ordered 4 (a scoop of malted chocolate ice cream, the rhubarb crisp and the doughnuts, I took the chocolate cake home.)  They weren't big so it wasn't a ton of sugar but close.  Overall I loved this place and love that the menu most likely changes depending on what's the freshest.",0,0,0,Kimberly G.,"Williamsburg, NY",0,69,0

4.0,5/14/2010,"I'd been here when the space used to be Lucy's.  I much prefer this interpretation of the space.  The clean, white lines are perfectly highlighted by the bar in the front and the large dining room is very invitingly lit, rendering the space actually romantic while keeping a modern edge to it.  The atmosphere alone would bring me back for drinks at the bar but as I found out, food here is well worth sitting down for.For appetizers, here's what we had:Mackerel sashimi (about 6 pieces of mackerel in a spicy vinegraitte of type) - delicious and if there hadn't been 3 of us at dinner, there might have been a fight as to how the dish would be shared.Cavatelli special of the evening (home made cavatelli with lima beans, peas and a pancetta cousin) - yummy and could have made a meal of this.Peeky Toe Crab bruschetta - generous portion of crab on top of a large piece of breadRoasted carrot and avocado salad - love the avocado but did not love the roasted carrot.Overall though, the synergy of these 4 appetizers made each one slightly more interesting as they balance each other off.EntreesCrispy chicken - by far the best chicken, apart from fried chicken, I've ever had anywhere.  I never order chicken as a main at restaurants but this chicken is amazingly juicy and tender with crispy skin.  We were all left wondering how it's cooked.Line Caught Halibut - served with a sabayon sauce, on asparagus and onion medley.  My least favorite dish of the night.  Probably would be great if you just had this with a light salad for a starter but amidst all the strong flavors of the other dishes, this one paled.  It's subtle, cooked right and the halibut just flakes under your fork.  Mushroom Pizza with quail egg yolk in middle - I think egg yolks are nature's DessertsRhubarb Crumble with green tea ice creamDoughnutsService was impeccable from beginning to end.  Food was delicious.  And this is one of my favorite restaurants in the city right now.",3,0,3,Mog C.,"Hoboken, NJ",172,411,92

Whatever it was, it was love.Everything about ABC Kitchen reveals all the thought and care that was put into making this place a reality. Yes, those quirky mismatched plates and cutlery - someone made special care to put those there. Every twist of a tree trunk and setting of a table is there for a purpose, and that same perfectionist philosophy clearly goes into their food as well. Ingredients are sourced and prepared with a local and health-minded focus, though you wouldn't be able to tell as each indulgent meal arrives. Our party ordered a range of fish and pizza entrees, and each one had us saying ""Ooooo! Ahhh!"". My sea bass was delicious, though I must admit, as a stickler, it seemed a teensy smidge overdone. No matter, the interesting broth it is served in quickly brought out the flavours I craved and I finished that portion with great satisfaction.My only regret? Not having enough room for their ice cream (which I was eyeing with envy at the table next to us).

The crab toast was good, but not mindblowing.  The carrot and avocado salad is nicely spiced and interesting. Dessert was also quite good--donuts filled with caramel are worth the calories, and the sundae has a nice combination of sweet/salt and the popcorn gives it an interesting consistency. The weak link was the cocktails. The Green House grew on me, but the first sip was a bit unpleasant. The Vodka Thyme Lemonade is refreshing, but I wouldn't order it again.

Chicken liver toast rivals Spotted Pigs.Down sides to the restaurant however were the lobster (lackluster and slightly overcooked), sauteed greens with garlic (overcooked, i don't like mushy babyfood veg), and donuts (not cooked to order).Given all that though, I would absolutely go back as there are 5+ items on the menu that I would still like to try.And as far as a Jean Georges experience goes, it's very reasonable.",1,0,1,Jack L.,"New York, NY",116,112,0
5.0,4/26/2010,"A must try! After hearing about ABC Kitchen opening and since it was in the neighborhood a friend and I decided to try for dinner on a Wednesday evening. The atmosphere was really nice, calming even with the wooden bar / table area, white decor. At 7pm the bar area was not crowded (by the time we left it was packed), there are several tables and plenty of chairs, next time I would probably sit in the bar area for drinks and light snacks. The main dining room continues to feel airy, modest amount of space between tables. I did notice several very large round tables that could easily accommodate a group of 8-10 people comfortably which is always good to keep in mind. On to the food and drinks though which are what will definitely have me coming back. The idea of the restaurant is ""green"" so everything was organic, sustainable and the theme was reflected across the majority of the menu. For drinks I had a vodka thyme lemonade which I could have easily had multiple of, just the right balance of sweet and tangy. For dinner my friend and I shared a few things to try as much as we could and we were more than pleasantly surprised (and full)! In addition to the warm bread and olive oil we had the heirloom bean salad (served warm, beans were cooked perfectly, bordered almost having a little too much vinegar, but with the bread was okay), the roasted carrot and avocado salad (a must-order per our waiter) and the pretzel crusted calamari with basil aioli.  The calamari was some of the best I had ever had, perfectly crunchy outside, tender inside and not the overwhelming oil / fried taste, was not greasy in the slightest. I thought I would be underwhelmed by the carrot salad (because really its carrots) but was surprised by the depth of flavor (cumin definitely) and the dressing gave it a good amount of acidity. Another dish I would order again. For entree I ordered the Halibut with asparagus and citrus emulsion. The fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce did not overwhelm the halibut. Finally for dessert we shared the sundae which was made with salted caramel ice cream, creme fraiche and candied popcorn. The ice cream sundae was a perfect conclusion to our meal, even though there was no way we could finish it. As a whole all of the food is really great and even pretty to look at (we do eat with our eyes), the portions are generous. Of course it is still not an in expensive dinner. All in for the two of us, which included two drinks a piece came to $160.

Yum).  We followed with a special of ricotta cavatelli (ricotta in the pasta) with fava beans, green peas, and snap peas - delicous, delicious! and the special burger of the day, which was topped with soft goat cheese, pickled jalapenos, bacon, and a tomato jam. Sigh again, scrumptious. My friend is pregnant, and the chef was kind enough to cook the burger through without drying it out - we were so grateful that the flavor wasn't lost.   And beside, my rhubarb-juice, elderflower liqueur, and sparkling wine cocktail was lovely and not anywhere as sweet as I worried it might be.  Please, please, other restaurants - follow this example and showcase vegetables in such beautiful ways! They are such a delight when prepared with care and creativity. All those folks who say they don't like veggies should really try these before they give up forever.

3.0,4/14/2010,"In honor of Linda's return from a six-month stint in Hong Kong, we made plans to catch up over dinner at Jean-Georges Vongerichten's newest restaurant, ABC Kitchen.Upon entering the space that formerly housed ""Lucy's Latin Kitchen,"" I was astonished by the interior transformation.  ABC Kitchen felt more in-line with its neighbors, ABC Carpet & Home and Pipa: stark-white walls, metallic decorative accents, exposed piping and a structured lattice wood ceiling, modern chandeliers and lighting, tables of various sizes and a large overall space.Being the perpetual ""early bird,"" I arrived at ABC about 15-minutes shy of our 6:30pm reservation.  Despite the fact that Linda was still en-route, I asked all three of the hostesses if I could be seated since the restaurant was nearly empty.  I was told that they weren't allowed to seat incomplete parties, and that I may instead grab a stool at the bar.  Midway through enjoying my homemade basil-lime soda (sans ice, of course), Linda arrived and we were immediately led to our dinner table.  Each place setting was dressed with cardboard-bound menus and non-matching, shabby-chic silverware and floral-printed bread plates.Upon perusing ABC's menu, Linda noticed that, on the back, there was a listing of all of the local purveyors that the restaurant uses to source its fresh meats, fish, dairy, fruit and produce.  In an effort to taste more of the menu items, Linda and I decided to split two entrees: Whole Wheat Bigoli  (pasta) with a Berkshire Pork Ragu, and a whole-wheat pizza topped with black-trumpet mushrooms and a fried egg.  After the server took our order, we were presented with a basket of thick-sliced, fresh country bread, a dish of olive oil (for dipping), and a small bowl filled with magenta-pink French breakfast radishes.Approximately 15-20 minutes after we received the bread basket, our entrees arrived.  The whole wheat bigoli pasta noodles were thick and dense - our server actually informed us that they (the noodles) inherited their ample shape from being pulled through the meat grinder; the Berkshire Pork Ragu was a spicier, more robust play on traditional ""red"" spaghetti/Bolognese sauce - instead of ground meat, ABC's version was composed of relatively thick, chopped chunks of the prized swine;  the pasta was finished with a heavy accumulation of parmesan cheese.  Although I appreciated the fact that the noodles were homemade, I didn't feel that this type of pasta was a compatible match, in flavor and texture, to the pork ragu.  The bigoli's overwhelming density and bitter ""wheat"" aftertaste succeeded in unpleasantly overpowering its tomato-based sauce. Had it not been topped with such an abundance of black-trumpet mushrooms, the pizza would have been as close to ""perfect"" as a pie could be.  Luckily, my fork was all that was needed to take care of the problem!  After scooting many of the 'shrooms aside, I took my first bite of the warm pizza: the crust had a delicately charred bottom, and its (crust) weight fell precisely in between ""NY style"" and ""cracker-thin.""  Dried, almost curdled, ricotta cheese acted as a glue, of sorts, to the mound of mushrooms.  At the very center of the pie, a perfectly-cooked, sunny-side-up/fried egg took stage.  Its creamy yolk added a much-needed ""sauce""component to the otherwise arid ingredients.  In the essence of sharing, Linda and I decided to split the Meyer-Lemon Merignue Tart for dessert.  Served in the form of a slice as opposed to a traditional circle, the tart was almost too statuesque to eat.  While I would have preferred the crust to be heavier instead of thin and flaky (graham cracker? nuts?), the tang of the Meyer-lemon curd was beautifully cut by the sweet and creamy merignue.Aside from a few minor flavor hiccups, I enjoyed my meal at ABC Kitchen.  Since the restaurant is brand new, I'll bet that, within a couple of month's time, the menu will be much more streamlined and successful.  Otherwise, the space is gorgeous and the prices are right.  I have my fingers crossed that ABC plans to launch a brunch service in the near future.",2,1,0,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184

I only had room to taste their vanilla-chip ice-cream cake (which was glorious), but I am totally coming back for round II. The menu selections are ideally created for sharing. Portions are large enough for 2-3 people to get an adequate tasting of each dish. I loved everything that I tried (including the roasted carrot and avocado salad- and i don't even like carrots.) I highly recommend the peeky toe crab toast and the grilled pork chop.

5.0,4/8/2010,"Have you ever had a meal that literally made you simultaneously enraptured, sentimental, proud, reflective, and satisfied?  A dinner that amuses each of the senses in both familiar and untapped dimensions?  One that transports you to a not-so-long-ago time of digging holes in the backyard garden of your childhood home with a plastic shovel, tearing open packets of turnip seeds, and staring in awe at the beauty of the wedding band on your mother's hand speckled with topsoil, as she tenderly pats the ground tucking in the unborn vegetables?  A meal that makes your chest swell up that you were brave enough to cram your few belongings into a white rental minivan, and drive across the country with your kid brother to move into your very first New York City apartment to pursue your far-fetched dreams, even though every single thing that had ever brought you comfort was now in the thirsty midwestern dust cloud settling behind you?  A particular restaurant that you know exists no where else, and though thousands will plan entire trips around sampling its menu, for you it was only short ride from your apartment in a yellow cab, and for that you couldn't be more proud to live in this city of culinary creativity and brilliance?ABC Kitchen is the few-week-old restaurant in ABC Home, and newcomer in the trend towards being sustainable and green (even the menus are backed with pieces of recycled cardboard shipping cartons), featuring a market-driven menu that's just about as farm-to-table as you could get in the heart of such an urban giant.Our meal was beyond superb, offered something unique to each of the six friends gathered at our table, inspired wonderful conversation and laughter, and left each of us dumbfounded at the brilliance of cocktails, pressed juices, hors d'oeuvres, main plates, and sweet endings that wrapped us in the familiarity of a favorite blanket, yet inspired us to see those ingredients we've always known through a new filter of creativity.",2,0,2,Bradley H.,"Astoria, NY",115,146,1332
1.0,4/1/2010,"100% sure now we got food poisoning here.  We have narrowed it down the the raw shrimp.  My GF had it as an appetizer and I tried one or two.  I was a little rough for two days and she was destroyed over the same time period, missing 2 days of work.   I can't believe this can happen in a place like this.  JG was actually there that night.  PS, before I knew I was being literally poisoned, I still thought the entrees were only soso at best.  Admittedly my mackerel appetizer was pretty good. I hate this place with all my heart.",3,1,1,andrew s.,"New York, NY",0,68,1
4.0,3/26/2010,"interior is shabby chic just like abc.  staff was all really pleasant and our waiter was able to give very good comments/suggestions on a lot of the menu items. we had roasted carrot and avocado salad and clam pizza for app.  i got the carrot salad cuz i saw sour cream in the ingredients but i was really pleasantly surprised by the carrots. they were vinegared and sweet and went nicely with the avocado.  the bread for the pizza was good.  pizza good overall but i prefer the white clam pizza at pepe's.  clams slightly sandy but big meaty ones.  entrees got char and fat wheat spaghetti with pork ragu.  the char was great (as char always is) and was served over perfectly roasted regular and horny cauliflower. not a mindblowing entree but very solid.  i like the texture of wheat pasta tho it's not for everyone (not as gluten-y as regular pasta and has a bit of al dente texture) and the pork ragu was not heavy like i thot it'd be so it was an enjoyable dish.  dessert menu all looks delicious.  most everything has a slightly non-traditional ingredient twist to it.  we tried the salted peanut ice cream sundae with caramel popcorn. it was good for what it was but i think i actually wanted to eat cake with ice cream so it wasn't the right dessert for me that day.  they make their own sodas and i tried the tarragon root beer upon several staff recommendation. it's got the root beer flavor with a little more herb/licorice-y flavor.  it's good and not too sweet. nice casual, good meal.  i'd go here over maialino for similar vibe dining in same area.",0,0,0,C L.,"New York, NY",1,136,4
4.0,3/25/2010,"I'm hovering between 4 and 5 stars for this new Jean George resto. While it's a late foray into the green and sustainable initiative, ABC Kitchen is definitely a successful one. There's a bit of a rustic charm to this spot and a friendliness to the down-to-earth staff that is a refreshing change from JG's other restaurants. Every detail from the furniture to the dishes to the menu to the food has been taken into consideration.I sampled the dish listed as a ""Roasted Chatham Cod, Asparagus, and Citrus Emulsion."" Oddly, there was no asparagus (perhaps they ran out?). Instead, the cod with citrus emulsion was served with red bliss potatoes and spinach. Verdict? Delicious. The cod melted in my mouth like butter, and I could taste all of the ingredients. Unfortunately, they were out of the side of baked endive, so I shall endeavor to sample that on my next visit.For dessert, I ordered the pear bourdaloue tart, which was fine for a traditional tart - all in all, nothing too special. I did have a small sample of the sundae - salted caramel-peanut ice cream served with candied popcorn, whipped creme fraiche and chocolate sauce. That little taste was positively foodgasmic. I'd be back just to order that any day!Very impressive new digs, JG.",6,0,3,Jenn L.,"New York, NY",221,317,547
3.0,3/20/2010,"3.5 stars if it was a possibility. But since we can't go halfsies, there you have it. Reservation for 2 at 10pm on a Friday? Sure! I'll take it. We made the reservation on OpenTable a few days in advance, so I would recommend reservations, as I've heard they aren't liking walk-ins right now which is bizarre because at 11pm the restaurant was already emptying out...on a Friday! Work on that book, Jean-George.I love the locally-sourced, organic concept of the restaurant. Everything from the hand towels in the bathrooms to the bar coasters are organic and on the back of the menu, they have a small list of the purveyors of all of there ingredients which I love! Not only does it give the farmers recognition, but it is a huge CYA for the restaurant.We ordered cocktails at the bar and I was underwhelmed by those. $12 each, so standard price, but the Green Kitchen martini is green and has absinthe and was very different. Wouldn't order it again. Dining companion had the ginger-root something or other and it was really light and refreshing and I liked that better. We sat down at a fabulous table towards the back and ordered the pretzel-dusted calamari with basil aoili which is a must try and the carrot salad which sounds standard, but it was by far the best dish of the night for me.The clam pizza was AWESOME. Wood-fired i believe and so full of flavor. The sea bass was gross. Lacking flavor and the broth which I was hoping would add some moisture to a totally lackluster dish didn't help matters, it just added oil. Wouldn't do that one again.Dessert was far and away some of the best dessert dishes I've seen in NYC thus far and being an amateur baker, this says a lot...or maybe it says nothing. Regardless, the doughnuts with the blood orange marmalade and the Meyer Lemon tart were AWESOME! The pastry chef came from the Napa Valley and I'm so glad she is a part of our NYC pastry scene. The total bill (yes, i snuck a peek) with a bottle of wine, two cocktails, apps, entrees, desserts, tax, tip, smiles, handshakes, etc. was about $250. I think we got carried away, but the desserts, that amazing carrot salad and the fabulous, impeccable Jean-George service was fabulous. Also, I loved seeing Jean-George prance around the dining room to ensure his latest venture was doing it's thang correctly. It surely is.",1,0,1,Joleen Z.,"Seattle, WA",623,254,69
4.0,3/18/2010,"After finding our Irish roots in several Irish pubs in downtown Manhattan on Saint Patty's day, we decided we need to get some food that hasn't been overpriced for the drunks at the pubs. ($10 for mozzarella sticks at a pub! Seriously?!)The blood orange bellini was delicious (which I ""borrowed"" from my co-worker). The rest of my co-workers loveeeee the vodka thyme lemonade which I did not get to try. It's apparently one of their signature drinks.We waited about half an hour to be seated (group of 8). Then we had to wait almost 45 minutes to get our orders taken... I have to admit the service was kind of lacking there but I think they were letting our group settle down some more. I ordered the chili-herbed black sea bass. It was yum. (:I had the carrot cake for dessert but it was meh. The cream cheese frosting was little too sour for my taste. The warm apple crumb tart was a lot tastier but is it worth $8? ..not really.Apparently all the food are from local farms (within 250 miles?). Our table was a big piece of what we assumed to be a red wood trunk.  Decor is def. very chic and beautiful! :)4.5 star really. I would have given a 5 but all that waiting made me a very very hungry and sober Asian girl!",2,1,0,Lily M.,"Manhattan, NY",12,336,16
