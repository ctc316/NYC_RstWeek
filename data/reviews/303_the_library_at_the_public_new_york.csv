4.0,3/25/2019,"As we were coming home from our Philadelphia Flower Show Bus Trip on Saturday 3/9/19, we knew that a couple of us were going to The Public Theater to see some plays on 3/10/19 and wanted to meet up to have dinner before the 7pm show time. After thinking it over, I decided to check out The Library which is a restaurant within The Public Theater building. The pictures looked nice and the menu sounded good so I made the reservation....Easy as 1-2-3 via the open table app and a few minutes later we had a 5:45pm dinner reservation.We got to The PublicTheater, then got our play tickets at the box office from Will Call and proceeded to go upstairs to The Library. Pleasantly surprised were we to be surrounded by a sophisticated environment and view elegant yet simple decor all within this hidden away, interesting looking restaurant. Cool artwork from specific plays adorned the walls. Candles/lighting were along the tables and at the bar area. Kindly greeted first by the staff at the front entrance as well as those that placed our outerwear in the coat check section, we soon were interacting with a lovely hostess that led us to our dining table. The Server welcomed us and we placed our orders. Our burger entrees with french fries and salads tasted fresh and were filling. I could hardly believe that there was so much on the plate and I could not eat it all-lol. Although we felt full, we wanted to try dessert. However, it was also realized that there was no time for dessert as it was 6:50pm. We needed to get into our respective theaters before our plays (Cullud Wattah and White Noise) started with only 10 minutes to spare....thank goodness the theaters were only a flight of stairs away-lol. It is cool to know that The Library ensures that we as patrons are served in a timely manner, can enjoy entrees/cocktails/dessert, etc and do so all with additional time to get to your theaters before the actual plays are scheduled to begin. Public Theater Members receive 20% of their bill at The Library and we made sure to give a generous tip for being so accommodating. The next time we come to The Library we will have an entree/dessert/cocktails before or perhaps even after a play!",9,5,9,Alexis M.,"Brooklyn, NY",31,304,11066

4.0,1/31/2019,"Went here for restaurant week 2019. For Act I: Roasted Beets (with Apple, Goat Cheese, Hazelnuts) was a larger sized portion than expected. I'm not particularly drawn towards beet dishes, but it was seasoned well and the ingredients complemented each other well.   Taco al Pastor (Braised Pork, Guajillo Peppers, Roasted Pineapple) comes with 2 standard small tacos and included radish slices. The tacos were very delicious, certainly recommend.Act II: We tried the burger and trout options. Joe's Burger (Carmelized Onions, Bacon, Cheddar served with french fries). This burger melted in your mouth and the onions were a delicious addition. Recommend for anyone who loves a good burger. Waiter confirmed the level of redness that could be expected upon placing the order. Served with a generous portion of thin, crispy french fries. Recommend.Roasted Trout (Bean Cassoulet, Fennel, Orange, Haricot Vert) was a good sized filet over white bean cassoulet that was seasoned and flavored exceptionally. I was pleasantly surprised with flavor combination, slightly garlicky and salty, but not overpowering. Recommend.Act III: Gala Apple Crumble (Vanilla Ice Cream, Caramel) in agreement with all other reviews. This is a must-try. Warm apple crumble with silky, smooth soft serve is an impressive combination. Definitely recommend this dessert. Chocolate Walnut Cake (Malted Milk Crème Anglaisé) was essentially in between a chocolate brownie/cake with a few walnuts on top and the creme was sparsely drizzled on top. Wouldn't say this was anything special.Restaurant had a nice vibe and very attentive staff.",0,0,0,Kathrina M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0

4.0,4/12/2018,"Note: This review is a repost from 12/13/17 due to technical issues.I came here for a friend's birthday. She made reservations a few days in advance for a party of 6. You cross through the lobby of the Public Theater and up the stairs to the left to find a cozy, old school looking restaurant tucked away. Festive atmosphere. The walls are decorated with actors who have performed at the theater. Do note the bathroom is housed downstairs in the theater.Most of our party went with rose prosecco to start ($17), and I opted for the Smoke and Mirrors ($16), which was a mezcal drink blackened with charcoal and presented with a bell jar full of smoke. I hadn't expected something so dramatic, but it was tasty.The menu is organized into Acts (appetizers, other appetizers, mains, sides, and desserts). Most of the starters were in the high teens, and entree prices hovered around $30. If you're allergen sensitive, there are quite a few dishes with nuts.We had the beets ($18), burrata ($18), and calamari ($16) to start. The first was an exceptional value-- really big and great to share among a larger party. The burrata was beautifully plated but kind of small and unexceptional. The calamari was standard.For mains, several did fish and chips ($34) and were satisfied. I had the trofie mushroom pasta ($29). It was a normal, but tasty and hearty, pasta with mushrooms and parmesan.Service was great. They were accommodating of our party's needs, like a special glass of prosecco for the birthday girl and some very specific vodka soda orders. I had asked for my pasta to be boxed up since I didn't finish it, and it was accidentally thrown out-- I received multiple apologies and they ended up taking it off the check. That's doing it right.There was nothing particularly special about the food for me, and prices are high. However, the dishes were solidly executed and service was super. This was a good place for a group of girls to celebrate a birthday in style.",5,2,3,Liz S.,"New York, NY",952,772,1843
3.0,1/24/2018,"Library was cool, great drinks, ambiance more for a date or for catching up, than for seeing or meeting new ppl. Food was good, big portions, all the real menu choices even in the discounted restaurant week menu. Just that at the end, the waitress pretended we gave her a $50 bill less, so we can give more than a 30% tip. After we told her we knew there is an extra $50 bill because we had made fun of the bills prior between us,  looked in her pockets and then found the bill on her bill holder clipped all the way between the bill papers, so obviously she had put her there on purpose, why would she separate the bill from all the others?

The food was just 'OK.'

5.0,2/10/2017,We came here for restaurant week-(RW) located upstairs once you walk in (left side). Go up the stairs and take a slight left- feels like you're walking into the library. It's very quaint inside- I like the ambiance a lot- super cute place!!!I highly recommend this place to everyone! For RW I got the mussels for my app. The mussels came in a pretty decent bowl with some red tomato sauce and some toasted butter bread- DELICIOUS! I could have drank all of the sauce but I think the waitress was judging me. We asked her for more bread because the sauce was that good! For my entree I got toasted trout- I thought that was a pretty good choice! I tried some of my friends fish and chips and it was delicious as well. The food is not too salty- the flavoring was just right! For dessert I got the chocolate and vanilla swerve with pocky sticks - the ice cream was surprisingly not too sweet- loved this as well. Excellent ambiance and presentation- I would come back here even if it wasn't RW!I got the johnny rising drink (whiskey) - delicious!

3.0,11/28/2016,The staff was wonderful to us and for that I am thankful.  The designer drinks were delicious but the food was underwhelming.  Maybe because it was the day after Thanksgiving but my meal was terrible.  I had the pasta with the lemon mayer and crab and it was tasteless.I think in an effort to be original the food was just average.  My husband had a vegetarian dish for $30 dollars that was totally underwhelming.  I should have gone with my original plan and go to Indochine across the street.  The soft serve dessert was nice but nothing to go back.,0,0,0,Dee J.,"Manhattan, NY",4,68,1

4.0,8/13/2016,"My friend was visiting from out of town and suggested that we check out The Library at the Public for Restaurant Week. The day before our dinner date, I book reservation via OpenTable. The Library is nestled in a building that also contains Joe's Pub. When we arrived there was nobody in the lobby. It was a little difficult to find, but then we saw the big ""Library"" on the way and made our way up the stairs. We were greeted by the hostess who was very nice and promptly seated us. For the Summer 2016 Restaurant Week, The Library offer a section of items that are on their regular menu. I am assuming the portion sizes are smaller to accommodate the RW prices. Looking at the menu the prices are very pricey. Also, I felt like the portions were rather small. For an appetizer we both started off with the wild Maine mussels (Spanish chorizo & Rosé). They were abnormally big which made me question what type of mussels these really were!!! I've never gotten mussels that big before... Other than that, it was delicious and had a great broth. For an entree I was debating between the roasted chicken (with zuchinni pesto & summer squash) or the grill flat iron steak (with frites and a small salad). Our waitress recommended the roasted chicken, so I went with that while my friend opted for the flat iron steak. My chicken was delicious. It was succulent - not too try and the pesto sauce added a nice kick to it. The summer squash was also great, it was in season and not bitter. My friend commented that she really enjoyed the flat iron steak too, although she had asked for medium rare it was more on the rare side. Next up was dessert. We both ordered the chocolate walnut cake (with malted milk crème anglaise). It tasted great, but the portion was SO super small. It was almost like not even getting any! I wish they would have cut a slight bigger portion to make you feel like you got your monies worth. All in all the experience was great. Our waitress was lovely. She was super friendly, not to overbearing, and checked on us just enough times to be helpful without being annoying. And our bottle water on the table was always plentiful. The regular prices are a bit out of my normal dining budget, but I did highly enjoy my meal and ambience of the experience.",0,0,0,R C.,"WALL STREET, NY",0,55,18
4.0,8/10/2016,"Came here for Summer Restaurant Week 2016.Overall my experience was very nice, the atmosphere was great, the server was lovely and knowledgeable, and the food was good.  The food wasn't out of this world (hence 4 stars out of 5) but it was decent and something I would come back and get again - but not at full price.Portions were small, which I'm not sure if that's because of RW or not, but I feel the portion sizes aren't worth the actual prices on the menu.Our group had the Beets, Mussels, and Crostini appetizers.  The Mussels were the winners here, and the rest were decent.  For entrees we had the Skate, Steak, and Fish and Chips.  The Skate was good, but the sauce was weirdly sweet with the corn.  The steak and the Cod was cooked perfectly - it was some of the best Fried fish that I have had.  For dessert I highly recommend the Strawberry Crumble or the Walnut Cake.  The Crumble with Ice cream was huge and the walnut cake was small - but it tasted like a delicious walnut brownie.  It was so good. The seats were extremely comfortable and overall a very nice RW experience.",2,0,1,Jennifer D.,"Brooklyn, NY",703,113,132
2.0,8/3/2016,"Restaurant Week 2016 Review: When I leave a restaurant after Restaurant Week, I always ask myself: Would I go here again for the full price? I would not go to The Library at The Public for full price, much less for RW again. We felt that the price we paid barely justified the food we recieved, and the service was ""meh."" We left feeling sad that we just spent around $140 (includes 2 glasses of wine, tip) for the food/experience. The entire dinner took a little over two hours. At times, I think our waitress completely forgot we were there. She was super nice, but by the end of the meal we just wanted to get out of there and go home! There was about 30-40 minutes between each course. The food was ok but I feel like I could have recieved the same meal, if not better, at a different place for half the price tag. I did really enjoy the heirloom crostini and the crumble - but the steak entrees were cold and the salad was depressing. For anyone that has nut allergies (the person I went with did): nut-free options on the RW menu were extremely limited. A few items did not have nuts listed as one of the ingredients but included them. Obviously you can ask for them to leave nuts out but wish the menu would have been more clear about which items had nuts in them. For example, out of the four dessert options, only one does not have nuts (the ice cream). As a side note: the place kind of looks like a library, but if the place wasn't named ""The Library"" you would not assume that was the look they were going for. What we (2 of us) ordered: Act 1: beet salad (has nuts, ask to be taken out) , heirloom tomato crostini (has nuts)Act 2: steak fritesAct 3: ice cream swirl, crumble (nuts)",0,0,0,Maia H.,"New York, NY",182,125,83

3.0,2/16/2016,"Came during RW 2016 with an unusual set up for their RW menu in that they left the price tag on the menu, a bit unusual but perhaps a ploy to get people to feel like they got their money's worth? Great ambiance - lovely space. While service was good, they were rushing my friend and I through dinner because there was an event here. I don't particularly like being rushed but they also were semi-subtle about it. All in all, you be the judge: we finished a 3 course dinner in an hour. Crispy Calamari, Shishito Peppers, Chipotle Aioli: I really enjoyed it, but not a crazy standout dish. Big enough to share between two people. The Chipotle Aioli sauce was good though. Grilled Hanger Steak, Creamed Kale, Carrots: Fairly good. Now if I paid $38 dollars for this, I would not be very happy about it. However, since it was part of the RW deal, it was semi worth it. Hanger Steak was cooked pretty well ( I asked for Medium Rare on the Rare side, which is a precaution I usually take since most places will overcook it otherwise.) However, when the star of your steak dish are the creamed kale and carrots, it may not necessarily be worth nearly $40 dollars. However, all it all it was pretty tasty. Chocolate Walnut Cake: Pretty good, but nothing amazing. I enjoyed my time here but I don't necessarily believe it is worth the money on the menu. However, RW menu was pretty good.

4.0,2/8/2016,"i came here with a group of 6 for restaurant week 2016. its definitely in a weird spot, you have to go upstairs to the second level of this large event space. the restaurant itself is super cozy and really does feel like you went back in time to an old library. for Act I we ordered calamari, beet salad, butternut squash soup and burrata. the portions were very generous considering it was off the restaurant week menu. the calamari was seasoned perfectly and came with a great chipotle dipping mayo. the beets and soup were also super tasty and colorful. the only miss was the burrata, it was served with apple slices, shaved celery and walnuts. it was just kind of a random mish mosh. the burrata itself was very good. Act II, the majority of us got the grilled hanger steak with creamed kale and carrots. the portion of hanger steak was a bit underwhelming, but cooked nicely. oh and the creamed kale was so yummy! i want to make at home!Act III, all of the desserts were delicious. i got the apple crumble, it was warm and reminded me of my mom's apple crumble. i do wish it had a bit more crumble. the cheesecake and chocolate walnut cake were also very good. the only reason i did not give this place 5 stars was due to how pricey the booze was. the cheapest bottle of pinot noir was $60 and it was very very mediocre.",3,1,2,Christina G.,"New York, NY",323,458,565
5.0,2/8/2016,"Had a great experience here for restaurant week.  The place is in a strange large event venue but when you walk upstairs to the actual restaurant it really feels like you are in a library - think dim lighting, books on shelves, and big leather chairs.  Went to get a drink at the bar while waiting for my friends to arrive.  The bartender was super friendly and they had a great drink list.  I got ""The final derby"" which had four Roses Whiskey, Honey, Lemon, Grapefruit Soda and was so tasty and refreshing !! Great recommendation by the bartender. Next onto dinner... We started with the beet salad and the calamari both very LARGE portions which was surprising for restaurant week.  I loved the beets they were marinated perfectly and the calamari was also pretty tasty.  I ordered the steak for my main, served with creamed kale and carrots.  It was cooked to my liking and salted just right.  On to dessert... the APPLE CRUMBLE was so good.. HUGE pieces of apple still a little crispy and the portion was so large enough to share for three, I would have only wished for a little more crubmble and ice cream but that could be my sweet tooth talking :) .  I also tried the ricotta cheesecake which was SO GOOD and light.  Last but not least, the walnut chocolate cake was also good but the two prior trumped it for sure.  I would recommend this place for a date or if you are in the east village area wanting a good dinner !!",1,1,1,Lauren A.,"New York, NY",237,239,442

We had a 9pm rez, came at 9 exactly, and they said to ""wait by the bar and have a drink and we'll come get you in 10 minutes""... Quite the obvious up sell. But I'm glad they did because I ordered the Rosemary shrub drink and it was perfect! Like a fruity refreshing mojito. The ambiance is very ~romantic~, they have a bunch of those date type booths, luckily me and my Yelp mooching boy toy sat next to the date type booth and got the entertainment of watching the couple next to us in the date booth take full advantage.

Not to mention, there were several (several!!!) other open tables in which customers could have been sat. The dining experience was fine. The service felt rushed.

5.0,8/13/2015,"** NYC Restaurant Week Summer 2015 Review ** We arrived very early but they were nice enough to seat us anyways (I think this is a trend for us!). The Library's Restaurant Week menu offers three courses divided into three ""Acts"" - just like a play. I thought this was really cute and clever of them. Act I, the appetizers, offered five options. Act II, the entrees, had four options. And lastly, Act III, had three dessert options. I was pleased to notice that their RW menu features items that are on their regular menu. For Act I, I opted for the Burrata with green market vegetables. The burrata was very nice - moist and stretchy. I just wished that there was more! The Boyfriend had the Crispy Calamari with shishito peppers and chipotle aioli. The portion size was huge and this appetizer is definitely made to be shared! The calamari was crispy and crunchy - fried perfectly. The best part was the chipotle aioli, which was super tasty. For Act II, I had the Flat Iron Steak Frites with bitter green salad and Maitre D'Butter. The steak was cooked perfectly to my requested medium rare. The best part, though, was the huge portion of fries that we were able to share. It felt like they were never ending! The Boyfriend chose the Steamed Branzino with Madras curry and summer vegetables. For Act III, I had the Vanilla and Chocolate Soft Serve with Pocky sticks. They had me at the Pocky sticks! The ice cream was such a huge portion ice that I couldn't finish it. The Boyfriend had the Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble with Vanilla Soft Serve. His dessert was also huge - it's definitely shareable between 2-3 people at least. The crumble was served warm, which contrasted nicely with the vanilla ice cream. But alas, we were too full from dinner to finish it. Service was attentive and our waitress was super nice. I must compliment the Library for serving their regular menu at regular portion sizes for Restaurant Week. A lot of places often create items that aren't on the menu or downsize items that are on their menu for Restaurant Week.

The dessert was probably the highlight of the meal and the portion was very large (not complaining just stating the fact)The drink menu was interesting but the one that stood out to me was the NY strip infused bourbon.  It tasted like an old fashioned with a buttery finish.  I rather enjoyed it as it reminded me of the homemade bacon infused bourbon that I experimented with.Overall decent meal as the service was friendly but inconsistent (made a few mistakes and timing on serving the food was off but nothing that spoiled a dinner among friends.)",1,1,1,David Y.,"New York, NY",311,121,13
2.0,7/25/2015,"Food was delicious and the library decor was cool but the reason I am subtracting stars in this review is because the clashing music was so obtrusive that it ruined much of the experience. Why in a supposedly ""classy"" and ""literary"" atmosphere would you have brain-dead rap music and Rhianna blaring over the speakers. It didn't fit the atmosphere nor the clientele. Well at least we were hoping to experience some awesome live music downstairs in Joe's Pub afterwards but they cancelled the show due to an alleged ""sewage"" pipe bursting in the building. Hmmmm not sure I want to eat in a restaurant that has raw sewage pouring out everywhere. The server was also rude and condescending. Right from the beginning you could tell she was disappointed that only one of us ordered an alcoholic beverage. (Since we were planning to drink in the show at Joe's Pub which has a two drink minimum) The look on her face basically said ""I guess I won't be getting a big tip since you're not ordering drinks.""

5.0,4/11/2015,"I feel like I stole something. I knew getting the rush tickets to Hamilton were a long shot, so I figured that I'd make the best of the trip by grabbing a bite to eat while I was there. The drawing started a bit after 5 PM and the Library opened at 5:30 sharp so my timing was excellent. Lovely, dimmed decor with a straight up speakeasy for food vibe. Regardless of getting there early, make a reservation if you want a table. Though the bar has to be the most comfortable arrangement I've sat at in my life. I took advantage of the coat check but with the sheer size of the comfy as all get out stools, I didn't need to. Nobody else did. I could spend another paragraph raving about the stools and the hooks under the counter for your purse, but I won't. Suffice it to say I couldn't have been more comfortable if I'd sat at a table in the dining room. I'm never going to turn down a cocktail named for a Salt-n-Pepa song. Never. It was the better of the two, I also had the Stay Puft Effect. If you're thinking "" A Stay Puft Marshmallow Man cocktail!!!! This is going to be awesome!"" Let me stop you right there. There is no marshmallow nor a facsimile there of. That said, it was nice and strong, which is what any $15 cocktail should be at least. Now here is where I feel like I got away with burglary. Who's the lucky chick that comes on Restaurant Week and doesn't even know it?!? ::points thumbs at chest:: For 35 bucks I got three sizable ""acts"" for a pittance. A pittance I say! Act I - Rock Shrimp Tacos, Guajillo, Avocado & Queso - $12I've since given up on shrimp (I won't gross you out as to why), and this was the best send-off ever. I don't even like avocado! It was delicious. Act II - Grilled Pork Chop, Greens & Beans, Tomato Sofrito. - $32This is the price of admission. This is the curtain call. This is the standing ovation. There. I've gotten all the theater similes out of my system. I'm usually not a fan of straight up tomato on anything, but a little bit of sofrito with a little bit of seriously excellent greens (hidden under the pork chop in the photo. I could have eaten a whole bowl, thank you!) and a juicy, perfectly cooked and seasoned cut of pork chop is heaven. Thanks for asking how it is, Ms. Bartender, but can't you tell by my blissed out expression? I think my pupils were dilated. Act III - Salted Apple Crumble, Vanilla Soft Serve - $9They even upgraded me from mere soft serve! Way too big for a single person. Grab someone off the street to finish this for you. Very good.The service is outstanding. I had to leave mid meal to see if I'd won the drawing. I did not, but they let me leave and come back on the total honor system. Because if I were criminal minded, leaving after that delicious pork chop would have resulted in my snickering like Snidely Whiplash right out the door. All that for 65 bucks.

Arrive no later than 15 min. for your reservation or you will most likely lose it to others.The food wasn't bad, although not great enough that I would come back not during restaurant week. I think this place is better for pre-theater/post-theater drinks. I tried my friend's Peach Rosemary shrub and it was really light and fruity, somewhat herbaceous from the rosemary.Appetizers:Crispy Calamari - A safe appetizer to order. The squid was crispy and well seasoned.Shrimp Tacos - On the small side. Not too much shrimp in each tiny tortilla, but the flavor was good.Entree:Lancaster Chicken and Dumplings - The chicken thigh for this was so dry, but luckily the sauce was savory and creamy enough to make the dish palatable. The one large dumpling reminded me of German potato dumplings and was much more delicious than the chicken itself. Flat Iron Steak Frites, Maitre'D Butter - I should have ordered the steak, but didn't because I thought it would be too boring. I was wrong. The steak was perfectly seared and extremely juicy. The shoestring fries that came with it were cold, but still addicting, because fries just are.Dessert:Chocolate and Vanilla Soft Serve, Pocky Sticks - Just plain soft ice cream, but it was a good palate cleanser in between the heavier desserts.Chocolate Olive Oil Cake - Somewhat unctuous and oily as expected. I'm glad it was chocolate, because if it wasn't I probably wouldn't have liked it as much. The texture wasn't the greatest out of the olive oil cakes I tried before (which isn't very many).Sea Salt Apple Crumble - The best thing of the night. If I returned, it would be for this perfect warm apple crumble. The quantity they give for this is huge too.One complaint about service is our waitress kept on taking away our plates even before we were finished. I guess one course is fine, but she did that for appetizer, entree, and dessert. It was very sneakily done. We were all immersed in our conversation and poof the food was gone.

4.0,2/23/2015,"What an amazing night of great food and fun . The truth about The Library is that it's a hidden gem. To be honest, when you enter the place you might think you've arrived at the wrong place. To my surprise, The Library is but one destination within this massive factory like building. The building houses several art and theater shows throughout the year. The Library is on the 2nd floor and now armed with this information, you won't have to look lost like me.Now on to the food. First of all, the menu is   very extensive and put together with great consideration for the customer. I haven't seen a menu with such variety in a long time. I had the rock shrimp tacos and for my main course I had a chicken dish with potatoes. The chicken was superb and the sauce was absolutely delicious. To top it off, I had the apple crisp for dessert and man was that scrumptious. I came here for restaurant week and honestly, I probably would not have come here unless there was a restaurant week but I'm so glad I did. The service was excellent and he vibe of this space is comfy cozy indeed. I plan to return for drinks and dinner very soon.

3.0,2/4/2015,"We went here for a quick bite before watching a show in the Public Theater.Just like other restaurants near theaters, and this one was in the theater, the server will ask if you are watching a show.  And they will suggest which dishes to order based on your available time.  And they make sure you get your food on time for you to eat leisurely and catch your show.So we ordered the fries which are cut thinly and crispy served with a nice tangy malt vinegar mayonnaise; crispy calamari lightly battered with a nice spicy chipotle sauce; and farmer's cheese with sesame crackers -- particularly liked the thin sesame crackers.  All of them were good considering that they are inside a theater (and tucked at the back of the second floor -- not visibly seen from the lobby) so I had the impression that only people watching a show will dine here.  I guess not.The service was ok -- good in the beginning but slowed down a bit when the place got packed.  The hostess was great by telling us that we can get our coats after the show --  because the coat check for the main theater was so long that it saved us a lot of time.I will probably dine here again if I'm watching in this theater.",1,1,1,MJ B.,"Hoboken, NJ",1,160,2

There was only one seat available- that's ok...we were getting a quick drink. The bartenders were preoccupied, seemed to be over working that night, and swigging water while congratulating each other on getting through most of the night.The shorter bartender took our order. I asked for sparkling. He quizzed me on if I wanted champagne or prosecco. Um, I asked for sparkling, I would ask for champagne if I wanted champagne. Whatever, Josh, just move on and get your drink.The bartender forgot about our drink for about 8 minutes. Was standing and talking with the taller bartender. I attempted to wave the bartender down to politely remind them we were waiting for two (2) glasses of sparkling. He then mockingly waved me back and asked me what I wanted.THIS. REALLY. IRRITATED. ME. I get it. It's New Years and people are high maintenance- especially in an establishment that boasts hosting somewhat stuffy art/theater people or people who think they are...but come on, dude. Don't be an ass.The shorter bartender apologized for forgetting and offered to comp one drink for us. Nice gesture, but not what we were looking for.

The Shrubs cocktails (herbal infused sugar and water mix with added liquor) featured on the menu are refreshing but I felt needed more of a kick especially with the ice filled glass. Ordered off their restaurant week menu and the calamari well seasoned and crispy but not oily-superb! I really liked the branzino entree served with coucous and spinach in a terracotta dish.

Shrimp tacos seem to be a lot of Yelpers' favorite, but I thought it was just slightly above average and heavy-loaded with too much veggies.

To get to this restaurant, you have to go inside the public theatre and up the stairs. When you arrive at the restaurant, it has this sophisticated library feel. I loved it. We arrived at 6:30PM, which was a half hour later than our original reservation due to traffic, but the staff was totally ok with it and appreciated that we called to let them know. We also mentioned we had a Broadway show to attend and had to leave by 7:15. The staff was SO SO ACCOMMODATING and AWESOME! They were worried we wouldn't have time to do the restaurant menu, but we did. The waitress and the chef were awesome. I do not know the waitress's name but she is a girl with short strawberry blonde hair up to her ears/shoulders, and she was so so helpful. She made sure we had our food brought out almost immediately and she let the chef know we had to leave by 7:15 and we were literally out of the door by 7:12PM! I cannot tell you how grateful I am to the staff for being so accommodating and not lacking in their service. They are wonderful. The food is great. We had the calamari and shrimp tacos for appetizers. The calamari was fantastic - one of the best I had. My sister and I were not a fan of the shrimp tacos. For the main course, I had the branzino, and my sister had the Rigatoni. Both were fantastic dishes - very delectable. For dessert, I had the chocolate cake and my sister had the summer berry crumble - both great desserts. They knew it was my sister's birthday and even stuck a candle in the dessert - a great touch.

Each part was divided up into act 1, act 2, and act 3. It was a fun little play on it since the building hosted shows too. For my act 1, I chose the calamari with shishito peppers. It wasn't overwhelmingly spicy and it was served with a nice aoili sauce. My friend ended up going with the arugala salad with pear. It was incredibly fresh. Both appetizers were incredibly large portions that were enough to be an entree for one person. For the act 2, we both got the rigatoni with veal bolognese. Yet again a huge portion, it was piping hot, and tasted delicious. There wasn't an overwhelmingly large portion of veal, so it wasn't too meaty and blended well with the pasta and vegetables. For dessert, we both got the berry crumble served with soft serve. Large portion! It was amazing. I'm so glad that I went here for restaurant week because it has been the best so far.

Not The Library. Honestly I'm so glad I found this by chance scrolling through the list of available venues. This takes you away from the city and the atmosphere makes you forget that you're jam packed in a city full of loud crazies where the hustle and bustle is the norm. As soon as I walked in, I mistakenly headed towards Joe's Pub and the host graciously escorted me to the proper entryway. I felt so posh just walking in because the dim lighting, set up, and decor were absolutely splendid. Drinks (shrubs) were strong (always a plus), service was very attentive and nice, dishes were cooked to perfection. I was actually full by the end of the three courses! I ordered the calamari, steak frites (which came with a nice salad), and panna cotta. My friend ordered the shrimp tacos, steak frites as well, and the berry crumble. We were amazed and repeatedly stated our positive sentiments about the turnout and the table next to us happily agreed. The only sad parts were that they were out of their tiki drinks and that the tables on the side of the room were slightly closer to each other than I would have liked (couldn't help picking up bits and pieces of conversations from tables on both sides of us haha) :( Nothing to deduct a star off for though.

The pieces were plentiful and fried to perfection.The steak frites were served with a sleeve of well done shoestring fries with a side of mayo and ketchup. On the main plate were a side of greens in a mild vinaigrette next to a five inch long piece of steak that was wonderfully coated in a flavorful herb butter. Each bite was consistently great. For dessert, a hot plate of berry crumble with vanilla soft serve. Nothing else to mention. It was an epic finish. For drinks, their shrubs are great.

Cocktails are mind blowing. Low lighting and antique gilded library decor sets a great dining experience. My only complaint is that for some reason every dish we ordered (we ordered a total of five dishes among us and all very different from each other) was too salty. Maybe the chef was heavy handed with the salt that evening because I have had friends who have gone and did not experience this.

Service is as great as the food.  One of my favorites, being the rigatoni with sausage and broccoli rabe and chick pea which makes a not too rich combination and a starter of the calamari and shishito peppers.  The Dandy Riot cocktail is a must with Rye. Makes me feel I am actually living back in the prohibition days somehow.",0,0,0,Karys S.,"New York, NY",0,1,0
3.0,2/22/2014,"I think this place gets overall 4 stars because of its ambiance, drinks, and performances at Joe's Pub. The latter two which bf and I didn't experience much on a busy Friday at restaurant week. The restaurant offers the entire menu for RW, which makes it one of the better deals around. Sadly, the food is not well known even some dishes were pretty good. None were really that standout though, and some really tanked.  Not to mention the service was really off- BOH, FOH confusion, mistaken orders, skimping on appetizers....our waitress was sweet and prompt. She did the best she could.   For appetizers we shared the shrimp tacos and calamari. Calamari was above average- nice aioli, not too greasy, shishito peppers it came with cold have been better.  Tacos  really stunk. Flavor less, cold, and totally uninspiring. Not to mention that since we were ""sharing"" I'm pretty sure we got one less but I'm not sure.   I thought i saw others with 3 and somehow we got 2... Oh well. I guess we were not missing out much. Bf had the steak frites for dinner.  This was more like frites with steak given the massive amount of shoestring fries (tasty though) and teeny tiny amount of steak. The cheap tasting hanger steak was a notch about sizzler at best, anyway.  Fortunately , I had better luck with the house made rigatoni, sweet sausage, rapini and chickpea. It's heart, tomato sauce based dish was delicious and I have no complaints. Portions were also big. Desert might have been our best course (though they thought bf ordered the apple crumble as they firstly brought out the wrong dish).  He ordered the sundae- came with toasted  coconut and chunks of rum cake. Creamy and delicious. I had the chocolate pancetta. It was but not as good as the traditional. It creatively used with soaked cherries and creme fraiche which made it super rich and delicious. We didn't get a bread basket thought I was thinking we should have like the tables around us!All in all, great food but the wow factor is missing.  I don't know if I'd come back.",2,0,0,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",878,1242,25

The pork chops were dry, flavorLESS, and I have no clue what was going on with the polenta that came with the pork chops. Worse. Pork chops. Ever. On the other hand, the steak was DE-LISH! The dessert was good, but it was nothing special. The sundae and apple crumble looks like something that can easily be made at home. What I am paying for is the atmosphere. Gosh, I am such a nerd sometimes. It was like I was eating in a library. It felt surreal. That yellow glow and cross-stitch leather couch just made me wanna stay all night and talk.

2.0,2/8/2014,"5 stars for ambience (which all the reviews mention).3 stars for cocktails & drinks (and if you read the reviews, most kudos are for that).1 star for food and service.Perfect example of 'know your audience.' And the team that runs this (also run The Dutch, Lafayette & Locanda Verde) doesn't.The food should also match the decor, and it doesn't.This is a gorgeous space that should cater to those attending plays and events at the Public Theater, a non-profit theater, & shows at Joe's Pub. Instead they've created a menu that caters to the chef's ego at a fine dining price point.Unfortunately, the food doesn't appear on the table in a coordinated fashion, but they do get you out in time to see your show, and you will often see stars in there before or after they see shows at the Public.You go in there on a cold winter's afternoon & want soup & a glass of wine, but there is only 1 soup (there was none the last time i tried this).If there is no late show at Joe's Pub, there is no food.I recommend the fries. The calamari is fine. The shrimp tacos are good, but there is hardly enough to share - it is a 1-person starter, and that is it.The rest of the food? Overpriced and average to below average.$9 for pickles may be fine uptown or in a 'fine dining' restaurant, but this is a place you want to go before or after the theater. It is highway robbery to try and pull that in this restaurant, no matter how much the NYT liked it.$13 for crudite with wasabi dip is even worse, considering there are hardly any veggies and if there is wasabi in the dip you can't detect it.$12 for 3 French cheese & walnuts? I asked whether it would serve 2, and it didn't. The 3 pieces of cheese were about 1/2"" by 1/2"". $18 for a burger? Even if it is amazing, it should be out of this world at that price in this neighborhood. It can't hold a candle to the $26 burger at Minetta Tavern, the $20 burger at the Spotted Pig or the $29 BLT burger.The plates and bowls are enormous, making the food look itsy bitsy. The salads are OK, but they look bizarre & out of place in the enormous plates.The sandwiches are hearty and a decent size.They've added some live music in the early evenings on some nights, but I can't figure out on which nights or why. The room isn't suited to it acoustically, which is unfortunate.The managers keep sending out e-mails to those who are attending shows at the Public, begging us to come to The Library for dinner before or after the show. We would if the menu were more appropriate to its surroundings, offered plates for sharing and had prices to match its patrons and location.

There was a moment where we didn't see the people, or the waitress, or anything.   The waitress didn't serve us because even she told us that she didn't see a thing.   The crudite appetizer was terrible with all that frozen vegetables, the wasabi dip was tasteless.

4.0,1/7/2014,"Who would have thought that a library could actually have such a cool spot hiding upstairs? A few friends invited me to join them for dinner at some place called the Library and it didn't occur to me that it was actually in a public library until I was entering the building. To get here, you go upstairs and pass this sad, dire looking cafeteria, so I was pleasantly surprised to walk into the charming restaurant lounge area instead. It was dimly lit, decorated with classic leather banquette chairs, old wooden tables and some bookshelves on the walls. It felt like you were walking into your grandpa's old office, but in a good way that felt comforting and familiar. We ordered a few cocktails to start - I loved their Shrub menu, which is just a list of unique fruity, herby and spicy cocktails developed by the different bartenders. The rest of the cocktails are named poetically like Any Way The Wind Blows or Remembrance of Things Past. The food menu is cleverly divided into acts, with dessert being the encore. For Act I, we shared the famous pickle plate, but be warned - this is not for the amateur pickle eater, pros only beyond this point. Luckily I am well versed in all things pickled, but my dinner mates discovered they didn't actually like pickled things enough so I ended up eating most of it myself. There's pickled everything - Green tomatoes, hard boiled eggs, carrots, okra, cauliflower. Act II was the charred octopus, which was deliciously tender and served with tasty fingerling potatoes. For Act III, I ordered the rigatoni with sausage, chickpeas and broccoli rabe, which was a nice rendition of a classic dish. My dinner mates ordered the pesto campanelle pasta, the lamb duo and the flat iron steak. I tried a bit of the lamb duo and it was divine! Minus points though for the snide waitress for scoffing at us when we ignorantly asked what haricot verde was (if you don't know either, I won't scoff at you - it's green beans. Not everyone speaks French!). For the encore, we shared the chocolate panna cotta, which was pretty good but nothing outstanding.

It is parts speakeasy (sans attitude) and restaurant (sans light), with artisanal and well-named cocktails as well as a full menu of robust protein entrees. Having arrived near midnight, it was about 70% full with a spattering of parties lining the walls and pairs gathered around the bar. Service was prompt and courteous, both for taking orders and for clearing our table; music selection was appropriately downtown but at conversation-enabling volume. Dimly lit so that candles were not unnecessary, but enough to make views a little fuzzy. You really get the sense that you're in someone's SALON, a la Paris, without the overly sourced interiors.

I sincerely appreciate that you forgot about my review and don't all swarm to the Library BECAUSE ....the Library is a hidden gem right in the heart of the village. Easily my new favorite lounge ! The ambiance is cultured without being pretentious, with dim lights, occasional bookracks, and posters of Shakespear in the park back in the 90s. A circle of lights with creamy  shades hang from the ceiling and define the main area of the floor. Deeper inside, you hear lighthearted, artsy, or witty conversations buzzing at the bar. Oh, almost forgot to mention the entrance- it is defined by a black iron grill door - just like those you find at old libraries. DRINKS--I LOVE the Shrubbs! the mixers are meticulously marinated in sweets or vinegar for days before they are served in your drink.

The cocktails were expensive, so I only ordered one, the Jersey Sling, and it was slow coming and below my expectations (too sweet). Started with Ruby Red Shrimp tacos and they were excellent, but only after I added salt to the shrimps. My main dish was the Orecchiette pasta with roasted cauliflower, pecorino romano, toasted pine nuts, parsley, and golden raisins. It was unique and very very good. I think some roasted garlic would have made it total perfection IMO. For dessert the chocolate Panna Cotta was excellent, replete with cherries, creme fraiche, and toasted pistachio. A real surprise ending. The nice thing about this place is that everything on the menu is totally recognizable, a rarity these days.

4.0,12/19/2012,"Just went last night to grab a drink and dinner with a friend.  The ambiance is great - very warm and comfortable (more dimly lit than the pictures on the website would imply).  It was a breeze to secure a (Tuesday) reservation the morning of, but did not mean it wasn't buzzing with people when we got there.  Our server was very friendly, eager to provide recommendations and attentive.  The drinks were very good, as you might expect, and our food was very enjoyable as well.  We shared the beet salad (good) and each got a pasta dish.  I got the orecchiette dish, which was pleasantly light and very flavorful - even got me to enjoy cauliflower.  My friend got the rigatone with broccoli rabe and sausage which was also very good.  Surprisingly light for a bolognese-type sauce.While the food was indeed good, I don't know that I would go here solely for it (not to say I wouldn't go back!).  It is a prime spot if what you're seeking is a place that serves great cocktails and good food without feeling too ""restauranty.""   The menu is also fairly accessible (price-wise) which is always a plus.",0,0,0,Lauren D.,"Arlington, VA",15,9,0
5.0,12/17/2012,"This is such a fun little restaurant-- I had a great dinner here!  The decor is warm and cozy (especially coming in from the harsh light of the lobby of the Public Theater).  Every seat was taken when I was there, but it wasn't hard to hear my friend at all, I always appreciate when a restaurant has good acoustics.   Of course the best part was the food!  We split the beet salad, the fall salad, the pulled pork sandwich, and the orecchiette.  Everything was delicious but we were both blown away by the light orecchiette dish!  Then we of course splurged on dessert (they have soft serve ice cream- very fun)  It's a great little gem of a restaurant- I will definitely be back!",0,0,0,Joey B.,"New York, NY",5,21,3
5.0,12/11/2012,"This place was amazing!  You feel like you are walking into the wrong place, since this is in The Public Theater.  Located on the 2nd floor you enter a classy room and begin your dining/drinking experience.  It seemed like an undiscovered gem and was not crowded at all.  The food was great and I would recommend trying a little bit from Act I and Act II, then ordering your own Act III.  Def worth a try!",0,0,0,Sarah T.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,32,1
5.0,12/5/2012,"You know...I must say.  At first, I was apprehensive.  WHAT?  A bar/restaurant within the confines of a theater?  I mean, how good can the food and drinks be, right?  Um, especially one named ""The Library""?And then, I was proven wrong.Last night a friend of mine and I ventured down to the Astor Place area to the Public Theater for a show.  He recommended that we try out the Library.  I hesitantly agreed, yes, even after looking at their very nice website.Upon arrival, we were seated immediately, even though we were a bit early.  Once seated, we were served water and provided menus expeditiously.  Promptly, the waitress came around to ask us for drinks, and I opted for the ""Bye Bye Albatross"".  How was this fancily named drink?  DELISH.  But be forewarned if you don't like licorice tastes.  It has absinthe.  But if you do, bottoms up.  It was very smooth and has a nice relaxing effect to it.  I don't know...maybe it was the absinthe?And for dinner, and because I had a decent lunch yesterday, we opted to share a few appetizers.  We first ordered the calamari, crab rolls, mushroom soup and shrimp tacos.Here is the verdict on the items above:-  Shrimp tacos - Simply WOW.  Tasty.  Perfectly seasoned.  -  Calamari - very light battered and out of this world.-  Crab rolls - good.  Not great.  Lacked a bit of seasoning.  But you can definitely taste the crab.-  Mushroom Soup - Phenomenal.  One of the best I have had.  Big chunks of shrooms and served with oil on top for an extra smooth taste.Now, having experienced such great food, we opted for one more small dish...the short ribs.  These short ribs were very succulent and fell of the bone.  Juicy delicious tender greatness.And the service was spot on.  She was very attentive and took great care of us, even when more people were seated at nearby tables.And to top it off?  Chris Sarandon was sitting at the table next to us.  What a great experience!",2,0,0,Jacob Y.,"New York, NY",184,466,120
1.0,11/16/2012,"The Library may be a good place for drinks assuming a) you bring a guide dog and b) your wants are limited to the incredibly overpriced wine or those liquors listed on the menu. What bar has only two vodkas--neither mainstream--and takes as long to produce a glass of one as they do to cook a burger? Service is awful although, in fairness, the burger as well as some of the pastas were not bad.",0,0,0,Mari G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0
4.0,10/12/2012,Went to the NYC Wine & Food Festival event last night. They're hosting several events to mark the re-opening of the new Public Theater.Love the renovated space! Now with The Library lounge people will come down even without seeing a show. Andrew Carmellini has a great menu and the cocktails are very good. I tried a couple of whiskey cocktails that I really enjoyed. I'd definitely come here for drinks and bites when I see a show.,2,1,1,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",227,1549,2438
