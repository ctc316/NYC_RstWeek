5.0,4/16/2019,This is one of our go to Italian restaurant in the neighborhood. The staff is super friendly. They've known our daughter since she was born and always make us feel at home. The food is always good. Our favorite are the tagliatelle bolognese and the spinach raviolis.,0,0,0,Marie C.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",0,5,0
5.0,4/10/2019,"I've been to this restaurant many times as it's in my neighborhood and I've been blown away with the food every time. The Branzino is probably my fav, but the salmon, all the pastas and breaded saffron rice balls appetizer were just as yummy! The ambiance at this restaurant is beautiful and the staff is super friendly and very informed on the best wine pairings for each dish. My fav Italian restaurant/wine bar by far in the downtown area!",1,0,0,Reena P.,"Washington, DC",81,2,0
5.0,3/18/2019,I ordered a steak to go which was delicious. A big peace of meat came with spinach and fantastic bread with olive oil. I refused on potatoes.

4.0,3/7/2019,"I passed by Felice multiple times a week but discounted it since I assumed it was just an average hotel restaurant. I came here on the recommendation of a friend. The restaurant is very large inside, very dimly lit, and accepts reservations. It's a great place to get together with a bunch of friends over good food, and a fun ambiance. We ordered the meatballs appetizer - super delicious, super saucy, great taste and texture. We also ordered the Linguine di Mare. The linguini noodles were a good texture, and there was plenty of seafood to last the whole dish! I wish that the sauce were slightly stronger/more flavorful but altogether the dish was really good! We also got the Fettucine alla Bolognese and this dish was SO good. Loved the red sauce, loved the veal, and the pasta really tied everything together. Would definitely come back for this Fettucine dish!",1,0,0,Amy F.,"New York, NY",201,73,115
4.0,3/6/2019,"My frirnd takes me here for lunch. It's a very adorable little place. The decor is simple and pretty. The food was great. We had the mussel appetizer. It was soft, sweet and melt in your mouth. Interested fettuccine alla bolognese was great. Perfect blend of meat sauce and pasta was definitely al dente.  My friend had pappardelle con salsissia - the sweet sausage was great as well. If I had one complain would be the amount of time it took for dishes to arrive.  We ran out of time and will have to try dessert another time. But definitely will come back.",0,0,1,Kathy W.,"Jersey City, NJ",5,74,196
4.0,3/4/2019,"For aesthetics alone, this place is 5 stars. You walk in and the walls are bookshelves with actual books on them and the walls are also lined with bottles of wine. Two of my favorite things in the world. The books are also removable, I may have fiddled with them because there is nothing I hate more than fake bookshelves. The wine was not removable. I came here for my company's Christmas party before the holidays and we had the entire top floor and private room to ourselves. It was really nicely set up. The bar had available a few wines and beers as well as open bar for us to imbibe in. I really enjoyed the red wine that was selected.Our dinner was first served with two rounds of appetizers. Not going to lie, I was almost pretty much full after the appetizer round. Veal meatballs, baked eggplant in tomato sauce, arancini, burrata, some kind of deep fried chickpea fritter. Not sure if I'm forgetting anything but all solid. Really liked the chickpea thing and the eggplant and meatballs. The arancini was alright but could be cheesier. For the next course we were given the option of penne in a tomato sauce or ravioli with spinach and ricotta in a brown butter sage sauce. Regrets on not going with the ravioli because the penne was just fine. For the secondi we had the choice of salmon and chicken milanese. I went with the salmon and it was perfectly cooked but again, regrets on not going with the chicken because that was the largest slab of meat I've seen in a minute. I tried a bite and it was super flavorful. Salmon was also very tender and nice. The shining star out of everything though was the desert. Everything was just a-okay tasting until I had the Tortino di Gianduia. Chocolate hazelnut cake surprise whatever. It tasted like I was eating a giant Ferrero Rocher ball. The gelato was also amazing tasting as I merrily ate away at my coworker's abandoned ice cream. I had a flight the next morning and couldn't move or breathe. Passed out like a fat baby. But will say, the shining points were the appetizers and desert for me.",6,2,4,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",843,1384,11457
4.0,3/3/2019,"Smallish location in the Financial District that was very quiet for a Valentine's Day lunch.  A date invited me and it definitely had the ambiance and intimacy you'd want for a date.  Service was top notch and the entree I had for lunch was really good and filling.  If asked again, I'd go back.",1,1,2,Monica T.,"New York, NY",235,1924,25
2.0,1/29/2019,"So this is an updated review.  We recently went for restaurant week and booked a table on open table which I had the email confirmation for.  When we arrived they had no record of our reservation, the hostess went to the get the manager and I showed her on my phone that we did have a reservation.  The manager came over and hemmed and hawed oh where shall I put you  while we stood there awkwardly, there was a table for 4 and he said well I can seat you there but if a larger party comes, blah blah blah, we were ready to leave and did I mention we live in the area and go there all the time? He should never have made this our problem.  He then made two tables for two out of the 4 top and we were seated.  I did joke that we would gladly sit at the large table for 6 he assured me that it was reserved and the party was coming at any minute, well they never came we ate and left and was still empty.  The food at Felice is great, I have no complaints, I had the crostini with ricotta and honey which was delicious and the chicken Milanese, I wish they would've had the lasagna on the special menu because that is delicious.  My Husband had the pappadrelle with sausage not so good.  The service that night was awful as well, almost like a skeleton crew was working.  The drinks are fabulous kudos to the bartender.   I think the manager needs to have a customer service training.  We will be back but not so fast.",0,0,0,Moe M.,"Manhattan, NY",5,72,3
5.0,1/13/2019,"Perfect date night spot. Great ambiance. Great food. Great Service. SERVICE. My girlfriend and I received the greatest service we've had in NYC. We arrived at Felice without reservations at 7pm on Saturday. The host had all of his tables reserved, but worked us in anyways. He gave us a larger table that was reserved at 8:15pm but made it clear we could stay until then or sit at the bar. We gladly took the table (btw, the host helped the couple before us in the same way, incredible service!). Then our server took care of us for the rest of the night. He gave us an incredible wine recommendation, was attentive without being disruptive, and our wine glasses were never empty. My gf and I split an entree and he pre-split it for us and brought it out on two separate plates without us asking (thank you!). AMBIANCE. The lighting was dim, the restaurant was a buzz with chatter from the other guests, but there was enough space that you didn't feel like you were on top of the other ppl. It's exactly what you want for a romantic date and I wish more places could master this.FOOD. We split a bottle of the Sagrantino di Montefalco, Bocale from Umbria (which was dry-red and strong on its own but paired well with the food). We got the cheese plater, Linguine de Mare, and the tiramisu. All great, especially the Linguine de Mare. It had a great red sauce and wasn't too fishy. Thanks for the great date Felice! Will absolutely return and recommend you take that special someone to a nice date here.",0,0,0,Jorge G.,"New York, NY",211,2,0

4.0,1/7/2019,"Location is very low key. I was not expecting such an intimate vibe, but was pleasantly surprised. In terms of food, I can only speak for the arancini and the fusilli with burrata dish which were both fine. One small thing to keep in mind though is, if you're trying be healthy and substituting for whole wheat pasta, you'll get a whole wheat linguine and not the homemade fusilli-- the same probably goes for the other pasta dishes as well.",0,0,0,Ron W.,"New York, NY",1,119,318

3.0,12/26/2018,Tucked away in Wall Street we dined late Saturday night and it was empty. Loved the intimacy and the entire staff. We weren't rushed and the food arrived as ordered in a timely fashion. The rice balls were great. Salmon was good. Branzino was good. I would have liked a little more cauliflower. Minestrone soup was very good. I'd visit again if we were staying at the hotel. Loved the staff and would love to try a few different entrees next time to enjoy some of their homemade recipes.,0,0,0,Amy S.,"Morristown, NJ",12,95,172
4.0,12/15/2018,"We stayed in Guild Hall, so this was a logical choice for breakfast. It was a bit on the pricy side (like $42 pricy for two coffees, an oatmeal, and a granola and yogurt bowl).... but everything tasted amazingly delicious. It was obvious that only the finest and freshest ingredients were used... and for the quality and the convenience, it was worth it.",1,0,1,Jody G.,"Buffalo, NY",168,831,229
5.0,12/14/2018,"I had several holiday parties to attend and this one was in the Wall Street area. The restaurant is located in the ThompsonHotel. This is an Italian restaurant that has great ambiance that makes you feel as if you could be in Italy. The service was outstanding. We had a special pre-fix menu that contained food from the regular menu. What I liked most was that you did not need to ask for anything, the wait staff was there at every turn to remove plates, refill the wine and water, etc. The hostess was bubbly and made sure that everyone was having a good time. The meal was served family style and we had ample food for the group of 14. The appetizers we shared was the Arnancini- breaded saffron risotto balls, mozzarella and sun dried tomatoes. Caprese Salad, Artichoke Salad , beets, avocado, sliced almonds, parmigiana and basil dressing. My entree was the salmon which was pan-seared with sautéed broccoli and sun-dried tomato pesto. There was also a choice of a sliced sirloin steak, Fettuccine Alla Bolognese, Fusilli with tomato sauce and creamy Burrata. For desert I had the chocolate gelato although there was a also a choice of Tiramisu and Pumpkin Cheesecake. There menu offers a lot of choices and they have a nice wine selection. They offer a nice house wine although for red we chose bottles of 2016 Kith & Kin which was a Cabernet Sauvignon from the Napa Valley. The restaurant charged a fair price of $80. You can purchase the bottle retail for anywhere from $27 to $35. The wine was great and we went through a number of bottles. We really didn't drink the white and had 1 bottle of Meroi which was a 2016 Sauvignon from Italy. We paid $60 and you can purchase the white at retail for about $25. This was a great experience, even though it is the hotel it was a comfortable, non-rushed experience. We spent about 4 hours there and the time just flew. I would recommend Felice for a great night out.",5,0,1,Brian M.,"Brooklyn, NY",383,107,711

3.0,10/24/2018,"This restaurant was walking distance from our hotel on Wall Street, so we thought we'd give it a try. They were very accommodating when we asked to push our reservation up an hour. It's a cute spot situated in the corner of a hotel lobby, occupying a couple floors over a bar area.Our waiter, Bertin, was not good at all. He rushed through our order-taking and couldn't locate any of the wines we asked for. We finally settled on a much more expensive bottle since that was all they had apparently. The food was decent. Not mind blowing or anything. I expected more, it being a nice spot in FiDi in NYC, but I've had better Italian food elsewhere. The restaurant is split over a few levels, and the top floor where we were sat, near a closed bar area was cramped and very loud. The table of 8 next to us was drunk and very boisterous. Not Felice's fault, but not the best atmosphere.The best part of the night was the manager/hostess, Mina. She was very attentive and was the only person to check in our meal and see how we were doing. At the end of the evening, she met with us and walked us downstairs where she gave our 5 year old daughter a little bag of gourmet cookies to take back to the hotel -- very sweet.",0,0,0,Richard B.,"San Diego, CA",140,273,8
5.0,10/9/2018,"I came here for a date night with my boyfriend and it was the perfect spot. The tables are candle-lit and everything looked very quaint - the perfect date night spot!We ordered the fried calamari to start which was surprisingly light and not too heavy on the bread, which I appreciated. It came with a jalapeno aioli which I personally liked. It was alright, but I probably wouldn't order it again. He ordered the lamb chops that were the special of the day which was SO GOOD. They cut so smoothly and were probably the most tender lamb chops I've had in my life. I ordered the Pappardelle con Salsiccia which is essentially truffle oil pasta which was also divine. The truffle flavor was very strong though, so if truffle isn't your thing, I would suggest you get something else. We had a bottle of this really good dry sparkling red (the name escapes me currently) that paired well with both of our dishes. The service was also amazing. The waiter was very attentive to us and made sure we were enjoying our meal. The only odd thing is that this restaurant which is connected to a hotel, but this is so much better than restaurants that are normally inside hotels.",0,0,0,Michelle Q.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",263,17,4

5.0,9/25/2018,"Delicious and great ambiance.  The food was great.  Menu has a good selection of dishes without being overwhelming.  I can't speak about the alcoholic drink menu but I enjoyed that the non-alcoholic selection was Italian sodas, I love them.  The service was great, very attentive and was able to answer any questions we had.For the ambiance and atmosphere, we went here for dinner to celebrate our anniversary and we were seated in a little corner type booth and it felt a bit more romantic since we got to sit closer to each other.  But the restaurant itself has such nice decor.  I think if you come here during lunch it definitely has a more business lunch feel since it is in the Financial District but at night it is still quite romanticAlso their dessert!

I usually leave Italian restaurants bursting at the seams, but this place left me feeling a little on the empty side. Portions could be bigger. Hence the 4/5.

5.0,9/2/2018,What a cute little gem. Old school charm with lots of modern flare to the decor. Food was delicious - pasta made perfect. Cheeses are amazingly pungent or soft and salty like it should be. Dessert was delicious too. We don't drink so no idea about the wine selections. They have their own label on the bottles. The olive oil is almost as good as the one tasted in Italy. The bread were perfect to dip it in. Wait staff is a friendly and they came to clean the tables. I prefer not to eat at a dirty table. The major D came by to ask how things were - that's a good indication that they really do care. FYI for those who might not like stairs - The bathroom is up the stairs.

We had 3 pasta dishes that were well seasoned and not as al dente as some other restaurants. I got the linguine with seafood, which had a good mix of fish, calamari, mussels and scallops.

This place used to have real quality food items, great wines, and a very knowledgeable staff. The last time I visited this location was roughly 3 years ago, and although I realize a lot can happen to a nyc restaurant in 3 years I never thought this place would disappoint me as much as it did this last Sunday. I had a low quality, terrible experience at Felice and felt the need to write about it. I used to live around the corner from this location and when my family would stay at the hotel located in the same space as Felice we would come here at least once for dinner if not more. I also frequented this rest for years because I lived so close by. I came here for dinner on Sunday night and while the waitress was very nice, the rest of the staff I encountered seemed miserable. Especially the older male greeter that stands around in front by the door. Ordered the cheese plate and it was the worst quality cheese, and prosciutto I have ever had. Not sure what the bread was and when we asked the waitress what it was made of , she didn't even know. It tasted like stale pasta. It was very strange. Then had the clams with pasta and the clams were the smallest clams I have ever seen in my 35+ years of existence. The meat in the clam was literally the size of an m&m. I am not over exaggerating here folks. I should have sent it back. It was the most pathetic meal I have ever eaten. I don't even want to waste anymore time writing.

Friendly host told us we could sit anywhere at the bar, where there was a small crowd but plenty of space for us to sit. I started with a prosecco and gin based cocktail which was delicious - and at $9 pretty good value - though the prosecco did taste a little flat (I noticed a new bottle was opened for my friend when she ordered the same). We then ordered the calamari from the happy hour menu, and a glass of rose. Calamari was solid and brought out quickly. Waters were consistently kept topped up and there were breadsticks on the bar to snack on too. When we left, the crowd was really starting to pick up and looked like people were in for dinner as well as drinks.

1.0,4/21/2018,"I've never felt more ripped off. There are two prices listed for the wine. One for 3oz and one for 6oz, $16.5 and $33. You order wine. And the second one. Then comes the bill. It's 3 people at the table, guess how much they charge you? Yep, 33 dollars per glass. They never ask if you'd like 3 oz or 6, they just automatically bring 6. So, you end up paying over $160 for wine, for 5 glasses of wine. I think it's a bit excessive even for NYC. They put two prices on the menu, and then don't even ask what size you'd like. You later go to a different restaurant where you pay $25 for a normal size glass and realize that you just got ripped off big time.

The interior was beautiful - candles at every table, intimate ambiance, and just very classy.  The service was also very good. Unfortunately, the food was just okay, especially for the price. We started with the formaggi and salumi plate and arancini. The arancini were good, but I was a bit disappointed by the selection of the formaggi and salumi plate. I got the papardelle con salsiccia pasta and my boyfriend got the linguine di mare. The papardelle was extremely rich and I couldn't eat too much of it since the cheesiness with the heavy Italian sausage and truffle flavors was a bit overpowering. The linguine was served in a classic red sauce with seafood, but tasted just okay.

Even ridiculously, the suggested tips of 15% was $4.80. ( It should be 3.05. When we asked the waitress, she told us that the tips had been included in the subtotal amount.

Dining by candlelight was super romantic.We ordered the calamari, Polpettine , Tagliatelle alla Bolognese , Linguine Cacio e Pepe , Tagliata di Manzo , Tortino di Gianduia, and gelato.Appetizers: calamari and the polpettine - the sauce that came with the polpettine was delicious but the vealballs were kinda hard and tiny so it was easy to overcook ( I guess). The calamari was pretty good but I was not a fan of the sauce that came with it, which was jalapeño aioli. I was using the rest of the tomato sauce that came with the vealballs to eat the calamari. The Bolognese dish was great and I would call it the winner of the night. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce was so flavorful.The cacio e pepe was waaaaay too over seasoned with pepper. This was a fail.The Tagliata di Manzo - which was sliced sirloin - was very chewy. The potatoes and broccolini tasted pretty good but i wouldn't order the sirloin again.For dessert - the hazlenut mouse was pretty yum. I just got hazlenut and raspberry gelato which was good too. I mean, idk how you can screw that up so it was pretty safe.one thing - my boyfriend wanted a little candle for my birthday and told the restaurant 3 times - once when making a reservation, second time when confirming the res and last when he got there - to please remember. ...... each time was reassured with a smile that ill get my birthday candle..... guess who didnt get a birthday candle?",4,0,0,Alyssa D.,"New Milford, NJ",161,129,461

After living in the area for about four years I had never had the opportunity to experience Felice beforehand. I'm so astounded that I didn't because this spot is definitely A+. From the decor to the service, it was an all around great experience.After arriving there around 5:30 PM I was instantly seated at a table within the bar section of the restaurant. There was only one other party of two there but I credited that to it being a rainy day, as well as that this spot is located in a hotel. By the time I left though the bar was packed and they had switched over to their evening services. I think you're good coming here at anytime and don't think there's a need to make a reservation in advance.When it came to order I ended up having two cups of coffee, each around $3. They were quick to serve and also asked if I wanted a refill. I appreciated how attentive they were without being overbearing. This is definitely a good, quiet spot to catch up with a friend over coffee if you're in Fidi.I definitely would recommend Felice to anyone looking for a guaranteed relaxing time!

The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the service we received from our server as well as all the other staff was great! They bring out bread for the table to start, which is always a great touch. It was soft and warm and perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Their brunch entrees each come with a complimentary bellini or mimosa which is fantastic! One of my friends and I each ordered a different toast to split and share with each other because we both couldn't decide on one. We got the French toast and the avocado toast. Both were equally awesome! The avocado toast tasted fresh and came with 2 poached eggs on top as well as a nice salad on the side. The French toast is made with raisin brioche toast topped with strawberries, blueberries and powdered sugar. They also give you maple syrup on the side. It was a perfect meal of savory and sweet toasts. In the end we couldn't resist their dessert menu and got a gelato sundae with cookie pieces, nuts, chocolate sauce, and dipped cream to share for the table.

Another time, we didn't make a reservation and the wait was 45 minutes so we didn't bother waiting. For the second time dining here, I made sure to reserve a table and I did via OpenTable app.The entrees that I have tried were: 1) Pappardelle con Salsiccia- Probably my favorite entree that I have tried so far. The entree comes with sweet Italian sausage, braised endive, mushrooms, herbs, and truffle oil. It was delicious and filling.2) Ravioli della Casa- It's homemade ravioli with spinach and ricotta filling. The ravioli was pretty fresh and tasty. There were a couple of pieces of ravioli, but I didn't feel full after eating this entree. I guess I should have asked for more bread to help fill me up.Overall, service was fine.

Every appetizer, entree and dessert has been superlative. I must give extra special mention to their homemade pasta and every sauce we've ever had though the desserts are also unforgettable so plan to leave room!Why 4 stars, not 5? Every table I've ever had has been challenging. Once we made advanced reservations for a group of 7 and were seated at a most unfortunate booth right by the front door that made it impossible to have good conversation; we ended up playing musical chairs halfway through dinner so we could mix & mingle. I will NEVER let that happen again! Another time we had reservations for a party of 4 and were seated right by the door where the winter wind hit us repeatedly. The only time we had a somewhat reasonable table it was super-tiny even for just a party of 2. While that's somewhat to be expected for this part of Manhattan, it's still a drawback; be warned and plan on using coat check to make logistics work.Seems like they have more room upstairs than downstairs.

The interior was very cozy and warm, still decked in Holiday lights and wreaths. I ordered coffee and avocado toast. The coffee was kind of watery and not to my liking. The avocado toast though was awesome! The eggs were poached perfectly. There was ample avocado atop this thick, delicious sunflower toast. It was nutty, chewy and crunchy at the same time.

Service was a bit slow for the lunch hour- they don't like to rush you here. All the same when conversation is flowing. Bread, yummy. Crusty, grainy, gluteny- the only way to better those elements is MORE crustiness, graininess and gluten, in my book.I opted for the lunch coursed special: meatballs, linguine cacio e pepe and cheesecake while my buddy opted for lasagna.Wow, everything was super flavorful. Generous pour of olive oil on most items, for once I didn't care, it was so yummy. My only worry was how do I trek back to work in the allotted time after bread, pasta and cheesecake and not fall straight into nappy time?Cacio e pepe, I've been hearing about you for so long.. boy am I glad to have met you here. Its oily for sure and not for the weight conscious/ obsessed or even somewhat caring. Its for lovers and indulgers of food and taste. That's all.Lasagna was overdone. But the flavors of smokey tomato butter base done so well, I'd forgive it too.Meatballs- superb and of course, heavy healthy dose of Olive oil.

And I'm very glad I did - the staff were extremely helpful - although I forgot to place my order for a whole birthday cake (a wonderful lemon-ricotta cheesecake) ahead of the 48 hour deadline, the staff went out of their way to accommodate my order. The food was phenomenal - one of our group members claimed that the French Toast was the best he'd ever had, with similar sentiments expressed about the omelette. I ordered the Italian-style baked egg dish which I found very flavorsome and inventive. And the drinks were similarly top-notch.

Small light cheesecake with lemon for dessert with a medium dry Prosecco, espresso to finish and a San Pellegrino, all for about 75$ with tip... not cheap to European standards but NY is horribly expensive.

5.0,8/10/2017,"Lunch today was my first visit to Felice 15 in the financial district, despite living and working within a four block radius from this hotel restaurant. I feel as though I've come across a hidden gem. The interior design is both contemporary and charming; my party of three was seated upstairs at a white table cloth table next to the bar and beyond the gorgeous staircases enhanced by wine bottles displayed in library-style bookshelves. I ordered the Classico panini on multigrain toast - generous helping of mozzarella cheese on bread of perfect thickness and chewiness. My one coworker enjoyed her salad, and the other coworker (who had ordered a linguini seafood dish with at least three different substitutions) received her meal to her specifications. It was toward the end of her meal when she found a big piece of sand (likely from the mussels), and flagged this to our waiter Carlos. He physically took it from her to show Danilo the manager, who came over within one minute to provide us with an explanation and apology. Carlos then gave us not only dessert to go for free, but handed us an apology ""bill."" In fact, there was only a ""thank you and I'm sorry"" note on the inside of the bill holder, and no bill - we were astounded to learn that they had waived our entire lunch.  As I do not cook, I dine out in NYC for every meal - I have been to my fair share of restaurants not only in this city, but around the world. Never in my years have I experienced an establishment rise to the occasion in such a manner. I am simply blown away by the customer service at Felice 15.

I decided on veal meatballs - so moist and flavored perfectly. That sauce !  Fusilli with San Marizano tomatoes and some burrata on top (wow wow wow) - I tried a bite of pasta with the burrata and it was perfect - adding some creamy burrata to the bite added a diff texture and next level of flavor.  Probably my favorite pasta dish so far.  For dessert you get lemon ricotta cheesecake- not too sweet. Can tell it's made with fresh ingredients.  They also give you bread while waiting... but don't fill up on that!The service was stellar as well.  I actually asked for them to box up my pasta dish since I couldn't finish it (so much food!)... but he didn't understand and when we got our check we found out my leftovers was gone!  The waiter said the chef is making me 1/2 a dish for me to take home....

I, on the other hand, actually did not order anything from the menu. I got a spaghetti bolognese, which to be honest I was not a huge fan of. It tasted pretty mediocre and without much flavor.

Get over yourself, it's totally worth it.I had the cacio e pepe; it was delicious and somehow lighter than when I've had it elsewhere. This may be due to the type of pasta they used; regardless, it was outstanding. Had a little bread ahead of time; their olive oil was fragrant and flavorful.

He had the pasta with tomato sauce and burrata -- it was a burrata-filled evening!We saved room for the dessert -- he got the panna cotta; I had two scoops of gelato (don't you roll your eyes at me, I'd had A DAY...), the chocolate and the hazelnut. Worth every bite. I also had coffee -- we could smell it as soon as it hit the table. Mmm! They also have a great wine list and bar selections.Service was spot on -- every person we had contact with was nice, polite and balanced between being attentive and giving us our space to enjoy our meal and evening.

5.0,3/8/2017,"Handpicked this sparkling gem on Gold Street for my farewell lunch, and impressed the hell out of my soon-to-be former coworkers and boss. She said looking around, ""We should have had our Christmas party here!"" The exterior is nice, mainly because of the clear view of the restaurant's fabulous interior. Its classy, sleek and crowded-with-suited-patrons atmosphere made the bittersweet goodbye all the more sweet. The main thing I remember marveling at were the unique pendant lights. Could stare at them all day, but the comfortable seats were a major plus as well. Felice is a resto that you want to enjoy a two-hour lunch and a good conversation or curl up on the sofa-comfy seating with one of the many books on display (and one of the many wine bottles on display) by a gold, glass and wood stairwell that leads to another fabulous dining space aka our table. I felt like I was eating at my imaginary friend's million-dollar home. And nothing says great home-cooking like a comforting, creamy and cheesy mushroom lasanga (lasagna di crespelle), my entree. I sent a pic of it (posted) to my bf and my sister who had opposite reactions. If it doesn't look appetizing to you, trust me, it tastes much better than it looks.Although everyone raved about their choices: Cavatelli with lamb, Farro with broccolini, the tagliolini, and the affordable-especially-for-this-area three course prix fixe, I believe that my choice of entree was the best. I also had the blueberry tart, which was just ok. My only two regrets are associating the end of an era with this restaurant that made me truly happy and not testing out its extensive wine list.

We stayed at the Gild Hall ( Hotel ) for a weekend in NYC. My Boyfriend and I hit the Felice the first night as we were tired from a day of travel. Started the evening with the cheese board ( very good ) and a bottle of wine recommended by our server ( we wanted a Chianti Classico is the $80 range and we were very impressed with both. We shared the rocket and artichoke salad ( fresh bright clean flavors ) and shared the feature for the night which was veil with wild mushrooms puréed broccoli and roasted potatoes... amazing amazing amazing. We ended the night with tiramisu ( which was wonderful ) and had the server recommend a bottle of red from his home region in Italy to take back with us to the room ( it was delicious ) as I was changing into my PJs and my BF was opening the bottle there was a knock on our door it the GM who wanted to gift us with traditional Italian cookes that were a a great pair with the bottle of wine. We had plans to dine at a trendy NY steak house the next day but we scratched that and went back to Felice and had another amazing experience !,0,0,0,Nammi D.,"Dallas, TX",18,2,0

5.0,2/8/2017,"This is a Restaurant Week Lunch Review: just perfect! The meal, service, atmosphere, and overall dining experience. I am really happily surprised by Felice in the financial district. I ordered: salmon tartare, handmade fresh bucatini with tomatoes sauce and burrata, and a tiramisu. The meal was paired with a glass of white wine from northern Italy. The tartare was delicious, smoothly, melting in my mouth. The good amount to not fill you in. Pasta was definitely my favorite part of the meal. I pretty particular when it comes to define quality and tastiness of handmade pasta and tomatoes sauce. These were just perfect, with right balance of ""sapori"" to do not be too garlicky, or oniony. Just fresh tomatoes, with fresh basil, and melting creamy burrata. I literally try to not leave any sauce on the plate!To end I had another delicious surprise with a 5star tiramisù: creamy, with a tasty coffee sponge bottom. And thankfully a good espresso. Just like home. I can't wait to find another occasion to go back, and try the other locations!",1,1,1,Martina C.,"Long Island City, NY",61,280,202
5.0,2/5/2017,"Found this gem during 2017 restaurant week. I cannot be more impressed with a restaurant. It is tucked away in the corner of wall street. The decor is romantic, with dim lighting, 2 levels and wine tucked away as wall decor. Being italian I have had true italian food in Italy and this could stand up to any of those restauants. The service was bar none the best. Me and a few others tried many dishes but the two that stood out were the branzino and fussili. The branzino was so fresh and so perfectly prepare.

5.0,1/10/2017,"This review is mainly about La Soffitta, the wine bar upstairs ... but I will say that the restaurant is quite good and reasonable.  Nice atmosphere, good service, the lunches I've had there are quite good, and it's not inexpensive but still a decent value for what you get.  As for the wine bar upstairs, it is a really nice venue for parties, get-togethers, etc.  We had our holiday party there this past December and it was a great success, thanks largely to Katie - who managed and organized it wonderfully. It's a classy yet fun place that will comfortably accommodate 75 people, mostly standing but with a decent amount of seating, largely on nice leather sofas. Our people were very pleased with everything. First, the food - top rate.  We had a meat & cheese plate, fried calamari, veal meatballs, grilled shrimp, a number of ""crostones"", and a couple other things. They ranged from tasty to delicious, and there were more than ample portions for our group. We were also able to provide our own music through their speaker system, which was a bit light on the bass but pretty decent. I will say that their drinks are pricey - high quality, great variety, but pricey. As long as you acknowledge that you're paying not only for the drinks but also a bit for the ambiance, it is not a bad value. We decided to run a group tab, as opposed to open bar, and our bill ended up coming out a good bit over budget ... due to some mis-communication (on both of our parts). Yet Katie and the management, to their credit, were quite reasonable and met us partway on the cost; so it wound up a bit pricey but worth it. So, if you're looking to host a party with some class and have a decent budget, this is a GREAT venue. If you're not, it's still a really nice place to stop by for a couple drinks if you're in the neighborhood.",0,0,0,Jason B.,"Manhattan, NY",10,25,0

We were at the Sheritan next door and the simplicity was too go to pass up.The atmosphere is mixed as the lighting is romantic but the noise and crowded tables overflowing with people make for tight stranger to stranger contact. Luckily I was able to grab a seat next time my sister and niece at the bar and ordered wine promptly. The wine selection is from Italy, lovely and they also do tastings if you want to taste some of the higher end wines.My sister had shared the pan-seared salmon in a stew of artichokes, roasted cherry tomatoes, fingerling potatoes with green olives. She was not in love with it so I opted out on the taste test. My order was absolutely amazing, the braised and pulled Colorado leg of lamb with artichoke hearts and mint. My ability to order it with gluten free pasta heightened the happiness of the entire meal. The braised lamb was tender without fat and cooked perfectly with the artichokes and mint. The pasta was a thick noodle style done perfectly, I prefer the noodle soft as opposed to al dente. The meal melted into my mouth. My niece tried it and agreed it was delicious.I wanted to come back again and would love to return when in NYC again.

The appetizer came with not only squid but also vegetables. I personally was not a fan of that, but others might be. Since I had a heavy brunch and was not too hungry for dinner, I only ordered the salmon tartare appetizer, which came in a bigger portion than usual (bigger than most other salmon tartares I've had). It was a pleasant surprise, but too bad I couldn't finish all of it due to being full. The salmon tasted fresh though! We all thought the atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice.

The food was SO good- expertly and quickly prepared and the portions were perfect (not so big we couldn't finish, but you get good bang for your buck). Loved their menu too, and we're big italian fans so that's not a compliment easily earned.Price: Spot on. We weren't looking for Olive Garden, but wanted something affordable.

3.0,2/8/2016,"Felice is a cute Italian restaurant in the Financial District.  It's probably more of a 3.5 than a 3 in all reality.  The restaurant itself is a nice date place - it's quiet and dark with small tables and candles.  We went on a Saturday night as walk ins.  Although we called beforehand to see if we could be seated, they didn't really seem sure if they had space when we got there (why wouldn't they just tell us to make a reservation?) however they did have room and we were seated immediately.  Our server greeted us right away and was really nice.  The whole staff was very attentive (constantly filling waters etc) which I liked. We split the gnocchi special (with mushrooms in truffle sauce) and the fusilli with Burrata and tomatoes.  The gnocchi was good (big gnocchi which were pillowy and very fresh mushrooms) but the portion was fairly small.  The dish was $24.  We enjoyed this but wished it was a little bigger.  I ordered the fusilli which I enjoyed.  The sauce was sweet and fresh and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  The Burrata's consistency was a little thin for me, but overall I enjoyed our meal.  We were in and out quickly and our whole bill came to just under $50.  While I liked what we got and would come again, nothing really blew me away either.  It was a good, reasonably priced meal - probably one of my favorites in FiDi.",3,1,1,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",285,134,933

It is not some farce American interpretation like other ""Italian"" restaurants. The crostini are fantastic, simple burrata and tomato is the most popular because it is simple perfection. I have had a few of their pastas and the portions are European, but generous. Not Texas sized, but enough to fill you without being excessive. Typical Italian cooking the pasta is cooked al dente, to perfection. Even the wine pairing suggestion by the actual Italian waiter was ideal. I love this place and I go as often as I can. The staff is super attentive, friendly and honestly quite European that they let you enjoy your meal without hovering but they don't disappear so you can get their attention when you need it.

It looked really presentable from outside, not crowded, and that's just how I like it.   I walked in and judging by the decor and demographic of the patrons, I totally perceived this venue to be pretentious. I was mistaken. I was greeted and seated with what I perceived to be genuine service. I look around and I'm the only brotha in the venue. I'm like, (shrugs shoulders)my money is just as green as everyone else's in this place.   A gentlemen sat me at a candlelit table. I loved it -- a lot. To the right of me there was a wall decorated with so many bottles of vino, I was just beyond enamored. I had bread to start and it was really good! I didn't know what to order or what the portion differential between a listed small/regular was so I opted to go for a small.  I ordered the tagliatelle alla bolognese which was tagliatelle pasta with traditional veal ragu. This was my first time having veal (to my recollection) and it was nothing short of delectable! I had my dish with a glass of red vino in which I don't recall which exactly however the pairing was beyond perfect!   Upstairs searching for the men's room I came across a beautiful upstairs area where I was informed that on certain nights, they have live musicians come play music. It looked super appealing and I told myself I'd be back in which case I definitely will!   All in all I'd be ridiculous to formulate a complaint. It would be absurd of me. I had a lovely experience!

Also, if it's not your typical pork belly (like every other restaurant in the city braises it - mind you the menu described it as ""slow cooked"") ... then DO NOT ask me ""when is pork belly not amazing""Lastly when you ask for my opinion of the dish, I am going to give you an honest albeit polite answer.  It was clear the waiter was not satisfied with my answer.  Bad move buddy.  He just rubbed me the wrong way.Bye Felice",2,0,0,Sabrina P.,"New York, NY",29,41,4

3.0,4/22/2015,"Disclaimer: As an Italian myself, I tend to be hard to please when it comes to Italian food because my family cooks some of the best Italian food I've ever tasted.So I went here on a Monday evening around 7p with a coworker of mine. We ordered a bottle of San Pellegrino as well as a bottle of the Chianti Classico, which was an excellent start. The wait staff was attentive, well-informed, and actually off-the-boat Italian which added a nice flair to the dining experience.To start, we ordered: fritto misto (expecting fried calamri with a few other battered fried veggies, but honestly it was mostly fried shreds of onion, carrot, and Lord knows what else. I feel like out of the whole pile, I probably had 5 pieces of actual calamari. Not that it tasted bad, it was delicious, and came with some aoili for dipping, but, I mean, at the end of the day I didn't want a pile of shredded fried veggies) and the polpettine (tiny meatballs) in marinara sauce to start. The polpettine were OK, as was the marinara. Again, biased because my mom makes the best meatballs in the world, and her sauce is the best, but, yeah. The meatballs were just dense, tiny, a little dry. The portions of both starts were enough to share between 2 people.More wine.The meal gets better here. For main course, we split two pasta entrees: the gnocchi with mushrooms, and the pappardelle with sausage and broccoli. These were both good. The pappardelle and gnocchi themselves were perfectly cooked and obviously made in house. I die for those pappardelle noodles. Both dishes needed salt and were a little bland, albeit fresh tasting and appropriately sauced. I loved how they minced the broccoli and the sausage so it was a very fine, crumbly accent to the pappardelle. I'm not running back there to order them again, but I would try other things on the menu of the strength of the perfect pasta.More wine.Now, the best part of the whole meal. Dessert.We ordered the tiramisu & the gianduia (which is basically a ferro rocher, in cake form. hazelnut chocolate mousse cake etc etc). Both were to die for, I mean truly fantastic desserts. We also had grappa with espresso, which is apparently the ""proper"" way to have the espresso. The waiter called it caffé corretto, which literally just translates to, this is the correct way to have espresso. lol. (grappa is a a super strong, grape-based brandy. see also: poison, turpentine. not for the weak drinker. sip with your espresso, and pour a little into the espresso. this is the turn-up).Highlights: because my birthday was a few days prior to this Monday meal, they put a candle in the gianduia cake and sang to me. I thought this was sweet. The manager of the restaurant also came and chatted with us for a few minutes to make sure we were pleased with everything. Excellent, lovely, authentic Italian friendliness and the desire to make us eat more more more, not because of an up-sell, but because, Italian. lol.If you're in FiDi with some money burning a hole in your pocket, go, get a bottle of wine, and explore the menu.

The decorations were lovely and it seems to be connected to a wine bar and/or hotel because there was another lobby with nice couches and loungey decorations upstairs with louder music. (Upstairs is where the bathroom is this is the only reason I know this).I was pleasantly surprised to see gnudi on their menu because it is one of my favorite dishes and difficult to find on a normal italian restaurant menu. It was spinach and ricotta gnudi cooked to melt in your mouth perfection and my date was lucky to get a taste of it before I ate it all up. I got hazelnut gelato for dessert which was pretty good (I'm a gelato snob) and I ended up eating both scoops of that as well. My date got the hazelnut chocolate mousse which he at all of, too. The only bad thing was that I ordered sparkling water which they never brought me and just kept refilling tap water instead. I didn't say anything-- it was fine, but still a bit off-putting.

3.0,11/10/2014,"My friends live down in the Wall Street area. Because I am SO nice and accommodating, I agreed to meet them near their place for dinner. After much back and forth, they chose Felice 15. In true Lauren fashion, I didn't look it up other than to google the address to find it in the maze that is downtown. No clue what I would find when I arrived. I walked in and thought it looks great. All dark and swanky and pretty. The bar area is fairly small, but we had a reservation for dinner, so I didn't care about that too much. We checked in with the hostess, who turned out to be the manager. Since we were early and our whole party wasn't there yet, she sat us in the hotel lobby and brought over a waiter. She kindly moved around some chairs and coffee tables so we could have a little spot for cocktails. Super nice of her. She was very friendly and accommodating. Love it! But while the waiter went to get us our drinks, someone from the hotel came over and just started picking up the furniture, scolding us for ""blocking the way"" and ""just going ahead and moving furniture"". This was wildy uncomfortable and weird. We didn't move the furniture. And now we are in the awkward position of sitting on a bench with nothing in front of us, waiting for a drink. I don't know, it was so strange. Why doesn't the hotel staff talk to the restaurant staff and work something out? Or at the very least, why doesn't the restaurant NOT seat people over there? Look, the manager was nothing but lovely. When we first sat down for drinks, I was impressed with how amazing she was toward us. And I am NOT saying it was her fault that this happened, I more blame the brusk hotel staff that basically told us to scram, but whatever. Luckily, as soon as this happened, the manager came over and said she would set us up at our table. She felt badly brought our drinks over to the table and told us the first round could be from the happy hour menu for our trouble, since they usually don't allow the happy hour specials in the main dining room. Fair enough. Stuff happens. We ordered the cheese and meat platter to start and it was pretty good. Our whole party wasn't there yet, so we noshed a little and chatted. Platter was standard, nothing immensely special. I will say the chopped up pieces of fig were a nice touch, but the figs weren't ripe. Sad. We then ordered the risotto balls which were okay. A bit dry. The sauce they came with was excellent though. So that sort of evened everything out. I might order them again. If I was drunk. As an entree I had the Pappardelle alla Salsiccia that was fine. Not at all bad, nothing to write home about, either. It was papardelle, sweet sausage, broccoli, white wine and grana padano. I think the space is beautiful, truly. The staff is accommodating and super nice. The food is very so-so, and very overpriced. The wine is overpriced too. I almost think this is a two star place, but I am giving it a third because everyone was just so, so nice. And it's pretty. And the cocktails were actually good. So there's that. Go for the happy hour cocktail specials. Leave before dinner.",2,1,2,Lauren B.,"New York, NY",485,391,60

1.0,4/7/2014,My wife and I came in for what we hoped would be a relaxing dinner with good food.  We got neither.  For some reason the hostess sat us at a table in the bar area despite numerous tables being available in the more pleasant main dining area.  The bar tender was blasting Game of Thrones on the TV at high volume and the waitress ignored us for 10+ minutes after seating us with food menus but not wine/drink menus.  When she finally came back to ask us if we had chosen any wine to drink we updated her that we had not been given the wine list. Halfway through our meal the loud fight scenes on the TV became too irritating and we requested to be moved into the main dining area which still had plenty of room.  Pasta was overcooked/mushy.,0,0,1,Castlerock C.,"New York, NY",0,14,0
3.0,3/24/2014,"My best advice about this place is stay away.  After running the NYC half marathon the other weekend we decided to do breakfast here as it was convenient.  There were a total of 9 seated tables and more than enough wait staff to take care of them, yet for some reason it took them 25-30 minutes just to take our order.  Then it took another 55 minutes to get our food.  The food was mediocre at best and the drinks pathetic.  The waiter realized I had just run 13.1 miles and did not seem to care that I was starving.  The waiters and staff were disorganized, not even close to attentive and should be ashamed of the service.  NEVER EVER will I come here again or recommend this place to anyone.  I would even stay away from the hotel its connected to if this is the kind of service you get.Revision: As of last night I am changing my review from 1 star to 3.  After a bad experience at this restaurant the GM reached out to me via yelp to remedy the situation.  This was greatly appreciated as the previous experience was dismal.  This time myself and two girlfriends came for dinner.  The ambiance was great, super cute and romantic with dim lighting and candle lit.  The service was much improved and food a bit better.  In my honest opinion the food is good but not great.  To start we ordered the Crostone Burrata (wouldn't order again.  Burrata did not shine through and eggplant was mushy), Crostone Fave (would order again, needed a bit of salt thought), and the cheese plate.  I would ask though that the cheese options be printed on the menu as the waiter was not very good at explaining what they had to offer and the options seemed very limited, oddly everything other than a Gorgonzola he listed were hard cheeses, very strange.  For the main I ordered the Dorado, it was sadly not all that great.  The fish was nicely cooked but had no flavor, and the cauliflower mashed potatoes were dry and lacked creativity.  Overall we had a lovely evening but I wouldn't necessarily classify this place as having great food.",0,1,2,Emily K.,"Manhattan, NY",344,36,0

I think you could easily have a few glasses of wine, one of the crostoni starters (there are three), and a salumi & cheese board and be quite satisfied if you're looking to do a lighter dinner. But the mains are worth a try - the Branzino is cooked to perfection and it's a generous portion. And if you're going for the gold, the desserts are tempting - everything from tiramisu, chocolate hazelnut cake, to gelatos and sorbets. A few other notes: they usually have menu additions (to make it harder to narrow down what to order!), the wine selection includes many by the glass, and you can also eat in the bar area, which is a bit noisier but has a TV and a bit of a bar scene depending on the day and time you visit.",0,0,0,Kathleen H.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",44,377,12

4.0,4/14/2013,"I was scrambling to find a brunch place in the FiDi area that could take a table of 13 for brunch. We were going to go to Laconda Verde but they were very unhelpful and a bit too full of themselves, as usual. Then we tried Freemans but they tried to get us to sign a contract saying we would pay a fee if someone did not show up and we had to use a pre fix menu. I knew there was a nice boutique hotel off Gold Street that had a nice little restaurant tied to it. When I called, I found that the old restaurant had closed and a new established restauranteur opened Felice 15 in the space. They had a large table for us, they were extremely polite and professional and they wanted our business. I checked some reviews and booked a table for 13. Excellent decision. The manager and staff could not have been more helpful! I wondered, why are they so nice? The food must be terrible. Wrong. This is a new restaurant in a hotel in the Financial District so either they are smart and need our business or they are just plain professional and polite, rare in the NYC restaurant industry. We had a wonderful brunch and a wonderful experience. We were given a section off the main dining area that had a bar attached. To my friends delight, there was a TV with European football. We had 2 infants and 2 young children with us who were well behaved and given the freedom to walk around the area we were in. It could not have been better. The manager is Italian and perfect. Besides the excellent attention and service we received, the food was really good. I had the steak and eggs. The steak was one of the best breakfast steaks I have ever had. Perfectly cooked the way I ordered it. A few from our party ordered the french toast which was absolutely delicious. For a new restaurant, they had a nice crowd. Busy but not packed. This place has the bar area with dining tables, a main dining area and a kind of sitting area which is also the lobby to the nice hotel. They also have an upstairs bar that is great for afterwork cocktails. Nicely decorated. I have not yet had dinner or lunch here, but I can tell you the quality of the management, service and the food at brunch was excellent! I can't wait to come for dinner. Try this place! They understand and respect their customers and their industry and the breakfast we had was great.

3.0,3/26/2013,"So I was visiting a special friend down in FIDI on a rainy Monday night and we wanted to go out and grab a bite. He suggested this place as it was basically around the corner. We got there around 7:30 and there were only a few tables that were taken. We were seated at a cozy booth by the window. My date has been here a few times and he said the food was always good but the service was a bit iffy. There was a very nice Host at the front that greeted us and the woman that sat us seemed to be fine. The bread they bring you at the beginning is very good and served with some olive oil that honestly was just OK. I ordered a Manhattan which was average, a bit too sweet and my date ordered a Pinot Nero. I thought $16 a glass for what he ordered was high but he seemed to enjoy it. We decided to split an appetizer and each get an entree. We went with the grilled calamari, peas, pancetta and tomato confit. The presentation was beautiful, some large pieces of calamari rolled up and grilled resting on pea puree. The pancetta was basically a piece of very well done bacon but it did add a great flavor to the dish. My only complaint is that the calamari was a touch chewy. My date ordered the Broccoletti, pappardelle, sweet sausage, broccoli, white wine, grana padano and this dish was STELLAR! The noodles were fresh and perfectly cooked, the flavor combination was right on, the portion was large and I barely got one bite in before my date gave me the stink eye to stay away. The sauce was definitely on the rich side so I thought he would share but no, he practically licked the plate. For some odd reason I decided to order the Petto di Pollo, grilled chicken, arugula, cherry tomatoes, spicy mustard remoulade. This was a riff on Chicken Palliard but without the great flavor. It was perfectly fine but nothing to write home about. I ordered a glass of the Neprica and it was marginal at best but hey, what do you want for $8. Would I go back? Maybe to sit at the bar and have a bowl of pasta as I liked the atmosphere as well but I certainly wouldn't make it a destination.",0,0,0,Leslie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,444,2

4.0,1/30/2013,"I'd come back for the risotto alone.  It's so hard to find a perfectly cooked and seasoned risotto these days.  The meat and cheese platter was really delicious and a great start to our meal.  The vongole pasta was al dente and seasoned very well (had a bit of a kick, which I really liked).  I'm curious about the other items on the menu as everything I tried was truly delicious.  I wasn't too impressed with dessert but I was too full from dinner anyway!  Final thoughts: great decor, dim lighting, and quiet atmosphere make for a great date spot or low key dinner with a good friend.",1,1,0,Dalhea K.,"Austin, TX",142,145,4
4.0,1/7/2013,"I was pleasantly surprised by this bar/restaurant combination during my recent stay at the adjoining Gild Hall. I had a few cocktails at the upstairs bar the evening I stayed- the happy hour prices were very reasonable. We also had a snack at the actual restaurant downstairs the following evening when we returned to pick up our luggage - we ordered the butchers block type of appetizer. The portion size was great, and the  server was very attentive and happy to refill our bread & water situation at a nearly obnoxious pace.Biggest downside: bathrooms were upstairs, which was kind of a pain.",0,0,0,Kay G.,"Alexandria, VA",5,53,0
3.0,12/16/2012,"My company picked this place for our holiday staff party.  As I maneuvered upstairs, I realized how dim lite the staircase is.  I could hardly tell where each step was and where the flight ended.I safely made it upstairs. I was greeted by staff who offered to check my coat.  Heck ""yes.""  Sat down and again, I noticed the dim lighting. I I was REALLY looking to party, but the lack of lighting AND lounge-y musique induced me in to a nap.  Fortunately, I learned Prosecco was being poured. Nabbed myself a glass at the bar, took a sip and was feeling lively again.Every one of the staff was SO happy and courteous and smiling too.",1,1,0,Judy F.,"Forest Hills, NY",154,387,249
4.0,12/5/2012,"Connected to the Gild Hall Hotel on Gold St and Platt St., Felice was a true find. Cozy and pleasant. Good number of Italian wines by the glass and very good cocktails as well. Bar food appies were delicious and reasonably priced. The restaurant itself is rather small and naturally intimate. Had a good breakfast and lunch entree during our stay. Bar tender was very good; helpful with the description of the wine flights and the cocktails, pleasant and professional as were the staff. If in the financial district give it a try; that area needs place like Felice.",0,0,0,John L.,"Marvin, NC",0,63,2
5.0,12/3/2012,A much needed addition to the neighborhood. I'm really surprised to read complaints about the food and service because everything was great for me. I'll definitely be back for a date or drinks with friends. Plus the lighting and decor was really pretty.,3,0,1,Emily A.,"Richmond, CA",61,156,0
4.0,11/28/2012,It's a small yet romantic setting. The wines are good and the staff is attentive . The food since I've eaten here twice is pretty good not fantastic. My biggest gripe is their parmesan cheese is terrible it tastes like store bought from a kraft. how can a great kitchen have made such a simple mistake. Good olive oil and cheese are the basics that's one reason this eatery will be a hit and a miss depending on the night. That's why the reviews are all over the place. They must work on the basics. Few options left since Front street got wiped out.,2,0,1,Brad B.,"Manhattan, NY",178,122,20
5.0,11/7/2012,"Held a Bday dinner for 8 here, a few weeks ago and was heartily impressed.  Judging by the low (for FiDi) prices ($85 p/p for 4 glasses of wine each, shared apps, entree, and shared desserts), I honestly didn't expect much but Felice 15 Gold really delivered.  The reservations process was simple and had no mix ups.  We were promptly seated even though 2 of our party were late.  They have a lovely Lambrusco!  They have inexpensive wine flights!!!  And the food was ridiculously good.  We had the meat & cheese plate, the rice balls, and an arugula salad to start.  Everything was fresh and VERY tasty.  Being mostly vegetarian, I found enough choices but I wouldn't call it a large selection.  The best of the vegetarian entrees was the risotto with red wine and wild blueberry sauce (Just get it, seriously.) and the pumpkin ravioli was a close second.  The carnivores had whole branzino (with the head), the linguine with clams, and the chicken.  Everyone was VERY happy with their choices and we finished everything.   The decor was rustic Italian with over-sized wine jugs suspended from the ceiling.  Our server was a bit green with the wine list but was able to ask for help from a manager.  We thought for the price, this restaurant completely over-delivered.  No complaints whatsoever!  Hope they do well down in FiDi and we'll be back again soon!!! P.S. bathrooms are above the staircase inside the completely redone hotel.  It used to be a sad Holiday Inn sort of hotel but whatever hotel it is now, has lots of dark wood and leather.  Seemed perfect for a quiet drink in FiDi!!!P.P.S. No matter how full you are, get the Pistachio Gelato. Seriously, I'm still thinking about it weeks later.",1,1,1,Lady M.,"New York, NY",7,60,18
4.0,11/4/2012,"I went here for the grand opening of the place and it was not only a great event but they did an amazing job of showcasing their menu and their specialty cocktails. The atmosphere of the place is minimalist Italian, so there is not too much but just enough to give it a homey and cosy feel of the place. And I do love the chandeliers in their ceiling. I tried their Polpettini (Veal meatballs, lemon zest and artichoke puree), Coccoli (18 month san daniele prosciutto), I tasted some of their cheese and many different sausages from their buffet tables, sliders, bruchettas and much much more. Their house wine was really good but I was not a great fan of their specialty cocktails. The prices are not too bad for good quality restaurant food so I would defintiely recommend someone to stop by, just at least to check out the atmosphere of both the restaurant and the la soffitta upstairs.",2,1,0,Line B.,"Manhattan, NY",113,291,18

5.0,10/21/2012,"I was wandering the Fi Di last night when I discovered this hidden gem.    Everything from the warm welcome at the front door to the buonanotte at the end, was excellent! I had a salmon crostino to start. The smoked salmon was extremely fresh and served over nicely toasted bread with cream cheese. As a second I had the burger and I dare to say that even the best burger joins' burgers in this city have nothing on it! Burger was tender juicy and cooked to perfection. Served with caramelized onions, pancetta and thinly sliced tomatoes and lightly pickled cucumbers were just the right thing to go with this magnificent burger. On the side came thick cut French fries that were nicely crisped and highly enhanced the dish. The waitress paired my main with a great Sangiovese-merlot blend called ""Felice Rosso"" which she explained was produced in a vineyard deep in Tuscany that is related closely to the chain of restaurants. Talking about it the waitress was polite, knowledgeable and always on point. Atmosphere was light and all the patrons for dinner were casually elegant. All in all exceptional experience!!! Oh did I miss one of the best parts! The pistachio gelato I ended my dinner with was simply divine and the espresso was real strong Italian coffee, the way I love it.  Will definitely return to this Italian paradise!",3,1,0,Ivan S.,"Astoria, NY",8,3,0
5.0,10/14/2012,"I'm so happy I don't have to go to the UES for my salmon tartare fix anymore!!  I've tried ordering salmon or tuna tartare at other places in the city, and they're never as good.  When I went down there, my server (Charles) was super sweet and friendly.  Food was good, space is cute (especially the upstairs).  The only bad thing was they were out of pistachio gelato - probably because it's AMAZING!  Oh!  And the quinoa.  This appetizer is new for this location, and it's delicious.",0,0,0,Elizabeth D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,0
5.0,10/13/2012,"Went here with a girlfriend after work for a glass of wine and ended up staying for two more!This is amazing addition to the neighborhood.  I think they have another location on the upper east side, but there is nothing like it in the Financial District!  It is beautiful and romantic inside with candles on the tables, rustic painted floors, an amazing bar, and a great overall vibe.A Italian man who I think was the manager made a great recommendation for a lighter Tuscan red - it was delicious, perfect for this fall weather, and exactly what I needed.  I looked in their wine list and I also realized it was also a sustainable wine, which is very cool.My friend tried their quinoi salad with roasted octopus and it was one of the best octopus salads I have ever tasted.  I would go back for this everyday for lunch.  I had a 3 cheese plate that was beautifully presented with honey on a wooded board.  We shared two pastas - one with clams that also had olives and some sort of breadcrumbs.  Delicious and unique.  We also tried their veal ragu sauce which was rich and flavorful without making me feel weighed down.  Everything we ate was unbelievable. They gave us a chocolate cake on the house to welcome us to the neighborhood, and I will definitely be making this my regular spot!",0,0,0,Maureen O.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,11,1
3.0,10/6/2012,"Fist time following their opening...Service was good (the staff was very attentive and nice), food was OK, setting was OK, atmosphere was a bit lacking.  Comparing against a mainstay, Harry's Italian just down the block, the pasta's at Felice was better, but overall value and experience at Harry's is still just a bit better.  Nice to have a new restaurant in the FiDi and will try again to see how they get along.",0,0,0,Jonathan S.,"New York, NY",41,159,19
