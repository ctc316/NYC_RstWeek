2.0,4/29/2019,"TLDR: Food was mediocre. Found something that looked like plastic in my food. Waiter brushed me off and insulted my intelligence asking whether I knew what I was talking about. Service is not warm or friendly. Place felt stuck up with price tags to match. Spend your money elsewhere. God knows there are places in NYC with much better food and service.LONG FORMCame here to celebrate gf's cousin's 40th bday. I've been meaning to try this place and Daniel for a while so glad I finally got the chance to come. Our experience however, was below average.BIG BANG and VIEUX CARRE - We started with some cocktails which were inventive enough. I had the Big Bang which has a unique sesame note and was very smoky from the chicory. The vieux carre could have been a little better balanced. It was too spirit forward. They need a better mixologist.HAMACHI TARTARE - I started with the hamachi tartare which was very refreshing and had a great crunchy texture to break up the monotony of tartare. THE DUCK - For my entree I had the duck which was cooked to perfection. However, the seasoning on the duck was quite uneven. Parts of the duck had no seasoning while other parts tasted like the Dead Sea. The entree also came with these fried potato balls decorated with a marcona almond. These were especially dry and were not pleasant to eat. I did eat them anyway because I was hungry from the tiny portions but I have to say they were not good.BANANE - we brought a cake since it was our friend's bday but I also ordered the banane because it looked so interesting. I wasn't sure what this was. It came with a quarter of a caramelized banana (Really? You can't afford a whole banana for a $16 dessert?) and then there was a few batons of cakes stacked together and a scoop of molasses ice cream. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.SERVICE - Our server was ok. Very professional but not that warm or friendly. The entire place felt somewhat stuck up. My biggest issue with this place was that I found an unknown piece of material in my gf's lamb dish. It was thin and irregularly shaped and had the consistency of plastic or wax. I showed our waiter and later a man in a suit came by (didn't introduce himself) and I was told that it was cartilage from my duck. I looked skeptical and he then asked me if I had ever butchered a duck before. (It looked nothing like cartilage and you do NOT talk down to a customer.) It was then that I told him that I  actually found it in the lamb dish my gf had and his response was ""That's interesting."" And then walked away and never acknowledged me again for the rest of the night.It was a bday celebration so I didn't want to make a fuss but this is absolutely subpar service for what is suppose to be a fine dining restaurant.PRICE - With drinks, food, and a couple desserts and coffee, we spent $160 per person. Certainly not a cheap night out.If this is the level of food and service to be expected of Daniel Boulud's restaurants, then I count myself lucky to have only had to suffer this one in the 8 years I've lived in this city. The only thing keeping this from one star was the fact that we were allowed to bring a birthday cake.",3,0,1,Peter K.,"Manhattan, NY",470,686,86
3.0,4/27/2019,"I found Cafe Boulud to be resting on its laurels and only capable of occasional jolts of excellence. The unevenness of execution was my main impression when I had a quick lunch here. I started with a wonderfully bold and delicious turnip veloute and it was immediate followed by a painfully bland and un-textured beef bourguignon, substandard in any restaurant let alone a michelin starred one. The disparity in quality was hugely disappointing.",0,0,0,Zhewei J.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,13,107

3.0,4/8/2019,"Went here for my birthday brunch .The place itself is pretty and old school French . The bread was absolutely delicious. We got a basket of the viennoiseries and let me tell you about those amazing croissants! So flakey and perfect ! It didn't come w a danish though . The oysters were AMAZING get these regardless of whatever else you get.The lamb navarin was probably the best thing on the menu to get . And the presentation was so beautiful too . I got the steak and eggs which was also pretty delicious . The dressing on the side salads on all our meals were amazing. Finally , I wish we had gotten pancakes or French toast as dessert because their dessert cart was mediocre at best . I really really wanted to love this place . But it was a little underwhelming. The host was really nice and the check in process was well done . And I know I'm  being overly picky but only bcoz this was a pricey meal 1. The guy hardly refilled my water , it was really annoying actually. 2. So after we got individual dessert from the cart , they brought out my complimentary dessert which was one of the only ones we didn't pick like why not ask someone from my party which dessert to pick or just comp one of the desserts we already picked . Made zero sense . It was a pretty crappy dessert to . Rather would not have had it .3. The cappuccino was mediocre at best and I think it's priced at $8 or somethingProbably will come back for dinner and I'm sure that'll get a 5 star review",0,0,0,Sabah S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,47,116

2.0,3/23/2019,"Unfortunately my experience here was underwhelming. My husband and I have dined at many Michelin Star restaurants and I'm perplexed at how this place was able to obtain one. Maybe it was an off night but the service was terrible and the kitchen was slow. It took over 15 minutes for someone to even notice us and serve us bread. Then by the time was got our entree it was at least 1015pm (we arrived at 830). The food is very well executed, but everything else fell short. The attention to detail in terms of service is just not here.

5.0,3/21/2019,"Cafe Boulud is probably one of the best restaurants in New York. It is the first restaurant I went to during my first visit to New York. I had dinner here with my boyfriend's family - they're regulars so they knew exactly what to order. The food was excellent - seasonal (winter) menu was great! Great to eat family-style (share everything because everything from the complimentary bread to the complimentary dessert is amazing). I ended up opting for the sea bass, which was so delicious.

4.0,2/8/2019,"Dining here is an experience. It's a journey of a culinary experience from Chef Aaron Bludorn's perspective. My friend and I got the pre-fixe dinner meal which we thought would prolly give us a chance to taste more food varieties than a la carte. The service was on point right from entering the main door to our booth. Food kept coming very quick one after another. I was pleasantly surprised with the quantity of every dish- the portions were great and very diff from one another. Started with three appetizers to share- had a bacon salad(my top pick) ,baked potatoes and a charcuterie board( my second pick). Then came the entree- I ordered the trout dish and it was beautiful presented with a sauce made with  avocado and more things.. it was so different and well cooked but very filling coz the portions were very good for such a fancy place. Along with the main entree were three side dishes to share( mac and cheese-so good!!!, beets with a cheese and cabbage with bacon).The main show stealer was the dessert phase. I call it a phase coz it had the main dessert ( chestnut bouche) with ice cream and freshly baked Madelines ( freshly baked is a whole diff story of tastefulness) . I was transported to a diff world when I had the dessert. It was the best part. I was so full by the end of this journey.The ambiance is very upscale.",1,0,1,Kristy B.,"New York, NY",219,244,413

4.0,2/5/2019,"Came with my bf during the Restaurant Week. Very solid place for traditional French food, I gave four stars because i want to believe it would be nicer during regular times. For this one time experience, I might give a 3.5 stars if I can. First, food... It's a mixture of marvelous deliciousness and some less impressive dishes. I got the cauliflower velouté and the beef burguignon, both very delicious and well presented. My bf got the arugula salad and the scottish salmon. The arugula? Well it's arugula and I don't see any michelin level execution or creativity on this dish. My bf said I made better salmon, I didn't try it so I can't really comment... The dessert, we got the pineapple upside down and the guava, both are nice, but nothing out of the world as I had high expectations for their desserts. On the other hand, the complimentary madeline they give at the end is heaven... For the food's sake, we might give it another try at some point but there are just so many choices in the city so I don't see it happening soon. Service... mixed feelings again. First, the drinks we ordered never came amd we asked twice for a drink menu before that. So obviously Cafe Boulud disapproves day drinking... Secondly, while they forgot the drink menu then the drinks, there was TOO MUCH foot traffic in the restaurant. Not only the waitstaff but also managers who circles around the room. I, for one, really hate that. I believe a good manager can be discreet in a corner while observing your customers enjoying their food, rather than marching around the room. It's not like he's socializing with customers, because that I would understand. Overall, it's not a bad experience but I do sense the chaotics during RW.",0,0,0,Chloe L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,69,0
5.0,2/3/2019,"The Brioche French Toast beyond being fun to say aloud turned a morning accidentally slamming my finger in my front door into a simply joyful one.So tender, light and moist on the inside with a perfect caramelized crisp thin crust on the outside. Though the side pourings rotate, on this happy occasion my French toast was accompanied by a citrus butter, traditional maple syrup and PASSION FRUIT WATER. The latter, well-deserving of all-caps for emphasis, made this dish for me. Not only because I have a deep passion for this fruit, but also because the equally potent and watery nature of it was so conducive to soaking and flavoring the inside of the toast. Delectable.The waiters were so sweet and gifted us a basket of madeleines at the end of our Sunday brunch.

5.0,2/3/2019,"This place definitely earned its star .Everything felt very upscale. I made reservations for 5:00PM and when I arrived, no one was there but then again, 5:00PM is slightly early for dinner. Shortly afterward, the place was very much packed.

Let's just say everything was great. The presentation of everything was superb. The fish was cooked to perfection. The duck especially was unforgettable.

The star of the soup were the oysters. The risotto can best be described as ""just food"".  It was unremarkable.

He could only open expensive places like Daniel and keep me away but he opens DBGBs, Épicerie Boulud and DB Bistro. I was here for a restaurant week visit in NYC, let the dopes go get $24.07 hamburgers. When I saw Cafe Boulud listed, my first thought was why? My second thought was sounding more like Pepé Le Pew, Let me take you in my arms my love and show me your Pate.Speaking of which, I am a fan of charcuterie and pate which Chef Boulud excels in. Its offered as a selection on their summer restaurant week menu.I also ordered the Harissa Marinated Flounder. THIS is how fish should properly be cooked. Simply outstanding.Un oh, My Pepé Le Pew is coming out..You are ze corned beef to me, and I am ze cabbage to you...Dessert.

Never let anyone make you feel uncomfortable. I'll grab the friggin guy by the neck if I have a question about the menu. Its my money and I want to enjoy how its being spent.

5.0,1/16/2019,"Sublime. That's the word that comes to mind after my Saturday meal here. I have a yearly outing to the opera and every year I choose a restaurant on wish list to visit. Cafe Boulud was the fortunate one this go around; or I should say I was the fortunate one. I felt so welcomed when I entered the space-- it almost looks like a side entrance if you're not looking for it, but when you do you're greeted with the biggest smiles. I have to say that every single one of the staff made it a point to smile or greet me and that speaks volumes. Aesthetics: Right up my alley. The art isn't overdone. There was a piece on the wall that reminded of a piece done by Paul Newman and that made me love the space even more. There were floral arrangements that one of my dates wanted to order herself or take home right then and there. So another hit there. Service: I was attended by Thanos (he's from Greece) and Rafael. Rafael handled my libations (I had the Big Bang) and Thanos was our main waiter. Both were incredibly knowledgeable about their offerings and answered every one of my questions, including their personal recommendations. Also, there was one other person, I don't want to give him another name since it's currently escaping me, but he was amazing with presenting us with complimentary baked cheese truffles and bread and really all the deliciously sinful carbs. Food/Drink: I had the shrimp and swordfish kabab with a green mango chutney and chili-ginger sauce for my primero. That swordfish? I literally paced myself so as not to finish the whole dish in seconds.  Beautifully prepared and presented. My secondi was a banana leaf wrapped red snapper served with pumpkin curry and peanut chutney. I'm done with typing quite frankly but there's more. Dessert was a pomegranite coupe-- small vanilla caked placed in a small glass with a lime foam/mousse, topped with a pomegranate littered wafer meant to be broken into the glass. Drinks will be described in pictures.Friends: Lamb Roganjosh, Yogurt Cauliflower, Striped Bass and Sunchoked Rissoto. The lamb originally came out rare, but Dafne had forgotten to mention she wanted it medium-well and when I mentioned it to Thanos, they were so quick to accommodate us.I could go on, but I think I may have inundated you.

5.0,12/18/2018,"Cafe Boulud was on my mind for a while after seeing the executive chef on The Final Table on Netflix. I was so happy that I decided on this place because it was one of my most favorite dining experiences for brunch. The quality of the dishes are amazing. You can tell the time they put into each of their dishes. For brunch we started out with the falafel arugula salad and the smoked salmon. The falafel was so good and it paired really well with the arugula (which is didn't think it would since arugula is really bitter). I wish there was more falafel for the portion of salad. The smoked salmon WAS SO GOOD. Like the slices were thick and flavorful. Absolutely delicious.For the main we had the hake fish and steak with eggs. The hake was good and the quality of fish was absolutely amazing. I wasn't super in love with it, not because it didn't taste good, but it felt too heavy to be a brunch dish. It was more of a dinner dish. The steak and eggs were so good. We asked for it to be medium rare, and it was more on the rare side, but it was still delicious. For someone to have prepared a rarer-medium rare and for me to find it good is...rare, which is why I know that they did something right with this dish! We ordered a separate side of the blueberry with speculoos and ricotta cream, which was probably our favorite dish of the entire meal. It comes with two in a stack and they're so fluffy it feels like you're eating four or five of them with each bite. The blueberries are really fresh and we tasted a hint of vanilla, which was so good. Since we went for our anniversary, they played our dessert on plates with a little candle, which was such a nice touch. It actually made our little brunch feel even more special than it already was. I got the Paris bread with coconut cream. It was such a light and refreshing end to the meal. We also got the pistachio cake, which was really decadent. After having so much food earlier on it was harder to eat because of how full we were since it was that decadent. To top it off, we were given complementary lemon macaroons/Madeline cookies (not sure) but they were pillowy and I wanted to steal them in my purse because I was so full I couldn't even manage to eat all of them. The service was impeccable. We were always attended to and it was a great experience. The cafe itself is on the smaller side, but there is more than enough room keeping the tables pretty separate so it doesn't feel like anyone is intruding on your personal space. This is one place I'd 100% come back to.",6,1,4,Elizabeth D.,"Port Jefferson, NY",198,273,412

A table at the terrace was offered and we were glad since we couls ve much more relaxed in case the baby cried.Our waiter was clearly very interested in chatting with the table beside us than serving everybody as equal clients.Because we overheard that he offered to solit the soup in two bowls so the table beside us can share, we askes him the same for us formthe first course (soup and I don't remember what else).So, when the firat course was served, the soup did not came split in two.

Secondly, why are you discriminating my table? We requested the soup solit because you offered it to the table next to us. Finally, is this what a michelin restaurant standards wants to show? A couple in a small table at the terrace sharing from same deep plate a soup? -- hey, they also ordered the LUNCH menu. But clearly that waiter was very interested in chatting with them as well.

2.0,12/9/2018,"For breakfast, decent food but not memorable or special. The service was memorably awful. The place was 1/2 to 2/3 full, and we waited 15 minutes from when we were seated until we could order coffee, and then only because I got up and asked the host to send someone to our table. No one ever checked on us; we had to flag someone down any time we wanted anything, including more coffee or even ordering food. They'd drop food at our table wordless and hurry away each time. One other patron was having words with the manager about the same issues, having to shout across the room for waitstaff who would otherwise ignore and avoid eye contact.

The host was marvelous and coordinated the dinner reservation. To their 'honesty' credit they returned the cocktail purse our guest had left in the bar.

The squash soup and foie terrine were very good, the iconic bass dish delicious but the duck was lumpish, over cooked, under sauced , cold and not a credit to the chef and certainly not Michelin grade.

My only complaint was the indifferent, unhelpful and downright rude sommelier. When she first introduced herself she was quite nice but after being summoned to help us choose a bottle of wine she seemed irritated and when we asked for her professional opinion between two different wines, her response was ""this one is heavier than that one."" Excuse me!!? This is how a sommelier in a Michelin star restaurant describes wine? Completely unacceptable especially when spending $400 for a meal and $125/bottle. I would like to thank the maitre d' who checked us in and seated us. On numerous occasions he wished my wife a happy birthday, which was quite nice.

Service sucked.  Once the room got more filled, getting someone's attention was nearly impossible.  When my friend and I decided to not finish our respective aggressively salty pastas, no one stopped by our table for 45 mins.  It was quite challenging to flag someone down.  When I asked for additional milk for my tea, I was given an espresso shot of milk.  There is simply no elegant way to pour that into my tea. Goodness, what would my UES grandmother say if she were present?  So much for attention to detail. When the server asked, ""How was the pasta?"" I responded that it was too salty.  The response was simply, ""I'll let the chef know."" There was no remedy to the situation. The chocolate dessert was the only saving grace.  Overall, service was non-existent and curt when present.  The pastas lacked flavor and punched salt down your throat. Being stuck in Michelin starred restaurant jail with terrible service and boring food is my nightmare. I didn't think it could happen, but it did.

There are few things I'd like to point it out after my dining experience. But I think out waitress did a great job, she kindly explained the menu to us and recommended the wine. She was attentive and friendly. Things I don't like: The hospitality was kind off, especially the employee who serve wine and changing settings are not friendly, not only they never greeting customers but also have a unpleasant facial expression.  The person who served bread without butter, not sure if he did that on purpose, because when I glanced at other table, I saw something different.

1.0,8/1/2018,"My husband and I have been patrons of all of Daniel Boulud's restaurants in NYC and Palm Beach for many years and have always enjoyed the food and the restaurants until recently. On Sunday 7/29/18, my husband and I came to the Cafe Boulud at about 4 p.m.  We wanted to sit outside and have a drink.  Lunch hour was over and there were about 5 occupied tables. I asked the waitress politely if we could have a drink before I sat down.  My husband arrived and before he could sit down, Mark DiPasquale the Maitre D'Hotel accosted him. He told my husband that we were not welcome at the restaurant, to please leave, and that they would not serve us.  My husband asked why?  Mr. DiPasquale said, ""Because you don't like the food and you don't like the service.""  My husband responded by telling him that this was not true. We don't like him because of the way he treats us. This is the 4th unpleasant incident that we have had with Mr. DiPasquale, all initiated by him. I sent an email to Mr Boulud 6/1/18 and received no response. I called the General Manager of the restaurant, Mr. Mbodji on his private line on 7/31/18 and received no response. Are you aware that your restaurant is a public place? Does Mr. DiPasquale know that what he did is against the law?  Does he know that discriminating against us and harassing us is against the law? Does he realize that it is against the law to refuse us service and make us feel unwelcome, which he does ever single time we come to the restaurant?

4.0,7/27/2018,"Just realize my last review here was 7+ years ago and unfortunately I've become celiac and gluten free in-between this time, which is partly why I have not been back - not being sure that there's anything for me to eat here. After reading some trip advisor reviews saying they offered GF bread, I thought I'd give it a shot during restaurant week, so here goes.Yes, they offer gf bread. It is dry, not toasted, and falls apart crumbly. I suspect they use Udis since it tends to flake that way, and would really recommend a restaurant of this caliber use better brands if not baking their own. First course, salad was the only option offered. Took a while for me to convince them to bring out the shrimp toast w/out bread but alas they did and it was rather tasty. (doctors orders, raw salad has too high a risk for foodborne illness, aside from not tasty - most celiacs are not vegetarians, contrary to popular restaurant belief)Second course was the pork. I was happy to hear they were able to do both the fish and meat option GF, and the pork indeed was delicious. No dessert, unless you want sorbet or ice cream.Overall, still a great meal since I set my expectations at only being able to have the main. But wouldn't say this place is great for those with dietary restrictions if I were picking a place to dine vs. Coming along because it was a friend/colleagues choice.

Striped bass en paupiette: Perfectly seared bass with a crispy, flavorful skin and tender inside served in a flavorful red wine reduction alongside a serving of pureed potatoes and sauteed leeks.  The leeks literally melt in your mouth.  Highly recommend.  2. Roasted Duck: Perfectly roasted duck breast with a flavorful, crispy skin and juicy breast served in duck jus and alongside scallion grits with a sprinkling of pecans and peach slices.  A great rendition of a classic with a twist (peach vs orange) and perfectly executed in both flavor and presentation.  3. Asparagus risotto; Flavorful and tender risotto with asparagus, chanterelle mushrooms and sorrel and a hint of chive.  This was light yet incredibly flavorful.  A  great vegetarian option.4. English pea soup:  Definitely so much more than your standard app!  The soup is refreshing yet indulgent with a velvet texture and well-crafted blend of flavors: pepper, pea tendrils, creme fraiche, and Parmesan.  I loved this take on a classic - the Parmesan is a nice twist and took the flavor to a new level.Overall, a wonderful option for a date or dinner with friends on the UWS that is a reflection of Daniel Boulud's mastery of flavors and presentation.",1,0,1,Danan R.,"New York, NY",924,1915,85

When I made our reservation I didn't know they had outdoor seating, but the weather was perfect on the day we visited, so we asked if we could shift to a patio table. The hostess recommended that we be seated inside on time and agreed to move us outside as soon as a table became available. Our server Michael had been informed by the reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary, and he went to great lengths to see that we had a great time. My husband had an expertly crafted Manhattan, and I had a beautiful glass of rose. For brunch, Michael recommended the skate (a first for us) which was texturally complex (moist yet flaky) and delectably balanced with a savory butter sauce and golden raisins with jasmine rice. I had the Croque Madame and when it first showed up, there was no sauce which I thought was a mistake - absolutely not. It's still a mystery how they layered so many incredible flavors into that perfect little croissant, but we delighted in every bite. They served an amuse-bouche, paper-wrapped baguette, and madeleines complementary with the table. Before our entrees arrived, they moved us to a perfect spot on the patio, where we ordered a fabulous bottle of Sancerre (also recommended by Michael) and took in the Upper East Side people watching. Towards the end of our meal, Michael sent a profiterole that has forever ruined chocolate for me. All the while he was present but not intrusive, polished yet unstuffy, and he even made some great recommendations of places to visit and stay in NYC.

4.0,5/20/2018,"The two course menu is categorized by seasonal and traditional or with Latin or Italian origins. I feel like I didn't choose correctly- everyone raved about the risotto and the gnocchi and the duck. I had the Tasmanian trout which was very nicely prepared but the veggies and sauce didn't add to the dish very much. One complaint- Don't sit by the door- there was a mighty wind every time someone enters, no matter how thick the curtains are. Service was relaxed with many extra touches from the different types of fresh breads, the chocolate truffles, to warm mandolins. Very nice evening out with friends and not an exorbitant bill. Easy to hold conversations and we didn't feel rushed. Definitely worth a visit- everyone was impressed by the meal.",0,0,0,Danielle K.,"Garden City, NY",1,62,119
3.0,5/10/2018,"I came here for brunch . Overall a good experience, great services, cozy environment, refreshing arugula salad. Very happy with bread:crispy outside and soft and chewy inside. The plating was decent. But not as good as I expected or no good surprises. The crab meat egg Benedict is a little bit disappointing, not enough moist; breading was too thick; the seasoning was dull for me. I'm still hopeful for the dinner menu but probably won't make a trip for brunch again.",0,0,0,Little M.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,5,14
4.0,5/10/2018,"I can use colorful to describe the dishes.Every dish contains multiple ingredients and food sources. For example, the chicken dish I had contains morel mushrooms, peas and a green sauce. The best part is that the chicken skin is slightly fried. The skin and the chicken meat make this dish complete.The foi gras I had was a little bit gloomy. The sauce and the raspberry jams are way too sour. Although a sour taste is needed to neutralize foi gras' fatty taste, the extreme sourness takes over the oily taste.The dessert we had impressed me. They provide a coconut and some kind of grass flavor soberly which is very fresh.The overall rating is 4*, because comparing to other Michelin restaurants, they need to craft the details of the dishes.",1,0,0,Ray Y.,"Boston, MA",14,356,509

Unfortunately that was not the case and everyone in my party felt very disappointed and annoyed.

I ordered the lunch prix-fixe three course meal. The appetizer (cod brandade) and the main course (pappardelle a la bolognese) were delicious but too salty for my taste.

4.0,3/13/2018,"I am in awe of the quality of service and food that Café Boulud provided me. I decided to stop by for lunch with a friend. We had made reservations and there was 0 wait when we arrived. We were seated immediately and had our orders taken ASAP. The sweet iced tea and coffee were free refills. We opted for whole grain bread which with butter (could be softened a bit more) which was alright. For the appetizer, we decided on the Swiss chard ravioli, which was excellent! I loved the sauces and the combination of flavors. They even give you the option of splitting the dish in two even servings in two plates. For the main course, we got the coq au vin and the scallops. It was divine! Like previously stated, the sauces are amazing. The portion sizes were perfect for lunch. They refilled our drinks throughout the meal, and picked up the dishes / cleaned the table once we were done every course as well! For dessert we got the mochi ice cream, which was okay. It wasn't sweet, but the ice cream was still too hard for both of us to enjoy. What really got me was that my friend left a hat in the restaurant and one of the workers ran ALL the way to us while we were walking down the street away from the restaurant just to give it back to us.

I had the molten chocolate cake for dessert. It was good but then they gave me some Madeleines and things went downhill again. The Madeleines were overcooked and left a bad taste in my mouth.

Now, I'm no connoisseur, but I know what hot chocolate should be. I waited a while before I drank it because it was piping hot. So when I was finally able to drink it, I was already in an Uber in Brooklyn. First sip, it tasted like pure water. I figured I got a taste of the foam. After another few sips, I realized the drink actually tasted like water. Anyway, thanks Bar Boulud. You got money you didn't even earn. I didn't get what I asked AND paid for.

1.0,2/14/2018,"I was very excited about our dinner at Cafe Boulud. It was my daughter's 20th birthday and I indicated so in the notes I left for the restaurant in the open table app. Thinks started really well. Our reservation was at 9:30 since there was nothing available before and we got there eager and hungry. The bread was delicious. Our first course also wonderful, I had a jambalaya that had layers of flavor and was smokey and delicious. My daughter had crab with tangerine, fennel, jicama, mint,and crème fraîche that was also great. Our second course was also good, I was underwhelmed by the pork (not the refinement I expected) but my daughter loved her ricotta gnocchi. The real problem was the service. When 11 o'clock came along half the waiting staff left and we felt like, all the sudden we were the proverbial Cinderella wearing rags. They hurried us, they brought a beignet that was part of my desert in a ""to go"" paper bag when we did not indicate we were leaving. They were not bringing the petit madeleines they had brought for every other table nor the round bonbons. We had to ask for it. The maitre brought the bill before I asked and tried to take it away before I had a chance to put my card in the fold. Of course no acknowledgement was made of my daughter's birthday. Not worthy of the star Michelin. If you are so eager to go home early, do not take late reservations. I left the restaurant, after paying a pretty penny, mad, disappointed and feeling mistreated. I won't be back nor will I recommend it to my friends. The cuisine was great but the way you treat your costumers, when they invest you with the privilege and power of making a memory (my daughter's 20th) is even more important. They failed. They wrecked it. So sad.",1,0,1,Cristina R.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,16,17
5.0,2/11/2018,Café Boulud doesn't need a review from me.

Everything from the appetizer to the dessert was superb. It's clear why this is a Michelin rated restaurant.I have to stretch hard to find anything to complain about and the only thing I would say would be that the butter could have been softer for the bread that was served.

Everyone is eager to get it, so be mindful of a bit of rudeness. You know what I'm saying?!?!We were seated near the door, there was a draft, so we asked to be moved to another table, easy breezy, I'm on it today. No problem.  I was not aware of the fanfare behind this restaurant, I discovered this only when I told my coworker where I went and she's like, Oh!!!!I digress.The wine selection was amazing, we were considering the La Tache, but decided to be a bit more practical. (8.9K$/bottle, no typo).Ended up getting the classic Moscow Mule, but it didn't have a copper cup or rim. It was good and strong though. The bread comes out in a scone shaped roll, You pull it apart and it is pre-sliced. There is a pre fixe (sp?) menu. I chose the prosciuterrie board. I wasn't a fan of it. But, I could see people loving it.The entrée I chose was the steak and eggs. The steak was tender. came with a side of greens and a roasted tomato. The egg was perfectly poached and there was a potato cake. I'm sure there's fancier terms, but the presentation was nice.I ended it with a molten lava chocolate cake. It was literally amazing and the best thing I had that weekend, and I had a lot of good food. I would go back for that alone. My fiancée got the 3 scoops of ice cream, I didn't like that as much.They also made a dessert art, writing congratulations on the dish, to celebrate the special engagement.Side note: world famous billionaires eat here. I looked to my right and I see a world famous person, actually, one of my heroes! don't want to out them because I'm sure they enjoy eating there.

5.0,1/22/2018,"What I loved most about Cafe Boulud was how the lunch progressed from dish to dish. Just as a note: I came here for restaurant week so I can't vouch too much for how the restaurant is on a normal basis (and at normal prices). I started out with the arugula and grapefruit salad and was actually kind of disappointed here. Now I don't like salads in general very much, but the dressing was a bit harsh on this so I didn't enjoy it that much. Also a quick note: we got a variety of breads (which were all delicious) and a small complimentary starter (a crispy ravioli with a vegetable/orange puree inside). Even though the salad was disappointing, the rest of the meal was extraordinary and was good enough to overcome the initial starter to get a five star rating. I had the Scottish salmon with spinach & potatoes and it was an absolutely perfectly cooked salmon. The meat was flaky, the skin was crispy, and the sauces were light and paired well with the fish. Delicious!For dessert, I got the cheesecake with pomegranate sauce and a sorbet on top and this was really where Cafe Boulud earned its five stars. This was quite possibly one of the best desserts I've had in my life and I really couldn't get enough of it. There was a really nice punch from the pomegranates which gave the overall dessert a great flavor! Oh, and we got complimentary fresh baked madelines as well which were warm and fluffy and SO good.

We followed this with the Wild Mushroom Risotto, Crab Cake Eggs Benedict, Roasted Monkfish, Café Boulud ""Croque Madame"", Vermont Egg Omelette, and Duck Confit... basically the whole menu. I tried a little bit of everything but the two that stuck with me were the roasted monkfish and the wild mushroom risotto. The monkfish was to die for.

4.0,12/14/2017,"Oui, oui, we wanted French for our last meal in the city and decided to go fine dining. As part of Chef Daniel Boulud's empire and having garnered a Michelin star, their 3-course lunch prix fixe for $45 was very hard to pass up on. Reservations were made in advance and though we called twice to extend our seating time due to being behind schedule, they were very accommodating. Coats were checked and we were lead to a brightly lit dining room that was packed even on a Monday. The atmosphere was upscale yet very relaxed. Our server gave us ample time to go over the menu and assured us we could go off the pre-fixe menu if we wanted to, but that also meant a la carte pricing.The Potato Leek Soup was an apt starter on that wet and cold morning. Rich in texture yet light in flavor, the soup was delicious and more so when paired with the potato chip garnish. My daughter chose the Escargot En Vol-Au-Vent 9($26) for her 1st course which was not part of the pre-fixe. Encased in a hollow puff pastry, the pieces of snail were plump and earthy with tasty notes of garlic and parsley. She said this was the best version she's had and I have to agree after sharing this plate with her. For our mains, Duck Confit for everyone on the table. As much as I normally like ordering various things to try, I let everyone be this time which meant 3 plates of duck for my fam. Not very wise but at least we all ate that luscious poultry with crisp skin and a beautiful layer of fat before hitting the dark juicy meat. Now I have Cafe Boulud up there with Balthazar for my best Duck Confit experience.I had the Persimon Bread Pudding for dessert with the Grand Marnier ice cream as the cherry on my cake but their house-made Madeleines were absolutely to die for. I am going to dream of these bite-sized delights for quite some time.The food was great and the service, stellar.

If I had to choose between the two, I'd say the combinations in the salad outdid the fish. The fish was fried and essentially bland, while the accoutrements did little to add any flavor. Considering the time it takes to get up this far north, I doubt that I'll ever go back.

4.0,12/6/2017,"This is one of the few spots in the city whose patrons still wear coats and ties just because they're there! Not the business crowd that descends on midtown steakhouses at 5pm every Tuesday but customers that still believe in dressing up for dinner. My Dad actually yelled at my older brother for showing up in a polo shirt (tucked in of course).The self enforced dress code here tells you a lot you need to know about the restaurant. It is very generously staffed with waiters and managers and busboys hovering about the whole place making sure every need is attended to. Every employee is courteous and friendly and elegantly attired. The man who was pouring our water graciously took our cocktail order and had it right out while a manager and a waiter came over to ask if there was anything we needed in our first few minutes there.It's important to remember that despite the white glove service, high end French cuisine and accordingly hefty pricetag, this place is a cafe. It has tables placed very close together and is a very bustling and noisy atmosphere, although your meal can stretch for hours you get the sense that you're being constantly moved along - not hurried but there is always someone waiting to attend to your next need. I like this vibe, you're waited on hand and foot but never hassled.The cocktails were outstanding. Their unifying characteristic was smoothness. Too often negronis are made with too much vermouth and old fashioneds with too much sugar. There was just a touch of sweetness in the negroni and the old fashioned was made with just a dash of simple syrup - combined with great shelf spirits, some of the better pre-dinner drinks I've had. The wine list can get into four digits but if you don't feel like dropping a house payment on your grape juice, their less expensive options are still excellent and they don't mark them up as much as the pricier options so as to make it an accessible dining option to those with thriftier inclinations. They had incredible champagnes, I've only seen La Caravelle rose at one other restaurant in the city. The whites, like their Chavignol Sancerre and IGP Val de Loire were all delicious. I don't recall the name of the red we drank with dinner but it was excellent.The menu changes here frequently, they have seasonal dishes and options that are influenced by the tastes of a select country (for our particular meal it was Japan) at any given time. For appetizers, I got a taste of both soups. They had a billi bi soup with saffron, mussels, and potatoes which was incredible. It was light and at once filling, very rich and creamy and the seafood and potatoes were cooked perfectly. It was nice that they prepared them separately but they were served hot and then had the saffron soup and creme fraiche poured on afterwards. The potage lyonnais was equally delicious, pumpkin and gruyere and perfect for a late November night. So many seasonal options fail to cater to the weather but you could tell this restaurant's chef is specifically tailoring dishes to what any customer might like to eat on a cool late Fall night.I ate the magnolia leaf wrapped duck for an entree - the Japanese option. It was some of the best duck I've ever eaten. Perfectly medium rare, crispy skin, the dark meat creatively grated and ground into a spicy croquette. The scallion marmalade was an incredible accompaniment, very sharp cooked onion flavor and great to rub a little on the duck breast. My brother had the striped bass which I got a bite of, equally awesome, while my sister had the venison. This was actually a little weaker than the other dishes - it was served in puff pastry (deer wellington you might call it) and had garlic wrapped up in it. Probably the only hiccup in the service took place right before our entrees came out. The waiter came out with the venison (served for two) and asked my dad if it looked good. Ten minutes later after he had taken it away, we still did not have any of our entrees. My dad asked him what had happened to it and he said it needed to finish being cooked and would be brought out with the other entrees. This was obviously a fib, it had been cooked perfectly and was obviously done, the other dishes just weren't ready - had they stuck it back in the oven for ten minutes, the pastry would have been burnt to black! You could tell it had been sitting under the heat lamp, pastry was a little soggy. This was my only complaint but considering the prices here, my dad and sister were justifiably annoyed, especially considering the waiter's explanation was so clearly a load of pigswallow.The desserts were phenomenal. Their chocolate souffle with creme anglaise is the best I've ever tasted. I would definitely come back here for a special occasion, we were there for my mom's 65th and everyone left happy! Our meal stretched out over three hours that seemed like just one!

Favorites were the croissants, they were perfectly flaky. Recommend trying the bread basket or at least ordering it separately. The crab cake benedict is alright, would choose the smoked salmon benedict instead. Real winner is the croque madam (again the croissant). The orange juice tastes as if it were watered down it is not worth it. The cappuccinos are great though.

5.0,9/27/2017,"We came last minute on a Sunday night because I had a craving for duck and since it had been a while since I splurged a bit. Cafe Boulud did not disappoint. Sunday night reservations were relatively easy, pretty wide open I'd say. Upon arriving I was a little taken aback by the ""stuffiness"" with guests in suits and proper waiters, while my husband and I arrived pretty casual. But we were treated no different. The menu is separated by 4 different sections (Traditional / Summer flavors / Vegetarian / Lebanese) - with recommended appetizer and entree dishes that pair well, but they don't limit you to stick to that section. We had the octopus appetizer and lamb entree from Lebanese and the foie gras tortellini (from specials) and Duck from summer flavors. Everything was excellent and perfectly cooked/executed. The duck, thankfully, was the standout for me. The perfect amount of crust, sweet compliment of flavors, cooked just right at medium rare to give that perfect moist + crunch balance. The lamb was similar - though I'm not a huge fan of lamb, in typical high-end French restaurant fashion, they delivered a perfect sear and a lamb that was super tender that went well with yogurt and a Lebanese-based flavor profile.  We finished with a nice, crisp and refreshing lychee based sorbet (""tropical delice"").  Not a cheap meal, but we were stuffed and I couldn't ask for any more in any part of the dining experience. Definitely would come back!",7,7,7,Lu H.,"New York, NY",294,570,1967

4.0,9/10/2017,"While the service was a bit curt and uninviting, the food was delicious, and the complimentary madelines at the end won me over. I came here for restaurant week lunch, and reservations were a hit hard to secure. Note that they do have outside seating which would be nice on a cool fall day.The meal starts with an amuse bouche, which was this flatly ravioli shaped pastry filled with spinach. The pastry was nice and buttery, and the inside spinach filling was very flavorful, but not moist enough to overcome the dryness of the pastry. The bread was also delicious a well, and I love that they asked if I wanted seconds!I started with the deep fried croquettes with the trout. The croquettes were very light and perfectly crispy. The trout was a strange addition in my opinion, because I didn't think it paired particularly well with the croquettes or the sauce, and I just found it overly salty. For the main course I got the pork loin with polenta. The pork was a laughable portion, as it was 3 insanely thin slices of pork. The pork itself was decently cooked, but I wish they were a bit more generous with the portions on the pork. I loved the addition of the grilled peaches as the apple sauce. The polenta was okay, not too gummy, but a bit bland.The desert was a delicious blueberry tart? Which was very soft and fragrant. The blueberries were perfectly tart which complimented the dish well.The complimentary madelines at the end were amazing. They give you a cute little ""bag"" of madeleines for you to finish at the table. They were fresh out of the oven, and dusted with a bit of sugar. They were sweet and light, and the perfect way to end the meal. Overall a nice experience, but the service was a bit of a letdown. They pretty much threw the plates on my table which surprised me.

The staff was courteous and I sat outside, reveling in the sights and sounds of upper east side while enjoying Chef Daniel Boulud's creations. The amuse-bouche was a  tasty mashed green peas-cheese pastry and bread and butter was served throughout the courses. I enjoyed both breads, though the raisin one a little less. I started with the Gazpacho- a cold tomato soup which pleasantly surprised me with a burst of sweetness when I bit into pieces of melon. I'm a hot soup person and this soup opened my eyes to the possibility of enjoying a cold one. The second course was a tomato sauce spaghetti with eggplant, skinned grape tomatoes and cream. The eggplant was possible air fried- it had no moisture at all and made for an interesting change of texture when it comes to consuming eggplant. This was a good dish, but not the greatest spaghetti I've ever had. The dessert took the cake- the blueberry tart was so soft I could die! The accompanying apricot gelato was a little tart but the little drops of white chocolate and blueberries balanced it out pretty well. The sugar plate with almonds made me enjoy the dessert more (by slowing my pace down a little) and they served Madelines! Oh, my dessert-loving heart!

I had Cod Brandade, Roasted Pork Loin, and Pavlova and ll three dishes were extremely disappointing. I was dining with a friend who was visiting NY from another country and she did not finish any of her dishes and I felt sorry.  Again, the service was nice but it was so crowded (probably because of the Restaurant Week) and did not feel like fine dining at all.

I am a food snob and traditionalist when it comes to my native Lebanese cuisine, but their twist on the lamb chop was so good that I was speechless after the first bite. I never thought mujadara would go so amazingly well with lamb chop.

4.0,11/24/2016,"**Thanksgiving three-course prix fixe menu review, 2016**It was possibly the best brunch I had in New York City so far. Staff is all very nice and friendly, creating a warm holiday atmosphere in the air. The room is bright, comfortable and classic (golden mirrors, paintings, and carpet). Of course, everything is hearty and delicious. It is the kind of place that I would love to come back with my family every Thanksgiving!Highly recommend the Heritage Spanish Black Turkey, Striped Bass, Molten Chocolate Cake with vanilla ice cream, and the impressive warm madeleines served with dessert (complimentary). The tender and flavorful turkey meat is served with sweet squash sauce and seasonal cranberry sauce. One naturally sweet and creamy, the other savory and refreshing--both sauces made the dish a lot more interesting. Striped Bass has a rich and creamy aroma that goes perfectly well with smashed potato. The Molten Chocolate Cake is sooooo good that I literally ate it nonstop!It was a lovely surprise that they also gave us gifts after the meal--Turkey sandwich and pumpkin cake. Who doesn't love Thanksgiving leftovers?! What a brilliant and warm idea to add family traditions to the restaurant meal experience. I can't wait to eat it tomorrow!Notes: 1. Thanksgiving meal is $135pp 3-course pre fixe with lovely lunch bag as gift. Regular brunch is priced at ~$50 for 3-course (a great deal)! 2. Outdoor seats available.3.

I have to say this place was five star all the way.First - Service; impeccable from the initial greeting through paying the bill, Renata lead an all star team with a total focus on customer satisfaction. We had 7 distinct individuals serve us to include the Maitre d' Second - Food; simply delicious, from bread, through the fall pear watercress salad and croquettes to the lamb and crab farfalle and culminating in honey creme brûlée and chocolate profiteroles every plate was beautiful and every bite mouthwatering. Just as we wrapped up with coffee a special surprise of mini madeleines which were so light they melted in your mouth.Third - Wine; we went with the Sommelier's recommendations for the Prix-fixe menu the white burgundy was crisp, minerally and a perfect start. Switching to the Langoudoc for a red with the lamb and finally moving to an Italian ( neither were quite as good as the burgundy but both were good)Finally, yes I will pay a bit more for an excellent meal so if you can afford it treat yourself.

5.0,11/9/2016,"We returned to NYC for a quick anniversary getaway with our toddler since leaving in 2014. I miss the NYC  food scene and knew I had to visit one of the many celebrity chef or highly rated restaurants in the city. Ill be honest and say that Cafe Boulud was my second choice along with Eleven Madison Park. I initially inquired at Le Bernadin but the staff I spoke to was so condescending and rude the moment I said I had a toddler like it was so wrong to ask but that's a different review altogether.Both Eleven Madison Park and Cafe Boulud had exceptionally trained staff that understands the changing facet of tourism and fine dining and that people such as myself, would rather expose my child early on to proper dining etiquette and appreciate real food over McDonalds and the usual kiddie fare of predictable and boring staples. As expected and so as not to disturb other diners, we booked early dinner at 545pm. We opted for Cafe Boulud since they offered an Ala Carte menu compared to Eleven Madison Park's (3) hr tasting menu (also EMP stresses they do not have high chairs while Cafe Boulud immediately asked if I needed one).The service was a bit spotty in the beginning with our table server forgetting the presence of one of my companion's, first with the menu, second for his order but we are not uptight despite the $ we're shelling out so it's all good; what's important is she was genuinely mortified and apologized and didn't do it again for the remainder of the evening. She was spot on moving forward and attentive and truly personable, so much so that my toddler asked her to pick her up and hold her for a few minutes.The food...THIS is why I miss NYC. It was more than just on point; it was exceptional to say the least. I had foie gras, my friends had risotto with shaved white truffle and my hubby had the scallops as starters. There were absolutely no complaints and if we could all lick our plates we would have--and that's just the first course! For the second course, I had the lamb, and it was at the correct temperature and was absolute heaven that I didn't even notice what the rest of the table was having and was happy as a hippo ;) We had varying desserts and they scribbled ""Happy Anniversary"" on one of the platters which is a small gesture but truly appreciated. My friends raved about the molten cake and I saw that it was just an oozy, glorious flow of chocolate, so decadent. They also offered us madeleines and chocolates to cap our evening.Thank you Cafe Boulud for welcoming my daughter to your establishment and making our short visit to NYC memorable. I look forward to dining with you again during our next visit.",0,0,0,Rachel C.,"Chicago, IL",15,34,11
5.0,11/3/2016,"Oh my, my! Totally worth every penny, especially when lunch special for three courses is $45. Since I've been at the city, I read lots of articles about Daniel Boulud and his talent. Since Daniel is a higher end, I went for cafe Boulud to try first. From the starting small plates to the ending dessert, it fulfilled my total expectations and some hype behind it. I already look forward to coming back!The starting freebie was a small pastry with local honey inside. It is actually one highlight of the lunch for me. I swallowed it in two bites, and resisted a lot to ask for more. What came more is two kinds of bread, sour dough and raisin bread. Because I had small appetite, I only ordered raisin bread, which is also surprisingly good.The New Black: Love it, love it, love it! This could be my favorite drink in 2016. It's sweet and a little sour, with no bitter in it. Actually, hard to describe. You need to try it to love it.Watercress & Frisée Salad: Even though I was not a big fan of salad, I tried to taste the fresh veggies they had. I adored the idea of putting bean srpouts, and whole watercress and frisee in the plate with others. No wastes. Lemon-sumac vinaigrette was awesome and fresh.Roasted Pork Loin: I began to understand pork loin better after this dish. The way they chose the cut was important to the way it tasted. These fat inside and out made pork loin juicy, yet not fatty; tender, yet not soft. Pine Nut & Lemon ""Trifle"": Well dimensioned. Honestly, not your typical sweet ice cream dessert. It's bland and sweet and bitter flavor to sum it up. I didn't really get all the ingredients and how this flavor is better than normal sweet ones, but hey, it's different and healthy and cheap *COUGH*. Service is almost great, but they did forgot about my third course. The bread server is especially welcoming.",2,1,1,Qiaoyi X.,"Manhattan, NY",102,168,282

5.0,10/22/2016,"What a delightful experience. This is my first chance to eat at a Michelin-starred restaurant and I was a little intimidated by the idea. Cafe Boulud's waitstaff were the friendliest people and set us at ease right away. The first thing that really stood out for me was when the waitress said, ""Have fun with the menu, "" when she told us that the lunch menu was arranged in suggested pairings for appetizers and entrees, but we were assured that we could choose anything in any order.Throughout the meal, the staff was as adorable and pleasant as possible.I chose the 3-course prix fixe menu, my companions mixed and matched. After we had ordered, the server came around with a platter of fried ravioli filled with ratatouille and ricotta. Our eyes rolled back in our heads and we later used the delicious fresh bread to mop up the remaining sauce. (When then bread comes around, chose the mini-baguettes. Just do it.)My appetizer, a salmon poke ( a Hawaian raw fish method) with mango was stellar. So was the fois gras terrine. The potage Lyonnaise was good, but not special, as was the arugula and beet salad For our entrees I won again with the harissa lamb sausage. We all agreed it was fantastic. So was the duck with the most interesting little meat and rice balls, and the leek and goat cheese agnilotti. The poulet was, again, solid.As I was the only one who ordered the prix fixe, I had dessert, so I chose the chocolate roulade with pink peppercorn ice cream. We were split on the ice cream, I and one companion thought it fascinating, the others were less impressed.For a special day out, a date to impress, or just for a truly excellent meal in a comfortable location with fantastic staff, I recommend this restaurant. With excellent wine and very delicious coffee (and the freshly baked madelines that came with the coffee) we all agreed that Cafe Boulud was an experience worth the money we paid for it - and worth repeating as soon as possible.",0,2,0,Patience S.,"Morristown, NJ",3,108,20

Bread was offered to us a couple of times,  and our glass of water was never empty.  The reason for my 3 stars is actually because of the appetizers that was ordered as a part of a prefix menu for lunch.  My friend and I ordered the Steak Tartare which visually was stunning but Extremely Salty.  Unfortunately because of the saltiness of the dish you don't really taste the freshness of the steak nor any other flavors that the ingredients should have provided.  (Both plates were equally salty). The second appetizer was the Brocolli soup which was missing salt and not hot enough.  The main course for all four of us was excellent.  The Scottish salmon was perfectly cooked on both plates,  the pan Roasted poussin was juicy and the stripped bass delicious.  The Dessert was very good as well,  the Chocolate Lava cake was amazing and perfectly combined with a delicious spoon of vanilla bean ice cream.  The chocolate cremeux was also good.",2,0,0,Katty L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,10,22

5.0,9/20/2016,"We had the pleasure of dining tonight at this delightful Upper Eastside, Michelin-rated eatery.  With its offering quartet of themes plus specials, traditional, seasonal, market vegetarian, and at this writing, Columbian influenced dining choices, it was a challenge to select what appealed more. Better yet, they welcomed mixing and matching as the pallet dictated.  My wife enjoyed the Summer Vegetable salad, while I chose the Ceviche des Mariscos, delicious mildly spicy mixture of shrimp, octopus, scallop, tomato, and yucca. She went with the perfectly cooked grilled scallops with lemongrass-lobster bisque, and I chose the whole Columbian Seabass with coconut rice, peppers, papas criollas(Columbian style fries potatoes), lime, and a popular Columbian seasoning called triguisar.  All that remained on my dish were a few scattered bones. Desert was off the charts with a torta negra, coffee ganache, coconut dulce mousse, and chocolate ice cream. My wife's choice, a tasty Concord grape linzer, with lime custard, cashew sable, and Concord grape sorbet.  Our excellent sever, Renata,  finished it off, and us as well, with a basket of just baked madeleines. We had to walk the 20 blocks back to our place to justify our lack of control. It was well worth it.   Also of note, many places we go are so noisy, we can't really enjoy the other most important part of dining, good conversation.  The restaurant was packed, and yet my wife and I were actually able to converse without lip reading.",0,0,0,D D.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,28,5

Menu-- good luck-- literally 16 choices, from starters to main. Not clear descriptions. This would be fine if the servers were any help. SERVERS-- this is CB's biggest -- hugest-- problem! Your servers (this is turning into a direct letter to the establishment , I'm afraid). cannot properly communicate with your guests! I saw this not only with our table of 5, but with your guests dining around us. No one.. NO ONE could understand your servers, AND your servers not only seemed to have no concern for this, they appeared to take pride in the fact that  the English language was beneath them, as was the diners who could not understand them.   Point in case-- I ordered an appetizer, after trying to talk through the order with our ""server"" thinking this was going to be seafood dish -It arrived at our table as soup! Nowhere in the menu description or in my quasi- conversation with our waiter was the word soup-- consume-- broth-- runny-- saucy-- .... I love a soup! Nothing against soup. I'm sure this was an earthshaking soup, but shouldn't the menu or the server say ""soup"" at some point? The menu should not start a guessing game! Life is complicated-- nice suppers should not stress out your diners! (Wish I could place infinite explanation marks after that one!)My sea bass was not special.

4.0,7/27/2016,"This was my third time enjoying a restaurant week here. My first restaurant week at Café blue was in 1999 when the meal was $19.99 and it was so memorable that my friend and I made a promise that we would come back for restaurant week's in the years to follow. I would give the restaurant five stars for all of my meals their combined. But today's meal had some high points and some average points. Never any low points. The seared tuna appetizer as you can see from the picture was stunning - all those little polkadots were intense little beads of flavor from shiso leaf to  sesame to a refreshing lemon essence. My friend had the arugula salad not pictured and she said it was fantastic. I had the salmon and it was good but sad to say it wasn't anything to write home about. My friends really liked their main dishes: the eggplant ravioli and the pork loin both pictured here. We tried all three desserts offered and while they had some very yummy elements they were slightly off the mark. My lemon tart let had great flavor in the creamy lemon curd but the biscuit underneath was too hard to cut with my fork I had to actually ask for a knife. My friend had the ice cream sandwich which was nothing especially stunning but of course who doesn't like strawberry ice cream with oatmeal cookies. The other dessert was the brownie with cherry sorbet and again that was a very delicious dessert but none of these blew me away. Hence the four star review.  The service was good as expected but not outstanding (having eaten at Daniel with these same two friends we experienced service like you could only imagine in your dreams so I think we got a bit spoiled in the past). The bottom line is we each paid $40 total including a tip for a beautifully prepared three-course meal in a nice butt traditional dining room and had some very tasty mouthfuls. Considering a mediocre meal in New York costs $40 if not more, this was a very very enjoyable meal.

5.0,4/27/2016,"Every detail at this restaurant is thoughtfully considered and it comes through, most importantly, in the food.  I had a delicious meal here for a special occasion and before I forget I wanted to write about it.First of all, this is a place where you want to dress well.  I went for dinner and was comfortable in a suit, no tie.  Everyone there is dressed well so do yourself and them a favor and look nice.We had several plates to share to begin.  The mixed salad with savory green dressing along with asparagus crowns was delicious.  Likewise the cold pate with the house bread was also excellent.  My wife had the pea soup which couldn't have been better, just deliciously pureed peas with unknown but delightful seasoning.For the main course my wife had the white fish (forget the kind) with sea foam.  She loved it.  I had the chicken with morel mushrooms.  The flavor of mine was creamy, savory and absolutely perfect.  The only complaint I had was that it came with only a tiny sliver of an actual morel mushroom.  Having the name of the dish be ""chicken with morel mushrooms"" I would have like to have seen a plurality of them on my plate.  Anyhow, the taste did not suffer at all because it was really that good.Dessert was excellent too, as were our espressos after.",0,0,0,A O.,"New York, NY",2,140,2
5.0,4/14/2016,"Surprisingly, there aren't many restaurants open early on weekdays, so I was extremely pleased to find that Cafe Boulud was open at 8AM on a Tuesday. Already a big fan of Chef Daniel Boulud, plus, the Michelin Star is certainly a bonus.The restaurant is beautiful and very relaxing. We all opted for coffee and it was delicious. I'm not particularly fond of cafe and this one was fantastic.Steak & Egg ($26): Confit tomato, Pommes Rosti, market greens, sunny side-up egg.Monte Cristo ($22): Sunny side-up egg, Jambon de Paris, Camembert, fig jam, roasted potatoes, market greens.Wild Mushroom Quiche ($19): Arrowleaf spinach, goat cheese, chives, market greens, roasted potatoes.The food was phenomenal. The steak was amazing - both flavor and texture; it was wonderfully tender. The Pommes Rosti, a crispy cube of creamy potatoes was a group favorite, though the roasted potatoes were just as scrumptious.

I had a plate of foie gras and it was just heavenly. OMG! I don't think I've ever tasted anything that good it was almost sinful! For the second course, I had boeuf bourguignon with fall vegetables and mashed potato. The taste? Oh, forget about that - the chefs here are trained professionals. They have a solid grasp on the flavor, presentation, and just about everything else. In French, I would say it's suuuuparre! Yes, you know the drill, reservation is a must here. Yes, you can't show up like a bum and yes there are a lot of old rich folks here, but they're rather nice, or maybe not - then again, who cares? As long as they're not in my face and digging my food. I'm cool with that. The service was meticulous. The server was very professional, knowlegeable, and very attentive without making you feel like they're too attentive. My server was very very nice, he gave us dessert on the house just because it was Christmas eve. What a nice guy! Overall, two thumbs up from me. One caution though, they do have an exhaustive wine list. It would help if you know what you want or at least hone down on the region that you like.

5.0,3/16/2016,"My girlfriend and I originally had a reservation at DBGB but due to unforeseen construction we had to reschedule (twice). It was our four year anniversary. The manager at DBGB, Mike, was a really nice guy, and suggested going to a sister restaurant, and he recommended Cafe Boulud. He also said they would provide a complimentary bottle of champagne and would be taken care of. And I have to say, we were certainly taken care of. We were given the best table in the restaurant, closed off and romantic. We also received a complimentary bottle and we were treated very well by Sharif, the manager at Cafe Boulud. I was originally upset about spending much more than I would at DBGB, but the service was first class, as well as the food. My girlfriend and I did not love the menu at first glance, but we have to say that everything we ordered was fantastic. We loved the Compte Ravioli, and the Sea Trout as appetizers. The striped bass was great, and I'd have to say the Pork Belly was some of the best pork belly I've ever had. Also delicious desserts and yummy madeleines as well.

2.0,2/22/2016,"Perhaps I'm being a little harsh with 2 stars, but I left the restaurant quoting the exact description in my head ""I've had better...""To start, we had a 5:30 reservation but was not seated until around 5:45PM.  Minor detail, but felt it was worth mentioning since I would expect a fine dining restaurant to have all their food preparations (will revisit this topic shortly) and team huddles well before opening.Service:  I'm from the Los Angeles area and perhaps this will skew my expectations as I know culturally, social norms are different on the West Coast vs East Coast.  I felt the service was dry and impersonal.  There was no welcoming or inviting greeting from our server, no introduction of names, no special welcoming or thank you for joining us tonight...  However, I acknowledge and appreciate the service was prompt, quick, and attentive to details (such as refilling water glasses, asking if we'd like more bread).  I guess I just miss the more personal friendly touch that I've experienced elsewhere.Food:  the quality and ingredients of the food were expected.  everything seemed ""fresh"" (common saying for people that think they are professional connoisseurs, right?).  The flavors were rich and portions were small.  Very typical of fine dining..  But there was nothing about the food that made it stand out from other fine dining restaurants.  I left with no impression in terms of the uniqueness or specialness of the food.  Lastly, my pet peeve.  COLD BUTTER!!!!!  the butter for the bread was ice cold because it had just been removed from the refrigerator.  I politely asked if our butter could be ""warmed"", and was given a questionable judgmental look in return...  The response was ""we will get you more butter.""  It came back slightly less cold, but still rock hard...  This is where I mention that perhaps there is a lack of food planning preparation.  For butter to be spread on room temperature bread, I was expect the butter to be at least room temperature as well.  If this is the case, the kitchen chef should have preparations in place to remove something simple like butter from the refrigerator 1-2 hours before opening.  I'm not sure if they intentionally serve their butter cold but as a paying customer for high priced food, something simple like asking to have my butter warmed seems like a simple request.Should I visit New York again, the thought of returning to this restaurant wouldn't even cross my mind.",0,0,0,Michael H.,"Westminster, CA",0,11,6

5.0,2/6/2016,"Having been to Daniel a few years ago, I immediately wanted to try out his other establishments. Daniel Boulud, you never fail to impress me! We came in for Restaurant Week lunch and we both had a good time even though we were in a bit of a time crunch(1 hour parking about 5 blocks away). We had briefly mentioned it at the coat check and our plates came as quick as they could - probably also because we ate a little quicker than usual too. Our server definitely picked up on it and I think the lady at coat check must've mentioned it to our server too because if you looked at other tables, their plates didn't come as quick. I like that attention to detail. What we ordered:- Arugula Salad w/ grapefruit, almonds, ricotta salata, tarragon, white balsamic vinaigrette: fresh and light, it was a perfect starter for me- Duck Terrine w/pickled vegetables, grilled sourdough: full of flavor and by far, one of the best terrines we have had (2nd to the one we had in Paris)- Pot au Feu w/ brussels sprouts, turnips, bone marrow toast: tender and pull-apart-easy beef was so delicious and the bone marrow toast was perfect. Wish I could have more of the toast. Mmm.- Scottish Salmon w/ sunchoke, fennel, parsley oil sauce maltaise: My bf had this dish, and I was much too engaged with my pot au feu, but I had a small bite of his salmon and it was cooked perfectly- Coconut Flan w/ pineapple, passion fruit guava sorbet: the flan has a slightly thicker consistency than the caramel flans at spanish restaurants. Great coconut flavor, but my favorite from that was definitely the passion fruit guava sorbet! Sweet and tangy!- Gingerbread Gateau w/pear bavarois, praline, coffee ice cream: this cake was pretty tasty, but didn't wow me much. The winning dessert for me had to be the coconut flanAnd the finale, those little madeleines we LOVE so much! They are warm, soft, and tasty with a tiny hint of orange flavor.....I would eat a big box of them right then and there if I could! For $25 for a 3 course lunch, it was an eye opener to the delectable creations Cafe Boulud has to offer. Combined with their service and attention to detail from the plate settings to YOU, as a patron, it is easily one of the restaurants I know I will definitely be back for.

However I disagree with other posts that it's snobby. Everyone was nice despite knowing we weren't spending as much (though we do always rack up a bill with drinks... Oops). We dressed more formally but people were in jeans and tshirts (definitely NOT appropriate) but they weren't treated any differently.The bread at his place was great with three to choose from and the bread guy kept comi around. Kudos to him. Our waiter made sure to explain the menu and answer any questions.Is started with the celery root velouté, a thick creamy, flavorful soup. Entree was a spinach can ravioli with mushrooms. Probably the best vegetarian entree I've ever ordered. Granted I've probably only ordered like three in my life.Desert was good. Except the chocolate cake was dry but I had gothams cake the day before so it's not a fair comparison. Another great think is their wine. No bar in the restaurant, they walk across the hall to bar boulud for drinks but the wine list is good. We did the suggested wine pairing and had a savoie sore month that was so good I had to get it the next day (and only $12 a glass).

The amuse came out a little bit too hot, the butter came out a little bit too cold, and my (OK) cappuccino came out utterly undrinkably hot.

Smoked salmon toast to kickoff, pan seared brenzino to fill up my rave, and Mandarin orange entremet to cleanup my palate (or probably open up even more?). As a fish lover, I enjoyed my well executed fish with a crispy touch to the outside. The orange shortcake was refreshing and had the right level of sweetness.

5.0,12/22/2015,Daniel Boulud is my favorite French chef. Cafe Boulud and Daniel. Are my 2 fav places to eat on the UES. I eat here once a month. The ability to keep the ingredients simple and pure blows me away every time I eat here. The easiest way to get to café Boulud is to tell the driver to take you to the Surrey hotel! Or you could just walk there. Cafe Boulud is located in the surrey hotel on 76th. In between 5th and Madison. When you walk into the doors of the Surrey. To your left is bar Pleiades. To your right will be cafe Boulud. During the summer you can sit outside. If you are coming here for breakfast lunch or dinner I recommend calling advance and make reservations. You can also make reservations online. The manager Jason is extremely nice and very accommodating. Last week I came here and I made reservations for 2 o'clock. I ended up showing up just passed 3 o'clock. Jason was extremely nice and made the a commendation for the kitchen to still prepare lunch for me. Thank you Jason. I have read some of the reviews about individuals saying that they felt like they were being stared at because they weren't dressed accordingly. New York is different than any other city. I know how it can be It's my hometown. You can tell who is a local and who isn't. You have to do your research on the place before you just go there. Every time I have eaten here I am one of the youngest people. There is a silent set of rules in New York that you wouldn't understand unless you lived here or grew up here especially on the UES. The food at cafe Boulud is fantastic. It's simple but can be extravagant. The staff is very knowledgeable with pairings and the ingredients. The chestnut tortellini with celery root Brie and a red wine pear purée is delicious. There risotto with Confiet egg yolk and aged parmesan. is delicious as well. Generally I am not a big fan of duck. But Boulud seared duck breast is fantastic. For desert my waitress recommended the Chocolate entremet hazelnut with poached pears and a hazelnut ice cream. Cafe Boulud has a fantastic wine list. Some of the wines and scotches are very difficult to find. I first started coming to bar Pleiades a few years ago with friends and my EX girlfriend. The bar is extremely private and normally is very quiet. The drinks are normally $25-$30 a drink. They have a fantastic selection of single malts. On certain nights there is live jazz playing. Last time I was here I had 2 scotches and it was $106. By having the drinks this expensive this weeds out the crowd. But it's a great place to grab a drink. There is a great bar and the lounges are very nice and candle lit in the evening and night.Overall café Boulud is still one of my favorite restaurants on the UES. If you are a fan of Daniel or French cuisine. I highly recommend you stop by also check out bar pleidies across the hall.PROS:- one of my fav places on the east side - staff is 110% fantastic,9,3,3,Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",540,547,2523
5.0,12/15/2015,"Our boss took us here for our team party and it was absolutely delicious. We shared several appetizers and cocktails, I had a Last Caress (Chartreuse Snow, Juniper Berries &Champagne). For my entree, I had perfectly prepared Poulet aux Chataîgnes and for dessert, the Caramelia (""blackout"" biscuit, pecan bavarois, caramel popcorn with dark chocolate ice cream). As you can imagine, it was as wonderful as it sounds. I felt the service was good, not as great as you'd expect for this type of restaurant, but the place is beautiful and the ambiance is lovely.

With that said, of the past 5 years I've lived in New York, this has been by far my favorite tasting restaurant. Initially the patrons do seem to mind their own business... there was only one couple I felt who made eyes... as in they were seeking approval or being judges themseleves. That's a little unfortunate... but I didn't go to the restaurant seeking acceptance.I came for a the great reviews... and though there were 3 reviews by a recent group of diners, I didn't feel put off at all by my sexuality. The food looked appeasing. The decor was also so clean and pretty. The hosts and service were professional and friendly. Again, the food was just amazing. Good size portions for salads... the steak was superb... and the chocolate dessert was delicious. When I make it... I'll definitely visit this restaurant again.

2.0,12/13/2015,"I'm writing this review a bit late, but hey I guess I'm a bit late to Yelp. My family and I came here in late 2013 to celebrate my sisters graduation from NYU. Just a day before my graduation from the Culinary Institute of America. I was legitimately so f***ing excited to go here! The food was good. Overpriced for sure, but good. The service was awkward from the get-go, they weren't sure about our table despite our reservation. The servers gave both drinks and food to the wrong people at our table and we had to swap them across the table which I normally don't mind, if I'm at a diner, but not when we're paying close to $100 per person at a Michelin star restaurant. They also charged multiple wrong items to our bill. If the prices were cut in half and the service was good I would give this place 5 stars because the food is quite good, but a Michelin star?

All of that being said, be prepared for the bill.  For a party of 12, including a few lower end bottles of wine, the bill was $2500!  Certainly large bills are the norm when doing business, but that was still a bit higher than I expected.

1.0,12/6/2015,"We went for breakfast, it was just ok. Nothing close to what you'd expect from a Michelin restaurant. The manager seemed to take issue with our appearance, and tucked us into some weird table in the back. The rude hostess literally dropped our menus on the table and walked away without as much as a sound or acknowledgment of any kind. Our food was delivered without any explanation of what some of the accoutrements were. We asked 3 different people to explain, none of which spoke English. Finally a nice server (not ours) came but to describe what was served. We had reservations for the evening as well, since we were staying in the attached Surrey Hotel. We almost canceled due to the rudeness and lack of attention to detail at such a ""premium"" restaurant. However, we concluded dinner would certainly be a much better experience, so we kept our reservation. While checking in for our dinner reservation, we were greeted with the most condescending glances by the same general manager as in the morning. Then with utter arrogance, and a patronizing tone, says"" I'll get you guys a jacket"".  Just for the record: the 3 of us in our late 20s early 30s, were dressed sharply. One in a black cashmere sweater, one in grey and one in a black shirt and jacket. I informed him I would NOT be wearing any jacket he provided, and we had one in our room, since we were staying in the Hotel. In an equally snide manner, he relied, ""I know, I saw you this morning"". We explained had there been a ""jacket required"" dress code on their website we would have happily adhered. He admitted there was no such policy but ""they  preferred to maintain a certain aesthetic"". This all while spotting several men dining WITHOUT jackets feet away from us.  We asked the concierge if a jacket was required and we were explicitly told no. Apparently this man thinks this restaurant is a nightclub and can turn people away based on looks and his personal preference. That, or he took issue with our sexual orientation. We travel frequently and visit Michelin restaurants often. We do our due diligence to ensure we're properly dressed in the RARE event there is a posted dress code.  This experience was the most blatant and disgusting display of discrimination I have ever encountered at an establishment of such acclaim. I assure you, this place is not worth it.  And until I receive a written apology, I will never step food in a Boulud restaurant again and will advise my friends to do the same.",17,3,2,Tyler B.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,112,154
1.0,12/6/2015,"I would like to echo the sentiment of my friend below. This place gets a zero star. The manager, Mr. Cherif Mbodji, needs some sensitivity training and learn how to address people with a modicum of human dignity and respect. My friends were visiting from LA, and I encouraged them to stay at The Surrey Hotel, which is nearby my apartment in the Upper East Side. We were looking forward to eating dinner at Cafe Boulud that night prior to going to New York City Ballet's The Nutcracker at the Lincoln Center. I was wearing a jacket and my friends were dressed in very nice dark Cashmere sweaters from none other than Saint Laurent - not that that matters, but the point is we were all nicely dressed.But the manager stopped us from entering the restaurant because he said he ""preferred"" guests to wear jackets. We were like ok, and my friends were going to their room to get jackets, which they had with them. But we decided to check on the Web site first and on Yelp to see if jackets were required or if there was a dress code. None whatsoever !!!We checked with the Concierge at Front Desk - no dress code or formal jacket required. And we also pointed out to the manager that there were several other guests already in the Restaurant that had no jackets on. At that point, it occurred to me - for the FIRST time, in my life, I felt what it was being discriminated against. I never had felt such a sentiment that is so demeaning to my personhood and gave me a sense of inferiority and undesired nature. In that sense, this has been a learning experience as it had made me feel more empathetic toward those who feel discriminated against for their color, nationality, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation.Could it be possible that we were actually discriminated against because we were three gay men - right here in New York City in the Upper East Side - my neighborhood? The coincidence would be odd because we were all nicely dressed and had an appointment, and there were no published dress code that required jackets. We were not allowed entry based on the arbitrary judgment of one person who did not like who we were or how we looked. This is shameful and abhorrent, and has really scarred me and my friends. It is deeply embarrassing that I invited my friends to come to this place - my home - and for this to happen here.This is the book definition of discrimination and meets the statutory definition - I can say so because I am an attorney myself. This man has used his personal judgment and decided to refuse entry in an establishment bad on his personal aesthetics and preferences. There was no dress code or policy that was published in regards to jackets being required. That requirement was not published at the site of the restaurant. That requirement was not published on the Web site of the restaurant. That requirement was not published on Yelp. And the Concierge said that Jackets were not required as well. All this means is that it is left to the discretion and the arbitrary judgment of one person - Mr. Cherif Mbodji. He gets to decide like a bouncer who gets in or not at the restaurant.But not in my city - not in my neighborhood. This is shameful and need to never ever happen again. I would hate for anyone to ever experience this level of inferiority that is so demeaning to their personhood. All three of us deserve a written apology, and the Restaurant should train its personnel on sensitivity issues and not to discriminate based on sexual orientation. This is illegal in the City of New York under the Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act (SONDA). The Restaurant should publish its dress code requiring a jacket or not and not leave it to the arbitrary judgment of one person, who is able to discriminate based on his personal bias. What if he did not like Jews or Muslims, would those people not meet the aesthetic preferences of the manager? The Restaurant should also post publicly its non-discrimination policy at the site of the Restaurant and on its official Web site that it does not discriminate who to serve based on race, color, creed, age, national origin, alienage or citizenship status, gender (including gender identity and sexual harassment), sexual orientation, disability, or marital status.",13,2,2,Séhzad S.,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",70,35,10

It's an interesting way to do a menu and our waiter was very helpful at recommending complementary starters and entrees. I started with the lobster gnocchi, which was as rich and decadent as you'd expect, followed by the sea bass, which was transcendent: perfectly cooked atop a luscious puddle of pureed potatoes. My dinner companions had scallops, duck, chanterelle risotto and octopus. Everyone was very pleased and satisfied.

The jasmine panna cotta was mediocre at best.

Dessert was excellent (chocolate mousse and gelato/sorbet). The little Madeline cakes at the end were the best. Service was adequate. Overall I was pleased, as it was a bit cheaper than I expected (and less than other Michelin-starred restaurants that I've visited).

4.0,5/6/2015,"Very good food in an elegant, contemporary, hushed room just off the entry of the Surrey Hotel. I had an appetizer of a creamy pasta with razor clams and sea urchin and followed it up with the striped bass en paupiette. Both had nice flavor balance and the presentation of the bass was particularly nice, on a bed of mashed potatoes with an outer ring of red wine/vegetable reduction. It looked sort of like a delicious bullseye with the fish as the center. From what I saw and got to sample, I would stick to the La Saison and La Tradition menus. Le Potager and Le Voyage are the others--farmer's market items in the former and world cuisine (Vietnamese on our visit) in the latter.The energy in the room was a little low early on a Friday (our reservation was right at opening).

Perhaps the tables are too close. I went on a Sunday at 6:30 and every tabke was full.

4.0,5/3/2015,"Vegetarian Dinner Review April 2015What a special meal. Service was formal, prompt and officious. The waitstaff were very knowledgable about the food. Decor was tasteful but wish the dining room was bigger with some cozy niches or an outdoor space as an alternative, as it was, you don't get an intimate, private dining experience. The dinner menu charges daily (I believe), so you won't find it on their website. You get three appetizers to choose from and three entrees. I was happy that in each category, there was a vegetarian option. Tonight, it was a salad and a zucchini risotto. I told the waiter I had salad for lunch and he offered the shrimp soup without shrimp for me, assuring me it was a vegetarian stock. He also offered a ravioli dish as an entree alternative but I stuck with the risotto. The soup was amazing. So green and fresh, almost tasted like a warm Swiss chard purée. Loved the bits of fresh micro greens and corn at the bottom for texture. The risotto was perfect if fairly traditional. My fellow diners who are carnivores were oohing and aahing over their dishes and I have to say that the crispy pork belly served with bone marrow, mushrooms and green herbs made me wish I still ate meat. Portions are perfectly sized not to make you too full. We were there for a bday party and the bday girl had a bday greeting printed on her menu and got a nice, tasteful personal chocolate lava cake without the Chili's-like fanfare of waiters singing to her which I appreciated. I mention that for all those who prefer not to tell restaurants its their special day because they hate being singled out like me. Speaking of dessert, make sure you save room. They are amazing, original and so elegant. I loved my raspberries on a peanut brittle torte served with caramel crumble and home made peanut ice cream and chocolate leaf. I prefer this restaurant to the Chef's other, more well known restaurant, Daniel which serves more traditionally French fare and has a more stuffy feel. I would return to Cafe Boulud again for all my special occasions. Cheers to everyone at this restaurant who took the time to make it a meal to remember.",0,0,0,Pun B.,"Manhattan, NY",107,87,46

It probably is a little on the stuffy side but it was great for having a conversation and actually being able to hear the other person!And while the cocktail menu looked great, we opted to split a bottle of wine. The wine menu is extensive and the sommelier knowledgable - but I actually thought our waitress was more helpful in recommending a bottle for our meal.We split the foie gras appetizer and I got to try both the duck and lamb entrees.

2.0,2/27/2015,"What started off as a 5 star experience spiraled downward to 2/2.5 at best.  Came here for dinner and sat for over 3 hours, the majority of which did not involve food on our plates.  The service was so painfully slow.  From the time they took our orders (20 minutes after we put down our menus), to the preparation (entrees did not show up until 1.5 hours into our meal, to the dessert (now we're well in 2 hours).  The maitre d seemed quite embarrassed after coming over to apologize for the second time, but did little to alter the pace of the meal.  He did offer a glass of complimentary wine, which did little for me being 6 months pregnant.  While there's something to be said for a 3 hour tasting meal at a place like Per Se, this was not a experience I cam to Cafe Boulud for.  As for the food, what did eventually arrive was well prepared and tasted good.  But not enough to make up for all the delays.  Don't waste your time or money here - there's better options even on the UES, say the Mark, Crown or Morini.  Even Daniel might be faster in comparison!",0,0,0,Lin N.,"New York, NY",42,45,0

Excellent service, perfect chill to our drinks. As if it were almost orchestrated, we were beckoned to our table with about a third of our cocktail remaining. The main dining room is formal but not pretentious, beautifully lit and decorated (with red carnations and large red floral arrangements through to commemorate the day). There was a price fixe menu for the occasion, and each of the three dishes was spot on. In particular, if the Chateaubriand is on the daily menu, I highly recommend it... superb, tender, melt in your mouth quality. And desserts were to absolutely die for. We also did a wine pairing, and each of the four wines brought to our table were truly well matched to the cuisine.Come with a large credit line on your card, but come knowing you'll have a superb dining experience in every way.

It gets really crowded and the table next to us was barely separated from our table and we could hear every single word of their conversation!

5.0,1/26/2015,"Came here last Saturday for dinner after spending the day at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I was impressed with both the food and the service at Cafe Boulud and would even say it is my favorite restaurant (for now)! The amuse-bouche (some kind of croquette as I recall) was quite flavorful. I had yellowtail crudo for appetizer - very delicate and refreshing. For entree I had beef Wellington. A traditional dish executed to perfection! The generous portion of foie gras on top of the beef was also cooked beautifully and made the dish more interesting. I even enjoyed the cauliflower on the side (and I normally hate cauliflower)! For desert I had thyme creme brulee and it had very nice texture - not too dense or too thin. The flavor was, again, quite delicate and refreshing.  What made Cafe Boulud my favorite restaurant was its service. The staff was very knowledgeable and took time to explain the food and answer questions. Here comes the highlight of the dinner - one of the wait staff saw me taking food pictures with my iPhone and asked me if I would be interested in taking pictures with their Executive Chef Aaron Bludorn. I said yes but didn't expect it to happen (after all, it was 7 pm on a Saturday and the restaurant was packed). Two minutes later, Chef Aaron came to my table to say 'hi'! We even chatted a little afterwards. This is the first time I had the opportunity to meet with the chef at a Micheline-starred restaurant (and I've been to quite a few) and it was a pleasant surprise!

I had absolutely no complaints for cafe Boulud, and have deemed it as the best restaurant I have ever been to.

We expected traffic, but had none. We thought we'd go to the bar until our 8 p.m. reservation and the hostess said she'd come get us. Just after checking our coats, she tapped my shoulder and said she had a table open and would we like to see if it met our satisfaction? It did and we were seated immediately. The sommelier appeared immediately with the wine list and answered all of our questions and then allowed us to think a  bit. We selected a wonderful white that was so delicious we're trying to find it in our local stores. We each had the winter roasted vegetable salad, a special that night, to start. I had the slow-roasted branzino and my husband had the roast chicken. We both loved our meals. Portions were just right, and everything was seasoned exactly right. We ordered pistachio ice cream and Concord grape sorbet for dessert, both of which were divine. Because it was my b-day, the chef sent out a miniature plate of mini-sweets which were lovely. The room was busy as it was Saturday night, but the service was spot-on. Attentive, friendly, but reserved and elegant. And never over-bearing. We never felt pressured to leave, but finally did.

5.0,12/22/2014,"I love this place. Weekend brunches were always Cafe Boulud or Orsay. I used to live 1 block from the front door, so I spent many a lunch here nursing mild (or moderate) hangovers with glasses of Rosé at one of the beautiful outdoor tables (or a clear headed brunch still sipping Rosé) and enjoying some really satisfying French cuisine. The foie gras here is so good I just eat it with a fork, no bread involved. The menu changed throughout the year, but I consistently stuck with the ham benedict or the seasonal duck or chicken entree. I once strayed and tried a beef tenderloin entree, and it was just as wonderful as the duck and chicken dishes. I have always wanted to try the beef wellington here, but this is just such a great Sunday brunch/weekend lunch place for me, I have never crossed over to dinner. It's probably better I now live a good 15 blocks away because all of our weekend trips here added up....brunch/lunch with a few rounds of drinks always ended up being well over $250 after taxes and gratuity were calculated.

5.0,11/19/2014,"**Dinner tasting menu review, FALL 2014*I had a friend come into town and of course, he wanted to try a Daniel Boulud restaurant.  With only a couple days ahead of time, we were able to secure a spot for two at Cafe Boulud, thankfully, at 9:30pm.  At 9:30pm, this place is still very bustling!  Our table had a 45+ min delay which was one of the few downsides, so we hung out at Bar Pleiades next door.We were seated side by side by the wall, allowing us to people watch while we ate our dinner.  We were probably the youngest people there.  Decor of the restaurant is lovely, but I will say that towards the end of the night, the very powerful heater kicked on and I was literally sweating just sitting still because it was so hot and uncomfortable.  Not enjoyable at all, but by that point at least we were ready to leave.We did the $125/pp tasting menu with a few drinks in between as recommended by the waiter.  Best decision ever.  I LOVED the fact that instead of bringing us both the same dishes every course, we each got a different one.  Essentially, a 7 course tasting menu turned into 10+ and I was beyond ecstatic.  I'm not sure if this is always the case, so I would check with the waiter first.I'm not going to go into detail about each dish, but they were all tasteful and well worth the price, especially since you basically get to taste the menu if you go as two.  Notables:- Olive bread - you get to choose out of multple kinds on tray, but the olive bread is for sure the tastiest.- Amuse bouche - everything was delicious - chef's choice of 3- NZ Venison - never had anything like this before and the oats/seasoning on this is just absolutely amazing- Chestnut veloute - oh my god.- Dessert - all of it.Service was of course amazing and the waiter made sure to explain each and every dish we got and even stuck around to chit chat when we had questions about the food or wine.  Staff is quite knowledgable on the dishes and drinks.If I return to Cafe Boulud and do a la carte, my go-tos would be the foie gras, chestnut veloute, vension, and Marrakesh delight (seasonal dessert, but the thyme creme brulee was good as well).",17,7,14,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2170,1311,3573

3.0,10/13/2014,"Went during Restaurant Week to be a bit disappointed with the meals. The beginning and the end was enchanting but the middle was very, very hazy. I expected more from this restaurant. Appetizer (Shrimp Ceviche) really made me expect a lot of things. It was just an exceptional dish... I wish I had this as an entree instead. Entree (9 herb ravioli) ended up being a complete disappointment. Really salty actually and I thought that the foam wasn't necessary.Dessert (Fruity...... totally forgot what it was called) it wasn't horrible but it wasn't OMG THIS IS SO FREAKING GOOD either. Meh. Madeleine = ORGASM. I shamelessy asked for another batch and they did not deny me heaven! :) Staff was definitely nice, and the atmosphere was great.

4.0,9/23/2014,"The restaurant is fairly quiet for a Saturday lunch, and the crowd veered towards the older residents of the city.Food:The menu is split up into four different sections representing different flavors / feelings, which was kind of nice.We got complimentary fried risotto balls (Arancini), which was a nice crispy/crunch start to the meal.Our iced Arnold Palmer's came back totally iced tea and no lemonade, so we had to send it back to be re-done (which I think they just poured out some tea and added lemonade to)Appetizers: Maine Peekytoe Crab and Painted Hills Beef Tartare. I would like to say the crab was not very mindblowing, but the presentation was nice (they added sauce to it in front of you) with a ton of colors. The tartar, on the other hand, was awesome...there was plenty of flavor and texture incorporated into this dish, and they were definitely not skimpy on the proportions.Entrees: Long Island Duck Breast and Grilled Colorado Lamb Loin. Each dish comes in a pretty ""messy"" presentation (i.e. not very simple, but rather complicated and full of different things). It was kind of entertaining looking at the dishes because of all the stuff on one plate, haha. The duck was made crisp, tender, and moist while slightly pinkish/rare. I usually have my duck well done (in most asian dishes), but I enjoyed it being less fully cooked as well. Personally, I was not a huge huge fan of the lamb loin, but the empanada was pretty crispy.Dessert: Raspberry Vacherin and Passion Fruit Flan. Personally not a fan of the raspberry vacherin -- it wasn't very impressive. However, did love the tangy flavor of the passion fruit flan. I would definitely say the desserts had cuter/prettier presentation haha.Nearby suggestions: after this, we stopped by my favorite NYC gelato place, Sant Ambroeus (literally 1-2 blocks away). Then off to Laduree (which I still do not like due to how overly sweet it is -- I opt for my homemade macarons, thanks). After that was the cupcake ATM at sprinkles (just for the novelty of it -- the cupcake itself is a bit too sweet). Our final stop of the gastro-omnomnom-day ended up being at Alice's Tea Cup for afternoon tea, scones, and heart-attack s'mores dessert (which was ok).

5.0,9/4/2014,"I got to catch Gavin Kaysen right before his departure to his hometown and new restaurant Merchant. Lunch during midweek is busy with locals and tourists alike. One of the things that kept me entertained was to here this group of Koreans that spoke Spanish the whole time. turns out they are from Paraguay. It added to the interesting ambiance and flavor that Cafe Boulud provides. I was sat at the far wall by the kitchen with a great view of the whole dining room, plus the service stations nearby, offering a way to observe service from both sides of the equation. Many of my acquaintances from the Dinex group almost all came from this establishment so it was interesting to finally see where they passed through. My captain who took great care of me once worked for a friend of mine. Small small world. On his recommendation I got:Aged Parmesan Raviolibroccoli rabe, herb breadcrumbsroasted tomato sauceBanana Leaf Wrapped Halibutroasted poblano peppers, yucca cakescallions, black eyed peasChocolate Napoléonsour cherry, nougatpistachio ice creamPassion Fruit Flanmint marinated mango, lime crémeuxpassion fruit-mango sorbetEverything was delicious and crazy filling. I had to go walk off the meal in Central Park nearby or I would have probably exploded on my flight to Europe shortly after. Not only did they send out the desserts, they added a ton of macarons and other treats for the mignairdises. Talk about excess! The service as you would expect is top notch but I think having a lot of folks in common helped out too. Got a quick tour of the kitchen and Chef Kaysen described the old layout when it was still Restaurant Daniel. A little fact: Chef Kaysen competed in the Bocuse D'or with Brandon Rodgers who is one of my favorite chefs at Benu in San Francisco. The world is small indeed. Im sure Chef Aaron is well into taking over the reigns now and a return trip is order to see how they've evolved",2,1,2,Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",3020,9832,66435

And they have some outdoor seating as well.For the first course I chose the ceviche and my bf had a summer soup. I forgot what kind of beans it was made from exactly but the cold preparation was lovely and very good. For the entree he had the hanger steak and I had skate. We both preferred my dish for this round as the combination of flavors were delightful while the steak just felt average. The dessert course was the best of all and we enjoyed both the mocha torte and the passion fruit semifreddo. Over all the food was quite good. However the service left much to be desired coming from a top-tier restaurant. The staff was borderline unfriendly and not as attentive as they should be. Perhaps it's the RW influence but I've always felt that the quality of a high-end restaurant can be judged not just by the good but also by how well they treat their clientele.

4.0,8/25/2014,"Saturday pre-fixe lunch at Cafe Boulud is a special treat at a reasonable price.  I ordered the 3 course pre-fixe and chose the artichoke/hearts of palm salad with lemon vinaigrette to start. It was divine. Perfectly dressed, light and tasty. The fried artichokes on top added a nice crunch and overall the flavors just blended perfectly together. Next I had the roast chicken and it was also very good. The meat was tender and juicy and the skin was full of flavor and just slightly crispy. All of the accompaniments (carrots, yellow squash, potatoes) were delicious and colorful too, except I did not care for the curry flavor that some of the carrots were cooked in. My boyfriend ordered the 2 course pre-fixe and he had the smoked trout as an appetizer (delicious!) and the roasted fish entree. The fish was good but we both liked the chicken better. For dessert, we had the raspberry beignet and the chocolate molten lava cake (which was a la carte and not part of the pre-fixe).  The chocolate cake is definitely the way to go and is totally worth the few extra dollars.

I've made salmon with a lemon butter sauce (literally, that's it, just lemon and butter) that tasted just as good. For desert I had some artistic chocolate thing. It was very pretty, but didn't taste nearly as good. I'm not sure. This was a while ago. It was so unmemorable that I can't recall the exact dishes.

We received a complimentary amuse-bouche from the kitchen, our server didn't look happy and mumble about the amuse-bouche as if he didn't want to serve us or he was in a cranky mood.  But I wasn't in a cranky mood and was eager to get started on my meal.My 3 courses were Shrimp Ceviche, Pan seared hanger steak, and Passion Fruit Semifreddo.  Shrimp Ceviche - very refreshing, got my palate excited for my next course, thumbs up!  Order it!  Mango and sourness from lime juice will make your mouth watering.Pan seared hanger steak - now .. this was a HUGE let down.  There was very little seasoning to the steak.  I had much better steak from lower caliber restaurants.  There was nothing creative about this dish, except Pommes dauphinoise.  That was the most tastiest thing on the plate.  I actually blamed myself at first for ordering hanger steak medium-well.  It definitely was on a tougher side.  I should've gotten a medium particularly for hanger steak.  So I'm not blaming a restaurant for that.  2 other colleagues of mine also ordered hanger steak and they both agreed that flavor was really lacking.  But both of their steaks were tender and juicy.  I regretted for not ordering Ravioli or Skate Wing instead.Passion Fruit Semifreddo - that was good.  Slightly on sour side, but refreshing.  My friend had Buttermilk Panna Cotta, that was pretty good as well; soft, light, and creamy.Great thing about service was .. food came out promptly.  I was worried that it would be a very very long lunch.  So I was happy with the kitchen service.  Overall, Cafe Boulud left me wanting for more.  I'm just not sure when I'll make my way back here again.",1,0,0,Kim S.,"Stamford, CT",206,235,454

Shrimp ceviche was truly an appetizer in that I was very appetized (lolol) couldn't really taste the mango here but the guac was nice and tart. A refreshing cold dish!Herb ravioli with a foamy sauce. Wow very delicious ravioli. I'm used to really heavy creamy meaty ones but as a vegetation entree option it was extremely tasty. That orange purée on the bottom... Amazing whatever it was. I pretty much licked my plate here. Unfortunately it was an extremely small portion size :( The hanger steak was good... extremely well put together with a little side of potato and lightly dressed side vegs (no clue what they were but tasty none the less). You probably would be more full if you picked the steak option. The favorite part of the meal was hands down dessert. I had the passion fruit dessert with lychee and raspberry and  freeze dried orange garnish. The explosion of flavor!! Totally up my alley as I enjoy sour things a lot. So fruity and refreshing, perfect for summer and everything went so well together! Also there were two complimentary plates: a taste of their risotto balls (DELICIOUS I WANTED MORE!) and Madeline's, which were also lightly and had a slight lemony taste... Also Delicious. I would think as a French restaurant the bread would be amazing but it wasn't. Actually I am not so sure what was French about my meal anyhow...The restaurant itself is fairly small and not anything outstanding inside (nice bathroom tho!), and service... Varied.

I had high hopes, yet realistic expectations. The Bad:The amuse-bouche risotto balls were not terribly amusing.Our waiter was regretfully not at the top of his game. His description of the tomato panisse did not at all reflect what actually came out the kitchen. He seemed to be confusing himself. Who knew that when he said it was a tomato puree (with a refreshing creme fraiche), he actually meant that it would be served as a deep- fried tomato stick?  Ick, pass! I ordered the butter poached lobster. This was the highlight of  a so-so meal. Please: although there was a sublime portion of poached lobster, there is also a deep fried batter-swathed portion as well? One of  the many American twists ""Chef"" aparently likes to impart to traditional french cuisine. If you're going to twist up my meal Southern Style, PLEASE inform me of this in the description.  Two instances of unexpected deep fried foods, left a bad taste in my mouth.  My boyfriend ordered the short ribs. Those were pretty tasty (my taste buds were eager to experience any type of deliciousness)I kept a smile plastered onto my face the entire night, for my boyfriend's sake, but was soooo sad inside. Soooo much could have been soooo much better, but fell terribly short.The Good: The foie gras terrine was better than okay, just not great. I've had much better.The wine was nice (and much needed) Though we ordered a bottle of wine, our waiter kept charging us by the glass. That was rectified once the check came.    The Huh? :The chocolate ganache was an unfortunate mish mash. The slab of granite (not the smooth kind, mind you) on which the ganache was served was an unfortunate choice of dessert plates.

With that being said, everything was delicious but a few things stood out more than others. The veloute was a very creamy soup that tasted similar to spinach artichoke dip, nothing too special. The salad was .. well.. salad. It was fresh and well-dressed but I try to avoid plain salads at fancy french restaurants. The fluke crudo was very fresh and lightly dressed with fragrant oils. It was definitely my favorite out of three. All three people I was with got Arctic char as their main course and were very pleased with it. I did not do the pre-fix and instead ordered the banana leaf wrapped halibut and it was quite delicious. The fish was tender but still had a meaty/steak-like quality. It had a tropical (mango maybe) glaze and was served with black eyed peas and delicious yuca patty, or as my grandmother called it, a latke.When it came time for dessert I ordered poached apricots. We also ordered the chocolate Napoleon and one person had the hazelnut cake from the pre-fix. I think the a la carte dessert were significantly more beautiful than the hazelnut, but to be fair, they were all outstanding. I would even come back here just for cappuccinos and sweets. At $14 a pop they are pricey, but so worth it. My apricots came with a fluffy marshmallow, sorbet, and other nuggets of goodness. The chocolate Napoleon was dense with pistachio ice cream and sour cherries. It had a great tanginess, which is rare for a cocoa dessert. We also had a bottle of rose wine ($50) and the bill came out to $85 a person. That is definitely expensive for a lunch, but keep in mind this is the UES. If you stick to the pre-fix, you can get out of here for under $50 per person! The service was impeccable. I love waiter bread service and this was the epitome of class. Thick circular slices of Plugra butter served alongside hearty fresh slices or butter rolls. You can taste the difference. In short- go here!

5.0,6/3/2014,"Had dinner last night at Cafe Boulud. We had 7pm reservations on a Monday evening and were seated at around 7:05. Cafe Boulud could best be classified as a neighborhood upper East side restaurant whose clientele are mostly the ""retired rich and famous"".  No texting or selfies here. Just cellphone pics of grandchildren and great grandchildren. In terms of presentation of the food, this restaurant is old school top of the line French. But the French nouvelle cuisine is created by a truly imaginative chef and the entire experience is impeccable making this a special occasion place as well. The menu is created in a way where appetizers are at the top and entrees are at the bottom grouped into ""classifications"" and you can mix and match.  The appetizer of Parsley Tagliatelle with razor clams, musselscaramelized fennel, and black pepper was exceptional. My entree was one of the daily specials, a veal tenderloin that was amazing. Dessert was Poached Apricot withtoasted almond mousse, pain degenes basil, and apricot sorbet. Despite the fact that the average age of the diners here at least on Monday evening might be 70, the room was full of electric energy and zest that I hadn't encountered in years.  The dress code is business casual and prices are actually reasonable given the level of the dining experience. I only wish the younger crowd would take a break from those trendy ""in"" spots and dine here to experience the definition of ""fine dining"".

5.0,5/28/2014,Dinner on Saturday May 24 was our first experience in one of Chef Boulud's restaurants. Have tried to get into Daniel unsuccessfully on many occasions so we opted for the Cafe and were not disappointed. Service was attentive and the lead Elena was very well informed about the menu and the wine list. The menu is divided into four concepts with additional daily specials. First courses were an amazing beef tartare and a melt in your mouth Terrine of Fois Gras. Mains were a lovely Risotto dish and Bacon wrapped pork loin. Both excellent. The dessert list was beautiful. We enjoyed a lovely Blueberry Crisp and the Dulce de Leche. Both amazing. The wine list is extensive and pricey. A little difficult to find my $200 value but we managed with an awesome Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir. Great date night in New York and an added bonus we found street parking two blocks away thanks to it being a holiday weekend. Definitely a lovely experience!,1,0,0,John G.,"Baton Rouge, LA",9,47,41

For starters I had the best beef tartar I've ever eaten and my husband raved about the foie gras. The duck breast i ordered for entree was so tender and the ribeye steak that my partner ordered was perfectly cooked. The rhubarb tart and passionfruit flat desserts were beautifully presented and tasted amazing. We ordered the chocolate mousse cake as a wedding cake - it was fantastic however we were so full from the hors d'oeuvres and 3 course meal  that we really didn't need it!The service was as you'd expect for a restaurant of this quality.

We went for Mother's Day and arrived 10 minutes early for our reservation and were asked to wait in the hotel lobby where we were forgotten. Once we say down before even taking our drink order our extremely preoccupied waiter told us we would have to hurry because the kitchen was closing. We had a 3pm res. and at 3:15 we were essentially told to hurry it up. And he addressed this to my mother on Mother's Day in such a rude manner it ruined the rest of the experience. He then forgot a drink order and a other small simple requests...lemons for water, new napkin etc. when pouring the wine/water/cofee he was in such a rush that he spilled every single time.  The food, was well...disappointing. We were all very excited for the meal and everything lacked flavor and originality ( and temperature!) my beef tartare was ok. My seared duck Breast was nearly closer to rare than medium.

I made a reservation on Yelp and we got there about 5 mins before our reservation.The friendly hostess seated us almost immediately. The gentleman who waited on us was probably on of my favorite waiters of all time. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and was very friendly, warm and forthcoming. My wife and I both felt that he really did a great job.We first ordered our drinks while we looked over the menu. The menu is simple and well laid out. We decided to get the appetizer portion of the Garlic Gnocchi to start, along with some Broccoli Rabe. The Gnocchi was REALLY delicious! The Broccoli was a bit salty for my wife's taste but I really liked it.For my main course, I ordered the Lamb Loin. It was cooked  and seasoned perfectly! It is hard to explain just how succulent and tasty it was! My wife ordered the chicken and as per custom, I ate half of it! :)  The chicken too, was very well prepared.We got the pear cake dessert to share. That too, was very good.

My husband got the citrus tart, which he let me try, and it was really good. And then we got the complimentary madeleines after that too. And I ate them all.

4.0,3/2/2014,"It's with a small amount of embarrassment that I admit the fact that it took me over a year to finally visit a Daniel Boulud restaurant. It was by no means intentional; I had long heard of his mini-empire in NYC, but the plethora of other options always delayed the initial visit. Nonetheless, when a few friends and I needed a place to hold a farewell brunch, we came to an immediate consensus on Cafe Boulud.We arrived on a rainy weekend afternoon at the time of our reservation. After getting our coats and umbrellas checked in, we were shown to our seats and promptly given the requisite menus and glasses of water. Cafe Boulud's brunch menu is a little unique in that it gives diners the choice to choose either a two-course or the full three-course brunch prix fixe, which covers a starter, a main, and a dessert. The two-course can include any combination of the three, which offers a good deal of flexibility for diners. As none of the appetizers looked particularly attractive to me, I decided to order a main and a dessert.I was slightly thrown off at the presentation of the bread which came in the form of a mini baguette, accompanied by a block of butter. Although I would have preferred it served warm and pre-sliced, it was nice to have it while my friends began on their starters. In due time, my Maine Peekytoe Crab Benedict arrived and I was delighted with one of most creative interpretations of the classic egg benedict that I've yet to encounter. A generous serving of crab cake was served on top of a bed of wilted spinach and topped off with a poached egg and a bright sauce choron. The pairing of ingredients was spot on and the preparation of each element was close to flawless as well. The crab cake had just the right amount of breading and crunch, the hint of tomato in the sauce choron was well balanced, and the egg perfectly poached.Dessert was quite the event as the happenstance of four girls and four dessert options led to an obvious decision; we were presented with a molten chocolate cake, a slice of lemon tart, a dark chocolate mousse, and mango financier. My friends immediately went after the two chocolate plates, and understandably so; the chocolate was rich, not overly sweet, and smartly paired with a vanilla ice cream and an earl grey ice cream. The financier was also satisfactory; a warm  pastry topped off with coconut ganache, and served with a meringue yogurt sorbet. My favorite, though, had to be the lemon tart - bright, acidic, and with a delightfully light meringue, it was the perfect spring dessert. In what seemed to be a matter of minutes, all of our plates were cleared.It, perhaps, goes without saying that service was exemplary; from the knowledgeable recommendations our server made, to the timing and transition between dishes, we were ensured a wonderful dining experience. It's not simple coincidence that Cafe Boulud has maintained a Michelin star in the most recent year; a pleasant dining ambiance, delicious food, and a high standard in service make it one of the stand-outs in New York City's innumerable restaurants.",9,5,7,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
3.0,2/24/2014,"** Restaurant Week 2014 Review ** Their RW menu includes 3 options for appetizers, entrees and dessert - this is pretty standard for most RW menus. After we ordered, we were presented with the Amuse-bouche of truffle risotto balls, which were served hot and crunchy.I opted for the Duck Terrine, which was served with whole grain mustard, pickled vegetables and toasted sourdough bread. The terrine was very good - it was quite smooth and not too salty at all. I wished there was more sourdough to go with it though.The Boyfriend opted for the Escarole Salad, which contained grilled red onions, sunflower seeds, shaved sunchokes tossed in a parmesan vinaigrette. We both thoroughly enjoyed this salad. We don't often rave about salads because it is a pretty standard appetizer but this one was very fresh and light.For my entree, I went with the Pan Seared Trout, which is served with winter bean fricassee, black olives and lemon zest. I loved it! The trout was seared to a perfect color - just a tad pink on the inside. The skin was crispy while the inside was soft and melted in my mouth. I'm usually not a big fan of beans, but the fricassee was pretty good.And finally, it's time for my favorite part of any meal - the dessert! I opted for the Citrus Tart, which is served with blood orange sorbet. I loved it! The combination of the tartness from the citrus was cut by the sweetness of the blood orange sorbet. Together, it was a little bit sour and a little bit sweet in each bite.The Boyfriend went with the Red Velvet Gateaux, which was gorgeous to behold. The piece of cake was served with toasted almond ice cream, which helped to temper the sweetness of the red velvet. I liked that they didn't use cream cheese like in all other red velvet cakes I've had - this one was light and delicious.Halfway through our dessert, we were presented with a complimentary small basket of Madeleines, which were served nice and toasty. I  loved them! Service was prompt and we never sat too long with empty dishes. I do wish that the service wasn't as prompt because we ended up feeling a bit rushed throughout our meal. The food was very good, but I do wish we had more time to enjoy it and the atmosphere. For RW, I think it's definitely worth the visit.

Our friends are used to sitting at their regular table and were disappointed that a larger party was seated in their usual spot. To me, our banquette against the wall was absolutely perfect and provided a nice view of the dining room while minimizing the traffic from servers in the restaurant. The Manager, Jan, made us feel very special throughout the evening and for the most, CafeBoulud delivered. We enjoyed a couple of bottles of a 2005 French Cabernet and it was yummy, albeit not the cheapest bottle on the expansive and (as expected) expensive wine list. Appetizers were exceptional. The kale salad was delicious. I had the cabbage wrapped monkfish which was cooked to perfection, but lacked the punch and presentation I was expecting from the well known superstar chef who was a Food Network Chopped champion.  The bok choy side was sensational as were the desserts. It happened to be my birthday so the candle in the rice pudding dessert was a nice touch. And it tasted good too. The one area worth commenting on was the inconsistent service throughout the meal. Several times the servers confused which plate went to which one of us at the table. And oddly enough a server brought full coffee service to our table between the appetizer and entree courses! It obviously belonged to a different table. I usually don't criticize service, but a restaurant of this caliber should have flawless service. Still, a very enjoyable meal.

3.0,12/9/2013,"Staid, dependable, and dated both in clientele and menu, Cafe Boulud is a pretty mediocre restaurant by a world-class chef that has undoubtedly seen better days. I am aware of this restaurant's Michelin star as well as Chef Boulud's quite notable achievements (especially with Daniel and DBGB). However, those two restaurants get me to my point: Where DBGB is fun, has a SUPER nice staff, as well as a menu stocked with inventive food; and where Daniel stands proudly as one of NYC's finest restaurants, Cafe Boulud is decidedly neither. The deep-fried amuse-bouche here is worth the trip but that is pretty much where the positivity ends. Tired fish dishes, half-hearted takes on authentic Korean cuisine, and stuffy desserts that seem like they are straight out of 1999 abound. You intrepid diners who are reading this and have eaten here in the past, I ask you, do you not agree that this restaurant has one of the most strangely confusing and ill-plotted menus in the city?Anyway, Daniel is a masterpiece and you can tell that Chef Boulud is spending some serious time in the kitchen there. DBGB is awesome; always really fun and full of pretty amazing food (I had a squash soup there that might be the best I have ever had) but Cafe Boulud is tired and really overrated. I don't even want to mention the staff because I don't want readers to think I was remotely swayed by anything but the food but Holy Moly are the hosts rude here. The bussing staff, however, are all really cool. Anyway, when I am here I often get the strangely muted House Smoked Salmon to start, the kind of so so tuna tartare if it is lunch and the Pan Seared Arctic Char if it is dinner. The Char comes with a mushroom reduction some diners might call subtle but I just call bland. Look, this is expensive food and if you are reading this you are about to eat in a city that has restaurants like NoMad, Mission Cantina, Spotted Pig, Minetta Tavern, heck even DBGB!

The other plus is we could make reservation via opentable.com, I love using it. If you haven't been using opentable.com yet, you should go create a account now, and the most important thing is, it's free.I started kind of excited this morning driving there for our brunch. Slowly the excitement was going away because after ~1.5 hours of driving (the fact that we were driving to Manhattan, plus crazy Veteran's Day traffic.  Apparently 1 hour wasn't even close to enough!) we were going to be late. I wasn't sure if we would lost our table because we were late, the fact that the restaurant is a michelin restaurant. Luckily, we didn't lose the table.After we drove there, i needed to drive around for another 10 minutes looking for parking. By that point, my mood was almost gone.The first step I stepped into the restaurant, we were welcomed by the staff and we were seated. The place was really peaceful and quite and really nice, it wasn't crowded at all, it was kind of a surprise and I was thinking it would be like other brunch places that's always crowed with a long line.The food was amazing.

I enjoyed the intimate dining setting as well.The meal started with an amuse bouche of arancini--it was my first time having the dish and I loved how delicate and tasty it was. I also loved how it was atop of a small bed of breadcrumbs. For the appetizer, we got the rock shrimp ceviche and tomato bisque.  The ceviche was light and fresh, and the tomato bisque was hearty and tasty.  For the main course, we got the Lamb with pearl couscous and the hake with pureed potato. Both were delicious, although I enjoyed the hake more. For dessert, we got blueberry mousse and passion fruit manjari mousse, complimentary macarons and jellies (for my boyfriend's birthday), complimentary madeleines (warm, fresh and oh so delicious with a hint of lemon).Overall, I really liked the food here.  Everything is well portioned, the dishes were delicious and well balanced, and the service and atmosphere was spot on.

5.0,9/24/2013,"Cafe Boulud is in the mid-range of Daniel Boulud's continuously growing empire. He has Daniel which is at the top end and competes with the likes of Per Se, etc. Cafe Boulud is on the elegant side without the fussiness and pretensions of the upper tier places. We have eaten at Restaurant Daniel 3 times, and here one time previously. All have been fabulous! We go to France every other year, and coming here makes us feel as if we are back in France!My husband and I had dinner here last Thursday night.The menu is organized into themes - traditional, seasonal, market and world. You can pick across all. Both of us really enjoyed our dinners.I had the Beau Soleil Oysters, New Brunswick. They were very fresh and perfect and a great starter. My hubby had the Grilled Octopus, artichokes, marcona almonds, Meyer's lemon, skordalia. Yummy!Our first courses were the Crispy duck breast, turnips, black eyed peas, arugula, natural jus for hubby. I got the Dry aged Beef Rossini, foie gras, fingerling potatoes, spinach puré, wild mushrooms, madeira jus.Everything was excellent and we liked that we could talk without shouting but that we could also not feel like we had to whisper.

4.0,9/19/2013,"What about this place is a cafe?I had a largely good experience here. Amuse started with arancini, I tried an heirloom tomato and watermelon salad, the dry aged steak, a suckling pig sampler and finished with a chocolate/yuzu desert. Complimentary madeleines at the end.The weakest part was probably the tomato salad. It came with huge chunks of watermelon, bits of feta, basil puree and balsamic vinegar. The puree looked gorgeous, but lacked flavor. I could not tell there was basil in it if I ate it with the tomato. There was also too much watermelon. It was pretty ripe, so quite sweet which didn't go well with the vinegar or tomatoes. I think it would have done better with much less watermelon, and chopped basil instead of the puree.The rest of the meal was nearly perfect. The beef was my favorite. Chantrelles, some sort of jus/wine sauce, Foie Gras, and spinach puree. It was mineraly and earthy all the way around. The pork was great as well. The chop was particularly delicious but I cannot remember the other parts of it at this point.The desert was a dark chocolate ganache on top of a crunchy rice cake with yuzu cream and gelee sprinkled about. This was very good.By the time the complimentary madeleines arrived we could not finish them. I wouldn't even have ordered desert had I known they would be so delcious. Maybe it was highlighted by the terribly dense financier I had at laudree earlier, but these warm and light cookies were just perfect.I really like this place and I'm on the fence about giving it 5 stars.

Food was okay but  not as tasty or special as I  remembered from previous visits. The worst part about the experience was that a woman sitting at the next table got up to smoke and she positioned herself directly in front of our table leaning on the outside of the scaffolding. Two men who were seated at the table next to her (one a minor fashion celebrity) got up and asked if they could bum cigarettes. The smoke was blowing right back at us.  I complained to the hostess who said she would send the maitre'd or manager to speak to them because they were too close to the tables. No one appeared until they were finished smoking, and all we got was a very cursory apology. I'm sure the smoker's celebrity contributed to us being ignored.

It was so interesting that beautiful is the only word I can think of using to describe it. (Although seeing how some reviewers don't seem to be a fan, it's possible I liked it so much because I like sweet dishes? :D)Desserts were lovely, but paled a little compared to the stellar main courses so unfortunately I can't objectively write home about them.

2.0,7/25/2013,"Well, what can I say. I'll start with the caveat that it was restaurant week, even though that should not be an excuse for crappy food. Even by restaurant week standards and with zero expectations, my companion and I were still disappointed. Courses:Arancini amuse bouche Rock shrimp ceviche (x2)Corn ravioli with chanterelles and tarragon pestoLamb with pearl couscous Poached blueberriesSalted caramel baravoisMadeleinesThe amuse bouche did indeed give us a taste of where this meal was headed. Upon biting into it, I stifled a laugh, telling my companion that I would tell her what it tasted like after she had tried it. She did, and immediately exclaimed that it tasted like a cheeto. Upon delving further in and getting some of the cheese, she agreed with me that it tasted like pizza, but by that point, all I could taste was the cheeto, so we called it a draw.The rock shrimp were tasteless, the pickled chiles surprisingly bland, and the fried chickpeas were horrifying in texture and taste--cheap peanuts that made no sense in the presence of seafood. The entrees were probably the best dishes, but still underwhelming. The lamb was cooked well, with a moroccan flair, but the half pita that accompanied the lamb (stuffed with iceberg lettuce, onions, and tomato) was pitiful. The corn ravioli was overly sweet and unimpressive--the (potentially canned) corn was simply stuffed into ravioli. No transformation there! Even the bread was mediocre--the plain roll and whole wheat were fine, but the butter roll was too salty. On to dessert, at which point the meal was dashed beyond all redemption. The ""poached blueberries"" numbered about 10, accompanied by a lemon foam (how I wish they had dared to simply put a bunch of blueberries in a bowl, topped with the lemon foam), cloying vanilla ice cream, and a bar of blueberry mousse that, in the words of a friend, ""looks like a stick of blue butter."" My companion's salted caramel baravois was equally unappetizing, with the end result that we decided the desserts were not worth the calories at the gym, and both were left mostly untouched.The madeleines were warm and freshly made, but so sweet that the lemon flavor was almost lost (for the best madeleines, go to Dominique Ansel's bakery--and avoid the cronut, which is the junkiest piece of crap to ever be overhyped).It's entirely possible that the restaurant is better during a non-restaurant week week, but we won't be paying more money to find out.",2,1,0,Seisei T.,"New York, NY",116,97,3
4.0,7/22/2013,"We dined for dinner at Cafe Boulud last week, on recommendations of a resident friend foodie. We had high expectations, given its Michelin star, as last summer we dined in a series of Michelin 1 to 3-starred restaurants in the south of France. It is probably not fair to compare the two environments as a big-city restaurant has entirely different economics to cope with. The differences: tables are far tighter, wait staff stretched further and slightly less skilled, higher noise levels, and fewer ""extras"" such as amuse bouche courses, etc. Notwithstanding that, our experience was an excellent one. I had the salmon carpaccio first course, my wife the crab salad, my main course was a seafood pasta with uniquely crafted sepia-tinted linguini, hers the vegetarian tagliatelli, and all were beautifully and artfully presented. We shared an elegantly composed dessert which included fresh fruit, a sorbet wrapped in a raspberry fruit leather, and a foam over a crumbled lavender meringue base. We shared an excellent bottle of Provencal rosé-the least expensive on their short list of rosés, and the tab including tip was $250, so in all a quite expensive evening. That said, the location just off 5th avenue in the upper East side is very prime real estate in one of the most expensive cities in the world so the price has to be considered reasonable for very fine dining. We would happily return, but probably opt for the fixed-price luncheon unless we were on some else's expense account.",0,0,0,Bruce B.,"Spokane County, WA",0,22,0

4.0,5/30/2013,"KenScale: 8.0/10Cafe Boulud, a casual sister to Daniel from the acclaimed chef Daniel Boulud, showcases a variety of menus divided into four sections: La Tradition (classic French), La Saison (seasonal cuisine), Le Potager (vegetarian dishes inspired by farmer's market), and Le Voyage (world cuisine). I came here for lunch, so didn't get to sample a variety of menus, but overall the dishes I tried were pretty solid.For appetizer, the octopus dish was a good start. Fettucine was somewhat underwhelming as the egg yolk made the dish a little heavy for my taste. Honey glazed duck breast, however, was excellent (would've been one of my favorite duck dishes if the meat had been a little less salty). For dessert, poached mango with panna cotta and sorbet really blended well together to create a complex and refreshing taste.The restaurant is a little upscale, and given the Upper East Side location and the price (median price of main dishes is in the $40 range), it does have a customer base that is on the older side, with a lot of men wearing jackets. The staffs are professional and friendly. It would be a place worth visiting for lunch if you're hanging around the Upper East Side for museum tours or for fancy dinner without going broke.

4.0,2/1/2013,"I would actually rate this 3.5 stars if I could.This place is right on fifth avenue next to central park so the location is great.The inside is attractive and the hotel it is in is also quite nice.The space is loud and tables are close together though not horribly so.  It can be hard to hear or have conversation here without speaking loudly.I ordered onion soup for appetizer.  It was good.I ordered wild mushroom risotto for entree.  It was very bland and shockingly boring.  I really expected more.The reason why I am giving 4 stars instead of 3 is because my friend ordered the duck and it was fabulous.  I tasted layers of flavor.  The meat was succulent and the fattiness of the duck was throughout the meat.  I was very impressed and have never had such tasty duck before.I think for my entree I should have stayed with the Restaurant Week offering of Winter Squash Ravioli.So really I had quite mixed feelings. Whoever made that risotto should be ashamed.  But whoever made that duck should be quite proud.While the risotto dish was a pasta dish obviously it wasn't cheap at $35.I would go back but I think I would follow the advice I have heard that ""La Tradition"" and ""La Saison"" are the best menus to order from (the duck was La Saison"" whereas the Risotto was from a different menu section (La Voyager?).",0,0,0,Emile M.,"Winter Haven, FL",1,74,14

Aside from the older clientele, it seemed everything was predominantly in shades of tan, including the awful tan-covered ceiling lights. Ugh.But other than that, quite a nice experience. Attentive service, great food. Not too dressy, but I would say the guys in sweaters looked a bit shabby next to the prevalent sport coats. We actually were in the area last summer, but the bf refused to let us walk-in as we were in tshirts :(I started out with the winter squash soup, which was nicely spiced. Dining partner had the endive salad with a light, yet flavorful vinaigrette. I stayed away due to the blue cheese, ugh! For mains, I had the tamarind glazed cod with a curry broth, which I found a bit uninspired and not as flavorful as SE Asian can be. Dining partner quite liked his Vermont chicken two ways, and he *never* orders chicken at a restaurant. The chicken had an earthy element with the chestnuts and sunchokes. For dessert, ordered cider compressed apples and were curious what the smoked vanilla was, which turned out to be a small cylinder of mousse..decent.Ended with an absolutely delightful small basket of hot-out-of-the-oven small madeleines.We enjoyed our experience here, and this has continued to push Boulud to the top of the bf's list of favs, especially after Daniel.",1,0,0,Eva W.,"San Francisco, CA",625,390,15

I also don't remember if they ever check back with me on if the food are cooked to my liking (a lot of the dishes are on the salty side).  On the plus side, the gnocchi is delicious (now I know what light as cloud gnocchi taste like).  The gnocchi melted in your mouth.  I can still remember the taste.The foie gras torchon is a must try.  I had reservation when waiter recommend the dish because I don't like cold foie gras.   This dish change my mind.  It light and refreshing.  Perfect for summer.",4,1,3,Capt k.,"Kirkland, WA",45,182,902

Few things are as delicious as a perfectly executed seared scallop. Do that well, and you're set.The cherries on my duck dish. Pickled, and sliced open so precisely to remove the pit, that it takes close inspection to find the incision. I had to search for the cut, only after I searched for the (missing) pit. Surgeons, take notes. And before you knock pickling as a trend that has come and gone, eat these cherries. They are enough to bring pickling back, even though it just left.The quinoa that came with the duck. I never thought I would say ""I love this quinoa, it's the highlight of the dish"". I said that. Quinoa. Really.The service. Effortless and excellent by-the-glass wine pairing for my meals, on top of the impeccable standard service. Also passed the OpenTable test - I wrote a note about how this lunch would be the last before my wife returned to work after maternity leave, so the hostess presented us with a Daniel bib, compliments of the house. They don't know how much I love that. Or maybe they do ...Finally, the complimentary fresh house madelines.Eat these, and no madeline will ever be as good. You'll likely need to go to Paris to experience better.

Each dish juxtaposed a number of elements working in harmony. The Peekytoe crab looked like a caterpillar roll sans the rice - a fat cylinder of crab shreds wrapped in cucumber. The octopus was accented with summer vegetables. The foie gras came in a generous slab sprinkled with coarse salt and paired with brioche triangles. We sat outside on a lovely day, sipping wine and nibbling on the beautifully composed, light plates of Southern French inspired food. Unfortunately the experience was marred by laughably bad service.

I am comparing the service with other RW restaurants such as Al Fiori, or Aldea. When waiters served a dish to me, they didn't explain the food. Waiters just put dishes on the table and left. I had to raised my hands to ask for food explanation. For all the michelin restaurants I have been to, waiters introduce the dishes to you when presented. I don't understand how did Cafe Boulud gained its one star with service like this. For food, it was at par. I started with chilled watercress soup with a poached quail egg and a slice of prosciutto. I did enjoy the poached quail egg, which was perfectly cooked. However I personally don't think it's a good idea using watercress to make soup, because of its distinct flavour. For main, I had pan seared flounder, which was ok. I think the fish was a little bit overcooked because it was a little bit dry. I enjoyed the desert very much. I ordered chocolate parfait and it was delicious. Probably I should go to Cafe Boulud for dinner and give it another chance.

The food arrived in good time but the bread was only offered when we got our entrees. The carrot soup was really good, perfect for a hot summer night. The foie gras is different, not pan seared but served cold, and was excellent. We both had duck so I cant comment on anything else but it was perfect.

A bit oversalted.- Cucumber gazpacho - thinner consistency than what I expected, but icy cold and refreshing with a dollop of (what tasted like) creme fraiche.  Complemented by some nice herbs and microgreens. Great for the sweltering NYC heat.- Shrimp toast - very tasty from the bite I had!- Steak - well cooked, tender, flavorful. Loved the watercress, the tender shallot and the poivre sauce. The potatoes rosti tasted a bit fishy, almost like anchovies, which was a bit weird.  Consistency was nice, but flavor was a little off.  Overall enjoyable though.- Trout dish was good - but the skin of the fish and the potatoes were both very salty. Flavorful once you got used to the salt.- Dessert was the vanilla bavarois and the dark chocolate mousse. Both were excellent, but the dark chocolate mousse was exceptional. Very very rich chocolate flavor, velvety smooth texture, and just a hint of sweetness. The ideal chocolate dessert! Also came with fresh madeleines, which were quickly devoured.Had the bottle of Orvieto to share, which wasn't the greatest wine, but for $24, who's complaining?  Staff was great and didn't rush us, even though we took our time enjoying our meal for sure.  Had a great time.",2,0,0,Sasha H.,"New York, NY",33,575,0

The duck breast was one of the best I have ever had in duck preparations, the lamb chops were very delicately flavoured. The striped bass was average (though it is their signature preparation). For desserts, the caramel brownie is exquisite, not what one expects, quite innovative. A-1 on desserts overall.Will surely go back here.....",0,0,0,Sridevi K.,"Los Gatos, CA",158,237,188

5.0,5/19/2012,"How To Redefine Your Definition of ""Good""I should preface by saying that I don't regularly make the rounds to all the high-end restaurants in NYC, so I can't make the snifty distinctions between the various shades of perfect like a ""true connoisseur"".   I can't honestly put it up against the likes of, say, Per Se or Eleven Madison Park and dig for any relative shortcomings.All I have is my base impression, which can be summed up in three letters: WOW.  I spared no expense for my wife's birthday and liberally sampled a variety of dishes and found each to be a delight to the senses.  Everything we tried leapt out at us with a vibrant succulence.  The desserts that followed were quite rich and were complimented quite well with a mascato wine.  The plating was as you'd expect to find in a high-end restaurant, the plate a canvas upon which the food becomes a composition.The waitstaff were exceptionally warm and attentive.  Places like this have it down to an art, somehow making you feel like the most important table in the room.Sadly, such a place is priced just beyond my ability to become a regular, limited only to special occasions, but it's good enough that I Iook forward to the next opportunity to celebrate at Cafe Boulud.",2,0,2,Ryan E.,"Elmhurst, NY",21,21,5

As an appetizer I tried both the broccoli veloute and the boston lettuce salad with a delicious, light, blue cheese dressing. Both were excellent- however I would maybe go with the broccoli soup or the shrimp as a more exciting tasting experience. For my entree I had the salmon on a bed of sunflower seeds and lentils- absolutely exquisite. The salmon was perfectly prepared and cooked- moist and flavorful and the pairing of sunflower seeds was a delicious pairing. As for dessert- the chocolate tart was the least exciting part of the meal. It was paired with a pistachio mousse that didn't quite match the flavors.

3.0,3/26/2012,"Ok, here it goes ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, I hate arriving at a restaurant after making a reservation well in advance at a later time and being shown to the worst table in the place. The culprit was a curved booth by the staging area and hall to the kitchen and restrooms. The fact that this was a bone of contention was that every other booth at the back was empty except the one 20  inches from this one. We literally would have been sitting on top of a couple and both facing them................. we asked to be seated at a table one row up, which was fine. My next issue was the arrival of a chefs tasting almost the minute we sat down; before we could order a drink and after dumping two menus both upside down in our lap. I asked a nice gal to please bring us another little "" hot"" sampling after we sipped on our cocktails......... She actually began to argue the point but wisely decided to remove it to our waiters attention at said staging area.............. our waiter was neither good or bad, indifferent and lacking details seemed to be what he was best at. The additional staff was good. All of this was over ridden by excellent food from start to finish ........... really it was all fantastic French cuisine . it's possibly worth going just for the buttery warm basket of Madeline's at the end..........

1.0,3/5/2012,"I went to Cafe Boulud on Friday night. I was excited to try food from such a French master, but I was horribly disappointed.Maybe I should have expected this out of the UES, but every patron looked like Bunny MacDougal. I felt sorely out of place for having forgotten my pearls! I am 30, my boyfriend is 33, and the other 2 people in my party were 48 and 53, and we were BY FAR the youngest people in the restaurant.I had the Vermont Chicken ""Coq au Vin"". When it arrived, it was cold, which doesn't usually bother me because I don't like piping hot food, but when I tasted my boyfriend's meal (which was warm), it made me notice that my food was colder than room temperature. Also, I noticed that there was bacon in the dish, and I don't eat pork. I didn't send the meal back because I wasn't that hungry and I didn't want to be a nuisance, but when the waiter checked up on us, I mentioned that the description on the menu should have mentioned the pork. Instead of being in any way apologetic that I had a negative experience, he said, ""Everyone knows Coq au Vin has bacon in it"". I am not at all ignorant about food or fine dining, and this was news to me, so apparently that's not common knowledge. I was so put off about how rude he was to me! My other friend had the short ribs and complained that they were bland. The other 2 people in our party thought their meals were ""alright"", but both said they didn't like them enough that they would go back, especially at $40 per entree prices.I had a much nicer experience at both Jean-Georges and Del Posto.

We also had the fusilli with sea urchin-- definitely a must-order.

5.0,2/11/2012,"The nicest meal I have eaten in my life so far... (I am young yet)I came for restaurant week lunch with 5 friends.  We dressed up for the occasion.  The place itself is really nice looking, the heat light in the lobby was much appreciated, and I like how the restaurant didn't look over-designed.  It looked like an upscale banquet room, with its cushy chairs and the layout of the room.The amuse bouche was arancini.. everyone gets one.  They also have a tray of bread floating around the room with regular rolls, raisin walnut, and sourdough.  I'll be honest, because it was just moving around the room, the bread was a little hard and not really worth eating.  I guess we were just hungry.  I ordered (I don't remember the menu descriptions entirely) arugula salad with pear & bacon, squash ravioli in brown butter with sage and pecorino, and cheesecake with vanilla ice cream.  Everything was just incredibly delicious.  The salad was perfectly dressed with something lemony.  The ravioli was buttery and melted in your mouth and the squash inside was just delicious.  And the cheesecake was the softest, creamiest I've ever had.. they must use mascarpone or something in it?  The cheesecake had a few little pieces of stuff on top, some of which were pear.. it kind of tasted like little pieces of pear that you got in those syrupy fruit cups as a kid. Weird.  Still, SO good, and the ice cream had flecks of vanilla bean.  They bring warm madeleines at the end for everyone!I got to try the cauliflower ver..something.  REALLY good, it tasted like creamy sauce/soup!  I also had a bite of the fluke ... it was really well prepared, but I honestly hate fish.  Still the tastiest I can imagine fish being.  I also tried the pig sausage with daikon slaw (?) which was really good!  It had a sophisticated hot dog flavor..if that is not too much of an oxymoron to make sense.  I also tried the cranberry clafouti w/ pistachio ice cream.. the former wasn't too special, but the flavor of the ice cream was divine.Everything (obviously) was plated beautifully.  Portions are small but because it was 3 courses, I walked out comfortable full - not overstuffed like a regular restaurant would make you feel.  Good job, France.  Service was really good...we kind of didn't understand the switching of plates and silverware that we hadn't used, but still, the servers were helpful and all dishes are brought out and put in front of everyone at the same time.  The cloth napkins are warm when you arrive.  My water glass was never empty.  They've thought of all the little things at Cafe Boulud, which makes that $24.07 even more incredibly well spent.",1,0,0,Robin K.,"San Francisco, CA",22,100,0
5.0,2/9/2012,"Speechless. Cafe Boulud tops all the Boulud restaurants in their service and food offerings.  The Service was attentive and friendly and I was amazed to see that even in their formality, they were super considerate in seating a group in their sweatsuits and a family that brought along their crying baby. I have dined here restaurant week and non restaurant week and they did not minimize the food offerings.  There was an amuse bouche - delicious risotto with truffle cheese ball fried and non-greasy -amazing.  The desserts were beautiful and light (cheesecake/cranberry clafouti/chocolate mousse sensation, each paired with uniquely flavored gelato).  The shrimp ceviche appetizer was generous and flavorful and beautifully presented.  The cauliflower veloute with salmon roe was wonderful and I am one that ordinarily dislikes cauliflower.  The fish entree was moist and the veal was delicious paired uniquely.  I went there twice for this same restaurant week and tasted the meal twice and it was better and better.  The bread offerings (nut bread/ butter roll/french bread) were wonderful even better than dbBistro and Boulud Sud.  I love fresh baked breads.  (What in the world is wrong with Ai Fiori that they cannot offer such great bread? and Fiorello who charges for bread? ) The wine was well selected and a phenomenal bargain at $24.  And then they topped it with mini Madelines.  Adorable and delicious with a touch of lemon.  I loved Del Posto and River Cafe who are both not participating in restaurant week this winter but Boulud is defintely the winner this year.  The decor is slightly better at Park Winter but the Service at Boulud was friendly and courteous.  I am amazed that they treated everyone with egalitarian professionalism and were not stuffy formal and uncomfortable as many upscale restaurants do.  Boulud Sud is also wonderful for food but the place is too noisy next to the kitchen and the Service is not as attentive as it is here. Jimmy was friendly and knowledgeable about the wines and Thanos was extremely courteous.   Cafe Boulud was very crowded but the seating was well spaced.   My sister was not disappointed as she was with the terrible hotel banquet food at LeCaprice and the stuffiness and stacked tables at One if by Land. The Obama fundraiser was held at Daniel for $38,000 a head but I am certain that when we dined at Boulud Sud it was great food too and that Cafe Boulud was a good sampling of Daniel.

2.0,1/21/2012,"Having been to a wonderful meal at Cafe Boulud in the past, I was really excited to see them on the  list for NYC Restaurant week . For $25, you get a 3 course prix fix meal at a restaurant that is normally rather astronomically priced. My grandmother lives right around the corner which makes it an ideal spot for a family get together. I'd made a reservation for 6 people a week prior, and called the morning of our lunch to change it to 7 people. I was given a rather odd response of, ""We don't take parties larger than 6 people. Did you already invite the 7th?"" When I explained that it was a family gathering and we'd all be coming, she still said it wasn't something they do. I went on further to say that we are a very petite family and didn't mind squishing a bit, she went to ask the manager and finally came back with an 'ok'.When we arrived and were seated, the bread tray with 3 choices was brought around. The butter roll, the plain roll and sourdough bread. I decided to try all 3 of them and it's a good thing because It's basically what ended up making me feel full by the end of our meal. The breads were very good, but nothing to write home about. Next, an amuse-bouche of fried truffle/risotto balls were given to us. Though they were crispy, warm and melty, I couldn't taste the truffle at all, and they were pretty unremarkable.I shared all 3 courses with my boyfriend so that we could taste more of what they were offering. We started with the arugula salad with quince and bacon, as well as the fluke carpaccio with jalapeno. The salad was a bit over-dressed for my liking, and it was pretty boring. Just because it's unique to use quince on top, does not make this interesting enough to win any prizes. The fluke, however, was marvelous. The flavoring of fennel and hot peppers brightened the dish and awakened the mild fish. This was the most noteworthy dish of the day.For our first entrée we shared the winter squash ravioli with pecans, brown butter and sage. It was sweet and rich, but honestly, I didn't think it was any more gourmet than the frozen ravioli you can buy from Fresh Direct. Our other entrée, the grouper, was a complete disaster. When I order fish at a high-end restaurant, I expect it to be exquisitely cooked and seasoned. This piece was so over-salted that it was a disaster. Did the chef accidentally spill the salt on top? The collard greens that came with it were also over-seasoned, not to mention cooked into to a soggy pile of mush. It was really kind of awful. I could not eat it and informed the waitress as such. What a disappointment.The dessert course, as is often the case, redeemed the meal's shortcomings. We were given a molten chocolate cake for the middle of the table (presumably because of my fish-complaint) and it was delicious. Crusty outer layer and hot, melty, rich interior. A perfect scoop of vanilla bean ice cream sat alongside it making for a lovely presentation. I will never tire of molten chocolate for dessert, passe as it may be. We also shared the chocolate mousse with pear compote and hazelnut ice cream. It came enrobed in a dark chocolate ganache layer and the inside was creamy and decadent, with the pears as a lovely unexpected touch. Finally, I moved on to the butterscotch gateaux with marscapone and devil's food. YUM. It had little crispy bits on the cake and it was impossible to not finish it in 30 seconds flat. By then, even though we were totally stuffed but the waiter came by with little buckets of mini Madeleines and we managed to make a little bit more tummy space for them. Worth every confectioner's sugar topped bite.Overall, this meal was a let down. My expectations were high, true, but that's because I've had such great experiences there in the past. I feel that the patrons who order from the restaurant week menu  do not really get a fair representation of what Boulud can do. Not only was the food only so-so, the portions were so itsy bitsy tiny that if I hadn't indulged in all 3 types of bread and all of the extra desserts, I would have left still feeling very hungry.

Cafe Boulud just jumped to the top 5 of my list of favorites in the city.

Every course was better than the last, there was never a low point of the night. Service was perfect. For the food: The amuse was a little risotto ball which was piping hot and phenomenal. Started with the risotto and finished with the waygu beef special which was cooked perfectly. I paired it with a nice Bordeaux and it was a party for my taste buds. The dessert was the warm apple tatin and it was a great end to the meal, I highly suggest it.

4.0,11/23/2011,"When my aunt, Susan, is in town, she loves to take me to fabulous brunches at restaurants that I would not, otherwise, frequent.  Case in point:  Cafe Boulud. Situated in Manhattan's ritzy Upper East Side, CB (Cafe Boulud) is the neighborhood's quintessential restaurant for its well-heeled residents.  But don't let that statement/description scare you away, because CB offers a fabulous 2-course, prix fixe brunch for $39.  Still sound too steep?  It's really not, especially when you consider the fact that you're eating critically acclaimed French cuisine paired with impeccable service.  Oh, and that's not to mention the added amuse bouche and other sweet surprises in store for your dining experience...The meal began with a loaf of freshly-baked baguette and sea-salted butter.  The amuse bouche that followed was the most delightfully crisp, black truffle-flecked arancini.  For my two courses, I chose to begin with the Crepes Suzette with vanilla chantilly, followed by the Scrambled Eggs with butter-poached lobster and a side of toasted brioche.    To end the meal on a sweet note, the kitchen brought us a gratis basket of warm, buttery, house-made mini madeleines.  Tres parfait!",1,0,0,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184

5.0,10/22/2011,"If you want to slightly splurge on brunch, Cafe Boulud is a splendid way to do it.  The $39 2 course prix-fixe menu was a treat in every aspect.We started with a crunchy loaf of French bread.  Then came the first course: delicately-folded, citrus-glazed orange crepes Suzette with vanilla chantilly cream, and a charcuterie plate with salami, prosciutto, pate, and ham for the bf.  Both were wonderful.Next came the entrees.  The standout hit was the hanger steak and eggs.  Hanger steak is all-too-often a tough cut of meat - - but this was probably the creamiest, crisp-on-the-outside flavorful and moist-on-the-inside cut of hanger steak I've ever sunk teeth into.  Its one of those dishes of which you will remember the taste long after it is gone.The crab cake eggs Benedict was over 1"" thick, completely filled with Peekytoe, and as if there wasn't enough crab, topped in a crabby cream sauce.  The crab itself was a little bit drier than what I would have expected but the sheer meatiness of the cake certainly helped compensate.A very nice finishing touch was the arrival of a basket filled with buttery, freshly baked madeleines, straight out of the oven.  They were the perfect ending.Why should dinner be the most indulgent meal of my day?  I'm coming back to brunch at Cafe Boulud.",1,0,0,Tracy K.,"San Francisco, CA",106,180,109
5.0,10/19/2011,"I lucked out in a sense since my visit to NYC coincided with their restaurant week and on the last day of their extended restaurant week I took advantage of their three course menu for only $24.07. Pretty neat coming from a 1 star Michelin restaurant.But of course, I did enjoy the ambiance for lunch, dressy in nature, and the dining room was very much of a high class quality. I'm glad I did the reservation thing because I got the privilege of sitting inside so I can enjoy the scenery. The non-reservation folks did manage to get some seating but was limited to outdoors on metallic tables. Not really my forte for the meal I've been wanting so long.The staff was very formal in all sense from the order taking, supplying an endless amount of different types of bread to refilling the water without hesitation.Even if I didn't chose the restaurant week special, the pricing for this type of restaurant's caliber was relatively cheap. But here was my 3 course meal:Started off with the Ceasar salad with anchovies, croutons, and Parmesan dressing. And these were real anchovies too. Nice, and fluffy...and not fat fluffy but more like it was tossed and aerated before it was served. yelp.com/biz_photos/TQEa…For the main course, I got the grilled marinated Leg of Lamb - with Pommes pont neuf, peach and natural jus. Very nice and tender. Juicy, and cuts real smooth like butter. yelp.com/biz_photos/TQEa…And for dessert, got the Paris Brest. It has pastry cream, poached pineapple and vanilla ice cream.

I guess that's the UES schedule.  We ordered eggplant ravioli and heirloom tomatoes for appetizers.  Both were good, but not amazing.  The ravioli came in a tomato sauce and included a few delicately fried eggplant chips, which were my fave parts of the dish.  The tomato salad came on a bed on pesto jello (my culinary vocabulary is limited).   For entrees, we got the salmon and a special of Vermont lamb.  The salmon was perfectly cooked.  The meat was tender and the skin was crispy.  The bed of corn that it came on was also delicious.  The lamb was the stand out of the night!  It tasted like it had some kind of indian influence with curry flavors.  For dessert, we shared the molten chocolate cake, which was amazing.  All in all, the food was great and the service very attentive.  Only drawback is that the crowd here is older.  I think we were the youngest in the room, in our mid-20s.

2.0,8/19/2011,"We ate at Cafe Boulud for restaurant week for summer 2011 and were sorely disappointed.  This place came with great reviews; however, unless a lot of people didn't have experience with fine dining than they were dead wrong.  The service to the food was poor for fine dining standards especially in NYC.  Don't get me wrong.  Compared to a TGIF it was great but compared to a Jean Georges it was mediocre.  In fact we've had okay, okay french food in Englewood, NJ that was better than Cafe Boulud.At first we thought maybe CB dumbed and cheapened the Restaurant Week menu so that tourists and people normally not familiar with great food will still have the warm and fuzzies; however, my aunt ordered the Cavatelli off their regular menu and it was awful.  It tasted like a dish you could get at Macaroni Grill.  The pasta was al dente but the sauce was cheap, thin, weak, had no depth, and only had a few clams thrown in and at $34 I would've rather spent it at Macaroni Grill.  We also had a ""salad"" as a first course and honest to god my instant noodle making sister could create a better salad for $10 for a table of 6.  The greens they used were fresh; however, that's all that was on the salad plate except some bacon bits that any diner cook could create all covered with a thin, bland creamy ranch style dressing.  Everything from the veal to the fish was very normal.  Cooked well but uninspired.  If you know fine dining you will not be happy dropping a hundred or more on this place.  To top it off the dessert was pretty but very plain tasting.  I've had better desserts from Wegman's food court.  Also it's a given that this type of dining provides miniscule portions but it looks like they took a typical restaurant serving of cake and ice cream and somehow managed to slice it into thirds to serve.  It's embarrassing when the ice cream ""scoop"" is the size of a children's marble and the sliver of cake could almost double as a stick of lip balm.On top of all that the service was more friendly, warm, sincere, and attentive at a local Greek diner.  Twice we asked for our almost empty water glasses to be filled only to be dismissed with a curt a ""sure"", ""okay okay"".  We asked a third time which by then was right before dessert.  Also with a plate full of used lemons we had to remind them that we still wanted lemons with our waters.  Kids at Red Robins do a better job of keeping your water glasses filled.  The bread server didn't even follow the proper etiquette of serving the ladies at our table first.  I had to repeatedly defer my orders and service to the ladies so I would be served last as is the way in high end dining.  All the while I was thinking, ""Where did they get these guys from and why the hell aren't they being trained properly???""  A clear example of the attitude of the servers there:  When told we were not having wine with our lunch they did not bother to remove the wine glasses from the small, crowded table and only did so after I asked which was replied with a brusk, ""Yeah of course!""  Well why then my shaved head master of all waiters did I have to ask well into the second round of breads for that to happen?Overall very, very disappointing.  Our experience last year at Jean Georges was extremely different.  Waitstaff all extremely pleasant, patient, and attentive.  Food was excellent for Restaurant Week at a time when most places will cut corners during RW to fool the average diner and tourist and selection was outstanding even letting you choose 2 lunch entrees instead of 1 started and 1 entree if you wished.  Save your cash and find another restaurant if you care about fine food and good service.",0,0,0,T M.,"Nowhere Creek, AK",0,12,2
5.0,8/13/2011,"Full review blogged, a few high points below:With Chef Kaysen greeting us tableside as we sipped our champagne I figured deferring to my friends would be the better part of valor and much like their previous visit to the restaurant they opted to place our night in the hands of the Chef with a couple of specific requests to which Gavin was happy to oblige.Moving on to our courses I'll once again state here that my memories are fuzzy, especially as each diner was served a different plate for each of the first four courses plus dessert, but what I can remember is that all but one dish was impressive while many bordered on outstanding and a few crossed the threshold to perfection.  Amongst the best was the ""soup"" course and the moment I first realized what Chef Kaysen was capable of  as three different plates arrived, each referencing a different style, place, and part of the menu; and each absolutely superb.  First sourcing the International theme of Mexican, then French Tradition, and finally the Daily Market plates #1) Traditional Pozole Soup - White Hominy, Pork Shoulder, Guajillo, #2 Asperges Blanches Gratinée - Hen Egg, Sauce Béarnaise, Frisée, #3) Warm Pea Soup with onion ravioli, pea tendrils, olive oil showed a skill set not often seen in a restaurant with each of the varying styles showing great poise and using savory to balance sweet, vegetal to tame heavy, and unique textures such as the partially crisped hen egg or toothsome hominy to throw a curveball into the otherwise creamy presentations.For the fish course we would once again see the Classic, Market, and Mexican presentation with the classic actually a dish harkening back to the days when Daniel inhabited the space.  With the dishes presented as #1) Striped Bass en Paupiette - Pomme Purée, Baby Leeks, Sauce Meurette, #2) Slow Baked Branzino - Carrot Ginger Purée, Shitake Mushrooms, Scallions, Miso Emulsion, and #3) Chili Spiced Monkfish - Black Beans, Cilantro, Chimichurri, Housemade Tamale this trio once again showed Kaysen's deft hand with globe-trotting flavor profiles and while the classic Bass was quite impressive with the crisp potato skin and flaky fish nicely complimented by the rings of sauces and purees it was actually my least favorite of the trio largely because one featured my favorite fish, Branzino, paired with a beautiful assortment of Asian inspired flavors that brought out many of the fish's sweeter tones while the other did something I'd have never expected with Monkfish and made it spicy without losing a bit of it's buttery undertones while also delivering a Tamale with sweet corn and pork that was as good as any ever to grace my palate.With cheese blocks cleared and my companions getting full three desserts would arrive and having seen one that particularly interested me on the online menu my inquiry led to a fourth on the house.  Again traversing the globe the plates arriving included #1) Rum Glazed Bananas - Milk Chocolate Crémeux, Smoked Cinnamon Anglaise, Hibiscus Sorbet, #2) Basil Poached Mango - Coconut Mousse, Passion Curd, Pina Colada Sorbet, Basil Caviar, #3) Dark Chocolate Mousse with Pistachio Cremeux, Chocolate Sable, Pistachio Ice Cream, and by request #4) Baba au Rhum - Poached Pineapple, Macadamia Brittle, Vanilla Ice Cream - each larger than expected - and all but the mango right up my alley with ornate presentations and delicious complex flavors abound, particularly the wheel of caramelized boozy bananas atop creamy chocolate and the dense baba finished tableside with aged rum carrying a crunchy tropical shell atop its rounded base.With a great meal now behind us and Gavin again thanking us and signing copies of the night's menu before returning to the kitchen we sat as a group for a while chatting before making our way to the door where coats were collected and thanks were provided both ways for such a lovely evening - an evening that nearly 5 months later still resonates with me and makes me wonder just what Michelin is thinking by giving Kaysen only one star when the food - supposedly the only thing that Michelin judges when awarding stars - is every bit as good as Boulud's Three-Star flagship.",0,0,1,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",3078,4440,99503

4.0,7/21/2011,"This was my fist attempt at dining solo. The sign of a real foodie, I suppose. I'm very glad I did, because this place was a pleasant treat. I came for lunch during Restaurant Week. I was seated in the corner with a view of the entire restaurant. It was definitely elegant, but the decor was really nothing special or unusual. I started with the Pate de Campagne which included brandy soaked cherries, whole grain mustard, radishes, baby mache. I splurged a little since I typically eat fairly healthy and don't have pate often. It was very tasty. For my main course I chose the Harissa Marinated Flounder with petit pois, pearl cous cous, yogurt dressing. It was fantastic. My only gripe was the portion size. It was so tiny, even for lunch. The service was really impeccable for the most part. My water glass was always filled promptly, my empty dishes were removed right away and when I began to stand up my table was pulled out to allow for an easy exit from my seat. The only issue I had was the fact that my dessert was brought out less than 2 minutes after I finished my entree. I did not have any time to begin to digest. I guess it ended up being a good thing that my piece of flounder was so tiny. I ordered the Raspberry Vanilla Dome with Vanilla Bavaroise, Raspberry Gelee and Crème Fraiche Sorbet for dessert. The chef sent over mini Madeleine cookies to go with and they definitely added to the overall composition. In total, dessert was rather delicious and did the trick to fill me up prior to heading back to my office. Although the food was really great, there's nothing special about this restaurant. Since I prefer to try places that I've never been before, I don't really see a reason to return.",0,0,0,Steph B.,"Manhattan, NY",168,28,0

I appreciated the elegant and understated decor of the place, but the atmosphere was too muted for my taste. The service was above average. I had the prix fixe 2-course brunch menu, starting with the charcuterie plate. I thought the selection of cured meats was well balanced. I particularly liked the terrine. My main course was the farm fresh baked eggs, which were good but dull. At a place like this, I expected at least a more sophisticated flavoring. Eggs are eggs; the small details make all the difference. The glass of white burgundy I had with brunch was fantastic. Maybe my expectations for Cafe Boulud were higher than they would've been for other upscale places without such a famous association, but I felt the quality of my meal just didn't match the price.

4.0,6/13/2011,"I came here for my Sunday birthday brunch eager to try out one of nyc's top restaurants, but slightly concerned about atmosphere. As reviews say, atmosphere is slightly stuffy with UES snobs, but not that overbearing. Just be sure to dress up as this is a Michelin starred restaurant. The setting is very modern and formal. Service- did seem a little impersonal as they had four or five people attending to us. Still everything was done very precisely. As this is my first Michelin restaurant, i guess this is how service is.Onto the food-  They served an amuse bouche of risotto balls maybe with pea puree? It was ok, tasted like just rice in a ball. 1st course was db's smoked salmon with capers on a toasted brioche. Salmon was good and the flavors all meshed well with the creaminess and slightly sweetness of the creme fraiche with the pungent bites of capers. They also had small shredded bits of this yellow substance, most likely lemon? Good, but nothing too special.2nd course- was maine peektoe crab benedict with with wilted arrowleaf spinach and sauce choron. This was very tasty, slightly sweet and sour at the same time. The portion was pretty big, probably twenty bites to eat it. At the end, it was a little too much, but it was definitely tasty at first bite.3rd course- dessert! i had a white chocolate coconut mousse with almond dacquoise, passionfruit sauce pina and colada sorbet. Sorbet was very good, it had this airy but still substantial tangy flavor. and combined with the almond cracker like crust and chocolate bits made it sweet and sour, but with a subtle flair. The white chocolate cake was also good as well, the cake being lightly sweet and also slightly sour with passionfruit sauce on top.  The dessert was definitely the high point of the meal.

4.0,6/9/2011,"As snobby as this sounds, I am generally more a fan of white table cloth UES/West Village dining than grungy E. Village dining. So if you are like me, you will enjoy Cafe Boulud. My husband and I took my sister here for her a quick birthday brunch since it is close to where she works (Cornell hospital is only a few blocks over!) and were surprised that at 1:45, there was still a small wait to get seated by the Maitre'd. So happens, this place is PACKED with UES ladies having a late lunch with their Chanel-or-Hermes-handbag-Fendi-defile-runway-dress-Manolo Blahnik-shoe wearing (sorry to name names, I'm in the industry... can't be helped!) girlfriends and an occasional couple of tables with power-lunching businessmen. Despite some looks from one particular older lady sitting near us, most guests were really to themselves.Service wise, they were warm, welcoming and thoughtful in remembering to wish my sister a Happy Birthday. Food wise, I really loved the lunch pre-fixe special (appetizer, main & dessert). It was somewhere between $35-45 for the lunch pre-fixe in which I had the broccoli parmesan soup, roasted duck and tangy lemon tart. All perfectly executed and vibrant with flavor.

4.0,5/25/2011,"I came here on someone else's dime (yay); just note that I think my review would be a smidge less starry if I had been the one footing the bill.This was my first foray into Boulud-land and admittedly, I liked what I saw. I wore my finest black dress, pearls and a shawl and was able to blend in perfectly with the (much, much older) Upper East Side crowd, although there were a few boisterous jeans-wearers. The vibe was a little stuffy, but not pretentious. I do wish that they had a better place to sit and wait, as I was the first of my party to arrive and did not enjoy standing awkwardly in front of the coat check. On to the food. It's a very interesting menu - all a la carte, in four categories. You're offered bread right away, and continuously throughout the entire meal. It's good (you'll always have bread when you need it...), but didn't taste particularly special and got a bit oppressive after a while. Wine selection was good - hilariously marked-up - and I liked watching the sommelier sashay around like he owned the place.The pea soup was perfect (complete with ravioli surprise at the bottom) and my poulet rouge was the juiciest, most flavorful chicken I've had in ages. All the tiny accoutrements (sabayon, crispy spiral, a single perfectly prepared asparagus spear) reminded me that, yes, I was Somewhere Fancy. Other highlights were the lamb and the beef entrecote, although the latter was the smallest beef portion I have ever seen - I understand fine dining, but this was almost ridiculous, considering the price. Apparently the monkfish (off the Voyage menu) was not great...so maybe don't get that.Desserts were a standout, all of them, and damned if they don't brew a fabulous cup of coffee.",1,1,0,Julie A.,"Manhattan, NY",38,183,4
3.0,4/15/2011,"I had high expectation for this place because of the high praises from several respected food bloggers and the Michelin Guide.  The expectation was not met.  Bread service was disappointing.  The selections were cold and the mini baguette was a bit soggy and had no crunch.  Butter temperature was still too cold to spread.  The octopus carpaccio appetizer was the star of the night - fresh, flavorful, perfectly executed - a solid 5-star performance.  The squid ink pasta was good, but it was nothing to write home about.  The beef ribeye was tiny in portion considering the hefty price tag.  The meat was not very marbled and tasted a bit dry without the sauce - huge disappointment.  The baba au rhum was almost perfect, except for the generous drizzle of fresh rum table side.  While I appreciated the show, I thought the extra rum ruined the balance of an otherwise perfectly soaked cake.  The complimentary madeleine was as good as the ones in Daniel.  Service was great.  Decor is neutral and comfortable.  But the seats were too close to one another, making going to the washroom a hectic affair.  The crowd was decidedly old.  I'm pretty sure we were the only two people below the age of 40.  I wanted to give it a higher rating because the service was great and the appetizer was excellent.  Unfortunately, the rest of the dinner simply fell short.  Perhaps it was an off night.  But based on this visit, I do not see how this place could get a Michelin star.",0,0,0,Rich W.,"Palatine, IL",45,100,1
4.0,4/10/2011,"My girlfriend and I went out for a nice weekend dinner here last night. We haven't dabbled in much French cuisine, so it was a nice change of palette. The servers were very courteous and very helpful in explaining various appetizers that we weren't quite sure of based on the descriptions. The bread server came around often, and our water glasses were always filled. Definitely better service compared to some of the more high-end places I've been to in New York.As for the food itself - very well, with one exception. The appetizers were very well put-together...I got the ahi tuna nicoise, while my girlfriend got one of the daily specials (the Australian hiramasa crudo, which it turns out is yellowtail amberjack). The ahi tuna was a mix of both raw and cooked tuna, which provided a nice contrast. What really brought out the fish was the rest of the dish, which added a very diverse flavor to both appetizers. For the main course, I had the grilled Arctic char, while my girlfriend had the lamb loin. Both were delicious; the lamb was very succulent and infused with a lightly peppered taste. The char was basically what I would imagine salmon to be if it had a little firmer texture. That being said, some parts of the lamb were a bit chewier than I would expect. And the one big strike against the char was that while the top half was grilled, the underside and the middle of the filet was definitely undercooked. I know it's not supposed to be firm all the way around, but it definitely shouldn't have the texture of lukewarm mush. To top off the meal, dessert was great - the molten chocolate cake was not the best I've had, but it was very rich. I had the rum-soaked cake with pineapples, with macadamia brittle vanilla ice cream, which was amazing...the rum wasn't too harsh a taste, and the ice cream was the highlight of the dish.All in all, it was a very enjoyable dining experience. The portions are a bit small relative to other upscale places I've been, but all of the food was very delicious. If you do get fish, just make sure that it's cooked all the way through...that was the only major blemish for an otherwise stellar dinner.",2,1,2,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169
4.0,4/5/2011,"Conclusion: going to restaurants with people who know people is infinitely more rewarding to my taste buds. Perhaps I should back up. One of my friends happens to know Chef Gavin Kaysen*, so we stopped in the kitchen and brought the staff some choice beers. Kaysen was a great sport about us poking our heads in and he seems like a great guy. Since my first visit here, my taste preferences have changed and grown (hopefully for the better). While my mind wasn't as blown because I've since become accustomed to good food, my meal was positively delightful and the Chef came to check on us a couple times before heading out for the night. It's difficult, but infinitely fun, eating with a small group of young chefs. We all ordered different dishes and passed them around so we could each sample a bit or two of the savory goodness. As a result, I'm not really going to list every dish that I enjoyed. Suffice to say that I had a great time and would definitely go back to Cafe Boulud. It's definitely my kind of food and as long as Chef Gavin Kaysen is there, I will gladly put my dinner in his hands.-------------------------*In 2007, he represented the US at the Bocuse d'Or.

5.0,4/3/2011,"Café Boulud exists on another level. There are maybe 10 restaurants in New York City that are worth comparing it to. There should be a completely separate section of Yelp for these restaurants, because to compare them to every other restaurant in New York makes absolutely no sense. Everything about Café Boulud is world class. Some reviewers are picky because they think its too expensive or because it was restaurant week so they feel entitled.

5.0,4/1/2011,"I brought my mother here for her 50th birthday in mid March. She wanted fancy (but she doesn't have fancy tastebuds) so I did my best to find a place that will be foo-foo enough to make her happy but have food on the menu that won't intimidate her; that she will actually EAT. Cafe Boulud fit the bill, even though she did ask the waiter if the lamb was ""LAMBY"". The atmosphere is surprisingly laid back. People were talking. Tables were talking to other tables. We made friends! The service is good; not the best I have ever experienced, but good. The menu here is fantastic. You can pick from any of the categories for the prix fixe (La tradition, classics & country cooking; La Saison, flavors of the season; Le Potager, inspired by the market; Le Vogage, inspired by other cultures) You can also do a 7 course tasting menu, which I would have done with other company, but my mom doesn't eat many things. Next time, I will definitely want to try the chef's tasting menu. Firstly, I began my meal with the Pleiades Cobbler, a drink that sounds like a dessert, but instead of fat, there's booze. Great. Then, out came the bread. Delicious little rolls with whole kalamata olives baked in! Yay!Time to order. I chose the foie gras served with pain perdue cubes and orange marmalade for my appetizer. Classic, executed flawlessly. My mother ordered the short rib dumplings which were wonderfully savory with a crispy, thin wrapper. I could have eaten both appetizers myself and not thought twice. For my entree, I had the venison loin with some sort of root vegetable... springy, moussey triangle thing?! I honestly don't remember exactly what it was but I believe it contained rutabaga. Regardless, it was brilliant. Small cubes of beautifully cooked, medium rare venison sat upon my plate like an edible work of art. I have pictures. You'll agree it's one good-lookin' plate. Mother ordered the lamb, which came with some sort of gelee that she quarantined to the corner of her plate. She agreed that the lamb was not ""LAMBY"" (which, I guess means gamey?) and enjoyed every last bite.Dessert time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Since the portions are small (which most people in the good US of A would complain about... but I'm not looking to gorge myself til' I'm sick and still manage to leave with a duffel sized doggie bag) I had PLENTY of room to enjoy dessert. My mother ordered the souffle (I'm not a souffle person. I think they taste like flavored scrambled eggs.) and I got TWO desserts. Count 'em. TWO. It's my body. I do what I want.First: a heavenly butterscotch & chocolate bar topped with sea salt. Creamy, rich, and sweet. And finally, the piece de resistance: a simple citrus napolean. Fresh orange, tangerine, and grapefruit segments layered with pastry cream between buttery tuille cookies with a citrus sorbet. So refreshing and delicious! I would consider it a perfect dessert.I'm totally psyched to see what they'll have going on for Spring and Summer with the abundance of local fruits and vegetables.

5.0,3/18/2011,"If you're anything like me, when confronted with an expansive and varied menu at a fine dining restaurant, you panic. it's impossible to decide exactly what you want because everything looks irresistible. Also, if you're anything like me, you don't like making choices in great restaurants anyway, since you trust the chef and want him to to choose what he thinks is best. So, if you're like me, you take a perfunctory look at the menu when it's offered and then promptly ignore it and ask for the tasting menu (which isn't on the printed menu, you have to inquire about it). You also order the wine pairing because hey, it's your birthday and you don't mind getting a little tipsy. Then you sit back and enjoy the ride.5 courses was actually more like 8 with the amuse and desserts taken into account, each paired with a glass of wine that matched the course perfectly (or almost perfectly in one or two cases). Earlier courses focused mainly on seafood, starting raw, progressing to cooked then to pasta and then meat in later courses. My girlfriend and I each got different, though similar, dishes for each course and most of the courses had 3 or 4 components from the menu so by the end of the meal I think we'd sampled almost everything.Everything was cooked perfectly, delays were few, with just enough space between courses to finish our wine and discuss the last course. The service was simultaneously very efficient and friendly. One of the waiters was obviously new which through a little hitch into the service as he tried to remember the placement of the forks between courses and get our wine pours even, but he managed to play it off and just added some comic relief to the evening.Attire is all over the map, from dressy to casual. Several people were there in hoodies and jeans, but hey, at least they put on their dress hoodies (ooh, cashmere!). I think I even remember a guy in a hawaiian shirt and a trucker cap, but he, thankfully, was seated out of the way, near the bathroom. Really, just dig through your closet for something nice. Maybe even iron it. This isn't Papaya Dog. 5 stars to Cafe Boulud and Chef Kaysen for a great meal and 5 stars to my girlfriend for not even making that bad of a face upon eating her first raw oyster, even if she did have to down a glass of champagne and a few slices of bread immediately after.",2,2,2,Andrew M.,"Berkeley, CA",16,90,0

I didn't see a pinot grigio on the wine list, so I asked the waiter for a recommendation and he was spot on with something similar. The amuse bouche was aracini filled with fontina. It was so decadent and definitely got me excited for the meal ahead. We started with the short rib dumplings and the bucatini carbonara. While the dumplings were fabulous, the bucatini carbonara was definitely my favorite. Unfortunately it was a special so I can't rely on being able to have it on my next visit. If any of the managers are reading this please take this as my formal suggestion to ADD THIS TO THE MENU!!For my entree I had the veal milanese served with a deep, rich sauce and creamy polenta, my new favorite side dish. My date ordered the beef bordelaise and from the few tastes I had I could tell it was perfect as well. For dessert we ordered one of the specials which was their take on pumpkin cheesecake, as well as a chocolate cake. Both were presented beautifully and I enjoyed every sinful bite! As if we hadn't eaten enough, we were also presented with a basket of warm madeleines and to describe them as amazing doesn't even come close to doing them justice.

4.0,2/2/2011,"* This is for their Winter 2011 Restaurant Week lunch menu:Upon entry, I noticed that it is one of the fanciest, most upscale eatery I've been too. I was wearing standard office attire, and I felt under-dressed. Although some of the patrons did wear jeans.The second thing I noticed was its impersonal atmosphere. Waiters don't check up on you to see how you are doing, or ask you if you need anything (Nobody requested if I would like soda or if I enjoyed the meal). Maybe it is because there is a different server, waiter, bus boy, drink bringer, order taker, bread giver, tea provider, and water pourer. The dining experience was very impersonal. I guess you don't realize the importance of little things until they're not provided. They constantly survey the area to make sure ur done eating so they can remove your late and immediately serve the next course. Since it was restaurant week, with the service speed, I assume the food was mass produced in the back, waiting to be taken when ordered. I do not like that feeling hen I go out for RW. The food was great though, although the portion sizes were a little smaller than I would have liked. I ordered the white bean soup, beef, and coconut dessert. This was one of my favorite desserts, second to the goat cheesecake at Aquavit. Each dish was above average. The Mrs. ordered the puff pastry, octopus salad, and molten chocolate cake. Everything was good, although we feel the skimped on the size of her dish when compared to the other customers.

They had a few different bread assortments but nothing out of the ordinary- your usual raisin, olive, sourdough etc.The mini rice ball they give you as an amuse bouche is delicious.For appetizer I have pumpkin tortellini with brown butter, sage, almonds, and parmesan. It was a decent dish but I did not really taste much of the pumpkin and wish there was more of a sauce rather than a foam. Still, it was a good way to start off the way.For main course I had rack of lamb and shoulder wrapped in kaitafi with roasted eggplant, grilled haloumi cheese, and vadouvan. This was a truly delicious dish. The lamb chop was perfectly cooked rare and the accompaniments were perfect. The little block of lamb shoulder was encased in crispy katafi and was also terrific. Again, I wish there was a little more sauce but I am splitting hairs. If only this dish was twice as large!The portion sizes are quite small so I was feeling ambitious for dessert. I couldn't decide between the butterscotch gateaux with brown sugar ice cream or the exotic fruit delice with caramelized banana, pineapple, coconut mousse, and passion fruit sorbet. So I went with both. The butterscotch gateaux was the favorite but very very rich. I thought the best thing out of the desserts was the brown sugar ice cream. I could have eaten a tub. They also give you the little madeleines as a treat like at Daniel which is a nice touch.Service was warm and friendly. The only negatives I will say are the following:1. The portion sizes could be bigger for the price.2. The waiter never mentioned a tasting menu, while the website does. I am sure if I asked about it he would have told me about the tasting but it would have been nice if he said it was one of my options.",0,0,0,G C.,"New York, NY",21,264,798

Cafe Boulud is a very beautiful restaurant on the upper east side and you are going to get excellent service . The food was also top notch. The $40 brunch consists two courses. For the first course, we had Tarte Flambee (smoked salmon salad), Fruit parfait, Charcuterie & Bibb Lettuce Salad. Second course, we had Crab Benedict, Lobster scrambled eggs, & Steak and eggs.

The Glazed codfish was the best out of three courses. My friend's Penne Pasta was too al dente, not a good thing!  Everything was in extra  tiny portions but after all its French so what else can you expect. Our entrees took a long time to come and we were not asked too many times how we were doing. Dessert presentation was creative but not great.  As for service, they were not so snobby.

My husband and I were seated awkwardly side by side at a table facing out into the dining room so that we could watch all the other diners and the waiters rushing by.  The service was fine but felt a bit stuffy and insincere and the staff was oddly male-centric.  The food however was the most disappointing.  I ordered some peekytoe crab that was supposed to come with a celery root remoulade.  It turned out to be a roll type presentation that tasted mainly of mayonnaise and nothing of crab or celery root.  My husband had the pumpkin tortellini which we had nothing to complain about.  We also had the special Japanese style black bass dish which was a tiny fillet that was mediocre and slightly fishy tasting.  We did not decide to stay for dessert since our dinner experience had been underwhelming.  All the food we ordered didn't seemed to fall short of the price in either flavor or portion size or both In short, I found this restaurant fell short in flavor, satisfaction, and atmosphere of other similarly priced places I've been.  I felt it was trying to portray an image of prestige that perhaps was muddling the focus on the food.  I don't ever regret the tab at an expensive restaurant that delivers sincere service and creative, flavorful meals, but wish I had saved the money we spent last night for the new shoes I need for work.",1,0,0,Rachel N.,"Madison, WI",13,7,0

Despite being located ridiculously far from the restaurant proper, the service was still very attentive. The bread guy came around multiple times with this delicious raisin nut bread and the butter was really good to boot.However, the food itself was not the best we've had. Good but not blow your mind great. Nothing stood out in particular about the broccoli veloute or the duck confit spring roll. The mussels were fresh and soft, but otherwise tasted like mussels (though the fries that came with it were very tasty). Weiner schnitzel wasn't very flavorful and a tad dry. They screwed up our dessert order, so we ended up with two strawberry shortcakes and a hazelnut dacquoise, but again, nothing was amazing. They topped the meal off with some complimentary madeleines, and good thing, too, since the portions had been even smaller than usual fine dining.All in all, a good experience, but we left underwhelmed by the food itself.",1,0,1,Ye L.,"Riverside, CA",26,145,125

And then there are restaurants that take high grade ingredients, classic technique, and turn it into deceptively simple, beautiful dishes.Cafe Boulud is the latter. I went for a late lunch with new friends who swear by this place, and it did not disappoint. From the amuse to the fresh-out-of-the-oven madeleines, the food was fresh, delicious, expertly prepared, and had that understated elegance that - to me - always signals that the kitchen is confident in their menu execution and quality of their ingredients.The pacing of the meal was spot on, and while we were one of the last lunch parties, we never felt rushed out of the dining room. We all chose items from their prix fixe lunch, which is a very good value for the money. Our amuse bouche was a small aracini, flavored with, I think, fennel (apparently they do these aracini often, but not always with the same flavors). My salad course was a grilled wedge of radicchio with watercress, mushrooms, and a blue cheese vinaigrette - a perfect balance of bitter, salty, and tart. The entree was a house-made penne with arugula and walnut pesto with burrata cheese. It quite simple, but excellent. Dessert was a raspberry linzer, and was accompanied by Hojicha tea ice cream that was so good I wanted a whole bowl of it. And with our desserts, the waiter also brought out a pile of wee, freshly baked (and still hot!) madeleines - they were little, buttery, lemony bites of pure heaven.Service was impeccable, everyone was friendly and attentive, without hovering or being over-familiar.

I just really loved the pommes puree and the hon shemji mushrooms together (it's like a delicious rich man's mashed potatoes).*Lamb navarin: The lamb was super tender; it's boneless, and you don't even need a knife to eat it. The sauce is rich and smoky.desserts:*Chocolate pot de creme: My picture explains it all. They use a pretty strong/dark cocoa blend. The milk jam mousse was the highlight. *Cranberry claufoutis: Actually really good. It's a cheesecake sprinkled with pecans. Not too sweet. The white chocolate ice cream was ok.I kind of felt out of place because the average age of clientele was either 40's, or 60's. I will say it's a good place to bring your parents.

The halibut was perfectly cooked and accompanied wonderfully.It will help your dining experience here immensely if you dress for it.  This isn't one of those crappy, overpriced East Village places where they upsell the wine and burn the duck.  This is upper east side post-modern elegance, and that means that men should wear jackets and women should wear.. well, whatever the equivalent is.  I'd say ""dresses"", but I saw a couple of very nice pant-suits the other night.It does make a difference.  The wait staff will be more attentive and your experience will be much more positive, so lose the california ""we're all so contrivedly casual"" attitude and suck it up and put the damn jacket on.  The best foie gras next to WD-50 awaits.",1,2,0,Yttrx S.,"New York, NY",1,29,0

4.0,12/9/2009,"Cafe Boulud is an excellent respite from the raft of mediocre NYC restaurants who use exorbitant pricing, trendy styling and location,  and arrogant staff as a way to mask their shortcomings.A restaurant should be measured on what I call the SAFE metrics: Service, Ambiance, Food, and Extras, and Boulud consistently delivers handily on all counts. From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave the service is exquisitely smooth, with a relaxed air of old world courtesy. Every staff member is extremely friendly, helpful, and sophisticated without being the least bit pretentious or patronizing. The service alone is worth the visit.Though a tad noisy during dinner hour, its amazing how an simple, open, rectangular seating space can be made to be so inviting and pleasant. The completely voluntary ""dress code"" rounds out the ambiance by lending an air of relaxed sophistication to the mix.Food prep, presentation, and quality are excellent, from the apps, soups and salad, to the vegetables, meats, and fish, to the exquisite deserts.  Portion sizes may seem small at first, but by the time you have an app, maybe a soup, main, and desert, you will feel sated. Pricing is a bit high, but you certainly get what you pay for.Extras: Nice touches like a knowledgeable sommelier, the amazing flower arrangements, and the amazing bread and perfectly tempered butter add a nice touch to a wonderful dining experience.",1,0,0,avi w.,"New York, NY",2,25,2

SF standards, not Manhattan standards.  Don't get me wrong, we looked great, just not ""night at the opera"" like almost everyone else.  Needless to say we were seated in the back row of the restaurant with the rest of the no-names celebrating birthdays and anniversaries.  No surprise considering the rest of the clientele - Eric Ripert was there, Alfred Portale was there, and some vaguely familiar looking political-types.  It's that kind of place.The food was impeccable, the highlights being my husband's beef duo (paired with a cauliflower gratin to perfectly balance the richness of the beef) and a hazelnut chocolate dessert.  Every plate was a work of art, both visually and flavor-wise.  And the service as you would expect.  It would have been a 5-star experience except for the clear and physical client class separation, and the fact that our waiter never brought around the mini-madeleines that every other table was served after their dessert.  Was it because I was wearing slacks instead of a designer cocktail dress?",5,4,1,Alice C.,"Menlo Park, CA",47,78,10

4.0,11/12/2009,"Had a wonderful dinner here once more before heading to the Metropolitan Opera. The staff was more than helpful in making this a speed round of dinner since we could not be late! They made recommendations, advised which dishes would come out faster and in the end we even had time for dessert. Cafe Boulud is a wonderfully pleasant place. Calm atmosphere, fantastic food, impossible to go wrong especially given the diversity of the menu. Catching up with a friend? Perfect place. Or special occasion dinner with special someone? They'll certainly be impressed! The amuse of arancini- or risotto fritter ball thingys are so amazingly delicious, warm, inviting and utterly comforting it sets the mood for the rest of the meal perfectly. I only wish they would give me a huge basket of them instead of just one little arancini per person. My appetizer was from the 'Asian Inspired' column: Braised Short Rib Japanese Dumplings spiced orange-soy reduction, scallions daikon radish The dumpling was so meaty and rich, and was presented in one of those round bamboo steamers and I even got to use chopsticks! So delicious. My main entree was also filling but was light and absolutely perfect: Butter Poached Dover Sole scallop & fines herbs mousse sunchoke purée citrus braised endive, sauce americaine Who knew something as plain as a white fish could be so strong in flavor, I definitely wiped this dish clean, everything about it went together in perfect cohesiveness. It was beautifully plated as well. I also had the opportunity to steal a couple of bites from my Dad's appetizer and entree: 1. Maine Peekytoe Crab - green apple gelée, celery root rémoulade whole grain mustard 2. Tasting of Pennsylvania Veal - braised cheek, seared loin, roasted salsify smoked sweet potato, brussels sprouts mustard fruit jus The crab app was refreshing, served cold as a type of salad and was absolutely filled with flavor. His veal was wonderfully cooked and seasoned. My dessert was a perfect ending, difficult to go wrong with a molten chocolate cake and it definitely did not disappoint in the richness department. Molten Chocolate Cake tahitian vanilla ice cream My Dad's dessert was also delicious and must have been made for him as he is the biggest apple pie fan of any kind, and this delicate, upscale version did not disappoint! Apple Tart Tatin - diplomat cream, confiture de lait pecan-bourbon ice cream I really wish I could eat here more often.

I loved the flavoring on the cod; it was so smooth. The potatoes were also great, but the greens were a little tough and more bland than the rest of the dish. Dessert was great: pistachio frasier and black forest had such wonderful tastes - not too sweet and the best presentation by far. The ambiance might have been a little different than usual because it was Restaurant Week, but my biggest complaint is that the space is lit rather darkly.

5.0,7/16/2009,".Tuesday PM Lunch - Restaurant Week.Taste ***** To start, I had the carrot and ginger soup with a touch of tarragon oil. I opted for the uncommon and was so glad I did. The texture, while appearing to be thick and creamy was very light and refreshing on the palate. Absolute delight. For the main entree, the pan seared cod was cooked to perfection and quality was not even a question. This is probably rare form that I thoroughly enjoyed the skin... I usually don't touch it. Combined with the potatoes and greens, complemented a nice balance of sweet, salty, bitter and crunch. How often do you get this combination?! Last but not least, had the pistachio cake with strawberry sorbet for dessert. I like strawberries, but did not expect that I'd like the sorbet. The cake, while moist abd light was delicately paired with pistachio and strawberries on top. Eating the sorbet with the cake made for a very sweet and tart.. completing and ending the meal perfectly.  All three entrees presented were near impeccable. Ambiance *** Almost too classic and antiquated in decor. Where humble meets a touch of swank, but barely scratches the surface. Put it this way, my grandparents would love this place and they'd fit right in! However, I would never call this fine dining establishment stuffy by any means!!Service **** Par. Let's face it.. Dinner service would nearly be 2 hours. Lunch service was an hour and 15 minutes in change. I was in no rush, but the time it took from appetizer to main entree was a little bit of a wait.Dislikes - The muted colors. It's a very sophisticated blah for me.  Also, not a big fan of restaurant week...the menu is usually limited and to succinctly put it..full of crap.Likes - The fact that the food was so damn delicious, it overrides the ambiance and service combined.  Proportionally full with a cup of coffee to digest afterward, I left utterly content.",3,0,3,Brittany H.,"Santa Monica, CA",1048,638,254

You get 2-3 options per course.The lunch menu changes weekly though so that can make a big difference as nothing on the menu jumped out at me but the one i saw when making the reservation sounded great.The amuse bouche was a risotto ball and then I started with the asparagus tart with fried quail egg. Tart is a bit of a misnomer cause it was more like asparagus on toast or something. It was good but very unimpressive. Apparently the veloute was really good, seems like you cant go wrong with their soups.My entree, the duck confit was a decent portion of tender duck. I found it a little too salty with not enough other flavor but overall it was well made. It sat on a bed of grains - I can't remember what anymore, possibly barley, because it was so bland and unmemorable. They really could have added a little visual appeal to the brown and off white, even chopped parsley. For dessert I had the mint vacherin, a somewhat deconstructed dish that had chocolate, mint ice cream-like block, vanilla ice cream, and a bite of chocolate cake. Again not bad but nothing I'd ever order again. Afterwards they gave us a basket of mini madelines. They were good but I am not a fan of lemon desserts and it tasted like there was a hint of lemon zest.Service was fine, not warm but no complaints.

Not that either would make a huge difference since the entree portions were meager at best, but still, he was a big eater. He tried to get his extra piece but to no avail.

Dude, my parents are from California, they had to buy coats to come visit me...coat checks are not a part of their life.

They struggled to find something nice to say about it, they finally decide it was ""good"" but they could have made it at home (for like 1/10 of the price).I am embarrassed to have I had dragged my folks here; they are still making jokes about how apparently we don't know how to fold a napkin. Café Boulud might be a logical place to take your purple-haired dapper grandparents if your trying to butter them up to leave you a trust fund... but even my grandparents are too cool for this place.* I know many other restaurants fold your napkin when you get up but at least they wait till you are out of site - they don't run over and swipe your crumpled napkin like it is an insult.",4,6,4,Kelly B.,"San Diego, CA",233,403,830

5.0,1/25/2009,"from my post alexeatsworld.comCafé Boulud: the definition of a 5 star dining experience. Beautiful space, seamless service, enticing atmosphere, impeccable attention to detail, and delectable food.House Cured SalmonTake all your pre-existing memories of cured salmon and flush it down the toilet. Cured salmon / lox dishes have a tendency to be stringy and really salty. These however are thick, sashimi grade slices of salmon. They really just melt in your mouth and have a lingering sweet taste. Simply divine.Winter Squash VelouteThick pureed soup bursting with delicate flavors. I couldn't put the spoon down. This is probably the best soup I've ever had.Ricotta & Spinach Raviolo with chicken egg yolk and wild mushroom fricasseePlated to perfection, this is definitely eye-candy. A very light and refreshing dish with long lasting flavors that seem to dance forever on your taste buds. The egg was slightly overcooked however, sadly failing to spill its golden yolk over the raviolo.Braised Veal CheeksFor those readers who haven't discovered the magic of cheek meat, you're missing out big time. Always the most tender and prized piece of meat in any animal. There's fall off the bone tender then there's Café Boulud's veal cheek's tender. I couldn't have said it better than Leith Steel from Metro: ""Cooked long and slow, the muscles of the meat break down and become even more tender until they are edible with a spoon. The collagen embedded within the muscles turns to gelatin, cloaking the meat in a full-bodied beefy glaze.""

So on this recent visit, she secured a reservation for Cafe Boulud for us. We got a little dressed up and headed uptown to this elegant little restaurant. The crowd was mostly a little older than places we typically go, but everyone was well dressed, so that was fun. In the corner booth, there was a younger couple who got engaged while we were there, so that was exciting!I liked how the menu was broken down: Traditional/Classic, World Cuisine, Seasonal and Market Inspired. I started with the Market Inspired roasted beet and endive salad, which was light, refreshing and well balanced with pears and candied walnuts. I'm a huge fan of beets, so this was calling out to me. My friend had the decadent wild mushroom soup from the classic corner of the menu. There were tasty little duck raviolini in the rich creamy broth. We both enjoyed our appetizers (and sharing!).For entrees, I chose the seared wild striped bass from the seasonal menu, which was perfectly prepared, if not a little unmemorable. I can't remember what my friend had, but I tasted it and I remember it was good. But I guess our entrees didn't knock our socks off if we don't remember much about them. Hmm.For dessert we shared a pear and cranberry clafoutis from the market inspired menu, plus they brought hot, fresh mini madeleines. Yummy little nibbles with coffee. Service was well executed, bread came around regular in a basket of 4 choices, water was refilled without having to ask, and food was delivered and plates cleared without incident.

Check.4.5 Stars on Yelp!  Big smile.Glowing reviews.I've already decided what I was gonna order:  Foie Gras, Duck Breast and poached figs.Finding street parking on Madison Ave. at this time of the night was quite easy.First thing that I noticed was that most of the patrons seemed very dressy, I mean we are on the Upper Eastside, except for me, business casual, straight from work.  Are my greenbacks just as good as theirs Monsieur?  Oui Monsieur!  Entrez s'il vous plait monsieur!Everyone in our group arrived pretty much on time which is always a good thing.  I must point out that the service was excellent, especially when they served the dishes.  It was like synchronized swimming at the Olympics.Appetizer:Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras - gingerbread crisp, quince chutney hazelnuts, black pepper duck jus ($28)Wow!  So buttery, silky, smooth yet flavorful.  A little piece of heaven.  I could've just easily have ordered 2 of these and stuffed my face with their awesome selection of breads and called it a night.  Then again I am a lover of Foie Gras, Uni, O-Toro, Kobe...so texture is very important.Appetizer Nibble: (Courtesy of Aubrey M.)Hand Rolled Penne Pasta - lamb merguez meatballs, swiss chardred pearl onions, sheep's milk ricottaOne word.  Wow!Entree:Seared Muscovy Duck Breast - pomegranate glaze, creamy farrowilted arugula, natural jus (Medium temperature) ($36)This is the best Duck dish I have had to date!  How could duck breast be this tender, juicy and flavorful?  How?  With the skin nice and crispy. Tears start to form.  How can I make this moment last?  I definitely have to come back for a redux of this dish.  The risotto on which the duck breast rested was oh so good!Entree Nibble: (Courtesy of Aubrey M.)Milk Fed Veal Loin - ""ris de veau en cocotte"", celery root, creamy polenta, whole grain mustard jusSo tender and delicious.  Another dish definitely worth considering.Dessert:Poached Figs- black currant marmalade, lemon mousse, fromage blanc sorbet ($14)Flavor explosions!  The white cheese sorbet was surprisingly good as it just had slight hints of cheese.  The figs were sweet and tangy.  Just a good mixture of flavors.The only incident which ruffled my feathers a bit was the fact that I was recommended a glass of sweet white wine (don't remember the name as this ain't up my alley baby) to pair with my Foie Gras which I agreed to which turned out to be $26/glass!  Damn that is almost another of order of Foie Gras!  My fault, I should've inquired about the price and not assumed.  Still a great meal!Definitely will be back!Highly recommended!  Easily one of my top 3 favorite restaurants.

5.0,10/8/2008,"Originally, I was going to give Cafe Boulud a 4 star rating because I wanted to differentiate Cafe Boulud from its flagship counterpart at Daniel, but I couldn't betray my heart, and gave Cafe Boulud the rating it deserved!My visit to Cafe Boulud actually materialized completely out of the blue. I received an email from Zagat one Tuesday morning in February, promoting a ""Zagat-Presents"" event at Cafe Boulud, with new executive chef Gavin Kaysen (from New Iron Chef fame) showing off his new dishes, along with a brief meet and greet amongst the diners. The special menu for the evening was a four course meal for the price of a three course prix-fixe, so I figured ""f**k it, let's do it"". I called the restaurant, made reservations for two at 9pm (their last available time slot) and was excited to once again visit a Daniel Boulud establishment. Although we weren't able to meet Mr. Kaysen (I suppose he was there to meet and greet the 7pm crowd hehe), I must say I was extremely impressed with his selection.For my opening course, I had the kampachi sashimi, which was accompanied by a ponzu sauce and a butternut squash puree, producing delectable bites of sashimi considering the seemingly contrasting ingredients.For my second course, I had the pork and black truffle sausage on a buttermilk biscuit, which rested on a cream of spinach. On top of the pork and sausage was a poached quail egg. If this isn't the ultimate definition of comfort food, I don't know what is! I slowly ran my knife through each layer, catching the piece I carved out with my fork, and that sensation I experienced once it entered my mouth was so.... scrumptious! I could have died right there, 100% content with my life.For my main course, I had the braised short rib, accompanied by a celery puree, baby carrots, and green beens. The meat off the ribs were so delicate, I swear they melted in my mouth. The vegetable accompaniments complimented the short rib perfectly and the sauce was great!For dessert, I had an almond and tea wafer with a sorbet on the side and chocolate on top. It was heavenly to say the least and it was an end to a perfect dining experience.The service was top notch, expected at a Daniel Boulud restaurant. Considering we were probably the youngest diners at Cafe Boulud that evening, with a majority of the patrons middle-aged and, quite frankly, rich lol, the staff at Cafe Boulud however didn't treat us differently, so that was very appreciated.Overall, this less formal (and hey, less expensive hehe) counterpart to Daniel still produced a perfect dining experience for myself. I can't wait for the opportunity to go back and if you're looking to celebrate a special event or hey, if you just want to go spoil yourself on a random Tuesday night, you won't be disappointed if you choose Cafe Boulud!P.S. - Although I've seen nicer decor from other restaurants, I hear Cafe Boulud is going through interior renovations this past summer, so that's even more of a reason for me to go back soon!",2,0,1,Gary R.,"New York, NY",34,38,2
2.0,10/3/2008,"I ate Andrew Carmellini's food at Cafe Boulud over a number of years.  But now we have Gavin Kaysen, who seems to have stepped up to the executive chef position here from an internship at Daniel - he'd previously headed the kitchen at San Diego golf resort.The menu maintains its four panels: traditional French cuisine, world cuisine, market cuisine, and something roughly resembling vegetarian choices.  Indeed, little seems to have changed since the Carmellini heyday except - on this occasion - an absence of charcuterie.  Not being a slavish fan os salads, or much of a soup dragon, I actually struggled to find an appealing appetizer.  Raw kampachi is on every menu in town, but I'd rather eat it in a sushi restaurant.  I ordered a corn velouté, which was at least seasonal, and a creamy corn soup is just what it was.Similarly, seared foie with a sweet dressing, once a special occasion dish, is something any fancy hotel kitchen now sends automatically.  Nothing wrong with the rendition here, although - with a honey-peach sauce and pain perdu the dish tipped heavily in the sweet direction.  Our server suggested a glass of Sauternes; we backed nervously toward a Monbazillac.  It certainly matched the dish, increasing my sense that it was, in fact, dessert.I have a longstanding prejudice against dishes centered around a rectangle of white fish - so I didn't order it.  I did taste it, however.  The halibut was steamed.  I look for something crispy in the surface of a fish, but obviously one would look in vain here.  It was delicate, a bit woolly - I thought; a bit overcooked - I thought.  Some mushrooms, a pea-based smear of sauce, I think.  But the dish was never aimed at me.I chose the lamb pie from the summer-seasonal menu.  Lamb loin en croute, I should say.   It arrived with a tasty bean cassoulet in a separate pot.  The lamb was served in a crispy pastry wrapper, with some greens - spinach, I think - and a mushroom duxelle.Pleasant it was, but déjà vu:  how similar in conception and appearance to Gabriel Kreuther's signature squab-foie en croute introduced at Atelier and now served at The Modern.  Not that Kreuther invented this kind of layered meat pastry - but it's less than a revelation in Kaysen's hands.  I went back to corn for dessert, a cold cornbread stuffed with milk chocolate mousse, and a corn ice cream.That was fine, as was the pain de gênes with an amaretto ice cream.  I was also hugely pleased to find, on the high-priced wine list, the rich, funky red from Mas Cal Demoura - garnacha- based, stinky, smooth, and at $75 altogether more fun than some three-figure bottles from the cellar.I have the fondest memories of this restaurant, and I don't willingly play the Jeremiah - I do seek to have a great meal when I'm dropping two or three hundred dollars.  And this wasn't bad.  What I failed to see were the fireworks diners are entitled to expect in this bracket - and which some recent fawning press claimed to perceive.",1,1,0,Wilfrid D.,"New York, NY",7,47,0

Food was great of course, and it should be for the price. Yep, it's definitely pricey, but it was a special occasion. We had an early reservation due to later plans, so we had a great table for four just for us. Started with an appetizer ravioli which was good, but it's not hard to make decent pasta. BF had meaty paste thing with a French name that the contestants on Top Chef are always making and for some stupid reason I can't remember the name of. But I tried it. It was not quite the kind of thing a California Vegetarian (chicken only!) eats, but I gave it a whirl. Not quite up my alley (more like in the next state), but he loved it. Duh- just remembered- Fois Gras.And then I ate fish. I don't eat fish, but it ate it there. Parmesan crusted cod- mmmmmmmmm. I've heard that fresh fish doesn't taste like fish. Well I couldn't detect a hint of seafood in this, so I'm thinking they caught it just for me. Really a great dish.

We eat out usually 10-12 times per week. We like to explore new places. We equally like ""cheap"" tiny restaurant and expensive fancy ones. The only thing what counts for us is the taste of the food, the service and the atmosphere. I'm not native English, so sorry for my grammar. We went to this place for lunch on a Saturday. On thing we have noticed right away that this place is not our age group. We are in our 30s, but the restaurant more seemed like a place for elderly people. So we felt a bit as outsiders with our age group. Due to the older crowd, the place was not noise, which is good. The staff is well-trained and kind. A nuance might be that we had to wait a little bit before they made our drinks order. But generally for the staff I would give 5 stars. We get a complimentary something as a starter bite, but it was horrible. I took a salmon appetizer, my wife something liver. Both was good. For first course I took a steak, which I liked a lot. The food in general was good, tasty, but nothing extraordinary. Don't expect your mouth to have a flavor explosion. I have paid something like 140 or 160 bucks with tips. As I'm not being an American I have appreciated the size of the dishes. It's just correct size, something you only get in a French restaurant or in Europe. You have to eat full menu to feel okay. With all this said this place won't cause you extra calories for sure. If you are a lover of big American size meals, this is not your place.

Awesome variety.We both had this:A tray of 4 teeny tiny single bites each of - Guinea Hen Terrine, Oyster, Yellowfin Tuna Tartare w/Olives, Fried Risotto Ball with CheeseThen came the goods:** Peekytoe Crab Salad ** Sashimi of Kampachi (Daikon Radish, Fried Garlic Butternut Squash Puree, Ponzu) **  Warm Cauliflower Veloute (Shrimp, Brussel Sprouts) ** Broccoli Veloute ** Marinated Lobster with Gnocchi ** Wild Mushroom Ravioli (Chive Batons, Parmesan Froth) ** Steamed Black Sea Bass ** Roasted Monkfish **Roasted & Glazed Duck Breast ** Duo of Beef Quite a few of the dishes were a hit or a miss. HITS: The few dishes we really liked are the Kanpachi (which you could probably get at any other Japanese restaurant) and the Cauliflower Veloute.  MISS: The oyster was fishy and the peekytoe crab salad (EC thought it tasted like it had soap) and both the fish dishes seemed overdone.

5.0,3/2/2008,"I had dinner here with my family recently while my parents were in town and staying at the Surrey Hotel. It was definitely one of the best meals I've had in a long time, and when combined with the exquisite service I really couldn't have been happier.I had the crab salad appetizer which was delicious, but my duck entree made the night for me. I tried it on a whim, really. While I like duck I wouldn't say I love it, so I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I was taken aback at how good it was. The flavor was intense but not overwhelming, and the texture of the meat was absolutely perfect. And for dessert I had the mimosa sorbet which was just as light and refreshing as I'd hoped. The fresh madelines were a lovely surprise, and even the coffee exceeded my high expectations.Given the location and atmosphere I wouldn't have been surprised if the service had been somewhat stuffy, but in reality it couldn't have been better.

I've been told that this is a new dish from their new executive chef, Gavin Kaysen.  This was excellent, and the ""ultimate pot roast"" as I like to call it, was divine.  Both of the soups we tried, the Jerusalem artichoke soup, and the butternut squash soup were excellent.  The sous vide duck on farro was also excellent, with perfectly cooked duck, and the farro had just a hint of flavor best described as the flavor of the best barley soup you've ever had, but with a firm texture.  The meal was finished with a small dish of petit fours, which were all delicious, and a small basket of madelines.  The madelines were possibly the best dessert I had during my stay in NYC.",1,0,1,Erin O.,"San Jose, CA",264,411,80
4.0,12/4/2007,"""Caf Boulud pays homage to the food chef-owner Daniel Boulud grew up with in France and celebrates the food he loves in America. Caf Boulud's dynamic menu, created by Daniel Boulud, Chef de Cuisine Bertrand Chemel, and Pastry Chef Eric Bertoa, is divided among four headings that reflect Daniel's four culinary muses: La Tradition, the classic dishes of French cooking; La Saison, the seasonal specialties of the market; Le Potager, a celebration of the vegetable garden; and Le Voyage, the exotic flavors of world cuisines.""V's family was in town and specially selected Caf Boulud for dinner after drinks at the Carlyle Hotel's Bemelmans Bar. (I was lucky the reservation was for after my class, though the restaurant was busy when we arrived, and we weren't seated until 30 minutes past our reservation.) The restaurant has an understated elegance, that in my mind was meant to put the focus of the experience on the food, not the room just as is noted on the restaurant website:""The dining room's rich, wood paneled surfaces and plush upholstery in muted neutral tones pay homage to the elegant modernism of a 1930's Parisian rendez-vous, creating a sleek backdrop for the palate of flavors on Caf Boulud's eclectic menu. ... The space is decorated in subdued earth tones: banquettes in shades of cocoa, walls upholstered in sandy hues, ivory colored curtains, and custom wool carpeting inspired by traditional Tibetan design woven in shades of hazelnut, sage and caramel.""The menu's four different headings, plus an addendum of market specials were all so tempting it took us quite a while to each decide on what to order. There were two preparations of foie gras, lots of mushroom dishes, and plenty of seafood among just the appetizers! I ended up ordering the Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras, from under the ""La Tradition"" heading. It was served with homemade ginger bread, roasted pear and Swiss chard. The presentation was beautiful, with the pieces of the dish stacked atop one another. The pear went well with the fattiness of the foie gras, which had a bit of a crispiness from the sear. For something I sample so rarely, this was a great execution.The main courses were equally difficult to choose from: bacon wrapped veal tenderloin, roasted venison, rabbit ""schnitzel,"" roasted glazed duck breast, a beef duo with short ribs and aged strip loin, plus sole, halibut and pastas. Each of the preparations was unique and fit within its respective heading.I opted for the roasted and glazed duck breast, from under the seasonal heading. This too was served with chard as a greenery, oyster mushrooms and farro, which was kind of like a rice though it is a form of wheat. The duck was very tasty and tender. The glazed had a nice sweetness that wasn't to strong, it was nice to get a little in each bite. I also tried V's bacon wrapped veal tenderloin, which was served with polenta. ""It was quite delicious,"" she commented. ""the flavors were distinct in that the bacon didn't overwhelm the veal."" I agree, though I actually thought the bacon could have been a little stronger in flavor. We both thought there could have been more polenta as it was just a small dollop under the veal.I only got a bit or two of the Beef Duo, which V's mom ordered, but it was definitely an amazing dish. The braised short ribs were tender and so flavorful that even the small bite I tried filled my mouth with great, slightly salty, tastes. The strip loin was equally (but differently) flavorful--these flavors are hard to describe but both emphasized the meat's flavor rather than masking it with strong sauces or marinades.To add to our dinner, the service at Caf Boulud is almost too good. With several people serving us there was a little confusion about drink orders at one point, but otherwise the service was spot on. Our server was very attentive through the meal and the sommelier(s) recommended some great wines. When each course was served, a team of servers surrounded our table and on cue all of our plates were placed at once--it made for a nice effect.Caf Boulud is an excellent restaurant. The food and the service are top notch. The formal but calm atmosphere leads to a more mature (less trendy) crowd that befits the restaurant and Chef Boulud's intention of a Parisian rendez-vous.

The roasted duck breast sauce was sweet and the meat was perfectly cookedDessertMolten Chocolate Cake - Well done, but unimaginative. You could get this at any bakeryPlum Souffle with Pear Sorbet - It seemed as though you were eating an actual pear! The souffle was light and airy. Plum seemed kind of insignificant. Maybe I just don't get the nuanced flavor...Banana Caramel Cremeux - The best dessert of the night - intense banana flavor with crunchy crust on the bottom.  The end of the meal, we were presented with madeleines.  I think they were freshly made, as they were quite warm and delicious!  It had a lovely touch of lemon and melt in your mouth texture.  MmmmUgh I have to hit the gym.",4,0,3,Scuba K.,"Amityville, NY",12,209,1
5.0,8/31/2007,"Hurry up and head to Cafe Boulud for it's restaurant week lunch, which is 24.95 per person. The three courses consist of an appetizer, entree and dessert. I had the Fluke Tartare (on top of yummy chopped mango), Garganelle with clams, and the Bittersweet Chocolate Flan with coffee ice cream. The appetizer and entree were the highlights, as the seafood was so fresh. The pasta melted in my mouth. This was my second time at Cafe Boulud and I must say the service is outstanding. Quick tip: This time, I ordered my coffee immediately upon sitting down, as opposed to waiting until after the entree. They kept on refilling my cup with delicious decaf and I was only charged for one cup. Truly satisfying.

3.0,7/26/2007,"Overall, I was kiind of disappointed with the place. Ambience: The decor itself was very elegant, but the atmosphere was a bit more stuffy than i expected considering how the word ""casual"" has been included in many of the restaurant's review. The patrons of the restaurant were also alot older than I expected especially for a 9 o'clock reservation. Most people were in their 50s with a handful of 20s and 50+.Food: The food was good, not great. Again, I expected more. First the amuse bouch, a cubed salmon sashimi with a white sauce (don't remember what). I remember it being not special, sauce didnt' do much as I think the chef wanted to accentuate and not cover the flavor of salmon, but the salmon itself was also lacking in flavor. I got the Fois Gras torchon as the appetizer. It was classic and clean, like it should be. I appreciated the generous shavings of black truffles. But the service for my toast was a little out of place. They carried a single piece of toast separately on a plate, enveloped in a white napkin. I understand that it h.elps keep the toast warm but, again, being a cafe, not necessary For my entree I had the Berkshire Pork loin w/ grilled shallot vinaigrette and zucchini crunchy vegetable salad. The pork was cooked nicely, peferctly medium and juicy. The crunchy vegetable salad wasn't really crunchy, more al dente if you will. And the vinaigrette might as well as been just shallot vinaigrette because I don't think the grilled part many any difference. But overall, tasty dish. The dessert was actually really dissappointing. I had the chocolate napolean with fresh raspberries and raspberry oreo sorbet. The dish itself was really pretty, but it tasted way too tart. The raspberry maybe should have been tossed in a simple syrup to cut the tartness. The sorbet was also so tart that you could not taste oreos whatsoever. It came out to around 80 per and for that kind of money, I can't reccommend this place with the food that they served. Maybe other items on the menu were executed better, but who knows.",0,0,0,Jack L.,"New York, NY",116,112,0

4.0,3/24/2007,"this place has a great and reasonable set lunch for about $30 for 2 course meal.  It is probably better then ordering a la carte.  Their lobster bisque was quite impressive but wished there was a little more for the price that was being paid.  They also had a really good duck for lunch.  If you like bass, their striped bass was very tasty.  It's not the typical thin piece but rather like a thick piece and very buttery.  As for service....I thinbk they probably need a better trained manager.  At all the best restaurants (esp for a Daniel B's restaurant) you would think service was better....for example, when they served the chef's complimentary appetizer...you would think they could put it on individual dishes and place them in front of you...but instead they put how every many people's portion on ONE dish...and also when the dishes come, all the TOP restaurants would tell you what you have ordered, but instead they just put it in front of you and then left...so if it wasn't for the food, I wouldve given them only 3 stars....oh....don't forget to try one of the breads that has real butter inside...that was quite unusual.....",1,0,2,Mee-stique K.,"San Francisco, CA",69,453,0

5.0,1/21/2007,"I've only eaten here once, but it was for the best lunch I've ever had, bar none. I showed up at this Upper East Side paradisio for lunch, and not hungry at all after already indulging in a large continental breakfast that morning. So, I decided to just order two appetizers to give this much heralded place a try and enjoy a beautiful October day outside.Well, the goat cheese risotto with heirloom tomatoes and baby basil and veal sweetbreads (not to mention the lovely salmon tartar amuse) were so delicious that I just had to try more. Next came the seafood pasta in a pink sauce. Then, the duck entree. At this point, I was running out of time before I had to leave for the airport, so told the waiter to just bring me out their best dessert as he gaped in awe of my seemingly bottomless stomach. His pick did not disappoint as the pear suzette was fantastic; and I generally don't even like pears! Then, just as I thought I could gorge no longer, they brought out 12 homemade doughnuts and 6 delicious homemade candies. Wow, just wow.As indulgent as the food was, the wine and service were just as outstanding. I tried several wines by the glass, and all were excellent. A crisp, clean Alsatian Pinot Blanc, a rich and complex White Burgundy, and a perfectly balanced Volnay were all heavenly. And, all were served with perfect attention to detail of wine service in the French style. For each wine, I was first brought a crystal stem, appropriate for each varietal. Then, the server brought each bottle, presented it to me to verify the producer and vintage, then I was poured a tasting pour, followed by a generous pour once any doubt of corkage was removed. My server generously refilled each of the three wines complimentarily and repeatedly, making their 13-17 dollar a glass prices a very good value, especially for the excellent quality. He even comped a glass of Sauternes before I could order it to pair with dessert. Every single element of this meal was so over-the-top and perfect, that Cafe Boulud will be a permanent fixture on every future NYC itinerary of mine.",2,0,3,James K.,"Chicago, IL",55,94,2
