5.0,4/3/2019,"My girlfriends and I had an incredible night at Kellari. From the amazing wine selection to mouth watering Greek dishes, we had a blast. We shared a bunch of dishes and would highly recommend the vegetable croquettes and halibut. Also, be sure to save room for dessert! The service was just as good as the food. Our waiter was very attentive and we never had to worry about an empty wine glass. I'd highly recommend Kellari for any occasion.

1.0,4/3/2019,"If you are worried about choking on fish bones, or being treated civilly, I would not recommend dining at Kellari restaurant. I was having a pre-theater dinner at Kellari back in February when I took a bite of my fish and found a bone.  I removed it, and went on eating when I got another bone that got stuck in my throat.  I tried to remove it but it would not come out.  I alerted the hostess who advised me to go to the urgent care center or the emergency room right away.   She said several times that Kellari would reimburse me for my medical costs.  I spent the next several hours in urgent care, then the ER and finally the next day at a specialist's office where he had to scope a tube up through my nose and down my throat, not a very pleasant experience believe me. Plus, my friend and I missed the theater performance of True West we were so looking forward to seeing that evening. I brought my medical receipts and reports back to Kellari the next day.  I was made to wait for quite awhile and when the manager finally appeared he was quite rude.  He took my papers and said someone would get back to me. There was no apology or inquiry into how I was doing. I was just abruptly dismissed.It has now been over 5 weeks since the incident and not only has no one ever contacted me, but managers refuse to speak with me when I call, and no one returns my phone calls nor my emails. I am treated with contempt by anyone I speak to.  On my last call the restaurant rep said in a snotty tone, ""why don't you just have your lawyer call our lawyer?"" I responded that I wasn't planning to sue them - I only want to be reimbursed for my expenses as promised -  but that if they wanted me to sue them then I guess I would.  I asked for the name of the attorney  and was then put on permanent hold.  The people at Kellari are reprehensible. It is incomprehensible to me that I am being treated as if I am just some nuisance. I went to their restaurant as a customer with the reasonable expectation that I would not be harmed by eating there. I then spent the next 18 hours dealing with an issue that was caused by their employee's negligence.  I was very polite about it that evening and in subsequent dealings in the beginning but I now feel I need to warn everyone about this restaurant and what can happen to you - and how they treat people they have harmed.

5.0,4/2/2019,"The dinner, the atmosphere, the service, the location -- Everything was a 20 out of 10!! The octopus and grilled calamari were exceptional and the feta and juicy tomatoes in the Greek salad were so superb. The chef even sent over some moussaka pastry balls that were out of this world! Great spot to hit pre or post theater and the wine list was extensive as well. Make sure you get their loose leaf tea and a scoop of dulce de leche gelato for dessert! I cannot wait to go back again.

5.0,4/2/2019,"Let me start by saying the seafood is always fresh and there's always wonderful options based on the current season. During my most recent visit (with my husband) we dined for dinner and started with five jumbo shrimp. These are the large, jumbo size which were nothing but fresh and delicious. I ordered the char grilled Faroe Island Salmon which was excellent. The grilled salmon was the perfect combination of moist and flavor and I opted for the Lemon Roasted Potatoes - also delicious. I would love to return on a Sunday and try their Lobster menu - I have a feeling this will exceed my expectations just as I was blown away by my most recent meal. The staff including waiters and upper management were nothing but friendly and warm, just as if I was dining in a family members home. Next on my list is to try their Lobster menu, which I believe is only available on a Sunday. Look forward to my next visit!!",0,0,0,Jenn H.,"Knoxville, TN",79,11,1
5.0,4/1/2019,"Had a wonderful experience at Kellari and honestly if my friend hadn't told me about it I wouldn't have known about it! The space is tremendous and I've been in few places this large. In terms of drinks I suggest the wine as they have a great selection and the staff is wonderful with recommendations based on what you're ordering. When you come here you HAVE to get seafood. It's what they specialize in (not to mention sustainable) and it is beyond fresh. The scallops, octopus and salmon we had were all cooked perfectly. If I were to skip anything it would be the potatoes because you really don't need it.

5.0,3/13/2019,"Kellari Taverna is without a doubt my new favorite restaurant for Sunday brunch in the heart of NYC. I recently enjoyed brunch at Kellari with my bestfriend who has traveled to Greece many times in the past. She has experienced authentic Greek food and can agree that the brunch menu at Kellari is the epitome of classical prepared Mediterranean style cuisine. We started by sharing a traditional Greek salad packed with freshly ripened vine tomatoes, Kalamata olives, cucumbers, green peppers, red onions, EVOO, and feta. I enjoyed a loose leaf brewed house blend tea while my bestfriend savored her table side pressed coffee with cream. Brunch for me was their famous Crab & Eggs which consisted of wild lump crab cake and perfectly poached eggsb topped with a bearnaise sauce, home fries, and a frisee salad. The eggs were creamy, light, and nicely presented on the oversized fresh crab cake. I am a visual eater therefore presentation always matters. My bestfriend devoured their Lavraki platter of Grilled Mediterranean sea bass with spinach and rice. I'm not a fan of spinach and rice however the preparation of this side dish at Kellari has me wanting to enjoy it again. Note that the fish does have bones however the kitchen does a wonderful job of removing as many bones as possible so you can experience the sea bass melting in your mouth like butter. Our plates were overflowing with food and we had no choice but to take home the remaining portion of our meal. Dessert was provided by the house in the form of almond cookies covered in powder sugar. I've eaten these cookies once before and this time around I can truly say that I'm hooked! During brunch we enjoyed endless pitchers of bellinis and the greatest level of customer service imaginable. Joanna Cotsapa is the star of the show!!! She gave us all of the best recommendations for food and drinks while treating us like family the entire time. Her level of customer service is what all servers should aspire to achieve. Our brunch lasted a lot longer than expected only because Joanna's demeanor was very welcoming and our conversation was inspirational. She has one the most delightful and attentive personalities. She goes above and beyond to ensure that every patron is stuffed with great food, feels welcome, and wants to return. Thank you Joanna for a wonderful afternoon at Kellari Tavern. We look forward to seeing you next month! Thank you to John and the entire staff for making our brunch at Kellari Taverna a memorable experience.  !   !",1,0,0,Stacy P.,"Valley Stream, NY",293,24,8

5.0,3/8/2019,"Wow, I am so happy that I discovered Kellari Taverna and checked it out for the first time last night. I had not had truly authentic Greek cuisine in ""forever"" and Kellari really ""brought it"" as they say! It's apparently known as much as an elegant sea food resto as it is a high end Greek resto; I can certainly see why. There is the most beautiful display of fresh fish and crustaceans on ice in the main dining room. (You will want to check it out at length!) I was so impressed that the server brought out my friend's sole for approval before cooking--and they did a very elegant yet timely job of deboning when my friend's finished Dover Sole was brought to her. I ordered the New York Strip medium rare--it was a very large cut (about 14 ounces) and came with a side just like the Dover Sole did. We both were dying to try the Artichoke Fricassee which is a cut up artichoke stuffed with a vegetable medley (including carrots and peas) and topped with a dill yogurt sauce. I was really impressed by this as well as the steamed mixed greens that includes some types that I have never heard of before. There are a few variations of potatoes to choose from as well as the usual fries. For dessert, my guest and I shared the house made baklava and it was very authentic (you can taste the cloves in the ""real deal""). The dining is more spacious and airy than how it appears in photos. There are super high ceilings with crystal light fixtures, a lot of wood that gives off a warm vibe and plenty of space between tables. I give Kellari Taverna a five star review mainly because of the authenticity of the cuisine, generous portions, huge amount of menu choices including unusual sides, the beautiful fresh seafood on icedisplay, friendly staff that will bend over backwards for the customers, warm atmosphere and a very central Midtown location. Kellari Taverna has a $30 three course lunch special that is one of New York's best kept secrets--this menu includes their super fresh shrimp and salmon dishes as well as five dessert choices! I will be back, no question. This is an ideal place for birthday celebrations, family brunches, business lunches, girls' night out and as the place to go when you want endless choices/Greek and seafood items that you know you won't find anywhere else in town.",2,0,2,Anne R.,"Manhattan, NY",316,15,15
4.0,3/2/2019,"My husband and I went here for the first time on a Friday night and we'll be back because the food was that good. Love the fact that this restaurant only uses fresh, organic, sustainable products. Receptionist who greeted us could've been more upbeat, but just presumed she was having a bad day. She couldn't find our reservation, but seated us rather quickly with a choice between high top or regular table. We chose the regular table. Our waiter was very attentive and helped us make some important food selection decisions. For appetizers we had the Country Pie and Octopodi. Both delicious, but my favorite was the octopus which was absolutely cooked to perfection. So tender and flavors were amazing! I had the 50/50 cocktail it was made strong enough to last my entire dinner experience. Money well spent - haha! For our main entree, I chose the Lavraki sea bass and my husband got the Seafood Yiouvetsi. Both were prepared well. I didn't care much for the Seafood Yiouvetsi as it had a hint of of mint flavor which threw me off, but my husband enjoyed it. You have to try their yogurt dessert with fruit. I forgot the name and to take pic. It was so good and just the right amount of sweetness without making you feel that guilty. I gave this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 because of the lackluster hostess greeting and the bathroom. It appeared pretty clean but the musty (maybe mold) smell said otherwise. Regardless, we would still come again and may just do appetizers because there were so many options to choose from that looked so good!!",1,0,1,Jenilynne L.,"Old Bridge, NJ",7,19,17

First off the service was beyond horrible.  We got here at 6:15 and had to make an 8:00 show.  Unfortunately, they had about 3 people working and we were completely ignored.  On top of that the food came out at a glacial pace and was fair at best. The greek salad was pedestrian and the grilled octopus was tough as nails.  The fish was ok but we were in such a rush to eat it that we couldn't really enjoy the meal.  The wine list is overpriced and missing some of the selections.  Overall, a complete disaster especially for the price.",0,1,0,Steven S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,10,0

2.0,1/15/2019,"The #metoo movement has obviously not impacted this restaurant at all! I took my team to dinner at this restaurant during NRF and upon seating, the waiter immediately turned to my male subordinate and assumed he was the one in charge and addressed him from the very beginning. Ironically, the male was not eating or drinking so addressing him at all times, makes perfect sense, right?!?! After ordering the wine I think the waiter finally got the drift that only the women were eating and drinking but still, in this day and age, I was slightly astonished by this behavior to say the least.All in all, the meal was ok. The majority of my team and I had the special Sunday lobster feast and it was not really a feast. The portions were just right - to small but after a long day of trade-showing, we should have ordered sides or appetizers, lesson learned.

2.0,12/19/2018,"I live in NYC and eat out a decent amount. I understand it's hard to predict quite when tables will be available.  I had a reservation for 8 people on a Wednesday in December (so busier than normal) for 645pm.  Arrived at 640pm and was told it would be 15-20 mins. An hour later we finally left, as my guess it would be another 15-20 mins based upon looking at the large tables.  I get that it's hard to predict, but I dont believe they were honest with us, as they told us 25 mins into it that the table was having dessert.  If that was the case then the initial estimate was a lie.  Maybe the manager is new, but u cant schedule large tables like u can 2 or 4 tops, where there are lots of them that become available all the time.

The waiter was rude and kind of obnoxious.  It was not a welcoming feeling and if quite frankly it was disgraceful. That being said the food was decent. We went with the prixe fix menu which I thought was a pretty good deal. You get an appetizer, entree and dessert for $42. You could stick with the 2 courses for $36. For my appetizer I ordered the gemista. Gemista literally means ""stuffed"" in greek and all it is a stuffed vegetable in this case it was zucchini. It is a small portion but flavor was good. It came with a egg lemon sauce which had solid flavor. For my entree I got the mahi mahi special. It was served with some funky cabbage but the dish as a whole was flavorful. We also tried the different dips which were standard. The tzatziki was not the best I have had. They forgot the kellari chips but gave them to us anyway. I guess that is a plus for the service. Overall, the food was pretty decent but the service was atrocious. Whoever our waiter was should not be a waiter.

It was almost as if you were trying to be difficult. I managed a restaurant for 5 years. I worked with many POS systems and never had the difficulty you seemed to display. And never, NEVER would I ever let ""Strange Fruit"" play as sitting music, especially if there are people of color in my establishment. It's a song about lynching, or hanging, African-American people in America. It should never be played in casual settings. ""IF"" this was a coincidence, then it must have been your bad luck. But, consider this from our perspective - Strange Fruit comes over the sound system as we are waiting for a check to be reconciled, that was never reconciled properly. We spent over $300 at your bar while we waited 50 min to be seated with a reservation and never complained. Our servers were compensated well. The bartenders were tipped well. We were, in my opinion, consummate guests. Your own staff was whispering to us, ""This is quite ridiculous!"" Now I won't start naming what it is that we do, but I can assure you that we are far from average. We are very patient and extremely intelligent. At the very least you owe my brother, and his fiancé, genuine apologies for how their party was treated. And finally, be sure to delete ""Strange Fruit"" from your playlist.

3.0,10/8/2018,"Was really looking forward to Kellari's Lobster Feast offered on Sundays only. Nice airy room with high ceilings/wooden beams and lush flowers. The friendly host offered us a ""quieter table"" in the front area near the bar instead of the main dining room, which we naively accepted. Wrong decision, service was poor and excruciatingly slow. That gave us plenty of time to chat with the nice woman sitting next to us who had been there for hours (not by choice). The manager came over to apologize for the wait but we saw other parties come and go as we sat there, so obviously there was a problem with our waiter and/or area. As for the ""lobster feast,"" Kellari's website stated that we would share a 4 pound lobster for two. False Advertising! Instead we each got a paltry 1.5 pound lobster with no sides, a side of potatoes (albeit delicious) were $10.00 extra. Hubbie got his lobster stuffed ($10.00 extra), said stuffing was kinda dry and not worth the surcharge.  Salad app was fresh and had yummy fresh feta and figs. Baklava and chocolate desserts were both yummy. Manager comped us a small glass of dessert wine after dessert, a nice touchIn light of Kellari's good food and lovely decor I've decided to give them another try, but will avoid the lobster (not) feast and sit in the main dining room next time.",4,1,2,Linda K.,"East Meadow, NY",64,187,49
3.0,9/26/2018,"After a long flight into NYC and a day basically spent at the airport, my coworker and I were anxious to drop our bags at the hotel nearby and get some delicious food. We walked over to Kellari after a recommendation and I do love some good baklava. When we arrived I was pleasantly surprised by the decor, it was such a big space and quickly snapped a picture as we were being seated. The waiter's friendliness didn't seem genuine. Unfortunately the evening went downhill rather quickly. The wine we were waiting to share took a really long time, the kind of time where you start looking around wondering where the waiter went. When we finally got the wine the appetizers arrived. We shared the fried calamari and octopus, both I was having for the first time ever and really enjoyed. But the apps started to get cold and we didn't want to get too full so we sat and waited for our entrees. We waited and waited and waited...my coworker remarked that she knows other people around us were getting their food before us and our waiter was no where to be found. When he did arrive he said our food would be out shortly and I asked ""are you sure"" because it had already been quite some time. He came up with an excuse and said that ""here in New York we wait until you're finished with your appetizer until we put in for your food."" Seriously? That doesn't make sense, we were clearly sitting there not eating anything for some time because the apps got cold and we were waiting for our entrees and he didn't bother to ask if we were done at any point. Even my coworker who had lived there for several years said that sound like bs. We felt uneasy and confused. Maybe we were just two young minority girls who didn't match the older white crowd that looked like money. Either way we were not a priority for him. I took a look at the time stamp on the picture I took earlier when we arrived. Ultimately we were seated at 7:30pm and didn't get our food until 8:45pm. The food was hot so that tells you that it was the waiter who didn't put the ticket in earlier and not the kitchen being behind. We ate quickly as it was getting late and we were exhausted from a long day of traveling. At 9:30 again we were left looking around for the waiter who had not checked on us. We really just wanted to get the check and get back to our hotels to sleep. As it was nearing 10pm I walked over to the front desk and asked for a manager to help us wrap things up. Thankful the manager was very prompt, apologetic and sincere. He made sure we had the leftovers boxed up quickly and let us sample a desert wine. He talked with us briefly and he just seemed very genuine in his care for the customer and I appreciated that just because were were from out of town that he didn't treat us that way. I only wish our waiter did the same as the evening as a whole was teetering in the 2.5 star range. But the food was decent and the decor was lovely and at least the manager did his best to make things right.By the time we left it was so late and we were so over the service that I forgot to get that baklava I was craving!

1.0,9/13/2018,"This is the first review I've written in years, because my experience here was so terrible :(  I ate at Kellari many months ago, and the customer service was so bad that when I remember it, I still get upset.  So I thought it worth sharing, for a restaurant that claims to have good hospitality.  We visited to have dinner before a show.  I ordered grilled calamari, and the waiter brought me fried calamari.  Not wanting to cause a fuss, I initially didn't say anything, but I really didn't feel like fried food, so my husband called over the waiter.  A bit embarrassed, I apologized and said that I'd actually ordered the grilled dish. He rolled his eyes and said (I quote): ""If that's what you wanted, you should have ordered it"".  I couldn't believe it!  He had called me a liar.  After he left, my husband confirmed quietly to me that I'd definitely, speaking clearly, ordered the grilled dish.  After the waiter ungraciously replaced the dish he pretty much ignored us until we were finished (and had to leave for our theater show).  I couldn't look him in the eye - his attitude was so aggressive that it actually made me cry.  I thought the management should know, for their own benefit, so I went up and talked to them about it, but they just sort of comforted me rather than doing anything. They probably thought I was having a bad day. Anyway - it was the worst customer service experience I've ever had in my life, and it still makes me sad thinking about it. Hopefully he's been fired since.",1,0,0,Annabel B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,0

The waiter (Angel) was professional, supportive and patient with us as we tried each new treat (we had to send back the caviar spread after not reading the menu close enough and having no interest with anything seafood related). The best part of the entire experience was the heavenly baklava. I am a baklava snob and this is one of the best.

UNLIMITED MIMOSAS!!!!Dude... as soon as the apps came out, we cried on the inside because we knew we would not be able to finish our actual meals. Usually you get about 5 good bites of octopus when you order an app, but this dish was made for 5 people. We chowed DOWN on the octopus. The calamari was also delish and plentiful. Our main dishes were also very good and we ate everything that could fit into our tummies. The service was perfect and we never had an empty glass of mimosa.

4.0,8/16/2018,"4 stars overall dining experience. I deducted a star for inconsistent desserts and service throughout the evening.I came with three friends of which two were visiting but from outside the US. My intention was to show them what a fantastic foodie experience I had at Kelleri a few times before. So figured this would be an excellent spot for fresh seafood and for the full classic Greek dining. Throughout the evening, there were a few hits and misses. As I originally suggested, I would have preferred that one or only half of us try the restaurant menu or skip it altogether. The summer restaurant menu was a nice sampling of their cuisine but the choices offered were only mediocre compared to their full menu. Don't get me wrong, every dish sounded interesting and appealing to the palate. But the execution, we discovered, was just not there.Must try:- the eggplant and zucchini chips. They were really moist without being oily. And the width of the slices made it a heartier dish than expected. If I could eat my veggies like this daily with the tzatziki sauce, I would. LOL- the pan seared Diver Sea Scallops! Everyone's favorite of the evening. Seared perfectly with nice brown color and the scallops were subtly sweet. The plating was gorgeous and my three guests commented that they've not seen cauliflower puree in such a pretty golden yellow hue. It was the foundation of the dish. Then accompanied by the sweet mission figs and tart or pickled figs, so delicious this combination.- I think I lucked out and got the only two slices of olive bread from the complimentary bread basket. It had such great color and the olives were so good. I offered to share but no takers.- the grilled octopus! Great balance of flavors and textures on this plate. Red onions, spices, dill and capers with olive oil all mixed in with the octopus. Texture was perfect.- the classic Greek dessert, my personal favorite, galaktoburiko. Topped with honey in a flaky phyllo dough with a custard filling. Yum. It was so good, my friends kept wanting more.- dinner not complete without a tasting of their fish entrees. I've had the branzino before so this visit I opted for the Royale Dorade. It was rich and succulent as described. (I wanted the turbot but they were out of it). My portion was slightly over a pound and it was paired with a lemon-y stock on the side should you want more citrus flavors in your fish. I did add lemon potatoes as a side order to my entree. So good. (BTW, I ordered a lovely dry but fruity rose to pair with my fish. Must say it was a great choice).My friends were not so lucky with their fish entrees. The cod and the seared stripe bass sounded great on paper but was underwhelming in execution. Bland and flavorless was used to  describe the entrees. Oh well...it looked nice at least! (The baked paper presentation was a fancy touch). Per my guests, skip the crab cakes. Described as mildly spicy, it was way spicy. Over powered the crab entirely. Disappointing.  One final comment, as there were other dishes, the desserts were underwhelming as well. The chocolate souffle was good but the goat milk vanilla ice cream was a bit odd in taste. And the orange phyllo dessert looked unlike any phyllo I've seen. It was more like a dense orange cake. Pass. The saffron sorbet was interesting. Would've been fine on its own.I am still a fan of Kelleri. Was just sad my friends didn't love it. But they did try everything I ordered and agreed my choices were great!",5,3,4,Jeannie T.,"Queens, NY",372,532,7611

1.0,6/7/2018,"One of the worst dining experiences I've had in a WHILE! The grilled calamari was so over cooked, it should have been served with a steak knife. The wine I requested was out of stock, which prompted the ""sommelier"" to just stare blankly at me until I asked for something similar in that price point. He responded with a wine suggestion but didn't know the price-- which was concerning because the entire menu was insanely overpriced for what it was! But despite those two points, the worst part of the meal occurred when the waiter messed up my order, for which I politely corrected him, and then he proceeded to argue with me about how I was wrong and must be confused. His voice was raised and I had go back and forth several times before he agreed to take it away and bring me my original order.I wouldn't expect this dining experience at a TGI Friday's, let alone an institution that charges $18 for a side of eggplant.",1,1,0,Katie A.,"New York, NY",5,53,2

Also seems to be a place where people are comfortable eating alone.   We came for dinner, restaurant week, and got a free glass of prosecco at the beautifully apportioned bar which had a platter with a huge chunk of cheese, bread and a huge platter of olives.  Lovely touch.  Every aspect of the service was more than acceptable and timely and the manager took the time to thank us for coming at the end after free glasses of dessert wine.  The only problem was the food.  Nothing was hot - is food supposed to be hot anymore?  The fish which the menu indicates was cooked with capers had no capers.  Simple hot freshly grilled fish with lemon (none served) and capers is a treat that can carry the plain spinach orzo mix it was served on. Warm fish with no lemon or capers on the same spinach missed the point completely.  How can a place this large, paying obvious attention to so many aspects, miss the food part so badly?  Where can I find a restaurant that actually calls me back because the food is worth repeating?  Or does only pizza do that at this point?",0,0,0,Erica M.,"New York, NY",0,9,0

5.0,2/2/2018,"My friend and I dropped in here right before our show and couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised. Since we had a show, we were initially worried about our time constraints and our options for food. But the waiter immediately put our worries to rest. We skipped the pre-theater pre-fixe just because we had a late lunch but paying $40 for a 3-course menu in the heart of the theater district is quite a steal. Our waiter recommended the freshly grilled octopus and their Kellari chips made with zucchini and eggplant and we followed his suggestions. Both were phenomenal. For the main course we shared a small grilled whole fish which was the first time I've ever had a grilled whole fish. I never knew what I was missing! Unfortunately, we were too full for dessert but from looking at the tables around us, those looked quite tasty too. To top it all off, the waiter had our check ready-to-go so we were able to leave in a jiffy and even got to our theater seats 10 minutes early!

The appetizers were family style so each section of the table got to try everything that came out. There was so much food just with the appetizers that by the time we got our main dish I was feeling pretty full. All of the apps were really delicious - some of which included babaganoush, hummus, and spanikopita. I had the lavraki for my main dish which was light and flavorful. The desserts were also on point and included a family style serving of baklava, galactoboureko, yiaourtopita, kormos.

I've been to Kellari many times and knew the food was great, but hosting a large event is a lot different from a regular dinner. We had a fantastic time.SPACE: We used the semi-private back area of Kellari, and found it to be comfortable and private. The tables are a perfect size to foster conversation - not so big that you can't hear each other, and not so small that you can't seat enough people at each. The decor is wonderful - you definitely get the ""friendly taverna"" vibe.LOGISTICS: It was really easy to work with Kellari to set up the dinner - they were responsive and accommodating every step of the way. We set up the menu in advance as a family style dinner and our guests didn't have to worry about a thing.FOOD & DRINKS: The food was amazing. Everything was delicious, but some highlights included: Char-grilled octopus; grilled jumbo shrimp; lamb chops; filet mignon, grilled lavraki, and of course the desserts.

2.0,6/26/2017,"Sat at the bar for cocktails and oysters - ordered drinks, and asked the bartender what oysters were available. He replied he didn't know, but whatever 4 varieties on the chalkboard were wrong, and he would find out. He came back with an answer..kusshi and some East coast variety that I was unfamiliar with. We ordered 1/2dz, while sipping drinks - I had Campari and Soda, my girl had a peach sparkling drink that we both tasted grapefruit, no peach. No big deal, but we think it was the wrong drink. Oysters came, and the bartender literally just set them down and walked away. No explanation of what oyster is what, no hello, goodbye, nada. Okay, again no biggie. The kusshi, pretty easily identified by the small size and deep cup, looked mangled. Usually this is because the shucker isn't really skilled. Okay, so we hit 'em with lemon, try to slurp these oysters....,nothing. They didn't cut the bottom muscle so you can get the freaking oyster out of shell. Got bartender, explained what was going on. He grabs the tray, mumbles 'sorry' and takes it away. No 'I'll get you a new one', what would you like, nothing. We didn't know what he planned. A couple minutes later, shellfish come back, even more mangled. We refused them, paid and split. We didn't make it onto the dining room, so I can't comment on rest of place. But bartender working 6/24/17 really was bad, non-communicative. The front of the house manager was nice but clueless. Two things - they have these nice 1/4 wheels of cheese to nibble on with crostini on the bar...only it's a wheel of hard parm/reg. Not really nibbling cheese IMO.

The best part of the meal was probably the grilled pita.Around 10pm, the bar tender had to change shift, one of them came to us and said ""hey guys, we have to change shift, so can you close the tap and open another one, and maybe they will buy you one round or something""...really?

The restaurant had a good number of tables occupied considering the time and day, so probably a good idea to place a reservation in advance.The bread served at the table was very good. Our waiter was attentive and took little time to get our drinks and orders down. I liked how they give you the menu option to pre-fix your order to 2 or 3 choices. Especially since my friends and I don't eat too much and were able to share the apps and desserts. So the three of us ordered the 2 choice option where we shared 2 apps and 1 dessert. It was perfect since most of the apps came in portions of 3! I ordered the orzo shrimp. It was well cooked and I enjoyed the lightness of the dish with the tomato sauce. Shrimp wasn't overcooked and a good size (6 pieces?). For those with a heartier appetite, you can order the lamb chops which is an extra $10 premium. The standard 2 choice entree is about $34 I believe. However they do not skimp on the meat. You get at least 4-5 lamb chops pieces! It was also nice and tender and well flavored. Comes with lemon potatoes which were also good. My other friend had the Mediterranean fish with lentils. It was cooked well and tasted good but preferred the other two dishes.The spanakopita was very good. Enjoyed that the best of the two apps we had. The baklava was absolutely yummy.

This place should go quietly into that good night so a decent restaurant can take over the prime Manhattan real estate it currently wastes. Came here for a holiday business lunch with some colleagues and was disappointed through and through. Yes, the upscale white tablecloth decor is easy on the eyes but beyond that, this place has very little to offer.For a prefix lunch special that came to nearly $50 a person without drinks, it felt like a rip-off. The charred octopus that I paid $10 extra for was overdone to the point of being unpalatably crispy. Even though I was hungry, I couldn't finish it. The salmon was undercooked, yet still managed to be rubbery and tasteless on top of an insipid pile of sad lentils. Considering that every dish was very aesthetically plated, I was actually appalled by how bad it tasted. Nine out of 10 times I love Greek food. But this managed to be amongst the most expensive and the worst that I've had! An incredible feat for sure.The only things that I found tasty enough to remotely enjoy was the crusty bread that they bring out at the beginning with olive oil and the baklava  - - which probably came from a bakery in Astoria. Yeah, it's cool that that waitstaff crumbs the table in between courses, but I could really give a damn if the service is as surly and negligent as it was. Out of four people, two of us had our order screwed up and at the end when my colleague attempted to pay with a gift certificate he had received, the waiter (catty dude with blue hair) gave him serious attitude.

The actual squid was good, but the way they fried it was not. It was almost as if they fried a huge batch early in the morning and left it under a heat lamp. The breading was oily, soggy, and falling apart. My entree wasn't that much better. I went with the grilled lamb with sunny side eggs and home fries. The flavor of the lamb was not bad. They used the right spices and it didn't have that gamey taste that lamb can sometimes have. But the meat was extremely chewy. It was as if I was eating lamb jerky.

I got the price fix 3 course and I think that it was a bargain with nicely sized portions.  You can't complain about the service or the staff-all very good and friendly.  Perhaps the best part of the meal was the baklava and for that alone I would give 5 stars for that part of my dinner.  I've tasted baklava from a genuine Greek mother who made it for the staff at the hospital every year for Christmas and it tasted exactly like what I had at this restaurant.  For that reason alone I'm recommending that if you think that you love baklava go here and ask to sit away from the bar (too noisy for my taste).",1,0,0,Steve F.,"Louisville, KY",0,11,11

4.0,3/13/2016,"I really want to give this place 5 stars as the food is so amazing. Truly I do, but I can't due to one major thing-head hostess. Talk about sourpuss! You can't miss her-bleached blonde, red lipstick and rude as hell. Get over yourself-you make the restaurant look bad with your rude self.First, food. Delicious bread with fresh humus and olive oil. Who doesn't love that?! On my first visit I ordered the eggplant & zucchini chips only to find out that is only zucchini chips (guess they ran out of eggplant).  I had the Greek salad but added grilled shrimp to it and a side of grilled veggies. Absolutely amazing. The shrimp were huge and filling. The salad was beautiful with the perfect balance. My client got fish that looked awesome.  The second time I went (about three weeks later), I entered and my cousin who was waiting for me immediately complained about the rude hostess. I agreed that last time I had the same experience and shocker-it was the same lady. I wanted the same exact salad since I loved it so much but apparently they can't add shrimp to my salad as its dinnertime. I didn't understand the difference as I would clearly pay for it as I did for lunch but dinner is different. I would have to order two meals to get that combo. I did. It was again delicious.  I would give this 5 stars except for the rudeness of the hostess both times.  Also, the second time I had two waiters that seemed as if they were competing with each other. I had to give my drink and appetizer orders twice because the second guy said it would be easier from him-so weird.  Not sure what it means but the food was so exceptional that I'll go back despite these negatives.",5,1,1,Meera S.,"Manhattan, NY",102,53,10

2.0,12/9/2015,"I came here for a co workers bday and we had reservations for 12:30.  The first thing I noticed was how busy this place was.  I understand a lunch rush but I was surprised how busy this restaurant got during the day.  As other reviewers mention, this is a very upscale and spacious restaurant with beautiful décor.  We sat down and were greeted by our server who was nice, but very slow.  I personally think that people should be able to get in and out in about an hour during the day, but our whole meal was about two hours due to the slow service.  Maybe they just don't want to rush people.Onto the food, I chose the pick three prix fix business lunch and had the following:Bread for the table- this was super yummy!  Tasted fresh and came with olive oil and hummus.Spanakopita- this was the best part of the meal.  Very flaky and yummy, just how it should be.Kotopoulo- I don't like seafood, which is unfortunate because this place seems like a great spot for seafood.  That being said, if they have an item on their menu, they should still know how to cook it to perfection.  My chicken breast was so over cooked, almost burnt.  The lemon sauce that it came with was tasty, but there was no saving that chicken.  The French fries were good, and they came with crumbled feta on the top.  But sadly, fries should not be the best part of an entrée.Yogurt cake- this was recommended by our server and I would describe it as a bland cheesecake.  It came with raspberries and a cherry sauce which did make it sweeter, but I still wouldn't order it again.

3.0,11/11/2015,"Had lunch at Kellari Taverna this past Sunday. Here are my thoughts:Ambiance is nice. The place is classy and large. The noise level was quite high though, due to two VERY large parties - a baby shower and a bridal shower. Service was nothing short of terrible. I believe this was due to the aforementioned large parties and minimal weekend staffing. Our waiter took at least 15 minutes to appear, and our food took an entire hour, despite constantly being told it was coming out shortly. We were very frustrated.Food was pretty good overall. -- Royal Dorado was excellent, although it came with bones and the head intact. This after the waiter confirmed the fish would be (mostly) deboned and would arrive without the head. As I don't like to see my fish in it's original state, the presentation was a bit disappointing.-- Husband had the Horitiki omelette and enjoyed it (I didn't try it).-- Daughter had the Thalassino Proino, which she didn't enjoy because she said it was lacking taste. I also thought it was a bit bland and needed salt but the shrimp was good.Ultimately the manager comped our entire meal, due to the ridiculous wait time. This was very nice of him, especially since we didn't ask for anything. And this is why the restaurant gets 3 stars instead of 1.Will we go back? Maybe not as prices are on part with many other excellent Greek restaurants in NYC, including Avra, Milos, and Limani, where we've never had an issue.

We had appetizers, salads, entrees and dessert and not once felt rushed.  Made it to the theatre in plenty of time.  The service was excellent and the fresh seafood was as if it came straight outta the ocean.  It's a big place with lots of seating.  I won't say it's noisy but we've been twice.  As I mentioned the first time was early and it was very conversational.  The second time there was a group of 14 business types in the middle of the room and they were not considerate of the other dinner guests.  Looking forward to our next trip and those unbelievably amazing prawns!!!",1,0,0,Tim P.,"Memphis, TN",60,138,83
3.0,8/29/2015,"Solid place for a business lunch!  The three of us shared 5 appetizers, which was more than enough because Kellari embraces the American approach to food - more is better.  All the portions were huge.  Service was friendly and efficient, so Kellari is a good place to go if you need to have lunch wrapped up in an hour.The apps we ordered were standard fare, so next time I want to try out the fish which I've read are very fresh.  1.  Grilled octopus2.  Lobster ravioli - Very large pieces covered in delicious creamy sauce3. Spreads - The usual stuff like tzatziki, hummus, babaganoush, etc with pita bread4. Crab cake5.

1.0,8/18/2015,"Tonight was the last time I came to this place. I used to like it so much. I brought my business partners many times for a drink or a dinner. So did I tonight. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and appetizers with my colleague. It was a business meeting in a casual atmosphere. I've met an owner few times before when he came to greet me and offered us a dessert wine (before we got the main course, but it's okay, all the business people try to please the customers)...anyway, he seemed a nice gentleman to me. I also met a couple managers and had a chat with them occasionally. While we were enjoying our drinks the owner started yelling at staff right at the the front door and got really emotional about some things(not my business) but I need to say I felt embarrassed having my conversation. I saw one of the ladies even walked out. Is that the way to maintain the hospitality? I don't think so. After that I asked the bartender for a check and we left to have a dinner at another place.

3.0,8/10/2015,"I came here for Restaurant Week dinner with a friend the other night and I had a pleasant experience. The interior is simple and pretty with high ceilings. The food was good, although we were so busy chatting I didn't end up trying much of my friend's dishes. I ordered the scallops as an appetizer. I wouldn't say they were especially good or anything, not bad. I did find the cauliflower puree very interesting. I ordered the lamb chops for my entree and I enjoyed them a lot. I did get them medium and in hindsight, I should have gotten them medium rare, but I don't eat lamb that often so I thought I would play it safe. I ended the night with baklava, which was delicious. My friend got the honey walnut cake, which ended being way to sweet for her, although the ice cream was delicious. It was a good experience, but I'm not sure I would come back for a regular menu priced dinner.",0,0,1,Christine K.,"Palisades Park, NJ",108,113,74
1.0,8/10/2015,"Horrible service and mediocre food that was not worth the wait or frustration. This review is for brunch only. I am extremely disappointed with my trip to Kellari.  I have heard wonderful things regarding their brunch, but I did not have a great experience.  Perhaps it was during restaurant week, but I don't think it is an excuse, especially if the restaurant is competing with so many others in the same area.My reservation was at 12:30PM.  The waiter did not take our order till 1:00PM, and did not receive our first course (calamari) till 1:25PM and drinks at 1:30PM.  Yes, the food came before the actual drinks (I just ordered a grapefruit juice by the way). The main dish came at 2:18PM and it was the wrong order!  I received a plate with just potatos and 2 eggs.  So I have to wait for the waiter to give me the right order.  Get this, after waiting for 10 minutes without any attention, I had to personally walk to find the waiter that served me and ask.  Unbelieveable!  I was so furious that I had them pack the desserts to go.  I was already late for a movie because of the terrible and slow service.  Food: Calamari was oily and poorly done, there was small pools of oil just sitting at the bottom of the plate and I couldn't finish my portion. The jumbo crabmeat was a small thin crabcake the size of a cookie. The dessert was just okay.I will not recommend this place.",0,2,0,Lily C.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,19,2

2.0,8/2/2015,"Went here for RW brunch so I did my due diligence and adjusted my expectations accordingly- it was a perfect NY summer day so I was sure everyone and their mamas were out tryna get their RW deal grub on and their menu definitely sounded the best of the Sunday brunch bunch- you get a cocktail/juice, an appetizer and entree (with lots of seafood choices for no added $!), and dessert + coffee or tea all for the low price of $25! Despite the 3-star Yelp average, I couldn't say no.We got to the restaurant and it wasn't super packed- score! Our server was quick to take our order and our drinks came just as quickly. My bellini gets 1 of the stars you see up top- it was THE absolute best I've ever had. My other star was for my calamari appetizer which was lightly breaded and cooked to tender perfection- and the serving was big enough for 2 people!It took a while for our entrees to arrive but I was still full from my app so I didn't notice nor mind. My salmon was perfection, but the spanakorizo it came with was forgettable- its basically the naked version of their sad spanakopita (which my sister had and hated) with a few slices of beets underneath- I ate the salmon and picked thru the wilted spinach and beets and kept it moving. My sister had the ""lumpcrab"" benedict- it had SOME crab but definitely not lumps of them thus the """".By the time we finished our entrees we were an hour and a half into the meal. Our server asked if we were in a rush and he explained that the dessert my sister chose is cooked to order so it would take a bit of time- mind you we ordered dessert along with the rest of the meal so one would think you'd get that dessert going halfway thru so it's ready by the time we finish but whatever, we were still full from our main courses anyway so we didn't mind the extra wait. Half an hour and 2 peepee breaks later, still no dessert. Our server came to ask if we'd gotten our dessert (even when our table was clearly free of any signs of dessert being served) and said he would check on it again. Yet another 15 minutes later, we flagged him down for our check and missing dessert and asked to just have it to go coz my butt was legit numb from sitting so damn long and we'd already wasted 2 and a half hours in this place when it's so beautiful out! Our wrapped dessert came shortly after that semi-bitchfest along with our check and upon inspection, we saw they charged us for the 2 coffees-- their menu clearly said cocktails AND coffee/tea, not OR!  It was only $5 and they gladly took the charge off anyway but still- it's the principle. To add insult to injury, my sister requested to have half her plate to go- a whole crabcake, an egg, and a handful of fries- and all we got in the box when we got home was 7 measly pieces of fries- NOTHING ELSE. What the hell man?!?!?! We're so over this place that principle or not, we couldn't even bother to call and complain.From good to bad to ugly, needless to say, this horrid 1st experience is more than enough reason to make it our last.

The food was outstanding, from the salted chick peas that sit on the bar which tasted like magic in my mouth to the delicious grilled octopus appetizer, which was never my favorite food until now, to the flavorful seafood and vegetable entree which I fully enjoyed.  The wine captain chose an excellent Greek vintage that paired well with our food. The seafood selection is so fresh, it is nicely displayed as part of the decor and you can choose which specific one you would like prepared for you.

We were able to quickly decide what we wanted to eat - start with a greek salad to share, and I got the salmon and she got the sea bass as entrees. Immediately after we ordered our waitress brought us bread with hummus and olives, and only a few minutes later our greek salad was ready and on our table. The salad was perfect to share - it had two larger chunks of feta cheese and plenty of large pieces of tomato, cucumber, onions, etc - perfect for trying different bites of food. Our entrees took a bit longer to come out (but by no means too long) and they were absolutely delicious. The sea bass was huge and cooked perfectly and my salmon was cooked just how I like it - crispy on the inside, but tender and a little rare on the inside. After our entrees we each had a coffee, and our waitress brought us some complimentary little cookies to go with it. The whole meal took around an hour and a half and we were taking our time to eat - we easily could have finished in an hour our less if we had eliminated the coffee or the salad from the meal. Our waitress was very attentive as well and checked in to see how our meal was and make sure we didn't need anything consistently throughout the meal. All in all, the restaurant is a little pricey, but the atmosphere, service, and the food is completely worth what you are paying.

My main course of cod was over salted and the brussel sprouts were hard. Pete had mixed seafood for his entree and it was uninteresting. He said his dessert tasted off and my baklava was nothing to write home about. I'm sure this place can do better--but maybe NOT for the RW crowd.

When we arrived, it took the maitre'd a few minutes between noticing us and acknowledging our arrival (while fumbling copies of menus and talking to other staff in the meantime). Worse still, it took the maitre'd half an hour (after our reserved time---and we arrived punctually) to get us a table. We ordered a two-pound red snapper to share. It took another half an hour to arrive, which'd be actually fine if the fish was good enough to warrant such wait time. Yet the fish was medicore at best---you would think a fish restaurant would have fresh enough fish to offer but unfortunately the flesh of red snapper lost that unique bouncy texture unique to fresh fish.Overall,  there is a significant discrepancy between the price tag and the service/food quality.

Her great service helped make the evening very special.The additional staff who helped her with our group were also professional and efficient.I and my guests could not have had a more pleasant time.Of course, the fact that all of the food was outstanding didn't hurt either.We had  a first course of Greek Salad, Pikilia (Greek spreads w/pita), Spanakopita, and Fried Calamari with both herb aioli and marinara sauce.  All were very good, with the Calamari being mentioned my myself and a few others as the best we'd ever eaten.  It was light and seemed to melt in your mouth.  For entrees we had four choices: Lamb Chops, Amish (I don't know the Greek connection) Chicken, Vegetable Moussaka, and, Grilled Lavraki (bronzino).All were found to be quite tasty and well prepared.We finished with coffee, tea and assorted pastry and fresh fruit.  All the pastry was house made and delicious.The price for all of this great food and service was well within reason.While I do not envision my having a need to host another  party, I will return expecting more great food and service.",2,0,1,Ivan K.,"Sarasota, FL",0,34,0

4.0,1/7/2015,"Full disclosure: I went into this meal expecting to be disappointed. Because it's near Penn Station and Times Square, I expected overpriced, underwhelming fare. My parents booked it for a post-Broadway show dinner based on a recommendation from the Penn Club nearby. Because of the tourist-trap factor, I was pleasantly surprised by the fresh ingredients and careful preparation of the food served here. To start, my family split the Kellari veggie chips, the saganaki, and the pikilia. The veggie chips were perfectly crispy and thinly cut and the saganaki was rich and salty. The dips were nice and fresh, but I was a bit surprised that no one came by to replenish our pita bread since there was so much more dip than bread. For my main, I got the Kellari salad, which was well-dressed and refreshing. Everything was good, but not anything I couldn't get in Philly for a fraction of the price. What you do get is the convenience factor (a short walk from the train station and Broadway shows) and an elegant vibe, and when you're in a time crunch, that can make the excessive price worth it.

It's OK, but no where near its legendary status.   Same thing with the Sardines which used to be grilled to perfection, now no longer tasted as if they were just caught and thrown over an open flame with lemon and oil.

We both got the fixed price menu: for her, spanakopita, lamb chops and custard pie; (she ordered the chocolate ganache but they were out of it) for me, sea mullet, Mediterranean sea bass, and baklava. The bread was good and it came with REALLY good hummus. May have even been the best part of dinner.The spanakopita was just okay. A bit bland. It had a tough outer crust so it was more like  a pie than the flaky square pieces you usually get. Putting hummus on it helped the blandness. The sea mullet was excellent, I could've eaten just that and been very happy with it! Her chops were a mixed bag. One was tough and the other two were pretty good. Nothing special though. It came with greens that were surprisingly good. My sea bass was just okay. The head and tail were still on the plate (why?) and there were several bones in it near the head, even though the menu said fish are deboned unless you ask. It certainly wasn't bad but I've had far better. Even though she didn't get what she wanted, my wife loved the custard pie. I liked it too, though they took our knives away at that point and it was a bit hard to cut it up without one. My baklava was cylinder-shaped with a LOT of nuts in the middle and on top. The pistachios on top I expect, but whatever nuts were in the middle were a poor choice. There were bitter and there were far too many of them. I actually had to scoop a few out and once I did, I could actually taste the honey and dough and they were great. The service started out good but after dessert the waiter disappeared for 15 minutes. I had to ask the host for the bill. Overall, we liked the decor and most of the food but we can't give it a solid recommendation.

Given that our team was about 10 strong, we got a chance to sample most of the appetizer/meze menu to include - Kellari Veggie Chips - well-crisped; despite being fried, it definitely tasted healthy - Soutzoukakia (meatballs) - tender, cumin-y in zesty tomato sauce - Calamari - (again) well-fried as to not be too greasy/heavy - Spanakopita - small for the price, but pretty authenticI wish we opted to try the octopus as well, since Yelpers rave about it... but between those 4 dishes and our complimentary bread basket (which came with hummus, olives, and radishes), we were satiated enough to (semi-patiently) wait for our entrees. I definitely think that the appetizers were the star of the meal. Not that I had any complaints about my salmon (plated with beets, potatoes, and some yogurt-y sauce), but it wasn't as spectacular as I anticipated. I think Kellari Taverna fell into the trap of raising one's expectations too high from its appetizers! All-in-all, a solid choice for a business lunch as it has attentive service, spacious tables (with great decor!), and generously-portioned food... all while being within blocks of both Bryant Park and Times Square.

I wish I could have given this place a 4 star rating since the decor is right up my alley - high ceilings, beautiful woodwork, a lovely bar as you enter, spacious tables. Foodwise, I can sadly only give 3. For the record, other Yelpers are right - Kellari does have a complimentary cheese plate if you arrive early and decide to grab a drink at the bar. However, I did not get to experience this as the bartender did not offer it to us (ie. i felt that I had to pro-actively (and politely) request to have it brought over). For starters, my fiance and I were served a cold bread basket with 3 complimentary tasters (hummus, olives and radishes). I was surprised they didn't serve warm pita bread. Nevertheless, i thought the hummus and radishes were nice additions. The highlight of our entire meal was the appetizers - my fiancee ordered the Octopus and I had the ""Tonos"" Tartare - both were delicious. And I have to add how nice and generous the portions were for Meze sizes. We could not decided who had the better dish since both were great. Kellari seems to be known for their seafood dishes, so we each ordered a different fish by the pound (the Lavraki and Tsipoura). Although most of their fish selections are unavailable by dinner so don't be surprised if the waitress tells you that 5 out of 7 selections are off the menu. Both fish that we ordered were seasoned simply with lemon and olive oil. I like simply cooked fish, however i thought on the whole it was uninspiring.  Finally, we shared the yogurt cake for dessert. It tasted like a very light version of cheesecake. I'm usually not much of a fan of Greek desserts as I find them too sweet. This yogurt cake hit the spot, but was also not memorable.

I went there many times and I can tell by my experience that the service is excellent, the place is well decorated and always full. The fish is always FRESH and you will never have issues. It's what I ask for a sea food restaurant at first. When you ask for Gambas or tiger shrimps, they delivers shrimps of 6 inches, not 2 inches like most of places! The ""loup de mer"" (sea bass) is well calibrated, with premium cooking and taste like in the best restaurants of the French Riviera. Also, the Lamb is one the best I had ever seen in any places, taste like in the south of France. Just worth it for everything.

To start off, the interior was beautiful, cozy and festive in preparation for the holidays. We ended up ordering from the prix fixe menu, with a dynamite appetizer and a disappointing main dish. I started off with then salmon tartare which was small but delicious. (I prefer quality over quantity so I was more than impressed). With a start off like that I couldn't wait for the main dish. I ordered the rosemary chicken with feta infused mashed potatoes. The chicken was dry ad the intriguing feta infused mashed potatoes simply tasted like mashed potatoes with sour cream. The dish was also in need of some other vegetables. Hm. Maybe I had just ordered the wrong main dish, but with those prices everything should be good. Also our waiters kept changing and asking us the same questions, which started to get enjoying when our table conversation kept getting interrupted.

We had to ask for more water, refill our own glasses of wine and no one asked us if the food was okay. The server never introduced himself, so no idea what his name is. We didn't get a tour of the fish display or have any specials told to us so none of us ordered fish. It was my fiancées birthday and I told the waiter. I thought maybe they did something for birthdays. Instead we were charged for the dessert on a 400 check, really? Don't waste your time going here. The only reason I gave two stars is because the food was decent and good but the restaurant as a whole and the staff are not good. You would think a Greek restaurant would also play Greek music; instead they were blasting Christmas songs!?  When we asked the waiter if we could change the music, he laughed at us.

4.0,9/20/2013,"I came to Kellari about a week ago with some friends of mine from out of town because they wanted try an ""authentic"" Greek restaurant with their Greek pal (go figure...). I had heard of their seafood selection and said ""hey, why not..."".I called the restaurant the day of, since I hadn't made a reservation, to see if there was going to be any availability for the four of us for that evening. A young man, who I'm assuming was a manager at the restaurant, told me that they were fully booked that evening for parties of four but if we came a bit after 6:45 and gave him our name he'd do his best to get us in. I said sure and since I was too lazy to look for anything else, I thought we'd take our chances.So, as planned, we showed up about 5 to 7 pm and were greeted at the front desk. I gave my name to the hostess (cute, by the way) and this guy from behind us said ""oh yes, Mr. -. I saved a table just for you"". Now, that's some service...Feeling relieved and having given my friends the impression that I'm a big honcho in NYC ( I did like it- not going to lie...), we were taken to this really nice table in the middle of the restaurant. The older busser came by, greeted us and asked which water we would prefer to have for the evening. We opted for sparkling, since it was our fancy-schmancy night out in NYC lol. Soon after, an older gentleman approached us with the wine menu which was HUUUUGE! We asked for a recommendation with our fish and he recommended a bottle of Pinot Noir. I thought "" what? A RED wine with fish?"" But relied on his expertise and said okay. Before he left the table, our tall, blonde waitress approached the table with a big smile and asked us if we had any questions regarding the menu and if we would like any recommendations for our appetizers and entrees.I wanted to test her, being the nasty Greek that I am, to see how well she knew ""my food"". She answered all my questions without hesitation, made good recommendations and left us to place our orders.The place was loud and it did become irritating to the point where I had to SCREAM to my friend right next to me for him to hear me. Ugh. Music was nice and reflected the ambience they were going for - rustic, yet sophisticated.Our appetizers came to the table within 15-20 minutes and all looked and smelled very appetizing. Everything standard greek; spanakopita, grilled octopus, saganaki, horiatiki salad, sardines etc. it all tastes very good except that everything was a tad over-salted. Who knows- maybe the guy in the Kitchen was shaking up a storm with the salt that night...Our main courses came out about 30 minutes later, which did feel a bit too long to wait for the entrees we ordered. When our fish did arrive to the table, it appeared to have been sitting for sometime given that it was lukewarm at best. Our friend, who opted for a steak, didn't receive his dish until 5 minutes after us which did make it a bit annoying. Our waitress did, though, apologize to us for the wait and asked if she could bring us anything else while she filled our wine glasses...I guess a buzzed customer is a happy customer(true!).We got over it quickly as the food was prepared rather well, but not outer worldly like some other restaurants in NYC. I did expect a nicer plating from this place but it was not unappealing to the point of saying ""what's this ----?"". The portion size was large and definitely was more than enough for everyone. Oh, the wine- it was masterly paired! Bravo!The plates were cleared quickly after we were finished and we were then offered a dessert menu. I saw they offered greek coffee and suggested 4 with all the traditional greek pastries on the menu (big spender, I know).The coffees, unfortunately, took forever and were brought to our table by a man who looked like he would stab us with a fork after he delivered our coffees- very unattractive to say the least... The desserts came out and looked/tasted great- very authentic! The Greek coffee on the other hand... Yea, needs work...Overall, Kellari is a nice restaurant with a lot to offer. I would recommend the restaurant just because of the VIP treatment I got without stepping foot into the place before, the lovely ladies on staff ;-), and the beautiful decor. The only negative comment I have to give is that their kitchen needs to be better organized and the food more consistent (less salt please!!!).

2.0,9/19/2013,"Mixed effect... we were here for a large group business dinner, so perhaps that was one clue for the kitchen not to worry about our quality of food.The appetizers - fried calamari was super-greasy and salty, and the fillo pies with spinach, leeks and feta was salty. The salad was simple - just chopped lettuce and dressing. The bread was decent - white, wheat and sesame. And the Pikilia (house assorted spreads) came with no pita until we were practically done with it. There was also a hot grilled feta cheese, which was far too salty, even with bread. One pro - they had olive oil right on the table coming in.Paidakia (Grilled lamb chops. Oregano lemon potatoes) was decent, though oddly enough, lacking enough salt on the lamb chops for a main course.The Karidopita (honey walnut cake with gelato) was tasty, as was the Baklava but all of it too sweet to have more than a couple bites.One nice gentleman (looked like a manager or owner as he just walked around and didn't do any serving) explained the various fish and seafood displayed out on the ice bed in the middle of the restaurant.And when I received my individual bill for extra drinks, they had already tacked on gratuity... how lovely. An individual bill. Great.Service was so-so (I was often out of water), and I never appreciate a place to add on gratuity just for an individual order for drinks.

The décor and service is fast and efficient, not the friendliest but fine. I would have given this place 3 stars except that we ordered a 1lb fish and when we got the bill we were charged for 1.3lbs which I find hard to believe. It couldn't have been more than 3-4 ounces of actual fish meat. At $44/lb, the server should have asked if this was OK before just assuming it was. I was tired and did not bother to say anything. The fish was OK. It was overdone so it was a bit mushy instead of flaky, and bland. The Kellari chips were good, but come with the tiniest cup of Tzatziki for a large plate of vegetable chips. One of us ordered the fish as mentioned above, and one of us did the Restaurant week special and got the scallop appetizer, orzo entrée, and baklava dessert. The scallop was surprisingly very big but bland and also overdone. The orzo was good, also a bit bland, and came with large shrimp, also overcooked.

But sadly the restaurant fell short, really short. The pre-meal bread was served with olives, humus and radishes. The olives and humus made sense and were good. But I did not understand why there were radishes. It was like non sequitur on my table. Really made no sense. Carrots yes, celery, maybe, but radishes?My appetizer was very disappointing. I ordered the grilled scallop over truffle risotto. When it came out I had to laugh because it was a single scallop. Where as, I was expecting at 2-3. OK, so that is more my error for reading the menu wrong. But I swear I saw and ""S"" at the end of scallop. The risotto was more porridge like than risotto and lacked the truffle flavor I was looking for. But for me it was more about getting the one scallop. The main courses were good but the kitchen apparently forgot to read the menu. We both ordered fish. My date ordered the Sea Bass with fingerling potatoes. Instead she got some sort of boiled greens with tomatoes. Not at all what she wanted or expected. My grilled Mediterranean bass was flavorful but I spent a good part of the meal pulling bones from my mouth and chewing carefully to make sure I did not swallow any.Then dessert came. She got the honey walnut cake. It was tasty but good lord look out if you are diabetic. I swear this is the sweetest thing I have ever tasted in my life. 2 bites and that was enough. I ordered vanilla and citus flavored custard pie. Once again tasty but not what I had hoped for or expected. The consistency of the pie was more like a cannoli than a custard.

4.0,5/21/2013,"More like 3.5 stars, but what can I say, I give people the benefit of doubt.Here's what was awesome about the place:Really nice decor, cozy atmosphere.Above average food.  The real standout was the fresh fish.  It's a Mediterranean restaurant, and true to its roots, they give you a huge selection with plenty of examples laid on a bed of ice for your viewing pleasure.  The lightly grilled fish (of your choice) with olive oil and capers really pleases the palate.  The seafood orzo was also decent.  Not as good as the fresh fish but the fresh seafood they use is definitely of note.  I must point out the scallops here were absolutely delicious.  The shrimp, while big, was overcooked though.Also worth mentioning the appetizer spread sampler was decent.Some shortcomings:The service was very hit or miss.  It seemed at times the staff was too busy chatting with each other and did not pay attention to some customers (including myself) trying to get their attention.  They were friendly, whenever you can find them.The dessert was very meh.  I ordered the chocolate cake (which was sort of a souflee).  They screwed up the first one (apparently the souflee sank), so I had to wait for a replacement.  Apparently the replacement also sank so they gave us a free greek yogurt dessert (nice of them, it tasted okay, the yogurt was very fresh though).  By the time the cake finally came out it was about as hard and dry as a hockey puck.  Maybe it's because I waited so long for the cake, or my expectations were higher because of the delay.  I would still recommend this place for anyone interested in a cozy meal, just stick with the entrees and the fish.",7,4,5,Kevin W.,"Manhattan, NY",1288,747,1078

4.0,4/11/2013,"I was ready to hate this place, but it just didn't happen. Even though it was a Sunday, you could tell this is a restaurant that attracts the suits and the smug personalities that come with them. After all, it's on a prime block of West 44th Street between 5th and 6th equidistant between Grand Central Station and Times Square. I ended up there because I was sitting in Bryant Park at 5PM wondering what I could eat before the 7PM curtain for ""Pippin"". I was looking for something that was a cut above the nearest Gray's Papaya but nothing that would bankrupt me either.My Yelp app led me to Kellari, and I'm glad because I would have pooh-poohed it otherwise. They offer a prix fixe menu - during both pre-show (4-7PM) and post-show hours (10PM-12M) - a smart business move if you ask me, and for a change, it appears to cover the gamut of their menu instead of focusing on whatever they ordered too much of back in the kitchen. Two courses cost $31.95, while three were $34.95 - which means dessert would cost you only three dollars extra as well as a lifetime on the hips. Three for me, of course...what are you, kidding?For my appetizer, I decided on the Scallop, which indeed was one singular one lightly seared nestled on a small mound of a creamy truffle risotto (see photo). Delicious. Small but delicious. Me want more. And so I did with my entree selection, the exotically dubbed Yiouvetsi (see photo). This was basically a seafood orzo dish, but they actually roast the orzo first and then mix in various shellfish - shrimp, scallop (yep, just one again), mussels and clam (actually more than one and shelled already). Delicious again and this time brothy almost like a Greek cioppino but not quite.I was liking the maritime theme of my meal but definitely did not order a scallop for dessert. This time I went for the Galatoboureko described as a ""vanilla and citrus-flavored custard pie"". Really? It tasted more like Baklava to me. I think it was since what I had was layered with filo dough and drenched in honey syrup (see photo). Sweet. Too sweet for my taste. I didn't point the error out to the waiter since I had ""magic to do...just for you"" at the Music Box in a half-hour. All in all, it was a fine pre-show meal and one I wouldn't mind repeating.FOOD - 4 stars...surprisingly savory scallop dishes tickled my palate more than my walletAMBIANCE - 4 stars...a huge, cavernous space with the appropriate Mediterranean touches and not crowded together eitherSERVICE - 3 stars...OK but not very personable or giving of recommendationsTOTAL - 4 stars...mid-priced Greek food done the right way where you don't quite expect it",12,8,8,Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4521,4629,37977

4.0,2/11/2013,"We came here during RW but avoided that menu in favor of a variety of meze as a pre-theatre meal. Our four selections came out nicely timed as two courses for us to share. First, traditional saganaki, fired at the table with ouzo, was almost as good as what we have had in Greece. But not quite. They did a good job of not making it rubbery, which is a common problem. This was paired with the Kellari veggie chips with tzatziki, which was FABULOUS. Perfectly fried zucchini and eggplant ""chips,"" and I seriously could have eaten a barrel of that chunky tzatziki.  Delicious.Second, we shared wonderfully char-grilled octopus, so tender and flavorful, and the pan-seared scallops with truffled taramosalata. The scallop was delicious and perfectly cooked, but a little sandy and gritty... I hate that, because the flavor was great.

The only negative thing I would say about this place is the fresh market seafood.

4.0,1/28/2013,"From start to finish, each meal was delicious, and ordering from their Restaurant Week menu allowed us to try a good amount from their menu without simultaneously going broke. It all begins with a basket of sesame bread with a side of olives, sliced beets, and a purée (though with a hummus consistency) made of sun-dried tomatoes and feta which was beyond heavenly. Both my boyfriend and I ordered the grape leaves which was kindly paired with our entree thanks to our server. AMAZING. They came out warm over a thin layer of yogurt and it just tasted wonderful. My boyfriend ordered the orzo with scallops, mussels, and clams for his entree and reports that it was rather bland. However, I ordered the Mediterranean bass cooked with a side of wilted greens and it was exquisite. The fish was butterflied open, deboned and drizzled with a little olive oil, lemon and capers. That's it. Simple but soooo tasty. Speaking of fish... If you really wanted, they have a selection of fish on ice right outside the kitchen that you can pick yourself and have them cook. That's certainly something I've never seen before!Then dessert - oh my - dessert. It was a honey walnut cake that reminded me very much of a variation of pineapple upside down cake paired with fig gelato. If you tried eating either by itself, you'd find that the cake is rather dry and the gelato super sweet but when paired together... Magic. Well done, Kellari Taverna.

Also, my scallop came out about 5-10 minutes after my three dinner partners' appetizers came out, which was really annoying. But it got better from there. The waiter (who was very nice, particularly after telling me that a beer I had inquired about, and then ordered based on his description, was a lager when it turned out to be a wheat ale) recommended the sea bass... at least I think that's what it was... I should really have reviewed this place sooner. Anyway, it was a whole fish, which was why I ordered it -- the meal at the previously mentioned steakhouse was piteously small and I wanted to make sure I got more food this time -- and it was delicious. I was really happy with it. It was crispy, tasty, and more than enough food. For dessert we all ended up ordering an almond cake that came with fig ice cream, which I was a big fan of. (If it were just the cake it wouldn't have been that great, but together with the ice cream it was really good.)Not sure if we'll go back here because it's an expensive restaurant, but that'd be the only reason if we didn't.",0,0,0,Jon L.,"New York, NY",4,72,3
4.0,8/7/2012,"DEEE-RISHUS!Restaurant Week was a great time to stop in for my first meal at Kellari -- a three-course meal for $35. Granted, Grandma was picking up the check anyway, but still...First of all, the place is HUGE. It's not a typical NYC restaurant that feels like you're on the subway crammed up to the strangers at the next table. There's plenty of space as the floor extends back past the bar for what feels like an entire city block. Notice the fresh fish as you head to your table; they're packed in ice and just waiting for you to reel them into your plate. And then your stomach.The calamari, which I started with, is not your typical breaded and fried dish. Instead, it's slowly baked in a decadent red wine sauce. I also tasted the seared scallop, which was very nice. Though it's known for its seafood offerings, I was in a chicken mood and got the roasted bird served over feta mashed potatoes. Really it was the potatoes that were calling my name. They didn't disappoint as they were creamy but not overly cheesy. I also tasted the trout, which was seasoned nicely and very good.For dessert, definitely go with the baklava. I had the vanilla custard wrapped in filo dough, and while it was good, the custard was a bit too mild for me. It had very little flavor. The baklava, though, was excellent, while the lemon tart was refreshing on a summer evening.Because of its midtown location, Kellari seems to be very popular with the business and theater crowd, so try to make a reservation if you can. It was empty when I entered at 5, but by 7 all the tables were full.Finally, unless you speak Greek, don't try to pronounce the items on the menu. Just point and say, ""I'll have this one."" Otherwise you'll sound like an idiot. Like I did.",5,6,7,Jonathan N.,"New Orleans, LA",1470,258,53

3.0,7/12/2012,"Well I went to this place last night for dinner, and the decor was amazing. The waitresses literally had to be flagged down to take your order, maybe I should wear an orange shirt next time(or light some rescue flares). I had the Octopus and found it to be a bit too oily for my liking, it made eating it a bit of a chore. The bread however was very nice, and the fact that they had live lobsters, where they actually kill the lobster right before you eat it is impressive. I had the Chocolata with ice cream for desert and found it to be a bit hard and dry for my liking, you essentially had to chisel it to eat it. The original desert order I had wanted wasn't available since the oven was out of order. The staff who ended up cleaning the table after dinner ended up sweeping the remnants of the table almost into mine and my friend's food. We had mentioned it to the staff and they graciously comped us dessert. My friend had a restaurant.com gift certificate which they flat out refused to honor, so we gave it to the table next to us in the hopes they could use it.

Although not new by any means, the restaurant is beautifully maintained and immaculately clean. A young co-worker and I both chose the three course $26.95 prix fixe lunch. I started with the Cretan meatballs, which our waiter assured us were hand rolled ""with love."" I have to agree with him. The three ovals were tender, sparked with cumin, and surrounded by a chunky tomato sauce. My main course was a daily special of baked halibut on a cold vegetable medley, including cauliflower, which is an atypical Greek ingredient. Dessert was galaktoboureko, a stiff custard wrapped in phyllo with an apple infused honey sauce. My companion had the spanikopita appetizer, the lobster ravioli (not exactly Greek either) and the baklava. Everything was well prepared, fresh and  generously portioned.Our server was delightful if a bit hyperbolic. He assured me that my dessert was the best in the universe, which, even if true, would be hard to quantify. But his enthusiasm was contagious and we felt well taken care of and well fed.

3.0,7/6/2012,"Readers Digest version:  Food A+.  Service C-The experience would have been much better if the server took one minute to explain the menu to us.  The fish is served fresh and prepared to order and priced per pound.  In most cases you need to share a fish with someone in your party due to the size.  No problem once we figured it all out, but be prepared to wait.  I have to say we all had an excellent meal and it was well worth the wait.  It is a seafood lovers paradise.Problem was with the service.  Our waitress, I'll call her Natasha because she was tall, blonde and very Russian-looking.  You had to beg her to come to our table.  She walked by us numerous times when we were ready to order or wanted service.  She was Miss Congeniality compared to the snooty somnolier who obviously wanted nothing to do with filling our wine glasses when he figured out we weren't ordering multiple bottles of $200 wine.  Why didn't he just leave the wine bottle in a chiller at our table?  Our wine glasses were frequently empty.  When he finally deigned to fill our glasses, he would just put in a splash and we would want a refill 5 minutes later!Bottom line:  If you want excellent seafood and are willing to put up with bad service and attitude, give it a try.  To me, I expect both good food and good service when I'm paying over $100 a head at a restaurant!",3,2,0,Mark B.,"Las Cruces, NM",7,28,1

And the wine list has a great selection of Greek whites that go perfectly with fish.

NOTE:  Although I have not had the chance to taste them, the Soutzoukakia meatball appetizer smelled fantabulous and the Salmon looked to die for.As for the Lobster Ravioli and Kavouri (Crabcake) Burger, I wouldn't order them again.  The ravioli was a meager portion of four raviolis, though they were delicious.  The crab cake came on a brioche bun AND side of french fries...talk about carbo overload.  After eating half of the plate I literally thought I was going to die.Always filled with classy business professionals, it's a great break during the work day.",2,1,0,Tanya G.,"Manhattan, NY",58,85,12

4.0,1/23/2012,"Went here with two friends during NY Restaurant Week 2012. We ordered Solomos (tartare of Atlantic salmon, fresh tarragon and chives) and Greek salad for the first course, Lavraki (bass with steamed wild greens), Seafood Yiouvetsi, and Paidakia (grilled lamb chops) for the main course. Can't remember what my two friends had for desserts, I had the Yiaourti meli (goat's milk yogurt). Kellari Taverna also had complimentary olives/ radish/ hummus & bread - I kind of wish it was warm pita bread instead, but maybe it was just me. The hummus was quite good. We all enjoyed the first courses very much. My Greek salad had just enough dressing, all veggies tasted fresh. My only complaint is that, I wish the veggies were cut into smaller chunks. I had a bite from my friend's Solomos and loved the salmon as well. Main course: - Lavraki: Good, but as others have pointed out, my friend had a problem with the tons of fishbones in there. Poor execution, I guess. - Paidakia: Also good, but not great. - Seafood Yiouvetsi: Same as above: good, but not awfully great. The amount of seafood was quite a lot and the portion was big - I couldn't finish all the orzo pasta. Desserts: - I LOVED my Yiaourti meli: Maybe it's just that I'm a sucker for yogurt, but here I really love the thick, dense, yet tart and sour yogurt, and it paired perfectly with the sour cherries preserves on the bottom. YUM!!!!Service: Could have been a bit better. There was quite a long waiting time between the first and second course. Also, the waitress mixed up and gave us the Pre-theater menu instead of the restaurant week menu only to grabbed it from us when we were about to order, only to come back and give us the pre-theater menu again... It wasn't such a big deal and we were all cool with that.Price: Not an everyday dinner place, obviously. Dinner for three people and a bottle of wine, plus tax, comes to about $210. Also, I think it's slightly ridiculous to charge an extra $4 for the Greek salad. I can understand for the lamb option, but Greek salad? Really?Overall: It was an above average experience. We enjoyed most of the dishes, loved the wine. Ambience was cozy and nice. I might pay Kellari Tavern another visit.",0,0,0,Maggie N.,"Durham, NC",3,108,38
1.0,1/20/2012,"I was part of the group of 10 that went to Kellari during NYC restaurant week (see reviews by Paul B. and Andy M. below). Having been to Greece several times, I know what good Greek food is supposed to be like so I suppose I had high expectations, especially considering the cost of the a la carte entrees ($25-30). We got off to an alright start... The restaurant is busy and bustling inside, nice atmosphere. While we were choosing our meals, we were given some nice rosemary bread. The piddly amount of olives were ok, served with mediocre hummus and a few raw radishes. Not very impressive, but I was optimistic about the meal.While looking at the menu, the waiter gave us a bit of a spiel about how the restaurants speciality was seafood, trying to upsell us on the a la carte menu...he was being a bit pushy, I felt, but fair enough. We asked him for a recommendation for the wine and he told us there was a bottle on special offer at $29 so we went for that one. The food took a while to arrive, I ordered scallops and pomegranate risotto to start. It was really disappointing. The scallops were overcooked, and the pomegranate risotto was a kind of grey, tasteless mush which I felt hadn't been seasoned at all. It wasn't inedible, it was just bland. For the main I went for the moussaka. It came with a tree (I'm not joking) of thyme shoved in the top and was so firm it was like it had been forced into a tray. It was about 50% beef - a sliver of aubergine, a tomato puree-like sauce and quite a lot of potato. It was almost rubbery and seemed like it had been microwaved. (I think you could have got a better moussaka from the supermarket and microwaved it yourself.) Again, not inedible but when you're at a restaurant which is meant to be ""fine dining"" and considering their normal prices, this was terrible. My boyfriend had a minuscule steak (served cooked all the way through) with a few sprouts scattered around, another friend had fish that was ""full of bones"". Desserts arrived and I had gone for baklava, which I love. Kellari's baklava tasted alright, but it had definitely not been prepared that day and was smothered in honey to make up for the hardness of the pastry. For a restaurant of its apparent reputation, the honey and almond baklava was really unadventurous - there are so many different varieties, with different flavours and textures, why go for the most boring, common style of all?Generally, I felt that the food at Kellari was boring, unadventurous, and not even authentic Greek. Even the things that they claim they are known for like the fish were disappointing. True, we had gone for the NYC restaurant week menu. However, isn't restaurant week about trying to entice customers to the restaurant, have a great time and come back again to spend a whole lot more money? Aside from this, there was the service. We were seated and the staff were courteous, but the servers kept spilling water when they were filling up our glasses and bumping into us. That is usually excusable, but when we received the bill (which we hadn't asked for, by the way), we found that we had been charged $49 for each bottle of wine (which was supposed to be on offer at $29). When we queried this, the waiter insisted that it had been $49 all along. We paid and left. I thought that was the end of it - but today, we all realised that though we had paid $70 per person that night, we had actually been charged $80.50! This is completely inexcusable! Never again!

1.0,1/20/2012,"I recently came here with a group of friends expecting a decent dinner, especially considering how I'm only financially capable of coming here via restaurant week and that this place was advertised as one of the best deals of restaurant week on various websites.Walking into the rustic venue, my expectations were a bit high, not Wylei Dufresne high, but a ""nice youtube video of food"" kind of high. We were seated at the back and given our menus; fine. We all went straight for the restaurant week menu and checked out the food. The ingredients looked good enough, so there shouldn't be a problem, unless the restaurant is more bark than bite.Unfortunately for us, that was the case. I'm too lazy to look up the foods that I ordered, but the description should be enough. For the first entree, I got a spinach pie with feta cheese. I thought it was ok aside from teh fact that the crust was supposed to be a soft, flaky one while the one I had was a bit tough. Flavor wise, it wasn't anything special--I'd expect to pay maybe 5 dollars for what I got. Of course, I was one of the lucky few; a couple of my friends got some sort of salad with 2 square pieces of trout totalling half the volume of the oldschool motorola razors.The second course essentially layers of alternating lamb and potato. I don't have anything bad to say about it aside from the fact that there was some kind of tomato sauce at the bottom that didn't do anything for the flavor (aka a waste of an ingredient), but I also don't have anything good to say either except that it was very filling. Then again, what else would you expect from starch?The dessert consisted of a chocolate torte with gelato. I got the gelato, but the torte was nowhere to be seen, unless a torte is supposed to be a block of hard, crumbly chocolate--but alas, it isn't.To top it all off, we ordered $30 bottle wines only to be charged $50 a bottle at the end. I didn't know that the restaurant was so hard pressed for money that they need to deceive their customers. What can they do, Manhattan IS expensive I suppose. I personally don't think it's a great way to keep a large consumer base.Finally, we ended the night with a nice bill only to realize a couple of days later that we were charged even more on our cards. Yes, this is only one occurrence out of how many that might have been on that day, but, either way, I won't be coming back.

1.0,1/20/2012,"After using Yelp a lot to read reviews of restaurants and bars, I have finally signed-up because I feel I need to warn people about Kellari.If you scroll down the reviews, you will see another review by Andy M (yelp.com/biz/kellari-tav…) - I was part of the group of 10 that went for restaurant week. Andy has given an introduction to the place, so I will cut right to the chase.First off, the restaurant week menu on the restaurant week site is not exactly the same as the one in the restaurant.The food was mediocre at best - edible but nothing special (nothing to go back for). For an appetizer, I had a the calamari in red wine and it was the best dish of my meal. It was stewed for a long time and so it was very tender.The bass I had for my entree (Lavraki) was okay. The bass was well cooked but nothing about it made me think that this typical of, or the best of, Greece; it could have been any bass from any restaurant that serves fish. And after the spiel at the beginning of the meal about Kellari's speciality being seafood, it was disappointing. The dessert (Karidopita - a honey and walnut cake with honey ice cream and fig gelato) was okay. The cake was dry so you needed the ice cream, but, as you can see from my description, the ice cream was honey and not fig. The fig 'gelato' was actually a fig syrup that surrounded the cake.If I was reviewing this restaurant solely on the food I might have given it three stars (I'm a generous person); however, I have yet to talk about the service...The general service was okay and I can even forgive the waiter for messing around with our dessert order (one minute they had the Karidopita, the next minute they had ran out, but then they found some more...). But I cannot forgive them for screwing us over with the bill. We ordered two bottles of $29 wine, which magically appeared on the bill as $49. Then, they have the cheek to charge an extra $10.50 on to our credit cards after we left. I will be disputing this extra charge and I will never go back to this restaurant (unless I wanted to punish someone and myself).If the aim of a restaurant week menu is to entice you back to try their regular menu then Kellari has failed miserably. Be warned.",5,0,0,Paul B.,"Bronx, NY",0,1,0
1.0,1/20/2012,"A group of 10 of us went here taking advantage of their NYC Restaurant week deal.  My understanding is that Restaurant week gives restaurants an oppertunity to showcase thier food to customers who may not usually choose their restaurant and want to try something different with a view that they will want to visit again at full price.  From past experience, i know not to expect the best things from the restaurant's menus but you can usually expect some good standard dishes.  I can confidently say that I doubt any of the 10 of us who visited will be returning to Kellari after this showing!It all started so well, great first impressions.  Restaurant looks very nice, and the menu looked good with more choice than you might usually get in NYCRW.  Bread and some small mezze arrived while we were choosing and the waiter suggested a greek wine special which he claimed at the time was $29 per bottle.  The wine was good so we ordered a few bottles between us.Then the food came...It was edible and all the ingredients listed on the menus were present however the taste wasn't.  For starters, my spinach & feta parcels were greasy and reminicent of pre-made samosas you can buy from service stations.  My girlfriend's scallops on pomegranite risotto which sounded great but was just two scallops on a pile of grey (with pink bits) bland mush. My friend who had the trout just commented that he was bored whilst eating it.My main was the beef tenderloin.  Two, small, thin cut, overcooked (in my opinion) medalions of beef served on a watery parsip mash and surrounded by overcooked, over horseradished sprouts (I love sprouts but this was just plain wrong!).  I was so hungry I just ate it without making a fuss but I was still very hungry afterwards.  The Moussaka, chosen by the majority of the table, looked like it had just come out of the microwave and apparently tasted that way too.  The Desserts were the only positive I could find.  Nice chocolate torte and I'm told the Baklava ""wasn't bad"".We got a bit of a shock when the check came an they had charged $49 (remember I said the waiter had claimed stated $29 earlier) for each bottle of wine and was adamant that he said that earlier.  And even worse when today we all discovered an extra $10.50 added to our credit card charges!!!!  We'll all be disputing this!Avoid this place like the plague (especially the NYCRW menu) and don't let the gloss and facade win you over.  If you fancy greek food, go out to Astoria",7,0,0,Andy M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0

5.0,2/21/2011,"4.5 starsFor my 200th (!) review, I wanted to Yelp someplace special. I just didn't think it would be Kellari, whose name has always led me to believe it's a high-end Irish bar. But after a delicious, boisterous, and lengthy dinner here with friends, I've got a new favorite Greek in midtown.From the outside, it looks like nothing. The inside is woody, almost Craftsman-like, high-ceilinged, bustling, and welcoming. On the way to our table we passed a generous bar, tables with families, couples on what looked like first dates, and a counter stocked with beautiful whole fish on a pristine bed of ice. Intriguing.Fortunately, our friends shared our anything-goes attitude about ordering. With some hand-holding from our genial and professional waiter, we decided to go for broke on the appetizers. Bring on the pikilia (4 spreads/dips: excellent), katsikisio saganaki (baked goat cheese with honey: we scraped the plate clean), crab cakes (disappeared before I could taste), skordalia (something involving beets). A nice bottle of Greek white, and we were pleasantly full.But you don't think we stopped there, right? No, no, we were walked (or maybe waddled) back to that intriguing fish counter, where we stood eye to eye with our entree options, while our waiter cheerfully discussed their relative merits and threw a few on the scale. We chose to share the fagri, a mild Mediterranean fish, which was simply grilled and deboned at the table. It was memorable--succulent and perfectly prepared. Throw in some lemony potatoes and another bottle of wine, and we were happy.So happy that we were still not willing to leave. Galaktoboureko--I don't care if you can't say it, just order it anyway. And the chocolate cake. And the yogurt cake. At this point, the waiter gave up on keeping track and started doling out coffee on the house.Here's my one negative: The price of the fish-by-the-pound will give you sticker shock. I recommend it anyway. It was superb and fed four people, but over $100 for a 3-pound piece of fish . . .  If you decide to go this route, tell the wait staff what your taste/price/appetite parameters are, and let them guide you.I've got to mention how welcoming and attentive the staff was. Maybe not refined, but it's not that kind of a restaurant. Kellari is  energetic, a little loud, big-hearted, and good-natured. If you've got something to celebrate (like having friends or being alive and employed), have I got a place for you.",3,1,2,Samantha S.,"New York, NY",202,913,0

2.0,1/7/2011,"""Meh"" is a word that perfectly sums up my experience here. It gets a star for the fact that Mitchell K. got 1,000 OpenTable points for making a reservation at 5:30 on a Sunday (before the Pee Wee Herman Show, which gets 4 stars!) and for a good pre-theater prix-fixe. Oh, and the big tray of olives at the bar is a nice touch. However, that's where the good ends. First off, neither of the wines we tried were all that great. Our waiter -- who had a classic New Yawk accent and kept referring to tap water as Bloomberg water -- was nice enough to provide M. with a different red since he wasn't digging the one the waiter recommended, but he didn't think it was much better. I got a salad and arctic char. The salad was very bland, the char serviceable. M's calamari app tasted a tiny bit too fishy for calamari.There's much better Greek in the theater district. Should've gone to Molyvos. Went to Uncle Nick's a couple weeks later and that was infinitely better.

Ever since that fateful day at Choptank that opened my eyes up to octopus I try it everywhere but this was certainly one of the best I've had in the city.  Went with the lamb chops for my main entree and they were also super tasty.

I had a bib salad and an orzo with tomato sauce with shrimp and a couple of mussels. Very cheap on the fish for $30, imo, and not hot when I got it.

5.0,9/24/2010,"I just got back from dinner at Kellari and I am really in love with this taverna. My friend was worried there would be a problem because we didn't make reservations beforehand but there was no problem and we were seated right away. I had never been to an upscale restaurant before so I was really hesitant and kind of intimidated when she first suggested Kellari but, let me tell you: not pretentious at all. We had great service, which really put me at ease. I forget our waiter's name (I'm sorry! I'm bad with  names!) but if you go on a Friday night around 7pm, he is the waiter with the salt and pepper hair :) He was really funny and nice. I ordered the Corfu Shrimp and my friend ordered the Salmon dish. She said, ""It's a big portion. I'm a big eater and I get really full.""  You don't know me, but I can eat like there is no tomorrow so of course, I was overjoyed by her comment. It was at this point that we decided against getting a starter, and I really appreciated that our waiter didn't push us to get one either. Okay so our dishes arrive and ... they didn't LOOK like big portions. Well, peeps, looks can be deceiving because, initially, I ate slowly to savor the dish (which was freaking delicious) but by the third shrimp and forkful of asparagus and oyster risotto, I thought it was one of those never-ending dishes and started to panic at the thought of not being able to finish. No worries, I ate every last thing off the plate. Between our dishes and the complimentary bread and dish of radishes, hummus and olives (LOVE olives!), I was ready to be rolled out the door...or at least unbutton my slacks. Neither happened but one of my shirt buttons came undone from my bloated belly... There was a birthday at the next table and our waiter brought out a little dessert with a candle on it for the birthday girl. She looked like she was enjoying herself and it made me think about how great it must be to be at Kellari tonight, with all the right elements for a great night, and on your birthday, nonetheless.My friend asked for the check while I was in the bathroom. It was brought over to us promptly. I was there to receive it when she went to the bathroom and the woman handing me the check said she was surprised to hear we weren't ordering dessert and brought over a dish of cookies for us, and asked if we'd like some coffee or cappuccino. It was such a sweet gesture. Between her and our waiter, I felt like they were concerned relatives who wanted to make sure we were eating enough. Makes my heart burst with happiness!We lingered after our table was cleared to chat and once more to finish the plate of cookies. I was amazed that no one rushed us to leave. Additionally, we were talking about some heavy stuff, which I'm always wary of wading into at public establishments, but I was really surprised at how private and intimate our little table felt.I am really, genuinely looking forward to going back to Kellari... maybe for my birthday? ;) If you can afford it, and you're looking for a good place to eat, I suggest giving Kellari a try.

We took up a large section in the back of the restaurant, separated by a wine rack. Our choices for drinks were red or white wines, and I was the strange one who asked for champagne. The waiter went to the bar to get a glass for me, which was greatly appreciated.Once seated, we were given a special menu, which explained all of the appetizers being put in front of us (I sampled the meatballs, which were just okay, and the tzatziki, which I greatly enjoyed). We had a choice of entrees, and I chose the chicken breast. It was cooked perfectly, but didn't have a great amount of flavor. For dessert, we were brought some Greek cookies, a platter that included some pastries and cheesecake, and a fruit platter. It was a LOT of food.Our server was quite attentive, especially considering how large of a group we had. I'd be interested in trying this place again, for an actual meal instead of a rehearsal dinner. My biggest gripe with this place was the bathroom.

We tried ordering a bottle of wine from their extensive and impressive wine list.  Unfortunately, the first 3 bottles of Chardonnay we tried to order were unavailable!  We finally just gave up and opted for the house wine.  After all this, the taste in my mouth was not good.  .....that leads me to THE MEAL.  My food was SO GOOD.  I had the special- a pan seared swordfish over a bed of spinach risotto drizzled with white clam sauce and topped with goat cheese.  The fish was a little dry but overall the meal was delicious.  DESSERT- The baklava almost tasted like my mother's.  It was a bit dry but definitely authentic.  I'd recommend it if you're going to eat here.

3.0,8/2/2009,"I love Greek food, so I'm always willing to try a new Greek place. We went during Restaurant Week, so we knew we'd get a good deal, and I was very happy with the offerings at Kellari. Half of the Restaurant Week entree menu was seafood, as to be expected, with one chicken, one veg, and one lamb dish on offer besides.We got there at the slightly early hour of 6:30, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that the place had a good volume of people, especially for a stormy Friday evening. I started with a really nice beet salad, which had the prerequisite spicy arugula greens, but the kicker was an unexpected cross between tzatziki and skordalia, heaped in the middle; just enough to loosely dress everything on the plate. My moussaka was, regrettably, ordinary, with a little too much mealiness from the base of potato, and not enough creaminess. My dinner date had the lamb-and-potato dish, which she says she enjoyed. For dessert, I had fruit and greek yogurt. It's hard to mess that up, honestly, and they didn't. Kellari has extended their restaurant week to September, so do come in and take advantage of their solid fare, but stay for--and enjoy--the terrific ambiance and the really nice service. The restaurant is fairly dimly lit, and on a stormy night, I'd have rather had a little more lighting, so i could see my food and my friend.

My wife and I had arrived early and started ordering some apps and wine. I had asked the waiter to close the check when my friends arrived and he informed me that he is unable to do that. I asked why and he said because the system doesn't allow it, but he said he would see what he could do. That was one of the most ridiculous things I had ever heard in a restaurant. Our group proceeded to have dinner and when it was time to get the check, he brings a check that is split in some convoluted, illogical way. He said that was the best he could do.

I'm a big fan of Pylos and Thalassa, but we were looking for a midtown location close to our work, hence we figured Kellari Taverna would be a perfect choice. The atmosphere was lively/electric and decor was beautiful, however, that's the only good thing I can say about the restaurant. The service was so-so and I was disappointed in the food. Given that the bill was over $130 + tip, you would certainly expect much better.To start, we ordered the angus meatballs and calamari. The meatballs were rich in flavor, I'll say that. The calamari was slightly a step above the quality found at a Jersey diner (maybe I'm just spoiled and had some great calamari at those diners? haha)For my main course I ordered the black sea bass. It tasted fresh, however, the way it was cooked almost eliminated any flavor. It tasted very dull for my palate. The presentation was nothing special.For dessert we shared the baklava. Although good, it was not much better than the baklava that you can find in Astoria.As a restaurant alone, I would have given it 3 and a half stars. However, given its price and other Greek choices in the city, it's with regret that I give Kellari Taverna only 2 stars and if you're looking for a Greek restaurant in midtown, I suggest Milos instead.",0,0,1,Gary R.,"New York, NY",34,38,2

3.0,1/14/2009,"Kellari Taverna is a beautiful Greek restaurant in midtown.  A large wooden sign above the entrance way greets you with the motto, ""Enter as strangers, leave as family"".  While I scoffed at this cheesy slogan upon my entrance, I really did feel differently as I left the building later in the evening.  The large L-shaped bar was full of people sipping large glasses of wine and sampling authentic (and free!) Mediterranean cheeses, breads, and olives.  This communal snacking experience relaxed the highbrow mood given off by the high ceilings, classy decor, and stuffily dressed business diners.  The wine list was spectacular and included many by-the-glass options, like the sweeter Cabernet and Tempranillo.  Though we had a reservation at the packed restaurant, the hostess graciously let us postpone our seating to enjoy some wine and cheese at the bar.  All we had to do was approach her an hour later, and we were immediately granted another table.  The service was very accommodating throughout the evening, and the manager even stopped by to check on the meal.With all of this praise, I am sure you are wondering about my 3 star review.  I would definitely rate this as more of a three and a half star, but, regardless, I just felt the food could have had a bit more flavor and a bit less sauce/spice.  When I go to Avra a few blocks away, I am greeted with simple but fresh ingredients.  I felt that Kellari spent too much time overcompensating with the seasoning.  The Kellari Octapodi (grilled octopus salad) appetizer was a bit too oily and oniony.  The imported whole Lavraki  (mild Mediterranean bass) was fresh, but bland.  The Plaki (Chilean sea bass) was served in a dense tomato sauce with onions, capers, and potatoes.  The fish was ironically drowning in a sea of bland tomato goo, and I could do little to save it...I was frustrated that their food took on such extremes - either boring or too intense; there was nothing that was ""just right"".  Well, until we arrived at the dessert course, that is.  The Bougatsa was composed of a sweet semolina and ricotta custard wrapped egg roll style in a crisp cinnamon phyllo dough.  It was accompanied by a scoop of fig ice cream so realistically full of fig essence that it even contained large pieces of the seasonal fruit within it.  My friend and I celebrated the meal with a group of her friends who I barely knew.  As we sampled each other's dishes, we bonded and really left as friends as the sign suggested.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere, menu selections, service, and reasonable prices of Kellari.  I just wish they were better able to enhance the true flavors of their dishes.",0,0,0,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

4.0,10/12/2008,"For a Greek place that specializes in seafood, my review may disappoint, because neither my wife nor I are big fish-eaters.  What we did eat was quite excellent, though.  The wife had kotopoulo, an herbed chicken dish, while I had the Corfu shrimp.  She said that of everything we had, it was perhaps the most ordinary, but that says more about the other dishes.  The shrimp was not heavily flavored also, but that's the idea behind most of their seafood - let the diner taste what is being served, rather than load it up with seasoning.   Most of their fish is cooked simply, so you can taste the fish.  The oyster and asparagus risotto with my shrimp was fabulous, though.  Let's back up a minute to the appetizers.  The bread was your typical sponge-y Greek bread, served with olives of varying strength and red pepper hummus.  Then move on the the Greek salad.  I've rarely had tomatoes that savory, including some orange tomatoes (they probably have a name, but I don't know).  The ""authentic"" saganaki was superb, but eat it while hot/warm.  It arrives flaming from Metaxa, but when it cools, it gets pretty gritty.  On to dessert - the baklava is discussed elsewhere, and I agree, it was dry.  There isn't any honey cooked in, but there is plenty on the plate, so just moosh it around.  The galactoboureko was quite yummy.  Get the Moroccan mint tea - you get a teapot that contains well over two cups worth, so save a buck and share a pot.  But by then, you've probably spent your shirt anyway.  I'm a little baffled about the service complaints.  We went on a Saturday night, right before a show, probably their busiest time.  We barely sat down before the sommelier asked us what type of water we would like.  Our waiter was excellent, attentive and amusing, in a professional way.  Like the way he brought me my second glass of wine ""just when you were about to lose all hope.""  Cute.  Fast service; we weren't waiting for any courses.  Pricey place, though.  I dropped just a little less here for two people than our hotel room rate for one night.  Worth an annual visit for us out-of-towners who love Greek food (and can't get any around here!!!)",3,2,4,Bob K.,"Livermore, CA",78,293,228

But, here's the kicker.  2 people having a Greek meal for over $150 with tip etc should expect far better than just OK.  In a city with a million other choices, I can go elsewhere.  I will.No offense intended, Kellari.  Its not you, its me.Thus the search continues.",3,3,1,Chris C.,"New York, NY",218,367,17

The interior is warm and inviting, but not much of the ambiance is Greek-inspired save for the massive bowl of olives at the bar and the occasion snippets of background music.

1.0,3/22/2008,"What can I say about Kellari Taverna? The decor and atmosphere are very nice. Visually it is everything depicted in the TV commercials on the Greek cable TV channel Ant1 (for those of us who are Greek). You are promised an amazing meal and wonderful evening. But promises fall short sometimes and fall they did for me. I went there a few weeks ago with my three best friends to celebrate a milestone in one of their lives. Even though it is located on the west side of 5th Avenue on 44th street this is definitely an Upper East Side place with some Upper East Side Greeks to match; mixed with scatterings of tourists from the hotels on the same street. I walked in to find two of my best friends at the bar enjoying what they raved about as being one of the best glasses of red wine they've had in a long time. Accompanying their wine was a monstrously glorious block of white cheese.  There was also a wooden bowl with about 2 pounds of delicious black and green olives glistening in olive oil and brine. What I would have done to keep that joy going throughout the rest of the evening's gastronomic journey. We were brought to our table and served a plate of olives, pickled radishes and ""hummus"" - avoid their hummus. SABRA is the best brand out there. I have no problems paying any price for good food, ANY PRICE.  But after reviewing the menu we silently decided to only do entrees because the appetizers and salads seemed unexciting and overpriced.  Though the entrees were pricey that is part of what you pay for at an UES restaurant. Appetizers and salads were about $12 and up and entrees ranged from $27 and up. We ordered fish dishes all around. I got the Seafood Yuvetsi and my friends got grilled salmon. ""Kellari is known for seafood"" raved our waitress, who was attentive and friendly.  I'm glad I got the yuvetsi though - especially since it was the only Greek sounding thing on the fish menu. Within minutes we were served our food in oversized dishes (didn't that go out of style yesterday?). My food looked great but tasted OK. The jumbo shrimp and the clams and mussels (about 2 each) promised a taste of pure ocean delight. Too bad they were cold. The whole dish was about room temperature. Being an avid foodie and cook I am 110% certain that the seafood was not even cooked in the Yuvetsi. It was if the seafood and the yuvetsi mixture were combined later on since I could not taste any infusion of flavors in the seafood.  . I don't remember anyone at the table ""wow-ing"" over their meals. I finally tried a bit of someone's grilled fish - SAME...room temperature.  Coming from a restaurant family I know you never serve lukewarm dinner or cold fish.  I didn't send it back because I didn't want to put a damper on the evening in any way. During the meal my eyes were drawn to the exposed kitchen. There was something that I could not put my finger on. WAIT A MINUTE! There was no real action going on in the exposed kitchen!!! It was very quiet. I could see the restaurant manager (I assume) was chatting with the chef and that was all. I guess the action takes place behind the wall in the real kitchen. I imagined the front is where all their dishes are sent to wait in warmers for customers to do them the favor of saving them from their lukewarm hell.Deserts!  Everything was $8.95. I can't fathom paying $8.95 for ice cream or a slice of cake or rice pudding. We opted not to have any but the waitress gave us a plate of complimentary Greek cookies - melomakarona, kourabiethes, and koulourakia. We finally ""ooohed"" and ""ahhed over something!  I wondered what Astoria bakery they were from. After the meal and all through the next day I repeated my food. I had the worst metallic taste in my mouth! The feeling of wanting to ""wretch"" was a big part of the following day.  I went to visit mom for some good ole comforting food which expelled the demonic Kellari aftertaste!! Thanks mom!!!! Look if you want to have a $10 glass of red wine at their bar, go. Gorge yourself on their olives and cheese and then take the train to Astoria for a true Greek meal and Greek experience!!!!",1,1,1,Dimitris V.,"New York, NY",7,60,0
3.0,2/13/2008,"This is the second time i have tried Kellari and it is PUSHING it to give it 3 stars.  One star is just for location, because it is not totally touristy and crappy for the location and one is for the olives (but sit at the bar if you really want these - otherwise you're at the whims of the server) and the third...dunno i guess the third is for the company i shared while there.The sardines where mediocre to horrible; they where not fresh, with a smell like wharf-scrapings and a slightly dry consistency.  Grilled sardines should not be fishy if fresh or definitely NOT to the point where we were unable to lean over the table until the plates where cleared.The Spanicopita was mediocre at best (especially for a GREEK rest) there was way too much filo so they where dry,tough and bland. Also the philo triangle style is easier than the pan style of you are serving a baht mitsvah of 300, but in a Greek restaurant, take the time and make a whole tray, the slices are ALWAYS better.Third; the wine list (while seemingly extensive) is mostly disgustingly overpriced sub-par tipple fortified by some jaw-droppingly overpriced decent wine.  i bought a $40 nebiolo from Italy (sorry Greek wine is NOT terribly good and it's HIGHER than the Italian/French/Spanish at this place WTF??!!) and it was terrible. If i had bought it for the $6retail in a liquor shop, i would have poured it out - ick",1,0,1,Furyk C.,"Albuquerque, NM",325,246,50

BUT... and BIG BUT here... I was so not impressed with the food.  Nothing tasted like it should have.  Greek meatballs taste pretty much the same where ever you go... fried calamari and the cold dips too... but not here.  I felt that they tried to hard to ""fancy up"" the food.  if you want really good Greek venture into Astoria.  It's so worth it.",0,0,0,Athena ..,"Williston Park, NY",0,6,2

The bartender recommended a bottle of white wine that was light and refreshing, he was helpful but it was hard to get his attention. We then ordered the meatballs, grilled calamari and the spanakopita. All were great and hit the spot. I'm sure dinner would be Delicious but if you only did this, you'd leave happy. Also, the room was lovely and I loved all the fresh fruit as decoration.

3.0,8/20/2007,"I went for a business dinner. Our waitress was very nice but she was not informed about the wine and she recommended us a Greek wine which was really very disappointing even tough we asked for the sommelier. I don't expect the waitress know about the wine and they should be really careful about their recommendation at this level of restaurants. I don't mind this kind of situation in a casual dinner/lunch but it is important for business dinner with important people. Food-wise, the mezedes were good. Especially Katsikisio is very successful. Plevrakia which is lamb riblets was good. I ordered Paidakia, lamb chops as a main course. It was not tasty at all. If you put those lamb chops in front of a Greek, he/she probably throws to your head. Especially for that price, it was a shame. Anyway, the decoration is comfortable, people are friendly and nice, but I would not go again probably.",1,0,1,Can O.,"New York, NY",5,11,0
4.0,7/17/2007,"Have been there once, I ordered lamb burger and it was good, the girl I went with had a frozen tomato in her salad, not the best thing to happen.  Another girl from work goes there all the time and likes the Greek salad and grilled calamari every time and loves it.I went her again for a business lunch and had a more diverse meal and everything was very good.  We started with a tzatziki  and pita, it was nice thick Greek yogurt and very tangy.  We also had sea bass fritters that we on a bed of hummus, they were lightly fried and very tasty.  For lunch I had lamb salad, it was served with fried eggplant chips, and a Greek baba ganoush.  It was really good.  The Greek baba ganoush was rich, smoky and tasty.  Than lamb was cooked well.I am glad that I came here again, the overall meal was very good, and improved the first review I gave itThe service was a little spotty, but the entire restaurant was packed for lunch.The restrooms are tucked away to the left of the bar and offer roomy private stalls.  Clean and stocked, a nice restroom situation, 4.5 Flushes.",0,0,0,Chip S.,"New York, NY",29,332,20
4.0,7/15/2007,"So after getting off the train and leaving my hotel, I want something fast and good but also yummy.  Kellari looked like the place for me! I was given a prime table and the host attended to my needs quickly.  He asked me if I wanted a drink and I asked him to choose for me- I was too tired to make a selection!  He came over with a wonderful Fume Blanc (in capital letters b/c it was good!).  I ordered oysters.  This was a stretch for me because, after getting HORRIBLE food poisoning in Paris from oysters, I usually skip this course.  But I took a big gulp and went for it.  Very nice quality and quite fresh.The steak, on the other hand, was not.  I like my meat medium rare.  This came out raw on one side, cooked to burnt on the other.  (Still not sure how that can happen).  The menu said the beef was prime.  No way.  Not this beef.  And it wasn't a NY strip either, but some other tough-as-hell piece of shoe leather.  The ambiance was nice.  Sit by the front doors if you can.  Oh, and eat the picked radishes and olives they bring to snack on before dinner.  Yum!",1,0,1,Tova S.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,50,0
3.0,7/9/2007,"Okay I love the ambiance. It's a cross between a library, wine cellar and drawing room. The lighting is gentle and cast shadows that promise a great night. The Mezedes were excellent and the traditional Greek method of sharing is a great way to start the evening. My roasted beet salad with arugula and goat cheese was marvelous. Alas, my grilled Dover sole was not. It came warm not hot and had been cooked too soon.  The service is superb and every detail is covered.  Maybe next time they will get the grill right.",2,0,1,David D.,"Shelburne, VT",10,52,0
4.0,7/2/2007,"If you like fish, this is the place for you (don't worry, there are meat options for the non-fish eaters).  Kellari has a fairly extensive menu of fresh caught whole fish (a few imported choices) that is generally grilled and deboned.  For an appetizer, try the Katsikisio (warm goat cheese baked with dried apricots, metaxa & almond) - this delicious blend of flavors spread on a toasted baguette whets your appetite for the upcoming courses.  For the main course, I tried the Tsipoura (imported from the Mediterranean) a royal dorado with a mild flavor.  Top it all off with sokolata (chocolate souffl & halva mousse) for dessert and you have yourself a very nice meal.  Kellari is good for groups and service is very attentive.",1,0,1,Diana N.,"NY, NY",73,646,0
4.0,5/7/2007,"Upscale, businessy place. Excellent food and waitstaff are delightfully entertaining.

3.0,12/13/2006,"I didn't eat dinner here, let me throw that out right up front.  I was alone, between work and an evening panel discussion, and wanted a nice glass of wine and a snack.  If you're in or around Times Square and prefer the businessmen crowd to the tourist crowd and are looking for a good glass of wine and some snacks, then try Kellari.  There were at least 10-12 wines by the glass per classification (red/white) and my Cote du Rhone was lovely, as were the other choices I saw. It was so nice to have a by-the-glass selection rather than a pick the best of the possible worst bottles in the house that you usually see.  As far as I can tell at this point, most Yelpers are frugal.  So, kids, listen up: if you're looking for snacks you get FREE snacks at the bar here! And, I'm not talking peanuts and pretzels.  There are heaping mounds of mixed black and green olives, crostini and cheese piled up on massive platters.  And, you can help yourself and though I didn't gorge, the bartender was so busy she didn't mind that I was substituting the snacks for dinner.  Usually I like martinis for their dual role of dinner and a drink but this was nice to have olives on my plate and a lovely glass of wine.",5,1,1,Stephanie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",61,93,2

We went to Kellari for the pre-theater special which is an appetizer, main course, and dessert for $30. Much like Restaurant Week. I had the Spanakopita for the appetizer, Solomos (salmon) for the entree, and Baklavas for dessert. Everything about it was delicious. Outstanding in fact. The waiter recommended a Greek wine that resembled a pinot grigio in flavor but was so much richer and better than I thought wine could be. They sang happy birthday to my housemate which was so cute and unexpected in such a nice establishment. My water was refilled before I even realized it needed to be.

4.0,8/7/2006,"""Enter as Strangers, Leave as Friends""So says the sign above the door of Kellari Taverna.  This Greek restaurant is a welcome addition to W. 44th Street - a street with many hotels but limited restaurant options.  Only 6 months old, it seems like it is already doing a decent amount of business.The space is enormous and well-designed - with big tables and soft lighting - appropriate for a business dinner, pre-theater dinner or a central location to meet a friend.  It also looks like a great place to accommodate a large group.  The staff couldn't be more nice.  From the moment we walked through the door, we were treated with a warmth that is usually experienced only at small, family-owned restaurants, and it seems that they are eager to show off their talents in the kitchen. And talented they are - the menu is full of mouth-watering dishes, either classically Greek or modern versions of the classics.It was a hot, humid night after a grueling 12-hour workday, so my dining companion and I needed some TLC and a healthy light meal.  It was exactly what we were looking for.  I tried one of the Greek wines, Stelios Kenkris, which was rich and not too heavy - not terribly complex, but a good table wine.  Once I had a sip of that, accompanied by the bean pepper spread, bread and olives that they put out at the start of your meal, I instantly felt better.For my meal, I had the Ocopodi and the Green Prasini salad.  Octopodi is a dish of grilled octopus that was absolutely wonderful - huge chunks of tender, smoky octopus with peppers and onions is a savory marinade.  Such a large portion I was struggling to finish it.  My salad was a mix of baby greens and herbs, dressed with a light lemon yogurt dressing, and garnished with sliced tomatoes.  Refreshing and delicious, and again, a very generous amount. I will definitely be back to try the flaming cheese, a grilled whole fish (they offer many varieties), or one of their braised meats.  Bring your appetite and check out this new restaurant.  They are on Open-Table, which is a nice convenience.  Appetizers range from $8-10, small plates from  $13-15, and dinner from $25-30.  Since the serving sizes are so big, it would be a good choice to share plates and get the full range of flavors.",5,0,4,Liz S.,"Portland, OR",719,1061,884
