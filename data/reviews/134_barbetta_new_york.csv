2.0,4/13/2019,"I knew it wasn't going to go well when our drinks, a martini and a Manhattan, arrived cool and not bracingly cold. And stingy Barbetta leaves out the cherry in the Manhattan. Saves them five cents, I guess.With our reservation at 6 p.m., Barbetta only trotted out the pre-fixe, pre-theater menu. This was prescient, perhaps, but it meant no-work for the kitchen, and it tasted like it, resembling a ""$10.95 complete dinner special"" at a a diner or low-grade chain restaurant, except, being NYC, it was $58. Oh, one entree was filet mignon, so they tacked on an extra $10, which my fellow diner said was nothing she couldn't have made at home. I had the other beef dish, described as ""the tenderest beef"", which it was; it was simply pot roast in gravy, as you'd find at a cafeteria steam table. Mine came with polenta --- whoopy doo --- and a rubbery polenta ""chunk."" With a little ceremony they brought us rosemary-studded rolls and breadsticks. The rolls, in a City renowned for great bread, were ordinary and a little stale; the breadsticks were obviously out of a package and had the character of being made of sawdust. Inedible. Salads were nice and green, but got mixed reviews. Mine, despite the menu note of Barbetta's use of ""very little salt"", seemed quite salty; my fellow diner said hers was only faintly dressed and therefore no adverse comment. The dessert I had also could've been bought from an average supermarket bakery. 'Twas the hazelnut torte with a pool of a sort of whipped cream. Meh. My companion had the lemon-pistachio torte, which she enjoyed. I expect excellent coffee in a restaurant like this; it wasn't ""bad"" at all, just so undistinguished that we both only drank half a cup. Service was very good overall. Real silverware. The ""renowned"" decor was sad, like an old funeral parlor. Heavy drapes on the windows, an industrial floor as in a mall food court, and the ceiling was acoustic tiles, like you'd have in your refinished basement from the 1960's. The old iron chandeliers did not distract from the plastic potted plants on the tables or the plastic potted trees all around the dining room. At these prices, Barbetta can't afford fresh flowers and real trees?Cut the tombstone for Barbetta. This place is headed for the mortuary.",0,1,0,Chris M.,"Riverside, NJ",0,82,0
4.0,3/8/2019,"The decor may be a time capsule but the pasta is super fresh! And needless to say, amidst the relentless restaurant churn of NYC, it's hugely satisfying to find a restaurant that cleaves to its own past. The menu lists the year when each dish was introduced, from early 1900s to the last few years--a boon for food history nerds and a fun x-factor in deciding what to order. Great service, too.",0,0,0,Grace B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,51,1

1.0,12/8/2018,Pre theater menu was 58 dollars for some biscotti an app an entree a salad and a dessert and coffee or tea. The biscotti was terrible. the app was a quarter of a plate but good. The entree was delicious. I had the swordfish but it came with nothing except sauce. The dessert creme brulee was awful and I love creme brulee so it was disappointing to say the least. The salad was 6 pieces of lettuce with store brand vinaigrette. My tea wasnt brewed and was almost completely just water. The service was inexperienced and understaffed. The bill took 20 minutes to get and another 15 to get back. This place is overpriced. Food is good but it's a terrible value.,1,0,0,Matthew S.,"Beechhurst, NY",3,9,0
5.0,11/3/2018,"Absolutely love this place! We arrived early and they let us in before the restaurant was open. The hostess Melissa was fabulous, as was Gus the bartender. The wine list was fantastic, as were the drinks. As we waited they served us delicious smoked salmon canapés. When seated we were served this delicious Parmesan biscotti. With garlic breadsticks and rosemary rolls. The beet salad and roasted pepper appetizers were fabulous as were the main courses of swordfish and crabmeat. For dessert we shared chocolate mousse, creme brûlée and pistachio lemon tart.

1.0,10/13/2018,"This was our second time there and it was nothing like it was 5 years ago. The menu was anemic and pricy for the small portions served. Their wine list was one of the largest and over priced ones I have ever seen, which tells you where their interest are. The waiters were snooty and curt when we asked questions refarding the menu. With so many restaurants along the same block of West 46th, don't waste your time and money here.

1.0,7/5/2018,"I made a reservation to come here for lunch with my mother for a celebratory lunch. We were both looking forward to it. From opposite ends of the city, on a hot day, we arrived at our destination.... to find it closed. And it wasn't a last-minute emergency closure either. They were closed for holidays. What on earth?! They took my reservation, no problem, less than a week ago. Later today I found that, yes, a couple of hours before our lunch reservation I had a missed call from the restaurant. But I was at work (unlike, ahem, these guys, I had actually showed up to do my job) and didn't see the call come in. And they didn't even try again? And they only bothered to call just before we were supposed to show up anyway? And what were they doing taking reservations during a scheduled closure in the first place? What a waste of our time. We trekked around in the wasteland that is Theatre District, Yelping to find somewhere that wasn't a variation on Applebees. I had heard great things about the garden here in particular, but if this place is such a hot mess, I'm not at all convinced I want any further experience of it.",0,0,0,Claire W.,"Manhattan, NY",35,28,0
3.0,7/3/2018,"Very pretty, cute and nostalgic.  Would go again for the outside patio and have a drink.  Not crowded and that is a plus.  However, more interested in chatting with the table than serving.  The waiter forgot our salads and our appetizers.  Brought dinner out before appetizers and then during dessert never asked if we needed coffee. Had to track someone down.  The food was also not fantastic.  Very basic and two entrees were on the cold side instead of steaming hot.  Liked the décor and wine menu.  But the talking and chatting seemed more on the order of a comedy show.  Also, they pushed the prix fixe menu on us to get us out.  We were not seeing a show and they seemed very disturbed we would not be sticking to the menu of their choice.",1,0,0,M M.,"Trenton, NJ",0,19,0
5.0,6/30/2018,"We greatly enjoyed our first dinner here. We ate in the garden, which is very tranquil. The main dining room also seemed very attractive and has a piano player.The $58 pre-theater menu of starter, entree, salad, dessert and coffee is a reasonable value, especially for the theater district, with ample portions and many choices. The pasta starters, salad, swordfish and pork entrees, dessert and coffee were all very good and we are picky. The a la carte menu is not as good a value.The restaurant occupies 2 former town houses, both of which are over 130 years old. Do not expect a trendy space, but it is not a stuffy atmosphere. Yes, the staff is formally dressed, but they are quite friendly and accommodating.",1,1,2,David M.,"Westfield, NJ",107,684,0
4.0,6/29/2018,"We went on a week night before a show.  The dining room is old school ""fancy"" per our teen daughters, who were rather impressed.  We skipped the pre-theater fixed price option and ordered off the menu.  My vegetarian heart was pleased with the risotto sampler and the teens loved the homemade gnocchi.  The best part was the lovely gentleman of a certain age who completely spoiled us.  I regret that I'm terrible with names but he cannot be missed - very well dressed and with an amazing personality.  He's been working there for decades and entertained us with stories about famous guests and his life in NYC.   I would go back just to chat with him.  The food is excellent, service stellar, and worth the price",0,0,0,Jinda A.,"Charlotte, NC",0,2,0
4.0,6/26/2018,"This place is definitely upscale and has a very distinct old timer charm to it. You could see the opulence from the moment you walked it-- the main room is gorgeous. I went for a business lunch around 12:30p, and it was pretty empty as no one was in the main room. They have a small outdoor area where a few patrons were seated.We were a party of 5, and to start we ordered two of the samplers. Unfortunately, as a vegetarian there was nothing in the sampler for me so I couldn't try it but everyone else at the table enjoyed it. I ordered a frappé of melons as a drink to start, and it's exactly what they say it is! A refreshing drink on a hot summer day. As my main, I had the pesto linguine. It was good but lacked a little in terms of salt/pepper which I easily added on my own. Dessert was my favorite part! We ordered three different desserts and shared -- chocolate mousse, espresso chocolate cake, and lemon pistachio tart. The servers were awesome! They brought over complimentary glasses of Riesling and a torta di nocciole when they brought over the desserts we ordered. Everything was delicious, but my favorite was the espresso chocolate cake. It was actually a little cloudy the day we went, and even starting raining a bit while we were dining outdoor. The servers were very attentive and put two umbrellas up right away to shield us, which covered us sufficiently. Seems like a great place for a date night, so I'll be back at some point !",0,0,1,Dipika A.,"Jersey City, NJ",23,74,150
1.0,4/25/2018,"I would like to start by saying, I have thought about what would be most helpful in my review of this particular restaurant.  First, I want to say, during my week stay in Manhattan, my friend and I tried many different cuisines from different cultural backgrounds, and from different parts of the city.  We loved it all.  New York is an amazing place, the people are genuine, and I loved every second of it......except for this one restaurant.  We decided to eat at Barbetta 45 minutes before a theater show, and the ""hostess"" at the front door was shockingly rude.  She literally looked me and my friend up and down and asked us if we wanted to look at the menu first.  Seriously?  What was she referring to?  Did she really think we couldn't afford it? We weren't dressed to the nines, but we were dressed nicely. My friend had jeans on and a nice coat, but they were beautiful ""one of a kind"" jeans....Vera Wang, but painted by an artist who is an owner of a well-known boutique store in Carmel.  I know how much the jeans cost because I was there when she bought them this summer.  I wasn't in my highest end clothes, but we had been walking around beautiful NYC all day.  We averaged close to 30,000 steps each day, so needed decent walking shoes, and coats and scarves to keep us warm.  However, even so, I'm no slouch when it comes to fashion.  We looked nice, and no one in that restaurant was dressed better than we were.  Yes, I had a long black coat...but did I need to tell her the label?  Did I need to flash her my Versace bag that was carrying?  Not sure, but when we said we were in a little bit of a rush, she told us, ""we aren't fast food. No one will be able to serve you this quickly before a show.   You want fast food"".  I told her we, in fact, did NOT want fast food, but could we possibly sit at the bar and order some soup and salad or something else?  She flat out refused, and when my friend started to walk toward the bar, the hostess stepped in front of her to BLOCK her.  You heard me right.  She blocked her.  We ended up leaving, and a little shocked.  I'm not sure why my friend was blocked.   Was it because my friend is a Latina?  So, 30 seconds later, after we exited the building, I thought to myself, ""no way...I'm going back in there and finding out how much these prices are.""  So, I marched back in and in my nicest, professional voice, I asked to see the menu for future reference, in the event that we could come back with enough time to dine there.  She looked at me a little funny, but reluctantly agreed to show me the menu, so I followed her in the restaurant.  She showed me two menus.  One was a pre-fixed menu, and one was a regular menu, with entries, starters, salads, etc.  I saw on the regular menu that there was soup and salad.  My friend came back in the restaurant at that point.  I asked the hostess if we could order some starters or soup, salad, etc.  She vehemently stated no....that it was only the prefixed menu that night.  The prefixed menu was $58.  Ok fine.  We've paid a lot more at other restaurants that were much more prestigious.  We've dined at Michelin star rated restaurants.   That's not even really the point.  The point is, for some reason, she didn't want to serve two girls that were hungry, who could more than afford her stuffy restaurant, and who were dressed casual, but appropriately, and tastefully.  She just didn't want to serve us.  Me, being a Human Resources executive (in the high-tech industry) wonders, was it a racist/discrimination reason toward my friend, or was it a completely inaccurate judgement on this hostess's part on how much we could afford.  Ironically, after doing some research, it turns out that the hostess, is in fact the OWNER.  Originally, I was going to write that the restaurant should fire the hostess and hire someone new who has proper people skills for the public, and who is a good representation of New York.  After finding out that she is the longtime owner, she really should invest in an ""executive coach"", as this behavior unacceptable, and having an executive coach could only help her in her business approach.  She should be ashamed of herself.   We ended up eating at her competition across the street.  They not only were exceptionally friendly, we were able to eat a great meal AND get back in time for our theater show prior to curtain call.From Nov 2017",5,1,0,Lisa J.,"San Jose, CA",309,32,200

Right before our entree came, we were given the option to move to the main dining room and we did. The atmosphere and the pianist was good. Had the Rabbit and the sauce was delicious.

It was a charming room, with cabinets of wine bottles, flowers and antiques. They were offering a pre-theatre menu, I asked the waiter if it was possible to get something off the regular menu and he said ""Yes, talk to el capitan"". When the maître d or owner or whatever came over he told me ""No, it's not possible."" So I ordered the one vegetarian entrée: pasta with tomato sauce.I ordered a beet salad, which tasted like canned beets with a dressing that was...beet? It was the same colour as the beets and tasted like beets. That was it, just a few shredded carrots as a garnish. The pasta was okay, definitely not worth $27. One star is for the green salad the waiter brought me even though I didn't get the tasting menu like my dining partner, which was nice. The other is for the delicious herbed buns they brought over before we ate. As we were leaving I overheard the hostess telling people coming in they had to check their coats.

We got a cab but so many roads were closed off that it took us forever to get there, and the traffic was bad. We called to say that we were running late and the hostess said that it was fine. However, my dad called the restaurant again to find out that they close at 2 pm which we were not aware of. The man on the phone said we would not be seated, even though we had called to say we were running late. So we finally got there at 2:02 and they were closed.

4.0,12/21/2017,"Barbetta certainly has a great menu and the food is delicious. The dining experience is made unique by the age of the restaurant. Having been around for over 100 years, Barbetta exemplifies a classic upscale pre-theater dinner. I enjoyed how every item on the menu was marked with the year the recipe was created. I was with one other person and we shared an antipasti, their classic pasta with tomato sauce, a chicken paillard, and a dark chocolate orange mousse. The antipasti was fresh, but I wasn't blown away by the selection. There was only a few prepared pieces, and too many sliced raw vegetables that just seemed to fill space on the plate. Both the pasta and the chicken paillard were spectacular. However the best part was the mousse, which I virtually swallowed it was so good. Overall, barbetta is a beautiful pre-theater dinner experience and the atmosphere is incredibly romantic. I cannot however give the restaurant 5 stars because the service was dissapointing for the price of the food. I found the waiters to be impatient and even rude.",2,0,1,Dana C.,"Manhattan, NY",456,25,67

Then you're greeted by the hostess which was very friendly. They really do make you feel welcomed in this place. The set up and decorations are top! It has a very fancy feeling. We sat at the patio which is a very nice area with a fountain. It's very rare to find a patio in NYC. It's really nice. The food was really great, I ordered linguini, which was very well done.

It is rather expensive, so do this when you would like a treat surrounded by trees and flowers!Set in an old fashioned house, you can choose to dine indoors or out - we chose to sit outside by a fountain with a view of the skyscrapers. You walk through a furnished living room that could be someone's 1920's mansion to get to the restaurant. This is an idyllic location for a date where you want to talk, sip on red wine and enjoy the fresh air from trees!The food was delicious - I had a pasta! The service was exemplary; the staff couldn't have been more attentive!If you want a secret little getaway because the city is too much sometimes, I encourage you to visit this place.

1.0,10/29/2017,This was a terrible experience and I think this restaurant should be reported to the better business bureau.  We went on a Saturday night for a pre theater dinner.  We were only given the prefix menus for three courses for $58.  They said there was no other menus but we could order al a carte from this menus that had no al a carte prices.  None of the items on the on line menu were available.  We ordered the Salmon for $37. And that's what we got - a piece of salmon on a  a bed of three thinly lived cucumbers.  The deserts were all $18 for a slice of cake or cream brûlée.   We we complained that the salmon on line was listed as $23. We were told that was the lunch menu.  Which I thought wasn't true.  Finally to apologize they gave us our desert for free.  Sorry for all those who didn't complain.  Blanche C,0,2,0,Blanche C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0
4.0,10/7/2017,"We walked into Barbetta at 10:45pm on a Friday.  I had this romantic idea of walking in the footsteps of Basquiat and Warhol who supposedly once ate there together.I didn't quite realize the location, is really in Hells Kitchen proper.  On the street we passed a number of good looking men with half unbuttoned shirts and gay bars with names like ""Bottoms up"".It was difficult to find the door to Barbetta.There's a big sign lined with light bulbs , but it's not near a door, which is kind of hidden down a step on a patio. The front of the place was empty when we walked in and so was the dining room with lights on high.  It felt like an old hotel, with an old wait stuff, somewhere in Albania maybe, or like Holiday Inns luxury line.The place didn't even really feel historic, it actually looked kind of new, or like a fake movie set of what I thought barbetta would be like. ""Kitchens closed."" The guy said almost with the motion of cutting a knife across his throat.  Ok so it felt old New York at least.""Can we have a glass of wine?"" ""Yeah."" He said. ""You wanna sit at the bar?""""No we want to sit in the courtyard.""We had to push, but we got our wish.""We had a reservation for 10:45pm but the kitchen was closed."" My girlfriend chided the waiter in a wiley feminine charm kind of way. He sat us down on some old patio furniture and gave us cushions.  It felt kind of 1970s.The courtyard was cool for sure but it didn't feel opulent. There were a few tables on the patio, everyone was 50 plus except me and my date.She was still impressed.  Our wines were excellent a rose $15 and a sparkling rose $19.  The place was quiet and felt private and we kind of felt like our own Little Rock stars.   Barbetta is yeah a funky time warp.  I'd go get some wine on the courtyard any day to lift my spirits, but go for the weird old school ambiance - first and foremost, and be prepared to pay the tourist tax.

There is a framed award on the wall for having the best wine menu, it's dated 1987. I'm not age discriminating, it's just that there is SOO much good food in Manhattan that it's criminal to be average.Barbetta is average. The food is ok. The waiter bought two prix fix menus, and as an afterthought gave us one regular menu. He was obviously pushing the bigger more expensive prix fix menu. I had to flag him down to bring us another menu. I ordered the chicken paillard which typically comes with a small salad on top, and that's what the menu said. It came with a couple grape tomatoes and some shaved fennel. I asked him about the lack of salad and he said the salad was the bit of fennel. My wife's dish was equally below expectations. I don't mind spending money on a great meal. This was pricey for what it was.

We tried the finocchio salad, it was delicious. Then the mushroom risotto, which was decent, I guess it was more important to try something they've been serving since 1906. And we had the steak for two which was very good.

1.0,4/9/2017,"One of the few restaurants serving pre theater dinner that cannot seem to accommodate patrons appropriately. Before being seated, we were told that coats were not permitted in the dining room ( it was chilly, my dining companion wished to keep hers ,which she did), but it seemed that very crowded seating was the reason behind that demand. Thus, having set the atmosphere early on, we were then greeted with a $58 pre fixe menu.  It was explained that they cannot handle a large theater crowd ordering multiple dishes, thus choices had to be limited, no a la carte menu was available. In fact, we did not wish to eat a large dinner and finally were able to choose dishes from the pre fixe menu with one of three prices. When my paiilard of chicken, topped with fennel salad arrived, there was no fennel, just a few meager greens which I had to return for the salad which had been described on the menu. It arrived but was certainly very mediocre, as was the salmon which my dining companion chose.  The decor is rather  old fashioned and seems to cater to diners who appreciate a gilded look , have no problem over spending, and do not mind bland, uninspired food.

On several instances our server Marco was no where to be found (example- it took me 20 min before I could flag him down for another glass of wine- when ordering he rudely walked away from our table mid order to take another couples order)- when we asked for him we were told that ""he was busy"".  Our fish entree came out cold as if it had been sitting there for a while before being picked up. Our desserts were also all cold- when I finally addressed the server he defensively informed us that ""it's normal"" for a baked apple and cream brûlée to come out cold. When I calmly relayed feedback on our experience he got defensive and followed his attitude up with bringing a manager to the table to only defend him. As we were on a tight schedule trying to catch a show (which I informed him multiple times, yet upon leaving our coffee had only just arrived) he still pushed us to then speak with the manager- we ended up late to our show despite an early reservation two hours ahead of showtime.

The wait staff was very aware of the theater crowd and were very prompt at taking orders and serving. Our server, Tito was very gracious and accommodating. He allowed us to order food a la carte although the prix fixe was shown. Though some of us ordered a la carte, we were brought tasting dishes of a few appetizers and a few extra desserts as well from the prix fixe. We had a well rounded tasting of what Barbetta had to offer. The house Pinot Noir was delicious. The bue (beef) with polenta was like butter. The grilled sword fish with lentil was perfectly cooked and delicious. The chicken with pomegranite was juicy and flavorful. The desserts were outrageous. I really liked that they let you know on the menu that the food is cooked with low salt and the desserts with little sugar. To me, they tasted perfect! Oh! Please do not let me forget the delicious parmesan biscotti that were complimentary on the table. Our server always made sure we had fresh rosemary rolls and breadsticks.  The Maitre D, Giampiero, was sweet and friendly.

All male wait staff very professional and knowledgable. Our waiter Marco was wonderful. Unfortunately he oversold the bartender, ""who has been at the bar for many years and knows all drinks"". My wife asked if the bartender could make her a gin drink with citrus and that the bartender should just be creative - he could not but wanted specific ingredients. I asked for a vesper which could not be made either - apparently a new drink for him and they had no Lillet in the bar. Oh well, we got a dry gin martini and a gin and tonic.The food was very good. We both ordered the braised beef for mains and we both enjoyed them. Beef melted in the mouth. Our friends got venison and lamb chops. They both thought they were great. I also had a half plate of home made pasta and red sauce - delicious. We also had a bottle of Barbera with our meal. Our friends drank beer. Ambience is old style Italian. Sconces and draperies, white tablecloths and cloth napkins. A Piano was being played when we arrived but he finished just before we got our mains. We finished with espresso and a few fancy desserts.

The restaurant is a very stuffy old townhouse gaudily decorated with chandeliers and ancient furniture. Everything about it looks wrong. The ambience was non existent pre-theater, as the pianist declined to turn up and there was not a jot of music to be heard. Very uncomfortable in a half empty restaurant. The food was ordered from a menu written in ancient roman calligraphy type and almost entirely in Italian. Because that's useful. The food  arrived quickly (obviously all pre-prepared) and was unexpectedly bland. Really little more to say than beige and bland. Utterly unsatisfying. It's gets another star for service - attentive in a overzealous type of way. Cloying and trying far too hard to be Italian. But at least attentive.

Also, since our reservation was pushed back, that meant our dinner service was pushed through in time for us to make it to our show on time.

1.0,4/16/2016,"I took my friend Barbetta's last Wednesday because I heard it is *the* place to be before a Broadway show. We arrived promptly at 6:30 p.m., our host inquired when our show began, we let him know if was 8:00 p.m. This inquiry made me feel reassured we would be out in time for An American in Paris. We were initially impressed by how quickly our jackets were taken and we were given a coat check ticket. We were given a choice of three tables against the far wall in the main dining area, they were all similar. Menus were given to us with no explanation about any of the dishes. We requested a wine list. I should mention at this time the restaurant was about 30% filled with patrons. Much time went by and we decided on a Prix Fixe dinner to expedite our experience. More time went on and I had to flag someone down and ask for a wine menu, again. When we finally received a wine list we ordered dinner and a glass of wine each. As we were waiting we noticed the cobwebs hanging from the sconce directly above our heads. There was small and well worn lamp on our table; the cord ran between us to an electrical outlet on the wall. It took up more room than necessary at our diminutive table; maybe a flameless candle would be a better option. My friend decided to use the restroom; when she returned she commented that Barbetta's has decided a plaque of Ms. Kitty denotes the women's bathroom and a Charlie Brown plaque indicates the men's room. The childlike quality matched the genre of our tiny table. As we continued to take in the décor of the dining room we decided it could use a rigorous cleaning and the paint could use a good freshening. The website indicated there would be a person playing piano beginning at 6:00 p.m., but he or she did not appear before we had to depart. Only the entrees saved the dismal experience. My friend had the salmon with cucumber and I had the Pacific bass. Both were perfectly cooked, although my fish could have used a little salt. We then awaited a dessert choice and coffee, but we had been long forgotten. We finally flagged down someone and explained we needed the check as we were going to be late for the show. I left cash because I was concerned how long a credit card transaction might have taken. Our total bill was $190 which I thought a little spendy for the shabby experience. This amount included a15% tip, which we thought generous considering the circumstances. I hope it was given to the bus person as he did keep our water glasses full. We were asked how everything was by the host as we hurried out the door; my friend commented it would have been nice to have coffee and dessert.

They made no attempt to get me another reservation elsewhere. I think this is poor form. This past year my sister had a reservation at Lincoln Restaurant.

For two people, the regular prix fix menu plus, couple of glasses of avg wine came to 180 with the tip included. Since the prices of the food is not out anywhere on the website, it feels awkward to get up once you've already sat there.

4.0,2/3/2016,"Came here for restaurant week because I was intrigued by the history of the place -- being owned and operated by the same family for over a century is no small feat! I was definitely not disappointed by the history and decor; the space is two converted townhouses, and the decor has a beautiful romantic, old-timey elegance. Tables for two are seated at a proper angle for romance (which was wasted on me because I came with my roommate, but we enjoyed the vantage point for people-watching). Great ambiance for a romantic occasion like an anniversary.The wine list is incredibly extensive to the point of being overwhelming, but the waitstaff helped me select a chardonnay that I enjoyed and was reasonably priced. Service was excellent and highly attentive. The food itself was good but not incredible -- the dishes were yummy but not particularly creative. If it hadn't been restaurant week I'm not sure it would have been worth the price for me. By far the best course was dessert, which was a dark chocolate mousse with orange sauce. I'm a huge fan of chocolate mousse and this was one of my all-time favorites.

3.0,12/17/2015,"My wife and I went here for their pre-show menu on a Wednesday night. I will say, there was no mention that this prix fix menu was the only thing available. But that was fine, as there were several choices. The building is neat looking, you enter at the bottom and get greeted, check your coat, etc. we were led upstairs to a cozy dining area. Now, everyone up there was kind of ""dressed down"". I had on a nice sweater and a pair of jeans, several people were dressed similarly. I went to the restroom downstairs and noticed that the people seated there were in suits and ties. So, I don't know if we were seated based on what we were wearing? It was very hopping and boisterous downstairs, so it was nice to sit upstairs where it was much more intimate.Our waitstaff was completely professional and helpful, couldn't ask for nicer people to wait on you. Five stars for those guys. The prix fix menu was $58 and you got bread (probably my favorite part of the meal!) and a few of those little thin breadsticks, an app, entree, salad, dessert and coffee (although we never got any). I'll get into what we ordered in a bit.From other reviews, we heard they have a wine list like a phone book, but we didn't see it (which is for the best, probably). They had a small, two page list of wines on the table. Both our main waiter and another guy were well versed in the list and were very helpful with picking out a wine. My wife got a glass of white, but switched to red for her entree. They have a decent amount of ""by the glass"" selections, but our waiter suggested (after quizzing her about preferences) that she try one that was listed by the bottle only. We said we didn't want a whole bottle, but he assured us it was fine and would open a bottle just for her. Cool! Wine WAS really good, too!Okay, ordered a pasta bolognese for an app, beef for an entree. My wife got the beet salad and she just didn't care for it. We usually don't say anything when we order wrong and let it be a learning experience. The waiter could see she hadn't really touched it and insisted on bringing her something else. Again, very cool. The hard part: food was just kind of average. And I guess I mean for the price. I'd probably go to four stars if it was $40. Sorry, I really don't have much more to say about the actual food other than it was ""fine"". I doubt we would ever go there again because of the price.

I do not even think there was dressing. Dinner was Borolo, tasted like brisket served with plain polenta. Nothing else. They bought a salad over late, plain lettuce nothing else. Food was so plain and bland. Service was horrible, we waited 20 minutes for drinks, had to remind waiter numerous times to bring coffee and when it did arrive it was cold and undrinkable. One waiter dropped my dirty fork right in my lab and it missed the napkin and landed on me. No apologies from waiter. Another waiter dropped a tray full of drinks next to us.

4.0,8/26/2015,"Excellent for a summer dinner outdoors because they have a lovely garden to go along with the great dining decor inside the restaurant. Located on restaurant row and between townhouse stairs, lies Barbette neatly tucked inside. An old school and rustic feeling exude from their wooden walls to the high hanging chandeliers.  The setting of a bygone vintage era where gents wore suits and fedoras and ladies in their A line shaped dresses, opera evening gloves and ruby red lipstick. Sadly, the vintage era has been long past, and as much as I would like to get a taste of that life, Barbette will just have substitute for the real thing.Don't let my imagination make you think this place is old or anything, but their menu does have dishes dating back to the early 1900s. Some sense of nostalgia will exist when you have dishes that was prepared and served exactly as they did back in the time when there were no world wars. My blast from the past fiancé joined me on  a romantic dinner out. We both started with pasta, their linguine pesto and tajarin. Made simple, with strong flavors of olive oils and basil. Steaming hot and excellent texture. The tajarin (tagliarini) is cooked in a tomato sauce with oven-roasted tomatoes. They said it's made exactly the same as they did back in 1906. There's no way I would ever be able to say first hand of it was made the same, but I can say it was made deliciously well. Sweet and slightly subtle tangy tomato flavor cooked into every strand of thin ribbon tagliarini. For the main course we had the lamb and braised beef. The lamb and braised beef were both yummy. The lamb wasn't fatty or too lean. It was a good size piece and not a small lamb chop. The braised beef was tender and full of flavor. The purée that came along with it was creamy and actually filling.

There's a special theater menu but I would've liked to have seen the regular menu, too. I wasn't given the option but I'm sure there are various reasons for doing this including the simple element of time. The service was great. Very polite old school Italian servers. My swordfish entree was not impressive. It was tough and undercooked so I only ate the edges. The server noticed when it was taken away and offered/insisted on replacing it with something else. I really didn't need to have another entree but he was very apologetic and insisted, so I ordered the lump crab meat dish. This dish was to die for. Big pieces of crab meat and a large portion to boot. Served with what I think was a wild rice. Delicious. Dessert was the espresso chocolate cake and the lemon pistachio tart. If you like chocolate and espresso, do not hesitate to get the cake that is in between the textures of a mousse and cheesecake...smooth, rich, and melts in your mouth. Make sure you have an espresso or hot coffee with it, too. The lemon pistachio tart was tasty but a little flat in comparison.

The restaurant has been in the same location since 1906 so as you can imagine it's beautifully decorated with antiques and has decadent little details through out the restaurant. The staff are all extremely friendly and helpful. The owner is the sweetest woman who is the second generation owner. You can tell she puts all her love into Barbetta, which I admire. I can't go to far into detail about the menu because if I do I will write pages upon pages - that's how good the food was. My highlight however was the gnocchi. This isn't something I normally order. I actually like to call them belly bombers because gnocchi generally is an extremely filling pasta. The waiter insisted on ordering the gnocchi so I did. I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. They were UNBELIEVABLE. The minute you put one on your tongue it completely melts in your mouth. I've never experienced a pasta like that especially gnocchi. It was light, fluffy and full of flavor. My biggest advice - get the gnocchi.. Even if it's as an appetizer portion (which they do offer) GET IT. I will 100% be returning here asap. I cant wait to try more Ps.

The food: the mesclun salad had a salt shaker dumped into it.  I ordered the scallops, which were very tasty, but for 38 dollars it only came with 4 scallops and a piece of bak choy.  Another in my party got chicken breast and when it arrived it was rubbery and inedible.  We sent it back into the kitchen and when it came back out it was prepared entirely differently.  Different sauce on it and a different assortment of vegetables on the plate.  Who's food did we get back?

We couldn't decide on what to get for dessert, so he literally brought us two different desserts each (the panna cotta was the very best, in my opinion). Also? There's no music in the restaurant.

We wanted luncheon size salads and said so but received appetizers salads, then were ignored, then were told if we wanted a larger salad we just had to ask and if we didn't hear him tell us that, it wasn't his fault. We said we did ask and he walked away in a huff.",0,0,0,Sally M.,"Fairfield, CT",0,5,0

3.0,6/2/2015,"I made a reservation two weeks prior, but when I called back in to change the details, three days prior, they said they couldn't find my reservation... I was like wahhh? Anyways, I guess it is a good thing that they weren't that busy on a weeknight, so it wasn't that hard for me to get another table. So, I got my reservation at 6:45, which is pretty nice because I know there are place where they don't let you make quarter reservation. They asked me if I wanted indoor seating or outdoor. The indoor decor was amazingly elegant, I loved the chandelier; but we choose to sit outdoors, which has a really nice fountain. The atmosphere outside was also really nice, there were a lot of vines and green, which made it a lot cooler and relaxing. However, side note, if you are going to be there till dark, maybe you'd wanna move indoors, because there are mosquitoes that bit your legs, and the fountain doesn't help either. So I would say an A+ to the atmosphere, it was exactly what I wanted for my birthday. Something nice and classy.On to the food... When we first got there, they gave us bread, with some herbs (either time or rosemary couldn't really tell). So for the appetizer we got the Antipastini; we were a party of three, which made this situation really awkward; everything on the plate was either in the singles or doubles... It wasn't the best situation for sharing. As for the main course, The Broiled Salmon wasn't too bad, it was cooked very nicely, crispy on the outside, the tender and juicy on the inside, but I wasn't really that big of a fan for the sauce. It was sour... a little like pickle juice(?) and it didn't really help that there were cucumbers lining the bottom of the salmon. But maybe that is how it is made in Italy? The Veal was really amazing though, it seemed like it was brazed (girello), my friend was going to use her knife, but it basically was pulled right off with a fork. On the side were three scoops of mashed potato infused with mache which made them look green. It very interesting and tasty. Then there is the Linguine, it seems like it wasn't flavorful enough, or my friend just really likes her food salty (I'm not really sure which one it is.) But she just kept adding more salt throughout the meal. Last but not least, the dessert, because it was my birthday, they gave me a piece of their espresso chocolate cake, with candles and my name written on it. It was truly awesome, and the cake a really good. It is really hard to believe that the cake was made with little sugar because it was really really good, not sweet, but just sweet enough. We were really contemplating on ordering another dessert, but decided against it when the waiter didn't come take our order in 5 minutes... the chocolate cake settled in. But dang! That cake was smooth, rich, creamy and everything you'd want in a birthday cake.Last comment, so everything was fine, but the waiting staff did make me feel a little uncomfortable... I think there is a female manager, who didn't seem too friendly or happy that I was there. When I first walked in, I sat around the lounge area next to the bar while waiting for my friends to arrive, she just kept staring... So I wanted to get a glass of wine while I waited, the bartender didn't give me a chance to look at the wine list and was just naming off wines. I don't know if he thought I couldn't read the wine list or what, but I was just really confused, the same thing happened to my other friend. Next, towards the end of the night my friend didn't finish her meal and asked to take it to go. The waiter was like, ""Why didn't you finish the food? Did you not like it?"" Granted maybe you wanted some feed back for the kitchen, but it prompted my other friends to feel that she had to explain why she didn't finish her last bit of veal... Maybe, this question could have been delivered in a smoother way(?) Another thing that I felt kind of confused about was, both of my friends weren't able to finish their food, and asked to have them wrapped up. So these are two main courses... Why would you wrap them together instead of individually? That really did boggle my mind a little bit... And Lastly, because it was my birthday, my best friend wanted to pay for me... which I wouldn't say is an uncommon gesture... She successfully did it, then one of the waiters came up to her and was like, ""when it is my birthday will you pay for my meal too?"" Thinking he was joking, me and her exchanged an awkward look. Then we realized, he wasn't really joking... She just tried to brush it off and made small talk, but before we left he looked at her and was like don't forget my birthday... Hmmmm.... Wth? Ok, me being sensitive again...Anyways, overall, I would say A+ for decor/atmosphere and overall feel, B for food because though there were low lights there were also some highlights... As for service... I would rather not comment... If I do come back, I do hope the service improves...",3,1,1,Allison C.,"New York, NY",35,68,299

2.0,4/1/2015,"I've now been here twice, and there are some good and bad things about both experiences.  The oddest to me is that there seems to be an arrogant, dismissive attitude by the waiters toward deviations from the exact descriptions of the dishes listed on the menu.  The first time I went (for lunch), I wanted to add grilled chicken to a pasta dish.  The waiter said ""Oh, I'll have to ask the chef if this is okay.  Maybe not.""  After much discussion, the ""chef"" agreed to let me have chicken on this dish.  Great.  The food that day was okay...not really very flavorful or exciting.  Kind of basic.  That day would've been a 3-star review based on the fact that they tried to allow me to do something other than precisely what's written on the parchment paper menus.  Fast forward to my latest visit to this establishment.  I once again asked if I could make some modifications by adding protein to a standard menu item, and I was told ""we do not have chicken.""  What kind of restaurant (an Italian one) doesn't have grilled chicken lying around or incorporate grilled chicken into ANY of its menu items?  I pointed out that there were other dishes that feature chicken on the menu, and the waiter then blamed me saying ""You're wrong!  We never let people add chicken.  Only in the summer!""  So apparently it's only okay to have grilled chicken added to a basic entree in the summer at Barbetta. I wound up ordering something without chicken, and the tiny portions and familiar tasteless flavor reminded me that I probably should've stayed away.  Surly attitude from waiters didn't really help the experience, and there was a waiter playing a horribly out of tune upright piano.  It was kind of a sad experience, and I left hungry after paying nearly $30 for a pasta entree that was about the size of a starter in some places.  Decided to try the dessert, and the espresso cake was unremarkable and bland as well.  First experience: 3 stars, Second experience: 1 star.  Overall review: 2 stars.  You can do much better, especially in a tourist-infested area of Manhattan.",0,1,0,Jason N.,"New York, NY",91,40,6

The food is amazing a small menu=fresh ingredients flown in from Italy. Truffles from the families truffle hounds in Italy just as authentic you can get.

1.0,1/6/2015,"Came here with some friends from out of the town because it's in the theater district and supposedly, one of the nicest Italian restaurants in the city.  Why am I only giving it 1 star? Because it has the worst hygiene a restaurant can possibly have and the customer service is just as bad. First, there were bugs flying around. I get it, we were sitting in the garden, it was late summer/early fall; but there were more than dozenS of little fruit flies/bugs loitering on our big plate of cheese/salami platter, I'm sorry (but not really), it was simply unacceptable. Second, I addressed the problem to the waiters. It was not once, not twice, but after three times until one waiter decided to come and hear me out. Guess what his advice was? Eat faster! He picked up the plate and shoveled the food into each one's plate, of course, along with the bugs that were sticking to the foods. Unbelievable. Since my friend's friend suggested the restaurant for our convenience (we were going to watch a Broadway show afterwards), I resisted my temptation to get up and leave immediately, several times. Alas, we finally finished our dinner and got the check. Surprise (not)! There was a huge dead fly stuck to the back of the checkbook, joining the bug party while bidding us farewell. Gross.

Refreshing to see waiters dressed in suits with the towel over their arm and a menu written in Italian without subtitles.  Not knowing Italian allows you an opportunity to engage with the waiter about the various choices which for me was a pleasant experience.  The rabbit was succulent and the portion was ample.  I also thought for New York that the food was priced very fairly.  This restaurant caters to a large pre- post theatre crowd - - but I really think that Barbetta would be good anytime.",0,0,0,Gwendolyn P.,"Philadelphia, PA",59,730,113

4.0,6/23/2014,"My boys and wife went for a pre theatre dinner this past weekend. I was a bit nervous having read the previous reviews but here is my take on this place in restaurant row. First of all, if you are going to eat on restaurant row, be prepared to spend $$$. I found all the complaints about the price uninformed. The prix fixe is about $60 per person and you add cocktails and wine to that. So it's going to be about $100 pp.  if that's too much then go a couple of blocks away and the price drops. The location is fantastic, close to all theatres and parking is easy if you use the icon parking a block away. Don't park on the Row, there is always a traffic jam. The restaurant is being restored after a fire a couple of years ago but was beautiful in a old, Italian tradition. The tables were spaced well apart, including the garden where we sat near the fountain. It reminded me of Al fresco dining in the old country. The service was unrushed, cocktails perfect, and the food arrived hot and delicious. The swordfish and lentils was fantastic with floor and interest throughout. We ordered pastas and desserts and the waiter brought out more desserts just to make sure we had enough. The owner took special interest to see we were happy, and the attention to detail was unexpected for pre theatre meals in the city. So in summary, go here for the ambiance, service, and careful cuisine. It is a splurge of $$$ so of that is of high concern, don't go.

And if I want ultra heathy food I will cook it myself. Eating out should be enjoyable and  Barbetta certainly is.  We adored this charming restaurant. They had the integrity to honor our reservation and stay open and wait for us after a late show, even though there were no other late diners. They fad a full staff there to attend to us but I think they have a high standard for service all the time. Our waiter Edwardo was gracious and entertaining.

2.0,8/1/2013,"I wanted to like Barbetta, I really did!  The Restaurant Menu looked very good, so we gave it a try last night.  It was the oddest dining experience I have ever had.We had reservations through open table- the lady at the entrance asks about our reservations and says she will check on it.  She then proceeds to get into several conversations with other people and forgets about us.  A second man who appears to be the Matre D also walks over- we explain that the woman was supposed to be checking our reservation.  Ten minutes go by and then they ask if we would like to be inside or outside.  We opt for inside to avoid the humidity.  Five minutes later, we're seated in a room that's less than half full.  We couldnt' understand what took so long.Then, we sat at our little table by the door for ANOTHER FIFTEEN MINUTES before anyone gave us water or menus.  Waiters walked in and out and nodded at us, but there was no service at all.  Finally, the waiter comes over and drops off menus, saying that he thought we'd already eaten.  My husband was convinced that they were deliberately ignoring us and hoping we would walk out.  So half an hour after our reservation, we finally look at the menu, which I've already looked at online.  The waiter comes over again and wants to explain everything to me.  I just nod my head as if I'm an idiot who couldn't read the menu herself and then order my food.This place only gets 2 stars because it has SOME old world ambiance- and they're pushing it here, because it's borderline dingy, and because the food was decent- notice I said decent and not great.  I started with the bowtie pasta with peas.  It came in what was like a pea puree with some small baby peas- very good, but it needed some cheese.  Cheese was noticably missing from our table and the wait staff wasn't going to grate it tableside at this place.  For an entree, we both had the braised beef.  Again, this was good, but honestly, something I could have made at home.  The mashed potatoes with chives were very good.  The best part of the meal was the orange chocolate mousse, which was delicious.Portions were borderline TINY.  We were dining on the restaurant week menu, so I wasn't expecting something huge, but honestly, the mousse was a spoonful with a splash of raspberry sauce on a salad plate.  It could have used some whipped cream.  Mashed potatoes were also just a tiny scoop.  It was still a $38 meal (plus a $4 8-ounce soda).  So I felt it was really overpriced for what we received.  Meanwhile, the staff continued to yell at each other from across the room- very unprofessional and surreal in what was supposed to be an upscale place.This is a one and done for me.  I can get better Italian food in NYC or Long Island, and had a quarter of the price.",3,1,1,Ginamarie P.,"Huntington Station, NY",2,57,0

5.0,4/3/2013,"A real find, a marvelous experience!  Barbetta sustains its reputation for elegance and delectable cuisine.  I am never, repeat never, disappointed.  The garganelli, swordfish, chicken or braised beef are my usual choices.  My only sadness comes from having to choose between a fantastic appetizer (I love the proscuitto and melon) and the desserts on their magical dessert cart (favorites include strawberries and Zabaglione, hazelnut cake, and the pear dish).  The decision is easier when I go with more than one person and we can share.  I have no idea what the other reviews are talking about when they state a lack of food.   I have had the opposite experience and usually need to make a dining decision before I get to the restaurant, given the fresh and delicious rosemary bread, fantastic appetizers and entrees, and the magical dessert cart.The restaurant is pricey and totally worth it to celebrate special occasions, when friends and family come to visit, or if you enjoy a nice dinner out and can afford it.  And while the food is fantastic, the real charm of Barbetta stems from the spectacular staff.  The maitre'd and hostess are sanguine and welcoming, the service is attentive yet not intrusive, and the atmosphere they create is relaxing and inviting.  Additionally, the garden is like finding an experience from La Dolce Vita in Manhattan (I dare anyone to disagree, since no one I have brought there ever has).  I can't say enough great things about Barbetta, which is why I go back as often as my wallet allows me.",0,0,0,Stephanie J.,"New York, NY",0,2,0

1.0,2/15/2013,"Once upon a time, Barbetta was a great venue to attend. Once upon a time, Barbetta's food was top notch. Once upon a time, the service was outstanding and you felt luxurious. Unfortunately, tonight was not that time. This place had its heyday, I am sure, but the charm and luxury and all else but the prices has faded. I honestly believe many of these 5 star reviews are written by the restaurant themselves as no one could have, in their right mind, given this place such an undeserved rating.My Valentine's Day experience was so unpleasant and dreadful, I literally do not know where to begin this review. With the promises of a live Jazz band, I made a reservation several days ahead of time. On the day of the event, I called in letting the Maitre d' know we would be a half hour late. Of course, they were accommodating. After all, they already charged for the seats ahead of time ($100 was auto-charged 1 week before).Upon arrival, we are greeted by the hostess and the Matre d' shortly thereafter. They are friendly, warm and professional which gave way to the illusion that the night would keep the same theme. I was obviously utterly wrong.We are whisked to the coat check room where a bland and emotionless woman takes my date's coat. As I am waiting, I take in the decor. I do not feel the grandiose feel as I have read, I do not feel luxury, I do not feel extravagance. I simply feel as though the place is dusty, aged and weathered. There are random pieces of antique furniture and items scattered throughout. It is, literally, extremely dusty. The carpet seems to be from the 70's (and has not been cleaned since). I presume this place was actually quite a nice house in the 1800's before it was turned into a restaurant and that is exactly how this place comes off. A nice Manhattan manor you are dining in, one that has not been cared for all too well. ""Restored"" is the advertised term.That explains the very narrow staircase and the narrow entry points to dining areas as we are led upstairs and to our table. It just does not feel as though it was designed for customers or to be a dining establishment. After asking one of the employees, my suspicions were proved correct. They have a nice main room upstairs with very old (and dusty) bottles of Italian wines, standing up, lining the dark and enormous wooden cabinets. It gives the feel as though you have entered the house of a deceased duke or count in the middle of the city and only the widow remains to care for the place. A somber feeling to say the least.After being seated, we are greeted by one of the busboys/semi-waiters who seems extremely enthusiastic and almost overly friendly at first. We are then greeted by the main waiter who is differentiated by his suit (but not by his class or behavior, that's for sure). They ask for water preference, etc etc.Within 1-2 minutes you pick up the vibe that they are anything but an experienced or professional wait staff. Our overly friendly bus-boy was just that, overly friendly. After we gave him a fact to cling onto, he kept talking and talking and being intrusive. He had an awkward smile and would just linger, staring and hoping for us to communicate with him in some way. He used the language of a teenager and was just unpleasant after a while. Constantly re-starting some conversation when he had any interaction with us. Randomly speaking about how people in LA are backstabbers and ruining the mood. It was extremely uncomfortable.The main waiter seemed as though he had to tell each of the bus boys what to do, step by step. It was a circus, not a loud or rowdy one, but any experienced foodie living in NY can tell. From the small $85 prix fixe, my date ordered the Garganelli and I the Crespelle to start. Both of these dishes were tiny and bland. Tasted like a neighborhood Italian place, only worse. My date thought she was having Ronzoni in some canned Prego sauce and I seemed to have the mystery meat lunch special. It was edible, just upsetting.(We went to dance after this, more on it in blog review)We then went on to order the Roast Chicken in a pomegranate sauce for myself and the Braised Beef with Polenta for my date. The chicken was decent. Tender and juicy but too sour on the skin with the Pom reduction. The braised beef was too salty, although it was tender and cooked to a decent state. The Polenta was ""eh"", my date took two bites. So far we are not even slightly happy. Then comes the dessert on a cart, which was bland and cold as can be. We are offered a selection each, not even an offer of tea or coffee.Anyways, since Yelp has a 5000 word limit, I will publish the whole review on a blog and edit this post with the link. End of the story, %20 forced gratuity, whispers of ""we sold the most bottles in this section, hooray for extra kick-backs"" from the staff. Staff who announce your bill totals out loud. Just a TERRIBLE experience.SAVE YOUR MONEY, GO TO OLIVE GARDEN. DO NOT COME HERE!!!",7,5,0,Albert K.,"New York, NY",24,3,4
4.0,2/7/2013,"This place definitely has old world charm. Our meal was most enjoyable, heightened by the knowledgeable and entertaining Maitre D, Eduardo. We took him up on several menu recommendations are we were not disappointed by any. For appetizer, I had the Crispelle, a vegetable stuffed crepe rolled like a manicotti, and covered with a delightful red sauce. It is offered as a main course, but Eduardo offered a half portion as an appetizer. Now that's what I call good service and a good recommendation. He also allowed Denise to have the delicious Gnocchi, even though it was not on the restaurant week menu. They are some of the lightest Gnocchi ever. My main course was a beef dish accompanied by two polentas, one creamy and the other crispy. Oh and they have an extensive list of Italian wines both by the bottle and by the glass.

We were seated and then waited  a good 12 minutes before anyone came to the table. Our waiter finally stopped by and said he would be with us in 2 minutes. Shortly after another man in a suit came over and asked to take our order. Again we were fine ( although at this point some bread would have been nice ). We ordered and the gentlemen did provide good direction on the appetizer.  It was a thinly sliced medium rare veal salad and the best thing I ate. My second course was porcini risotto   It was good but small portion for price. My entree was braised short rib. It looked liked it came from a can and didn't taste much better. I have to say I was completely unimpressed with my entree.  My friend had salmon and he enjoyed it. My other friend had panko scallops. He enjoyed them but did not enjoy his pasta course.  There was something off about the service.  I can't explain it but we were left unattended for a while in the crowded restaurant then by dessert the waiter was effusive and overly attentive. We were not in a rush and indicated that when we arrived. Maybe that was it.  Still they did not charge us for dessert and were insistent that I try one (I declined).

We had a reservation for 6:30 and waited just 10 minutes for a table. My mom had her heart set on eating in the garden, so that's what I requested. The garden is beautiful. And I'm not even a fan of outdoor dining. I'd suggest booking a table out there around sunset to take advantage of the cool breeze and the beautiful lighting. The service is great. We had what seemed like a number of waiters. I see how that could frustrate some people but we felt taken care of. The waiter came to take our orders and offered to cook us whatever we wanted within reason if there was nothing appealing on the menu. My mom had a penne dish and loved it. I had the Chilean bass and loved it. My dad had the braised beef and loved it. The food was on the expensive side, but I was prepared for that going in. There's a dessert cart with a lot of fruit-based options. We shared the pear in cinnamon and wine sauce and loved that too. It was $18 and the waiters never mention the prices, so I could picture a disgruntled customer complaining about that at some point, but it was delicious. The bill for three people was $125.

The bartender made a phenomenal Vodka Collins and Sidecar. He told me that they hand-squeeze most of their juices on site (not cranberry juice). The garden.Oh, the garden! The garden was the oasis that I've been desiring in Manhattan. With the bubbling fountain, I could only hear the conversations at our table, and I heard ZERO street noise. It was so relaxing to be there. The service was outstanding; our waiters were so helpful and so entertaining. I honestly felt like we were family here. We had a caprese salad with fresh mozzarella (excellent), gnocchi (life changing), and tons of wine. I split the filet mignon and the sea scallops with my friend. They were both outstanding, but the sea scallops shone a bit more than the steak and polenta. What else? Oh, dessert! Creme brulee done to perfection and a hazelnut chocolate mousse....

The chicken in pomegranate sauce was a small serving of something dark, purple and unappealing.  Only 2 items saved the meal from total disaster:  a glass of a nice Barbera wine and big fat fresh strawberries for dessert.  The servers make you feel like they've been doing this for years, they're trapped in their jobs and you are a dopey tourist who doesn't deserve better if you're stupid enough to come here.  Nuff said.",1,1,0,Janet M.,"New York, NY",1,65,0

The meals are spactacular. They are 3 courses, and you have a few options for each course. I had the green salad, salmon and roasted pears in wine. Delicious. My friend had the roasted beet salad, pasta with a tomato basil sauce, and the roasted peaches in white wine. What a great experience. The meals were 35-60 dollars (restaurant week).

We came pre-theatre for the $58 fixed price menu. I enjoyed my soup of the day and my mesclun salad. I had the Bue al Barolo for my second course. It was tender and delicious, but I wasn't overly impressed. I wished my food had been a little better. However, my husband said his rabbit was delicious. The wine selection is excellent, a great variety of Italian wines. The garden should be on your list of places to go in the summer. It's stunning.

Efficient team service. Price fixed menu $58 per person includes salad, first and second entree, and desert.   Excellent food!

3.0,12/24/2009,"I attended a holiday party here, so my experience may not have been like the regular patron's.  But from what I saw, the place was all right.  It's in a convenient location, right on Restaurant Row, and it seems pretty spacious.  The party I attended was in a section of the restaurant that looked straight out of the Gilded Age: cream colored walls with generous, flowy curtains to match, lots of gold appliques, floral stuff and white tablecloths.  I could have been in a scene from ""The Age of Innocence.""  I guess the good thing about this kind of decor is that people of all ages feel welcome; it's sophisticated in a simple way and not too hip, trendy or loud.The service was prompt and professional.  The coat check line moved quickly, the bartender served us drinks right away at the open bar, and the waiters started food service almost immediately after everyone was seated.  They had good bread -- simple rolls with rosemary sprinkled on top.  For the appetizers, they had a choice of pasta or beet salad, and I had the beet salad.  The beets were nice; they were sliced thinly and had a caramelized flavor on the edges, kind of a hearty roasted flavor.  We were also served a basic arugula salad with vinaigrette.  For my entree, I had salmon.  I usually am not too excited to eat salmon, but at Barbetta it was decent.  They didn't overcook it, so it retained a lot of its moisture, and it came with a creamy cucumber sauce.  Drinks were refilled promptly throughout the meal.Dessert was yummy too.  I tried the creme brulee, which was creamy and not too sweet.  My date tried the baked apple, which was also nicely spiced and delicious.  Coffee was served as soon as the dessert cart was brought around.I have no idea how much dinner costs at this place normally, but I'd assume it wouldn't be too pricey.  It's not particularly imaginative food, and the vegetables used did not taste amazing, like they do at restaurants that go to the Farmers Market for their ingredients.   I'd probably consider returning here if I had some business in the neighborhood, but it's not a destination restaurant I'd go out of my way for.  It's too traditional for my tastes!  But if traditional is what you like, this place fits the bill.",2,1,1,elise h.,"New York, NY",52,243,6

The waiters were really nice and were suited up in tuxedos, which kind of makes you feel underdressed. The atmosphere feels very upscale - white table cloths, chandeliers hanging down from the high ceiling; and the fine upholstered chairs.  Even though it's an Italian restaurant, I ordered a roasted codfish with ratatouille and it was ok. It's definitely pricey but if you feel like spending the $ for the experience, I would recommend it.

3.0,8/23/2009,"Since I was visiting New York, I suggested to my cousin that I wanted some Italian food, and we arrived here.  The ambiance is wonderful, but then again, you can't eat ambiance.The previous reviews about the service are pretty accurate - the basic needs are taken care of (i.e you are seated, they give you menus, take your orders, and serve you food).  However, unless you are dressed well or have mentioned a special occasion such as a birthday, I don't think enough attention is paid to the table.  Only after eating did someone come by to ask if everything was ok.That being said, the food was great.  I had asked one of their wine consultants for a recommendation for a glass, and I received a red wine that paired really well with my Organic Herb-fed Rabbit.  I enjoyed the rosemary bread they provided and although the minestrone was nothing spectacular, it was still enjoyable.  As for desserts, the Creme Brulee was spot-on to everything I wanted from it, and the bittersweet chocolate mousse also had subtle cherry and coconut flavors in it that made it quite enjoyable.  If I lived in NY, Barbetta likely wouldn't be a staple for fine Italian food, but at least for a one-time visit, I was definitely satisfied.",2,1,2,Phil L.,"San Mateo, CA",302,77,0

2.0,7/24/2009,"*** Restaurant Week Review ***I wanted to come specifically for the famed garden, but the Big Guy up there decided it'd really tickle him to rain on my parade, literally. The rest of the night just unraveled from there on. I. FOOD[[ Extras ]]Cold, hard, stale house bread that comes -after- our appetizers arrive, but with a complimentary side of Attitude isn't the best way to impress customers, Barbetta. The Holy Bible of Wine was fun to browse through, even though I didn't end up getting anything. [[ Appetizer ]]---Minestrone served at room temperatureI understand soups being cold or hot, but why serve something room temperature? Without a noticeable temperature, the blandness just stood out even more. [[ Main Course ]]  --- Crespelle alla SavolardaDescribed to me as a crepe with veal and bechamel sauce, or ""a better lasagna"", I breathed a sigh of relief as I took the first bite. Even though it was swimming in excess bechamel sauce, the flavors were good. Not amazing, but a godsend compared to the previous dishes. --- Free Range Organic Chicken alla Parmagiana How do you mess up a piece of chicken breaded and smothered in cheese and tomato sauce? To their defense, the chicken meat was moist enough. [[ Dessert ]]  --- Mousse of Bittersweet ChocolateThe mousse was rich and dense, and the bittersweet flavor was pronounced. The raspberry sauce that accompanied it was really strong too. If you're into bittersweet chocolate, it's a decent choice. --- Pears baked in red wine alla Piemontese An entire pear soaked in red wine, a Piedmont specialty according to the menu. It came with a creamy custard on the side that helped balance out the subtle sweetness and texture of the pear. II. SERVICEThe quality of service was so all over the place that my head was spinning by the end. Our waiter barely paid attention to us and was impatient when he did. Every other diner besides us was offered the regular menu with the RW menu, which we realized after we already ordered. The best service we got all night was from our busboy. Other peoples' experiences seemed a bit better. The chef even came out to greet the table next to us. And to round off the night, our check was incorrect, corrected after much confusion, and plopped back on our table without another word. III. VERDICTNo.",4,2,1,Melissa Z.,"New York, NY",203,117,81

The gnocchi is wonderful. I often shy away from four cheeses, but the gnocchi here has a great texture and the sauce is not overpowering.  Now the scallops are absolutely incredible. Crusted with Yukon potatoes, they are a little piece of heaven in every bite. I tend to really prefer red wine, but knew that I was going to order scallops.  It might change your view of scallops.  The stewed peach with heavy cream was also excellent.  I think the waitstaff were happy that we did not order the restaurant week menu (it looked really lame) and also added an extra plate of strawberries and heavy cream for free.Why not 5 stars? Maybe I shouldn't care as much about price, but 18 dollars for a single peach seems excessive.  Fine scallops for 38, but really 18 for a peach?Ouch that hurts.",0,0,0,Jasmine M.,"Manhattan, NY",160,364,0
