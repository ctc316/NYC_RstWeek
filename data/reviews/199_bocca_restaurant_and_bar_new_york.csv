5.0,4/19/2019,"We were originally planning on going to the Thai Villa around the corner and there was a three hour wait (they don't take reservations) and we had to stay there but wait outside....ummm no thanks. We found Bocca around the corner. They had a 45 minute wait but offered to serve us drinks and appetizers at the bar while we waited...yes please! The customer service was excellent from the host, to bartender, to server, to the chef who made his rounds and said hello to people asking how the meal has been. The food was delicious, fresh, and authentic. My friend and I both got the special which was lobster tails and spaghetti. The sauces, bread, and pasta were all made in house. I highly recommend dining here. Worth the wait and they treat you like they are happy to have you there from beginning to end.",0,0,0,Amanda M.,"Chico, CA",64,16,5
5.0,4/5/2019,"Went there after realizing that every ""restaurant"" in Eataly, besides the quick $5 pizza place, was a 2 hour wait. My friend isn't the adventurous kind, so we had to call around the nearby Italian restaurants to see if they had Alfredo and such. We really wanted pasta. Most had black squid ink pasta and the like; something I would dive right in, but she would go hungry. So finally we found that boca could accommodate the borderline picky eater. We sat in a few minutes and ordered drinks. I overheard the bartender talking about a peanut infused whiskey old fashioned and I had to try it. It was fabulous. Kudos to that awesome bartender that created it and nerded out about it for a few minutes with me. Love it. It came with spiced peanuts on the side, too. Great touch to add flavor. Our waitress (it says ""N"" on the receipt and we are on 3/15 near closing time) was great, too. I heard about the eggplant caponata from another table  and had to have it. Friend got the calamari. Both were great, but I was quite particular to my eggplant and ricotta. You get yummy bread with this weird red olive oil sauce. We later found out it was simply sun-dried tomatoes and olive oil. (We bought a jar of it to take home). It was so good. Almost filling up on bread and apps, we finally go back and forth with ""N"" on what to get. I was between truffle pasta and the cacio e Pepe. The ultimate compromise was cacio e Pepe with added truffles. My friend ended up doing the same, but with shrimp. Our neighbors, who had the dish, too, were jealous of our add-ons. Let me tell you: ALWAYS get the cacio e Pepe. It's amazing. And obviously super cool. Pasta swirled in a cheese wheel and served table side? How can you go wrong? I almost asked for more of the cheese bits, but I'm glad I didn't. It was sooo cheesy, which, unfortunately, made it quite salty towards the end. We both couldn't finish it. But the taste was between an Alfredo and carbonara. I thought it would be lighter, but it really picked up a good amount of cheese. I don't think I would add the truffles again. You couldn't taste them in their expensive glory with all the cheese going on. Well worth the experience. After barely  being able to move, we declined dessert. A table near us for some and they were quite tiny, so I'm glad we skipped it. I will be back next time I'm there. Everyone was great. Cool atmosphere.",0,0,0,Pam D.,"Orlando, FL",0,105,15
5.0,3/25/2019,"My wife and I had Dinner at Bocca last night and we were astonished on how awesome the food and the customer service was.For appetizers we had fried calamari and the Eggplant timbale. The Calamari was fresh, tender. The eggplant was just simply delicious. I had the Cacio e pepe and I had no words on how the cheese to fresh pasta ratio was  on point. My wife had the Squid ink/crab Gnocci and again the combination and flavors goes together very well.For dessert we had the Chocolate cake with home made pistachio Gelato, The Frozen Nutella pudding with blueberries, limoncello and an espresso. Everything was excellent, well balanced and the presentation is just amazing. Customer service should be 10 stars. The beautiful young receptionist greeted us with a smile and we were seated right away. The guy with the slickback haircut and all the waiters took care of us like we are family. My wife and I really enjoyed the wonderful meal and we can not stop talking on how we  would like to go back next week cause truthfully Bocca's food is the closest thing to local italian food when we were in Rome.I would definitely repeat.

3.0,1/29/2019,"Not a bad place to consider for lunch if you're in the Flatiron area. Decided to try this place during restaurant week. Lo and behold, saw they already offer a lunch special for $17 and decided to go with that. Restaurant week's three course special was $26. I would recommend going with that if you want to try an appetizer (other than salad or soup of the day) and the nutella dessert. The $17 lunch special comes with soup or salad, entree (more selections) and panna cotta for dessert. Upon entering around 12:30, we were nervous because it was empty. I mean, echo empty. One other patron by the bar and a couple by the front.  Greeted by the host/waiter and brought to our table. The corner, booth-style table seat is weird because so many people have sat there that your butt sinks in to the seat, right smack in the middle. Awkward. Ordered two salads, grilled shrimp salad, house made pasta with braised lamb shank and the panna cotta. We received complimentary warm bread with this unique dipping sauce. It was either a tomato or red pepper paste mixed with a vinaigrette and oil. Salad and entree took a while to appear. Dessert came out fast. Our waiter thought we wanted two soups and a tilapia dish. Thankfully, they brought out the correct entree quickly and piping hot. I was disappointed at the error but he was apologetic and quick to fix things. The food was good. Salad was your basic mixed greens with a vinaigrette. The grilled shrimp salad had an exotic, strong grill taste and was done nicely. Went well with the spinach. I enjoyed my house made pasta with a delightful sprinkling of parmesan cheese and scoop of ricotta. The lamb shank was tender and very flavorful. Overall, a nice combination - wish it was a slightly bigger platter so I could devour more. The panna cotta was a refreshing surprise. Had a nice strawberry flavor and just the right amount of sweetness. Their lunch special is a good deal for the type of food you're getting here. Just be prepared that it can be quiet during lunch time.",0,0,0,Shelley L.,"New York, NY",96,466,1212

1.0,1/5/2019,"This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had in NYC.  The waiter gave us two plates for the pasta, we assumed they split one serving because the second plate was smaller and more watery. When we asked the waiter if it was one serving or two, he accused us of ordering two and was very nasty. We were so full from the pasta that we couldn't eat the Branzino that we ordered. We had to take it to go and couldn't even enjoy the fish. Pasta was watery and too salty. Not returning.",0,0,0,Jason N.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,5,0
2.0,12/30/2018,"Really mixed reviews on this one. Would do 2.5 stars if I could. Pretty good food, but very bad service. Came here around 7:30 on a Saturday with a group of 5. It wasn't too busy yet and we were seated promptly. Andddd that was the about the end of the good service. We waited maybe 20 minutes or so before anyone came to the table. A busser finally brought some water over, and we asked if he could grab our waiter when he got a chance. Eventually, the waiter comes over, and we place our orders for drinks, appetizers and entrees. We figured if service was this slow, we better get our orders in quick. Then appetizers came out, but still no wine. Our waiter was MIA, so we asked a busser again if he could find our waiter. We ordered 2 bottles of wine, so it's not like we all ordered mixed drinks and the bartender was backed up. We are done with appetizers and the wine comes out (finally)! Entrees finally arrive, and we ask for more bread and water. When our waiter poured the waters he reached across the table and held the pitcher so high that water splashed all over the table. He did this 5x in a row and apparently didn't notice the water spilling all over. Still no bread, so we asked again. He seemed to have no recollection of the previous ask. Needless to say, we never got the bread. Next we ordered some dessert and coffee. We ended up getting more coffees than we ordered. Instead of realizing that when we all said ""I didn't order that"" he just left it on the table and left. Not a big deal at all, but just kind of continuing the theme of our waiter being lost.THENNN....(I was in the bathroom so sadly I missed this) our waiter followed some of the group outside and confronted them about not getting a good tip. He then also cornered another group member inside and did the same thing. Even though I didn't see this, I think that is VERY unprofessional. If he genuinely did not think his tip reflected his service (or lack thereof), the manager should have said something. Also, if he had the same enthusiasm during dinner, his tip would've been better as would my rating. Some positives though. The food and wine were both very good. There were quite a few things on the menu that I would've liked to have tried. The ambiance was nice. A good sized space. Not too small and not so large that you are unable to hear your table. Overall, it's probably a very nice restaurant if you have a good waiter. Unfortunately, having an awful waiter really does make it a frustrating experience.",3,0,0,Jill R.,"Gramercy, Manhattan, NY",3,20,40
2.0,12/30/2018,"This restaurant came recommended by our hotel. We were meeting up with family that we had not seen in awhile, so we chatted it up a bit before ordering. Here's the gist of my review: rude service and host! Read thru if you want the details. We had a party of 3, arrived on time for our reservation and as mentioned were sitting and catching up- the server stopped by a few time to take a drink order which we apologized that we hadn't looked yet- he then said, ""we'll you can order and chat at the same time"". We ordered  and felt he was a bit rude and all just looked at each other. We then ordered apps, and entrees. The Cacio e Pepe table-side was a nice touch but bland. The amtriciana was decent, yet not really sure it wasn't just tomato sauce. Anyway, decent. After sinner we paid the bill and sat and chatted a bit more finishing our wine. The host then came to us and said ""we have a reservation for this table and need you to leave"". I get the need for the table after a few hours, but there were empty tables all around us and no one waiting! This has happened before in other places where the host may say, can I offer you a drink at the bar, we have people waiting etc. anyway, this was a rude act and we were not happy. It soured our experience. I would not recommend this restaurant - there are plenty other Italian restaurants in NYC. Thanks for listening!",0,0,0,Na A.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,0

4.0,12/24/2018,"Came here because our first choice was too busy and someone wanted pasta--but i'm glad we did come! Even though we came with a party of 7, we were seated within a few minutes. They have free coat check too which was really nice since some of our friends did some shopping earlier that day. I got the spaghetti dish with truffle, some type of fatty pork, and pecorino cheese. Our waiter made someone bring out a huge dish of pecorino cheese and put a ton onto my pasta and said it will make it taste better. It definitely gave it a bolder flavor, but it might've been a little too much cheese for me. I love cheese, but pecorino is a bit more strong so I wish there was a bit less. The truffle wasn't as strong as I had hoped, but overall the dish was good. I tried my friend's pasta and I thought that one tasted really good, so I think in general all of the dishes here are pretty good! Our waiter brought out a free dessert for us -- panna cotta with strawberries! Delicious! Tbh, my favorite part of the meal lol. Also, the only reason this place is getting four stars instead of three is because they gave us the free dessert.",0,0,0,Esther K.,"Columbia, MD",30,59,62
2.0,12/20/2018,"I hate to give one star, so I will give two for the sake of it. This place was a big miss! Arrived here at 12:40ish for lunch and the place was empty...should have taken that as a sign. My group was excited for their $17 pre-fix lunch menu as all the menu item was pretty exciting. I ordered the Zuppa soup, the Pappardelle, and the Panna Cotta, which was the only choice for dessert. Zuppa was very bland. It tasted almost like hot water with cheese and veggies. I added salt that was readily available on the table, and then asked for pepper which was not on the table. The Pappardelle...where to start with all the misses. 1) Portion: I get its a lunch special, but the portion was appetizer size. 98% of this portion was pasta and 1.5% was sauce and 0.5% was the lamb shank. Not joking. The sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce. Ugh I know this is offensive to say, but it was true. For what it is worth, the pasta did taste handmade... but as one of my lunch mate said... it is not hard to make pasta, ""egg, flour and salt!"" :)Panna Cotta: only half a portion was served. it was nice, but definitely had better. Service...slow, but they were attentive. We were only one of three groups there from 12:40 to 2:30pm. Yes it was this long! Because we were a group of 6+, they generously tipped themselves 20%, which we paid for, but also laughed at.There are a lot more restaurants in the area that is MUCH better.

4.0,11/28/2018,"I came to Bocca with a friend from high school who I haven't seen for about a year, but the focus was on the food. We shared three dishes:1. The Timballino di Melanzane alla Parmigiana - the eggplant timbale was perfect and the cheese was a beautiful accompaniment on top cutting the tartness of the tomato sauce.2. Ravioli di Barbabietole - pasta made al dente with a tasty chewiness, the texture of the beets and goat cheese was excellent. I would've liked maybe a little heat in the dish as opposed to the sweetness.3. Papperdelle Al Ragu di Agnello - I found this to be the weakest dish. The lamb was chewy and stringy, the pasta was wet. At the end I left a bit of the lamb at the end.All in all a fine Italian restaurant but for the price point that I paid it could've been better!",0,0,0,Willy X.,"New York, NY",873,222,74

Perfectly cooked pasta, coated in cheese and spicy with the pepper!  A real treat. The Honey chose her favorite - pappardelle ragout.

4.0,7/21/2018,"The service was wonderful and the food was delicious, but it was quite pricey for what it is. I came here for dinner with 2 friends on a Friday, and we came early, around 6, to make it to a Broadway show afterwards. There was literally no one else in the restaurant other than 2 girls at the bar. The restaurant is small, but they only offer happy hour at the bar so we weren't able to partake in the discount wine. I was disappointed with this because the wine options at the table were at least $13 per glass. I still ordered a glass of red wine (because you can't have pasta without wine!) and reviewed the food menu. We decided to come here because my friend wanted to try the cacio e pepe dish which is served in a giant pasta wheel tableside. The videos we saw on Yelp were quite impressive, and you really can't go wrong with cheese covered pasta.I ordered the asparagus lasagna, one friend chose the special with black squid ink linguine and shrimp, and the other friend ordered the cacio e pepe. We also ordered the eggplant appetizer which was basically chopped up sauteed eggplant with red sauce and parmesan. It was very flavorful, but not my favorite dish. The server also brought bread to our table; it was simple white Italian bread, thinly sliced and served with a plate of cold red sauce. I thought it was kind of odd to serve such simple bread with red sauce rather than butter...When our entrees arrived, I was excited to watch the cacio e pepe twirl around the cheese wheel. I was underwhelmed with the process, and after tasting my friend's dish, I was not impressed with the flavor. As for my lasagna, it was delicious. The asparagus was chopped into tiny pieces and combined with taleggio cheese which has a flavor similar to gorgonzola. It was very strong, almost too strong,  but the pasta was clearly homemade and cooked perfectly. The large square noodles were layered together to create a lovely blanket for the asparagus. Out of everything we tried, this was my favorite.I left feeling full and happy, which is always my goal when dining, but I felt bad spending $50 on a glass of wine and a pasta dish.

The restaurant is mostly know because of the pasta dish that is served table side-Tonnarelli cacio e pepe $20.House made pasta served table side, pecorino Romano, coarse black pepper. I mean it's just looks so cool when they bring the huge wheel of pecorino with warm pasta tossed inside and getting coated in the cheese as it begins to melt/soften from the heated pasta. It's so simple and so fresh. It's served as an entree but my group asked if we could have 4 plates and split the entree portion into 4 appetizer plates. So this was one of the best apps ever and certainly served here. -the Lamb Meatballs I would order as an entree lacked a bit of seasoning but they have since raked them off the menu. Shame. -The Lamb ragu with parpadell is the 2nd best dish on the menu. -dessert and cappuccino are tasty and satisfying. My favorite thing of all this is great food, a bit more upscale then your average pizza/pasta restaurant and yet not to expensive. I think you'll enjoy this nicer the average yet unpretentious eatery.",6,0,6,Kirsten S.,"Staten Island, NY",522,493,3228

1.0,2/7/2018,"Went in for restaurant week with friends. We couldn't believe how salty every dish was to the point we filled up our stomach with water more than the food itself. The busboy had to come and refill our water 9 times during our course there. Here's the part where it gets worse: When the waiter came to ask how the food was, we told him the food was way too salty. Typically, in this case, you are offered an alternative. He simply replied 'yeah?' And walked away. If he had offered another dish, I think I would have rated this place a 3 for customer service.

1.0,2/6/2018,"Yelp needs a 0 Star option..especially for this poor excuse of a restaurant. Originally went in with friends for a restaurant week dinner but we ended up ordering a pasta dish each instead. If the meal can be described in one word, it would be plain SALTY- and that's in all capitals. With each bite, we tried to come up with possible reasons for the level of saltiness and we came up with 1- the chef must have lost his sense of taste somehow 2- maybe our own tastebuds as a GROUP were just used to overly bland food 3- perhaps the actual chef wasn't in for the day so one of the waiters was back there chefing it up? My pasta dish of the Strozzapreti con anduja was the least appetizing of all of our dishes and it tasted like tomato sauce straight out of the can. Where most folks would end a good meal with a ""food coma"" comment, we ended ours saying we were going to fall into a SALT COMA. But the cherry on top was when the host came over to ask how our food was, I admitted that each dish had been too salty to which he replied, ""Yeah?"" ....and just walked away. He didn't offer any sort of apology or explanation or anything- he simply walked away and we sat there confused as to whether he was going to come back to continue the conversation or if I had just been blatantly and utterly disrespected. Needless to say, we will never be going back and we will definitely be advising all of our friends against eating at this restaurant. Horrible food & an almost comically disrespectful host but it was definitely a memorable dinner.",2,0,0,Bo K.,"Franklin Square, NY",94,80,74
1.0,2/4/2018,"I love Italian food and had been eyeing this cute place for a few years hoping for a chance to try it.  I was visiting my 95 year old mother-in-law who lives nearby at the Woodlands, when we popped into Bocca at about 7:00 Saturday night.  They were not full (though busy) and it was clear that we were an imposition to them by walking in without a reservation. They did seat us within 10 minutes but the guy plopped the silverware down and walked away, leaving me to seat my mother-in-law and myself.  The chairs were too heavy for her to seat herself and no one cared. (If you have never been to Italy, please know that they do NOT do this in Italy.)  The young man (manager?) who proudly announced that he was Scottish and Russian (and NOT Italian) had a downright nasty attitude toward my mother-in-law who asked about the cookbooks on display (which she could not see very well) and if there had been somewhere else to go, I would have walked out.  So we stayed. Thankfully we had a delightful lady as a server and her name is not on our receipt because I would love to thank her.  She was wonderful, but the food sadly, was not. I ordered spaghetti with bolognese sauce and it had sharp pieces of broken bay leaves and way too much anise and Italian sausage. It was smothered in mozzarella cheese! It was not even close to being a true bolognese sauce. We had the bruschetta which was average.  The salads were boring. The bread was good. The wine was a good pour, for a poor wine. We didn't stay for dessert. I do not live in Greenville so I have the benefit of making some good comparisons. Greenville has some GREAT restaurants with fabulous wait people.  This is not one of them.",0,0,0,Jill C.,"Charlotte, NC",35,26,0

Main courses wise, hubby got the salmon with leek and an artichoke mash (?)- he loved it! I ordered the steak with the wild mushrooms and the roasted garlic. The steak was the best well done piece of meat I have ever had. Don't judge, I like my meat well done, no pink for me yuck, and they managed to cook it perfectly for my taste while maintaining the moisture. I raved about it at each bite, and hours afterwards. I am craving it again writing about it!

1.0,8/30/2017,"I was a frequent customer of Bocca's...even had it delivered often until my friends and I were exposed to incredibly rude and shocking behavior by a staff member. There were 4 of us and we made a Thurs night reservation on Open Table since we still had at least 45+ minutes until closing. When we arrived, the folks in the restaurant were already closing and there was only one person behind the bar and a few staff members sitting at the bar. I asked about our rez and they said they closed early. I was like ""bummer"" but was asking if they could please make sure I was checked inor cancelled or cancelled on open table. One of the guys at the bar, before I could explain all I wanted was to make sure they cancelled my reservation, told us to ""move on"" and said, ""you're drunk, go home."" I was appalled. I was with 3ppl (one person in NYC for the first time) who had never been to Bocca and I was the one who suggested it. I told the manager behind the bar that I was absolutely insulted and disgusted, not to mention, we were all sober. All I wanted was ro address Open Table on my way out - to which he was in agreement yet, this rude individual inserted himself into an exchange that was friendly. I could never have imagined this treatment and having been in the service industry for many years, this person who interrupted a normal request (to make sure open table was cancelled) and accused myself and my friends of being intoxicated is unacceptable. As much as I used to give Bocca my business and have introduced new customers, I can no longer can do that ever again based on the people Bocca employs...I wouldn't want one dollar going to this obnoxious worker who clearly doesn't understand how to be polite not just as a worker, but as a human being.",0,0,0,Charity S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,24,3

2.0,8/22/2017,"I originally put 3 stars for this review. But I thought about the price I paid for the food and service.. nope. 2 stars. Granted--as you read on, please know that this is a review for Restaurant Week 2017 experience so not a full on dinning experience.First and foremost, I made a reservation and the hostess asked me to wait to be seated and asked if I was interested in sitting at the bar for a drink for now. I walked to the bar with my friends and realized there were at least 4 tables opened to be seated for us. So sure--she wanted to make more money by having us have some beverages by the bar, sure. We sat at the bar and waited for 30 minutes. I asked the hostess if we could sit down and she mentioned that I have to finish my drink first.. I was slightly taken aback and asked ""I can't bring it over there?"" She hesitated and said I would have to close my tab first. Well, of course--fine.We sat down and ordered the food off of the restaurant week menu. My friends ordered the following:-Meatball-Crab Cake-Beef Carpaccio-Porchetta-Pappardelle al Ragu di Agnello-Salmon-Panna Cotta-TortinoThe meatball was super disappointing. It was bland and presented in a large plate with three meatballs that gave the perception that they looked small. The crab cake was only ok to me (but I'm not really a fan of crab cake so I guess I wouldn't go off of what I rate). The beef carpaccio was also only alright. As for the main course.. the porchetta was actually not bad. It was very tender! But the pappardelle was not worth. It was very simple and just not amazing. The salmon wasn't bad either but just meh. Desserts were also not impressive--and I was just not happy to know that this whole course cost $65. On top of that, this was my first Restaurant Week experience. I didn't have a good experience and the food was just completely not worth. The service was also pretty slow considering that they didn't have that many customers either. I just.. *sigh*.

Mozzarella salad and veal meatball appetizers were very fresh and delicious as well.  My panna cotta dessert was OK.Only ding was that I had to wait a long time for my second round drink - bar was not keeping up with table service for some reason.  We dined at 7:00pm and it was like being the early-bird special seniors.  By 9:00pm when we were wrapping up, the place was hopping but still not crazy busy thanks to the summer escapees going to the Hamptons, NJ Shore or wherever else Gothamites flee to escape the concrete jungle on weekends!We enjoyed Bocca and would return to try more selections from their regular menu.",2,2,3,Daniel B.,"Bergen County, NJ",94,195,457

The restaurant is dimly lit with warm colors. This is definitely a date spot; there were at least six other couples in the dining room. Our server was very nice but seemed confused when we mentioned the Groupon we purchased. I prefer to tell the staff upfront about Groupon deals just to avoid any confusion at the end. We ordered the shrimp appetizer, the gnocchi, and the pork chop. The pork chop was thick and the mashed potatoes and gravy underneath were very good. The gnocchi came in a small bowl and while it was well sauced and seasoned, it was not enough for one person. The Groupon seemed like a very good deal at first but as our dishes came out, they were quite small. For example: the appetizer we had ordered was expensive and only came with three shrimp in total. I had hoped that the money we spent on the Groupon and the value that it was worth meant that the portions would be appropriately sized. We were still hungry after the meal.

I very much appreciated that the waiter came by as we were polishing it off and didn't rush to take the plate but instead recommended that we use the bread to clean out the last of the tomato sauce - a man after my own heart! The waiter recommended the Cacio e Pepe for me and my friend got the papardelle ragu. I didn't try hers, but I can say the Cacio e Pepe was out of this world. Made in a cheese bowl at the tableside, it was exciting to watch it being prepared, and even better to eat it! So flavorful and perfectly cheesy. The portion was generous and I was so full and happy. I will definitely go back there and get both of those excellent dishes.",0,0,0,Rama M.,"New York, NY",0,6,2

I kindly told our waiter that I do not eat meat and to take out the meat from a pasta i wanted to order and he would not do it. I find that pretty rude and inconsiderate, its not like I asked for a price adjustment. They should be more understanding towards peoples dietary restrictions.

4.0,10/31/2016,"I've been to Bocca a handful of times, so yes you could say ""I'm a fan."" I'm a big fan, actually. I really like it. The establishment and food seem so authentic from the staff being Italian and speaking passionately about the food to the perfection of the pasta. It's a quiet, dim, date spot, but for me it's about the food, particularly the pasta. It's cooked perfectly al-dente every time and the pasta dishes as a whole are executed delightfully. Most recently I had the duck confit pasta. It's a must order kind of dish. Creamy, savory and, rich are some adjectives that come to mind. The desserts are great too, as are the cured meats and accompaniments. From my experience, it is probably a good idea to let your waiter know how you want your meal brought to you while you're ordering. Remember, this place is authentic. I am unconventional in the sense that I order separate pastas for both my entree and appetizer (I like pasta). This caused the staff a bit of confusion in the timing of my meal as both pastas came out at once and the entree of the other person on my table was waiting for the pasta to be done. This is by no means a criticism of the restaurant. It was my fault if I can even call it a fault, but my advice to any other unconventional pasta orderer like myself would be to specify in your order how you'd like the food to come out. I would say Bocca is worth a trip back, but that would be old news because I've already been back many times, and will likely head back when I'm craving some real pasta.",1,0,0,Roy R.,"OZONE PARK, NY",55,64,60

I was violently vomiting all night. My spouse was nauseous, but mostly affected by diarrhea. I suspect the food poisoning was from the filet. I ordered mine medium-rare, but it came very raw. The inside was near purple. It looked like it had been seared on a very hot surface for a few short time, like one minute per side. Because I have eaten steak tartare before, I assumed it would be ok. Even still, I couldn't finish the most rare pieces of the dish and cut around it. In hindsight, I would have sent the dish back.

We had excellent service - when Anis was entertaining other tables, his fellow colleagues and the owner would make sure we were okay - pouring us water, refilling our glasses of wine, etc. Prior to our meal, our table was served with fresh bread and their homemade marinara sauce. As soon as I placed the bread and sauce in my mouth, the amount of flavor was out of control! It had the perfect acidic, garlic and sweet flavor. I bought a jar for home! I came here for the veal meatballs because of previous reviews and they were amazing! The consistency and the amount of flavor was perfect. For dinner, I had Fettuccine con anatra - delicious!

1.0,12/25/2015,"I would give this restaurant a negative review if I could, As a small business owner I know the importance of customer service. I had a reservation for Christmas dinner, my first experience in going out for a Holiday dinner. I called them and told the hostess that I was stuck in traffic and would be late. She kept me on hold for 10 mins then came back and said th restaurant was overbooked. I told her that was already on my way. My friend arrived before us and again told er we ere alost there. We were 35 mins late and as we walked in my friend told the hostess that the entire party was there. we sat at the bar for 30 minutes and I went to the hostess and asked her how long the wait would be. She told me that I was 40 mins late and she couldn't tell me when we could be seated and asked if we wanted to eat at the bar. I was with my elderly mom and aunt so asking if we wanted to eat at the bar was ridiculously. I know that we were late and I would have appreciated them just telling us that either we couldn't get a table or acting as if they cared enough by letting us know that we may have to wait an hour etc  I have never been treated so rudely and again I understand hat we were late but the way were were treated was awful. We called another restaurant got a reservation and we left. The hostess saw us leaving and never asked anything. If your restaurant is overbooked then you need a rockstar hostess. I would NEVER go back. On top of that it took the bartender 15 minutes to take my money to pay for a drink. Your hostess is the first person you talk to and that person should be trained properly.

The biggest problem was the service.  It took quite some time for a waiter to come take our drink order.  He may not even have been a waiter.  It may have been a manager pressed into waiter duty, as he was not dressed like the other members of the waitstaff.  After bringing our wine, he asked us for our orders.  My wife and I each ordered an appetizer and an entree.  The waiter did not write our orders down and repeated them back to us after we told him what we wanted.  Before even leaving the table, he had forgotten what my wife had ordered. About five minutes later, he came back to me and asked me what I had ordered because he had forgotten.  That said, our meals came out as ordered.  We also noticed all of the other waiters going over a list of specials with other tables.  We were not told of any specials and at that point it was too late anyway.Our waiter did not appear for quite some time while we were eating dinner.  At several other times, other waiters came by to see how we were doing.  Towards the end of our meal, one of the other waiters brought us a dessert that we were told was on the house and he said it was because we seemed to have been waiting a long time.  Its funny that other members of the waitstaff noticed this considered we had no outward display of displeasure.Seems like the service was due to a bad night and the atmosphere wasn't right for a relaxing night out.  I would return, but only other certain circumstances (family night out, large group).  Then again, there's plenty of other places for that too.",0,0,0,Peter M.,"Pelham, NY",0,15,0

We were seated promptly and our waiter was very friendly and funny. However it went downhill from there. After waiting 30 minutes for our food we asked again where it was. Instead of an apology they said that it would be out soon. Then the waiter came by and said the kitchen dropped the ticket and never made our food. The manager conveniently did not return to let us know what was going on. Then they brought out our Pasta which was supposed to come with our fish. We asked the waiter for the manager and explained that we wanted it all together. Then he said the kitchen did not forget our dish and it would be our shortly. After finishing the pasta our fish finally came out- but they gave they gave us each the wrong fish. Our waiter never came back so we flagged the manager down and said the fish was his fault that he gave it to the wrong person. We asked where our waiter was and with no explanation and in the middle of our meal he sent him home. No apology, he said he reached his max hours. I have never had a waiter disappear in the middle of a meal never to return. BIZARE. And the manager's comment was that that the waitress was now covering our table- the same waitress that we could not get the attention of for anything. Then we told him how terrible the service was. He never offered to send over a drink or anything to apologize for the long wait and terrible service. At the end of the meal we told him again of our displeasure.

The apps - one scummy oyster and a small piece of pork belly  $14. Then the bone marrow. What a laugh. You could hardly see it. The egg noodles I had were not made in the place but were GOODMAN's out of a box. And the Branzzino was dry and over cooked. The noise level was so high it was incredible and no one was saying anything of significance. Two well dressed intelligent looking guys walked in and could not believe it.  I unsubscribed from Groupon whose stock keeps tumbling after this one.

1.0,7/21/2014,"Let me preface this with I came here for NY Restaurant Week, which I consider an opportunity to impress customers enough to come back and pay full price for another meal.I made reservations over the phone as suggested since Restaurant Week is a busy time for restaurants. When I arrived 5 min before my reservation time, the hostess couldn't find my reservation even though I had called earlier to confirm it. Nevertheless, they had a table for two so we were still seated right away. I understand that it's the first day of Restaurant Week so a Monday night service is going to be overwhelming, but they only had one waitress visible and the manager was also taking orders. It took them almost 20 minutes for the manager to come take our order. The busboy was on point, offering us water and bread in the meantime.This trend followed for the entirety of our stay, making us wait 30 minutes between ordering and getting our appetizers. And then another 25 minutes between finishing our apps and getting our entrees. The busboy kept visiting us to refill our water glasses and clear our plates; very much the only attentive server we encountered. The party of 6 next to us waited just as long, but were plied with the alcohol the ordered raising the decibel level of the restaurant pretty high. The were very vocal about their wait.The food itself was delicious, but there was just something off with the presentation of each dish. For example, my salad was not cut up. It had whole pieces of lettuce and giant shavings of cheese. Sure, it made for a great picture, but there was no way to eat it without cutting it up first. Ending the meal was a slice of delicious tiramisu, but looked slopped on the plate since it was smushed on one side.Bottom line is the food was great, but not worth the wait. If you can deal with the wait by using delivery, that'd probably be your best bet. Great food without the service issues (except the fantastic busboy). What peeved me off the most is after the meal, I decided to price our meal. Restaurant Week pricing is a fixed $38 for a meal that cost each of us $43 off the regular menu. We only saved $5.

First of all, not only was there a $25 fixed price Restaurant Week menu (great deal!), there was also a $17 regular always-offered fixed price lunch menu (even better deal!). Both were 3 courses and both had amazing choices. Here's what we had: Appetizers were the vegetarian butternut squash soup and beet/ricotta with fig jam; both were excellent, especially the beets with ricotta. For mains, neither of us could resist the Rigatoni alla Norma, with just-right tomato sauce, ricotta salata and slightly crispy eggplant. And the desserts were perfect - the cheesecake was lighter than traditional and just the right amount and texture to finish a filling meal, and the cannoli were also better than expected and the perfect smaller size.

(Especially if you price dishes of pasta over 20$...).The Carbonara was SO full of pepper that it was difficult to finish. The recipe was wrong, they clearly used the whole egg instead of only using the egg yolk (the red part). That's a big mistake. It makes the carbonara sauce creamy, liquid, bland and white (instead of yellow). There wasn't guanciale (little pieces of meat you use for this dish) but really hard pieces of bacon. Also, parsley doesn't go in the carbonara.

By the end of the night, though, the waiters were more interested in their own awesome stories and drinking with the bartender than the were in tending to us.  I'm pretty low-maintenance in general (grew up in Brooklyn), but this place became downright rude by the end.  At one point, a busboy dropped a napkin on the floor at the table next to us, picked it up, then folded it and put it on the table for the next patron to use.  About 2 minutes later, he came back and replaced the napkin with a fresh one.  Good recovery, but still bad feelings left behind for us.  Overall worth a try, but we're not likely coming back here again.  Too many other good places in the city.",0,0,0,Joe J.,"New York, NY",2,7,0

Veal meatballs were practically raw, but owner insisted they were cooked through. Dinner took too long to come out. I've never been so disappointed in an entree in my life. Salmon portion was petite and over a few sliced potatoes, pork shoulder was served dry over some heavily oiled broccoli rabe, and pasta with mussels was excessively peppery without any flavor.

If Italian sounds appealing, you can do a lot worse than Bocca. It appears to be a secret judging by the absolutely empty (but well-appointed) dining room, but they offer a whole host of panini and pasta for only $9. I was quite pleased with my pappardelle al ragu di agnello (braised lamb shank), and she equally satisfied by her rigatoni. After all, it isn't often you can sit down for quality, cooked to order, flavorful pasta in Manhattan at this price point. To be sure, the portions aren't enormous, but combined with very decent bread and what I believe to be a (quite tasty) sun-dried tomato dip, you can easily make it your midday meal.",4,1,1,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4675,3021,10459

Don't like to leave hungry. We ordered  the pappardelle pasta with a tomato braised lamb shank with a nice  dollop of ricotta on top. It was delicious. I also ordered the Porchetta alla romana and that was pretty tasty too. The roasted red onion and broccoli rabe really made it a good combo when paired with the pork shoulder. For an appetizer we had the Crostini con polipo e chorizo which was kind of forgettable. The chorizo, octopus, and chick peas over toasted bread just didn't seem to work well together and was very hard to scoop up with the fork utensil.We finished off our dinner with a nice flourless chocolate molten cake that  featured a scoop of homemade pistachio gelato. Despite the tiny size it proved  to be rich and satisfying. I would not skip on this dessert here.The service here was above average. The maitre d' was extremely friendly at the door and took our coats with gusto. Make sure to book reservations in advance, especially on the weekend.

The salmon was good and flavorful.  Great wine selection.   A nice place to impress, especially for a date. It is a bit loud.  They take reservations on Open Table and I would make them.  It seemed pretty crowded for a Thursday night. Pretty expensive. I'm not sure I would come back here for the price. Food:  I was here for an interview dinner so it was nice to get a really decadent assortment of appetizers. The cheese and meat plate was a nice start.  The meatballs were very flavorful, but the portion was very small - three meatballs.  The pan seared Alaskan salmon was cooked well, the potatoes were thinly sliced and had a delicate spice.  I was disappointed in the broccoli rabe.  To be honest, I had entree envy.  The cappricci (durum pasta with sausage, cream and buffalo mozzarella) looked great and got amazing reviews from my peers. If I wasn't concerned about fitting into a wedding dress, that would have been my entree. What knocked off an extra star was the cannoli.... so excited about the cannoli and when I bit down into it, what flavor do I taste but LEMON!? Lemon cannoli... no thank you. The filling was also off, someone at the table mentioned it was too light and possibly whipped too much and I agree. Service: Can't complain, but I wasn't paying attention.

Overall, a decent Italian restaurant - but nothing that stood out above and beyond the other vast pool of Italian restaurants in NYC.

We had ordered the fennel salad, but they accidentally gave us the arugula salad. After we took a few bites of the arugula salad (which was delicious!), we decided to let them know they sent us the wrong salad hoping they'd just leave us this one.

The noodles (I believe) were handmade and al dente. My friend had the  Linguine with clams which she said was pretty good. The portion sizes might not be enough for someone who has a huge appetite, though. We wanted to get the molten cake for dessert, but they ran out of pistachio ice cream!!

It was a little overpriced for such small portions, especially the appetizers.  The pasta was definitely under-cooked, and went cold rather quickly.What really makes them get two stars was that they split our checks wrong, and then hovered over us while we were trying to figure out how to pay with our two cards. I'm sure they thought we were going to dine and dash. They made us feel very uncomfortable and rushed, and our waiter got very close to yelling at us.

For main entree I ordered the Tonnarelli Cacio E Pepe ($17), it is a house pasta served table side inside a huge wheel of pecorino cheese. I'm going to say it is the best dish I've had in a long time. The white sauce was delicious, very heavy on the butter and the cheese was sharp. I could have licked my plate if it wasn't frowned upon in public. My fiance ordered the Porchetta ($26) a roasted pork shoulder. I do not eat pork so I can't attest to the flavor but he finished his entire plate, including the spinach. We decided to skip dessert because we were very full. The portions are not huge, but are very filling. I would like to return, even with a large group of friends. The entire meal was great, we were not rushed even though the restaurant was full on a Wednesday night. Thank you for a great dining experience!",0,0,0,Irina L.,"New York, NY",98,58,70

It was 6:30pm and was pouring outside so there were only a few tables seated when we arrived, the crowd started to pick up at around 7pm. We sat next to this old couple who were frequent diners at Bocca, they knew the staff well and was telling us how much they love the food, service and atmosphere here. They recommended veal meatballs so we ordered that as appetizers, as well as eggplant to share. Both were yummy. I opted for the pasta special which was decent, (btw - huge portions) and hubby ordered pork shoulder which he said was ~3 stars. A young couple next to us on the other side ordered their famous ""Cacio E Pepe"" - the big wheel looks really cool and they said it was delicious.Overall, Bocca offers a romantic ambiance with exceptional service.

4.0,1/1/2013,"'Twas a couple days after Xmas, and we needed someplace spiffy to take a friend (a former NYer who misses Manhattan) for a birthday lunch. Bocca filled the bill admirably. You can't not love a room with a big sun-god staring at you in the front and a huge poster for Fellini's Roma inviting you in the back, plus retro-beatnik lighting fixtures giving the place an orange vibe. My three items were standouts--eggplant timbale (pant, drool), veal polpetti (oh, oh), and ricotta cheesecake (mmm). This is five-star stuff. But I do have to know how the frontline pasta is, too, so I had a couple forkfuls of our birthday guest's linguine vongole--and it was so spicy that it burnt all the way down. Nothing suggested that it would be fierce. Problem! (She managed to eat it with no ill effects, but still...)Fine service--when I complained that my coke tasted weird (""Izzit diet or just from the fountain?""), my server opened a can for me. Our third partner had a veg panini that she said was quite good and I thought was tres cute.I want to go back for that same timbale/meatballs/dessert combo.

My date had the evening's special...that featured short rib and what not mixed all up in it and I, the Capricci...which had spicy sausage in a light sauce.I found both lacking in flavor and although pretty to look at... unremarkable in the mouth. Both meat additions seemed to require extra chewing to safely slide down our throats.

Immensely friendly, and the bartender was chatting away with some Italian tourists in their native tongue. Always a good sign! Great selection of wines and liquor. We each got an appetizer, and all were delicious. I did a fennel salad, because it was one of the two vegetarian options. The other one was a beet and goat cheese appetizer that sounded so awesome, but it came with fig jelly and I don't care for figs (blasphemous, I know). I tried some of my friend's and it was truly delicious. Everyone else got meat or fish appetizers and raved about them. I stole some fresh mozzarella from one, and it was so good. A perfect creamy/firm texture. Our entrees continued to impress. There was only one vegetarian option (gnocci with basil and fresh mozzarella) and it was very well prepared, if a little bland. Finally dessert. I got the cannoli, but only because no one else ordered it and I wanted to try everything. It was delicious... totally reminded me of the buckets of cannoli I ate in Italy (showing up to the bakery just as they put the pastries in the window so I could grab them fresh). However, the other desserts were better. The tiramisu had an amazing, almost-too-strong-but-not-quite flavor. But the winner was the panna cotta. Oh my lord, creamy and dreamy!It took a while for us to get our bill, but I think this may have been because we were talking nonstop and went through about 5 bottles of wine. I'm sure the waitress just didn't want to make us think they were getting rid of us! She was incredibly friendly, and talked to us about her hometown in Italy. There are lots of restaurants like Bocca in NYC, so I don't know if I would ever choose to go there again, just because nothing really blew me away and there were limited vegetarian options.

We waited almost an hour for our appetizer to arrive, and when we questioned what was taking so long, the waiter replied, ""eggplant takes a long time because they need to make sure it's cooked all the way through."" Are you kidding me? It's eggplant! I would have much rather preferred the truth and an apology. The waitress then spent the rest of our time there avoiding contact whatsoever. Our entree took just as long to show up, and then, only my plate came. I sat there and waited to eat, as is polite, and when I was able to flag down another waiter, we were told my friend's plate of pasta took a long time because it was served in a giant wheel of cheese. After a few minutes her pasta did come out in an enormous wheel of cheese, which was then transferred into a bowl. I had to laugh, however that clearly wasn't as time consuming as they said. We were never offered an apology for the wait, and the staff couldn't seem to care less that we were starving.

The sauce would have been better had it been warmer and a tad spicier.  Our waitress was attentive without being intrusive. We started with one of the special appetizers, the panzanella salad. It was fine if a bit bland. The tomatoes were just OK but they did add prosciutto which made it tastier. The wine list is adequate and my date ordered a very lovely 2006 Vino Nobile di Montepulciano Riserva. For main courses I had the pappardelle al ragu di agnello in bianco which although the braised lamb shank was very flavorful the noodles were a bit sticky and just on the wrong side of al dente.  My date had the Porchetta alla romana, slow roasted pork shoulder ""porchetta"" with sautéed broccoli rabe and red onion marmalade which was outstanding.  The red onion marmalade gave it a sweet flavor that was almost like cranberry sauce and it matched perfectly with the porchetta.

5.0,11/2/2011,"Came here last night (Tuesday) just as my groupon was expiring, and I had a great time! We made reservations for 7:30, and even though they didn't find the reservation (maybe do it online instead of calling next time?) they managed to seat us quickly. The place was full, but not packed.So I have to say something about the complimentary bread - the dipping sauce is really good! Great start to the meal.We started off with the Saltimbocca di gamberoni (prosciutto wrapped shrimp), and my boyfriend said it was the best shrimp he had ever tasted. The shrimp was cooked just right, although I thought the prosciutto made it a bit too salty. I also loved the crispy polenta and cheese fondue that came with it - delicious!I got the Malfatti di cocoa con brasato di manzo (coca flavored pasta). You could definitely taste the cocoa, and I thought it was delicious and unique. The short rib was tasty, too. My only complaint is that after a while the pasta clumped, so its texture wasn't quite as good as in the beginning. This is one of their specialties (according to the waiter), and I'd definitely recommend it.My boyfriend had the Pappardelle al ragu' di agnello (ribbon pasta with lamb). Since I'm not a fan of lamb, I only had a few bites. The texture of the pasta was quite good. No comment on the sauce, since I tried to avoid it.The service was excellent. We had a wonderful waiter who was attentive and made great recommendations. Our water glasses were always filled. Overall, ambiance was great.Price was also very reasonable. Our meal was $60 before taxes, and we've definitely paid that for far worse meals. One note, though - since we had a groupon and therefore ended up with a bill of less than $10, we couldn't use a credit card to pay for our meal (even though adding tip would have put us way over the $15 minimum). So make sure to bring cash if you're using a groupon!Conclusion: yes, I'd come back. And maybe try that wheel of cheese thing that I read about here...",1,0,0,Danielle Z.,"Manhattan, NY",1,82,0

At this time our server did NOT say ANYTHING about our order.. NOTHING until we made eye contact AND THEN she said it should be RIGHT out.

I don't even eat much but I definitely did not feel that was a ""deal"" when their other, full size plates are only $2-3 more.  I like their decor and how close it is to my work but the food hasn't stood out yet.  I reckon third time's the charm... hopefully.  And if not, there's no abundance of chic little italian restaurants in NYC",1,0,0,GG K.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,110,2

NotwhereIthoughtI'dbe. Butok. OK, because this is a great place. Nabille (sp?), the barkeep, really made things happen. I was running the Super Spartan obstacle course race the next morning, so I needed carbs, and I needed wine. Well, the carbs were for the race, the wine is more of a general requirement. So I devoured the breadbasket, along with the oil / tomato mix that came with it. Nabille brought me more. The glass Supertuscan wine was excellent, truly excellent. Nabille topped me off gratis. Gratzi. The house-made ribbon pasta with lamb was remarkable. I wiped the plate clean of sauce with some more of that bread. ""Something sweet?"" Nabille asks. No thanks, between the bread and pasta, I've had my carbs. That's fine with him, but he insists on a lemoncello, on the house, for luck for my race in the morning. Gratzi. Then one more. Gratzi molte. The restaurant was a bit empty for friday night, which was surprising. It seemed Nabille had made friends with other diners that evening already, as several stopped to say goodnight on their way past the bar and out into the rain.

A few buck the trend and actually hold themselves to the standards that all other kinds of restaurant are held to. Unfortunately, Bocca was not one of them. I had their pasta with sardines, and must say, the fresh pasta at fluorescent-lit Eataly is way better than this crap. I liked the mussels appetizer, and the cannoli dessert. My girlfriend loved her plate of pasta and lamb, but was upset that they ruined her ice cream dessert by pouring hot coffee all over it.But, in general, a good experience.

4.0,7/19/2011,"I think I finally found a moderately priced, really tasty Italian restaurant near my office, hooray!!! We decided to try Bocca for Restaurant Week last night and I can say that it was almost perfect!! The hostess was very sweet and seated us even though we were 10 minutes early (you know some places are obnoxious and make you wait until the clock strikes your exact reservation time to seat you) Our waiter literally popped out of nowhere and greeted us hanging over the empty table next to us - total metro-Italian creepster but in a very endearing way (we loved making jokes about him amongst ourselves the rest of the night). He was a great server and his suggestions were spot on - my boyfriend had the Red Hook and it was very good albeit a bit too strong for my lightweight love (sorry babe). For me, he suggested a merlot-cabernet hybrid and although I don't remember the name - it was delicious. The warm and crispy semolina bread goes great with the oily marinara dipping sauce and I think the busboy was about to offer me a loaf to take home because we couldn't get enough of it! T had the mussels appetizer and he said they were very flavorful and cooked well and I had the mixed greens salad with sherry vinaigrette - you can't really screw up a mixed greens salad. The star was an extra appetizer that we ordered - the pineapple carpaccio with crispy prosciutto, ricotta cheese and honeycomb. Whoever decided to try pineapple with ricotta should win an award because this unlikely pair is incredible!! The pineapple was fresh and sweet and the creamy, salty cheese cut right into that sweetness. For the main course T had the salmon - I'm not a fish person but he said it was very good but a bit salty. I could tell they cooked it in the salt crust and there was no sauce on it so I think the salt just took over the salmon for him. The cannelloni beans with the salmon were delicious! I had the papparadelle with lamb and it was so simple and delicious. The basic tomato sauce really let the lamb flavors take over the dish and it was sooo good!! The pasta was fresh and light, not like that heavy stuff you get in a lot of restaurants, which proves it is homemade. The flourless chocolate cake with chocolate gelato was awesome and the vanilla gelato was very tasty - they poor some espresso over it, giving the vanilla a little kick but eat fast, it's melting.

You are  the familiar with an exciting and thrilling new twist.  This cute little place tucked away on 19th street is my new favorite Italian place.  When my friend and I went, they had just changed the menu for the season.  The head waiter's description of the food were excellent.  All of his recommendations were spot on.  At his suggestion, my friend and I tried a very dessert-y sounding appetizer, pineapples with ricotta and crisp italian bacon, lightly drizzled with honey.  O.M.G.  The combination of tart, sweet, salty and the mild were out of this world.  It was so good, we were contemplating whether we should order another plate. You know how most places are only good for one dish and the rest are well, meh?  Well, this place does the exact opposite.  For the main course, my friend had the fish and I had the pasta with sicilian sardines.  Wow, the raisins were a delightful counter balance to the saltiness of the sardines.  My friend's fish must have been good because when I looked up from my plate of pasta, it was gone!Now, the dessert.  Ahem.  At the head waiter's recommendation (again) who described it in the most delightful way:  the espresso drowned.  How can you resist?  It was home made vanilla gelato with espresso poured over it, with crumbles of amaretto cookies.  Oh. wow just wow.  We were both laughing and smiling, that when the waiter came over to check on us, he left saying, your faces said everything.  When we left Bocca, we were still smiling.  happy, relaxed, content and a bit excited (must be that drowned espresso).",0,0,0,codex g.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0

5.0,3/13/2011,"It's about time I reviewed you, Bocca. Psst--we really need to be able to give half-stars on Yelp. Bocca is a 4.5.I went here with my mom, sister, and a BFF for my mom's birthday in December. The service before I even got there was outstanding. See, I made reservations on Opentable, and in the ""Comment/request"" box, I wrote that my mom was coming in from out of town and it was her birthday. I told them I wasn't looking for any freebie stuff; all I wanted was for them to treat my mom like she was the most amazing woman in the world (which is a fact, BTW). A few hours before dinner, I got a call from Nico, who I believe is the manager. He was very sweet and confirmed they would be happy to treat my mom well for her birthday, and I should ask for him when we got to the restaurant. Men, take note: the importance of paying attention to detail cannot be overstated. Bocca is a cozy space, and I was thrilled that Nico sat us in a roomy corner table. If I'm seated in a comfy space, I'll stay at your restaurant for a long time and spend more money--that was a win for Bocca. I can't remember what all of us ordered, but I do know we started with the salumi e formaggi plate, and the cheese was so perfect it brought tears to my eyes. I got the branzino with crab hash as my entree, and the crab hash melted in my mouth. My mom ordered the fusilli alla norcina, and she raved about the sausage. Nico and our waiter emerged at the end of dinner to sing ""Tanti Auguri"" to my mom, serving her an apple tart with a candle on top. That was a sweet touch. Would definitely return.",2,1,1,Shana S.,"New York, NY",128,59,11

3.0,2/18/2011,"So...I was SURE I had my first five star review coming upon arrival. My date and I had a reservation, were seating immediately (in a full restaurant), and the bread and olive oil/tomato dipping sauce were heavenly... (we had two of each!) All of the above was complimented by the great space: perfect lighting (not too high/low), great color scheme/matching artwork, cool concaved wood slat ceiling. Now, let's start going downhill. Our waiter was very attentive for the brief time he served us (and, yes, he was still in the restaurant, just not available some 20-30 minutes in). The first dish I ordered (after a good bit of consideration) had 'just run out' and a menu reconsideration was called for. I originally ordered the pan-roasted free range chicken and switched to the oven-roasted branzino, altered to include the rosemary potato and broccoli rabe from the chicken. Let's just say the dish was both over- AND under-whelming. The fish was strangely sweet (and why I didn't return it is beyond my momentary grasp), but I mostly drowned out the sweetness with lemon wedges I requested to improve the flavor. The potatoes were tasty, but the brocolli rabe was very bitter and not well balanced by the accompanying onions and garlic. My date's dish, the pan-roasted salmon, was blandly tasty (if a bit salty and seemingly buttery) with the 'apple cider foam' on the side (where it surely belonged: ICK). Back to a bit o' plus: our 'created' starter beet salad sans cheese was phenomenal. Just a great mix of field greens and beets with a tasty vinaigrette: YUM.Lastly, the noise level was bearable, but a bit much. All in all, I was hoping to be wowed and was only mildly entertained. I'll return because my OpenTable discount was rejected (I missed reading the micro-type that mentioned such discounts were not accepted on Saturday. Imagine that?), and goodness knows I LIKE saving a few shekels. Here's hoping trip number two will be more impressive.",0,0,0,Randy S.,"Chicago, IL",25,127,58

4.0,2/13/2011,"First, it's very small and and almost unnoticeable from the outside. You might walk past it. However, upon entering it's definitely much bigger than you'd expect from the outside. It's a happening place and was very busy, which was expected since it was Valentine's Day weekend on a Saturday at 8 pm. We arrived much earlier than our reservation (about ten after 7 pm). They seated us at around 7:30. The restaurant is dimly lit, which makes it perfect for a romantic/private dinner. There are generic posters/pictures of various Italian figures on the walls. The staff is very friendly. The hostess was very accommodating for our early arrival. The bartender was helpful in explaining a few choices to my girlfriend as we waited at the bar. Our server was very friendly and informative as well.For starters, we split the mozzarella with roasted vegetables. The vegetables were roasted perfectly. Fresh mozzarella with a hint of olive oil and spices is always a hit. In addition, they constantly kept the basket with fresh bread full. They serve a garlic sauce with it, which was delicious. The appetizer was served and removed from the table in a timely fashion. The main course was served shortly thereafter. i had the jumbo shrimp in lobster creme and my girlfriend had the salmon. The shrimp was cooked perfectly. It wasn't spongy/chewy and or stiff. It was cooked evenly and seasoned properly. The lobster sauce was fantastic, which was sweetened with butter, but it still had the fish taste (which I liked). The rest of the dish (spatzel, pancetta and brussells sprouts) complimented the lobster creme well. The brussell sprouts may have been overcooked, but it may have been a combination of it being cooked properly and then it continued to cook with everything else on the dish. Regardless, when they were all combined with the sauce, I didn't have a problem cleaning off the plate. My girlfriend had the salmon, which according to her, was cooked so well that it seemed like she was cutting into butter with a hot knife. Unlike other restaurants, the center of the fish was also cooked, instead of it being slightly raw. According to her, the spaghetti squash was delicious. It was almost as good as the salmon. It was very tasty and suited the dish well. She didn't like the apple cider foam, which sat beneath everything, because as you can tell from the name, it was very sweet; too sweet for her tooth. Others may not have this problem. So if the food, staff, and ambiance were great, why only 4/5 stars? After the dishes from the main course were collected, we literally waited about 30 minutes before our table was revisited by the waiter--or anyone for that matter. How long did we wait? As our main dishes were collected, the couple to my right were about halfway into their main course. The couple to my left just had their main courses served. By the time we received our bill, the couple to my right had already been served desert, coffee, and had their table cleaned. The couple to my left had finished their main course and started on their dessert (which also took time to choose, serve, and eat). Do the math. It was an inexcusable amount of time for us to be kept waiting. From the restaurant's side, I can understand keeping a party waiting if they had all their courses served and they're waiting on the bill. The restaurant wants you to hang around in case you want to spend more money. But that wasn't the case here. We weren't even offered drinks, coffee, or dessert after our main course was collected. It's not as if the waiter went on a lunch break or left for the day. He was still roaming the floor and serving the couples to my left and right. There's no reason for him to think we were still eating since our table was clean. It got to the point where I wanted to see how long it would be until someone acknowledged our existence. The answer is about 30+ minutes. I DID want dessert, but by the time he came back, I was so displeased with how we were treated I passed on it. Luckily, I had dessert at home. One final note on prices, yes, it's an expensive place, but it's expected, especially on a holiday weekend. Maybe the portions are small to some people, but I found them to be perfectly sized. With a split appetizer and some bread and a dish of the main course, I was full--but not to the point where I felt sick. It's a great place and it would have been a perfect dinner, but the last 30 or so minutes almost ruined it all.",0,0,0,Joseph A.,"Middle Village, NY",18,18,7

The place itself is small and the seating is quite tight (they should invest in a coat check-in to save some space) but the decor is cozy. The waiter was nice and suggested a decent bottle for us that complimented our meals: Greco di Tufo Mastroberardino 2007. Slightly bitter & on the drier side with a crisp end. ($50 bottle)The bread wasn't bad considering it was plain.Appetizers:(1) Polpettine della nonna (Veal meatballs, tomato sauce and grated parmigiano) - My boyfriend enjoyed it but I couldn't tell you otherwise as veal is the one the I won't eat.(2) ""Ravioli"" di barbabietola con caprino (Roasted red beets ""ravioli""filled with goat cheese and honey-thyme vinaigrette) - I thought the goat cheese was over-powering and didn't blend well with the rest of the ingredients.  Entrees:(1) Salmone in padella conspaghetti di zucca e spuma al cider (Pan roasted Alaskan King salmon fillet served with spaghetti squash and apple cider foam) - decent. Nothing that was spectacular.(2) Polletto in padella alla cacciatora (Pan roasted organic semi-deboned Bell & Evan's chicken,rosemary potato, broccoli rabe and black olive and red vinaigrette reduction) - another decent selection but lacked the ""wow"" factor. The chicken was juicy but the bone didn't seem appropriate for the dish.Dessert:(1) Cioccolato (Flourless brownie, chocolate mousse  and house made pistachio cream) - not that great.(2) Torta di mele (Apple butter milk cake and cinnamon gelato) - my favorite thing all night.

The ceiling is really neat, (sounds weird, I know) but it's long slats of dark wood....it looks somewhat like a bunch of park benches on the ceiling (as one of my co-workers pointed out). There are comfortable booths along the walls and dark wood tables up the middle of the room with red lamps hanging down above them. Since it was restaurant week I took advantage of the prix fixe deal. For my appetizer I had the Tuscan bean soup. It was very good. I liked the thicker texture and it had a nice hearty taste.For my entrée I had the Rigatoni alla Amatriciana. The pasta was good, not great. I liked the slight spice to the sauce but it was a little over-salted. The pecorino cheese was very good but I couldn't taste the guanciale at all.Having the sweet-tooth that I have I really enjoyed the dessert course.

I went in for a light dinner and ended up really full. Prices are good, the inside is nice but pretty standard, servings are good, service is good, ingredients are quality.

What went wrong?The bone marrow probably wasn't cooked well. It wasn't nice and spreadable. Ok, it was at the ends, perfect, buttery and creamy, bursting with marrow goodness, but after the very first dip of the knife it became globular and even pink and seemed over rendered and at the same time not cooked enough.Well, what about the gnocchi?

2.0,10/14/2010,"For those of you who don't know, NYC restaurant week is a wonderful time of year when about 100 restaurants offer a $35, 3 course prix fixe dinner (half or even less than half of what it would normally cost).  It's a great way to try places that you wouldn't necessarily try otherwise. It's a perfect opportunity for restaurants to lure new customers in and give them a great reason to return. Or not. The problem with this approach is that a lot of the time, the prix fixe choices become sort of half-assed representations of what the restaurant is capable of...and don't always showcase the best of their abilities.

Well, I'll start with the positive. The company was fantastic. It's amazing how much fun a group of strangers can have, and regardless of our meals- we had a blast. The service was fine. Nothing special, but nothing terrible either. (although they did forget to take a coffee order until someone finally asked about it) Our meals were fine. Nothing was bad, but nothing was so fabulous that any of us will be chomping at the bit to go back. I started with a homemade mozzarella and tomato salad. The tomatoes were unbelievable and I was happy to find out that they were from the Union Square Farmer's market. They were probably my favorite part of the whole meal. The cheese was fresh and had a nice flavor, but was a bit dense and stringy for what should have been a creamy consistency. The one small basil leaf left something to be desired and I felt a little gypped. My entree was a linguine with pesto and fresh crab. It was incredibly over-salted and had way too much garlic- even for a garlic lover like myself. The pesto itself was so strong and overpowering that I completely lost the crab taste altogether when it really should have been the star of the dish. The pasta was quite good actually, but I think I would have appreciated that a lot more if the sauce wasn't so strong. For dessert I had the chocolate option, because is there really any other option if chocolate is one of them? I think not. It was pretty tasty. It's pretty hard to disappoint me if there is chocolate and ice cream in the same dish. That said, it was good but forgettable, generic, and the presentation was eh. All in all, this was a fine choice for a great deal, but there are better options out there. I should mention that some of the other dishes on the table were far superior to what I ordered, so it might warrant another try with different choices. Then again, we live in a city with 20,000 dining options so for me, it's on to the next.",0,0,0,Carey Y.,"Sarasota, FL",407,338,3
3.0,9/27/2010,"I ordered the tonnarelli cacio e pepe and it was pretty good. I recommend this dish just for the experience of watching the waiter prepare the dish in a giant cheese wheel. For dessert, I ordered the sfogliatelle and panna cotta for dessert. Both were a disappointment. The sfogliatelle tasted old and stale. I could have blocked out the not so fresh taste if it was warmed up a little. The chocolate panna cotta tasted like generic chocolate mouse cake. I'm a sucker for dessert but unfortunately bocca did not satisfy my sweet tooth.",0,1,0,Katy H.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,205,56
3.0,9/20/2010,"I felt that Bocca, while serving decently tasty pasta and having a nice ambiance, was still rather average and just a middle-of-the-road Italian restaurant for me. There are tons of similar restaurants in the city so it really comes down to if you're in the area. I wouldn't make a special trip just to come here. Me and my roomie really only came here since they were participating in Free Dessert Day (woohoo!) and they were conveniently located near her office. We both ordered the special setaro spiral pasta with sweet sausage and smoked buffalo mozzarella. Personally, I couldn't detect any difference between the setaro pasta and normal pasta but whatever! It didn't take as long to cook as they say, and came out in a normal span of time. The sauce was pretty flavorful but I do wish the sausage came in bigger pieces, the pieces were miniscule! My roomie found it a tad salty but I was ok. Our dessert was definitely the highlight of the meal though rather than the pasta (which seems kind of sad). We got the cioccolato, which was basically chocolate cake, chocolate mousse, and pistachio ice cream! yum!

4.0,7/20/2010,"Though I had never heard of Bocca, I was recently lured to the classy spot through positive reviews and the proximity to the movie theater.  The dining destination possessed a romantic and elegant vibe, yet remained extremely casual and straight-forward in its presentation.  Some people say that simple food done well is better than anything elaborate, and Bocca was a prime example of that theory.My friend and I were seated at a comfortable table and amusingly greeted by a charismatic waiter that resembled Johnny Depp, but with a thick Italian accent.  He started us off with some dry slices of Italian and whole wheat bread with a bland tomato olive oil dip.  Our smiles faded, but we kept our hopes high for the upcoming meal.  A refreshing glass of their signature white sangria turned my frown upside down, though.  The crisp and potent white wine was laced with pears, spices, and home made bitters.  Our pastas soon arrived and both were perfectly portioned.  Our sauces were light, yet satisfying and full of flavor.  My imported bucatini pasta was blended with sardines, pine nuts, raisins, and toasted crumbs.  The foreign spaghetti had an interestingly hollow center, because it had been hang-dried with a string.  Chunks of the fresh, fishy sardines added a taste of the ocean, while the raisins provided a balance of sweetness.  The breadcrumbs and pine nuts added a pleasing crunch of texture.  My companion's spiral pasta was tossed with sweet sausage, a dollop of cream, and grated buffalo mozzarella.  Between the meat links and gooey cheese, the dish packed a powerful, smokey flavor.Each bite of Bocca's delectable pasta transported us straight to Italy.  The affordable prices and amiable service were added bonuses that were sure to bring us back again and again.",2,0,1,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640
3.0,7/17/2010,"Restaurant Week is usually not the best way to showcase a restaurant's true ability. Although not outstanding, Bocca held its own as a cute, plush Italian restaurant with very friendly service. The maitre'd greeted me as soon as I arrived. I had a drink at the bar while I waited for the rest of my party to arrive. The bartender was very friendly and jovial, making all sorts of jokes. I felt right at home. Oddly enough for an Italian restaurant, there are some pretty good beers available by the bottle - I was mildly surprised to see Lagunitas offered here. Only one Tuscan red was available by the glass, most of the reds were from Sicily. We were seated in a comfy booth along one side of the restaurant. I had the mozzarella and tomato appetizer to start. The tomatoes were so sweet - this is what summer is all about! The cheese, however, was a bit dry and stringy - not the creamy texture you expect from mozzarella. For the main course, the salmon was a nice cut, about 4 ounces or so, but it was just that - a piece of fish, no vegetables to garnish, etc. The slightly molten chocolate cake was good, but the cake itself was a little dry. The a la carte menu featured many homemade pastas which might be worth a shot if you are in the area.",1,1,1,Dana F.,"Queens, NY",665,925,146

The chicken was perfectly cooked that even the chicken breast was juicy. Dessert was amazing. I had the affogata which was homemade gelato ice cream with crunchies on top and you pour espresso on top.

4.0,5/12/2010,"Yay for the opentable app on my bberry! I was able to swoop in and save the day after our reservations were mysteriously lost at Maialino. Looking for something classy, delicious, not too crazy pricey, opentable led us to Bocca with practically zero expectations.I was pleasantly surprised with an enjoyable and yummy meal I had here. The crabcake appetizer (Polpettine Di Granchio) was divine and that cucumber salad was so fresh and light I ate all of it before I even got to the crab. The cakes were 99.1% crab with a very thin breading and lightly fried. They were fluffy and the sauce had a nice kick to it. For my main, I had the waiter surprise me and ended up with the suckling pig. It was super tender, yummy. My only complaint was that the oil from the meat seeped out on the rest of the plate making the side dishes oily. Loved the artichoke though. I also tried the Linguine Nere Con Aragosta (Black linguine with lobster and bacon in a creamy corn sauce)! This was my favorite - I absolutely loved it! The corn sauce was original and so comforting and creamy. And hello!!! Lobster and bacon anyone??!  Also good was the Capricci Alla Norcina (sweet sausage pasta).  I'll have to come back and get the cacio e pepeOther highlights: * Loved the atmosphere* Loved our waiter who was charming, actually Italian, and helpful.* Loved the bread basket with the tomato pesto oil to dip it in.

The salad (with dried cherries) was just fantastic and the half-price wines on Sunday is a joke - by which I mean I have no idea how they offer that great of a deal. Then the hell came... really undercooked pasta and a side of mushrooms that were oily and tasteless. We were surprised. Also the bread they served was stale and kind of obviously so.

Everyone there was dressed up like they have places to go, while my gf and I were in simple jeans and sweaters. Although like Basta, they didn't have any tables on a face numbing cold temperature Saturday, they did offer to seat us at the bar.

3.0,2/3/2010,"I came here on a Sunday night for Restaurant Week, and the food was honestly underwhelming compared to the decor and location.  The inside is beautiful, nice balance of modern and cozy, big mirrors, chic pillows.  Much more of a romantic vibe than a ""big group"" vibe, although I saw two parties of 6.  The restaurant was half-full when we arrived, and we were seated immediately.  Service: The hostess' manner was so-so, but the servers were very attentive and friendly.  Our main server was fairly soft-spoken which was problematic, but he knew his stuff.  The guys that served the food seemed very dedicated; one of them put down a plate, turned it two inches counter-clockwise, picked it up again, moved my friend's drink from one side to another, then placed the plate down again.  We were both mystified as to why, but I guess he was following some kind of schematic in his head.  Both they and the main server were great about refilling water promptly.Food: Sadly, this was rather disappointing.  I had the octopus appetizer, the tonnarelli cacio e pepe, and the brioche pudding with five spice ice cream.  The octopus was nicely flavored and very tender, but it came spread out thinly on the bottom of what appeared to be a soup bowl.  Strange plating.  The tonnarelli came out in the awesome cheese wheel, but they just plop it onto a plate.  While the dish had incredibly strong flavors of pepper and cheese, it didn't have anything more complex than that.  Besides which, it's hard to get excited about a lump of pale pasta flecked with pepper on a completely white plate... they may want to rethink that.  The brioche pudding was pretty good; it would have been uninspiring on its own, but the five spice ice cream was nicely nuanced.  We both had a drink with our meals, her a basil vodka gimlet thing and me a glass of wine the server recommended.  Those were both pretty good.Overall, it was pretty okay--the decor and service balance out the food to give this place 3 stars.",0,0,0,Carol H.,"New York, NY",9,144,5

4.0,5/19/2009,"Came here on advice from other Yelpers for my birthday. Brought my discerning parents and family friend. Everyone left raving. Shared a mushroom appetizer (one of the specials) as well as the Rucola w/ beet salad. Off to a great start. I then had a pasta with seafood entree. It was delicious. My parents each had the rack of lamb and they definitely made the ""clean plate club"". Drinks are delish too. I had a basil gimlet. Could have had that for the rest of the night and been quite satisfied. Bottom line: I'll be back. (How many more times can I say delicious?!!)",0,0,0,Julie W.,"New York, NY",83,72,0
3.0,5/9/2009,"3.5 stars. I found this restaurant through the YELP channel and decided to try it out, since the reviews satisfied what I was looking for - trendy, yet casual atmosphere, serving quality italian food that isn't too pricey.  It is easy to mistake Bocca for a lounge since the Iranian-ish decor reminds me of a classy hookah bar. I've been here several times on a Friday night and it has never been crowded. I've recently been hooked on Sangria as my stable dinner drink, and I thought that the Sangria Bianca served at Bocca was rather unique- the rim of my glass was lined with sugar,pepper and salt---talk about spicing up a drink. I only wish they had added more fruit. The portions at Bocca are well-sized. The baked eggplant appetizer that my friend and I ordered to share, could have been 2/3's of a meal on its own. For our entrees, I tried the oxtail ragout, whereas my friend, who was vegetarian settled for their simplest pasta dish- angel hair in a creamy sauce with pepper/parmesan. All the dishes were traditionally prepared, and although I usually prefer ""new italian"" cuisine, I really enjoyed my meal on the whole. One highlight was the nutella tart with berry compote, which we shared for dessert. Bocca has a unique dessert selection- my sister, who is a dessert fanatic, loves their semi-freddo amaretto biscotti parfait. Expect the bill to amount to about $55 a person for a 3 course meal, with wine. I would return to Bocca because not only is it conveniently located in the Flatiron area, but it is also a great place to go when you're in the mood for good italian food, wine or cocktails...but you just don't feel like getting dressed up and fancy to get it.",0,0,0,Annabel A.,"New York, NY",47,161,0
3.0,4/25/2009,"Visited Bocca for a late dinner after a long commute back into the city from Newark. It was just the thing.The attention paid to the decor of the dining room with the bar as a center point was done beautifully. Anybody could look good in that light. Silk cushions lining a bench that ran the length of the main dining area with chairs on the other side of each table. Good jazz in the background (not just the standards) - bring a date here or your group of girls. Our server had a lot of personality (in a good way) and we instantly felt taken care of, right down to him choosing my date's entree for the night with a reassuring ""I'll choose for you"" - and he was not disappointed. We both had pasta and though we were the last table seated we didn't feel rushed. The food was good but not the best I've had. The ingredients were fresh but preparation seemed a little sloppy. I'd go back but at an earlier hour for the full experience.",0,0,0,Amber M.,"New York, NY",46,164,4
4.0,2/9/2009,"Somewhere early on in the dinner, the meal at Bocca turned into a competition. It was dish versus dish and while most contests have a clear subject in the lead, the three rounds at Bocca were very close. In fact, one would have to ask the tastebuds of the three consumers to really find out which dish won in the end. The competition turned into a bloodbath as each dish was deconstructed and not one bit was left behind. Before I give the highlights of each course, I'll let the Bocca intro play.Who knew that in the heart of Gramercy, a little sweet spot called Bocca existed? We had stumbled upon it by chance and if it were not for the Restaurant Week special sign outside, we may not have been drawn in. Everyone asks, ""Which restaurant has the best deal during RR?"" Bocca, my friend, is a pretty darn good deal.Virtually empty, Bocca was big but felt like a dive. It was dark and the hostess sat us in a corner table. Cushy pillows lined our booth and if that overtly feminine touch was Bocca's only fault, then that was the only thing that held Bocca back from being a five star experience. I felt a little like Anthony Bourdain on No Reservations. We wouldn't be feasting on anything you would need a stomach made of steel for but we were about to dine like the chefs do, gobbling up sea fare for kings, sipping soft wine from abroad, and ending with not one or two but three desserts that not only cleansed the palate but triggered happy endorphins. Is that even possible? Yes, my friend, it is.Our hostess and sommelier were foreign, very friendly and helpful. As they explained the meal choices, daily specials, and wine varieties, it was easy to agree to everything. Talk to us ms. hostess lady and mr. sommelier. The descriptions of ingredients and taste were like music to our ears with your slight accents. And since we weren't too sure which wine would pair well with our meal, we were given two wine tastings. The second choice was an amazing berry red from Sicily. The three course Restaurant Week special worked out well for us. We chose our appetizers and entrees and one each of the desserts. Round One:Polipo- Grilled Portuguese wild octopus served over warm crispy cannellini beans.    Fennel Salad- Fennel with a citrus vinaigretteRucola- Rocket with roasted golden and red beetsThe wild octopus won hands down. It was meaty and tender. The cannellini beans were creamy and almost tasted like they were breaded. If the octopus had full use of it's tentacles, it would have knocked the fennel and rocket back into the ground.Round Two:Tonnarelli Cacio y Pepe: Box like spaghetti with Pecorino cheese and coarse black pepperBraised Ox Tail: Served with bufalo mozzarella cheese, polenta and fried celeryTrota: Oven roasted filet of trout with sliced potatoesThe meat eaters united and immediately played bully to the Tonarelli and Trota. The ox tail was soft and boneless with a thick gravy and piled on high with what seemed like fried bits of celery and onion. Where it's sidekick of polenta failed, Trota's faithful starch was immersed in olive oil. And you know how we all melt for EVOO. And while we thought Ox and Trota had it hands down in the feast category, Tonarelli stole the show with it's flashy presentation. The waiter came out with a cheese wheel bigger than the table. The pasta came from within and the wheel was even sacrificed as slivers of percorino cheese were incorporated into the pasta mixture. Instant replays will have to be studied to find out who the real winner was here.Final Round: Tart- Nutella drizzles with a roasted bosch pear Semifreddo- Amaretto biscuit freezeCreme Brulee- Bananas!The tart really knew how to reel us in. No one could resist the delicate crunch of the tart while it was laced with nutella. The bosch pear hinted of a little glamour yet was very unassuming. The semifreddo played it cool and was the gentleman at the bar who bought you a drink. And while all of this was going on, creme brulee was going crazy in the background but when indulged, we found out that it was less insane than we thought, only offering a hint of bananas. The verdict is up in arms as each dish really sparkled in its own way. I'm surprised and feel kind of bad that Bocca hasn't really been in the limelight based on the past Yelp reviews. My first encounter with Bocca was a very interesting game night and I would gladly play again.",7,6,6,Rachel A.,"Brooklyn, NY",732,1493,1730

4.0,11/9/2008,"I didn't come here to eat dinner, but after my experience here on a sunny afternoon I would love to come back. We were searching for a place for a little afternoon cocktail and something to munch on. We stumbled upon Bocca, which at the time had a couple cute tables outside - one with our name on it. We ordered a couple glasses of wine and asked if we could take a gander at the food menu. The waiter (which it seemed was also the manager or owner) told us that the kitchen was unfortunately closed. After he saw my sullen expression he said, ""Well, I think I can get you some bar bites."" We immediately accepted, no matter what the charge. When he brought them out, I have to admit I was a little bummed because they included crostini with olive paste and deep fried olives and mozzarella. Ask me what food I hate the most? You guessed it - OLIVES! But, beggers can't be choosers, right? My drinking companion ate all the olive items and I threw down the fried mozzarella.
