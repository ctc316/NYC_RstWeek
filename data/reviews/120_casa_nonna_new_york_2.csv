4.0,4/28/2019,"More like 3 stars but since the service was so great we'll do 4.Not sure why we ended up here but we did. Definitely was nervous how food would be since it's in a touristy area. I ordered the gnocchi based off reviews here but PLEASE do not order the gnocchi. Very plain, tastes like raw dough. Everyone else loved their meals. The bread is amazingggggg, the veal ravioli with pesto dish was great too. Spaghetti was good as well, simple with some tomatoes in it. Reason it's more of a 3 Star is just due to price. There is a lot more options in New York City for pasta that is as good or better, for a way cheaper price. Very big restaurant so if you have a large group this could be a place. If you're in the area and don't feel like traveling for somewhere else, it is good food.",0,0,0,Stephanie S.,"Troy, MI",334,18,0

5.0,4/19/2019,"Oh my, Casa Nonna, is the Italian restaurant of my dreams.  My friends and I went to Casa Nonna for dinner before catching a show.  I'm so happy we went here, I left feeling full and satisfied, and ready to sit for a 3 hour play.Upon arrival, it wasn't too crowded.  The restaurant is quite expansive for NYC.  I started with a glass of Chianti.  My friends and I ordered the amazing bruschetta and crispy Brussels Sprouts.  It was a perfect start to the meal.  The Bruschetta was a-plenty and the mustard-apple cider vinaigrette on the Brussels Sprouts was to die for.  So good!  For dinner I ordered the truffle ricotta gnocchi with wild mushrooms and Fava Beans and it was like I was eating candy.  It was so buttery and delicious.  I had no other choice but to eat the whole thing!  And to my surprise, I still had room to share the tiramisu.  My friends also raved about their meals.  Is there anything Casa Nonna can't do?Our waiter was very friendly.  He checked up on us a few times and made sure we were well taken care of.  Thanks for an excellent dinner Casa Nonna!",7,4,5,Jessi S.,"Carlstadt, NJ",289,143,120

3.0,3/19/2019,"""Nonna, I'm still hungry""Still being hungry after going to Nonna's house is unheard of.I would leave my Nonnie's house in pain from eating so much.If you finished your plate, Nonnie would fill it back up saying, ""have more"".Not the case at Casa Nonna. The food was good. The service was excellent. But the portions were small. If I had ordered only my entree, I would  have left starving. I began with a butternut squash soup which was creamy and tasty. I also ordered a side of broccoli rabe because I was curious how it would taste. It wasn't bad, but it was bland. I usually saute it with garlic and olive oil and then let it simmer in chicken stock to develop more flavor. Then I had the Siamese Agnolotti pasta. Veal ragu, spinach & taleggio, truffled pecorino fonduta marsala glaze. I wasn't 100% sure what this pasta dish would be but the veal ragu sounded good. It turned out to be similar to small ravioli. Eight small ravioli stuffed half way with the veal ragu. The other half with the spinach taleggio. Topped with a light cream sauce and mushrooms. I ate it in about five minutes and I was taking my time. I should have tried a basic sauce with some pasta because my dish was bland. My wife had the Polpette Panini. A meatball sandwich with sauce, provolone and mozzerella. The sandwich was a lot better than my dinner. I wish I kept it simple and also ordered the meatball panini. My sister-in-law had the margarita pizza. Her pizza was pretty tasty. I felt the restaurant was over priced. Granted, I know it's in NYC. But come on!$17 for a meatball sandwich. $10 for a small side of broccoli rabe. $15 for a margarita pizza. And $26 for my small pasta dish. My dish was so small, I thought they made a mistake when the waiter brought the dish to me. I will not be recommending this restaurant to friends or family that travel to NYC.",3,0,1,Steve T.,"Waterbury, CT",113,128,228
4.0,3/18/2019,"Years ago, I had taken my brother to Casa Nonna for a special wine dinner hosted by Chef David Burke, their culinary consultant.  We had really enjoyed the experience, but I had completely forgotten about the destination, given that I am rarely hanging out in the neighborhood between Port Authority and Penn Station.  However, my friend recently asked me to find a dinner spot in that locale, and, after a quick search, I was reminded of this terrific option.  My friend was waiting for me at the packed bar, and when I arrived, she marveled at how spacious and vibrant the restaurant was.  She grabbed her glass of wine, and we followed the hostess to our table in the dining room.  I decided to skip a beverage that night, but we both munched on the complimentary flatbread, which was topped with a cheese and black pepper-crusted topping.  The zesty crisps were a necessary indulgence as we inhaled all of the seductive food smells swirling around us.  We decided to share a few plates, starting with the seasonal Pumpkin and Pear Salad.  Leaves of arugula and radicchio were topped with roasted pumpkin, caramelized pear, pumpkin seeds, and a pear-balsamic vinaigrette.  Thickly-cut slices of fresh ricotta salata were a welcome creamy addition to balance the acidity.  Next, we moved onto Whole Wheat Tagliatelle with squash, wild mushrooms, kale, and a truffle Parmesan sauce that was aromatic yet light.  The nutty noodles and vegetable accoutrements made it at least appear to have been a healthier selection.  Lastly, the Branzino was pan-seared for a crunchy skin covering moist meat.  It was elegantly lying over a bed of cannellini beans, escarole, sofrito, and a saffron aioli.  A smoked paprika oil was drizzled over the dish, bringing the Mediterranean flavors to the forefront.Casa Nonna provided a first-rate meal in an exciting atmosphere.  The fact that it was a culinary delight in the midst of an otherwise food wasteland was definitely an added bonus.",10,3,7,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

No matter how it was suoer delicious.

5.0,3/4/2019,"This is my favorite Italian restaurant in NYC! I have been coming here for years and always have had a great experience. We went there last night for dinner and it was just as amazing as always!First off, the bread is TO DIE FOR! It's very thin and crispy and has ricotta in the middle. I could honestly just eat this. We always ask for more!We then had the calamari, which is my favorite appetizer there! It is a mix of fried calamari and fried zucchini and has a delicious dipping sauce! Definitely a 5 star appetizer.My favorite pasta of all time is the butternut squash ravioli! They change their menu seasonally but I was very happy to see it was still on the menu last night. It's the perfect mix of sweet and salty!We were so full and didn't order dessert, but our waitress Maja was so amazing and brought us tiramisu on the house! It was truly the best tiramisu I have had in a long time! It was rich and full of flavor!

I asked for a glass of dessert wine at the bar and they happened to have just one. They accommodated us even though some members of our party were half an hour late and the service was friendly all around. As for the food, I liked my spaghetti and thought the pasta was a great texture. I wouldn't say it was super unique. It had quite a lot of sauce and was a bit too salty and saucy for my taste but the texture of the pasta was perfect.

5.0,2/15/2019,Authentic Itialian food and pasta.     I ordered a bolognese pasta and the wife had a chicken parm with zucchini shaped pasta side .   Both came out quickly and very tasty.   We were in a hurry so we didn't have an appetizer or salad but did enjoy a cappuccino and a chocolate cake with gelato.   All of the food n drinks were spot on. The real beauty of this restaurant is the size and decor.    The tables are spread out and the wife and I even had a corner cushy booth with a loose pillow.   Highly recommend for MSG events or romantic evenings in the west 38th street locations.    Free parking after 7:00 pm in front of the restaurant.   Couldn't have been more pleased.     The waiter was perfect.  Didn't talk too much and was on his game !,0,0,0,Joe W.,"Matawan, NJ",18,17,24

The decoration and atmosphere in this restaurant was very quaint. There were paintings and photos everywhere. There was also a section where you can witness chefs tossing pizza in the air and sliding them into brick ovens.

I ordered the Daviola Pizza (pepperoni) and the ingredients were incredibly fresh and delicious. The unusual part is that i was with a large group of friends and the waitress came over one time and asked if we were ready to order... we put in the appetizer order... and she never came back. Like ever. We did have a waiter who was filling drinks and super cool guy and really great (a number of us ordered alcoholic beverages)... but after 40 minutes of us talking and carrying on, i asked the male server if I missed the ordering round or something and he said 'no one has ordered anything' .. i assumed he meant they just weren't hungry or something, so i ordered a pizza. When i was eating my pizza, my friends asked me when i ordered... turns out they were still waiting for the server to take their order!! They were starving!!

3.0,11/15/2018,"Met an old friend who was staying around the corner and is a simple eater. Upscale Italian seemed perfect. The restaurant is beautiful and the FOH staff were polite. Service was slow and odd. Beautiful looking pizzas were coming out of the kitchen. But wasn't on the menu. I asked the server, who replied, oh I'll bring the pizza menu (we had the special, dinner and cocktail menus upon seating). My guest ordered a repeat of her first beer, was brought a different one, when we asked to switch it, the waiter said, no, i think this was it, are you sure? Yes, She was aware of the beverage she was drinking. Drinks came out after starters, and water glasses sat empty. Our servers switched at dessert and pick up server was sweet. The Caesar was perfunctory. My much anticipated asparagus, poached egg with truffles starter  (from the truffle prix fixe menu - a nice touch that the items were also a la carte) was...ok. The egg was not warm, nor was the accompanying sauce - my preference with any runny egg is warm.  The asparagus had great snap. The duck pappardelle was greasy and already cool on the outside -  though the pasta itself was lovely. My guest seemed to enjoy her pomodoro. The chocolate torte was a brick of cloying sweetness.  She got through 2 bites. I should have ordered differently. The Brussels sprouts or spinach sides sounded lovely and pizzas did look beautiful.I didn't say anything to the mgt as I was with an old friend and didn't want to cloud our time together.

Ideal location for meeting someone traveling to or from outside the city! The interior decor and atmosphere make you feel like your in a villa is Italy. The smell of fresh homemade pizza when you walk in takes your breath away. Grab a seat at the bar if your waiting for the rest of your party or get seated right away and order a glass of wine! Take your time as you look over the extensive menu before making your choice. We shared two pizzas for two people and that was just right. We had the Margherita and the Parma and both were made to perfection. The staff was very friendly treating everyone like a local who comes here often, even if it was your first time.

It was cool that they offered desserts for an additional $5 as part of their restaurant week menu. The pea soup was good but personally I prefer my soup hot and so the chilled soup didnt work well with me. If you like chilled soup then you'll like this one. The grilled salmon was amazing. It was cooked perfectly and was extremely flavorful. My friend had the chicken and I could tell it was cooked perfect. The tiramisu was okay not the best I had though.

4.0,8/4/2018,Great place to go for some really good Italian food. We went there for restaurant week during lunch and they had some really good options. Most of our table ordered the salmon which was a good portion size. The salmon was really tasty but the quinoa salad that came with it was a little bland. The watermelon salad though was super yummy (red and yellow watermelon with procuitto). The service was pretty slow which was the only big complain.

Actually, they didn't even know what medium looked like, had to go back and ask someone else. After realizing they messed up, they made no offer to fix the dish, they just stood there looking sad until I said it was okay.The food is nothing special, the sirloin was dry and tasteless and the mango puree reminded me of a McDonald's slushy, overtly tangy and sweet.

BIG MISTAKE!  The restaurant's beverage manager was extremely rude to us all, spoke to us in an unprofessional manner when we were trying to explain the information that his staff not only gave us over the phone, but also when we were seated at our table, and simply made everyone feel so uncomfortable that we decided to leave.  To make matters worse, when I ask about his role at the restaurant he first portrayed himself as THE manager only to find out after he was the beverage manager.  This is when I decided on our way out that it was important to tell the general manager what had just transpired.  She was apologetic but at not point was she resolving the problem, nor taking any responsibility for the beverage manager's behavior.  The good news... there is an amazing restaurant around the corner called Tavola that we went to instead that had fantastic food, the service was outstanding, atmosphere bright and lively and even with a packed house they squeezed us in.  Some things i guess are meant to be!",2,0,0,Amy B.,"Norwalk, CT",0,1,0

I give him my order and I ask for a camomile tea which I never got. I place my order, pomoduro pasta and meat ball. The waiter drops Calamari which I am highly allergic to and meat ball. By the way bartender repeated my order 3 times since he asked me the same question 3 times. By now he should have memorized my order. When I said no that is not what I order, the bartender when directly to the manager, not once apologizing for his mistake. Instead he decided to place the blame on me. The manager came to me apologized, but instead she decided to treat me like I was not sure of what I ordered. The manager asked me the same question 3 times and 3 times o told her that I ordered the meatball and pomodoro pasta. I emphasize that I am highlighting allergic to calamari and it is a life and death allergy. While I was being asked the same question 3 times I mentioned that why would a person that is highly allergic to calamari, order calamari and she said that the bartender misunderstood. The word calamari and pomodoro are different and there is no way it can be confused. Meanwhile bartender The manager said fine with an attitude agains making it look like it was my fault.

It had a good balance of peaches and champagne. For my main course I had the chicken parm with zucchini pasta and man oh man I totally enjoyed that. Chicken was good perfect, sauce was flavorful and my zucchini pasta was cooked just right and a very light butter sauce. For dessert, we had the chocolate cake which was rich, but not too rich were you wanting glass of milk along with ice cream on the side. It balanced the chocolate cake just right. Supper yummy!

3.0,9/20/2017,"Pleasantly surprised by some of the dishes at Casa Nonna. We went at an off hour so we had to sit in the bar area at a high top.  We were greeted relatively quickly, however most of the tables around us were dirty, which was odd seeming as how there were no patrons. At any rate, we had the roasted peach salad to start and they serve it with a warm, spicy flatbread. Those were quite good as was the salad. For entrees we shared the cheese-filled beet tortellini in a hazelnut brown butter sauce and the farfalle pasta prepared with spring veggies in a cream sauce. Additionally, we shared a side of eggplant parm.  Out of all the dishes, the ricotta and beet tortellini was by far the tastiest. The farfalle was a little to rich and oily for my liking. The eggplant parm was also a little too oily. As far as taste goes, it was alright, but the greasiness aspect of the dish coupled with the cheese layers in proportion to actual eggplant was a little overwhelming.  I did enjoy it overall thou and would give it another go with some of the other offerings. However, I would not recommend going in between lunch and dinner because we had no service, the bartender changed over without letting us know, and the new one never came to check on us.",0,0,0,Carmella C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,34,51

5.0,8/18/2017,"I was absolutely blown away by the dinner I had here recently. It's a simple menu, and judging by the reaction of everyone at my party you can't go wrong with anything you order. First off: the bread they bring for the table is amazing. I don't want to spoil it for you, but it involves cheese. I always feel guilty eating octopus because they're so smart and cool, but my guilt was quickly forgotten when I had the Polipo-just a phenomenal medley of flavors. Next you're going to want to snag the gnocchi. It's like eating tiny pillows of deliciousness. Somehow they melt in your mouth. I don't know how it's possible. The Frutti Di Mare is not only fun to say while gesticulating, but it's also incredibly delicious.  If you skip dessert here you should be ashamed of yourself. Come on! You just had a great meal and you think they're not gonna knock your socks off with dessert??! Well hold on to your socks because dessert is the real deal. Get the Torta Di Cioccolato. Just do it.

3.0,7/16/2017,"Casa Nonna is a dark, handsome space with big round tables that work well for big groups.  The decor is reminiscent of Carmine's.  The waitstaff were very nice and the service was good.   We were comped some delicious, freshly baked foccacia to start.  The red wine was warm, one of my pet peeves.  We started with two good pizzas, the Bosca and the Emilia.  The pizzas are small, but make great appetizers.  They usually come cut into four slices.  Cutting them into eight slices works well.  The entrees were lackluster.  My wife had the branzino, which she didn't love.  I had pici with ragu. It was very run of the mill.  It was a friend's birthday.  We brought a cake.  The restaurant charged $5 per person to plate and serve the cake.  They served it with a scoop of ice cream.  Fair enough. The waitress brought out a plate of mini blondies to end the meal.The one bad thing about the evening was that the restaurant was uncomfortably hot.  We went with friends who had been here multiple times and raved about it.   We didn't want to offend our friends and waited for them to bring the issue up.  This didn't happen until late in the meal.  When we asked the waitress about it, she said that part of it was the pizza oven and part of it was the air conditioning.  She said that she would appreciate it if we mentioned it to the manager.  This indicates that it's an ongoing issue.  So while this restaurant is OK overall, I wouldn't recommend it for anything other than a winter meal.  Too bad...",0,0,1,Joel S.,"New York, NY",37,675,16

4.0,6/19/2017,"Perhaps it is the location at the base of a large luxury apartment building or the over-sized tables, ideal for business dining, but it is difficult to ignore the somewhat ""corporate"" vibe here, owned by large hospitality chain E Squared (in the press recently for a spat with founder of By Chloe).  However, a lovely space with many tables and seemingly not so crowded does allow for a peaceful evening. The staff is extraordinarily friendly and as attentive as possible, and while the food did take a bit of time, it is nice to be able to enjoy a slower-paced meal.  They have a very extensive wine and cocktail list, including the one that struck me, the Man with a Yellow Tie, a wonderful cognac-rye based drink that I could drink all night long. We started with salads, which were perfectly summer-y but nothing to write home about, and calamari, which was served with a to-die-for lemon aioli. For entrees, we went with the sea scallops, which were also top notch and the Siamese Agnolotti, small dual ravioli, which were tasty, but as often can happen with smaller sized ravioli, didn't allow the taste of the stuffing to overcome the pasta itself. We couldn't resist the dessert menu either, which featured one of the finest ricotta cheesecakes I've ever had. Overall, the portions were a bit small for the price, not particularly surprising for a restaurant of this caliber (quality over quantity) and the corporate feel is a bit hard to break through, but the food speaks for itself and does quite well.",0,0,0,Howie T.,"New York, NY",1,25,4

It was dimly lit but not too dark and would be a great spot for either a date spot or business meetings. After being seated, we had to wait quite a while before the waiter showed up to our table to even take our orders. I understand it was a busy night, but I was pretty frustrated with how long it took for them to come around. We ordered calamari fritti for appetizer to share, pici alla toscana for me and my friend got barbabietole e tortellini ricotta. Calamari fritti: honestly the best dish out of the three we ordered. Not only were the serving size pretty decent, but it also had other food fried alongside with the calamari (like squash and green/red peppers) which I quite enjoyed. The sauce that came with it was also pretty good. Pici alla Toscana: I was pretty disappointed with my pasta. The dish was bland and nothing was really unique about the dish. Barbabietole e Tortellini Ricotta: my friend got this dish because the waiter recommended it and it turned out pretty good. The tortellini had hazelnuts in them which added a unique flavor and the spread of fresh arugula definitely went together very well.

I opted for a Caesar salad and the meatball appetizer. My husband had an antipasti of salami, crusty bread and olives. We were treated to a wooden bread board of bruschetta triangles dusted with olive oil, salt, pepper and rosemary. Delicious. Then came the Caesar salads. They smelled slightly fishy and the light dressing was creamy, yet tasteless. I was disappointed, as was my son.  The antipasti was good, according to my husband. The spaghetti was lightly covered with an orange sauce and the accompanying meatballs seemed to have a deeper and sweeter red sauce. My order meatballs were good sized, dripping in the same sweet red sauce. Can't say they were the best we have ever had. No dessert.

2.0,2/5/2017,"Went here for restaurant week with a friend.Overall, not worth the trip. Not sure if it was the food we ordered or what but the food did not taste good, it was average.The setting is dark, or ""dimly lit."" I'm not sure if that was dust particles or a tiny flying thing that flew around us and our food. The service was good, they replaced our utensils with nice shiny brand name ones after each plate.We had a cocktail to share, which the waiter kindly put into two glasses for us. Bless him.I had the salad, while my friend had the soup. The salad was the best thing in the restaurant, it had a nice balance of acidity and had mushrooms. The soup was a bit too salty.For the entree I had the spaghetti while my friend had the skirt steak. Avoid the spaghetti, it's the most mediocre pasta I have ever had. Just noodles drowned in tomato sauce, nothing special. My friend liked the skirt steak, but since my body can't willingly handle garlic, I couldn't indulge in her meal as well. So you only have her ""mmh mm"" to go for how that tasted.For dessert we had tiramisu and apple cake. Avoid the apple cake, it as well is nothing special. Just a kinda dryish cake with some sweetened cooked apples. The tiramisu was better on comparison, sweet coffee flavor to wipe away the mediocrity and wake me up to get the hell out.TLDR: not worth a long trip out here, not worth the high prices they charge for the regular stuff if what you have to go by is their restaurant week quality. Nice staff though. Try for yourself but come with low expectations and you might end up satisfied.",0,0,0,Kels W.,"FLUSHING, NY",0,17,0

As for pasta, we had the tagliolini with mussels and clams and it was delicious. The grilled octupus had more garment than a usual polipo dish but somehow these additional ingredients overwhelmed the original flavor of the octupus and served as a minus instead.

4.0,1/2/2017,"The food here was amazing. Every dish we had had truffles in it and I can't complain about that! What stood out to our table was the wine service. We ordered 3 bottles of wine and asked our server to decant one. The somm came over and told me that this wine shouldn't be decanted because ""this wine traps more of the flavors by being inside the bottle."" Excuse me? If a customer asks you to do something just do it and not make up reasons for your laziness. If you have a suggestion about wine, I'm all ears but I am a certified somm and I can guarantee that decanting will never hinder the flavor of wine. (the Italian wine was over 10 years old, it needed to be decanted.) The snarky/ pretentious attitude from him was a major turn off.  Also the servers kept taking glasses away when there was still wine left and not evenly topping everyone at the tables wine and leaving people out. Other than the wine service, I would absolutely go back. My mother has been several times and I will probably go back again.",2,0,1,Vanessa R.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,57,32

I was not disappointed!They started us off with complimentary watermelon shaved ice which was a nice touch. After that, we ordered the meatball as an app. To be honest, the bread they brought out with the meatball was probably the best I ever had. Normally I don't indulge in a second piece if I can help myself but it was amazing. The meatball was really good too! For dinner my date had the largest/most expensive steak which he said was amazing (I'm pretty sure he asked for it to go when I barely even saw anything left on his plate, he just couldn't let it go) and I got the chicken parm. I asked to substitute the healthy side of zucchini pasta for normal pasta and marinara sauce since it was my actual birthday and was coming to Casa Nonna to eat carbs (let's be honest).  The side of pasta had great flavor but even though the chicken was slathered in cheese and sauce it tasted rather bland. I'm not gonna hold it against them since everything else was so good, but I wouldn't order that again. I would try something else.Overall, it had great ambiance, and the service was amazing!

I had the sea bass for $32 and the Brussels sprouts for $10. With the sparkling water, the bill came to $54.17 - a bit stiff for a $$ restaurant. The sprouts were really good - a solid 4 star. I was really disappointed in the sea bass. Is was one small filet with skin on and a bunch of beans. For that price, I would have expected more, and the presentation left a lot to be desired.

Our party was set up in a private room, where we were still able to get the alluring vibe of the restaurant, without overwhelming other guests. Due to our large party we had a fixed menu. The waiters were very efficient the entire time, constantly checking in with us. We were offered a selection of two different wines, a fixed appetizer, three choices of entree, and two options for dessert. All of the food was high quality, classic Italian cooking. As a picky eater, I was highly impressed. I definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a classy night out to dress up and splurge a little.",0,0,0,Sandy S.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,32,7

The dough was just perfect, tomatoes sauce delicious, and the toppings (mozzarella, prosciutto and arugula) were really high quality.. Taste like home. Thank you for making my evening.

3.0,6/8/2016,"Went here for a weekday lunch with my sister. The interior of Casa Nonna is really beautiful and the food was delicious - loved that eggplant bruschetta!However, I felt disappointed by how long we had to wait for our pizza, and despite what they said, I think they forgot to put our order in.  We were seated right away and they came back with our drinks and appetizers immediately, but it took a really long time for us to get our main entrees of pizza.  We had been long done with the bruschetta before my sister asked if our pizzas (one personal-sized one each) were coming out.  They reassured us it was but it took about another 15 minutes, and told us if we were in a rush to say everything should be brought out at once.  Normally we would, but with the back half of the restaurant (bar in front) being so empty, we didn't think we'd be waiting that long...I mean, it's pizza, right?  And not even a big one!  There was a large (5+) party seated and served around the same time as us, and they got their entrees a lot earlier than us, which is what prompted my sister to inquire about our food.  I kind of got that awkward over-explaining vibe when we asked if they forgot and they insisted they hadn't and that they time serving their food out based on when we've finished our appetizers. Additionally, I wish they did not seat another two person party directly next to us when there were several other small tables available.  They seated them about 30-35 minutes after we were seated.  Maybe this was done because it was convenient for serving purposes, but it was uncomfortable because we could hear their private conversation and they could hear ours.My family is always looking for a nice place to eat before or after a Broadway show, and I know another family member enjoyed her dining experience, so I'd be willing to give it another try since the food was delicious.",0,0,0,Faye D.,"New York, NY",10,63,391

It was pretty good and so was the  rosemary flat bread. My husband ordered the twisted pasta with bolognese sauce, now mind you he is Italian and likes his pasta al dente, the pasta was very under cooked and the dish was barely warm.  I ordered the meatballs with ricotta and that dish was also cold.  The broccoli rabe was horrible!

4.0,5/1/2016,"Solid 4.5!TL; DR: Perfect for if you want to feel fancy, but  still appropriate for if you are eating with a non adventurous eater.  Would eat here again!Alright, here we go!  J and I ate here at 5pm on a Thursday- so early because we had Cirque du Soleil to see at 7:30 and wanted to give ourselves time.  We did have reservations; a father and son walked in ahead of us right at 5 and did NOT have reservations and were told they had to sit at the bar because everything else was booked.  So, make reservations if you want a table!We were seated immediately in a corner booth, perfect.  Ambience is dark and nice, but you could get away with wearing whatever you want. We were in what we call our ""dressy jeans"" and nobody cared. Our waiter was Leo and he was a complete doll.  When he took our drink order, he first recommended the wine list or something from the bar and we indicated we don't drink, so when I ordered a super boring unsweet tea, he must have sensed that I didn't REALLY want an unsweet tea and he recommended a non alcoholic passionfruit mohito that they make.  He described it so deliciously I just had to get it. And it was every bit as refreshing as he described.  To start we got the fried calamari and the meatballs.  The fried calamari came with fried red sweet pepper, yellow squash and zucchini mixed in.  It was yummy. The calamari were not chewy, the breading held on, and they weren't overly greasy. They just needed a touch of salt.  The meatballs (you get two, maybe 2 inch meatballs) were very soft (I liked the texture, my husband did not) with a small square of parm and a dollop of cold ricotta.  They were delicious. Okay, my only issue with these two things- they were lukewarm.  Not hot.  I like hot food.  This didn't bother my husband in the slightest and may not bother anyone else. I just thought it was worth mentioning. For our entrees, I ordered the porcini mezzaluna and J got spaghetti pomodoro (told you, non adventurous eater).  His spaghetti appeared to be hand made (somewhere at least) and was perfectly al dente.  A bit pricey at $20 for plain spaghetti but, whatever. My mezzaluna was mushroom heaven.  The sauce was creamy and buttery, it came with two large slices of mushroom, and the filling was very very mushroomy.  But again, lukewarm.  Boooo.  When we ordered, Leo was again on the money with recommending a side dish- he recommended the Brussel sprouts and they were the star of the show (for me anyway, J hates tiny cabbages).  They were roasted perfectly with apples, vinegar and pancetta and were divine.  Good call, Leo!For dessert I forced down the pear tart (forced because I was stuffed, not because it was bad).  The buttermilk gelato was awesome.  For the two of us, it was around $100 before tip, so, totally affordable.  I would definitely return.  The service was impeccable-  someone was always on top of refilling water, clearing dishes, Leo was just fantastic in general, and it was an enjoyable experience.

Fourtunalty I was not that rich to order too much food, and what I did have was nearly uneatable.

Cook forgot to cut the slices and was returned with even more grease on return. I think I eat two slices, but did request to take the rest home with me so I could analylise what a terrible recipe they had worked from or was it just bad cooking from someone who did not care.

2.0,1/30/2016,"**THIS REVIEW IS FOR RESTAURANT WEEK FEB '16 ONLY**Hmm. I'm struggling to figure out if my party just came on an ""off"" day, or if Casa Nonna is simply unable to deliver good service during restaurant week. First off, we made a reservation for 8:30pm and arrived promptly. We were told that the party before us were paying, so it would just be a couple moments before we could be seated. Totally fine, except the fact that this went from a 5 minute wait into a 30 minute wait. The place is quite spacious - I don't understand why they could not accommodate my party of 7 at any of the other tables available, especially since they were expecting us. Additionally, we were promised a ""nice, gorgeous long table"" which is why we had to wait specifically for that, I guess... But then another host approached us shortly after, asking us to check our coats since they planned to sit us at a smaller table. No way - not after you made us wait 30 minutes! Why are two people telling us different things, and what makes them think that 7 people can sit at a regular table for 4?! Give us the table that we reserved for!When we were finally able to be seated, the ""gorgeous long table"" as promised turned out to be just a regular table and mediocre space... Honestly could care less about this, but it definitely was annoying. The restaurant week menu was $38 for an appetizer, entree and dessert - very average options to choose from. The portions were small and I had to ask for bread 3 times to make up for this. Service was extremely slow and inattentive; the third time I asked for bread, it never even came. On top of all that, the food was just OK. Not terrible but not worthy of a 4 star rating. Very normal and average flavors.

We had 23 people in our company and the room is perfect for us, but I would say the best size of group for that room will probably be 20 people if everyone wants to sit really comfortably,  What I like is their private dining room is having TV, so you can bring the video you'd like to play.  My boss made a video about everyone in our office and we had so much fun watching it. The catering menu we had that night was really nice. Everyone got salad  ( d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s! )and they have bread on the table for everyone to share. ( OMG, the breads are seriously amazing!! ) We also got to pick 1 pasta and 1 main course and 1 deserts. For pasta, I picked Twisted Pasta Strands in Tuscan Beef-Pork Ragu, the pasta was a bit undercooked but the sauce was delicious. For main course, I had filet mignon and it was cooked perfectly.

5.0,1/11/2016,Randomly wandered in here for lunch one day and highly recommend to anyone looking for something slightly more upscale than the other cafeteria-style lunch spots in the area. The Caesar salad was delicious and for a midtown restaurant the place was pretty quiet which made this place great for a quick business lunch without straying too far from my office.

Four of the people were coming in from the LIRR, which is why I picked this restaurant. At 3:30pm on the day of my 6pm reservation, I received a call explaining that the restaurant was closed for a private party. They did offer to move us to another of their restaurants, but the reviews were not as good and the cuisine was different. (We picked Italian because we had 2 kids attending.) I've used Open Table for over a decade and I have never had that happen. We had to scramble to get another restaurant to accommodate us with 3 hours notice during the busy tourist season.

1.0,12/16/2015,"The food was fine. Nevertheless, the management is likely at the top of the worst in NYC. A polite request was made by a pregnant woman to sit her in a specific location given her special motherly situation. In short, the manager on duty and the regional manager, as they represented themselves to be, recklessly disregarded the pregnant woman's request.Of most shocking disappointment was senior management's offensive demeanor in seeking to desperately justify their unaccommodating, aggressive ultimatum type behavior. To say the least, the experience was only short of barbaric. The only ultimate recommendation I can make to the owners/ senior management of this establishment, is to have a heart felt candid communication with everyone in your staff at all levels, to emphasize any and above all that the customer is always right. The managements' arrogant demeanor, which failed to acknowledge any and all basic fundamentals, is not only offensive but a blatant avenue to guaranteed failure.",1,0,1,Elena S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0

4.0,12/2/2015,"I dined here for an educational dinner - normally I get the restaurant week treatment during these things but Nonna puts out solid food which definitely deserves praise. The restaurant is quite large and bustling; there's low lighting and a darker color scheme (mostly browns) which gives off a warm, intimate feel. Not exactly ""grandma's house"" (the English translation of the restaurant name) but it works. We had a limited menu to choose from, and most things were served family style with the exception of the entree. They started us with apps consisting of their ""famous meatballs"", octopus paired with roasted pepper and olives, and fresh mozzarella paired with sweet peppers. Everything was super tasty, but the standout for me was the meatballs - they were quite good, definitely the real deal. The pasta course was cheese tortellini paired with basil and cherry tomatoes. The tortellini were large and filled with a perfect amount of cheese. For the main I had the swordfish which was paired with tomatoes, olives, and capers. The fish was good and paired well with the side. Additionally there were family style sides of spinach and roasted potato spears. Finally for dessert they served chocolate pudding cake with vanilla gelato and passion fruit panna cotta.Everything was great - quality food and good service as well.

1.0,11/27/2015,"This is my first ever Yelp review. So many things went wrong...1) I ordered a simple vodka martini, no vermouth, little bit of olive juice (not quite dirty). First one more than 15 minutes after ordering) came out with a little bit of orange juice? Waited another 15 minutes and finally got my first drink. 2) Ordered a steak, RARE. Came out medium. Didn't have the time to send it back even though they noticed themselves that it wasn't rate, offering to make another without having to even complain. This restaurant is owned by Jimmy Haber of BLT, so they should be on their A-game with steaks. 3) Ordered a second martini right before my steak came out, this time it was just a club soda with ice. They realized they sent me the wrong drink, and the EXTREMELY RUDE GM LINDSAY came over. She said ""We got your drink mixed up (not an apology whatsoever, she was almost mad she had to come to our table). That's a Ketel One martini with no vermouth and a little bit of olive juice, correct?"" (Yes). ""Okay, because the sooner I leave this table the faster you can have your drink"". SO RUDE!! But it gets worse - She comes back with my drink (they are now 2 for 4) and says ""Here you go sir, shall I go ahead and put an order in for your next martini now?"" As if I'm a raging alcoholic - I just wanted two martinis as I was out to dinner with my mother and sister!4) It was a special occasion - my mother's 59th birthday. The manager, Nick (who unfortunately has to report to GM Lindsay), was extremely kind and apologetic - as a restaurant manager should be when his/her staff makes mistakes. He took the steak off our bill and generously delivered two delicious desserts to our table for my mom's birthday. The experience was terrible and I would hate to work for Lindsay. I think Nick should have her job, she is a terrible manager from a customer's perspective.

We made a rez at 645 pm and the restaurant was pretty full at this time.  We were served a little slow (service was all around a little spotty) but the food was yummy and the restaurant is spacious and has a nice, elegant atmosphere. We had:- Complimentary, yummy fresh baked flatbread with some kind salty cheese inside- A coppa plate which came with pickles, olives, and rustic bread. Plentiful and tasty- A hard sheep's milk cheese parm like bread which came with a sweet nut like honey and PR jam. The jams were a bit weird and too sweet but the cheese was lovely.-I had the Spinach/veal agnolotti which was truly very creamy, rich and tasty. It was very beefy- more beef than spinach. The pasta were all home made (every pasta dish is), and looked very unique and fun. -My friend had the duck breast. Unfortunately it was overdone the first time so they quickly took it back and re fired another...seems like the second time around, while cooked properly, it was less duck. Hm.  Kind of a dish you don't want to screw up for $37. -Lastly...I didn't try it but my friend swears by their tasty chicken parm so maybe give it a try if you want something heartier. We passed on dessert in lieu of wine. They DO have really delicious wine here - all Italian and the server knew his stuff.  He suggested a Sav Blanc like crisp choice for my friend (Venedictino? something liek that.  And a full fruity cab like option for the Angleinzo... blaah I can't spell or say Italian wines, ha).

Not only was my table treated very well, but every occupied table in the restaurant was taken care of in the best, most professional way possible. The food was probably the best Italian food I've ever had in my life, and I've had a lot of good Italian food. The pasta was most definitely hand-crafted on site (I can tell because I also make my own pasta from scratch at home), and each dish was carefully cooked to perfection. First, I had a small pasta dish in a delicious bolognese sauce, which was amazing. Then, I had the Polpettine, a meatball appetizer, and let me tell you, these were the best meatballs I ever had in my life. This was followed by a pizza shared by the whole table, which was also to die for. I'm a little unsure of the exact ingredients because it was custom made by the chef. Then, I had the Chicken Parmesan as my main dish, and that was also delicious. My only comment on that is the chicken is huge! I think it might be a little too much, but at this point in the meal I was already stuffed so I think that would best be served without all the appetizers I ate. The desserts were also fantastic.

1.0,8/26/2015,"I started going to Cassa Nonna the day it opened in 2011 and live in Emerald Green (the apartment building on top).  Full disclosure, I have been banned from going into this restaurant for the past 9 months.  I recently tried to go back in and was asked to leave.  No argument and left.  I will get back to the banning reason later.  Prior to my banning, I ate here on average once or twice a week and spent thousands of dollars, made friends with bartenders and always tipped 25 to 30%.  For a while they gave residents of the building 15% off on Sunday nights.  This made sense because the prices are high, but the quality is high.  Sometimes the portion sizes were not customer friendly (especially the Octopus).  They are part of eSquared with a rewards program that you basically get no benefit from except if the bartender feels like hooking you up, which did happen from time to time.  The reason for 1 star and my banning is because of the female floor manager (name I believe is Lindsay) who called me rude one night because I asked for the free drink that the rewards program gives you once in a while, but I didn't have my receipt.  I asked her to make an exception and she wouldn't.  I tried to ask her again and said I was not happy.  She said I was rude and always rude to everyone (staff) all the time and that I returned Octopus one night.  I was always nice and a regular, but expect proper food.  I was furious that she could say this to a customer and instead of making a scene in restaurant I called her from upstairs and I did yell at her.  Probably not the best reaction, but she was infuriating!  I went in the next day and she said that I had to leave and the police would be called if I didn't leave.  I left and wrote the President of eSquared.  They sided with her.  She should have never called me rude.  The point of my story is that this is an arrogant, overpriced, and corporate restaurant.  I have lived in this location for 6 years....just go to TAVOLA (on 9th avenue between 37th and 38th) right around the corner.  Better food, better service, more authentic Italian and much cheaper.  This is the unbiased truth!",0,0,0,Michael B.,"New York, NY",0,12,1

1.0,8/18/2015,"This was the only Italian restaurant I tried while in NYC and I was a little disappointed. I came in expecting free bread (maybe I'm used to ""fake"" Italian restaurants like Olive Garden since they give free salad and breadsticks with your meal). But that's not the reason why I gave 1 star.We started off with the Calamari Fritti appetizer. The calamari was not too bready and had a decent flavor. My only complaint was that for $13 there didn't seem to be enough calamari. The julienne vegetables made the dish seem bigger than it actually was and the dish looked underwhelming, to be honest.Our entrees took forever to come out. For my dish I ordered the Farfalle integrali. The pasta was undercooked - it was just so hard that I thought maybe it was because it was wheat pasta that made it so hard. But then I tried my sister's dish - Pici Alla Toscana (with non-wheat pasta) - and her pasta was hard as well. Both were so unenjoyable. As a girl with a sizable appetite, it was the first time I did not finish my entree and I normally LOVE pasta.

McDonald's is down the block. Now on to my review. I've been coming here for the past 3 years (dinner, lunch, restuarant week) and never once had they disappointed. The food is absolutly delicious. Italian food unlike any other (coming from someone who grew up with a real life Nonna!) Pastas, sauces, pizzas, cheeses, meatballs, gelato, desserts, etc. are all made in house. The service is very attentive without being intrusive. They are very accommodating and make sure you are having a wonderful time. The restaurant is very spacious but at the same time, surprisingly very intimate. Even with a crowded dining room, you could hear your guests and not others. It feels like you're dining at someone's home. This is truly a ""hidden gem"" as it is located in the middle of a block between Times Sq. and MSG.

Our party had 7:30 reservations and I was running late, about 20 minutes, but my party was seated at the bar, then at a table at the 15 minute late  mark. When I arrived, the host was very friendly and took me straight to our table. Our waiter came over immediately and asked if I wanted a drink, I waited and he asked if we wanted to order our appetizers, we said we'd review the choices and then order. Of course, the menu wasn't extensive, as it was just a few choices for restaurant week. So, we had the waiter come over and asked about the sweetbread app, he offered to describe every dish on the menu (this should happen at any restaurant). We said, we'd think about what we wanted and I ordered a Blood Orange margarita.  Our waiter brought over a plate of their EXCELLENT grilled foccacia. Mmmmm!I chose the Heirloom Tomato, my cousin and friend both had the Fluke Crudo.  We laughed at the small sizes of the apps and said, if this is the appetizer, we know the entree will be small too. The heirloom tomato was good, the buffalo mozzarella was stellar, I could have just eaten that and the foccacia. I tasted the fluke and it was tasty, I'm not a raw fish person, so I wouldn't personally order it. The glaze was excellent though.  On to the dishes... We each chose one of the three available entrees.  I had the Ricotta Cavatelli, my cousin the Lamb Tenderloin, and our friend, the Black Sea Bass.  While their portions were small, as expected, my pasta was a heartier dish than I thought. EVERYTHING was delicious! We asked for more grilled foccacia, we were accommodated. Our water glasses were refilled constantly and we were checked on periodically.  Dessert choices were Tiramisu and Passion fruit Cannoli. My friend didn't want either and he was able to substitute with a nice serving of gelato. All three desserts were great. Throughout dinner we laughed about possibly needing to go elsewhere after to have full bellies.  Rest assured, by the time we had our desserts - we were all full and satisfied. Everything came together completely. In total, we were there about 3 hours and never felt rushed to be done. Our bill was about $200 - $38 each for the restaurant week menu,plus drinks and tip. I really wish I would have remembered our waiter's name, he was very nice. The decor and ambiance is very nice and inviting. I would definitely go back again.

Had the tiramisu for dessert and it was average. Cannot remember what I had for appetizer (you get the idea...)Should be a 3.5 but what knocked this down to a 3 was this obnoxious duo next to us who were SCREAMING about how much money they are making and how many companies they have bought and sold.

Is there anything better than eating great Italian food in NYC? Is there any city in America better than NYC when it comes to great Italian food. Both rhetorical questions I know...The ambiance of this place is like updated, old-school (I know, I know)... It's nice and dark but has little touches of modernity all over it. I actually really liked the grand feel of this restaurant and, because of this, the cacophony of the boisterous group of Italians sitting next to us was only slightly annoying.The highlight was of course the food. Beautiful (just plain swell) pasta dishes that I seriously could have eaten a lot more of (despite my fullness) stole the proverbial show.There are so many excellent Italian restaurants I cant say that this will be our go-to spot.

2.0,6/27/2015,"Really wanted to like this place. Had a family dinner here and was seated in no time. I ordered the squid ink pasta dish w/ bay scallops which was good. Someone else in my group got the Frute De Mare (however you spell it) and it was good except the mussels were overcooked and tough. The last person in our group got the chicken parm. When that arrived it was a huge piece of chicken. However, upon cutting into it, we saw that it was very undercooked (the meat was clear and tough) so we sent it back, no problem. I get that it happens every once in awhile so we didn't make a fuss about it. The manager even came over and apologized for the dish. They brought out a fresh new piece of chicken (also huge portion), and we discovered this one was even more undercooked than the first one. The meat was pinkish/clear and was absolutely 100% undercooked - no doubt about it. So we got the waitress again and told her it was undercooked...again. She (and another waiter) both confirmed it was undercooked when they were at the table. So they took it back and we said that we didn't want another one, just give us the dessert menu. The manager came out again, and had the audacity to tell us that she looked at it in the kitchen and it was cooked perfectly fine. I get that it wasn't her fault, it was the cook's fault, and it happens sometimes, whatever. But to come to my table and lie straight to my face is absurd. I would have given this place a 1 star, but they didn't charge us for the two chickens that were undercooked, and they gave us all free dessert (which was mediocre).

It was a huge portion though, so we were glad we shared. We both had pizza one Parma and one Bosco. They took quite a while to arrive, but as we were enjoying a nice La Vigne Cabernet and people watching this wasn't a big problem for us.

I had like 4 slices of veal that were tough not sauced at all. The waitress who was horrible asked if me about my dish and I told her and she basically was oh well sorry.

2.0,8/26/2014,"I've debated for 2 weeks whether or not to post a review for this restaurant on account of the fact that I went for restaurant week lunch rather than ordering from the regular menu.  After much consideration, I've decided that if a restaurant is going to offer a set menu, the food should at least be edible.  The fish, skate, simply was not.  It had the sickening stench of ammonia and ruined my appetite for the day after the first bite.  I hope that this can be attributed to bad luck as opposed to the restaurant trying to pass off bad food. Moreover, the service was haphazard.  For instance, at least three servers inquired as to whether we wanted bread (which when it arived 20 mins later was very good).  Our failure to order alcoholic drinks, at lunch midweek, was met with a sneer. The starter, watermelon salad, and dessert, were each good but not exceptional in a city with countless hihg-end Italian retaurants.  Service from start to finish was near two hours which working people simply cannot deal with after expressly informing the staff of our concern.  Six people with tax and tip was approximately $200+ with tax and tip off the set menu.  For that amount of money I feel as though we could have gone to a nice restaurant without a restaurant week menu and had a better experience.",1,1,0,Sam B.,"Brooklyn, NY",64,52,9

For starters if you plan to drive here give yourself plenty of time.  Traffic in this area is terrible and the parking garages are expensive.  Go online and purchase a parking garage deal, it's worth it!The decor once you walk in is dark, the place is dimly lighted. What's up with the dark lighting these days? Some call it romantic, I call it stupid! Anyway,  we were cordially greeted and shown to our seats. They gave us this delicious complimentary foccacia bread. Nice and hot drizzled with olive oil and a hint of pepper and salt. So here goes, for starters we ordered the corn soup with roasted peppers and the arugula salad that had fennel and ricotta.  The soup was warm and delicious and the salad was fresh and crunchy. For entrees we had the roasted skate fish with fingerling potatoes and the grill pork tenderloin nestled on top of an heirloom bean salad. My son ordered the braided pasta twists with the beef ragu. The entrees were delicious. The fish was perfectly crusted and seasoned. The grill pork tenderloin was perfectly cooked to a medium well. The pasta coupled with that delicious beef ragu was stellar!For dessert we had the tiramisu and prosecco granita,  the granita is sort of like a sorbet. The desserts were sweet, refreshing and satisfying.I must say the service was phenomenally good! Our glasses of water were always filled.

The food was quite good yet pricey. The restaurant borders on a high class chain restaurant spacious enough to serve large groups yet fancy enough to have many sophisticated dish options, none of which were trademarked (tm). I can see how this place may rub some the wrong way, it may appear to be pretentious without merit; but based on the large sampling of dishes I tried (thanks to my company) I would say the food deserves a four star yelp rating.

2.0,1/22/2014,"I've been to Casa Nonna countless times, more for happy hour than anything else.  The food here is pretty good, but not great, and I prefer the food and atmosphere at Mercato around the block a lot more.  Very large restaurant so it never feels intimate.  It's tough to find good places in the area, so I think this gives the managers and even the hostesses a false sense of importance.  Waiters/bartenders are good, other staff are not.",0,0,0,Meesh C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,37,0
2.0,1/19/2014,"A very nice restaurant; wide open space with plenty of room for large parties. The service was great and the decor was modern and very nice, so an extra star for that but the food was mediocre and nothing to call home about. I thought based on other reviews the food would be better but I wasn't impressed. Maybe I've just been spoiled as I was raised on authentic, tasty Italian food? While it was good, basic Italian, the flavor was bland and nothing we ordered 'blew my mind'.

I was taking some people to lunch for the Christmas holiday, I had raved about this place as the other times I had been there I was very pleased with the food (although it is a bit overpriced).  I had made a 1 pm reservation. Was there on time to be seated and was basically neglected by the people at the front desk. They would say our table was going to open up, and proceeded to sit guest after guest that arrived after us.  When we approached the folks at the desk, we were basically given the same story--""the table is going to be available shortly""---again, more guests were seated. No one got back to us, offered us a drink or made any accommodation. In ffact, we couldn't even get eye contact at that point. It appeared that the person in charge, Robert Martel was hiding from us.

1.0,9/25/2013,WORST SERVICE EVER--Overpriced food-- rude staff- an entrée of scallops got confused as an appetizer-- they only had three scallops on the plate-- really at the prices they chargeWe went there as a group from work to celebrate a birthday. Being that the staff knew this--you would think that when dessert was ordered they would put a candle in the cake or something-- nope-- in fact dessert came to the table before coffee-- not timed well at all Also -- we really need to ask more than once for a refill on water and bread? A heads up to the waitress -- if you and a co worker are going to talk about our table-- don't point at our table - and make faces.It was a Monday night- you were not busy-- you should have been a bit more attentive and nice.Food- was ok - not amazing ad for what you charge-- portions should have been more generousOverall - not going back nor would I recommend this place,0,1,0,Melissa S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,6,0
5.0,9/18/2013,"This instantly has become my new favorite Italian restaurant in NYC, and that's saying a lot. It helps that it is in my Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, but the food experience still has me raving 24 hours later. When I visited Florence, a local chef served her Italian marinara sauce that was so perfect that I could just eat it by the spoonful for days. This is the first marinara sauce that I've found that equals it. I came alone, and I was seated promptly at the chef's table facing the kitchen. There were a couple of service issues. I had to wait a while for a server to notice me, and then the kitchen lost my order. So, why five stars? Because of the way that the restaurant and server recovered. Due to the wait for my entree, the chef sent out a complimentary meatball in the marina sauce that was so extraordinary that I will go back just for the meatballs. Later, they served a small dessert. Thank goodness for the recovery because the food deserved every bit of the five stars. The complimentary bread with oil was so crispy and addictive that I had to have two servings, and I don't eat carbs generally. Now, it's a traditional Italian comfort food menu, and not innovative. I had chicken parm that was skillet fried in a light batter, accompanied by mixed vegetables of zuchini and squash strings in a parmesan cheese sauce that was similar to a cheesy spaghetti. The quality of the ingredients, the home made pastas, the charcoal oven grilled pizzas, and the meats made in house all made this restaurant so memorable that I'm still thinking about it, and planning my next visit.",1,0,0,Todd B.,"Midtown, Atlanta, GA",751,694,6

1.0,7/29/2013,"I'm not usually a difficult or picky eater but I had a pretty bad experience at Casa Nonna, gave them a chance to correct it which they failed to do and as a result wouldn't go back. Here's what happened...First off, it's strange that they have a huge blazing brick pizza oven when you walk in but they don't bring you a pizza menu at dinner. Since it was 90 degrees out and I had to sit about 20 ft from this fiery hot oven I thought we should at least enjoy brick oven pizza! They brought us the pizza menu only because we requested it. The waiter said they want to discourage customers from ordering pizza at dinner because it's mainly for lunch and that's why they didn't bring the pizza menu with the regular menu - weird! The Amelia pizza with sausage and broccoli was pretty good. I will say it was the most interesting pizza on the menu and the others were hum drum (e.g. cheese, pepperoni, mushroom) but had pretentious fancy names. If I was forced to return for some reason I would just have the pizza. I ordered the gnocchi with crispy pig ears and pork ragu as my main (it is technically a primi course). I looooove gnocchi and order it frequently at restaurants. I also make it at home sometimes with frozen gnocchi and sauce from a jar and I enjoy that more than this pretentious poorly executed version. The gnocchi themselves were overcooked and mushy but the sauce was really what ruined it. The crispy pig ear in the sauce was really unpleasant since they were in quite large chunks and are very crunchy and hard, like the consistency of burnt toast. This is an ingredient that should be in small pieces and used sparingly but it's all you taste when in huge chunks and everything else in the dish is mush. Some of the pieces were so hard they were inedible and in addition there were chunks of pork gristle that were also inedible in the pork ragu sauce. Just after I found and spit out a huge piece of pork cartilage in the sauce the manager stopped by to ask how the food was so I showed it to him. He apologized, took the dish away and brought me a menu to order something else. I ordered the risotto which they prepared quickly given the situation. The risotto was just OK. It was bland so I added a bunch of pepper which made it OK but wasn't the yummy perfect dish I think of risotto to be when it's made correctly.My friend that I went with ordered the Frutti di Mare which I tasted and it was just OK as well - it was plain spaghetti with a plain marinara sauce and seafood sprinkled around.

3.0,6/7/2013,"Man, I just wasn't blown away! And I wanted to be. Everything was tasty, but nothing had me drooling over the table.. I'd definitely still give this place another try though. First thing's first: the bread. They give this delicious, spiced, cheesy bread to really wet that appetite. The bread might have been my favorite thing in all honesty, it was delicious. Onto the apps... I came with a big group, so we orderd a whole bunch of bites for the table: eggplant caponata bruschetta, sweet pea bruschetta, calamari, lasagna verde, and meatballs. The two bruschettas were completly underwhelming. Womp, womp. The calamari was good, and it was a nice surprise to see fried julienne veggies in there as well. The lasagna was alright, nothing to write home about. I'd say the star of the appetizer round was the meatball. Big, juicy, in a pool of delicious tomato sauce with a massive dollop of ricotta and some strips of parmigiano. I could have eaten those things all night!For my entree I went with the seafood tagliolini, with shrimp, calamari, mussels, clams. Unfortunately it seems I got skimped of some seafood. Namely, there were only two mussels and very few pieces of shrimp. The pasta itself was quite tasty, with a light tomato sauce of garlic and herb. I tasted a bite of the gnocci with pork ragu and crispy pork ear-- my runner up for an entree. And let me say I'm glad I didn't order this one. The pork had some layers of fat I had to peel through to get to the meat and while it breaks my heart to say it, the flavor of the sauce wasn't that different from something I might find in a can...While I wasn't blown away by the meal, I did leave full and happy.

It's quiet enough to be able to carry on a conversation at normal levels, and the tables are big and spacing is comfortable.For my entree, I had the gnocchi with braised duck. Not the biggest portions, but it was very good. The gnocchi was cooked just right, and the duck/sauce had some great flavor. However, there were some hard/crunchy tasteless bits of something that were overly caramelized or something. Not sure what it was.The Brussels sprouts were also roasted pretty well. They come with caramelized apples, which was a little shocking at first to the palette, but I got used to it and loved it.

5.0,2/8/2013,"This place is a diamond in the rough. I never would have thought there could be this good of a restaurant in the Penn Station-Port Authority vicinity, but this place totally exceeded my expectations. First, there are a lot of rave reviews about the bread they serve you when seated, and they are definitely warranted. The bread was really unique - instead of your traditional Italian bread, they serve up a warm flat bread with melted cheese on top.. really good. For antipasti, we ordered the veal meatballs and the arancini. I would highly recommend either, or both! The veal meatballs were tender and smothered in red sauce and a dollop of creamy ricotta and parmesan shavings. Eat everything together and you get a perfect harmonious bite of hot, rich meatballs with cool, light ricotta. If you've never had arancini, I'm a big fan. It is simply a fried ball of risotto with some sort of meat and cheese inside. Just indulge and enjoy. For my main course I had the Gnocchi, with braised duck, wild mushrooms and ricotta. Besides being slightly over-salted, this was seriously tasty. Gnocchi was nice and pillowy, though not the best gnocchi I've had (nothing has compared to the pillows of heaven I had in Italy), but the flavors were all there. Definitely recommend trying this pasta dish. I also mooched and had a bite of my friend's Bianca pizza. White pizza with 4 cheeses, drizzled with truffle oil... I mean, I don't even have to tell you how good it was. I will tell you that the dough was good, thin but not too thin, still had a good bite to it. If I hadn't ordered the gnocchi,  I definitely would have ordered this pizza. After all that food no one had room for dessert, though judging by everything we ate I'm sure they wouldn't disappoint. Topped it all off with a glass of Sangiovese red and overall I would say I had a 5 star Italian meal. Rare for me to rave about Italian restaurants but seriously if you need a go-to in this area, go here! Unlike most good Italian restaurants (which are usually hole in the wall type places), the restaurant is huge so keep it in mind if you need a place that is good for large groups.",1,0,0,Trish W.,"Manhattan, NY",2,26,0
2.0,2/6/2013,"This is a challenge for me to write. This place lost a star from me because of the service I received from Luther the bartender.. So let's start out with what worked. What worked was the quality of the wine and food. The other bartender, a young blonde woman with glasses was lovely. The hostesses were polite and welcoming. Since this is about my experience..here goes. It was 6:48 and I had 1/2 a glass of wine remaining. I requested another glass to take advantage of the happy hour. I was told by Luther that there was a NYC state law that prohibited my request. I happen to know that that is an absolute lie since as a bartender myself I have honored the requests of many NYPD officers to serve them a Corona and tequila shot on the side! Which as a professional I do happily. I disputed his answer and he then told me ""well it's up to my discretion.""  I found that response to be an acknowledgment of his lack of education regarding the law and a commentary on how he thought I deserved to be treated. There was a lovely gentleman whose information I had exchanged with my own for networking purposes who Luther chose to use his discretion and serve at the happy hour price an additional glass of wine after he told me no .I later found out that he was a regular.  I however, was refused. My bill was $18 I tipped $3.00 because I am fair and I am certain that the other bartender was sharing tips with him. She did not deserve to get a poor tip.  I happen to be an African American woman and I do not want to speculate if that was a factor informing his use of  his discretionary options, however it was very uncomfortable and very embarrassing. The gentleman next to me offered to buy me a glass of wine but I refused politely. I simply felt subjected to poor/unfair service and a substandard attitude for an individual committed to being  in the service industry. So there ya go. Yes I will go back, however. I now  know what to expect. Less than I hoped but the food and wine are good and it's near my office. I'll say to my friends going forward....""There is this yummy place with a rude, arrogant and entitled bartender..I hope he's not there"".

Not to thick nor water down with tomato sauce. The pepperoni was the typical round ones. It look like ham too me, but it was very thin too. It went very well with the thin crust.

4.0,2/1/2013,"I didn't know about this place until I found it listed as a participant for NYC Restaurant Week. I thought it was going to be one of those quaint little restaurants tucked away among the many restaurants in Hell's Kitchen but was pleasantly surprised by the huge entrance, spacious bar and pretty much spacious everything. I loved the decor. And as I try to recall now, it seemed even bigger after having a Dirty Martini with extra olives. But I digress..First the warm bread filled with cheese...so good. My friend and I were pleasantly surprised. At first glance, it looked like just plain bread. Until we took a bite, and wow. While my friend started with a salad, I started with the sausage and polenta, which I finished before my friend could ask me how it was. For the entree, I had the chicken (which was a bit salty for my taste), sausage (which was just OK) with potatoes (which was dry, like it was left in the oven too long). Despite all that however, I cleared my plate. Could've been the Dirty Martini, or maybe I was hungrier than I thought. All in all, my belly was full and I was happy.But of course, the belly isn't full enough for dessert. I had the panna cotta which was delicious and perfectly creamy as a panna cotta should be. Accompanied with green tea.Lovely place --- not too stuffy ---, great service from the moment you walk in and the food not so bad.

The bread pudding (budino di pane) was also tasty.

We shared the ruccola salad and each got a pizza.  The salad was very good--dressing was nice and light.  The pizza was good, too--wood fired thin crust.  My only complaints were that there was not enough basil on my margherita pizza and the cheese tasted a little funny.  But, again, we were so hungry that we scarfed everything right up.Overall, I'd come back here again if I ever stay in the Element and don't feel like traveling more than a block for dinner.",0,0,0,Katie B.,"Washington, DC",0,26,0

Another Yelper likes the ""cheese bread""   - I commented to the bartender that it was way too greasy - wipe your fingers greasy.  Could not eat it.  Since I had a big breakfast today, I went with a simple lunch - a sausage panini.  Seemed a safe pick.  Wrong again.  Sausage tasted good enough but something was off.  Looked at the bread and saw that it was soaked with olive oil.  You could see a greenish line from the cut surface almost thru to the crust. I should have sent it back but screw it; I ate a few bites and left 3/4 on the plate.

4.0,2/2/2012,"Stumbled upon this place through co-workers when we needed a place to go for lunch. I liked the atmosphere, ambience and food so I decided to bring my husband here for a romantic dinner. Had I seen the prices (my boss paid for our lunch), I may have passed this place up, it is quite expensive! Over $100 for 2 people, and this is with no drinks, just 1 salad to split, 2 entrees, 2 desserts and a cappuccino. I think it's a little overpriced, especially for the small portions given. That being said, we really loved the food and service, only took off 1 star for the high prices. It stars with being greeted by a lovely hostess who offers to hang your coat up in their coat room (and helps you put your coat on when you leave). The wait staff is very helpful in suggesting items from the menu. We started with the Mista salad, a delicious salad that has grapefruit, gorgonzola and candied hazelnut, among other things. We asked to share this, and they were nice enough to bring it in 2 separate plates, the portion was decent, but still pricey at $12. Next I had the grilled whole Mediterranean sea bass, which was amazing! My only complaint is that it doesn't come with any sides whatsoever, you have to order those ala carte. The portion was just right, in that I didn't feel  stuffed. The citrus sauce and herbs really brought out the flavor! Definitely would recommend it. My husband ordered the Pollo Alla Parmigiana which is basically a chicken parmagian. I tried, it was also very good, however I found the pan fried chicken to be a little dry and over cooked. Aside from that it was great. That dish too didn't come with any sides, my husband was expecting at least a little bit of pasta. Finally for dessert we had the cannoli and gelati, both of which were excellent . All in all it was a very enjoyable meal and  I would recommend this place if you can afford it.

The prices are also very reasonable for the city - a 4-course ""regional"" menu (at 7pm on a weeknight) was $35, which is hard to beat.  It's a large space and would be good for a business dinner or even a date, because there is a large room in the back that is lovely, quiet and aware from all the action.  This will be my go-to place on the far west side when Chelsea is too far south - if you are in or near this neighborhood, I'd recommend Casa Nonna highly.",0,0,0,Carolyn S.,"East Hanover, NJ",0,7,0

3.0,8/5/2011,"This place is huge. I don't know how packed they get at dinner but judging by the number of people there during lunch I'd say they really don't need that much space.  The food had a nice presentation but I went with whole wheat pasta with cauliflower so they did the best they could given the ingredients. On the plus side, the two bites I took really filled me up and kept the hunger pangs at bay for the rest of the day.",0,0,0,Diana K.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,95,0
4.0,8/1/2011,"Awesome Midtown lunch spot! Great atmosphere, had the Saffron Risotto balls, braised meatballs and Caprese salad for an appetizer( seriously who writes a review on fried calamari?). All were stellar, especially the meatballs. The braised short ribs over ""rags"" was extremely flavorful. Service was FANTASTIC! constant attention, very polite, water glass never empty, wine glass refilled...seriously impressed( of course this could be just because the place is new but impressive nonetheless). The place is big, has a nice bar and I noticed a private 20 person ""board room"" with flat screen on the way to the bathroom. Will definitely be back.",0,0,0,Tom D.,"New York, NY",17,34,0
5.0,7/5/2011,"Had dinner here with a group of 5 last Friday night (3 guys, 2 girls).  We were looking for a spot close to Penn Station, to start our night after our friend arrived from DC on the Acela.  Case Nonna fit the bill perfectly.  It is a huge culinary step-up from the usual Irish pub fare in that neighborhood and served as a festive beginning to my friend's weekend in NYC.Food:Solid, traditional Southern Italian menu, executed very well.Although it is not family-style, we ordered communally and shared all dishes.  In particular, we enjoyed the prosciutto and melon appetizer - always a great, reliable combination of flavors.As for entrees, the homemade pasta was simply outstanding.  The gnocchi (all'aragosta) was the best I have ever had - not too flour-y or starchy, nearly melts in your mouth, but retains plenty flavor and texture.  I do not like lobster, but the flavor was not overpowering.  The spaghetti al pomodoro was tremendous as well.  The sauce is your typical grandmother's sauce, but the homemade spaghetti is superb.  While we enjoyed the veal milanese (brontosaurus-sized, served on the bone), the margherita and parma pizzas, the homemade pasta is the showstopper.Service:Excellent; not too pushy or overbearing, but always attentive.The manager and 2 hostesses greeted us as we came in.  The manager came over to the table twice during the meal to check-in.  When we raved about the pasta, he explained that the pasta-maker was previously at Convivio, which explains the excellent quality.  The waitress was pleasant, with a good grasp of the menu, and recommended the parma pizza, which we enjoyed.Decor:Casual and fun, yet modern.It is a huge space - 2 full dining rooms, a stool-lined pizza bar, a large, separate bar area and a Go-Burger all within one restaurant.  It can feel cavernous, almost like Carmine's (either location).  Because the restaurant is split with open walls separating the various sections, it has none of the hustle and bustle and cacophony of Carmine's (and MUCH better food).Bad:The neighborhood is a bit isolated, and does not seem to get much foot traffic.  Although it has a decent bar scene, it is more of a neighborhood-y place, not a see-and-be-seen vibe (more a Union Square Cafe or Blue Smoke vibe, than Beauty and Essex or Kingswood).Agree with the prior commenter about the sub-par garlic bread (but I do not care for garlic, anyway).  We did not have dessert, after gorging ourselves, so I cannot review the desserts.",1,1,2,Scott K.,"New York, NY",0,13,2
3.0,6/30/2011,"Went here tonight by accident cuz my friend and I was in the area and can't find any place without the wait lines First we started out with the fried calamari, my friend and I both really like it, is crispy but at the same time after you start chewing it, is soft and tasty, very goodFollowing by another appetizers flat brand, which was good I thought, but to the last piece, my friend took it and put into her mouth, she spit it back out, and said it smell like dishwasher liquid, since this is the last piece, we don't want them to think we're trying to get some free dish, so we never did complain, and we let it goMy friend ordered a shrimp pasta, and I ordered the rib eye steakMy friend took 2 bite of her pasta and told me it was really salty My steak was so salty it took away the steak flavor, my friend even make a joke about the chef must be having some hand shaking problems he can't stop shaking the salt over food he is cookingThe service is good here, everyone is very friendly, different managers stop by and checked on us, however the kitchen have some serious problem, for this place to continue staying in business, they must seriously looking into their kitchen I can understand if ONLY my steak was salty, must because of the chef on the grill, or if ONLY my friend pasta was salty, must be the chef on the pasta department, but both of these orders coming from 2 different corners in the kitchen, can't be 2 different chef having the same problem with the saltAnd IF one chef cooking these two dishes, which I don't think so, but let say it is, this is where the problem at, because each different dishes should be prepare by different chef, steak and burgers, pasta, fried food and salad, soup and side orders, they all should be different chefOverall, they're getting a 3 stars, set up at the restaurant, friendly hosts and servers",1,0,1,Kenny T.,"Las Vegas, NV",49,196,34
4.0,6/28/2011,"This review is only for the bar. I came here the right next day of the grand opening and was pretty empty (around 6pm Saturday). The staffs seemed to be still a bit confused with the system of the brand new restaurant. In fact, there were several inconvenience, like, long wait for a cocktail, and nobody knew how to change the TV channel at the bar. But again, those small things happen all the time for newly opened restaurants. So, over all, I think the service was goodAs for the drinks, the beer selection was not wide, but it's something you find in beer focused bars(not dive bar kind). Personally, I think what you should try here is their cocktails. I tried a couple of them and the most favorite among all was ""granitas""(frozen)! I had that of cherry blossom and loved soo much! Was perfect treat for hot summer night...! I also had a chance to look around the entire restaurant and found that this place is much bigger than I first thought. Private dining room(got a big TV screen), counter table dining area, main dining room, and spacious bar area. One thing I'm concerned about this place is the little gap with the neighborhood. While many iron chef's top notch restaurants in Manhattan are having hard time to fill up their tables in this recession time, I'm honestly not sure if this relatively fancy-side restaurant will survive well in the dive bar district...",0,0,0,Takako T.,"New York, NY",68,268,180
4.0,6/16/2011,"For appetizers we had the arancini and the caesar salad.  The arancini were bland and needed salt which was too bad since they were fried perfectly (not greasy at all).  Unfortunately the dish consists of only three arancini.  For dinner we had the swordfish and branzino.  Both were really well seasoned and delicious.  For dessert we had the budino and torrone semi freddo.  The budino was warm with a molten center.  The torrone was delicious.  I'm still not sure which one I liked better, they were both incredible.  The casanova drink was better than the blood orange margarita.  The garlic bread was hot and well seasoned.  I would definitely go back.  I'm not sure I would call this restaurant reasonably priced.  Our tab with four drinks and tip came out to almost $200.  The service was great.",0,0,0,Amanda V.,"Nassau County, NY",1,2,0
4.0,6/16/2011,"I was really excited to go to this restaurant because I am a big fan of the BLT restaurants. However, I think recently BLT restaurant group joined forces with a parent company called ESquared Hospitality. I was lucky enough to attend the opening of Casa Nonna and it was really exciting. It's a huge space-- definitely a good spot if you're going with big groups. They have a big open kitchen, which is really cool because you can see how your food is being prepared (which is good in a lot of cases). They also have a pizza station that has its own wood-fire oven. I shared a Margherita pizza with my sister, and it was delicious. We couldn't finish it though! I wouldn't say that the pie was huge, but it was definitely enough to feed two people. We also tasted the eggplant parmigiana and I can honestly say that it was the best eggplant parmigiana I've ever had---and I've had my fair share of it. I think that the appeal of Casa Nonna is right in its name--in italian it means Grandmother's House. That pretty much says it all. It's real, traditional, authentic italian food. The prices might be a bit high, but that's what you get for great quality. The waitstaff were really friendly and accommodating, and so clean! They were always there to clear an empty plate! There aren't that many great restaurants in that neighborhood, but Casa Nonna will probably get a lot of diners from people leaving Times Square and the theater district. It should attract a lot of diners going or leaving the theater. Looks like I know where to go after the next show I see!",0,0,1,Amanda B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0
2.0,6/13/2011,To be honest I don't know how this place has a chance of surviving.  I had the pizza with panchetta and arugula... it was pretty chewy and my mouth was actually tired after eating it.  The place is MASSIVE... with no signage and no way of knowing it is actually there.  Service was great though which is why it gets 2 stars.  Also the 2go burger in front is the best part of the whole place... they get 4 stars.,2,0,0,Nick H.,"Manhattan, NY",101,9,0
2.0,6/13/2011,"Had the spaghetti with the pancetta - great!  Then had the pizza with truffle oil - pretty average.  Note that you have to ask for the pizza menu at dinner - they dont offer it up.  For dessert, had the chocolate pudding cake with gelato.  It was forgettable and the cake wasn't served warm (despite the description!).  Overall, not worth the price.Ps the garlic bread they serve you is lacking - dry and stale tasting!",0,0,1,Nico C.,"Manhattan, NY",8,218,270
3.0,6/8/2011,"Adjacent left of The Emerald Green, a Glenwood Residence, lies this New York outpost of the OG Restaurant in Washington, D.C. Similar menus offered antipasti as well as 'affordable' Italian food in a bustling Fashion District. An added bonus to this E Squared Restaurant is the integration of a GO2 Burger inside the restaurant. After Laurent Tourondel parted ways and won a recent lawsuit, it looks like the 'BLT' name is now being shared. We still saw omnipresent sign boards of their sister BLT restaurants. The genius of this event is that they reached out to their potential customer base, the neighborhood. With literally 20 or so residential buildings within an 8 block radius, it was the right thing to do. When we pinged people that lived inside Emerald Green, they mentioned that this was the first Social Event the building has ever thrown.In terms of the food, there were 3 'stations': ANTIPASTI, BUFFET, FOOD BAR. Antipasti served caprese, beet salad w/ grapefruit, rolled stuffed speck, and the sort. The buffet stations included chicken parm, broccoli rabe, garlic bread, carved steak, eggplant parm, pasta, Caesar Salad, and the like. The bar included personal pizzas, 2GO burger sliders, mini chocolate and vanilla milkshakes, etc. Passed around were savory bites aka hors' doeuvres such as eggplant caponata and fried risotto balls and meatballs. Desserts were both laid out for the taking or passed around, and was comprised of a budino shaped like a cupcake, cannoli, and beignet w/ lemon curd under it, zest over it. There were cutesy mini chocolate and vanilla milkshakes as well, courtesy of 2GO Burger. We even spotted Cake Maven Sylvia Weinstock chewing on some delectable sweets. There was also a separate DRINK BAR area where plates were laid out for the taking.On hand were many 'Real Housewives' wannabes as well as those who came in shorts and tees. All in all, a mixed crowd, mostly older with questionable taste. Overall, our discerning palates were not impressed by the grub. We found the food to be mostly underseasoned and overcooked. Even the sliders had no hint of pink at all. In a nutshell, The fare was super safe, predictable and very affordable given the steakhouse-like feel of the dark wood laden interior. Given the time constraints and 'beta' run, hopefully Casa Nonna will take heed to our write up and make changes accordingly.There were highlights though. We liked the bacalao pizza, garlicky broccoli rabe, budino, and cocktails. Namely, the blood orange martini and the grapefruit martinis. Given the tough times and state of the economy, perhaps this niche type of food and these price points will appeal to many. The jury is still out on whether this restaurant can sustain patronage with such an expansive space. Only time will tell in the weeks to come.",2,3,1,Jeff C.,"New York, NY",1152,1258,14
