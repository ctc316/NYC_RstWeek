We ordered the meatball appetizer and Brussels sprouts, both of which were pretty good. We didn't order pasta but only because none of it sounded that incredible!",0,0,0,Caitlin D.,"New York, NY",170,106,108
1.0,4/27/2019,"Beware if you order the risotto...we checked out the menu online. I noticed they had risotto for 20.00, so when I mentioned it to the waiter, he said the whole table has to order the risotto! Which is not a problem but the waiter neglected to tell us that each person would be charged 21.00, making the total amount charged for risotto 84.00. The risotto was not worth 84.00. Or 20.00 for that matter. We will not be going back.",0,0,0,Nancy M.,"St. Louis, MO",0,1,0
4.0,4/22/2019,"Trattoria Italienne is a great place to go for dinner with family. It has a very rustic chic aura to it. Service is fantastic, and food is great too. I highly recommend their salad and potato appetizer, as well as any of their pastas. My only complaint would be the portion sizes, which are quite small for the prices. But it's definitely a great option for elegant Italian food in the city!",0,0,0,Nayla B.,"Manhattan, NY",192,151,267
5.0,4/22/2019,"I found Trattoria Italienne through a dining rewards app. The ambience was perfect for a rainy Friday evening date night-soft lighting, cozy yet luxurious decor, and a quiet buzz of conversation. The service was excellent. After taking our orders, the waiter brought us a pretzel shaped bread, coated in olive oil and perfectly seasoned. It was so good! And very nicely presented, hanging on a little bread hook thing. Our waters were promptly refilled throughout the meal, and the manager/owner even stopped by to ask us how the food was.We ordered the Frico di Patate Con Speck as an appetizer, and for our mains, the Papardelle and Fazoletti. The appetizer came in a small portion but was so flavorful and unique. Highly recommend. The Fazoletti was not bad and was lighter in taste, but I preferred the Papardelle. The rich meaty flavors mixed perfectly with the cheese, peas, and pasta.Our total bill came out to a little over $40 per person all in for two entrees and an app. As someone who sometimes hesitates at the prices of fancy pasta, I will gladly return to Trattoria Italienne for a nice date night meal that doesn't break the bank.",1,0,0,Vivian K.,"New York, NY",0,13,36

5.0,4/21/2019,"This restaurant has become one of our favorites in Manhattan. Last time, we celebrated a birthday on a friend's recommendation. Last night, we brought our grown children.  We were fortunate to have Kyle as our server again. He is very knowledgeable and caring. The restaurant features Italian with a French flare. For appetizers, we shared the Frico Di Patate (fried potato and prosciutto), the Polpo alla Plancha (Octopus), and Escarot.  All were outstanding but the Patate was the unanimous favorite.  For entrees, three of us had the Loup de Mer Provencal (sea bass) and one had Gnocchi Patate.  All were done to perfection and very fresh. For dessert, we shared the Olive Oil Cake, panacotta, and some gelato/sorbet.  All were tasty. The last time we visited, we had the cote de bouef. That was a spectacular presentation of well prepared steak. It was succulent and juicy with a smokey flavor. Great place.  Excellent food and attentive and friendly service.",0,0,0,James L.,"Poway, CA",0,25,0
5.0,4/12/2019,"I've been here twice now and both times were fantastic. The buratta is divine, it's comes with bread that's toasted to perfection. The first time I had pasta that came with chicken liver ragu that was really interesting. The second time I went I got their butternut squash pasta dish that was awesome. It has mushrooms that gave it a really meaty and satisfying taste that went well with the squash. The gnocchi. Oh man, the gnocchi. It melts in your mouth. If you go here be sure to get it. Trust me, you wont regret it. The espresso is also really good. I'm a bit of a coffee snob and it lives up to my standards. It's definitely rich, they dose it a bit on the heabt side. They use really good beans so it's rich and chocolatey.",0,0,1,Matt D.,"Huntington, NY",158,6,0
5.0,4/12/2019,Stopped in here for a drink and a quick bite to rest our feet before heading to the airport. Such a lovely spot! Happy hour...thank you! Starts at 2pm! We sat at bar and conversed with a very nice hard working young woman that made creative drinks and was hand cutting beautifully clear ice cubes for spectacular cocktails. I need to return here for dinner - the management is great and knows how to hire quality people. Atmosphere and friendliness was superb. Going to return when I have more time.

4.0,4/3/2019,"Randomly happened upon this place on a Friday night and decided to stop inside. The decor is just beautiful and the ambiance is very welcoming. It was surprisingly empty for a Friday night at 9PM. We asked to sit at the bar and the bartender took our orders quickly.When I imagine a casual Friday in the city, this is the kind of place I would go. It isn't loud and rowdy so you can have a real conversation, feels high end without emptying your wallet, and has a good selection of drinks and food. It's also in a super convenient location. There's also no wait, which is a huge win. We only order cocktails and bar snacks but would definitely come back for a formal meal since the food menu looked really great.

4.0,3/7/2019,"This is a beautiful restaurant, and far too fancy for me. I know this because the lights automatically turn on in the restroom, whereas I belong in places where I have to fumble in the darkness, touching the no-doubt sticky walls so I am obligated to wash my hands in a sink that will somehow make my hands even dirtier for having used it. This is not that place.Trattoria Italienne is high-ceilinged and grand. The staff will fold your napkin whilst you use their auto-illuminated facilities, change out your silverware even after the absolutely stunning amuse bouche (some sort of potato pancake that puts your aunt's best latkes to shame), and not even shame you if you want to take part in the Restaurant Week menu. We came in for a far fancier lunch than we had originally anticipated, and it was well worth the $26 for two courses.We dined on paté and goat cheese crostinis, reveled in polpettini and polenta, enjoyed ocean trout and braised shortribs. The tiny meatballs were excellent, and the goat cheese edged out the paté for second place amongst my favorite starters. The trout was lovely and light, and even though the shortribs did not fall apart as one might hope, the flavors were there and the accompanying potatoes made it all worthwhile.The best thing we ate, however, were the rich cappellacci di zucca. Tiny envelopes of pasta filled with butter and butternut squash, with a quince mostarda and a hazelnut amaretti. I barely even know what those last two things are, but I ate them and loved every second of it. Things move a bit slower than you might like if you're trying to get back to the office during a workday, but you're better off just getting a bottle of wine, staying all afternoon, and quitting your job anyway. Too bad I have to pay for things, or I would've.",19,17,18,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4675,3021,10459
5.0,3/2/2019,The best of both worlds! Italian and French cuisine at once! Food was incredible and one of the best Escargots I've had in Manhattan! I've had a lot too. We started with a complimentary birthday champagne toast and I then had a few mezcal cocktails. We had the Burrata and escargot for appetizers and The octopus and fettuccine alfredo with a side of roasted brussel sprouts. Everything was superb! Even came out with a birthday scoop of maple gelato with a candle. The staff were very friendly attentive and helpful with recommendations on what to order. The ambiance and decor is very romantic with candles all over to add to the dining experience. Lasha was a great server! Highly recommended and definitely will be going back.

4.0,2/24/2019,"Dined here on a Saturday night with two other people at 8:30pm. The restaurant was full and had a lively atmosphere. We ordered the Piatto Di Formaggio to share (three cheese plate), the Parpadelle (Tuscan red wine beef, chicken liver ragu), the Macaroncello (not on the menu on the website but it was with lamb sausage) and the brussel sprouts. For drinks my friend had the old fashioned and I had the Mai Tai'lienne and the Regal Bees.The cheese plate was a little disappointing. I've definitely had better variety and better plating. They throw three slabs of cheese (blue cheese, Parmesan and a soft cheese) on one board and give you four pieces of walnut bread, a tiny bit of honey and a tiny bit of some other fruit jam on another board. It was just ok.The standouts were definitely the brussel sprouts and the parpadelle. The brussel sprouts were perfectly cooked, soft, well seasoned and with delicious bits of pancetta. We devoured these. The parpadelle was definitely al dente (which we all agreed we liked), and came with a delicious beef sauce. The third pasta was also cooked perfectly but pretty plain in taste. Probably wouldn't recommend.Overall, this is a solid place to stop by with good options for food and a great fun atmosphere. I'd recommend if you're in the area!",1,0,0,Elizabeth H.,"New York, NY",1,49,2

They are soft and pillowy, if that's a word, and hold onto an beautifully light sauce. And their steaks are super juicy and beautifully cooked.

4.0,2/11/2019,"When the meal starts off with complimentary pieces of cheesy fried potatoes you know it's going to be a memorable dining experience.And that it most definitely was. I stopped by for lunch and was pleasantly surprised to find out that restaurant week was going on. $26 for an appetizer and entree, plus an extra few dollars for a dessert course.I started out with the electric goat cheese dip - a goat cheese fondue mixed with tomato sauce and whole roasted garlic gloves, plus crostini for dipping. This was absolutely delicious. I mean, what could be better than a bowl of hot and gooey goat cheese? But things did get better. For my main I went with the butternut squash ravioli. The pasta was super fresh and tasted homemade. The portion was generous and combined with the app it was a super filling and delicious lunch for the price point.The decor is on point -- the hanging rope lights over the bar were dreamy. This is a great setting for a meal, but I'd also come back to enjoy a drink at the bar. Only knocking off a star because the service was very slow. Don't get me wrong- the service was fantastic, it just took a really long time for each course to come out. Fine for a leisure lunch, just not ideal if you are pressed for time during the workday.I'd love to come back and enjoy a cocktail post-work.

5.0,2/8/2019,"Restaurant week, you have my heart. Butter squash ravioli, you also have my heart. Really everything about this place is a hit from the decor, to the waiters, and the food (obviously). I got the 2 course Restaurant Week option, so for $26 you choose an appetizer and entree (or I guess entree and desert if you are feeling like having a wild lunch hour). My appetizer was the Polpettini (pork meatballs). I loved loved loveeeed the actual meatballs. Crispy on the outside and really flavorful and soft on the inside. But I was not a big fan at all of the purple/grayish sauce they came in. It's a very minor detail and just a personal preference. My entree was the Cappellacci Di Zucca, basically just butter squash raviolis. I tried a little of everyones dishes and these stole the show. They were so incredibly light and buttery. I'd get them again in a heart beat. I came here with some coworkers on our lunch break and unfortunately didn't realize how quickly time was flying by. We had to ask our waiter if there was anyway to put a bit of a rush on our entrees coming out because before we knew it, 1:00 was looming. He was very kind and did what he could to bring it out quickly. A few of us got dessert (the 3rd course) so he wrapped it up to go. So I'd most definitely would like to come back with no time restrictions when I can be shamelessly talked into a few cocktails and a very leisurely meal.

After we took our seat, we had to ask to get bread . We asked again for vinegar for bread and was told this wasn't  available in the restaurant . Excuse me ? How come an almost 5 star yelp rated Italian restaurant didn't have vinegar ? I ordered a spaghetti dish that was super dente , as firm as uncooked . The waitress has been nice and offered to take it away and gave me another one . I tried to explain the noodle needs to be cooked more since I couldn't eat to firm noodles . It is really simple request, however , they were not able to follow. The second one was brought over but still too firm . I got disappointed in general since it has been 9 pm but I didn't get enough to eat . I have been to a few nice Italian places in city like carbone or marea and the food/services deserve their ratings on yelp. The only thing of this place that can match the places is its prices .

3.0,9/11/2018,"I write this review in good faith but really wanted to give it one star. The only reason I am giving this place 3 stars is 1) the food was delicious (Italian/French flare) and 2) because I worked in the industry and I know how it feels to have your ENTIRE section sat at once & to be drowning a slow death of large parties (which was my party of 8, that night). But aside from these two things, I spare no one. You do not go to Italienne or a Thursday, Friday or Saturday. You ALSO do not go to Italienne if you have a party of 4 or more. As I said previously, the food is very good. We had all of the bar snacks, the Burrata, Gem Lettuce, Polpo alla Plancha, Pappardelle, Tagliatele (VERY GOOD), Macaroncello (FANTASTIC),the Sea Bass, Polenta (SUBPAR) & 1/2 Chicken (FANTASTIC). While the food was noteworthy (and the ONLY reason I gave this place three stars) it did not make up for the horrific service. It took them over an hour to deliver our main courses from small plates, to appetizers, to main courses. This is unacceptable. If you can't give a party of 8 appropriate service, that's okay - just don't allow the reservation.I think the thing that bothered me the most about this place was the up-sell. As stated multiple times in my profile, I am a winosaur and it's pretty hard to get my out of my comfort zone. I know what I like and what I don't like - it's kind of like convincing someone who doesn't like cats to get a kitten. The wine equivalent to this is forcing someone who doesn't really love earthy wines - to drink earthy, overpriced wine. Italienne has some exceptional glasses of wine but I am someone that does not believe in spending more than $20 for a glass of wine and my server, when presenting various wines to me, did everything in their power to serve me the most expensive wine on the menu (without listening to my preferences or needs). I get the tactic, and honestly, it's a good one (especially because we were a large party) but if I say ""no"" once, I will mean it the second and third time. The server did the same thing with the menu. We ordered way more than enough food and he kept pressing us to order more (and even tried to up-sell a 300$ of wine). If money is no object, you don't mind being up-sold, care little about service and don't mind a wait, this may be a good place for you. For the rest of us out there that care about these things, I would probably skip this spot. I did read through about 30 reviews for this place and it appears people have had exceptional service. Additionally, I was definitely sat in the busiest area of the restaurant. Maybe it was a bad night and I definitely want to give them that but I won't be going back.",3,0,0,Jessica S.,"Manhattan, NY",254,12,0

We decided to share dishes and started with the Roasted Little Gem Lettuce with Spanish boquerones (delicious). We were then going to have the Bigoli Della Casa with lamb pasta, but they had just run out of the lamb, so they tweaked it to using pancetta, borlotti beans and a tomato based sauce, and it was also fantastic. For the main entry we had the pan roasted chicken with panzanella salad, and it was every bit as good as we'd hoped. For desert we shared the olive oil cake with strawberries and sour cream sorbet.

We also got the bigoli pasta with lamb and fava beans, and the agnolotti with Yukon potatoes and mushrooms. Their pasta is made in house and it was so good. The bigoli was like a thick spaghetti and was perfectly al dente. Everything we had was so simple and yet so full of flavor. For dessert, we had peach sorbet, buttermilk panna cotta, and the chocolate cake. Every single one was delicious.

From the minute I called to make the reservation, to the minute I left the restaurant after my meal, I was treated as if I was their number one guest, although I had only been there once before! I was not only welcomed back by ALL of the staff members, but they went above and beyond to make my dining experience amazing! From a warm welcome by Ellen at the front, to Kyle knowing exactly what to recommend and served it all with a smile, to James greeting the guests and making the dining experience one where you feel like you were invited to their home for a home cooked meal! and now for the actual meal..WOW! Consistently delicious food! Some stand out appetizers are the unique pickle board (think pickled strawberry!! better than I would have imagined) the Ocean Trout ""salad"" but lets talk about the FRICO! OH MY FRICO that was delicious! I will crave that and go often for the frico and the handmade chocolates, I could eat those daily! They even have Gluten Free pasta made in Italy from the finest Italian pasta makers and shipped here. It may possibly be the best gluten free pasta I have ever tried! You can choose any of the pasta dishes to be substituted with this GF pasta so you don't lose out on trying everything! They even had GF bread to serve with the Burrata appetizer!  I HIGHLY recommend the homemade chocolate flight at the end of your meal, or at least order one or two!

5.0,12/12/2017,"This is not just a restaurant, it is a dining experience. Our friend Deirdre joined my wife and I for a beautiful 3 hour dinner of the best food from northern Italy and southern France.We started with a beautiful platter of prosciutto with just a dash of horseradish. It was amazing, as was the second course of burata and a pappardelle with venison ragu. All night I kept seeing these things that looked liked pretzels going by. I got up and asked the pastry chef what they were and he told me they were Fougasse, a kind of bread. Unfortunately they were out of them. After much begging and pleading he spoke to the chef and they made one especially for us. It was like a pretzel with herbs and bacon hot out of the oven. Finally, we had our main courses, which, for my friend Deirdre was a platter of different cuts of venison, all cooked to perfection. My wife ordered a delicate chicken dish, which came with mushrooms and a wine sauce. Finally, the best for last. I had Casoncelli, dumplings stuffed with veal and lamb, with grilled pancetta and sage. Every bite of the dumplings just burst in my mouth!!We were stuffed but still craved a light sweet. Our waiter, Kyle, who was incredibly knowledgeable suggested milk gelato. We asked if we could have some of their 30 year old Balsamic vinegar on top.

2.0,11/12/2017,"My bad - I reserved before rechecking the menu. You have to leave a credit card number and since it was the day before we would have been charged $25.00 per person to cancel. The dishes I was interested in (from Yelp and instagram) were gone. They did have a few that sounded okay so we went ahead and had dinner here. Joining us   at our table is a chef/friend.First of all the waitress warned us that we would need to order at least 3 courses to fill up - I never eat three courses, and none of the mains were of interest to me (I am vegetarian and the only veg. main was a grain bowl). So we ordered a few apps, I ordered the cauliflower veloute  and a pasta that I was told was tossed with tomatoes, shelling beans and hot oil. Others were more adventurous. The Burratta was tasteless. the Frico di Patate was delicious, the Sott'olio was mushy ""summer"" veggies - it's November. My soup, once I ate the pickled beets and pistachios on top, tasted of milk, just warm milk. No hint of any cauliflower.My pasta was a serving of less the 3/4 of a cup. It was a mash of stewed tomatoes, beans and was so salty, that although I was hungry I could not finish and forced myself to drink tons of water. The chicken/pork dish ordered left it's diner starving, and for the price that is not okay. Most dishes looked pretty on the plate but the portions were tiny and the prices were high. The service was attentive but condescending. The room is very nice, but I am so tired of restaurants offering ""tiny plate dining"" at full plate prices.

3.0,5/27/2017,"3.5 stars.  The service was good with one big misstep (see below).  Food was pretty good, but I'm not sure I'll be back soon.4 of us came to dinner at the taverna portion (which is the more causal part) and we shared a bunch of items for the table, ordered 2-3 drinks each and the bill without tip came to around $100 each, which seemed right based on what we ordered, though portions were very small.We shared:Meat and cheese - the meat and cheese board with an order of olives, was my favorite thing we ordered. We ordered three of each and the bread (they had gluten bread for my boyfriend) was very good and my favorite cheese was Trilluim - SO good. I didn't try any of the meats but they looked delicious as well and others enjoyed them very much.Arancino - My friends and I each got an Arancino (they're fried so my boyfriend skipped this one), and this was probably my second favorite thing we got. It basically tastes like a mac and cheese fried ball.Peppers - we ordered the pepper and tuna fish, I skipped this but the rest of the table seemed to like it.Crostini Sicilian - this was too salty for me, but the ricotta cheese was very good. Probably my least favorite thing we ordered.Crostini with lobster - my boyfriend got this on gluten free toast and said it was very good.Buratta - they were really good with gluten free until we got the buratta and there was toast on the plate touching the cheese, we mentioned it to the server and he used HIS HANDS to move the bread to the side and said okay there that good? First of all, my boyfriend has celiac so that doesn't work, second of all did you really just touch my food in front of me???? To top it off, he concluded don't worry I'll sell this to someone else... huh you'll what?? Other than that the server made really good recommendations so I think this was just a flustered lapse of judgment but still NOT ok.Beet salad - I love beets and goat cheese so very much enjoyed this but it wasn't that much on the plate.Shrimp - this had a nice kick and the chick peas were delicious, but they only give you 2 shrimp.Cauliflower gratin - very cheesy and tasty. They left off the breadcrumbs to make it gluten free.Chocolate dessert - SO good and rich.I'll give this place another chance in the future but will wait for them to work out a few kinks first.",1,1,1,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634

Gratin, especially, tasted like the cook had forgotten to season it.

Service was fine, but certainly not the type of service you'd get at any place that hopes to win any awards.

3.0,5/9/2017,"KenScale: 7.5/10""Perhaps you would like to start out your meal with some burrata?"" After we ordered all of our dishes, the server, seemingly innocuously, asked our party. We responded, ""Sure, why not?"" What no one realized was that the burrata came with caviar and bottarga, with a price tag of whopping $60. For a relatively small pile of burrata with caviar, we were paying for almost one person's share of a meal at an upscale restaurant. The feeling that you somehow got the raw end of the deal was the prevailing theme of our dining experience at Italienne when my wife Jun and I met up with a friend visiting from out of town. The dinner at Italienne, which opened last fall under the helm of chef Jared Sippel (who was supposed to lead the Manhattan outpost of acclaimed Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare until he decided to split as the project kept getting delayed), featured a good mix of French and Italian-influenced dishes that at the end turned out to be less than satisfactory. Italienne is divided between the dining room at the back and a tavern area at the front. When the restaurant first opened, the dining room exclusively served four-course tasting menus at $98 per person. When we headed over, that option was gone and instead there were a la carte options and six-course tasting menus at $140 per person. Given that we were a party of three, we opted for a la carte thinking we would have opportunities to sample more dishes at cheaper price. What didn't occur to us is that the portion was a major issue at the restaurant and the price wasn't exactly on the affordable side. Each appetizer ran at $18 per dish, and yet it was hard to find anything memorable about the tiny beef striploin carpaccio with asparagus. The sweetbread with Dijon and English pea was just as forgettable. How about pastas, each of which the restaurant charged $25? Again, I don't understand how the kitchen measures portion size, but it almost seemed like they were just teasing the diners with a little bit of taste without bringing total satisfaction. Still, I had to give a thumbs up to the tajarin with red wine beef ragu and English pea that was quite rich and delicious with great balance of flavor and firmness of noodles that was just right for me. Pappardelle with snail ragout and prosciutto was also serviceable. For main dishes, each charged at $35, I seriously wondered whether these dishes were meant to be appetizers. Loup de mer of Mediterranean sea bass was nicely cooked, but it should've been double the size it was served at for that price, and the four story poularde of milk fed chicken and crayfish was so tiny that we honestly didn't know what justified the price tag for a dish that didn't use some magic ingredients or awe-inspiring techniques. For desserts, I still keep thinking about the delightful fraises des bois consisting of olive oil gelato and strawberry pate de fruit, while granite of roasted rhubarb was solid but not overly impressive. Getting a reservation doesn't seem too hard, and the dining room was not overly packed on a Friday evening. There is full bar at Italienne with French- and Italian-centric wine selections (at least there were some reasonably priced wines here!). The dining room has a somewhat odd vibe (neither a fine dining destination nor a casual neighborhood restaurant) that didn't appeal to me when I stepped in. Later that night, about two hours after we finished the desserts, Jun started complaining that she is hungry again, although as she recently picked her wedding dress, she said she will refrain from late night snacking. Ah, the power of wedding dress! In any event, Italienne has some promise but at this point it is an incomplete project. The kitchen could start with showing more generosity in portion size.",7,2,5,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

5.0,2/20/2017,"I've read good things about Italienne and thought I would give it shot. I was really intrigued how they were merging French with Italian. Something different is good in my opinion. My wife and I are big fans of tasting menus and Italienne's was moderately priced (as tasting menus can really get up there in price). Before we stepped inside, doors were opened for us and we were greeted with smiles. Restaurant is split into 2 parts, the front tavern bar area (more casual) and the back room (more upscale). Back portion of the restaurant is where the tasting menu is served. Very intimate setting, warm and nicely decorated with distressed mirrors which actually made me think they were windows. Decor is not intimidating or stuffy and makes you feel welcome. Sat down and we were poured a complimentary glass of wine to start the evening. Kudos to the attention to service. Before I finish this review. Let me be clear, the staff is INCREDIBLY friendly and attentive. Every single person was beyond amazing. If you care about service like I do, then you will find the restaurant staff to be top notch. Bravo. On to the food:PROSCIUTTO SAN DANIELE DOP: Aged for 36 months and melted in my mouth. Not all Prosciutto is the same folks and they nailed it.OLIVE HANGING BREAD: F#@% that was delicious. CARNE CRUDA: almond, coriander flower & pine bud syrup from the dolomites: A salad, but a very highly elevated salad. PESCE CRUDO: scottish sea trout, taggiasca olive & dill:  Fantastic flavors and the fish melted in my mouth. MACARONCELLO housemade pork sausage, celery & montasio: I actually told the waiter if I could have 3 more bowls of this. Pork was fantastic and again was just perfectly done. Slightly too salty but really no issues.BIGOLI rabbit ragu with lentil & mustard green: My wife loved it, but I was too fixated on my MACARONCELLO. FAZIO FARM DUCK TRIS tarbais bean, cipollini & root vegetable: My wife was really impressed on how well done the duck was. Very tender. POULARDE milk fed chicken, foie gras, cranberry & chestnut: Anything with foie gras on the menu I will eat and it did not disappoint. Sometimes foie gras is too stiff, this was not. Really pleasant to eat, texture was fantastic and flavor was not over powering. Really great flavor combinations throughout the entire dish overall. Very impressed. I actually forgot to order the black truffles, so mid-way through I asked the waiter and he had no problems shaving those wonderful morsels of heaven all over my plate. DESSERTS: Sorry folks, one was off the menu the other was a special and I forgot what they were. However, I will say this. A lot of restaurants forget about how important dessert is and Italienne did not. We were blown away on how amazing it was. I'm guessing they recently revised that portion of the menu because looking through yelp pictures I was unable to find it. It was close your eyes and moan good and that's weird coming from a man lol. So, make sure you browse the desserts. To top it all off when the bill came we were given house made nougat. Also, fantastic. WINE:I'm a big wine guy, and they had a very good selection of both French and Italian wine...as they should because of the food menu.  Most of it is ready to drink wine and some of it is a bit young to drink right away. If thats the case make sure you decant it. Prices are also very decent given the quality. Very knowledgeable sommelier staff and EXTREMELY friendly. Overall, I'm giving it 4.2-4.5 stars because the only bad thing is that the portions are slightly smaller then normal on the fine dinning scale of haute cuisine. However I'm also guessing that's why the menu is attractively priced as it is. You really can't go wrong with eating here. We would a 1000X recommend this to any of our friends or family and we will back. Oh, and did I mention this menu is much more creative then other French restaurants such as dare I say as Le Bernardin. Yes folks I said it. Much more creative and to be honest a lot better. Take it how you want and yes I've eaten haute cuisine in France & Italy too, so I'm no rookie.NOTE: People if you're going to complain about the price of food there are 2 options. One, don't go out to eat. Two, there is this lovely thing called the internet where they give prices of things prior to visiting.

5.0,2/15/2017,"My fiancé and I dined here on Valentines Day and were blown away by the quality of the food and the service.  Immediately when we sat down at the bar, the bartender came over and politely asked what we wanted. The wine and drink selection was very unique even for New York City, where every spot tries to recreate the wheel. We opted for the prix fix option and sat in the back. The restaurant has two sections- the front is for a la carte and the back is for prix fix. We first ordered the prosciutto on the recommendation of the waitress and it was.... unreal. Very tender and soft and different from any prosciutto I've had in the states.  The rest of the menu was really incredibly executed and on par with an 11 Madison park or gramercy tavern.  Particularly the fettuccini which was better than any pasta I have had in NYC in the last year (inclusive of carbone, marea, il mulino, ai fiori). The ingredients were all very fresh and the flavors were exceptionally strong. From an unbiased perspective, I see some negative reviews below from serial negative reviewers, don't believe them... I commend the chef and management for what they have here. Thanks for the hospitality!",1,0,0,J.D. M.,"New York, NY",124,16,7

The parmesan cheese course was a nice addition before dessert and they finished us off with an amazing amaro which topped off the meal fantastically. Definitely come try this place, it was delicious.

Bf loved it, I didn't like the fried part- Grilled Gem Lettuce with Boquerones: supposed to be like a Caesar salad, but better. Thumbs up for originality!- Spaghetti dish with tomato sauce and basil: al dente, liked, but I'm not a real fan of pasta- Roasted custard dessert: loved this one, kind of like a cheesecake with maraschino cherries- Pan Perdu: bread pudding made with choco almond croissants from their bakery.

3.0,1/28/2017,"There have been a couple new spots that have opened up on this block, and after reading a little bit about Italienne's background, we decided to come here and have dinner with some friends on a Friday night. The space has that nice airy feel that a Flatiron spot can have with the high ceilings, and the rustic mirrors and wooden slats overhead make you feel removed from the city around you. The service overall was very good, with drinks brought out quickly, wine glasses always kept filled, and food brought out at a reasonable pace. The beer menu (even though I didn't have any) was solid, and the wines were decent as well. The cocktail menu is interesting, although I wasn't impressed that some items were very similar in execution (e.g. two fizzes with seltzer and egg whites were listed at the top).You can order the food a la carte, or as a tasting menu. That said, everything a la carte is the same in each section ($18 for appetizers, $29 for pasta, and $45 for mains); with a 4-course tasting at $98, you basically save $9 on dessert...not necessarily a huge difference, nor are you tasting more than you would otherwise. As such, the food starts off from the disadvantage of definitively being on the more expensive side. Nonetheless, given we had 6 people, we ordered the entire menu - partially for the fun of it (never have done that anywhere before), but as we would have ended up with almost the entire menu anyways, we figured it was a good way for us to get to sample everything. Of the beginning bites, the 3-year aged salumi was probably my favorite - there is light yet intense flavor to each bite, and the butter served with it gives each bite a nice creaminess. The sweetbreads were quite solid (usually not a fan), and the veloute in particular had a very rich flavor - a nice, homey soup to start the meal off with. The salad and trout crudo were solid, but not really sure they warranted the price.From there, we went to the pastas, and here there was definitely more of a mixed reaction. The green tagliolini was excellent - the spinach-infused pasta and the mushrooms made for an excellent earthy combo - and the bigoli with rabbit ragu was delicious as well, in large part because the pasta done al dente, and that texture, combined with the gamey flavor of the sauce, was a perfect pairing. One of the pastas, though, had poppy seeds in the sauce, which made for a strange flavor profile and did not fit very well. The cjalson was a bit on the bland side, and with only two large pieces, it definitely did not feel like it was worth the money.Onto the mains - and at $45 (and $105 for the ribeye), only the steak, at the supplemental price, was arguably worth the money. Even though the steak is cooked in a wooden box and surrounded with rosemary (it smelled amazing when they brought it out and showed us prior to preparing it for serving), most of the meat away from the surface of the steak was substantially undercooked. I'm not a big fan of rare red meat, but one of the drawbacks is that is simply started lacking any flavor...it hadn't been exposed enough to really draw out the age from the steak. The pieces that were more cooked, though, were excellent. The chicken dish (aside from being small) also didn't really stick out from a flavoring perspective, and the foie was one of the blandest I can recall having. Both of the seafood courses were delicious (with the scallop and lobster with truffle coming out on top), but again - easy to blanche at what you are paying given the portions. We then finished up with a few desserts, which was arguably the weakest part of the meal...they were all experimental to some degree, and all of them were way too salty. The mille-feiulle was a promising start - I really enjoyed the shaved 'truffle' (which is chocolate shavings), but the chocolate cream was extremely dense and didn't match up well with the rest of the dish. The torta was also on the salty side, and while I liked the texture of the toasted rice creme anglaise, adding herbs into what was a fine finish to the meal was unnecessary overkill and left a lot of the dessert uneaten by the table.In all: I'd be interested in coming back to eat only specific items on the menu; there's not enough consistency across the board to have faith that you will have a uniformly positive experience. The service is fantastic, and the ambiance is excellent, but with inconsistent flavors and pricing that is difficult to justify by any reasonable metric (the salumi was good, but $36 for it? I can get a package from Eataly with the same, if not more quantity, and close enough in quality for $30 less around the corner), I probably wouldn't make myself a regular here, even though it's extremely close to home.

5.0,1/19/2017,"I took my parents here when they came to visit last weekend and we had a WONDERFUL time at Italienne. To be frank, I don't even like eating at Italian restaurants for the most part. I think that the food is so simple that I find it hard to justify the cost of going to them. Especially when I find the food to be so simple and chefs can be so unimaginative. That was NOT the case here! The mix of Southern French cuisine as well as Northern Italian food was both creative and delicious. The meal in the Taverna from start to finish the meal was perfect. The service was impeccable. Amy, the sommelier, was knowledgeable, sweet and didn't have a pretentious bone in her body. Our server was so energetic and had perfect timing. I also love when I ask a server ""whats your favorite thing on the menu?"" or ""what do you recommend?"" they actually give me an answer. None of this ""oh, I like everything"" bull. As far as the food goes, the chicken liver crostini was to die for and we shared a mushroom and sausage pizzette that was so good my dad actually exclaimed ""OMG you have GOT to try this!"" when he took the first bite. I had a duck that was probably one of the best preparations of duck I have ever eaten. The fat was beautifully rendered, the skin was crispy and it was served on top of a farro and bitter greens that perfectly cut through the richness of the duck. For dessert we tried one of each of the three options and our favorite was the citrus dessert which was bright and lightly sweet.

Bread was great. Prosciutto some of the best I've had. The cheese was fine.2. Bigoli pasta with anchovy and olive oil type sauce. Pasta was perfect texture. Sauce, fancy ingredients notwithstanding, was basically olive oil. Not particularly exciting. I love and appreciate a perfectly textured pasta, but it was over $90 without drinks, so I was hoping for something more interesting that pasta with olive oil.3. Shrimp and polenta. The three shrimp were PERFECTLY cooked- really amazing. Unfortunately there was a combination of VINEGAR and CHOCOLATE sauce all over the rest of the dish. This was totally gross and the smell overwhelmed everything. I eat all kinds of food, I'm open to all kinds of combinations, but the sweetness of the chocolate sauce (think hershey's chocolate syrup) with a highly intense vinegar (like white vinegar) was pretty bad.4. Tiramisu. They made one of the best tiramisus that I've ever had (awesome texture too)- except it seemed to have an enormous amount of salt in it (whether it was actual salt or the particular dark chocolate powder they used, I don't know).

The Prix-Fixe: -------------------------------THE BEGINNINGS: The *Salade d'autumne puts a refreshing spin on dense ingredients (foie gras, potato) , while the *Veloute transforms butternut squash into liquid velvet. Like really sexy leggings. Only its soup. Get the soup.-------------------------------GRAINS: An absolute highlight. People rave indiscriminately about handmade pasta. Mandating that everyone try Italienne would end the poppycockery once and for all. The *Fusarioi doesn't sound riveting (pork 'n' beans, pepper... are we in the trenches?) but it is UNREAL. Ignore intuition and listen to me, because like all Internet strangers, I have your best interest at heart. Really, it's stunning. *Egg Fettuccine: This melange of meaty, crispy, creamy, and nutty flavors swirled around thick noodles brought a tear to my eye and a fire to my heart upon considering the ubiquity of fettuccine alfredo. This is the fettuccine we deserve.*Triangoli Verdi: These gamey guinea hen & foie gras-filled ""green triangles"" were visually stimulating and highly unique, but not as balanced. Clearly, I'm feeling like a brat because this is all so good.-------------------------------LAND + SEA: *Loup De Mer (aka European Sea Bass) is light yet satisfying, complimented by a myriad of sunchokes done up in fun ways. The heavier *Duck Tagliata has too much going on to recall without a reference sheet, but a good rule of thumb is that it's incredible. Some things are sweet, others are spicy, most are duck.-------------------------------DESSERT: *Entremet stole the show. Crispy chocolate gives way to frozen mousse filled with a nutty liquid center... Ferrero gone wild. The *Tarte Tatin is a akin to a highly evolved palate cleanser, while the *Ile Flottante is a rice crispy treat out of a Dali (a melted sea, a floating puff, some invisible crisps.) DRINKS: Henri's Apertif + Working Class Hero were both sweet, aromatic, and leaned towards intensity. I'd order these before/after food, in future. -------------------------------This is one of those spots that makes me want to revisit old reviews and knock 'em all down a star.

Pasta (all handmade pasta) Trofie Monte and mare - amazing pasta and a good mix of truffle and a little citrus taste on the mushroom Triangoli Verdi - ravioli with guinea hen and foie Gras. Flavorful Land and Sea Fazio duck tagliata - I can't say GOOD enough! Every piece of duck was done to a perfect medium rare with the farro taking in all the duck flavor. Did I mention the amazing artichoke? I have never had artichoke like that! Very moist and salted. Last but not least, the foie gras. Omg deliciousness! Pork - I only tried a piece of the pork but man it was good. Crispy skin and not too over cooked. Dessert Entremet - basically a huge Ferraro but smooth mousse on the inside. YummmTarte tatin - not my thing and very sour. Overall, amazing food, great service. Today is the first day that they opened for reservations and so they are not crazy busy yet. Come before you need to fight for seats!",4,0,0,Crystal Y.,"Flushing, NY",199,465,864
