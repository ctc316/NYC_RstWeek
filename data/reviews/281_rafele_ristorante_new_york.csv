5.0,4/28/2019,Great food! Lovely location. I tasted the gnocchi my wife had ordered and it was probably the best I've had! The lamb raging was great as well as the gnocco fritto!,0,0,0,Ruben G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",23,8,1
5.0,4/18/2019,"Nice place. A lovely location in the West Village a few miles outside Midtown. This is Italian cooking at it's best. Restaurent is lively and there's a wide choice of starters and main courses with all the usual favourites. The fish main, the pasta course and the cheesecake all 10/10. Our service was also great.",0,0,0,Ella A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",57,12,9
3.0,4/3/2019,"Not a bad spot but wasn't great either in my personal opinion!Had a reservation and upon arriving decided to sit by the bar. The place is really cozy and cute and the hostess & bartender were welcoming. It could be that I just ordered the wrong things on the menu. I am typically the one who would go for a pasta dish, but decided to try their branzino. I felt that it tasted a bit fishy and bland. Also tried two of their red wine selections and they weren't the best. My friend got their Spaghetti Schizzetto and enjoyed her meal.We also shared the Insalata Riccia and it was delicious! I would be open to trying again and getting something different from the menu.",0,0,0,Hannah J.,"SUNNYSIDE, NY",144,82,73

And on top of all that, the food was amazing!  Every element: the cocktails, the apps, the entrees, the dessert and the service!  We loved it and we will be back.

5.0,2/19/2019,"An amazing Italian restaurant! While visiting NYC we were looking for an authentic experience. Rafael exceeded our expectations. The restaurant is cozy and still accommodated our large group. We all ordered different dinner items and each of us thought it was the best Italian we've had. I had the gnocchi and oh my it was delicious. To top it all off you must try the cheesecake! The smoothest, most incredible cheesecake I have had tried.

3.0,1/8/2019,"Not a bad spot but not quite right either.  We came here for lunch on a Friday and it was fairly quiet (but also pouring rain outside).  As a group of 4, we tasted a few dishes and most of them were pretty good. Highly recommend the fried artichoke and fritto misto appetizers, and our friend really enjoyed the cavatelli dish.  My wife had the bolognese which she found OK, and I got the fusilloni cacio e pepe which was a bust sorry to say (I'm still searching for my favorite in the city). Service was quick but absent (although waters were properly refilled).

I dont write reviews unless it was horrible and they did nothing to fix it, or unless it was perfect in every way. Rafele is perfect in every way possible.

From the appetizers (get the Romeo's Favorite), to the Pork Cheek pasta (my favorite) and to the most amazing award winning Italian cheesecake, Rafele Ristorante is truly a magical place. The staff there is SO attentive and they take care of everything before you even ask. Tomasso was topping our wine glasses off before we could even think of it, and even gave us a few extra splashes.

Food was okay (mediocre Italian at best), but i have to say do not here because of the horrible customer service. came in here on a sunday night and unfortunately got who i can only assume was the manager on duty as our waitress (woman with short black hair). she was more concerned with chatting with friends than taking our order. so much so, that two separate waiters needed to remind her to come by our table and take our order/bring our food/deliver our check. completely ignored us like we didn't matter. standing at the table next to us talking to people she knew for TWENTY minutes before she even asked us for our order. absolutely horrendous. for these prices go somewhere else where you are treated like the paying customer you are. i've lived in manhattan for my entire life and never received such poor service.

5.0,11/4/2018,"We made a reservation for dinner on a Saturday night and this place did not disappoint! We asked about the chef's tasting menu and definitely left with the biggest food babies we've ever had. We started off with the Burrata, then oysters/meatballs, then were given the Ravioli Di Spinaci and then the main course of scallops and Tagliata Di Manzo with some Cavolfiore. To end the night we were given the AHMAZING cheesecake. Do not leave this place without ordering a slice of their cheesecake, it will be the best cheesecake you'll ever taste. Our waitress Christina was very helpful and accommodating when we told her some dietary restrictions when it came to the tasting menu and it was executed perfectly. Will definitely be coming back with friends and family. The atmosphere was upbeat and personable, you could tell people were regulars at this establishment and that all are welcome.

3.0,10/9/2018,"Restaurant is overrated.  Tried to book a table for 2 at 6.45 p.m. on a Friday through Open Table.  There was nothing available until 9 p.m.  Called restaurant at 5 p.m. Hostess put me on hold and told me there was nothing available but she would try to find me a table.  After waiting for a minute. She said she could accommodate. When we got there, the restaurant has two entrances.  One entrance on the left has a chain put just a foot from the ground. There was no sign anywhere to say that was not an entrance.  I tripped and fell.  There were two tables of customers right by that entrance and both said that happens a lot to many other patrons. I complained to the hostess and her only comment was, ""you should have seen the chain.""  Really???  They are begging for a law suit.  I complained to the manager and suggested that they should put a sign there so customers don't trip over the chain.  She did not even say thank you for the suggestion.  We were at restaurant from 6.45 until 8.  There were plenty of empty tables for two.  Wonder why it was so difficult to get a reservation.  One other thing was about the bread plate.  We were sitting near the bread plate prep bench.  The server was using hands to remove bread from a larger basket to put to the plates and then using his hands to wrap the bread to keep them on the plate.  I would have prefer the server use thongs instead of hands or server should have had gloves on.  On menu, one appetizer says crab cakes ... I asked how many cakes.  Server said 2 but then when dish came it was just 1 crab cake.  I complained to no avail.  Pasta was okay.  Overrated ... there is much room for improvement.  Don't think I will go there again.  Restaurant is not customer focused.",0,0,0,Lisa P.,"Rancho Santa Fe, CA",0,15,0
3.0,9/21/2018,"Took advantage of the nice weather by stopping by here on a Wednesday evening. Both inside and outside seating with plenty of tables available. Took a little while to get seated, but immediately got menus as we sat down.No happy hour to speak of, but each table gets a free basket of oven baked bread (and vegetable medley for dipping). Excellent starter as the bread is crisp yet soft, and the veggies add a bit of sweetness. To drink, settled on a glass of the Montecucco ($12); a heavy red that's best to sip on. Oddly, the wine was served cold while also inside a chilled glass, which didn't seem correct though not enough to make a fuss. For food, split the Ravioli Spinachi ($19) and Gnocchi Pignatiello ($18). Pastas are delivered to the table within 15 minutes; realized soon enough that the ravioli was lukewarm while the gnocchi was piping hot. Both dishes are swimming in a semi-sweet tomato sauce, as the gnocchi also has a nice melted buffalo mozzarella on top. Ravioli contains a mixture of spinach and cheese that was also lukewarm at best. Service is a bit up and down; took a while for someone to acknowledge we needed a table, fast table service, then almost 20 minutes to receive the check. Pasta is fine, depending how long the food was sitting out.",3,1,3,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",289,1569,1552
2.0,9/15/2018,"Came in with high expectations for this restaurant after the Yelp reviews & a recommendation from a friend but ended up being disappointed. To recap:- Glass of wine {12} : Wine pour was small.- Stuffed zucchini blossom special {$15} : Advertised to make you think you were getting all blossoms when in reality you were only served 3 blossoms and also served plain, in-need-of-salt, fried zucchini slices that were not stuffed.- Spaghetti alla chitarra was served in a soup of oil. For $18.00. - Chicken dish cost $27 and wasn't served with a side. It was just a piece of chicken with a garnish of four little french fry sized carrot strands.The only good thing was the bread basket - toasted bread and warm pieces of focaccia. We didn't bother with dessert.FYI - If you are a party of 2 and dining inside be aware that those tables are on top of one another, so you are basically dining at the same table with other strangers.",1,0,0,Christina C.,"New York, NY",26,55,127

4.0,7/6/2018,"Rafele Ristorante is a quaint neighborhood gem, a rustic escape from the bustle of the city.  A friend chose this place for a reunion dinner, and while we waited for her to show up, they kindly sat us, and provided complimentary bread while keeping our glasses full. We waited for a half an hour before deciding that the hostess really wasn't going to show up and resigned ourselves to dropping from a group of five to a small group of four.  At no time whatsoever did the waiter complain that we hadn't ordered yet, and jovially kept refilling our glasses. Complimentary bread - I usually try to resist, but this was still warm from the oven and I had to enjoy a few pieces with the sweet caponata.Burrata starter with asparagus and prosciutto - pretty standard, but the table enjoyed this.Squash blossom and zucchini starter: creamy and fried, could have done with just a tiny bit more sodium.Taglioni Ai Funghi: with mixed mushrooms, truffle paté , Grana Padano - hearty and al dente, as mushroom lovers, we very much enjoyed this.Pappardelle Lamb Ragu: Slowly braised lamb ragu, rosemary, garlic, thyme, Kalamata olives, Sangiovese wine - this was the highlight of the evening, we loved every bite of this.While the food didn't awe us, the meal was definitely still worth a visit, and the stellar service and atmosphere would definitely have us returning again.",0,0,1,Jennifer C.,"Flushing, NY",74,100,429

However, I think it was more of a case of this being a neighborhood sort of joint that doesn't get bogged down with tons and tons of tourists.My friend and I both ordered the taglioni with mushrooms, which was very good. The pasta was perfectly al dente and I loved the overflow of mushrooms on my plate. To me, there is no such thing as too many mushrooms. The portions were very large, I ended up taking more than half home.Good service, water was always full, and bread basket at the start is always a plus to me.Would come back if I was in the neighborhood!",2,1,1,Sylvia B.,"Manhattan, NY",161,315,831

We received 6 ""zucchini flowers"". Except 4 of the 6 ""flowers"" were just plain fried zucchini, not even stuffed with mozz. The 2 actual flowers were very tasty, but we felt cheated. Maybe they ran out and were thinking we wouldn't notice?We also received bread with eggplant caponata. The caponata was sweet and reminded me of the caponata I made in a cooking class in Sicily. For our main courses, we ordered gnocchi and branzino. Both were O.K., but definitely nothing to write home about. The gnocchi was gummy and chewy.

2.0,5/20/2018,"I'm not sure how we even ended up here.  Sometimes Saturday nights in NYC without a reservation will do that to you.  Still, I am always hopeful we'll find that neighborhood Italian restaurant, the one that feels like your home away from home, where all your carb cravings are satisfied.  Sadly, Rafele will not be that place.  The room was loud, but not deafening.  The music was festive.  The crowd was an interesting mix of locals, tourists and Italians (from Italy, speaking the language).  They sat us at a table in the middle of the aisle, clearly added to increase the numbers they could seat.  After 15 customers and many waiters banged into us while trying to pass, we had to ask to be reseated.  They were nice enough about it, but why try to pawn that table off on us in the first place?  Then we just sat at our new table - no water, no bread, no waiter, for far too long.  The waiter finally came and stayed just long enough for us to order a negroni.  Then more waiting.  I was getting murderous with hunger.  The hostess/manager/owner? must have seen my unhappiness and came and took our order.  Good hot bread eventually arrived, with a sweetish caponata.  Then our apps came, but the bottle of wine we ordered lagged behind.  So the service wasn't great.How about the food?  Nothing was offensive.  Nothing was really great, either.  The arancini were a little mushy and should have been served with a little sauce for dipping.  The fried calamari could have been crunchier.  The meatballs were okay.  The cauliflower with currants and pine nuts was tasty but a little oily - I can make it better myself at home.  The gnocchi were the gummy variety and the sauce lacked oomph.  And finally, we ordered the roast chicken and they brought us pork Milanese, which we ate uncomplainingly even though it was a thick, heavily breaded affair, and what is supposed to make Milanese so special is the thinness of the meat and the delicate crumb coating.  Humph.  We did not get dessert.  So, overall, not the worst experience I've ever had, but I couldn't recommend Rafele to a friend and I can't imagine myself ever going back, even if I end up reservation-less on a Saturday.",1,0,0,Jessica D.,"New York, NY",4,158,0

The service was prompt, but I took away one out of the five stars, only because I didn't feel that anyone on staff was overly nice or friendly, and that was a bit of a turn-off for me. Again, it was a busy Friday night, so maybe they were pressed. But I didn't feel it was a wonderful dining experience - service without a smile.",1,0,0,Anima P.,"Queens, NY",2,29,5

5.0,3/11/2018,"Checked yelp reviews before choosing this restaurant. Seemed to have very rave reviews and lived up to my expectations.  Brought my future in laws who are Italian so just a little pressure here!!Nice basket of bread with a chunky eggplant dish brought to table when we sat down and more just kept coming and coming. Fried calamari, margherita pizza , and Fried artichokes with shaved cheese were appetizers. All very good. Pizza was especially good. I was told by the men that the N Y strip steaks were tender and nicely seasoned. Spinach filled ravioli I understand was outstanding. Very Home made taste. My Pettole ragu with lamb was amazing. Perfectly cooked pasta , tender pieces of lamb and wonderful sauce. The Italian cheesecake was amazing. The ricotta cheese seemed like it was whipped. The smoothest Italian cheesecake I've ever had.

However, the restaurant seems a little understaffed so things did take a little longer. FOOD: The apps were fantastic as well as the pasta. We ordered the gnocco fritto and the Rafele pizza. The gnocco fritto was a combination of fried dough (similar to a zeppoli) and proscuitto. The gnocchi was fantastic with the buffala mozzarella.  Melted in your mouth. To finish we ordered cheesecake and the tiramisu. Both so good-- but the tiramisu was the winner of the two. Will definitely have to go again. The restaurant week menu also is great!

3.0,1/30/2018,"We were so excited to come here for Restaurant Week on a Monday night. Sadly, our experience here was just okay - not bad, but nothing quite special either. A plus, I must say is that the portions are very generous. In addition to our restaurant week menu, we ordered another appetizer, which we definitely should not have gotten, since it all turned out to be a lot of food! Sadly, some of the apps were a bit of a let down - the calamari was a bit bland and rubbery, the Bianca pizza was just okay - tasted like cheese and artichoke on a flatbread. The gnocco fritto was pretty good - the prosciutto was delicate and flavorful on a pillow of doughy, fried goodness. One thing that was also really nice of our server was how he told us that we could get more of the gnocco if we ordered that as our separate appetizer, and the other 2 as our restaurant week appetizers, which he didn't have to let us know. He was also very attentive at first, making sure to fill our water and check in with us throughout our appetizer and entree. However towards the end of our meal, we noticed that the service definitely dropped off, and we felt like we had to constantly haggle the servers just to order our dessert and get boxes and the check. We also noticed that the waiter was a bit rude to the hostess, grabbing the phone from her and getting frustrated at her over something. It was a bit awkward since it was so out in the open.Moving back to the food, we got the schizzetto and gnocchi alla sorrentina for our entrees. The gnocchi was soft and cheesy, and the schizzetto had a generous portion of seafood, albeit slightly over cooked pasta . However, both dishes didn't really have anything special flavor or texture-wise. We were really hoping to be wowed by the food considering the great reviews on yelp.All in all, it was a filling dinner, but for the price and reviews, I had expected much more from both the food and service.",3,1,1,Cindy L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",166,24,110
5.0,1/27/2018,"We came for Restaurant Week dinner and are captivated with the quality of food.Our reservation quickly got us seated. And the staff is attentive, waters were present and our questions were answered.Tomasso attended our table initially and we are stoked he did. He was exceptionally helpful letting us know about the serving sizes, difference between dishes, plus recommendations for the table. Also he informed us, the serving sizes are mostly the same between the RW and regular menu. (There are some smaller apps, so do ask) Tomasso is stellar and moreso later in the evening.For apps, Gnocco Fritto, Romeo's Favorite, Arancini, grilled octopus, Rafele pizza, and Terrina di mare were ordered. Goodness, the Rafele and Gnocco Fritto stood out with the flavor. The GF prosciutto on fried dough is a fantastic combo whereas the Rafele dough was chewy and combined splendidly with the cheese and prosciutto. Most of the apps were hefty enough for the table.For entrees, it was all pastas and they were great. The lamb ragú was very tender and didn't have any gamey flavor. (Forgot the other dishes names). All in all, ample pasta serving with delightful flavor.To cap it all, for dessert, we ordered the cheesecake, panna cotta, tiramisu, and a ice cream-cake combination. The cheesecake is so light and smooth. The tiramisu was so balanced and coffee liquer wasn't soaking the bottom. These two were very large in serving.Back to Tomasso, he actually stepped aside to handle a party downstairs but made sure to check on us at the end of the evening. Once again, proving his fantastic attention to service.We are all big fans of Rafele and are eager to return to try the other dishes.",1,0,0,Kenny L.,"New York, NY",125,307,294
4.0,1/26/2018,"Came here for restaurant week 2018 in January with a girlfriend on a Thursday night at 8pm. We arrived a little late but were still seated promptly. Instantly flooded with Uber Italian authenticity vibes. Although it was my first time here, instantly felt a sense of being at home!We opted for the restaurant week dinner menu, which was surprisingly expansive. There had to be ~15-20 apps to choose from and another 10 or so entrees with a solid 6-8 desserts. Props for variety!! We started off with a glass of wine each. Malbec for my friend and Chianti for me. 5 pieces (3 saucy, 2 normal) of complimentary bread with a chunky eggplant pepper onion caponata were served while we waited to order. Awesome crunchy outside of the bread and super soft spongy inside. The saucy bread was a tad disappointing but whatevs. Ya win some ya lose some.My friend ordered the Arancini to start (4-5 balls) with a side of tomato sauce (she asked for it) and I got the grilled octopus on top of fennel. She enjoyed the Arancini but I didn't taste so can't comment on flavor flav. The grilled octopus was tender and had a great charcoal taste. There was a bit too much funnel underneath though. The kalamata olives were an interesting addition to the dish but the saltiness paired really well with the octopus. For entrees, my friend got a classic spaghetti in a tomato sauce with burrata. I got the tagliatelle so funghi. Portions were very generous and easily could have been two meals but what psychopath packs up fresh pasta??!! The funghi pasta had truffle accents in it as well so the smell was as decadent as the taste. For dessert, we were already pretty full but decided to taste a few bites of the cheesecake (supposedly top 10 in the nation) and a hazelnut dish. The hazelnut was just as our waitress described...mix of cake and gelato texture! The Cheesecake was lighter/had more air in it than normal but still super creamy. Awesome food and great vibes. The only downside was the slowwww service. Dinner was over 2 hrs for two. We weren't in a rush so it was fine but the waitress wasn't very attentive. Will cut her some slack as she may have been the only server in the restaurant aside from the servers coming directly from the kitchen. She spent a good amount of time flirting at the bar lol",2,0,0,Alexandra T.,"Jersey City, NJ",353,407,326
2.0,1/22/2018,"I was very excited to try the food at this restaurant because the reviews were so good. We got dinner on a Thursday night, and I ordered the spinach ravioli. To be honest, it was one of the most bland dishes I have ever had in my life. The spinach on the inside felt as if it was out of a can. The sauce on top was missing flavor. This wasn't just me, all our dishes including the gnochi and truffle pasta were equally as bland. The truffle pasta probably tasted the best within what we ordered but it was just okay at best. The only good thing about this restaurant was the wine selection. Honestly, nothing spectacular, wouldn't go back.",2,0,0,Jay G.,"West Babylon, NY",81,103,219

It was cold that day so there was no way I was eating outside. So after we declined, we noticed there was bar seating so we asked to sit at the bar. After a bit of staring at the computer, she said okay fine. So after we were seated at the bar, the bartender took our order. The food and drinks were decent, but I was not feeling the vibe from the snooty hostess and the loud patrons of the restaurant. I decided to give this restaurant another chance, and came here with reservation this time for a family dinner. When we arrived, the table was not ready, so we had to wait for them to set up the table.

4.0,1/21/2018,"With a city as large, diverse and innovative as New York City, I am always hesitant to declare a restaurant as having the best of something. From appetizers to desert and drinks in between, every meal at a new restaurant offers the opportunity to improve on the old classics and bring something new to the table (both metaphorically and literally). However, having said all that and at the risk of violating my own internal code, I feel absolutely certain that Rafele's has the absolute best meatballs in Manhattan, if not all of New York City. Having stopped in for a lite bite, we decided to split the meatballs as well as a margarite pizza. Putting the pizza to the side for a moment, I want to focus on the meatballs. As the name suggests, a meatball is comprised of 2 key elements: meat and balls. Although the meatballs were the creme de la crem, and the pizza was a quality companion, the overall dining experience left a bit to be desired. Although it was a Tuesday in the early evening, and there were only 2 other small tables full, service was very spotty. While we didn't need a personal waiter hovering at the table, some check ins during the meal would have been appreciated. Perhaps we just came on an off night, and service is better at other times. Given how delicious the meatballs were, I'm sure I'll be back at to find out!",3,1,2,Edward M.,"Manhattan, NY",209,259,1991

I ordered the lamb ragu with papadelle pasta and he ordered the steak with some veggie sides. And we ordered some crispy Brussels sprouts too. Everything was delicious, including the bread with eggplant they give you at the beginning of your meal.

My wife and I also tried to split the schiacciata (aka ""Romeo's favorite"") ($15) a pizza sandwich w/ arugula, proscutto, mozzarella, olive oil, and chili flakes. This was incredible but really meant to split between more than two people, four would have been more appropriate for this appetizer.

4.0,12/23/2017,"We made a reservation (30 minutes ahead of time) for a weeknight on a Tuesday, but really we didn't need to do that upon seeing how many tables there were at the restaurant. The Christmas decor inside was so cute! All the trees were lit up on the outside, and the decor was incredibly... classy, not just a few nutcrackers or cheesy posters hanging around. The service was mediocre, I'd say. It took awhile for the waiter to come around, so by the time he had arrived to ask about drinks we were ready to order food. The appetizers came out before the drinks were brought out... what?The arancini was a little salty, but very tasty. We also had the melanzana (I'm not big on eggplant) and the mozzarella. I was disappointed to not see any burrata on the menu, especially after seeing someone who had ordered a fried burrata dish. The mozzarella was okay..... just not the same as burrata, the flavor is so much more mild and bland. The temperatures kind of threw me off, it came with roasted peppers which were lukewarm -- I'd prefer them to either be piping hot or cold, especially when the mozzarella was already lukewarm. This kind of turned me off from the dish and had me imagining that it had just been sitting out for awhile. For dinner, my sister and her friend split a margherita pizza, and I had ordered the tagliolini al funghi. The flavor of the pasta was absolutely delicious, clearly had some homemade noodles (cooked al dente). My only issue with it is that it was a tad oily, after I had finished the dish there was a pool of oil sitting in the bowl.I probably wouldn't come back, just because I think you could probably find better Italian in NYC and there's so many other places to try.",3,0,0,Katie Y.,"San Francisco, CA",389,382,1075

3.0,8/19/2017,"Rafele Ristorante was just alright. I wanted to try this place because they had a very big selection for RW summer 2017. When we arrived at the restaurant at 6:30 on Friday, there were a good amount of empty tables. However, the hostess wanted to squeeze us right next to another couple when I clearly saw 2 other empty tables for a party of two. So we requested to sit somewhere less cramped and she said that it was all reserved. Umm ok?? You can't sit us at another empty table for two because those specific tables were ""reserved""?? Those guests weren't even there! Surely, we could have sat somewhere less crowded since we arrived first but no, you want us to be right on top of another table. Ok that makes a lot of sense.We ordered the terrina di mare and polpo alla griglia to start. One thing that's great about this place is the the amount of food you get and the delicious bread basket (which they don't refill). The shrimp in the terrina di mare was kind of overcooked and the mussels were tinyyyy. The bread was also too burnt for my liking. Overall flavor was not bad. Our plate had 3 large pieces of octopus which was cooked perfectly but could have been seasoned better. For the entrees we got the zuppa di pesce and the special, wild striped bass. The presentation of the zuppa was cool. The bread covering the dish was cut open at the table. However, the flavors of the dish were unimpressive. Once again, the mussels were very small. The wild striped bass came with shishito peppers that were a little too mushy, artichokes, some leafy greens, pesto sauce and a little too much oil. The bass wasn't cooked evenly throughout. Some parts were overcooked while the center was more on point. I probably wouldn't get seafood if I come back nor would I recommend it.For dessert we got the lavender panna cotta and the tiramisu. Both were delicious although I liked the tiramisu better. Service was great in the beginning. However, our server disappeared towards the end of the meal and no one really checked on us to see if we needed anything else. Our water was filled as soon as we were running low but I had to wave someone down to order another cocktail. The place was busy but not THAT busy.  I would come back only to try the pastas as they have such rave reviews but wouldn't get the seafood entrees again as they were quite unmemorable, and very pricey had it not been restaurant week. Oh, another gripe about this place. The servers that passed behind me kept hitting my chair during my meal, and never apologized.

4.0,7/25/2017,"Now this is what you call an authentic Italian restaurant. It was slam packed on a Monday night, inside and outside. Me and my friend ordered a few different things to share. We had the grilled octopus (polpo) which was so tender. Then we had the zuppa di mare which was excellent and the fritto misto which was a mix of fried calamari, shrimp, fennel and zucchini. It was fried to perfection, not too heavy. The service was very friendly. They gave us an Italian Cheesecake on the house as they told us it was rated the top 10 Italian cheesecake in the U.S. and let me tell you it was nothing short of amazing, never tasted any other cheesecake like it. And on top of that, a glass of limoncello to go with it. Minus one star because the portions could have been a little bigger, but this is the city so not too surprised. Great outdoor seating on a calm street.",0,0,0,Virginia M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,16,27
5.0,7/24/2017,"What am amazing dining and life experience! This place is full of great food options and passionate people, like Tomasso, that know and understand the menu and how each option works well together. My journey started with a beautifully paired combination of a whiskey based drink to go with my mixed mushroom and gorgonzola pizza. Honestly, I'm terribly with names of dishes, but if you ask for Tomasso, he will point you in the right direction always!  I followed the pizza with a wonderful pork chop paired with a red.  Again, Tomasso and the rest know the specifics. I never had a pork chip like that in my life.  You conclude my night I enjoyed a beautiful and gentle dessert of Semifredo. Go figure, I'd remember the name of the dessert. Again, this was a wonderful suggestion from Tomasso. No regrets!Coming to Rafele was like taking a journey through an Italian market filed with different delicacies and delights and I thank Tomasso for guiding my girlfriend and I through this journey. Although, I had Tomasso as my waiter, I can assure you that any other waiter here will deliver excellent service, as the couple next top our table was delivered unique and also very passionate service that was tailored to their likes and dislikes.

A tip: you won't see it on the menu, but if you ask, they'll do a tastings.  That's all we ever do.

They gave us a table downstairs with two other large parties and it ended up being one big party downstairs. Everyone became friends and we were all sharing each other's wine! One of my faves when I come is the Frutti Di Mare Inzinio (seafood bouillabaisse stew). It's amaaaaaaaaazing! It comes in a bowl with a cracker shell over it. Once you crack it, there's this great seafood soup with lots of seafood and it comes with toasted bread. I usually eat all the seafood ( mussels, clams, scallops, fish,etc) and sop up the remaining soup with my bread! Everything else on the menu is good! From the pastas to the specials.

5.0,6/15/2017,"Go! Just GO! And so affordable, with such nice service in such a nice restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. This place is 5 stars all the way for me. I came here for a group dinner and was unfortunately getting a sore throat, but even being sick, the meal blew me away.First off, the service was superb. They were so attentive, so friendly and social in just the perfect amount, not overbearing but provided great insight on what's good and what's great. I started off the with Paid Time Off which was citrusy and fresh.  We also received complimentary warm pizza bread and regular bread. The pizza bread was awesome. Had to get two baskets. Then the food arrived!Gnocco Fritto - easy to split between 4 people. AMAZING. A must get if you like fried dough and prosciutto. The fried gnocco was crisp on the outside, chewy and hot on the inside. The prosciutto provided the flavor of soft, melty, salty meat. Loved it. I should have ordered two plates!!Caprese - you can't go wrong with buffalo mozzarella. It was fresh, soft, ooey-gooey. It came with some peppers that were spiccccy. Provided a good amount of surprise heat that normally doesn't come with a caprese. Burrata - Similar to the caprese but more simple. Just the burrata, basil and tomato with some EVOO. Simple, classic.Tagliolini ai funghi - Truffley for sure! This is more of an oil-based sauce pasta with plenty of mushrooms in it. The pasta was plentiful and cooked perfectly al dente. You can tell that all the pastas are freshly made which is the number 1 thing I look for in any legit Italian restaurant. For the price and quantity, the pasta dishes are so worth it. I tried a couple of the other pasta dishes and all were just so fresh and well-flavored. LOVED IT. Ricotta cheesecake - OMG OMG OMG. We weren't going to get it because we were so full after our delicious pastas but the waiter highly highly highly advised it. This cheesecake is reputable across the nation and he talked us into it. Sure, why not? I am sure it will be good. NO! IT WAS AMAZING!! I have never tasted a cheesecake like this. It was the creamiest cheesecake I have ever tasted and the ricotta elevated it to top notch. Have you ever seen the episode in FRIENDS where Chandler and Rachel steal cheesecake from a neighbor and end up eating cheesecake off the floor because it was just too good? That was what popped into my head when I took my first bite. This is the type of cheesecake I would steal and eat off the floor if I had to. Do not pass on this cheesecake! Trust me. Overall, everything was so good. I have to go back. I will go back. Pasta, cheese and three slices of ricotta cheesecake please and thank you!",29,14,24,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",888,585,2091
5.0,6/13/2017,"Our dinner at Rafele was as good as any of the eight we had during a recent visit to NYC.  Over the years, we've sampled at least 15 Italian restaurants in Lower Manhattan.  This is one of the few that warrants a sequel. If we lived in the West Village, then we'd be regulars.  The room is a little cramped (big surprise in this neighborhood) and the noise level is fairly high, but these minor inconveniences are offset by the friendly, helpful service and, of course, the food. Two of us shared Pappardelle Wild Boat Ragu.  The pasta was perfectly cooked and had great texture.  Coupled with the deep, earthy, rich flavor of the meat, this dish was a winner -- one that I would order again in a heartbeat.  Meanwhile, the Spaghetti Alla Napoletana scored nearly as high with the savory combination of tuna, anchovies, garlic, and pepperoncino.  Yum.  Crispy brussels sprouts were a fine accompaniment.  Also appreciated was the complementary bread and ratatouille.  If you are obsessing about which Italian restaurant to try in the Village, then stop reading reviews and go to Rafele.",1,0,0,Mark W.,"Eugene, OR",4,53,0

We came when it was still super cold in New York and had a reservation before. They didn't have one of those wind protection things behind the door so if you sat by by the door you would always have the cold breeze at you. Unfortunately I was one of those people that sat by the door so I would always have a cold breeze on me which was super annoying because I was also close to the kitchen so it was hot. A no win temperature situation for me but the food will make me warm! Hopefully, right? Refele has a looooong list of wines and my boyfriend and I opted for a red since we were eating pasta with meat. I ordered the ravioli di spinaci ($17). I love a good ravioli and this one was filled with spinach, buffalo ricotta, house tomato sauce, basil. The portion I thought could have been bigger. I usually don't eat that much anyways and usually have leftovers but with this I ate it all up! It was really delicious and I would order it again. My boyfriend opted for the pappardelle wild boar rage (19). This came ragu, rosemary, garlic, thyme, and Sangiovese wine. My boyfriend enjoyed his meal and finished it but he wasn't really wowed by it. I really liked Rafele and would probably come back.

We lingered a bit long and were mildly suggested we wrap up after we paid - but just a suggestion, which we took seriously as others were waiting.I was glad to see families with kids - always a good predictor of a neighborhood gem. The appetizers were very good - pizza fritta (perfectly hot, right out of the fryer) and the caprese was very good also. Note it comes with a quite hot pepper, so if that's not for you, you might order otherwise. Other apps at other tables looked good also and everyone looked to be enjoying their food. Entrees were very good: gnocchi, taglioline with mushrooms and a hint of truffle, pasta with pork cheek, and pappardelle with wild boar ragu.

For the main course I got the branzino and it was perfection. Branzino was light and cooked perfectly. I also tried the spinach ravioli and the chicken parm and I couldn't even understand how he got a chicken breast to be that flavorful and such a good texture, but they were both delicious too. One dish I saw that was going around  was a seafood stew or soup baked inside a bread bowl! Since I'm def coming back here I will for sure try that, it just looked so good. I had to put the cheesecake in its own category because it is probably the best cheesecake I've ever had, which is saying a lot. It's so light and creamy, I believe he makes it with Buffalo ricotta.

5.0,12/31/2016,"Awesome service, food, ambience, and staff.  We had a party of 16 including kids and teenagers so I was expecting the worst and hoping for the best ensuring the wheels don't fall off the night keeping the entire family in line in a public place.  I was so impressed with the private room Rafele had for big parties.  It was amazing, the waitress and her team of assistants were sharp, friendly and extremely efficient.  The night was a dinner celebration for our daughter's sixteen birthday and it was a very memorable night thanks to the entire crew of Rafele.  The quality of the food was great, no heavy seasoning or thick bland sauces in this place.  Flavor of the food was unique and very comforting.  We were able to bring our own cake to sing happy birthday for our daughter.  We made same day reservations to this place and they were very accommodating to our needs.  Rafele Ristorante is great and I highly recommend this establishment for those who appreciate great service and quality food, they will exceed you expectations.",0,0,0,Eddie C.,"New York, NY",160,6,1
5.0,12/16/2016,"SO impressed with my recent meal and Rafele after I made last minute group rezzies based on my super-Italian hairdressers recommendation. Full disclosure: I was tipsy/borderline drunk this entire meal (santacon) but trust me, the food was good no matter your state of sobriety and corkage is a standard $25 but they have a great wine list of their own.I was dining with a group of 7 so we started out with a few shareable appetizers before moving onto the main course. Standouts included the fried pizza, arancini and fried artichokes (these literally taste like In and Out fries). Looking back now, everything I enjoyed was friend but there wasn't anything I didn't enjoy. The whole meal you can see the head chef orchestrating his authentic Italian dishes in the kitchen and after a table debate, I even had him settle weather pork cheeks were from the face or the rear (it's face people!!).I ordered the chicken for my man dish - tender and full of flavor. The chicken comes with braised veggies on the side that soak up all the yummy juices. I would recommend splitting a pasta dish and a meat dish so you can try it all!In the end I couldn't squeeze room for dessert but I hear the cheesecake is the chef's specialty, so I'll have to give it a try next time I return. High quality Italian with an elegant but homey ambiance, perfect for a nice dinner out with family and friends!",10,7,6,Taylor H.,"New York, NY",367,154,1253
5.0,12/4/2016,"Came here with my parents for a holiday dinner, surprisingly spacious restaurant for the area! At first they seated us at a two person table and brought over an extra chair which was a little ridiculous, once we asked to be reseated they moved us to a four person table (yay)Their appetizers / sides are amazing. We had the roasted cauliflower, brussel sprouts and calamari to start and everything was done really well. My whole family hates cauliflower but we LOVED the way this one was cooked and seasoned. The brussel sprouts were covered in parmesan cheese and also amazing. The calamari came out in thick crispy pieces and had some fried zucchini alongside it as well.My favorite dish overall was the pappardelle with a boar bolognese sauce. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the meat was tender, so so so great.

5.0,10/22/2016,"Came back again to Rafele Ristorante this weekend. Same superb service! The staff is soo welcoming here. On this night I order the Paccheri alla Amatriciana, which is pasta served with guanciale and pecorino cheese sauteed in oil and then with added fresh tomato. Guanciale for those of you who don't already know is taken from the cheek of a pig. Its a very fatty portion of meat, but don't worry once you sauteed it, the fat melts and is actually useful in becoming part of the sauce itself. Once the guanciale is cooked, you pull it out and set it aside in a bowl. You then de-glaze the pan with a little white wine, add in fresh tomato, and let that cook down until the sauce thickens. After the sauce is the right texture, you add back the guanciale, then toss in the cooked pasta in the pan with the sauce and quickly add in the pecorino cheese.  Toss the pasta really well so the cheese melts in with the pasta, guanciale and sauce.Yes I realized that I just turned this review into a cooking show, but trust me this is exactly how or almost exactly how they made it, and they did an excellent job!I once again requested for their special Vegetable Cannellini Bean soup.  Its a big, hearty bowl of soup that is surprisingly rich in flavor. I was very full from from both the soup and the pasta, and I didn't want to eat anything else too heavy, so I just ordered the Vanilla Gelato for dessert.",13,5,8,Eric A.,"Brooklyn, NY",505,274,1594

As well , I had a pasta dish forgot the name it was clams and scallops in a light herb and sun kissed tomato sauce that made me feel like I was walking in Napoli on a early morning smelling the fresh ocean the dish completely beat up my palate in ways a lot of chefs try and fail not at this place tho and then I had the special of lamb over polenta with crispy pork belly on top the combo sounded weird but when I ate it it tastes like an Italian holiday the lamb was not gamy and the pork was just the stronger tasting meat how he accomplished that alone is insane I would say if I had to pick a place for my last restaurant meal before my death I would pick Rafael's",0,0,0,John Z.,"New York, NY",4,38,58
2.0,10/5/2016,"My fabulous Doctor sister was celebrating her 30th Golden birthday with family and friends. We had reservations for 30 Guests. Upon entering the restaurant ,I handed the waiter the 30 custom Gourmet cupcakes that were a surprise for the birthday girl. They informed us they had a fridge where they place guests cakes so we asked them to hold onto it until dessert . After we ate our appetizers and dinner, we asked them to bring our cupcakes that the waiters placed in their back fridge . To my Dismay, cupcakes were visibly missing! I immediately informed the manager and was highly upset that someone of their staff chose to steal cupcakes for a special event. Considering that the restaurant appears classy and upscale in terms of food, Me nor my exclusive guests would highly recommend this place to anyone. Manager apologized and asked his staff who blatantly lied and said they didn't know. My guests and I, including the birthday girl, demanded that they inform their staff that we had accounted 30 cupcakes before arrival to this restaurant . Despite the staff of thieves, my family and friends enjoyed the rest of our dining . However, We don't plan on creating more memories with a ""business"" that lacks ethics and professionalism.

2.0,10/2/2016,"This was a restaurant that we had been introduced to on our Greenwich Village Food Tour (which was a fabulous tour, by the way) and really liked the ambiance as well as the tasting we were given on the tour.  Our amazing tour guide had recommended we go back to enjoy the tasting menu for two and we agreed it would be great to try again. We took the train the second night back just to eat here.  When we called to make reservations, the hostess stated they were having horrible internet issues but to come in without a reservation. When we got there, she was very accommodating and seated us outside and once we were given water by the hostess, were forgotten for 30 minutes, even when the server checked in on the couple sitting behind us---no one came by to ask us for a drink order, nothing for a looooong time.  Finally, the gentleman that may have been the manager, owner--not certain-- came to our table and we decided to instead order various dishes off the menu to share, try, and enjoy with a nice bottle of wine. My friend mentioned, ""I thought you forgot about us?"" and he responded, ""This is the worst night of my life. Our internet is down.""  That was an interesting response.  Up until that point we had told one another that we would leave if no one would show up in the next 10 minutes. After we received our appetizer, we were again forgotten for a LONG period of time before we ordered dinner. Upon finishing dinner, we were again left alone for over 30 minutes.  Not once did our water get refilled or dishes removed from the table even after the server finally came by.  We finally had to get up to request for our bill inside the restaurant and pay the hostess before leaving because we were getting tired of waiting and wanted to get home.

The roasted cauliflower and octopus starters were to be missed. Super bland. I was really disappointed because they sounded great and other reviews seemed to rave about them. The spaghetti schizzetto was pretty good and the ravioli was also so-so. They have an extensive menu so maybe other dishes are better.

As such, the complimentary focaccia and the eggplant caponato that accompanied it were a nice start to the meal. Everything on the menu tempted my date and I, but we settled on the Fritto Misto for our appetizer. It was a very generous portion, enough for 2-4 people to share. I wish it had more roasted eggplant and fennel, as that aspect of it was delicious and felt a little lighter! The calamari was perfectly breaded and crispy. I also ordered the roasted cauliflower with pine nuts and raisins, which turned into my favorite dish of the night. For my main meal, I ordered the Galletto Arrosto, roasted chicken with carrots and roasted fennel. Some parts of the chicken were a bit odd looking, but I absolutely loved the roasted eggplant and carrots. We ordered the fried brussels sprouts as a side dish as well, which were ok but pretty much your standard brussels. Overall, I loved the ambiance here and would love try one of their pastas!

Most of the places I wanted were cash only places so that was a no go for her, I found this old bookmark from several years ago and figured why not. After having come back from Mexico with still an upset stomach and bland food options I knew a bowl of pasta would be the only thing to cure me even if it were a risk. Our server was lovely and knowledge regarding the wine and service was great across the board.Food wise- we ordered the pulpo to share. Nice generous size. The bread basket didn't do it for me and it seemed a bit stale and I'm not a fan of eggplant caponata that they give but maybe others will enjoy it.I knew right away I'd want a plain sauce to not risking more bathroom trips and no cheese. I'm a sucker for paccherri so asked if they could just serve it in a simple tomato sauce and they were happy to oblige. I wish I could have added cheese. Cheese would have made it. My friend ordered the seafood pasta which was garlicky and delicious. She weighs all of 100 lbs and hardly ever finishes her food but wiped her plate clean.

The meatballs were incredible, probably the best meatballs I've ever had. I wish they were bigger because I wanted more when they were gone! My ravioli was very good, I miss the simplicity of the dish. It's such a classic and when it's done right, it's perfection.

1.0,6/26/2016,"I went to this restaurant with a small group yesterday and it was terrible. We specifically picked Rafele because they have a separate vegan ""menu"" (it's a separate sheet of paper with vegan dishes as well as gluten free animal product dishes) and me and my friend ordered from that menu. When my dish arrived, which was the pizza frita, it looked a little different than how I expected and I took a cautionary bite into it. Yep, cheese. The pizza frita has two ingredients listed: tomato and basil. I asked my friend who is non-vegan to try my dish and he confirmed that there was indeed dairy on the pizza. After a while I finally flagged down my waiter (he was not interested at all in our table) and inquired about my plate. He literally shrugged his shoulders and said, ""I said vegan, it's vegan, I told them vegan."" And then he walked away! Are you serious? You don't know why I asked for a non-dairy dish, what if I had a dairy allergy? (Of course since it's been years since I ate dairy, I did get sick later from just the small amount that I consumed.) The waiter should have at least looked at my plate, or tried to identify just what exactly I was eating. But he didn't. He just walked away and didn't care at all. That is absolutely inexcusable. For a restaurant to have a vegan menu and then not even oblige by it is ridiculous! I spent 12 dollars plus tax and tip on what... my glasses of water? Of course since we were a 6 person group the gratuity was included automatically, which probably explains why our water was inattentive and totally dismissive of my complaint. But I'm not surprised our waiter was clueless; earlier in the meal, we asked someone what the ingredients were in the bread to make sure there was no dairy in it, and the server didn't even know. Really? Unbelievable. Everyone at my table was so turned off by the experience that I doubt any of us will return again. None of us had eaten there before, and it's too bad because the restaurant looks very nice. But what a shame that the service is terrible.",1,0,0,Rachel B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,13,0

5.0,6/16/2016,"I have to say, of all the places I tried in New York during my week long trip, this restaurant completely stood out from the rest.  From the attention at the door the minute we walked in, to the exquisite taste of the food, to the amiable environment and service, this place truly provided me with 5 star service and I will return time and time again.  My girlfriend and I made reservations for 2, which turned out to be a good idea seeing as it was full.  We were seated at the bar and poured two glasses of water while we waited for our table.  Though the staff seemed to be busy, their whole system seemed incredibly efficient.  We were seated in no time, given a menu, and found the two sparkling wines we had ordered earlier waiting for us.  I was captivated by the attention I received.  It wasn't one of just customer service, it was more of a 'welcome to our home guest, we are excited to share our food with you.'  We were given bread with a small eggplant dish to top the bread with.  I don't normally enjoy eggplant, but I could eat this for the rest of my life.  I was so excited with the flavors that I decided to order a variety of items in an attempt to try it all. We had the Calamari, the Polpettine, and the Gnocchi Alla Sorrentina; and we did our best to keep it classy as we stuffed or freakin' faces until every last drop of sauce was cleaned from the plates.  I was in heaven.  The waiters would come around and refill our glasses at the perfect times, they would offer help and engage in slight conversation.  We learned how to correctly pronounce knawee.  The gnocchi, by the way, was our of this world and the veal meatball was the perfect compliment.  When all we had was sauce left we dipped the calamari and bread into the dishes to soak everything up.  The food is so good and the place so inviting it is no wonder there are regulars here. The chef/owner would come out every so often and say hello to someone.  He would sit down grab a drink with them and converse.  His hospitality and amicable nature truly comes out in the cooking.  Truly an amazing experience.",0,0,0,Christian E.,"Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA",124,24,23
2.0,6/12/2016,"I'm super confused about the incredible ratings on this place. It's a step above the ""Italian"" restaurants in Little Italy, but that's not saying much. Even just around the corner in the Village there are so many better Italian places. Sure, Rafele is cute, and there's a nice patio (though of course the subway is right underneath and rumbling every few minutes), but the food and service are lacking. It's in our neighborhood and we watch Chopped - so we really, really wanted to like it - but we will not be back.To start off, our waiter was rude, and actually scoffed at me when I misunderstood something on the menu. Didn't set a great tone, but we moved on. They bring out some delicious bread and eggplant spread that we thought was excellent, and the wine came out quickly. The grilled octopus appetizer was pretty solid - not the best I've ever had, but cooked well. Things seemed to be looking up.Unfortunately, the rest of the meal was nothing special at all. My ravioli di spinaci entree, described as ""house made pasta with spinach & buffalo ricotta, with roasted tomato and basil"", consisted of six ravioli laid flat on a plate with a tiny smattering of a very bland tomato sauce on the top. They were a bit too al dente as well, and didn't have much stuffing. Mr. F had the spaghetti with mixed seafood - which is a frequent order for him - and he said it was really underwhelming. Prices are not too bad for Manhattan, but it's still not worth it.Overall, a really disappointing dining experience.",0,2,0,Lisa F.,"Brooklyn, NY",85,91,29

4.0,5/28/2016,"A charming Napoli-inspired restaurant nestled in the West Village, Rafele serves wonderful, authentic southern Italian cuisine. Its open kitchen concept creates a welcoming, family-like atmosphere, and every detail, down to the weekly flower arrangements, is carefully selected in order to complement this feeling.At 6:00 on a Saturday night, the restaurant was pretty empty, which initially concerned me. My slight skepticism of the high Yelp reviews was quickly replaced with awe the moment I took my first bite of ravioli di spinaci. This was honestly some of the best pasta I've ever eaten. The fact that it's homemade makes it even better. The ravioli are stuffed with spinach, naturally, as well as buffalo ricotta cheese. Roasted tomato and basil are incorporated into the sauce, but the tomatoes also act as a standalone ingredient, positioned around the plate to provide a bolder flavor.Without a doubt, the filling of the ravioli is the dish's winning aspect. The spinach carried a significant presence, and most importantly, wasn't overpowered by the buffalo ricotta. Light, but tremendously satisfying, the ravioli were gone a few short minutes after they were placed on our table. Sadly, this means that I didn't have the chance to take a picture! Yes, they were that good.It seems like pasta is Rafele's strong suit, as my boyfriend ordered the pappardelle, and similarly praised the dish. Before we even finished our food, we were already discussing our next visit! Needless to say, we can't wait to go back.",1,0,0,Daniela L.,"New York, NY",374,155,37

Two things; either Mr.Gold is served something ( VERY) different from the rest of us, or his golden days are long passed by. Starters: fried artichokes... These were very soft, very greasy... Bref... No good. Pizza Funghi e Gorgo. Quiet decent, dough a bit too chewy, but all in all an O.K. dish ( not amazing, ok...)Pasta: we ordered some spaghetti tomato, basil and buffalo ricotta. This is a simple dish that I always order in Italian restaurants, because that's how you understand if the cook is really amazing or not. It is very basic pasta, but if well executed can be orgasmic! Well... This one... I had heart attack on! Pasta totally overcooked (???!!!).In addition they put some kind of pork fat or pork broth in the sauce (?????????!!!!!!!! Not even stated in the menu) that nobody in Italy would ever even dream to put in this kind of dish. The result was a rancid sweetish aftertaste.We also had a dry grilled seafood dish ( the gamberoni were good though) and a super nice ricotta cheesecake ( this was truly delicious).Their espresso was another disaster.I give 2 stars instead of 1 because the service is literally stellar ( everyone was so sweet and nice and truly tried hard!) and because the range price is not in the high level, so you cannot really expect the very best.",1,1,0,Anna G.,"Garland, TX",0,10,1

5.0,1/24/2016,"We should have stopped at the appetizers! But there's no ""6 Star"" rating so I'll continue with the review. That ""6th"" star would have definitely been gained by the Zuppa di Pesce, a flavorful fish stew served with an oven baked bread dome. It was unbelievably good and still stirs my taste buds as I write this. Yes you've read about it in all the reviews but do yourself a favor and try it!We were able to make a 6:30pm reservation for four on a busy convention crowd night and were accommodated when we had to change our reservation to 8:00 pm. The turnover in the place is quite quick and perhaps that's the magic in having one (less than highly intimate) big room for the entire restaurant. Visiting Rafele is all about the food and while the bar and chef's tables are nice alternatives to the main dining room, you will be best entertained when there is food at your table.The Appetizers are incredible to say the least. Yes the Meatballs are heavenly and are the first real challenger to my Mother's recipe. Rafele's meatballs are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside with the proper balance of pork and veal and a nice tomato dipping sauce. The Arancini were excellent and the Pizza Rafele with Prosciutto and Arugula disappeared within minutes of being delivered! And after devouring the 3 appetizers, we could have had maybe one more and dessert and we would have been happy. The Zuppa di Pesce, one of my favorite dishes anywhere (also known as Cioppino and Bouillabaisse), was presented with a crusty bread dome made of pizza dough that was perfect for dipping and keepin the flavors locked inside. The presentation and taste were definitely incredible and one of the best preparations anywhere.....extra points for creativity. And again, we should have stopped there. The Tagliata for Two and the Pacceri All' Amatrician pasta could have been better with the beef being more on the rare side than the requested Medium Rare and the pasta being too ""al dente"" for a pasta tube the size of roll of dollars. However these are things that are easily corrected after a first visit. If there is some consistency, which I imagine there has to be, I would order the beef 'medium' and go for the pastas with smaller noodles.The Italian style cheesecake and the tiramisu were also awesome as was the espresso. We were served by Piero, one of the partners....an authentic Roman with little emotion to spare. It was all business while the meal was being served and a lot lighter once we were done.

5.0,1/18/2016,"I was watching Chopped on Food Network a couple of weeks ago and caught Raffaele Ronca squeak out the victory.  At that same time a group of eight friends were trying to organize a dinner, so I booked Rafele.  It did not disappoint.The restaurant is one big open room including a bar and open kitchen.  It isn't the most intimate restaurant, but it makes up for it with an equally desirable liveliness.  We got wedged into the very far corner, which was probably good given our size and drinking habits.  We ended up sharing a bunch of items to kick off the meal and everything was better than good.  The fried artichoke was my favorite, but really you can't go wrong with much on this menu.  Most of us opted for pasta for the main course; I had the spinach ravioli and it was solid.  My only complaint is that they offer pre-grated Parmesan when freshly grated would be more in-line with the overall experience.What made the meal most special was the hospitality of our waitress and the chef.  Raffaele came out and was touching tables during the evening and spent a good ten minutes chatting with our group.  He is a genuine guy and it made the experience feel more authentic.  He also sent some desserts and dessert wine our way on the house, which was unnecessary but appreciated.I definitely will be back to Rafele and I think all eight of us agreed it was a great experience.",3,0,1,Tyler L.,"Manhattan, NY",251,523,1

5.0,1/11/2016,"This place was incredible. I was in town for business this weekend, and my colleague and I were looking for some Italian food on the West side of the Village near our hotel.  Decided that I liked the reviews on here, and gave it a shot.  WOW and I glad we did.  The entire experience was tremendous. The service was phenomenal, and the food was perfect.  I loved the fresh  eggplant spread they serve with the bread.  We both got salads. I had the Rughetta salad (Arugula with fennel, pancetta, aged balsamic& shaved Parmigiano Reggiano) which was as fresh as can be, and perfectly dressed (lightly) so the flavors of all the ingredients shine through. It's rare that I am that impressed by such a simple salad.        The Calamari was also stellar. Very tender and perfectly cooked with a very light breading. The addition of the Fennel and Zucchini was original and complimented it well. For the entrée I ordered the PACCHERI ALL' AMATRICIANA (which at only $17 was a great deal).  If you haven't had smoked guanciale before, you should try it. YUM.  Pasta was cooked al dente, and the flavors were spot on.  They were out of the Chianti we ordered, so the waiter came back with another, more expensive one at the same price for us. It was phenominal and we got two bottles. Lastly- the Ricotta cheese cake was one of the most delicate and creamy versions I have had. Top notch.

5.0,12/22/2015,"Eating at Rafele was a delightful experience. My mom and I went and did a chef's tasting menu after having eaten an appetizer there a few days earlier (the melanzane - so delicious). They asked us if there was anything we didn't eat (she eats everything, and I don't eat red meat or pork) and came up with a delectable 4 course meal for us. Our first course included several different appetizers: arancini, fried artichokes, mini pizzas, and mussels. The arancini melted in my mouth. The dough on the pizzas was delicious. The fried artichokes were crispy and flavorful, and the mussels were to die for. The second course included spinach ravioli and noodles with mushrooms and truffles, both of which were amazing. The third course was the best roasted chicken I've ever eaten, along with a really interesting cauliflower salad that I could not get enough of. The final course was a generous slice of ricotta cheesecake - so fluffy and scrumptious. I'm pretty sure I've never been so full, but the lovely Super Tuscan helped everything go down smoothly. The service was incredible. Although I didn't see Chef Raffaele that night, I had the pleasure of meeting him at my previous dining experience there, and he was absolutely charming and welcoming, and it was so fun to watch him work.

I spoke with the manager that I wished to cancel the reservation as I felt very discouraged, as the night was that important to me. He promised that the dining experience was going to be great. So I stayed. A BIG MISTAKE.The food was not good. Arancini was good. Nothing special with grilled octopus, even though the accompanying grilled fennel was soggy and miserable. The recommended cauliflower, ""the best"" per manager, was not good at all. Lacking flavors, some burnt pieces, texture not right. Wine was good, but expensive.Bread was dry and simply not good, got weird edges, and the eggplant dish was too sugary. Pasta was awful. We tried ragu with lamb and spinach ravioli. The tomato sauce was thick and acidic. Just straight out of can tomatoes cooked up with no flavor. I did not taste any lamb - they were just many bits of chunky brown meat. Pasta was too stiff. Gummy. We did not even consider having desserts as we were so disappointed about the quality of food, and I do not think the loss of reservation was properly addressed and compensated. It was a pure waste of money and time. And my very important evening was ruined. I will not recommend this place to anyone.

The eggplant dipping sauce was definitely a surprise and provided a phenomenal start.  For appetizers we ordered the meatballs and fried artichokes.  The meatballs were outrageously delicious and are a must order for anybody who visits.  They had been cooked to perfection and had a nice crusty exterior but were tender and soft in the middle.  For mains my wife had the sun dried tomato gnocchi and I had the mushroom pasta.  Both dishes were delicious.  The gnocchi was pillow soft and melted in your mouth and the mushroom pasta was a great medley of different seasonal mushrooms.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and have added this place to a short list of solid Italian eateries.,0,0,0,Justin S.,"Jersey City, NJ",20,44,17

The arancini balls were okay but the calamari was a must for anyone who enjoys a light coated and fried calamari with the tentacles. The insalata de finocchio was fresh and the paccheri pasta dish was reaaaaalllly good; absolutely recommend. We ordered the cheesecake and the chocolate pudding. The cheesecake was not set; it was literally melting on our plate and the server kept insisting that it was ""fresh"" - i.e. It didn't have time to cool and set duh! We returned that dish which was super disappointing because I was looking forward to it. The chocolate pudding was good though it was less of a pudding and more of a mousse, delicious nonetheless.I definitely expect to be back to try more items!

2.0,11/6/2014,"Decided on this place based on other yelpers for my boyfriend's birthday. Meh. The food was good but nothing that knocked my socks off. We had the octopus, strip steak, squid ink linguine special, and cheesecake. We also ordered a side of spinach which they forgot and served at the end of our meal. The food prices are reasonable. Decent wine selection. I really chose this place because of the space - you actually have elbow room here. I just couldn't figure this place out. Their were locals, tourists, people looking for a casual/romantic date (like myself) and tables with families including children. Their was a couple next to us drunkenly screaming profanities throughout their entire meal. I'll be optimistic and say at least it was entertaining.As a Villager, I'd say their are so many other options nearby with similar prices that won't leave you thinking, ""I probably could have made that at home.""",4,0,1,Molly M.,"New York, NY",0,12,7
4.0,11/3/2014,"Took my wife and daughter to Rafele on a Sunday night. It's on Seventh Avenue in the West Village and is easy to get to by subway from the Port Authority or Penn Station if, like us, you're from northern NJ. We had a 6:30 reservation and by 7:00 it was packed. Quite the popular place with the locals, it would seem.We ordered a couple of starters, appetizers and pasta. The food was four to four and a half star quality. The chicken liver starter was sensational and the rice balls were perfect. My meatballs in marinara appetizer was great. As for the pasta dishes, my wife's lamb ragu was especially good as was my daughters spinach ravioli. My seafood pasta was just ""good."" We also had cheesecake for dessert, which was excellent -- rich but light.Service, however, was a bit relaxed -- I'd give it three stars. They brought us a wrong starter and by the time that was corrected we here half way through our first courses. After our main courses were served, no one came  around to ask us if everything was OK (the staff seemed to spend most of their time chatting with the regulars). We also had to speak to several servers before we could order dessert and coffee. On the positive side, the check was presented promptly once we asked for it (one of my pet peeves is that many restaurants make you wait interminably for the check).As for as the ambiance of the place, it's a bit crowded and rather noise (lots of hard, flat surfaces). But it's an open kitchen establishment, which is always fun.Our three meals, with one glass of house wine, dessert and a couple of espressos, came to just under $200 with tip.Bottom line: if you like really good Italian food and aren't especially into the ""experience,"" Rafele is a solid choice.",0,0,0,Carl M.,"Glen Ridge, NJ",0,68,3

I made all of the arrangements for the party ahead of time with Piero, who was extremely helpful and easy to coordinate with.

4.0,8/18/2014,Loved this restaurant.  It had charm we got luck parking right outside of the place and waiter was adequate.

4.0,8/8/2014,"A true Italian-style eatery. I felt very much like I was back in Rome eating here.A somewhat limited menu, but everything was wonderfully prepared, particularly the small brick-oven pizzas. They're delicious, and the perfect size to share for an appetizer.My branzino with potatoes and spinach was excellent. Incidentally, I had recently ordered the same meal prepared exactly the same way at nearby Palma, and this version was even better.Decor is charming, and there is a large, attractive outdoor cafe, too. My only negative is that the service, while very friendly and accomodating, was a bit slow. I was begging for water refills, and we had to wait about 25 minutes to receive the check at the end of the night.

My 3 girlfriends thoroughly enjoyed their pasta dishes as well. Service was attentive and quick. We were tired and dehydrated and did not order any beverages (we usually do).

4.0,7/13/2014,"I checked this place out on Yelp before I and my family ate here and the reviews are pretty much spot-on.  It's a southern Italian restaurant on 7th Avenue, ostensibly in the West Village, but on a busy avenue, so it's not a little-hole-in-the-wall romantic little niche restaurant like you'll see on small streets in the Village.  The food and service are very good.  The portions are small and diners can expect to pay about $75/person including food and a glass or two of wine.  We had the artichoke salad which was a little disappointing, the grilled octopus, which was excellent, the caprese salad, which was good but nothing unbelievable, the flounder special, which my wife liked but did not love, some kind of pasta with the Italian version of bacon, which was excellent, and the branzino, which also was excellent.Who is this restaurant for?  Not for the hipsters.  It's too straightforward.  It more likely caters to the out-of-towners, the slightly older crowd, and people with children.  That said it isn't a bad restaurant, just not someplace I would recommend for someone looking forward to an intimate place to impress a potential mate.",2,0,0,andrew s.,"Moorestown, NJ",0,11,0

4.0,6/6/2014,"I spend a lot of time in the West Village, and I was delighted to see a new dining destination open in the area.  Rafele looked simply adorable with its open kitchen and romantic candlelight.  I was even more eager to try it after hearing rave reviews from my co-workers.  I was quickly drawn to their website to review the menu and was thrilled about the reasonable prices.  I vowed to reserve a table for my next dinner out on the town.  Well, on that fateful night, I arrived in a timely fashion and check in with the host.  He was certainly not the friendliest man and instantly made me question my visit.  Luckily, my friend quickly arrived, so I was able to take a seat away from the bitter man.  My spirit was further brightened by the delivery of the bread basket.  While the Italian and focaccia with tomato and basil varieties could have been more moist, we simply adored the Mediterranean-styled eggplant salad that accompanied it.  I even ditched the bread to dip my fork directly into the stewy bowl towards the end of the meal!As per usual, this particular buddy of mine and I went crazy with our food order.  We decided to share two starters - some scallops and a pizza.  The perfectly cooked scallops were disproportionately sized, but well-seasoned.  However, they were served over smoky lentils that were overcooked and mushy.  Our thin-crust pizza was massive, providing each of us with 4 aromatic slices of decadence.  The crisp dough was sprinkled with truffle oil, hen of the woods mushrooms, and Gorgonzola cheese.  It was truly a blend of powerful flavors that surprising played well together without any sense of conquest.  Our entrees were also enjoyable.  The Spaghetti Schizzetto was blended with a mix of seafood, such as delicious scallops,  fishy clams, and fresh mussels.  The sauce strayed from the ordinary by utilizing sun golden tomatoes versus solely the standard red varieties.  The Pettole Ragu was hearty and delicious.  The housemade Neapolitan pettole pasta had been tossed with slowly roasted Colorado lamb and Kalamata olives.  A dusting of rosemary enhanced the earthiness of the dish.As delightful as the meal was, our cleared plates were immediate followed by the delivery of the check.  This would not have been a problem had it not been for our rude server that kept stopping by the table to see if we had put forth our credit cards.  Sure it was a Friday evening, and they were busy, but still, let us digest and chat for a bit!  Despite that annoyance, the affordable and creative cuisine would bring me back to Rafele.  In fact, the chunky eggplant dip might actually be influential enough to do this on its own!",1,0,0,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

The Tagliolini Al Funghi was warm with the deep earthiness in all the right ways.  We also tried the seasonal special soft shell crab over greens.

5.0,5/21/2014,"I had a private event in the room downstairs for about 20 people and it was wonderful! They have a great family style menu with plenty of food and great options. Food: The truffle pizza was amazing - you could smell the truffle from far away. The truffle pasta was also good. The seafood risotto was mostly rice and calamari, so that wasn't my favorite dish though it certainly wasn't bad. The steak with a pesto sauce was a favorite as well. The ricotta cheesecake was deceptively light and fluffy (I say deceptive because I'm sure it wasn't quite as light as it tasted!). The tiramisu was good but a bit odd - tasted more like a strawberry shortcake than tiramisu (no coffee flavor).Service: The waiters were attentive and friendly. When my friend arrived late, they arranged for a special plate of pasta and a few other menu selections from courses she had missed. It really felt like you were in Italy because they were SO nice - not the sort of service you sometimes get in NY, sadly. The host I worked with, Piero, was incredibly patient and responsive and helpful when planning the event.Venue: The private room is downstairs and very cute. The room has tomato jars along with walls with all sorts of different sauces.

5.0,3/6/2014,"The service and authenticity at Rafele are fantastic. Everyone is cheerful and very Italian which adds to the experience. They are very friendly and engage with everyone in great ways, so you feel as if you are with friends at all times here. We ordered the Margherita Pizza and the one with black olives. I'm not a black olive, or olive person, but boy what a balance in those slices of sweet marinara meshed with the sour olives. It gave the slices an incredible taste. So good. Also had the buratta with truffle oil and mushrooms and it was simply WOW. The wines are served at the perfect temperatures, and that's a HUGE thing for me since nearly 70% of all restaurants lack heavily in that department. Glasses of water are constantly filled, the servers pay you constant attention, and the look and design of the entire place is very, very nice. I'd recommend this as a date spot, or even if you're alone and just hungry, sit at the bar because you will have a very nice time. Enjoy!",2,0,0,Cyrus P.,"New York, NY",852,899,566

While waiting for my friend I had the ""29"" cocktail which was terrifically strong. Once my friend arrived we got down to business and ordered the chicken liver pate and scallop with cannellini beans and caviar special to start. Both were amazing but the pate really took the cake. I strongly suggest it. For our entrees we ordered the seafood spaghetti (spaghetti schizzetto) and the pettole ragu. Dinner was magnificent and there is nothing I would have changed.

2.0,2/23/2014,"I can't recommend Rafele. The main reason is because price to quality ration is poor and many other restaurants in the area offer way better food at this price. My experience is that Rafele is mediocre. Here are the things I liked:-A well made cocktail-Wine served at the proper temperature and in the right glass-Simple presentation of the food-Well considered and well written menuNot liked:-Food served not properly cooked and not promptly served. Arancini, what should be a delightfully lightly fried risotto dumpling with steaming, melty cheese inside was served half cooked and the cheese inside was cold. Basic stuff. Main dish, ravioli was in a moat of coagulated broth. There was a skin on the top. Plate was not hot. This is unacceptable. -Other main dishes, grilled steak and pork chop were cooked simply, but were not an improvement on what a home cook might accomplish.-The service was very outgoing and overly friendly to the point of dis-ingenuousness, much in the style of a server at TGI Fridays and many suburban American restaurants. While some people might like it, I do not prefer that kind of service.  She introduced herself by name and kept checking up to see if ""everything was OK"", interrupting our conversation repeatedly. She said she was SO happy we were there, etc. -The kitchen was not properly ventilated causing cooking smells to infuse our clothing. Even though this is not uncommon in my experience, I don't think it's ever OK, especially at $150 for two people. To be fair, I have only been to Rafele once, but I'm not sure how another visit would change the problems I experienced.",0,1,0,Jane s.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,12,0
5.0,2/22/2014,"Yelp brought me to Rafele Ristorante, and I was not disappointed. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive. We ordered the special starter of burrata with arugula and prosciutto- the creamy cheese was rich and fresh. I thought perhaps it might pair well with a harder vegetable (perhaps endive?) because the creaminess of the burrata wilted the arugula. It was tasty nonetheless. The Rafele pizza was a delicious mix of prosciutto and mozzarella, and had a rustic look to it.  I really enjoyed the hand made gnocchi- very flavorful. I'd definitely order it again. The beets ravioli was also very unique- had a slight pretty pink tinge but I was not a fan of the filling which had a bit of chestnut.

4.0,11/11/2013,"KenScale: 8.0/10Rafele is an Italian restaurant from chef Raffaele Ronca. Located on the Seventh Avenue in the West Village, I probably passed it by multiple times thinking it is just another neighborhood spot among a glut of Italian restaurants in the neighboor, but the quality of food was surprisingly good, with a lot of solid and well-executed Neopolitan dishes.I started the meal with Rafele pizza (with proscuitto, mozzarella, arugula), a solid starter. Then came pan seared veal and beef mealballs in light tomato sauce and roasted cauliflower salad with black currants, pine nuts, and breadcrumbs. Both dishes were well-executed, especially the cauliflower salad whose crunchy texture I enjoyed greatly. I shared two pastas afterward, spaghetti with mixed seafood and sun golden tomatoes and pettole pasta with Colorado lamb ragu. Both dishes were also pretty solid, with that rich flavor of rustic Italian cuisine without being overly salty (a big no-no when it comes to pastas for me). I also enjoyed the roasted organic chicken and grilled branzino. I liked the fact that branzino came without too much seasoning to allow me to savor the tenderness of the fish. For dessert, I had cheese cake, which was delicious but not amazing (I kind of wish I should've ordered more classic Italian sweets such as semifreddo). It's very easy to get a reservation at the restaurant online, but by no means was it empty when I came. The scene is pretty casual, and you can see the open kitchen and the brick oven next to it. I definitely consider Rafele better than an average Italian joint in the West Village, and do recommend it for a casual Italian dinner after strolling around SoHo or West Village.",3,1,1,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

So we decided to check it out.One of my favorite Italian appetizers is caponata which is a mixture of chopped eggplant, peppers and onions with other savory things like capers and olives. My mother always makes it when she wants to treat me special. Here they put it on every table with an assortment of breads. Rafael's caponata is the first I've ever tasted that measured up to my mother's.We also had some other appetizers that were all good including mussels, crispy artichoke hearts and arancini. My daughter really loved the arancini. She's a huge fan of strong cheese. If you are, too, don't skip the arancini.We had a late lunch and this was an early dinner so I was the only one who had an entree. I got the spaghetti schizzetto and would recommend for anyone who likes seafood.The desserts were also fantastic. The cheesecake seems to be loved by everyone who eats here and the praise is well deserved. We also had the affogato, which is vanilla gelato with a shot of espresso poured over it.

We ended up having like 6 bottles of that awesome stuff.I usually don't do this but due to the sheer amount of stuff that we got, I'm going to list out all the foods.Appetizers:Tagliere di prosciutto - its like fried bread with black label prosciutto. Now I'm not sure what black label prosciutto is but my roommate got sold on that and got it as an app. It was really awesome and I loved how the bread was warm and soft and the prosciutto was a very good topping on it. I recommend getting it!Polp alla griglia - very nicely charred octopus here and comes warm which was nice. I've had too many experiences where the octopus comes cold. I think it needs to be served immediately off the grill?Cavolfiore - not pictured but really freaking good! It's roasted cauliflower with black currants, pignoli nuts and breadcrumbs. All the ingredients blend in nicely and the breadcrumbs and nuts give the dish a nice texture Pizza:Pizza Rafele: Comes with Prosciutto, cheese, and arugula. I don't know what authentic italian pizza tastes like (i will soon since I'm going to Italy woot!) but I'd imagine this is what it's supposed to taste like. This pizza was super light and super fresh. The prosciutto tasted like it was layered on the pizza after it was baked so it wasn't dried up or anything. Definitely recommendPIzza with Broccoli rabe and sausage: Forget the name of this pizza but I wasn't as impressed with this pizza. The Broccoli rabe was a bit bitter so it just tasted weird on a pizza to me since I've never had a bitter pizza before??Pasta:ONTO THE GOOD STUFF. Because of our big group, Rafele gave our table two  complimentary pastas. The Taglioni ai funghi and Ravioli di spinaci. I actually was debating between the mushroom pasta and my actual dish, so my dilemma was pleasantly solved when they brought out this pasta on the house! Thanks Rafele!Taglioni ai funghi: Really good. Not too creamy, not too oily and there is a plethora of various wild mushrooms in there and coupled with the homemade taglioni the dish is really awesome whether you are vegetarian or not! I love meat and I'd be totally content with getting this as a main courseRavioli di spinaci: Also really good. the spinach in the ravioli was nicely cooked and the tomato sauce was really fresh. So if you are in the mood for some healthy light pasta...get this!Pettole Ragu: I had a bite of this but it was good the one bite I had. I'm looking for more exotic pasta these days but if you are a big fan of bolognese then this is a good option.Zuppa di pesce: Presentation on this was super cool! They come with this giant pot pie looking thing. Then they do some crazy slices and voila you have a bouillabaise like seafood stew that has been stewing under that crust. Very yum.Special Spinach spaghetti with seafood: not pictured and was somehow my main dish...forgot why I didn't take a picture but oh well. The noodles in this dish were super thick. I was not expecting a spaghetti to be this thick. The seafood was good but I think the pasta was a bit too thick and al dente. I probably was slightly dissapointed because I was expecting something else...but it still tasted good nonetheless. I'd recommend staying with the regular seafood spaghetti though!Wine:Get the chianti classico from castello. 2009. VERY GOOD. YOU WONT BE DISSAPPOINTED.Thanks to the staff for putting up with our huge table and for the complimentary pastas!

Too salty for my palate but not inedibly salty (that would've made it a 1 or 2 star review). I drank waaaayyyy too much water (which was very promptly refilled).

Almost all of us ordered a pasta dish (pettole ragu, tagliolini ai funghi and the daily special) - sauces were tasty but I wish there was more - I'm big on sauces on my pasta. I was disappointed at how rough in texture the pasta was. One friend was bold and ordered the pizza which was surprisingly sad looking and resembled pizza bagel bites.

2.0,6/14/2013,"I visited Rafele on a slow, rainy Thursday night.The good:  Rafele graciously took care of our group of 9, that, with last minute additions, ended up being 11.  Even starting with 4 bottles of the ""second cheapest bottle of wine on the list"" didn't give the waiter a case of the grumbles.  I had sympathy for our future waiter even before we arrived, but he was a pro and didn't need it.  The pasta dishes were a hit, as were most of the appetizers.The bad: I wanted to like everything about Rafele, but the Branzino, which I ordered, was truly a bummer.  In fact, it was potentially the worst thing I've gotten from a restaurant in New York.  The fish itself was remarkably bad...a sad, thin,  surprisingly bland piece of a usually rich fish.  The set reminded me of something you would see at a place used to a much ""older"" crowd - a couple of lemon wedges, some roasted potatoes and a pile of sauteed spinach (?).  The huge plate it came on helped dramatize the sad presentation, which left it cold within minutes.Overall, prices were on the cheap side, and it good for groups.  I would go back for the pasta dishes, but the Branzino was a clear miss.",1,0,0,Brian H.,"Washington, DC",0,9,0

2.0,6/12/2013,"We ate a Rafele and were disappointed after the reviews here. The atmosphere is nice, but not overly wonderful. The indoor is a bit loud and the outdoor is pleasant, but would benefit from a few candles or nice touches. The food was disappointing after the rave reviews. First of all, the bread (in my opinion) tells a lot about a place and when we received focaccia slices and some semolina (or similar) that were a bit stale I was worried. We ordered the octopus to start which was nice (well flavored) but not hot enough and actually seemed as if it was prepared in advance (not to order). The lamb ragu was tasty but the seafood spagetti was disappointing. A bit bland and the fish/clams were not super fresh and succulent but a bit dry. Disappointing since I SO wanted to love this place! The wines were good but a bit pricy at $14 for a pinot grigio. And the SERVICE left A LOT to be desired. It took forever for us to have our order taken and then I had to ask for bread, waited an extraordinary amount of time for my second glass of wine, and had to wave the waiter down to ask for a spoon and some salt when my main dish came. We won't be back.  Skip it and go to isodi on Christopher!",0,0,0,Joy V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0

2.0,6/9/2013,"Before getting into the review, I would like to say it takes a lot for me to be impressed with an Italian restaurant.  I just don't like spending money dining for pasta and sauce that is just plain jane. Just doesn't seem worth my money but don't get me wrong, amazing Italian food is to die for but so hard to find in my standards.  We went to Rafele  for a friend's birthday and the whole party was excited and high hopes with the great reviews and home made pasta!!  Order a few appetizers, the risotto balls were quite tasty, the ""caprese"" salad we custom ordered was decent but nothing to be blown away by.  For main course, I ordered the homemade pasta with mushroom and truffle pâté, it was nothing special.  Too much olive oil and truffle oil.  Putting tons of truffle oil on something doesn't make it better!  Some other dishes ordered were the lamb and pasta and the seafood pasta special which was all very mediocre.  Plain cooking without much richness of flavor. The fresh ingredients and mix of flavors  is what I look for in Italian food. The homemade pasta wasn't very smooth and very texturey but it was cooked al dente.  The saddest thing I saw ordered was the pizza.  Some kind of bagel bite/ digiorno concoction which was just horrible. Lack of sauce/ cheese/ and presentation. We were served complimentary risotto for the long wait of main courses, which were undercooked, but very thoughtful. The service was relatively attentive and the night was great, just wish the food was better.",1,0,0,Richard L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,11,0
2.0,5/23/2013,"A rare miss from a highly Yelp rated restaurant (ristorante?)First off - here's a tip - the outdoor seating is right above the subway... so every 4 or 5 minutes you get a nice loud treat.Anyway, service was fine if not a bit slow - not bad but I didn't get the legendary service described by others.On to the food - tried several dishes between me and the mrs, eggplant app, mutz and peppers, gluten-free (+1) seafood pasta, and strip steak.I can honestly say not one of them was noteworthy.  The best was probably the eggplant, but the red sauce was weak, the pasta while cooked properly basically only had muscles in it and lacked any sort of flavor, the mutz clearly wasn't fresh and the strip steak - while cooked properly lacked any real flavor.I guess the theme here is the execution on the food was good, but the ingredients were lacking.... which at an italian place is a big fail... its all about the ingredients.  In sum, I was disappointed and probably won't go back.",4,0,2,Greg W.,"Hoboken, NJ",283,638,5

If I had a dime for every time someone told me ""But you just had pizza yesterday"" or ""didn't you just have red sauce for your past like 6 meals?""NEVER. ENOUGH.But Rafele didn't really do it for me. The service was excellent, both from the server with a thick Italian accent and from the nice gentlemen from south-of-the-border who kept my water glass full at all times.Very friendly and efficient. Oh, and the outdoor area is very nice. But the food? meh.We started with the meatballs which were wayyyyyyyy too salty. Like 'the chef must have accidentally knocked the salt over and it spilled in the batch' salty. The server told me it was from the Parmesan cheese, but I've got news for you bro: I LOAD UP my homemade meatballs with Parmesan cheese (I measure it in cups) and they don't come out salty like this.Second, the main courses. She had the ravioli which she was expecting to be nice and light, but it tasted like a stick of butter. The sauce seriously might have been half butter. I almost wanted to take some home and re-heat it to see how much would separate. And my pesto? It was pretty good. Not great, just pretty good. I couldn't figure out what it had too much of (basil maybe?) but it had too much of something.Anyway, I think my favorite part of the meal was the bread they bring out to start. There were two very good breads including a tasty foccacia, and an interesting spread to dip it in. It was a nice change of pace from butter or olive oil.Honestly, if it had been mediocre service I would have given 2 stars. Disappointed ):",1,4,0,Alex S.,"Jersey City, NJ",173,393,48

The hostess let us even have a drink at the bar first  for a bit since there were open tables (we didnt lose our reservation). We had the tasting menu with wine, for two. It could have been for 3 (or 4 if you eat like me). Amazing antipasti - the fried artichokes were toe curling with some champagne. Also brought out was an oily eggplant carponata, fried pizzas, and a fried riceball (great rice ball, but very rich!). Our second course was a pasta - Orchiette for the Mr. and a linguini in mushroom oil for me. I dont add oil to any of my cooking, so the fried apps and the oily pasta was a bit much, but all tasty nonetheless. Our third course included a white fish in red caper sauce (sea bass or halibut perhaps?) and red wine. I liked the bold pairing, and while, even though my red wine was a little warm, I still appreciated the two together.  Service did start to sloe considerably around this time in the meal - we were getting fidgety and no one seemed to notice. Dessert took forever to come - a no-creamcheese, no-butter cheesecake and an over powdered tiramisu. Both were okay (I actually inhaled a huge amount of cocoa powder, which initially ruined the cheesecake too, but that cheesecake was tasty and very light!).

All in all, it was a great night - good food, good company and good conversations.The decoration is warm and inviting. Open kitchen and chef counter. This establishment is def more spacious and airy than most of the W.V. haunts.However, the restaurant was about 2/3 empty on a Thursday night. Hence I was a bit skeptical when I first entered the restaurant. But my concerns disappear soon after we were seated at the counter and presented our appetizers - fried artichokes with Parmesan, miniature mussels stew in extra olive oil and parsley, and some sort of fried cheese ball that I forgot the name :/ They came with a glass of prosecco for each of us. Yumm! Food were well prepared and seasoned. My favorite was the mussel stew, which we could not get enough and used bread to soak up all the sauce! On to entree, we had two glass Pinot Grigio paired with Cod in Parchment Paper and Wild Mushroom Fettuccine. All great! The fettuccinie had the perfect texture - slightly spongy, which I liked. Then came the dessert - cheese cake with a little lit candle. Then the chef and the wait staff were singing me ""happy birthday"" in Italian!It was almost perfect except that we did not have an espresso to finish up the meal! The reason I could not give it four stars, mainly because of the vibe last night - it was an older crowd and just a bit, boring :/.

4.0,12/9/2012,"Great spot!!! I was here last night for a special birthday celebration. My friend had arranged a party for 12 to celebrate his big day. I walked in around 7:30 on a Saturday night and the place was really starting to fill up. It's a slightly older crowd and it looked like a lot of people were there celebrating the holidays. We had a few glasses of wine at the bar and I'll have to say the Montepulciano by the glass was superb. When our entire party arrived we sat at a great table in the corner. Our server was a bit surly but maybe because he might have been a bit overwhelmed, the place was packed. We basically proceeded to order just about everything on the menu. Here's the rundown: they start by serving delicious bread with almost like an eggplant ratatouille. 1. Melanzana - layers of eggplant with buffalo mozzarella, basil and tomato sauce - excellent.2. polpettine - pan seared veal and beef meatballs - good but I have had better.3. polpo alla griglia -grilled octopus, fava beans, celery and tomato - EXCELLENT4. arancini - four cheese risotto dumplings - these were some of the best I've had.5. calamari - fried calamari and zucchini, fennel and sage - this was also VERY good. The calamari was not heavily breaded and there were a lot or large pieces that were very flavorful.6. gnocchi pignatiello - house made gnocchi with cherry tomatoes,melted taleggio and basil - I'm not a big fan of gnocchi but these definitely changed that. YUM!7. ravioli di spinaci - homemade pasta with spinach and buffalo ricotta in brown butter sage - another home run.8. pettole ragu - lamb with house made ribbon pasta, olives and rosemary - seriously orgasmic.9. tagliata di manzo - perfectly cooked new york sirloin with a pesto sauce10. branzino alla griglia - grilled branzino with Italian herbs - now I didn't taste this as my honey doesn't eat meat so I was trying to save that for him. He said it was fantastic.11. we had something that I don't see on the menu but I think it was a breaded pork chop. This was just OK in my book.We also had a few of the pizzas, the margherita and one that had arugula and prosciutto. The pizzas were fabulous. The crust was on the thicker side and although the prosciutto/arugula combo is one of my favorites the margherita here was ta die for. The cheese was the kicker. All in all there really was not a misstep food wise at this place. I would highly recommend it especially for large parties. It's a festive environment and the menu items are conducive to sharing.

Luckily, the bread was served with eggplant caponata, which was delicious. Had a Brussels sprouts appetizer, pasta entree and the chicken, which the waiter said it was a specialty -- it really was special. Moist, delicious.

3.0,10/30/2012,"I am always intrigued by new Italian restaurant openings in the West Village. Needless to say, any new Italian place that opens up in the WV also has pretty stiff competition - and I guess Rafele just doesn't quite measure up with the best of them.I came here with a few friends on a Saturday on a whim; Rafele had last minute dinner reservations available for a party of 4 on Opentable, so we decided to check it out. While I was very impressed with the large, open and slightly trendy space and loved the fairly-priced bottle of red we ordered for the table, the food and service were just okay. First off, I like that they give you a complimentary eggplant caponata to start with the bread. It's actually a pretty good caponata (complimentary or not), the only unfortunate thing is that the bread they served was a bit stale. We ordered the grilled octopus with a spicy tomato sauce to start, which was actually pretty tender but a little one dimensional in terms of flavor. I would have appreciated some fresh vegetables or garnish to brighten it up. I ordered the margherita pizza and found it to be kind of mediocre. While the crust was pretty chewy in the Neapolitan style, the center of the small pizza was very wet and soggy from the sauce, especially under the heft of the mozzarella. I would probably not order pizza again if I were to come back, especially with Keste and other pizza places in the neighborhood. All of my friends ordered pizza for their entrees, including the spaghetti with seafood and sungold tomatoes on their regular menu, a linguini with seafood and saffron which was a daily special, and pettole with lamb ragu. They all seemed to enjoy their pastas for the most part, with the seafood spaghetti likely the favorite dish. We also got the broccoli rabe as a contorni, which was simply sauteed with olives and pepperocini. It was fine, again, nothing extraordinary.I think what really turned me off about my first experience at Rafele was our server. He was quite impatient and borderline rude when we were ordering - and was a little pushy to say the least about trying to coerce us to order more even though we weren't very hungry. Overall Rafele is probably a pretty good option if other restaurants in the neighborhood are crowded. Because there are just so many other Italian restaurants in the area that are close to my heart, however, I can't really sing many praises for this place.",2,0,0,Cecilia Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,644,43
4.0,10/20/2012,"Really delicious and authentic Italian.  Would have given it 4.5 stars if that was an option.The ambience is very typical of West Village restaurants these days, white brick, open kitchen, high table that's like a ""chef's table"", etc.  That said, they've pulled it off well, still made it welcoming and not a too much of a scene (at least not yet).  They have tons of outdoor seating which is great.  It's on 7th so it can be a bit loud, but far enough away from the Holland Tunnel and other 7th ave bars that it's not bad.We went for dinner.  Pizza Fritta is amazing! Definitely recommend splitting as an app and getting a pasta / entree.  My friend and I both got pastas as entrees, and they were both delicious.  My friend got gnocchi which was very good, and I got a special ravioli.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the waiter told me the special was butternut squash ravioli in butter sauce (which I'm a sucker for) with seafood in the sauce.  It wasn't.  The ravioli was really a seafood ravioli, with just a hint of squash barely recognizable.  Still really good, just not what I was expecting.Regardless, everything we ate was really great.

This is not your grandmother's cooking. The kitchen was open and we watched the chef do his magic. For appetizers, the crispy fried artichokes are a must (Carciofi) along with the fried calamari. If you love risotto, you should try the mini cheese dumplings (Arancini) they were perfection. All house made pastas melted in your mouth and the sauces were not over-powering. The fish was surrounded with a delicate squash sauce that made you clean your plate. The chef has created a new twist with cauliflower. Not your sister's Thanksgiving cauliflower, either, we are talking small roasted pieces with pignoli nuts, currants and topped with breadcrumbs. But you must save room for the cheesecake.

3.0,8/28/2012,"After an intense workout at Barry's Bootcamp on Saturday morning, I spent the rest of the day running errands, gardening, cleaning my apartment, and doing laundry.  Trust me, it was an unusually productive day.  Normally, I'm not this much of an energetic ""go getter"" on weekends.  Needless to say, by the time I arrived at Rafele for our 8pm reservation, I was famished.Just as the pictures had revealed online, Rafele resembled something out of Tuscany.  Even though I've never been to Tuscany.  Think:  High ceilings, a wood-burning oven, terracotta-colored tile flooring, an open kitchen, a full and spacious bar, exposed shelving featuring bottles of wine-greenery-and wooden baskets, and a front patio with a decent amount of outdoor seating.When Megan and Hung arrived, the hostess led the three of us to a great outdoor table overlooking 7th Avenue South.  ""Great outdoor table"" quickly morphed in to ""just OK outdoor table"" once we felt the subway rumble beneath our feet.  Every 10-minutes.  Too lazy to move, we hoped that a cocktail would help ease the audible annoyance and, just maybe, aid in elevating the pitch of our voices (so we wouldn't be as interrupted by thunderous underground noise every 10-minutes).While Hung opted for some sort of 'man drink' on-the-rocks, Meg and I each ordered a glass of the house sangria.  Chock-full of citrus fruit, I enjoyed Rafele's Lambrusco-based version much more than the traditionally flat red wine sangria.  The effervescence added a peppy burst of excitement to an otherwise tame cocktail.With our beverages came a basket of focaccia and sliced country bread, plus a dish of eggplant caponata (for dipping purposes).  While the focaccia was moist and delicious, I found the country bread to be a bit stale.  Fortunately, the robust eggplant was such a tasty distraction, that it more than made up for the dried-out bread and the rumbling subway vibrations beneath our feet.Between the list of nightly specials and the daily dinner menu, I was a bit overwhelmed by all of the intriguing entree options.  For the life of me, I could not decide between the special, 'Fettuccine pasta w/ Bolognese sauce and fennel pollen,' or the Pettole Ragu.  So, I did what I always do in this situation, and told our server to ""surprise me."" But, first, we ordered a round of appetizers to share amongst the table.Polpettine - So these were the meatballs that Urban Daddy had so seductively described!  Formed in to 1x1"" patties, the beef + veal 'balls were pan-seared before being floated atop a shallow pool of warm marinara sauce.  Though under-seasoned (I had to salt the crap out of my meatball), these morsels revealed perfectly cooked, moist meat that beautifully drank the tomato gravy.  I believe we ordered two more baskets of bread for sauce-sopping purposes.Carciofi - Unfortunately, the photo that I snapped of these bad boys turned out horrendous, so I'm just going to have to improvise here.  A small, paper-lined plate was amply topped with crispy, fried artichoke-heart quarters that were liberally sprinkled with pecorino cheese and parsley.  While I'm a sucker for artichokes and most things fried, I found this particular dish to be greasy and flavorless. Entree:  Pettole Ragu - When a kitchen runner presented us with our entrees, I had to ask him what mine was.  After all, I did let our server choose for me.  He looked at me as if I had five heads, but proceeded with, ""the Pettole Ragu, ma'am.  Isn't that what you ordered?""  I smiled and nodded. While it looked more like 'Fettuccine pasta w/ Bolognese sauce and fennel pollen,' I was assured that I was presented with the Pettole.  Ribbons of golden, yolk-colored pasta noodles were lightly enveloped by a chunky, tomato-based ragu that was dotted with generous nibs of moist lamb meat.  The sauce was so delicious, in fact, that I could have used an extra bowl of the stuff, as I felt like the kitchen skimped on the given amount.  Aside from a few minor hiccups - minor, because most were quickly fixed with salt - I really enjoyed my experience at Rafele.  The space was positively lovely, including the outdoor patio and its subway aftershock - the prices were reasonable - and the food/drink was solid.  Do I consider Rafele to be a destination restaurant?  No.  But if you find yourself in the neighborhood, I would certainly recommend a visit.",0,0,1,Lindsay F.,"New York, NY",376,277,184

3.0,8/12/2012,"Some parts of our dinner here were really standout, and unfortunately others really missed the mark entirely.  I'm hoping it's just because they are still working out the opening kinks - the space, ambiance and food has great potential here.  Service - super slow and inattentive, the waitress was often missing even though the restaurant was less than half full.  The table in the basement clearly was waiting forever for the check because a patron actually had to come upstairs to find the waitress to give her the credit card. Ambiance - really rustic, open and airy with dark wood and dim lighting.  Good for a date because it was really quiet, and good for groups because they have the space to accommodate larger tables. subway rolls by but not that big of a deal.Food - like I said, some dishes really wowed and others were standard.  Here's the breakdownOctopus - good flavor, but they should provide more of the meaty part of the tentacles - they really only gave the tails ends, which were deliciously crunchy but it felt a bit skimpy by the amount of meat that was actually there.Squash Blossoms - only two came on the plate, and they were good but not as lightly fried as I would have likedPanzanella - absolutely delicious, a must try dish .  I'm still dreaming of the soaked ciabatta and the deliciously red tomatoes.  This is a standout. Gnocchi - very light and fluffy, but a little bit too sticky in the mouth.  better than the average but not incredible. Branzino - another standout dish.  flavors of rosemary really carry their weight and this was definitely a favorite.Fish stew-  great selection of fresh seafood and huge enough for a few people to splitFried pizza - this was a huge letdown.  compared to other fried pizza's i've had this can barely be put in the same category.  The crust was burnt and didn't taste fried at all.  there wasn't any cheese on the pizza either.  definitely pass on this.",2,0,1,Ash C.,"New York, NY",72,301,6

5.0,7/21/2012,"""What if it's bad?, I thought. You see, I had met Rafaelle Ronca, the chef/owner of Rafele several months ago. I had been hearing about the insane amount of work that goes into opening a restaurant through the months. I hadn't had the pleasure of eating his food at the restaurants he worked at previously, so I was excited to sample his food when the restaurant finally opened. Well, it did open and I went tonight with a friend. But then, on my way to the restaurant, I wondered what I would say if the food was bad. For better or for worse, I'm a terrible liar. I decided that I would have to be supportively honest. Well, I'm happy and relieved to say that I really didn't have anything to worry about because the food was divine!I love the space...open, modern, bright and comfortable, with an open kitchen that you can see into from anywhere in the restaurant. After saying my ""hello"" we were treated to a glass of well-needed Prosecco. So many dishes sounded delicious on the menu, it was hard to choose. The bread basket was fresh and tasty, with a few to choose from. And the caponata served with it was scrumptious! We were treated once more to an appetizer special...buffalo mozzarella stuffed fried zucchini flowers with some fried zucchini as well. It was light and flavorful, though it could have used just a tad more salt (for my taste anyway). We ordered the meatballs, octopus, gnocchi, the wild mushroom tagliatelle and a pasta special of cod/shrimp ravioli-like things. Here's what we thought...1. The meatballs - the best I've ever had! And the tomato sauce they are served in was addictive. I tried to eat it with a fork, than a knife, then bread, then I just drank it. 2. The octopus - I've never been a fan of it, but my friend wanted to try it. Now I'm a fan of it. Delicious, smoky and tender, served with fava beans, shoestring slices of celery (a vegetable I've never loved, but did here) cherry tomatoes and a light lemon vinaigrette.3. The Gnocchi - these are a lighter, softer version...very pillowy...gratineed with a light tomato broth, tomatoes and taleggio cheese (my favorite!) This was a deliciously different plate of gnocchi.4. Pasta special (fish ravioli-like thing) I believe the filling had salt-cod in it, or at least it tasted like it did, and it's a bit fishy for my taste, but my friend seem to enjoy it more. 5. Tagliatelle with wild mushrooms and truffle pate - My favorite dish. Perfect....absolutely delicious!We were stuffed, but we were told that they have the best ricotta cheesecake in the city so we had no choice but to share a piece. Indeed, it was the best ricotta cheesecake I've ever had. So creamy and vanilla-ee. a perfect ending to a wonderful meal. Now I'm thinking of all the other dishes I'd like to try. I'll be back!
