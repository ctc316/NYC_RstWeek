5.0,4/19/2019,"I'm a frequent flyer at Taboon. It's a great spot if you have some time before a show.  Love their bread. My #1 recommendation though is to order only appetizers/sides and ignore the entrees. The octopus, crab, shrimp - basically any of the seafood apps are solid! Love their sambusak too!",1,1,2,Ashley P.,"New York, NY",107,103,62

5.0,4/16/2019,"Last night was my second time going to Taboon for dinner and both times were truly exceptional! The food, service, and ambiance were all 5 stars. Taboon is a small restaurant on 10th ave so it's a little off the beaten path, which I really like! It's a little farther away from the crazy of Hell's Kitchen and is a warm and cozy space.The service was so great! The meal was spaced out perfectly and not rushed. We were seated before our reservation time and immediately given a wine/beverage list. Our drink orders were taken before they gave us the menu. I liked that they gave us time to enjoy our wine before even looking at the menu. Our server was attentive throughout the whole meal and our water was constantly refilled. For an appetizer, we had the Taboon trio, which is their OUT OF THIS WORLD AMAZING flatbread and your choice of 3 dips. We did the cauliflower hummus, baba ganoush, and spicy feta spread. I could honestly write a review of the flatbread alone... it was that good and served piping hot out of the oven! Our favorite of the 3 spreads was the spicy feta spread. Next time, we would probably get something other than the cauliflower hummus because we felt that it didn't have as much flavor as the other two.For our entrees, I had the halibut special and my mom had the chicken maschan. Both of us felt that each dish had such an amazing depth of flavor! They were interesting and the spices were so rich and delicious! I would recommend trying both dishes, especially the halibut since it's not always on the menu. We were so full that we skipped dessert, but next time I would definitely save more room! If you are looking for an interesting meal full of Mediterranean flavors, this is it!",8,0,2,Cara T.,"Manhattan, NY",1356,53,27

4.0,4/13/2019,"Very solid and such a wonderful option in Hell's Kitchen. First off, they give you complimentary warm focaccia bread. Free, WARM, bread: yes, pleeeaase and thank you (that gives any restaurant a 3.6ish base point for me, hehe!). So let's continue...the ambiance is warm (yes, they have an actual open flame oven) and slightly upscale / comfy casual. I went with two girlfriends and we ordered family style -- the Falafel mix (regular and sweet potato), the Beet Salad, and then my favorites the Sambusak and Zucchini Cake. And then apparently, the Silan is the dessert to have (I had just a tad off the top because it has nuts at the bottom). And I MUST mention how delicious the Harvey & Sons Classic Paris tea is! I added honey and lemon and when I tell you, this was my whole dessert, I mean it! Loved this tea too much!!We were all full by the end of the meal. Yuummmy and filling! Aside from a few service issues that could have been improved, Taboon is a win.",1,0,0,Yaa A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",218,137,504

Because of the size of our party, we had to have a pre-fixed menu which was booked a month ago. I wasn't worried as I have never been disappointed having dinner here...except for tonight.  The server was not good. She just placed the food down on the table as if we were in a low end cafeteria.  She did not explain any of the unique dishes to my guests and acted as if it was not fun waiting on 12 people eating and drinking. After dinner I shared my experience with the manager. He seemed to not  know what to say or have the experience to respond.  Very disappointing!!",0,0,0,Val T.,"Anaheim, CA",0,1,0
4.0,3/11/2019,"Excellent flavors! The complimentary bread comes out warm and you can order sides of dipping sauces like hummus.  The bread is a little heavy on the rosemary (I think that's what it is?) for my tasting but is still yummy.  I wouldn't say that the hummus is worth $6, buts it's a nice addition to the bread.  The oxtail dumplings were outstanding! Perfect flavor and texture, I don't think it could have been executed any better.  Would gladly order again.  Got the branzino ($40), cooked well and seasoned well.  Comes with a potato, was a slightly over cooked in my opinion.  Love the lively but romantic atmosphere.",0,0,0,Lauren H.,"New York, NY",3,127,296
5.0,2/2/2019,"We came here for winter restaurant week of 2019 with our visiting friends from UK.The place is unpretentiously classy, the entire place was packed, but the tables are set at comfortable distance from each other. We all opted for a 3 course restaurant week menu.Our server came with freshly made flat bread to share and took our orders one by one, we started with small Taboon trio a $7 supplement that includes hummus, tzaziki and baba ghanoush it went really well with our nice bottle of Pinot noir.For meze, I chose the wood-fired bake cauliflower and lamb kebab served with Taboon flat bread for my main entree. Our dishes came in timely fashion, the portions are filling and enabled us to share with the table.There are dishes that I thought stood out such as the fresh squid with mashwiya and fire roasted peppers and mushroom mafrum, we also enjoyed the rice pudding dessert as well.We truly enjoyed our dinner here, the attentiveness of the staff and the quality of service.

4.0,1/28/2019,"I visited Taboon as a part of NYC Restaurant Week Winter 2019, so some of the dishes aren't a part of their normal menu. However, as a solo diner seated at the bar, the staff was really accommodating and friendly, with the bar tender even chatting a bit throughout dinner, though wasn't overbearing.The house Bread - this bread is honestly so delicious. You get one per table, and since I was a table of one, I had it all to myself, and it was gone by the end. Perfect eaten warm with the light spices and wonderful to dip in any of the spreads or sopping up extra sauceBrick oven roasted cauliflower - Tender and crisp over a thick slather of herbed labneh, garnished with gremolata. The flavor was great, but if you took too much labneh at once it overpowered the more delicate and buttery cauliflower. I just wish there was more gremolata! There is not enough to get a taste with each bite.Grilled Tuna over Jerusalem artichokes, white asparagus and pearl onions with a pepper butter sauce - This was a special for restaurant week and the bartender told me that it was so popular as special the previous couple of weeks that they had brought it back. The Vegetables and sauce were so flavourful (que bread), but I felt the tuna steak was too heavy and masked the flavour of the vegetables. Also, there was so much tuna, I couldn't finish as it was too heavy!Coconut Rice Pudding with blood orange coulis, lime zest, semolina cake, and apple tempura - Sadly due to a peanut allergy I couldn't have the apples (peanut oil), but everything else was amazing. Slightly warm, the creamy pudding was cut by the citrus and intermittent crunch of the dehydrated semolina cake crumbles",1,0,0,Anne P.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",64,24,130
5.0,1/22/2019,"Great food, drinks, and service. Came here on a whim for Sunday brunch and was pleasantly surprised. It was fully booked with reservations (not surprised), but got a nice seat at the bar. The bartender was super chill and got me this Mexican chocolate based bourbon drink. It was strong! They do not skim on the alcohol - this was where I was first impressed.Secondly, I was impressed by the food. The sambusak was so warm, crispy bread with gooey feta innards. The feta was very creamy but not too rich as it was savory and sharp in flavor. The shakshuka is a Mediterranean brunch staple, and taboon's version really blew me away. The salmon was grilled delightfully to a medium-rare. The side salad really impressed me with the freshness of veggies and tartness is vinegar (no oil or fats involved) that gave it a kick. Yum!Lastly the service was great. Everyone was super nice. When I dropped silverware, a swarm of waiters came to grab and replace my fork instantly.

2.0,10/22/2018,"I did some research on great and popular restaurants in NYC and Taboon was one of top results  and since I really enjoy Mediterranean Middle Eastern food I decided to book a reservation for our final night in NYC. Located a few blocks away from Time Square in a very quiet part of town you will find this little restaurant with a very homey feel. The waitress advised us that the kitchen was going to close in twenty minutes so we needed to order everything at one shot. So we ordered the following dishes the famous house Focaccia, fresh squid, tuna tartar, Moroccan meatballs, and el grupo hummus platter.The first item to arrive was the Focaccia bread and the hummus platter, the bread was warm but with all the herbs baked into it, I found very bland, while the hummus included a slices of fried hass avocado and black beans. The hummus was very bland and I wish I knew about the black beans to have them excluded, the only saving grace for the dish was the crunchy fried avocados. The next two dishes to arrive were the squid which included tiny squid buried with way too much garbanzo beans and tabouleh, while the tuna tartar was very fresh, but too spicy. At first I was very excited about the Moroccan meatballs, but after the first taste, I couldn't eat anymore, for me this was one of worst dishes I have had in a while, everything was off the taste and the texture. Then came desert, and we decided to order two of them, the Valrhona Aphrodisia which is a chocolate flavor dish and the Knaffe. The chocolate dish was dark chocolate mousse with coffee crumble on top, once again not a lot of flavor and I felt that the mousse could of been more creamy. I almost thought that my meal was a total lost until the Knaffe arrived, which is a typical Middle Eastern desert which consist of mozzarella, farmer cheese and halumi cheese stuffed in a warm pastry called kadayif and topped with nuts and a rose infused syrup. This was one of the most delicious deserts I have ever had, the taste, the texture, and the sweetness of the syrup with the savory of the cheese were the perfect companions. Unfortunately one amazing desert could not justify the massive disappointment of all the other items.",2,1,0,Gerry L.,"Miami, FL",39,151,449

3.0,10/5/2018,"This is a really interesting restaurant - Mediterranean /middle eastern. Taboon is in reference to the domed oven that's used to bake the house focaccia bread which is seriously yummy. You can order a trio of dips with the bread. We ordered hummus (meh - bland and not creamy at all), feta dip (delicious), and tzaziki (delicious). We also ordered the special soup of the night which was a meat and veggie dumpling soup (delicious), Crete chopped salad (mediocre greek salad) and the egg burek. The actual egg in the dough was very good, the rest of the dish was off. Pumpkin and chestnut purée tasted like crazy spiced baby food. The flavors didn't meld together, it was quite unbalanced and there was no trace of truffle oil. I wouldn't order it again. But I would come back for the bread - it's addictive. The wait staff who refills your drinks and takes away your plates are awesome. The wait staff who take your orders however are rushed and not as awesome. The most interesting thing about this restaurant - it's always pretty packed. The diners tend to be older and well dressed. Inside gets pretty loud.

5.0,9/3/2018,"It is both a pity and a blessing that I am 3.5 hrs from Taboon. A pity because a would go back often, a blessing because I would spend an inordinate amount of money if I were closer. Overall, the food and the service were terrific and will be fondly remembered by us and our family. We ordered:Trio with hummus, baba ghanoush, and spicy feta spread: The spicy feta bread was by far the best of the three. The hummus had chunks of stewed garbanzo beans, which was a nice touch. The flatbread was warm, fluffy and delectable. Braised Oxtail Scarpinocc: The sauce was one of the most flavorful reductions that I've had in a long time. I scooped up every last bit with the flatbread. The ""ravioli"" itself was amazing, the oxtail was tender and succulent. It was a rather large ravioli with the pasta dough folded over a large pocket of contents. Egg Burek: One of the most innovative appetizers in a while. It was a soft poached egg surrounded by a fried dough. The dough made an immensely satirizing cracking crunching noise when cut into and was amazingly crispy.  The yolk from the soft boiled egg oozed out and commingled with the truffle/chestnut sauce to add an amazing creaminess to the surrounding sauce. It was delicious and well rounded with complex flavors and textures and plain old fun to eat. Lamb Kabobs in Pot Pie: from the pictures, this seemed like the thing to get and it sure was! The lamb was amazing, yes. But I was impressed that the charred eggplant and tomato were equally as delicious. The eggplant had a perfectly charred crispy skin with creamy fall-apartness that rivaled the quality and succulents of the lamb. The flatbread over the top was a great presentation and also an excellent way to mop up all the remaining juices. The sides of the flatbread tucked around the ceramic dish almost tasted like a doughnut because it was so crispy on the outside and moist and airy in the center. Tuna tartar: this was an unexpected dish compared with the others. It was high quality raw tuna with a finely chopped Mediterranean salad topping the mound of tuna. The sauce had a nice level of heat that was a good complement to the rich fish, but a different kind of spice then I am accustomed to eating with raw fish. It also had mini croquette like dumpling to go with it. Overall it was delicious and different.",0,0,0,Tiffany S.,"Baltimore, MD",99,370,280

5.0,9/1/2018,"We've been here a million times because it's one of our favorites in NYC. Pros: the brunch and dinner. Almost everything is great but if you get lamb, it's surefire to be good. The lamb kebabs in pot pie are a unique experience and full of flavorful. We recently got a bunch of sides - hummus plate, Moroccan meatballs, and summer corn polenta special. The polenta was extremely memorable with wild mushrooms, aged balsamic and mozzarella. I really want them to make this a staple. Beef/veal kebabs had a sweetness maybe from the cinnamon but the tomato sauce had a kick that made it a bit spicy for me. Hummus was nice because of the varied textures and flavors (there's a green sauce that's spicy but it's only on one side of the plate so you don't need to mix it in if it's too much.) Bread is fantastic and complimentary. Desserts are always spot on and we've tried several (knaffe, sponge date cake, and more). Their pastry chef is impressive. Only consistent downside is the mixed drinks. Sorry to say their cocktails tend to be one note and not worth the steep price.

We started with the saganaki. The butternut squash was an interesting and tasty addition. It's hard to beat burnt melty cheese! The avocado ""salad"" special was light and fresh and full of flavor. After all that I was pretty full (good portion sizes). I tried a bit of each of the dips I picked in the Taboon trio. This app would make a meal! The lamb in the Terra cotta kabob was full of cumin and flavorful. Loved the pita top (like a pot pie melding all the flavors together). Good service.

5.0,3/19/2018,"Seriously fantastic Mediterranean food in a chilled setting.It's not often you go somewhere where literally everything on the menu makes your mouth water. Luckily I was here on a work dinner and wasn't picking up the bill, which enabled to fill my boots (and belly) and lead me to a deliciously fueled food coma shortly after jumping in the cab and leaving the restaurant.The wait staff were extremely knowledgeable but also completely approachable and conversational. They knew their stuff, but they had fun with it. It was almost like they were one of your pals, and they came loaded with recommendations.I think in this evening I sampled a good 60% of the menu, and with that there arent ant dishes that shone above the others. EVERYTHING was delicious, and everything I would have ordered again, or been filthily happy with if I'd chosen that for my main.One thing I will call out is the short rib. I'd never pen a Mediterranean place for doing good short rib, but oh my god it was melt in the mouth.Would recommend to a friend.

Besides, I wasn't even sure it's legal, so I asked the chubby, bearded manager (description provided so you can avoid him).Rather than politely say, ""Actually, it's legal in NY since we serve food, too,"" this buffoon at TABOON felt obligated to add, "" BUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, LEAVE!""That attitude can kill a restaurant, no matter how yummy the cuisine.

5.0,2/8/2018,"OK, This goes against everything I said I was going to do. I rented an apartment in NY so I could explore the city, enjoy all the things that it has to offer over where I live and work Charlotte NC, and dine in a different place every time I am in town.  So now what do I do? I get to town, think of all the places there are to go and head to Taboon for dinner. This is a great place with great food and great service. Don't let the Mediterranean turn you off or on. The food in more modern international (I just made that up) than anything else.  It's NY so its crowded and you need a reservation. Wine list is reasonable. One difference in NY is that a lot of places have good wine lists that aren't very expensive. Tabooon is one of them. Appetizers, have the chicken livers they are the best. They must have a Jewish grandmother advising their Millennial chef. I had a special Halibut or Sea Bass a couple of months ago that was outstanding.  ALL THE FOOD IS GOOD. The host and hostess truly delightful, full of NY charm. And it helps that they are two blocks away from my weekend home.

5.0,1/27/2018,"Everyone has their own personal taste, but as far as ideal restaurants go this is very close to my perfect place. The food is absolutely delicious - everything from the salads to the small dishes, the seafood to the proteins. I had a lamb done two ways that I will be thinking about for a while. The braised belly stuffed with a ground lamb mixture stole the show right from the other ""way,"" which was a tender medium-rare baby chop. But the seasonings were so bold and fresh inside that ground mix that I will never forget the dish, and it eclipsed all else. Also tried the broken lasagna and enjoyed it very much. Good homemade charred bread for the table, but it is not as chewy as it looks (if that makes sense) and more airy/crispy, so I'd suggest only a piece or two to save room for the real food. Both desserts I tried, the silan and the rice pudding, were unique and perfect to close out the meal. Great service as well - all friendly people!! Would come back many times.

2.0,1/26/2018,"I REALLY wanted to like Taboon after having quite a few people suggest it to me, but unfortunately our experience was not great. We had made a reservation a week in advance for 8PM for 6 people and confirmed it. Day of I get a call asking me if I could come instead at 8:30PM but I politely declined saying after a day of travel for my guests 8PM is the preferred time. Fast forward to us getting there and having to wait over 20 minutes past our 8PM reservation to be seated as they did not want to ask the guests at the table we had reserved to please move - mind you this is after I've been told that they showed up late for their reservation and had proved to be difficult so no one wanted to deal with them. Only offer we received during this very long wait time was to have our coats put aside for us - no complimentary drink or focaccia  or (quite frankly) anything to try and rectify the situation. After being rushed through our meal (although the food is VERY good), and our server was fine but after our experience not enough for the 20% tip already included on our bill, it took another 15 minutes for them to locate our coats and bags. All in all there are plenty of places in New York that not only have great food, but amazing service. Taboon could be wonderful if they treated all of their guests like VIPS but sadly I don't believe I will return as my $500 would be better spent elsewhere.",0,0,0,Aubrey A.,"New York, NY",0,4,0
1.0,1/26/2018,"This is a tale of 2 restaurants. One is of the delicious food and warm ambiance of the restaurant and the Taboon oven. The other is the awful cold table not only literally in front of the door but also in the entrance of the Taboon service area where the dishes whisk by inches by your head and shoulders and dishes and silverware get thrown about assaulting your ears. The servers were warm and gracious, the management was arrogant, pretending to ignore the table situation and excusing it with ""well you did make your reservation online today last minute"" and bizarre words like ""this is all part of our restaurant"".  There was no apology. It took a huge effort and groveling to eventually move us.

4.0,9/2/2017,"The food was delicious. I only wish this place were more affordable. I walked into Taboon not realizing that this was such a fancy restaurant. I had assumed it was a casual neighborhood joint, but a quick look at the prices on the menu made me realize otherwise. We got:Taboon trio (hummus, cauliflower hummus, baba ghanoush) - The hummus was very very good, very thick and creamy. The cauliflower hummus was interesting - there was a strong hint of garlic / lemon, and while I found the flavors a bit overwhelming, others really liked it. The baba ghanoush was not my favorite, it tasted a bit too mayo-y for my tastes, I prefer a stronger eggplant flavor. Came with the house focacia which seemed freshly baked and was very good. Spanish octopus - SO GOOD. Came at the recommendation of the waiter, and loved it. The octopus was perfectly charred, in reasonable sized chunks, and nice and tender inside. The lemon vinaigrette was a great touch, very refreshing, and the avocado and potatoes rounded out the dish very well. Beef tartare (raw beef with pickled maitake mushroom tabbouleh, crispy parmesan, Jerusalem artichoke chips, aged sweet vermouth reduction) - Restaurant week special. I actually loved this dish. It's not a traditional beef tartare in that's it's mixed in with tabbouleh and crunchy chips, but I thought the flavors went together really well, and reminded me in some ways of like a miniature tuna poke (in that there's some veggies, some crunch topping and a raw protein). I really liked it.Braised lamb orecchiate - Restaurant week special. I only had a small bite of this dish but the lamb was very tender and flavorful. Lemon cardamom - Restaurant week special. I'd skip this. There were too many things going on in the dish, and it was too sweet for my tastes. Standouts for me were the mezze.

We sat outside since the weather was beautiful and from walking through the doors that's where our unforgettable  experiences began, from the host to the seating to the service and to the  exceptional food. Our server was attentive and gave really great recommendations on ordering the bread and their famous trio. Roasted eggplant spread is finger licking! The bread is so good that we couldn't help but continue asking for more. As seafood fans we ordered bunch of Meze which are appetizer plates:Shrimp appetizer was out of this world! With yummy lobster sauce and Parmesan polenta. Spanish octopus was literally the best I've tried in entire city! We then shared a roasted cauliflower, that was perfectly crunchy with oven wood fire oaky flavor, absolutely amazing. After the appetizers we decided to continue with main courses. My dad and I shared their signature Lamb Kebabs that come in a clay pot, with outstanding presentation underneath the bread with eggplant, tomatoes, pine nuts and tahini and a whole branzino fish it was perfect and delicate with crispy skin and great paired side of lemon soaked Greek potatoes and sautéed bokchoy, YUM!My mom ordered Tunisian short ribs that according to her were cooked to perfection with mix of spices and hummus. Servers team kept on checking on us frequently and making sure we enjoy our meal and the place was packed all through the night. After all the unbelievable tasty dishes we just couldn't give up on a dessert so we ordered as our waitress suggested a DATE CAKE which was very well balanced with pecans and warm caramel and  rum sauce underneath, a chocolate mouse soooo good that I still taste the flavor in my mouth and a PEACH ELLA that was a pana cotta topped of with port peaches and lyche sorbet! Excellent food, the menu is so unique and hard to find anything like it in this city , I must give props to the chef and the entire team!Thank you Taboon, I will be looking forward to come again and  bring more friends and family in!

1.0,5/7/2017,"We ate at Taboon for the first time last night. I reserved a table for 10pm and included a special note that it was a birthday dinner. The host/manager (not sure) seemed surprised by our reservation and needed a few minutes to find a table. It was very busy and there were two available tables side by side. Of the 2, we got the small table against the wall with one of the chairs in the main line of traffic.We ordered drinks/food by 10:15pm and after being bumped into and brushed against by various guests and staff, we asked to move to the table on the side of us before anything arrived. Both tables were for parties of 2, but our request seemed to be met reluctantly as if they wanted to save the table for a different party of 2.Drinks, bread and soup arrived before 10:30pm. At 10:30pm another couple arrived and were seated our first table. Almost immediately they complained about the location and amount of space - it's clear the table is an ongoing problem they haven't addressed.By 11pm our food still wasn't served and the couple that sat down 30 minutes after us had every one of their courses. The server came by once to explain she had made an error putting in the food and it would only be a few more minutes.At 11:15 another couple walked in and sat on the other side of us. Our food finally arrived at 11:20pm. Unfortunately, after waiting almost 90 minutes from the time we sat down, one of the dishes was not what we ordered. Our server told us to keep the incorrect dish on the house and fired the correct dish which took another 10-15 minutes.From that point on we did not see our server again. She was folding tablecloths outside (directly outside the window in front of our table), still serving the table next to us (who arrived 30 minutes after and left before we ordered dessert), but we were handed off to 2 different servers for the remainder of our meal.We waited for almost 10 minutes with an empty table for a new server to offer us dessert menus. We ordered dessert and while we watched 4 or 5 go out with candles, our birthday dessert was just dropped off - sans candle. It's small but we included a note in the reservation because it was a special dinner and it was just one more issue added to the list. By the time we were finishing out dessert, the couple that arrived at 11 had also had time to finish their meal and pay.We had to ask for our bill, the host/manager brought it, a third server picked it up and returned it. The host/manager came by after we paid to check to ask how everything was. We were honest and it was clear that the server did not inform of the bumps along the course of our meal. He was not aware of the many issues we experienced during out 2-hour stay and while he offered to buy us a drink, it was just after 12am and we had already spent just over 2 hours there (most of which, waiting.) At this point it was too late to turn around the poor experience and save what we had hoped would be a special evening.The icing on the cake was having our original server wave and thank us for coming in while sitting at a table eating dinner.The food in whole was great but the service plagued our first experience. Sadly after speaking with a few friends, they confirmed that their experiences are often similar - go for the food, not the service.

5.0,4/13/2017,"Pre theatre dinner at this fabulous restaurant with two good friends on our outing to see Six Degrees of Separation. The calamari floating on a bed of fennel was tender and tenderly flavored, and like the angels - heavenly. With our delicious rose we had a small bronzini with a pesto sauce on top of the crispy skinned grilled to perfection fishy. The steamed potato was lemony yet not tangy and like an m&m melted in my mouth.      Now I forgot to tell you about the matzoh ball soup with matzah balls made out of matzah and chick peas. I had to try it since I didn't have my Aunt Eve's this Passover. It was clean, subtle and satisfying.        Finally, the dessert. If I was going to the electric chair and had to pick my last meal, it would be a giant portion of these fireworking sensations of sweet cool crunchy and creamy. It's called ""Silan"".  Vanilla ice layered with puffed rice and date honey sprinkled with carmelized pistachios and topped with shredded halvah.

The Octopus and the bread itself were fantastic.  The mix trio of dips for the bread were also really good.  The falafel was just OK. Service - Fairly nice and attentive.  Wasn't pushy.Decor - This place is a lot bigger than we thought and has a nice romantic ambiance. We were unfortunately seated right under the coat rack by the Kitchen entrance.  That table, not great at all.  People kept bumping into us and anytime someone wanted to get their coat, we had to get up and move.Price - It's NYC so overall it was OK for the area and what we ordered.Notable Extras - The taboon itself is pretty cool.  The best dishes seem to be the ones that are made in it.",2,0,1,Reena B.,"Jersey City, NJ",137,308,400

We came for a pre-show dinner on Friday night and were immediately impressed with the ambiance an beautiful fire stove upon entering.

Our server Diana was knowledgeable about each dish on the menu and guided to our selections - babaganoush, lobster shawarma, Moroccan meatballs and beef tortellini (one of the specials - first time I've seen poppy seeds in a dressing. AMAZING). The food was amazing, each dish with its own creative flavor. We were STUFFED and didn't finish all the food to save room for... The best part for dessert - Silon. It was an amazing combination of home made ice cream for a cold texture, nuts for crunch and shredded halva for melt in your mouth goodness.

Hard to go wrong with braised meats but this done exceptionally week, amply portioned and the couscous nicely flavored with the cooking juices of the lamb. I would have preferred a nice root veg tho with this to set off contrast but the dish was great and very satisfying.  Salad was exceptional and fresh, apps - many to comment on - fantastic and again very authentically seasoned from Middle East pallet.  Desserts also special - lots of polish in them and presentation.Wines by glass a bit limited but very good and reasonable, bottles also reasonable. Modest size list with some nice Greek selections not frequently seen.   Cocktails wonderful - best Negroni I've had in city.  And half price at happy hour at bar.  Staff - welcoming , friendly and professional.  What's not to love here.

The bread was delicious and so was our main course. We got the kabob dish that was grilled then baked in the terra-cotta pot and covered with delicious pita bread. That dish was definitely the highlight of our night. The kabobs were tender and as opposed to our appetizers, the texture and the flavors were very distinct. We then had the knaffe (aka kunafa) for dessert which was by far one of the best knaffes I've had in America.

She's really easy to talk to and make great suggestions as you go along.As far as the menu, not everything on the menu is sure fire hit, but here is what we have tried:- CRAB SCHWARMA: this dish really wows, very warm and deep flavors yet the taste of the crab really comes through nicely- EL GUAPO: you must order this!!!! It reminds me of a hummus seven layer dip...there's tomatoes, black beans, yummy sauces and best of all, the most delicious piece of flat bread you've had in your life slathered in herbs and oil.- Ask for cucumber with the hummus instead of pita bread for a healthier option, it's not on the menu and may cost some more but totally worth it as the cucumber are juicy and delicious- CHOPPED SALAD is super fresh, add some grilled shrimp for fresh tasting protein- GRAFITTI EGGPLANT SALAD was our least favorite, we were expecting little strips of marinated eggplant but instead got a whole roasted eggplant with chopped tomato and feta.- FALAFEL is perfectly cooked, airy and fluffy yet filling and significant. Over the summer, they had these hummus bowls that were AMAZING but they were not on the menu last time sadly.Overall, its a good place to come if you live in the area and perfectly suited for tables 4 or larger....if you're just 2 people and walk in, you'll likely be sitting by the bar.",0,0,0,Estina R.,"Manhattan, NY",148,306,16

My dining partner had the sweetbread but was not impressed as she said it was very salty. She had expected them to have been sauteed, but instead they were grilled and hard.  The bartender did offer to replace the sweetbread entree; however, my dining partner declined.

5.0,9/20/2016,"EXCELLENT EXCELLENT ""Middleterranean"" (Middle Eastern/Mediterranean) food!I came here with no expectations and left here looking forward to a return trip! I visited Taboon on a Thursday evening at 6pm with a party of 6 (with no reservations) and we were able to score a table easily at that timeslot. As the night wore on though, it became packed to capacity (as expected) so I would recommend making reservations for later dinner slots like 7-8pm.The restaurant had a very intimate, relaxed feel to it and the decor was very nice with the Mediterranean feel. It was a perfect setting for intimate dinners, but also made a great spot for group dinners too. Throughout the evening, service was excellent and the waiter/waitresses were always filling up our waters or coming back to check on us to see if we needed anything else.As for the food? Seriously?! That was what I was thinking throughout the night as we were delivered delicious dish after delicious dish. As a group, we decided to order a bunch of Mezes (Tapas type dishes) to share and we were amazed at how great the food was! Here's a list of what we ordered and some comments on my faves:CRAB SHAWARMA CALAMARI A LA PLANCHAMERGUEZSHISH BARAKSAMBUSAK - Absolutely the entire table's favorite dish. It was so good we ordered a 2nd round of it after we had basically completed dinner. The feta cheese stuffed and melted inside was so simple, yet so delicious. The bread was baked to perfection, warm and nice and crispy. This was one of the BEST bread dishes I had ever had in my life!FALAFEL - At first I felt this was a waste of money to order since I usually order falafel from street carts, but oh was I wrong. This was some of the best falafel I had in my life. It was soft, not too chewy and very well put together. I've had falafel in the past where it didn't taste fully cooked. Well, this was NOT one of them.EL GUAPO - Extremely delicious hummus and a great compliment for the table bread. It'll make you want to order extra bread in a heartbeat!It's not to say that the other dishes weren't good because they absolutely were, but the final 3 were ones that were very memorable. I can't say enough about the high quality of the food and how superb the experience here was. Quite frankly, I'm surprised I had never heard of this restaurant, but I'm going to definitely spread the word going forward!",2,1,1,Chris E.,"Brooklyn, NY",530,1118,9624

5.0,9/11/2016,"The true test of a New York City restaurant is not the first time you try it.  Is it still great the 2nd and 3rd time? Is it consistently great with all its offerings?  Taboon delivers in all aspects.  The food was magnificent.  We started with the sublime Blue Point oysters.  Never had any better.  That was followed by the Taboon trio of traditional cold meze offerings of baba ghanooj, hummus, and schoog (very hot Palestinian hot sauce).  We split the Taboon chopped salad and the Heraime (halibut cooked in a Taboon clay oven with a ragout of roasted pepper and tomato) which was fabulous.This was our 4th or 5th visit to Taboon, and each time my wife orders the silan for dessert. It's a dish of vanilla ice cream topped with halvah and date sugar, pistachios--unbelievable mixture of textures and flavors. Look forward to this!Finally, the bread here is out of this world, crispy focaccia-like loaf that is brushed with olive oil and topped with a sprinkling of spices. You'll remember it long afterwards.

3.0,8/20/2016,"I went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat for dinner on a weekend night. The place was pretty crowded so we made a late night reservation and were able to be seated right away. Disclaimer: We were very hungry so we ordered a TON of food!Falafel (3 stars): I am not a huge fan of falafel unless it is super delicious and this rendition was just average in my opinion.Scallops (4 stars): This was one of my favorite dishes of the night as the scallops were cooked well and the rest of the dish was very complimentary.Taboos trio: Hummus, tzatziki, spicy feta spread (2.5 stars): While I love having a selection of dips to try with pita, these options were very underwhelming. The hummus was probably the best thing we tasted in the trio and even that wasn't very good. We got the spicy feta as a recommendation from our waitress and was probably the one we like least.Short ribs (4 stars): This dish was probably the best of the meal as the short ribs were actually super tender and had great flavor. The rest of the dish was not super memorable, but it was a decent sized portion.Overall, this place serves up a couple of decent dishes, but also had some misses.

The dips that came with the falafel were refreshingMain:Chicken: Came with cous cous- had a bite and was abandoned for the rest of the meal. The chicken was a chicken mousseline with foie gras and black truffle, essentially the stuffing under the skin was tastier than the chicken itself  as the chicken was dry. Had to liberally use the sauce that came with the dish to make the chicken palatable. Also that wedge of grilled cabbage was horrible. Bleh. Left so much stuff on this plate for the waiter to take away... Grilled tuna sabeech style: Better than the chicken, recommend this dish! Ate everything clean from this plate. Tasted like summer for sure!Dessert:Sorbet Trio: The flavors were amazing! They were all so fragranced and really refreshing.

Combined, the sauce didn't add much.The red wine, granted was the cheapest bottle, but not very good. It wasn't smooth, so you could taste the alcohol in it.The best dish was the lamb shepherd pie. The dough covering the dish was large and doughy, very unique. The tartness of the sauce in the pie balanced the mildness of the doughy overlaying. It is visually appealing and quite grand.

So when I found out that the dips are a separate purchase and do not come with the bread, I was disappointed. I wanted two breads!! And the dips themselves were quite expensive. But whatever, the taste made up for it. During the week I went it turned out it was hummus fest. We ordered the shortrib hummus which was delicious! The short rib was savory and had no fat on it. It paired surprisingly well with the hummus. However, I did think that 22 for hummus was a little over priced. The entrees and drinks were good as well, but no stand outs.

5.0,5/16/2016,"We have walked by here repeatedly and rarely have seen an open table, so we finally decided to try taboon for date night before a show last weekend! Reservations definitely recommended as it fills up, even with the extra tables outside with the nicer weather.We started with their complimentary house focaccia and chose two options from the taboon trio - the baba ghanoush and the spicy feta spread, as well as an order of the falafel. The spicy feta spread on the focaccia was definitely the star of the show as far as our apps went, and we went as far as to wipe the little bowls clean with our extra entree bread! The falafel was only so so, maybe it was the curry dip I didn't love or maybe because the their spreads we ordered we so delish, but I'd try something else next time. Our cocktails were STRONG, in a good way but my second was almost too strong to drink, so beware.We also shared the burrata with crispy brussel sprouts - the burrata was flavorful but certainly more mozzarella than that creamy center I'm used to (I saw almost none of that) . The brussels were some of the best I've ever had, but were quite sweet so I could only have a few.For our dinner we shared the Terra Cotta Lamb Kebabs, which were UNbelievable! It came deconstructed and baked in a bowl with a tomato-based sauce and focaccia dough top sort of like a chicken pot pie. So filling, so delicious, and somehow we had room for dessert. We shared the Silan - their twist on an ice cream sundae almost and it was perfect to share for 2-3.

5.0,5/11/2016,"My husband and I took his parents here for dinner prior to seeing a show when they were visiting back in December and all of us absolutely loved it! The hit of the night was the Sambusak - bread stuffed with cheese, jalapenos, and onion. We couldn't get enough of it!Both myself and my mother-in-law got the ricotta gnocchi dish and we enjoyed it so much we finished everything on our plates, which is not common for me. My husband got the special that night, which I forget the name of but it was similar to a chicken pot pie and he loved it as well.The service was also great. We'd absentmindedly made our reservations for only 2 people and we were on a time crunch since we had tickets to a show.

3.0,3/25/2016,"I feel totally conflicted writing this review. Half of me says solid 4 stars and the other half? Solid two. So I guess three is where I land. We were joining our friends and a couple of their friends for dinner and had no idea where we were going to eat. My friend said I know a great place so Taboon we entered. The place was packed and dimly lit. As other reviewers stated, it started out great and just  got worseOrdered: Appetizers:2x Spanish Octopus  Taboon trip with tzaziki, spicy feta and a hummus2x ceaser saladsSagonaki (Greek Cheese Fondue)Entrees:Ricotta GnocchiTunisian Short Ribs2x Hanger SteakAll of the appetizers were honestly amazing. I was ready to say this one one of the best restaurants I had dined at in years. Fresh, different, delicious. My boyfriend could have ate the spicy feta in spoonfuls. The octopus? tender, fresh and juicy. The Sagonaki? this great burst of flavors that I cant even really explain. The mixture of squash and cheese had me curious but WOW. The entrees? Bad. Not ""Eh"" not ""boring"" BAD. I cant speak on the short ribs, I did not taste them. The gnocchi? I have never met a gnocchi I didn't like....until Taboon. I had two/three forks of it and pushed it aside. The spinach I thought would be a nice addition but just had this tang to it that tarnished the entire dish. The hanger steak was bland, and my boyfriend dumped the spicy feta on top to give it some flavor. Portion size was small for the price. To top our night off, we received the check- a little under $600.00 for a group of six where two people didn't have any alcoholic beverages and shared one entree with their spouse. We finished our drinks and were one of two parties left in the place, when the waiter comes over and tells us they wanted to close the restaurant so we had to go. Excuse me? Unacceptable, especially after dropping 6 Bills.  I cant say I wont come back for the spicy feta, octopus and sagonaki - but we will never order any entrees here again.",1,1,1,Jessica N.,"Long Island City, NY",222,410,343

I stumbled upon it on Yelp and was surprised I had never heard of it before.We came here for brunch and ordered the Taboon Trio and the Green Shakshuka. The hummus and tzatziki was delicious but the highlight was definitely the house focaccia that came with it. I can't begin to describe how good the focaccia was -- it was the perfect combination of fresh, warm and crispy. You can tell they make it right there in their oven because the aroma of the dough permeates the restaurant! The green shakshuka was good, too. I'm usually not a fan of creamed spinach but Taboon did it pretty well. The eggs in the shakshuka were also cooked well.

4.0,2/1/2016,"**Restaurant Week Winter 2016 Review**Made a reservation for Taboon for a Sunday night and got there and still had to wait 10 minutes.  I'd definitely suggest making a reservation ahead of time, especially during RW.This seems to be a lovely place for a date - not too quiet, not too loud.  The decor here is dim, but not too dim, and very romantic.  However, we, mid to late 20 somethings, looked around and we were probably the youngest people there by at least 10 years.  Not sure if it's always like that, but it definitely was that night.Service interesting... every time a dish came out it seemed like they just threw it on the table.  My individual-sized appetizer was put on top of the empty cheeseboard that the bread came on (instead of it being taken away).... and my entree was borderline slammed in front of me.  Maybe I'm just being picky, but I just found that interesting.HUGE RW portions here.Meze - delicious babaganoush and tzatziki.  Didn't care too much for the hummus, as it tasted pretty standard.  The housemade focaccia was freaking amazing.  SOOOO GOOD.Appetizers: - lamb shawarma - amazing seasoning and loved how the meat and the yogurt came together.  HUGE portion.- I also tried the calamari - grilled! Not breaded or fried.  Came with another yogurt-based sauce and fennel and artichokes.  Delicious... and you get a lot of it, too.I was almost full after eating just appetizers.Entree:- got the lavraki (European seabass) - you get basically the fillets of an entire fish, pan seared to crispy perfection.  The fish was not overcooked and was flaky - yum!  The cooked fennel was good, but wasn't a fan of the extremely pickled/sour artichokes.Dessert:- Silan - vanilla ice cream topped with the most amazing curly halva and nuts and date honey. Extremely, extremely sweet, but oh-so-satisfying.  Now I need to go find me some of that curly halva.  I've only had the kind that breaks apart.  A must try for RW or even on their daily menu.- Rice pudding - reminds me of the coconut-based vietnamese rice desserts.  Very heavy, but tasty.One of the better RW picks, for sure.

For starters, we shared the trio of cauliflower and the falafel. The cauliflower was slightly charred (yum!!) and served on labneh and it was out of this world, and the falafel was the best falafel I've ever had! It was served with tahini with a mango sauce on top--didn't care much for the mango, but I would definitely get this again. For my main, I ordered a special off the maze menu: crab and feta in puff pastry--simply delicious! My friend also ordered off the specials menu--it was a fried avocado served over black beans and hummus. Quite tasty. One of the best things of the night was the Silan that I ordered for dessert. It was unlike anything I've ever had and it was the perfect size. The combo of the puffed rice, pistachios, halva & ice cream was sweet, crunchy, nutty & creamy.

On the recommendation of a good friend and foodie, I took a business colleague here after a day full of meetings across Manhattan. Even though it's located pretty far west, it's worth the extra block or two.First of all, I really liked the space. You walk in, overlooking fresh vegetables, fruits and other ingredients for the night's cooking, and literally are looking into a clean and enticing kitchen. A few tables are situated, but the main dining room is through an open entryway into a nicely sized, intimately lit space that wasn't too noisy despite the place being packed at 7pm.The menu is creative and excellent. We started with the signature baked homemade focaccia bread with three different spreads. Of the three, the spicy feta cheese spread was to die for. So good that we ordered another round of bread to spread this delicious concoction over it.For entrees, we had the branzino and the lamb kabobs. The fish was divine... fresh, very tender, nicely topped with a flavorful salsa and served with potatoes and swiss chard. The chard was exceptional, and the potatoes were tender and nicely glazed. My friend had the kabobs, and he raved about the taste of the lamb, the vegetables, and the broth inside this baked dish under a pita draped over the bowl.We finished by sharing two desserts... the silan (which is out of this world) and the date sponge cake, which was nearly as spectacular. Both of these were at the recommendation of our delightful waitress, who was very attentive, as were the entire staff keeping our water glasses full and table promptly cleared.We also had a delightful Spanish red wine, a Tampranilla Reserva which was medium bodied, with a great nose, and immediately ready for drinking and enjoying.

Order the focaccia trio - humus, babaganush & tzaziki. All are freshly made and have a burst of unique flavor. Although one focaccia is not enough for the 3 dips, you'll have to order a second. The crudo is an amazing and gorgeous dish of flavors. The short ribs basically tear apart. Large selection at the bar, great wines and the bartenders mix up great cocktails.

The food was ok but any enjoyment from that was thrown out the window by a very rude, inexperienced manager. Waited forever on drinks and when we nicely reminded our server, we were totally dismissed. To the ""manager"" in the dark suit with a beard and other lady that joined him that were huddled in a corner whispering and staring at us, maybe do that behind closed doors as it made for a very uncomfortable night especially since we were very patient with you.  Hopefully the owners will take this as constructive criticism and ""school"" the very inexperienced gentleman who likes to call himself a manager.",0,0,0,Stacy L.,"New York, NY",114,3,0
3.0,9/8/2015,"This was our second dinner at Taboon. The food is excellent, but we've decided not to return. We couldn't get a reservation for two any time between 6 and 8 (through OpenTable), so we arrived around 5:45 PM on Sunday evening. There was only one other occupied table in the restaurant. We started with a trio of hummus, baba ganoush, and olives that were all phenomenal, especially coupled with their famous bread... but they brought our entrees just minutes after the starter, when we hadn't even finished a third of it. The restaurant was almost completely empty, mind you, and only one or two more parties arrived during our entire meal.Meanwhile, our waiter was a bit snarky. He brought our drinks and took our order, checked in with us the second the entrees arrived, then disappeared for the remainder of the meal. We waited about twenty minutes after finishing before finally flagging down another waiter to help us get the check (because come on--the place was empty and we hadn't seen him in over forty minutes?). I had the ricotta gnocchi (very light with amazing truffle flavor--total umami) and my husband had the halibut; both were also phenomenal, but everything, we felt, was overpriced--especially considering the poor service. Even his martini cost more than it should have (and we get martinis all the time in NYC), given it's not really a ""special"" or elegant atmosphere. For the same price you can get a good meal AND good service/ambiance elsewhere. We just don't feel it lives up to the hype.",5,0,0,Meredith G.,"Bronxville, NY",12,21,12
5.0,8/13/2015,"Went here with my daughter and son for restaurant week. From the moment we walked in, we were treated well. Our reservation was for 5:15. My son and I got there right at 5:15. My daughter was running late. They were so gracious. I knew in advance what my daughter wanted to order. But since she was a little late, we waited. About 15 minutes later, they asked if they could take our order. They took our order. When our appetizers arrived, my daughter still wasn't there and THEY apologized to me!! OMG! A few minutes later, my daughter arrived and all was wonderful. My daughter had the ricotta cakes for her appetizer. My son had the mozzarella salad (forgot what it was called) and I had the green salad with pomegranate. All was delish. Prior to that they served a complimentary appetizer- which consisted of warm focaccia with humus, babaganoush and tzatzaki. Again, amazing! I had the branzino for my main dish. Both my son and daughter had the gnocchi. I tasted the gnocchi- delicious. My fish was very good! For dessert, my son and daughter had the chocolate cake. It came with halvah infused ice cream. I had the semolina cake- that came with a scoop of ice cream and grapefruit. The grapefruit was a wonderful addition! Every year we try a different restaurant during restaurant week.

4.0,8/3/2015,"My husband and I visited Taboon during 'restaurant week'. We liked the relaxed ambiance - dark wood, white airy pulled-back curtains and discreet international music. Unfortunately the service was very uneven. The red-haired waitress that served the table beside us was awesome while our waiter was not. He wanted to take out order without telling us about the daily specials. When I asked him about the specials, he asked me if I'd be selecting from the 'restaurant week' menu -- I explained to him that I wasn't going to make a dinner selection until I knew all the the available menu items. He seemed bothered. [Telling patrons about the daily specials should be automatic, waiters should not have to be prompted to share this information and should not assume that all customers want to select from a pre-fixe menu just because one is available.]  Service issues continued as we had a very long wait between dinner and dessert and some of the kitchen staff didn't seem adequately trained as to how to place items on the table. Luckily, the food was delicious! From the fresh-baked bread and various dips/spreads, seafood and vegetarian appetizers, fresh fish entrees and desserts. They also have an adequate wine selection, by the glass and bottle.

4.0,7/31/2015,"Went here for dinner on Thursday night for Restaurant Week. I'd never heard of it before, but looking around on social media, the flatbread and three dips they give you as an appetizer really caught my eye. I was extremely late for my reservation (sorry!!!), but they were fine seating me and the restaurant was really nice with a good vibe. We went early (6pm was the only reservation), so the crowd was older, but when we were heading out the vibe was changing a bit. The flatbread was delicious and of the three dips, I would say the yogurt dip was my favorite. I think it had the little bits of cucumber in it, so it was a nice contrast to the warm bread. For appetizers I ordered the octopus and my friend ordered the burrata. The octopus was delicious - tender and very flavorful. For our entrees I ordered the Branzino and she got the short ribs. The Branzino was okay, nothing particularly exciting or special, but with the lemon on it, it was pretty good. My friend said she didn't love the short rib with hummus combo, but the short rib alone was good. For dessert, we got the chocolate cake and semolina cake. I would say go with the chocolate cake. The combo with the ice cream was really good, and a perfect sweet ending for the meal.

4.0,7/29/2015,"I loooove me some Middle Eastern food. Taboon is pretty out of the way, but it's definitely worth visiting if walking more than one avenue block per day doesn't scare you (to clarify - doesn't scare you *too* much - it is quite the terrifying thing).Came here on a Tuesday night to try out their restaurant week menu. It's a fairly intimate space given how spacious it is - dim lighting, candles, the works. At the same time, it's incredibly lively. The kitchen is fairly visible from the smaller portion of the restaurant, so if you happen to be seated there you'll get to experience the energy (and delicious aromas) emanating from the room where culinary magic is made.  Not much to say on the service front. Our waiter was pleasant and attentive. Pretty standard. A nice touch - and I don't know if this is the case at other restaurants that participate in restaurant week - is that you can substitute other dishes that *aren't* on the RW menu (for additional, charge of course). That goes for the specials too. We didn't opt to do that, but having the option was nice.What we ordered (and shared - you need do RW with someone who's willing to share absolutely everything...any other strategy is madness):-Trio of dips (hummus, tzaziki and baba ganoush) w/ homemade focaccia - COMPLIMENTARY and debatably the tastiest thing we had all night. It comes to you fresh out of the oven and the dips are all delicious.Apps:-Zucchini Cakes w/ feta, mint, fresh herbs, sumac yogurt sauce, lime (you only get two...at least in the RW portion - not enough in my opinion, I wanted five more)-Calamari A La Plancha (sautéed calamari, green vegetable, bulgher wheat and pomegrante tabouli, greek yogurt). Also debatably the tastiest thing we had - wonderful blend of flavors - you know when you start spooning out all of the supporting characters of a dish that it tastes really really good)Mains:-Branzino (lemon soaked greek potatoes, swiss chard, caper salsa verde). This was the only dish I didn't love - or like, really. Pretty bland. I can't really cook and I could've probably made this myself. I promise you, that's really saying something. -Chicken Taboon (organic, french-cut chicken breast, frikeeh risotto, duck confit roasted carrots, cipollini onion, turnips) Yummy, fresh and creative. I almost always opt for seafood over poultry but in this case the chicken preparation was a lot more flavorful/interesting. Your typical organic chicken breast that you'll see on a menu is often the most boring entree option - not here! Overall, had a delightful experience here. Tried a teeny bite of the rice pudding for dessert - nothing special. Tasted like the custard part of a fruit tart but slightly less sweet. This place is expensive but if you're a fan of Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food, it should definitely go on your list. They also have a variety of wines from an impressive number of regions (including Israel - hooray authenticity!), so you can go to town on that too.",12,4,7,Molly T.,"New York, NY",887,463,1480

The friendly waiter explained to us the food specials and gave us interesting info on the cocktail list.To start we ordered the schoog and the taboon trio (hummus, baba ghanoush, and tararmasalata). The shoog was a bit spicy for me but it was still delicious. The baba ganoush was probably the best I've ever had. The hanger steak and branzino (whole fish) were ordered for main courses. The hanger steak was cooked perfectly. It was juicy and you could cut it with a butter knife. Whatever sauce it was served in was perfect too. It came with sides, one of which was a half onion stuffed with potato, some kind of meat (bacon?) and with a hot pepper and yogurt on top. It was awesome. The fish was fresh and cooked perfectly. It was moist and flakey just the way branzino should be.Just to note; I saw some reviews saying that the staff was rude and rushed people out. This was not my experience. The waiter was very polite and although our food came out promptly, with perfect timing, at no point did we feel rushed. At one point we both left our table to say hi to friends who happened to be there. In our absence, the small remainder of our food was not touched, the waiter just folded our napkins for us.

This message is regarding the manager on-duty on the evening of 7/15.This was the worst experience at a restaurant in the 8 years I have lived in the city. My mother who just flew in from out of the country and came to celebrate my wedding, had a hair in her food. It was buried deep inside of the onion of the steak dish and ended up inside of her mouth. She then placed it back on the plate, and the wait staff was great and took it away. Then, the manager came over gave an insincere sorry followed by ""no one in the kitchen has long dark hair"" then looks around the table - insinuating that it was one of our hairs. I then asked her what she meant by that, and that I was very offended by her accusatory tone. She then said ""I already said sorry, what more do you want me to do."" Clearly, she was not sincere in her apologize which was cloaked in a passive aggressive accusation. While she sent over dessert wine, the order was not comped, which we didn't make a scene about because our dinner was already ruined. On our way out, she smirked and said ""did you enjoy your dessert wine"" as we walked out. I eat out all of the time, live down the street, and am so disappointed in the service that I experienced today, that I can without a doubt say was my worst restaurant experience in my 8 years in NYC.I previously went out of my way to recommend Taboon and even had it on my wedding ""go to"" list.

After we requested to discuss with the manager, it was obvious that they wanted to advance some other folks (who wanted to make a reservation at this time as ours) on our behalf and hence she created this whole issue of our reservation being cancelled. Trying to reason with the manager, she played it down:""so the waiters took your bread away, will give you another bread"", a big ""no no"" in such business. Furthermore she was dismissive, had no manners and lacked credibility and professionalism. We lived in the area for years and frequented the place often, we were never treated like this.

The food is the star at Taboon. It starts with their amazing bread loafs. Hot, sliced, nicely seasoned, served on a board. Yummy. The bread alone is worth the trip. But the marvelous entries followed. Halibut and steak dishes. The halibut is served in the cast iron pan with lentils, onions, peppers, a red sauce with Mediterranean seasoning.

We also had great service from our friendly waiter. We sent one lamb dish back to cook the lamb a little more and the waiter took care of this cheerfully (and the chef put an entirely new crust over it). We particularly recommend the appetizer trio of hummus, spiced feta, and baba ganush; the kibbeh appetizer; and the Heraime (halibut cooked in a ragout of roast pepper and spices).

Excellent! The decor was rustic and cozy, and everything from the wooden tables to the candles lining the windowsills was picture perfect.

The bread is the best part, perfectly baked in their Taboons, piping hot and seasoned just right. Definitely order the dips.

The most interesting about the night was when we wanted a last round of drinks but because of the weather they wanted to try to get everyone home as soon as possible. Tania who was in charge for the night was being thoughtful of her staff and encouraged us to try a bar around the corner. But we butted heads while trying to do convince her to serve a last round. Thankfully we were able to remedy the situation and Tania gracefully handled it and even gave us the round of drinks on the house.

Well, there was nothing particularly wrong about it, however nothing it wasn't exciting, either. I am a vegetarian and I sometimes eat fish, as well. I couldn't find anything on the entree besides the Mediterranean Sea bass dish. We ordered some appetizers and tapas to see how I'm going to feel. Ordered a focaccia bread with some dips and some zucchini pate. They weren't too bad but I think my main complaint is that the menu is pretty short and wasn't very diverse.

I was slightly annoyed at being charged for hot sauce but I did it anyway.  So the hot sauce was actually like the green herby peppery sauce you get with falafels so I didn't feel as bad but I still think $3 is a bit steep.  Anyway, we ended up eating 70% of it because it tastes so good with the bread!  One of the girls got the eggs Benedict with lox and liked it, but it wasn't anything to write home about.  Ok so now on to the tea - get the house made mint tea, it was lovely and refreshing.  It's not sweetened and comes in a charming silver teapot.  It's literally fresh mint leaves, sage, and verbena muddled and steeped in hot water.  Sounds so simple but was absolutely awesome and made my brunch!  Make sure you get the house made mint tea and not the mint tea bag, they have both.",1,0,0,lex i.,"New York, NY",3,42,170

For our entrees we shared the lamb duo and branzini. I drank the Bes cocktail and it was delish! The branzini was great and the best thing about the lamb duo which cost $36 was not the lamb chop but the kebab and lentils the dish was served with. The chop was grizzly and looked totally unappetizing--I didn't even try it. The worst part of our meal was the service--we came in sat down and a good few mins after deciding on everything we wanted we placed the order for everything when the waitress came to take our drink order. As we were eating our food we got told that it was the last call for the bar (usually the last place to close in a restaurant I thought??) and then during our entrees we were handed a dessert menu and were told if we wanted dessert we had to order it now as the pastry chef was leaving! I thought this was totally ridiculous. We were spending $32+ for entress and being kicked out! Not OK. We ordered two desserts--the date cake (good) and the silan (amazing!). The busser was kind of a douche with service and tried to take away plates and spoons while we were still eating our dessert.

Went with a friend and we shared the house bread with a trio of dips (hummus, tzatziki, and baba ghanoush). We asked for a 2nd bread to finish the dips and were charged $4.50...no one told us it was that much another bread. Limited menu in terms of creativity and flavor. Apps: had the steak slider, friend the shrimp app. Shrimp was good, had a weird mushy but flavorful patty underneath. First slider was really rare (raw to me) and sent it back. 2nd one didn't have much flavor, just steak and bun and a tzatziki drizzle over the top. Entrees: we are convinced they forgot about our food. There was a 20-25min wait and during which, the server accidentally marked our table for dessert with spoons. Eventually it arrived: friend got the steak...really moist, nice pan sauce and decent stuffed onion. I didnt want fish or duck so oven roasted veggies it was. Again it was sent back (half cold) so it was reheated in a pan. Not much flavor and very small portions. Gnocchi in it was pillowy though on a bright spot. Dessert: silan is worth the hype, but it's about a 4 spoonful dessert. Friend got the chocolate cake which was warm and gooey with a currant sauce and quennelle of ice cream. Service was good.

5.0,6/13/2014,"The Silan dessert is like a little piece of heaven...if nothing else get this!! And save room for it if you do get a meal. Taboon has become a regular stop when I'm visiting New York.  And it never disappoints.  I had a quick dinner at the bar Tuesday evening before the theatre (go see Cabaret!).  (Note a price-fix pre-theatre menu is available.)My bartender for the evening, Casey, was very friendly and helpful.  He was right on point with his wine recommendation when I asked for something light and not too dry...the Sancerre was wonderful, very drinkable, food-friendly, and refreshing. And he also remembered that I'd mentioned at the beginning I wanted to save room for dessert (I have my priorities straight!), and made sure I had a dessert menu in plenty of time before I finished my meal. No lag time! I opted to not do the pre-theatre menu, but instead ordered  two smaller dishes--favorites of mine--so I'd have room for dessert. Big fan of their zucchini cakes (see my previous review) and absolutely love, love their beet salad. Full of beets with Asian pears and yogurt pistachio mint dressing (no lettuce, as it should be!) I reluctantly could not finish it all (it's a good size portion), out of fear I would not be able to handle dessert.  Held back on the taboon-baked puffy bread for same reason, but it is delicious. Onto to dessert...don't pass up the Silan, especially if looking for a lighter dessert. It's heavenly! Vanilla ice cream, but layered with puffed rice and date honey, sprinkled with caramelized pistachios and then topped with shredded halva.  The bartender, Casey, was even helpful beyond the menu. When he found out I'm from DC and often go to the theatre, he recommended a show his friend is in at the Studio Theatre in DC. I'm sure I'll stop by Taboon the next time I'm in NYC (and hope Casey is working that day!). I'd really like to catch their brunch if I'm there on a Sunday!",1,0,0,Angela G.,"Alexandria, VA",9,155,24

The problem:  the cocktails are poured lightly and a little confused in their focus. The food is an overly lightened version of Levantine favorites. The labne was microscopic and lacking bite, the squid gorgeous but sadly flat.  At a premium NYC price point.

4.0,4/27/2014,"We had a Groupon to go to Rustic LES, but they were closed due to a gas leak so I searched for something comparable. I was definitely in the mood for something North African or Middle Eastern, and you Yelpers kept telling me to go to Taboon.My first impression was the cleanliness of the place. Immaculate! The restaurant is located on the corner and has a lot of windows. This, combined with the white walls, makes for an inviting atmosphere.The cocktails were good. Go with the Taboon Mule ($12) if you like whiskey, or the Minty Maya ($12), if you like mint. As Nathaly V. points out, the wine by the glass options weren't expansive by any means, but they do have some decent bottle choices at reasonable prices, including some Greek options. We went with a bottle of Oenodea ($24).The complimentary bread was delicious, but they do charge for your dipping sauce ($3 each). Kind of cheap of them if you ask me, but the Schoog had a nice kick. Go with that if you can take the heat.As for the entrees, the lamb osso bucco with faro, swiss chard and green peas ($30) was excellent. The meat fell right off the bone. It wasn't dry or overcooked, and the combination of the faro, swiss chard and peas made for a great blend.The lamb duo (Grilled lamb chops and ground lamb kebabs served over a stew of root vegetables & lentils with nablus tahini & fresh mint-cilantro salad) was a little pricey at $36 considering the relatively small portion size, but the lamb was certainly tender and well seasoned.Overall, this is a great date spot, but the menu was a little less Middle Eastern than I was expecting.",0,2,0,Adam D.,"México, D.F., Mexico",2035,1515,2096

4.0,4/1/2014,"Despite being a little worried about the menu, I had a solid brunch here last weekend and would not hesitate to go back.See, I was worried because of two things: 1. There was no bacon on the menu. 2. I'm a bit picky with my eggs and I could see that most of the dishes on their menu had the eggs poached or fried or baked. I wish that I did, but I just don't get down with that. I also don't love being the obnoxious girl making all kinds of changes and substitutions. But my bestie arrived and immediately calmed me down by telling me she knew I'd be able to get scrambled because she's seen others request it before. Phew.She recommended the Eggs Taboon, a round, puffy baked bread - in my mind, kind of a cross between pita and pizza and naan - topped with eggs and your choice of two garnishes. All three of us got it, but goodness knows I didn't stick to just two garnishes! I topped mine with shrimp, roasted red peppers, zucchini, kalamata olives, and feta. YUM. There was a minor mishap where they forgot my shrimp, but the end result was worth it. It was so so good, and one of those awesome dishes where you feel like you're being really healthy, but you're probably not. It tasted fresh.And what better way to follow up feeling healthy than with molten chocolate cake?! Obviously. God, that was good and topped with a coffee ice cream. Also delicious: the bloody mary! Perfectly spicy, and featuring some kind of mysterious spice or herb my palate is not refined enough to decipher.Since bread was starring in all our entrees, we didn't get any bread appetizers, but I definitely will next time. I was super jelly of other tables when theirs arrived hot out of the oven and accompanied by various dips and hummus.",1,1,0,Megan C.,"Astoria, NY",236,265,45

3.0,3/11/2014,"To sum it up - mediocre food, slow service.I tried the appetizer trio to start, and was not impressed - the hummus was bland, the schoog was unimaginative (basically jalapenos, garlic, cilantro, cumin and some olive oil ground together, you can make it at home int 2 minutes), and the red pepper dip turned out to be 80% cheese with a bit of pepper thrown in. It was served with hardly any bread and we had to ask for more, which took a while. The bread was actually very good, better than the dips it came with. For Entree I ordered the Heraime which was also fairly bland - the sauce no spice, certainly no heat as it should have, and the fish itself was tiny. The bread was the saving grace here as well when used to soak up the sauce.We had to wait a while before we could get the waitress to pay any attention and get us the bill.

5.0,3/11/2014,"I must admit, I'm new to the world of Middle Eastern/Mediterranean cuisine. Being that it was heading towards the last days of Restaurant Week, I wanted to venture into something new. When looking at the price fixe menu, theirs immediately caught my eye. With such a diverse assortment of foods, I was all in. My friend and I kinda made last-minute plans to dine, so the only reservations we could get were at the bar. I usually don't like eating at the bar since it tends to be very crowded and I had no idea how big or small the inside of Taboon was going to be. When I stepped inside I was pleased to find it was not only spacious but beautifully decorated. Low lighting, clean accents and a rustic feeling. And that oven! You could just smell the aroma of fire-roasted foods waiting to be eaten. As for our seating arrangements-- probably the best dining experience I've ever had at the bar. Our bartender was on point. He was attentive, friendly, talkative, and just an all around awesome guy. (And might I add good-looking too.) Now onto the food:-Their signature, known-for flatbread cooked in the taboon oven was ridiculously delicious. One bite and you'll be transported to your food happy place. It was well seasoned, crispy and buttery. As well as it came with a trio of dips--homemade hummus, tzaziki and baba ghanoush. They were all silky, earthy and creamy.-(Appetizer) Creamy Yukon Potato and Asparagus Soup: Very creamy & savory and just hit the spot with all this cold weather happening lately. -(Entree) Chicken Taboon: Organic free-rang chicken breast with cured lemon, Israeli couscous, broccoli rabe, pearl onion confit and all topped with a panzanella salad. This dish was very refreshing, light and refined. The chicken was tender, juicy as well as flavorful. All around it was a great dish.-(Dessert) Silan*: I saw so many outstanding comments about this dish and had to try it. Decadent vanilla ice cream with puffed rice cereal, date honey, caramelized pistachios and shredded halva. I have no idea how this was thought up but thank you to whoever did. ________________*Alright. Let's just say I was in a beauty pageant, and they asked me what would make the world a better place.

4.0,1/21/2014,"You know when you steal your girl's magazines to take the quizzes,* and there's always some random-ass question like, ""Oh my God, like, what food can you not live without?"" and the more popular answers are always cheese or chocolate? Well, I may or may not have taken a quiz with this question recently, where another possible answer was bread. Which is kind of unfair, because it's a staple of sustenance, unlike some slice of brie or something. Still, what I'm trying to say is, I didn't pick bread. But this was me, pre-Taboon. And now that I've been to Taboon, I'm in a tizzy, and maybe I can't live without bread, after all. And now, I might have to redo all these damn girly quizzes, and God knows I'm probably a totally different type of flirt/lover/person because of it.Self-emasculation aside, you know where I'm goin' with this. Taboon's breads are justifiably their specialties. Despite being somewhat basic on paper - ingredients are listed as olive oil, rosemary, sage, and fluer de sel (a.k.a. bougie salt) - their House Focaccia is delicious. It's rather gracious of them to make the first loaf on the house, but probably also tactical and sneaky, knowing you're totally gonna order another bread, be it focaccia or something fancier.Well, we went fancier (duh), specifically the Sambusak, most definitely my favorite thing we ordered at Taboon. Stuffed with ample amounts of feta, jalapeños, and onion, it looked like a bread-bomb** that we would just never, ever be able to finish.We finished it. Some might even say devoured. Easily. I regret nothing.Fear not, for we ate dishes beyond breads. Although, truthfully, I wasn't impressed by the Red Snapper Ceviche. It had a nice, palate-cleansing freshness to it, but it tasted more like a cold salad than a fish appetizer. In fact, I had trouble even finding the fish amid a mouthful of veggies. As far as mezes go, the Grilled Octopus Confit was more my speed, very well-cooked, meaty, and tossed about some smoked apples, fresh dill, and pickled greens.The Striped Bass special (I swear, a hybrid of two regular menu items - their Heraime and Vegetarian Grill) was a forkably tender fish with a very flavorful broth, if perhaps a bit on the small side for an entree (the three gnocchi it came with were a serious tease). I can only attribute this to Taboon's assumption you've got a belly full of bread and anything bigger would be border-line gluttonous. OK, so they wouldn't be wrong.Even if they're hit or miss on the non-bread items, Taboon still totally won me over. This may or may not have had something to do with their Opah cocktail (fig vodka mixed with Maker's Mark, lemon juice, ginger syrup, and topped with champagne), which I ordered multiple of since I was convinced no other drink on the menu was going to top it. Sure, it comes in a martini glass, but as we all now know, I've been emasculated worse. Not to mention, the staff was super nice, and the atmosphere's super date-ready, adorned with a romantic white brick interior and just-right mood lighting.I rarely ever come to Hell's Kitchen. Between its proximity to Times Square and my lack of friends in the area, I just don't have much of a reason to be here. But, hey, I'm a bread guy now.

5.0,8/23/2013,"** The Summary **So I've been here four times now over a few years--once for a family brunch, once for a big group dinner, once for dessert and tea at a two-person table, and once for drinks and a nosh at the bar.  Taboon delivered, in every case.  It's a really versatile place, good for friends hanging out or a date.  Here and there they serve you a dud dish--never something bad, just something not great--but overall, the experience is consistently terrific.  I love this place.** The I-Was-Too-Lazy-To-Edit-Myself Details **Last time I went I sat at the bar:- They offer a full cocktail list with a Levantine twist--i.e., an apricot-ish cocktail called ""Meesh Meesh"", which is Hebrew for apricot, and an orangey gin drink called ""Gin Ginjee"", where ginjee is Hebrew for redhead/ginger.  We tried four or five in all, and results were... mixed-positive.  I kind of lost track, though, of which were just OK.- They have a few vodkas they infuse in-house.  I tried the lemon-verbena, on the rocks, because for some reason it seemed like a good idea to drink vodka that tastes like tea.  Surprisingly, it was not disgusting.  It was, in fact, pretty good.- The bar is a great place to eat, too.  The bartender doubled as a terrific waiter.  We didn't have a full three-course meal but we did pig out:From the bread menu:- Sambusak -- this is usually a cheese-filled pastry but at Taboon it translates into their amazing bread stuffed with feta and spice.  Delicious.- The bread with three dips. The bread is this restaurant's signature bread cooked in the taboon oven, and is a must.  The dips we tried: 1) Hummus: excellent. 2) Taramasalata: this is a salmon roe spread and was way too salty. I'd say skip it unless you know you like it. 3) Schoog: a cilantro-chilli-garlic salsa type thing that is really green and has a real spicy kick. Thumbs up.From the mezze menu (mezze are like Middle-Eastern tapas or banchan):- Red snapper ceviche topped with what amounts to tabbouleh.  Very good.- Crab salad: I don't know squat about the ol' fruits de mer, but my friend said this was a little dry.- Kube: This is a kind of a dumpling, I guess--a crumbly bulgar-wheat shell stuffed with steak, pine nuts, spices.  I've seen this spelled kube, koubbeh, and kibbe. It seems like everywhere you try it, kube is made differently.  Different shape, different size, different taste.  Taboon serves you a single piece, pretty large (three-four inches, maybe the size of a small fist).  Really good.  Maybe not to everyone's taste but worthwhile to try it.From the dessert menu:- The silan. Ice cream, topped and bottomed by pistachios, rice crispies, spindly shredded halva, and date honey. As mentioned in my prior review: BEST DESSERT. EVER.

I think when dining in any NYC restaurant, waiting 35min to receive your entree is totally unacceptable. I got pretty pissed and asked the waitress why our food is taking so long she replied it usually takes about 30min for entrees. Being that the wait was so long and the food wasn't that good (we had the branzino, which was bite-size and the steak) I won't be dining here again.",0,0,0,Inna S.,"New York, NY",1,22,5
4.0,8/10/2013,"Oh Taboon, Taboon, Taboon, how I wish I wasn't compelled to write this review...You are way too good of a well-kept secret, kept away from the masses all the way on 10th Ave to have hoards of people flocking to your delightful establishment.How delightful you ask? Well, let me tell you this: I ALWAYS attempt to try new restaurants during each Restaurant Week (RW) season. But Taboon is the ONLY one that has garnered a repeat visit from me.After falling in love last year, I came back to check out their summer RW menu. Most of the menu was exactly the same, which yes, doesn't exactly highlight their creativity, but hey, if it's that good...fine by me!To start, we got complimentary freshly baked focaccia served with a trio of accompaniments: hummus, baba ghanoush, and tzaziki sauce*. While all three were delish, the tzaziki sauce was the clear star - it was all I could do to keep myself from licking all of it off the plate (seriously). And man that bread...so soft, fluffy, and flavorful...we had to get another one!Then as appetizers, we sampled the smoked paprika shrimp (tried and loved last year) and the zucchini cakes (a new addition). Surprisingly, the shrimp wasn't as phenomenal as I had remembered. Yes, they were perfectly cooked, but I thought the flavor was a teensy bit lacking. Zucchini cakes though were AMAZING - highly recommend.For our mains, we shared the branzino and the chicken taboon. Both were cooked to perfection. I was only sad that the branzino portion was a half filet as part of the RW menu instead of the full filet they serve normally. So if you're starving, probably not the best option, although you might not care since it's so damn delicious.Dessert was the perfect end to our meal - both the silan and the chocolate cardamom mousse were outstanding.I should mention that Taboon did have one slight negative - we were made to sit at the bar because we didn't have a reservation, but there were literally PLENTY of tables open...but didn't matter too much because the amazing bartender took excellent care of us!See you next RW season Taboon!-----------------------* You get one bread and trio of dips for every 2 people :)",2,1,1,Nameeta K.,"New York, NY",237,188,10
3.0,8/2/2013,Food was mediocre.  Dish selection was good but overall execution was so so.  Sloppy wait staff.   Nice waitress with good suggestions.  But has to wrestle her helper for dessert.  He was very confused by the simplest task.  Bottom line: food needs more flavor.,0,0,0,Stephanie B.,"Lafayette, CA",6,85,6
1.0,7/29/2013,"I'm normally not a stickler for service. In fact, I try my best to judge the reviews I write on Yelp based on the food solely. If it was solely on the food, I would give it a solid 4 stars. However, I have never been so poorly treated for a meal that costed well over $200. I had restaurant week today with my friends. We were originally a party of 5 and unfortunately, one of us couldn't make it and we actually didn't know that the fifth person wouldn't come until we had already taken our order. Evidently, Taboon had a large group come in after us and because we were a party of 5 that turned into a party of 4, we had inconvenienced you all SO much that our waitress (I have the name of the waitress so if management will take responsibility for this - PM me and I will gladly let you know) would come and tell us off for having not told you sooner than our fifth member wasn't coming. She was practically giving us the middle finger in my opinion.  I literally quote that she said that next time, we should know better and tell them beforehand. Things happen and I even politely said we would move to the table of four since you seemed so inconvenienced by it. You said it was fine and yet you gave me the worst service possible. By the way, the restaurant was NOT full so I don't think you had to have that much of a problem accommodating them. After realizing that we were now a party of four, we were ignored by the waitresses and the food came painstakingly slow. The water was NEVER refilled and all of our glasses had 0 water in them by the time our meal was over. You came over to the table and took our plates but I guess you never noticed that we had no water left. I also felt you thought we were very young and perhaps that was why you thought you could treat us like this. We aren't that young and we all have full-time jobs, thank you very much. By the end of the meal, it was obvious that you didn't want us to be there. We weren't even halfway done with dessert before you threw the bill on our table. Then, asking for you to pack up the food, you walked away before you could even get the second plate. Absolutely pitiful. By the way, one of our friends is moving away from the country in about a week so thank you for the worst restaurant week experience possible.",12,0,0,Amy A.,"New York, NY",1,74,74

4.0,6/11/2013,"A friend who has eaten here often brought me here on a stormy rainy night.  Without a reservation the hostess kindly requested other bar patrons make room for us at the bar where we ended up having a very good time and meal. The bartender who served us was a redheaded delight and throughout the meal, while still terribly busy mixing drinks and attending to others at the bar, asked us how our dishes were and accommodated our special requests.  We ordered ""tapas"" style opting for 5 dishes rather than main courses.  The three dips we tried, two of them new to me, were very good.  The poached quail egg over scallops was a light delight and the mussels, which our bartender did opine can be different from chef to chef, as each adds his own touch, were delicious.  I also noticed that my top shelf martini was quite large and quite reasonably priced (don't tell them, but they could have charged much more for it).  I look forward to stopping by again as it is nice to find a new restaurant in what is fast becoming a ""go to"" area...Hells Kitchen, even along Tenth Avenue.  In the nice weather they have outdoor tables which probably helps as the place was very crowded as appears to usually be the case.  Next time we'll make reservations, but evidently, eating at the bar is a great option for those who show up without one.",0,0,0,Darren K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,25,0

I'm not sure how I feel about the combination of crab with feta cheese. However, I loved that there was no mayo and you could really taste the chunks of crab. The dish had lots of flavor. I also tried the trio of dips (hummus, tzaziki, red pepper spread which I thought was nothing special. The bread was delicious.

1.0,5/12/2013,"Let me tell you a frustrating story about a restaurant with superb food but dysfunctional  and down-right rude service.My siblings and I took my mom to this restaurant to celebrate Mother's Day today. It is one of my mother's favorite. We booked a table for 2:30pm, and when we arrived at 2:30 on the dot, we were asked to wait until our table was ready. Our square table, originally built and designed to accommodate up to four guests, was ready 20 minutes later and was supposed to accommodate our group of five. We waited another 5 minutes after asking the restaurant's staff to add another table so that we could all fit comfortably, and not have to squeeze together.Admittedly, this restaurant is always busy. Today was no different, and so we really did not expect service to be operating at it's peak. However, by the end of our meal, it is safe to say that I, along with my other family members, were completely shocked by what happened.We ordered some tapas and drinks from our very nice waitress. We had asked for butter, but were told that they do not serve butter anymore because they only have ""cooking"" and not ""fancy"" butter, and that too many customers had complained previously. I am a chef at the number three restaurant in New York City, and we serve ""cooking butter"" that has been salted. Just saying...My mother found her mojito to be ""too alcoholic"", and asked the waitress to fix it for her. The waitress fixed the issue within minutes, and we were very satisfied.We waited 40-45minutes for our entrees to arrive. When they finally came, my sister's shakshooka did not arrive with the feta cheese or bread that she ordered, and both my mom and sister, who had ordered steak & eggs, received a steak with no eggs. I had also ordered steak & eggs and managed to taste my steak before the drama started. To my dismay, the steak was broiled, not grilled as usual, and very much under-seasoned. My mother tried to attract the waitress's attention, but because the restaurant was so packed, it was very hard for her to do so. After five minutes of her food sitting there getting cold (as well as my sisters'), my mom got up to talk to the waitress. She was very firm and frustrated when she asked the waitress what had happened to our food, as I believe she had the right to be.The waitress, instead of addressing the issue, ran to her general manager to complain that a customer was ""yelling at her"" and that she would not address us any longer. The GM came over to our table, pretty much shaking with anger, leaned over to my mom and literally said: ""Before you start complaining again, I just want to let you know that I know who you are. Every time you come in here you yell - we have notes about your behavior in our files. You are never satisfied and you always behave in such an obnoxious manner. But yeah, what can I help you with this time?""Everyone around us turned their heads. I was perplexed. And really embarrassed. I  asked my mother to leave, and excused my siblings as well. I responded to the GM very respectfully, calling him out on his behavior as well. The eggs had just arrived (wrong order again - poached instead of over medium), and I made a note of this as well, just to hit my point home. I then got up and apologized to our waitress, who was very sweet and understood. She said she hadn't meant for the GM to react in such an unkind way.The GM never apologized, and actually continued to state, out loud for other guests to hear, about how problematic of a guest my mother is, and that he won't stand for it. He also, several times, mentioned that he was not scared of her and that her behavior was completely ridiculous. By the end, he had ""apologized"" once about the bad service and mix up. I write apologize in quotations because he followed up his apology with, ""I'm sorry that the kitchen screwed up your food, but I'm not going to deal with this shit anymore"". Nevertheless, the eggs came back wrong twice (poached, and then scrambled), and never came out over-medium like we had asked. We never actually got the food we paid for, nor the atmosphere that we deserved as paying customers, or the respect we deserved as human beings.Unfortunately, this is the last time that we will ever eat at Taboon. Like I've said, the food here is quite good, but the service has always been so-so, enough so that I won't frequent the restaurant more than once every two months, even though I live 4 blocks away. Moral of the story: I'm not saying you shouldn't eat here. What I am saying is make sure not to complain at all, even if you're dissatisfied with the food or service, or you'll be made center of attention and your meal, and subsequently your day, will be ruined.",0,0,0,Liz V.,"Manhattan, NY",1,9,0

1.0,3/10/2013,"I think that many of the good reviews are from ""restaurant week"", because if you pay the full price - there is NO chance in the world you'll think it's worth it.The restaurant is highly overpriced and the portions are just tiny, tiny, tiny. You can spend $40 and go out hungry. The food was not bad at all, but don't go there. There are so many better options especially in Hell's Kitchen. Service was OK but not on-par with their prices. They gave us one small bread for four people and each additional bread costs $4.50. So you order overpriced trio (baba-ganoush, hummus and tzaziki), tiny 3 dips for $11 and you have to order also bread on top. The kube was good, but one small piece for $12.50... huh?! Comm'on. I go to top restaurants and pay top prices, but expect also top food.Our experience yesterday was especially bad because the two toilets that they have were clogged. And in the time we were there, all of us had to go to the toilet (drinks, you know). The staff was very not impressed with it. There was no toilet on the premises!!!... Maybe it gives more of a med feeling of Syria, but it's not for $200 for 4 people who came out still not full. The mezes are not bad but are so tiny. Leave it, I don't feel like writing anymore. It's just a $$$$ restaurant serving cheap food in tiny portions. Wine and cocktails are also overpriced.

4.0,3/6/2013,"I came to Taboon with my friend after work as our last hurrah for NYC Restaurant Week. It was definitely a great choice!The cuisine here is ""Middleterranean,"" a hybrid between Middle Eastern and Mediterranean. The complimentary Taboon Bread Trio was amazing. The house focaccia was the perfect combination of crispy and fluffy, literally fresh out of their prominent wood oven (I learned that ""taboon"" actually means wood-fired oven in Arabic, so this is their signature thing). The Calamari appetizer was my favorite dish of the prix-fixe dinner. The Silan dessert was interesting and unlike anything I've had before, so I'd go with that if you're looking for something unique.The decor at Taboon is pleasant and inviting. The tile floor, white wood tables, white brick, and wood accents give it a casual vibe, but one that's classy, crisp, and clean. I liked the cinched sheer white curtains, and the candlelit tables just gave it a cozy appeal.Our server was friendly and attentive, and the dishes came out very promptly, but it didn't feel rushed.

She stated the bread was but not the dips. We sat down got the bread and it was delicious! We later saw another 2 bread loaves arrive.

We had a 20% gratuity added, which was plainly stated at the bottom of the menu for parties of 6 or more. NP! We put in part cash part CC. There was an extra 5$ paid in cash. Rather than give the customer the courtesy of over tipping or not by bringing change or asking if we wanted change she not only took the extra money but said we didn't over pay and it was exact etc. She later admitted her error and gave us the change...then upon putting on our coats, my friend who reviewed and dived the bill among us stated that we were charged for the extra 2 loaves of bread we didn't request. Yes we did eat them and didn't question since we were told they'd be complimentary. I was appaled! I spoke to the Manager who then went to review the bill in their system.

Situated on a corner, Taboon is surrounded by windows with flowing white curtains.  Its a little romantic and very classy.  A perfect spot for a date or even a gathering with friends.  Once side of the restaurant is a traditional dining room, while the other side is more cozy with a wood burning stove.  Perhaps this is why the bread was out of this world delicious.  I arrived early and took advantage of their two for one happy hour at the bar until 6pm.  Their cocktails are STRONG, so please drink responsibly.  Their wine selection is very nice as well - something for everyone.Once seated, the service was impeccable.  Everyone was nice, helpful and extremely attentive.  We ordered from the RW menu which featured a number of items suitable for all tastes.  A member of our party has a gluten allergy, so it was wonderful to learn that the server actually knew which items were best suited for her.  The first course was a shared focaccia styled bread, which was warm and straight from the oven.  Even alone this bread was delicious, but paired with their amazing humus, yogurt dip or chickpeas with feta - it was heavenly.  This is a nice added bonus to the RW menu.I ordered the Black Iron Shrimp, which was delicious.  It only comes with 2 shrimp but they were perfectly cooked and swimming in a yummy lemon butter sauce.  I definitely dipped some bread in this and could have used a spoon to sip the rest.  Yum!  My friends ordered the calamari and enjoyed it immensely. I got to try a bite and they were cooked perfectly - nice a tender. We all ordered the Hangar Steak with a baby turnip-potato puree and broccoli rabe.  It was out of this world delicious.  First off, it was plated beautifully and the steak was cooked to perfection - a nice medium rare.  This is how a good steak should be served.  It was probably between a 6 oz and 8 oz steak, a nice portion for RW.  The puree was sweet and complimented the juiciness of the steak.  The broccoli rabe was steamed, so it added a nice bitterness to the mean.  Plus its good to have a side of veggies to even out the protein and starch.  We couldn't stop talking about how amazing this dish was.  We were in steak heaven and cleaned our plates in 15 minutes.  I would have licked my plate clean if I could get away with it!For dessert, two of my friends ordered the trio of sorbet, which was lovely. A nice way to end a meal with a palate cleansing sorbet in unique flavors.  Another friend ordered the silan which she said was amazing.  I ordered the chocolate variation and loved it!  I can't eat ice cream, so my friend took advantage of this item on the dish.  Again, plating was beautiful.   Whatever it was that I was eating was mind blowing.  If you like chocolate, defintiely get this.  There was one scoop of dark chocolate ice cream, in the middle was a square of chocolate that was super rich and then this little chocolate sandwich with a crispy outside.  I have no idea what it was, but that thing was good - I want to be friends with it.  Except I ate the whole thing.Overall, it was a fabulous experience and I'd definitely come back to try other items off their regular menu.  I saw a few people ordering off the regular menu and the fish looked amazing.  This is a great special occasion restaurant or if you want to impress a date - this is perfect. Thank you, Taboon, for making your RW menu something to rave about.  It's rare to find a restaurant that takes this event seriously with exceptional cuisine and appropriate portions.",4,1,2,Jaci H.,"Brooklyn, NY",116,301,33
5.0,1/24/2013,"This was fantastic! Sometimes restaurants screw you on restaurant week, but the restaurant week menu included FABULOUS dishes. Everything was just perfect. It's a rarity when this happens. Waiting for my friends to all show we had a few drinks in which the cocktails were mixed to perfection. They also had Israeli wines and other selections, in which the Israeli white will be something I ask every restaurant for from now on. Once seated the waiter was incredibly attentive and the place was packed. It is a beautiful environment, everything white including the tables and it was candle lit. It is perfect for a date and also a place to go to with friends.From the start, everything put on the table even the starter bread was like heaven. Foccacia was served with several dips including a yogurt dip. Then there was calamari served over chickpeas, something I never would have though of, and the portions were just good enough so you don't feel overstuffed by the time the main course gets there.The main course was an absolutely mouth savoring Hanger Steak with just the right amount of spice used (I think it was some kind of Cumin) but juicy and PERFECT (my mouth is watering right now actually)The desert I had was ice cream served with shavings in rice Krispy treat-like crumbs.

2.0,1/9/2013,"A pleasant enough dining experience, and very well-made cocktails, but overall pricey for the level of grub and presentation. Taboon is the Arabic word for the domed oven used here to bake the puffy house flatbread that arrives shorty after you sit down (if you ask for more, btw, they'll charge you). That bread, which we paired with some delicious hummus, is served on a little butcher board, piping hot, golden brown and pooled on top with extra-virgin olive oil and a sprinkling of sage, rosemary, and sea salt. Omg. It's a kind of halfway point between focaccia and pizza. You can gobble it whole, or dip it in a bowl of tzatziki or enjoy it in tandem with any one of 12 inventive varieties of meze, or appetizers. But the general quality of the food was erratic. The falafel app was four sublimely seasoned balls, crunchy on the outside but not at all dry within. Each had a sort of pickled mango squib atop it, a surprising and welcome blend of tartness and sweetness. My friend's branzino entree was decent but boring, and the portion was small. My lamb osso bucco was a braised shank cooked to fall-off-the bone perfection served in a dry, tasteless stew of faro, glazed carrots and green peas. These were dishes just above the level of an Israeli cafeteria, and had no business being served in a Manhattan restaurant that charges these prices. I recall liking the restaurant's ambience. It's situated on a corner lot in a relatively tranquil patch of Hell's Kitchen (I refuse to say Clinton), which means two walls of white-curtained windows and an airy, open, lulling feel.",1,0,0,James D.,"New York, NY",1,70,58
1.0,1/6/2013,"I never write reviews but this disappointment was too big to pass up. If I were going by food alone I'd say Taboon deserves 3 stars but since the last thing that I experienced before ending my night was the horrible general manager, it gets 1. Trust me, if I could award a 1/2 star I would. What ever happened to the good old saying ""the customer is always right?"" After choosing the restaurant week menu we ordered some cocktails then on the waitress' recommendation we each got a glass of wine. Long story short, we get the bill at the end of the evening and the $13 glasses of wine ended up being $26 more than the actual bottle would have been. We inquired about the cost of the bottle and the waitress very politely said she was going to talk to the manager to see what she could do. The GM comes storming over and starts verbally attacking us asking if ""we did the math"" and didn't understand what we expected her to do. She got loud defensive and argumentative as though we had asked her to pay for our entire meal. When she was asked to please stop being condescending she got even louder, turned her back to that guest and tried pleading her case to me. She rolled her eyes and said ""what do you want me to do, take one glass off will that make you happy?!"" out of principle I replied yes. When she returned with the check reflecting $13 less, she threw the check on the table and walked away. If you scroll up to the other 1 star reviews they all reflect this manager.

4.0,12/23/2012,"Tonight was my second time dining at Taboon- my first had been years ago with my Dad and I can only recall stuffing my face with delicious cheese filled breads and leaving uncomfortably full.  I really love Taboon's warm and charming atmosphere- it pairs perfectly with the type of Mediterranean food that they serve.  My parents went through about two orders of their house bread with eggplant.  I was saying NO to bread tonight, so I didn't have any- but they said it was just alright (they would have preferred the bread less oily).  I'm sure the Sambusak is delicious (from what I can remember last time), but it is definitely heavy and that isn't what we were going for tonight.  I had really been craving lamb and so I went with the Lamb Duo.  I had both the lamb patties and chops cooked medium well- both were very tasty (I preferred the patties over the chops tonight).  They were seasoned with mint and set on top of a root vegetable stew with lentils.  The dish was well executed- nice presentation, perfect portion size, and overall good flavor.  My parents thoroughly enjoyed the soup of the day and the Chicken Taboon.  We finished off the night with Moroccan Mint Tea with fresh nana leaves- yum!My only complaint is that the hostess was very rude- my parents had a simple question about the check and she was very nasty.  Anyway, I'd like to come back for brunch!",4,0,1,Danielle M.,"New York, NY",396,512,41
4.0,12/18/2012,"Taboon had very good food and good service but loses a star because of some nickel and diming.The place is cozy and the table for 2 is just a little to small. Overall though there is a nice quiet atmosphere.We split the Taboon trio-hummus, tzaziki, and shoog.Neither the GF nor I had ever had shoog before but it sounded very good.  A mix of cilantro, mint, jalepeno, and some other spices. The waitress asked if we had ever had it and informed us that it is very spicy and we might want to consider mixing it with the tzaziki to cool it off.This was an excellent suggestion. The Shoog was spicy but good. when mixed with the tzaziki (which was independently fantastic) it had a great flavor and only mild heat.The hummus was also good but a bit salty.The trio came with an order of fresh made delicious bread, but its really not enough and you'll want another order. Unfortunately, bread is not complimentary. Its 4.50 per order. Similarly, if you opt for a soda (we got cokes) do not expect refills, but for the coke it was at least glass bottle coke (i know because the bring you the bottle) so it was somewhat worth it.This also seems like a good time to mention that the water does not come with ice, and it was room temp. I did not ask for ice though, so maybe this could have been fixed.Back to the food-Entrees:She got the vegetarian grill- good flavor, but a bit lacking in the two most exciting parts of the disk-goat cheese and chickpea gnocchi. A little bit more of both would have been nice. But she liked the dish overall.I got the hanger steak. The steak was a much more generous portion than I would have expected. Perfectly cooked mid-rare and delicious. It came with potatoes that were good, nothing to write home about, and another side that i couldn't identify but was quite good. it tasted of beets but with a different texture.Dessert-We split the goat cheese cake. The portion was small, but its about what you should expect from this type of restaurant. It was very good- more savory and creamy than a regular cheesecake but still sweet. It came with a fig sauce that was quite good as well. a delicious desert and definitely recommended.OVERALL:Good ambiance, good food, portions are about what you would expect but sometimes are surprisingly large. Helpful and polite wait staff. It loses a star because of the extra charge for bread and soda refills, the warm water, and because it is just a tad bit overpriced on some items (not enough to stop me from coming back though.)",0,0,0,Jon D.,"Buffalo, NY",2,11,0

3.0,11/19/2012,"Went there Saturday night with a party of 8 at 7:30. When we made the reservation, we were required to do prix fixe...almost a deal breaker but a new mom in the area preferred to stay close to home so we went with it. It took a while for them to bring the appetizer course and when they did, we were disappointed. 2 small flat breads and a tray of 3 small dips for 8 people? They could have easily doubled that. Then, a bunch of tasty Middle Eastern salads and seafood, about 6 plates and each plate was a small portion. Not so great for sharing, particularly when we had no choice of what we were receiving.  The tell tale sign was that one of the plates was 3 tiny zucchini cakes. Delicious, but how do 8 people split 3 mini cakes? We asked our server and she said split it however you want to split it. ??  We expressed that we were dissatisfied with such a small appetizer course since we were forced to do prix fixe! Shouldn't there be at least one appetizer per person?  She was rude in responding and made it seem like we were asking for something unreasonable.  We then asked her to bring another plate of zucchini cakes out and she did with an attitude.The main courses were good.The hangar steak was not the best, but the fish was excellent.  I was happy to see WILD sea bass on the menu, and I enjoyed the authentic flavors of my hreme dish. For dessert, each person was allowed to order one dessert and they brought out an extra one? It seems they were trying to make it up to us which we appreciate but I think the better way to have done this would be to fix the first course and not give us an attitude when we asked.The place is pretty, filled with a lot of middle aged people on a Saturday evening so not the most fun place but the food is pretty good albeit expensive.  The only problem is, at $60/head they should really be more generous with the appetizer course, particularly the breads, salads and dips! It left a little bit of a bad feeling in our mouths in what otherwise was a pretty good meal.Doubtful that we will be going back with all the other excellent Middle Eastern options in the city.  I think they could improve on their service and ditch the lame prix fix policy or at least do it better.",1,0,0,Marisa J.,"New York, NY",1,27,0

2.0,11/11/2012,"Taboon is the prototypical NYC place that gets far more praise than it deserves.  The quality of the food is very good overall, but when you look at the bill, and the quality, and the quantity, at least I can't help but feel like there's no connection between what you get, and how much you pay.  The best example of this is their Kube.  Being myself middle eastern, this is one of my favorite appetizers.  Theirs was nothing special, though not bad  But for $12.50 I was hoping that it could at least be an appetizer for two!  Hardly enough for on, unfortunately.  I was with 3 others, all of whom were equally surprised by that one.  Same goes for the two spoons of rice for $6.  At a comparable Pesian restaurant, you can get a plate of amazing Basmatti rice for about $12, and have about 6 times that much rice.The lamb fell off the bone, as promised by the waiter, and it was indeed good.  I also liked the Branzino, and for $32 it was overpriced but enjoyable.The service was fine.  They seated us in an awkward table in the back, very poorly laid out where half of us had to face a wall, even though there were other tables for 4 available.  Bill came to $45/person for 2 salads, 2 entrees, 2 appetizers, 1 dessert, a coffee and a glass of wine.Dessert is probably what Taboon does best.  I can see myself going back there for dessert and coffee if I feel like splurging.  But dinner is far too overpriced for my taste.  At other comparably expensive places, I come out feeling like I get what I pay for, e.g. Barolo.  Others I've spoken with who like Taboon also say they avoid going because of the cost.  It's a nice place, but if I'm hauling myself to 10th Ave, I would at least hope to not overpay.",1,0,0,Dave B.,"Manhattan, NY",4,96,0

5.0,8/13/2012,"RESTAURANT WEEK REVIEW!My wife and I made a point to try Taboon during RW week because we'd heard great things about it but don't consistently love Middle-Eastern food. Thankfully, our meal may have been the best reasonably-priced dinner I've had in NYC. The food was fantastic, portions were nice (especially for the RW menu), and service was great.The bread is extremely delicious and yet it is built up SO highly by all my fellow reviewers that I must say in my mind it is a little bit overrated. But still awesome. The three dips were all great, but the feta/red pepper was my favorite.I had the Black Iron Shrimp as an appetizer, which was delicious and perfectly cooked, but had only two shrimp - this may have just been a smaller Restaurant Week portion? My wife got a very good-sized bowl of the Greek Yogurt Gazpacho which was very delicious.Samantha had the Daily Market Veggie Plate for her entree; it was very good and fresh, and the gnocchi was wonderful, and yet there was still maybe something missing - it just seemed a little bit plain overall. My Chicken Taboon was spectacular: a very large, perfectly cooked tender chicken breast, and the flavors of the chicken, potatoes, beans, and sauce went perfectly together. I'd very highly recommend this dish!For dessert, I had the Silan, which was delicious and very fun/unique - it tasted like a fresher, grown-up Rice Krispie Treat! Samantha got the lava cake, which was great, but the coffee ice cream it came with stole the show. Best coffee flavored ice cream I've ever tasted.We had a bottle of a Dom Sigalas blend from Santorini, which was actually our favorite wine during a tasting tour we did there last year but is not very easy to find in the US. So we were excited about that and it went very well with the meal.There are so many amazing restaurants in this city and I always want to try as many new places as I can, but I will DEFINITELY be going back to Taboon in the future!",0,0,2,Robert H.,"Glen Rock, NJ",8,38,0

The staff I spoke with to arrange the group reservation was so friendly and professional. The wait staff at the restaurant was first class: friendly, warm, attentive, knowledgeable, and just terrific. The food was excellent as usual. The zucchini cakes are amazing, and I had a wonderful steak dish. The steak was done perfectly and was yummy. The restaurant also did a terrific job of offering our group a fixed price menu, and we really enjoyed the selection of appetizers the restaurant chose for us. We got to try almost every appetizer on the menu, and all really loved the tasting and testing. Most of the group had not been to Taboon before, and all said they are excited to come back. So am I. When you recommend a restaurant to a group, it's not as if you're in the kitchen doing the cooking, and I think people would be forgiving if the food wasn't great, BUT when you recommend a place, and the food and service rock, as they did last night at Taboon, well..you just feel great.

3.0,8/8/2012,"Restaurant Week Review:The Place - Modern, a big spartan but comfortable, and overkill on the mood lighting. Kinda enjoyed being seated by the prep area and its giant, fire-belching oven.The Food: The RW week menu came with a miniaturized version of the three dips (a hummus with a spicy kick that was a little too runny, a delicious cheese and red pepper spread, and a simple tzaziki yogurt dip). Probably the best part of the meal was the bread...I know...the BREAD of all things! It was fresh out of the oven, moist, nicely-oiled with an excellent blend of herbs and spices on top. In a self-defeating move, we ended up order a second order of the bread and dips (This time, a large portion). 5/5Appetizer - Greek yogurt gazpacho with crab meat. Admittedly, the crab meat is more of a garnish in this dish than an ingredient, but the texture was a nice blend of cream and tomato, yet still light and refreshing. 4/5The main course? The lamb mint kebabs. 3/5. These were your run-of-the-mill kofte, but sadly, overcooked. The presentation with the chopped tomato and garnish was very nice, but the bf and I were just really under-whelmed. Dessert was the chocolate lava cake with Turkish coffee ice cream. 2/5. The lava cake was nice and chocolatey but just really average. I would have enjoyed the Turkish coffee ice cream (Had a nice kick too it), except that it melted in about five seconds, so that you were left with a big goopy mess. I may gave them a visit again after checking Yelp for entree recommendations, because the lamb mint kebabs were just a real let-down but I see the creativity and flair for flavor in some of the other dishes.",0,0,0,Rahul P.,"Jersey City, NJ",12,115,0

5.0,7/10/2012,"This is one of mine (and my husband's) favorite restaurants in Manhattan. Been going here for years since it opened and when I lived in Hells Kitchen. Now that we're on the UES we still make sure to make our way here for dinners often. The food is delicious - the house focaccia or the Sambusak (stuffed with feta) is amazing along with the hummus, tzatziki, and shoog. The entrees are great (love the Heraime) and the Silan Sundae is our favorite dessert. We loved the Silan so much that we had them serve it at our Wedding! We were there for dinner one night, raving again about how much we love the Silan and how great it would be to have it as a dessert at our wedding since it was our favorite. We spoke to the manager (Kate) and she happily made it happen! This is my first Yelp review because this is the only restaurant I felt compelled to write a review. Not only is the food amazing, the staff is outstanding. Kate (the manager) is wonderful and made our wedding extra special by personally making sure that everything went smoothly with the Silan dessert.

The decor is really nice and the place has a great ambience with the big oven in the middle of the restaurant.  The wait staff was attentive and helpful the entire evening.  As an appetizer we had a trio of dips consisting of a red pepper spread, tzatziki, and a jalapeno spread... served with the fresh baked bread, they were amazing!!  We had to stop ourselves from ordering more of the bread so that we had room for dinner!  Our entrees consisted of the beef tchouma and a fish special, both were delicious!  Even though we were stuffed, we were so impressed by the food we had to try dessert. We tried a greek yogurt panacotta type dessert, which was spectacular.

3.0,5/17/2012,I came here for a birthday dinner and let's just say I was hungry after the meal. The only thing memorable was the sea scallop they served which was only a ONE piece in a little pot. It was a delicious little morsel but a shame it's only one little guy. Keep in mind the platters are very small so you may think you're ordering a lot of food but you won't be seeing much in those plates. The pita was fresh since they make it right there in the front of the restaurant so it's piping hot when it arrives to your table. A solid 3 stars because the dishes are edible but tiny in portions and the waitress wasn't very attentive so that took some charm away from the establishment.,1,0,0,KL Z.,"Manhattan, NY",2,107,42

5.0,4/30/2012,"Summary: Deliciously unexpected.  Fantastic service.  A must try for the neighborhood.The Atmosphere:  There is some outdoor seating, but the windows in the main dining area allow for plenty of light.  The seating near the door is quite dark if you had a heavy night out and don't want to be near the sunlight.  Tables are painted white, which makes for a delightfully modern surface.The Crowd:  Taboon is the type of place that reminds you that Hell's kitchen is gentrifying. One of the trendier brunch spots for sure.  You can look nice here, or you can come with morning face. Your choice.  If you're of the rainbow, you will be pleasantly surprised.The Service:  We had a lovely new waiter.  By lovely, I mean, possibly one of the most perfect looking people I've seen in the city in a while. He was so textbook good looking that even my straight bf admitted he was attractive.  As he's not my type and also I'm not convinced I had a better chance than my bf, I'm sending out the love to the Yelp community.  (He works Sunday brunch, in case you are curious and want to see if he's single).  Despite being brand new, he was excellent and others in management checked in regularly to make sure we were up on coffee and the like. The food:  YUM!!!  Wow. I don't even really like hummus and I have to rave about the hummus and bread.  I had the Crab Benedict.  They used real crab meat.  The mixture with the spinach and hollandaise sauce was truly delightful.  I even quite liked the dressing on the salad. There was a shrimp in a pan brunch dish was fantastic.  It's smaller and you will want to dip the bread into the sauce in order to be full.  It was tasty enough that I didn't actually care that the portion size was smallish.",5,8,13,May L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",617,466,229

We got the appetizer platter featuring the four different dips (hummus, baba ghanoush, etc.). These were pretty good, but the standout of the meal was the lamb kebab. It was really more like 4 savory lamb meatballs resting on a bed of smokey eggplant and tomato-mint salad. My friend and I still talk about this dish.

It's puréed chickpeas with some average flavor added - meh.  I had the eggs taboon with asparagus and Parmesan.  Eggs were over cooked (so easy to do that I'm almost more amazed when they're done right) and they were served on bread that was kind of rubbery.  Unimpressed.Did enjoy the bottomless mimosa but the sorbets for dessert were just average.Lovely room with whitewashed tables and comfortable atmosphere - may try again because a good friend loves the place but I wouldn't rush to go back.,0,1,1,Liz F.,"Chicago, IL",2,97,0

The dishes are visually exquisite but the taste is missing that extra little dimension that makes it unforgettable... especially for the price tag. Yes, the house focaccia is crispy and fresh and quite satisfying when dipped into the hummus. Yes, the osso bucco falls off the bone -- but the flavor doesn't permeate the entire piece of meat. The juice from the dish was tasty, however, and I devoured the accompanying faro, carrots, and peas. The decor is very romantic, candle-lit tables, dimmed lights. You get the sense that many of the diners are regulars... but honestly, the quality (and price) didn't merit that kind of dedication in my opinion.

(the hostess , who I think was new...)) Not to mention we ordered 3...so what do you have to say now?  Yes, thank you for letting us stay at this table...) Our waitress saved the day here.  Kudos to her.  (She even spoke Israeli with one of our guests on a subsequent visit.  Love.)Drink menu is unique and uses a lot of untraditional flavours.  The aesthetic is warm, romantic and friendly.  Appropriate for a date or group of friends.  Call ahead, they take reservations and space fills up pretty quick on peak nights.I have seen Taboon change throughout the years, but her established vision and mission has not wavered.",3,0,0,Joey R.,"New York, NY",352,319,116

I'm glad we did because I was starving and really didn't feel like walking any further to look for food. They have a lot of delicious items available for brunch, so it was a hard decision, but I settled on the Crab Benedict. My boyfriend chose the Eggs Taboon with lox and goat cheese. Both dishes were scrumptious (however, my Crab Benedict could have been a little warmer). The waitress suggested we get the French Toast for dessert, she said it would be the best French Toast we've ever had. We were sold.

3.0,1/26/2012,"Just got back from Taboon. Went for restaurant week with my boyfriend for dinner.Quality:     Appetizer:The tatziki was definitely above average, no complaints around the baba ganoush, and the schoog was good. Then again, I've never had schoog anywhere else. The foccacia bread that came with the dips was very good - salt, rosemary, olive oil on top. The bf had the shrimp - two shrimps with a little piece of bread in a skillet with a lemon butter sauce. He said the sauce was delicious and full of butter.     Entree:Speaking of butter, I had the grilled vegetable plate which must have contained at least half a stick of butter. The dish was completely unimaginative - anyone can put butter on vegetables for crying out loud. I expect something more interesting when I am going to an ethnic restaurant (Israeli). I have to give them credit, though, the veggies were cooked to a perfect consistency. They put three little gnocchi (? I think they were supposed to be gnocchi) on the plate, which tasted bad. Can't put my finger on why exactly. My boyfriend had the lamb kebabs, and his only comment was that even though it was lamb, it tasted like it could've been beef.     Dessert: I had silan, which was delicious but a little too sweet. I am definitely a dessert person, so if I think it was too sweet then I can only imagine how much sugar was in it. My boyfriend had a chocolate mousse, which was really good. Definitely recommended.     Drinks:I had Meesh Meesh, or something like that, and Nefertiti's kiss. Both tasted great and were expertly garnished. My bf had a Gin Gingee, which he liked a lot. Contained alcohol, but not strong.Quantity:Appetizer - small but passable. Entree - pathetic. Dessert - ok, although maybe at this point I just anticipated that I wouldn't be served more than three bites. Great restaurant for dieters. But if you're like me, and when you plunk down a chunk of change at a restaurant you want some leftovers, don't do it. To be fair, restaurant week may have affected portion sizes. I sure hope so, because if I was paying the asking price for my entree I might have thrown a fit when I saw how small it was.Ambiance:Very cute! Loved it! Very nice bathrooms. I was going to give them two stars, but ""Meh. I've had better."" does not apply to the bathrooms at Taboon. Rivaled only by Morimoto.Service:Excellent. Very attentive and knowledgeable wait staff. The waitress (don't know her name, but she was dressed a little funky with big earrings) made some good recommendations for my drinks. Seems like my water glass got refilled every time I had a sip. They fold your napkins when you go to the bathroom. No errors on our order. The only problem I had with the service, which was the management's fault and not the wait staff, was that no reservations were available after 5:30 and before 9:45, so we went for 5:30. Yet when we left a bit after 7, there were plenty of open tables! So why no reservations available at a reasonable hour?Overall, if I was in the neighborhood, I might return and order meze only.

The watermelon salad was ridiculous (small chunks of watermelon and even tinier flecks of feta, and for $14? Really?!). 4.  The bread was nicely baked but should be served in bigger amounts for an order of hummus; having to buy more and more pieces of bread is absurd (and at $3.50 per order? again, really?!). 5.  The ice cream dessert was fine but again, very small and at $10, laughably overpriced.

4.0,9/10/2011,"Came here for Restaurant Week early in August and despite a few initial reservations, my experience was much better than I had anticipated.Made early reservations but had one person in our group running late.  Only minor blip was that hostess came over and tried to rush us with a mean glare but I can let that slide.  Taboon had a pretty wide Restaurant Week selection.  Black Iron Shrimp was a decent appetizer but was a bit too small for my liking.  It was a pretty large mini-skillet but only a couple pieces of shrimp.  Would've preferred a few more pieces for an appetizer.  The Branzino entree was excellent.  Went for the filet rather than the whole fish (don't want to be digging through bones for the rest of my meal).  The fish had a great lemon flavor and no fishy aftertaste whatsoever.  When we got to dessert, they had to substitute a chocolate lava cake instead of the chocolate mousse cake but I'm glad they did that.  The chocolate lava cake was amazing and presented very well.  The scoop of Turkish coffee ice cream also packed a nice punch to compliment the chocolate.We did order a couple things off the restaurant menu.  The Sambusak (stuffed foccacia) was awesome and way better than the regular bread they served with the meal.  Also had foie gras, which was just that...nothing special to call home about.Service was also surprisingly great at Taboon.  Everything came out fairly quickly and there was minimal waiting for food.  A waiter came by to clear plates and brush off crumbs for every new course.  They even made an effort to push chairs in and re-fold napkins when you go leave for the restroom...nice touch.Overall, Taboon is a really nice choice whether it's Restaurant Week or not.  It's a good place for a nice small gathering or intimate dinner with great Mediterranean food and good service.",1,0,0,Kevin L.,"NY, NY",20,135,143

It was a hot day in the city and the restaurant was very cool with a nice ambiance.The appetizers, first off, were phenomenal. Try their hummus-- it's fantastic.

We were five minutes late for our reservation and had to wait another ten, which was marginally annoying, but not at all a big deal. The decor was very modern, clean, and white while kind of homey at the same time in the prep/oven area. This contrast seemed to pop up multiple times as we were bordered by one table filled with chic models while a family was out to dinner on another side of us. Our waitress was fantastic! She was so attentive and personable, she vastly improved our entire experience there. The food was fantastic overall! They started us off with their special focaccia bread, hot out of the oven with these three amazing dips, all of which were polished off. The humus was excellent, the caviar dip was delicious and had just the right strength of taste, while the tzaziki sauce was far and away the best. I had to restrain myself from using my finger to clean out the dish they were served in. The appetizers were both great, we got this gazpacho, with the perfect balance of taste and cool lightness, and the watermelon salad, which apparently is mostly watermelon. My girlfriend's main course was unbelievable; the vegetarian grill. Each and every part of it was unique and they all combined into the best vegetarian dish to ever grace my taste buds. I stand guilty of food thievery. Alas, my lamb kebabs not good, but were the only disappointing part of the meal (ok our drinks were kind of watery too). The kebabs were over-salted and the eggplant was awful, but I think that's more on me, I just wasn't aware I hated roasted eggplant. The desserts were really good and excellent. We got the chocolate lava cake, which I've found is universally a good choice, and the silan, which was ice cream with halva, honey, puffed rice crunchies, and pistachios. It was simple and delectable. My mouth just started watering as I wrote this.  Overall it was a great place and definitely an excellent find.

I came here for dinner during restaurant week, and the food didn't disappoint. I especially loved the hummus they serve here. DELICIOUS. I ordered the chicken (yummm!) and a falafel appetizer (which isn't that memorable). Our waiter told us that they were sold out of some sorta chocolate mousse or some other chocolatey dessert but was going to replace it with a chocolate lava cake. After hearing that I was on board with that dessert! I love chocolate lava cake! However, this one was a little too sweet, but you can't really go wrong with chocolate lava cake unless you absolutely hate chocolate. The decor in here is sooo cute, everything is white. Sadly, this category led me to knock off a star- the floor and the table (because of the chipped paint) doesn't look that clean. There was live music playing in there and it was beautifully played and really fit the atmosphere of this cute little joint.

Yes, it was restaurant week (which we did not know) and yes, they were crowded.We made the reservation for 5 people at 7:30 about two weeks in advance. After our entire party arrived at approximately 7:25, we waited another 20 minutes or so to be seated; awkwardly standing in between the door and the bar, with no place to wait, being sneered at by staff.Finally, we were seated. 5 people at a 4 person table, squished in a corner. Hardly the birthday dinner we had expected.When we asked the manager that night why we were being crammed at a table obviously too small for our party, the unpleasant (really, lets be blunt, straight up RUDE) woman rolled her eyes, told us there was nothing she could do and threw the menus down in front of us.Now, I am a self-proclaimed foodie. I live, breathe and dream food. I KNOW good food, and I have been to Taboon before and was impressed.

3.0,7/15/2011,"2011 RESTAURANT  WEEK REVIEW I came here Wednesday night for dinner. We had a reservation for 5:30 but I wanted to see if I could get us in a little later and they were able to accomdate that. Our reservation was moved to 6, but part of the deal was that they were going to need the table back at 8 pm which gave us more than enough time (or so we thought). They started us with some complimentary bread:Taboon Bread Flight: house focaccia, hummus, tzaziki, taramosalata The bread was fresh and warm, straight from the oven. All three dips were delicious. I'm a big tzaziki lover and a picky one at that, their tzaziki was right up to my standards, a lot of dill but not over powering. All three of us got the Pita Falafel for our AppsHomemade pita bread with roasted golden potatoes, falafel with amba & Nablus tahini, finished with mixed herb salad.Now I get it's RW so the portions are going to be a little smaller but the falafels were the size of size dollars and you only got two. When they say finished with an herb salad, they mean a few pieces of cilantro thrown on top. I will say, the amba, was very good. It almost reminded me of  mango puree and while you wouldnt think it goes with the dish it paired very well with it. Dipping the potatoes in it was very good. The falafel had good flavor to it but I've definately had better in the city, bigger portions and a lot more flavorful! For our entrees: I got the Branzino (filet) Mediterranean branzino baked whole in the taboon with rosemary and served with cauliflower, tahini and taboon grilled asparagusThis was a nice size piece of fish. They cut the fish just enough to sneak in some rosemary and hunks of garlic which gave the fish the perfect amount of flavor. The cauliflower seemed to be roasted and seasoned and on top was one piece of asparagus covered in tahini. They complimented each other very well. My friends both got the Lamb KebabsGround Colorado lamb kebabs served over roasted eggplant, Nablus tahini and a fresh tomato, mint and cilantro saladIt was three decent size lamb meatballs served over a nice salad. They said the lamb was full over flavor and very enjoyable. For dessert, we were able to get all three which really made me happy: Silan: Vanilla ice cream layered with puffed rice and date honey sprinkled with caramelized pistachios and topped with shredded halvaThis one was my favorite. The puffed rice with date honey made it so sweet and savory that I didn't want to share it with the rest of the table. Chilled Pineapple Soup: Frozen yogurt, fresh mint and lemon zestThis dessert was very refreshing. It like having summertime dance around in your mouth. It's not so much a soup but more of a pineapple infused frozen yogurt. I highly recommend this. They were out of their chocolate mousse dessert so they replaced with it with a chocolate molten lava cake. Which was your standard pretty much but served with coffee ice cream. The presentation of this dish was outstanding. The decor of this restaurant was very nice. It has somewhat of a rustic feel to it, it's clean lines and very simple.  They do have outdoor seating which is also really nice. The service wasn't my favorite. Our waitress was great but I wasn't a fan of everyone else who helped us out that evening. While they needed the table back at 8 pm for another party, we didn't leave til 8:30 because it took quite a while for our food to come out and when it was time for us to go the were really rushing us saying that they needed the table and that they had informed us of this.

4.0,2/25/2011,"I came here on a Monday night with a party of 8 for Restaurant Week. It was a great atmosphere and the staff was super friendly. They checked in on us just the right amount, and even helped us take a group picture at the end of our meal. We started with the bread plate, which came with hummus, tzaziki, and smoked eggplant Greek yogurt. I couldn't get enough of the dips!   Most of the time I have food envy, but this time my Husband was trying to steal my food (Sautéed Calamari, Duck Breast, and Silan Dessert). My Husband ordered the ""Sea Scallops"", which was very deceiving because it only came with 1 scallop. It was good, but for how much you're spending it didn't seem worth it. I had the Sautéed Calamari served on a bed of shaved fennel and yogurt, which I thought was delicious and worth it! For the main dish, my Husband and my Sister-in-Law had the Halibut. Both said the fish was kind of tough and they were disappointed. While those at the table that ordered the duck breast were very happy! It was amazing, and I couldn't get enough. For dessert, I got the Silan (vanilla ice cream layered with puffed rice & date honey sprinkled with caramelized pistachios and topped with shredded halva) amazing! Some people at our table ordered the Milk Cardamom Chocolate Mousse, which they didn't finish because it was too rich. My Husband had the Sorbets. One of the flavors was Pistachios, some berry flavor, and we couldn't figure out the last one.",0,0,0,Gina H.,"Mercer Island, WA",50,86,133
5.0,2/21/2011,My husband and I first ate here on a trip to NYC in 2006. We've talked about this restaurant since that first visit and just went back the other night (Feb 2011) -- happy to say it's still delicious!!  Highly recommend the falaffel appetizer -YUM!  Lamb kabobs are delicious!  I had the red snapper and it was excellent. I think what makes this a 5 star review is their consistency of deliciousness as well as the amazing combination of flavors that are in each dish.

It has a nice cozy feel and I thought it was quite comfortable. The only thing I disliked was that I felt like the waitress was being really pushy on having us order more drinks. The restaurant week menu was pretty decent. We started our meal with warm bread and a sample hummus platter.  For appetizer I had the scallop which was perfectly cooked surrounded by a moat of tomato sauce that was very delicious as well. I ordered the duck as my entree and that was not too bad either. The mash potatoes was so fine and creamy that it looked more like a sauce. Finally, the best part of all was dessert. I had the parfait and it was amazing. The texture of the yogurt foam was delicate and just sweet enough but not too sweet. and pieces of fruits emphasized the taste and the texture.

2.0,2/9/2011,"I went to Taboon with 2 friends for restaurant week. It was a very disappointing experience overall. Here is a breakdown:Service was mediocre:- we had to specifically request the restaurant week menus from the waitress. When we did, she said ""oh, you want the restaurant week menus? Oh, ok."" it was a bit weird since it was the last Friday in restaurant week...why was she pretending she didn't know?- the restaurant week menu included bread and humus but we had to request it and it did not arrive until after our appetizers. We were given one serving of bread to share and were charged for extra servings (so cheap!)- after my appetizer plate was cleared, my new cutlery was thrown in front of me.- at the end of the evening, the wait staff rudely told us that they were closing so they would like us to leave.I don't have high needs in terms of service but I do expect to feel welcome and receive courteous service, especially when going out for a nice meal. Food was not that good:- I had the beet salad, which was not that well seasoned and just ok. I have had better.- the bass was extremely disappointing. The fish was dry and smothered in an over-salted tomato sauce.- one of my  friends had the grilled vegetables and said they were also over salted.- the sea scallop was over dressed and over cooked.The best parts?Cocktails, dessert, and the bread with hummus was really tasty (once we got it) I wouldn't go to Taboon again and wouldn't recommend it either.",0,0,0,B J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0
4.0,2/7/2011,"Went here with a group of 7 for a birthday celebration during Restaurant Week. The place was really beautiful inside - great ambiance. The menu for RW was delicious. Only problem was all week I had been waiting to try the ""Sea Scallops"" as my appetizer and when it came out, as I should have guessed, it was 1 sea scallop. No ""s"" at the end there. Nonetheless it was delicious - perfectly cooked, the tomato sauce around it just divine. The entree of sea bass was amazing with cous cous on the side. Dessert was equally yummy. Everyone got something different so we tasted it all and from the chocolate mousse to the fruit parfait it was yummy!I have to say, though, my favorite part were the cocktails. DELICIOUS! Expensive, but worth it. Quite potent so 1 could do the job but they were well crafted works of fruity, delicious art :)I'd recommend going here during RW. Don't know if I'd pay full boat load for the meals as I know several less expensive places that serve similar food downtown, but it was worth the try, most definitely, during RW. The service once we all got there was fine. 2 of the 7 people arrived late and the wait staff was not pleased or pleasant about the matter but cross-town taxis in midtown at rush hour aren't the best. Once everyone was settled in things went a lot smoother with them, though. They brought out a sampling of dips with 2 focaccia type breads for the 7 people which was fine, but then they asked if we wanted more and when we got the bill realized it was not complimentary. Please, hummus and pita aren't going to break the bank - that should always be free and don't bring out small portions for 7 people to share. Not a deal breaker, but a bit obnoxious.Overall, great experience. Food was delicious, company was wonderful and the cocktails topped it off with a bang...",0,0,0,Caroline S.,"Washington, DC",21,30,3
2.0,2/5/2011,"We came here for Restaurant Week on a late Friday evening.  Perhaps they were tired or something, but the experience was far from optimal.Upon arrival, we had an attentive but sneaky server as she gave us regular menus without mentioning anything about RW.  When we asked about RW, she acted surprised as if she was trying to get away from not letting us know about RW, odd.My friend started with a ""Taboonista"" (?) drink with tequila, date honey, fruits, etc, which was a great drink.  Not too obnoxious and very pretty looking drink.  So far so good.Once our server quickly took our order, she went from attentive to ""barely present.""  At 11 PM (which is when they are closed for business), it was not that crowded with only 3-4 tables left to serve.    Our meze bread (house foccacia) did not come at all until we got our appetizer and had to ask the busboy about the meze.  When it did come, the bread was good, hot and toasty.  It came with 3 spreads: tzatiki (so so), hummus (decent), and smoked eggplant (my favorite of the 3).My friend got the halumi salad, which she said was what she expected, while another friend got the Winter salad (beets, pears, etc), which she thought was forgettable.  I got the as-marked-on-menu ""Sea Scallops,"" and I received ONE scallop in an oversized cast-iron dish surrounding by a sea of tomato confit.  I'm no food critic, but the plating seems unnecessary for ONE scallop (sorry, I cannot get over the mis-numeration of the scallop) and the tomato confit was too overwhelming that I couldn't taste my ONE scallop.  Major fail.For entrees, we got the heraime (striped bass in a ragout of vegetables that looked a lot like the tomato confit) and the vegetable grill.  My friend was incredibly displeased with her fish--""too salty, too smoked, fish is too dry.""  My response to the heraime was ""I have had worse fish,"" which exactly isn't a compliment as I tend to give nicer comments if I can.  My other friend didn't enjoy her grilled vegetables either as she also said it was over-salted and not tasty.  Disappointing entrees.  For the kicker, the server asked if we'd like more foccacia bread, and while we knew it might not be free, she didn't warn us about the cost.  So that was also another not-so-honest moments, AND the bread came again much later than we expected.Our desserts were the milk cardamom chocolate mousse with tahini ice cream and the silan (vanilla ice cream with puffed rice and date honey).  That was the best part of the meal.  Plating for the mousse was great, and the mousse was soft and creamy.  The cardamom was a great touch to the mousse, and the tahini ice cream was interesting.  My friend liked her silan too.Overall, I have had worse dining experiences, but for a restaurant that falls in the $$$ range, I've expected better everything: (honest) service, (honest) menu, and most importantly, food.I won't be going back.  But if you do go there, then stick with the drinks, breads, and the desserts.",1,2,0,Judy C.,"Munich, Germany",124,707,136

3.0,1/30/2011,"Pricey place, but the restaurant week menu lured us in. We had an early table, at 5.30 pm on a weeknight, the day after a major snow storm, & the place was empty, which was great for us.The breads are great - thanks to the taboon oven - and we ordered a few more that were off the prix fixe menu. (which turned out to be a good move, since that was probably the best food we had). A bottle of Lebanese wine - a red blend - was very good, a recommendation from our (Lebanese) server. The kube appetizer I ordered - a mince patty really - was a tad salty. The halibut was a small portion, did not look too impressive. Lamb kebabs were small portions, also a tad salty, and were minced - not whole chunks as I would have thought. The whole baked (in the taboon, where else!) seabass was the best entree - perfectly done. And the lemon verbena mint tea is a nice light finishing touch. The damage was $60 average, so not too bad, even with the wine and off prix fixe menu items.

4.0,1/30/2011,"Came here for Restaurant Week on Friday. The place was packed late into the evening, and it's very clear why.To begin: The house foccacia. Holy crap. It comes with three dips -- hummus, tzatziki, and some kind of smoked-fish number. But never mind them. Just eat the bread.Appetizers were strong, but unremarkable. My pan-seared scallops stood up well against its tomato and garlic companion. Service in a cast-iron dish was a nice touch.But man. That duck, on celery root and parsnip puree, with dried cranberries (""craisins"" would be too crude for this place) and porcini mushrooms. The breast was luscious and perfectly rosy in color. The leg confit fell off the bone, but wasn't overly salty as is sometimes the case. This, ladies and gentlemen, is duck with a capital D.Desserts were no throwaways either: the silan had silky ice cream, crispy puffed rice, and halva, which, for those of you who are not in the know (like me), is some kind of cotton candy-like floss with a faintly herbal flavor. It was a contest of textures, and everybody won.To top it all off, the three (arguably four, if you count the bread, which I do) courses for $35: You better get your ass down here right quick.

MMMMM.  The taramasalata was creamy and savory. The foie gras app came next-- it was served with black tahini and quince paste, and melted in my mouth: simply divine! I had the hangar steak grilled in the taboon-- it was so tender and flavorful and perfectly cooked. There's a tasty grilled veggie option too, but all of the dishes we had were just outstanding.

In terms of ambience, the restaurant has huge floor to ceiling windows and a very relaxing, simple decor.  My only complaint was that the service was a tad slow, but I'm an impatient eater, so that might just be me.Overall, I will definitely be back soon!

As many have said, the fresh-baked bread is to die for. The service was good.  In fact, we didn't have reservations and the hostess was very upfront about needing the table at a certain time and if  we were still there she would need to move us. We were and she did and it was easy and considerate. Scallop appetizer - 3 nicely grilled over a smokey eggplant/tomato/garlic confit that was very tasty.Crab meat salad app - we got this because we were intrigued and a little scared of crab meat and feta, but it worked, mostly because there was just a hint if feta. Unusual and good. Red snapper special - really fresh and simply prepared. Over some amazing chickpea gnocchi (I know! Cool, right?). At $30, though, it, like everything else, was about 10% more than it should be to get 5 stars from me. Still, a really nice dinner in an attractive place with good service.

5.0,12/16/2010,"This is one of the best, if not best, Israeli/Mediterranean restaurants in NYC. Although it's casual, I am always pleasantly surprised by the sophistication of each plate which has many different spices and herbs. It reminds me of upscale restaurants in Israel which serve amazingly creative dishes using the freshest ingredients. I am a big fan of Israeli cooking. Today we had falafel (one of the best ones I've had), shrimp kadayif (very good, love the beet/cucumber salad), foire gras (ok), halumi salad (very good), focaccia (excellent- far better than Italian focaccia), and three types of spread including hummus. For entree I tried lamb kebob and halibut. Kebob was moist, well seasoned, and the side of grilled eggplant salad had that smokiness I love. The halibut is cooked in tomato sauce and is basically shakshuka without eggs. Again well seasoned and is a must dish. The highlight of desert was date sponge cake which is soaked in rum but very fluffy and cardamon chocolate mousse.

3.0,12/7/2009,"Taboon goes beyond the basics.  If you simply want the best falafel platter that money can buy, Taim can't be beat.  If you instead thrive on hummus, head to Hoomoos Asli or any Hummus Place location.  But if you are in the mood to splurge on good Middle Eastern food in a family restaurant setting, and are not averse to trekking to Hell's Kitchen (code for 'cab it or walk it'), Taboon is simply the best choice.Taboon has a distinct Theater District feel to it -- classy-wannabe decor, seemingly out-of-towner crowd, matter-of-fact wait staff, and an ugly ambience around the restaurant.  The service is friendly and generally efficient.  A significant upgrade from the likes of Maoz or Mamoun's.  One almost feels like a monkey in captivity that has been transported overnight from the zoo in the Bronx to San Diego.The mezes are light and tasty, including the falafel and hummus.  The house flatbread is excellent--brushed with a touch of olive oil.  The sambusak, filled with feta cheese and jalapenos, is a great alternative.  The vegetarian entree choices are limited and the drinks lack that distinctive edge that one demands at this price point.  The desserts are par for the course, notably the halva.Taboon will continue to be in my 'top five' list for the neighborhood, but I need a bigger draw than just the bread and the staples at a price premium.",25,14,20,Srini V.,"Manhattan, NY",467,463,97

5.0,6/7/2009,"With so many delicious ethnic eateries on Ninth Avenue, I rarely venture any further west than that culinary mecca.  However, Taboon has given me a new reason to cross the border into this less populated area.  I was walking to the restaurant a few weeks ago and was impressed by the classy clientele sipping wine at their prime outdoor tables.  Candlelight shone through the windows, promising an intimate dining experience.  I entered the elegant restaurant and came face-to-face with a wood burning oven and a counter top full of fresh, ripe vegetables.  The colorful ingredients and smell of baking bread made my stomach growl.  I proceeded into the dining room, which contained a small wine bar and several cramped tables.  The room possessed an air of sophistication, but yet also country roots.  I just knew that I was in for a hearty, fresh meal.  Taboon's wine list contained mainly Mediterranean varietals.  The Israeli Cabernet was medium-bodied, fruity, and contained virtually no acidity.  It was perhaps the best wine I have ever tasted.  The Spanish Tempranillo was also delicious, with a more smokey flavor.  We received a loaf of their hearth-made bread to start.  The complimentary loaf consisted of a crisp, lightly-oiled crust and a tender, fluffy internal dough.  This bread was so delicious that we did not feel the need to purchase one of their more fancy stuffed versions.  We also sampled several meze (appetizers).  The Hummus provided a creamy and garlicky spread for our tasty slices of bread.  The mixture was seasoned with jalapeno, garlic, and a fragrant paprika olive oil.  I found the hummus flavorful, but a bit runny.  The Beet Salad was the perfect blend of textures and essences.  The delicate mixed greens were topped with pickled beets, aged stilton cheese, haricot vert, corintus raisins (very small, dark raisins that tasted more like the yellow version), and hazelnuts.  A sweet, hazelnut vinaigrette lightly covered the dish.  Finally, we were blown away by the Crab Meat Salad.  The small plate was served surprisingly warm and contained chunks of fresh crab meat, feta cheese, oregano, and croutons.  Ripe tomato chunks lined the bottom of the bowl and provided an acidic balance.  My one substantial complaint was our waiter.  He often refused to make eye contact, did not refill our waters, and barely checked in to see if we needed anything else.  Though I have been told that I often comment on poor service, Taboon's slow waitstaff made more of a negative impact than most.  Regardless of the lackadaisical assistance and pricey menu, Taboon is worth every penny.  Their earthy cooking style makes the most of simple ingredients and basic culinary methods.  The seductive decor, fresh food, and delicate wines offer the best of all worlds, Mediterranean or otherwise.",2,0,0,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

I saw her give him the up and down... but when I cut through and was like well I see tables available and then i dropped an employers name, she was on us like a quarterback is on a cheerleader on prom night, got a beautiful table in the corner... after that we should have left but it was cold outside and I didn't want to go through the same charade somewhere else. the waitress was a doll, simple wine list and good mix of prices and countries. The appetizers were really good, and you have to have the Shoog... if you like spicy goodness. The Lamb Osso Bucco, was under seasoned I kept of slathering with the Shoog and salt, table side seasoning as a last resort is not fun. The desserts were interesting and tasty....All in all not bad... I am definitely not running back for more... but if I am in the neighborhood again I think I might try the seafood.",0,0,1,Kris G.,"New York, NY",14,23,0
4.0,2/16/2008,"Taboon is an upscale version of your typical Middle Eastern restaurant. The waitstaff is impeccable, the space is gorgeous and made for fine dining and the food is good enough to make your mouth water. The lamb shank is juicy and delicious with the meat falling easily off the bone. The other entress had were quite good as well. They included short ribs and halibut. There is a tiny bit of a table rush/false reservation need but, other than that, the place is excellent.",0,0,0,Jennifer Y.,"New York, NY",182,619,2
4.0,1/22/2008,"Like below, I'm not sure I would consider this an authentic middle eastern establishment. The food I thought was above average on the verge of excellent, but not quite. But pretty damn close.Maybe the reason I thought it wasn't, is because I'm not used to having middle eastern food taste this way. I think that they have taken middle eastern food and fused it with a little Spanish and American influence.Anywho, I digress. We came here with a  group of 6, and what we did was basically order many dishes, mostly small dishes but a few entrees. ordered three bottles of wine. It was a great time with great food and service.Some of the dishes we had were the flafel, hummus, shrimp kadayif, fish ceviche and the calamri. all were great to awesome!!",7,3,6,Armin L.,"New York, NY",20,84,0
4.0,10/18/2007,"Very interesting!I had a lovely dinner here earlier this week with a good friend, on the suggestion of another fine gentleman (you know who you are). I must say, while it wasn't the most delicious hummus or falafel I've ever had in my life, it was likely the most unique. Falafel and hummus are the type of dishes that are hard to screw up badly, but also hard to make excellent. Most places fall somewhere in a broad middle ground.The appeal of Taboon lies in it's fresh take on classic dishes. Both sauces on the falafel were very interesting - one was a sharp mango and curry aoli and the other a cilantro tahini. It seems they draw their inspiration from Indian, Italian, and classic American cuisines to add color to the Middle-Eastern/Mediterranean staples.This fusion makes for very interesting fare. Go here if you want a new take on a classic, not necessarily something that reminds you of mom's cooking.The service, while mostly friendly, was a bit hasty. They brought us the wrong salad, but it was tasty nonetheless!Tip: Make reservations!I wouldn't necessarily make Taboon a destination, but if I were in the area and wanting falafel, I would go back!",6,4,6,Ahu S.,"New York, NY",122,450,87
5.0,9/10/2007,"yum.  Ok, its probably not that hard to make bread delicious by melting cheese into it, ala grilled cheese sandwich, but they have figured out how to mix it with magic.  The wine list is interesting (who knew they still make wine in Greece). My family had a 14 person private party here in the spring.  The staff was amazing, and so were the hors d'ouvres.  Apparently my appetite was sated by the first few courses of hummus, yogurt, seafood et al so by  the time the lamb with a big femur in it arrived, it was a little overwhelming.  But never fear, I came home and made it into a stew.Delish, great place for a date.

5.0,7/26/2007,unbelievable - some of the best food i've had in a while. the service was excellent and very accommodating. we unfortunately didn't have a reservation but was able to squeeze us in for a 45 minute window which meant we got our food fast and with plenty of attention. i had the halibut - fantastic - just the right amount of spice. i tried the lamb kebabs - oh wow! i'm not a fan of humus - but i'd bathe in theirs it's so good. their drinks and bread - fantastic additions to the meal. so glad i'm going to be moving a block away - i'll be eating there often - yummy to my tummy i can't wait to eat there again!,2,0,1,Jonathan W.,"New York, NY",72,184,5
4.0,7/13/2007,"Great food, and very crowded so make a reservation if you're stopping by at prime dinner hours.My friend ended up just ordering some appetizers, and we were very happy with what we got.  We had the falafel (which was good, but not great), the fish ceviche, which was great, the tzatziki which was wonderful, and the scallops, which were also wonderful.",0,0,0,David X.,"New York, NY",10,121,0
3.0,11/27/2006,"Taboon's forte is inventiveness. It takes simple day-to-day fare and raises it to an art form. So, who hasn't had bread, hummus or falafel in their lives? But, once you sample them at Taboon, it would feel as if you had never had these staples before.The Bread --- what can one say about their bread? Except: ""Keep it coming!""  The flatbread reminds you of many close cousins: focaccia, pizza, even Afghan bread --- it has been rubbed with olive oil and has rosemary and sage. You could make a meal just of the bread --- but better to eat it with the many varieties of meze (small plates) --- prominent among which are the Hummus that carries an unexpected jolt of Jalapeno, or the Falafel that are well seasoned and textured without being dry.The entrees are intriguing --- a lot have spent time in the oven after which the ""Middleterranean"" (hybrid of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean) restaurant is named. The Halibut is moist nevertheless and is well complemented by tomato, cumin, harissa and red pepper.  Also savory is the half chicken (with lemon), as are the ground lamb kebabs (with parsley and pistachios).I've even been there for brunch and can recommend both the eggs benedict, and (particularly) the Shahkshuka.While the Malabi is their most popular dessert (Baklava and berries in rose infused cream), I prefer the Silan which is the vanilla ice cream sprinkled with pistachios and date honey. If you aren't in the mood to experiment, also available is the ubiquitous lava cake made from bitter sweet chocolate.Taboon is one of the more memorable, if pricier, dining options in Hell's Kitchen.",7,2,5,Atif I.,"New York, NY",177,642,1772
4.0,11/15/2006,"As my future sister in law commented, ""This place is very cozy"". By ""cozy"" I think she meant,  it is clean, well lit, the food is very tasty, and the cocktails are delicious/ plentiful. I also give props to any Mediterranean place who isn't afraid of putting ouzo on its cocktail list.  The warm bread is a  HUGE bonus too.",1,0,2,Roxane S.,"San Francisco, CA",62,152,0
4.0,10/23/2006,"The same way that Pampano makes upscale Mexican food, or Kittichai makes upscale Thai food, Taboon makes upscale middle-eastern food - with the pleasant bonus that Taboon is warm and welcoming, and while it is stylish it has no attitude.  Everyone raves about the bread, and the falafel is equally good, as is the hummus.  The main courses are more refined, with lots of good fish dishes.  Another plus about this place is that you don't have to book weeks in advance to get a weekend dinner reservation.   The location is a bit off the beaten path, but this is a place I love returning to and a great date restaurant.",4,0,3,Bruce S.,"New York, NY",7,34,0
4.0,10/1/2006,"I went to this place soon after it opened and haven't been back since, so my impressions are a little vague and may now be out of date.  But I've thought about going back often, especially since I've yet to find other cities that are as good for Middle Eastern food as NYC.  What I recall:  a somewhat oversized (and perhaps a leetle too bright) dining room, but still romantic with country-style furniture, wood and brick and candles everywhere; a whole fish perfectly roasted with a lightly salted, crispy skin, accompanied by various luscious meze, and, last but NOT least, warm, golden-browned, fluffy bread apparently baked in their taboon (i.e., oven), which comes drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt and herbs.  YUM!!!",2,0,2,Sue Z.,"San Francisco, CA",15,61,3
5.0,1/14/2006,"I had dinner at the taboon few weeks ago for the firsf time, and I want to tell you all that the food is great starting with the best bread I have ever had then the meze, don't miss the foie gras, then I had the Lamb Kabab....so good. The service is good. Maybe the best at hells kitchen! 5 stars",1,0,1,Chinku G.,"Hicksville, NY",21,541,0
