5.0,4/14/2019,What an exceptional experience!!! I was going into the city for a Billy Joel concert and decided what better way to kick off the night than with a great dinner for my fiancée. Il Postino blew it out of the water. From the moment we walked in we were welcomed and taken to our perspective table. We sat down and a beautiful spread was placed before us as we sipped some wine and ordered our entrees. I ordered a chicken parm with a side of angel hair and vodka sauce and I can easily say it was probably the best chicken parm I've had. My Fiancée ordered the Chilean sea bass with shrimp and lobster and she was extremely satisfied. We will DEFINITELY be coming back!!,0,0,0,Nahon T.,"Rutherford, NJ",161,10,13
5.0,3/20/2019,"We live in the neighborhood and come here often. What really sets this place apart is the customer service and the fact that they will make virtually any Italian dish you ask for, even if it is not on the menu. Do you feel like a particular pasta and sauce, such as linguine with clam sauce or ravioli and pesto? If you ask your waiter, there is a very good chance that they can make it!This is not a trendy restaurant that everyone knows about, so it tends to be mostly locals. Come join in and be pleasantly surprised!",1,0,0,Sarah M.,"Manhattan, NY",1,37,0
4.0,3/8/2019,Awesome spot near to work on its costumer service.. felt like I had to wave down or server to many times. And I had to ask for the check way to long since we were done with our meal and they could see that and still waited for us to ask for the bill even though the couple next to us got there after us and left before us... but the food was great..,0,0,0,Richard M.,"Oceanside, CA",129,4,8
3.0,2/16/2019,"Went here for restaurant week but was not too impressed with the food. As soon as we walked in it felt like they were annoyed we were ordering from the restaurant week menu (as opposed to the full menu). It got worse when we decided to order a glass of wine as opposed to a bottle of wine. Nonetheless, the food was good. The fish was very tender and not over cooked. Red snapper was not very flavorful however the salmon was very delicious. The best dish was the calamari and salmon ravioli- very flavorful. The calamari was fresh and sauce was not too acidic or salty - just right. The ravioli was cooked perfectly and the pink sauce was delicious. What was out of this world were the desserts- all three were very delicious and fresh. I was disappointed they ran out of tiramisu however the other desserts were amazing. Don't think I'll return but good dishes available.",0,0,0,Vani T.,"Wantagh, NY",98,68,194

5.0,2/5/2019,"Wonderful classy Italian restaurant great for dinner with friends, family or a date.Service.  Bartender, hostess and servers were extremely friendly and attentive from the time we arrived to the time we left. Ambiance. White linen tablecloths, black chair covers and small fresh flowers on the tables contributed to a comfortably formal and classy atmosphere.  The table where we were seated couldn't have been more perfect, set apart from the rest, private feeling, and overlooking the tables on the first level of the dining room. Food.  We had dinner here restaurant week, and everything was great.  - bread with oil- mussels in a light broth - fantastic - burrata- very good - veal- tender, excellent - seafood with green and white pasta- the pasta was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was delicious. - tiramisu- - chocolate cake- deliciousDefinitely recommend for a great italian dining experience with outstanding service.",44,22,46,Lisa F.,"New York, NY",379,486,1198
1.0,1/29/2019,"We went to Il Postino for lunch during Restaurant Week. For starters, the service was terrible. The food was mostly pretty good but not great--only the bread was great. The menu online said they were offering a 3-course lunch, including dessert, during R.W. But the restaurant menu said the lunch was only 2 courses. I hate this kind of bait and switch. I showed the menu I printed out to the waiter before we ordered dessert, and he said no problem. But, lo and behold, the bill included extra charges for the desserts. Another waiter came over THREE times trying to get us to pay extra for the desserts.This ruined the experience for me, and we won't be returning. You have to stand by what you advertise.

5.0,11/6/2018,"I live in Southern California but have been coming to Il Postino since the late 1990s.  There was a period of time where my business took me to NYC several times a year, and I would frequently dine at Il Postino.  After several years away, I recently stopped in for dinner.  The servers and Luigi remembered me and it was like ""old home week"".  The food at Il Postino remains the best I've ever had in NYC.  The truffle ravioli is off the charts and the wine list is exceptional.  Having a unique restaurant like Il Postino where I can bring customers and get an amazing meal with unmatched service is the greatest!  I've had evenings where I've had 10 people for dinner and quite dinners with my wife.  In every case, Il Postino and Luigi were exceptional and exceeded my expectations!",0,0,0,Robert O.,"Orange, CA",0,21,3
4.0,9/22/2018,"I think what set's Il Postino apart from other similar establishments is the service. There was no question that not only had our waiter worked there for years and knew the menu like the back of his hand, but he was overly accommodating in substitutions and off menu items.Our dinner started with some lovely prosciutto and burrata, and my dinner was followed by some epic seafood stew. This spot is a little off the beaten path and totally worth it for the experience. Ask to get a table in the back if you want to talk as it can get a bit crowded by the bar.",1,0,1,Dustin H.,"Toledo, OH",191,533,1516
2.0,8/13/2018,"I took my son here for dinner last night and was looking forward to a nice meal.  As it was quite hot and humid we didn't mind being seated away from the open windows onto the street at a table with more air conditioning.  Unfortunately it took some time to realize that we were seated in ""Siberia"" and the locals were seated downstairs.  Initially not a big issue but we found that after we placed our orders, we were basically ignored for the night except for food delivered to our table.  We had the restaurant week menu which is a good deal at $42 considering most of the entrees are $40-$50.  We did have 2 drinks and an extra appetizer so we hoped that would show that we supported the restaurant.  Not so and we had to chase down our waiter for the check.  Food was ok to good so probably not coming back.",1,0,0,Robert M.,"Briarcliff Manor, NY",0,7,0

Solidly flavorful - Lentil soup: we found plastic in the soup. The waiter was very nice and replaced it quickly but still... you lose a star on yelp for thatMains- Pappardelle: this was good, and I'm not usually a big fan of mushroom but it was in good portions and not overwhelming. The pasta itself was perfect!!!! Seriously!!All the main courses were fantastic! Desserts:- everything is great...

2.0,7/31/2018,"Very disappointing. Went here for restaurant week. Waiter insisted we order the wine before seeing a food menu. Getting the restaurant week menu was challenging. Tried to sell us appetizers for the table not on the menu before we could even think. Would not take dessert orders until after the meal, but would not show us the menu again so we could pick. Asked about seasonal berries: ""Not on the restaurant week menu."" So, that person declined to order dessert. Very clearly. When the desserts came for the rest of the party, they delivered berries and waved their hands and made it clear ( to all four of us) that they had changed their mind and offered the berries. When the bill came, there was a $26 added charge for one regular coffee and dessert. When we asked about it, they said the dessert was not on the menu. We asked the price, and the waiter didn't know, ""maybe $18.50."" $18.50 for berries we didn't order. So, they bold-faced lied and assumed we would have no problem with that.Sound level was about the same as a popular club on Friday night. Could not hear anything anyone said 6 inches away. Left hoarse.Only good thing was the food: good, not great.Do not go to this restaurant!",1,0,0,Samuel Y.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0
1.0,7/26/2018,"A friend and I went for lunch today for the Restaurant Week meal. We knew it was a two course meal but wanted dessert. I asked the waiter what he recommended, and he said ""the cheesecake"" He told us dessert was not included. We told him we knew this, and ordered one cappuccino, one decaf and one piece of cheesecake. The plate came, and there was a piece ""maybe"" two inches in size! My friend took a picture  of this! I waited two minutes, beckoned to the waiter and asked him if this was some kind of a joke! He gave me a really nasty look when I asked for the manager! Manager never came, but the waiter brought a normal sized slice which cost $10.O0. Would anyone in their right mind pay $10.00 two inch piece of cake!!?? I think just to be nasty, the waiter wrapped up the teeny piece of salmon that my friend left on her plate and put it in a plastic compartment to take home. It was clearly a small leftover and was not more then three bites! I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone even though the food was adequate, nothing special. Waiter was silent and unfriendly. And we left him more than a twenty per cent because we have manners. STAY AWAY",1,0,0,Isa R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0
2.0,7/24/2018,"Went here for a business lunch this afternoon with a client. I arrived a little early and was seated at a table alone in the back away from all the other diners. There was very little air conditioning in the back area. My colleague did the restaurant week special, but I didn't. The selection was really bad. I instead ordered the soup of the day and the beet salad. The soup was minestrone and it was bizarre, unlike any minestrone I've ever had. Was more like a bunch of vegetables in chicken broth. The beet salad was mostly arugula and giant endive leaves with a small scoop of chopped beets which was very different from what it was described as in the menu. My client had the calamari to start, which was also bizarre and was basically boiled calamari served on radicchio leaves with some breadcrumbs scattered on top. For his entree he had the poached salmon which he described as tasting like boiled cat food. Restaurant week menus are usually three courses and this restaurant only served us two courses. In all it was a bad experience. In terms of service, we were mostly ignored throughout the meal and when we wanted the check it took a long time to get it then another 15 minutes to get anyone's attention to even come run the card. I don't recommend this restaurant for personal reasons and especially not as a place to conduct business. I give it two stars because at least they had some sparkling water that I could enjoy.",1,0,0,Jake P.,"Manhattan, NY",8,24,7

2.0,1/29/2018,"I've visited Il Postino on two occasions, both for dinner on a weeknight. On the first visit, I was on a date. We were seated in the main dining area and were one of the only tables that night. The service was ok, but the staff seemed a little put out. I always try to order something on the lower end of the price range when my date is paying, but that was just about impossible here. Pasta entrees were around $40 and so was the steak, so I figured I might as well get the steak. It was ok, but nothing to write home about. For the price, we could've gotten much better elsewhere. The ambience is ok, very old school. I just couldn't get over the value ratio, the quality of the food and service just didn't merit the hefty price tag. Recently, I returned during Restaurant Week to meet my parents and a family friend. We had a 6pm reservation so we weren't exactly taking up a prime time dinner spot. We ordered a nice bottle of wine for the table. When the waiter came to give us menus, he rattled off a list of specials and walked away. They hadn't given us the Restaurant Week menu. We had to wait for him to return and ask. He begrudgingly got us the menus and from that point on we were treated like second class citizens. Never mind that our bill still came to around $400. I had the mozzarella app (meh), the lasagna (actually pretty good), and the panna cotta (again, fine.)If you don't want to participate in Restaurant Week, you don't have to! It's not an excuse to be rude to your guests and it's just bad advertising. I often find places through Restaurant Week that I return to again and again, paying regular prices. It's worth treating guests with respect. Suffice it to say, I will not be returning to Il Postino. There are too many superior options.",3,1,0,Andrea L.,"Manhattan, NY",11,43,16

4.0,8/10/2017,"I had white truffles on the brain and read that Il Postion could take me there.. So I called and they said it's not on our menu but we can make it for you. We can make anything you like for you! After hanging up and no sooner than you could say white truffles, my phone rang. It was Il Postino calling me back saying white truffles are not in season. But they could make me something with black truffles if that was okay. Kind of dissapointed but said okay. It was cool that they called back and what the heck, better to get my truffle training wheels than to eat rotisserie chicken again. I get there and this place is fancy. I passed on the restaurant week specials that look so good and cheap. The waiter said the chef will make you 8 cheese filled raviolis with a cream sauce, and with shaved black truffles done table side. When the pasta came, he took this round hunk of black truffle from an old wooden box, like a small treasure chest, and began to shave it with a small mandolin over my pasta. I was like damn, this is Foodie Heaven with a capital F H baby!

1.0,8/1/2017,"I rated this restaurant poorly for several reasons. The first reason is the table the hostess picked for my party. The table was next to the bathroom where I notice a peculiar odor that only comes from restrooms. I made a reasonable request for another table and was rejected,. The reason was because  it was towards the end of lunch, so most of the tables were getting prepared for dinner. No wonder the place was empty, if the employees can not accommodate new patrons. Then the server was not  pleasant, he threw the menus and left without saying a word. Then he came back a few minutes later to take our order, and we asked him for a few more minutes. He showed up about 15 minutes later, it seemed like an eternity. The food came out and it was not tasty, it lack flavor and presentation. It tasted as if it came out of a can or package and that's giving it to much credit. The presentation of the food looked like it was thrown together by a 2 year old boy on our plates. We mentioned  our dissatisfaction to  the server,  but to no avail. He looked confused,  like we were speaking in another language . Then for the grand finale, we asked if the dessert had alcohol, and he said no. What do you think happened, the dessert had alcohol. I asked for the check  and  he took his sweet time. Then we waited about 10 minutes and he did not pick up the check, so I took it to the hostess, because he was too busy on his cell phone. Then I learned a few days later that the restaurant did not notify Open Table that I had eaten there. So i will never recommend this establishment to anyone in their right mind, unless a public apology is made.",1,0,0,Rich P.,"ASTORIA, NY",2,48,24
4.0,6/15/2017,"I worked in an Italian restaurant for 6 years where we never said no to a customer when they had a request to add, substitute or alter the preparation of a dish. At Il Postino, after our waiter rattled off a list of specials, in what seemed like a 10 minute motivational speech encouraging you to order the most delicious dish you could possibly order, he assured us that the kitchen was willing to make whatever we wanted. The food was REALLY good and was traditional upscale Italian (hence the $$$$). For appetizers we ordered a tuna tartare, grilled octopus and caprese with burrata. I was particularly a fan of the tuna tartare, which we ordered spicy and come over a layer of avocado, and of course, the octopus. For my entree, I ordered the special homemade fusilli bolognese, which is an odd order for me, but I was not disappointed at all. You could tell the pasta was homemade by its texture and you could also tell they prepared it right, by cooking the pasta in the sauce, not just dumping it on top of it. The rest of the table ordered a special truffle ravioli, two snappers (which I tried and thought was delicious and a very healthy portion), a chicken dish and sea bass. Everyone enjoyed their meal and the environment was comfortable, while still feeling classy. The only thing that stuck out to me in a negative way was how long it took the waiter to take our order even though he said he'd come back in a couple of minutes (we waited around 15).

The sound travels here, so it's was hard to hear your own conversation because the ones at the next table interfere and I recommend not to speak of anything personal because they will know two tables down.The service was slow and not attentive, we didn't get checked on or get our water refilled for a long period of time but were charge for sparkling water when they gave us tap on refills.The Salmone Marinato  was above average with the nice touch of the lemons that had little netted covers so the seeds don't come out.  The Veal Scaloppine was average. And the Semifreddo was average in taste but below average on presentation because it was just a piece cut from a slab with some drizzle on top. The food did arrive in full groups so the kitchen must have a good staff.The Tiramisu Il Postino that the others had did get a lot of mmms, and yums from the table.  Also the others had the Fettuccini, veal ragu pizzaiola which had too many olives but was above average still in taste when you removed them.They auto added a 21% gratuity to the bill at the end.Most likely I will not be back since I have already I been to one where the food was better 2 blocks away and I still have a half dozen other Italian restaurants within walking distances I need to try out.",12,7,8,Tom G.,"Rutherford, NJ",168,239,2538

They cook your main course (pastas only though) in the restaurant in front of you on this little cart with all the fresh ingredients. I had the polenta as the first course, generous amount of funghi and meatballs on top of the steamy polenta, cooked just right. The pasta had a generous amount of seafood in it and the sauce was perfect. Homemade dessert - we had the pannacotta, tiramisu and gelato. Everything's homemade, very happy with the food.

Review were okay, so I was still looking forward to it. Anyway, the Il Postino is a classic Italian spot. It is quiet, and tucked away off of first avenue. It is a little overpriced, but I appreciated the ambiance. To start, there was cold antipasti placed on the table. The bread was delicious as was the olive oil. For appetizers, we got the burratta. prosciutto, calamari, tuna tartar, & baked clams. The tuna tartar was amazing. There was avocado in the middle and it just tasted really fresh and refreshing. The rest of the apps were meh.  For my main, I stuck with gnocchi topped with mozz and tomato sauce. I did really like this, and the service size was huge! I have leftovers waiting in my fridge for me. What made the service fun was the waiter told us we could order any Italian dish we wanted, even if it wasn't on the menu. Everyone appreciated that and ordered a variety of veal and chicken dishes. Overall, my experience here was just okay nothing to write home about. I think you can find the same experience with a smaller price tag in many spots throughout the city.",2,1,2,Sarah Z.,"Manhattan, NY",141,169,106

If they recommend a bottle of wine, be prepared to shell out $1500 on that. The lobster dish is excellent and about $80. The steak with truffles was the best dish we had.

She loved the artichokes, however I thought they were a little bland.  After the apps our pasta course arrived.  We order the linguine vongole.  This was absolutely delicious!  Everything about this dish was perfect and the portion was a good size for the two of us to split.  We then moved onto the osso buco.  My mom makes an incredible osso buco, but this was close.  Again, a good sized portion, loaded with flavor and lots of marrow.  It was so rich with flavor and the veal shank so tender...you'd think it was done at home by your mom.  On top of the above, we did get a bottle of wine to go with the meal and two coffees.   Other than the artichokes, I thought the food was excellent.  That being said, I did find the restaurant overpriced.  For the above, our check was $278 (including tip).  I did know the place was expensive, but I don't think the food justified the check...don't get me wrong, we were very happy with the dinner.  I just thought this was maybe $50-$75 more than it should have been.",0,0,0,Robert I.,"New York, NY",19,6,0

Cozze Al Vino Bianco (new zealand mussels, white wine, garlic, parsley)2. Striped Bass Mediterraneo (wild striped bass, little neck clams, mussels, asparagus, saffron tomato broth); and3.

We then ordered 3 desserts, gelato, creme brulee and chocolate cake. The creme brulee came out entirely not cooked - quite dangerous on a dessert that is composed almost entirely of eggs.Each course the service got worse and worse, waiting longer and longer for someone to pay attention to us. We finally got the bill but we were unable to tell how much we paid for anything. We think we got royally ripped off for the porcini mushroom risotto ""special"" my step-dad had at $48.50.

5.0,2/5/2014,"This 5-star rating is based primarily on multiple visits to Il Postino for late lunches, either on business days or on the weekends.  Late lunches are an unusually  luxurious dining experience, with relatively small guest attendance and an exceptionally attentive and professional wait staff.The prix fixe menu is a wonderful value, and offers a very nice selection of seafood, pasta and meat entrees.  Our meals have always been ""first class""... both in visual presentation and freshness and taste, and we have never been disappointed.But while the food preparation and selection of available items from the menu is first rate, what really earns a fifth star for Il Postino is the overall dining experience.  Overall, dining at Il Postino for lunch is a very calming and pleasant experience, especially in the midst of the hustle and bustle of midtown Manhattan.It is very unlikely that you will regret your visit to this oasis in Midtown Manhattan, particularly if you chose to do so for a very nice and memorable ""late lunch.""",1,0,0,Russ R.,"New York, NY",5,21,8

We said we would like some mozzarella and tomatoes together with assorted appetizers we had no idea that it would be $37.00 pp for appetizer. When we ordered our dinner we ordered four entrees which were grossly overpriced and did not realize that they came with string beans and carrots. We asked the waiter if we should order veg tables and he said sure instead of informing us that our entree came with veggies.

It came out looking like a chocolate sundae with so much sauce covering the tuna you could not even tell what it was... a very poor presentation.  I ordered the chicken milanese that was dry and flavorless.  Our guests from down south thought their veal was overcooked.  Quite frankly the best thing about this restaurant is there is a parking garage next door.   No bottles of wine, no coffee, no dessert.. and a $600 check...

I requested that he not come back to the table.  I will not deal with an offensive person no matter what type of restaurant I go to.  He tried to make you defensive if you didn't order a five course dinner.  I can't stand that in servers. The owners should tell him to move on to some other place. Although not the restaurants fault, the party next to us were the bridge and tunnel crowd.  They were loud and foul mouthed. The manager should have told them to tone it down and stop with the vulgarities.  We're not prudes but how many times can you listen to someone from Jersey or Nassau say the ""f"" word while trying to eat overpriced pasta? When we gave our feedback to management they were very appreciative but not appreciative enough to give us any incentive to return. I don't need anything for free, but even they admitted they were concerned about the table next to us.  Well, if they were that concerned why didn't they do anything about it? Of course, this is Manhattan. People are loud and if you want a quiet restaurant go to Maine.

5.0,6/2/2012,"A friend of mine was in from out of town, and it happened to be his birthday.  He said that we had to go to Il Postino.  Since we've shared many culinary journeys together over the years, and I'd heard good things about the place, I was excited to go.  We were served an amuse bouche - grilled zucchini marinated in balsamic vinegar and a hint of olive oil and garlic.  While I normally don't opt for anything with balsamic vinegar, it didn't overwhelm the flavor of the zucchini.  Shortly after, the waiter brought us a complimentary appetizer - finely chopped seafood (calamari, shrimp) ceviche with celery, served in endives - we were convinced it was chicken and were surprised when they told us what it was.  Upon the waiter's recommendation we ordered the Caprese salad to share.  It was made imported Italian mozzarella (that our waiter described with great relish), served with firm red and yellow heirloom tomatoes, roasted red pepper, crisp Italian basil, perfectly aged prosciutto de parma, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil.  The mozzarella was creamy and flavorful, and had none of the 'needs some more time to age' quality that you experience in so many restaurants. I have to say that the most decadent dish we had wasn't our main course, but our next shared appetizer.  It is not offered on the menu, but my friend knew to ask for it, and they knew what he was talking about.  We shared handmade ravioli stuffed with goat cheese and herbs, served with a light touch of cream sauce, and the piece de resistence - thinly shaved fresh black truffles which contributed a wonderfully earthy quality which made me want to spend hours savoring every last molecule.  (And to be honest, I wanted to get every bit of utility out of the $80 it cost - yeah, my buddy has expensive tastes)For our main course we had the pesce del giorno - Dover sole, which was cooked whole, but was brought to us fileted, with a lemon butter sauce, served with a simple accompaniment of broccoli rabe (which I usually can't stand) and a baby carrot topper.And for dessert - split homemade tiramisu (velvety, creamy, rich) and the Blood Orange Creme Brulee.  The waiter brought out the tiramisu with a candle and insisted on singing ""Happy Birthday"" and then brought us two complimentary glasses of chilled limoncello.  This meal would not have been so memorable without the superb service of our waiter.  Vito  was a delight who clearly reveled in our utter appreciation for every dish that was brought out, and clearly was knowledgeable about everything on the menu.  He thoroughly approved of the wine we selected (a 2007 Masi Costasera Amarone Classico) and knew he was in the presence of gourmands, which only added fuel to his fire.  They decanted the wine in front of us, which was a first for me.It was a pretty penny, but worth every red cent.",3,0,0,Judy V.,"New York, NY",387,21,0

We had waited until the last minute to chose a restaurant as our luck at the ""Book of Mormon"" lottery didn't work out as planned so we used Yelp and Open Table to find a special place for the big night. We arrived at 8:30 and we greeted by a very friendly hostess who seated us in a great table, set all by it self overlooking the main seating area. The restaurant was packed on a Wednesday night which made me feel good but being that it was Manhattan and pretty much everything is packed 24/7, I knew that we needed to feast on there food before a fair verdict could be reached. We started with some Chardonnay and ordered a delicious beet salad which we shared and then proceeded to order the main courses. My beautiful wife ordered the ahi tuna and I ordered the lamb chops. Both were unbelievably wonderful and a perfect way to enjoyed the 30th anniversary of our 1982 wedding. The service was great and the ambience of the place as delicious as the food. My only slight criticism was that on Open Table I had mentioned our special night and was sort of expecting one of their desserts with a flickering candle on top with the compliments.

Had I known this before, I would have booked elsewhere.",1,0,0,Sarah K.,"New York, NY",0,19,0
4.0,12/27/2011,"We go here every year for our holiday work dinner. The food is very good. If nothing looks good then just order what sounds good to you, they will make it!  Good selection of wine, too. Be prepared to shell out some dough for this place. Probably around $200-250/head. So good though!",0,0,0,Geoff J.,"Dallas, TX",75,172,30
4.0,12/2/2011,"Second date with Mike. I enjoyed every moment in Il Postiono; I am suspicious that it had to do something with the great wine selection. I started my meal with the arugula salad and my partner had lentil soup (next to the complimentary appetizers). I appreciated the simple dishes with surprisingly fresh, good flavors. I highly recommend you to try it. I had the venison dish with cherry sauce. I've made a mistake to custom order it (so me) but regardless it was delicious. The second dish I've tried was the lamb with wild mushrooms which was more to my taste. The presentation was unique; the meat was tender and juicy. The chocolate cake was out of this world with little ginger pieces, the creme brulee was more standard. The cappuccino wasn't all that unusual. The location is very convenient. Don't do the same mistake and go there in jeans. I didn't know. This is a festive place, dress appropriately.",0,0,0,Maddie M.,"Manhattan, NY",11,4,0

The Carrot-Ginger soup is special and so is the pumpkin ravioli. They cannot be compared to what mamma made..................................they are a darn sight better.Service, excellent overall. Con: Bit on the pricey side, but worth every cent. Good for a relaxed date.",1,0,1,Srinivas T.,"New York, NY",1,24,0

However, I've been to Il Postino several times, and the food has always been superbly delicious. This was my favorite place to eat before I made my first trip to Peter Luger's. In any event, the entire menu is recited by a waiter and you pick what you like from his list. You can also make your own dish if nothing that the waiter recited interested you. The decor is beautiful as well. However, on a negative note, they do try to charge you for extra expenses like a previous poster suggested.

4.0,5/22/2011,"The best Itlalian food ive ever had, i imagine if you went to Italy this is what you would get!!!  However, i fell completely ripped off..Theyyy do not show you a menu or tell you prices, cuz they want to gouge you.  We were over charged 30 bucks and when asked for them to take an item off(that we never even ordered or receive), they acted inconvenienced.  1 dish they recommended (was lobster) was 85 dollars..in my opinion if you are going to recommend a dish that expensive, you should inform the customer.  I would recommend this food to anyone as amazing...but if you are in NY on vacation with a budget, ask for a menu and do not order anything without knowing how much it costs.  Dinner for 2 costs me 280, the only price I was aware of was the price of the wine ...70..but they told us 60",0,0,0,Janna N.,"Newport Beach, CA",125,27,23
5.0,3/20/2011,"I came here with some family members from out of town. We were greeted by 4 or 5 extremely happy Italian (like form Italy Italian) staff members who treated us like kings. To be clear, the service wasn't pushy, the waitstaff was just happy to serve us.Our appetizer was ridiculously delicious. Unfortunately, it was authentic Italian and I can't recall how to pronounce what it was. But, it was made out of fresh roasted olives, I think, and served with bread.When it was time to order, I asked the waiter if there was something on the menu that matched what I was craving. He replied ""Just tell me what you want and I will have them make it for you"".Eventually, I ended up ordering a crabmeat linguini pasta special that I had wanted from the get go. The pasta arrived served in the actual crab shell, with wonderfully well cooked and well seasoned crab meat with a flavorful but not heavy pasta sauce.",3,0,2,Jay R.,"Capitol Hill, Seattle, WA",74,45,7

If I were looking for something to complain it would be: There is too many staff in the dinning room all the time which makes for great service, but at the same time it gets a bit too much all those people going around and talking. I went with a date and wanted more of a cozy thing.Other than that,  the price is really up there, you will drop $300 easily for 2.I you like wine get the Chianti Vila Sesta really nice.",0,0,0,Ronald D.,"Long Island City, NY",151,148,130

4.0,2/5/2009,"Il post-coital glow?  Or is my skin radiant from all of that delicious olive oil?Il Postino is a little off the beaten path for a westsider like me.  First Avenue?  What is that?  Well worth the cab ride, this midtown east gem is nestled into a quiet block on E. 49 st.  Upon entering the restaurant you are greeted by the old-world Italian staff who walk you past a table full of huge fresh portabella mushrooms, strawberries and other assorted enticing produce.  Heaping breadbaskets (mmm carbs), griled veggies and some seafood salad with endives were rushed to our tables shortly after being seated for us to snack on.After helping myself to far too much processed wheat (sidenote:  why do i always feel the need to kill the breadkbasket after bitching about how much thinner i wish i was!) my minestrone came.  Pieces of fresh asparagus, canneloni beans and other bits of goodness dominated bowl's real estate and made for a tasty soup.  My only issue was that the spoon was gigantic so I felt like I devoured the soup too quickly and less attractively.  My dining companions' salads all looked delicious as well with huge lumps of fresh goat cheese, chicory and fresh cherry tomatoes gracing their plates.My chicken paillard was good - cooked nicely and yummy but not seasoned particularly well.  The side salad and sliced potato were a nice accompaniment.  The best thing about my dish and the others were that the portions were spot on - a good sized serving but not overwhelmingly huge.  Unusual to find that ""sweet spot"" at NYC restaurants.  Also one of my dining companions wanted as she specified ""pasta with sausage and onions"".  While not on the menu the waitstaff were happy to accommodate her request.  Cool.Dessert sample plates and espressos followed.  The desserts were ok - not amazing but enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.  I was annoyed that the dessert sampler was presented as a plate for the table to share and then everyone was served their own plate - not cool.Food is great here, just be careful with the peripherals - alcohol and desserts - as they're steep in price.",4,1,1,Joshua A.,"New York, NY",288,141,18
