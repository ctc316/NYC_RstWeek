1.0,3/30/2019,"Worst dining experience ever. I've worked in hospitality my whole life and embarrassed for this establishment and I never Yelp. When we sat down we were greeted by an obnoxious and clueless somm. Your job is to help customers pick a wine not make them feel bad about it. She also was extremely slow. We got over that after a while, but then came desert and a chocolate desert came out with a candle. It was my father in law's birthday and the manager had notes about his chocolate allergy. We spoke to manager who looked like Telly Savalas in his last days with some added weight who was rude. Anyways, they pro-rated the check but the dinner was ruined already on account of their incompetence. Honestly no presidents eat here anymore and Obama eats at Blue Hill, you should too. This place should close it gives New York a bad name. Go to Olive Garden 'cause the food sucks, but our waiters did a good job and were not responsible for anything.",0,1,0,Thomas W.,"Manhattan, NY",158,3,0
1.0,3/20/2019,"My husband and I are local and were truly excited to try out 21 Club.We stopped in last night for a quick drink only to be told that we were not dressed appropriately for the restaurant. This is NYC in 2019! Dress codes to have a drink at the bar?! What kind of image are you trying to uphold? Not one that keeps up with the times.The host at this restaurant is not friendly at all and comes off very arrogant! I now understand why 21 Club only has 3 1/2 stars. Everything starts with the service and just because I had regular clothes on and not a suit and tie does not make my money any less green.I have been to Michelin Star restaurants all around the world that do not require a jacket.One last note, I have passed by this restaurant a number of times and I have seen many customers in the bar area dressed in very casual clothes... so it makes me question if this restaurant does not like gay people.I am definitely hurt by the treatment that was received at 21 Club and will definitely not be returning. Hopefully management reads these reviews and makes some sort of improvement overall.",4,3,0,Charles B.,"New York, NY",123,124,164
1.0,3/15/2019,"A lifelong dream smashed by a pompous  and snobby ""May Tra Dee."" So, after years and years I finally get to go to the renowned 21 Club on West 52nd. Frank Reagan eats there and his son Jamie chides him for it. Now I know why and rightfully so. The host is a diminutive man who is arrogant and condescending but probably is just shuffling like the rest of us. How he'd like to sit in the lobby of a fancy hotel, amid the high class guys in suits and ties, and hear the bellboy come through shouting, ""Telegram for Mr. Runt, Telegram for Mr. Runt!""",0,2,0,Robert P.,"Warwick, RI",0,63,30

3.0,2/10/2019,"Disappointed.When I walked into 21, I noticed that it did not look as old and storied as I expected. I'd heard they had a flood a few years ago and maybe they remodeled it on the cheap. The bar is very brightly lit and looks brand new and the wood they used is not great. My Manhattan, something I've always wanted to drink at 21, was bruised and watery.The ground floor dining room was cool but again, didn't look that old or authentic. Our Caesar salads were served in the cheapest looking restaurant supply-looking bowls and the croutons looked and tasted store bought.My ravioli was definitely not epic and the husband's chicken hash was bland, bland, bland!Our waiter kind of disappeared at the end of the meal. Supposedly it's a group effort?Unfortunately, 21 Club has now lost what it surely must have once had.",2,2,0,Ari R.,"Beverly Hills, CA",74,966,250
2.0,2/10/2019,"I wouldn't be surprised if this place is kept open by the business of tourists or out-of-towners. It's definitely not a place for Manhattanites. I stopped in for a meal after work, and it was horrifying. The dining room is cramped, with a low ceiling that is completely covered in plastic toy planes, football helmets, other Americana memorabilia, etc. It's hideous and honestly kind of annoying. The food was also hit or miss. Their goat cheese ravioli and complementary bread were excellent. They tasted really great, so I would recommend just stopping in here for a drink and some appetizers, then going elsewhere because the entree and dessert were mediocre. I had the pork loin and chocolate tart. Both were surprisingly dry. It makes the prices they charge kind of unbelievable. And the service was just mediocre as well. The men working as waiters seemed rather stiff and at times condescending. This place honestly seems like its for a 70-year-old white man who needs to feel like he's back in his element.",0,0,0,N.

3.0,2/10/2019,"Made reservations for lunch during restaurant week. The maitrê d' was very pleasant and make check in a breeze. The interior was interesting yet nicely decorated with various trucks and figurines hanging from the wall. It was quite an eclectic idea for decoration, but I like it! The waiter was nice, but unfortunately was not knowledgeable regarding the wines and provided incorrect information when asked about the difference between two wines I had selected. (Minus 1 Star)My friend ordered the Cesar salad as the starter, and the salmon over heirloom rice as her main. I ordered the goat cheese ravioli as my starter, and the pork loin as my main dish. My friend stated that her salad was ""okay"", and noted that it veered more on the lack luster side. She informed that her salmon was ""good"", and didn't expand any further on her thoughts about her food. My goat cheese ravioli was divine! It was served in a light Parmesan cream that really accentuated the dish. The pork loin, on the other hand, was disappointing. The portion was large, but the flavor was lacking. I felt like there was no seasoning (including no salt or pepper) added to this dish. The maple jus also lacked flavor/depth, adding to the over all blandness of the dish. (I think my grandmother would've asked for salt or pepper at this point). After eating such a delightful starter, I was perplexed to have experienced such a bland entree. (Minus 1 Star).The servers were extremely pleasant and consistently checked on us through the meal. (Thanks Reneda!). Overall, I think this place has a nice ambiance but can do better with the flavor of the food.QUICK AND CLEAN:Service: B+Decor: AAmbiance: B+Food: C",1,0,2,Donielle M.,"Manhattan, NY",128,45,58
3.0,2/7/2019,"Went for my boyfriend's birthday during restaurant week. I'll preface by saying that 21 club deserves all the hype that they get for the ambience and aesthetics of the place. They gave us a nice seat and we enjoyed the chef's special soup as well as the truffle Mac and cheese. Those were delicious. But MAN oh MAN, the rest of the course was just confusing. Based off of what the waiters (we had multiple: couldn't even keep track of our orders much less, on our side, who it was we were supposed to talk to) said about the mains, we'd expected them to be spectacular but our chicken and salmon were COLD .

4.0,1/31/2019,"Came here for restaurant week! Had a wonderful time. This used to be a speakeasy back in prohibition era so the front is very casual, with a beautifully decorated back interior with planes on the ceilings, and picnic-like table tops. In terms of appetizers, my friend and I got the Caesar salad and goat cheese ravioli. The goat cheese ravioli has great flavors and the goat cheese definitely stood out. For the entree, We got the Berkshire pork loin and the coq au vin (chicken). The Berkshire pork loin was pretty good, however the chicken in the coq au vin tasted really dry. We also got the truffle Mac and cheese on the side! That was very good, albeit a bit pricy ($14 extra). In terms of dessert, we decided to try all 3 options from the restaurant week menu. The Panna cotta and the cheesecake were definitely the standouts. The panna cotta is light and tasteful. The cheesecake is sort of like your classic rich cheesecake, which can be nice if you like cheesecake. The chocolate tart was pretty dark and dry, even though it had cherry flavors throughout. Overall, very happy with my restaurant week experience. However, not sure if it would be worth it to go back without the restaurant week specials. The food was good, but not outstanding especially if you will be paying full price.",2,0,0,Amber C.,"New York, NY",498,89,166
3.0,1/28/2019,We came for lunch during restaurant week. I had the caesar salad and salmon.. i also took bites of the ravioli and chicken thigh. Everything was just ok. Service here was particularly not impressive. I felt like we were rushed to order and finish our food even though we went at 1:30 and the place was half empty. Also wondered if we would've been treated better perhaps if we were older men in business suits haha.Atmosphere: it's the kinda place i would expect to meet my rich boyfriend's bougie parents,0,0,0,Grace K.,"Oradell, NJ",1,15,13

2.0,1/25/2019,"We've been regulars for lunch at the 21 Club during Restaurant Week for many years. We like the room and the staff. And we used to like the food. But, unfortunately, the menus and serving sizes have been adversely affected after the flood it experienced in 2018. The ravioli appetizer consisted of two smallish ravioli. The other choices were soup or salad. Gone is the fish crudo we always looked forward to.Two of us had coq au vin, and in my book one chicken thigh does not a portion make. The celery root and parsnip puree that accompanied it was delicious, not all cream and butter as I feared. I would have liked more of it. Desserts were good but not outstanding. What was outstanding is the bread.Unless the menu improves for the summer Restaurant Week, we're going to look elsewhere for something more appealing.",0,1,0,Sharon K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,0

5.0,1/20/2019,"21 club is one place that deserves to have a Michelin star. I've been here multiple times and have always found the service and food to be consistent. The restaurant is very classy with a 1920s-esque ambiance. Men will need to wear a jacket in order to enter, but if you forget, they have jackets you can borrow free of charge. Ladies are not allowed to wear jeans or black jeans. They start out the meal with warm fresh bread. To start, Caesar salad was phenomenal. For an entree. would highly recommend the filet cooked medium rare with mashed potatoes or truffle mac and cheese. All of the waiters are very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. They also have wonderful sommeliers here who recommend great bottles within your specified price range. For dessert, I would recommend the chocolate torte or bananas foster. 21 club has a lot of rich history, being one of the original speakeasy in New York and serving many of the Presidents, and has consistently been one of my favorite spots in the city.

5.0,1/12/2019,"What an institution! There's a reason they have been in business since prohibition. First off, I love a place that strictly enforces a dress code. Keeps the riff-raff out. If I could suggest one thing...that a more strict dress code for the bar as well. Now to the dining experience in the Bar Room. First, the Maitre D Aaron is the most accommodating and professional there is. I have been here numerous times and he never disappoints when getting me a table at last minute even if the place is crowded (which it is usually is, so reservations recommended). I always request Flavio as my waiter and he is also the best in the business. He always greets me with a smile and handshake and remembers that I always start off with a Grey Goose martini and a dozen oysters. You can never go wrong with anything on the menu. Some of my favorites are the filet mignon, lump crab, octopus carpaccio, crab cake, veal cheek and of course...the classic 21 Burger with American cheese. For dessert there's no wrong choice. But if I may...order the baked Alaska. Flaming good! There are so many choices in Manhattan for great food. But if you like a place with history, great atmosphere, delicious food, strong cocktails, upscale friendly staff and patrons who know how to dress to impress (that's right, no hoodies or sneakers thank you) then 21 Club is for you. BTW, they have a fantastic 3 course pre theater menu at a fixed price if you are going to a show. LOVE 21 CLUB!",2,0,2,James H.,"San Francisco, CA",0,11,0
1.0,1/9/2019,"21 has been one of my favorite restaurants for years, both with personal endeavors and client entertainment. However, an experience I had on Wednesday evening which makes me seriously reconsider.My fiancée and I stopped in for a quick pre-dinner drink around 7, hoping to catch a round before our reservations elsewhere.  Knowing both that our dinner destination did not hold anything beyond Business Casual dress, in congress with him being in town short-term with a limited wardrobe; I explicitly confirmed that afternoon the Lounge's Business Casual dress code.  As I had raved about my past experiences there and wanted to share it with him, I confirmed his outfit matched the requirements.Upon entry, we were promptly turned away for inappropriate dress by the staff, in what turned out to be a relatively embarrassing scene for us.  Before even asking whether there was space at the bar, we were given a speech about how the Club does not permit those without jackets and particularly those with a hood.  I returned that the Lounge is Business Casual, as detailed on the website, which was agreed, but we were still not allowed in.  The offending hood was on my fiancée's winter parka (not a hoodie), attached to the coats we were both still wearing from having just entered.  Given this was not a collegiate keg party, both were clearly pieces we intended to check upon confirmation of space, or retaining if we immediately left.After several minutes, we were ultimately offered to check said winter coats and borrow a blazer from the stock.  We promptly left due to the reception received until that point, ultimately having a wonderful experience at our original destination.While he may be military and thus not in Manhattan frequently, I live in town and have entertained clients happily at the 21 for years.  This was an embarrassment and I honestly have difficulties thinking I'll ever do so again.I'm happy there are many other restaurants/bars in NYC that appreciate it gets cold in January.",6,3,2,Meredith C.,"New York, NY",0,4,0

2.0,12/19/2018,"Some unfortunate soul booked this venue for our holiday party. We opened the door to a loud, noisy, sea of white men ages 40+. At least we had a room upstairs (3rd Floor) for our private party, which was decorated with beer steins (kinda cool) with mint green walls (not cool). Christmas decor was absolutely boring and dull, like something you'd see in a dollar store. Food was mediocre with turkey so dry I was trying not to get choked to death at the first bite. And who thought tuna tartare on a cucumber made for awesome party food? Oh and foie gras?!! Some of us  CARE about animals and I was absolutely disgusted that was chosen to be served. For some reason, no one thought that having music playing at our holiday party was a good idea either, so we sat there with nothing but noisy party chatter to enjoy in the background. The two stars come from the absolutely great service we received from everyone working the party (and the wine). Thanks to you!

My experience had been truly spectacular until last Friday.  We were barely greeted by the maitre d and then escorted to a cramped table in the back ( after having made reservations over 6 weeks ago). The wait staff was hurried, disinterested, barely accessible, and bordering on rude. The food was sub par.  Over cooked , dry chicken hash. Creamed spinach with almost no cream.

1.0,11/22/2018,"My husband and I just spent Thanksgiving at this establishment.  It was our first time there, and we walked out extremely disappointed. Not only was the food mediocre (dry turkey, had to ask two servers for a side of gravy, and then wait 10 min to receive it after getting out meals, sour cranberry sauce, absolutely no plate presentation, and basic pub decor) but we were met with prejudice.  It is sad that in NYC, on Thanksgiving in 2018, being met with prejudice is still a relevant experience. As I sat in a room full of all Caucasian people, with the exception of one other woman of color, I realized that we were receiving poor service because we look younger than we are, and being Asian was against us in this place.  The meal itself was $450 for the two of us, the service was so poor, I can not imagine ever setting foot back into that place.

Did not like the weird and spicy ketchup substitute. My friend liked her lamb chops. While service at the bar was excellent, service at the table was lackluster and distant. Also, did not appreciate the obnoxious large party that was seated next to us, you'd think in an empty restaurant (late at night at that point), they don't have to cram everyone next to each other.Loved the toys hanging from the ceiling.

I dropped off many celebs at this place and vowed one day to come here as a customer, and be able to afford it. Granted affording it was the hard way, I spent hundreds of thousands raising kids, so they can pay for my dinner on my 71st Birthday. The night was magical, and I am sure to reflect on this evening frequently. The food and service was excellent, and the ambiance was better than excellent. I had the Filet Mignon, cooked to perfection and the $12.00 order of French Fries, which was my only ""Ho Hum"" on the meal. They were just a little better than McDonalds, but did not hold up to Nathans. Everyone raved about their meals. Then came a VIP tour of the Speakeasy Basement which was only offered because the staff thought i was Al Pacino. Amazing tour, amazing history, and a wine offering that is probably one of the best in NYC with Petreus and Esxchuzeau's all over the place, not to mention private wines kept for moguls and celebs, that won't be back for them for various reasons,foremost and including: because they are dead and it would be difficult.

4.0,8/18/2018,"This review is specifically for the Summer 2018 Restaurant week menu. I made a reservation on Opentable. This was a great price to have dinner at a classic NYC restaurant that I probably won't be able to afford for quite a few years! Upon arrival, we were sent to the bar area. This was my only complaint about the whole night; we had drinks elsewhere before, so we didn't want another cocktail, but had to wait around 20 minutes after our 8:30 reservation time for the table to be ready. It was a beautiful space to wait, and granted we probably wouldn't have minded at all if we were having drinks! For dinner, we loved our intimate little table in the Bar room. The restaurant week menu had some tasty options, and we also appreciated some delicious lower-priced wine by the glass suggestions. My boyfriend had the crabmeat soup, which was delicious, and I loved my wedge salad with creamy, fresh cheese (if you like blue cheese!!) The lamb cavatelli and roast chicken entrees were solid choices; nothing extraordinary, but well-done, tasty, simple dishes.  The desserts were also delicious! The service was exceptional, especially because I put we were celebrating a birthday on Opentable, but didn't specify whose it was.

We also both got the lamb bolognese which looked like a small portion when it came out but the cavatelli was very dense. It was also delicious. Great sauce. Pana cotte for desert.

For dessert I initially ordered the Coconut Panna Cotta w/lime gelee & mango chutney, but after 1 bite I could not continue. The lime gelee is very strong it is the only thing u can taste, I could not even taste the Panna Cotta itself. I informed my waiter that the dessert was not to my liking. He suggested the Dark Chocolate Mousse instead. He brought the chocolate mousse dessert w/strawberry compote & almond crunch ice cream in place of the Panna Cotta. This dessert was definitely better. The best part was the almond crunch ice cream which was really delicious. The mousse itself did not have enough dark chocolate flavor, it was not great but ok. I felt that the appetizer & entree were both great, but the desserts overall lacking & needs improvement.  I also had a glass of 2013 LoLo Albariño Rías Baixas white wine which was nice & refreshing & paired well w/my meal. The service here was impeccable. My waiter Robert L was amazing & attentive.  This is the type of service I wish I had at every restaurant.  Definitely 5 stars in terms of service.The location itself is quite historic.  A prohibition era speakeasy.  Every President since FDR has dined here except for George W Bush. Dining here gives u a feeling of nostalgia. All in all I highly recommend 21 Club.",1,0,0,Lil W.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,24,115

The lamb bolognese was delicious, staff was bountiful and extremely attentive.Knocking a star off because multiple times I would hear the staff and customers talking politics and raving about Donald Trump and how he eats there. I found it inappropriate for the waiter to partake and very loudly, might I add, in such a conversation.

2.0,7/30/2018,"Not impressed. The tables were so crowded we can almost rub elbows with the table next door. Our waiter completely ignored us throughout the evening probably because we look young. He was so much more attentive to other tables which the patrons are people in their 40-50s. We had to wait 15+ minutes to receive our food menu, long after we started on our cocktails.  No one asked how any of our food was, except the bus boy when I didn't finish my main course.  I had the most eye contact and interactions with my waiter when he was taking the check/ credit card from us. We even had to ask the bus boy to get the check. If you want good service from this place, make sure you look old enough before you step into the door. The food was not bad. Crab cake and the smoked salmon appetizers were pretty good. The dessert was not good.  The flan was not eggy but flour-y, and the coconut panna cotta was bitter with a layer of weird lime jello on it. Overall I will not return to this restaurant. If you are looking for fine dining experience with some history behind the place, there are plenty other restaurants to try.",2,1,0,Christie C.,"ASTORIA, NY",3,10,2
2.0,7/28/2018,"I don't believe I've ever written a negative review before, but my dinner at 21 Club pushed me to do so. Sidenote: this is during restaurant week, so I sincerely hope this was just a fluke due to the staff being overwhelmed.Last night, I went to dinner at Club 21 with my parents. The doorman was great - he ran across the street, held an umbrella for my mother as we crossed, opened the door, etc. 5 stars for him. We came in, mentioned our reservation, and waited 10 min for our table (which is perfectly fine).Once we sat down, that's when the service went downhill. Maybe it was because we opted not to order drinks and wanted to just eat from the Restaurant Week menu? That's not an excuse. Anyways - waiter brings water for the table, and while pouring spills it on me. And doesn't say a word. Ok, no big deal. We order our food, and the staff brings bread + butter. The bread tastes a bit stale, and the butter is cold. Again, not a big deal but I would have expected more from this place. 15 min later, the waiters bring the salads and soup we ordered for appetizers. As the waiter is trying to serve my mother first (which I 100% support), he tells her to move her bread plate and utensils out of the way so he could put down the soup. In my opinion, it shouldn't be her job to rearrange her table. Appetizers are ok. I enjoyed my salmon, while my parents were ambivalent about their wedge salad and soup.Next, the waiters bring the main courses. Once again, my mom is asked to hand her plate and utensils over before she gets her food (while my dad's and mine just get picked up by the waiter. Main course - lamb and chicken - were once again ok. Nothing special but not bad. We also ordered the mac + cheese and mashed potato sides. Mac + cheese I enjoyed while mashed potatoes were lacking flavor. Also would have been nice for the waiter to mention that when my mom ordered the chicken, it came with potatoes, and getting mashed potatoes on the side might be too much (double potatoes). And the exact same thing for me when I ordered lamb with pasta, and mac + cheese on the side (double pasta). But I don't blame them for this piece, just a suggestion.As we finished our main course and waited for our dessert, the table next to us left, and one of the waiters began cleaning and setting up the table for the next party. In the process of cleaning, he him my mom with the tablecloth twice. Again, happens, but maybe apologize and be a bit more careful / discreet?The dessert (dark chocolate mousse) was not very good either.Interesting spot and unique decor, but I definitely won't be back.",4,1,0,Dima K.,"New York, NY",409,8,0

3.0,7/13/2018,"So last night my wife and I ate here because it was a promise to her 91yo father who ate there in the 50's. Saw some slightly negative reviews prior, but we were committed. Unfortunately, the negative reviews are correct.Upon our arrival we were greeted and offered time to have a cocktail in the bar area, which we did. We quickly ordered our drinks because we knew what we wanted (old fashion).  Everyone was very nice, but 15 minutes later we were without our drinks even though the bar was less than 8' away. It wasn't until we inquired about them that we received them about two minutes later.  Shortly after, we were asked if we wanted to move to our dinner table, so we took the hint and moved.  I will say the drinks were excellent. Our waiter came to the table and greeted us and for the most part and was very attentive until the end (explained later).  Food was just ok and I had to return my filet after it was brought to me medium well when I had requested it medium rare. The meat quality was not up to par and just didn't taste great. My wife's fluke was average and somewhat dry, but not bad.So, at some point after my wife and I shared the creme brûlée and expressos, our waiter left for the night without ever saying anything.  We waited and waited for the check and after 20 minutes finally asked another waiter.  He then brought the check and since we were in a hurry I just gave him my cc. When I was able to read the bill after I discovered a $12 charge for water we never ordered or were provided. I didn't care at that point and was frustrated so I pointed it out to the waiter when we left and he simply shrugged his shoulders and apologized.Needless to say, we won't be returning.

4.0,6/27/2018,"The food here is amazing. However, the prices could be lower. I tried: lentil soup (soup of the day), steak tartare, chocolate and raspberry soufflés, and decaf coffee. All of these dishes were out of this world. The lentil soup had ground meat, so it almost tasted like a light, spicy chili. The steak tartare, while small, was excellently garnished and had a thick texture. The soufflés, which took 15 minutes to prepare, were warm and light. The raspberry soufflé was my favorite since it was so unique and even tasted a little tart. But lastly, the decaf coffee-- oh my goodness. It was the best coffee I have ever had. I have my suspicions that it has chocolate or some other flavoring in it. It just was not bitter at all and tasted divine. I might even come again just to have the coffee.     The only downside to this place is the atmosphere. It is clearly very upscale, which means you will be surrounded by Midtown workers and even celebrities. There certainly was a pressure to look presentable and be very polite, especially since I was one of the few people there at the time and waiters were constantly checking in.

For a restaurant that has such an illustrious past, I was VERY disappointed.My family and I went to celebrate my 21st birthday here and were seated next to an OBNOXIOUS large party of people. They were screaming, cackling, cursing, and were overall incredibly drunk and rude party. (Half of them never even touched their food or dessert!) When my mother went to go speak to the manager, Carol, she was brushed off and was told that management's hope was that they'd eventually settle down. It was clear that management simply did not want to deal with the problem. Our rude neighbors never settled down and my family and I were forced to dine with our obnoxious neighbors for the entire evening.The food overall was delicious and the birthday cake was superb. Our wait staff took EXCELLENT care of us and did their best to make our experience first rate in spite of such a disruptive party next to us.It is very unlikely that I'll ever go back. The management needs to GET A CLUE. For a $500+ bill, I would have expected management to nip obnoxious, rude, and disruptive behavior in the bud. At the very least, they should have offered to move us to a quieter area of the restaurant.

So part of that they project an old school vibe including a dress code.  About an hour unto dinner I receive a call from my wife saying they need to know who the reservation is under.  I come out front (it's not a huge place).

It is not at all enjoyable having refills on drinks and wine pushed on you before you halfway finish the first glass. Especially given a Manhatten cocktail will set you back $19. This place knows all the tricks ... the first drink you get will be absolutely weak. They start getting stronger on the second round. They know you'll order another if you don't feel a buzz after the first, so essentially you are spending $40 on two drinks (weak and strong) in order to get a bit mellow.After going throug the gauntlet of ordering dinner with our waitor ... who acted like a souvineer hawker on a cruise ship dock ... ""Would you like salads? How about soup? What sides can I bring you? No sides? Are you sure? You don't want dessert? I'm going to bring you the menus just in case."" Dude, I know how to order from a menu!! Don't act like an Italian mother in law!! I know what I want to eat ... stop pushing stuff on me that I know I don't want.This really ruined the experience as the waitor always seemed to be right on top of us pushing more sides, drinks, etc. on us. We couldn't even enjoy the conversation ... I would never do business here.The food was (as always ...) average at best. My medium rare steak was basically raw. (Other restaurants would call this 'Blue'). At $56 for a small filet, this is very unacceptable. My date wanted only a salad. The waitor kept pushing more food until she finally felt guilty and ordered 'steamed vegetables' thinking it was a side. A $35 entree of vegetables and mushrooms came out on a dinner plate. This is addition to her salad, which is all she really wanted.I wanted so badly to leave this asshole a 15% tip but she made me leave 20% so as not to cause a scene. The restaurant is cozy, inviting and has a fun vibe. Lots of regulars go here because of its history. I love that gentlemen are not allowed in unless they are wearing a jacket and no jeans are allowed. It bugs me that a polo shirt and jeans is the customary uniform at fine dining establishments these days. Kudos to 21 Club for enforcing the dress code Now if they can just replace the waitstaff and chefs ...",8,5,2,E T.,"West Hollywood, CA",34,520,191

It would not be my place of choice to enjoy a meal just from the vibe.However I was here for a private event so we went to the 3rd floor where it was nicely lit and the dining setting was pleasant. Staff were also very courteous. The food: Caesar salad was as usual, chicken entree, chicken was a bit dry, and last was a cheesecake dessert. That was very light and not too sweet which I liked it.

3.0,4/5/2017,"Club 21 has been around a long time and it rides its reputation surprisingly well. It is on the expensive side typical for midtown Manhattan), but the food - especially the steaks - are good, the bartender knows how to mix drinks (they make some killer martinis, and big ones, too!) and there waiters know their stuff; many of them seem to have been around almost as long as the restaurant. It has a clubby, dark atmosphere with a lot of toys hanging from the ceiling in the main dining room, which adds character while imposing some concerns for anyone suffering from claustrophobia. And the seating can be awfully close, really way too close, meaning that we're serious about this place being a concern for claustrophobes. That seating bothers us a lot, and we don't go back often for that reason. That said, they do serve up some good, marbled steaks -- we're fond of the large filet mignon -- and the steak tartare is about as tasty. The sides are ok, not exceptional, and the salads and bread are delicious. Honestly, we've never sampled anything but steaks here, so others will have to rate those dishes. We mentioned the bartenders, but please note they have an outstanding wine list here, and the prices aren't as high as in many other fine dining establishments in the area. So in sum, there's a lot to like here and some things we don't especially care for, hence three stars: good but not exceptional.",4,2,1,Bill S.,"Litchfield, CT",209,601,2
4.0,4/2/2017,"We had not been to '21 in a number of years and had heard that it was not so great under new management.  I'm happy to report that we had a different experience.  Our party of four sat at the bar first and had wine/cocktails.  The bartender was friendly and helpful, offering me a taste of a wine I was unfamiliar with.  They were very relaxed about our taking our table and encouraged us to sit at the bar as long as we liked.  The Bar Room dining area is an absolutely wonderful old New York relic.  Fortunately the furniture has been updated and improved without losing that clubby old school vibe.  While I don't think the titans of industry come here the way they used to (President Trump notwithstanding..), and I believe there were many tourists in the crowd, the overall impression was of a lot of nice well heeled people enjoying a festive Saturday night.  I think their rigid dress code helps with this.On to the menu and the food.  We found everything we ordered to be beautifully presented and pretty delicious.  The tomato and oyster soup was a hit with those who ordered it.  I had a perfect little raviolo with buttery sauce and an egg cooked in.  This would be a great lunch entree with a salad as it was very rich.  The old standard entrees were there and the chicken hash is as good as it ever was.  Such an old-fashioned, comforting dish!  The chicken paillard is good and very pretty, topped with salad and surrounded by micro-chopped vegetables.  The burger was all it ever has been, which is good.  (Tip - if you are planning to order the burger, sit at the bar and order it there, $15 less expensive!)  The only miss on the entrees was the Dover sole which was OK but definitely NOT worth its $72 price tag.  Desserts were rich, flavorful and definitely old school:  rice pudding, profiteroles, BAKED ALASKA which was flambé at the table - when was the last time you even heard of Baked Alaska?  We loved them all.  Overall this was a very fun evening but I would be remiss if I did not comment on the service.  We had several different staff attending our table and even so, the service was slow and sloppy.  We waited a long time before even having a drink order taken and one of the drinks was forgotten and never arrived.  Also a long wait between the delivery of menus and the taking of orders and a pretty long wait between courses. All in all it took three hours to complete dinner.  We had a great time but that seems like a slow pace.Final comment and the reason for the fourth star - the decor and vibe of this place take you back to a glamorous NYC that doesn't exist anymore.  Really fun to revisit that even for a night.",1,0,0,S M.,"New Canaan, CT",0,184,0

The bad - stuck up, pretentious, rude/surly staff, a male domain where women seem to be banished to the menial tasks (coat check/restroom), they made us feel like we should be privileged to be there, food average, did their best to get us in and out in less than 1 hour.The joke is that although they are trying to be like some posh silver service restaurant, with the attitude to match, they provided a dessert spoon for soup, and when asked if they could do a latte the response was 'we can do anything'.

4.0,2/7/2017,"So I reallyyy didn't want to give 21 Club 4 stars.  But I did. And it was well earned. 21 Club has been on my NYC restaurant bucket list since I was a freshman in college.  I am a sucker for those old, NYC institutions that are abundant with history, good food, a touch of class, and best of all - secrets.  I came to 21 Club with a preconceived notion that it was going to be extremely snobby - likely driven by dining cost, decor, and celebrity clientele. Despite my preconceptions, I was delightfully surprised and delighted by my experience at the famous 21 Club.  Alas, we did visit for Restaurant Week, and received a superb meal at a fraction of the cost.  However, after dining here, I would certainly return many times over at the full price tag. We arrived a bit early so we could grab cocktails at the bar.  We were kindly greeted by the host and invited to check our jackets.  I had a classic Lemon Drop Martini while the beau had a Makers & ginger.  Fantastic.  The best thing about old school institutions is they KNOW old school cocktails. When we were ready to eat, we were promptly seated at our table in the back.  We were mesmerized by the chachkies hanging from the ceiling.  Our server was just OK, even if it was Restaurant Week I still yearned top-notch, white glove service. It was good, adequate, but not the service quality aligned with the famed 21 Club. I ordered the Kale Salad (GREAT!), Chicken Grand-Mere (FABULOUS) and the Chocolate Brownie Sundae. They also had a fabulous wine list to accompany the Restaurant Week menu in the $30-40 range. Overall the food was great.  We were not rushed, the food came out at leisure, so we were able to take in all the history and ambiance around us.  It was old school NYC at it's finest. I'm knocking off a star not only due to the lackluster service, but we asked the hostess on our way out if we could have a tour of the wine cellar and were denied.  Her response was because it was Restaurant Week that they were very busy and could not accommodate.  I found this a poor excuse and off-putting, especially seeing as though the restaurant did not seem especially packed during our 7:00-9:30p seating. Highly recommend for Restaurant Week, a celebratory dinner, or a very high end date night.

4.0,2/5/2017,"This was the second of three iconic New York restaurants I have on my 50th Birthday Year Celebration list, and 21 did not disappoint!The decor changes from room to room -- with an entry way that opens one way into a bar and seating area with wood panels and a smaller number of table, and the other way into a small foyer with a large, comfortable sofa to sit on while waiting for your party. This leads into the bigger dining room, where we sat. The tables are uniquely shaped to allow for pairs or groups to sit and enjoy real conversation, even though restaurant overall can get rather loud. No matter -- the noise was more like background music and didn't impede our evening.We went as part of restaurant week, and all ordered from their suggested menu. Two of us had the potato leek soup; rich, creamy and flavorful and perfect on such a cold evening. One other guest had the kale salad with roasted sweet potatoes, which she also enjoyed.For the main course, we actually all got the same thing -- the chicken grandmere, and it was delicious; even after a little time being out on the table, it didn't dry out. It came with mashed potatoes that were flavored with bacon, although no little pieces. Really delicious.When we placed our orders, we were asked to say what we wanted for dessert -- I didn't think I'd have room, but I made the sacrifice... :) Two of us had the brownie sundae, and one had the carrot cake. The sundae was outstanding; the carrot cake was probably the best-flavored carrot cake I'd ever had. The traditional icing was a little lighter, piped over the top like cupcake frosting, so a little less dense. Just delicious.Our servers were wonderful, whether refilling water, taking and delivering the food orders, or giving us suggestions when we asked for them.And a special shout out to the woman who worked in the restroom -- she engaged every person who came in in conversation. Because that's what people need to do, especially now -- greet each other, connect as human beings, be polite, express gratitude, even for a gesture as small as handing someone a towel after they've washed their hands.

Well I've never gotten a definitive answer!When you enter the 21 Club you enter a fiefdom that has not changed much over the years.  Don't expect a quick bite to eat - things will move at a different speed.  When your reservation is ready to be honored, you will still have to wait for the maître d to present you with the menu.  By that time you probably already have had a drink and bread basket served.  For a recent luncheon, I started with a nice Kale salad and roasted sweet potatoes. I followed that up with a tasty lamb osso bucco over creamy polenta.   And desert was a memorable bread pudding with cranberry compote and cinnamon ice cream.  The waiter was both competent and friendly.It takes a while to get started at 21 Club (and guys don't forget your suit jacket) but once the food starts coming, it is all worth it!",7,4,5,Jeff H.,"Margareten, Vienna, Austria",241,1104,7351

My family had reservations for 4 on Friday December 30th.  My family includes me, my wife, and my 18 and 14 yr old sons.2.) The hostess called my wife 4 times in total to verify our reservation and also to make sure we were aware that sport-coats are required for me.  We were told this when we made the reservations, so we didn't need to be reminded 4 times.3.) We arrived on time and the Maitre D checked us in and took us to our table.  For two of my family to get to their seats the table needed to be pulled out because our table was 4"" apart from another table that had guests.  I was on the end and it was next to the waiter's butler station where they fill glasses with ice take care of minor items.  It was literally a revolving door of wait staff shuffling in and out within a few inches of me.  I have no issue what the butler station.  My disappointment was the distraction and how close it was to me.  We requested to be placed at another table and they did accommodate.  I don't know for sure, but my thought was because we had a young family perhaps they thought this was the best place to put us.4.) head waiter.  I asked for a glass of Cabernet.  I was surprised I wasn't offered a choice.  When he finally asked if we would like appetizers I ordered a seafood tower and his exact words were ""for the whole table to share?""  I nodded yes.  Wasn't sure what that meant exactly as I've never witnessed one person eat a tower by himself.5.) The menu was not described.  There were not recommendations offered.6.) head waiter.

I had two Manhattans which were strong enough to justify the price tag. We always sit downstairs in the bar room. The warmth of the deep reds and dark woods are instantly calming. The place feels like our own cozy nook in some early 20th century mansion.We started with two shellfish towers and the crab cake. The shellfish towers are our favorites. Nothing bad to say about a giant metal tower overflowing with crab, lobster, oysters, clams, and shrimp. All the seafood was fresh and rich.I had the steak tartare for my meal and it was TO DIE FOR. There's a reason it's one of their classic dishes. The steak tartare was sweet, spicy, juicy, and smooth. The meat was tender and simply bursting with flavor. The best way I can describe it is ""eating a cloud made of steak."" The capers and scallions tied the whole dish together.I got the ice wine for dessert. It was a fun, smooth, and sweet glass of wine. Perfect after-dinner drink--right up there with Bailey's and coffee for me.21 is simply one of my favorite spots in all of NYC. The location, the atmosphere, the food, the ambience are all top-notch. I knocked off a star this time around because the service wasn't quite up to snuff considering the high prices. Our server pretty much disappeared after dessert and we waited a while for a check. Had to ask another server! Nobody wants to feel forgotten about after purchasing a $1200 meal.

The air conditioning was malfunctioning, I asked three times if I could remove my jacket (finally was ""approved"" ) and the wines were poorly advised. My wife asked if the tuna was spicy, she was told no. It was too spicy. Our main courses were fine. Burger was excellent but not sure if worth $36 on its own. The ambiance is lovely. I should have stuck with the house Hobbs cabernet however. After a glass of the house  Hobbs, I ordered a 2011 Bordeaux and they brought me a 2013 without declaring the updated year. Then took the sommelier's recommendation on a 2010 Bordeaux (in theory better than 2011) and it felt turned. I felt like I couldn't send back another bottle.

We were told to wait in differing areas by different staff members, and they made it clear that we were ""in the way."" We didn't sit at the bar because we don't drink (that much).Upon being lead to the dining area, my first impression is that the place is extremely dark, and the decor is tacky, dirty, and old.The service was sub-par - it seemed like our server didn't want to serve us. I looked around and saw other staff standing around, talking to each other, and generally ignoring customers. I overheard two staff members talking negatively about a table.The food wasn't good. We were a pretty large party, and we all ordered different dishes to try as it was the first time for all of us. Nothing stood out as being spectacular, and we all agreed the food is mediocre.It appears to me as if the 21 Club is going by momentum how it used to be, but no longer is.

Another article was generated some time back, this one in The Daily Mail, when two diners to the club spent $16k on two bottles of Bordeaux. That's a lot of media coverage that but The 21 Club has just the kind of history to give such occurrences the authenticity to make them true happenings.While the restaurants famous Chicken Hash still remains on the menu at nearly $50 it is something you can easily skip for the Steak Tartare which is made to perfection on a classic recipe with unquestionable produce. You can't ask for a better place in town to provide you with Old Fashioneds either, none of that mushed cherry to be found here. All in all you shouldn't be visiting The 21 Club for the menu however.

I went to 21 Club for the restaurant week lunch menu. I've been here for drinks but this was my first time dining there. I was led to check my coat as soon as I entered. The seating process was a bit disorganized with multiple hostesses. It was clear that communication was a bit choppy at the front of the house.Dining Experience - I ordered the venison pot pie, which came quickly after ordering. The puff pastry was light and the meat was tender, not gamey. Perfect.   I had the faroe islands salmon for my entrée - stellar dish as well. The salmon and heirloom cauliflower were cooked perfectly.Dessert was underwhelming and perhaps this only applies to their restaurant week desserts. I had the pear tart (poached pear in the middle over vanilla custard, sprinkled with walnuts). Not too sweet but I wasn't blown away.Service - Kind of aggravating. My mother and I waited much longer than others with the same reservation time, which was a bit confusing. I think the lack of communication between hostesses caused choppy cadence of seating.

During the day it's somewhat difficult to see and I would have preferred a better lit environment to at least see what I was eating so that I could fully appreciate it.For appetizers, my friend got the soup of the day, which was deliciously creamy, thick, and flavorful. I got venison pot pie which was very tasty and juicy because the red wine they used as a sauce highlighted venison's taste and added vibrancy to a dish.For entrees. my friend got the salmon which was amazingly done in a creamy sauce, way beyond my expectations for a simple, unassuming salmon dish. I got the wild poussin, which was delicious with the herbs on the chicken and the wine reduction sauce with the potatoes and vegetables. My portion was very small, so don't expect to over eat depending on the dish that you order.The desserts were extremely sweet, and that's coming from the person who likes sweet. My friend got the caramel toffee, which was crunchy and rich, and I got the cinnamon sundae, which was a disappointment. The waiter recommended the sundae because the chefs make all their ice creams in house, so naturally I was excited. But instead of ice cream, I got two slices of overly sweet caramelized peach sprinkled with cinnamon and a teaspoon of ice cream on top. My friend's toffee cake had the same exact amount of the same exact ice cream on top. Only I ordered ice cream sundae, not overly sweet caramelized peach.

4.0,2/2/2016,"It's true, all the guys (or should I say men) wear blazers/jackets, even the waiters.  But a simple nice dress will get the ladies in.  So girls, it's time to dress up and treat yourself to a classy meal underneath all those toys and sports memorabilia hanging from the ceiling.My girlfriends and I made a reservation for dinner during Restaurant Week (RW).  $38 for one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert is a steal at this venue considering how that's the price for just one of the cheaper entrees here!  Their RW selections are denoted with a small jockey icon next to the item.  We were able to choose amongst 4 appetizers (3 since a Caesar salad doesn't count for me), 4 entrees, and 3 desserts.BAR 21 EXPERIENCEWhile waiting for my friends, I had a seat at the bar.  I wasn't offered a menu but already saw their drink menu (~$17 cocktails) online beforehand and ordered a Blood and Sand cocktail.  I'm not a fan of whiskey but the rye and vermouth came out tasty with the orange juice and cherry liqueur.  Hence, the hefty price tag bought me a strong concoction and complimentary bar snacks (mixed nuts, wasabi peas, cheesy crackers).  They give you the option to bill your drink to your dinner tab but I paid for it right away.  I brought my drink to the dinner table once my friends arrived and one of the waiters offered to carry my drink on his silver metal plate.  Damn, I felt like royalty!  He even pulled out my chair for me (and turned the table to help my friends get into the inside seats).  Plus, we sat at the same table President Richard Nixon did if that adds any bonus points?Now onwards to dinner @ BAR ROOM (dining area on ground floor)APPETIZERS - I can't choose a favorite, they were all so good!!- Chef's Root Vegetables Soup -- creamy, light, flavorful, large portion!- Hamachi Sashimi -- thin slices that are seared with an almost chewy texture and spicy fresh kick of flavor from their yuzu dressing- Venison Pot Pie -- flaky golden crust with hearty filling insideENTREES - Short Ribs and Salmon were my favorites!- Faroe Islands Salmon -- I love how the outermost layer of the salmon is flakey/crunchy and the inside was so wonderfully soft and juicy. - Red Wine Braised Short Ribs (beef) -- gloriously shredded and screaming with a mouthwatering array of subtle flavors- Herb Crusted Poussin (baby chicken) -- tender chicken sprinkled with a very spicy herb that reminds me of wasabi and threw me off.  The brussel sprouts and root vegetables were roasted to perfection but the sauce in the dish was a tad too sweet for me.(The other RW entree was their Macaroni and Cheese with shrimp and lobster, which sounds really good too.)DESSERTS - They were all decent and well put together but nothing spectacular.- Chocolate Sticky Toffee -- came with a candle for my friend's birthday (hehe surprise!) I love how the chocolate wasn't too rich or sweet but still very chocolately.  The toffee flavor was there.- Cinnamon Ice Cream Sundae -- this was an explosion of flavor and texture with cinnamon ice cream, vanilla custard, and sweet caramelized apple.  I loved the first two bites but was completely overwhelmed in trying to finish it.- Pear Tart -- very cute mini pear sitting on the tart.  I've had tarts before (without the pear) where the nuts were glazed with so much sugar.  The Pear Tart here is nothing like that!  The tart, although hard, does crumble and the nuts are not overly sweet since the pear adds a fruity sugary taste.CONCLUSIONI would say that the RW dining experience here was a success.  I was expecting top notch service and ambience (which were present) and only mediocre food.  I'm impressed that their RW menu had good food.  Definitely worth it for RW!  3 courses for $38 before tax and tip.P.S.  Coat check is free but make sure to tip at the end.",6,1,2,Jing X.,"Brooklyn, NY",260,660,2792

It is not that they don't have enough staff, it is that the staff are all disgruntled and grumpy. The gentleman serving water spilled water all over my dessert, did not apologize, and ran off. My ice cream was swimming in a sea of ice water. Service was slow.I ordered the sashimi and salmon, which were quite delicious and made to specification, along with a decent cappuccino. The total bill for restaurant week for lunch came out to about $55 per person. I wanted to tip more, but the ice cream swimming in water made me cringe and I decided to tip 10%, but really should've been a symbolic 0%.My colleague got the lobster mac n cheese.

1.0,2/1/2016,"Went for restaurant week dinner. Not being exaggerated, it could be one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. I understand that during restaurant week, some restaurants might not pay full attention to the services and delicacy of food as they usually do. However, no restaurants can be ruder and more insincere than 21 club. The service was horrible from the very beginning. The waiter who took our order was condescending and impatient, just because we had some questions about the menu and took a bit longer to decide what to have. I mean excuse me isn't it very normal? What's more, they charged us $6 per person for just hot water. HOT WATER FOR $12!!! After I expressed my confusion, another extremely rude guy came to explain impatiently about how hot water was counted as service, so it was charged reasonably. He even rolled his eyes on me. Which restaurant on earth hires waiters who roll their eyes on customers!!!!??? Anyway it was a total waste of 2 hours of my precious life and $50. I will NEVER EVER EVER visit this restaurant again. If a restaurant does this badly during restaurant week, it definitely says something about its performance in general. I will not recommend anyone to go to this restaurant, well, unless you feel like wasting your time and money. Good luck 21 club! Keep losing the tradition and competition in New York City, where so many good restaurants are improving and booming!I wish I could've asked the names of these two rudest waiters who took orders and explaining ridiculous charge of hot water, but they are both in suits.

Since I was the last to arrive, the host walked us to our table, the carpet vanished to hardwood floors and there were various types of artifacts (model air planes, trucks, bowling pins, football helmets, and etc.) hanging from the ceiling. Once seated, Chauncey and John presented themselves and proceeded to give us the drink menu. Now the fun starts.I had a red wine to start and the rest is as follow:Appetizer: Hamachi Sashimi - avocado purée, frisée, spicy-yuzu dressingMain Course: Faroe Islands Salmon - chermoula marinade, heirloom cauliflower, lime yogurtDessert: Chocolate Sticky Toffee - butterscotch sauce, vanilla ice creamThe service was immaculate, superb, and outstanding. I can go on and on but I would like to thank Chauncey & John and the others for making my dining experience incredible. Their 3 course meal for restaurant week will receive a 4 + + stars from me.The final résistance of the night was the opportunity to see the wine cellar. Learning the history of the cellar was amazing but entering was even better. Seeing famous people names for example, President Nixon and Isaac Mizrahi on wine bottles was great.  They also have a beautiful table in the cellar that seats 20 people for a special event and an original booth where people would sat to make deals in NY.

3.0,11/26/2015,"Just came from a disappointing Thanksgiving dinner from a once-venerated NYC icon.Upon entry into the lounge area I was impressed with the ambience -- it felt like the home of one's (imaginary) wealthy Upper East Side grandparents. All the patrons, including the kids, were beautifully turned out. When we were sat in the bar room with its checkered tablecloths and plastic toys hanging above, I was charmed.When tasting the crab cake which was made of gorgeous lump crab with very spare usage of binder, I was impressed. And that's where the upward momentum ended.In an uneven spiral in which the overall trend was downward, the rest of the meal failed to meet expectation. I ordered the classic turkey dinner which was accompanied by Brussels sprouts, sweet potato purée and chestnut dressing.The turkey was very dry and beyond assisting with gravy. The sprouts tasted like they had probably been good when first pulled off the stove a couple hours prior. The sweet potato purée was smooth and sweet and...that's it. Smooth and sweet. The dressing was quite tasty with its crunchy chestnuts but I have a nagging feeling that it seemed better than it actually was because the turkey was so absurdly sad.My spouse's pumpkin pie tasted like it had just been pulled from the local grocery store. My apple tart was a brighter spot, with its buttery flaky crust.Then the check came. With three cocktails, our dinner for two came to nearly $400. For me, that shoved the meal from the realm of acceptability into the land of disappointment, and quickly slanted my perception of the atmosphere from being one of quirky charm to self-important childishness.Last night we had dinner at another restaurant, where the check came dangerously close to $1000.

GREED IS GOOD!you'll notice in the in the reddish themed, dark wood room--which makes you feel like you're in fancy parlor or study. tons of different items hanging from the ceiling--toys, sports memorabilia, knickknacks etc. apparently the celebrity clientele here have donated these items that are carefully hung from the ceiling.the lunches in the Bar Room are prixe fixe or a la carte. if you have time and having a boozy lunch, do the prixe fixe. for the faint of heart--the lunch or anything here is pricey. you are not only paying for quality of food (which is fine. i would not say it's the best ever), but the service and ambiance make it pretty damn good and to me well worth the price for lunch splurging. also the prixe three course sans beverages is the best bang for your buck, imo. the starters of 21 salad or the crab tartare is pretty spot on. the lamb or salmon are solid entrees. the chocolate panna cotta during Mad Men week was dessert heaven. drinks are made with a heavy hand here. order classic cocktails: martinis, gimlets, etc. you will not be disappointed. the service is amazing. very attentive. great conversation. super friendly. and not creepy. white glove service all the way. with cleaning and refolding napkins and such as needed. the waiters, bussers, and other staff really pride themselves on providing that next level of service in terms of dining experience by really spending time to answer your q's about the menu, accommodating your requests, and making your experience at 21 seamless (no, not the delivery service!).the clientele in general is on the older side. much older siiiide. i have a feeling that many of the regular patrons here have been eating at 21 for the last 20-30-or 40 years. so outside of the entertainment of a fabulous meal, you get to see old folks get hammered.

We came right on time for our reservation but needed to wait about 15 minutes for our table to be ready....but we didn't mind because we were able to enjoy the bar/lounge area for a drink. Once our table was ready, we were seated in a dimly lit, romantic feeling room with toys adorning the ceiling. I thought it added a fun vibe to the otherwise serious place. For an appetizer I got the salmon and crab tartare, for my entree I got the leg of lamb, and for dessert I got the frozen yogurt parfait. All were amazing. The service was very attentive too, always refilling drinks and the courses came out in a timely manner. This is a great formal dinner spot that doesn't feel too stuffy. They do their best to make everyone feel like their most important customer. From the way the host pulls out the chairs for each person before everyone sits down, to the bathroom attendants, this is just a very high class place. I'll be back for special occasions to come. Note that there is a dress code- jacket required for men and similar caliber for women. I wore a cocktail dress and heels, while my boyfriend wore a suit.

It was so incredibly hot and the AC was barely on.  I will never go back. I was treated poorly yet spent $300.  They talked down to me because I looked young (I'm 34). Not worth it.

But inside decoration is nice! At least, I never imagined it before I came in personally. We got checked in super quickly and services were very friendly. Great service here I feel.To the center, the food. For restaurant week menu, I would recommend the appetizer - Crab and Salmon Tartare, tasting great. For main course, I got Roasted Leg Of Lamb , not bad. I ordered Ricotta Tart for dessert and it was so-so. I see online that the restaurant week menu is also offered on other days throughout the year but charge higher - Two Courses for $34 / Three Courses for $42 per person.

The staff was absolutely fantastic, i would give them five stars.I chose the prix fix for lunch with 2 items. the soup du jour (tomato bisque topped with Parmesan) which was very delicious. I ate every single drop. Next i had the Amish chicken which was with English peas, wild rice topped with a truffle jus. The chicken was moist and very good. The peas were minimal (which i was fine with as i don't like peas) and the truffle jus was less truffle and more au jus, again which i was fine with as i'm not a huge truffle fan. In my party we also had the crab cake, which i had a bite of and had huge lumps of crab. was again very good. She also ordered a salad, a bit boring but still looked good and plentiful.

4.0,4/22/2015,"I have been eating at the 21 Club regularly for about 25 years.  That's nothing to the 21 Club - they've been around since the days of prohibition.  I got to eat there before Michael Lomonaco took over the kitchen and have seen it transform again several times since then. We eat dinner there at least once a year, I try to do a couple of lunches with clients and do frequent post-work cocktails in the bar.  (The new bar is an up-tick).I used to like the degustation/prix fixe menu with wine pairing... they got rid of that a few years ago.  That's fine, though, saved me a couple hundred bucks that I was completely expecting to spend. (Though I have to wonder how many other guests would be willing to spend more too... maybe not the best business decision).Last weekend I turned up expecting to order the mixed ""game"" entree - that was something like a game (pheasant?) sausage, a venison chop, a piece of beef or buffalo or something like that.  That entree is missing from the menu.  As we were trying to decide what to eat we watched what our neighbors were served.  We were convinced that the two women next to us had either ordered appetizers for their main courses or were splitting and entree.  We split the duck and the lamb saddle; $48 & $58, respectively.  When the entrees showed up we realized that the women next to us were served full entrees - about 4 oz of salmon.  The duck was about 1/2 of a duck breast, maybe 5 oz total, the lamb two medallions that were about 5 oz each.  Each was served with ""vegetables"" - a thimble of pureed carrot, 2 spears of asparagus, a tiny piece of fennel.  The portions were laughable.All the food was excellent, despite the skimpy portions.  The wine list is massive and, unlike most fine dining restaurants that start in the $200 range and go up to the thousands, 21 offers a nice mix in lots of prices ranges.  The service was a little slow, but since we weren't in any sort of a hurry that didn't bother me.  Our neighbors, however, were rather displeased with the service.  They weren't served their wine until they were nearly done with their entrees - which wasn't hard to do given that most were about two-bites worth.  Overall, I'll still hit 21 as often as I can.  I like it best when I use ""monopoly money"" aka corporate money to pay; from the looks of the portions and prices, they kind of know that most people aren't using their own money.  Next time I go for dinner I'll just be sure to have a big, late lunch.",0,0,0,Johannes D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,24,0

3.0,3/14/2015,"I had heard good things about this place so I went there for dinner with a friend during Restaurant Week to check it out. While the food itself wasn't bad, the overall ambience was a bit off-putting. A few notes: -Food: The food and drinks were decent--nothing that will blow you away--but decent enough. I stuck with the Restaurant Week menu so perhaps I didn't get the full 21 Club experience, but I figured a specialized menu would showcase at least a few standouts; unfortunately nothing really stood out for me. -Atmosphere: The clientele looked surprisingly diverse. I thought it'd be predominantly musty old men but saw a mixed crowd. Unfortunately for us, we were seated next to some eyeroll-worthy guy who very much liked hearing the sound of his pseudo-European accent and enjoyed unnecessarily flipping his scarf throughout his dessert cheese platter. At one point, we heard this individual ask the waiter about the Restaurant Week crowd. The waiter, perhaps to humor the customer (who clearly fancied himself a regular), said something like, ""Yeah, they'll come, order from the Restaurant Week menu, and we won't see them again until the summer [when Restaurant Week returns],"" after which they both chuckled. Pretty obnoxious commentary from the waiter and a ""regular"" (who, by the way, was basically seated in the Solange section of the restaurant #justSaying). -Dress Code: I got scolded for taking my jacket off after we were already seated and had started eating. I understand having a dress code to get in and wanting to create a particular vibe among customers, but you don't need to get your panties in a twist just because a customer is getting overheated.-Bathroom Attendant: The men's bathroom has someone there to ""help"" you wash your hands, something that I've been doing myself for a few years now and which I had thought was limited to pretentious, overpriced clubs in the Meatpacking District.

Yeah, not happy.... but plus side is when we went back, my younger brother, who was visiting and didn't bring a jacket, wasn't turned away, instead they lent him a jacket to wear. The food was alright considering it was the restaurant week's menu. They didn't have a separate menu for restaurant week, instead it was marked with a figure on the side. The whole lay out was really cute and clever. It was just too bad, I couldn't get a picture because I had to walk so long outside, my phone's battery froze (yes, I need a new phone). So, it has been a couple of weeks since my visit, which is most of the case when I actually write my reviews because I want it to settle in before I actually do (any not do anything too rash or too in the heat of the moment, and if something really stands out, it will stay in memory).

For the first course I had the crab and salmon tartare. Small portion and FISHY - you could smell it on its way to the table. I forced a bite down before I threw in the towel - I didn't want to risk getting food poisoning. The Short Rib was terribly bland. It was way over cooked, very dry and again of a very small portion. For dessert I had the caramel banana sundae - the only highlight of the meal but really, anyone can make a sundae. The meal and waitstaff both left much to be desired. In summary, 21 Club offers small portions of poor food served by pretentious waiters in a dated atmosphere. I find myself wondering how the 21 Club remains in business but I guess that they capitalize on their reputation.WORST RESTAURANT I'VE BEEN TO IN A LONG TIME.

3.0,3/5/2015,"I have been here for lunch, dinner, and finally restaurant week. While the history, menu and décor are there, the food is just not 4 star worthy. The price is close to ridiculous for a non-Michelin restaurant. The crowd are generally older upper east side folks who never go outside of the neighborhood to try something better..Most recent experience: - Appetizers: Prawn and salmon tartar are both very good - Main course: braised short rib and chicken are good as well - Dessert: chocolate panna cotta WAS A JOKE, I could've bought it at CVSService is okay, it's not French or Japanese so you get the point.",4,1,1,Osman J.,"Manhattan, NY",171,258,601

4.0,3/2/2015,"This place's lighting was made for photographing food and then posting it on the Internet. The food itself, for the winter restaurant week, was as good as we anticipated (we'd been eyeing this place for quite some time). The selection was generous--you could have the 21 Club Caesar salad, a prawn, maine crab/salmon tartare (always my choice if its on the menu) or the soup of the day for appetizers, Amish chicken (which I got), salmon, lamb bolognese, or red wine braised short ribs for the entree, and a banana caramel sundae (awesome), chocolate panna cotta, tarte a l'orange, or mixed fruit/berries for the dessert. The appetizer was fresh--the salmon and crab worked well together, though I mostly tasted the salmon and did not seem to get much of the crab. The chicken for my entree was superb, and the sundae was heavenly. I had a great meal here. The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because our table felt claustrophobic (compared to the ones next to us, where two people could sit comfortably next to one another on the same side), and the waitstaff was a bit impatient; it was understandable because the place was crowded, and overall they still provided good service. My boyfriend even bonded with one of our waiters over being Greek. The decor on the ceiling was a bit unnerving--it's a distinct collection of random objects, including helmets and toy trucks, that are suspended over your head as you eat. I was a bit paranoid they might fall on me should there be an earthquake or something. But other than that, the place was swanky, the clientele seemed high-class, the general atmosphere felt aristocratic, etc. You cannot come here dressed in jeans and a t-shirt... In fact, it is a jacket-required place for men, and women would do well to dress up for the occasion as well. The bathrooms have attendants (at least, the women's room did), and the coat check was efficient and organized. I look forward to my next visit here.",2,1,0,CHRISTINE Z.,"New York, NY",73,289,35
3.0,2/27/2015,"I really like this place, but I must take one star off for the lady that called to confirm my reservation. The conservation went like this:""What time is your reservation?""""Oh, uh, let me check. Hold on.""- 2 seconds -The lady begins SHOUTING into the phone ""HELLO?!! HELLOOOOOO?!!!!""""yes, what?""""I AM NOT DONE TALKING!!!!!""I have then decided that I am not inclined to deal with this kind of treatment so I just hung up.The day of the meal:I came for restaurant week. I'd like to believe the food is different during their non-restaurant week times. We were not offered water or the wine menu when we sat down. Our appetizer came in 5 minutes and we were still not asked water -- we had to ask for water when we were done with our appetizers.The salmon tartare was weird..the lemon sauce was so overwhelming -- it was like eating one of those super sour candies. I got the short rib as entree and it's just tasteless overcooked pulled pork. I loved the mashed potatoes and carrots though. I got chocolate pana cotta as dessert and the sauce at the bottom of the dish was way too sweet. What is with this place and proper sauce pairing?!My boyfriend and I ordered wine -- which was great. I enjoyed the service from our waiter, and this is why I'm giving this place a 3 star. Our waiter was patient, and took time explaining the history and figurines when I asked.

4.0,2/26/2015,"I visited here for restaurant week as it had been on my list for a while. I really enjoyed the place, the atmosphere and the food. I really appreciated the good service I got here, the doorman, the host taking my coat & the nice lady in the bathroom. From entering the restaurant it felt welcoming, the staff are dressed well and the bar/lounge area was very cosy. Our table wasn't ready straight away so we had a seat at the bar & did some people watching. There was a bit of an older crowd & what looked like business people. When our table was ready the host addresses us by Mr & Mrs and carried out drinks to our table. Once we sat down we took in the decor which is a bit kitsch, which I loved! There were small airplanes and trucks hanging from the ceiling and red checked tablecloths. The food was very good, to start I had crab and salmon tartare and my husband had the head on maya prawn. Both were very tasty & full of flavor, we were very impressed. For our main meal I had the short ribs and my husband the Amish chicken. We ordered French fries to accompany them as we felt we needed some carbs, but afterwards wish we had got vegetables as we were missing them from our dishes. The chicken was a really large chicken breast, but the short ribs portion was on the small side, although it was excellent and again full of flavor, I just would have liked more! For desserts, I had the banana sundae and it was sooo good! It had so many elements to it & was great, I didn't want it to end. I think it was my favorite dish. My husband got the Tarte A L'orange and thought it was nice and thought the fruit that garnished it was nice too. All in all it was a great meal and I would return, however it was nice to have a deal with it being restaurant week.

1.0,2/26/2015,"I visited the 21 Club in the hopes of enjoying their restaurant week lunch menu with a guest. We arrived 5 minutes before our 1:30 PM reservation and were immediately addressed rudely by the restaurant's host. His eyes scanned us from head to toe and he quickly informed us that we couldn't be seated as our attire was against the restaurant's dress code (we were both wearing dress shoes, a jacket and dark jeans). This was our first time visiting the 21 Club and I told the host that we were never informed of a dress code. He haughtily threw a piece of paper at me which had a dress code typed in fine print, pulled from their website - it was obvious to me that he had done this many times before. I found it odd that he would so readily turn us away, especially considering the nature of restaurant week (is it not an opportunity for restaurants to attract new clientele?). After politely asking if we could perhaps be accommodated somewhere in the restaurant other than the dining room, he suggested we change our reservation to another day. I declined and enjoyed my lunch elsewhere. After going home I checked my credit card statement to find a charge of $50 on my card for a no show fee! Talk about adding insult to injury! Nowhere on the online booking site does it say that I would be charged for not showing up in attire deemed appropriate by the restaurant staff. Even if it did, this practice is immoral and discriminatory. At no point did I sign anything authorizing my card to be charged. I called the 21 Club and after speaking to the manager, he agreed and reversed the charge. While that may seem like a reasonable resolution to the issue I find the whole practice to be predatory - what if I hadn't checked my credit card statement? They would have gotten away with unjustly charging me $50 for no services rendered. They have a vested interest in turning away customers and not serving them food, since they charge their credit card anyway - there is something very wrong about this.

One big reason is I've been married for 11 years and when my father-in-law comes to visit for Christmas, he only wants to eat at steak houses. So, I have eaten at almost all of the NY institutions. As an aside, I worked as a hostess at Keen's when I moved to NYC and have some amazing memories, and the funny thing was I was a strict vegetarian at the time. I never ate their steak when I worked there.We did the Christmas prix fixe at 21 Club, and my father-in-law liked the atmosphere and the caroling, although they only sang to half the room and skipped us. I still remember my elk loin game medley was good, but everyone else was nonplussed by the experience. This was a few years ago, and it was a hefty price tag.I know their kitchen went through some rough patches there for a while. But that's what restaurant week is for.

Unfortunately it's not.  The host walks you into the back room where the tables are topped with red and white checkered table cloths , seats are inches away and there are random things (Hess trucks, helmets etc) hanging from the ceiling. Never the less, we chose not to judge.  We ordered two Caesar salads. Honestly I could have ordered a side salad from Mc Donald's  and it would have been presented better.  We then order a chicken hash and I order lump crab meat.  My crab meat - which I was pretty excited for - looked like cat food and had tons of shells in it. The chicken hash just looked like beef goulash. All in all I was not impressed.  For a 150$ dinner - I would rather have gone to Delfriscos.

4.0,8/19/2014,"Saw 21 Club on a plethora of top 10 restaurant week (RW) lists so chose it as one of my RW picks to go to this summer. I had no idea of the historical significance of the restaurant regarding every U.S. president since FDR (except GWB) had eaten here and that numerous films were also shot here (i.e. Wall Street) prior to choosing it.On the outside, the restaurant looks classy, upscale and there's a nice touch with the little jockey figurines on the top of the entrance. My friends and I had dinner inside the Bar Room, which was really dark inside. The dim lighting could be looked at as giving off a romantic ambiance, but at the same time you had to have the vision ability of a bat to see the menu!The restaurant was once a speakeasy so it was understandable that the décor was unique too. There were all sorts of toys hanging on the low ceiling (trucks, airplanes, footballs, helmets, etc) and little statuettes and paintings on the walls. The table clothes were a red/white plaid color, which added to the ""weirdness"" of the room. The room definitely had an ""old school""/1900s feel to it and is nothing like the modern, classy restaurants of today. A strict dress code is enforced here --- jackets are required for men (ties being optional now) and no jeans or sneakers allowed. The noise level throughout the night was moderate and not extremely loud. The Bar Room was not at capacity on the Tuesday night we visited, but it was almost full in our section of it.As for the RW menu, I was pleased to see that there were 4 of each course served. The RW menu was actually embedded within their regular menu with little jockey figures next to the RW items. Here's what I ordered:----- APPETIZER -----Beef Carpaccio - The thin slice of beef was not cooked all the way through, but was excellent and perfect for my palette! It was flavorful, almost like a giant, thin piece of pepperoni and was surrounded by some vinaigrette seasoned arugula and parmesan cheese.------ ENTRÉE -----Roasted Murray Chicken - Moist, juicy and tender. I loved the seasoning on the top of the chicken and it was roasted just right where it wasn't burnt, but I got that toasty flavor from the skin. The mashed potatoes were a good addition to the plate to fill up on.I also had a chance to try the Braised Baby Lamb Shank and I would have to say that would have been my #1 choice in retrospect. The Lamb was also extremely tender and the juices just spilled out with each bite. Also, the serving size was perfect and the Broccoli Rabe was really good! The only complaint I could have on it was the Couscous because I'm not a big fan of it.------ DESSERT -----Roasted Peach Tart - I also had a chance to try the Crème Brulee and Almond Chocolate Blondie Sundae and I highly recommend the Sundae out of all 3. The peach tart was caramelized on top but there was a little too much ginger flavor in it for me. The Crème Brulee was a classic brulee, so I didn't feel it was that special either. The Sundae was sweet, but there were so many delectable ingredients in there, including the blondies that we could dip in the sundae and little crunch balls.Overall, I liked the RW menu food, but not sure if I was fully in love. I found the décor to me very unique, although a bit odd. I didn't feel the Bar Room gave off the high-class environment feel, despite the fact that they have a dressy dress code. I did like that the RW menu had a 4-4-4 list and the wait staff was very professional. I would hate to give the restaurant a 3 because it was better than that, but it wasn't a 4 either, so I'll have to settle on 3.5 stars.",0,1,2,Chris E.,"Brooklyn, NY",530,1118,9624

5.0,8/13/2014,"I have wanted to eat here ever since I was a little girl growing up in hillbillyville, reading about the glamorous lives of stars (of literature and film) in the 30's - 50's, and this restaurant was frequently mentioned. I thought I was making my reservation for restaurant week, but wasn't really paying attention to what I was doing, and wound up making it for a Saturday evening, NOT restaurant week. HA. I'm going to be feeling the sting for a while, but it was worth it.We dressed appropriately: suit and tie for my husband, dressy dress for me.  We came early so we could have drinks beforehand. When our cab pulled up (my shoes were NOT made for walking), a restaurant employee opened the cab door for us and helped me out.  We were greeted by the maître d and shown to the bar.The bar is the standout here.  They had my favorite gin AND they buy the tonic water in glass bottles. If you really like gin and tonic, you know tonic from a soda gun is just sub par. It's always, always flat, so the fact that they spring for the little Canada Dry bottles (the tiny glass ones, none of that cheap plastic bottle crap here) was a huge selling point.  The pours are extremely generous.Of note: the bartender asked if we were dining and when we said yes, he put the drinks on our dinner tab.   We had assumed we'd tab out at the bar and use a card.  We had no cash and there was no way we weren't tipping the bartender, so my husband ran across the street to an ATM.  Just remember that: bring some cash to tip the bartender if you're eating here.When the maître d approached to let us know our table was ready, we asked for a few extra minutes which was graciously granted. The table, incidentally, was one I had requested specifically, and I got it.  Yes, it's where Dorothy Parker sat! I'm a rube!  They asked me, ""this is your favorite table?""  which made me sound like a regular and not a rube, which was appreciated.We got to the table and were greeted by I think a bus person or assistant. We were brought bread, water, etc.  The sommelier came by and when we told him our price range and what kind of wine we liked, he suggested a wine that seriously blew our socks off.  I saved the receipt so I could track the wine down locally.  It was every single thing we wanted, and about $40 less than our limit.We had the foie gras terrine, I had chicken, my husband had steak. The chicken was nice and juicy, the steak was delicious as well, cooked perfectly.  I had profiteroles, and my drunkard husband had a scotch for dessert.  They brought him some complimentary petit fours, which was nice. Everything was really good.The restaurant does close kind of early, 11 pm.  We were enjoying the desserts, running our mouths, and they had to tell us they were closing. Oops. Sorry, we were having too good a time to leave! Can we move in?We'll definitely be back.  If you're looking for a quiet, old school place to have drinks after work (and I do work in the area, so I do see this becoming a regular thing, yikes), this will do it. The music is Sinatra, etc., my favorite, and low enough you can enjoy the music while still hearing the people you're with. Great ambiance.If you're looking for a place to really splurge in a traditional way, this is it.  The ambiance, the service, it's all amazing. This is IT, the last of the great New York restaurants. The Stork is gone, El Morocco is gone, but 21 remains. And now I know why.",3,2,2,Jamie C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",24,165,4
5.0,8/12/2014,The wine cellar tour put this over the top for a 5 star review.   I came here with friends for the 2014 summer restaurant week and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  We were a little concerned that this club (which has served every president since Teddy Roosevelt) would be too pretentious and snobby for us to enjoy dining here.  But the service we received was wonderful from beginning to end.  (Perhaps it helped that we checked ahead on the 'business casual' women's dress code.)  The salmon and crab tartare appetizer was the highlight of my three course meal.  The vegetables served with the salmon main dish were flavorful and crisp.  And my friends very much enjoyed their lamb shank.  All of the dishes we tried were well prepared and we left full and happy.  Touring the wine cellar at the end of our meal was an unexpected highlight.  There is some fabulous history hidden behind a secret passageway that leads to the 21 Club's wine cellar.  Not to mention some fabulous bottles of wine.,4,0,1,Jen S.,"Melbourne, Australia",171,175,4987

As soon as you walks in the whole place screams history and old fashion. If you've ever watched Charley Sheen and Michael Douglas in ""Wall Street"" the movie, it takes place here! Before we were seated, we were quickly stopped because my coworker did not have a jacket and was also wearing jeans! *Facepalm! We were seated in the lounge instead of the main dining room, which was equally cute and old timey. The main dining room had all kinds of old trinkets hanging from the ceiling, it's definitely one of a kind. The bathroom is also beautiful! The waiters are cute old people who were dressed up and super nice, loved it! The restaurant week menu was off of the regular menu, which is a huge plus as many nyc restaurant tends to put junk on the restaurant week menu. I had the beef capaccio, which was fresh and delicious! My coworker's grilled squid was also amazing!For main I had baby lamb shank, it was flavorful, tender and falling off the bone! The dessert was so so, but the appetizer and main more than made up for it. Overall the food was an amazing deal for restaurant week.

The plating was particularly pleasing.Dessert - Peach tart and a fresh fruit plate.The fruit plate came with a white wine sorbet that was the highlight of the evening.

3.0,3/26/2014,"We were running with the classic new york theme for a friend's roaring 20's (30th) birthday last weekend. With it's brilliant history as a prohibition era speakeasy, 21 club was a perfect for our night out.We committed numerous faux pas that evening:- The birthday girl wanted balloons. When you're the birthday girl, you get what you want. Especially at 30. I brought them along and got the feeling they were perhaps a bit obnoxious, even in the downstairs room clad with checkered tables and antique toys hanging from the ceiling. - I didn't know any of my my party mates (with the exception of the bday girl and her beau) but we were largely well behaved, even if we were a few decibels louder than the average table (oops). We ended up doing a round of shots. Yes, shots -- at 21 club. Our waiter politely obliged but I felt that really wasn't the time and place. - In line with the 20's themed party we had fake cigarettes. The birthday girl even had an Audrey Hepburn-esque cigarette holder that she was casually holding for photos. The look of polite horror on the waitstaff's face when we brought them out was a bit humorous. They were covertly trying to figure out what the heck we were doing and if they should put a stop to our shenanigans.Now, on to the food.Wanting to get a taste of vareity and leave with a full stomach, I opted for the 3 course prix-fix. I started with the crab cake which was pretty amazing and was richer than an oil rig owner. Seriously creamy and good. Only one came out on the plate but I could of devoured plenty more. The salmon main came out way undercooked but our waiter politely corrected this error. When it returned it was light, and full of baby new potatoes, not bad.The birthday girl brought her own cake and they charged some crazy amount to cut it and serve it.The Sorbet and fruit dessert was last dish down. Delicate and creamy and a light conclusion to my meal.My dirty martini came in at a grand total of $19. Ouch.I'm left confused. White glove service in a room of knick-nacks and checkered table cloths? While I liked it here, the value was negligible.

5.0,3/8/2014,"Wine, wine, and more wine!  Oh, the wine!  We came to 21 Club to check out the scene and check out this crazy wine list.  Firstly, the scene: Men, you must wear a jacket.  Don't be fooled by the toy trucks and football helmets hanging from the ceiling - this is no Applebee's in suburbia but rather a classy ""New York institution"" where rich business folks and celebs settle in for a $20+ cocktail (or two, or three) after work.  Make sure you dress the part - you won't be overdressed in your chic dress and heels.  I love that you'll see all kinds of folks here.... The romantic couple sharing an expensive bottle of wine, a group of girls out for a classy girls night, and the gobs and gobs of well-dressed super rich men at the bar, with gaggles of young pretty girls hanging over their elbows.  It's a sight to be seen for sure. As for me and my hubby, we came here for the WINE LIST, which is Ah-mazing!  Both of us had perused the wine list in advance.  You can download the ""Wine Spectator Grand Award"" winning wine list, all 84 pages of its glory), on their website or right here: 4c6c364fdf1082a37bcf-544…The wine list is divided by regions and the wine list has been so carefully put together to show you the maps of the regions and even the appellations and the vineyards themselves.  It's fun just to look at the wine list and all the maps. If you thumb through the wine list, you'll quickly notice that many of the bottles are sold for minimum $200-500, and upwards of several thousand dollars!  This is not wine for the novice!  Fortunately, there is a sommelier who is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful; bonus - he won't turn his nose up if you tell him your price range.  However, get ready to speak wine the right way - you can tell the sommelier ""Yes, I'd like a red wine from the Burgundy region of France, vintage 2005-2010, fruity, preferably with some green apple tastes, but dry and well-balanced.""  He will provide you options in your price range, and you won't be disappointed.

They have a doorman greeting you at the entrance. Service was not bad except with all the staring. However, food came out extremely slow. Must've waited at least 20 mins between appetizers and entree.  What started as an early dinner took 3 hours to finish.  Most importantly, if you came here for food, you should turn back around. The food was definitely not even average.  I started with the tuna tartare, which was okay but not enough flavor. I had the salmon as my entree. I've had well cooked salmon before but this literally was hurting my teeth and jaw as I try to finish the dish. It definitely did not taste fresh. One last hope with the dessert...chocolate ganache cake. What a big disappointment!!! Tasted premade and was just sitting around.  The rasperberry smear at the bottom of the plate was extremely hard like they made it the day prior. As I get home, I'm feeling naseaus. Possibly the wind and freezing cold to blame?!?  No!!! Woke up in middle of night and all the food came coming out of my stomach and mouth.  Keep in mind that I don't even drink alcohol.

3.0,2/25/2014,"Between ""a fan"" and ""a-ok"", I regretfully must pick an ""a-ok"" rating. I went there yesternight for restaurant week, and like most yelpers, I received a fluctuating service. The hosts, white jacket waiter, coat check lady, and doorman were superb, smiling and very polite. However, the rest of the servers were subpar. They weren't terrible but lack professionalism. I have been to numerous high end restaurants, and no matter how we are dressed the servers professionalism does not, and should not, change.Whether the servers we got were just having a bad day, or they were stereotyping us as ""cheap tippers"" or ""low class"" individuals, their reactions for a high end restaurant is unacceptable. I am fair, because if they were only a, let's say 2 star restaurant, I'll rate them as that. However, when you regularly, restaurant week aside, charge customers $34 for tuna tartare, I expect a certain service.First, they NEVER removed the bread or the dishes and instruments affiliated with eating the bread. This substantially decreased our table space causing unnecessary noise every time the server tried to put the food onto our table.Second, after I ordered the restaurant week dishes, I wanted to order more off the regular menu. The server in the black jacket just stretched out his hand and wanted to take my menu. I looked at him for a second to see if he'll withdraw his outstretched hand. ( I wanted to give him a chance to amend his reaction, he did not). I handed him the menu. Third, as a high end restaurant you NEVER say ""you done?"" You always politely ask, ""are you done, sir/madam"" before stretching out a hand to take the dish. There are other minor complaints, but I think I've made my point. These servers were snobby, and not classy. Classy is to present someone the professional and/or knowledgeable front the customer lacks. In a classy setting, the customer might feel inadequate because they are not accustomed to restaurant etiquette, and the server will gently nudge the customer in the right direction. It is NOT, the server BEING inadequate. (Please see my comments above).  If the server lacks that professional front, they are no longer classy. They are merely snobby, and I will not stand for that. I would have given this place two stars, if not for the other great servers and exceptional designs. The ceiling was just so amazing, filled with toys and football helmets. Coupled with classic wood furniture and small iron statutes, it was a sight to be seen. The food, is just okay. They certainly need a switch up the chefs. I have had better tuna tartare, fresher crab cakes, and ice cream that wasn't half melted when it was served. *Shakes my head* I was looking forward to this place too.

2.0,1/19/2014,"My friend's 31st birthday is a reason for celebration, and 7 of us anxiously waited for Saturday night. I knew that the venue was pricey, and therefore did not eat much before, knowing that I would get an unbelievable meal. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I decided to eat vegan that night, which left me with only one option: the vegetable tasting. That is all I ate. The portabella mushroom/ tofu tower had absolutely no taste. I cook my own mushrooms and they taste way better! The tasting came with quinoa stuffed peppers, which tasted strange and too nutty, and a winter squash ratatouille. The food was cold and a big disappointment. I drank a non alcoholic cocktail - which had grapefruit, lemon, maybe lime and some other juices. It was sweet and tasted good. Ok, so I get it: this is not a vegan restaurant. My friend, who sat next to me, was served a cold lobster bisque for an appetizer, and the game sampler for the main course. He confessed that the assortment of venison, elk, and other meats was not very tasty.

It did not disappoint, that's for sure.  We sat upstairs, and from the time we got there the service was great. Our waiter was extremely attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and wine list. I ended up starting with the octopus appetizer and it was delicious. Great seasoning on it and good way to start the meal. My wife had the caesar salad, and it also was very tasty. For our entrees, my wife had the scallops (delicious) and I had the Steak Tartare. Now, this isn't the appetizer type steak tartare that every restaurant has these days - this is the traditional french style steak tartare entree that very few restaurants these days serve, much less do a good job of preparing. I haven't had Steak Tartare this good in 13 years, quite possibly ever. Absolutely delicious. For dessert, my wife had the Nutella sorbet and I had the Creme Brulee. Creme Brulee was very good.

I have been to pretty much all of the city's old-school, upscale steak houses over the past 15 years... I've noticed a trend where these restaurants are relying much more on service and reputation and much less on the actual food they are serving.  21 Club is no exception.  The service is top-notch (though kind of weird, the waiter asked us if he could bring us a drink before giving us the drink menu... and then acted kind of put off when we asked for the menu...).  But the service is attentive.  Decor is interesting - especially in the tap room where the ceiling is adorned with old planes and toy trucks.  The more formal dining space is like any other old-school, nice restaurant.  Bread basked was nothing to write home about - not warm and not totally fresh but whatev...  Starter salads were very good.  For dinner I got the scallops which were delicious.  Mom got the sea trout ... not to be confused with fresh water trout.  i didn't realize this but sea trout is essentially salmon - in appearance as well as taste... not at all like fresh water trout.  her dish was served with an olive quinoa, which i thought i'd like much more than I did.  BF got the assorted game dish.  Personally, I don't love game-y dishes but I do enjoy venison.  He was kind of disappointed - the venison was extremely tough and chewy on the outside and extremely rare on the inside... All of the meat was VERY rare... cool to the touch, gel-like consistency.  I know many chefs prefer to cook their meats rare but it wasn't appealing.  With so many other places to get a fabulous steak, I don't think I'll be back.",1,0,0,Krista C.,"London, United Kingdom",6,70,0

The place is an old world charm, very interesting decor, you can see the other diners, mostly tourist, all giggly when they first arrived. However, that charm does not translate to the food to say the least. The food was non-imaginative, I ordered the tomato gazpacho, and it was grainy, as if the tomatoes and whatever other vegetables had not been washed properly, followed by a non-seasoned breast of chicken, which my 5-year old nephew could had cooked better, it was dried, no sauce to be found.",5,0,1,Ingrid R.,"Los Angeles, CA",130,29,249

At the descent we instantly time traveled to the1920s prohibition era. The atmosphere was dark, sophisticated, and mysterious. We looked up and saw various toys and sport goods hanging from the ceiling. These contrasting ornaments set club 21 apart from other expensive NYC restaurants.We heard many good things prior to the dinner and that may have inflated our expectations. The dinner began with sparkling water (Pelligrino $28 for 3) and we ordered a bottle of white wine (2013 Verdicchio - $28) to start. We were not expected to pay for the bubbly water. Sadly water was not covered. The white wine was on the restaurant week menu, it was alright for what we paid for. We had 2 attentive waiters for the night, a wine expert and a person who took care of our food. The wine expert explained to us the popular choice of wines and their distinct features. However, the wines he recommended were not meant for us rookies.

The Ratatouille soup was cold, which I did not expect. It tasted like raw vegetables blended together. The best part of my appetizer was the one single piece of eggplant that was placed in the middle of the plate. The summer salad was extremely sour and uncreative. It was a combination of lettuce (a ton) and a few small cantaloupe pieces. The entrees were modest but unsatisfying. Both the Grilled Pork Tenderloin and Organic Chicken Breast were dry and unmemorable. The only redeeming quality was the buttery mashed potatoes, which tasted exquisite. The Grilled Salmon with miso was plain. My favorite part of the meal was the desserts. They were all delicious. The balance of crust to fillings of the Strawberry Rhubarb Tart was perfect. It was sweet and tangy yet not overpowering. Vanilla Bean Crème Brûlée came in sufficient serving. It was rich and creamy beneath the hard sugary coating. Last but not least, Devil's Chocolate Pearl was one intense dish, though it would be the perfect choice for the chocolate enthusiast. We got mini chocolate macarons and white chocolate truffles on the house, which was a pleasant surprise. Overall, 21 Club has an incredible list of wines and intricate desserts. The food was lacking but only due to the fact that the restaurant week menu was restrictive to a limited selection. Our bill came out to be $58 per person + tips and tax.

4.0,8/2/2013,"Came here for restaurant week with a couple of friends, and ordered straight from that menu. The interiors are really cool when you first enter, with that feeling of having stepped into a chapter meeting of a secret society. Everyone is dressed to the nines, with jackets and ties everywhere. I'm personally not a huge fan of the jacket requirement, but I do love the formal attire. The clientele is either well-off, young people or some more established older folks. Definitely a few lookers here and there.Having said that, the actual dining area inside was a bit unexpected. First of all, the ceilings were extremely low, making this place feel super small. It didn't help that the area wasn't too large in the first place, making it feel extra cramped. Second, there were a bunch of random helmets and objects hanging from the ceiling, which erased some of that classiness you first felt. The food itself was alright, but I honestly expected more for something of this caliber. My grilled shrimp appetizer was probably my favorite out of the 3-course meal, with the miso-glazed salmon and vanilla bean crème brûlée not too far behind. Don't get me wrong, everything tasted fine, but nothing really blew me away.What bumps this place up to four-stars, however, are their complementary macaroons and white chocolate pieces and their parking deal. They have a parking agreement with the nearby Central Parking Garage (31 west, 52nd st), where you can park for 6 hours at the mere price of $10. This is an absolute steal when it comes to parking, and alone makes up for the price of the food.Just be wary though, because only the 31 west, 52nd st location has a deal with the restaurant.

5.0,6/4/2013,"How can you rate 21 anything less than a 5? It's an American institution, one which each of us should experience at least once regardless of where we live, how much money we make, or what we normally eat.In his continuing quest to educate me in the area of upscale culinary delights, my father brought me here when I was 15. Although I was still too young to fully understand and appreciate 21's greatness and class overload, I still knew even then that I was experiencing something special. Subsequent visits have only served to reinforce this original, less sophisticated opinion.21 consists of two dining areas: the bar room, which is the main space that you've seen in dozens of movies and tv shows, and the upstairs room, which offers a much more romantic atmosphere (and charges more as a result). Both are fantastic, and I fully recommend that you all try them as soon as possible.Some nights, 21 offers a pre-theater prix fixe menu (I believe it's Tuesday through Friday- not positive though), but outside of that you'll be ordering à la carte. The pork belly, tuna tartare, and mesclun salad are all fantastic- or, if you'd like to really splurge, you can't go wrong with any of the three caviars 21 always offers (they change from week to week). And although a caesar salad probably doesn't seem all that flashy and interesting to you, the ""21 caesar"" is really great.As for the main course, the salmon and 21 burger are both delicious (don't knock the burger until you've tried it), and all the steaks are amazing too (as they should be for $52+). The asparagus and onion rings are crazy good- I wish I could have an order shipped to me right now. And although I can't speak to what's currently on the list, 21's cheese service is always a favorite. The last time I was there I had some roquefort that was to die for.Desserts are classic American (specifically NYC) fare done to perfection: cheesecake, crème brûlée, apple crumb pie, etc., but also look for more unique options that are added day to day. No matter which way you go, you'll be happy with your choice.The wine list is far too long to explain with any shred of adequacy here, so I'll leave it at this: not only are some of the best bottles in the city found at 21, but the best sommeliers to go along with them. Sit back, order 2 or 3 bottles for the table, and enjoy yourselves.21 is a restaurant that will never go out of style, as all truly classic institutions in life never do. It's a wonderful way to spend an evening in NYC, and an even better way to try American cuisine prepared with an exceptional level of flare, inventiveness, and love.

I shall enlighten you a bit then! Back in the 1930s, the 21 club was a very popular speakeasy spot for horse breeders to talk and brag and share a brandy. Being quite the spot, the breeders began giving the club these little colorful jockeys to represent their private farms. These jockeys were often replaced by winners and now they each represent some of the most successful stables and race horses. Interesting eh? Anyhow, so this speakeasy turned restaurant is as packed with history and memorabilia as it is packed with rich folk. Does the place radiate money? Yes... but are they snobby? I didn't think so. I actually found everyone to be very friendly! BUT keep in mind their ""no jeans"" policy... they take it seriously and you will feel seriously under dressed if you decide to ignore it. Girls are in cocktail dresses and guys are in suits. Doesn't matter the time or day of the week... so keep your attire in mind. Oh and the food... my GOSH the food... everything was FANTASTIC. A great selection of wine...the scallops were fresh and sweet, the steak was melt-in-your-mouth tender and their wine selection was fantastic! They chocolate souffle was outstanding and if you have a chance... try the peanut butter and jelly ice cream... YUP! I SAID IT!

4.0,4/9/2013,"4/5 stars for me. It is not often that I find myself at fancy restaurants. Once in a blue moon for a special occasions I guess. I found myself making reservations here through work and was very excited. Jackets were required to sit in the dining room. For those that are going here or even stopping by for a drink at the bar, do yourself a favor and ask questions about the place or read up on it. There is so much history to the 21 Club. I did some reading beforehand and when we arrived we sat at the bar for a drink before our reservation for dinner. I asked the manager if it would be possible to see the wine cellar. He arranged for us to take a walk down, through the kitchen, to the cellar. A gentleman explained to us the history of the wine cellar through the prohibition era. It was well worth it. I could write more about it but I hate painstakingly long reviews. Some of the specials were really appealing but I went with a classic dish, the Chicken Hash. I was glad I did. Everyone at the table had one of their classics and everyone was pleased. I will mention that the service throughout the entire night was impeccable. The place has that old New York feel to it, when going to dinner was an event and not just a modern, casual night out. People dressed up, impeccable service, great food, doorman shakes your hand on the way out and asks if he can help you get a cab. I was very impressed with this place and will be back.

2.0,2/6/2013,"What a disappointing experience.   It started off with some bad service.   We got to our reservation 1 hour early because our show finished early.   We asked if we could be seated earlier by chance.   We understood if they couldn't because we showed up earlier.   But the maitre d' said just a few minutes.   We sat at the bar and grabbed a drink, patiently waiting for them to seat us.   We asked 2-3 times how much longer...""a few more minutes"" they said...1 hour later, we got seated- at our original reservation time!   That's fine, but just tell us that you can't seat us any earlier since we were the ones that showed up early.  Bah.  Anyways, we were really looking forward to our meal.  This place has been around for awhile and had a bit of a reputation, so we expected a great meal.   We went for the restaurant week menu.  My husband had the salmon tartar and I had the salad.   The tartar was average but my husband has had better.  My goat cheese with greens was ok...there was too much salt in the dressing and it was pretty boring tasting.  We were hoping for more in the entree.  My husband got the shrimp, cod, and scallops...once again average.  We have had better.   I got the chicken with mashed potatoes.  Pretty average as well and nothing special about it.   We were getting pretty discouraged about the food by the time desert rolled around.   We secretly hoped that this is where this place shined...nope, it wasn't.  My husband got a coffee brownie desert and I got the creme brulee.  I was pretty embarrassed that they served the coffee brownie the way they did.  It was in a sundae cup with a bunch of chocolate syrup poured in the bottom, a chuck of brownie thrown in, some store-bought coffee ice cream plopped on top.   Topped off with canned whipped cream.  It was gross.   My creme brulee was ok.  It was less than average and served cold.  I couldn't have more than a few bites. To finish off our negative experience, it took forever for the waiter to get our bill.  He was just standing there, and kept looking at our table but not getting the clue that we were done.  Shoddy service.    We were pretty relieved we experienced this place during restaurant week and didn't have to pay normal prices (~$30-40 per dish) for worse than average food.  We've lived in NYC for about 5 years now and this meal is close to the bottom of our restaurant experiences.  So disappointing.

My friend chose the 21 Club as the starting point of his BNO*.  This is definitely a place where the masters of the universe congregate.  Jackets are required for gentlemen and the place feels like stuffy old money (the sommelier tastes the wine before you to confirm if it is acceptable) .  We dined in the bar room with football helmets, trucks, and model airplanes hanging from the ceiling (it reminded me of old school Keen's with the pipes on the ceiling).  We went with the following:- Royal Sterling Caviar: they only had 1oz left and it was $125/oz (""opulence, I has it"").  This was the birthday boy's call and there's no objecting on BNO.  Splitting 1oz between 3 guys was like Jesus feeding 5,000 people with 5 fish/5 loaves of bread.  We all silently studied each other's scoops of caviar because spilling one grain would be the ultimate party foul.  It was good, but it wasn't $125/oz good.  It's pretty hard to evaluate while dividing an ounce three ways.- Oysters (Blue Points, Malpeque, Saint Simon, Watch Hill, Kusshi, Cherrystones, & Littlenecks): the oysters were OK and seemed a little on the small side (I'm spoiled by Aquagrill).- Halibut with Lobster Mash Potatoes Special: the fish was cooked well and was very good, but was on the small side and the lobster was almost non-existent in the mash potatoes.  The sides that we got were individually sized, but at least the fries were good.____________* BNO = Boys Night Out (we have a tradition where the birthday boy picks where he wants to eat, pray, love and the rest of us have to subsidize his requests).",5,6,1,Hector M.,"Jersey City, NJ",537,513,2227

It's stuffy and old-school; the waiters scurry about in their white jackets as titans of industry and the women who love them plan their next takeover. Sports memorabilia and model planes, trains and automobiles dangle from the low ceiling. I sat down ready to make some deals and eat some meat.Things started out promising - a plate of oysters were fresh, briny, and well-accompanied. But then, I ordered from the restaurant week menu. Mistake. I know that a RW menu is not going to be the top-notch offering at a restaurant (I mean, its $24, that is not a lot to work with), but it should at least be a good-faith effort. The ""summer salad"" was a modified verison of the one on the menu - reduced to a bag of spring mix and some radishes. The heirloom tomatoes with creamy parmesan sauce? A few slices of grainy tomato with some lettuce, a few droopy anchovies and (sad, sad, sad) no creamy parmesan to be found. Steak was fine, but ""bordeaux spinach"" and potatoes were salty, bland, and disappointing. Dessert was really no better than Hot & Crusty.RW is a great way to get people into your restaurant, but don't you want them to come back and order the real thing?

5.0,6/25/2012,"As a dyed-in-the-wool New Yorker, I generally try to avoid touristy establishments.  However, there are a few instances where the establishment draws a tourist crowd, yet it is still worthy of attention.  An interesting atmosphere, consistently good menu or even a long standing reputation can tip the scales in favor of one of these places.One week ago, I found myself perusing locales for a celebratory dinner and had a hard time sorting through the high quality restaurants that are in abundance in New York.  Aside from having an interesting menu, my number one criteria was that the restaurant had to be memorable.  I wanted a place that was distinctively New York.  Even more specifically, old school New York, of which very few places still remain.  This line of thought led me to the 21 Club.In the Hitchcock film Rear Window, Grace Kelly brings Jimmy Stewart take-out from the 21 Club, which watching it as a child burned the name into my consciousness and created an allure that has remained with me to this day.  So it was definitely the 21 Club for that special evening.It had been at least two decades since the last time I had dined at the 21 Club, so I wasn't sure if it would hold up to my memories.  We were seated in the downstairs dining room, a room where the ceiling is decorated with hanging sports helmets, model trucks and airplanes, adding a bit of whimsy to what is a rather formal atmosphere.I began my meal with a chopped salad consisting of savoy cabbage, romaine, bell peppers, snow peas, zucchini, garbanzos with a white balsamic dressing.  My partner began with an appetizer of lump crab served on radicchio, with grape tomatoes, celery and lettuce.  Both appetizers were light and refreshing, setting the palate for the main course to come.As a first time guest at 21, my partner had to try the 21 Burger, served with melted cheddar cheese, tomato, frisée, haricots verts and carmelized onions.  Skeptical that the burger could live up to its $32 price tag, he dug into his meal and proclaimed that it was most likely the best burger he had ever had and it was cooked to perfection.  He especially liked the bourbon ketchup sauce that they served as part of the condiments.  I would have to agree about the bourbon ketchup as I managed to swipe several fries and dipped them in the sauce.  Super tasty!For my main course, I had the Vegetable Tasting, consisting of a portobello mushroom tower with a light cream sauce, stuffed red peppers and a vegetable quinoa.  The dish was delicious, scoring extra points for creativity.  I was also impressed with the vegetable quinoa, considering that most restaurants when offering a vegetarian item on the menu completely overlook the fact that some type of protein is needed in the meal.We ended the meal with a Chocolate Griottine Torte that was divine! Regrettably, I was so taken with the smooth and decadent chocolate torte with brandied cherries and sour cream ice cream, that I completely forgot to take a picture until the plate was cleaned.  Despite having no photo, it is definitely etched into my memory.The 21 Club lived up to its image and was the perfect place to create memories for our celebratory occasion.  As fewer and fewer of the old New York establishments remain, it is somehow comforting that the 21 Club is still there, still quality and still able to transport you back to a New York rich with history.For Photos with the review go to:ladieswholunchtravel.blo…",4,1,1,Mdivani M.,"Manhattan, NY",10,33,0
3.0,6/4/2012,"Top notch service. Interesting atmosphere. There is sort of an old-school / boy's-club / professional environment with a ton of history feel to it. Something you might find at a steakhouse or something. The decor is hard to ignore - from floor to ceiling. There is a lot of ""stuff"" to soak in when you walk in the dining area.My party of 3 enjoyed the pre-theatre pre-fixe dinner menu. We had the asparagus, salad, salmon, and creme brulee. The starters were good. The white asparagus might have been the most interesting dish. The salad was light and tasty. The salmon I thought was too close to medium for me - I would have prepared more medium rare. It wasn't really memorable - not extraordinarily tasty or fresh. The creme brulee was a little too creamy for my liking. Even though it was a pre-fixe menu and considered very affordable for midtown NY standards, I thought it was a little overpriced for what it was. It didn't wow me.I was more impressed with the atmosphere, service, and decor than I was with the food. I would say the food was more 3-stars and everything else was 4-stars.",1,0,1,Elaine C.,"Seattle, WA",197,190,10

My lamb was possibly the best lamb I've ever had - I traded samples for the 28 day dry aged sirloin and filet mignon and thought my lamb was better ;) Perfectly seasoned and juicy. Started with the deviled egg (note singular noun) with lobster - pretty tasty but not really worth $19. The cheese plate was quite excellent with the dried fruit and jams; desserts were good but not outstanding.

4.0,5/28/2012,"This is one cool place. It is definitely only for special occasions, unless you have a lot of cash to spend. Although the place is quite fancy and special, the decor is very casual but in a great way. The tables are covered with picnic-like red and white checkered table cloths and from the ceiling hangs toys and other trinkets (like real signed helmets!) that they've gathered from their famous and important guests over the years (picture included). My boyfriend and I had made reservations for the upstairs room since I wasn't a fan of the decor from the website. They called a few days before to ask if we minded being seated in the bar room and offered us a free bottle of champagne for the inconvenience. I'm so glad that we got to experience the bar room and they gave us one of the nicest champagne bottles on the menu - not necessary at all! Especially since we are 25 and clearly not as picky as the other patrons. (E.g., the table next to us was filled with middle aged men in matching suits having a debate about which black card is best.) Although I didn't love my entre (the seafood platter), the food overall was great! I highly recommend the game tasting platter, which my boyfriend got. My boyfriend also loved the place so much that he asked to see their private dining room in case he wanted to throw an event there. Although I didn't love the private dining room, it was SUPER cool to see. It was the place that served as their speakeasy during prohibition. They've preserved the mayor's table from then while updating the rest of the room.

We were welcomed and seated at the bar where we  were instantly introduced to some of the regulars, the first being Gill,  he was a charming gentleman with an twinkle of mischief in his eye, my kinda man.  Then we asked about the history of this establishment and quickly realized this was an amazing place with a rich new york stories vibe,  that is adapting to the nowaday trends while keeping the spirit alive.  The place is filled with traditions, take a tour of the main room and you can see the great trickets left behind as momentos.  On my first tour Eddie showed me the model planes  left by the likes of  Howard Hughes, Clinton and other memorablilia from JFK and even some published books by Said Gill. Ok I'll admit that after a few cocktails the tour may require a repeat visit to remember details...especially Eddie's all in cocktails....lord can he pour, god bless him!  But the bottom line is that I like places where you can hear stories both past and present, about why everyone likes hanging out there.  The place looks like it might be a private, members only place but as they say ""while they do have a dress code anyone is welcomed"" and they take this theme to the next level and make you feel both welcomed and happy.  Do yourself a favor and plan a vist and you too will fall to the charm of the 21 Club,See you there on my futur visites to NY.....p.s.  I had the chance to meet a lot of the people working there, everyone from the hostess, the maitre d, waiters, managers, ladies room attendant, and doorman and each and everyone was charming and authentically friendly and loving what they do, real pros all around.",1,0,1,Valerie G.,"Montreal, Canada",172,284,88

4.0,2/6/2012,"The 21 Club is a New York institution. With all the modern day speakeasy crazes that are going on around the city, to which I won't deny attending a few, this place is one of the originals dating back to the Prohibition era that still retains its class to this day.I've eaten here on two occasions. The first was was with my girlfriend on December 31, 2009. We dined upstairs and it was quite elegant. The menu was an extremely reasonable $70-something per person, which was a great deal for NYE in NYC and at the 21 Club. The host of upstairs and his staff were extremely attentive and accommodating. When my gf was cold, he got her a shawl and when he saw me looking around the room, he came over and asked what my I was trying to figure out, which was the seating capacity of the room. He even escorted my girlfriend to that bathroom at one point.The food itself was quite delicious as well. Since the dinner was a while ago, I can't remember our appetizers at all. I have a picture of my gf's main course, but can't remember what it was, other than a seafood dish. For my main course, I had the Mixed Grill of Game, prepared rare. This dish was an antelope chop, Millbrook venison loin, homemade rabbit sausage, bacon-wrapped Mangalitsa pork loin, carrot purée, ginger chutney, huckleberry sauce. Yum, yum and yum. For dessert, I had the Pain Perdu, which was also delicious. Can't remember my gf's dessert at this point... I know it's not helpful for the review, sorry.All in all tho, the food was very well prepared and served. High marks for presentation and taste.The second time I was here was for Restaurant Week, Summer 2011. I brought some of my friends along and there were eight of us in all. Upon arriving, we sat in the lounge first, as we waited for #8 to arrive. Service in the bar is very professional and respectful, tho don't be surprised by the cost of drinks. One of my friends who can't have alcohol drank a Cranberry & Seltzer for around $6 or $7. I had a Remy Sidecar which ran $18.After friend #8 arrived, we were escorted to our table. As it was Restaurant Week, we ate in the Bar Room, which is a completely different atmosphere than upstairs. Since the reservation was in my name, I walked to the matire'd and asked to be seated. Before showing us in, he insisted on taking my drink from me and bringing it to the table for me. Nice touch. After being seated, the wait staff was equally as friendly, polite and professional. We were all addressed as Mister, Sir, or Gentleman.Anyways, on to the food, which I'm sorry to say wasn't as good as when I dined upstairs. For my appetizer, I had the Grilled Calamari, which came with a fava bean purée, marinated cherry tomatoes, lemon and oba leaf roasted bell pepper emulsion. I had expected the calamari to be fried as usual, but they were not fried at all... of course, since the menu did say grilled. The calamari were a pleasant surprise and not bad at all. For my main course, I had the Seafood Pasta, which was decent... nothing special. The seafood wasn't chewy or dry, but the dish overall lacked a good flavor. It also wasn't presented very neatly and looked thrown together. Between the whole table, we ordered everything on the menu and everyone else really seemed to enjoy their food.For dessert, I had the Peach and Apricot Streusel Tart with sour cream ice cream. The peaches used in this dessert were donut peaches. The dessert sounded very promising, but was a bit of a letdown. The ice cream, peaches and top of the streusel were quite good, but the sides and bottom of the streusel were sort of rock hard. Would I come back here? Probably. I'd like to try their burger at some point, tho I have made the recipe at home (yes, I got the proper amounts of kinds of meat, including short ribs). Before trying to make the 21 Burger at home, I was doing a little online research and noted that someone who ate the 21 Burger made in-house said it tasted a bit like meatloaf. Having made the burger at home, I can second that.This place is a cool to check out during Restaurant Week. The staff is very friendly and professional and you can tell a lot of the waiters have been there for a long time. The Bar Room has a very cool atmosphere with all its decorations, but is quite loud as well.For a much better experience at 21, eat upstairs for a special occasion.

4.0,2/4/2012,"RW menu. 5:30 reservation on a friday. pretty quiet- no background music for ambiance. Service was great, besides the first waiter that never presented us with a menu (i think he was annoyed that I didnt know what i wanted to drink the moment i was seated). he was pretty old school- no amount of charm or smiles would soften his Lurch-like disposition. otherwise, the rest of the staff was kind and attentive.The food: Tuna tartar- refreshing.Soup (Manhattan clam chowder)- had to convince my date not to lift the bowl for the last sips.Pork loin- portion was WAY larger than i was anticipating. pork cooked perfectly (side note: nothing annoys me more than overcooked protein). brussel sprouts were my favorite part. the sauce wasnt that special but still a very good plate of food.Seafood pasta- boyfriend said it was good, but nothing too out of the ordinary. unlike what  previous posts have claimed, there was plenty of large shrimp, scallops, and squid (which, he claimed, ""were nothing like rubber bands"" :) )Creme brule- delicious! Key lime- exceptionally tangy. The strawberry compote on the side definitely kicks up the sweetness factor so use wisely.They gave us a plate of mini dessert as well- 2 mini chocolate macaroons and 2 chocolate (white and dark) confections.Overall- this place was a joy. with food and drink $150+ So that puts into perspective the pricetag of this place on a normal day. However, here, you get what you pay for.Warning: if you arent willing to embrace ""old new york"" fine dining, stay away.  otherwise, you might wrongfully misconstrue the staffs behavior as pompus or uppity, thus putting a damper on your evening. the truth is that some places take their service very seriously, but that doesnt mean you have to. :)",1,0,0,Melanie L.,"Iselin, NJ",159,15,8
5.0,2/4/2012,"It's only appropriate that I begin my review of 21 Club with a notorious quote from the indomitable Groucho Marx:""I don't want to belong to any club that will accept people like me as a member.""Ok, it's not really a club but it's a landmark that has been frequented by legends of the screen, captains of industry and just about everyone in between. And for three glorious hours I felt like a member of a private club, receiving white glove service (Literally. The white gloved bathroom attendant joked that fellow yelper in crime Benson Y and I were taking the spots belonging to Warren Buffet and Bill Gates.) While 21 earned notoriety during the roaring 20's when Prohibition reigned supreme (Such an uncivilized time when vices were illegal...) , the repeal of the 18th amendment means you can legally drink here again. 23 skidoo!The complimentary bar munchables were quite good, roasted nuts and such. There's a fireplace! With real fire! The 1% and restaurant week 99% never had it so good.Led into the dining room, turn your head upwards. No, it's not rude and you'll be treated to a panoply of toys and memorabilia. A Cincinnati Reds hat from Pete Rose, a walmart truck donated by Sam Walton, and plenty of other corporate swag. Apparently this tradition dates back to when British Airways donated a toy, it was mounted and the rest is history. (Perhaps bars that feature womens' undergarments in similar positions share a spiritual bond with 21?)Anyway, our waiter was all too happy to explain ,with ease, the menu and the historical importance of our table.I like places that have such cachet but I also like places that deliver the goods, food-wise.No problems here as the regular menu offering of a mixed grilled wild game platter was expertly explained and carved by our waiter. He even name dropped where 21 purchases such exotic cuts as antelope. At $46, it cost more than a regular prix fixe resto week for one but here's what it contained:antelope chop, Millbrook venison loin, homemade rabbit sausage, bacon-wrapped Mangalitsa pork loin, carrot purée, ginger chutney, huckleberry sauce .How could one possibly refuse? 8 people were able to amply share a bit of each piece. I'd return just for this plate alone.Regaining fiscal sanity, I ordered from the restaurant week menu and started with the salmon tartare, served with taro chips. And as a stand alone appetizer this was quiet good but I must be brutally honest. It didn't have a chance next to the mixed grilled wild game platter (MGWGP). The taro chips were crunchy and were a fine complement to the salmon tartare, serving as a reminder of what healthy eating could be as I gorged upon rabbit sausage, feeling the blood lust du lapin.Time for a breather and a glass of malbec, recommended by ever helpful waiter.Resume feasting.Up next, Coffee-Chili Rubbed Pork Loin with sweet potato purée, chestnuts, roasted Brussels sprouts and  Oaxaca chocolate sauce.This was easily one of the juiciest pork loins I've ever had in my loin consuming career, the kind of loin that should make pig eaters across the world unite and realize that pork is so much more than the other white meat.And hats off to brussels sprouts for these veggie orbs were also flavorful, especially when dipped into oaxaca chocolate sauce.The chocolate sauce was more savory than sweet, serving as a transition to dessert, the flourless chocolate torte with peanut rum sauce and chantilly cream.It's as if Captain Morgan put a little captain in a bottle of Skippy.The peanut rum sauce was by far the distinguishing characteristic of an otherwise par for the course flourless chocolate torte. The peanut rum sauce pushes the rank over the edge of four stars and into five star heaven.So our crew of intrepid eaters, occupying a table that has  seated the incumbent president, Hilary Clinton and Dag Hammerskjold back in the day (Daaag!) staggered out well fed and ready for a return trip.Gents, wear a jacket please.

2.0,2/4/2012,"Restaurant Week provided the perfect excuse to drop in to 21 Club.  The atmosphere and bar was great and the food was below average.  Because my ratings ultimately are weighted by food quality, I cannot give a glowing overall rating.The positives, however, are: 1) the bar-- offering $3.50 six-ounce pours of beer, $7 French Sauvignon Blanc, spacious seating and complimentary bar nibbles, provides a great clubby backdrop for a relatively (an unexpected) inexpensive drink or two. If I was a ""cocktail hour"" guy, which I am not, this would be a good go-to spot.2) the dining room aesthetic- the toy collection dangling from the ceiling is neat, whimsical and kitschy, and much better than the standard and tired caricature murals of famous patrons at similar NYC institutions.3) the servers were attentive and pleasant.  Except for the bumbling attendant who kept trolling the bar calling out whose reservation had come due.  He asked us at least four times if we were with four different parties.The food is almost not even worth mentioning.  The pasta with shrimp, red-pepper sauce and calamari was bland and terrible.  Bottled Prego would have been a step up.  The salmon tartare was indistinguishable and oily.  The creamed cauliflower soup was average at best.  The spiced (coffee-chili rubbed) pork loin with brussels sprouts and sweet potato was good- particularly the pork; however its accoutrements failed in terms of execution and were essentially tasteless.  The desserts were the highlight.  The key lime tart was actually quite good and the mint-chocolate sundae was not bad.",2,0,0,Jason N.,"New York, NY",307,671,1117

2.0,1/29/2012,"Dear 21 Club: If you're going to actively suck at RW, you just shouldn't do it at all.  I guess there are two veins of thoughts on Restaurant Week from a restaurant's point of view.  One (which I like) is that it's a great way for restaurants to drum up business - let people try out places that they would like to come back to on a special occasion, get some word of mouth going.  Two (which I don't) is that these restaurants are doing us a favor by just letting us in the door.  21 Club was very much of the second view.  They have a strict dress code, no jeans, no sneakers and blazers required for the boys.  Restaurant Week patrons (us) were in the bar room, festooned with plastic toys dangling from the ceiling (shades of TGIF) and tables as packed as they could get them.  The cocktails at our table ranged from mediocre to terrible, with the Bees Knees (hopefully) missing some ingredients as its contents tasted almost entirely of lemon juice.  Shall we move on to the food?  Not only boring, but not very well prepared.  The grilled calamari was chewy and lukewarm.  Salmon in the salmon tartare was step in the unfresh direction.  The terrine was ok.  The chicken was dry but serviceable, kind of what you expect when you order RW chicken.  Pork was ok.  The pasta was intriguing in its weirdness. The clear winner of the evening was the chocolate torte, with a deep, complex flavor.  The creme brulee, which I thought would be the hardest to mess up for a uncaring kitchen was all cold, had the thinnest of sugar crusts that was already soggy, and slightly curdy, thin custard.  Service?  Every dish was literally just thrown on the table.  Clatter, rollllll.  Clatter, rolll. Over and over again.  I assume this was a RW special.  Not pleased.  So in conclusion, we were seriously disappointed. Could you tell?",3,1,0,Grace L.,"New York, NY",16,90,0
4.0,1/26/2012,"This is what Restaurant Week is all about, going to places you can't afford in your wildest dream, with your friends!We came thru 21 Club this past Monday for a late (9pm) dinner. As you know by now, this place is classy and shmancy so you can't wear jeans and you have to wear a jacket (blazer) and shoes. No problem. No one loves getting dressed up like I do.The funny thing is, the entrance is classy, there's a bar and you can order what I would guess are expensive cocktails. We walked inside however, and it kind of had a diner feel to it. Checkerboard table cloths, and it had all these ""artifacts"" hanging from the ceiling, that were like model airplanes and stuff toys and things! It was very strange. Ah well. On to the food.I ordered the the grilled calamari to start. It was alright. Had a lot of different flavors going on, with these very potent olives and other things. For my main course I got the seafood pasta, which was good. It was in what I think was vodka sauce, but the actual pasta was some very huge pieces of macaroni. It was good. One of my friends got hte salmon, which he devoured so I'm assuming it was good. Another friend of mine got the pork chop, which I had a little bit of, it was good as well.For desert I got ice cream (again) which was good if you really like chocolate, which im not really a fan of. Two people got Creme Brulee (of course) and since it's Creme Brulee it was great. My other friend got their version of the Key Lime pie, which she didn't really like, siting that there wasn't enough Key lime in it. I'm not a Key Lime fan so I didn't even try a bite, I wouldn't have given it justice anyway.The food for me was alright, but I had to give it an extra star because we managed to get a tour of the secret wine cellar downstairs! So awesome. They actually keep the wines and champagnes in the same place they kept it during prohibition, in a secret airconditioned room that is only accessed by a secret door that's actually about a foot thick wall of bricks! It was like going into the Bat Cave! Once inside, you saw all the bottles that were purchased by all these celebs and politicians, who were coming back at a later date to pick it up (if they wanted). Once you go past the wine cellar you enter the private dining room, that has a huge table that stretches out and can seat a bunch of your friends. I guess they do 7 course dinners down there, but God knows how much that would set you back per person. It seems like one of those ridiculous opulent things that rich people do however, that would actually be cool to do if you had the money to do it. I can't imagine me coming back here (unless I'm rich enough to rent out that room!) but it was an awesome experience for a first-timer like myself. I love Restaurant Week!",3,2,2,Clint H.,"Brooklyn, NY",341,479,54
2.0,1/25/2012,"I made reservations a few weeks beforehand and was so excited about finally coming to 21 club! I was disappointed when we were seated downstairs, I had expected we would be upstairs in the main dining room. To top things off, we were seated at a very odd two seated right up against the bar. It was just awkward.We came here before seeing a show, so we had the pre-theatre pre fixe menu, which is 3 courses for $40. Unfortunately, there wasn't much value. The menu was pretty, well, bad. I started with the salmon tartar, had the grilled salmon and ended with the chocolate tart. My boyfriend had the calamari, seafood pasta, and the creme brulee. we both had a glass of wine, which were the best parts of the meal! Overall, it was bland, lacked presentation, and the service was just awfully slow.I highly doubt I'll return. $120.00 + tip not well spent.",1,0,0,Victoria F.,"Austin, TX",112,211,3
4.0,1/25/2012,"I came here with my fellow co-workers for restaurant week. We sat at the Bar Room. I ordered food from their Prix Fixe Luncheon menu for only $24.07 per person. The food is excellent and the service is efficient. I tried the seasoned soup, which is the Tomato Wheat. My Main Course was the Seafood Pasta; dessert is the Creme Brulee. I loved my order. The Tomato Wheat was thick; Seafood Pasta was delectable; Creme Brulee was savory!The toys on the ceiling are gifts from regulars - the airplanes and trucks are from the executives of the companies they represent, and the sports memorabilia are from owners and famous players. This place is great if you want to discuss business with your guests and/or if you want a private time with your close friends. There are 10 rooms inside the 21 club.

2.0,1/22/2012,"I had made reservations for Restaurant Week 2012 for 4 on a Saturday night (I realized they didn't do the Restaurant Week menu on weekends after the fact). We arrived a half hour earlier than our reservation and were seated within 5 minutes. Once seated, bread was brought to the table and menu and a wine list were given to us. I have to say that seating against the wall were a bit tight, like many other Manhattan restaurants. I have been here once before, but I never understood the decor. Classic and dimly lit, the ceiling is covered with random toys. The walls are filled with quotes and sayings referring to alcohol and drunks.When one from our group looked at the wine list and ordered a bottle of Cabernet by the number, the waiter came back saying that the number was incorrect. We looked for the correct number, but before long, the sommelier came out, looking impatient, and asked what kind of wine we were looking for. We described it by type and name and he immediately knew. Great that he knew his wine; bad that he was snooty about our choice or taste.The Restaurant Week 2012 Menu was the same as their Prix Fixe Menu, except the latter was $5 more. I had ordered the salmon tatare for my appetizer, the coffee-chili rubbed pork loin for my main course, and the key lime meringue tart for dessert. Others at the table ordered the seasonal soup, which was cauliflower soup, for the appetizer, chicken a la plancha and seafood pasta for main courses, and the flourless chocolate torte and the mint mocha sundae for desserts.Salmon tartare was delicious; taro chips were light and matched well with the fresh salmon with avocado puree. When I received the pork loin, I tasted it and it was cold. The plate was warm though. My friend had also ordered the same dish and her pork loin was cold as well. We decided to send them back. When they came back out, the plates were hot. The pork loin did not taste as good anymore. It became dry and the side of roasted brussel sprouts wilted. This seems like they put the plates in a microwave to heat them up. If that's the case, they should be ashamed. For what is supposed to be a high end restaurant, microwaving to reheat a dish is bad restaurant procedure. Quite disappointing. The Oaxaca chocolate sauce was mediocre. It was nothing to rave about. When our desserts arrived, they also brought out chocolate cookies. The chocolate cookies were smooth chocolates with a bit of raspberry and thin flaky cookies in them. Absolutely delectable. The key lime meringue tart was pleasing. Perfect amount of sweetness with a light & frothy cream. It also had a graham cracker shortbread that just melted in your mouth.I cannot say how the other dishes were, but I did try a bit of the seafood pasta. It was another disappointment. For a cream sauce, it was thin and bland. The seafood was lacking; they cut the scallops into small pieces. My friend enjoyed the cauliflower soup and chicken a la plancha, but he felt the sundae was a bit too sweet. As for the chocolate torte, it was nothing special. The cookies were so much better.I guess the main word of the night was ""disappointment."" I had been there in July of 2011 and the food and service were great. The people that sat next to us were lively and fun. This time, the food was a letdown. The waiters were attentive, but the sommelier was arrogant and condescending. I don't know if the quality of food was underwhelming because of Restaurant Week or the Prix Fixe Menu, but it was definitely a different experience than last year, and not in the good way. You cannot serve passable food if you distinguish yourself as a topnotch restaurant. If I can get better food and amazing service at a restaurant that charges less, why would I want to come back? There are many restaurants in New York, especially Manhattan, that can provide that. They need to be on top of their game if they want to continue to be a reputable restaurant.",1,0,0,Tony W.,"Flushing, NY",33,11,0

2.0,1/20/2012,"2.5 stars. This is my type of joint- I love the homey, classy atmosphere, autographed toys and sports paraphernalia on the ceiling - but wow was table service and food-worth-the-price-tag absent this Friday night. Our server, a short black guy, stood around most of the evening doing nothing. After we were seated, he came over to take our drink orders and then ignored us for nearly ten minutes. I had to signal him to give us our menu, after doing the awkward squint stare off because I wasn't sure if he was our waiter. He was actually just standing nearby, looking at us. Super awkward. He was really inattentive, never brought the wine list, abrupt...really the pigeon poop on a good suit. The food was also surprisingly mediocre. I'm always hesitant to try the Restaurant Week menu when the dishes seem to be created just for RW. The seafood pasta barely had any seafood- two shrimp. Dos. No bueno. Pieces of one scallop. See photo. Ah well. A little bit of fresh pepper and it was ok. The salmon, which is noted on the menu to be organic (I forgot to ask if that meant wild vs farmed) was lovely but not melt in your mouth orgasmic, which is what I expected from 21 Club. We finished off the night with the creme brulee and a sundae which came out as a parfait. See pix. Both ok but I've had better brownie sundaes at chain establishments. I definitely felt like a B team was preparing those dishes. An hour later, my palate has long forgotten the dishes. The only bright spot of the night was an older waiter who noticed us taking a photo of an autographed helmet, told us the team's coach was recently in and spoke knowledgeably about some memorable games.

We dined in the 21 Club Wine Cellar which was a real treat -- a truly unique room with an old world feel and a bit of history thrown in.  It added to the chemistry of the room, and conversation flowed in what otherwise could have been a stale business dinner.  People at our table had either been there for the first time or were coming back to one of their favorite dining rooms in the city.  My only critique is that the food was over-the-top rich (caviar, foie gras) but nothing that couldn't be fixed with some changes to the menu that we selected in advance.  I will be back.",1,1,0,Alex D.,"Aspen, CO",4,59,1
2.0,1/15/2012,Been here several times and normally a solid experience. Not the case last night. Food - The vegetable medley was nearly stone cold. Unacceptable for a restaurant of this reputation. Burger too was only luke warm and undercooked to boot. The pork special was only fair ... nothing special at all. Caesar salad was very good as usual... same with the beet salad.Service - Disappointing. Meals were placed in front of wrong diners. Tables were packed in and one of our party was repeatedly bumped while eating by servers working other tables - inexcusable.

3.0,1/5/2012,"I was there with a group of five for New Year's Eve.  We had a four course dinner on the second floor, where there was a six piece jazz band.  First, our waiter was very friendly, and the staff was attentive even though this is obviously a stressful evening for any restaurant (and it was pretty full - the first floor was packed, the second floor full, and I saw people coming down from the third level all evening).Second, the food.  After a small, but not memorable (either in a good or bad way) amuse, my first course was the beet salad.  There was nothing to complain about, and it was quite good.  The second plate, consisting of Hudson Valley foie gras, was great.  My main was a fairly large and robust lamp chop, which was well-prepared and tasty.  Lastly, I had the profiteroles for dessert, and these seemed pretty standard.Everything was good, but not remarkable.  I probably wouldn't go here for a regular dinner, but for New Year's Eve it was perfectly acceptable.  The only thing that was a little weird was the music - they seemed to be playing a lot of low key or slightly somber jazz; this was very strange given that there is a large dance floor and it was New Year's Eve.  Maybe they need to reconsider their music selection for next year.  Also, the patron composition was a bit eclectic - a mix of random 30-somethings, large groups spanning two generations (ages 21-ancient), and even one couple who obviously couldn't find a baby sitter, as evidenced by the presence of their one year old plus stroller (seriously, who brings a baby to a New Year's Eve party?).I believe it was around $195 per person, exclusive of drinks, which was perfectly reasonable for what was offered.",1,0,0,Lester M.,"Durham, NC",10,54,15

The decor (inside and out) and even the dress of the staff all go into the complete package this place is. I'll start by saying I know Christmas Eve is a very big night for the 21 Club...we had made a reservation of 10 people over 2 months in advance and we were still sat 30 minutes late. I didn't really mind, but some of the other guests we were with are a little older and we not ok standing in the bar area for 30 minutes. When we were finally sat downstairs we were extremely hungry and ready to eat (oh except for the forgot a place setting at our table of 10)...so once we were brought another chair and setting...We all ordered drinks and a bottle of wine. The wine list is AMAZING! They also have very informative sommeliers! The server Andy ( I think) was great too. Even though we had about 4 servers throughout the meal he was very good. The food was outstanding! The menu on Christmas eve was a 3-course pre-fixe menu at something around $125. I had the crab cake and the sauteed Dover Sole. Both were the best I have ever had in my life! The dover sole came to the table de-boned which was awesome! Also, my dessert course was the homemade eggnog ice cream...seriously the best ice cream I have ever had! Ok...you must be curious why the 3 stars if everything was so great! Well, we also had some people in our party not as happy with the food. We had someone with us order a medium steak and his steak was practically rare (to rare for me and I love med rare) and it took the whole time we ate for a new steak to come out for him, making us all feel like assholes, but we didn't want our 125 dollar meals to get cold...Also, one of their picky kids sent his steak back twice, once because it had sauce on it and again because it was too rare.

Celebratory, cozy and memorable. Given the prices are a bit steep, I was able to get the 3 course meal for only $25. What I liked:- the decor (the waiter explained to us that each company gave a ""toy"" with their brand when they visited, so that all those companies are being represented in that historical place!)- the staff. Impeccable service! We were just 2 young gals, but they still treated us like royalty.- the non-pushing to drink wine or alcohol. We actually asked for the wine list but it was too overwhelming. When we decided not to order any wine, the waiter STILL brought us a taste of his selection for free! He did not ask us if we wanted more, he just left it at that! Classy.- the salad & main course, which was a mesclun salad with goat cheese and a yummy dressing. The main course was organic chicken breast with artichoke and some type of mashed potato puree. It was amazing!- they gave us 2 pieces of delicious chocolate at the end for free! Yum.What was whatevers:- the desserts. We got the peach strussel and the sorbet. The sorbet tasted like any 'ol sorbet and it was a bit too expensive for what it was. The streusel was WAY too hard on the bottom and I couldn't even finish it. I felt like I was going to break my fork because it wouldn't penetrate the bottom of the streusel!

Immediately when walking in you feel like you've been transported to another era. The decor is regal and whimsical at the same time...there are tiny toy trucks dotting the ceilings and kitschy posters hanging on the walls among dark tapestrys and furniture. My friend and I had a reservation and were seating quickly at a quiet red and white checkered table in the back dining area. The dining areas are dark and cave-like, it would be a very romantic spot for a date. Our waiter brought bread and we ordered our three course lunch.

2.0,7/13/2011,"The 21 Club... All the New Yorkers will know what you are talking about when you mention the 21 Club, but what else do they say about besides the décor and it being historically famous? The food? No. The service? No. You would expect them to exception in everything because of their reputation and the price you pay for your meal, but I didn't get ANY of that when I came here with three of my friends for Restaurant Week. Maybe it was because we looked young (every one dining there was over 50 years old) or the fact we didn't order than cocktails to boost our bills. But whatever the reason was, there was absolutely no excuse for them to treat us like crap. Because that is what they EXACTLY did. I was so excited to try the 21 Club. I worked with one of their former managers at the Carlyle Restaurant and he raved about the 21 Club. But little did I know that they don't like college students that were trying to experience good quality food with their low budgets. If you're going to treat every customer that comes in for Restaurant Week like crap, DON'T PARTCIPATE in it. Okay, the host was nice and the décor theme was cool and classic, but it doesn't make up for the 20 minutes we waited for menus and water. And another 15 minutes before we were asked about our order. Then it took a good 15 minutes to even get the check. We had to ask! Many, many times for them to even pay attention to us. I was outraged. I would NEVER go back. Okay, Yelp is about the food... So let's get to that part of the experience. I ordered the grilled calamari to start. It was okay, fancy and yummy. I ate it with the bread basket which was a fantastic array of bread. Yum... My entrée was the salmon atop cous cous with summer fruits and veggies. That was just okay. I wasn't asked how I would like my salmon cooked which was odd to me. But all the same, I was content with my dish. The night ended with  their famous crème brulee and it was my first time trying it. Nothing fantastic. I don't know what all the rave is about. It's just custard. Meh. The food was mediocre at best. I would probably get something like that at anything other restaurant. I wouldn't mind paying for how ""okay"" the food was if the service made up for it. But since BOTH lacked, I was disappointed and upset with the whole experience and how much I paid... Overall, I WILL NEVER EVER COME BACK. Either for restaurant week or to dine there on just a regular day. Service was literally horrible. They did not live up to their reputation at all. Even if I was offered a comp dinner to mend my horrible experience, I wouldn't even bother. PS. This would have been a one star review, the extra star was for the bread basket.

Despite the bad things I had heard about the service and decline in food quality I decided to give it a shot with them...Now I know I should really just trust my instincts.We arrived excited to order cocktails, food and have a great time and after checking our coats were immediately confronted with attitude. We sat down and asked for a cocktail list from one person that we never saw again. When the next server came with the menu he dropped it off and we were left to sit for the next ten minutes before we finally had to ask for a server to come and take our drink order.  When I asked for a rye manhattan and kindly asked if he could inform me of the kinds of rye they offered I received a dirty look.  I have to note that the main reason I asked about their selection is because on their cocktail list they offer the ""21 Club Perfect Manhattan' ""with your choice of rye"".  The waiter was not having any of my questions and simply brought me back the perfect manhattan and when i asked what whiskey was used he told me Seagrams 7. I'm sorry but who the hell uses Seagrams seven in a manhattan, especially at fancy pants 21 club.  When I asked to just have a Knob Creek manhattan instead he loudly threw down his serving tray and walked towards the bar.

The tortilla soup was watery and sour... how he ate it is still beyond me. The calamari was rubbery. The pork belly was alright, but more like an upscale bbq. The risotto was way undercooked and sat like a lump. Absolutely awful. Both of the desserts were amazing. Especially the salty chocolate bombe. It was the perfect combination of caramel, salt, and chocolate. The staff was attentive, but they kinda cram the wine list down your throat. We had cocktails to start and didn't order wine.

Somewhat confusing.The service was pretty prompt. We had the salmon tartar, calamari, the main course salmon, pork belly, and velvet cake and lemon merengue for desert. The tartar was tiny, but good, with it's zesty horseradish decoration. Calamari was ok, nothing to speak of. Salmon was ok as well, but how much can you really mess up when grilling a salmon...it had a bed of grain mixed with carrots. The pork belly was good, a bit on the fatty side. My merengue was bad, odd mix of clunky sugars with sugary lemon underneath. I didn't even finish it. The velvet cake was equally sugary, but a bit more agreeable.When i ordered a second glass of wine, the waiter suggested a chianti, which i liked, but turned out to be $19. A bit much for the DOC taste of Tuscany. Same for $5.50 for an espresso.Bottom line: Underwhelming in terms of food.

For the food, I ordered the salmon tartare as the appetizer, which was really fresh. My other friends ordered the grilled calamari, which wasn't bad either. As for the entree, I ordered the seared chicken breast. The skin was the best part bc it was peppery and the chicken was pretty moist. My friends ordered the pork belly, which looked really fatty to me but they liked it. The desserts here were pretty disappointing. I got the Lemon Meringue Tart and it was too sweet/sour. I know it sounds weird but I can't explain it any other way. Everytime I took a bite out of it, I had a sour face on after. It was very difficult to enjoy and eat the tart. I'm not big on desserts either and I dont have a sweet tooth, so that's something to keep in mind as well. My boyfriend for the red velvet cake and that was too sweet for me too. My other friend got the creme brulee and I'm not really a fan of creme brulee either. Overall, the restaurant was very cute and the food was okay.

3.0,12/18/2010,Just had my company's holiday party at the famous 21 club. We rented out the wine cellar and had the 7 course wine pairing menu.  The venue deserves 5 stars as does the fantastic service. However for $450/person we left a bit underwhelmed by the food when we expected an amazing culinary experience. The veal Wellington was over cooked with flat puffed pastry that was falling off the meat and the chocolate soufflé was also totally overcooked as well. Can't stress enough what a fun evening it was to be in such an incredible venue with such terrific service but still can't give more than 3 stars when we paid so much for such mediocre food.,1,0,0,Adam C.,"Morristown, NJ",37,70,3
5.0,12/12/2010,"Quite simply the best restaurant in all of NYC and beyond (in my opinion). After having read about its history, and watching it on TV shows, I just had to come here. My fiance and I were moving back to Long Island in June 2010 so we decided to celebrate our bon voyage by coming here. We had reservations on a Saturday night during Restaurant Week. We tried to order different things so we could sample each others food. Bread basket was delicious. Food was excellent. The dishes were timed enough apart that we were never rushed but we weren't left waiting either. Waiter service is commendable! Every waiter pays attention to detail. They answered all of my questions, and were there in a heartbeat to move the table for me when I had to get up. I received a complimentary glass of wine. At the end of our first visit I had asked to speak with a manager about possibly getting a tour of the downstairs famed wine cellar. He told me that there was a party downstairs. About 5 minutes later he came back and said they were finishing up and if I waited around I could the tour. I was ecstatic! One of the workers there showed my fiance and myself around and took pictures of us. We weren't rushed and all of our questions were answered. What a peeeeeeerfect way to end the night!---We came back here before Restaurant Week ended in October to celebrate our 7 year anniversary. When ordering the waiter heard me whisper to my fiance that we should get different desserts than last time even though creme brulee is our favorite and we had it already. He was nice enough to bring us all 3 dessert choices! He also noticed that I was reading a card and came over to ask the occassion. When we told him, he gave us complimentary champagne to toast.

The shortcomings that led to my ""Meh"" experience. 1) Poor service. Yes, there were at any given time about 4 different people helping our table but at about 20 minutes in between and nobody seemed to know who was our server, what we wanted, what we were waiting for etc. 2) The server didnt know what an ""Old Fashioned"" was. Came back and said the bartender had not made this drink for over 10 years. Oh and there was also a fly in the glass. So, they made it twice that night. Ew. Also, wasnt taken off the bill for the EW situation. My martini was good. 3) Food was good but nothing great. The food wouldnt take us back there again. Had the risotto and the Steak tartar. The oysters were good but we ordered 4 and they only brought out 3. Weird. Coffee was good.

For the appetizers, we got the citrus and juniper-cured mahi mahi, wild game terrine, and the potato leek soup.  The terrine came with this really good horseradish/mustard.  I also liked the mahi mahi and the soup was pretty good, sort of standard.For the main course, we ordered the wild mushroom risotto, coffee-chili rubbed pork chop, and the horseradish-crusted salmon.  My favorite was the pork chop and we all agreed.

I surveyed the crowd, which definitely consisted of people way older than me, I'm 25. The restaurant is dimly lit and the ceiling is decorated with toy trucks and other miscellaneous toys. The place was a little chilly. I went there for lunch and participated in their restaurant menu which is till the end of October. Here was what I ordered: Appetizer: Butternut squash soup with lobster - probably the best butternut squash soup I've had so far. It was creamy and delicious. However, the waiter had made a mistake and it actually would not be garnished with lobster but he brought us a small dish of lobster meat anyway which was nice. Entree: Horseradish crusted salmon - I had it cooked medium well and it was still moist and very tasty. I'm not a fan of horseradish and didn't really taste it on the salmon, I just scraped it off the top of the fish. I didn't except to get full with this meal but the salmon was quite filling. Dessert: Vanilla bean creme brulee - absolutely delicious, definitely tingled my taste buds and hit the spot. It was made really well and the crusted layer was yummy. Service was alright, it wasn't prompt but staff were attentive enough. Overall, I enjoyed it and would recommend it, especially if you are participating in their restaurant week menu.

Everywhere you go in here, you will have someone helping you do something (sit down, bathroom..., choosing what to eat, etc). Expect some extra $ to be going out for tip. Friend and I had the pre-fixe menu for restaurant week ($35) - ends Oct 31 (so go now)! Had the fried calamari for appetizer. It was well-cooked and  zesty (lemon). My friend had the cured salmon and that was also good (and interesting). I've never had cured salmon that came in cubes, but it was good. My main dish was the pork belly. It was very good, but I did feel like I ended up eating a lot of fat. It comes with a little bit of braised pork on the bottom, and a few cuts of carrot. I felt like it was a little on the meaty side w/o any vegetables, but it was still decent.Dessert- had the almond plum tart. Really good - highly recommend it.The night was full of random complimentary dishes/snacks/drinks. This restaurant is one of NYC's few old-fashioned high-class restaurants.

It's true, the crowd tends to be on the older side, and it's quite formal. There are many servers, so it can get crowded and confusing. Order from the restaurant week menu if it's available (but don't get the pork chop), or go nuts off of the regular one. They have a large wine list for under $60, and the sommelier is unbelievable; don't hesitate to ask him for advice. All of the cocktails we tasted were great, too.The seating is tight, so make friends with your neighbors. We wound up sharing a glass of port over dessert with the folks closest to us.

It reminded me of mac and cheese except it was with white cheese and with rice and the cheese was soupy. As for my dessert, I had the Vanilla Bean Crème Brûlée. I tried many before and this wasn't that great; the taste was heavy on eggs, meanwhile, it was suppose to be vanilla bean flavored. On the other hand, my friends enjoyed their meat and fish dishes.

I was a little surprised with the old fashioned banal appetizer calamari. Pork belly was pretty good, but nothing fancy or remarkable. The most surprising part was their seating. We were seated next to each other on the sofa side at a TEENY TINY table just like the disney movie ""Lady and the Tramp"" (2 doggies' love story thing).Maybe still fan experience to dine in their famous bar room, if you can go there during the restaurant week with the reasonable price.

Appetizer: gazpacho soup. Delicious, thick and creamy, not too cold.Main course: salmon. Watch out, the sauce on top tastes like wasabi so it was a tiny bit spicy. Salmon was very soft, not overcooked at all.Desert: creme brulee with cookies. The cookie was soft and delicious.

When it was time for our check we weren't even sure who was ours!

However after our dessert they didn't try to rush us out, so maybe their timing just was a bit quick. Overall good service though. For restaurant week I had the salad, spring vegetable risotto, and the creme brulee. The salad was nothing special. The risotto was good, had a good strong parmesan taste. Only complaint is it seemed like it had sat for a few minutes before serving, could have been hotter. The creme brulee was the best part of the meal and was excellent. Overall it was a nice meal.

I'm surprised that i haven't had the opportunity to dine here as I am in the financial field in NYC and this is where deals are struck and power brokers hang... I guess I'm not the power broker that I thought I was... i remember being younger and walking by this place thinking.. Hey this is the spot all the rich people go to.... Shawn A's review describes the place well. You can't help feeling the air of class and being formal when going to the 21 club. The maitre 'd greets you with a welcome Mr. ""***"" and it does give you that warm and fuzzy feeling. The staff is all older and you're not going to see a model type gal or dude as the hostess or behind the bar. It's old school done with class. And as Shawn A described it, the decoration on wall and ceiling with sports memorabilia made you think you were at TGIF. Kind of weird in a way because guys are expected to wear a jacket and tie. The diners are definitely an older crowd and they probably all live on Park or Fifth Ave in the Upper Eastside... But on to the food. Yes, I went cheap with the RW menu. It seemed right because the only other thing on the menu that would have interested me was the famous ""21 burger"" My app was the veal and pork terrine which was set in a salad. The olives and salt were combined to make a small scoop of salty goodness. The meat was almost like a fancy version of spam. I think i should have went for the soup which the waiter described as amazing. For entree, I went with the Organic Chicken Pot Pie thinking something special would be made from this dish. It wasn't, it was just a bowl of the stuff you would get in a pot pie with a crispy crust on top. Not recommended. I tried my friends Pork and the meat was a bit dry but the accompaniment gave it a nice flavor. The best part of the meal was really the dessert. I tried the creme brulee and nothing special but the Dark Chocolate Moussecake was... wait for it... ""Legendaryyyyy"" It made up for a mostly boring meal. The experience was well worth it and I'm glad I finally made it here... just to say been there, done that.

3.0,2/12/2010,"Like a lot of the other reviewers, I went for Restaurant Week, since its the only time where I could really afford going to a legendary place such as the 21 Club. I decked out in my most glam attire (although the oldies in the restaurant seemed to not like it, because it was va-va-voom red and above the knee) and accompanied a friend. Upon entering, the first thing I noticed was the cocktail lounge. VERY old school, although I felt a couple animal heads would make the lounge a little more badass. The host brings us up to the upstairs dining room, and it feels like I walked into an urban Monet exhibit. Paintings lined the walls, and the chairs, booths and tables had a muted-but-elegant color palette. The waiter was very attentive towards me and my needs. My friend, not so much, because he's a guy. He made entertaining small talk and recommended what were the good selections on the prix fixe menu. Grilled calamari was alright. Horseradish salmon was better, but I've had better salmon elsewhere. Vanilla bean creme brulee was one of best I've had. Overall, the decor and my waiter were much more memorable than the food.

3.0,2/2/2010,"I ventured to the legendary 21 Club with Mala this past Friday night to partake in 15 year in-house veteran Chef John Greeley's Restaurant Week menu. The first version of the 21 club opened in Greenwich Village in 1922, run by cousins Jack Kreindler and Charlie Berns. It was originally a small speakeasy known as the Red Head. In 1925 the location was moved to a basement on Washington Place and its name was changed to the Fronton. The following year it moved uptown to West 49th Street, changed its name to the Puncheon Club, and became much more exclusive. In 1929, to make way for the construction of Rockefeller Center, the club moved to its current location and changed its name to ""Jack and Charlie's 21"". Although raided by police numerous times during Prohibition, the two were never caught. As soon as a raid began, a system of levers was used to tip the shelves of the bar, sweeping the liquor bottles through a chute and into the city's sewers. The bar also included a secret wine cellar, which was accessed through a hidden door in a brick wall which opened into the basement of the building next door. Though still used as a wine cellar today, part of the vault has been remodeled to allow a party of up to 20 guests to dine in private. 21 Club also stores the private wine collections of numerous celebrities and statesmen. Jackets are required for men. The decor doesn't really call for it. But I suppose the women like it that it gives their beaux a reason to dress up. Everyone was looking dapper. The Bar Room also includes a lounge and, as the name implies, a bar, a really BIG one. The place kind of reminds me of a glorified TGI Fridays. The walls and ceiling of the Bar Room are covered with suspended antique toys, sports memorabilia, model planes and trucks, and other token ""chotchkies"" donated by its patrons. Perhaps the most famous feature of 21 is the line of painted cast iron jockey statues which adorns the balcony above the entrance. In the 1930s, some of the affluent customers of the bar began to show their appreciation by presenting 21 with jockeys painted to represent the racing colors of the stables they owned. There are a total of thirty three jockeys on the exterior of the building, and two more inside the doors. On the second floor is the more formal ""Upstairs at 21"" dining room which is closed off to those downstairs. I happened to wander about and took a look in and everyone in this room sneered at me as if to say, ""Close the door, peasant."" Also upstairs are several stately private party rooms. You may remember BRAVO Channel's Housewives of New York City had their finale dinner here at the end of Season One. The staff is mostly ""manned"" by 50+ year olds who have been in the game forever. It may, at times, take a while for them to get to your table, but when they do, they handle themselves proficiently catering to one's needs. We were seated at Table #4 which provided us with a full view of the west side of the dining room. After tossing down a decent Brandy Alexander we dove into our starters. Our first selection was the Citrus Cured Mahi-Mahi with jalapeños, pickled fennel and beet salad with blood orange vinaigrette. It was very refreshing and satisfying. I would never have thought to pair jalapeños with this dish, but it contrasted well with the sweetness of the blood oranges. Mala sampled the delicious Winter Greens with toasted walnut crusted goat cheese, celery, icicle radishes and aged sherry dressing. Before I knew it, it had disappeared from her plate. Usually, you get tiny servings for Restaurant Week. I was pleased to see that the portions were pretty large and substantial. I added an extra appetizer of the Seared Foie Gras with warm polenta cake, smoked chanterelles, figs, walnuts and Concord grape reduction. The lavish meaty helping of foie was just what I needed to vault me towards the next course. It was excellent. Onward, my Coffee-Chili Rubbed Pork Chop with whipped sweet potatoes, maple butter, braised kale and smoked ham hocks was generously sized, but I really didn't get any taste of the coffee and/or chilis. The floral 2008 Dundee Hills Pinot that I savored with the pork was very good, but it could not improve the dish all that much. The chop was also a bit overcooked leaving it a bit on the dry side. A better dish was Mala's Horseradish-Crusted Salmon with cauliflower purée, Savoy cabbage, root vegetables, and truffled brown butter which she paired with a lovely 2008 Albariño Bergans White from Spain. The salmon fillet was ultra-moist and combined well with the sauce accompaniment. Grievously, our Pear Tart with almond frangipane and cherry reduction fell woefully short. The tart was as hard as a ""knock-hockey ""puck. So much so, I could not cut it with any utensil available. So, I was forced to break etiquette and pick it up with my hands to eat it. Two stars for the service and ambiance, one for the cuisine. Dinner for two, with extra appetizer, wine, tax and tip was $155.",3,0,1,The Jedi Foodi E.,"New York, NY",333,107,515

Did she make a wrong turn at the Fresco? No and no. She was invited to her boyfriend's holiday party. The fiesta fiesta was held in one of the upstairs rooms. Open bar, and boy do the servers want to get you shitfaced. As soon as one was a 3/4 done with his/her drink, the server automatically was there with a refill. My one complaint is that the red wine (cotes du rhone) tasted a bit off. It tasted bitter, like a Shiraz should. Perhaps some of the bottles were oaked. This is usually a deal breaker for me, but I was drinking on someone else's dime, lest I bite the hand that inebriates me. The appetizers were pretty delicious, although I did not sample many because I wanted to save myself for dinner. The gravlox wrapped in cucumber was pretty banging, as was the lobster salad. Now the good stuff: Dinner. Pretty standard 3 course deal. Started off with a simple fennel salad. I'm guessing the chefs went low on the sodium because lots of older people were attending the event. The salad was pretty unspecial. I wound up picking off all the fennel (I find fennel pretty yick) and dumping a fuckton of salt all over my salad. Even then, it didn't taste great. My boyfriend, who eats pretty much anything i pick at, didn't even want this. Pass. Second dish: choice of lamb or arctic char. Like a good ex-vegetarian, I went for the lamb. Anemia is for pussies. The lamb was truly a lap dance for my taste buds. Cooked medium rare in a wine reduction, it was memorable. The best part was that there was really nothing fancy nor avant-guard about it. Just meat that was cooked really well. The potato pancake thing it was under was mushy and under seasoned, but I did enjoy the root vegetables strewn to the side. The dessert was apple pie ala mode. I passed on this, being a glutard. People seemed to enjoy it, though. I guess you can't really go wrong with apple pie. At least that's what the PSA's from the 1950s tell me. America, fuck yeah! The vibe was pretty much Westchester Bar Mitzvah minus a never-ending loop of the Cha Cha Slide. Great service and simple food that is cooked well. Have I eaten better? Sure.

I started with the lobster bisque, and she started with the crab cake.  Lets just say that they do not skimp on the serving sizes.  The bisque was creamy and rich balanced wonderfully by a hint of sherry without being over powering.  The large chunks of lobster were succulent and abundant throughout the large bowl.  The crab cakes were more like lump crab patties, as the filling was extremely minimal, but the flavor was powerful.  Served as an appetizer but could potentially be a meal at any other restaurant given the size.Entrees:  I had the NY strip she had the Salmon.  I must say this steak is in my top 3 of all time.  Dry aged, perfectly marbled, grilled to medium rare perfection.  Seasoned only with S&P, no other condiments were required (read melt in your mouth good).  Came with a side of broccoli, and fingerling potatoes.  Sides were delicious as well, but the steak is the main attraction here.  The salmon was also masterfully grilled, accompanied by a light butter sauce.  Again portions are much larger than your classic small plate French restaurants, which was a pleasant surprise given the cost of the meal.Dessert: I had the ""smores"" and she had the apple crumb?  Can hardly remember dessert as we were a bottle deep and I was half way into my food coma by then.  Needless to say dessert was delicious, be it slightly unnecessary after such a rich meal.All in all this was one of the most fantastic dining experiences of my life.  The staff was AMAZING and so was my company that evening.  I consider our $280 bill to be a bargain for the memory that will last a lifetime.",0,0,0,Jack G.,"Westchester, NY",3,9,0

They were both sweet enough to be desserts but not too sweet that you'd get a stomach ache. it was absolutely deliciously perfect! And for our appetizers (haha sorry im working backwards..) my friend got the tartare and i got the soup. Both were so delicious. It was simple but sooo delicious.and the atmosphere was really good. Even during lunch people seemed alive. And my friend and I eat really slowly so we stayed for about two hours and they didnt kick us out or anything. The waiters were super attentive and nice.

Until then, I'll make do with my pre-fixe menu.There was a doorman when we walked by and if it wasn't for him, we might have totally passed by this place. It's located in this cute alcove and if you see the jockeys (that were given as gifts from patrons), you've got the right place!We walked in and were greeted by many people. I checked my coat with no hassles and then we were seated in the Bar Room which is all decked out in wood. Sadly, I didn't scope out the website before otherwise I would have requested a famous celebrity's table when I made my reservation (NB: If you make a reservation online, you will be required to enter your credit card information and if you cancel, you will be billed $25). The space is very cozy but definitely not overbearing onto other parties' space. If you look above you'll see toy trucks, planes, and football helmets which are all gifts from patrons; as odd as they seemed at first to me, they did lift the stuffiness air out and made the space more friendly. The lounge in the front is also decked out in wood with plush seating and tables. The bathroom is clean, efficient in use of space, and a bathroom attendant is there with your towel.The service was very attentive and not intrusive at all. To start, I got the eggplant, artichoke, and goat cheese terrine and my friend had the salad of local greens. The dressings they used on both were addicting. For the main course I had the red wine braised spring lamb and my friend got the sauteed market fish. My dish was delicious and the lamb was so soft, tender, and juicy! Oh I want it again now. To top it off, I got the creme brulee and tasted the chocolate caramel cake which was decadent!Presentation was very nice, attention to detail was paid well. Also, their drinks looked delicious.

4.0,4/17/2009,"Went to 21 Club this morning for a private function and was served breakfast.  I thought it was delicious -- one of the best tasting breakfasts I have had.  The dining hall was beautiful although a little cramped to accomodate all of us guests.  We were served what I usually order for brunch -- scrambled eggs with bacon and potatoes -- but it certainly didn't taste like it usually does.  The bacon was the best part of the dish -- so crispy and delicious, not your typical chewy, fatty variety.  The potato compote (I don't think that's the right word for it but you get the idea) was soft and spiced just right.  The eggs were not too dry and not too watery -- just right.  Even the coffee was delicious and I don't usually drink coffee.  Granted, I don't think breakfast is served on a normal basis at 21 Club but I had such a good experience that I had to share.  I was hesitant to add that fifth star only because I haven't tried the lunch or dinner yet -- will revise when I do.",1,0,1,Reshma B.,"New York, NY",122,312,6

Our server was fun and playful.My only complaint? The table next to us, who arrived talking on their cell phone and continued to take calls, place calls and pass the phone around to other members of their party.

2.0,3/13/2009,"Twice a year, numerous restaurants in the city take part in what is known as ""Restaurant Week,"" offering reduced pre-fixes for lunch and/or dinner. When I saw 21 Club on the list, I booked a reservation immediately.When my reservation came around, I arrived on time and was greeted by a doorman in a fancy suit and white gloves. Seated near the entrance of the restaurant in what is called the Bar Room, I was unhappy with the proximity of the table to the door; so the host arranged for us to sit deeper into the restaurant at a booth.The server started us off with a bread basket and allowed me to sample a couple flavors of white wine; I chose the Chardonnay. For my meal, I ordered the only thing on the Restaurant Week Menu for vegetarians: Red and Green Oak Lettuces salad as my appetizer, Mushroom and Butternut Squash Risotto for my entrée, and the Key Lime Pie for dessert. The only thing worth noting was the lime pie. It was delicious and round in shape. Everything else was average and boring; I could have easily cooked the meal myself from scratch. Call me foolish, but when I drop $35 on a meal, I expect something more than what I can make in my kitchen. I understand it was Restaurant Week, but I could not help feeling cheated and pissed at the limited menu I was presented with. If you are going to offer vegetarians one entrée to choose from, at least make it something worthwhile and unusual. Maybe this is too much to ask?That said, the service was impeccable; from the wait staff, to the bathroom attendant, everyone was very friendly and attentive. The dining room itself was neat with toys airplanes and trucks covering the ceiling, gifts from former patrons. The horse jockeys lining the entrance are also gifts from former regulars. 21 Club has been around since the days of the Prohibition Era and from the looks of the crowd, will be around for many years to come. Younger people want to visit because it is a famous New York establishment; older people want to visit because it is a famous New York establishment. The website lists its entire history, something worth checking out. Despite my pathetic meal, I would give 21 Club another shot for the right occasion. Steer clear during restaurant week, or at least order off the main menu. You will spend about the same anyway. Beware the fanciness of the place; guys must wear a jacket and preferably a tie; no sneakers or jeans allowed.

5.0,3/2/2009,"When I was younger, my father told me that when I turned 21, he would take me to one of his old haunts in the city - the 21 Club. Well, that particular  father-daughter date never panned out, and now, at the ripe old age of 24, I figured it was about time to take matters into my own hands and go see what this place was all about. Three friends and I donned heels and black dresses for our evening dinner (who doesn't love having to get dressed up?!) and, arriving a little early, were greeted warmly by two gentlemen. After checking our coats, we were ushered into a waiting lounge, where we perused an extensive list of signature and classic cocktails ($15 a shot) and read about the 21 Club's legendary history, starting as a glamorous speakeasy in the times of prohibition. Our reservation was for 8:15, and we were prompted seated by 8:25 - not too bad. We ate in the Bar Room, at a table which, according to a plaque behind us, was Bogart's old table of choice. Considering the old world, white gloved charm of 21, this particular room seems a bit incongruous to the rest of the restaurant. But it worked. Antique toys and charms and sporting gear hung from the ceiling. I was thankful for this more casual feel to balance out everything else to prevent a feeling of stuffiness. First order of business - WINE. To say the wine list is extensive would be an understatement. There are 82 pages to choose from, ranging from $30 to $3,000+, including (thankfully) a few pages dedicated to the money conscious crowd - bottles at $60 and under. The wine sommelier (he was hilarious) suggested a phenomenal Hungarian white (Oremus Dry Tokaji ""Mandolas"" , which is the basis of the dessert wine Tokaji). Delicious.For dinner, I ordered the salmon gravlax to start, the red wine braised beef as the main, and the chocolate mousse cake for dessert. My goodness - everything was exquisitely prepared. I was in culinary heaven. I also was able to sample the chicken tortilla soup from one of my friends, as well as the salmon (main course) and creme brulee. Divine, divine, divine. The exceptional food was only heightened by the phenomenal waitstaff. Attentive to every detail, prompt, courteous - everything you would hope for in a fine dining experience.

I had the light and airy Creme Brûlée with coca bean shortbread.  It was melt-in-your-mouth yummy and the little cookie it came with made me smile.  Blair's Apple Crumble Tart with cinnamon Anglaise and sun-dried cherries was touch yourself good, it definitely won the prize for the best part of the meal.  Portions were perfectly sized and we both felt satisfied without being over stuffed when our meal finished.  A team of servers tended to our table so we were never neglected.  Courses were precisely timed and the decor of the place was just wonderful.  A definite NY classic that I would recommend to anyone for any situation.",0,0,0,Allison P.,"New York, NY",153,133,61
3.0,2/18/2009,"21 Club is a New York institution. Since FDR, every single president has dined at this fine restaurant with the exception of now former President Bush. The Bar room at this restaurant is the place to be. The staff is extremely attentive and friendly. As you walk in and state your reservation, they immediately know the size of your party and walk you to a sitting room to wait that has lush red couches and people enjoying their cocktails with items from the bar menu. You walk into the bar room that boasts of toys with company logos hanging from the ceiling. The toys, they explain, are gifts from regular customers. Their secret wine cellar has been around since the prohibition and has a two ton door that looks like a brick wall. They were never caught serving any kind of alcohol during that era. They had an interesting system of pulleys and levers at the bar that they put in place every time they were raided. The alcohol would then be automatically thrown down a chute and into the NY sewer system. After we were seated we were informed we were entitled to a complimentary drink from the bar; wine, champagne, drinks. The Restaurant Week menu had several different options that looked enticing. My choices were the following: 1. Country Style Game Terrine, rye croutons, frisée, lingonberry and spearmint jelly, grain mustard dressing. 2. Red Wine Braised Beef, baby potatoes, carrots, parsnips, caramelized pearl onions, puff pastry 3. Milk Mousse Chocolate Cake with candied orange The terrine dish was a good size, it did not come with any kind of bread as an accompaniment. The mustard on the side was delicious though it was such a small dollop, I would have liked more. It wasn't the most delicious terrine I have ever tasted, I honestly think Bar Boulud's was better, but it was a good start. My brother's gravlax appetizer was very good, though I still think my mom makes it better. The braised beef dish was hearty and filling. The puff pastry was buttery and flaky. The beef itself was soft and came apart easily. It was a very tasty dish, though I would have preferred steak. Everything on the dish went well together and was good but not my favorite. The desert was my favorite dish. It wasn't simply chocolate mousse, it was in a cake form. It was a great consistency, rich in flavor, and had a delicious dollop of cream on top. I absolutely enjoyed it. I would love to come back and give it another go with the regular menu. My food was ok, the experience of being there is what I enjoyed most.

We ordered about 7 bottles of wine, which were very good. I had the home cured smoked salmon, a bit too salty, and couldn't taste the salmon, scallops which were delicious, but couple grains of sand or shell, and the Creme Brulee was a bit runny and not fully cooked. Several of my friends salads didn't have the finishing on them.And the service. When i think, ""fine dining"" i think exceptional service.

They literally snatched it out of one of my friend's hands.Maybe because they noticed we were bunch of mid 20's college grads enjoying a fun night and took us for granted?Or they just don't know what they're doing.Either way, disappointed.

4.0,1/30/2009,"Among President Bush's many faux pas is his lack of restaurant tradition: Mr. Bush left office without visiting the 21 Club. Since FDR, every sitting president has dinned in this classic New York eatery. He clearly did not forget; his wife and daughters have eaten there and have a favorite table. This was my reason for making reservations at the 21 Club for Restaurant Week. When my partner and I dined this week we sat next to Bill and Melinda Gates' table. I loved the toy collection suspended from the ceiling that is comprised of gifted trucks and airplanes from corporate executives. You could just taste the history of the place, in a good way, not like it was old and musty or anything. To start I ordered the House-cured Salmon Gravlax. It was not spectacular and I hate capers - should have known better. My partner's game terrine was much more appetizing. For the main course I had the Wild Mushroom Butternut squash with Parmesan foam and pumpkin oil. The foam was a nice touch and the plate looked beautiful. It was so refreshing to have a well balanced risotto; I normally find restaurant risotto too heavy. And for dessert, the milk chocolate mouse cake with candied orange. Not my favorite. I much more preferred by partners Key Lime ""Pie"" which was a lime cheesecake -so good. The problem wasn't the food; it was worth it. I should have made different choices. The atmosphere is amazing though and in a sense you are paying for that more than the traditional fare. Each task is performed by a different waiter. The house also employs a sommelier who tastes every bottle before pouring your taste. We heard him teasing another patron ""I let you taste it, it must be okay."" He is right. We drank the best bottle of wine in a long time there, a Chateau de Chaize Broumilly. The bathrooms are very posh, indicative of the club feel.

The food is so-so and the service is pretentious.  The whole thing felt like a big performance of dining out.My friend came straight from the bus from Boston, and she had a backpack and small duffel bag.  Instead of allowing her to leave her bags in the coat check room, they made her leave them outside the room right next to the front door.  We actually ended up taking one of the bags with us into the restaurant so that we wouldn't worry about her laptop being stolen.  (I'm sure there's not a ton of theft at this restaurant, but still.)  It was a bad first impression.The food was mediocre at best.  We ordered from the $35 prix fixe menu that was set up for that week.  We both got the salad with walnuts and cheese.  My friend is allergic to nuts, and they were attentive to her allergy.  Unfortunately, the salad was a measly size, even for such a nice restaurant, and wasn't particularly good.  I had the roasted organic chicken for my entree, which was fine and the best part of the meal.  For dessert I got some kind of chocolate tart, which was somewhat bland.  I also ordered a cappuccino that was just okay.The place really seems set up for tourists.  I can't totally explain why, but it's just the feeling I got.  One reason is the note on the check - ""20% Gratuity is Recommended for Servers.""  What kind of classy NYC restaurant has that on the check?  It's probably because most of the diners are not from NYC and aren't aware that 20% is pretty standard here for good service at a nice restaurant.We couldn't wait to pay our check and leave.  If you're looking to go out for a ""true NYC experience"" or to take someone for a special meal, I would definitely skip 21 Club.",1,2,0,Rachel G.,"Queens, NY",60,262,5

Furthermore, it served as a stark contrast to the wildly uninspired and wholly unsatisfactory experience I had at Tavern on the Green--an equally venerated supper club--the night before.I sat in the Bar Room. The bar is in the Bar Room, no doubt, but it's not the same as sitting at the bar.The Bar Room is the heart of the 21 Club, and its rich, dark paneled walls are enlivened by an assortment--no, a melange--of vintage toys suspended from the ceiling. It *is* a bit, well, incongruous, considering that you're greeted at the door by a gentleman in a 3/4 morning-coat and a top hat and escorted down a carpeted hallway lined with sconces. But in this room is an odd confluence of class and charm that's stately yet lighthearted.Service was white-glove; not at all stuffy, contrary to other reviews, but still very old world. The waiters weren't at all brash or invasive, but they did make soft-spoken conversation.I don't remember the soup that was offered that night, but I remember the appetizer well. It was a classic preparation of seared foie gras (yes, if you've read my other reviews, you know my insatiable appetite for this barbaric delicacy!) atop a toasted brioche with a redcurrant reduction. Sublime. Unfortunately, it is no longer available in this iteration, although I'm sure the chef has devised a worthy successor!For the main dish, I stuck with one of the classics. Steak Diane. See, one of the most wonderful things about the 21 Club is that it will appeal to the most die-hard traditionalist while charging forward with a progressive streak to satisfy the more adventurous, cutting-edge diner. I tend more toward the former, but if a restaurant could be all things to all people, this might just fit the bill.In any event, the steak was positively superb, prepared tableside with every bit of ceremony and flourish that one would have though died out long ago. The balance of flavor was unparalleled: that mingling of butter, shallot, dijon, and cognac--perhaps woefully outmoded to some--was nothing short of transcendent. Comfort food gone high-class.For dessert, it was the obligatory souffle, a chocolate one, with a raspberry coulis and vanilla ice cream. It was good--about as good as a chocolate souffle could be.Likewise, the 21 Club is a good restaurant--about as good as a restaurant could possibly be.",4,2,4,Mark M.,"West Covina, CA",94,169,0
4.0,8/8/2008,"Oh 21 Club, how fancy you look from the outside.I went with a friend for lunch during Restaurant Week. I loved the decor and how it was like a Ivy League boy's club, but I have to nitpick about the waiter we got. Firstly, the menu had a lot of great choices - you had your fish, beef, chicken, pasta as a main. Appetizers included game terrine, salmon, gazpacho. Dessert included pie, cake, cheesecake, creme brulee. I picked out the game terrine, fish (which was salmon), and the blueberry pie. My friend picked out the gazpacho, beef, and some sort of cake. The waiter was very brash when taking our orders and made it feel like we didn't fit in (but I don't think we were that bad, we were dressed in business casual). Furthermore, even tho we sat and ordered long before the people next to us sat down, they received their food first! Now, this meal was already supposed to begin at 1:30, so it was probably around 2 when we got our appetizers. The waiter must've looked at us like we were crazy when we asked him why the people next to us were served earlier.From then out they were very quick with the food - but it also felt like they were rushing us out. The food itself was great though. The game terrine tasted fantastic with the bed of greens. The salmon was perfectly cooked, perfectly flaky and just the right about of rare. The blueberry crumble pie was AMAZING! It was a small tart and had the perfect flavorings. I would definitely go back just for the blueberry crumble pie.Despite the brashness of the waiter, I still had a great experience and would definitely go back.",3,0,1,Joanna L.,"New York, NY",197,367,236
3.0,7/23/2008,"I went here for a 21st birthday party (I know, how original) and though I wasn't paying, I did expect the food to be amazing considering the expensive prices. Unfortunately, though pretty good, the food didn't exactly meet my expectations. The crab cake was bland, and the same could be said of the Pan-Roasted King Salmon. While most other reviewers describe the nostalgic twinge to the place, I wasn't as charmed by the 21 Club. Perhaps it's because my Jamaican cab driver told me that the restaurant was racist because of its jockey statues out front, or because I tend not to buy into old money pretensions, but I didn't feel entirely comfortable with the seemingly stilted formalities of the establishment. Nevertheless, our waiters were extremely nice and professional; as at most upscale restaurants, they knew when to keep their distance and when to offer their assistance. The service, if nothing else, is probably what I would go back for.EDIT: I forgot to add that the cocktails were also superb. Having just recently returned from a four-month-stay in London when I dined at the 21 Club, I was shocked and excited to see that they served Pimm's cocktails. I promptly ordered one up, and it did not disappoint.Bathroom Grade: 7/10. Somehow, even the bathroom made me feel bad about my proletarian roots. Very clean, though.",2,0,1,Sylwia W.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,155,44
2.0,6/10/2008,"I went to 21 Club today for a business lunch and both the atmosphere and food were very much in line with my expectations.I started with their Boston bibb lettuce salad with shredded carrots, and a thick slice of goat cheese in aged vinaigrette. The salad was a bit soggy, or tasted as if it had been tossed earlier in the day as the there was no bite or crunch to the lettuce at all. It was soggy. The vinaigrette was on the very-oily side. However, I appreciated the chopped dill spinkled over the salad and piece of goat cheese; thought it added a nice detail to the overall taste of a rather simple salad.For the entree I had the flambeed tableside steak with pearl onions, roasted fingerling potatoes, cherry tomatoes and haricots vert. I asked for the meat to be cooked medium (wasn't in the mood for rare meat). I also had their salmon. The steak was good. I would say that the food is elegant and simple. It's prepared well but nothing to rave about. The salmon, I thought, was prepared wonderfully though with just the right amount of rareness in the center. The pieces just flaked off. However, they must have poured a handful of salt over the crust (minor offense) because my first bite was very salty. Overall, the portions are on the small side. The salmon was larger relative to the beef. The side of veggies was also small.They had this delicious cake for dessert. It was 3 layers of cake, similar to castella, and in between each layer of cake was a thin layer of bright orange gelee or some sort of tangy orange meringue. The slice of cake came with a side of fruit relish consisting of strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. This dessert was EXCELLENT. I love castella cake if it's done well, and this cake was definitely done well--moist and fluffy.The interior is very old school. It reminds me of the interior of Ralph Lauren's RUGBY store (if it was a continuation of the store). I think this place favors an older male crowd (60s-70s). Dining here feels like you are visiting someone's 17th century estate, and you are having lunch/dinner in their dark/dimly lit and carpeted living room or dining room.The food is definitely decent. It's not spectacular, but it's not disappointing either. I woudn't recommened the restuarant to friends, but if you're looking for a casual power lunch spot, then this is a good choice.",3,1,1,Stella Y.,"Atlanta, GA",124,366,277

4.0,4/21/2008,"My boyfriend brought me here one random night for a surprise dinner after work. The only thing he told me was to put on something nice...ie. don't wear jeans. That left me guessing since I thought that almost every restaurant I go to or want to go to allows jeans these days. When he told me where we were going I wasn't surprised because he had told me it's his favorite restaurant. Now my boyfriend loves what this restaurant embodies...which is the charm. It is about old, classic NY. We had to wait at the bar for 15 minutes or so until our table opened up. When we were brought to our table I was thrown off. They had us both sit next to each other on the seat, not across from one another. I had never been seated like that while on a date but it was very romantic. I thought it would be weird not to look at my boyfriend across the table but it wasn't...it was nice. I like to cuddle so it was up my alley.The food was great. I had the swordfish...which was actually the first time I've ever had it. It was delicious. It came with polenta which I thought I hated...but the 21 Club made me a polenta fan. Maybe it's just my mom's polenta I dislike.  Anyway, my entree was just delicious. My boyfriend had the filet and he loved it.The service was impeccable. The waiter was kind and accomodating.

5.0,1/14/2008,"If you've never heard of this place, it's helpful to research it a little to understand what the hype is all about. Established in the 1920's, it was one of the most celebrated speakeasies in the city thanks to their expertise in throwing off investigators who conducted raids during the prohibition era. They had a whole system of pulleys and levers which disposed all evidence of alcohol into the city's sewer system down below, and then there's the famous secret wine cellar which isn't really beneath building 21 but rather building 19. This was also the cellar in which the Mayor was in during a raid. Humphrey Bogart proposed to Lauren Bacall here. More fun facts?  - One rainy night, Robert Benchley uttered the immortal wisecrack, ""Get me out of this wet coat and into a dry Martini."" - 21club.com. I believe a fellow Yelper even has this phrase as his tagline. 21 Club is definitely steeped deep in history, and a place where history was made. Once you've learned a bit of 21 Club's legendary hype, you may be able to appreciate your dining experience a little more. *Do take note that it is a strict 'jacket & tie' policy for men.* It's very old school NY, complete with Wall Street moneymakers, and a crowd you would expect to mostly hail from the UES. It's where you should definitely mind your manners - applies to celebrities as well! (Britney Spears is most likely unwelcomed here) Surprisingly, the suspended toys above doesn't take away from it's class factor. In fact, it feels right! Dignified men dressed in formal attire make up most of the staff here, and the overall service was attentive without being overbearing, and very very efficient. The menu is pretty diverse ranging from foie gras to senegalese soup to decent choices for seafood, poultry or steak. I started with the foie gras, (which I am very cautious to order) because I like mine done a certain way - seared and somewhat crispy. It didn't come out quite the way I liked it, but was still palatable and I actually finished the whole hunk of it. The accompanying brioche was quite a soggy disappointment. I think the texture of something crustier would have complimented the foie gras better. Next was the steak tartare. It was definitely one of the better steak tartare's I've tried. This time it came with crusty toasts that complimented the steak well. Very yummy! However, the serving was huge and I had half of it left on my plate. My boyfriend ordered the dry aged sirloin which was (again) huge but done just the way he wanted it. No complains there! I had a side of brussel sprouts and it was delicious!!! The most important part to these infamous veggies is just getting it right - which is not often accomplished! Chocolate souffle was the choice dessert, but I must say it was the least impressive dish throughout the meal. The souffle was dry and with slight traces of moist chocolate left in its core. I've had good souffles, and this was definitely not one of them.All in all, this is a place where one MUST visit at least once. It is very pricey and to enjoy your dinner, you should be able to afford it or at least try loosen your budget for the night. This place is rightfully legendary, and if you allow yourself...you will enjoy the experience!p/s: My spectacular Bellini and my boyfriend's gimlet were complimentary...for no reason!

4.0,4/6/2007,"Phenomenal place -- went with the girlfriend for Restaurant Week and had an absolute blast. The food was literally fantastic - I was expecting good, and perhaps went in with the conception that the whole thing was a little overhyped, but frankly, the food did not disappoint in the slightest. It was simply stellar. Our wine sommelier was exceptionally knowledgeable and described the pros and cons of each of the wines that had made our short list -- he conducted himself with a great deal of class and we ended up with the perfect bottle. Amusingly, we made friends with the couple next to us who had commented on our wine selection - we ended up letting the guy taste some of our wine. My girlfriend and I then were mysteriously brought 2 flutes of Perrier-Jouet which we definitely had not ordered, and I figured that it was ordered by our new tablemates to thank us for the wine tasting (it was a rather nice bottle). Being a little tipsy, I figured I'd return the favor - the guy and I had been talking about scotch and he turned out to be a little bit of a fan as well. I called the waiter over and secretly ordered him a glass of Oban to try. When the waiter brought it out, the guy was surprised and he asked the waiter who'd ordered it for him and the waiter nodded over at me. I told him that it was in return for the champagne, and he and his girlfriend looked puzzled - turns out they hadn't ordered it for us! (We never found out who did...) The guy now feels beholden so he asks me to order a single malt on him (I am rapidly becoming rather drunk...) but they didn't have my favorite (Bruichladdich 15 or 20) so I ordered the same as I'd gotten for him -- and we got drunk together. Turned out to be a great night - my girlfriend, also rather drunk at this point, exchanged numbers with his girlfriend so they could hang out.

We arrived a little early for our reservation and were seated right away. While the decor was a little unexpected at first (there are toy trucks and things suspended from the ceiling, license plates hanging on the wall, and Fredrick Remington statues all over the place), I grew to enjoy looking at this ""collection."" And it made the room feel cozy and comfortable...and a little old school. The service was incredible...attentive, but not too attentive. The skilled waiters were informed about the menu, and they were willing to get you anything to make your meal more enjoyable.  The Restaurant Week menu was extensive here, with four choices for each of the three courses. Though even before the meal started, we couldn't get enough of the warm bread that was brought to the table. I opted to begin my meal with the ""21"" Caesar Salad which was very fresh and tasty. The dressing was just right, and evenly dispersed throughout the salad. My companions ordered the Barbecue Shrimp, which looked delicious, and they agreed that it actually was as good as it looked. My main entre was Roasted Chicken with asparagus...the chicken was so moist and well-seasoned, that I couldn't get enough. I do wish I had ordered the Sea Bass that my friend chose, as it was served on a bed of rice and just looked so wonderful. My other friend ate the Duck Confit, which she also said was well-cooked and tasty.  Dessert was almost too much after so much food, but we are never ones to say ""no"" to the sweets! I got the Semi-Sweet Brownie with ice cream, which was very rich and though I couldn't finish it all, I ate as much as my tummy could handle! I tasted my friend's Pistachio Mousse and Chocolate Mousse, which was light and delicious. And my other friend had a lovely Creme Brulee with fresh berries..yum! Before leaving the restaurant, we took a little walk around to see the other rooms on the main floor. It's a fun classy restaurant, with a lot of New York history (it used to be a speak-easy, and there is still a hidden wine cellar room that can be used for private parties).

(I told another summer, ""I feel like we should be making out here."")  I was not that enthused by the place or meal at all. The salad I had was very fresh and yummy, but I would much rather have appreciated being able to see what I was eating. I had a freaking $27 burger which ended up being not all that great. The warm cinnamon and vanilla rice pudding dessert was really good, though.Overall, it just did not live up to the hype.",3,1,1,Audrey J.,"Los Angeles, CA",605,618,78
2.0,2/27/2006,"I know this place is THE NY establishment - but it absolutely did not live up to all the hype. I was just there this past weekend for a corporate function and was quite unimpressed. Basically, the food was nothing special - I had wild mushroom risotto, filet mignon and cheesecake for desert. It was good - but honestly, for the price, I've had much better. The service was good though. All in all, the place is one of those that I think you go to once, just to say you have been there - but it won't become a tradition for me.",1,0,1,Anna P.,"Boston, MA",28,123,0
5.0,2/12/2006,"Every time I go here (which isn't that often), I feel like I am a. joining a part of New York history and b. in for a special evening, amongst the sophisticated and successful.  I love this place for both of those reasons, plus the service is impeccable and the food is sophisticated and successful as well.  However, I see it as a place to go to celebrate a business success (i.e. a promotion) or a business event due to the high prices.",0,0,0,lisa S.,"New York, NY",55,95,0
4.0,1/14/2006,"I had the chef's tasting menu with wine pairings...7 courses for $120pp. You have to ask for it. Food was all deftly prepared ""classics"" from the caviar to the mostly-crab crabcake to the risotto to the filet. A little intermezzo was surprising fruit soup. The wines which were chosen were fairly high quality, if not that inventive [Cakebread Sauvignon Blanc for example] Highly recommended for a special occasion.",1,0,1,Chinku G.,"Hicksville, NY",21,541,0
3.0,1/12/2006,"Service is excellent, but the menu is highly overpriced....attractions for the tourist and for the people on business..food and atmosphere is excellent but not worth the money..try the wide variety of wines when you dine.full credit to the waitresses",0,0,0,Puneet C.,"Hicksville, NY",7,407,0
5.0,11/29/2005,"We ate here on a very very hot July day recently and even at 3pm in the 90 degree heat, they made my dad put on a jacket. I love this place for all of its history and the stuff hanging from the ceiling is amazing and very whimsical. I had a huge hamburger and it was one of the best I've ever eaten. It is odd that they are so pretentious in this kind of casual but fun place, I guess that's part of the allure, no? I love the food here and the atmosphere is very intriguing. I will keep coming back to this famous watering hole and maybe get lucky enough to get a table in the room where they found the prohibition bottles after so many years.",0,0,0,Steve M.,"New Hyde Park, NY",3,528,0
5.0,10/8/2005,"This former speakeasy is as much of a Manhattan landmark as the Empire State Building. Thirty-three statues of jockeys greet you at the entrance, and inside you'll find items as diverse as artwork by Frederic Remington, Wayne Gretzky's helmet, and a replica of PT-109 donated by JFK himself. While its a la carte menu, famed for the chicken hash and Dover sole, is prohibitively expensive (a burger is priced at $30, and most of the remaining entrees are in the $39 - 46.00 range), there are ways you can dine here without going broke. The Bar Room offers a three-course lunch Monday through Friday for $33, and a three-course pre-theater dinner Monday through Saturday before 6:30pm for $38. Upstairs, in an elegant, more formal dining room, you'll find a three-course prix fixe menu Tuesday through Saturday for $68. No matter what your social status may be, you'll be greeted warmly and treated with respect by the managers and staff.",5,0,5,Gourmet G.,"San Francisco, CA",99,2099,2099
