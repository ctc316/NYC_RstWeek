5.0,4/25/2019,"This is the Rolls Royce of Italian restaurants in NYC. I've dined @ Il Mulino three times since I've arrived in New York. The price tag is steep, but worth it in my opinion. My most recent experience was with my Gf, who is a recent transplant to NY. We both started with a special of Porcini Ravioli .It was light and divine. My entree was Red Snapper en Cartoccio. If you had placed a one hundred dollar bill on the table, and the Red Snapper next to it, and given me a choice, the Red Snapper would have won. We both finished of our meal with Zabaglione and berries. The Zabaglione was light and airy, and the berries were tender and sweet. We almost floated out the door after our dinner. We will repeat the next time that I have some inheritance money to spend.",0,0,0,Randall M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,37,0
2.0,4/6/2019,"One word. Inconsistent. We have gone to the new TriBeCa location 3 times. Each time the experience is different, but not necessarily in a good way. Service is usually fair at best. Definitely not what should be expected at these prices. Chicken parm was amazing the first time    The second time I ordered it the chicken was dry, tough and over cooked. At $44 for chicken parm I sent it back and felt like ordering delivery from the closest pizza joint. Tuna carpaccio was tasteless and tough. And served with cocktail sauce!  Not sure who thought that up but clearly a bad idea. Previously there was an assortment of delicious crudos. These are no longer available. With all the tough competition in TriBeCa (Locanda Verde up the block) it's difficult to imagine that Il Mulino will be around too long. Not unless they quickly get their act together. At dinner last Thursday night there were lots of vacant tables. While Laconda, Mr Chow, Tamarind, Jung Sik and American Cut were booked to capacity.",0,0,0,Ed B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0
5.0,3/10/2019,"I can't say enough AMAZING things about II Mulino. I've dined several times at both the uptown and downtown location, and downtown has my heart. There is something about the ambience and atmosphere- you feel like you are in an old school, elegant Italian restaurant where the staff treats you like family. Make sure you make a reservation well in advance, it's a popular spot!As for their food, you can't go wrong with anything. Before you even get a menu, they bring so many complimentary goodies to your table. Fried zucchini, fresh Parmesan, bruschetta, garlic bread... more bread! It's delicious and a yummy treat.I recommend splitting a pasta as an appetizer and then getting an entree. As I said before, you can't go wrong with anything. It's always fresh and prepared to your liking. Keep it up II Mulino! Absolutely delicious and a wonderful experience.",0,0,0,Jessica P.,"West Milford, NJ",0,16,6

2.0,2/10/2019,"Came back to this place because I remember it being great. Either my memory is getting foggy, or Il Mulino has changed. The service was atrocious. In my mind, the only way you can get away with charging $50 for chicken parm is if you are going to provide it alongside excellent service.Unfortunately this isn't the case at Il Mulino. Waited 20 minutes for menus, during which time the waiter came over twice to ask us ""if we're ready."" Once the menus came and we ordered wine, we waited another 20 minutes before that came. Again the waiter kept asking us if we're ready. This time we responded, ""yes, ready for that wine we ordered.""The food was good, not amazing, but certainly solid.Got some tea with our tiramisu. Celestial Seasonings. C'mon Il Mulino, for what you're charging me for this hot water and tea bag, you need to do better than celestial seasonings.Bottom line: $450 for Italian food that is on par with many places in Brooklyn where you'll pay 1/4 the price. We won't be back",1,0,0,Matt B.,"Staten Island, NY",35,36,32
5.0,2/2/2019,"I was a law student, watching from the second floor balcony of NY Law School when a small bagel shop closed and an Italian restaurant opened in its place.  A year or two after I became a lawyer, I had a business dinner here which was amazing.  I have eaten here fifteen or twenty times over nearly 40 years for business meals but also anniversaries, and kid's 21 st birthdays and my own 65th birthday just recently.  It is simply my favorite restaurant in New York.  It has changed little with incredible food, fantastic service, and a cozy ambience that somehow fits a crowd in for every lunch or dinner, but never makes you feel rushed.  I recognize many of the waiters who have been here for 20 or 30 years.  They are the type of professional waiters you find in the best restaurants in Rome.  I strongly recommend the pappardelle as an appetizer and either the Italian cheese cake or poached pear for dessert but pretty much everything is fantastic, with incredibly fresh ingredients, innovative spices and sauces  and large portions.  It is VERY expensive, but fortunately worth it.  Although there are many other In Mullino's in NYC or elsewhere, this is the original, and remains much as it was when it opened in 1977.",1,0,0,Mitch K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,45,3

I ordered a seafood dish that did not come over pasta which I thought was odd. My date did order pasta as a side, thank god. My dish was apparently spicy, but I really didn't find it very spicy at all (high spice tolerance). My date thinks this place is amazing, but I honestly wasn't that overly impressed with the taste of the food, I've had better.

5.0,12/4/2018,"My dinner here was one of the best I've had in New York.  Definitely top 5.  Il Mulino is a cute restaurant located near NYU.  The ambience and decorations really take you to a different era.  There was already food on the table when we got there, bread and some salami.  The bread was super moist and flavorful.  I didn't even need to add oil or anything to it.  The wine was delicious.  Since there were 7 of us, we got a big bottle which was plenty.  We got a variety of appetizers: burrata, artichoke salad, meatballs.  The burrata was creamy and came with tomatoes and roasted red peppers.  The artichoke salad was amazing and had a good portion of avocado in it.  I didn't try the meatballs but my co-workers said they were really good.  We then had a round of pasta which came with pesto gnocchi, butternut squash ravioli, and spaghetti.  The ravioli was my favorite.  I also liked that the spaghetti came with fresh roasted garlic on top.  I was so full by the time desserts came but somehow managed to make room for them in my stomach.  The tiramisu was delicious along with the chocolate cake and cheesecake.  Would love to come back sometime.",0,0,0,Aarti G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",172,48,0

Before you even order your apps they come out with  all sorts of interesting foods to pick at. All the dinners what we ordered were better then the next.

5.0,10/19/2018,"NYC has thousands of restaurants.  There is a reason why every time I visit, Il Mulino is on the list. Let's start with everything they bring out before you even order:Bruschetta: chopped tomato and basil, bathed in decadent olive oil, on top of bread.Fried zucchini: now don't do go to fried zucchini that you see at sports bars or junk food restaurants, (and in my best connoisseur accent) ""for we are talking about Italian fried zucchini.""  Think of it cut the short way so that it looks like circles-not strips. With a light crumple and then flash fried. This comes out room temperature.Cheese: they bring a huge round of Parmesan cheese and carve out a good sized portion for you to enjoy.Now on to the menu: every night they have several off menu specials, so listen up because they are pretty enticing.  I chose to have the lobster pasta that was one of those features.  Quite tasty- could tell the lobster was fresh and it was made with a simple garlic olive oil sauce and topped with as much Parmesan cheese as my heart desired.  My husband opted for the whole branzino, which is always on the menu and as always, it was unbelievably delicious!!",13,9,15,Ariana M.,"Newport Beach, CA",764,107,178
2.0,10/18/2018,Underwhelmed to say the least. After enjoying a homey and hearty meal at Jackson Hole as our first New York culinary experience I think maybe we expected a lot more from a place that we had heard good things about (and had a much higher cost per ounce of food and experience)Arriving  at Mulino we were greeted by the usual cramped quarters and harried experience which seems to be the norm for top end restos. We tried to order martinis from Augustine who made it very clear that we (and most customers) were certainly a nuisance at best. Considering the whole experience was a cheesy trade off between pseudo Italian elitist attitude mixed with a (Spanish?) hospitality the staff experience was confusing at best. Some were snotty and distracted and others gracious and kind. Augustino the bartender should decide if he still wants to stay in the game. If so do it well and represent the brand properly or retire. We are good either way. Onto the food. I can sum it up quickly. Meh....at 72 bucks for what I hoped would be a better bistecca than I could make at home I was severely disappointed. Dry edge and obviously a rushed prep made it a major disappointment. As was my wife with her Branzino (best served as a share dish for sure) and my pal with his dried braised veal with minimal sauce to offset the dryness it didn't last through them meal. . I have had better accompaniments  at neighborhood barbecues and other than the bread and some of the appies nothing else was remotely memorable. I don't write often but must say this was a hard miss and one I would skip. You don't need value if other things like service and food is exceptional and vice versa-versa. Mulino missed on all fronts with us and I won't likely ever return. Even the deserts were pedestrian. Save your money and the disappointment and choose higher rated and less pretentious NYC food emporiums that aren't so full of themselves that they can't remember that delivery trumps longevity and genuine welcoming staff are far more inviting to those new to the scene than those that expect you to be grateful that you are allowed to pay high prices for the opportunity to share in what should be a dying brand already if this is what one can expect as the norm.,3,0,0,Kelly H.,"Winnipeg, Canada",0,10,1

5.0,9/20/2018,"After being shut out on previous attempts we managed to snag a reasonable 6:30 reservation on a Sunday for the birthday of mio figlio. We were shown to a small four top - pro tip -- come as a couple you'll likely get the same size table, or come as five and get one of the bigger ones.Once you get seated there's a swirl of activity as you get a bread basket, bruschetta, salame, a bit of eggplant and a chunk of parmigiana as your free antipasti. The bread basket is one of the stars of the show - particularly the chewy parmesan toasts.The bottle of Arneis we ordered was out of stock. the house's first substitution did not go over well, a second, drier wine said to be a Pinot Grigio satisfied the feinschmecker, who was serving as the evening's tastevin. At $65, it seemed reasonable.We decided to share two apps and two pastas amongst the four of us. The scallops wrapped in pancetta came two to an order, but my tablemates dissuaded me from an extra order. The two scallops were large enough to divide, and the savory spinach on the side provided an alternate taste. The artichoke/avocado salad, a special, was a bit larger, and was shareable. It was also excellent.The servers split and plated our two pastas into sharing portions - and these were of good size. There was a savory thin pasta (capellini?) with funghi, and a squid ink with seafood - mostly tender medium/small shrimp. These were perfectly cooked and well seasoned.With the main courses we had glasses of Barolo - $25 but in fine fettle. The server really should have announced the price of the rack of lamb - at $90 it was significantly more than the menu entrees. It was large enough to allow for sharing - the feinschmecker would go on to make a second meal out of it. The mustard herb crust was on point, but the meat was too delicate for my palate - if you like a lamby tasting lamb this may not be your choice. It came with a plate of - well --sort of home fries. At $72, the double cut veal rib chop was the same price as the steak on the menu. It's harder to argue with the price of such a prime cut. Still, the one I had at Brando's a few weeks before was just as large, and they charged a measly $44. The veau was perfectly cooked, anointed with fried sage leaves, but under-seasoned. Looking back on it, I should have asked for the pepper mill to make a reappearance. The veal came with roast potatoes. At $38, La Portena's Veal Saltimbocca was the bargain basement entree and the best value, a fine portion, nicely cooked and sauced.  We had initially forgotten to order contorni - asked for some broccoli rabe when the apps were cleared. Although I would have thought this was doable and the wait staff did not indicate there would be an issue,  the broccoli rabe did not make an appearance. This was the only service lapse.We were full enough, so we ordered but one dessert for the table. The tiramisu was just large enough for everyone to have two tastes. Perfect.The espresso was on the strong and bitter side, shall we say more Naples than Milan.Overall, a 4.5 so I rounded up to yield 5 stars. I thought this was on the same level as Carbone, but about 25% less expensive and with friendlier service. My offspring would beg to differ, finding Carbone to be on a higher plane.

5.0,3/21/2018,"Two years ago, I returned to Il Mulino after a twenty year or so absence. The occasion was my son's sixteenth birthday. The meal was magnificent and my son advised that he would like to visit Il Mulino every year on his birthday. That was fine by his parents.Our son turned eighteen this year. We reserved roughly a month in advance. Scored a nice table along the back wall and went to work on the complimentary nibbles. Fried zucchini, bruschetta, parmesano reggiano, a fabulous selection of breads. A couple of glasses of Proseco. Appetizers? Fried calamari with a properly spicy marinara, a special order shrimp fra diavolo and a salad with artichoke, walnuts, avocado, frisee and aged parmesan. Dressed in lemon juice and olive oil. On to the main courses and a couple of glasses of Barolo. My son only has eyes for the special rack of lamb in the mustard bread crumb crust. Although a half rack is available, my son like the full rack. It's an impressive yet pricy affair but it is always prepared beautifully. I have had the special double cut veal chop for the last two years so I tried something different. The special Osso Bucco was everything I hoped for. Delicious, slow roasted, very rich. A side order of rosemary potatoes was on the stingy side but redolent of rosemary and crispy. Just my style. My wife had a special also. Gnocchi with lamb ragu. What a beautiful and delicious plate of food. So delicious that I have spent the morning planning how to replicate it at home. Amazingly, we still had room for desert, grappa and coffee. Coconut sorbet, tartufo and flourless chocolate cake. No complaints. Off we went, our son another year older and the three of us looking forward to our next meal.

Personally Ifeel they are both equally good. The decor is charming and intimate. The staff are all polite and courteous. The food is on another level. I took a cousin from SoCal to the Uptown location last year. He declared that it was, ""The best Italian food I've ever had."" He's pretty close to the mark with that statement. I had the grilled octopus salad special and the squid ink pasta with bay scallops and shrimp. The pasta was cooked to al dente perfection. The seafood was all perfectly cooked and melt in your mouth tender. My wife had the Bronzino which is one of her favs. They present it to you and then debone it for you. Expertly done to the point that I dare anyone to find a bone.Enjoyed it all with a bottle of prosecco.I've seen a few reviews that complained about the prices.

The service was top notch as always, but the food itself was not worthy of the price paid. When we walked outside we also noticed that it had a ""B"" rating for health and sanitation- very upsetting.

The service was cold and robotic. I got the impression we were just another party at the table. The waiter who took our order was aloof and disinterested.  We aren't ignited yet we weren't given any warm notes of welcome. The prices are very high.  42 bucks for a bowl of rigatoni is a bit much.  This place seems to stand still why others ""eat its lunch"" pun fully intended.  There are better and happier places that make you feel welcome and which have much more rationale prices.

The service and food at this Italian staple compliment each other more than spaghetti and meatballs (no pun intended). You walk in and instantly feel as if the restaurant was featured in The Sopranos or something; that's how old school Italian this place is. Whether your dining with friends or family, you're apart of something bigger the second you walk in; you're now apart of their family! Immediately upon sitting, your greeted with fresh chunks of Parmesan cheese cut tableside from a huge cheese block, accompanied by homemade Italian bread, bruschetta, and sliced marinated eggplant. You haven't even been there for 5 minutes and yet course #1 is servedAfter stuffing your face with their homemade focaccia bread, you finally get a chance to read the menu, as well as hear the specials from your waiter. If you go, ask for Giorgio to give him your favorites on the menu (I wanted to record this guys voice as the new voice for Siri on my phone). He explains the menu in a way that makes you want to order everything! I finally settled for the grilled octopus and fennel salad as my appetizer and the black linguine with crabmeat, shrimps, and baby scallops as my entree. I'm a big seafood eater myself at these high end restaurants, but one of my guests ordered the homemade tagliatelle with sweet sausage and that was also simply to die for.I can really be here all day writing about how good this restaurant was, but I don't want to overhype the experience for you if you seem not to like it.

3.0,8/14/2017,"Hair in the bread - In the basket of breads that the server brought us, I found a hair in one of the cheesy bread. My boyfriend told the waiter, and the waiter only said sorry and took the bread away. He did not come back with another basket till at least 10 min later. Not saying I am looking for any remedy, just a simple sorry and long wait for a replacement basket of bread? I am sure there should be a better way to handle this situation.Mix of tap water with bottled still water - we ordered a bottle of still water, which sits in a ice bucket next to our table. The server  did not pay attention to that bottle, and poured tap water into our glasses half full with bottled water. Not saying this is a big issue, just something nice to be cautious of in the future.Unexpected Credit Card Not Accepted - in the middle of our meal, the machine for credit card payment is down. Some tables who were planning to pay with credit card had to go through their wallet and say if they had enough cash for it. Fortunately, they carried enough cash with them. If that happened to us who do not bring cash all the time, we may have to go find an ATM and get cash. Food - the portion is good for lunch; and the taste is alright, maybe I set the expectations to high, partially due to the fact that require credit card information when making the reservation and you may be charged for a fee if you don't cancel before sometime the day before the reservation.Conclusion - not what I expected, and may not recommend to my friends or come back myself.",1,0,0,Sharon S.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",0,7,1

All right, Sparks puts a beautiful crust on their meat, but Il Mulino gives you a Bordelaise or wine sauce to die for.

These were all before we even got our menu.We ordered a bottle of Montepulciano for the table, which was reasonably priced and very good.  We decided to share a few appetizers and each ordered a main.Appetizers:Caprese - very fresh, came with 3 pieces of tomato and 3 pieces of mozzarella 2 pastas, which they split up in the back for us and brought portions on a separate plates for us, which I love when restaurants do:Rigatoni Bolognese - this was deliciousCapellini all'Arrabbiatta - though I loved the thin pasta, I thought the dish was a little boring, it wasn't very spicy to meBy this point I was already almost full and we hadn't received our main courses yet.I ordered the veal parmigiana, which was gigantic.  I probably ate 1/5 of it before I tapped out and I took the rest home.Others at our table ordered a chicken dish (also huge), the filet mignon (included 2 huge pieces of steak), and the veal piccata (a normal size portion).Overall, we had a terrific time, the food was very good and the service fantastic, but I found the prices to be a bit much (though I did have leftovers and they do give you free appetizers).  I'm sure I'll be back eventually.",2,2,2,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,204,634

5.0,6/19/2017,"One of my absolute favorite Italian restaurants anywhere in the world.  I've been a few times now and can safely say it always delivers an exceptional dining experience.First, the setting: a small, dimly lit, intimate dining room with music just loud enough to carry a nice ambiance. Just the right size and sound for a meal meant to be shared with people who matter. Next, the staff: attentive, polite and funny; plus so well versed in the cuisine -- style, flavors, ingredients and how things are prepared.  Lastly, the food: in a word, SPECTACULAR.  The dining experience begins before you even see a menu, as they serve up quite a few delicious starters upon seating... fresh parmesan cheese, a basket of fresh breads, sautéed zucchini, sliced pepperoni, mussels, and they even threw in some complimentary meatballs because we asked about them.  Then we shared the Caprese - a few thick slices of a gorgeous buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes with balsamic drizzle, but also served with Prosciutto di Parma and fresh peppers (so goooooood). After that the mains, I ordered the Bucatini and my wife had the rack of lamb.  It was cooked perfectly and completely succulent.  We shared the coconut sorbet for dessert, which was amazing and washed it down with a glass of complimentary grappa and a glass of complimentary limoncello. The only slight knock on this fantastic place is the price. It is pretty expensive... hard to find a bottle of wine for under $100 and the rack of lamb entree was $80.  That said, you get what you pay for; so if you're not sweating the bill, this place is tough to beat for Italian cuisine.",0,0,0,Franke R.,"New York, NY",224,32,24

First, it's a very small restaurant and reservations can be hard to come by. Make sure you book at least a month out. My friend, being from NYC originally, told me about this place and just how divine the food is. Sometimes the anticipation is more exciting than the actual experience but thankfully this wasn't the case at Il Mulino. Located in the Village this is the original location and still the best according to my friend.  We had early reservations and was promptly seated. The lighting is dim and the ambiance has a romantic, intimate vibe. Tables are close together and space is tight. I can see why it can be hard to get a reservation here. Upon sitting down we were bestowed with an assortment of freshly grated parmigiano, bruschetta, and different cured meats. The bread basket alone was insanely good and we ate way more than we should have (we still have a running joke about that damn bread basket). Once you're halfway full on the delicious starters it's time to order dinner, and in my case another cocktail. For my selection I chose the thinly sliced veal rolled and stuffed with different cheeses. It was pan fried and had a delicious brown sauce (Marsala maybe?) and mushrooms on top. Absolutely delicious! The portion was huge and I ended up taking most of it home. My friend enjoyed his squid ink fettuccine but again took most of it to go. Not to be outdone we split a cannoli and holy hell was it delicious. Came with a variety of fresh fruit. This was some of the best Italian cuisine I've ever had. Everything from the ambiance, service, and the food was top shelf.",3,1,2,Kimberly D.,"San Antonio, TX",145,742,1578

1.0,2/25/2017,I am beginning to wonder if the only genuine reviews are the negative ones.  I startedeating at this restaurant 20 years ago.   Recently I had dinner there with my husband.The only thing about this restaurant that hasn't changed is the decor.  The wallpaperis the same drab pattern it was then.  My main dish was Languistino.  I don't knowif it was defrosted and tasted bad or if it was stale.  Either way it was $60 worth ofawful food with the most disgusting poor excuse for some heavily oiled rice andmushrooms in the middle.  I was praying that I wouldn't become sick from what I waseating.  My husband had the Veal which he said were disappointing.We shared the pasta Molino which was the only redeeming food we ate that night.  Wealso had Zablioni which was watery and weak with blueberries that were tasteless.This is the last time I will go to Il Mulino.

1.0,2/24/2017,"We went here for our anniversary. Things started off great, the appetizers and wine, delish. Then when we went to order our entrees my husband tried to order something that the table next to us got and our waiter said we couldn't have that because we were in his section and not the other section. We asked if it came from the same kitchen and he said yes but his section is having different specials. We didn't understand and wound up ordering something we didn't want. The waiter got defensive and angry with us for not understanding why one table can have something and we couldn't. We later tried to talk to someone else at the restaurant about it and then our waiter came over apologizing. He did give us dessert on the house but we were miffed. For the price, we should be able to order what we want if it is being made by the kitchen and offered somewhere else by a different waiter in the restaurant.

5.0,2/19/2017,"If I could sum this restaurant up in one word, it would be AMAZING. The experience begins as soon as you get seated. The waiters start buzzing all around you, plating fresh parmigiano, bruschetta, and cured meats on your plate. This is all free, by the way, and happens before you even see a menu. The service is fantastic. All the waiters and waitresses are Italian, and are as attentive as they get. The captain's enthusiasm for Italian food is palpable, and they go a long way to accommodate your preferences. For example, my boyfriend wanted a pasta and an entree, but thinking he wouldn't be able to finish both servings, asked if he could have a half portion of pasta. This wish was easily granted. I, on the other hand, took a liking to two pastas but couldn't choose which one, so the captain told me that he'd split the portions for me so I could try both! Thank god I could try both pastas, because they were amazing. In terms of food, I highly recommend the following: -Grilled octopus appetizer -Spaghettini carbonara -Spaghettini vongole -Scaloppine  -Ricotta cheesecake dessert The highlight of the show is definitely the carbonara and the scaloppine. I don't usually like carbonara, but this one has the perfect level of creaminess and flavor. The garlic in the vongole gives it depth that few Italian restaurants get right. The one thing about this restaurant is that you need to make reservations way in advance - it is packed every night! However, it is totally worth the wait!",2,0,0,Ha L.,"Manhattan, NY",572,23,15
5.0,2/7/2017,Had dinner this past Saturday night.  Service and food was great.   Drinks came out right away.  As soon as you sit there is a small plate of fried zucchini.  A little on the salty side.  Then they bring a garlicky (in a good way) bruschetta that was delicious.  Small thin slices of garlic bread and a chuck of Parmesan cheese was a nice start before even being given a menu.  I ordered two apps.  First came the seafood salad.  It was your traditional seafood salad which is oftentimes missed in restaurants.  Also often missed nowadays (but not here) is a half of lemon to squeeze over the salad.  All the fish was tender and cooked perfectly.  Next I had an app sized squid ink spaghetti cooked al dente with a spicy tomato garlic shrimp sauce.  I wish I had ordered another plate. For my entree I ordered the monkfish.  It was a huge piece of fish steamed in foil and covered with a vodka sauce and shrimp.   It was hard to finish but could not leave a bite behind.  No room for dessert.   Looking forward to going back there real soon!,0,0,0,Darren S.,"Huntington, NY",0,14,0

3.0,2/1/2017,"Il Mulino is a classic. When i was attending NYU, I used to come here all the time. It was one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Having not been back in years, I decided to revisit them once again and relive the memories. Unfortunately, much has changed. Although they still serve their usual freebies, the bruschetta was not what it used to be. It used to be much larger and tastier, and now it is super tiny and meh. The service is subpar. I dont know if it was just a super busy night, but the waiters were not very professional and it was impossible to get their attention, although there were many waiters all running around like chickens. One dropped the parmesan on my husband's lap at one point. It was just weird. The osso bucco was not very good and a big disappointment. It came with risotto on the side with also didnt say much. Their linguine vongole was also just okay. I remember it being so much better back in the day. Not sure if they changed their recipe.

4.0,1/5/2017,"After a really disappointing Italian experience in Queens I was really craving some good Italian food and service. I got the food; service not so much.The food here gets 5+ stars every time. The complimentary antipasti and starters just can't be beat. You get bread, bruschetta, hunks of fresh parmesan, eggplant, mussels...(am I missing something? probably) before you even order your meal. I could make a meal out of the bruschetta and parmesan alone. Bread, tomatoes, cheese and maybe some meat--a true Italian-American's dream.My husband and I shared the prosciutto wrapped melon as a starter. It's as good as it gets here in the states. The price might throw you slightly; $23 seems a lot. Rest assured you could easily split this starter with 3 people. Everything is served family style.For an entree I had the best spaghetti all'Arrabbiata I've ever had in my life. What do they put in that sauce?? I assume some basil, but something else--flavored oil maybe? Whatever it is it's magic. The pasta is perfectly al dente and the sauce is just magic. My husband had the salmon special, which was also delicious, but not magic-level like my spaghetti.After a family-style meal we had no room for dessert. The complimentary grappa is a sweet touch if you like it.I had to take a star off for the service. The guy was like a robot, and it wasn't just with us--we noticed him rapid-fire spitting out the specials to the tables around us. Asking for anything (menus to look at, soda, etc.) seemed to throw him off his game, and he certainly didn't like us taking an extra minute to take a photo at the end of the meal. Luckily the magic of the food can't be soured even by an uninspired, bored waiter.",2,2,1,Christina C.,"New York, NY",84,74,7

The decor is old school Italian--the wallpaper is straight out of a movie and there boxes of wine stacked by the entrance.  The waiters are all dressed in tuxedos, and the service is excellent. For an appetizer, I had the buffalo mozzarella, which was incredible. You could tell that the mozzarella and tomatoes were fresh and prosciutto was to die for. For the entree, I went with the squid ink linguine, which did not disappoint. The amount of seafood for a dish like this was impressive--there is a healthy portion of scallops and shrimp. Some restaurants will short you on seafood in a dish like this, but there were plenty of scallops and shrimp for each bit. I also tried the truffle ravioli and think that this will be what I get if I return. Each piece of the ravioli is incredibly rich, almost like a meal in a bite. The waiter also mentioned that this was his favorite dish, and I could see why. The dessert was good (the waiter brought out a variety platter for our table that included cheesecake, chocolate cake, and tiramisu). Overall, this is a great spot for some authentic Italian.

I am simply trying too inform you of what an incredibly awful experience we had at Il Mulino Downtown.As you can see I am in the Industry, and you could argue that as such I may be more sensitive to certain aspects of fine dining, however the rest of the party (clients and partners of ours) are not, and where equally distraught. We did not comment to the staff out of embarrassment. If not me, certainly our guests are quite important to us, and to the corporate and legal fields...but that is not the point.First on the ambiance side you seriously need air conditioning at your venue.The Service was lacking on attention and finesse, dishes where served to the wrong people, then exchanged and eventually auctioned. Surprisingly it seems your staff could not even manage to get all the dishes into the table at the same time resulting on embarrassing wait times. Ordered bottles of wine where ""forgotten"" until pointed out, and then left on the table unopened while until we again pointed it out after the main courses had been served. When the bottle arrived it was placed on the table and the gentleman just said...here you have , Sangiovese, our last bottle 50 bucks and it's all yours.  No presentation, no maker, nothing.Within the list of special a Lamb special was listed. at ordering I ordered an appetizer, like everyone else, and the Lamb for me.  At no point where was I advised the Lamb was a rack of Lamb for four people, so although I was the last to order and everyone had an entree the server took my order. It was a surprise to be served on an individual plate a Rack of Lamb that size. I should expect some clarification when ordering. But I suppose that's your policy.Your staff has the nasty habit of pushing sparkling and bottled water without being asked, one bottle after another and another to rake up the check.  A practice that I am familiar with in lesser establishments but never expected of yours.Your staff was meeting on the actual floor, disbursing cash tips, counting their money and joking around....this was at around 10:15PMYour staff changed into street clothes, which is fine, and then stayed on the floor talking to other servers on their t-shirts and have worn uniforms...given that several tables of costumers where quite well dressed and still eating I find this disconcerting and rude.A member of the party asked for a dessert to be brought for a birthday at the end of dinner...it was forgotten and only the check was dropped. Not even dessert menus where given although we where asked if we wanted coffee.I expect this will be a surprise to you, it certainly was to us.  As stated I need no follow up, do with this information as you will.

You know that you're in for a great night when the staff is all Italian and within seconds you have free food on the table. Il Mulino is the type of spot where you are shelling out a bit of cash, but you end up feeling like such a VIP that it is worth it.Not only does Il Mulino start your night with typical bread and olive oil - they also brought out delicious parmesan cheese, garlic zucchini and a few other bites.Our server was so much fun and took great care of us - his presentation of the specials had us all laughing because he was so enthusiastic and playful. He ultimately took the wheel for the appetizers and just brought out a spread of his favorites.Out of the starters the burrata with prosciutto and sun-dried tomato was a must try.I get a bit nervous at Italian restaurants trying to find gluten free options, but they were able to substitute GF pasta with any sauce that I liked. I ultimately got a delicious gluten free spaghetti with alfredo sauce, grilled chicken and sweet peas - yum.The portions were huuuuge so I had lunch for the next day - although it definitely was more delicious before reheating. Next time I'd maybe lay off the starters to leave more room for pasta!Plus the after dinner drink was a great touch as well. Not cheap, so mostly a great place to check out when my parents are covering the bill, but the quality is top notch - and the extra special treatment is worth it.",0,1,0,Deanna A.,"Buffalo, NY",543,119,59

4.0,6/13/2016,"Old school, old world, steady, consistent, tried and true IL Molino is a benchmark classic Italian restaurant much like The Old Homestead is a classic steak house. The minute you walk into (this downtown) Il Molino you can pretty much guess what's going to be on the menu - traditional Italian food with no frou frou pretense or celebrity chef flare. This is a welcomed relief in this time of flavor of the month signature chefs who try and reinvent the wheel. IL Molino gets the fact that chicken parmigiana is simply that - chicken parmigiana. Our large party of eight was treated to so many appetizers and pastas I couldn't possibly name them all but all were fantastic.My main which was veal piccata was huge and fantastic. The wines were great and the service was better.With soooooooo many really good restaurants in New York, it's always nice to come to a ""Steady Eddie"" place that just reeks of the ""New York"" thing, i.e. tuxedo'd waiters and white table cloths and red sauce pouring out of every dish imaginable.I loved this place!",0,0,0,Sidney Z.,"Encino, CA",105,473,5

4.0,5/5/2016,"I'll divide this review. 5 stars for the food. Our appetizers were delicious, especially the zucchini and chunks of cheese provided by the restaurant. Our entrees were also very good including the grilled fish choices and chicken scarpiello. The service is friendly and professional and I would give it 5 stars as well. But... I was very disappointed the way the specials were presented and priced. I know that Il Mulino is going to be a fairly expensive outing. The entrees are generally priced between 30-$45 and that's fine. However, two of us ordered fish from the specials described to us. The filet of sole was a huge portion and quite tasty as was the grilled branzino. But it wasn't until the check came that I realized those dishes cost $75 & $65. So 3 Stars for transparency.I believe that a restaurant owes it to their diners to reveal pricing on the specials if it differs significantly from their regular menu. (It's awkward to have to ask ""And how much is that?"". I won't do it! ) It would have been in our best interest had the friendly staff member explained that the special portions were large, priced as such and might be easily shared. They didn't do that and I was left with a bad memory following a fine dining experience. I didn't know this, but now YOU do!",0,0,0,Al Z.,"West Babylon, NY",0,16,0

I  have been here many times but recently took good friends from England for a Friday lunch. They literally took pictures of their servings and are still raving to me about the food.

5.0,4/29/2016,"Game changer. Thank you for yelp for introducing me to this insanely delicious italian restaurant. My friend and I were giggling happily and uncontrollably at all of the amenities they offered us once you sit down. This is most likely viewed as a special occasion type place for most because of the high level of service and prices, but if you feel like going crazy on a Tuesday like we did, I would recommend choosing Il Mulino. We were immediately offered grilled zucchini, salami, garlic bread and fresh bread (5-6 options or so) and fresh sliced parmesan. This was all before we barely looked at the menu. I ordered the spaghettini and clams - pasta and clams were perfectly cooked and so fresh. My friend got the salmon and it was also perfectly cooked and flavored. We also split the flourless chocolate cake dessert - we texted each other the next day saying that we had dreams about it...need I say more.One thing I loved - NO rush. Albeit we came in on a Tuesday night, but the wait staff knew we were there to chat and catch up and gave us plenty of time to do so without constantly asking where we were at.I'd recommend this place for ANY special occasion, a date you want to really impress, or if you are just craving perfectly cooked italian food and can afford a little decadence in your life every now in then.",1,0,2,Kristine G.,"Massapequa, NY",34,34,3

3.0,4/1/2016,"4 stars for service and 3 stars for food. I hadn't been here in 5 years and wanted to give it another try and found the food to be somewhat average. At least it was that night. The 3 pasta sampler of ravioli, Pappardelle and a third one I don't recall was only okay. My old favorite of Veal Piccata wasn't as memorable as it has been in the past. The sauce was of a thinner and more soupy consistency, not thick and buttery and lemony as I have come to expect. Even the pre-dinner bites were not the same; some were stale, cold and oily. At least the Tiramisu was still great. Perhaps the main chef was out due to Easter break. This was my fifth time at this location and I don't know if I would return for a sixth.

3.0,3/10/2016,"I ate here two nights ago and have revisited this dinner a few times in my head since then.  It's the experience that you are led to believe is going to be magnificent, but walk away from disappointed and confused.  To start, the bar area/coat check area/odd plating of certain dishes area is very small and fills up quickly with patrons waiting for tables.  I can understand that they do not seat patrons until the entire party has arrived, but if that's the case then they should make the bar area just a bit more comfortable for the folks to wait in.  All of the seats at the bar were taken so I was stuck standing in the middle of the pathway between the coat check and the hot plate station.  I was almost tempted to just wait outside.  I don't fully hold this against them because had my guest not been late I would have never experienced the bar area.  The dining room was full, as expected for 6PM and while I did not find myself bumping elbows with anyone, the atmosphere still felt noisy and congested.  There are a plethora of servers bustling about, and people coming and going from their tables.  There are some plates of amuse bouche and assorted breads on the table.  One of the breads was oily and hard as a rock.  Just a warning to those who might have fragile teeth.  The wait staff were very friendly and helpful, but throughout the night moved so quickly that everything felt rushed.  The head waiter, or captain dropped the menus and then within 10 seconds was back again asking if we were ready to order.  I was surprised that there was no sommelier on the staff.  I could tell that my waiter had no idea what the difference was between two bottles of wine I had suggested for dinner.  He then went on to say ""both are very good.""  We started with the Carciofini Romana and Beef Carpaccio appetizer dishes.  The artichokes were nicely cooked and in a light sauce that was pleasant and satisfying.  The carpaccio on the other hand was disappointing in quality of meat and drowned in a mustard like sauce that took away any bits of flavor in the meat.  Before the main course we sampled the lobster ravioli special which was nicely done.  Just before the main courses came out I asked one of the wait staff for some clean plates and those were never brought to the table.  The entrees arrived and that was that.  The Veal Valdostana was very tender and flavorful, but heavy on the cheese.  Definitely a filling and satisfying dish, but missing the wow factor.  Finally when presented with the check I noticed that there is an option to tip both the captain and the wait staff.  Our captain did not introduce himself as such and I had to ask one of the passing wait staff who this was.  I feel everyone helped out equally and that this is unfair to the wait staff.  This is simply my opinion though.  Overall I left Il Mulino disappointed.  I really did want to like it and I know this review is in the minority, but there were just too many factors that pointed our experience in the opposite direction.",6,1,1,Jeff H.,"New York, NY",124,418,153

Everyone has described the mountains of pre-appetizers at the beginning. They are as delightful as others have said, especially the hunk of Parmesan. I have dreams about that cheese.The actual starters are also delicious, especially the scallops wrapped in bacon. OMFG. Words can't describe how perfect these are. Order them. Mains, as you would expect, are also fantastic, and I love the option to try several different pasta dishes as one meal. When a meal out costs close to $200 per head, I just can't give the establishment 5 stars in good faith. The food is great here, and the service is too. But the markups on some of the items are literally eye popping. Let's just say it's a good thing they don't tell you the prices of the verbal specials.

We were seated promptly for our 8:00 reservation, at a nice table, and were given the wine list to peruse. Right away the appetizers started arriving, which I knew about, but which my husband was not expecting, so it was a great surprise for him. The zucchini fritti was to die for! The bread basket, mussel, bruschetta, and garlic toasts were all divine. And of course, the huge parmesan wheel they carve for you. We didn't feel rushed to order, and our server gave us time to look over the menu after reciting a long (I mean really long) list of specials. We decided to split the arrabiata pasta and the rack of lamb, which is my husband's favorite, and why I chose Il Mulino for his birthday. The pasta course was excellent. They split the dish into two bowls, each of which was a generous serving on its own, and we didn't feel rushed at all, with just enough time between courses before they presented the rack of lamb uncarved, and then carved it for us. The meat was cooked perfectly, and we really enjoyed it. Finally, even though we were stuffed at this point, we got the flourless chocolate cake, which comes with fresh whipped cream. It was fantastic! And the best part was that they brought it over with a candle, and several waiters sang happy birthday, while the whole restaurant clapped.

2.0,2/5/2016,"This review is a little late but I felt compelled to write it anyway. My girlfriend and I had been wanting to go to Il Mulino for a few years due to its reputation. I took her here for her birthday a few months ago and we're very excited to finally try it. Too bad it was such a disappointment. The ambiance is nice I suppose, however they keep it so ridiculously dark inside that you can barely see the person you're eating with (let alone trying to read the menu with its over the top cursive font). They start out by giving you a good selection of bread, a few slices of soppresata, and chunks of parmiggiano reggiano (This may have been our favorite part of the experience). For appetizers, my girlfriend ordered the stracciatella soup. It was okay but certainly not worth the high cost for a very basic soup. I had the beef carpaccio which was sort of disappointing...the quality of the beef just wasn't that spectacular and it came drizzled in a creamy mustard sauce that basically stole (or masked?) all the flavor of the meat. The menu said nothing about this mustard sauce but I didn't want to be difficult as it was my gf's birthday. She had the spaghetti carbonara as an entree which was prepared very well. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo (not very adventurous I know, but I was in the mood for it). It came out loaded with so many mushrooms that it actually turned the sauce a light shade of grey (which I needed my phone flashlight to see, because you know, its pitch black). Since I don't hate mushrooms I once again didn't make a fuss, however they overwhelmed the dish so much it was like eating fettuccine in a creamy mushroom sauce. Not at all what I was in the mood for. If you want to put your own ""spin"" on a very basic, traditional dish, at least advertise that you've essentially reinvented it. Probably the worst part of the whole experience was the fact that the staff neglected to acknowledge my girlfriend's birthday! I had made the reservation a week in advance and specifically mentioned we were celebrating her birthday...imagine how shocked I was when the meal came to an end without anyone coming over to sing or produce a tiny friggen piece of cake with a candle in it. After the waiter literally brought over our check without even asking if we wanted it, I had to storm to the front of the restaurant and explain to the hostess how F'd up it was that no one acknowledged her birthday. We had to listen to at least 3 or 4 different people being sung happy birthday to, and we got nothing. The hostess was apologetic but frankly that didn't make up for anything. After that brief exchange a lone waiter finally approached us with a tiny piece of cake with a candle and muttered a quick ""happy birthday"" before walking away. Truly unbelievable. Bottom line, this place is way overpriced and the elegant uniforms worn by the staff do not make up for their mediocre performance.

2.0,2/4/2016,"Short version: service was too rushed, meat quality was mediocre, sauces and desserts were great, but the ambiance could use decor updates.I made a 12pm lunch reservation during restaurant week, arrived on time with my full party and was seated immediately.We were given wine menus and asked if we were ordering wine- it was lunch so we declined wine and asked for water.  There was something odd about having to ask for water and not having water served to us before asking about wine.Then a flurry of hands laid down restaurant week menus, a basket of breads, a plate of fried zucchini slices, two slices of salami, and some diced tomato salad with crouton on our plates.  Unfortunately one of the cheese breads served was so hard I thought it would pull my teeth out by biting into it- but all the other amuse bouche were great.Before we could even comprehend what had just happened, we were asked if we were ready to order, which we weren't.  We were literally only 3 minutes into sitting down and saying hello to each other.  About every 2 minutes after that we were asked if we were ready to order until we decided to give up having a conversation and just order in the hopes that would help us have an interrupted conversation.We both ordered a penne arrabiatta starter and chicken entree.  The food came out quickly, the sauces were very delicious with plenty of flavor and spice, and the pasta was great.  The only problem was that we barely had time to enjoy it because 3 different servers tried to take our plates before we were even finished!  After the third attempt we just gave up and let them take it.The chicken cuts and meatballs that were part of this special entree were merely edible- not the highest quality cuts of meat with many fatty or chewy parts.  The sauce was good- but I'll never order that chicken dish again and I was tempted to send it back because it was so undesirable.  Instead I just let the over-eager servers take that before it was finished as well.The only time I felt like we got to relax and enjoy our meal was during dessert- when they had no more reason to rush us along.  The flourless chocolate cake was amazing and the tiramisu was like a tasty cloud of air.I really wanted to enjoy my meal here- but the pressure to keep moving forward during our meal really ruined that for me and overshadowed any of the experience that was desirable. Honestly- I don't know if I'll come back to give it a second chance.  I'm curious to see if it's any better for the evening service- but the entree didn't make me thrilled to come back either.  I'm a very high rater- so it pains me to give a low rating but I think there are a lot of improvements that could be made here, especially considering how many other amazing Italian dinner options there are in a few blocks walk.",4,0,1,Anne R.,"New York, NY",845,460,5492

4.0,1/19/2016,"We went to Il Mulino on a Monday during restaurant week.  We ran in to the restaurant at 1:19 for a 1:15 reservation and the waiting area was packed.  We checked our jackets (you want to do this on busy days - the dining area is tiny) and waited.We were seated at 1:45.  After being showed to our table, little appetizers started showing up.  They gave us a basket of soft and garlic breads, fresh Parmesan cheese bits, bruschetta, and zucchini chips - all absolutely fantastic and a welcomed surprise.  Everything was very garlicky but quite flavorful and well constructed.  For our meal, we ordered two apps, two entrees, and two desserts, per the restaurant week menu (I am attaching a screenshot of the full menu):CAPRESE SALAD - One slice of mozzarella, two slices of tomato.  The mozzarella is extremely fresh and creamy.  Excellent dish.  PENNE ALLA ARRABBIATA - Al dente pasta in a spicy, chunky red sauce.  Another excellent dish and a reasonable portion for an appetizer.  SALMON - The salmon entree came with capers, olives, and tomatoes in a red sauce.  The portion was also quite big, being that RW lunch is $25 for 3 courses.  CHICKEN - Similar fixings to the salmon, with zucchini as well.  Didn't love this as much as it was a slightly fatty cut of chicken, but still had great flavors.  FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE - Very chocolatey/heavy (essentially fudge); comes with some sort of whipped cream and some fresh blueberries and raspberries.TIRAMISU - Also a hit.  Same fixings as the chocolate cake.  Very light and airy.  The food was extremely good and I was very happy with it.  The only issues that we had were being seated a little late, generally being rushed (although, with the restaurant week crowd, this is what we expected), and how the servers treated each other.Let me explain myself on that part.  It was a little uncomfortable to sit back and enjoy lunch with the head server speaking rudely to the other servers and the bussers.  Being in a hurry and being direct are one thing, but the way they were being spoken to was uncomfortable to watch.  Additionally, the check had both a line for the servers tip and the captains tip.  During restaurant week, a lot of young people come out to try restaurants that they otherwise may not be able to afford every day.  No one made an effort to explain to us who was who or how the breakdown worked.  While we would have been happy to compensate someone, we were unsure who the captain even was.  It made us feel a little awkward because we had no clue how much to leave each person.All in all, it was a good experience.  I think that if there had been a little more teamwork on the staff, this could have been a five star review.  The $25 lunch special for restaurant week is an absolute steal for this place.  Highly recommend.",4,1,0,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",285,134,933

I cannot provide a review of the food, however, as we left the restaurant before being seated. My partner and I arrived right on time for our reservation. After pushing our way up to the host, we were told he would have a table for us soon. We waited patiently. The next time we asked how things were looking he told us that he was having a wonderful evening...nothing about our table. The third time we inquired, he did not respond, but instead pointed his finger right past my partner's face and pointed at a couple standing behind us who had arrived after us, thoughtfully enunciated every syllable of their Italian last name, and showed them to their table. I will mention that this point that my partner is not white. When we later inquired about the open table for two right next to the couple who had recently been seated we were again brushed off. Eventually we got quite aggravated, prompting the host to tell my partner that if he was nice to the host, the host would be nice to him, or we could leave. We chose to leave. I will never return.

Dessert was $18 for 2 thin slices of chocolate cake. If the place had a stunning ambiance it would be easier to swallow those padded charges, but the restaurant's interior is tired and cramped.

Absolutely the best Veal dish I've had. For dessert we ordered the chocolate cake and a cappuccino which looked like a dessert in itself. Still not done.

I did also appreciate the waiter bringing the huge block of Parmesan to the table to carve some off for you! For my appetizer I had the pappardelle, which was delicious, 5/5 for this dish! My husband had calamari, which he really enjoyed. For our main dishes my husband had the veal Marsala and I chose the chicken. The mains were fine, but nothing special. It was our least favorite of all courses. However, unless restricted to the fixed menu, I wouldn't have ordered any of those dishes anyway. For dessert we both ordered the chocolate cake, which was very good, it was rich and tasty. The presentation wasn't too great and I think it was because we saw them stood out by the hostess table! Our only complaint was the time it took to get the cheque. All service was prompt and efficient until that point. The decor of the restaurant is quite traditional and the bathrooms are very dated, but those things are minor to me. However, there is only 1 female & 1 male bathroom, so you could wait a while.

4.0,8/11/2015,"KenScale: 8.5/10It's been more than a couple of years since I last visited Il Mulino, a classy Italian establishment in NYC at somewhat odd location in the heart of NYU campus. I've been looking to re-visit and finally had a chance recently. Overall, the rich flavor of Italian cuisine was still there, and I might say Il Mulino might be one of the best places for pasta in the city.After the usual servings of complementary food, we shared three different pastas: black truffle ravioli, pappardelle and spicy sauce capellini. All three dishes were exquisite, especially the ravioli, which my dining companions couldn't stop raving about. There was rich flavor to each pasta dish that was very addictive, and the texture of each noodle was also flawless. While I've been saying for a long time that Marea is the standard-bearer when it comes to pastas, I think Il Mulino is not that far behind in terms of overall construction of the dishes and the balance of flavor and texture. For main dishes, I absolutely loved the dover sole, which came perfectly cooked and with minimal seasoning to my liking. I always find fish dishes that are seasoned on the moderate side to taste better (assuming they are cooked well), and dover sole really was just to my liking. On the other hand, veal parmigiana was a bit aggressively overseasoned and the meat was slightly tough. For desserts, both the silky smooth tiramisu and the tartufo gelato were pure decadence, showing how classic Italian sweet treats are done right.Getting a reservation here is still a bit hard, and it was pretty packed in the course of my meal. There are some really nice Italian wine selections to go along with the intense and rich flavor of dishes here.

The only acknowledgment of it was that they brought over a bottle of club soda. Extraordinarily bad form.- We were rushed the entire time. However, when I arrived the maitre d made me wait for several minutes while schmoozing with another patron on his way out.

For the civilian, this rabbit hole is one that you're better off not lunging into, as the journey ahead is riddled with heartbreak, financial burden, and cholesterol. At least that's what I'd tell myself, if there was any chance I'd actually listen.     I've spent many a lonely night scouring the web, reading reviews and zooming in on pictures of breaded chicken bathed in tomato sauce and veiled with cheese. Visual imagery paired with the resounding praise of Yelpers led me to a place nearby. Ensconced in the drunken melee of NYU's de facto campus resides a stalwart of Italian-American cuisine- a ristorante long touted as one of NYC's finest- il Mulino.    That day, work had me going right to the very end of a white-knuckled shift. Leaving a shitshow in my wake, I hopped in a cab and headed downtown. Chicken parm heavy on the mind as the taxi barreled down 5th Ave.      I finally arrived at 945 for the 930 reservation and my lovely wife was already seated with two glasses of Montepulciano. Despite its bohemian address, I'd heard about il Mulino's old-school rep and figured proper attire would be the mandated vogue. I rolled up in my tattered, semi-homeless looking garb and, needless to say, was not dressed the part. With my RN badge still dangling from my neck, I explained that an emergency arose at work and did not have time to change. The maitre d would have been well within his rights to look me up and down, raise his snout to the air, and shoe me back to the unsavory streets from which I came. Rather, he placed his hand on my shoulder, cordially made note of the dress code, told me not to worry, and politely asked if I'd mind donning a pair of scrub pants over my jean shorts. Complying and having met the dress code at its bare minimum, I was ushered to my table and told to relax and enjoy.      Veiled mysteriously behind the opaque curtains on the front windows, the restaurant's interior was equal parts modest and upscale and lightly accentuated with elements of typical Italian kitsch (a dividing wall erected out of empty wine crates, antiquated wallpaper you'd find in the unused living room of your nonna's house where the ""good"" furniture is covered in clear plastic, etc.). The service was classic and executed with practiced perfection, harkening back to a time when white tablecloths and well-informed servers were the mark of quality. In an age where most tables are tended by apathetic college kids on summer break and hipsters who come to work in the clothes they woke up in, these waiters were of the elite pedigree of servers who make a healthy living on the virtue of their craft. Without ordering anything, our table was somehow fully populated with food. Going way beyond the call of an amuse-bouche's duty, glacial chunks of parmigiano reggiano, a mountain of fried zucchini, a cascade of sliced pepperoni, a basket brimming with assorted breads, and mussels sautéed with garlic and diced tomatoes were all delivered gratis. One could have easily fashioned a delicious and satiating meal on the strength of this complimentary cuff. The menu was both concise and comprehensive in touching upon all the classics and was supplemented by an extensive selection of specials. One of the best things about marriage surfaces when dining out, where one is spared the agony of indecisiveness and afforded the luxury of ordering multiple dishes with the intent of splitting everything. We ordered the antipasto of mutz di buff with prosciutto, roasted peppers, sun dried tomatoes, and capers, which was as amazing as one would expect. For the entrees, we hardly ventured from familiarity, opting for the filet mignon with a red wine reduction and the $38 chicken parm. (Sorry Carbone, this place invented the overpriced red sauce dish.) The steak dish was bountiful, rendering easily over 1lb of tenderloin, but what it boasted in size it lacked in taste. Ultimately, meh. The chicken parm was friggin' phenomenal. Employing a French cut chicken breast (with the bone left in, pointing upwards to the heavens) that was pounded to kingdom come, breaded, and topped with marinara and melted cheese, the resulting dish was an amazing gestalt. The skeptic in me is too reserved to deem it the best chicken parm ever, but I'll definitely include it in the conversation. For dessert, we opted for the tiramisu, which I usually don't care for, but was made a believer after the first bite.      Overall, I'd have to recommend this place. It's earned its distinction as an institution in a city where you can skip a rock and hit ten Italian restaurants. How? By working tirelessly to perfect the simple things....",1,0,0,Mike A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,2

The service was great as usual, but the food was just superior and the atmosphere being small and intimate was amazing.

5.0,5/20/2015,"Wow! I came here on my birthday with my family. One thing that you should know about them is that they love Italian food, but are extremely critical of every restaurant that we go to. So imagine my surprise when my parents said that this was one of the best and most memorable meals that they had enjoyed in a long time.Once you sit down, the attentive waiter asks if you want anything to drink, and an army of servers swoops down to deliver a multitude of free antipasti - garlic bread, fried zucchini, bruschetta. Then the tuxedo-ed waiter returns, and delivers a delightfully theatrical recitation of the night's specials and recommendations. Maybe bring a pen and paper, because there are a lot of them. We went with the calamari fritti to share and a few caesar salads to start. The calamari was fresh and fried perfectly, not too chewy, oily or heavy. The caesar was interesting, definitely less vinegary and more rich than I was used to, and not too much of an anchovy flavor. The lettuce could have been a little crisper, so maybe you can skip this one.I ordered the spaghetti vongole as my main, and wow! I normally prefer red clam sauce to white, but this one was very garlicky, herby and I detected some kind of strong umami flavor, like anchovy or sundried tomato. It came with plenty of large and small clams, and finished with a little cayenne pepper for a kick.The black linguine with shrimp and scallops was also a big hit. My dad said it was the best pasta that he'd had in awhile. He never likes what he orders at restaurants, so this is unbelievably high praise. We also enjoyed the lobster linguine special - it came in a rich, pink sauce. The person who ordered it couldn't quite finish, as it was very heavy. For me, one bite was enough.We were so stuffed that dessert was out of the question, but now I wish I had had some room for a bite of tiramisu.

1.0,3/20/2015,"We have been going to this restaurant for 15 or more years. It used to be our favorite Italian restaurant in the city. Slowly but surely It has been going downhill since it was sold to a restaurant group a few years ago.This will be our last time going... Tonight my wife and I went there for my birthday and the service was not good at all. The complementary appetizer selection has shrunk. When they bring them to your table they throw them down like your in a low rent diner. They bread is terribly greasy and the mussels were cold and mealy. We ordered a very nice bottle of wine and when it was brought to the table they brought the wrong year (a much later year and definitely not worth the high price they were selling it for) and never mentioned that it was not the year on their menu. I pointed it out to them and the waiter played dumb and asked me if I still wanted it. I said no and ordered a different one. In my opinion it was very sneaky. I very specifically ordered the rack of lamb with no sauce. The lamb was brought to the table drenched with sauce. When I asked another member of the staff for our waiter it took 10 minutes for him to show up. When he did finally arrive, he took the lamb without any hint of an apology and came back 5 minutes later with the same plate without the puddle of sauce. Again without an apology. I told him that I did not want the lamb with sauce and that it was still covered with it. He still offered no apology what so ever. I told him that I did not want it anymore. He never asked if I wanted anything else nor did the maitre d ever show up at the table to offer an apology.  Nothing!  The maitre d was too busy having a conversation with a buddy of his at the bar, completely oblivious to what was going on in his restaurant. We felt completely slighted. When my wife finished her dish the waiter then asked if we wanted dessert and coffee (which kind of made me laugh die to his complete ignorance). I asked for the check.  Only the lamb was taken off of the check. Nothing else. Not even the side dish I ordered. At the prices they charge it is truly an outrage.  We had been loyal customers for 20+ years. Our typical bill was between $300-$500 for a meal. Not even a simple acknowledgment or apology. Bad bad form. Il Mulino has become a bad tourist trap hoping its preexisting reputation will continue to sustain the business it once did without the same stellar service and food it once churned out.

2.0,2/27/2015,"Went for Restauran Week lunch for 2. Both the experience and the food weren't good at all!1. Menu selection - FAILI specifically chose that restaurant because their website had outstanding lunch Restaurant Week menu (their dinner menu was ""meh"" for me). When we finally got seated (see #3), they gave us the ""meh"" **DINNER** menu, and said that having different lunch menu on website was a ""mistake"". 2. Food - Poor to subpar.- They started with on-the-house bruschetta. OK, it's ""free"". But it was awful - frozen (clearly made couple hours ago) tomatos drowning soggy crappy toast.- Soup was meh. Not bad but what do you expect from lentil soup.- Since the RW menu wasn't there, I opted to order regular non-RW menu carpaccio, that cost the same $25 as RW bill. It was VERY VERY small (for $25 you get extremely miniscule amount of meat), not very tasty, AND drowning in strong mustard. Hell, if you have good meat quality, don't destroy it with spicy sauce!- My lunch companion ordered some sort of pasta with potatoes. Truly epically meh. I'd pay $5 for that at a diner, not $25 at a premium restaurant.3. Service - AWFUL. I have arrived **15 minutes early**.Despite that, when my lunch partner arrived on time, I was told it would take ""several minutes"" to seat us. Which in reality turned out to be over half an hour. Then, we had to wait extremely long for both the menu, AND for our food. Getting a waiter's attention was impossible.In total, small lunch took us nearly 2 hours, and even that only because we wised up and asked for a check together with dessert.Additional service problem: we ordered pineapple juice, no-ice (this being frozen NY February).

Felt like you were having dinner in a quaint little Italian restaurant IN Italy. I can definitely see why this restaurant is popular.Came here for dinner and was a little confused at first as you are greeted with a whirlwind of fried zucchini, fresh bruschetta, chunk of parmesan, salami, mussel, bread basket and fresh warm cheesy garlic bread. Finally, after this parade of appetizers, we were told the specials by our lovely and authentic Italian waiter (be prepared, the specials list is as long as some restaurant's entire menus so listen carefully!)Ordered the caesar salad off the normal menu. It was decent, sauce was not too creamy and the croutons were perfectly textured and garlicky. I thought it could use a little more kick like the one at Carbone which is by far my favorite. My friend had the buffalo mozzarella special (which was $26!) and looked like it was good.For my main I settled on the seafood squid ink linguini off the specials list which was excellent. Exactly what I expected. The tiny scallops (forget what they are called) were a little fishy but I know that they just are that way. Loved the fresh tomatoes (which also helped with the fishiness). Pasta was the perfect texture and taste. My friend got the pappardelle in tomato sauce with sausage and she said it was also good. Table over had the branzino which looked quite epic.Shared a lemon sorbet for dessert and found it a bit sweet. I like my sorbet more tart.As is always my complaint, the food was heavily salted so I left feeling quite bloated.Service was attentive in that I practically never had a partially full glass of water and the dishes were always cleared immediately.

4.0,2/7/2015,"In the midst of following the latest and greatest openings in NYC, it's important not to overlook some of the classics. Il Mulino is certainly one of the city's most quintessential restaurants, a steadfast Italian eatery that has served up countless plates since its opening in 1981. Even to this day, reservations are nearly impossible to obtain, unless, perhaps, you're a regular or know the right people. And certainly, the lunchtime visit by Bill Clinton and President Obama several years back only helped to boost their reputation. But on those days that you need a break from the modern dining regime, Il Mulino is a welcome respite.My friend and I arrived for dinner on the early end of a Sunday dinner. From the moment I stepped in, I was immediately greeted, checked in, and led to our table. Even before our water glasses could be filled, our table was covered in a variety of starting bites, including a well-marinated bruschetta, a garlicky mussel, and a small plate with various cuts of salami, and a basket nearly overflowing with bread. It's certainly a surprising welcome, and an instantaneous way of making the guest feel at home from they moment they sit down. We barely had room on the table to place our menus, but after hearing the specials available that evening, opted to share a three course meal.First to arrive was the Caesar Salad. It's a simple plate by any definition, consisting of romaine lettuce, Caesar dressing, Parmesan, and the optional handful of croutons. Il Mulino's version, despite utilizing quality ingredients, was heavily dressed to the point that it became far too salty. It caused the romaine leaves to wilt with the heaviness of the dressing as well, and unfortunately, did not start us off on quite the right foot. Thankfully, the Squid Ink Linguine that followed was a much better plate. It was one of the specials that our waiter had read out to us, and it certainly lived up to the description. The squid ink linguine was cooked to a toothsome al dente and sautéed with shrimp, scallops and cherry tomatoes, resulting in light and distinct flavors. The clarity of the olive oil and garlic was also exemplary, a true testament to the roots of Italian cuisine. We'd opted for the Scaloppine Pizzaiola, a dish that served veal in a rich tomato sauce with mushrooms in peppers. The veal was surprisingly tender, quite a feat given the leanness of the protein, and the accompanying sauce was a perfect blend of earthy, tart, and savory. A few capers thrown in made for a salty staccato in between bites, but our plates were nonetheless cleaned in short time. But how could we say no to dessert, especially when our waiter was so persuasive? I ended up with a Tiramisu, a delightfully moist slice of coffee-infused ladyfingers, marscapone, cocoa powder, and the sweet edge of Kahlua.Il Mulino doesn't have to be quite as damaging to the wallet as one might assume, although I'd advise against getting more than one dessert, as each clocks in at an impressive $18 - a price we didn't see until the final bill. Stick with the Italian classics listed across their menu and opt to share, if possible; portions are generous, and will fill you up otherwise. And while the restaurant may not be perfect, tasty plates, warm service, and a chance to step back in time are more than enough reasons to make the visit here.",11,5,7,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

Let's have a seat and see what waters will wash away our funds. I was a vegetarian at the time and had a hard time ordering from the menu. The 007 Mediterranean heartthrob suggested the saffron pasta. I hesitated because it is customary I don't order pasta at restaurants. I had never had saffron so I accepted... it would come with vegetables! He informed me it was the finest of all pastas. My date ordered the usual calamari his choices always satisfy him. On first bite of my pasta (after the first disappointed look at it) saffron is to ipecac as metallic flavor is to yellowness as al dente is to not how I like my pasta! Swish swish of the activity all around us...now for $30 dessert!: A poached pear...the only thing memorable for its flavor and price. Goodbye little windmill.

We came for restaurant week to give it a whirl for lunch. The food was astoundingly good. From the small appetizers they serve you when you are seated to the three courses of exquisite goodness it was a perfect dining experience. Even the waiter was friendly and made you feel at home.  I would recommend everyone trying this place at least once, even if you do it for restaurant week. What a treat.  I can't emphasize enough how good this food was. The pasta's were all delicious, the appetizers (short-rib ravioli) were amazing and the desert (flourless chocolate cake) was mouth-watering.

2.0,8/11/2014,"I so wanted to like this place due to so many of my friends and colleagues singing its praise but it built up such as expectation I though it would whisk me to Italy when I have had many wonderful meals in little mom and pop restaurants that were magical to the taste.Firstly we were a group of 5 and we made lunch reservations, we went during restaurant week so that some of us who have never been able to check this place our at a reasonable fare.The Fried Zukini was an oily mess with no flavor, just because its free don't have to make such a mess of a tasteless dish. They server a sea food free appetizer which I passed, the bread was OK, cold and some were as hard as rock... terrible. We asked for some extra bread that never came even after 2 reminders, what kind of service is this ? The restaurant was not even half full and they were not filling the water promptly. The complementary cheese was a nice touch.My appetizer was the soup and it was so DAMN salty that I wanted to throw up,  This is just terrible, almost all resultants cook with no salt or minimum salt as patrons can add salt as necessary, not here it was as if the salt mines of Italy were dumping there waste in this restaurant.The Main course was was even worse, More salt and the flavor of the Marinara was lost in the amount of sodium. What was worse is the guy serving the crushed pepper was simply spraying wild into plates of those of us slightly out of reach and there was pepper sprayed all over the table and our clothes too.The dessert was worse than a shoprite 2.99$ special for the day. Overall a terrible experience for me and few of the die hard who had frequented this places few time before also said that it was a disappointment.I this it has outlived its time, its trying to ride out its passed glory, sadly people like me don't care about passed glory or who-is-who in the chef circuit. If you are non consistent and your food it not repeatable then you are a dog and pony show one hit wonder.... who does not work for me!This resultant really SUCKS!

I've been to some dim lighting restaurant but I swear it's just a candle lighting up your table. Now imagine a big table with 12 people and two candles lighting us up?? We were falling asleep during dinner! Make matters worse; with 12 person round table they seated us in a corner... how exactly would you serve food to the people draped up the wall you may ask??? Well let me answer it for you, hovering over me and rubbing your sack on my arm/shoulder over 40 times. Thanks but no thanks. Beyond that the food is absolutely dreadful and overpriced! I must be spoiled by the restaurants in Toronto with the ""fine dining motif"" because I swear a 20$ appetizer is good enough to feed 3 people. The wine list is despicable; very very bad wine. I mean BAD; in the tub house wine. I ordered the Eggplant with crab/shrimp/seafood with Tomato cream sauce. Let's just say, DENSE. As for my entree- ordered the ""special"" Porcini stuffed black truffle sauced ravioli....... where was the truffle? *crickets... al dente cooked ravioli with a heavy butter cream sauce... once again- NO TRUFFLE. Oh let me mention I stepped outside for a phone call and there was a hobo right outside the restaurant asking for food and money. I mean I felt bad because he looked like a veteran (and I support our troops big time) so after I told him I was just making a call and left my wallet inside he told me he wanted a plate of pasta; not just any pasta or left over or anything but specifically angel hair pasta with meatballs and that CLAUDIO the manager knew exactly what he wanted.

5.0,8/3/2014,"4.5 stars, but I'll round up.We came here for a Sunday family dinner.  They were booked but luckily when I called, they fitted us into their reservation schedule.  Because of this, I wasn't too upset we had to wait another 1 hr 15 min for a table.  We sat at the bar and met some good people, had great conversations.Ambiance is cozy, family style Italian with dark lighting and a Old NYC Italian decor.  Welcome change from the hip looking restaurants with wannabe's as staff and so-so food.  It's not a big space so we did feel cramped at the bar and once we sat for dinner.  Fortunately, by the time we sat for dinner it was late hour and some of the tables were already empty.  I liked the crowd.Food is fantastic.  My Mom's pasta dish was the best pasta I've had at a restaurant.  I forgot the name of it... they didn't give us menus (?).  The waiter just asked what we felt like eating and made suggestions.  My veal dish with spinach was very good as well as the chicken dish (sauteed with white white sauce).  I thought the free appetizers were good but a bit oily.  Tiramisu and bread were just ok.Service was great.  Our server was Italian along with the Maitre D'/Host.  Staff has personality.  All were dressed in appropriate attire, like an old-school restaurant.Price was ok and as expected.  We didn't get menu so I had no idea until the bill came what the charges would be as we ordered full courses, wine, and desert.  Not to mention the cocktails we had at the bar.  Average dining prices... around $35/dish, wine around $15/glass, $10-15 cocktails.Would definitely come again for dinner or lunch.  This was a great recommendation from New York native friends.",1,0,0,Angelique B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,131,3

2.0,6/24/2014,"I was prepared to love il Mulino. I almost did when I was warmly welcomed to sit down, have complimentary bread, bruchetta, salami, cheese, and grilled zucchini.. everything was delicious and I wasn't even given the menu yet. I was encouraged to relax, settle in, and prepare for gastronomical delights, before being provided a menu to peruse.. a true sign of high end dining. The prices weren't as high as I expected and I looked around to see that the dining area was small, maybe 20x20, it was dark, and the wall paper looked dated. Maybe I should've gone to the one on E60th instead. Well, so long as the food made my eyes roll back, that's all that would matter. Unfortunately, that was not the case. I had their Carbonara as well as their special of the day, Lobster Ravioli. They were both salty. The ravioli had a good texture and though the lobster tasted fresh out of the sea, the dish wasn't as tasty as I would have preferred.  il Mulino doesn't seem good with their sauces. The Carbonara.. I expected it to be perfect, since it's one of the easiest and most popular Italian dishes.  It's actually one of my favorites that I've had all over the city.  So, why was the pasta hard? maybe it was a wheat pasta?  I was too annoyed to bother asking. The sauce somehow clotted or congealed and turned lumpy and dry on the hard pasta. They did add a lot of meat on it, but it was just disappointing overall.  The service and captain were so attentive and pleasing that to voice my true thoughts of their entrees would make them saddened as well. Great service, prices weren't too bad for a supposedly high end restaurant, but the food wasn't too good either.  Maybe people should just lower their expectations since the place gets so much hype. It's all about the food though and their main courses are just not delicious enough for what is supposed to be high end Italian culinary cuisine.",2,0,0,Carol X.,"New York, NY",48,20,2

There is so much food involved in the dining experience and everything tastes pretty spectacular, especially the bread sticks which are saturated in the most delicious olive oil and garlic flavor you can imagine. Before dinner arrives you are served a zucchini in olive oil, a bruschetta dish, bread, a mussel, fresh cheese, and cured meats. For my main course I had the chicken and artichoke in white wine and the flour-less chocolate cake for dessert and both had my taste buds running around in ecstasy, The dining room is dark and very romantic and the ambiance provides old world charm and class to your dinner experience.

We arrived at 8pm. When would it have been available ? We mentioned that it was a guests birthday when we booked the table. A waiter duly came out with a piece of cake and sang. We were charged $18.00. I don't think that is right. I feel the place has gone to the tourists in that the staff don't really do anything to make you feel welcome and the food is totally indifferent.

Only tip for my fellow foodies is not to fill up on appetizer (too much). They feed you so well here with wine, bread, olives, bruchetta etc - before you even get to your entree. The entrees are SO delicious and amazing that is a shame to be too full to really enjoy it.

The Flourless Chocolate Cake was simply two sad thin slices of chocolate cake with chocolate sauce carelessly drizzled across the plate. And the Limoncello Tiramisu?

The food more than makes up for it. They start you out with free appetizers to get your hunger going. Things like fresh Parmesan cheeses that they shave off of a huge chunk right onto your plate. Garlic bread that is to die for. Baked clams. The works right off the bat. When it comes to the main dishes and appetizers that you pay for you can't go wring with whatever you order. Their pasta dishes are amazing, the veal chops and lamb chops are some of the best you will ever have and their fish is fresh and made so tasty and creatively. I also personally really like their scallops wrapped in bacon. I'm usually so full by the time dessert comes that I ponder not getting it but who the hell am I kidding?

Their fish selections are incomparable. This establishment was actually successful in making me a fan of Tuna and Salmon, which I both disliked initially. However, after all this time, their bolognese remains my favorite. It never fails and I alway order it.  The service is always impeccable. Definitely pricey, but well worth it!.

2.0,12/16/2013,"WOW!  I really did not enjoy this place.  We arrived on time for our reservation which was at 6pm and were made to wait nearly 30 minutes at their teeny tiny bar area in spite of the fact that there were tables open, and they weren't at all apologetic about it.  The food.  So-so.  And certainly not worth the big, big price tags.  The antipasto of sauteed zucchini was a slick of oil.  My $14 side of brussel sprouts had 4 halved sprouts in a slick of oil.  My $60 dollar branzino was nothing special. The truffle, porcini ravioli appetizer was light on the truffles and I think they were canned to boot.  My $20 berry dessert with zabione was good but again woefully over-priced.  These were all specials, so we didn't know the prices until the check came which I guess is the only way they can operate with such price gouging.  I guess if the food was good it would be one thing but with mediocre food it was just offensive.

That is something I would forgive if the food would be special. It is unfortunately completely uninteresting.I think this place has success, because those who do not understand much, they think that it must be good if it is expensive and Italian.Menue and wine list are overpriced just like in most of the Italian restaurants.Pasta was al dente and good, but not exceptional.Will never go back and would certainly not recommend to anyone.Also, why all the waiters are so overweight?

2.0,8/16/2013,"The food itself deserves 5 stars but if it is the whole dining experience that you are after, then this restaurant gets only disappointing 2 stars.  First of all, given the $$$$ range, you would think it is a fancy grand restaurant, but it is not.  The restaurant is in the NYU neighborhood mixed with other very ordinary stores (there's a low-end sushi and a take-out milk shake store by the side) and it is so low-key that I walked past it without realizing its existence.  I had an appointment at 12:00 but when I got to the door at 11:50 it was not open yet and the door was locked--not very hospitable.  The interior is just as disappointing.  It is so TINY--absolutely TINY and cramped--probably the smallest restaurant I've been to--just slightly bigger than a Chinese take-out shop.  There is absolutely no view inside--not even street view-- coz all the seats are in the back of the restaurant and the windows are curtained up.  It feels like eating in a cave or a basement.  Again, if you care about the dining environment, stay away.The serve is bad! Not sure if they cut corners for the Restaurant Week or it is their common practice, you don't get a dedicated server like in most other restaurant.  Rather, you see different waiters taking turns to serve you different things.  A group of waiters walk around the tiny room, each of them specializing in serving one particular food.  And there's one main server who takes all the orders in the room, who has a very dramatic voice and funny demeanor so you hear him throughout the meal repeating the same menu to all the tables and making awkward conversations.  His demeanor makes me uncomfortable--probably the most pretentious I've ever seen!The whole dining experience is stressful--partly because of the cramped space, the constantly moving around servers in such a tiny space and the repeating loud funny voice of taking orders--but also because of the pressure of ordering extra foods and drinks not on the Restaurant Week menu.  In the end, they charged me $9 for water.  Outrageous! The tipping process is as just embarrassing.  They ask for two separate tips on the bill--one called ""tip"" and the other called ""captain tip"".  This is funny coz I don't even have a dedicated server (again, each server specializes in serving ONE type of food), and I haven't seen the captain at all, how possibly can I tip? I gave them a lump sum tip anyways and before I stepped out of the restaurant, the waiter could not wait to open to cheque folder to check how much I tipped Embarrassing and rude!To sum up, the food is great but everything else isn't.  My comment focuses on all the aspects that didn't live up to my expectation because I think such a branded restaurant with such a price range should not just be about the food--it is not a talk-out place after all.  And this restaurant failed to deliver a holistic dining experience that justifies its price, or the overwhelmingly positive comments you see on Yelp.",1,0,0,G C.,"Palo Alto, CA",3,22,1
4.0,8/14/2013,"Came at noon during restaurant week to see the place already 75 percent full, a good starting sign. Was seated with my friends in an old-school decor'd Italian place that made me think of what an Italian joint would look like in the village circa the 1950's-60s. Its also interesting how the outside blocks your view on the inside with white drapes, always making me wonder in the past what was inside. Right as your seated you are treated to breads, zucchini, pepperonis, even an oyster, a great start! Of course for restaurnt week your choices are limited but you get a good flavor for the spot. I started with some Caprese for an appetizer, which was well seasoned on the tomatoes and cheese. I decided to go with Chicken Parm with my entree, and it was well cooked and crispy. I sampled my brothers gnocchi which tasted about average, and my friends veal which I wasn't a fan of, so the Chicken Parm gets my highest remark on the entrees. Wow, they did save the best for last. The  flourless chocolate cake (which the waiter insisted was homeade) was absolutely delicious, my one grumble being that the portion was more like a ""sample"" then a real piece of cake, but alas beggers cant be choosers during restaurant week.  Overall the  Service was very attentive, all though may have been just a touch on the slower side delivering the food.

5.0,8/8/2013,"Amazing. I was originally skeptical when my friend suggested we come here for restaurant week (lots of overly expensive places end up being a bit overrated), but I was immensely impressed.The pre-appetizers that you get are plenty already to get you filled and are really delicious. We received roasted eggplants (wonderful), salami (pretty normal), bruschetta (the tomatoes here are AMAZING, I wish I could have gotten more), and zucchini fritters (very delicious, though a bit on the salty side).We shared all our dishes to maximize our experience, so I'll go through the dishes one by one:Caprese Salad - Very delicious. As I mentioned before, the tomatoes here are amazing. The buffalo mozzarella serving was very generous and very good.Tuna Carpaccio - So good. I'm a huge fan of tuna and this dish lived up to my expectations. The vinaigrette that accompanied it was a perfect match.Veal Milanese - Unfortunately disappointing. It tasted sort of like a mediocre fried chicken patty. The arugula salad on top also looked kind of strange, so I have to say meh for the presentation as well as the flavor.Striped Bass Sughetto di Fungi - Wonderful. I guess they must do fish very well here. The sauce was subtly flavored (but not bland) and the fish was very fresh. The mushrooms were very tasty and complemented the fish well.Flourless Chocolate Cake - Good but a bit too rich. I wasn't able to finish it.Lemon Sorbet - Amazingly tangy. It was also served inside a lemon which was a pretty neat presentation and had a blackberry in it. I'd recommend this dessert over the chocolate cake.The service was also great--the waiters were very attentive and friendly and gave useful suggestions.

It was my birthday and we had 16 people. the nite started at the bar where we had some cocktails. My father had ordered a GLASS of champagne,when the bill came my friend decided to pay it, feeling bad my father wanted to give him money. When my father looked at the bill he realized he was charged for a bottle of Tattinger @ $400 a bottle instead of the $16 for the glass. My father informed the bartender of the error & the bartender said ""mi scusi mi scusi"", right nice try. Our table was waiting for us,which happened to be the only highlight of the evening. We ordered some zuchini flowers stuffed with cheese for the table, they came out drenched in a buttery picatta sauce, just odd. Meanwhile as were conversing at the table. I notice the busboys pouring bottled water @ $15 a bottle like its going out of style, while everybody's cocktail glasses were empty, especially my friend who was drinking Glenmorange @ $20 a glass. The evening continued on a downward spirial when 7 veal dishes were ordered & none of them went to the right person. there were also about a dozen side dishes sent to the table which we did not order.

Cute interior and very dim, like how I imagine it would be at my nonexistent Italian uncle's house or something. The complimentary apps were good, but actually a little strange as they were greasy and salty.Our entrees though were really what made our night. Actually, correction: the squid ink linguine is really what made the night. It was AMAZING. Like I wanted to savor Every. Single. Bite. The branzino, on the other hand, was pretty pricy and not prepared as well as I've had it at other restaurants. Good, but really not outstanding.Everything else was good-- cheese, wine, dessert. But again, I think it was really the linguine that blew me away.However, if anything, I would maybe dock a star for service.

Food is of course top notch. What really blew my mind were the the lamb chops (on special) and the Fra Diavlo. These are two of my favorite dishes ever, so I usually order them whenever I can. I got the Fra Diavlo, extra spicy, and couldn't stop eating it. It was the best I've ever had. And the crushed red peppers I requested, where do they get them?? Never have I had such fresh, strong, spicy red peps. The lamb chops came to me from my friend who was preggers and unable to eat them at the last minute. Serious luck for me.

They let you get up to three pastas in one plate which is great as you can try more than one pasta. The pesto angel hair pasta with sundried tomatoes (not on the menu) is delicious. You can pretty much request for any combination as far as the pastas are concerned! When they finally slap you with the bill, you won't be able to understand it, not only because it is really dark, but they also don't itemize anything! There's just an exorbitant total you're expected to trust and pay. Guess what? You were probably charged for all those apps!Having said ALL that, I feel a little guilty because I do like going here and always have a good time (maybe because I drink a lot of wine). Lunch is not a bad option also (I've been once for lunch) and its really easy to get a reservation and there is no wait. And the food's the same.  It's a nice spot to take a date and has a very homey vibe. Try it out once but be prepared to pay a lot!!",4,2,0,Shuchi K.,"Boston, MA",31,80,1

All for free.  And again, the service is impeccable.  I'm usually stuffed by the time I get my entree, but again, those ravioli are sooo tempting.Reservations are pretty key.  I've been lucky all three times (two with a reservation, one without).  If you are able to go, definitely go, but don't expect to walk in off the street.",1,0,0,Angel D.,"Atlanta, GA",2,15,0

To me, the food that we had (caprese and casear salads, gnocci, veal scallopini and pollo fra diavolo) was so average. It honestly tasted like something you would eat at a typical NJ / NY wedding venue. I would have hit myself if I paid full price for those dishes.

5.0,9/18/2012,"Located in Greenwich Village, Il Mulino surely does not disappoint. The room is small and dimly lit, setting the mood for the overall experience. Service is excellent and appeared very confident in all of the menu items. The lead waiter even had the confidence to say if you didn't see something on the menu you wanted you could order it and the kitchen would serve your needs. The starter courses for garlic bread, to baked breads to fried zucchini were excellent. Cheeses were delicious  with an emphasis on freshness and quality. The wine lists were solid including a very good Prosecco offering. The mains were per the usual offerings within the Italian genre of cuisine. However, there was a special focus on veal dishes both Scaloppine style and bone-in. I had the pleasure to order the difficult to make perfectly, but delectable veal picatta. The veal from a procurement perspective was excellent as the meat just melted in your mouth. Although not a heavy lemon flavor it was just enough to remind your taste buds what you were eating. The portions were excellent.A starter ravioli was also ordered with a heavy mushroom influence. This dish was not as big of a hit as the mushroom taste overpowered what appeared to be a nice overall ravioli presentation. Although, the ravioli noodles were not light and appeared slightly overcooked.For dessert, a flourless chocolate cake and an assortment of coffees were ordered.

3.0,8/16/2012,"We went here for Restaurant Week lunch today. We got off on an awkward foot when I was told they did not allow shorts under their dress code. I laughed and said no one mentioned that when I made the reservation the previous day, even though the temperature at lunchtime was 100 degrees. I later reviewed their website and the Open Table booking page, and the latter only mentions causal dining with a business casual dress code. I also saw another male customer wearing pants but flip flops. I guess that's okay. At least I had shoes! Anyway, I was given a large pair of waiter pants to put on in the entryway, which was fun. As for the dining, it was quite good, but not great. Well worth the restaurant week price, but probably not worth the normal prices. They immediately brought out some nice parmesan, a slightly spicy pan fried zucchini medley, and a bread basket which also includes some salty, buttery garlic bread slices. A nice start to the meal. All 3 of us ordered wine by the glass (2 reds and 1 white) and each was quite good, but they were more moderately priced than other choices and still $15 each. The starters were a choice of Caprese Salad or Caesar Salad. The Caesar was quite disappointing, dressing too tangy, shrivelled, tiny croutons, and finely chopped romaine. The Caprese was very good, with mozz, a large, fresh tomato slice, a sundried tomato, roasted red pepper and a slice of prosciutto. Fresh, simple and tasty. The mains were Veal Milanese, Chicken Fra Diavolo and Gnocchi Bolognese. The Gnocchi was the best, a solid dish which was simple and as one would expect. The Fra Diavolo was not very spicy at all, and while the sausage pieces added a good flavor, the vegetables (broccoli and zucchini) were small and negligible. The onion and tomato sauce was nice, but somewhat mild, and the chicken pieces, while juicy, surprisingly seemed like medallions, or chunks, almost as one finds in a General Tso's chicken. It was not particularly memorable. The veal was pounded extremely thinly and paired with a salad of finely chopped tomato, red onion, and arugula. This was certainly the weakest dish of the lot, underwhelming, too simple and a disappointment. The desserts were the lemon sorbet, which was balanced and refreshing. And a flourless chocolate cake, which was transcendent. The cake was fantastic and finished the meal off on a high note. Surprisingly, despite the very attentive service, we were not offered coffee though the dining room had emptied out by 3pm. An espresso would've paired nicely with the cake (and brought our check up a bit higher). The service was excellent overall, although almost too attentive, as a small army of waiters and bus boys hover around in jacket and tie. Overall, I would save the money and go to a different Italian restaurant for a meal. I'm glad I tried Il Mulino, as I've read a lot about it over the years, but it may be resting on its laurels. The location is cramped, the decor is tired (think the wallpaper at your grandma's house), and the prices are high. The food is good, although some dishes are stronger in quality than others. And it's a bit stuffy, with their demand of pants instead of shorts on the hottest day in 50 years, and a line to tip the waiter captain.

The restaurant was pretty empty at that point. The servers were basically just staring at us. I felt like our server was pushy. I did like all the free apps and i remember they were delicious. cheese and garlic bread. Our meal itself ( both got pasta) were bland and nothing special. As i have stated before in other reviews I am on the search for the best carbonara and this didnt come close at all,2,0,0,Jessica H.,"Manhattan, NY",348,331,55

(Since i wear that to work that day.  I am a designer) They are sexually descrimination since both the female went with me and I wear the shorts.  When we walked in, the host asked me ""Do you mind to put on the pants?  We have one back there.""  Just me. Yes, totally sexually discriminated me.  I will never go back to this terrible restaurant.    They should be happy that i didn't bother to sue them for sexually descirmination.",6,11,2,Danny C.,"Jersey City, NJ",108,307,152

The only reservation we could get was 5:30, which worked out just fine, as we had theater tickets for 8:00. What a treat! The ""gratis"" appetizers were wonderful (though a little spicy for me) and filled both of us up so much, we both were almost full by the time we finished our salads! I had the Dover Sole; my husband had the Branzino. Both were outstanding. Expensive, but outstanding. The wait staff were great, very attentive and thorough. My only complaint was the Caesar Salad. It was overdressed and soggy. We were too full for dessert, so I don't have any comments for that, but our friends said they are wonderful. All in all, a great dining experience.

As soon as we sat down for lunch, we had 3 servers at our table getting our drinks and water. One server immediately dropped off roasted garlic bread strips and italian bread. The other server came with a huge block of parmesian cheese and carved out some peices for us. We enjoyed two bottles of wine; a white and a red. These were slightly overpriced considering the flavor of the wines. We shared an appetizer that was a special, scallops wrapped wtih bacon. This was delicious, the scallops were very fresh. Then we split the veal cappricio which was amazingly tender and delicious. We then moved on to dessert, italian cheesecake and lemon sorbet; both were great. Once dessert came we were seved grappa, the italian version of moonshine. Be expected to drop some serious cash, but after getting a little shit faced with the wine and grappa, being doted on by the staff and eating some amzing food... it was well worth it!",0,1,0,Corrin C.,"Syracuse, NY",2,37,6

You come in and are bombarded with food - a chunk of parmesan, all sorts of bread, bruschetta, garlic bread, and the entree portions are generous. They had seriously 20 specials that our waiter had completely memorized. I had the porcini mushroom ravioli with a truffle cream sauce - so good. For dessert had sorbet, though I wanted to try tiramisu. I had peach sorbet which came in an actual frozen peach! Delicious and so cute. It's dark in there, so bring your reading glasses and flashlight! But they are super accommodating and the food was so good. My friend had gnocchi which wasn't even on the menu.

5.0,1/6/2012,I have eaten at more resturants than I probably care to count. I love food and I little patience for an average meal. My one goal at a resturant is to have a foodgasim and Il Mulino certainly delivered. from the first bit of the bread to the last bit of my rack of lamb I felt undeserving of the great meal. Being a graduate student the check was a bit larger than I would have wanted but a date with the GF and great food means it was well worth the hit to the wallet. I will be back again if possible. It is hard to get a reservation her so call a few day if not a week in advance. Also dont go to early because you have the whole staff standing around looking at you. It was the first time I felt uncomfortable in a resturant prior to getting my food but it turned out just fine. If you want expereince of being in a place for the rich then this is it as far as resturants go if you hate the high society feel then dont go here. I personally prefer to feel like all are welcomed but the food here is worth a little discomfort. Just go here. The food is worth every dollar and make sure you order a rack of Lamb.

5.0,1/2/2012,"Oh my.... Il Mulino....My babe and I were on the hunt down to find a really good Italian place to dine at one evening, when we decided to ask a  local New Yorker for some recomondations on good places to eat . Il Mulino was one of there top recomondations.This place happens to be one of the most well known, popular Italian restaurant in the New York area and due to its popularity, is needed to book resevations weeks in advance, however, with the help of our new friend and a phone call, we lucked out with getting a reservation at 9:30 on a Thursday night.Located in Greenwich Village, this place (from the outside) looks as if a whole in the wall little place, that you could miss with a blink of the eye. Inside is quite small as well with dark dimmed lighting and candles throughout, creating a very intimate atmosphere. Bar is in front upon entering to your right. Atmosphere was also packed and lively, only building up the anticipation upon getting seated. We also while waiting, could here conversations from regulars waiting to be seated that were just raving about the place.After waiting a half and hour to be seated, we got a nice little table by the wall overlooking the restaurant. They immediately start giving you food. Sliced salami, some sort of sauteed eggplant appetizers that was extremely tasty, a basket of thin crisped bread and regular bread. I am not sure what the thin crispy bread was called but it was absolutely incredible! Soft yet chewy and just jam packed with savory flavor!! It appeared to have been almost baked in olive oil and seasoned to perfection!!! I am not a bread person by all means and could have ate the hole basket.We ordered an appetizer of sliced cheeses, tomato's and something else came on there that I cannot recall. The appetizer was nice and flavorful though, to small in portion for my liking. I also ordered a glass of a really nice Italian red wine which complemented everything beautifully.For our main courses my hun and I both ordered the Chicken Parmigiana.Oh my....that chicken parmigiana arrived presented as mouth watering delicious as if you were looking at food for the first time after spending days starving and oh my, was it everything it presented it self to be. Huge in portion yet anything but lacking in flavor, everything was perfect!Flavor was on par and just amazing and the chicken was cooked to a tender soft consistency just exploding with wonderfulness! Hands down the BEST Chicken Parmigiana I have ever had.Overall waiters were on par for the most part, food was amazing!! They are extremely pricey though beyond worth it and the place though small, is quite intimate, engaging and makes you feel right at home.Oh Mulinos....until next time.....",4,2,3,Shannon H.,"Brentwood, CA",781,1068,666
5.0,12/31/2011,"I will do the Pepsi Challenge  with Il Mulino with any restaurant you want to name. If by chance you able to get a dinner reservation be sure to knock over a gas station before you get there, better make it 2 gas stations just in case you want to order some wine. Don't make plans to go anywhere after you eat because this is the kind of meal that takes hours and is worth every cent and there are ALOT of cents. Claudio the host is a absolute gentleman and is truly glad to see you every time you walk in, or he is the best actor in New York. The pre appetizer course which is free is buy far the best collection and mixture of a cold antipasto you will ever have.( don't worry they make sure to re coop there losses with the appetizers and main courses)  Make sure you look around you never know who your sitting next to. If your bringing a date that is shy about eating or can't GET DOWN, leave her home and bring one of your boys.

5.0,12/30/2011,"A meal at Il Mulino is a first-class Italian experience.  The food was superb, but what made this one of the best dinners I've ever had was the attentive service, the intimate atmosphere, the native Italian waitstaff, and the numerous pre-dinner ""freebies"".  I've never been to any restaurant that serves you six (six!!!) appetizers before you've even had a chance to look at the menu.We could only get a 10pm reservation, but arrived at 9:30 and the friendly hostess (who looked like the owner's wife) took our jackets and directed us to the Maitre D, who was able to seat us right away.  30 seconds after sitting down, we were greeted by a nice man serving freshly cut parmesan.  This was immediately followed by a different man carrying a plate of bruschetta - the toasted bread was piled high with delicious roma tomatoes, and was served with mussels.After the third free (!) appetizer, we ordered a bottle of wine.  Whereas I thought I would be scoffed at for perusing the least expensive bottles (still in the $80 range), the waiter, with his adorable Italian accent, provided great recommendations and we were drinking a delicious Sangiovese within 5 minutes.I opted for Cappellini a l'Arrabiatta for dinner, and while the order was standard, there was nothing standard about the way it was prepared - it was UNBELIEVABLY delicious.  The sauce was light and spicy, the onions were sauteed perfectly, and the portion was just right.  My boyfriend ordered the Canneloni with beef and veal, which also blew us away.  Quite simply, the best Italian meal I've ever eaten.Do yourself a favor and make a reservation at Il Mulino.  Sure, it's expensive, but it's Manhattan!  This place is worth every penny for the once in a lifetime experience.",1,0,1,Katie R.,"Sudbury, MA",3,28,5

From that moment on, I did not stop eating for the next three hours (!!!). I could barely get up from the table. Generally, I would recommend sticking to the menu, from which everything was delicious and generously portioned.

And for sure the bathrooms could be bigger and cleaner (more updated too). Tables are also pretty close together.Part of the fun here as well is the crowd it attracts.  I'd say I'm in the ""normal"" category, but all around you are tables of people you just want to know the story behind...Old men with their mistresses,  a table of 7 people all over 80, a mafia-oso looking dude and his chicky, the occasional celebrity.  Central casting would have a field day here - It's a real Woody Allen film in there!This is an EXPENSIVE place to go for dinner, so be sure and note the best way to order is to go with one or two other people and split everything.  The three of us split: pasta carbonara, truffle ravioli (both pastas served together on each plate), a veal chop and the ricotta cheesecake. I didn't get a super close look at the bill (THANKS DUKE!) but I believe it was about $180 before tip.  Note that includes all the ""free"" appetizers (the zucchini, the mussel the parm cheese)The food is the star here.  Really really authentic, upscale, old-school, NY italian.  YUMMER CITY.Usually too they don't really honor your reservation time, normally you wait at least 1/2 hour for your table.  BUT since this was the first Sunday they were open, and it was a holiday weekend, we actually got to our table at the designated time.",0,0,0,Amy W.,"San Francisco, CA",202,1235,1790

I find this appalling. We were both running late to get back to work so we paid the bill and left.  Later, I had a friend call Il Mulino to ask what they charge for the dish (because we really felt like we were being scammed or at the very least overcharged bc of the mandarin oriental connection).  They were told $32 for the pasta and $60 for the truffles, bringing the total to $92, which is a much more reasonable price for the dish.  I called them today to ask about the discrepancy, and of course they denied it.  I spoke to Tony, who claimed he was the manager.  And the worst part?  It didn't even taste good.

We had 5 women in our party and we had traveled to New York for a 40th Birthday! We had heard about the restaurant and had reservations before we arrived in NYC. The reviews looked good and we had heard about all the food you recieve upon arrival. When we arrived it was very old decor with really bad wall paper and so dark that you can barely see the people you were dining with.  The appetizers were pretty good but the bread that is served to start is so oily that I actually had to wipe my lip as the oil dripped down. The food was very average, especially for the price. All of us love Italian food and we had lots of food left which we didn't even want to take to go. The wait staff was very rude and when asked about spliting plates, which we called about in advance, the manager rolled his eyes and walked away not returning to our table for about 45 minutes. The kicker was when they sang my friend Happy Birthday with a nice cake light with candles. Directly after the song was over and everyone clapped they removed the cake and set it up on the shelf. Seriously, I have never experienced anything like that in my life. I am not hard to please and I honestly don't understand what the hype is about this restaurant. It appeared to be a very arrogant staff with unimpressive food.",7,0,0,Shannon P.,"Indy Metro, Indianapolis, IN",2,7,1
3.0,9/13/2011,"Il Mulino is very good -- I waited a long time to actually make it to this restaurant.Like everyone says, as soon as you are seated, you get lots of food -- salami, cheese, garlic bread, fried zucchini. The fried zucchini was pretty icky, it was sitting on the table cold when we got there, and was really oily. But the garlic bread, cheese, bruschetta (with a mussel!) were all really excellent, so the zucchini wasn't much of a loss.The wine list was not particularly long, but it was particularly expensive. We got a pretty basic Chianti for around $100, which was fine but enormously marked up. The sommelier was charming, but recommended bottles that were all more expensive than the range we wanted (it was a weeknight!), so we ended up going with our own choice.For appetizers, I got a Caesar salad; it was excellent, by far the best I've had in the city. Classic style, with garlic and egg and anchovies, very delicious and worth well more than the $14 they charge for it. I will go back just for that salad!! On the other hand, my boyfriend got a buffalo mozzarella special, with tomatoes and prosciutto. The plate was $26 and came with 1 slice of bland prosciutto, plus grocery-store-grade mozzarella and mealy, bland tomatoes. It was terrible, and we were slightly offended at how expensive it was for such low quality.For our entrees, I got chicken parmesan. It was excellent, and enormous (easily could have fed 2 people). It was $38, so expensive, but I didn't feel ripped off. Boyfriend got a delicious pasta dish, I think it was Capellini Il Mulino, with capellini, peas, and a cream sauce. The pasta was also excellent and a pretty good value at $25 or around there, I don't remember exactly. Overall, prices were about $5 more per item than my favorite neighborhood Italian places, which makes it very expensive but somewhat reasonable given all of the extras they provide (including a glass of grappa or limoncello at the end of dinner).I will definitely go back, if only for the Caesar salad. But I will definitely not order the mozzarella again, and I would consider bringing my own wine if they allow it and have a reasonable corkage fee.",0,0,0,L K.,"Los Angeles, CA",198,39,3

It started off with the wait but that wasn't a problem since we were a bit late. Our server was on point and we did not have to wait for anything.  For appetizers we ordered Bolgneses pasta to share and the Buffalo Mozzarella.I ordered a pasta dish but I can't remember what I ordered.

3.0,9/5/2011,"If you love Il Mulino - read this...Giving this place three stars just absolutely pains meI warn you this is long - but I've included some prices just to give people an idea - or maybe just to confirm my long-standing theory that some people of Italian-American descent maybe enjoying the same dishes at a significant discount to myself :)To begin, this was, until last week, my favorite Italian restaurant in the city (money no object of course - i mean, is there a more direct way to say ""money no object"" than to omit prices from the menu?)I used to dream about this place. I was looking forward to my meal last week since the day I made the reservation.We walk in and we're immediately greeted with the big hunk of Parmiggiano-Reggiano cut straight from the wheel, still moist and tender and basically (sadly) what was to be, the best part of the meal.Along with the cheese, you get a little bruschetta and - wait a minute - you can read about all that on the rest of the reviews here - we all know what they have and why there are so many five-stars.Here's the problem with the rest.The ricotta Stuffed Zucchini Flowers appetizer special ($26) was slightly on the soggy side. The Eggplant Rollatini stuffed with Crabmeat (also an appetizer special - $32) was ""fishy"" tasting and needed to be doused with the cream sauce it came with.Then came the standard ""trio of pastas"" - now I'm not sure how the rest of the people eat here, but I was brought by veterans who've always done a tasting trio of pastas before the meats - kinda keeping with the primi/secondi authenticity if you will.For the trio, I opted for the Papperdelle with Sausage ($36) that was on special - along with my go-to standbys.... Gnocchi w/ Pesto ($32), and one of the loves of my life, the Truffle Ravioli (aka Wild Mushroom Ravioli aka $50).Used to be that you could barely smell anything other than truffles from the Wild Mushroom Ravioli, and they gave you the option for more shavings. Maybe it's the rough economy, but no such option was suggested or even offered and the pasta itself was heavily creamed and unmemorable, and without a hint or scent of truffle!. The Gnocchi, was heavy to say the least, and the pesto, almost watered-down.For entree we decided to share the Veal Milanese ($48) (probably my favorite Italian dish in general) as well as a Veal Osso Bucco ($55). Now, normally I get the bone-in Veal Parm (which I have yet to see any one man finish on their own as it's pounded  so thin it more than covers the massive plate)... but for some reason, and I'm not sure why, I decided to go with the Milanese.The standard arugula-onion-tomato salad on top of the Milanese was however tossed in a strong balsamic that basically destroyed this dish!The Osso Bucco was quite good, but once again, unmemorable. (To prove the point, I don't remember if it came on top of rice or risotto - I'm guessing the latter).Maybe it's my fault for venturing away from the Veal Parm. Maybe I should've insisted on dousing the ravioli with a massive shaving of truffle. But I remember thinking all throughout our Cheesecake ($18) and Berries with fresh Zabaglione ($20) (both excellent but the table couldn't eat anymore), that I felt bad for the first-timers at the table. The people who thought it was a great meal and were stuffed. Because I sadly remembered a different Il Mulino that left me orgasmic and reaching for a smoke.At a four-digit bill for four people (tip included) - albeit with almost $400 of wine... there are better Italian options in the city and it will be a while before I venture back to one that is tiny, stuffed-in, antiquated, and worst of all - the bathrooms look like they haven't been updated/touched in 50 years (I mean, I get that a place needs character - but the bathrooms? really?)",16,0,1,Abul R.,"Brooklyn, NY",54,304,181

2.0,9/3/2011,"I have been to the Il Mulino in Chicago many times, and it was always an amazing experience. Finally I was able to try the New York location. The menu is very similar, but there are some differences in the preparation of the food. Unfortunately, and surprisingly, the New York version does not fare well in comparison. The free appetizers get the meal off to a quick and tasty, if heavy, beginning. For the next course, we had langostines and the eggplant stuffed with seafood. The langostines were heavenly. Really, really delicious. The eggplant had crabmeat in it, but barely any scallop and no shrimp. It did have a nice eggplant flavor, but was a touch disappointing compared to what I have had at the other location I have been to. A shrimp dish (with incredibly large shrimp) was good, though not exceptional (it must be hard to get the timing right for cooking those monsters). A pasta dish was just ok. Still, it was a solid meal, with fair prices.But the restaurant really failed in two ways.I asked for a wine recommendation. The waiter went right to the top of my stated price range. This would have been fine if it was a good wine. It was not so good, and tasted more in line with what a wine of half the price should be like. It was not flawed, but just an ok wine. Very disappointing.Ended the meal with black tea. Mistake. Served Twinnings artificially flavored tea, which tasted truly awful. I didnt expect top quality loose tea, but, this was pretty bad. Just like Tazo or whatever would have been fine. Ricotta cheescake, a favorite of mine at the Chicago location, was not quite as good, but decent. The whipped cream was excellent.Space on the bill for a 'Captain's tip'. I don't see that too often.This place could have just managed 4 stars, but the bad wine service, which left me feeling taken advantage of, and the nasty tea, drag it down to 2 stars. It is especially the wine that hurts the rating. I have had many Italian wines, at home and at restaurants, and so I think I know whereof I speak. Definitely a bad wine recommendation. Oh, and I asked for a red wine on the full bodied side. It was a light-medium wine which was suggested for me. Just all wrong.I will try to avoid this place, though somehow I have a feeling I will be dragged back there at some point.",1,0,1,Jonathan C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,24,0

4.0,8/15/2011,"Amazing food and service.... Right from the get-go there are plenty of complimentary starters such as bruschetta, zucchini, salami and cheese.... Usually this will leave me thinking that the entree potions will be small but that was not the case at all... Great selection of wines in a small, dimly-lit, perhaps too much so cozy room, kind of like your grandmother's dining room, complete with the dated wallpaper.  Entrees were prepared on a portable butane gas grill near the entrance to the kitchen which gave the pasta that special steaming, straight off the pan kick...  However, although the food was all very good, I was shocked at the prices of some of our dishes.  Two of our entrees which were off the specials were $40 each.  Hers was an angel hair pasta dish in red sauce with seafood while mine was squid ink pasta in white wine sauce with bay scallops.  Both were good but I just cannot ever justify paying that price for pasta.",0,0,0,Overeater S.,"Palisades Park, NJ",15,40,1

I was full before I even looked at the menu. Then, we had a lobster pasta and I had the shrimp dish in wine sauce. My husband had the veal piccata and side of broccoli. Delicious!

5.0,7/12/2011,"This is my first five-star review, so I am understandably nettled. But Il Mulino really knocked my socks off, and I would be a two-faced sloth if I did not give them full credit in some way.Service was absolutely top-notch. We were greeted with genuine and generous smiles when we walked in for lunch, courteously whizzed to a table, provided with menus, and promptly deluged with a variety of fresh and fried bread, diced tomato salsas, and cured meats. There were four waiters working our table but none of them hovered around unnecessarily and nobody batted an eyelid when we ordered tap water. When we ordered appetizers to share, the food came to us conveniently divided into individual portions, and each plate was garnished and presented on its own merits.Food was similarly impressive. I began with the calamari and the stuffed eggplant. The calamari was blanched with a zesty lime and tomato sauce and bordered on average, but the eggplant was tremendous. The filling of pecorino and seafood was full, bold and wholesome and was a delightful contrast to the feather-light eggplant. After the first course, I had the fillet steak with a mushroom and gorgonzola sauce. This was a beast of a steak. The meat was tender and flavoursome and perfect at medium rare; the sauce was earthy and piquant. Like the eggplant, the rich, hearty overtones of the steak and the gorgonzola seemed to expertly straddle the subtle and the overwhelming. It kept threatening to tip into overkill, but it never did. And at the end, I was nowhere near saturation point and was craving for more.Dessert was tiramisu and an espresso. Standard fare, but again, very well done. The tiramisu was well-balanced with marsala and rum, and the mascarpone and sponge was light, fluffy and infinitely welcome after the full-flavoured starter and main course.All in all, Il Mulino was excellent. A couple of things to keep in mind. First, the portions are really generous. For example, if you order a snapper, you should expect that both fillets of that snapper would be served to you. You may be better off being selective and sharing certain dishes. Second, if you are budget-conscious and you intend to have one of the day's specials, consider asking about the price before ordering. I was somewhat surprised to find my steak priced at $65, which is double the price of most of the main courses on the ala carte menu. My bill weighed in at a hefty $125 including taxes and tips, which is much more than what I would want to pay for a weekday lunch.",0,0,0,Julien C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0

It had a nice flavor, but ravioli was a little tough.Also, while it was dim and you don't notice the walls unless you are looking, the wall paper must have been there since the mid-80's.

5.0,6/12/2011,"It was my second dinner at Il Mulino for my mother's birthday last night and it was incredible once again. Who wouldn't love this place? From the freebies that start you off the second your butt hits your chair (literally I am not kidding), to the charming ambience, and friendly impeccable staff. This time we had the porcini ravioli mushroom ravioli (again) and the langoustinos with mushroom and pea risotto for appetizers. That porcini ravioli really if one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had and a true must for anyone who goes. That sauce is truly wonderful, The risotto was also spectacular and the langoustinos perfectly cooked. We also loved how they finished off each dish tableside and were generous enough to split the 2 on 4 plates for us.We listenend to the lost list of specials and after every one we oohed and ahhed since they sounded awesome. My mom went with the red snapper special that came with shrimp, scallops, spinach and a lemon caper butter sauce. I am not kidding when I say this was one of the best fish plates I have tasted in my life. I really wish I had ordered this and was very surprised my mother stepped outside the box (for her anyway) and got it. My dad went with the rack of lamb, which I had last time and again was superb. My sister had the spaghetti with clams and loved it.Now for me? I was all set on getting the osso bucco which is their signature dish but the only problem was... THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT LATS NIGHT! Argh. I was crushed. So then I was torn between the veal parm or the whole branzino and I swear I switched my choice 8 times in my head. After much deliberation I decided to go with the veal parmigiana, which was the recommendation on the great captain Giancarclo who we had last time. Delicious, even though it was something simple. The best veal parm ever- and the presentation is something to see. The bone is still attached, 7 inches or so long and falls off the plate. And the actually veal, tender, pounded ever so thin covering the plate like a veal pizza.Sides of fried zucchini (crack) and broccoli rabe to round out the meal.Sang happy bday to mom for an incredible touch. Couldn't leave without dessert so we can zabaglione with the largest strawberries known to human race, coconut sorbet in a coconut shell which was so light, refreshing, and creamy, and of course the tiramisu.Bellisimmmmooooo il Mulino...!!",0,0,0,G C.,"New York, NY",21,264,798

5.0,1/11/2011,"I enjoy Italian, but have never experienced anything as delicious and bountiful as Il Mulino's.  Before we'd ordered a single item, we were inundated with bruschetta, mussels, fried zucchini in spicy oil, various breads, cheeses and meats. All of them were scrumptious (especially the fried zucchini!). It took every once of my mortal willpower to avoid overdosing on these starters that arrived before I'd even ordered an appetizer.Yes - everybody focuses on the quantity of food they provide to you (especially on the onset), but the quality of the appetizers, entrees and desserts is phenomenal too. Based on the advice of those who'd frequented Il Mulino's before, we ordered exclusively from their ""daily specials"" (which incidentally have been the same ""daily specials"" for past 30 or so years). Nobody had any complaints. Make sure you order something with langostinos - they are small and delicious crustaceans served with a mushroom and pea risotto which nearly brought me to tears. While I can't attest to it personally, another friend always orders the pasta sampler where the chef will create a sampling of three pastas based on his (and your) predilections on that day. No idea how much it costs, as we only ordered specials and not from the regular menu. The one price I caught was $27 bucks for a tuna carpaccio appetizer. Hopefully this helps folks level-set accordingly. I'd imagine this caters exclusively to a price-insensitive bunch (I was taken their for lunch by our counsel). Make sure you have ample time (40 hours if possible, but 24 will work) to recover from the unavoidable food coma...",2,2,2,Nils H.,"Denver, CO",40,188,0
5.0,1/4/2011,"Love, love, love!!! Once your foot is in the door you're being fed something garlicky and delicious! I mean it. .waiting at the bar to be seated I had zucchini sticks and huge chunks of parmesan cheese. Once seated the food just kept flowing! Little plates of every good Italian dish you can imagine. Great wine. I made up my own pesto gnocci dish that was superb, had some chilean sea bass that was equally as good and the rest I can't recall because of the extensive wine list. I did feel like I was in an episode of the Sopranos for a hot second. I didn't see the bill but I heard it was quite pricey but worth it in my opinion.",0,0,0,Jess M.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,26,1
2.0,12/26/2010,"First of all: what a strange looking place. Flowery wallpaper that hasn't been changed since Al Capone got busted for tax evasion. The clientele is a mix of old Italian-Americans, business people, tourists and foodies.I don't know what's up with the five-star reviews but I think a lot of it has to do with hype, with a strange cockiness that this place has and with the fact that some of the things are actually pretty good. But no way is it worth 5 stars and 100+ bucks per person. I rebel. Three of us. Lunchtime. Good table. Good ambience. Lively but, amazingly, not inaudible. I say amazingly because 99% of restaurants in the Village are becoming awfully loud. The list of items that were ingested include: comp zucchini appetizer; salame; parmesan; fried bread, garlic bread, bruschetta. then: pappardelle with sausage and mushrooms; tagliolini with lobster; sea bass in salt.First of all, the place is really expensive. I am not one to freak out over a few extra dollars if a meal warrants it, but this was a borderline rip-off. If it were an under-the-radar Italian joint with $12-15 pastas then I would give it at least one extra star. But we are talking about a place that is often held up as one of the top 2-3 Italians in NYC. As a native Italian, I get very uncomfortable when I see Mexicans pretending to be Italian. It's fine to be Mexican- be proud of it. I don't see Italians pretending to be Chinese in Chinatown, or African-Americans pretending to be Japanese in Sushi bars. It just feels a bit ""off"" and makes the whole experience seem like a bit of a sham. Furthermore- and I imagine people will disagree- but I really, honestly believe that Italian food should be cooked by Italians. It's fine to have a few Mexican waiters, or a Mexican sous-chef, or what have you. But at Il Mulino everybody, except for one waiter, was not Italian. Again: if this had been a modestly-priced experience I would have just gone with the flow. But at these prices, they expose themselves to much more serious scrutiny and criticism.The food:The zucchini were appalling. Soggy, drenched in oil, cold, and had been sitting on the table before we arrived. In fact, the zucchini are left on every table regardless of whether people are sitting down or not. Other than the obvious unhygienic aspect of leaving exposed food like that, I thought it was just bad food.  I am very surprised that a number of Yelpers have sang the zucchini's praises. The parmesan and the salame were good but that's hardly a display of the chef's talents. The garlic bread was way too garlicky. The fried bread was good but heavy. The bruschetta was tuuuurible. A reminder of what a bruschetta should be: a thick slice of Italian bread, toasted, rubbed down with a lot of garlic, olive oil, with a generous heap of diced tomatoes mixed with oregano, parsley and basil. Boom. That's it. Simple. Instead? Il Mulino's bruschetta was a slice of bread left in a puddle of tomato/olive oil, making it COMPLETELY spongy and the total opposite of what a crispy, refreshing bruschetta should be. Again, they pulled the same trick with the bruschetta that they pulled with the zucchini: they just had the food sit there until somebody showed up and then they served it. Are we kidding?! It's the laziest move in the book and just not right in any restaurant- forget in one that claims to be 5 stars.Onto the items we ordered.The pappardelle with sausage and mushrooms were good. A solid B. The sausage was just sliced sausage pan-fried, and not a particularly smooth move texture-wise. It felt like I was eating a sausage with some pasta on the side. Tasty, yes, but just a bit ""unrefined"". The mushroom/tomato sauce was good. And the pappardelle themselves were fresh. The tagliolini with lobster were a mess. The lobster pieces were too small, and what's worse is that they were smothered in ""salsa rosa""- vodka sauce. Usually this pasta is delicate, light, aimed at bringing out the seafood. Instead they drenched all flavor with the sauce and it was crap.The seabass was good. They bring it out to the table before cooking it, and it's a beast of a fish, covered in salt. The execution was very satisfying- moist, flavorful, fresh. Overall this feels like one of those sad affairs where New Yorkers get swept away by a strange wave of enthusiasm, completely unwarranted, and made even more aggravating by the prices. Some places I will just never ""get"". This one is at the top of the list.",15,7,3,Roberto B.,"Los Angeles, CA",128,80,2

4.0,9/12/2010,"Very good Italian (though not the best.. i.e. Del Posto, Scarpetta, Alto), though definitely not the best value. However the service was great (how the heck did our server memorize the 20+ specials to so much detail??), and I love that you immediately are bombarded with food the minute you sit down. FREE STARTERS:Fried zucchini - delicious, though kind of soaked in oil. Also it was already at our table when we sat down and was room temperature so I'm not sure about how long it was sitting there for.. I saw other tables where they put out the zucchini well before tables were sat as well.Bread basket - the bread sticks had great flavor & spices. There was also a loaf of dark bread, which was really difficult to break off as they didn't cut slices all the way through.Warm foccaccia bread - oh delicious! Warm and with a perfect slight crisp, and flavored impeccably. Salami - a nice touch.. though a little salty for me.Tomato bruscetta w/ mussels - good, though the tomato could've used more flavor.Provolone cheese wheel - we got a nice big chunk of this. Went well with the salami and bread.We went with three entrees and decided to share. They noted this and actually split all three entrees into each of our plates! That was a very nice touch - no reaching across the table, splitting entrees ourselves, or passing plates to worry about. I'd say the pasta was very good, though a slight bit overcooked for my taste. I prefer pasta just a tiny bit softer.ENTREES:Spaghetti w/ saffron & lamb sauce - great sauce, amazing flavor. The meat was delicious and everything went very well together.Black spaghetti w/ chili sauce & shrimp & scallops - strong garlic flavor, the black spaghetti was good, seafood good.Mushroom porcini ravioli w/ truffle oil - very very delicious, very rich & creamy.DESSERTS:Tartufo - not very impressed. The ice cream was poor quality at best.Marscapone cheesecake - yummm... a very unique cheesecake, as it was very soft and moist, not super dense. Reminded me of tres de leches cake, which I love. You can definitely taste the rum (I think.. some type of liquor), which was a tiny bit strong for my taste.I also have to note that they have a GREAT wine list. Mainly because they had brachetto, which is an AMAZING sweet bubbly red that a server at Centro Vinoteca had let me try after I mentioned that I really like Moscato. Since then I've asked just about every restaurant I've been to for Brachetto and they never have it. We definitely enjoyed our dinner with the wine, and our server made some funny comments about how some of us were going through the wine faster than others.OVERALL PROS:- You get a million free starters immediately upon sitting - great when you're starving for dinner!- Extensive wine list. They had brachetto, which practically no other restaurant in nyc seems to have.- Excellent service, very friendly, prompt, and always available for questions.OVERALL CONS:- Very pricey!! And no tasting menu or prix-fixe, unfortunately.- Atmosphere a little damp - definitely more older, quiet couples. We were enjoying our dinner and laughing (maybe due to the bottle of wine we ordered..) and felt a little loud.- Dont' get the Tartufo for dessert.

4.0,6/16/2010,"This is a great restaurant hidden away on a dingy block next to NYU, therefore I was not surprised to see that John Mayer was at the table next to us on a date with a girl, probably an NYU student that he picked up while trolling the neighborhood for the young and naive. At least the poor-excuse for Jennifer Aniston got a memorable meal out of what was probably a forgettable date.  I wanted to Sue Sylvester him and mention something about the elves and smell of cookies wafting from his hair, but I decided that the smell of pasta coming from the tables around me was so much more appealing.  After arriving early for our reservation and waiting 45 minutes for our table, and then when the host sat a party that was 45 minutes late for their reservation before us, my friend politely objected and the host sent us an appetizer plate and a bottle of champagne on the house.  No one cautioned me not to spoil my appetite on the parmesan cheese, sopressata and fresh mozzarella before the main course, good thing I have a stomach with extra spill chambers like the Titanic, so it takes me a while to sink.  Word of caution- besides the obvious don't date John Mayer- the fried zucchini covered in oil in the middle of the table is super spicy, I guess it's a bread dip instead of an appetizer so don't house it or you'll be running back to the kitchen to ask the chef for a glass of milk, which will ruin the taste of your $20 per glass wine.  I ordered snapper but I wish I had ordered pasta because after tasting the pasta on either side of me I reluctantly went back to my fish, which was good but not legendary like the Fettuccine Alfredo that I tried. I felt like that little boy in the Italian classic Cinema Paradiso...I wanted to run around the restaurant yelling Alfredo Alfredo.  Good thing the food is so great because the crowd and decor are both unimaginative; one table of five men all had on almost identical striped button down shirts, not that I was expecting the Italian soccer team but at least people with good taste.

A perfect meal.The only downsides are: a decor that looks like it's straight out of your grandparents' house in the 80's, and they're liable to overfeed you and it's so good you're liable to overeat.",1,1,1,Matt G.,"San Francisco, CA",49,21,1

The only way I'll eat at Il Mulino again is at another location, Vegas perhaps. Our night started with the server telling us about the specials of the evening. there were about 25. way too many. i know it's supposed to be ""cool"" when the server can rattle everything off but it was cumbersome to try to remember all that was offered. We started with the stuffed mushrooms, burrata, and octopus salad. prob the best burrata I've ever had. the mushrooms were perfectly paired with escargot and an awesome sauce. the server then pressured us to order a couple pasta dishes to share as ""tweener"" course. we got the porcini ravioli and squid ink pasta with langostines. i could have died, both were so good. i wanted a mushroom risotto with broccoli rabe but the server said the risotto with langostines was much much better and basically wouldn't hear of me ordering anything else. while carrying away our leftovers, one server dripped sauce all the way across the table. since it was so messy, they placed a new tablecloth on top, an unnecessary and awkward act. we all had to lift up our million wine glasses. the chairs were at least 25 years old and the ceilings are in dire need of a replacement as they are the same ceilings as in my office. the wallpaper was kitschy and out of place and the bathroom line was basically in the kitchen. since the server pressured us into ordering so much food, we left with three to-go bags. over the top and way too much. overall, food=5 stars, service and decor=1 star.",0,0,0,T S.,"San Diego, CA",12,307,0

5.0,2/19/2009,"Il Mulino is one of those restaurants you walk by and wonder why you haven't heard of it or wonder why it's not hot on Open Table. It seems nondescript and then you notice that there's a guy out front who not only sprays down the sidewalk at 8 AM every morning, but cleans it with soap and a sponge.In time, I picked up a Zagat guide, learned how difficult it is to get a reservation and how my great uncle thinks it's the best Italian food in the US (he's one of those guys I trust with these opinions). I should also note that apparantely they're doing so much of a profit that they shut for an entire month in the summer.So with these ideas in mind, you can understand how excited I was when my girlfriend's family made a reservation there for a milestone dinner. Yes, it's dark (bring a cell phone or flashlight to help read the menu), the tables are close, especially by high-end restaurant standards and yes it can get loud, especially since half the people are there for their birthdays so there's a lot of singing, but I think the quality of their cooking and service more than makes up for it. My chicken stuffed with basil, prosciutto and provalone clearly came with the highest of quality ingredients they could find, while the quality of the tomatoes and mozzarrella in our caprese salad appetizers was the best I've had in the US. I also remember their vitello milanese as a work of art.This place will definitely set you back at least $120 a person, but there are some manageable options on the wine list, including a $75 Brunello which was really good.Some may think that Babbo is better, but I don't even think you can compare its haute cuisine with Wild Game to Il Mulino's more traditional cooking.

This does not stop me from giving it 4 starts.  I see this as more of a group dinning experience.I think not. The table next to us was a large table where the men of the table were in track pants and sweatshirts. I mean COME ON! But let's start back at the beginning. The bar was crowded with people and everyone thought they were entitled to their 3 square inches of room so they would not move and let people in and out of the restaurant. Other then that (one of the things I dislike the most), things were going wonderfully. We sat down at our table about 20min post reservation time, this is expected. The attack of the delicious food begins. Bruschetta, fresh Parmesan, Garlic, and Mussels. I mean MMMMMMM goood!! Why can't I just have all of that goodness in a hallowed out shell of the Parmesan cheese. I would just plop my face in and start chewing. The appetizers we got were salad, caprese, oysters, and this stuffed eggplant. The winner is: the stuffed eggplant. It was a special and it was eggplant Parmesan rolled around crab, lobster, calamari, shrimp, mussels, clams, etc. The caprese was right on par. There mozzarella is soo good it is hard to go wrong. The entrees we got were two veal Parmigiana and a rack of lamb...the rack of lamb drew attention from the entire restaurant. Wow, was it big, good, tender, aromatic, and well yummy. The veal Parmigiana was the best I have had as well. They ordered it pounded extra thin and extra crispy. They were extra delicious.

We made reservations and were a bit late, but we were seated promptly. While waiting for our table, we sat at the bar where a kind man asked whether we'd like to order wine. Well, seeing how the menu had no prices, and the place looked fancy we ended not. I ordered a plain ol' salad because after stuffing my face with bruschetta I was pretty much full. Any carbs or meat would just go straight into a to-go box. My friend ordered an entree that came with three different pastas. I tried some of her pappardelle, and eating that made me wish I had ordered a pasta. It was amazing. Tip: Come here hungry. As others have mentioned, there are many little complimentary appetizers--brushetta, garlic bread, eggplant, a plate of cheese...AND the entrees come with a good amount of food. After finishing our meal, a waiter came by with a big jug asking us whether we wanted to order grappa (grape-based brandy), we said no, but he went ahead and filled our wine glasses just a bit. Whew, after a couple sips I was already woozy. Now that thing is strong! Oh, and be ready to shell out some dollars.

The courgette and aubergine chips are fried earlier in the day, if not leftover from day before, and kept in a tin before being put on plates, waiting for people to be seated. Thus they are cold, chewy and soggy oily messes. My boyfriends risotto was pathetic, the liquid separating from the rice! Total failure of risotto 101!

Everything was rich, hearty and heaping.  For dessert we split flourless chocolate cake and a tiramisu (accompanied by the complimentary grappa).  All simple and perfect.Il Mulino is not for the faint of stomach or wallet - it will set you back quite a bit.  But you will leave smiling, full, and happy.  And Dad's verdict: ""Exactly what I wanted.""",24,5,15,Sam P.,"New York, NY",1869,875,636
5.0,5/24/2008,Best Italian food in NYC period!  Bring your check book and bank account because the best ain't cheap.  Make a reservation way way way in advance and hope they answer the phone when you call.  Billy Joel sat next to me last time I was there and he ate less then me!I do not give 5 stars easily.  This was a no brainier.,2,1,1,Gary S.,"Boca Raton, FL",37,239,79
5.0,5/23/2008,"Small, dark, intimate, and beautiful - My family and I made reservations almost one month in advance for a Saturday night and were rewarded more than we could have expected for the effort.A meal beginning with multiple courses of complementary appetizers; cheese, salumi, garlic bread, italian bread, roasted mushrooms, zucchini, cauliflower gratin, olives, bruschetta...all served within 2 minutes of taking a seat.  Waiters in tuxedos pace themselves adequately and allow you to get a generous sampling of the appetizers before arriving and presenting menus (hardly necessary) before reciting an ever changing menu of 20+ specials from their head in immaculate detail.  Sure, prices are not given and most of the specials top $40, but once you taste the food it really doesn't matter.For our mains, I selected a squid ink pasta with dungeness crab and mushrooms that tasted divine.  The perfect al dente pasta was complimented with a very mild garlic mushroom sauce whose woodsy flavor wonderfully complimented the delicate crab.  The portion was enormous and after the hefty sampling of appetizers I actually had to cut myself off in order to enjoy dessert.  My mother, aunt, and sister who were also in attendance sampled everything from a flawless chicken marsala with a wine sauce that tasted like perfectly aged balsamic to a lobster ravioli in cream sauce with carrots and root vegetables to langostinos in red sauce that tasted like the freshest heirloom tomatoes with only a hint of salt.  Everything was plated creatively, pleasantly, and enormously without a hint of pretense.Having experienced the meal and loving Tiramisu more than any other dessert I've yet tasted, I simply had to sample what Il Mulino had to offer and despite my fullness it was the best decision of the meal.  The best, bar none, Tiramisu on the planet was served in a large square with buttery ladyfingers that held their firm texture despite copious espresso-laden marscapone and a warm yet crispy cocoa crust with the perfect splash of rum and cinnamon.  It was heaven on a plate and even though I was beyond full afterwards I devoured every bite (aside from the few I spared for family to sample....after all, they are family.)  The other desserts, a wondefully thick New York Ricotta Cheesecake with fresh strawberry compote, and seemigly weightless profiterroles wrapped around creamy handmade vanilla icecream with a heavy dark chocolate sauce were equally amazing.Following the meal a delciously complex house coffee/espresso was served on the house along with traditional Italian grappa.  The whole meal took nearly 2.5 hours and cost $300 with tip (no alcohol) and was entirely worth it.No pretense, perfect presentation, large portions for large dollars, and the most attentive and friendly waitstaff I've encountered.  When I travel I make it a point to never try the same restaurant twice, but honestly I think I may go back to Il Mulino the next time I'm in New York.....it is that good.",4,1,2,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",3079,4441,99554

5.0,2/28/2008,"I have been only to the Roslyn location of Il Mulino's and enjoyed every minute of it!!   The service in the restaurant was excellent and the food was delicious.  They bring complimentary appetizers to munch on at the table as soon as you sit down and then the food never ends!  It was definitely a little embarassing at the end of the night to tell the valet we were picking up the Ford Explorer, when the parking lot was loaded with the fancies of cars, including an astin martin.....I highly highly recommend Il Mulino's.",0,0,0,Janna D.,"New York, NY",1,6,0
5.0,2/17/2008,"Transport yourself to Italy at Il Mulino. Tables are coveted and hard to come be at this small, intimate Italian restaurant which is notoriously hard to get reservations for. The food and wine are aplenty here. Once seated, four waiters come by shouting Bon Giorno and come bearing delicious complimentary dishes like a cold zucchini appetizer, eggplant, appetizer in addition to your standard garlic bread sticks to start. The portions are HUGE and I do mean huge, with one portion serving enough for two so don't snack before you go.....actually starve yourself for the whole day before you go. Be sure to order some wine as they have a huge selection. Be sure to try the mushroom ravioli in truffle sauce, it's divine.  All the entrees are good. I didn't even get to dessert. A definite must try although the bill might hurt.",3,1,2,Jennifer Y.,"New York, NY",182,619,2
5.0,2/13/2008,"Fast service, delicious food.A bit crowded while waiting and the last bottle of wine was corked, but since I wasn't paying, I won't complain.This is a splurge place for me.  My heart was working hard to pump around all the extra calories.

4.0,1/19/2008,"The food was really good, but I think this place is more about the hype. The service was excellent since each table has like 4 waiters. I didn't think that the price matched the food, which is why they got 4 stars. I guess reservations are hard to get, but I called and got them same day. New York has way too good of restaurants to try this place a second time.",0,0,0,Mike A.,"San Francisco, CA",10,82,2
5.0,1/18/2008,"Finger lickin' good.No, this is not KFC but the food is terrific.  Five seconds after you have been seated in this small one-room open dining room, you are immediately bombarded with incredible appetizers by what feels like 15 different servers.  A chunk of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese?  Check.  The most incredible fried zuchini appetizer (not breaded, just wait until you try it)?  Check.  Bread?  Check.  Garlic bread?  Check.  Bruschetta?  Check.  I know I am missing some other appetizers, but you get the picture.  Oh yes, it's all complimentary, too.  You don't order--it all just comes to you.The pasta and fish dishes are excellent.  The service ranges from extraordinary to ""Dude, where's my waiter?""  The fact that many (all?) of the waiters are Italian and speak Italian makes the experience even better.  The wine list by the glass could be a lot stronger.  Overall, it's great fun.  It's not cheap but it won't destroy your bank account, either.  You get a lot of food for the money and you'll have a great time.",6,3,4,Craig W.,"San Diego, CA",542,1253,1201

Now that that's out of the way,having eaten here many times when I used to live in NYC (read: 3rd gen NATIVE only moved here to Cali a few years ago), I loved it. The foodquality is consistently good/excellent. The food is prep'd the way you want it. The staff is accommodating and attentive and they have a good (great?) wine selection (OUCH!! PRICEY (like that's a surprisethat this point?!)).They can and will accommodate large groups (I've done two corp.dinners there while in NYC on business) and do a great job of makingsure everyone that the table is well cared for.Highly recommended - except for that expensive part",0,0,0,Zed Z.,"Oakland, CA",8,48,0
4.0,7/5/2007,"I found this restaurant had great service and the food was superb, but it was honestly a bit of a let down.  Maybe because I don't live in NY so when I go there to visit friends or just to visit b/c yeah, well it's fucking NY, I like to get some good reservations.  I don't know how long we made the reservations in advanced, but a friend of mine who lives in NY said going here was a 'must' and I think the build-up was too high or something.Plus, if you're a foodie - S.F. is a really great town and NY is so large, someone really has to know what they're talking about - at least, that's what I think.I wouldn't go back again because I can't remember what was great about it, I just know that it didn't suck.I had a langoustine entree and that was really the only part of my meal that stuck out in my mind because langoustine don't come around very often in SF.The rest of the reviews are accurate so going here is a safe bet, I just think that there are better restaurants in NY.",1,0,1,Lauren G.,"New York, NY",37,206,0

5.0,3/13/2007,"WOW! is all I have to say. I was really scared to try here for the first time because I have read so many mixed reviews and they were all so extreme opposites. Some claiming that they are so nice, friendly etc and others saying they had nightmare treatment, with the staff being snobbish and rude.But when I went every one was so nice and the food was unbelievable.  The decor and the whole freebie apps were very similar to IL Gilio.  I realized there were so many similarities to IL Gilio and that's when I found out about the past relationship between IL Mulino and IL Gilio. I have to say though... IL Mulino was  far better actually comparing now.Very pricey meal/dinner and each order especially of the specials are so big it is enough to share with one other person.Definitely try the fresh buffalo mozzarella with tomatoes,red peppers and of course Prosciutto di Parma. It just melts in your mouth it is truly an experience.  Also we got  the seafood capellini. I don't know what they do to it but it is the best darn thing ever!! So fresh and light. I'm really not doing any justice by trying to explain because I simply can't explain it in words. That's why you have to go try it for yourself!!Also one other thing. I read a lot about having reservations and then waiting another hour but luckily for us it was only about a 10 minute wait with reservations.  So I guess it's all timing. Would definitely go back but not order as much food (we also got another octopus salad and paperdella w/sausage ragu). You will definitely leave there with a bad case of food coma!!  But feel good about it. =)",2,0,1,M K.,"Weehawken, NJ",14,45,11
4.0,10/17/2006,"Il Mulino is legendary. I'll give it that. I've had a few occasions here ( all when my boyfriend's family was picking up the tab, cuz that joint is spendy!). The first was really quite special. The antipasti is unparalleled and I had an incredible fillet mignon. Dessert was a heavenly time! The second time I went, I was sick to my stomach. Everything was just so rich and I couldn't eat for some reason. I could have been sick or something, but I really wasn't able to stick around for too long.

I don't know what to say to that bud...Anyway, Il Mulino does have very ""fatty food"", but I didn't find it to be mushy at all, the pastas were cooked to perfection and the sauces, while rich, were delightful.  What nails the place are the nice Italian folks who work there, who accommodated my friend and I recently by seating us and serving us at the small bar when the room was packed.  The veal was excellent, and I can't remember when I had better Anitpasto.... their bruschetta is drenched in the most wonderful olive oil and all the nibbles are fantastic...",0,0,0,Max C.,"Columbia, MO",59,124,0
4.0,4/19/2006,"Not my favorite, but that could be because I don't really like Italian. There's nothing wrong with the food -- it's quite good, but I don't think it's really worth the price. If you want to go ""to say you've gone,"" go on a business dinner or lunch. I wouldn't spend my own money to experience it.Upon being greeted by a buoyant ""Buon Giorno!,"" I felt transported immediately to Rome, my Spring Break destination. The setting of this tiny little restaurant was cozy and intimate, but nothing incredibly visually spectacular. It was kind of neighborhood family restaurant-style in decor. That didn't matter, though, because the incredible creations coming out of the kitchen, along with the warm, accommodating, gracious service, make you forget your own name, let alone that you're in a little West Village restaurant. Even before reading our menus, dish after dish of breads, sauces, and toppings just appeared magically on our table. We had a tomato and mozzarella appetizer that was delicious. I saved myself a bit for the entree. I ordered a baked fish that was light and flaky. The dessert we ordered to share (a whopping $30 for this single dessert! -- something I would NOT order on my own, by the way) was absolutely divine in its simplicity. A dish of long-stemmed strawberries (absolutely perfect in every way -- they weren't that deep lipstick red color that means the berry's overripe; they were firm and a rosy red but with the same sweet, succulent taste of a deep lipstick red berry...mmmmmmm....) with a creamy sweet thick sauce shot with a hint of some sort of liqueur (""zabaglione"" according to those who know better than I), dessert just was heavenly. We nearly doubled our budget. Yikes! It was well worth it, though, to say I've experienced it. Grazie, Il Mulino!",2,1,1,Audrey J.,"Los Angeles, CA",605,618,78

You leave feeling overstuffed & drowsy, but fully satisfied. All the servers & bartenders are super attentive, friendly, and they know their wines (of which they have a great list).A MUST when you're in the mood for decadent food & even more decadent prices!",0,1,1,Stephanie W.,"Brooklyn, NY",681,670,54
