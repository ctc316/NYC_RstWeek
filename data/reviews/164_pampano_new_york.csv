4.0,4/4/2019,"Great spot. An upscale Latin inspired menu. Lots of seafood.  Worth noting, the swordfish tostado to start is incredible. Dinner upstairs has a minimalist, tropical feel. We've also hosted a private party on the main level with passed hors d'oeuvres and open bar for a party of 30. The service was impeccable.

5.0,4/3/2019,"Had a friend make reservations here for lunch the other day, and although I hadn't heard of it I jumped on the chance to try a new place. And Mexican? Sold! Arrived early and sat in the cozy waiting area, before being led upstairs. The decor here is lovely, very simple and beautiful, palm trees etched in the walls and a very relaxing atmosphere. This place was pretty busy, but I feel like It pulls in a lot of lunch crowds for the upper east businesses, because there were a lot of suits filling the space. I almost felt underdressed. Ordered the guacamole, and then the shrimp tacos, and both were delicious. Very flavorful, the shrimp had a ""bang bang"" type coating that was outstanding! I didn't try and drinks, but their margarita list was definitely one I'd come back for, as well as the sangria! All in all I'd definitely recommend this place, (be prepared it is a BIT on the higher end in terms of pricing, we spent about $33 a person and no alcohol.) however, quite delicious so well worth it! I'd return!",0,0,1,Holly M.,"New York, NY",165,46,164
3.0,3/16/2019,"The ceviche, tacos and grilled octopus, hot lava cake and churros desserts were superb. However, the paella was only fair and the black bean soup was tasteless. Overall, the ceviche was excellent, but the portions were small with a big price and the techno-pounding beat music took away from the experience.",1,0,0,Laurie K.,"Manhattan, NY",49,3,0

5.0,2/13/2019,"Richard Sandoval created a masterpiece when he envisioned Pampano. Just when I thought Pampano couldn't do better, they surprised me with a vegetarian menu and I couldn't be happier. This review is for lunch as I only frequent Pampano with colleagues for a special lunch (not to say I wouldn't go on my own - I 100% would, just don't live near the area). The setting is fancy yet laid back and the menu is just incredible. Service is exceptional and I would recommend making a reservation. Let's start with the drinks. I'm a big tequila fan and the concoctions on the cocktail list are some of my favorites in NYC. The hibiscus elixir and de maracuya (spicy) margaritas are SO GOOD. If you like mezcal, I recommend the Oaxacan fusion but mezcal isn't for the faint hearted.Onto food, for starters: Guacamole, because obviously you have to and it's always a crowd-pleaser. The guac here is super fresh you can't go wrong. Next, for ceviche, I recommend atun and tropical ceviches. They have really unique flavors and are not something you'll find everywhere. For mains: veggie enchiladas are amazing (can be made vegan without the cheese). If not vegan, I recommend the chile relleno or camarones. Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything you order here. Everything is fresh, so tasty and has unique flavors. Sides: fried plantains, rice and beans - delishOverall, I love Pampano for a really tasty, filling meal. Also check out their quick lunch take-away location.",1,0,0,Noelle M.,"New York, NY",243,69,5
3.0,1/21/2019,"I preface this by saying the taco was pretty good and I do eat a lot of tacos.  I ordered a steak and bean taco and a ""mahi-mahi"" taco. Why quotes? Wasn't mahi-mahi fish. It was still fish. The toppings were pretty sparse. I'm not saying they have to be so loaded that you can't eat more then one, meat was cooked great so was the previously mentioned Unknown fish but the fish taco was advertised as having pickled cabbage and there was a little bit balled up in the center made to look like there was more and the steak and bean didn't have much bean. A friend also got the carne asada taco and noted they could have put more onion or anything on it. Hopefully if you go you think to ask for extra and not get charged! Also had the chips and guacamole. Guacamole was nothing special but it was good. Chips were delicious!",0,0,0,Maryanne M.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",1,23,4
1.0,1/8/2019,"The owners of this place don't care about their customers.  These jerks took my order for the taqueria down the street (which by the way same food lower prices) and the place was closed, not just closed but the whole building was closed so like an idiot I am trying to find a way into the building for 5 minutes because they took my order for that address. No one picks up the phone for the taqueria but I know from before that there is a restaurant by basically the same name down the block so I walk there. I get there and they say oh you had the pickup order, no apology or anything for having made me walk around the empty building down the street like an idiot because that was the address on the order. After that for one stinking burrito they made me wait 20 minutes from when I got there (I was already late) and when I went to cancel the order the person upfront goes away for another five minutes and comes back with food. Total time wasted 30 minutes and not even something extra for making me waste half an hour for one stupid burrito. The food itself was ok but not better than any take out. Never going back.",0,1,0,charles W.,"New York, NY",2,40,0
2.0,11/30/2018,"Had a farewell dinner for someone that was leaving our firm yesterday. We were a group of 13ish people, but had a reservation. The greeter told us to go upstairs and our table is the table that has menus. We went up, saw our table, and were walking towards it. A server said we couldn't just sit there and sort of stopped us. Then she got a little frustrated and asked us who the reservation was under. We gave her the name and she went downstairs only to be told that the table was actually our table. I had a bad feeling when that happened. I decided to not be so assumptive because my boss likes this place. So they took our order. The food took a while to come but I assumed it was because there were a lot of us. The paella was good. The pieces of scallops were so small I didn't realize that was included in the paella. The dish is served in a mini metal paella dish which gave the dish a metal/ copper-like taste. I didn't realize the metal taste until later on. For dessert, I got the Mexican molten lava cake. So.... the taste was good, but there was no lava. The center was completely cooked and it was more of a soft brownie moment than a lava cake. I finished the dish but it was disappointing. Would I go again? Maybe if I am able to get a margarita with my meal and if I weren't paying again.",1,1,0,Alice R.,"Manhattan, NY",10,111,4

5.0,8/4/2018,"Team dinner! When the whole team were craving for a Mexican place in midtown east, Pampano became the first and obvious choice. Bar - amazing margaritas. The ""SMOKY"" (when they actually meant spicy) easily triggers curiosity but is not for everyone. Ask the bartender for a sniff of the tequila first and you'll get an idea. If unsure, go with the traditional. Enough perks to keep you drinking and talking at the bar for 40 minutes and you'd still want to stay longer! Food: most of us went for the Restaurant Week option as it was easy, saving the tacos for next time! Oh, their guac and chips were so addicting. Don't forget to save some room for the actual dishes! Ceviche de mariscos - A heavier and less sour twist of the ceviche I had when traveling in South America. Highlight are the crisp texture and mix of seafoods - especially the little octopus. Cod with risotto - Cod is tender and creamy, balanced by the chewy risotto. Already salty enough so I'd keep the flavor light towards finish. Dessert - Some of us had the corn-based cake and found it interesting. Tres leches is a save choice for sure. Will definitely come back for - Mas margaritas!!!",1,0,0,Chelsea J.,"Manhattan, NY",21,29,70
5.0,7/31/2018,"Best restaurant week experience I've had so far! I ordered the ceviche de mariscos, the enchiladas vegetarianas, and the pastel de tres leches. My friends ordered some other dishes, but personally I think these were the most delicious from each category.It's quite easy to miss this restaurant since there are so many nearby, but it's perfect for a nice, elegant lunch in Midtown.

Much to our amazement, we found Pampano to be one of the finest restaurants in this Midtown East neighborhood. Our entire dinner was impeccably prepared and presented -- from the signature Pampano margarita and sangria to the cod fish and chicken mole entrees, to the desserts. This was a very memorable and enjoyable dining experience with superb cuisine and attentive, friendly service. And thanks to server ""Jack,"" our experience was that much more enjoyable.

4.0,4/4/2018,"This review is for the ""take-out"" Pampano storefront, located in the 805 Atrium (lower level).  I've passed it dozens of times but with the long lines - I just skipped over.  So you would start with the basics - select your base, a Quesadilla, taco, torta, or burrito.  Then there's the ""Chicken Enchilada"" which I chose for this first visit.  I am going to guess this was the special as it was listed separately from the others. I just scarfed down the entire entrée a few minutes ago - am posting this review as fast as I can.  The enchilada was plated beautifully even in my take out container (see pic) and the flavors were all there - the stewed chicken, the mole sauce (you get to choose red/green/or mole), the cheese, all wrapped in a fresh corn tortilla.  It was so soft and so delicious.  You can taste the poblano at first bite!  This entrée came with a side of rice (there were corn kernels in there) and fresh chips.  Everything was spot on.  Totally would recommend this dish.I ordered the Acqua Fresca of the day - Passion Fruit.  I enjoyed this very much since I love Passion Fruit, fragrant and very refreshing.  The prices here reflect more of a sit down restaurant dining pricing rather than to go - but it was worth it.  I'd like to return for the breakfast menu - that looked very interesting and much more economical.  Both servers (cashier and runner from the kitchen) were friendly and pleasant.Note:  They have daily specials: a salad of the day, an entrée of the day, and the Aqua Fresca for the day.",2,2,3,Jeannie T.,"Queens, NY",372,532,7611

The menu hasn't changed significantly in a long long time. The service is friendly but clumsy. For example, we were seated but nobody came to our table for at least 10 minutes. The wine list was omitted. Utensils from the previous course were left on the table. Steak knives appeared only after the meat arrived. Glasses were left empty.  A wine chiller appeared after half the bottle was gone. And the list goes on-and-on.

3.0,8/4/2017,"Pampano is a very, up-scale version of the traditional Mexican food that you and I may know it. I felt like I was at an Italian restaurant and had to remind myself from time to time that I was at a Mexican / Latin American spot. I am giving it a 3.75/5 because there is no real differentiation between this restaurant and others that I have visited in NYC. The food is alright and service is top notched. However, there is not a single pull factor that would have me re-visiting. We came during 'Restaurant Week,' so a great time to try Pampano's executive lineup of dishes. It is a three-course dinner and I ordered the following: - Ceviche de Mariscos (5/5). The coconut creme sauce was light and the shrimp was fresh, cold, and well fitted. This was my favorite dish out of the three-course- Carne Asada (3/5). Eh, it was okay. Great presentation but nothing too special about it. The beef tenderloin was a little cold and the sauces just didn't blend in. The mashed potatoes were average - Pastel de Elote (4/5). Pretty good corn-based cake with a smooth coconut ice cream to the side. Pampano may be one of the better options in the Lexington / 49th area for up-scale dining, but it certainly is not the best. This is a new spin on traditional dishes though I rather go for the 'hands on' version of this cuisine",0,0,0,Kenny N.,"Minneapolis, MN",284,188,270
4.0,7/17/2017,"The 4 stars are for the quality of the food. The service deserves a 2 star. The food was delicious we started off with the combo appetizer, I preferred the guacamole over the other.  I had the black cod which came out perfect. The asparagus goes well with the cod cod was perfectly cooked. The sauce on top also went well with the cod, however less of it would of been better. I'm not too much of a sauce person. Service on the other hand was terrible! We waited for about 20mins after we we sat for someone to come up to give us water. We were all talking, so I'm not sure if that played a factor into the show service. My further mother in law had to ask for her water to be refilled about 3 times. It also took awhile for the food to come out. Our reservation was at 7:15 but we did not leave there until 10. This was my second time coming here. The service the first time was much better.

They turn the 6 top into a 4 top and took me back to the same table which was right in front of the service area door where I also requested not to sit nearby.The service was good but our waiter seemed rush and was very underwhelming to say the least. , the food and drinks were delicious but my problem was that all my open table notes were ignored.

They were very attentive, made sure everyone was done before clearing the table and did it smiling. They were all very warm and courteous. The ambiance was very cool. The Latin music, the white linens, white walls with palm trees carved in the walls was all very relaxing. The drinks were very tasty. My boyfriend and I got the flavored margs. I had a mango one and he had a strawberry. The mango wasn't as mango-ey as I hoped, but it still was a good drink. For brunch, I had the chicken and waffles. The waffle wasn't as crispy as I hoped, but the chicken and bacon were- which I enjoyed. As for the syrup, I didn't care for it much. It was mixed with dijon, so it gave it a tangy taste. My boyfriend raved about the huevos rancheros, so I assumed they were good- coming from a Texan. The reason for the four stars was because I didn't LOVE my meal and the waitstaff was lined up against the wall watching everyone eat, so I didn't particularly like that either.

4.0,2/25/2017,"We randomly chose this restaurant while in NYC last week. Yelp pulled in a few restaurants in the vicinity and this sounded exotic. Being a sucker for mexican/LATM food I convinced others to go with me here. It was pricier than other restaurants in the area, so I was  a little nervous.While entering the restaurant, the Zagat rating on the window made me feel more comfortable about the choice. Later I found out that it is a chain by Richard Sandoval.I landed up ordering ""CHURRASCO PAMPANO"" with a side of ""YUCCA FRITA"" with ""DE TAMARINDO"". The Margarita had chili in it, and on the rim, so was little spicy though it was decent. But the food was out of this world, especially the molle sauce. I am glad we went there. Not only this is  on top of my list when I go back to NYC but I have to check out other Sandoval restaurants when I am traveling to other places. Worth your time & money!!!BTW, if you land up splitting the bill the suggested gratuity is based on the original tab not on your specific split.

One more time - the ONLY customers in the place.We ordered Guacamole and chips. I didn't partake, but I was told it was good. We ordered a pitcher of Mango Peach Sangria. It was tasty. It didn't have that slight wine kick though. Later on, we ordered a pitcher of Sparkling Strawberry Mint Sangria. That had the slight kick we were all looking for. Everyone's food was tasty - including the 2 vegetarians (who shared their individual plates - A vegetarian Enchilada and the Onion Hurrauche). As table sides we ordered Fried Yucca and Mushroom Risotto.Now for the fun part: I didn't complain about where we were sitting, but of course (although it was unseasonably warm) it got cold. We closed the doors ourselves. My coworker asked 4 different people for another glass of Malbech, and still had to wait. My other coworker had 2 different plates of food, and still didn't have what he ordered. He ended up eating the Baccalao - he said it was good. I would not return with a group.

The second batch was better, but we were further along in our meal by the time we got it.We didn't order dessert, everyone had had enough (they gorged themselves on the Guac). I think this is a nice place, however, with all of the staff running around, we had too much downtime between not being assisted.

The fluke fish was placed in an a truffle mashed potato puree, tempura jalapeno and roasted corn vinaigrette (Pescado Platija). To my surprise, this dish was my favorite!

4.0,7/6/2016,"Wanting Mexican food we came across this restaurant while returning to where we were staying. If you are looking for chain restaurant Mexican food this white linen establishment is not the place for you. We started out with the guacamole appetizer which is made with serrano peppers rather than the ubiquitous jalapeno pepper. We ordered the spicy version which in fact had a nice bite to it. My wife ordered the Tacos de Langosta which is an appetizer portion. The tacos, while small, were tasty and well prepared. My son ordered the Caldo Tlalpeno de Mariscos which included plenty of scallops, calamari, and clams. I ordered the Paella de Mariscos which compared favorably to any paella I recently had in Spain though it is not served in the traditional paella pan. To complete the meal, we split an order of Churros served with a chocolate and caramel. The Churros had just the right amount of cinnamon sweetness and melted in your mouth.Unfortunately, the terrace seating area was full so we ate inside. We were able to be seated right away.

1.0,5/30/2016,"If I could give a lower rating, I would. I've visited this place before and loved it. How can you go wrong with a great experience? I'll tell you how...customer service! That's how! From the top down, the service was crap. Two friends arrived early , ordered the bottomless brunch and were already eating by the time the rest of the group arrived. We check the menu and I quickly notice the brunch includes alcohol. Two of us aren't drinking and informed the waiter right away so he could make arrangements. This guy tell us since the other two ladies ordered bottomless brunch, we had to also.I'm sorry, what was that? Those are the rules he says, you have to order what they did. Clearly, I must be dreaming or living in a socialist country. I asked for the manager. (Insert nose dive in service and delivery here).  The manager, oh the manager, basically reinforced what the waiter said but with, ""I am the manager and I can do whatever I want but if I do that for you, some people may think you are my friends and I cannot do that. Therefore, I will not change the rules'. I'm sorry, what was that? His pathetic attempt to offer an exchange for no alcohol was homemade ice cream. Would that be a child size serving or the entire carton? Because according to my calculations, the two don't add up to a fair compromise....at the same price. Is there a new math out there? How does that equate? If his disposition & delivery  didn't read ""take it or leave it"",  I would've taken the deal since my friends were already eating. But his arrogance and condescending delivery was too much.  We weren't looking to 'nickel and dime' this guy, but why pay for alcohol if we don't drink? Worst yet, tell us its this menu item or pay more, but you get a free dessert. Really dude? I wish the fun stopped there but it doesn't. The waiter returned to presumably take our order. I explained to him his delivery like his manager's needed work and that I would not be patronizing the business. I didn't order anything, but waited for my friends to finish up so I could go elsewhere. Done? Nope! The manager returns to our table to say, ""I understand you are still unhappy"" (I thought he was going to offer a compromise, not so much!). He continues, ""I also understand that you are talking behind my back. (Is he serious?). ""Do not talk to my staff badly about me behind my back."" The waiter is a snitch. Exit scene.  I've seen plenty of YouTube videos to know this could have easily turned into on. I opted out.  My friends and I were lost for words and pissed that this jerk off had the nerve to return. In addition to his arrogance, horrible customer service, lack of compromise, he has now shown that he is a Petty Betty. He's the gift that keeps on giving.Once they wrapped up their meal, I filled out the entire comment card. As I left, the manager was waiting for us near the exit. I handed him the card and told him I wouldn't want him to think we were speaking behind his back, so I'm tactfully delivering my comments on his crappy, arrogant service directly to him.  I know the card won't make it to his superiors, but who cares? That's the beauty of social media. Those cards don't matter as much as the immediacy of the internet.

Pampano must have known for many weeks that the restaurant was closed for bookings so why the late cancellation? Then three days later, having reserved a table, I arrive with a guest to be be told that the main restaurant upstairs is closed for another private function and we are therefore to be  seated instead in the downstairs bar area. This area, whilst fine for drinking at the bar and casual dining, is a very, very poor alternative to the main restaurant. It even has three tv screens broadcasting live sport. When we complained we were simply told we should have stipulated that we wanted the upstairs restaurant and we would then have been told it was not available.

2.0,1/27/2016,"Sorry Pampano, I really really want to like you more, and I hardly ever give bad reviews as I truly like to focus on the positives which you had a few - the biggest one being your elegant decor and great staff, but that was probably as far as it went.My partner and I came here as you were promoting your brunch menu on Pulsd from which we tend to get many great ideas for trying new brunches at new places. The deal is pretty amazing, $35 for two entrees and 4 brunch drinks and the brunch food menu is pretty extensive here. So might jaunt have been my orders.To start, we decided to get a Guac, and when asked what level of heat, I quickly said mild, I don't enjoy heat (I know. Not all Latinos love spicy). In any case, our Guac came out and in my first bite. I find myself going for water as the piece of jalapeño was actually pretty fresh and juicy (or maybe I am over sensitive to it). I asked the waiter if he was sure it was mild, in my head mild is NO SPICE, to which he mentioned that Pampano puts jalapeños in their mild for flavor... Would hate to ever try their spicy one, but spice lovers might probably want to! Next, my first brunch drink was a Margarita, (frozen machine is broken) so ok, let's get on the rocks, the drink is a great size, looking forward to try the fresh flavored of tequila, simple, fresh lines and .... A ton of sour mix!! I was surprised and crushed, how could such an elegant restaurant with a great chef name tagged to it, serve sour mix margaritas. That is the level of quality that you get a when ordering one from the airport or a pre mixed pouch at the super market. This was no good. And I hate to wine at restaurants, but I could definitely not have this. I love margaritas, I drink them at my favorite restaurants, and when you get a bad one, you should not drink it!! I had to ask if I could return it. It was ruined with the sour mix. I moved on to the strawberry mint sangria. Definitely sounds amazing, yet, for some reason my stomach hurt every time I drank form it. Maybe the mint, I tend not to drink mojitos because they give me the same type of reaction. My next and last drink was a regular red sangria. Again, another big disappointment. The taste was that equal to store bought Carlo Rossi sangria that you just throw some fruit in. Now, I am sure that any respectable and great restaurant knows how to make a simple sangria, and I don't want to say that Pampano is serving store bought sangria, but I will say that this was again not enjoyable. Isis not drink my sangria and left it at the table. All brunch drinks are only $6. Sounds great, so if you Donny know the difference between great drinks and meh, then this is a great deal.On to the food. The Guac as mentioned has jalapeños even if ordered mild. My main entree was the steak sandwich. Two things, my bread was burnt, on one side, which I took off cause the flavor of burned buttered bread is not very delectable to me. The steak was really good! The sank device also has guacamole in it, I did not taste the spice in it which was good, however I did bite into something small and hard that seemed like a seed or wood-like while eating my sandwich. After spitting that part out and taking off the half of bread that was crisp and burned, I found my meal to be pretty good. They served with a small portion (but did not really need too much of anyways) fries. The plate also comes with a nice serving of a mayo-ketchup type sauce to either dip the sandwich or the fries. Not sure for which, but both tasted great when dipped in the sauce! Great sauce! Sadly, my two stars are solely on how beautiful this restaurant looks and the service was also great, sadly, my meal and experience was not amazing. Sad to say, was expecting a bit more on quality, especially when you put the name of Richard Sandoval on this! I'm a huge fan of Maya and I do many of my birthdays their and get friends to go all the time. Sadly, Pampano is not a place I would come back to.Not that I recommend it highly, but it is a great and impressionable place for a first, second or third date.",2,1,0,Evian D.,"New York, NY",425,239,432

Sea bass as an entree. Perfectly cooked. Good service with the waitstaff always available to refill a glass of wine or help out.

3.0,12/9/2015,"I'm not sure what it means if I visited this restaurant 3 years ago but couldn't remember - couldn't remember the name or what meal I had - I just remembered the restaurant once I saw it was beside the Smith & Wollensky's...hmmmAnyways, we went because of a Blackboard Eats special (sampler ceviche! sangria!). The requirement was 2 appetizers or 1 entree per person.Sampler ceviche was three amuse bouce-sized spoons of halibut ceviche, octopus ceviche, shrimp ceviche. The halibut had your typical, vinegary flavor that I like; the other two were on the sweeter side and the shrimp was definitely overcooked.We got 2 apps and 1 entree.Rockfish app - Not bad - breaded shrimp in a thick sauce. Nothing stood out, but solid.Slices of scallops app - Not bad either, but nothing to crow about. Just 4 thin slices of large scallop in a sauce. Those fried purple potato chips I was excited for? Just small slivers, like baby anchovy size :(Seafood Paella entree - the kitchen kindly split this onto two plates for us. Flavor was great - a mix of chunks of chorizo, squid, scallop, 2 pieces of shrimp, and one itty bitty chunk of lobster for each of us - haha. But, still, one of the better paella's I've had - good balance of seafood and chorizo and just salty enough.Total for 2 apps and 1 entree (no additional drinks) was $75. I'm telling myself it's because the seafood quality is above par and the service was really excellent, but it was a little hard to swallow the price for the slightly unforgettable food we got. This feels more like a early-dating scene or a older generation get-together place.Giving this place 4 stars if you enjoy Mexican-style seafood and a nice trendy/upscale atmosphere. However, I probably won't crave this place and won't come back on purpose.",0,0,0,Eva H.,"New York, NY",54,142,19
2.0,12/8/2015,"I had been to Pampano many times several years ago and loved it. Then last night I went back - this time with an Amazon Local deal. Ok, the deal was ""cheaper"" than the full price, but the quality was not even worth the $59 paid for the deal. There was a very limited menu for the deal, so we did not have access to the regular menu. We started off with ceviche. While the sauce was delicious, the very small shrimp were like rubber - these were not shrimp one would expect in an upscale restaurant. Then on to the main dishes. The Robalo was actually amazing, but the vegetarian enchiladas were so ordinary as to have been almost tasteless. Finally, for dessert, the chocolate cake was excellent, but the other dessert - one scoop of vanilla ice cream and one scoop of raspberry sorbet - was like supermarket medium quality fare. Add on the margaritas that we had to the $59 ""deal"" plus taxes and tip and the total was about $120 for a very mediocre experience.

The selection of food was eclectic and the drink options for unlimited brunch was good too. The options included three types of sangria, margaritas and bloody Marias. The best was the Mango sangria (the yellow one)...but if you're looking to be drunk, go for the margarita.

3.0,8/9/2015,3.5 stars for overall service and food. It was my friend's birthday so he picked this restaurant looking to try some authentic Mexican food. Not sure that was what we got. We arrived here for our 1:30pm lunch reservation. We were probably the youngest table - most people were older patrons. None the less we felt pretty comfortable - until 10 minutes after they seated us and still didn't bring napkins and utensils over... (It's okay I forgive them. They were pretty attentive afterwards)Anyway we opted for the fixed menu (menu fijo) because it was the best deal (29 for three course meal hell yea!). We also got a small pitcher of sangria (of course we got carded). The sparkling strawberry mint was probably the best thing about this meal! Coming down the list was the guacamole and chips. Yes! I had more of this than the main dishes itself. Not ashamed. They got some good guac and chips!My friend and I both got the ceviche for appetizer. This was this first time but a totally let down for me. I had just recently visited Peru and had one of the best ceviches of my life... This was a disappointment  - I also didn't understand why most of the dish(other than the octopus) was cooked. Isn't ceviche supposed to be raw?For entree we got the chile relleno de mariscos and pescado platija. They were both average. Although i enjoyed the bed of mashed potatoes on the mariscos more than the main dish itself. For dessert we just got one of each. Standard not made in house.

I told him no for now since I though it'd be rude to order without my friend. Once she arrived, they offered us chips and guacamole which was really good! For appetizers, we both ordered the salad. Entree - I had the sea bass and it was amazing. For dessert, the sorbet was really good.

I'd have to say that $48 for bottomless drinks and food seems like a good deal until you realize that the drinks aren't very strong and the food that is on the bottomless brunch deal is either served in very very large portions (which means that you can't make it worth it) or consists of items that wouldn't normally cost you $48 to eat anyway.

3.0,5/21/2015,"Like anyone else, I enjoy a good taco or bowl of guacamole and chips, but Mexican cuisine and I have yet to fully see eye-to-eye. Pampano looked promising, however; it's one of many restaurants under chef-restaurateur Richard Sandoval, a CIA graduate who spent his early days in Mexico City. Making reservations for brunch was a breeze (thanks to OpenTable), and the Saturday afternoon, we arrived on time and were quickly checked in and led to the upstairs dining room.First and foremost, the space is worth its own paragraph. No other dining room I've been in has had rotating fan blades the size of Pampano's in the ceiling; they reminded me initially of windmills. There's a predominance of white the the ceilings and walls as well, which offers a spacious feeling during the daytime hours. Nonetheless, the ambiance is casual and relaxed, the kind of place one could dawdle in for several hours on end if so desired; thankfully, it's not one of the most trafficked locations in Midtown East.To begin with, our group got the Guacamole, a decision that was initially made at the last second, but it turned out to be the best plate of the meal. There was something so addictive about the dip, a seemingly basic mix of mashed avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro, and lime juice, that we couldn't help but ask for a side order of warm tortilla chips in order to fully utilize it. Seasoned well, refreshing and savory, with an optional punch of heat at the end thanks to a trio of salsas, it made us hopeful for our following courses.The Pampano Benedict turned out to be quite the disappointment, however. Even at first glance it was an unimpressive plate; two small poached eggs placed on top of sopes (instead of the traditional English muffin halves), topped with a salsa verde. On the side were two small portions of a black bean purée and home potatoes, both of which were far too soggy and underseasoned. The benedicts themselves similarly fell flat on flavor, which I can attirbute partially to the dearth of a proper hollandaise, as well as the lack of a main protein (which traditionally would have included slices of ham or bacon). The eggs themselves were slightly overcooked, so I was similarly robbed of the runny egg yolk, which is quintessential to any plate of eggs benedict.Admittedly, the service and the guacamole is what ended up saving Pampano from a less-than-average review. While I can't say anything about the other dishes offered, if the overall ambiance weighs more heavily than the actual execution of the food... Well, Pampano might be a strong contender.",12,6,11,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
3.0,5/18/2015,"This review is for Brunch service,I've had this place bookmarked for over a year now and decided to meet up with two friends here for Sunday brunch. I wanted to make sure they had seating available so I called and was informed they were having a private event that day. The hostess explained they had limited brunch table seating available but they were already filled. She then told us they had bar seating open so once we got there we wouldn't have to wait. 30 minutes later we walk into this simply decorated, clean, classic Latin architectural restaurant. I was pleased with the design of the bar and how comfortably intimate the dinning room was. We all ordered the Bottomless drinks to start ($17 for unlimited margaritas and sangrias). We tried the mango peach sangria, strawberry mint sangria and Margarita. All the drinks were strong and delicious! The strawberry mint was my favorite, I had three of them and I was feeling great lol. Food wise, we ordered the chicken and waffles, chilaquiles con huevo and the enchiladas nortenas. I felt as though the portions for the price point was lacking. Chicken and waffles were enjoyable, but it was really one waffle (cut in four), 2 strips of bacon (each cut in half), 2 chicken tenders (each cut in half) stacked on top of each other and placed on a large rectangular plate (see photo). A slim, lengthy oblong plate would have helped the presentation drastically (at least I think so). My friend said her enchiladas were decent flavorwise but the presentation was all wrong. She received two miniature enchiladas on a large round plate (see photo). Again, using an appropriately sized plate would have given the illusion of a larger meal. My other friend enjoyed his meal fully. The large portion of the chilaquiles con huevo was suprising, compared to everything else we had received. He got two fried eggs, refried black beans and at least two handfuls of delicious chips with salsa and cheese. The presentation was mouthwatering.We were more pleased with the service from the bartender and the taste of the drinks than with the food itself.

3.0,5/8/2015,"I knew this place would be pricy but I was hoping it'd be worth it. I'm not sure it is. It was two of us and we had 4 cocktails, 1 appetizer, two entrees, 1 side, and 1 dessert, and we left $200 poorer. Which would have been ok if I had been happier with the food and service.  Decor: The decor is nice - very Panama City Casco Viejo: light and open and fancy and airy with high ceilings, cool fans, large open veranda and windows, etc. (This was on the second floor - not sure about the first). Service: The service was super uneven. Either having to flag waiters down to take our order, or stop a busser from taking half eaten dishes from under us (this happened more than once). Our main waiter also offered us guac at the outset, and we said ok not knowing there was a combo app deal on the menu (guac and a swordfish dip that I was hoping to try but then after seeing the price tag of the guac - I declined). Drinks: I asked for a custom cocktail (jalepeno infused tequila with tamarind) and it was great. My friend's passion fruit marg was pretty good too, but he switched over to my drink for his second. Food: Said guac was good and fresh. My entree was the chipotle bacalao, and it was decent but way too rich for my tastes and I didn't really get the chipotle taste. My friend's steak was great though, although slightly overcooked (neither he nor I minded this but others might). The yucca fries were uninteresting.

2.0,5/4/2015,"Went here on a Sunday with my friends for brunch. We were seated quickly, but that was the only thing going for them.The service was very inconsistent throughout our experience. My friend and I put in an order for coffee and a soda which only came out after we reminded them about the order. Afterwards, only one order came out within our group of 8. We then waited for quite awhile until the rest of our dishes came out. When the rest of the dishes came out, we were all pretty disappointed in the portions. The menu also said shrimp and grits, but instead of grits they had chick peas.To top it all off, they misplaced my friend's bank card after swiping it for the bill; I'm not quite sure how you misplace a card immediately after swiping it. Our waiter ended up finding the card, but it seemed very shady. Won't be coming back.",0,0,0,Pete S.,"Seattle, WA",250,33,6

We waited at the bar for a long time... meanwhile, we were being told repeatedly that the table we were waiting for was in the process of paying. However, there was no table opening up. Eventually, 45 minutes later, they said all they had was a table right next to the bar, where tons of people would be pressing up against us. My issue is that the whole process was dishonest. They never actually had a table, even though they gave us a time slot for a reservation. We ultimately gave up and went to a cute french restaurant (Matisse) down the block that was great. So my advice is that if there's a crowd at Pampano, don't hang around and listen to their bs, just leave -- there are tons of great restaurants in the area!",1,0,0,Sally K.,"New York, NY",0,4,0

Bright interior and sunlit patio.- Hostess and server were very professional.- The guacamole and chips are absolutely addicting!- The portions are perfect for individual. Our table ordered a mix of brunch special entrees and we tried each other's foods. The chicken and waffles & the enchiladas were delicious.- Drinks are light - but $39 is an excellent deal for unlimited refills!I live in the neighborhood and will definitely consider this restaurant for big parties.

2.0,2/23/2015,"PampaNO!!!!We were looking for a fun Mexican restaurant with modern style and great food for lunch....unfortunately we went to Pampano's.  Worst ceviche's I've ever had.  The fish was chewy and crudely cut.  The ceviche themselves were tasteless and bland.  Hardly any acidic flavor you'd expect.  No wonder getting a table last second was so easy.  I had read good reviews about their margaritas....but I'm not sure why.  Weak on tequila and heavy on sugary mix, the drinks were poor at best.Speaking about poor, that reminds of the service.  It wasn't even the language barrier...it was just plain bad.  When I go to a restaurant I expect to hear about the specials, perhaps why I should get them and specific details on the dishes I ask about.  That never happened.  Not even close.  And after my wife ordered the unlimited brunch buffet, our waiter steered clear, as if to avoid her ordering ""too many"" dishes which clearly wasn't going to happen if you know my wife.  On a positive note...my wife did like the shimp and grits and enjoyed the black bean soup...so there's that.  The prices are good but I guess there's a reason for that.  I don't recommend coming here for good food or good service.  Frankly, I can't recommend coming here at all.",0,0,0,Ryan T.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,10,0
4.0,2/22/2015,"(Note: this review is for brunch only.) Pampano, you sure serve delicious brunches! Pros: food and service. Standard: drinks. Cons: uhh... feeling stuffed to the brim and too full to order the chocolate flan?I was thrilled to discover Pampano when searching for Mexican brunches in the area. I made a reservation for 2 via OpenTable, just a couple days prior to dining, and there plenty of prime slots available (e.g. Sunday noon). I felt slight trepidation... but my worries were for naught.My friend and I ordered the bottomless brunch (unlimited tapas + cocktails for $39). We wanted to eat family style, and they very kindly divvied up the food on two small plates for us. I love when restaurants do this for us. We shared, in order of best to worst (my preference, that is): - Robalo Placido (bass on top of this soft corn tortilla surrounded by this amazing orange-colored (but not orange-tasting) sauce)- Huevos Rancheros (poached egg on top of the same soft corn tortilla, surrounded by the same amazing orange colored sauce)- Platanos Fritos (chewy and soft, not crispy chips. delicious flavor)- Shrimp & Grits (no grits, but one nice, large, juicy shrimp per person)- Chilaquiles (nachos that felt soggy but were somehow delicious and crispy?)- Huarache De Rez (pizza-like thing, crust was a bit chewy)- Huarache de Hongos (same as previous dish)We also had the bloody maria (nice, spicy kick), margarita (my friend ordered this, and I wish I had, too, upon tasting. not a specialty cocktail bar, but this place makes nice margaritas), and sangria (hit or miss depending on flavors).Service was great. We lingered a bit after finishing each round of tapas (they kindly only brought 2-3 plates at a time, so we could enjoy without worrying a dish was getting cold). If you're in a hurry, you might have to explicitly tell a waiter, and I'm sure they'd accommodate. Luckily, we were in the mood for a long, lazy brunch, and that is what we got.Also, to top it off -- we were seated upstairs, next to two very large groups (12+ people), and we had no trouble hearing each other talk!

1.0,2/19/2015,Waste of my Sunday.  Never EVER going back. I call to make a reservation for 8 people for bottomless brunch on a Sunday at 2pm. The bottomless brunch is $39 all you can eat and drink for 2 hours.  It goes up until 4pm.  The nasty phone girl tells me that my whole party needs to be seated at 2 or else we won't get the brunch deal - fine.  At 145 the whole party is there - the useless phone girl then tells me they are running behind and we won't be seated at 2.   I said you have to be kidding me - she said I remember speaking to you on the phone and will honor the 2 hour brunch.  Ok - we wait.  There wasn't even a bar we could go sit at so we pretty much stood around like dopes. Anyway - 225 they seat us.  We. Order some pitchers of booze and start looking at the menu.  It's now 245 and the waiter tells us the kitchen closes at 3.  WHAT?!?!?!  The waiter said order a bunch of stuff and I'll bring it out family style.  So we do.  Probably ordered about 15 - 20 items.  A few minutes later one plate comes out.  A few minutes later another.  We get a few more pitchers and one more plate and then it stops.  It's 330 We ask the waiter - what's up. He said the kitchen is closed.  We said get the manager.  The manager comes over and only spoke one word of English which was ok.  What we gathered was the kitchen closed at 3.....but they left it open for us - until 330.  Well it's 330 so where's our food?!?!  We only had 3 plates!!  How can you run a restaurant where the kitchen closes - and your paying customers haven't eaten?!?! he said we weren't the only table this happened to(so I guess that makes it ok???) at that point everyone is starving and drinking sugar and water (which they called sangria) long nightmare short - they only charged us $15 a person for the bottomless booze.  I wasn't going to pay anything - but some of my friends have a heart.  The worst thing about this place ( if you can even imagine anything can be worse)- was the bathroom was absolutely disgusting.  The animals that dine at pampano peed all over the floor.  Threw toilet paper everywhere and obviously thought the floor was the garbage. This place needs a complete management overhaul.  I did give 1 star because the 3 plates we did have were actually quite good (or maybe we all were just starving) It might be worth your while to pay a little more and actually get food and not have to use a dirty bathroom.,1,1,0,Amanda K.,"Manhattan, NY",1,7,0
2.0,2/16/2015,The best thing about my meal was the cocktail. The combined flavors of sweet and Mexican were not a great pairing for fish.

Also perfectly fried up and super yummy sauce. Wow. Service and attention was perfect.

I still enjoyed this entrée but probably wouldn't order it again.--Seabass is nicely presented and quite tasty.--Chicken: my husband enjoyed this but I don't eat chicken so I can't comment. Yucca fries are good!Prices: Here is where Pampano loses a star.

We were seated on the 2nd floor and noticed the interesting bamboo fans on the ceiling.We had a groupon prix -fixe menu so we had limited selections which was still good.Starting off with guacamole appetizer, Pampano benedict, Huevos rancheros, and finished off with Pastel de Elote (corn cake with coconut ice cream with Hibiscus sauce). For drinks we ordered Mango Peach sangria and Strawberry mint sangria.Guacamole Appetizer  - You can taste that its fresh guacamole on the first bite. There is a good amount of avocado chunks and the chips has the crisp on each bite.Pampano Benedict - You get 2 egg benedicts served over tortillas and salsa verde with home potatoes and a side of black bean puree. My girlfriend likes egg benedicts so this was perfect for her. Perfectly cooked egg benedicts according to her which the egg yolk was nice and runny. The home potatoes was seasonally balanced.Huevos Rancheros - You get a fried egg with ranchera sauce over corn tortilla with a side of black bean puree with three tortilla chips. The fried egg was like any other I tried but with ranchera sauce. It was good but nothing really special about it. It was good non the less.Pastel de Elote - This was recommended by my girlfriend since she sampled their menu for company party. The corn cake was velvety moist and not too sweet. The coconut ice cream was a nice surprise also which too was not overly sweet. The warm corn cake and the cold coconut ice cream with the hibiscus sauce comes together very well. The tartness from the hibiscus with the other flavors will make your taste buds dance. Mango Peach Sangria - This drink is on the sweet side. You can taste the mango flavor and the peach schnapps. Strawberry Mint Sangria - The alcohol is more noticeable on this drink but still taste the strawberry flavorPros - Nice ambiance and decor.

The lobster tacos were small and barely had any lobster in them.I also wanted to comment on the wait staff. While our waiter was quite helpful, he was forced by management to try and push the ""Wine of the Night"", which was a Sancerre at $60 a bottle. It puts him in an awkward position of being a salesperson. I welcome a waiter to make a suggestion for wine when I ask for it, but not to just come to the table to push whatever the restaurant is trying to sell that particular night. I want to be clear I don't blame our waiter since he was clearly under instructions to behave this way.The bus staff was not as sophisticated. They were bumping into each other and reaching over the table to either serve or clear dishes. If this was a small Mexican restaurant, my expectations would be lower and I wouldn't even notice this, but at these prices and with the pretension this restaurant has for high-end food, the behavior of the bus staff shows a total lack of training.Save your money and go somewhere else.

My friend had the salmon and the flavors were so weird and did not incorporate well together, not to mention the fish was overcooked.I will add that in the reservation I asked to be seated upstairs, but once I arrived with my friend they told me that the upstairs was filled and had to sit with the noisy drunks downstairs in the very corner, that was a mood killer.",0,0,0,Christine C.,"Manhattan, NY",22,91,7

We changed and added new things to the menu without any complain or hesitation from Loredana and the restaurant. We had our wedding on a Saturday and reserved both floors. The patio had lots of space for dancing.The serviceWe have never gone to Pampano without feeling like royalty and the staff did not disappoint. We had 3 bartenders and about 10 other staff members taking care of everything our guest needed.  They were very professional but always interacted with our guest and not one mistake was made. Loredana once again made sure that everything was great, from the food being on time to making sure our guests always had a drink in their hands. We have absolutely no complaint from the amazing staff and want to thank them so much for making our guest happy. I have added some photos, I hope everyone enjoys it as much as we did. If we once again had to pick a location in New York City for two new Yorker who love their city and food I would again pick Pampano. This will forever be our special place.",1,0,1,Karinna G.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",1,13,22

5.0,11/5/2014,"Without a doubt one of the most amazing restaurants that I've been too in a long time....if perfection could be described, this might be it on any given day....and I wasn't even here for the legendary brunch nor did I get to sit out on the terrace! (It was a cold night). Where do I start with my praise for this place? I guess upon walking in. The door looks unassuming from the outside and then you open it and step into a lobby....all of a sudden you are in a gorgeous white walled, clay tiled villa. You feel the warmth and the hostess and maitr'd (I guess) greet you right away. The ambiance was outstanding right away - as if you had just stepped into a resort...Our first stop was the bar....a straight walk through the lobby (the restaurant was upstairs). While waiting for the rest of our party, we got grilled pineapple mojitos which were out of this world amazing though we both could have done with a little more grilled pineapple. Also, salsa and chips were served at the bar - the chips are AMAZINGLY ADDICTING!!! Fried fresh, perfectly puffed....The bartender was fantastic, completely friendly but not to the point where you want the person to leave you alone with whoever you came to dine with. Just perfect. As per my open table request, we got a beautiful corner table near the terrace window and decided to dive into the food. There were four of us and we intended to try everything. Appetizer:Ceviche tasting platter of four. Comes with a halibut ceviche, a tuna with watermelon ceviche, a mahi mahi ceviche and a shrimp ceviche. The halibut and tuna were hands down everyone's favorites...I could have eaten that halibut ceviche in it's delicious mango minty sauce all night. The watermelon in the tuna was a refreshing surprise...at least I think it was watermelon? As for the mahi mahi it was a bit fishy and the shrimp was nothing to write home about. But overall, very satisfying. Lobster tacos: OUT OF THIS WORLD!! If you get on dish here, it's the lobster tacos. Very tasty, and perfectly prepared mini tacos. The taco was soft, but not too doughy and the lobster filling had the right amount of heat. Everyone was left wanting more but we didn't order knowing that it's one of those things that you will always want more of. Entree:Swordfish: my least favorite meal of the experience. It was actually inedible to me as the outside was somewhat charred and the inside was basically uncooked and flavorless. I almost spit this out. Cod (Bacalao): Hands down, the best entree of the meal - agreed upon by all four people at the table (we all have very different tastes). It was perfectly prepared and flaked perfectly. Melt in your mouth satisfaction - another dish that I wanted more of. Even the asparagus that it was served over was perfectly roasted with a little charring.Shrimp and scallops: delicious dish. The scallops part was better than the shrimp and the rice was extremely tasty. Somehow I'm not impressed with the chefs take on shrimp. Chicken: AMAZING. This chicken was so soft and succulent. Melted in your mouth and maintained the type of flavor that makes your mouth water. The chicken was the second best dish after the cod. I don't think any dish would have beat that cod. Dessert:Flan: decent, not excitingCoconut sorbet: very milky, disappointingly watery with lack of coconut flavorChocolate mouse bomb with Hazelnuts: OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! This dessert was a true dream. With a soft mousse-like filling and whole hazelnuts, all held together with a ganache like chocolate covering. This was a perfect dessert when compared to any restaurant that I've ever been to...and I don't even like chocolate. The only dessert worth ordering Besides the food, the staff was so courteous and always kept the chips plates full, water glasses fully stocked and cold and the drinks always in our glasses. They served in a timely fashion and were very professional and kind. The ambiance gets a 10/10 despite the closeness of the tables. Lastly, the bathrooms are gorgeous. If you don't have to go, just go in and fix your lipstick. Even with the small criticism in my review, this was definitely a five star restaurant. Hope to be back soon...worth every dime.Bottom line: Halibut ceviche, lobster tacos, cod/bacalao and chocolate bomb = perfect meal (ps, the coffee is also very good and fresh). Upscale Mexican executed well and accurately defined.",3,1,2,Jennifer P.,"Long Beach, NY",266,274,130
3.0,11/3/2014,"Read the reviews and walked in with decent expectations. I had the corn soup to start which was fantastic! However, my second dish, the lobster tacos, was an absolute let-down.

5.0,10/28/2014,"Pompano ennobles the typically image that we often think of Mexican food. The style of the kitchen brings contemporary Vera Cruz cuisine alive showcasing the imaginative menu and fare of Chef Owner Richard Sandoval.The fashionable interior with bright sand white walls reminds one of an modern seaside resort and is bound to seduce you. On the evening we dine, a hip, well-dressed crowd is two deep at the bar imbibing brews infused with tequila and other components. An assortment of tantalizing food plates ring the counter top and everyone is in good spirits. We elect to dine downstairs, one of three areas from which to choose.After the first few sips of the sensational Sangria, likely the best in Manhattan, a house traditional made with brandy, vino rojo and a medley of fresh fruit, we settle down to some serious grazing. It's not often that you find Paella on a restaurant menu, that is, one that is well prepared. If your an enthusiast of the classic dish from Spain you'll want to try their wonderful seafood laced version. A collage of deletable shrimp, clams, mussels, scallops and calamari adorn the fluffy, saffron flavored yellow rice. We savor each bite wanting more. With so much to choose from, we are torn on our pick from the succeeding small plates selection. The well spoken and attentive staff steps in and provides excellent recommendations. Next up, a trio of ceviches features Tuna in a ginger-cucumber broth, Halibut nets mint and mango, while Mahi-Mahi takes on some heat with Serrano and tomato. Each bite is filled with fabulous flavor and inventiveness. Next up, a decadent crispy flatbread is topped with caramelized onion, roasted wild mushrooms, goat cheese and truffle oil. Its consumed in a flash. The kitchen ladles out a hot and hearty portion of sopa de frijol, the black bean soup with queso fresco, sweet plantain, avocado and a crisp tortilla chip warms the soul. Don't end the evening without ordering the Chocolate Bomb which is downright decadent. If your in the mood for a Sunday Brunch check out the unlimited small plates, free flowing margaritas, bloody Mary's and sangria. At $39 its an excellent value for the money.",1,0,1,Carson D.,"Chicago, IL",5,23,0
3.0,10/26/2014,"We ended up here after doing a Groupon search for Latin cuisine. We found Pampano, which turned out to be more Mexican-specific rather than Latin-generic. Close enough.Groupon advertised ""$59 for a Three-Course Prix Fixe Mexican Dinner ($110 Value)."" It turns out the three-course pre-fixe menu was ONLY for Groupon customers so I'm not really sure how they assessed the value to be $110. If the menu isn't even offered to non-Groupon customers, how is it a deal for the Groupon customers?Anyway ...We made our reservation through Groupon, as requested, and were greeted by a pleasant hostess who seated us on the outdoor patio, also as requested. We started with a sangria and grilled pineapple mojito, the latter of which was banging, the former just 'meh'. Within five minutes, we knew the fruit flies swarming the plant bed were going to be a nuisance so we asked to move indoors. They met this request and all the remaining tables outdoors followed suit, presumably for the same reason.Once we got inside, it seemed the problem only got worse. We started killing them one by one, hiding their little bodies under the candle and our dishes. Before they could get into our $42 pitcher of sangria, I used my linen to try to blockade them. Looking around, other tables further away from the patio were swatting away as well. Clearly, our new seating arrangement - next to the patio and aside a huge crack between the windows - didn't matter. Even our waiter acknowledged the flies were an issue, but he attributed it to an unusually warm 68 degree day in late October. Maybe so, but the whole dining experience was just annoying.Now for the food ... Groupon indicated ""New York magazine and New York Times both praised the bold, creative flavors of Richard Sandoval's coastal Mexican cuisine."" I can see why. We were both happy at least with our main courses:- ""Mariscada shrimp / calamari / bay scallops / cilantro rice / achiote-coconut sauce / pineapple""-""Róbalo Placido (pan seared black sea bass / roasted tomato-chipotle enchilada / black bean truffle puree / plantain chutneys.)"" The presentation on the sea bass was stunning.The ceviche appetizer was a little disappointing. (Shrimp / habanero sauce / cilantro / red onion / avocado). I would have preferred chopped U-11s instead of plain old cocktail shrimp, and generally it lacked both seasoning and a kick. The ""Sopa de Frijol,"" however, was delicious (black bean / queso fresco / sweet plantain / avocado crema / crispy tortilla).We both got the same dessert, choco-flan. Very nice presentation, but it had more of a consistency of a cheesecake than a flan. Still very good, though.In the end, we still had an $85 bill on top of the $59 Groupon, all before tip, so the final cost goes back to my original point: I'm not sure the Groupon is really a deal at all. In the end, the service was good, but in fairness, we did have an early dinner reservation so good service was expected. Also, I just don't feel like this place has a Mexican feel to it. The all-white decor is something I expect at Italian and Mediterranean joints, but if they want to go that route, they should make an effort to maintain it. Our booth was in desperate need of a good cleaning.",5,3,1,Adam D.,"México, D.F., Mexico",2035,1515,2096

The day was nice so everyone was seated outside on their little patio - it was 2/3 full but not busy. Their gilt menu was terrific and very generous and not limiting. Regardless, the food/drinks were so good, we will return. We had:- 2 drinks each - I had the mango sangria which was deeelicious!! Sweet w big chunks of mango. My husband has the red wine sangria and then the strawberry sangria (which came w cava). All were delicious, beautifully crafted and perfectly balanced w a nice kick of wine and fruits. Also, they're very well priced at $6! - Guacamole to share - yummy but nothing special. I'd pass on ordering this in the future.- Shrimp open faced quesadilla - robust yet delicate dish. It's a crispy tortilla topped w big chunks of shrimp, arugula and crema. This is a bit filling and spicy due to the the adobe sauce but I LOVED it! - Peptio (grilled steak) sandwich - I don't ever eat beef and I ate 1/3 of my husbands sandwich! The beef was cooked really well - it was soft and flavorful - really well seasoned. Service was great - attentive, polite, knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients, but unobtrusive or fawning. We were able to eat and lounge with calm. My only drawback is that I dislike the location - midtown east. I wish they'd open one location downtown but until then, I definitely would go back.

5.0,9/11/2014,"Note: This review is for happy hour only.I went here this week before a show at Radio City with some girlfriends. It was one of the very few decent, non-touristy and yet affordable happy hours I could come up with within walking distance. What a find!Pampano definitely has a classy, older post-work crowd. We were definitely amoung the younger ones, but it was exactly what we were looking for this particular evening (we were four 24 year old girls). Though happy hour is technically at the downstairs bar only, they immediately offered us one of the smaller tables surrounding the bar area as an option, still allowing us to take advantage of the happy hour specials. The red sangria was delicious and strong enough, and we mostly stuck to that, though one friend had a margarita (of which she also approved). As for the food, we stuck to the bar bites, which were all delicious. The $8 ceviche sampler was the real winner; Flavorful, delicious, fresh and pretty filling; My friend who had the sliders said the same. The only thing was that the shrimp tacos, as good as they were, could not have been any smaller.... Not really worth it.Finally, our server was fantastic - really friendly and charistmatic. Not only did he allow us to order drinks in advance so that we could keep the happy hour price even though it was ending, he even gave us half of our drinks for free.Great place - definitely recommended for happy hour!",1,0,0,Samara C.,"San Francisco, CA",4,70,29

Another reason why I think this place is only 2 stars is the service.  Now I don't know if its just them being stupid, ignorant or racist, but each time my wife and I received or asked for something, the servers would bring it to the table next to us who also happened to be Asian.  When we ordered drinks at the table, they brought it to the other table.  When our main dishes came out, they brought it to the other table.  Even when we requested them for our check, it went to the other table.  Tables have numbers, especially in a place of that size, so why not just pay attention to the ticket instead of just bringing it to the table with the Asian couple.",3,2,1,Mike L.,"Flushing, NY",1,6,0

2.0,8/14/2014,"I really wanted to give this place a better review because I had high hopes for it. So I'll start off by saying the food and ambience was really great, especially the outdoor roofdeck area.That is where the good review ends. The waitstaff and employees at Pampano could not have been less accomodating. I called a MONTH in advance to reserve an outdoor space for a graduation dinner. They told me outdoor seating was strictly first come first serve, which I understood. I followed up several times prior to my reservation to indicate I was interested in outdoor seating if available, including two hours prior to our meal, where they told me no problem we could sit outside.When we arrived, there was only one group sitting outside. Meanwhile they had set me up inside. I literally JUST called two hours ago to confirm outdoor seating. They rearranged and gave my large group a teeny table in the corner. Meanwhile a large table was already set up outside but was empty. I asked if we could have the table that would actually fit our group, and they said no it was reserved. RESERVED? I thought you told me outdoor seating was first come first serve.Our table was so tiny we had to put our drinks on the ground because they wouldn't fit. Meanwhile, the larger sized table next to us remained empty. Finally the group that had reserved the table came. Their group was much smaller than ours and they ordered no food, just drinks. One member of their group was a child, who ordered nothing to eat or drink. When we asked why we couldn't have switched these tables, they simply said the other group had more people coming. More people never came and they never ordered food. For whatever reason they received preferential treatment. Their small group of four sat at an eight person table while our group of eight was crammed into a tiny corner table with our drinks on the floor. Not a single person batted an eyelash when we told them how cramped we were.I was so disappointed I chose this as a spot to celebrate my special evening.

For unlimited drinks (sangria, margaritas, or bloody maria's haha) and unlimited food from the brunch menu, it was only $39! They had a 2 hour limit on seating time, but service was quick, every staff member was welcoming and accommodating and the food was delicious.  They gave us the option of doing brunch family style, but my friend was feeling rather ill and didn't want to partake, which is typically a no no for unlimited brunch, but the server was very nice and let it slide.  She left almost as soon as the food arrived (poor thing was missing out!), but we were very appreciative that there was little fuss from the server.  Thanks dude!  Sparkling sangria - very strong, but tasty.  The margaritas were so smooth and SO GOOD.

4.0,8/6/2014,"I have been wanting to try Pampano for a while because of how cute it looks with the outdoor patio, and also its close proximity to my office! My boyfriend and I have been to one of Richard Sandoval's other restaurants, Maya and enjoyed their happy hour and unlimited brunch several times. We knew based on the food, drinks, and ambiance at Maya that Pampano was a definite must try! Richard Sandoval has over 30 Latin restaurants across the United States, Mexico, the Middle East, and Europe, so this is a chef that knows what he is doing when it comes to Latin cuisine!We decided to check Pampano out for lunch during NYC Summer Restaurant Week. Unfortunately, we went on the most humid day of the summer, so we couldn't make my dream of sipping margaritas out on Pampano's beautiful patio a reality. We decided to sit inside comfortably. The inside of the restaurant was very low key and nice. It seemed very traditional Mexican.To start, I ordered the De Maracuya margarita that had jalapeno infused tequila mixed with passion fruit juice. It was a really nice combination because it was sweet and spicy all at once. To start, we decided to order an additional appetizer to share, since we were going to share the 3 course restaurant week menu between the two of us. Most restaurants I don't think would allow two people to share one restaurant week prix fix meal for two. I was very impressed they allowed us to do this, since otherwise we would have had way too much food for lunch!We decided to order the Ceviche de Mariscos as our extra item, even though it was offered as part of restaurant week since the quesadilla that was offered on the restaurant week menu was not part of the regular menu. Most restaurants during restaurant week don't offer items that are majorly different from their regular menu, and I liked that Pampano's choices were not all items that were on their regular daily menu.The Ceviche de Mariscos was a mixture of shrimp, octopus, bay scallops, tomato, chile serrano, and cilantro in a fresh citrusy ceviche sauce. It was served with some fresh avocado as well. This ceviche I must say is probably one of the best ones that I have had! Every bite was so fresh and tasty, that I wish I could have had more and more of it. The portion was also very generous with a great variation of seafood.For our starter that was part of restaurant week, we ordered the Quesadilla de Pescado. This was served with a beautiful presentation and was already cut into two slices. Perfect for sharing! It was quesadilla tortillas stuffed with red snapper and oaxaca cheese, and covered in crema, tomatillo salsa, and cotija cheese. There was also some black bean puree underneath the quesadilla to dip into, which I thought was a really nice touch, since I am a bean lover!You could really taste the red snapper in this dish, and all the flavors worked really well together. MMM!For our entree, we ordered the Enchiladas Nortenas, which was mexican style pulled pork, black bean puree, and melted cheese, covered in chile pasilla sauce. This dish was also split into two pieces which made it easy to share. The flavors of the pulled pork were definitely unbelievable, and dipping each bite into the chile sauce made this dish fabulous.What I loved about this dish versus our starter was that they were both completely different in taste from each other and unique to themselves. I find that a lot of Mexican dishes tend to be a lot of the same ingredients prepared in different shapes or formats, so each dish ends up tasting the same, but looking different. These dishes were not that way at all :)We also ordered fried plantains as a side, that was not part of the restaurant week menu. We couldn't pass up having these since the waitress raved about them. These were very good, but not the best plantains I have ever had. They needed to be a little crispier and more well done, as some of them were even mushy and soggy.For our dessert, we ordered the Pastel de Elote, which the waitress said was one of their signature desserts. It was a warm corn cake served with a scoop of coconut ice cream and hibiscus sauce. The warm cake went really nicely with the coconut ice cream because of the contrast of temperatures. Also, the corn cake was nice and sweet without being too sweet. And the coconut ice cream, let me just say OMG! So refreshing! It really was an authentic Mexican dessert that we enjoyed immensely.I definitely would like to visit Pampano again and try their unlimited brunch for $39. It includes unlimited small plates and free flowing margaritas, sangria, and bloody maries. I also would love to return for dinner and sit on the beautiful patio! I highly suggest visiting Pampano!",5,1,3,Carlen M.,"Manhattan, NY",370,97,473

We had: guacamole, skirt steak sandwich and a shrimp dish (forgot the name). Everything was great and really cool. Our waiter was great and very knowledgeable. We also had drinks, now let me warn you, their margarita is no joke and you will get pretty drunk if you have two or more. Pampano has an excellent outside deck it is on the 2nd floor with great views excellent atmosphere. Called them about a month after to try to arrange a birthday brunch.

I'm not a huge eater but the portions you receive as part of the Restaurant Week menu don't really give you the opportunity to really judge the taste profiles of the dishes. I  have never seen such tiny pieces of ceviche in the appetiser, it was  like they took a scallop, cut it into four pieces, and then gave you two pieces, I could recognise the octopus in the ceviche, but the other fish was so small I could not discern what it was. The entree was tasty - hanger steak -  but not exceptional, it could  have done with some additional vegetables.

As soon as we sat down, the waiter came over and we ordered guacamole. We then ordered margaritas. Since we were eating and enjoying our cocktails and were having nice a convo, we weren't in a rush to place our dinner order. This annoyed our extremely unfriendly and rude server whose name was Nestor. He kept coming over insisting we order. We literally were only sitting for like 15 minutes. It made us really uncomfortable so we rushed to order. We both ordered tacos and two sides. The waiter asked us if that was all we were getting. He was annoyed we weren't ordering more expensive dishes and rolled his eyes. Now, this really ticked me off because we were on our second round of drinks. It wasn't like we weren't spending any money. I find this behavior unacceptable. The food and decor were fantastic but to have such a rude and unfriendly waiter making you feel uncomfortable can really ruin your evening. I wouldn't return to this establishment.

We started with the dip sampler -guac (very good, but nothing extraordinary) , a fresh, delicious swordfish dip and warm crispy chips. We then had the halibut, mango and mint cevice - again very good. For mains we took the black sea bass - awesome flavors and the scallops over grilled watermelon which were out of this world. For dessert we shared the warm corn cake with hibiscus sauce and coconut ice cream - I could probably have 10 plates of this dessert.The drinks are really great.

Upon arrival you're kind of transported to a place that certainly doesn't feel like NYC - it's almost European with all white décor, stucco and what not. The dining area is rather fancy. To start, I highly recommend the guac. I'm a guac fiend and this was a solid 9 out of 10. For my meal I actually ordered an app - tacos de filete. As noted by others on Yelp, the portions are rather small (even the entrees), but it is what it is. I certainly wasn't hungry when I left which is saying a lot for me. The tacos? 7 out of 10.

My favorite entree thus far is the Mariscada. I spotted two ladies eating this and knew I had to get it. It has more tasty seafood than you could possibly want, all atop delicious coconut flavored rice.Now for the disappointing: I missed the ""para empezar"" indicator and ordered the lobster tacos as a main. The serving was unsurprisingly paltry, but even so, I wasn't impressed by the scant lobster served. My cousin got the pepito sandwich and the meat was incredibly tough to chew and cut through.

2.0,4/24/2014,"I really do not understand how this restaurant has survived as long as it has. I tried it out many years ago when it first opened, and was always disappointed. But, last week, we needed a place in midtown east at the last minute and this was available, so we gave it another try.The ambience of Pampano feels like a mid level hotel dining experience . No charm, with waiters very aggressively trying to push drink orders and turn the table quickly. The staff was also incredibly slow in responding to basic requests: a clean fork, a plate, etc.We had not sat down for 30 seconds before a waiter tried to take a drink order, pushing the tequila drinks. Then, before we even opened our menus, he was back to push guacamole. We ordered Guacamole and requested it to be very spicy. I assumed it would be prepared to order, but within one minute it appeared at our table. Clearly, they prepare the guacamole in advance and not according to order. It was decent, but certainly not very spicy. Better guacamole can easily be found at many places in town. And, if this was the spiciest that they can make, spice fans will be disappointed.For appetizers we shared the cerviche 3 ways.  This may have been the worst ceviche I have ever ordered in a NY restaurant. The 3 fish were tuna, Halibut and Mahi Mahi. The tuna was pretty good and had a nice sauce on it. The halibut and Mahi Mahi were not edible. And, like the guacamole, it was clear that these dishes were prepared well in advance of our ordering them. Or, it certainly seemed that way. And, the presentation was extremely unappealing.For my entree I ordered the miso cod. This was a standard miso cod dish, not much different than other places serving a similar item. It was the best thing that i ordered on this evening. My only complaint on this dish was that it was cold by the time I had 2 bites.In terms of drinks, if you like tequila drinks, they seemed to have a nice selection. If you are looking for fine wine, this is not your place, as the wine list is not that extensive.the restaurant was crowded on the night we dined there, so I guess people must enjoy this place.

There is a soul in all this.On main level there is a bar area and several tables, that are pretty cozy and quiet. There is bigger dining area upstairs as well, I noticed it a bit noisier because of large groups.The staff is courteous without being overbearing, in that perfect sense when you not noticing them, but everything appears on the table quickly and every time you need something, they right there.Of course, I had to repeat guacamole and caipirinha, since I looooved both last time. And it was just as great as first time I tried them. (Note that guacamole comes in mild and hot versions, so you can get the level of spice you like.) Caipirinha is just perfectly made - not often I find well-crafted versions as this one.The flash-seared scallops, served on small rounds of grilled watermelon, topped with achiote habanero salsa, and tomatillo avocado salad were orgasmic good. I am absolutely serious, try it.So was salmon - perfectly cooked, with lightly seared sweet crust on top, surrounded by peruvian corn (I am addicted to this!), chayote and shitake mushrooms.Elegant place and fantastic food - it is officially one of my very favorite places in the city.",13,5,8,Nadia Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",807,756,5427

We all agreed that we would not be back or recommend to our friends & family.If you are interested in why?, here it is: The place is really nice and the ambiance too. We ordered margaritas and white sangrias. The drinks were mediocre at $14-15 each. We had the guac with chips. The guac was very good. Ordered: the filete tacos and lobster tacos...which were very, very small. You can literally hold them with two fingers and you still have fingers left. The taste was not distinct or anything that would compensate the small size. Had it been orgasmic, I would not have minded the size. The shrimp ceviche was not good. We all tried it and agreed.

Mahi Mahi, tuna and halibut for $11. was fresh, light and delicious.the Tacos sampler was good, but probably wouldn't order again. as the ceviche is served with chips, it was almost like a taco, and the ceviche was much better than the tacos.the paella at first looked a little wimpy, but turned out to have large shrimp and other deliciously fulfilling morsels.we were so impressed with the quality of their food, we're going to go back and try their tasting menu, with the tequila tasting.

I had the fluke for my entree and had to resist from lifting up my plate and licking it clean it was so delicious and perfectly cooked!!! She had the tuna ceviche, had a nice spice to it but not overwhelming, very well balanced dish. For her entree she got the scallops, seasoned wonderfully and seared to perfection! Both boys had the mahi mahi ceviche and paella. Their mahi mahi ceviche was good but did not match up to the other ones. The paella was flavorful, lots of fresh seafood, but having eaten paella is Spain, I don't know that anything will ever live up to that.

5.0,1/25/2014,"I just returned from a dinner with a friend at Pampano. All I can say is WOW. The ambience is spectacular. We were seated upstairs, and it felt as if we were houseguests in a beautiful Miami mansion. The fans turning, combined with the white walls and dark tables, made for a beautiful dinner setting, and effectively hid the fact that it was twenty degrees with blustery winds outside. Our waiter wasn't overly talkative or friendly, but he got the job done. We started with the guacamole, which was to die for. The portion is perfect for two people, but I'd place multiple orders if you're with a foursome or larger group. It was flavorful and creamy, with chunks of avocado. Very fresh tasting. The accompanying tortilla chips were delicious as well, thicker than anything you buy at the grocery store and not overly seasoned. The guacamole was clearly the star of the show, and the chips were just part of the supporting cast. We decided that we were going to order a bunch of appetizers and share instead of mains. We got the tacos de langosta, quesadillas de pescado, and the empanadas de camarón. All three were delicious and beautifully presented. My only complaint is that they are on the smaller side. If you plan on ordering a main course, they are probably filling enough, but if you plan on making appetizers your meal, I'd plan on ordering at least two per person. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate hazelnut bomb and the churros. The former was chocolatey and rich, definitely more of a typical restaurant dessert. The churros were out of this world: light, fluffy, and sweet, and the accompanying chocolate dipping sauce was spectacular as well. All in all, quite the solid experience at Pampano. The ambience is spectacular, and the food is delicious. It is definitely more on the expensive side considering what you get, but the food here is about quality rather than quantity. You will experience pleasant fullness afterwards. Total for guac, three appetizers, and two desserts came to $85 for two people, not including alcohol or tip.",3,0,0,Taylor M.,"New York, NY",0,4,0
3.0,1/20/2014,"Took my friends here for Sunday brunch to ask them to be in my wedding party. Got the Groupon deal for 4 (~$49) for 4 brunch entrees and 4 cocktails total. We had a fifth person, so just planned to pay separately for that. The guacamole was better than I thought, but small quantity. Between all of us we had the chicken with waffles, banana rum pancakes and the spanish omelette. Pancakes were good, chicken and waffles also good but beware they are more like chicken fingers, NOT on the bone, and I didn't try the omelette but my friend seemed to enjoy. What got me is that they charged the most expensive brunch for the add on (4 of us ordered an entree at ~$12), but they charged the extra for the spanish omelette. Very petty. Drinks were okay, but didn't taste all that fresh. We got the mango peach sangria and sparkling strawberry mint sangria. Both were just eh for me. The saving grace of this place was the space. Very open, light and airy.. it'll transport you to Miami/Florida.",1,0,0,Lindsay B.,"New York, NY",462,232,791
3.0,1/13/2014,"Pampano has fancy dining written all over it. From brightly lit rooms to shiny tableware, Pampano is a nice place to enjoy a meal, brunch included. In addition, service was splendid, especially the reception, which welcomed us with smiles and a coat check option. Wow, how many restaurants do coat checks anymore. Ordering from the brunch menu, I got to try:Bloody Mary - Too spicy for my taste and had a tad bitterness to it but I got used to it after drinking half the glass. It works great in cleansing the palate. (6/10)Chicken and Waffles ($14.00) - Three pieces of waffles, each topped with a piece of fried chicken and a strip of bacon. The waffle was soft and spongy with a mild flavor that served great as a canvas for the bolder flavors of the smoky bacon and delicious dijon maple syrup. The chicken was also very crispy. (8/10)Shrimp and Grits ($17.00) - I think this dish is pricey for just 4 pieces of shrimp and hominy. Eating the hominy was like eating chickpeas. The shrimp was kind of bland and not spicy as advertised. (6/10)It is worth mentioning that Pampano puts a Latin touch to the brunch menu. Think huevos to quesadillas. I am a fan of brunches menus that are more culturally themed. While the restaurant is visually appealing on the eyes, nothing particularly jumped out at me on the menu.",5,0,2,Tony C.,"New York, NY",103,284,650

3.0,1/9/2014,"After dining here for dinner a few months ago and loving it, my boyfriend and I bought a Groupon for a brunch deal. We finally used it this weekend, and I have to say brunch is not worth it here. The dishes were so tiny that we were still hungry afterwards. I ordered the pancakes with caramelized bananas, maple rum and bacon and received three small, silver-dollar sized pancakes with one strip of bacon ripped into three pieces, and no bananas with rum - I had to ask for it twice, and never received an apology. My boyfriend ordered the huevos revueltos and it was basically scrambled eggs we could have just made at home. Our service was also pretty bad, considering we arrived right when they opened at 11:30 and there were maybe 5 other tables in the restaurant. Our waiter generally ignored us - maybe because we were using a Groupon? Not sure.I would still go back for dinner in a heartbeat, but would highly recommend that everyone skip the brunch and save your money, or go to one of the other great brunch places nearby.",2,0,1,Tara J.,"Manhattan, NY",56,110,3

So good!  The chicken and waffles were incredible, and so were the pancakes.  And, of course the drinks were great.  I was a little weary to go back for dinner a few weeks later after having such a good experience with brunch.  However, I don't know how it's possible, but dinner may have even been better than brunch.  We started off with the filet and lobster soft tacos for appitizers. Both were delicious and seasoned to perfection.  The appitizers are very small though.  Do not think about ordering just one as your main meal.  Next we had the corn puree soup.  The presentation was just as amazing as how it tasted.  Main course was a filet tenderloin with white bean puree and grilled aspargus....phenomenal.  Dessert was flan and churros.  The flan was very small, but the churros were plentiful.  Both were very good.  Besides the service at Pampano, my favorite this has to be the flavors.  All of their dishes are flavored to absolute perfection.  This place really knows what it is doing.  Definitely one of my new favorite places in the entire city.  Bravo.  Keep on doing what you're doing.",0,0,0,Danielle G.,"Queens, NY",0,8,0

5.0,8/6/2013,"Came here for lunch with my boyfriend during restaurant week on a whim - everything was great! We were clearly the youngest in the place, but we were treated as well as everyone else. We split all of our dishes (ceviche, quesadilla, pulled pork, hanger steak, ice cream, and another dessert whose name I've forgotten) and every one was delicious. The hanger steak was definitely the best as was the cake dessert with coconut ice cream. My favorite thing about this restaurant was probably the decor. So light and refreshing - I felt like I was on a quiet Spanish beach (or...in Mexico heh). We were on a somewhat tight schedule and the waitstaff was very quick/efficient. If I wanted to be VERY picky, our ice cream dessert was a little melted when they brought it out, but nothing too bad.

Perfect weather to be sitting on their balcony/patio and indulge in their Restaurant Week offerings :-)I always appreciate it when the bartender can fine tune a drink to match ones taste. The jalapeno and passion fruit margarita hit the spot as they turned down the passion fruit and amped up the heat.From the Prix Fixe offerings I went with the Ceviche and then the Hangar Steak.

I was seated on the second floor, and the vibe is very relaxed and beachy. The walls had palm trees painted on it, and there were wooden ""fans"" hanging off of the ceiling. I did not get an appetizer, although the person I was with ordered the Ensalada Con Alemndras (almond salad), and she definitely recommends that. For my entree, I got the roasted poblano pepper stuffed with mixed seafood. The dish was fairly good (especially with the sauces drizzled over it) and the seafood was seasoned well. However, I wish the pepper had more flavor. Also, the dish was on the smaller side. The highlight of my meal was the dessert. I ordered the corn cake with coconut ice-cream. Corn and coconut goes surprisingly well together (who would have thought)! The cake itself was soft, moist, and buttery. The ice-cream was refreshing, and its lightness was a perfect balance to the cake. I would come in here again.

The ceviche was actually pretty flavorful and the seafood was fresh. Sadly, the food went only downhill from there. The chips and guacamole were average. The worst dish, by far, was my entree, the pescado platija. Had I known that Pampano was middling at best, I certainly would have avoided a dish that included ""truffled"" anything. Unfortunately, I was not so informed. So the pescado platija was a disaster--I actually wondered if someone spilled an entire bottle of truffle oil on my plate. As I was hungry, I managed to get through the entire fish, but had to leave much of the accompaniments on the plate.Bottom line: Another mediocre Midtown restaurant that's not worth a visit.",2,0,0,Michael C.,"New York, NY",6,76,2
4.0,6/3/2013,"This place had really good food, and, although their original menu isn't vegetarian friendly, you can take the meat out of pretty much anything and sub in roasted vegetables. I got the pepito, which was a mistake only because it was way too much food for me. I barely finished half of it, sadly. It was really good, though! I also got the cafe de olla, which is an orange, cinnamon coffee. It was amazing! I didn't add any sugar, and I was so satisfied afterwards. The coffee flavor wasn't overpowering, so you actually had real orange and cinnamon flavors rather than just ""hints"" of it!The dessert looked really good, but I was too full to even fathom it. All in all, I'd come here if I had someone to split an entree with because it's a lot of food (and Mexican food is heavy in general), but it was great.Also, the tortilla chips have the thickness of pita chips!

Bacalao Negro chipotle-miso marinated black cod / asparagus / citrus-tequila aioli  - delicious.  Fish was cooked nice and tender and the flavor of the dish was amazing.Merluza chilean sea bass / roasted fingerling potatoes / tomato-olive sauce / pickled poblano peppers - not as good as the black cod (the miso sauce on that one is a lot more flavorful).  But fish was still cooked well and dish was good.Theyre known for their seafood and I will definitely be back when I get a seafood craving!  Great place!,0,0,0,Kate K.,"Queens, NY",27,131,15

So good. And if you check in on yelp its free!! The tamarindo margarita was also delicious/perfectly crisp. Although not sure if it was delicious bc the tamarindo flavor perfectly covered the alcohol or if they didn't put that much alc....my happy woozy stumble from the restaurant however would suggest the former.Got the ceviche tasting platter for a late lunch and it was absolutely delicious and fresh! The tortilla chips that came with the platter and as an appetizer (instead of bread) was so very crisp and delicious. Going around from the far left clockwork (sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/h…)Mahi mahi had the most tender taste. Very fish like but in the good way! The sauce was a perfect compliment.Tuna reminded me of a shrimp cocktail only with fish. Meh.Halibut had a nice tarty sweet taste with the mango.If you are only gettin one though go with the marischos if you're okay with shellfish. Absolutely deeelectable. Rich sauce but not overwhelmingly so. I'm a big fan of purple onions and these are very finely sliced.Got a desert with the most amazing caramelized banana bits and really succulent sweet condensed-milk Mexican sponge cake. The mango sauce was orgasmic. ORGASMIC.I went to a LOT of ceviche places on my weekend in NYC and this is definitely the one that I would come back to over and over.  The price point was perfect - $32~ for the tasting platter, other delicious looking/sounding appe and entree options for $10-30, $5-10 for dessert, $10-15 for drinks.

I did not taste the mango at all.MAHI MAHI (mahi mahi / citrus-tomato / chile serrano): absolutely loved this ceviche.  It was fresh and full of mahi mahi goodness.GUACAMOLE (avocado / tomato / onion / cilantro / tortilla chips): it was a great guacamole.  It had the right amount of each ingredient with no particular ingredient overpowering the others.NACHITOS (manchego / cabrales / cheddar / adobo pulled pork / black beans / pico de gallo / crema):  Pretty much like any other nachos.  Nothing special.MEATBALLS (beef & pork / tomato-chipotle sauce): the meatballs were small and the sauce was nothing spectacular. But it did come with melted cheese.TACOS SAMPLER (smoked swordfish / chilorio (pork) / rajas con queso): small tacos with a lot of flavor, but not necessarily a good thing.  The pork in the chilorio taco was a bit too spicy and tough.  Also the rajas con queso tasted like a seafood salad with too much cream sauce despite the fact it did not contain any seafood.SKIRT STEAK MASA FLATBREAD (caramelized onion / serrano pepper puree / manchego): when I think of flatbread, I actually think of a flat bread that still maintains the chewy goodness that bread usually has, but this ""flatbread"" is similar to matza.  However, the flavors were great and the steak was cooked well.The restaurant space is really nice and big, although the music can be a bit too loud.  The sangria was delicious and I also definitely appreciate the happy hour prices on margaritas.

2.0,4/29/2013,"This is a review for having a larger party (13 people) meal at Pampano. The experience was so outstandingly bad I created a Yelp account to write a review. ------------------------The Good:- Food and drinks were nice- They brought a dessert for the person whose birthday it wasThe Not So Good:- I appreciate they accommodated us, but for those who have a choice, NEVER BOOK THE ""SEMI PRIVATE ROOM."" Dark, bad decor, worst table in the house. Disappointing given the nice sunlit main dining area.- Food portions are small, just be aware.THE EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTINGLY BAD:- THE **SERVICE** THE **SERVICE** THE **SERVICE**- No attention, LONG waits for all orders, multiple mistakes on the food, tried to blame the customer for their mistakes. - I as the organizer of the meal is embarrassed by all the bad service despite having coordinated in advance with their manager,  the person who suggested that we go here is embarrassed she made this suggestion.------------------------For those who are interested in the details:------------------------The ""Semi Private Room"" - Never Book It------------------------- We booked 2 days prior, and they were not able to seat us in the main dining room and offered us the ""Semi Private Room"", which we had to sign a contract to reserve and has a spending minimum. Not an issue for us, and the manager I dealt with was nice. I appreciate they tried to accommodate us, HOWEVER, the space is in fact the worst table in the house. The main dining room on the 2nd floor is airy and nice, but this table is in back end of the 1st floor with no windows, just screened off with some wood/bamboo panels. There was no natural light, the decor was dark and drab, the a/c vent is right above the table (it was so cold we asked the staff 2-3 times to turn down the a/c before any improvement).- Also, you get no attention from the waitstaff seated there. See next point.------------------------The Service - Ignored, Long Waits, Mistakes, Tried to Blame the Customer------------------------- No attention or service on the the 1st floor. The main dining room is on the 2nd floor, and as one of only two tables seated on the 1st floor, we never got any help or attention. The only time anyone was there is to deliver an order, but not once did they come to check how we were doing or if we needed anything. When we needed something I had to walk to the entrance of the restaurant to ask the hostess to get a wait staff to help us. I did that 4 times during our meal. Had to hound them to even take orders.- Completely inefficient with orders. e.g., they brought half the drinks and did not bring the other half for a LONG time, same with the food (more on that next); we ordered entrees with sides and the sides did not come until everyone had finished their entrees and people didn't even have their silverware anymore because their plates have been cleared away. They were sides not desserts so why were they served after??- Messed up the food orders COMPLETELY. We were a large party, and we were asked to submit our entree choices in advance. I emailed them the list of entrees and also gave them a few appetizers we'd like to start with. I confirmed with the manager the day before and she said she had made a note of the selections but the waiter will confirm where people are sitting and confer with me on the appetizers. It started out okay -- the waiter suggested we double the order of appetizers, the drink order took forever but the appetizers came at a reasonable speed. After that we were ignored for a long time and the waiter never came back to confirm our food order, I had to go out to the hostesses to get them to find someone to help us. When the waiter did come back, I started telling him where people were and what they ordered, but finally gave him the printed menu I had marked up with names and put numbers to the names as he indicated the seat numbers to me. I had thought our food should be in the process of being prepared since we had submitted our order the day before and they just need to know what goes where, but apparently the waiter only put in the order right then. And he got confused as to what people were ordering from the list so after a LONG wait over half our order came out wrong. Then the waiter blamed me that my list was confusing -- to which I said, 1) if you are unclear in anyway you should ask; 2) we sent you a list of food orders yesterday already?? We kept a couple of the wrong items just to have something to eat while we wait which they charged us for. Objectively I had no problem paying since we ate it but there's really no courtesy offered to us.They tried to make it up by giving us a dessert for the person who was having a birthday and gave us a round of tequila shots, but the damage is done. We brought in $800+ (before tip) of business, and the level of service we received was shameful. I will not be sending any further groups or clients here. Ever.",3,0,0,Mimi K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0

We finally settled on the guacamole for the table, a selection of ceviches and the lobster tacos. Portions were on the smaller side - enough for 3, but for our party size, food was a little stretched. The mains on the other hand were a fairly good shareable size. Pampano serves one of the BEST paella's i've tried. I would highly recommend this dish. Another winner was the black sea bass with black bean puree, sweet plantain chutney in roasted tomato chipotle sauce.  What I loved most about the desserts is that they were your traditional tres leches cakes and flans with unique twists to them. I'm usually a chocolate lover, but their ""Tarta Nuez"" - Vanilla Shortbread, Milk chocolate panna cotta and walnut clusters was simply heaven. Would definitely return.

I went here for my birthday and we ordered Tapas... I know Tapas are suppose to be small but the portions here are ridiculous and the prices are outrageous. 2 pieces of tortilla chips with some veggies are $11. I'm talking about bite size little things. If it tasted good then I wouldnt even argue the price but it was just really bad. We also ordered the angel hair pasta tapas and that was the worst!!! It tasted like chef boyardee canned Saghetti. I was so disappointed that I asked for the check and didnt even order entrees as I wanted to leave. And they brought my check with gratuity of 20% added onto our bill!! It wasnt a large party. We only had 3 people in our group and this is what they tried to charge. Ridiculous!!!

3.0,12/22/2012,"Plan A was to go to Dos Caminos, but the wait was an hour (holiday party season?), and I recalled reading good things about this place.  I was underwhelmed - especially for the price...- Shared an order of guacamole- Entrees- Three margaritas each$100 per person.  Just seems a bit steep, even for Manhattan.  Perhaps on a warm summer night sitting on the patio I'd feel different.  My biggest disappointment was my main - I decided to have the four ceviches as a meal.  That in itself was completely fine, but I wasn't a fan of the ceviches.  I think of ceviche as being a delicious combination of seafood, citrus, spices and possibly a small amount of fruit or choice veggies.  This seemed to have that, but then it was covered up by creamy sauce in all of them.  And the one sauce tasted almost like ketchup to me.  Blah.  Completely edible but not what I'd call great ceviche.Margaritas went down like water, and at $14 a pop that's a shame.  I suppose you could argue they were ultra-smooth, but I honestly wonder how much tequila they really had in them.My friend's paella looked quite good, but I can't comment on it.  Guacamole was good, but not $14 worth (Dos Caminos is definitely better).I wouldn't run back... but I wouldn't resist going either.",0,0,0,Brian P.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",1,44,1

4.0,11/18/2012,"YUM. Tasty little tapas served in the downstairs area of Pampano, now the Botaneria, were imaginative and delicious.  Went late Saturday night.  Had the guacamole to start, which is more flavorful than most, but if you are going to Pampano for the first time, have the swordfish dip, which is sensational.  I  tried it twice before at the regular restaurant upstairs, and it is fabulous - like the best smoked whitefish/sturgeon salad you've ever had.  We tried the bacon-wrapped dates - this actually works, the meatballs in a tomato-chipolte sauce - excellent and a nice suble twist on the usual Italian sauce,  the fingerling potatoes w/ chorizo/chipolte sauce - very salty and good, and the duck risotto - my favorite of all. The last dish we had was the filet mignon skewer, with cabrales ( a Spanish blue cheese) sauce.  The filet was tender, the sauce good - hey, it's blue cheese, but you should know that it is two quite small pieces of meat served on a cutting board with a small ramekin of sauce. Each of the chunks is about two bites.  Tapas are small plates, we know that, and Botaneria charges from about $ 5 - 9 for them  (most plates have about three pieces) - not unreasonable for such good quality, but $16 for the filet is high.  I would order two more interesting things for a better value.  Desserts were light and fluffy churros ( quite different from my previous exposure to the subway vendor kind) with a dark chocolate sauce and three excellent strongly flavored tiny lemon tarts.  Plain but pleasant atmosphere with a small bar.  Quieter tables as you go toward the back.  Try the sugarcane margarita if you like a very powerful, interesting drink.  The others I've tried upstairs, hibiscus and tamarind, are, for me, overly sweet.  Service was good - helpful in pacing the meal.",0,0,0,Amber S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0

My husband's tenderloin perched atop a delicious mix of white beam purée was balanced with a tart yet savory wild mushroom escabeche. The tenderloin, while it had good flavor, was  cut in funky pieces of varied thickness and the asparagus that graced both our dishes was put on the plate with its tough stalk ends in tact... A careless or lazy decision. The Sommelier helped us pick the perfect wine however our dinner arrived so shortly after ordering we were only halfway through our pre dinner martini (they were out of my favorite vodka)... So timing was less than perfect. Since I'm a dessert gal, we decided to give the postres a go.

I had the Paella for the main dish, which was packed with fresh seafood; delicious. I had to take some of it home there was so much. My friend got the Caldo de Mariscos and she enjoyed it just as much as I enjoyed my Paella, thankfully, I got her leftovers. We finished up with a excellent, smooth tall cup of cappacino and called it a night.  The restaurant is beautiful and is a great place for a date celebrating a nice occasion. We sat outside, which was great since it was a perfect summer night.

3.0,7/11/2012,"*sigh*Wannabe upscale Mexican seafood. Pampano tries to be what Rick Bayless carries off so wonderfully in Chicago, but fails greatly in its attempt.I preferred the drinks over the food. The passion fruit margarita was delicious -- light tasting, not too fruity, but packed with alcohol. My sister ordered the lobster tacos for her entree. The waiter tried to dissuade her from it by warning her that they were really small and were meant as appetizers. She insisted she wanted the lobster tacos. The waiter answered, ""Okay"" in a tone of voice that said, ""It's your funeral.""Well, he was right. They were the three tiniest tacos we had ever seen. Even tinier than Barrio Chino and anyone who has eaten there knows how small those tacos are.My mother and I ordered the black bass, which was fine. The food was plated to look like abstract art. The food was competently cooked, meaning that everything tasted fine, but it was very forgettable.My boyfriend ordered the Chilean sea bass (which I didn't like because it's not sustainable). I snuck a taste. It tasted like my bass. Hmmm . . .It was a pleasant enough meal, but I don't think anyone of us is eager to go back. I'd be willing to have drinks there again. But at the bar.The server we had was very pushy. He tried to insist that we get two orders of guacamole and chips (one was ample for five people), a little rude and disappointed-sounding when we didn't want wine, and practically tried to shove us out of our table when we were lingering after we had paid our tab. Since he couldn't drag us out of our table, he stole our candle off the table as a signal for us to leave. It was a slow night and certainly we were not holding anyone up by staying a little longer. The service we received from Pampano makes it tempting to give it two stars, but I feel that would be insulting the cooks who did nothing to warrant that. Overall, I feel this place is overpriced for what you get, especially with the terrible service from that waiter.",7,3,3,Elle P.,"Brooklyn, NY",346,870,25

Also had the pulpo a la parilla. I wouldn't have called that grilled octopus ""grilled,"" as the texture was rubbery as if it were boiled. For mains, dining partner found the chilean sea bass rather boring. I quite enjoyed the chipotle-miso marinated black cod, it tasted vaguely Asian-fusion, and was over-marinated. We also had a side of yucca fries. The fries themselves tasted like they'd been sitting out for a while, but I loved the citrus sauce that was drizzled on top.The service was prompt, but not that friendly, and I found the dining room manager rather arrogant.Overall, don't really a see a reason to come back.

We ordered 2 margaritas.  1 tropical for me and regular for the BF. I loved mine the BF said his was ok. We ordered the shrimp empanadas and some other shrimp appetizer. The empanadas were very tiny! Good, but more of an amuse than an appetizer.  After that we ordered entrees. But I consulted with my server since I was stuck between 2. He told me the sea bass, and I love Chilean sea bass. except this dish. The flavors didn't mesh well for me. I couldn't eat it. Luckily my BF was still hungry from finishing his steak dish and he didn't mind it.

The server never checked in with us during the meals, just after we were done eating. We order dessert, the corn cakes with coconut ice cream very good! The prices were really high.

I've had the Pampano lite downstairs in the Atrium and I liked what they offered down there so my expectations were pretty high. We had a 3 course meal arranged for us and I picked the Ensaladas de Mariscos, Pollo el Yuccateco and for dessert the Pastel de Elote. Ensaladas de Mariscos - Aka seafood salad. This was simply phenomenal, I mean absolutely amazing. The seafood was hot and fresh, a calamity of shrimp, calamari, octopus and scallops. It all contrasted so brilliantly with the baby spinach and lemon vinagrette. I would come back just to eat this. Pollo el Yuccateco - this was ok in retrospect but at the time I thought was pretty good. The chicken was slightly, just ever so slightly on the dry side. I found the sauce a little salty but the dish had great presentation and tasted good. What disappointed me was the yucca fries. I've had fresh yucca fries in Costa Rica and they just tasted out of this world, picture french fries with better flavor and a firmer exture. These yucca fries weren't quite as good, they were a little harder and had more of a grainy texture. I guess it's not fair to compare yucca in NY to fresh stuff in CR though. Pastel de Elote - Coconut ice cream is to die for. Really, I mean to die for. The cake is ok and the sauce had a nice tarty kick but the ice cream... is just delicious. Overall I'd give this place 4 stars, the presentation is top notch and the good was all very good to excellent with a lot of variety inbetween.

Bright tasting with just the right balance of sweet and tangy. Just thinking about it now is making my mouth water.  I definitely would go back for more of that. Unfortunately the rest of the meal went downhill, and really from my experience all I would come back here is for the guac, ceviche and margaritas (which is not a bad reason to come back for!) I had the camarones and they were a bit overcooked and dry. The sauce was a bit too spicy, not a good yum spicy but just too overpowering. Then again maybe if the tamale wasn't so dried out, it would have balanced out the spiciness of the dish. The tamale was so dry and like a brick, it must have been a mistake. After being spoiled by how good the tamale at Mesa Grill was, I am disappointed with what was on my plate here.  Finally we ended with the chocoflan. It was just okay.

What was meant to be a pleasant get together with 2 of my girlfriends & a few drinks became a total waste of time & money. This restaurant has great reviews & high ratings, seemed like a sure thing. Honestly the restaurant is pleasant & food is good. However there is something terribly wrong in the kitchen & with management. After our appetizers & first round of drinks our lovely looking entrees came out. Everything looked great & we began to eat. After 2 bites my girlfriend digs out a long blonde hair entangled underneath all the way towards the bottom of her paella. We tell the waitress & she takes our plate away. Less then a minute later a handsome young guy in a fancy suit came over. Guess what he says!? One would assume an apology & perhaps a free round of drinks? NOPE! He says "" if it helps you settle your stomach, I would like to inform you that no one in our kitchen has blonde hair. I could not believe what this guy was implying! My gf happened to have blonde hair but she def didn't hide it under a pile of rice ! Manager is a term I am using loosely as he was about 5 years my junior. Our waitress ensured us that the paella was taken off our bill, ummmm duhhhh ! With no free drinks, deserts or apologies we paid & hurried out.",5,3,3,Stella T.,"New York, NY",212,269,402

I may be wrong.  I ordered their tacos with the steak and although small and spendy for tacos, they tasted great.  I also had their mexican coffee for desert and it put a pep in my step for a pretty penny!  Also, their salsas are AMAZING and must be tried.My only complaint is how spendy the drinks and dishes are, so if going for lunch, I recommend the taco stand downstairs.  For a nice dinner/lunch date, the restaurant upstairs is very nice and upscale for mexican food!",1,0,0,Chris M.,"Carlisle, PA",69,28,17

So upset that it was rated highly by many yelpers.Paella de mariscos (seafood paella) ($28) - tasteless, overcooked rice, good amount of seafood (nice sized jumbo shrimp), but very mediocre and certainly not worth the price.Flor de verano - Watermelon jalepeno drink with st. germain liqueur ($14) - sounds likea great, interesting combo, but fell completely flat; not enoughwatermelon flavor or any type of kick; not at all refreshing; willnever get again.Gran grand margarita ($14) - pretty normal marg that a college student couldwhip up in 2 seconds. nothing more than an average, watered down marg;will absolutely never get again.SERVICE / ATMOSPHERE:Horrible service - waiter was far too pushy; kept pressuring us toorder things we did not want (""(the second we sat down).

4.0,2/18/2011,"I usually hit up Pampano's takeout window in the basement of 805 3rd ave. It's a burrito joint that's close to work with fresh ingredients and upscale preparation. There's definitely a different between a well wrapped burrito at Pampano than the other commercialized burrito shops around the neighborhood. Unfortunately, the fresh ingredients equates to a rather long wait time for Midtown Lunch. Even when I go at 11:30, the wait for a burrito could sometimes stretch to 10-15 minutes, too long for just one order. However, the price point is within the $10 limit I impose on myself, so we're safe there. All in all, the fresh ingredients and preparation offset the long wait times and prices are reasonable so I would recommend this shop.For a cheaper and less caloric alternative, I like to get myself two tacos for about $7. The tacos are fresh tortillas dumped with the protein of you choice. I usually go with the carne asada (packed in and seasoned with cilantro) and the fish special (usually a tempura). I love the fish taco because its a huge tempura'd piece of fish (seasonal) that goes great with the mild sauce.",3,1,1,Larry L.,"New York, NY",357,187,103
4.0,2/8/2011,"This was such a pleasant lunch -- and during restaurant week*, no less!Pampano self-identifies as modern Mexican and I find this an apt description. The five of us were seated in the bright and airy upstairs dining room, in front of the snowed over terrace. It must be absolutely lovely sitting out there on a warmer day, looking out onto the quiet street and the flags of UN Missions. The guacamole that we shared was fresh and delightful, although not quite as good as I've had at other places, where they make it in front of you. It was accompanied by warm freshly baked, crunchy tortilla chips.Four of us started with the ceviche, which was nice and spicy, a little bit too fatty for my taste, but overall good. I had baja fish tacos which were simple mahi mahi and a bit of greens, but I was happy with it being simple and fresh. My companions loved their burritos. They were relatively good about making a substitution for our vegetarian, even though we did the RW lunch, and I understand that the waitress had to check with the chef beforehand but maybe it could have been handled a little more smoothly. They did end up making her main course meatless and she had the salad as a first course.We all chose the chocoflan for dessert and I would recommend this to anyone! It's as if you couldn't decide between chocolate cake and flan, so you stacked them on top of one another. Brilliant!In short, I'm not sure I'd go back for a full lunch unless I could find some cheeky diplomat to pay my way, but I will surely consider dinner here and will hit their taco stand (the same kitchen services both) for lunch, for sure.--* I'll normally avoid RW like the plague, from the numerous accounts of how/why restos do this in the first place. It's not the usual menu and corners are cut. Whereas I understand the need to meet a bottom line, I think it would be useful if a balance were struck between that and luring in repeat customers with maybe one or two of the usual stars on the menu.

4.0,1/13/2011,"My boyfriend and I came here for a mid-week treat back when the weather was warmer, and we could enjoy eating on their beautiful terrace. The restaurant itself is great as well, very stylish and inviting.My boyfriend had been here before for a business lunch and loved it, so we decided to try it for a romantic dinner. I was definitely impressed.For starters, we got the Atun cerviche, which consisted of tuna, onions, avocado, and various spices. Unfortunately, I'm not really a fan of any ceviche (even though I really want to be), so I didn't like it very much.For my meal, I got a special. I can't remember exactly, but it was scallops on some kind of spicy/sweet sauce. The scallops were delicious. The best part, though, was this black bean flan it came with. So unusual (and odd sounding), but really good! My boyfriend got the chipotle-miso marinated black cod, which he had gotten before, and I have to say, I kind of wish I had gotten it too! The flavors were just spectacular. I'm not a fan of cod normally, but this was great.For dessert, we got the angel food cake, which comes with mascarpone pastry cream, strawberry sorbet, pistachio brittle, and balsamic. Once again, it was a surprising pairing of flavors. I definitely did not expect balsamic to work in a dessert, but it really worked well. The pistachio brittle was especially tasty with the cream and sorbet. I would definitely recommend this dessert, since it's nice and light. They had several other desserts that sounded tasty as well.Pampano is on the expensive side, so it's not someplace I would go very often, but it's definitely a nice treat!",0,0,0,Lindsay L.,"New York, NY",37,136,1
3.0,12/11/2010,"Went for lunch a month ago. All I have to say is I am happy my company was paying. The decor is great. We were seated upstairs, and even in winter time, the room being all off white with huge windows and little wood here and there made me feel like I am at a beach side restaurant. Very nice. We ordered the guacamole for the table. They brought it out with a side of chopped pepers to add for spicyness. I found it very bland, unless you add a lot of the extra pepers. Nothing special and deff wouldnt order agian.The best part of the food was no question the steak tacos. I believe it was kobe beef. They were pefection. I am happy that I did not order this for a full meal though. I think they only serve 3 on the plate but there was four of us and when I asked the waitress would it be enough to for the table, she said something along the lines of they will make it work. So that was perfect but tiny, like a tasting menu. For main dish I ordered the mixed seafood and spinach salad. It was wonderful but swimming in oil. Tasted great but there was way too much oil that didnt add to the flavor. My coworkers had the stuffed peper, I tried some of that, it was pretty bland. They also ordered steak and mahi. They liked it but i didnt hear any mindblowing reviews. Didnt seem special.For dessert we ordered chocolate and peanut butter cake, and also a tart. Tart was WAY to sweet, thank god it came with a side of ice cream. And the peanutbutter cake was nothing special either.Service is not up to par for a place with those kind of prices.

It was before dinnertime, so we were able to score ourselves a seat on the patio (along with a promise that yes, we would purchase food along with our drinks). The patio itself is very nice; because you have proper dining tables set up, we didn't run into one of those crowded-with-no-space rooftop bar situations that can occur on a really nice Friday afternoon. The beer itself was standard, but more affordable than other places. As for the appetizers...well, the guacamole was good - it was a little more spicy than usual, which added a nice kick - but the quesadilla was a joke, given how much it cost. That's the reason I knock a couple of stars off the rating...it felt a bit too expensive given the quality. I can't speak to the dinner that a few of my colleagues ended up ordering, but they did look delicious, if that counts for anything.All in all, this is a very nice place to unwind and enjoy a beautiful day outside if you can get a patio spot. It's a bit dark downstairs, but upstairs just off the patio is nice as well. You also have ceiling-long fans that are moving the air around, which makes it feel a little breezy inside too.

Tasted like they mashed avocado and put it in a bowl. With nothing else.  Not a good start to the meal.The ""quesadillas"" (2 of them) added up to be way smaller than my fist. And I'm 5'2, so this is not a big fist... Almost more like mini empanadas. Tasty but forgettable.  I had the skirt steak as an entree, which was SPICY. Now, I love spice. I love it too much. My boyfriend has given me hot sauce for parts of gifts at 3/4 holidays we have spent together.  This was too much.  This combined with the pickled vegetables made for a weird combination that I scraped off my steak to better enjoy.I loved the concept of a seafood/steakhouse Mexican joint.

I was impressed by the look of the place- definitely ask to sit upstairs, which sits under an entire roof of skylights softened by white fabric blinds. They have an outdoor deck up there which also looked tremendous. As I ate a 3 course dinner with wine, there were plenty of surrounding tables of men in suits drinking beer and eating guacamole. Perhaps this was the way to go, but it seemed odd to me that a restaurant would want to mix these two experiences. Though the guacamole WAS $14, so maybe that made it feel more ""high brow"" to them. The food itself was kind of eh. I started with a corn soup, which by itself had a nice flavor. But they'd added a large smear of huitlacoche puree to the bottom of the bowl, which was incredibly salty and began to overwhelm the sweetness of the soup the further down I went. Then came the entree- skirt steak churrasco. I enjoyed the sauce of mushrooms and onions, but the steak itself was way too chewy. I spent about 5 minutes trying to cut one particular bite in half, never actually succeeding in the effort. Finally came the dessert, a warm corn cake for me, chocolate-peanut butter torte thing for my date. This was actually delicious, accented by a coconut ice cream. Only complaint here were the fruit sauces. My corn cake sat in a bath of raspberry puree- not my favorite. But my date's was worse- her chocolate peanut butter torte sat alongside guava sauce. Guava and peanut butter? I think not.I hate to be harsh, but I think 2 stars is fair. Service was pretty bad also, but heay, it was restuarnat week so I'll excuse that.

Other than the novelty factor of trying out a Mexican seafood dish, I didn't really feel like I was eating something really good. It was ok I guess. And please do not order non-fish items of the menu. I had fillet mignon one time ($ 34) and it didn't do justice to the price tag and failed to impress. If you can, please sit on the second floor.

On its best night, it has the freshness and lightness of good Veracruz. Yes, it takes some liberties, but the liberties are well thought out, including the stellar Malbec on the wine list. We sat on the terrace where I felt transported away from the skyscraper buildings with Mexican music in the background. The hibiscus margaritas were uniquely delicious and the lobster tacos made us want for more. They were fresh and light. Additionally, it was the perfectly romantic setting for date night but also conducive for bringing friends back for a group outing. Viva Veracruz!",1,0,0,Maly L.,"Manhattan, NY",247,95,779
5.0,3/23/2009,"Funny enough, I've never actually had the opportunity to eat a pompano ( a type of deep-bodied fish abundant in gulf of Mexico and Atlantic) in Pampano, but that does not deter my adoration for this jewel.  This restaurant is absolutely phenomenal. Anything that comes out of their kitchen looks exquisite and tastes like an explosion of unique fireworks, if food could ever be ignited and combust with saliva.   My recommendation: Ceviche ALL the Way!  Drinks: My God, anything! Concoction of Choice would be the pineapple mojito. It's convincing me that I might be more of a lush than I thought when the simple memory of it has me drooling in my chair as I type.   Pampano has simple, modern, comfortable seating arrangements, a clean bathroom (huge plus for me, in terms of Fine-Dining. I Judge without shame).    Alas, dessert is not far behind at all in terms of the essential ingredients necessary to make me go ""Oooooo"" and ""mmmmm"" and ""NO, I'm NOT SHARING!!""    You'll turn into a selfish eating-monster if you were to ever go to Pampano.",1,1,0,Ada d.,"Sunnyside, NY",71,45,17

Hence, I'm confident when I eat my mole--if its original, then its original. The restaurant's food reminds me of french cuisine---its SMALL. those big plates with small servings of piled up sauce and fish etc...This i not the Mexican I know.  wish reviewers here could have given a better insight and saved me $300++ for three people--- 38++ for three small servings of ceviche. Dont get me wrong--a set dinner with soup, main course and dessert for 34 dollars is not bad. it costs nothing to real Japanese food---but for a MEXICAN Food!!!!Go here if you want to have a clean---french like feel. Dont expect loud Mexican music and dont expect Mexicans eating as well. Never saw one yesterday. I had Tilapia--yeah it was nice... the food was delicately balanced. I think you'll like it if you want to impress your date. Overall the food is good. I felt bad for my friend who ordered the shrimp---he got four medium pieces on top of a nicely presented goat cheese serving. did i mention i ordered tilapia on banana leaf. yeah it was good but i was hungry afterwards...

Pampano was a couple of blocks away from my hotel, so I decided to go there with a friend after watching Xanadu on Broadway (which is a whole other story by the way). I would say that since most of the items on the menu are fish items, it would be best to stick with that. We started with the camarones adobados which were exquisite especially with the beet-chile emulsion. I ordered the huachinango which was a whole baby red snapper stuffed with cactus and roasted tomato. Absolutely delightful.There are a lot of flavors presented on the plates, but each one is distinctive. Actually it's like watching a David Lynch movie. With each bite you discover something new.

3.0,9/9/2008,"My gf made several suggestions for dinner one night and I picked Pampano based on the pictures of the ceviches posted by other viewers. I am a HUGE lover of ceviche. The ambiance of the restaurant is  very comfortable. They even have an upstairs outdoor dining area. The guacamole dip was huge even for a small order. Very tasty and spicy. We didn't go with the ceviche sampler of (3) but ordered the shrimp ceviche and was a bit disappointed. Possibly b/c it had a milky texture and I'm a fan of the citrus type ceviches. I probably didn't order the right one. As a second appetizer, we ordered the Camarones Abodabos (blackened shrimp) and it was okay, although highly recommended by the waiter. Nothing special. For the main dish, I ordered PESCADO AZTECA (golden bass / huitlacoche flan / peruvian corn/ zucchini / chile guajillo consommé) $29.The fish was not dry (which is always a plus) and  flavorful with thin strips of tortilla chips on top. The huitacoche flan was kind of interesting for me. It tasted like a risotto of some sort. I'm not sure what huitlacoche is but my taste buds didn't really enjoy itFor dessert, I ordered the NATILLA DE CAJETA (cajeta custard / caramelized bananas), It was good although the center was cold. Sort of a Mexican spin on Creme Brulee. Oh and how can I forget. The highlight of the meal was the cocktail. I had a MOJITO MARACUYA (passion fruit mojito).

The three of us split an order of guacamole and the tacos de filete (filet mignon) and these are both pretty good.  However, the guac was not really spicy even though we had asked for spicy guac.I had the Huachinango (red snapper) which was also good.  The portion was a bit small but it came sitting on a bed of cactus-tomato salad which was also good.  I suggest ordering a side dish for the table to go along with the entrees.  So the entrees and appetizers were good, but dessert was bettter.  I strongly suggest getting the chocoflan.  It's flan sitting on a dark chocolate cake with candied pecans on top.  The whole thing was drizzled in caramel.  I think this is a nice place in midtown for a date or a casual work lunch.",4,2,3,Larry L.,"San Francisco, CA",132,359,21

Unless you've been to Phoenix in the summer, don't even think ,""well, at least its a dry heat"".... *sighs* its a blast furnace.  That having been said, eating great Mexican food in the Sonoran desert of Arizona rarely ever includes seafood. I like to try new restaurants out early in the evening so the wait staff is not already burdened and wont mind my leisurely pace.  We had reservations for two on a Saturday night at six... the place was empty. The weather was fantastic so we  chose to be seated on the rooftop overlooking the street.  If the weather and crowds permit, I would recommend this as a great choice. We started off with a couple Gran Grand Margaritas ($14) on the rocks with no salt to loosen up a bit.  We have tried many of NYC's Mexican food offerings and almost always get guacamole to use as a baseline to judge the place by, but I was intrigued by a seafood alternative.  The Pez Espada Ahumado listed smoked swordfish, tomato, onion, cilantro with tortilla chips( $13) right above the guac, and since we were eating in a place that bills itself as coastal seafood, i thought id make a small leap of faith. Wow, we were blown away!  The presentation was a bit like tuna salad with chips to dip in it, but the ingredients were delicious and we couldn't stop eating. If you have ever enjoyed smoked fish, this appetizer is a no brainer... you'll love it.We followed the dip up with a three Civeche sampler ($27) and sampled  the shrimp, Tuna and Halibut.  Each one was light and balanced in its flavors, but we both thought the Halibut with cilantro, mint and papaya  was the best by far.  For dinner she ordered the Roablo ($27) and I went with that night's special of Pan seared Halibut ($30) and a side of black beans and rice ($5.50)  for the table. The black bass and the halibut were delicious and we commented on how perfectly cooked the fish was.All in, this was a fantastic dining experience.  The outdoor seating was romantic and provided enough space between us and the other diners. The staff was very friendly and happy to answer our questions. The food was absolutely wonderful.  (We are still craving the smoked sword fish!)  I was tempted to take back one star for having to pay for rice and beans, but the quality of everything served overwhelmed this mild offense.Like seafood?  Enjoy Mexican cuisine?  Pampano's servers up amazing seafood expertly cooked and complimented by delicious sauces and sides from our neighbors south of the border.   I will absolutely be recommending this place to all of my friends.",2,0,1,Bart A.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",2,11,0

The restaurant serves mostly fish, although I did spy a filet and a chicken breast on the menu (probably for those poor souls who are seafood-intolerant, and bless you all, but how you are missing out!)Really, it's a hidden semiprecious stone on a relatively dull block of 49th street (between 2nd and 3rd avenue) not too far (but a world away) from the 2nd avenue fratbar scene.  The terrace/balcony is on the second floor and I'll be sure to come here again for outdoor drinking.The food was great. I am an epicurean, and above all, I drool for seafood. This place has at most 4 non-seafood items. So really, this place has Double O written all over it.One thing I really liked is the restaurant's attention to the food's TEXTURE. I think this is something that is overlooked very often, but when I think about my favorite meals they always have a lot of varying ingredients creating a mixed and diverse texture throughout the entire dish. This wakes up the tastebuds and makes you pay attention. This made me think about the food.Recommended appetizers: 1. ceviche sampler; comes with tuna, mahi mahi, shrimp and halibut ceviche. If I had to pick one, I would do the shrimp. I would also ask them to add a bit of heat (spice) to the ceviches as I found them a bit bland, especially for a restaurant that is Latin inspired. But perhaps that was due to the two double O's (ketel with one ice cube) that I drank beforehand. The double O's high alcohol concentration tends to temporarily disable my taste buds.2.smoked swordfish chunky salad with chips to scoop it with3.guacamole which you can request spicy or mild. The texture is creamy but still relatively chunky. Mains:1.shrimp: properly cooked (the test: easily removing the tail from the body) and tangy2.swordfish : was my only complaint about the preparation. A bit overcooked. I like my swordfish a bit moist on the inside, as it is a muscular fish and should be prepared with due care. potato-caper fondue on the side was out of this world, and definitely woke up my slumbering taste buds.3.black bass: was lovely, crispy on the outside and moist deliciousness on the inside. Great texture of crispiness and plantains and black beans was orchestrated in this dish.Appetizers  2 and 3 arrived atop two silver tiered pedestals (one level for the chips and one level for the swordfish and guac) which reminded me a bit of the movie Marie Antoinette (where these two level serving trays are filled with pastries that Kirsten Dunst has at all her parties) and also made me very pleased with the table space that was left over--these were very efficient! So much better than the huge guac bowls that look like they were rescued from a volcanic eruption at Dos Caminos. COMPLAINTS:The great efficiency of the two tiered appetizer pedestals was greatly discounted by the inefficient service. 10 of us were sitting in the back of the main floor dining room. My table's host said: ""we want to drink and eat a lot, and very quickly. We have cars waiting.""Now please correct me if I am wrong, but this sounds pretty much like every waitresses dream table, and would make for a pretty easy game plan: serve a group of people 5 bottles of wine and a pitcher of sangria (for the lone drunk in the corner), serve quickly, get your biga$$ tip, and have them out in a jiffy--no  coddling required, no actual SERVICING required--just bring our food, bring our wine, bring our bill, and buh-bye. And seriously, when the host says ""we need many bottles, bring out 2 more as soon as we are done with the first two and keep em coming"" of Gaudium rioja, 1998, you take care of it in a quick and efficient manner! The waitress seemed confounded by the ""quick food and drinks"" request and took her sweet a$$ time bringing everything. The apps, the entrees, and most importantly, the WINE! We were waiting for the wine to arrive for about 15 minutes after we ordered it. and then when we killed the first two bottles it took about 15 more minutes to bring us two more. This is too long. You don't leave a bunch of hardworking businesspeople without a drink for 15 minutes on a Tuesday evening. Another dislike was that they kept sending out different people to ask us if we wanted more wine. If you are ordering this much, shouldn't they have one person taking care of you all night?Risk: restaurant provides heavy servingware useful for throwing at slow and inept staff Reward: lovely fish, lovely terrace",6,4,7,Lily O.,"New York, NY",277,109,1
3.0,4/30/2007,"This place was pretty good.  I had the whole red snapper which was visually stunning.  Everyone oohed and ahhhed (including the table next to ours) The fish was split in two and wrapped like a bowl, holding all the vegetables inside.  The fish was light and flaky, the vegetables were good, and the sauce was light and complemented the flavors.  We had the lobster wraps as appetizer which was good too...tiny, but good.  My friends had the ceviche which they devoured.  The guacolmole was yummy also but nothing too special about it.  I tasted my friends' empanada which was decent.  The atmosphere is very nice.  They have an outdoor garden (it was closed cuz it was raining unfortunately).  Their paradise mojito was yummy and sweet (it didn't even taste like alcohol).  Overall, I thought the decor and food were good, but not enough for me to be a regular.",2,0,2,C A.,"San Francisco, CA",28,283,22
4.0,2/27/2007,"A definite must! It is more upscale  then Dos Caminos. More important,  the cuisine blows Dos Caminos out of the water!  I loved the ambience and they have an outside terrace  when the weather is warm.  The guacamole was fresh and not too spicy. I had some sort of sea bass that melted in my mouth. It came with chile sauce that bursted with flavor(ugh I sounded just like Rachel Ray:) ANYWAY, I personally liked Pompano's much better then Dos Caminos. It was less trendy and more intimate.",3,2,3,Heidi B.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",512,165,0
4.0,5/5/2006,"Like everyone else, I thought mexican food should be cheap and tasty, but not belabored. Pompano set me straight: fancy mexican is amazing.  Pompano has a delectable menu of refined mexican seafood dishes.  Try the lobster tacos, they're fabulous. The guacamole is chunky and plentiful. I got the black bass, which was tender and tasty! (I also got some tasty tequila, the name forgotten, but the description included the memorable term ""spicy cake"") It's a bit pricey, and a bit corporate, but it's still a shot of happy for your  fancy-pants palate.",1,1,0,ben -.,"New York, NY",17,101,0
