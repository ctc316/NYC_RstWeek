4.0,4/28/2019,"The first time I came to this restaurant was back in 2014 to eat fugu (puffer fish). There's not that many fugu place in the states and I haven't eaten it for so long since I left Japan, so I was so excited to try fugu at this place. We ordered Fugu course which included fugu sashimi, fugu karaage, and fugu nabe. Honestly the whole course was quite disappointing and it was the worst fugu I've ever had. And after years I came back to this place again for lunch as I was staying right next to the restaurant. This time I ordered tempura soba and I was pleasantly surprised as both soba and tempura far exceeded my expectation. The noodle itself was very well made and I liked the kakiage tempura so much. I don't know how's other food at this place except fugu and tempura soba but I highly recommend their soba and if you want to have an authentic fugu, this is not the right place.",1,0,1,Ava L.,"Los Angeles, CA",152,79,387

5.0,8/7/2018,"If you're in the mood for old school and traditional Japanese meal with kimono wearing servers, then this is the place to check out.  Open since the 1960's, this is one of the oldest (if not the oldest) authentic Japanese restaurant in New York.  Touted as the birthplace of the now popular negimaki (beef negimiyaki), which is beef wrapped around scallions, I can see why this classic spot still opens their doors today after so many years in business.  If you're ever going to try something new or want to experience the original, why not try the place that seem to have spearheaded Japanese cuisine into the American market?  Their beef negimiyaki or negimaki, however you spell it, the taste of the dish here at Nippon is one above all others.  We also tried their sukiyaki, which is a very sentimental meal for my wife and I, was prepared skillfully by the nice lady in a kimono.  Salty but savory, the beef was cooked tender and the aroma of the sauce and the meaty juices were perfect with rice.  Brings back memories of visit to Japan.  Puffer fish (fugu) was also on their menu, and not having tried it while overseas, we ordered a plate.  Though the flavor is not strong and actually a bit on the bland side, the texture is where the uniqueness of the fish really stands apart from other sashimi.  A bit chewier and a blend between a raw piece of fish and a squid, the texture is complex but not in a weird way.  The ponzu sauce gave the piece of fugu some flavor.  Like a trip down memory lane, but tastier, Nippon reminds me of the fun times I had in Japan and the delicious food I tried there.  Hopefully they'll be around for many more years.",10,2,5,Louis N.,"New York, NY",375,218,459
5.0,8/1/2018,"I read that Nippon is the oldest sushi restaurant in North America, or New York City, or something along those lines.  Suffice it to say, I was pumped to eat here. The decor is kitsch and servers are dressed in traditional looking Japanese garb.  The food is all excellent.  I tried the July 2018 kaiseki tasting course and it was delicious. It included vegetarian small plates, soup, sashimi, fried crab, cooked miso cod, and more.  I didn't know what half of the plates were, but I enjoyed them all.  Highly recommended!",1,0,3,Dimitrios D.,"Queens, NY",17,458,667

5.0,3/4/2018,"A superb true classic Japanese restaurant - which is very rare and difficult to find outside of Japan. Authenticity pervades in every dish they prepare, including when they invent new dishes. When the Japanese emperor visited New York, it was their kitchen where his meals were prepared (by chefs that came with him).  The Japanese food offered in First Class for Japan Airlines is prepared by Nippon Restaurant.  The founder chef/owner, Mr. Kuraoka was awarded by the nation of Japan a special distinction for his meritorious contribution for the enhancement of Japanese culture. Mr. Kuraoka, sadly passed away this January less than two month after his wife/partner passed away. The memorial, attended by many notable people including Hideki Matsui for whom this restaurant was like a second home, was held by the Japanese Embassy. To be truthful it was a bit depressing to visit this restaurant without the Kuraokas there. It is quiet restaurant with a serene atmosphere to begin with but right now somberness seems to hang in the air and is accentuated by a notably sparse attendance since their passing. But, personal joy returns with the first taste - joy in the thought that what Mr. Kuraoka so carefully created is now so judiciously continued. So - on to the food.Everything is good here. The beef that they use for Beef salad (sukiyaki , shabu-shabu, oroshi and negiyaki - a dish that originated in this restaurant but now popular throughout the world including Japan) is bar none - perhaps the most superb in NYC.  They don't need to use expensive gimmicks like Japanese beef or American /Aussie wagyu (whatever that is). Nippon simply uses very good American beef carefully sourced and absolutely perfectly sliced (prime rib cut against the grain - not too thin not too thick) and prepared. The soba (80/20 = nihachi), made from buckwheat harvested at their Canadian farm, is out of this world and would rate 5 stars in Japan, particularly for those who prefer darker color thicker cut soba (vs Sarashina style white-ish soba that uses only the core of the buckwheat).  The soba salad has become touch spicy.  The tsuyu (dipping sauce) while strong (Kanto / Shinshu style) is ideal for light dipping.  For hot soba, particular favorite is Kamo Nanban with excellent duck.Fish preparation is spot on whether it be for grills (ask for the specials) or seasonal fugu (blow fish) or for sashimi/sushi. The Edo-mae sushi is truly what it should be like if prepared in Japan (i.e. without things like salmon, crunches and spices) with only ingredients that are supposed to be in traditional sushi. Tempura may be one of the best tempuras you could get in the States and certainly one of the most authentic, using ingredients as they would be in Japan such as the light white fish (kisu).Special courses and Kaiseki are immaculately prepared. As with many things prepared in this restaurant, it may not seem glamorous but it is the right stuff, put forth in the right order and quantity - and as it should be. A place like Brushstrokes may seem more sexy, but very few come close to what Japanese cuisine is truly supposed to be as Nippon does.",5,0,2,TokyoGeo B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,34,0
5.0,2/2/2018,"Second time here.Tempura: shrimp and white fish. Ammazing!!! The shrimp is FANTASTIC by itself, even better with the dipping sauce. It's also a little chewy. This is the first time that I enjoy the chewing experience of a shrimp. Whitefish is a bit splendid. But with plenty of dipping sauce, not a problem! I ended up thanks the chef three times to express how I like the food.Eel rice is also splendid. Even the cucumbers and radishes to go with the main set are carefully prepared and flavorful as well. The best eel rice I have ever had. Dessert was green team macha ice cream. A bit small but the price is also low. It tastes a bit different from the ice cream you see in a Japanese grocery store.

3.0,8/2/2017,"First, the good. The beef ramen and chicken in coconut broth ramen were both excellent. There were some negatives though.

5.0,7/14/2017,Awesome Kaseki menu! We had one $100 and one $120 set. They are roughly the same and we got the $100 simply because there's sukiyaki as a choice. I have to say the portion is pretty decent for this price comparing to other places we've been to. Everything is so fresh and delicate. Best foie gras and ice bowl ever. Plus the staff is really nice. The owner(?) even printed out a history of Edo Mae cuisines for us to read and elaborated on the dishes. Other waitresses are also patient and warm. It's also a sensation to sit close to the kitchen because you could see them decorate your plate and fry that good soft shell crab. Wonderful experience.,1,0,1,乃馨,"New York, NY",58,91,328

5.0,6/13/2017,"This is my favorite restaurant in Manhattan and favorite Japanese restaurant period.  I visited Restaurant Nippon for the first time while I was in NYC and was extremely happy to come across this gem.  Nestled on 52nd street, on the way back to my hotel from 5th avenue, I thought this place may be a good place to warm up and grab some grub in the snow blizzard.  As a result of the whim visit, I discovered that this place is a true gem with fresh soba salad, vegetables, entrees and desserts to remember (homemade ice cream with organic fruit or a choice of bean topping true authentic!!) for a lifetime.  Nippon is now my go-to restaurant while in NYC.  I even brag about this place to all of my colleagues and friends as the food is by far the best Japanese food I have ever experienced.  Did I also mention that the atmosphere is absolutely amazing.  They have a cozy feel with excellent customer service and private rooms for people wanting privacy.  What a treat.  I am actually eating there again tomorrow.",0,0,0,Blee L.,"Raleigh, NC",4,57,36

3.0,10/9/2016,"After spending too much time than intended for a place to have dinner, my friend and i gave Nippon a chance since we both wanted something relatively healthy.Upon arriving, the host gave us a warm greeting and seated us to our table. I noticed there are a few areas specifically for Japanese style seating where you have to take off your shoes and don't have an actual chair. It would be a neat area to sit. Also, all the waitresses are dressed in kimonos and are quite attentive as well. A warm cloth is placed on each table for you to clean your hands before eating and our teas were refilled without being asked.I ordered the Zuru Soba while my friend ordered the Duck Hasamiyaki. The portion sizes were perfect in the sense that it was just enough for one person to be full but not overly full. The Soba was light, not oily and cooked to the perfect texture. However, I thought the broth was a little bit too salty until it was diluted but other than that, the entire dish wasn't something that really stood out to me as spectacular but definitely not something I had complaints about. My friend felt the same about his Duck Hasamiyaki that it was mediocre and nothing that made us jump out of our seats because it was really good. I had a taste of his duck (and mind you.. this is probably the first time I've had duck in at least 15 years..) which tastes a bit like pork but it may just be the Japanese style? Hopefully my next duck tasting will not alter the delectable impression I have of duck right now!Although this restaurant isn't on my top list for Japanese cuisine, I will probably give it another chance for the other items on their menu like sushi and hot soba. Pricing is also very budget-friendly especially for the location so this can be taken into consideration if you're looking for places that doesn't break your bank!",3,0,0,Kelly Y.,"New York, NY",144,162,281

I like the shrimp tempura set lunch. The tempura sauce was hmm hmm good! My friends had the beef tariyaki and chicken teriyaki. They loved their food very much.

1.0,4/20/2016,"I went for sushi and would not recommend it. I ordered the omekasa sushi, as it promised the chef's choice of the  freshest fish. After I ordered, another waitress (maybe a manager?) had to come back to make sure that was definitely what I wanted because she said ""most people want traditional. They don't know.""  No, I'm fine with whatever the chef thinks is the freshest fish. I love sushi and will eat anything that is fresh. Unfortunately that was not what I got. First of all, it was all standard pieces I would have expected from any sushi assortment--nothing special or unusual, so I don't know why they thought I would be so trepidatious. Worse, all but 2 or 3 pieces had a GIANT chunk of wasabi between the fish and the rice. They were definitely hiding fish that was far from fresh because the wasabi largely but not entirely masked the funky fish taste. I'm not sure what the deal was. Maybe they thought because I was not Japanese I wouldn't know the difference and they'd give me the bad stuff?  Unfortunately I was in a rush so I just ate, told them it was good, and left. Which I know isn't entirely fair and doesn't serve anyone but I really didn't feel like sitting there having a discussion about the old fish. When the bill came I discovered the omekasa was $80--which is $30 more than the traditional sushi plate. I'd be fine with that if it was because I was getting the freshest fish, but I don't think that's what happened. I won't be back. 2 stars instead of 1 because it was so quiet which was a nice escape for the evening. If I get sick tomorrow I'll change it to 1 star.Update:  yeah. I got sick.

4.0,4/10/2016,"Ok, where else in New York can you get fresh fish imported (daily) from Japan?!?  To me, quality is very important and the fact that Nippon does this tells me that the owners value the same thing as I.  I've essentially given up eating sushi and eel prior to finding Nippon; after reading horror stories of farm raised eel in China (seriously, do a Google search.  Eel and these other species are literally fed crap.  Those farmers refuse to even feed their farm-raised products to their own children.  Yet, these same products seem to ""pass"" inspection here in the US and are disseminated across restaurants and supermarkets), I gave it up.  I LOVE eel too but knew I had to give it up.  So imagine my surprise when I saw that Nippon flew this in - fresh - from Japan daily!  Let me tell you, it is worth the premium.  If you value your health, you won't 13itch and moan about the prices here.  The eel is distinctively different than the cheap crap you would get at the markets or other restaurants.  It is delicious.  It is soft.  I haven't had it like this since I was in Japan over a dozen years ago!  I also had the seaweed salad and agedashi tofu - both really good and fresh, albeit a tad too salty for me.  If it weren't for my second dinner following this dinner, I would have ordered more (hehe). I do plan on bringing some of my colleagues here though.  I saw some cute, authentic private rooms - perfect for a (business) meeting!  Nippon, I'm so glad I saw you and I'm so glad the folks at Totto Ramen were so douchey that I turned around and walked out to come here.  I will be back for eel soon!",2,2,2,Gee L.,"New York, NY",231,156,1518

The roll pieces were dense and chewy, without much flavor.  The individual pieces included salmon, tuna, shrimp, and four others that were not described or recognizable.

However when food comes in the same server said we have to order more because it still didn't meet their house rule. We were confused and questioned that it was not initially what we were told, she responded that ""if you don't like it, you can go somewhere else"". I don't want this to ruin our short lunch break so I ordered a shrimp tempera (which was not good) for another 8 dollars..

The staffing is top notch (and sometimes a little awkward as they WILL wait for you to finish that last bite to clean up your plates, but to be fair, i reserved at off-peak hours, so it wasn't crowded). It's really amazing otherwise. The food was delicious. One minor complaint is that service is a tad too fast. Expensive food is meant to be savored and enjoyed for its taste, but when we were one of their few customers there at that hour, we literally finished our set prix fixe dinner meal in literally under 20 minutes! Again, this has to be done with the rapid and attentive service, which should be slightly slowed down overall. Portions were also a bit small. The portions we got looked like lunch-sized portions, but I was expecting a bit more out of dinner. I understand that smaller portions are generally used in restaurants as a means of class & style, but come on, we kinda left the restaurant still questionably hungry. Other than those two issues, food quality is amazing - everything is fresh and fried/cooked to perfection. After all food quality is the bulk of my reviews on yelp. They just need to tweak their service and they have an easy 5 stars. Btw, this is really amazing place to take a girl to a date.

2.0,8/17/2014,"When my mom and I first heard about Restaurant Nippon, given its reputation, We were dying to try this place. We wanted to see just how good this restaurant was as it has been over 30 years since this restaurant was first established. It is said that this restaurant serves authentic Japanese food, which is rare because NYC has very few restaurants that serve authentic Japanese cuisine. Hence, with this in mind, we went to Restaurant Nippon for the very first time. First, to get started, when you first walk in, you can see all of these awards that the restaurant hangs on the left wall. Seeing this, my mom and I, had even more high hopes for this restaurant. We were greeted warmly by the staff and immediately escorted to our table. However, this is when the ""nightmare"" begins. When we receive the menus we see that it was still restaurant week and so my mom and I, never having tried restaurant week, wanted to know what it was about. Apparently, I was told restaurant week was to give customers, whether they are regulars or not, good quality food for a less expensive price in order to obtain more business. Therefore, my mom and I ordered two courses, which included choosing one appetizer, one main course dish and dessert had no choice, in the restaurant week menu (each costed $38). This meant so far we spent $76.  For the appetizer, we ordered a soba salad and tofu with miso paste. But, when we received the appetizers, the tofu, was ONLY two small pieces, it was unbelievable because it felt like we ate nothing. As for the soba salad, it was a normal taste, there was nothing authentic about it. Next came the main dishes, I ordered the famous beef sukiyaki and my mom ordered fish with ankake. Without even asking who will have the sukiyaki, our waitress, a fairly old lady, gives my mother the sukiyaki, and therefore we had to switch our plates. It doesn't end here, because as I tried the beef sukiyaki, which included a bowl of rice and it was the same for my mother's order as well, the sukiyaki had a vague taste and wasn't prepared very well. I could see the foam, which minimizes the taste of the sukiyaki, wasn't removed at all giving it its bland taste. Not to mention, inside the sukiyaki were ONIONS. Okay, I was born here in America, but my mother was born in Japan and she knew what authentic Japanese cuisine looked and tasted like and was utterly flabbergasted to see onion because never has anyone in her life put onions in sukiyaki. She makes sukiyaki for me and she has never put onions so I too was astounded by what I saw. My mom, frankly, isn't the best cook, but I can honestly say I think her sukiyaki has better taste and quality because it has a definite taste. Even the rice my mom makes is better than Nippon's rice, since its rice was also bland and dull. My mother's fish with ankake also lacked taste and it was salty. The coating the fish had was all mushy from the sauce it was soaked in, which made the taste even worse. Last, was the dessert and it was fairly good dessert, there was nothing to complain about there. Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone, because the food they serve isn't authentic Japanese food that it seems almost impossible that such renowned celebrities actually went to eat at this restaurant. If you have read other reviews that gave this restaurant less than three stars, I also agree with those reviews because this place was a disappointment to my mother and me. I wanted to give three stars but with this kind of food quality, price and service, I am only stating my honest opinion based on experiences from various restaurants in nyc.",1,0,0,Yoshiko H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0

2.0,2/24/2014,"We went to this restaurant to try its special fugu (puffer fish) menu. Fugu is considered a super luxury in East Asian cuisine, and we truly wanted to try it out when it's in season. I have to admit that we had high expectations - why shouldn't we? After all, this is a restaurant that served the Showa Emperor of Japan when he visited the NYC. Also, fugu is considered as a to-die-for delicacy by the Chinese people: given that it was very hard to remove all the poisonous organs in ancient times, people literally died from eating it. It still stays on the menu of both Chinese and Japanese cuisine despite all the intricacies involved in cooking, which tells us how delicious this fish should be. For information about the tora-fugu (tiger puffer fish), refer to this wiki page: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta….We ordered the tasting menu of tora-fugu (tiger puffer fish) (240 pp), which includes a fried fugu dish, a fugu sashimi, a hot pot of fugu, and a congee dish that was made out of the soup of the hot pot. Given it's my first time to try fugu (there aren't that many restaurants that offer fugu), I can't say how fugu here compares to other restaurants', but all I can say is that fugu at Restaurant Nippon tastes no better than a a regular fish. I'll do a dish-by-dish analysis so that you don't have to spend 480 USD plus tax and tip like we did to know what I know by now. (1) Fried fugu: I think this is the head/cheek part of the fugu. Too many bones, too little meat, and the taste didn't make up for the lack of quantity. I seriously doubt if any kind of fish, after being deep-fried in this fashion, would taste any worse than fugu. It's by no means a correct way of preparing the fish, judging by its effect.(2) Fugu sashimi: I liked the fugu sashimi, but I wouldn't favor it to, say, top-quality otoro, or well-prepared saba sashimi. I liked the crunchy skin more than I liked the fish...(3) Fugu hot pot: I had expected this to be the highlight of the menu, but it was so plain that my heart sank after the first taste of the fish, and sank even harder after trying the soup. Come on, even I can make a more richly-flavored soup than this by using a special kind of carp that sells for 2 USD per pound in China. To sum up: tasteless soup, and very chewy (definitely overcooked) fish. The housemade tofu in this hot pot turned out to be the most delicious component.(3) Rice congee out of the soup: okay, given that the soup was a failure, there's no reason to expect the rice congee made out of it to be great. Yet the restaurant was able to screw up the presentation even further by having a rookie waitress to pour the bowl of rice into the hot pot BEFORE bringing the hot pot to boil. She was immediately reprimanded by two other waitresses in Japanese (and yes, I understood the entire conversation and felt bad for the young waitress) but the damage was done. The congee dish was so bad that neither of us had the wish to finish.We also ordered two wagyu beef dishes, but neither was delicious. In simple words, this restaurant does not use top-quality materials that one should expect from a restaurant that offers expensive tasting menus. We were thinking of coming back to try the kaiseki after trying the fugu tasting, but now we aren't.Also, a word about service: I think the rookie waitress was in a distress pretty much throughout the night, making mistakes at our table every now and then (forgetting sauces, then double-delivering them; didn't refill our teas until we repeated asked for t). Maybe other waitresses would've given us a different experience, but there's no way for us to know without risking spending another evening at this place. Given how awfully stressed we were at the table that night, it's highly unlikely for us to return.

It was my birthday dinner and we ended up having 7 people - called the night before to change the reservation from 5 and they didn't have an issue.  I got the sukiyaki cooked in the kitchen. It was super hot when it came out, but got luke warm pretty quickly. I liked the taste and the yumminess of all of the ingredients (homemade tofu- yum!!, shiratake noodle, shiitake mushroom, onions, cabbage). Cooking the dish in the kitchen was an extra fee of $2 (cook at table $28). The 5 slices of beef was nice and fatty and pretty big so it was a nice portion. You get a choice of rice or egg. WHY???? I kinda wished they would give me both.  Also tried a piece of friend's spicy tuna roll. It was ok. Everyone else got soba. Friend's 3 pieces of tonkatsu was the one that got forgotten and it two reminders for it to come. However, the manager was super nice and comped his rice and gave all 7 of us the special matcha mochi from Japan. That was the highlight of my meal.

I usually avoid this kind of spectacle in restaurants, but I wanted ice cream so agreed to this. It was actually really nice. :) red bean, green tea, and some kind of vanilla. It was definitely big enough to share a few bites per person amongst all 7 of us. I think next time, I'll revert back to French/New american restaurants for birthday meals.

5.0,12/31/2013,"Terrific dinner here on New Year's Eve (with no special menu, thankfully).We were 3 and kept it simple: each had a green salad -- fresh, crisp and refreshing, with a light soy sauce/oil/rice vinegar dressing. We then had shabu shabu for 3. This was excellent: beautifully-cut ingredients included creamy homemade tofu blocks, napa cabbage, snow-white enoki mushrooms, half-moon onions, yam noodles and rosy thin-sliced ribeye. Not overly salty broth, and accompanied by perfectly seasoned citrus ponzu and sesame dipping sauces. Generous but not excessive portioning.

The manager comes by your table and stiffly welcomes you; when you walk in there's a cadre of kimono-clad ladies greet you in Japanese; when you go it seems as though every staff member says goodbye.  It's cute.

3.0,10/1/2013,"This place gets three stars because of the s-l-o-w service. If I were judging it on food alone, it would get five stars.My boyfriend and I made reservations on Saturday night (09/28) at 7:30. We walked in, and the host (?) almost wet his pants trying to find a suitable place for us to sit, even though the restaurant wasn't crowded. It was a little uncomfortable and frustrating watching him jump around from table to table as he led us around to the back. Dude, I get you want to give us the best customer experience possible, but you don't need to be OCD about it. He finally leads us to a table way in the back, where the sushi chefs are. As soon as I sit down, my nostrils are assaulted by the unpleasant aroma of mothballs and broccoli flatulence. (My boyfriend didn't notice any smells because his allergies were acting up). At first, I thought someone had gotten sick at our table, but then I realized the smell was coming from the table directly in front of us, where three elderly people and one incredibly annoyed teenage girl were sitting, all simultaneously eating and complaining about the quality of their food. More specifically, the odor was emanating from the elderly gentleman at that table.Now, to be fair, I can't blame the restaurant for this. It's not their fault some of their patrons can't control their sphincter muscles and dress in hideous blue leisure suits circa 1976. I also could have flagged down the host or a random server and politely requested to sit somewhere else. But I never back down from a challenge, so I took a deep breath, drank some water, and concentrated on ignoring the little band of misfits. Oh yeah, speaking of water...it took a very long time for someone to get to our table, and it took an even longer time for our waitress to arrive. I noticed our effusive host frantically summoning our waitress when we decided on our orders...and then sat waiting for 15 minutes.My boyfriend ordered the soba noodles with beef, and a side order of the yellowtail/scallion roll. I ordered two pieces of eel and yellowtail nigiri sushi, and two small rolls of spicy tuna and spicy salmon. We also ordered sake (I can't pronounce the name, but it was the lightest of the bunch, and it had a delicious fruity aftertaste. We ended up going through the first carafe the waitress brought over and plowed through the second one she brought, as well.) Although I think I liked the sake because it helped obliterate the nasty vibes I was getting from the folks sitting in front of us.The sushi was excellent, and I also thought the soba noodles were good too (it wasn't heavy or thick like a beef stew, but it had a rich, hearty flavor.) The service gradually improved as the meal progressed (thanks in part to the departure of The Three Furies and their buddy Stinkbomb), although it was still sluggish. The green tea served at the end of our meal was a nice touch.All in all, I think this place has very good sushi, but they need to pick up the pace on their service. I would be willing to give Nippon another try in the near future.",0,1,0,Donna F.,"Hoboken, NJ",25,109,0
5.0,9/22/2013,"Amazing, delicious, and traditional Japanese restaurant.We ordered a Beef Sukiyaki, Kamo Nanban, and a Matcha Mochi.Beef Sukiyaki - I've never had sukiyaki before, but I'm glad the first time I had it here. The beef was fresh and tender. Homemade tofu and vegetables added a sweetness to the soy sauce broth. Kamo Nanban - This was soba with duck. The homemade soba had a great texture. Had a springy bite to it. The broth was a bit saltier and heavier than the sukiyaki broth because it lacked vegetables.Matcha Mochi - Best part of the meal and not just because it's dessert. Matcha flavor was strong and the mochi was soft and chewy. I wish it was larger though.Staff was polite and made you feel very welcome. They had people greet you at the door and everyone was very attentive. I love the traditional Japanese interior decorations.

The fish was not the best quality I've eaten and the price per piece is pretty expensive considering the quality. There was anago (freshwater eel), mackerel, tuna, salmon roe, scallop, and a couple other types of fish - nothing exciting. Most of the fish was slightly chewy and not buttery like at the higher-end Japanese restaurants. The slightly cold rice was very sub-par and there was too much of it per slice of fish. I ordered an extra two pieces of uni sushi on the side ($8.50 per piece) and was pretty disappointed. The uni wasn't of the best quality, which judging by the price, should have been; this was $4 uni at best in other Japanese restaurants in the city. The (fake) green tea mochi ice cream for dessert was also of the kind that I'm not too fond of - vanilla ice cream with some food coloring and green tea powder instead of the dark colored, slightly bitter real green tea ice cream.

3.0,11/1/2012,"Great food. Baaaad/slow service, which is very unlike the Japanese.  No waters refilled, took forever to sit down, get our check...  Granted, I came here with 2 girlfriends the day after Hurricane Sandy at 8ish,  but still.  Out waiter ended up complaining about a smallish tip (which was not small- we broke it down 3 ways and I paid in cash and he totally didn't discount there was tip in that, he just look at my friends' total on the credit card bill). Getting over the slow service (it was slow but our waiter was good- he made good recos on the authentic Japanese stuff), I have to admit this was a very authentic place for Japanese food. So authentic that the guy next to us who asked for salad with a carrot-ginger dressing got some raised eyebrows.  They don't even have sushi rolls here. This is a Japanese soba house. The soba is very good. I got the Ten Zaru- chilled soba with tempura (2 small shrimps and veggies- not the Jumbo kind. It was very good and had thicker breading, but the panko type). The soba, (which only has 142 calories per 4.5 oz) is really chilled, al dente and fresh. Apparently they cultivate it up in Montreal. My dish was $14 and I felt like I got enough to eat.  It's not the best soba I've had though- that's Cocoron downtown. (My waiter cheekily said that Japanese people eat theirs chilled, American people. hot). My one friend got the seaweed salad and agedashi tofu, which I didn't try but seemed standard and fresh. My other friend got the roasted duck hotpot, which consisted of duck meat, enoki  mushrooms, lots of greens and ricesticks (which she did not want since she doesn't eat carbs). I personally always think this kind of hot pot is overpriced- it was $35 for that and mainly just to boil raw ingredients in front of you.

4.0,9/30/2012,"Authentic Japanese in every way from the food down to the decor. I would've loved to sit seiza style but didn't feel like paying an extra charge for that. I went with 3 other people on a Thursday night and it was pretty empty, save for a two other groups of salarymen. I ordered the kamo nabe (duck nabe that you cook yourself) for my boyfriend and I, a special kabocha dish (Japanese pumpkin), and a plain sake roll (salmon-- surprisingly this wasn't on the menu but they were happy to accommodate me).Well, the waitress misunderstood and for some reason the kamo came out cooked in a single serving bowl floating amidst soba noodles. I knew beforehand I wouldn't be able to try their soba which they're known for because I'm gluten intolerant. I just let my boyfriend enjoy the soup and snuck out a piece of duck to comfort myself. It was yummy-- but then my boyfriend had to rave about how amazingly good the noodles were. :\ That little mishap aside, the kabocha was in a clear, slightly thick broth of ground chicken and overall was a delicate yet tasty dish. I then proceeded to eat the sake rolls and they were fresh and delicious. The biggest surprise I had for the night was the unagi nigiri (eel slice on rice). I was the only one in the group who professed a dislike of eel. The last time I had it, it had a very odd texture almost hairlike. I took the plunge and ordered it upon the urging of my friends that it was just a bad experience and the eel should have another go. It was pretty good-- so good that I don't think I dislike eel anymore! I have seen the other reviews that their sushi is subpar but I have to disagree.Finished the meal with the matcha mochi (green tea flavored-- not the ice cream).

I could eat their beef salad -- and the remaining beefy juices -- all night. They do not skimp on delectable meat!Also of note: the sukiyaki was also really excellent and flavorful.I want to give 5 stars, but I'd say the sushi was subpar. The selection is great, and the prices are what you'd expect in a restaurant like this. However, I've hard larger portions and fresher-tasting fish.Nonetheless, eating here was a very memorable experience and highly recommended!",2,0,1,Jess L.,"Sacramento, CA",3333,4438,3592
5.0,2/15/2011,"An excerpt from Wiki (on Kaiseki):""In the present day, kaiseki is a type of art form that balances the taste, texture, appearance, and colors of food.To this end, only fresh seasonal ingredients are used and are prepared in ways that aim to enhance their flavor. Local ingredients are often included as well. Finished dishes are carefully presented on plates that are chosen to enhance both the appearance and the seasonal theme of the meal. Dishes are beautifully arranged and garnished, often with real leaves and flowers, as well as edible garnishes designed to resemble natural plants and animals.""Albeit a gastronomic capital, there are maybe a handful of places in Manhattan where you can get a true Kaiseki meal. Nippon Restaurant is one of them. Having only been to awesome sister resty Soba Nippon in the past, we expected great things. I mean, what better way to celebrate V-Day than with Fugu right?Boasting having CREATED Beef Negimaki in 1963 and the First Sushi Counter in 1963, they have the white hairs to prove it. In 2006, they were also credited with the 'only importers of natural wasabi from the Gifu prefecture in Japan. Upon walking in, you are greeted by a very respectable elderly gent in a suit and likewise as you walk by the sushi bar. What caught our eye immediately was the huge, shinny copper wok to the right of the sushi counter for all things tempura. Right at that moment, we knew we had to order something made from that wok.A more than reasonable price at $60, their V-Day menu included Fugu, the famed puffer fish, deadly when not prepared properly. In hopes of variety, we ordered one $80 omakase as well. The differences in menu were that with the omakase, you get in addition: 3 appetizers (marinated raw squid, seaweed in vinegar, fresh yuba tofu), 3pcs sushi (medai, amaebi, toro), 2pcs tempura (king crab and mushroom), king oyster, and freshly sliced papaya (vs ice cream), well worth the extra 20 bucks. Else (glass champagne, miso soup, sukiyaki, soba) were pretty much the same, besides that on the V-Day menu, soba was served at the beginning salad style as opposed to being served at the end on the omakase menu.While not a mind-blowing experience, it was a nice treat to finally try this much coveted fish in sushi form. We've tried it in its cooked state at Kyo-Ya, but that's not quite the same. It was served with a dash of seasoned daikon with a tiny scallion strip over it. The fugu texture was a bit stubborn when eating it, one which you don't get clean bites out  of unlike Ika (squid). Appearance was plain white, so white one could have mistaken it for albacore tuna. Zero smell, zero aftertaste, just one of those things that you can check off your list of 'to do' items before you die.The soba here is in a league of its own. They even have their own soba farm in Montreal. As Stuart Scott would say, ""That's dedication, holmes."" They cultivate nihachi soba grains there, comprised of 80/20 buckwheat flour to wheat flour ratio. Competition wise, only Matugen and Sakagura, and their very own Soba Nippon can be mentioned in the same breath. Prior, Soba-Ya and Soba Koh were indeed our favorites. The mouth feel of that super chewy texture witnessed is unparalleled. Some of the grains stick to your teeth and leave a glutenous 'ricey' aftertaste. In our opinion, only when served cold can the true beauty of their soba be truly unmasked.After only two bites of the appetizers, Jeff already knew this would be a 5 star review. How? Restaurant Nippon delivered in EVERY aspect of the kaiseki definition. Every dish is truly a masterpiece with delicate but complex broths, down to their miso soup. To give you an idea, even our miso soup was packed with umami containing burdock, carrots, and nagaimo. The sushi quality was outstanding and super fresh. Service wise, all dishes were cranked out in an expedient manner without being overbearing. Pictures are truly worth a thousand words. If you peruse through our FB album, you'll see what we mean.It's no wonder why Japanese food is Jeff's default Asian cuisine, as when done right, it's the healthiest and preserves the greatest integrity of every ingredient. Even though the notorious fugu was overhyped and didn't numb our mouths like we expected, we still left in awe of what just transpired. We'll be back for years to come as we still want to try their season sashimi dish ($45). We're still baffled why this gem is not packed to the gills, but some things are better that way, especially for those 'in the know'. Consider yourself one of them. We urge you to run, not walk there. As Mortal Kombat would say, 'Flawless Victory'.Total came out to $90/pp after everythingPics are up on our i8NYC FB page...Fugu menu: a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/…V-Day menu: a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/…",3,1,3,Jeff C.,"New York, NY",1152,1258,14

Chose the sushi bar...alone and it was hot. Others filled the main floor basked in the AC. Service deadly slowFish almost alive freshPortion to small to seePrice over priced value for sashimiHit the staples sashimi cambo $45 and a rainbow roll $16. The unfiltered Ohyama Nigori was great but will set you back $45 for 500ml. Was it bad? No. Was I satisfied? NoWill I come back? Not for sushi.

Make sure you order the soba noodle salad or soup. I ordered sashimi and the cuts were fresh and tasty. A word to the wise, this place isnt cheap, so make sure you bring your Amex gold card.

5.0,7/11/2010,"I love places that try to preserve traditions, from food to service. Nippon Restaurant is now on top of my list. They claim to to be the first Japanese restaurant in the US with a full sushi bar, operating since 1963. The service is very typically Japanese, overly courteous. The food is the traditional menu of soba, sukiyaki, sushi, but perfected. Every ingredient is made from scratch -- they actually produce their own buckwheat for their soba and soy for their tofu! If you want wasabe, the server brings over a whole root and grinds it right in front of you! Their sukiyaki is my favorite, and I would eat it even in summer because I don't often get a good sukiyaki anywhere in the US.",1,0,0,Ange B.,"Philadelphia, PA",11,38,21
5.0,7/6/2010,"This restaurant has THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE!  We were a group of eight coming to the restaurant.  Me and a friend arrived early and the rest of our party was in transit, we were surprised that they seated us immediately.  Usually, most establishments make you wait for the whole party to show up.  So I was impressed right away.While my friend and I waited for our dinner companions to arrive, we were attended to, rather than ignored, because we were sitting alone.  Also, the owner of the restaurant came over to our table and made super friendly conversation with us!  Once our dinner guests arrived our orders were taken immediately and we were helped in picking out sushi.  Food took a while to arrive, but I really appreciated that the owner of the restaurant came over personally and apologized for the delay.  I know that specialty food like sushi takes a while, but it was nice for someone to recognize that a simple gesture as providing recognition that your customers are waiting goes a long way. When our food arrived it all looked delicious.  They did forget to bring out my rolls - which normally would have upset me, but the servers and the owner were so nice and apologized profusely, I couldn't hold it against them.  Also, I have to admit - I changed my order after having initially placing it, which could account for the mix up.  It turned out to be a good thing that my food didn't arrive with everyone else's food, because I got try all the different rolls ordered at my table!  Everything was really good, and when my food did arrive it too was delicious. Over all this place had a great mix of customer service, tradition and class.  You really felt like they wanted you to have a good dining experience and the wait staff and owner insured it with their attentiveness.",1,1,0,Kajal A.,"Naperville, IL",3,10,0

4.0,1/31/2010,"Delicious, upscale traditional Japanese restaurant filled w/ lots of Japanese business men. Likes:-Friendly, polite staff dressed in kimonos-Authentic Japanese Green tea-Delicate Homemade Tofu- The owners of this restaurant have a tofu farm in Canada. This dish comes w/ 3 chunks 1 topped with matcha powder, 1 topped with fresh Wasabi and the other topped with salt crystals-Crab miso - broth is very flavorful, and rich - reminds me of very refined Korean Dwenjang soup-Sushi - We got Tuna and Yellowtail w/ scallion rolls. I like the yellowtail slightly better. The seaweed wrap was soft and fresh and the roll was tightly wrapped. The fish was super fresh and the scallion was delicate and crunchy. You must order the fresh Wasabi if you get sushi. They grate the wasabi root right at table. The waitress told us that they're one of few restaurants in the city to have fresh wasabi. They have a contract w/ the top Japanese mountain wasabi root grower.-Agadashi tofu- Hearty lightly fried tofu, tiny mushroom caps (about the size of a chickpea), and grated daikon in soup.-Soba- thick, chewy and cooked al dente. Get soba with tempura. Tempura here is great!!!-Red bean dessert- comes w/ two tiny balls of mochi about the size of a grapeDislikes:-Small portions-Pricey",0,0,0,Grace S.,"San Francisco, CA",239,189,9
5.0,12/29/2009,"It certainly isn't cheap but most particularly good japanese places aren't. It's a good atmosphere and the waitresses are definitely japan status polite (ie not NYC) and you'll never be a loss for service.I ordered a few things:Ten Zaru - Their soba tastes different. It's kind of hard to describe but it just tasted a lot more ""real"" like it was hand made or something. The tempura was well done and at the end they brought some hot dashi to mix with the tsuru as a nice ending touch.The sushi is expensive. You pay $3.50-$10 bucks for one piece so if you're planning on eating just sushi open that wallet! The tuna and yellow tail didn't really stand out but the anago and toro were awesome. The toro will cost you an arm and a leg but one piece, eaten slowly, is so worth it.On a really random note I was sitting next to this guy who actually was the architect of the restaurant 42 years ago. We chatted for an hour and he introduced me to the owner who gave me his card. I, a 22 year old, not in law school yet but slumming around DC kid didn't have much to say but it was pretty cool.And if you're brave they have fugu! i'm not that brave though.",1,0,1,Misha T.,"San Francisco, CA",661,4284,114
4.0,6/16/2009,"This is place is good. but sad. i'll break it down for you. 1st the good.this is one of the 1st japanese restaurants in the USA, and might be the 1st sushi bar in the USA (more on this tidbit in the sad section)they own a farm in canada where they grow their own soy beans, and their own buckwheat for the soba. Those are very good things.  they also use REAL wasabi, something rare  indeed in these here parts. most of us have never had the real deal, and it makes a difference , i assure you,1st we had some sushi, including some anago that was really nicely prepared. then we moved on to soba - the people i was with had hot soba w/ duck, i had cold soba with kasagi tempura. The noodles are amazing, firm to the bite with a strong soba flavor. Having grown up on kasha i know this grain, and theirs was top quality. The broth from teh duck was rich warm and flavorful, the dipping sauce, once the REAL wasabi and scallions were added was fantastic. Not an off note in the meal. The sake was nice, served in a funny teapot like pot, with ice where the leaves would go. now the negs -ok - this place IS costly for what you get. the sad:It was peak hours on a friday night and it was nearly death valley empty. and even so the gaijin were barely deserving of good service, apparently. The place has an old school kyoto kaiseki elegance to it, that spoke of glory days long gone, of a style of eating out that no longer matched what people want in a fine meal. poignant like a faded kimono.so yeah. great meal, but steeped in an aura of existential ennui.",10,6,6,matthew h.,"New York, NY",235,211,3
3.0,5/29/2009,"Don't have too much to say about this place since we had a really quick dinner.  I ordered two rolls, one spicy tuna and a whitetail (?) and scallion roll.  Both were pretty good, but nothing to write home about.  I tried some soba (ordered by another in my party) and it was so-so....very, very chewy.  They seemed to make it out to be worse than it actually was.  Nippon has  friendly staff and a comfy atmosphere.  Don't know if I would return though...",1,0,1,Brian L.,"Philadelphia, PA",93,356,295

But, really, I can't say enough nice things about my meal here-When asked to describe what made my cold chicken soba noodle salad - artfully patterning a plate alongside neat blooms of seaweed, chopped carrots, onions, radishes and a dollop of some wonderful miso vinaigrette - so ostensibly -perfect-, I could only babble incoherently about the texture (the ideal consistency of noodles - cooked through, but retaining a perfect shadow of raw springiness) and the flavor (fresh, fresh, fresh). It was light and filling and delicious; the agadashi tofu starter and best-mochi-I've-ever-had bite-sized mochi dessert (charmingly Japanese - wrapped in rice paper) rounded off the meal really nicely. But, aside from the incredible food, the pleasing, mono no aware aesthetic of the place - clean, quiet, elegant - really enhanced the dining experience.

One person at the sushi bar...nothing for the whole night, wow! So I checked out Yelp, and found NIppon. Nippon is old school sushi, and the Restaurant looks the part. I was the only one at the bar and there were a few lonely single souls at the tables. The decor was old, the bar was old...kind of depressing overall.

The usual suspects, Toro, Scallop, Hamachi, Aji, etc. Saba and the Uni were probably the best two items. I did have one strange clam that I have never tried before, I can't remember the name of it but it was great. So, 2 stars for atmosphere...but 4 stars for the food.

5.0,10/30/2007,"My growing up in a Japanese household has made me a bit of a snob when it comes to Japanese food.  The best Japanese food I've ever had - if in Las Vegas, LA, NY or Japan - has ALWAYS been served by Japanese people.  So, I tend to go for Japanese food at restaurants owned and operated by my people.  No offense to my Asian brothers and sisters - I'd rather have Chinese food prepared by Chinese people... you get the picture.  That being said, Nippon Restaurant is the best sushi I've had in NYC.  My mother comes to visit me for 3-4 days at a time and at least two meals are chowed at this establishment.  And speaking of superstars, any place where Hideki Matsui eats on a regular basis must have some legs cause he's doing something right.  If you have a phobia of going above 14th street like I do, I think you're fine grabbing your Spicy Tuna or California Roll at any number of spots downtown.  This is a place for people who love raw fish - and we're talking about the quality of the fish as well as how it's sliced and diced that sets this restaurant apart.   My old school sushi boomer behind the bar might not be the flashiest guy in town but he knows what he's doing.  Now I'm a sashimi guy, and when I order the Octopus it's always just tender enough... like gelatin.  The Toro always melts in my mouth and the Salmon and Yellowtail have delicious flavors without being 'fishy'.  I could go on but you get the picture.  Always ask what's good - chef serving will know the direction to point you and if you're into the crazy stuff - well they have that too - Sweet Shrimp, Sea Urchin and I believe they even have a fish called Fugu that is poisonous.  It's also important to note that the Tempura is the best I've had in the city as well.  The key to making good tempura, so I've been told, is the temperature of the oil.  And the fact that there is a separate station with a guy focusing solely on that task - well that just makes me feel better.  It's not too greasy, not too battered but just right.  I'm sure the rest of the menu rocks as well, but when I have the opportunity to eat some of the best sushi in town - why would I even bother?",4,1,5,Jeffrey P.,"Culver City, CA",7,6,0

The Canadian -grown soba salad (we ordered the Scottish Salmon Soba Salad) was simply amazing-  as visually appealing as it is to the palate, their salmon is smoked to order and shipped from Europe regularly! Their tempura was simply perfect, light, crispy and airy, as it should be- served with a perfectly fragrant sauce. We ordered sushi rolls to our hearts' content, and had a simply AMAZING Toro Nigiri to end our meal. (OK fine, I bought a cupcake at a bakery later that night, but it was the end of my meal at that point!) Service is fast, efficient, and professional- they definitely know what they are doing, after so many years in the business! Funny thing is, when I was little my mom and dad used to go there in the late 70's, and I didn't realise that until I called them the next day and told them about it. Highly, highly, recommended. I'm only sad we didn't order their FUGU--- (remember Homer Simpson ordering this?) - they are one of a few select places in NYC where you can have this delectable (and exciting!) dish- if it's prepared incorrectly, it releases neurotoxins for which I think there is no antidote...
