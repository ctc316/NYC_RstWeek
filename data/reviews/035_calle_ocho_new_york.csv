5.0,5/1/2019,I was delighted to find this gem on the first floor of my hotel. The service was great and the food was delicious. Their beans and rice for only $8 were to die for - reminded me of my South American friends' home cooking. Great music. Try the langosta/lobster ceviche- so good!,0,0,0,Jill M.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,18,0
4.0,4/25/2019,"Came here with a group of friends for brunch for my birthday. Pros: Food is good, everyone was happy with what they ordered.Wait staff came by at regular intervals to check if we wanted refills on the unlimited sangrias. Drinks were tasty Ambience is great for a group - a bit loud, festiveYou get a bread plate piled high with mini breads, like corn bread and sweet fried dough, when you put in your order. Yumm. Cons:If anyone in your group doesn't drink they will still have to pay for an entree which includes unlimited sangria. No alternatives - this makes sense (no one can cheat by getting a cheap dish and drinking someone else's drinks) but also means u pay regardless of how little u drink. Wait staff will come around to constantly check if you're done - they are trying to clear tables for other groups, so understandable. I thought there'd be something done for my bday since they'd been notified when the reservation was made. Nope. No bday song, no happy bday wishes, no bday dessert, no candle or anything with the one dessert my friends wound up ordering to share. Nada. I enjoyed my brunch anyway but if ur expecting special bday treatment - don't. Overall a fun brunch but would only come with people who'll actually enjoy having unlimited sangria and wouldn't come back for a special occasion/bday. I was a bit disappointed by the lack of anything special being done.",0,0,0,Genevieve R.,"Brooklyn, NY",71,24,8
3.0,4/21/2019,I can only speak on brunch.The food is okay. The drinks are watered down. The hostess was a little rude and the waiter felt away. Very limited options if you don't eat meat.I think I missed the heyday of this place.,0,0,0,Kimberly G.,"Manhattan, NY",4,86,22
4.0,4/16/2019,"Came here last night for date night. I have been here before and I wasn't completely sold on the food. Last two times I had their vaca frita entree. Last night I decided to give their ropa vieja a try. My date and I ended up getting the same Entree and we split the guacamole as a starter. The guacamole was good! The plantain chips were nicely seasoned. Our entrees were pretty great! I was pleased with this selection this time around. The meat was tender and seasoned very well. I got a glass of Riesling and my date got the pineapple mojito. Both drinks were great. For postre I ordered the flan. Unfortunately, it was pretty gross. I was not pleased as it tasted like spoiled eggs but other than that our experience was great.",0,0,0,Iman Salina A.,"Manhattan, NY",2,25,23
3.0,4/15/2019,"Prior to a recent 4-day trip to NY to celebrate my birthday, I requested some recommendations from a cousin who had lived in NY for several  years. This was one of the spots on her list. Overall, I was disappointed.The highlights were the mojitos (order a pitcher and save $), the empanada appetizer, and the churro.The lowlights were both entrees we ordered. He had the Vaca Frita al Caballo: Cuban beef with pork fried rice. I had the paella. Both dishes lacked the depth of flavor and great seasoning traditionally found in Spanish cuisine.The atmosphere was lively, and the service was decent. I would only return the the empanada appetizer and drinks.",1,0,0,Sabra W.,"Alhambra, CA",52,5,10
3.0,4/14/2019,I had such high hopes for Calle Ocho but was left disappointed. The food was okay but lacked flavour other than salt. And the sangrias that everyone raves about were mediocre at best. There are far better bottomless brunches in the city.,0,0,0,Suzanne W.,"New Orleans, LA",1,5,4
5.0,4/9/2019,"So happy I was finally able to come here! It's located in the lobby of the Excelsior hotel. The occasion was my mother's birthday and from the minute we walked in the entire staff was warm and accommodating. The decor is beautiful and all.... but let me get to the FOOD!I completely devoured those complimentary little fried yucca balls. For appetizers we had:Guacamole and plantain chips - Eh... Pretty standard. Salmon ceviche - Incredible!!!! Very fresh fish complemented by cooling lime sauce and spicy jalapeños. This was my first time eating ceviche and I loved it!  Chicharrones - Here at calle ocho, instead of the fried pork bits you may be expecting, it's actually crispy rock fried shrimp in a sweet and sour sauce with pickled onion on top and cole slaw at the bottom. It was delicious. Right off the bat you'll notice Calle Ocho blends an array of different textures and flavors that complement each other in a truly unique way. So for the main entrees we ordered the Paella, Mar y Tierra, Ropa Vieja, and the Salmon. Everyone enjoyed their dish, especially the birthday girl who ordered the beautiful paella. Not only was the presentation on point.. she had leftovers for TWO DAYS!!!! Everything in the dish had heavy flavor for the saffron rice to soak up. SO GOOD.Now I ordered the Mar y Tierra. You know what's funny? Every other review for this place complained about the steak being tough so I was super nervous about ordering it despite being a steak lover. When it came I bit into a really juicy, tender, well-flavored, perfectly charred steak. It had escabeche mushrooms (my fellow Caribbean folks may know this cooking method as escovitch), creamed spinach, and lobster mofongo. I'm not sure if the creamed spinach and mushrooms were necessary but it didn't stop the meal from tasting good. Also, let me explain something - I LIVE for mofongo. So I definitely loved the presentation in the lobster shell. However, being such a hearty eater, I would have preferred a bigger portion straight from the pilon with lobster mixed in versus stuffing a tiny bit into a lobster for the sake of presentation. So the mofongo was delicious but I just really wish there was more of it! That's literally my only critique. #moremofongoplzzzzSo for dessert the birthday girl got complimentary churros (yum!) while other people at the table got tres leches and the dark chocolate cake. But if you ask me -- the #1 dessert at Calle Ocho was the flan. I've never in my life had such perfect flan. I can't even put it into words. Sidenote: I was dancing in my seat the whole time because they play some amazing music! I heard everyone from Celia Cruz to Omega. Overall I absolutely loved this place and I'd come back in a heart beat when I'm ready for some Latin fusion food!",0,0,2,Paige M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3,20,21
1.0,3/30/2019,Place is extremely overpriced..  Cuban food is really inexpensive to make so I'm confused as to why this place cost so much.  To make matters worst the food doesn't even taste good... i had the worst tres leches I've ever had in my life at this place...How do you mess up a Tessa leches?  Criminal!!!,1,0,1,Eric L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,21
2.0,3/30/2019,Not really Cuban food. No restaurant can call it's self it Cuban without pork/lechan on the menu. The beans and rice were acceptable. My husband got the chimichurri steak that was supposed to be like churrasco but instead was regular American steak that tasted like grilled steak with just the chimichurri sauce on top. No yuca offered and the tostones came with guacamole instead of the usual oily sauce. As a South Floridan where Called Ocho actually is this place is a sad imitator. Service was good and seated quickly but food was disappointing.,0,0,0,Kathryn W.,"Fayetteville, WV",0,1,0

3.0,3/28/2019,"This is a true 3 star restaurant in my opinion. The service was fast and attentive, the drinks were good, but the food was nothing to write home about, especially for the price. As someone who has recently been to Cuba, I was really craving good vaca frita. But what I got was not like any I've ever had (see photo). It was just a steak, not shredded, not crispy, over a bed of rice and beans. It tasted fine don't get me wrong, but was not what I was hoping for by any means. Also the ropa vieja was drenched in sauce and those who got it thought it was fine. With that said, we enjoyed the experience, but was not worth the high $20s - low $30s price point per dish.",0,0,0,Andrew F.,"New York, NY",234,74,85

5.0,3/21/2019,"I love Calle Ocho and the servers and chefs are so accommodating. My friend and I ordered the Seafood Paella, and the Pato Chaufa (seared duck) to share. Because we were having so many grains already, we asked if we could do cauliflower fried ""rice"" instead of normal fried rice. The server was super sweet and he was knowledgeable about the menu and the many different substitutions diners have done in the past. The food was delicious and I would definitely come back here again. The only slight inconvenience was how dimly lit the restaurant was and it was a bit loud. Other than that, Calle Ocho is a great dinner spot for Latin American cuisine.",1,1,0,Angela L.,"New York, NY",298,131,411
4.0,3/19/2019,"Calle Ocho is a great spot to brunch with delicious food and good music. Reservations are required and definitely recommended if you plan on getting seated quickly. Groups of ""brunchers"" start lining up close to opening time so don't play yourself! I was surprised how big the layout was as the waiter guided us towards our table around the corner. The restaurant had just opened and was already half full. The energy was great!Our waiter gave us a run down of the menu and gave some recommendations. They offer different flavors of sangria, all unlimited for the hour and thirty minute time limit. Be sure to check out the menu rules (funny and very much enforced).Our food was served within 15-20 minutes of ordering, no bad. I was happy with the service at the start and a little annoyed towards the end. Our waiter kept reminded us of the time limit which came off a little pushy and rude. Also, the drinks were slow to be refilled. Those few details aside, our group was very happy with the food and we had a great time. I would love to come back for more brunch experiences and more sangria! I just ordered the French toast next time because it looked amazing!

3.0,3/14/2019,"I had dinner here a few weeks ago with my son. I arrived early and it was still happy hour so I had a caipirinha and my fiance a mojito. The drinks were well made. The bar area however had a bit of stale bar smell....like an old rag. We moved to the dining room when my son arrived and were seated immediately. It was pretty empty. We ordered the guacamole for appetizer, which was very good. And, free because we checked in on Yelp!!!! Then we ordered our meals. I had the steak, my fiance had fish and my son, the chicken. Firstly, I didn't realize it was a slow cooked steak, so I couldn't order it cooked to my liking.  Also, the server should have said that its 3 steaks.  Way too much for any woman to eat. Both my son and fiance enjoyed their meals, which were normal portions. The service was good. Atmosphere in dining room was nice.",0,0,0,Sunita S.,"New York, NY",92,140,39
5.0,3/13/2019,"This is my favorite brunch spot in NYC. Period.The sangria is amazing. If you're new to Calle Ocho, I recommend the following whites: 1) Blanca, 2) Punta Cana, 3) Havana Banana. The reds are fine, but the whites... everything.I got the Cachapa con Salmon last time and it was FUEGOOO. I also tasted the vaca frita, which was pretty good. The rice was a bit dry, but good. Also, the random bread selections they bring to your table? Also delicious.For $35, you get delicious food and bottomless sangria.

4.0,3/3/2019,"They take reservations on Open Table. I guess I was pretty struck by how expensive everything was but it is a restaurant in a hotel so that's definitely a factor. I almost gave this place three stars because it was so expensive but the food was definitely 5 stars. I loved my ropa Vieja - it was soooooo delicious. The beef, rice, beans, plantains everything was soo good. It was a very large portion, and I, am avid lover of Ropa Vieja, couldn't finish it. That is NOT a criticism! Do not change this! I'll be back to settle the score and there won't even be a grain of rice of the plate. Had I know the bread would be so delicious and the entree be so wonderful, we probably wouldn't have ordered the appetizer - bacon wrapped dates, recommended by the waiter. Pete liked them more than I did. It was fun and fattening.Another reason the food might be so pricy here is that they offer unlimited Sangria with the purchase of an appetizer and an entree. But I only had one glass so it wasn't a huge ""bargain"" for me.The service was lovely - so warm and professional. The waiter made helpful recommendations and the other servers were prompt with refills, offered to wrap things up etc. All of the employees here were gracious and lovely.I will definitely be back for my favorite dish, the Ropa Vieja.

4.0,3/2/2019,"Wife and I love Cuban food and decided to give this place a try. First thing I can say is bring your appetite because these folks don't mess around. My wife had the paella and I had the Cuban Classico and both were excellent! The serving you get relative to the price definitely rates as a great value. We'll definitely return and bring friends.

5.0,2/23/2019,"Celebrated my wedding anniversary at Calle Ocho on the upper west side.  It had been close to ten years since we visited this restaurant and the food and service has not changed...it totally deserves the 5-star rating.Mar y Tierra was amazing with a medium-rare steak and wild mushrooms, creamed garlic spinach and loaded mashed potatoes with Lobster.  Loved it!My wife had the Cubano Clasico which is a classic Ropa Vieja (see photo).We had the bread pudding w/ coconut ice cream to share.  To our surprise, the waiter brought a complimentary flan along with candles as part of our anniversary celebration. Both desserts were very good but the coconut ice cream stole the show.For cocktails, the Spanish Harlem Sangria was good but lacked that wow factor that I anticipated from its description.  It was good but not too different from an ordinary sangria.  I was looking for more of a cinnamon kick like a dash of fireball or a cinnamon stick garnish.I switched to the traditional caipirinhas which totally met my expectations. My wife had a specialty cocktail that included lychees and banana (not sure of the name)...it was very  refreshing but it wasn't a favorite.Lastly,  the ambience was intimate and the sounds of Salsa in the background just complemented the whole experience.I look forward to returning.",1,0,0,Rafael D.,"NY, NY",96,83,115

4.0,2/22/2019,"My friend who lives in New York recommended this spot. I was sold as soon as he said ""brunch with bottomless sangrias""! Ordering is quite straightforward. There are about 10 brunch entrees on the menu. You pick any one for $34.95, and that includes bottomless sangrias from the 8 drinks, half of which are red wine and half of which are white.They have some house rules around the bottomless sangrias, which to me is just common sense. You can only have one drink at a time, and while there is no hard time limit, you shouldn't take forever to finish the last bite of food.I tried two drinks, the Tropical and Havana Banana, and both were light and fruity. Yum! They also serve bread at the beginning of the meal. I loved the cornbread.For my entree, I went with the Vaca Frita, which is Cuban skirt steak served over Latin pork fried rice, with avocado and two fried eggs on the side. Both the steak and eggs were good, but the texture of the fried rice was off and didn't feel fully cooked. The eggs were fried just right with the yolks still runny. Overall, it was a hearty meal, especially with all the rice, but I didn't think it was amazing. Still, I can't complain, since I'm really here for the bottomless sangrias :)Definitely make reservations in advance.

We ordered the calamari frito as an appetizer and it was just okay. I probably wouldn't order again. I got the Mar y Tierra and substituted the mushrooms and asparagus for tostones and and sweet plantains. The meal brought a stuffed lobster with mofongo inside. The food was flavorful but the steak was on the dry side. My boyfriend enjoyed his paella, I had a few bites and it was PHENOMENAL.  Overall, the service was great and the food was delicious.

4.0,2/17/2019,"Came here for Valentine's Day and we had a good experience. We were seated quickly even on such a busy day but it took a little while for our server to ask what we wanted to drink. Our seats were a little too close to the other two couples on each side of us but it didn't ruin our experience at all. The food was very good. I had the steak with yuca fries, arugula and pickled onions salad and rice and beans. My boyfriend had the chicken with cole slaw and lobster mashed potatoes. The favorite part out of both dishes was definitely the lobster mashed potatoes and the rice and beans. I do not recommend the yuca fries though. They did not come with the usual garlic sauce that most places serve them with and they really needed it because they were super dry and hard.

1.0,2/16/2019,The absolute worse brunch experience I've ever had in my life. First of all you CAN NOT get your own sangria the way they advertise online! Second I ordered the shredded beef with home fries and eggs and they dead ass told me that I could not get the home fires separate. They then proceeded to bring me a plate with half of my food missing. I had to ask multiple times for the home fries and fries egg that came with my meal. As if things couldn't get any worse they turned off all the lights around 330pm and refused to turn them back on. When my sister approached the manager he told her that the lights weren't off and that they turn them off at 4 pm when brunch is over as a way of encouraging people to finish up and leave (at this point it might've been 345) either way people were still eating and drinking and definitely didn't sign up to eat and drink in the dark.

5.0,2/15/2019,"Calle Ocho is a latin cuisine mixed with fine dining establishment. With salsa playing in the background and great vibes. As my girlfriend and I arrived we were seated quickly even with the influx of people who were there for V-day dinners. They start off with giving you these smart bread rolls with a taste of sugar (at least I think thats what is was) that made me want to take a basket with me. Our server was very efficient in providing us the best the service he could. We started off with a pitcher of tropical sangria that I had to keep drinking because of how good it was. For the entree, my girlfriend ordered the bistec medium well. She shared a piece with me and my god, it was soft and tender. Seasoned very well so kudos to that. I ordered the pollo a la brasa and it wasn't overwhelming. I also replaced the steamed Yuca with Lobster mashed potatoes and it definitely was a great addition to my meal. I didn't even know that lobster mashed potatoes was even a thing till last night. For what we paid, it was worth every penny.

Table service was attentive and thorough as no mistakes were made and food and drinks were continuously arriving and being ordered. Their happy hour specials and pricing were made available to us. Folks that desired to order their own tabs were able to do so without a hitch. The food was delicious as were the expertly made drinks. Premium drinks are reasonably priced, as a round of 6 shots was under $100 before gratuity.  One of my colleagues was unable to find his credit card after paying and the manager himself made it his mission to find it.

3.0,1/31/2019,"Our group of four selected Calle Ocho for our first NY Restaurant Week dinner. The restaurant provided a prix fixe menu consisting of several meat and pescatarian friendly dishes. Cocktails were fine, but nothing overly fantastic. Our appetizers (pineapple shrimp skewers, beef enchiladas and a selection of Brazilian breads) were good, slightly salty, but decent. Our main courses were flavorful, but again, slightly salty. My partner had the chicken dish, which was accompanied by plantains and a bed of rice and peas. The rest of us ordered the broiled fish dish, which was delicious, and surprisingly better when reheated. Dessert at Calle Ocho was delicious. Our group of four shared the Tres Leches and the Domino cake. Both dishes were served with ice cream and ended the meal quite well. Now, the two star miss? Our server. If I remembered his name, he would be mentioned in this review. Long story short, our mystery server missed a drink order, had a bad attitude, and seemed like he was just ready for his evening to come to an end.

There was so much flavor there! It was delicious. Our waiter was really friendly. The only issue was we had to keep looking for someone to get us our new drinks.

We were told the kitchen closed at 3 so I picked the first thing I saw in the menu and ordered my friends dish so that she would have food when she arrived. She showed up 2:30 and we were just having a great time. You can get bottomless sangrias as long as you are still eating.

He claimed he told us the sangria stopped at 4, but he didn't. Also, we asked three people for more sangria at 3:30 and no one showed up with sangria. I was not amused at all.

Once we finally got seated, I had to wave down the waiter to get service. For brunch, they have a ""deal"" that for $35 you get an entree and unlimited sangria. The catch is you cannot get your drinks until you get your meal AND you can't get drinks after you finish your meal. So basically you need to eat slow to make sure you get the most out of the deal.

The favorites for us were the Fresas for red and Tropical for white.Food is also awesome. I ordered the ropa vieja, which is tender shredded beef with onions, home fries, and a fried egg, and absolutely loved it even if it was pretty salty. My friends' shrimp with grits (super cheesy and decadent) and chilaquiles (huge portion size), and the shared appetizer of plantain chips and guac, were also great.The dining room area was full when we came so we were seated in the inner lounge instead, and actually ended up liking that more because it was a brighter, more open space and you could people watch better. Service was a little slow because of the frenzied brunch rush but very friendly and accommodating nonetheless. Overall a really fun vibe with the loud Latin music (but not loud enough that you couldn't have conversations) playing too.",1,0,2,Millie S.,"Manhattan, NY",384,284,415

Since it was a large group, I had to put a $200 deposit down but never met the manager I set up with. We were all there 15 min early. Seated at 12 and didn't get taken out sangria order till 12:15, food was rushed off the table after 20 minutes of it being served, and they cleaned up the table and had us move at 1:45. This may sound arbitrary... but when you are already limited to 2 hours for a party of 18 every minute counts. Called before hand and ask waiter to sing khappy birthday to one of guest.

This is a big place, and is also made up of a few different rooms. Each one is alive and bumping with good music that'll make you wanna dance...especially after you've had a few of their sangrias.Which brings me to...UNLIMITED SANGRIAS--and delicious and strong ones at that. I'm a fan of red and go for their Barcelona. Everyone at our table tried different ones and loved each kind. These sangrias are unlimited during brunch with your meal--two hour time limit which is plenty given how strong they make these.Second of all, their food is also amazing. I got the Vaca frita last time which was fantastic. And overall I don't ever remember going here and having a food item I didn't like.

They offer unlimited sangrias, but it's really cheap liquor they used. I sent the first two drinks back because it was disgusting. It's a given that some locations might prepare stuff whether food or drinks ahead of time due to demand and time regarding brunch, but at least put some effort into it. Don't offer 8 selections of sangrias, instead focus on maybe 2-3, but make it tasteful for customers. Especially when you charge $34.95 per entree.

They have about 10 or so different sangrias (both light & dark) and they all vary in taste and different special ingredients/components in them. They serve the sangria in cups that are bigger than usual and all of the sangrias have a nice little kick to them.Whenever someone's cup was empty,our waitress was very attentive and asked us if we wanted a refill(you are allowed to switch flavors).What I enjoyed about this brunch is that the meal is about $30 and it comes with 'complimentary sangria' as long as you are still working on your food so it's no 'real' time limit to your bottomless sangrias but you can't just BS during your meal trying to be slick to extend the time.The food was also amazing here.I had the skirt steak with fried rice & friend eggs.The steak was cooked perfectly and the rice was good and very well seasoned.The menu has so many options that sounded tasty so I am defiantly looking forward to going back to try a different food option and to take advantage of their string but tasty sangria options again.",0,0,0,Mark S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",10,158,258

The fact that the food was BANGING!This was my birthday brunch from my Sister and Mom and I loved this!Mom ordered shrimp and grits, Sis had the Coquito dipped French toast and I had Steak with pork fried rice, avocado and eggs. The three of us all tried each meal and had almost every sangria on the menu. We all agreed that Mom's meal was most delicious! My Sis gave up shrimp awhile ago, but, even she had to admit it was a great dish. Smokey and grits had a great consistency. Her coquito french toast was delicioso and her bacon was crisped perfectly and they weren't stingy either! My Vaca frita was: Cuban skirt steak over pork fried rice with avocado and eggs fried perfectly was damned good. Steak was tender to fork and rice was well done and paired right. The meals were $30 a piece but taking into consideration, unlimited Sangrias, wasn't a bad price line at all. I tend to stick to white liquors so I had the tropical, havana banana and punta cana. Also, had a Awesome Spanish Harlem which was a red but delicious. My favorite was the havana banana which didn't taste like much banana to me but very tropical and delectable. Had a piece of fresh coconut and a lychee in it, making it my favorite instantly.  The ambiance was vivid and lively with lots of chatter, upbeat tempos and sounds.  Beautiful colors giving it a very Mexican vibe.

As my brunch option i got the Vaca Frita. The portion was very small and the plate was even smaller, made it difficult to eat off a tiny plate.My gf and our friend got the Burrito Mananero which they assumed was vegan because no chorizo was in it. After we let waiter know he defended that there was and 4 mins later came back with a bowl of chorizo for table. It shouldn't have got to that point but thanks for accommodating.

I couldn't tell who my server was because he rarely came and we had to flag another server over and over again. The complimentary bread that once amazed me has been reduced to muffins and a different bread from the options served 3 years ago. The salmon dish was sad. The salmon was the size of a deck of cards. The eggs was about 3x that on that plate. Definitely not worth $30. The sangria was very strong and it's clear most people come for that because the food is honestly pretty subpar. My parents are also feeling sick after just two glasses of sangria. They think it's because the wine the restaurant uses is cheap. Especially because my parents are solid drinkers (they're Korean, we drink soju on the regular). Lastly, the restaurant is poorly maintained. There was a dirty napkin underneath our table.

I only got to try 2 flavors. My favorite was Tropical. For food we shared the vaca frita and ropa vieja. Both came out in seconds! I am almost certain that they use the same cheap meat as steak and in the ropa vieja. But still delicious and tender. The ropa vieja was great paired with the most creamy guacamole and runny eggs but after a few bites the sauce got overwhelming.

It's a bit noisy but the music is good and it definitely adds to the Latin atmosphere. The menu was $30 for an entree and included all you can drink flavored sangrias. I loved the idea of bottomless flavored sangrias compared to the typical all you can drink mimosas at most brunch places. The drinks were spot on! Lots of yummy flavors to choose from, and they were all good quality (I.e. not watered down or overly sweet). You got a good portion of wine in them too so prepare to feel a little tipsy if you are really trying to get your money's worth at this brunch. I went with a party of four and we got started off with drinks and muffins. The muffins were soft and lightly flavored. Perfect with the sweetened whipped butter they serve. Then our entrees came out and they were a pretty decent portion. The Vaca Frita and the Gallitos were the biggest portions in my opinion. But those are not as flavorful as some of the other choices. I thought the eggs needed some extra salt and pepper and wish I had some available on the table to help myself to - especially because the waiters didn't come around very often. But the meats were tasty, especially the rope vieja! The shrimp and grits dish was also very tasty, and so was the guacamole and plantain chips appetizer. It was definitely enough to share!

Since we are visiting New York during Thanksgiving time, we have already made brunch reservations for that Sunday for the whole famUpdate: it's now Thanksgiving weekend, and we made brunch reservations for tomorrow at noon, but starting to rethink our choice for where to go, only because Calle Ocho has begun charging the same price of ""$29 per person, including unlimited sangrias, despite what sort of entrée the diner orders. To be honest, unlike the three other visits here, I am surprised to learn that an omelette with mushrooms and goat cheese, cost the exact same thing as a skirt steak with fried rice. My biggest problem with the whole situation however, is that one of our daughters just turned 19, so obviously, she won't be drinking at all! Guarantee, she will probably select the omelette tomorrow, which means we are stuck paying close to $30 for eggs and no alcohol. of course, the easiest thing would be to cancel the reservation and go someplace else, but we don't want to disappoint the family, especially at the very last minute.

Turned out to be a really nice Cuban restaurant and I found everything to be excellent from start to finish. The restaurant has a very nice, intimate and romantic ambiance with salsa music playing softly in the background. As for the food, we ordered the calamari to share as appetizer and then the vaca frita (skirt steak) and bistec (steak) as entrees and the steaks were seasoned and cooked perfectly. I also tried the fresas sangria which was delicious and the hostess, servers and waiters were all friendly and super attentive. Although we were both pretty stuffed after the entrees, we still went ahead and shared the flan for dessert since the dessert menu looked pretty tasty and I believe there's always room for dessert. The flan was a hit in my book. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice restaurant serving great Latin food.

The steaks have fat and tendon at the same time which make the steak tastes ambrosial.Last to mention, but served first is the complementary bread, the black sesame butter decorates the creamy taste of the bread perfectly.The only deficiency is that the tables and sofas are kind of worn-off so that the overall environment is not decent.

Going inside, the restaurant had a nice ambience with Latin American music, which was quite enjoyable. Service quality was ok, other than the fact the waiter accidentally flipped over our bread basket and took forever to give us the lemon we requested. Frankly, was quite disappointed with the food experience. We ordered empanadas, chicharron, and paella. The empanada crust was dry and on the ""hard"" side, difficult to chew on, the sauce was way too sour. The chicharron was ok, but slightly on the sweeter side. The paella (which I had been looking forward all night) was quite a disappointment. It was way too bland. Sure, it had a lot of seafood and was pleasantly presentable, but the lobster and crab was very tasteless. It tasted like rice with some seafood, pepper and onions. What saved the day was their bread. It was the best part of this entire meal. Complementary bread placed in cigar boxes, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside like mochi bread.

Our waiter came to our table almost immediately after we were seated to take our drink/appetizer orders and kept coming back to our table to ask if we wanted more sangria without us having to get his attention.For $30, there were plenty of entrée and bottomless sangria options to choose from. Given the area, this is an amazing deal. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this place is situated within a fancy hotel. I really liked the ambiance/music and our booth was very comfortable.Cons: If you are really hungry, I suggest ordering an appetizer (the plantain chips and guacamole are delicious!) because the portions were on the small side. I ordered the huevos rancheros and if it weren't for the appetizer that we ordered beforehand, I think I would have still been hungry. The food was delicious though.We kept getting sangria flavors that we did not order.

3.0,8/14/2018,"Very conflicted between giving 3 or 4 stars. Visited today during happy hour to try their restaurant week menu and it was just okay. We arrived before the dining room was open so we sat at the bar to have a few drinks. The bartender was cool and the happy hour menu is great, I loveddd the mojitos ($7, $12 outside of HH). The hostess told us we couldnt get the HH prices at the table but she must have been wrong. Once we were moved to the dining room our waiter came over right away - granted we were the only people in the restaurant lol. I love the pandebono they give as a starter, its sooo good especially when paired with the refried beans or butter. As for the restaurant week menu, I ordered the Don Picon as an appetizer and did not enjoy it. The slaw it came with was really yummy but thats about it, I dont think the blue cheese really goes well inside the empanada. I ordered the carne vacuna as an entree and did not enjoy it either. I asked it for it medium but it was overcooked in certain spots and then too rare in others. My coworkers ordered the other two entrees (Parguito//Tunko) and seemed to really enjoy their meals. Dessert was spectacular, you get to pick whichever you want from their regular menu and it was so hard to choose because they all sounded great. Ultimately we tried the dominos, mango buddin, and flan and they were all amazing.Staff was super friendly but service got extremely slow as more people started coming in and the restaurant was nowhere near full. As always, the space itself is beautiful and they play great Latin music. Will I be back? Maybe for brunch because the bottomless sangria deal can't be beat.

My friend got the duck on fried rice, and that was very good, not super fatty and very nicely cooked. My drink was underwhelming to the point that I'm not even sure what it is thinking back a few hours, a mojito I think, whatever it was it had some pomegranate in it.

The waiter immediately started us off with our sangria of choice and brung out these amazing little pastries with what I believe was strawberry butter?!? (I was so mind blown by the existence of this butter). We ordered the popular Vaca Frita, but it took a while for it to come out. Our neighbors got their food first even though we ordered before them. BUT how can we complain with bottomless sangria ?!? We downed two huge glasses before our food came. Once it came, I dived right in. The meat was tender, the egg was cooked perfectly, and the rice and beans reminded me of home. My girlfriend was too full from the sangria to eat much so be careful!!!

4.0,7/24/2018,"Calle Ocho is a great place if you're really into sangrias! For $30, you get a large entree, complimentary bread appetizers, and endless sangrias. I got the Vaca Frita. The steak was a bit over cooked and chewy for my liking. The rice was okay and the tomato-onion salad was amazing!! I loved how perfectly the eggs were cooked (a bit runny which paired well with the rice) and that it came with an avocado. But truthfully if you can't down that many sangrias--you will probably be able to find even better quality brunch elsewhere for a better bargain!",0,0,0,Sharon C.,"Gainesville, FL",258,76,54

The bread is fantastic and diverse. The butter is fantastic and not heavy. You'll enjoy it. Also makes for great conversation.All entrees are super well done, congrats to the restaurant for having such a solid selection.The sangria's are not light, and the glasses are large. Would be cool if the restaurant did smaller glasses so we could try more flavors. Service is good.

3.0,7/16/2018,"Came at 12 pm on a Sunday and had reservations for a table of 7. Super loud music made it hard to have a normal conversation (though kind of entertaining to yell things at my friend and have him answer it completely incorrectly).It's great to have unlimited sangria, but the sangria itself was just okay.I got the Maiz y Camarones, and it was a bit soupy/mushy for my liking, but my wife seemed to enjoy it. Yuca fries weren't bad, but other than that, the 7 people at our table just thought the food was average.The best thing of the entire meal was the little white circular bread for the table (not sure exactly what it was). If the music is turned down a notch, the sangria was a bit colder and had better wine, and if the food was a bit more crisp/fresh/tasty, this could probably be a 4 star for me.",1,0,0,Mike C.,"New York, NY",6,319,0

And with sooo many choices it was so much fun taking the family there... But now, you're greeted with no emotion and zero engagement from the staff.. sad. The menu has changed...  and the famous sangria Sunday's is no more.... instead the waiter be littles you into buying an appetizer plus entre for each individual ... wtf????So a family of 5 means 5 appetizers?????Come on guys, be real.... is this a Cuban restuarant?Knowing very well as Latinos we ALWAYS SHARE...Very very disappointed... hope it gets better,Owner/management ... don't forget how you got here,,, and what made us love you in the first place..The waiter didn't even tell us the Vaca Frita is not available, or that there's no Lobsters for the Paella  until we ordered it...

This was where my brother wanted to spend his birthday, so I made a reservation in plenty of time. Mentioned that it would be a birthday. Confirmed day of, again mentioning the birthday. I was told that there would be dessert with his name written on it, and candle. We get there, wait a good 15-20 minutes to have even our drink order taken. Listen to - coincidentally - two other 'Happy Birthday' songs being sung to other people in the restaurant. We order dessert. Desert arrives, nothing, no candle, no song. At this point -- with the lack of service (the table busser was great, wish he had been our waiter), I point it out. The guy said he'd get his team for a song and stick a candle in the dessert (at which point the fun is already sort of ruined). Comes back 'sorry, I can't get my team together, we'll take off the dessert, last round of coffee'. Which, I suppose, was the least they could no.

5.0,7/6/2018,"I'm very surprised by the negative reviews here as last Saturday, I had a GREAT experience here.It may have helped that I made a reservation 2 months in advance for the first seating at 12pm. It started off relatively quiet--which according to other reviews, I certainly wasn't expecting.It was just me and my husband so perhaps that helped as well.They sat us in the perfect table in the corner booth which gave us a great view of the place and a super comfortable place to be. The music was all salsa and it was so good--I love when themed food restaurants have music that makes sense. One of my favorite Greek places plays techno and it's the legit worst. Anyhoo, I felt like they really did go out of their way to make sure we had a great experience.Our waiter was wonderful and our glasses were never empty--water, coffee or sangria-wise. I asked him if we could have small samples of the sangria before we decided on one (they are BIG glasses) and I wasn't sure if it was possible, but he said yes! So we were able to choose our favorite before ordering. Commitment-phobes around the globe unite in glee!I had the salmon with eggs and corn pancakes and it was DELICIOUS. My husband had the grits and shrimp which he enjoyed--but I also have to give a special shout-out to the bread and muffins. I could eat those all day.We shared a dessert and by the time we were done, it did get quite loud and frat-y so the moral of the story is, book for the first seating for a quality, great experience and you'll be golden.Would love to come back here again.",1,0,0,Galit T.,"New York, NY",47,167,4

And while I understand why it is pricey, it is in Central Park west in a hotel but let's make sure you add happy hour, ok? I believe it is needed if you want to keep momentum.

Again, the food is amazing but it makes no sense to pay for unlimited drinks if you're only going to give me one and then disappear and avoid me the rest of the meal. I've also gone for dinner, it was late mid-week so not very busy at all, and still the server took a long time to take our order and bring the food out.

I ordered the Gallitos and thought it was phenomenal. 10+ tortillas, chorizo, scrambled eggs, guacamole and home fries. Totally enough for three big deals! I started with red sangria, and choose Fresas, but was served Sambra. I was nervous about the brandy, but I thought this was insanely good. It's definitely strong, but not overly boozy, so pace yourself. I switched to white sangria next and ordered the Havana Banana. Although also delicious, I preferred Sambra. Service was a little spotty. We dropped a fork on the floor and actually had to get up and get ourselves a new one.

Just a total variety of random ingredients that somehow came together well and made for a satisfying meal. But then again after barely eating the entire day, aside from one bagel, I would have eaten almost anything at that point besides Indian food.

Ordered the octopus and it was cooked and seasoned to perfection. So tender and yummy. When we got seated for dinner, we ordered the lobster ceviche (free with a check in!) to share and I got the sea bass and my date got the duck as entrees. They all had such different flavors and we loved them. The sea bass was our least favorite. The portions are very big. We ordered the flan and espresso. Was not my favorite part of the meal but it was decent. The service was friendly and the ambiance was casual. The BEST part of the meal was the complimentary bread that came with a black bean dipping sauce. It's made with yuca flour so it was sticky and soooooo good. Going to come back just for that lol.

We ordered a bottle of their Cabernet Sauvignon from Spain. It was good. We started with the camarones for an appetizer, which I enjoyed. My boyfriend thought they were too sweet. For dinner, I ordered the paella and my boyfriend ordered the salmon. Both entrees were extremely bland. It was so disappointing because I saw all the great reviews for the paella, which was what brought me here. The lobster in the paella had no taste, it didn't even pick up flavors from the rice.

We had the Cabernet Sauvignon from Spain it was delicious. Only reason i am giving restaurant 3 stars is because the food as appealing as it looks did not have the taste of authentic latin cuisine. My girlfriend had the paella which was a huge dish (no complaints) but as she ate her lobster she stopped and had me take a bite. The lobster texture was cooked well however it was bland.

Food is tasteless and btw that Vaca frita is NOT Vaca frita, its not even fried. I chose to eat here because of the amount of good reviews it had and star ratings (which are very inaccurate) and obviously everyone in the reviews saying how this place is great, delicious, etc has definitely never been to an actual real good Cuban restaurant before because this place is definitely the worst that I've tried.

When I pointed this out to the bartender (I'm sitting at the bar), he gave me the explanation that ""this is how they serve it now. "" He didn't seem to see the irony in telling me that ""the way they serve"" cauliflower steak is not to serve cauliflower steak. The dish was tasty, so I decided not to send it back. But I wanted a dish of vegetables with a little rice AS THE MENU DESCRIBES, not a rice dish with a bit of vegetable.  The bartender gave me a drink for free, which was fine since I did want a second drink.  But if I hadn't wanted a second drink,  I would have been screwed.  I conclude that the owner or is an a-hole, and the bartender did what was in his power to do for me, but that the owner would not have allowed him to give me a discount on the meal.

Everyone was probably sleeping after a heavy night of drinking and overdosed on Mexican food already. More room for me!It's located in a hotel but the atmosphere is relaxed and allows for pretty casual dress. The service was friendly and quick. I got to try many flavors of their sangria (they have tons!), but my favorites were Samba, Spanish Harlem, and Roja.The portions were huge! Prices were very reasonable considering the portion size plus bottomless sangria. I originally thought I would have to order a side to keep the sangria flowing as they stop serving once you finish your food, but the one meal lasted me the entire time.I had the Ropa Vieja which was delicious! I also tried a bit of the Gallitos, which were good, but man... that beef on the Ropa Vieja was too good to pass up. I'd order it without a doubt if I came again.",0,0,1,Mihael K.,"New York, NY",122,452,1009

5.0,5/11/2018,"Came here for a boozy birthday brunch, and it was fantastic. The food is delicious - Vaca Frita in the pic, everything was cooked to perfection, and my friends enjoyed their brunch entrees too. But you really come here for the sangria. Each entree entitles you to two hours of that delicious firewater, and it is GOOD. I tried two of the reds and one of the whites. All three were full of flavor without being too sweet. Our server was incredibly responsive and never hesitated to refill our glasses during the 2(+) hour window. But the drinks do pack a punch, so maybe the free-flowing sangria is a double-edged sword, unless you're into the whole ""I'm gonna be drunk all day today"" move.",0,0,0,Cyrus A.,"Manhattan, NY",154,138,167
3.0,5/9/2018,"I've been wanting to try this place for brunch for a while because of their extensive selection of bottomless sangria! Unfortunately, I was left disappointed. At first, I thought the noise level would be moderate since it's located inside a hotel, but I was completely wrong; it was so loud! Although that has nothing to do with their food and drinks, just be prepared for a noisy brunch. Now to the food...we ended up ordering the Vaca Frita, Latin Benedict, and Pollo Ranchero. We practically tried all of the flavors of sangria.Vaca Frita: steak with fried rice and egg. I asked for the steak to be cooked to medium, but it came out close to well done. However, it was still pretty tender. There was nothing that stood out in the dish except that it was salty. Latin Benedict: this was the best dish that we ordered. It is made up of a poached egg with sausage on top of an arepa. The dish had a slightly sweet, yet salty flavor, which made it tasty. Pollo Ranchero: not much to say except that it was edible, but not that great. Just add hot sauce to make it better.Overall, don't expect amazing food. People come here for their bottomless sangria. It's a good place for big groups. They have a great selection of sangria, but all the reds and whites ended up tasting the same. Their drinks were too sweet for my liking. If you want the strongest drink, get the Fresas (it has vodka).",3,1,2,Aaron S.,"New York, NY",292,180,1074
3.0,5/8/2018,"We saw that this place only had 2 stars on yelp, so we decided to try it - weren't looking for anything too expensive. However, the average for an entree is $35.

Cons: service is awful so while you're paying for unlimited drinks you'll be lucky to get 2. The restaurant is so incredibly loud which may be fun for you but be prepared. The bread basket used to be overflowing and with refills. The last time I was there, we got one roll for each person and that's it. We had to ask 6 waitstaff members for more and even then it took at least an hour or so. Food is fine. Nothing special but something on the menu for everyone.

2.0,5/6/2018,"It pains me to leave this review because the people here were so welcoming and kind.  Despite their kindness, my patience was tested by coming here on a Saturday evening with my mother. We were seated and waited ~15 minutes before we were approached for an order. That seemed okay. The food took a while to come out which also seemed normal on a Saturday night. But once we got our food we didn't see anyone for quite a while. The food was very bland and my mother stated her food tasted old and reheated. I tried her rice and beans and they were definitely not fresh. Her entire dish had a lack of flavor. She ordered the Lechon. It was terrible. The meat was dry and flavorless. The rice and beans were also dry and the beans tasted like cardboard. The sauces the dish came with were delicious though. I dumped an entire one on my salmon to give my poor dry salmon some juice. With my salmon dish came lobster mashed potatoes and these were shockingly bad as well. The two pieces of lobster were chewy, flavorless, and some how didn't taste like lobster? Maybe it was old or frozen lobster? It just tasted odd. Overall the food was bland and definitely not fresh or well made. The service was inattentive but the waiters were so kind. They even let us move over to a more quiet space which we really appreciated. I think they were just busy but on a Saturday night waiting for the check for 25 minutes just isn't acceptable. I would never return here. I also felt sick after consuming their food- as did my mother.

Instead of what I ordered They brang out a dish that had pork which I do NOT eat and they weren't apologetic about it instead they tried to convince us to keep the dish because it would take too long to get my order right I disagreed and told them I will wait. When my order finally came out they still got it wrong I told the waiter  no bacon like 5 times(I wish I was exaggerating) still came out with bacon and the lobster literally looked like someone ate half of it.

4.0,4/8/2018,"Snagged a reservation months in advance for the infamous bottomless sangria brunch. The place opened at 12 which is when our reservation was. People were already waiting outside the closed doors. As you walk in there are already glasses of sangria lined up to be taken to customers. Atmosphere: -Good service, although it seemed like one waiter was working the whole section-No windows inside, but colorful walls and prints everywhere -2 single use bathrooms, always a lineFood and drink: $29.95 for an entre which comes with bottomless sangria capped at 2 hours (they're pretty strict about the time limit). Some different breads came out and were continually replenished through the meal (one that is disk shaped and flat had caramel inside! Others were cheese breads or various muffins). Our table shared a bunch of items: Gallitos (platter of Costa Rican foods to build your own tacos with scrambled eggs, chorizo, lettuce, salsa, avocado, potato)Maiz y Camarones (sauteed shrimp with bacon, cheese grits, corn, poached egg)Cachapa con salmon (sweet corn pancakes, salmon, scrambled eggs, salsa, avocado, onion, capers) Ropa Vieja - Cuban style shredded pork with onion, pepper, potato, eggVaca Frita - Cuban style skirt steak, pork fried rice, avocado, fried egg The Gallitos plater was fun to share amongst us. The salmon plate was a little bland and had SO MANY scrambled eggs vs anything else on the plate, probably the least favorite of the group. The Ropa Vieja and Vaca Frita were good if you like meat. Overall the portions were HUGE and none of us could finish. I got the feeling they do that on purpose to minimize people over drinking...On to the sangria: Flavors (white):Havana Banana (coconut rum, creme de banana, coconut, lychee) Punta Cana (La Tipica Mamajuana, peach, pineapple, orange)Tropical (Light rum, orange, mango, pineapple)Blanca (Brandy, oranges, lemons, apples) Red:Samba (acai liqueur, brandy, blueberries)Fresas (rasberry, vodka, citrus, strawberry)Spanish Harlem (dark rum, cinnamon, peach, mandarins)Roja (brandy, oranges, lemons, apples)My favorite was the Havana Banana for the white and Roja for dark. Havana Banana felt the strongest of the first four but had a delicious taste of lychee that wasn't too sweet. The other 3 whites were REALLY sweet, I had to switch to reds. I liked the Roja the best because it had a really full flavor and not too sweet, but the Samba was my second favorite because it also had good flavor without being overpowering. The Fresas and Spanish Harlem were really sweet and tasted like your standard sangria. Overall this was a fun experience for bottomless and had a good ambiance and experience. The food was okay, almost felt buffet style due to the portions and shared ingredients between all the dishes. I loved that there are so many flavors of sangria to try -- the only thing is that the glasses are so huge (regular water glasses), so by the time you drink one glass you're already so full of liquid.

There were many other parties in combat with the sangria, so it was a bit tough to hear my own platoon. We rallied, however and ordered our first drinks.I ordered the Havana Banana, ready for war, but as I took my first sip I realized something was off. The drink was far too sweet. I tasted the drinks of my friends, and theirs too, were sickeningly sweet. Morale immediately plummeted. How could we get smashed at 12PM with drinks this cloying?The food was a wonderful respite from battle. The beef in the ropa vieja was perfectly cooked and the addition of egg was a wonderful brunch treat. The gallitos were probably the highlight. So much food was put in our faces and I loved the DIY aspect.But alas, the drinks overpowered us. Even us, veterans of dozens of drunk brunches, were vanquished by the syrupy oversweet drinks.

3.0,2/25/2018,"So the food and drinks here are FABULOUS.  I decided to start with the most positive thing because I honestly hate that I could not give the restaurant a higher rating in good conscious.  I came for brunch on a Saturday morning. My friend made a reservation for 2. We sat and were greeted immediately.  The menu contains entrees for $30 with complimentary bottomless sangria.  Yummy, delicious, STRONG sangria.  They had 4 red options and 4 white options ordered according to levels of sweetness. I am a Bloody Mary gal. I was excited to order their version of a Bloody Mary which contained Sriracha but the waiter told me that even though it was on the menu they were no longer serving it and they were unable to make any version of a Bloody Mary for me.  The waiter recommended their spicy margarita instead which just did not satisfy my taste for a spicy breakfast drink and was just an extremely average margarita.  I ordered the steak which came with pork fried rice and eggs.  DELICIOUS.  For dessert I had the assorted sorbet which came in green apple, passion fruit, and Pina colada - AWESOME.  My complaints are as follows: (1) I had the unfortunate view of the kitchen prep line where I saw a guy prepping the food to bring to the table without gloves.  That didn't freak me out so much as watching him eat the garnishes off the line with his fingers.  (2) There are 3 female bathroom stalls.  Annoying when they offer unlimited drinks. Even more annoying is that while standing in the line, the ladies and I came up with a system where whichever stall became available first, the first person in the line would enter that stall.  For some reason, some guy that worked at the restaurant did not like our system and told us we needed to form separate lines for the stalls. I don't know why he felt he needed to jump in and I'm not sure how he came up with such an inequitable system but it was so annoying.  (3) Our waiter was slow and somewhat forgetful.",1,0,0,Jasmine W.,"Silver Spring, MD",30,80,447

We started with & stuck to the White Sangria Havana Banana seems to be a favorite here it is very good nice taste great combo w the coconut & lychee served in a nice tall glass. Next the Punta Cana I must say for me this was the best one made with Mamajuana from the Dominican Republic it's certainly tasty & stronger. Tropical was also good not bad taste wise although after a few they start to taste the same easier to pick & stick w one for us it was Punta Cana. Main dish I had the Vaca Frita which is steak & eggs they add their own twist & add some rice, the rice was very good nice taste to it, good steak & eggs with some avocado as well good dish, very filling. My friend tried the Cachapa con Salmón, this is eggs, corn, avocado all piled high this was good but  nothing over the top. As for the restaurant nice size w plenty of seating, bar & seating area upfront, nice decor & good Latin music playing.Service was good, Brunch price is $29.95 which includes the unlimited Sangria good deal as long as u finish your glass u can get a refill.. no problem here for us.

Then we let the server know we had a birthday and we thought they would sing or something. To our surprise they brought out a domino cake of some sort and our friend thought it was okay but doesn't like coconut which was in it. When we got the bill we saw that the domino cake had been added when no one had even ordered it.

I called the restaurant on a Sunday to make a reservation for brunch. Since I know this place is very popular for brunch, I assumed that it would be a wasted effort, but it does not hurt to try. Someone answered the phone, I made my request, and was told that there were no openings. Ok. not a big deal. Like I mentioned earlier, I know this place is very popular. My BF then called the restaurants five minutes later and acquired a table. The only difference between our requests is that I asked for the table in English and he asked for it in Spanish. Oh wait, for my BF's request, the guy actually checked for tables (my request got a flat out ""there are none available"").

This level of service is totally unacceptable at a place that's charging $33 for each brunch entree.

For appetizers my bf ordered the calamari and I had the guacamole with plantain chips. The guacamole was fresh but I wish it was a little bit more acidic. We really did like the plantains chips and this appetizer is a good portion. My bf didn't like his calamari too much. He felt the sauce drenched in otherwise crispy fried calamari was left soggy and he didn't enjoy that texture. For our main dish I had the vegetariano and my bf had the paella. The portions of our dishes were humongous. Each dish was well suited for 2+ people. I liked my vegetarian dish. It came with wild rice, beans, squash, mushroom, and tomatoes sitting atop a huge half sized cauliflower. I liked the texture of the rice and the sauce and even enjoyed the mushrooms (normally not a big mushroom fan). But I found the size of the tomatoes to be too big and almost bothersome. It was strange to have smaller bite sized pieces of squash and mushrooms which were minute compared to the much larger tomato pieces. To me the amount of tomatoes along with the size of it made it hard for me to love this dish. I felt like I was fishing for mushrooms in a sea of tomatoes. I guess I just wish there were equal amounts of veggies all sized evenly. My bf liked his paella. His dish was plated wonderfully with half a lobster, some mussels, calamari, shrimp, chorizo, and chicken. He even enjoyed it the next day when we took our leftovers.

I began with the Punta Cana (which includes mamajuana - supposedly an aphrodisiac oOoOo), which was refreshing without being too sweet. The Latin Benedict, which at first appeared small, was delicious and the perfect portion size - the eggs were placed atop a bed of arepa which really elevated the dish. Some of my friends got the Ropa Vieja, which was extremely large and could have probably fed two per order.

2.0,12/2/2017,"The nice part about this place is the ambiance. They have a bar, two lounge areas, and a formal dining area. I was there with a friend and we sat in the lounge (you should make reservations for dining room seating). I suggest more dressy clothing. However, I was not impressed. I love Cuban food, my family is part Cuban, and the food did not make an impact on me. We ordered the empanada, leche de tigre (ceviche), and datiles (bacon-wrapped dates). We also received pan de yuca with a black bean dip. Pan de yuca was ok. Ceviche was ok but too small of a portion size. Empanada and datiles were subpar. The food was also overpriced. Service was not very quick or particularly friendly. If I came back, I would probably only come for drinks and to enjoy the ambiance, which is date worthy. Lounge space is big enough for larger groups as well (4+). Unlikely to come back.",0,0,0,Victoria T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",17,213,507

They even give you free bread, which is really delicious but make sure you don't fill up on it! The bottomless sangria is fun, as there are so many varieties to try.

5.0,11/25/2017,"Calle Ocho yet again did not disappoint! Calle Ocho (CO) and I have an extensive relationship.  Relationship in the sense that I've frequented this restaurant multiple times with family and friends prior to their move to The Excelsior Hotel.  For those that remember CO's prior space, it was vast. When entering, you were met with a long bar to the left of the entrance, segueing into a decent sized elevated lounge area and then on to an even larger dining room.  Their now current location, in contrast, has a much smaller bar, smaller lounge and an equally small dining area. But that's where the differences end. CO is still very popular with us brunching NYers, and with being housed in a hotel, also popular with the automatic trickle down of in-house hotel guests. Reservations are even more so required. Upon being seated, your server instantly provides a warm bread basket, which paves the way to a great meal. The combination of baked pastries and mini-muffins plus an inclusion of warm gooey Dulce de Leche filled 'donuts' if you will, were the mvp of the bread basket. The bread basket could of easily been served as an end to our meal as dessert.  I expressed my happiness about the 'donuts' and our waiter was kind enough to slip me a box full to go. Thank you Mr. Waiter Guy! CO's unlimited Sangria brunch is not the seller for me, as I am not a Sangria lover. The process of taking wine and mixing in a bunch of stuff doesn't appeal to me.Focusing on the food, my order of Latin Benedict had a unique touch. The benedict consisted of a base of a sweet arepa, a savory chorizo patty, sautéed spinach and perfectly poached eggs topped with hollandaise....muy bueno!  Anna, my brunch companion, had the Ropa Vieja which she also enjoyed.  Well deserved kudos to Calle Ocho for being able to preserve themselves longer than many establishments. Their move still carries their reputation of diligent service and good food.",38,20,33,Pat F.,"Bronx, NY",337,270,1954
4.0,11/22/2017,"Great brunch spot. We showed up on a Saturday as soon as they opened but with no reservation and were told they had no tables available. Thankfully we found seats at the bar. The atmosphere was fun. The music was good and loud, and everyone was dressed to impress. To start we got a basket of breads/muffins that were warm and delicious. We tried a few of their sangria's and they weren't watered down at all, also sitting at the bar means that the drinks come fast which we appreciated. For our entrees I ordered the gallitos and my husband ordered the pollo ranchero. Our meals came out very quickly and I was shocked by the size of my entrée. It was definitely enough to feed a couple of people. Everything had a lot of flavor  and we really enjoyed it. At $29.95 for an entrée and unlimited sangria, I thought the price was fair especially for NYC. We'll definitely be back, maybe to celebrate a birthday.

However...Cons: obviously unlimited alcohol does not mean all you can drink, but rather how many times you can flag down the waitress. She was not very attentive at all and she forgot my friend's drink order multiple times as well as agreed to bring bread refills but never actually brought them... Also they are really irresponsible. One of the wait staff spilled red sangria on my white jacket and all they said they could do was take my jacket to the dry cleaners and ship it to me a week later. Are you kidding?

4.0,11/17/2017,"Yelp/friend recommended-- reservation for my birthday boozy brunch made about a month in advance (highly recommend especially if you have a large party i had about 12 ppl). I also asked them if they start your 2hr time limit when you are seated or when your reservation was. Your time starts when you made your reservation whcih was at 12 but we left a bit after our time limit anyways so they werent that strict vs. what people said on yelp. Atmosphere was nice it was a chill spot and surprisingly not as noisy as i thought it would be since ive always been to pretty noisy and cramped boozy brunches before (mostly in LES though so that probably contributes to that issue) some of my friends were not as impressed by the decor especially since it is in a hotel but no big deal. It worked for me only thing was with our setup of a long table it was hard to talk with everyone. I could see myself coming back with a smaller party of like 4-6. Food depends on what you get i liked my dish which was the skirt steak, i also liked the roja dish which i think is the pulled meat? Those were definitely the most filling and appetizing in my opinion. Skirt steak was a decent size, came with eggs, rice and beans which in general i love. Some of my friends mentioned that the rice was too hard. The shrimp with grits was interesting a little mushy but my bf/friends enjoyed it. My cousin got the salmon benedict which was not as filling she said but tasted ok. Do NOT recommend the salmon my friend said it was too small, dry and ate about half and stopped. When i picked this place everything sounded super good but keep in mind the portions or look at pics! Drinks drinks drinks i am a white sangria kind of girl but their reds all sounded cool. Confirmed i like their white sangrias better though much fruitier. My friend warned me that these would be strong but they werent as strong as expected. Some of us had about 2-4 drinks which was sufficient. I read on yelp people had issues that if you looked done they would stop serving you drinks, that did not seem to be the case for us but it was difficult trying to get the waiters attention mutliple times to order more.

We went here the night of the NYC Marathon to celebrate and there was a pretty big group of people who ordered drinks and dinner. The bar didn't ask for my card or for me to pay right after I got my drinks -- seemed a bit disorganized because when we got the final tab for the last group to leave, they had added a pitcher of beer or sangria that no one in our section had ordered. I wasn't in charge of figuring out the bill, but I felt bad because we weren't sure what items were actually ours or another table's. I'll give them another chance in the future -- everyone seemed to enjoy their food and kept raving about the cheesey (?) bread.

When we walked in, you could see that it was really packed. We didn't have a reservation, but luckily they had an open spot for us at the bar. We sat down and you could just see how much sangrias they're making for everybody. They placed a small box of baked goods in front of you as a filler. They have this sort of pink butter? For it. I only like one of the bread as most of them were pretty sweet. I decided to try the Maiz y Camarones since it was really popular. I didn't think I would enjoy eating grits but the spices made it really flavorful some and the eggs were runny and added to it.

The one I will mention is the HAVANA BANANA Coconut Rum, Crème de Banana, Coconut, Lychees this just had so many unique sweet flavors they make it definitely worth getting. The drinks do stop once you stop ordering/eating food so make sure to order a desert for the table at the end ;) to keep them flowing.From a food standpoint I would recommend the Gallitos (serves two)Platter of Traditional Costa Rican Soft Tacos, Scrambled Eggs, Chorizo, lettuce, pico de gallo, avocado salad, Calle Ocho Home Fries. It was all delicious especially the chorizo and this gives you really everything from a food standpoint and solid portion for two people.

5.0,9/11/2017,Unlimited sangria as long you have food on your plate. Oh Jesus. This is too good to be true. The staff here were very friendly and were very attentive to us. Always filled our cups and made sure everything was to our liking. The food portion was great and I tried all the Sangrias and none of them let me down. If you can handle it I would recommend trying them all as well. The ambience was superb and very relaxed. Unquestionably date material. There really is no dress code here.

1.0,9/4/2017,Very disappointed with the service. We went to celebrate my friends bday and we were there for the brunch menu. They did not bring any bread to the table. Sangrias are nothing specials and super sugary. We had vaca frita and it wasn't what we were expecting. The steak was sautéed instead of fried and taste like it was reheated from few days before. Rice tasted old and salad tasted like it was made days in advanced (you know that funny taste tomatoes get after being in the fridge overnight). One of my friends ordered home fries and instead they brought us after asking for it twice yuca fries. 3rd time they corrected and brought what they called home fries or what in reality is steamed potatoes. In summary bland and sugary and old tasting food.

The pulpo appetizer was decent; not the best I've ever had. The service was very good, attentive waitstaff, didn't rush me and my friend with the check, which I appreciated. Cons: Ordered the ""surf and turf"" (lobster tail with sirloin steak). It wasn't very good. The lobster tail was quite small and the steak, which I ordered medium rare came overcooked and was tough, chewy, and quite tasteless. This place is good for their bottomless brunch margaritas, so if that's all you go for, then you'll be getting a fair deal.

It seems more in the cut and the space is much darker than the old location.  There is a bar when you walk in and then a large dining room in the back. The menu has a good amount of items to choose from- also pricey than it should be. The coolest thing about this spot is the selection of sangria flavors. It's also what I liked about the last location. The sangria here will get you feeling very nice with only one glass! Two or three and forget it lolThe food is good.

The butter/jams they serve with their biscuits/muffins was the best way to start off the meal - and they refilled it! Note to waitstaff: I always want more bread. Bring me the carbs! ATP, right?I got the Punta Cana Sangria to start - again, thanks to the waitstaff for asking right away because, priorities; and the Cachapa Con Salmon. My girls got the Ensalda De Langosta, the Latin Benedict, and the Calle Ocho Omelet. Everything was delicious and served hot! The pricing for entrees is pretty wonderful if you consider that sangria is UNLIMITED.

For the sangria, I tried the fresas and punta cana. The punta cana is a bit sweeter, and personally, I preferred the fresas. The alcohol is almost unnoticeable in both, but the drinks definitely pack a punch. I ordered the vaca frita, which could have used more flavor. On top of that, the steak was overcooked. It was fine for a few bites but I didn't feel the need to finish the dish or take it to go. The restaurant is incredibly loud; we basically had to shout across the table. Service was cold. I had really been looking forward to the complimentary bread basket, but when it arrived to our table, we only received the rolls and a single tiny chocolate croissant. I must say the rolls are delicious. I inquired about the muffins that I had seen in baskets at other tables, but according to our waiter, they were all out.

Mind you, the lounge area also becomes seats to enjoy your brunch -- so count out sitting in the restaurant to wait for a table. Once we sat, there was unlimited sangria until you finished eating. The sangria was the most enjoyable part of the visit by far. So many options and you can't go wrong with any of them. The salmon dish was delicious.

The entrées are reasonably priced with most things being under $30. However all entrées are served with complementary sangria and there are eight different kinds to choose from on their sangria bar selection and all entrées are also served with delicious Latin pastries and homemade butter. You will leave very full and satisfied. The shrimp and grits and Ropa Viejas are delicious. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is that sometimes I feel a little rushed when I go and that everything is served so fast that you don't get a chance to have a leisurely relaxing brunch.

I would assume to save money, but it's not right to do. You try a restaurant during this week to see if you like it enough to come back during a regular time. The things we had were just OK. The quinoa salad had odd tastes. The chicken appetizer was very, very runny and not great. The grilled chicken main was dry as anything, and came out looking like pieces of duck. I WISH it had been duck instead.The pork main dish actually had a very good taste - there's one star.The other star comes for the fact that you could FINALLY get something from the main menu - any dessert.

Second, they were not attentive to our table at all and the restaurant was not even that crowded at the time. Our water and sangria glasses were empty for a long, long time. Then, when one of my friends went up to a waiter and asked for a candle with a desert (was willing to pay for the desert), they said they don't do birthday events. I started to feel offended at this point because I knew that on yelp there were many people who said they celebrated their birthdays here.

The paella is the most amazing thing on the menu and is served with a large lobster tail on top! We also tried the ceviche tasting menu and got three or four different ceviches to try, all of which were fabulous! Not all of their desserts are Spanish inspired which I liked because it gave you another option for your last course. The desserts weren't the best I have ever had in New York but they were good and a nice why to end the evening.",0,0,0,Hannah R.,"Winston-Salem, NC",57,21,18

1.0,7/4/2017,I wanted to like the food. The place was nice and the staff very attentive. Me and my date both ordered the paelle since we love seafood but unfortunately for the both of us it came drenched in spicy mayo. We both hate mayo so needless to say how this ruined the enjoyment. I've never seen mayo on paelle so gross. The mayo should be a sauce on the side or they should warn people...

3.0,6/26/2017,"My friends and I came here to celebrate our friend's bachelorette party. The restaurant helped us put together a menu where we had 2-3 choices since we were a larger group as well as a unlimited drink option.I ordered the arepa appetizer but did not realize that there was meat on the dish (the other app choice was a seafood based dish). When it came, I told the server my situation and she was very happy to accommodate me. They offered a plain arepa or a salad and I chose the arepa. They quickly brought out an arepa with guacamole on top and the red peppers that came with the original arepa dish. It was pretty good. The arepa was a bit mushy and soggy and kind of stuck to your teeth because of the texture but the flavor was good of the whole dish.For my entree, I got the vegetarian option which was quinoa wrapped in some sort of a leaf. It was really awful. The whole dish smelled like I was eating a tree and the leaf was thick and tough and impossible to chew. I felt like a cow chewing cud for 10 minutes straight trying to get to down. The quinoa had a weird flavor to it. I'm not even sure what the spice was but it just wasn't good. I think I ate about 3 bites of the whole thing. My friends thought the salmon choice was okay but the chicken was dry and flavorless. The dessert choices were alright. Nothing special but not great. Overall, I was very underwhelmed by this. I don't know if the rest of the choices on the regular menu is better but this just wasn't very good. The service was impeccable.

3.0,6/21/2017,I have heard a lot about this place as a go to spot. Calle Ocho was not all i thought it would be to be honest. Service was great but food was not good in my opinion. Sangria was ok ive had better but i guess thats the price you pay. After we finished paying we continued to get sangria might be because we left such a great tip. It can get extremely crowded so  i would recommend a reservation although i did see that reservations are booked for at least a month in advanced. what my friends and i did was go a couple of minutes before the opening time which by then there was already a small line to sit by the entrance to sit by the bar for those without a reservation. I would come again for the service and the complementary food they give during brunch while you wait for your food. price is a big factor being that it is inexpensive.,1,0,0,Esmeralda D.,"New York, NY",87,102,52
4.0,6/16/2017,"I went to this restaurant on a friday night. Because i went there pretty early, there was no line.We ordered the paella and chicherron (fried rock shrimp) and both were amazing. Chicnerron was a starter menu but the portion was big enough. It was very crispy outside and this sweet sauce on top made a great harmony with the fried shrimp. The seafood paella was very fresh. I liked how different kinds of seafood, including lobster,  was used for this menu. We could not finish the paella and had to take left over back home since its portion was pretty big. Also, I loved their complimentary bread. It was very chewy and went along well with the spread. I enjoyed these bread too much in the beginning and thats probably why I could not finish the main dish..Overall, I would definitely go back to this restaurant and I will make sure to visit on a weekday so I can also get a glass of free sangria!",5,2,3,Catherine K.,"New York, NY",183,91,277

3.0,6/12/2017,"First time having dinner here. I got the paella because I saw that it was mentioned a ton in previous reviews. While the plating for the paella was beautiful with a large lobster on top of the entire dish, the actual paella itself was just average. The seafood items in it were slightly bland, and the rice was not well seasoned. Seemed like a disappointment for $33. The sangria was good. I got the Spanish Harlem sangria and it was as good as sangria can get. I liked the subtle cinnamon taste in it. Just so you know before you go - the check in deal for the sangria is only valid on weekdays excluding Friday. Service was pretty slow. The server disappeared for almost half an hour before taking our order. I think it was just one guy working almost half the restaurant. I would come here again because the atmosphere is cool - inside a hotel, dim lighting, pretty decor, and the menu items look amazing. I'm hoping it was just an off night because I've heard great things about this spot.",1,0,0,Sophia P.,"New York, NY",538,239,75
4.0,6/11/2017,"On one hand, it doesn't really matter what the food at Calle Ocho is like. You'll be unconcernedly drifting out of the hotel it's located in after a few (or more than a few) sangrias, regardless of what else you just consumed. But on the other hand, stuff here was pretty tasty, and well worth whatever hassle you undertake in order to enjoy your meal.My friend made a reservation here about a month ago, so if lines aren't your thing, make sure you plan ahead. We got in at 2:30 on a Sunday, just before the end of brunch service (more on that below). Three of us got the vaca frita (steak and eggs), while the other got the torta, but the hard part of the menu was figuring out our sangria orders. I started with the Tropical, but our reservationist/Calle Ocho veteran lives by the Havana Banana.We were instructed (by our friend, not the restaurant) to eat as slowly as possible, since they'll cut you off from sangria if they determine you've finished your meal. It was surprisingly hard to do; my steak was tasty, generous, and accompanied by solid pico de gallo and rice on the side (not to mention the two over easy eggs). We paced ourselved admirably, but perhaps for naught, since apparently the kitchen closes at around 4 and with it goes the sangria service. Honestly I feel like it's dumb that Calle Ocho would create such a late reservation slot given this, but them's the breaks. Fortunately our waiter must have seen our tipsy disappointment and brought us out one last round of Rojo sangria. Mission accomplished.Overall, we had a very pleasant experience at Calle Ocho. We never felt rushed, and the food and drinks were very solid. Considering the reasonable brunch prices here, I'd definitely return in the future!",2,3,3,Brennan L.,"East Bay, CA",401,260,169

4.0,6/8/2017,"One of the perks of being in my profession is that I get the opportunity to attend educational dinners - last night's talk found me at Calle Ocho. Usually I'm indifferent when it comes to the location of these things but one of my colleagues said the food was really good here, so I was excited to try it out.Located in the Excelsior Hotel, the restaurant is fairly large for a Manhattan eatery; the entrance is to the right of the main lobby on the ground floor of the hotel. Upon entry you're immediately greeted with the bar, then back further are tables, followed by even more tables, then finally a private room where we were seated. The color scheme was mostly reds and oranges, with Latin American touches throughout. While the menu was fixed (common at these types of dinners), I was pleasantly surprised to see not only did I have a choice of three apps, entrees, and desserts, BUT that all the choices were full menu items - wow! We also had access to all the Sangrias they offer - amaze, really. Anyway, we were started with this Brazilian cheese bread. I've had it once before when I was in Epcot for Food and Wine - it was warm, cheesy, and delicious; it came with this black bean spread which complemented it well. For my app I chose the shrimp. They came glazed, sitting in a large onion ring over avocado salad. While all the food was good, this was honestly my favorite component of the meal - very innovative and full of flavor. For my main I went with the chicken - chock full of chicken actually - a chicken breast, leg, and empanada served over mashed blue potatoes with a tasty sauce. It was a little all over the place but tasted super fresh. For my dessert I went with the vanilla flan which was super creamy and refreshing. Service was good, and overall for an educational dinner they really came through - probably one of the best I've been to. My Yelp friends seem to say this is a good place for brunch, and after last night's experience I would definitely return to explore it.",9,4,7,Jason M.,"Bronx, NY",474,719,3173
5.0,6/6/2017,There are few times when I've gone to a restaurant and their free complementary bread got my feeling some type of way. To be honest it's never happened till Calle Ocho. They use Yukka as the main ingredient and it's simply amazing. The dip was a sweet garlicky black bean paste. My gf got the salmon entree and I tried the viva steak one mentioned in pictures. (Forgot the name). Salmon and steak were both perfectly cooked. The portion is large enough that I actually didn't finish the rice that came with.

4.0,5/29/2017,"Give me a basket of their complimentary cheese bread, and I will be sufficiently happy. They are seriously addictive, with a soft but dense and buttery interior and a slightly hard and brown exterior. The three of us shared the Hondureno, empanada, and paella. We thought it was enough food, but le bf and I did just come from a food festival, so I would probably order another dish for a party of three next time.The Hondureno ceviche was beautifully presented. The pickled ahi tuna and jalapenos were served in a whole coconut and topped with crispy plantains and crispy coconut. It was a refreshing way to whet your appetite. The empanada also gets brownie points for its presentation. The golden brown exterior contrasted well with the yummy and soft filling inside, with fava beans and queso blanco. The paella was good as well, filled with lobster, mussels, clams, shrimp and chorizo. I couldn't taste the chicken, but was happy enough with the rice that was infused with wonderful flavors and aromas from the seafood and tomato salad. The ambiance is chic and festive. I felt like I was at a resort restaurant!I can't give higher than 4 stars, however, as I think the two $$ signs are misleading. The appetizers are an average $15-$20 and entrees are all over $30.

We felt comfortable discussing the menu with him and he recommended a few options which turned out to be great choices. Everything from the appetizers to the main course to dessert was so good. Note that the sangria sneaks up on you (I only had one glass). Oh, and the coffee. How can you go wrong with Cuban coffee? I think I liked the coffee more than the sangria.

Calle Ocho, a restaurant on the ground floor of the Excelsior hotel, is now one of my favorite restaurants in all of NYC.My friend and I walked in (feeling a bit underdressed, since we just spent the day doing brunch and then at the Met and came here on a whim) and immediately were asked if we had reservations. But even though we didn't (on a Sunday night), we were seated right away. It was pretty packed, and based on other reviews saying you should make a reservation, we got lucky.They put bread rolls and beans on the table and I knew right away the food was going to be amazing. So I didn't feel bad about the prices of the meals. The bread was cheesy and the beans were smooth, and because we waited REALLY long for our food, they refilled it a couple of times. The service was amazing and someone was always checking up on us to update us about our food or ask if we needed refills on the water or starter.I got the braised pork rib and my friend got vaca frita. Both were delicious. The meat was tender and juicy, and for me fell right off the bone. We were a bit full from all the bread and ended up really hangry by the time we got our food, but it was still worth it I can't wait to come back here.The ambiance at night is really dark and romantic, with candles and everything.

The food was overpriced and not good. The drinks were great, on the bright side. The worst part was the service. Our server, JP, was incredibly rude midway toward the end of our visit, even though we weren't done eating. He kept coming at 5 minute interval, clearly in an effort to be rid of us. Ultimately, when we requested our last drink and he said he'd be right out with them, he did not bring it but instead the check, which we had not requested. We of course complied and paid our bill, expecting the drink. After signing the bill, he said that it was too late to have the sangria and that we'd need to drink it outside if we really wanted it, even tho that's against the rules and also illegal. Having already paid, we chalked it up to the game but most certainly will not be back or recommend this spot to anyone, as it is overrated.",0,0,0,Isha F.,"Civic Center, Manhattan, NY",0,3,0
4.0,4/28/2017,"My friend and I were visiting the area for a show at the Hayden Planetarium and found this restaurant online under a 'top ten restaurants in the Upper West Side' blog post. After looking at the food and reviews on Yelp, my mouth was seriously watering on the train ride to the city.Being from New Jersey, most restaurants open around 11am and generally stay open until closing. That's not exactly the same in the city. Upon reaching the restaurant at around 4:30, we realized they did not open until 5:30 for drinks and 6:00 for dining. The show started at 7, so we wouldn't have had enough time to eat and get to the planetarium. I guess that's just city life, completely my fault for not checking. So my friend and I went to another restaurant for dinner. After dining at another restaurant, we stopped back at Calle Ocho for happy hour because we at least wanted to try the sangria everyone was raving about. It definitely did not disappoint. We had the Punta Cana sangria which is made with white wine and tons of tropical fruits. The service was really great and the atmosphere is very cozy and intimate. I definitely want to go back for dinner!",2,0,0,Victoria T.,"Willingboro, NJ",125,84,58
5.0,4/24/2017,"Have you been here for brunch? Probably not, because getting a reservation the week of can be tough, and waits are generally long due to the AWESOME brunch deal that exists. Buy any entrée and enjoy unlimited (that's right - actually unlimited) sangria of any kind (and you can switch back and forth) for up to two solid hours. Try the Latin Benedict and Huevos Rancheros.About a month in advance, we booked a large group brunch (12 people) and spent $30 each, with the check split evenly, including tax & tip. I highly recommend coming hungry and sober - there is enough food, including a basket of complimentary muffins, to go around. Stay the full two hours to get your fill.Read the rules on the inside flap of the menu though, and don't get too rowdy. If one member of your party gets cut off, they get asked to leave and the rest of your party must follow. So tell Janet to pace herself when you see her double-fisting.

Then, you choose from their sangria list for your unlimited sangria with any brunch entree. They have a selection of 4 each for white and red. Sangria was good, not too heavy or light.

4.0,3/29/2017,"My gut gives this place a solid 3.5, and I'll round up for the friendly and attentive service (and the bread). To set the framework for the night, I came here with a $75 Groupon that included 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts. For additional good measure, I ended up there early and checked in on yelp to happily discover your yelp check in gets you a free glass of sangria!Shortly after being seated, we were greeted by a box of some highly addictive warm bread balls that I assume are filled with lots of butter, cheese, me accompanied with a black bean spread. It's awesome, and you will end up asking for a second box. Bread aside, the rest of the meal...Red snapper ceviche - for a ceviche, the is an insanely large portion, though a lot of that is the papaya. This has more of a sweet tropical feel than one of a spicy, acidic ceviche. It's good, but I would likely try a different one next time. Grilled Octopus - masterfully tender octopus, but probably the only small portion of the night. Short Ribs - two really big hunks of short ribs, which were a little bit on the dry side, which is surprising considering how forgiving of a meat short ribs are. The tart with mushrooms, lobster, spinach, and onions were super flavorful, but the tart itself was a bit hard and did not want to be cut easily. The portion is big enough to expect leftovers. Skirt Streak Special - this was a special for the night, served with a red chimichurri sauce. The wife enjoyed it, but the steak could have been a bit more tender. Flan - solid rendition of the classic. Tres Leches Cake - this was a towering piled of sweet soaked sponge cake. The cake itself is delicious, but does have some pineapple layered in there, which slightly overpowered the cake. Still really good though. Almost all items (Octopus aside), the portions were really, really large. Between the large portions and the bread, I can't imagine it's possible to leave here hungry. In general, the dishes were good, but not exceptional. Service was friendly and attentive, and drinks were good. Do I plan on coming back? Not at full price, no, but if I can snag another Groupon, perhaps.",4,0,2,Dave F.,"Hoboken, NJ",429,633,1392

5.0,3/27/2017,"In the past, I've only been to Calle Ocho for their amazing brunch.  However, after coming across a groupon deal for a three course meal dinner for two for $75, i decided to give their dinner a try.  I must say that this is the most value I've ever received from a groupon.  First off the service was excellent.  We were constantly attended to by either the wait staff, host, or the manager and our water glasses were always full.  Now for the food...Shortly after being seated, our server brought bread to the table.  The bread was warm and absolutely delicious.  The rolls tasted similar to the cheese rolls you get at a Brazilian steakhouse but was served with a side of black bean dip, which was great.  For the appetizers, we ordered the chicharron (rock shrimp) and the calamari.  Both appetizers were really great and the portion size was huge.  We had to take most of the appetizers to go because it was so much that if we ate most of it, we wouldn't have been able to eat our meal.  The calamari was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  The sauce  it was in had Asian flavors to me.  The chicharron was also tasty.  For the entrees, I had the salmon with lobster mashed potatoes and my girlfriend ordered the steak with goat cheese mashed potatoes with jumbo shrimp.  The steak was actually the special for the night and came at no extra cost if you were using a groupon.  My salmon dish was fantastic.  The potatoes had really large pieces of lobster and the salmon was seasoned well.  My girlfriend also enjoyed her steak and ate the entire meal, which is rare for her.  For dessert, we had the tres leches cake and the crepes.  The tres leches cake was pretty good and the crepes were a little thick and I probably wouldn't order those again.  Also, we both had a glass of Spanish Harlem sangria with our meal, which was great as always.  Calle Ocho has always been a solid brunch option (when you can get a table) but now it is definitely a solid dinner option as well!",1,0,0,Dewett W.,"Bronx, NY",5,5,2

It's one of those few spots in New York with enough space for many large groups of people. To be honest, I was shocked that Calle Ocho was as large as it was.One of the best parts of brunch is that with every plate, you get unlimited and complimentary sangria. They have a list of 8+ sangrias (both white and red) to choose from. I definitely had about 3 during my meal. The Havana Banana white sangria is the best in my opinion because it is not too sweet and very light. Love the added lychee flavor.They also serve complimentary bread with a light pink buttery spread (strawberry, I assume?). The bread is fantastic!! Croissant filled with chocolate, sweet corn bread and other bread rolls.I wasn't a huge fan of the food though. My brunch entree was the Salmon Cachapa.

The restaurant charged our group of 14 people, $71 per person and only sent out about 9 dishes to be shared between all of us. We def was ripped off as far as what we paid for and what we received. Management offered to send 3 more dishes and said he would not charge us but what he failed to realize was that he was only giving us what we paid for.

I knew from before that it can be super difficult to get reservations here, so when a friend of mine couldn't use hers we said why not? We waited about ten or fifteen minutes to be seated as it was busy when we arrived. The restaurant is pretty large and definitely has a bit of a party vibe to it around brunch time. Once we got to the table, we immediately settled on our sangria choices - the Havana Banana for me and the Samba for my boyfriend. He ended up getting the pollo ranchero, while I got the vaca frita. I was happy with my choice, but my boyfriend was a little disappointed by the pollo ranchero after trying my food. Maybe it was just that we were pretty hungry when we arrived, but the dishes weren't as large as I would've liked, especially given that we were going to be drinking a lot of sangria. We also never got the bread bowl that a lot of other reviews mention. We sampled most of the flavors, and my favorite was the Tropical. Overall, I would say the whites were definitely better; the reds mostly tasted the same and didn't have a lot of the fruit flavors.Calle Ocho was alright but a little expensive given the quality and quantity of the food (and the quality of the sangria). If you're looking for a Latin bottomless brunch, I would recommend Boqueria instead, which is a little more expensive but infinitely more satisfying.",0,0,0,Tori R.,"Ann Arbor, MI",5,4,9
5.0,2/22/2017,"Bottomless Brunch!! The whole concept has become an endangered species in NY. I always hear about the good ol' days of a very boozy bottomless brunch. There are still some around but the food is normally subpar and the drinks are really moving like molasses and for a huge price tag.Calle Ocho, a Cuban influenced restaurant  has the reputation of being that ol' school delicious concept with tons of drinks at an astonishing low price. So when my cousins said they wanted to brunch with my brother and I, it was the first place I thought of. I warn you to read ALL THE RULES before coming. They are posted online. The entrance is through a hotel!! Past the lobby and to the right. When I came in I noticed a giant platter with little dividers and a center of tortillas being served, called ""Gallitos"". I knew that's what I wanted. Lucky for me it was for two people and my brother let me order for the two of us. As we waited for out other cousin to come, we received hot coffee and cream and a little platter piled high with little rolls, muffins and one chocolate croissant. I devoured the croissant and I guess it's remnants were left on my chin. My brother at least helped me out and mentioned the fact. This is surprising. My brother that is, not the fact that I'm covered in food clues.We all ordered the refreshing ""Punta Cana"" sangria!! They were so tasty and a great break from my usual beer. Made with Mamajuana, peach, pineapple and oranges. Mamajuana is a concoction of rum, red wine, honey, tree bark and herbs and comes from the Dominican Republic. Rumored to be an aphrodisiac and this girl can see why!?! But seriously this was my first time having it and it was perfect in this summery sangria.The food was spectacular! We ate every morsel. My brother and I shared the platter and it came with eggs, jazzed up potatoes, lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, chorizo and what tasted like homemade tortillas. I tried the ""Fresas"" for my second drink. It was delicious but a little heavy for brunch. I returned to the ""Punta Cana"". I will say they had to use our same glasses so we had to drink up before we could drink again. This I admit was strange. The place is huge so I guess they might not have had enough glassware to accommodate all these brunch booze hounds. We had no room for dessert which I know was probably delicious. Next time.Thanks to our lovely waitress Emma (I hope that your name, that's what the receipt said). She graciously took care of us during the madness of brunch and our sangria needs. It's like she deserves a medal for the runs back and forth to the bar! Until next time Calle Ocho! Thank you for my food coma and fun start to my day.

4.0,2/19/2017,"BRUNCH REVIEW: Calle ocho is fun, but try to book a couple months in advance (especially if you go with a group of 8 like I did)! Dishes cost between $21 to $28, but keep in mind that that includes unlimited refills of their 8 different flavors of Sangria, so this is actually a pretty good deal compared to other Manhattan brunch spots where bottomless brunch is $30 to $40! You may want to call and ask though before going if they have a kid's menu/discount for kids, as the drink price is built into the dishes so the place would definitely be overpriced if you had people with you who don't drink. The time limit is 2 hours, which is much better than the 1-1.5 hours elsewhere.  We were all delighted by the awesome bread basket that came out to start, which included strawberry butter, some interesting breads, and one chocolate croissant. They were happy to bring out another basket when we were full, however I think they might have done better to have more of the best breads, i.e. the chocolate croissant, in the basket, as only two of us got to enjoy them. But all the breads were good so this wasn't a big deal.The Sangrias were good, but there weren't any I felt extraordinary passionate about. The White Sangria Havana Banana was the most unique, though it  really tasted like lychees, and the Samba tastes like basic Sangria, even though it is supposed to be blueberry flavored. Psychologically, bottomless brunch doesn't feel that bottomless, as the cups are about 20 ounces, so I and another female only got through 2 of them-- the tallest guy at the table did make it to 5 though. I still left feeling a nice buzz, though I am not convinced the drinks were that alcoholic, I had to drink 40 ounces of liquid to get there! They were fairly quick to bring you another glass when you finished. I wasn't that impressed by the food, though the drinks made that of secondary concern. I had the Vaca Fritas, which came with skirt steak, pork fried rice, avocado, and fried eggs. The menu doesn't mention, but it does come with some lovely marinated tomatoes and onions too!. The tomatoes and onions were the best part, followed by the avocado and eggs-- the pork fried rice wasn't very exciting, and the skirt steak was too well done/chewy. I had a bite of my friend's Calle Ocho Omelet, and it was delicious, but that was really because the entire thing was goat cheese; i don't think i could have eaten the whole thing of it, much like i doubt i could just eat a straight log of goat cheese in one sitting.",0,0,0,Emily B.,"Chicago, IL",245,41,3

I would've been happy just eating these for dinner. 2) Appetizier - Chivita - Fresh and clean flavor profile. A good salad to start the meal. Too much goat cheese for my taste but that can obviously pick them out. 3) Ceviches - Pulpo - Loved it! Fresh and flavorful. Just order it! 4)Ceviches - Langosta - Good but didn't pop for me. The Thai chili mojo was yum but i didn't think the dish goes together. 5)Pato - The duck was cooked perfectly. But we weren't a big fan of the lentil salad. The orange sauce didn't stand out. 6)Paella - Great flavor. The freshness of the seafood was captured in the rice. A Must!7) Mar y Tierra - My favorite entree of the night! Steak was cooked perfectly to a medium rare. Melts in the mouth and super flavorful. The place is busy and loud especially around dinner time. So I had to speak loudly even at our own table. So if you're expecting a intimate/soft spoken conversation, go early before the dinner rush.

4.0,2/16/2017,"I've been here for brunch a couple of times (whoo free sangria!), but recently went in for a 3-course Groupon dinner with my boyfriend.  If you check in on Yelp you can redeem a free glass of sangria - they have about 8 kinds to choose from (half red / half white). My favorite type of sangria is the Punta Cana, which is super tropical and fruity (peach / pineapple / orange).  I tried a couple sips of the Samba, which is also recommendable (acai liquor / brandy / blueberries). Appetizers: They bring out slightly sweet bread balls with a black bean spread, which are delicious and a great way to kick off the meal.  Pulpo a la Plancha (octopus):  great texture and flavor, enjoyed the chorizo crumbles and the bean/garlic puree. Because it's octopus, it's not a huge portion. Dulce (sweet corn empanada with chevre and tomatoes): Awesome flavor, and a liberal amount of cheese, always a good thing.  Main Courses:  Lubina (sea bass):  Comes out with the tail on for presentation, but you don't have to do any work (the bones have been removed).  Served on a bed of spinach, bell peppers, onions, potatoes (it says fingerling potatoes but they seemed to be full-sized and cut thinly), and fennel.  Really good fish flavor, and everything complemented the meat well. Red Snapper:  my boyfriend ordered this and semi enjoyed it.  Served on a bed of quinoa, it has a rather fruity / tropical flavor, and the fish itself absorbed a lot of lemon flavor (too much in his opinion).  It came with a couple of shrimp, which I don't think he was expecting (may have been his fault in reading the menu). Vaca Frita: I've had this for brunch before and it's great: skirt steak, egg, avocado, and spicy rice. Yummy, filing, and pairs well with the booze.  Desserts: Domino: The chocolate cake is ok but that Dulce de Leche ice cream - fabulous!!Ice Cream Sampler: vanilla / chocolate / coffee.  The coffee ice cream is the strongest I've ever had, in a good way. Super hearty kick of espresso in there. The vanilla ice cream here goes well with the chocolate cake from the Domino. This place can get pretty crazy for brunch, but didn't seem that crowded around dinner time (8:00 pm).  That being said, it took a while before we were presented with the opportunity to order (20+ minutes).",2,0,0,Sarah B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",202,138,297

And some of the entrees weren't even what we ordered. For instance, we were suppose to get chicken stuffed w/ plantain with Sausage and potatoes. They brought over crispy chicken and potatoes.

1.0,2/12/2017,"To say that this place will never get my business again is an understatement.  I organized a  dinner at this location weeks ago for a group of 13. I went over the menu, the serving options etc, settled on a price, got the deposit taken care of.  Along the way, I followed up to keep them abreast of everything.  I arrived on time, announced I was there while my guests trickled in.  After a snow storm in NYC, driving and parking is a bit tricky but still we all got settle in a few minutes after our 7pm start time. From the VERY BEGINNING the service was shitty!  I had personalized menus that should have been on our table before we sat down, but instead they were shoved on the table in a hurried manner as we were getting seated.  All fine.  After about 20mins, the waiter came by again, ready to ""take our orders"" and then proceeded to get angry when I stated that we were supposed to have family style dishes prepared for us.  This prompted me to get out of my seat and find a manager.  You would think that any restaurant would know ""family style"" means  large plates so everyone can pass around the table.  Instead we got 4 plates of items to share - e.g: 4 INDIVIDUAL bowls of shrimp dish, 5 INDIVIDUAL plates of beef dish etc.  So essentially, we paid for 13 and got servings for FOUR or FIVE. We had to pass these little baby plates of food around.  Now our tables are completely CLUTTERED with dishes etc. and they just kept placing the plates on the tables with ZERO CARE in the world.  Being a professional woman, in a group filled with professional women - lawyers, managers, accountants etc - we kept our cool, and tried not to let the early shit show ruin our evening.  Eventually it became hard to ignore when we received 3 plates of chicken and potatoes (JUST CHICKEN AND POTATOES), INSTEAD of the Plantain Stuffed Chicken Breast with Chicken Sausage and Potatoes.  See the difference?!?!?! When I asked where is the stuffing and everything else, I was told - by our very HORRIBLE WAITER - that the chicken was ""marinated in plantain sauce"" - WTF?!?!?!?!  I HAVE NOT ONE BUT TWO GRADUATE DEGREES, I know what ""stuffed chicken is""!!!!! At this point, I asked for the manager to be sent over to our table, and proceeded to explain the horrors of the night.  His response was ""I will talk to the chef to have the dish prepared the right way"".  What do they do?  They send back out the SAME CHICKEN, hard as a rock, but they now placed it rather nicely on top of the potatoes - still sans the plantain stuffing, still sans the chicken sausage!!!Did I mention while wiping down the table, another waiter spilled water on my friend's phone and acted like he didn't see it?  When we called him back to wipe it, he still didn't offer an apology?!?!?!?  Did I mention that when my guest inquired if her drink was correct that she was rudely brushed off by the waiter like she wasn't asking him a question?At the end of the night, their compensation was taking the drinks off the bill, and even then they still left two drinks on there because they ""weren't sangrias"", and they STILL tried to tag on the 20% tip.  At this point, after my night took a turn for the left, I decided that I was just going to sign the bill and leave, with every intention of following up with my credit card company.  Did I mention that as the organizer of this entire dinner all I had to eat was some of the appetizer - out of a THREE COURSE sitting?  Ask me why!Calle Ocho Management - THIS WAS A SHITTY NIGHT.  I picked this place after coming to your location and falling in love with your food.  If I had planned this night last minute, or made a million changes to our original contract, I would have almost understood this, but all I did was change the number of people, and I reconfirmed everything 48hrs in advance.  We settled everything WEEKS ago!  Your waiter was SHITTY and doesn't deserve a penny of gratuity, and I will make sure of that.  Your ""manager"", although he tried, he clearly didn't do anything to deal with the attitude we were given from this waiter.  If we were a bunch of foul mouthed hooligans behaving in a certain manner, I could understand your waiter behaving the way he did but we were NOT.  We were all impeccably dressed, we were all respectful and maintained that respect even when your employees deserved to get much less.   I guess good service only works if you are of a certain ethnic group.  NEVER AGAIN!",1,0,0,Kay P.,"New York, NY",0,2,0
1.0,2/12/2017,"My friends and I went to Calle Ocho as a pre-valentines dinner.  It was about 13 of us thus because our group was so large we had to do family style dining.  Myself, personally I am not a fan of family style dining because majority rules however I have come here for brunch with a smaller group of friends and I had a great experience, the food was great and the service so I was open.....however this was not the case with our dinner last night.  My friend who organized everything is extremely detailed and thorough when it comes to planning.  She informed our group of the various options and costs.  We all selected the dinner option we wanted and prepaid her for the dinner, my friend signed a contract and used her credit card to secure the booking as I mention previously my friend is EXTREMELY detailed so this was all completed a month prior.  I arrived late so my friends were seated but the choices that we selected were not what we recieved for example we were supposed to receive chicken stuffed plantain and what we got was chicken and potatoes.  When we questioned this we was told that the chicken was ""marinated in plantain sauce"" which was not stated on the menu we questioned the staff and they were extremely rude to us.  Then the waiter said I will bring you some plantains on the side like this was supposed to compensate.  When my friend who organized the dinner stated the cost for chicken and  potatoes vs plantain stuffed chicken are two different prices they seemed ""not to understand us"" plus the other 2 entrees arrived cold which also added to our displeasure.  We requested to speak to the manager who came over and listened to our concerns he resent us the same exact dish chicken and potatoes which was supposed to be plantain stuffed chicken and it was not.  He also allowed us to order additional dishes from the menu and a round of drinks which were comped. So I will say that he did make an effort to correct the error however when the bill came my friend was upset because we were charged for things that we were not supposed to.  Ultimately the entire bill was comped and we did not have to pay anything. While the Manager tried to be accommodating I will say the service staff treated us horribly, I hate to say this but there is a different level of service given to white patrons as opposed to black patrons which is upsetting.  We are 13 professional women dressed impeccably (we were not in jeans and belly shirts, we were not loud and ghetto compared to the White patrons who some looked like they just rolled out of bed) who were looking to have a great dining experience and this is just what we did not have.  The service staff was very arrogant and talked to us in a demeaning way, me personally I lost my appetite because of the treatment we had and ate about 3 bites of food.  Calle Ocho treat all of your patrons with the same level of service, please give your staff more hospitality training so can properly interact with all customers appropriately.  My money is green like everyone else's and I expect a certain level of service when I go out to eat and this expectation was not met last night at Calle Ocho.  When I arrived home I was starving and made myself a turkey sandwich something that I should not have done considering I prepaid for a 3 course meal and did not enjoy it.",2,0,0,Iona K.,"New York, NY",33,16,4

The Gallitos were the appetizer we got and easily the best thing we had. I got the Pollo Peruano which looked amazing as far as presentation but was only decent in taste. My date got the Vaca frita al Caballo which she said was ok. As far as drinks I usually love caipirinhas but this one was a let down. The sangria was better though.The service was exemplary as staff was attentive but not overbearing. I would give the service as well as the overall environment a 5 with a nice vibe and ambiance.

Music is kept at a nice volume and allows for a conversation to be held without screaming.  We went on a Tuesday night so it wasn't packed. The service was very attentive without being annoying. We got the three course $75 Groupon and it was worth it! For appetizer we had the Gallittos which was our favorite item of the night...it was plentiful and tasty. I got the Vaca frita. It was just okay to me, I felt it could of been spicier/flavorful but it was cooked well. My date had the plantain stuffed chicken and he thought it was average. Dessert was good, I had Tres leches cake and he had the sorbet. For drinks we had Sangria via yelp check-in;-).. I loved the classic red, it wasn't too sweet.

The complimentary rolls with the black bean dip were mouthwatering. We could have filled ourselves up with just those! For our choice of 2 appetizers, we chose the Chicarrones (Crispy Shrimp in a sweet & spicy sauce with pickled onions & cole slaw) & Grilled Octopus with a white bean saffron aioli. Both were excellent. For our main courses, Steve had the Pato (Duck) served over lentils, which he exclaimed was the best he ever had - it was that tender & flavorful. I had the Paella, which was better than the one I recently had in Spain. It was abundant  with Lobster, shrimp, calimari, & chorizo served over yellow rice. Lastly, we both shared 2 desserts: Tres Leches (pound cake infused with coconut & pineapple) & Flan. All in all, a great meal from start to finish.

4.0,12/23/2016,"My BF brought a groupon deal for Calle Ocho, $75 for a 3 course meals for two. Also, if you check in on yelp you get a free glass of Sangria (red or white). My bf got the red and I got the white. I highly recommend getting the red ! The red was sweet and fruity but not overly sweet. But if you like your sangrias strong then I would recommend getting the white. For appetizers we ordered Gallitos for two (Platter of Traditional Costa Rican Soft Tacos with grilled beef, Salsa Verde Shrimp & Chipotle Chicken). Definitely serves more than two. I would say it can probably serve about 3-4 ppl. Half way into our appetizers we were getting full.For entrees, my bf ordered Vaca Frita al Caballo (Cuban skirt steak, latin pork fried rice, fried egg and avocado) and I ordered the Paella (Lobster, mussels, clams, shrimp, chorizo, chicken, valencia rice, tomato-calamari salad). The Paella was good but didn't WOW me and the rice was a bit oily. The Vaca Frita Al Caballo came with a HUGE portion of rice and 2 long pieces of skirt steak. The latin pork fried rice was surprisingly good and the steak was just mediocre. A touch of more seasonal would've helped. We literally took a few bites of the entrees and ended up taking both the appetizer and entree to go. For Desserts we ordered Tres Leches (Traditional pound cake soaked in 3 milks, filled with pineapple and coconut and pineapple coulis) and Caramelo (Traditional Vanilla Flan in mango sauce). Both desserts weren't bad nor good. It was just ok.   Overall, with the groupon deal it was definitely worth the price. Their portions are perfect for family style.

The seafood paella I originally planned to get wasn't available so I got Vaca Frita ($24) which is Cuban skirt steak, Latin fried pork rice, avocado, and fried eggs. Two things that I didn't know - they give you complementary sangria during the course of your meal and the bread bowl with strawberry butter as appetizer for free!!! After hearing that tropical is the most popular sangria, I chose it which was the best sangria I ever had. The bread bowl with strawberry butter was also delicious.

They were nice enough to bring extra tacos when they saw were running low.I had the skirt steak which honestly is probably the best skirt steak I've ever had. It was super super tender and perfectly seasoned - I was truly impressed. Some people at the table got the sirloin steak and they, too, raved about the tastiness of their steak. I definitely recommend the skirt steak, though!For dessert, I told the waiter that we were celebrating a birthday when I ordered a flan. He was nice enough to bring a dessert on the house. It was the chocolate/brownie domino with ice cream dessert. Both that and the flan were reaally really good.  This is definitely a nice venue for a birthday or upscale dinner.

What an absolute blast this place is, I can't wait to go back here! Our entire experience was very pleasant start to finish. Make sure to make a reservation well in advance given the popularity of Calle Ocho, we booked two weeks in advance for a Sunday brunch. We had one of the earliest reservations, so the place was fairly empty when we came but quickly filled up. The greeters were very kind when we checked in, as was our waiter. One of their main draws seems to be the free unlimited Sangrias they allow with brunch, with a great selection of four White Sangiras and for Reds. The servers asked which Sangrias we'd like to start off with and brought them out quickly and with a complimentary bread basket filled with tasty treats and a side of strawberry butter!The server was very helpful with our order and friendly. We ordered the Arepa Con Salmon which came with Sweet Corn Arepa, Smoked Salmon, Soft Scrambled Eggs and Lemon Caper Cream ($23) and the Ropa Vieja con Huevos which comes with Ropa Vieja Hash, Fried Egg, Avocado, Crispy Sweet Potatoes ($22). We absolutey loved both entrees but the Arepa Con Salmon was my favorite. The entrees are also very large and can easily feed two people. Sangrias: The Sangrias were very good and you cab have as many as you'd like while you're working on your food. One thing to note is that they each glass is VERY strong and not watered down as you'd instinctually think, we had two and a half each and were very good. Also as mentioned, they have four selections for White Sangrias and four for Red Sangrias, we mostly stuck to the Reds.

The place was not packed yet at this time and we got seated immediately without reservations. The Yelp check-in offer says you can get a free sangria with the purchase of an entree, but bottomless sangrias is a deal that they honor on a normal basis with or without a Yelp check-in. It is complimentary with your entree no matter what. Their sangrias come in a large cup and they offer many different flavors. I had the Tropical sangria and really enjoyed the fruity taste to it (orange, mango, and pineapple). It didn't seem to be packed with alcohol but I suppose it does hit you by surprise if you're not paying attention. I would highly recommend the Vaca Frita for your entree; the skirt steak is possibly one of the most tender steaks I've ever had and it was packed with flavor. The strong flavor of the meat is offset by the rice, avocado, and sour onion/tomato mixture on the side (it reminded me of the mild salsa that they serve at Chipotle).

Perhaps as I have been there one too many times and have tried other dishes on the menu, I must say the food isn't all that great but if your main goal os to get boozed up for brunch then definitely check this place out.

2.0,10/28/2016,"Had the brunch there on a Saturday. The place seems very popular and hard to get a table , seems that the main attraction is the sangria, which is complimentary if you order a main entree. Great for women and those that love Sangria. The food was nothing to brag about, seemed very expensive for what you get, again, my party seemed to be satisfied with paying the overpriced food given the free sangria.The decoration in the restaurant is way too much, the colors on the walls are way too strong and gave me a headache .",0,0,0,Eduardo F.,"Manhattan, NY",3,26,21

Unlimited GIANT & DELICIOUS glasses of sangria with a purchase of an entree.To top it all off, the food is actually really good too! I got the vaca frita $24 and it was amazing! It was a super tender skirt steak on top a bed of Latin pork fried rice with tomato/onion veggies, avocado, and eggs. Everything about it was amazing.The sangrias are huge and very strong! They have all types of whites and reds. The white with lychee and coconut and tropical were my faves.

The staff was so attentive and always promptly re-filled our glasses. We never felt rushed to leave and had the best experience. Their was great Latin music in the background but low enough to still allow you to talk. The service was fast, food comes fast and they have delicious Colombian bread they bring out before dinner. They have 8 different kinds of sangria - I only tried three but they were all good! The plates are a little on the smaller side, so you may want to take that into consideration if you eat a lot. And price range was about $25-27 per person for one entree plus unlimited sangrias, pretty affordable compared to many other brunches.

Awesome complimentary bread, warm with cruncy extrior and mochi like texture on the outside with ADDICTIVE savory sweet buttery spread (not exactly sure what it is).

The batter on the outside was crispy and was coated in just the right amount of sauce. This sauce was magical. We ate every piece of shrimp and the portion was huge!The salmon has 2 decent sized filets and it sat on a mountain of lobster mashed potatoes. The salmon was moist and tender. The lobster mash had tons of lobster. We also got the rum sangria and it was strong but delicious!This was a great dinner in an awesome hotel.

1.0,10/17/2016,"Unfortunately, I think I am one of the few who did not have a great experience at Calle Ocho.  Let me start by saying, my expectations going into brunch were high.  I had heard about this place a year ago and made a reservation for my birthday brunch at 12:45.  I booked it a few months in advance as well- I was really excited. Upon arrival, my boyfriend and I were seated promptly.  Service was a bit slow if I'm being honest.  The bread came fast, but it took 15 minutes for them to take our sangria order and around 25 minutes to place our food order.  I didn't think much of it, because I thought I had read in reviews that they were pretty lenient on their bottomless brunch 2 hour cap. The food came out and looked and tasted amazing- they were pretty big portions.  We got the Vaca Frita and the Ropa Vieja con Huevos.  Really, no complaints there.  But here's the kicker.  I'm not even halfway done with my meal and have only had two sips of my second sangria when our waiter tells us our bottomless is done. Shocked, I looked at my watch, and it was just hitting 2:00.  Apparently a two hour brunch turned into an hour and fifteen minutes before our waiter was rushing to give us the check and pack up mine and my boyfriends half eaten meals.  I'm really not sure why that happened.  The restaurant had begun to empty so it's not like we were taking someone's table.  Other parties were still being seated for brunch, and brunch didn't technically end until 3:00 (we asked the hostess on our way out because we were still so shocked at the service).  I even considered that it could have just been our waiter's shift was over and he wanted us to pay so he could leave, but he seemed to be sticking around for a while after we paid.  It's a shame to have had such high expectations and now I wish I hadn't chosen this place for my birthday.  Very disappointed with their service, and though I liked what I ordered, it would have been nice to actually be given time to eat it.",0,0,0,Alyxandra P.,"Manhattan, NY",137,67,15

5.0,10/16/2016,"Calle Ocho is the best brunch in the city, period. You will need to make a reservation well in advance and make your way to the Upper West Side, but in the end it is all oh so worth it.The food here is brilliant, but what makes the deal killer is the unlimited sangria. Tasty, well balanced and strong! They have about four different types for each red and white sangria, and they were all excellent! You might not be able to go through all eight of the 20 oz glasses by yourself, so try to sample a bit from your friends.The food was really really good too. They start out with a yummy bread and muffin tray that comes with a nice pink cream cheese spread. The brunch entrees we got were all spectacular. We did the Vaca Frita, which came with a deliciously seasoned piece of steak that was well cooked and tender too. We also got the Gallitos which was tasty and fun, and the chorizo in it was amazing. We also had the Vegetariano paella which had a great earthy, smoky flavor to it.The decor is cool and creative with a traditional sort of flair. The waitstaff is amazing, given the kind of stuff they sometimes have to deal with at a bottomless brunch. Our waiter was friendly and patient, and made sure our glasses were always full, right till the time we were ready to leave.

We had to wave down our waiter a couple of times to get more sangria, but he was super nice. As for food, I got the Maiz y Camarones, and it was delicious!

3.0,9/15/2016,"Set my birthday brunch reservation about 3 weeks in advance for a party of ten at 12PM on a Saturday. When the day comes, we're all running late (which we understand is our fault). The hostess and our waiter kept reminding us that we only have until 2PM to sit at our table (which we already knew since the day I made the reservation). I didn't mind the reminder because I figured they were trying to help us out but they at least reminded us 6 times that we had to leave at 2. We understood that we arrived late, so our time was going to be limited but we all felt very rushed. The waiter served a sangria to one of my friends and then had the nerve to come ID us AFTER he gave her the drink. We were all over 21 and were aware that we had to be of legal age to drink. But no, we were treated like children which led us to have an unpleasant experience.Asides from that, I ordered the Vaca Frita with a side of yuca fries and it was delicious. The food honestly made my day. The sangrias? I had the Spanish Harlem, Punta Cana and a few other white sangrias. They were good but they could've been a bit stronger. But looking at the menu (and hearing from our waiter), if any person in your party gets too drunk, the whole party will be asked to leave. Interesting.

5.0,8/5/2016,"By far one of my favorite weekend brunch spots! Endless sangria with your meal, say no more!!! I've actually never sat in the dinning area though because reservations need to be made way in advance. Me and my friends always take advantage of quick access to the sangria by sitting and having our meal at the bar top! There is also lounge seats around it. Tip your bartender people, he'll make sure your glass is never empty Only thing that would make this place even better would be a small dance space since they play a variety of Latin music..

3.0,8/3/2016,"The food is good (although very limited brunch menu), the service is decent and the atmosphere is acceptable (would have been fine under normal circumstances but the brunch crowd was VERY noisy).  Overall, this is not a ""bad"" choice, but it's just not a great experience either.  Avoid on Sundays if you aren't into free sangrias (and the crowd that attracts).  The menu itself it printed with a full page of ""Don'ts"" about how NOT to drink too much or get too rowdy when drinking sangrias.  That's a pretty good sign that the crowd their ""free sangrias"" brunch attracts is a little too lively - a very loud atmosphere where you can hardly hear yourself think.  A lot of young female customers were lined up at most times around the multiple women's bathrooms.The food was actually very nice and we cleaned the plates.  Well prepared and delicious.  Thus, under more typical circumstances it would have been quite enjoyable.  The only complaint was a very limited menu for their brunch, but it seems that the primary focus of their brunch is the sangria.IF you love sangria, this would be a great choice for brunch!Service was friendly, although we had to wait for pretty much everything we ordered and they forgot to bring appetizers until after our main plates arrived.  Don't go in a hurry.  Example: when we asked for the check it took a good 15 minutes (as our server bounced around having conversations with different tables before we had to remind her again to bring it). If you are nearby this is somewhere we might try again, but certainly wouldn't go out of the way to eat here.",0,0,0,M. D.,"Valley Forge, PA",1,87,47

5.0,7/24/2016,"Yesss I've been waiting weeks to try this place. As my first bottomless brunch experience, Calle Ocho definitely did not disappoint. First and foremost, I loved how accommodating they were with my reservation. I initially made a reservation for 4 people as they said that it was the max they could accommodate; but on the day of, they were more than happy to accommodate my party of 6. Reservations are a must because the restaurant is absolutely packed on the weekends!Before your meal, they give you a complimentary basket of baked goods for the table, which is a nice added bonus. For entree, I ordered the ropa vieja which was tasty, but too meaty in my opinion. Although there is a nice variety of entrees, the sangria is the real star of the show. The list has 4 whites and 4 reds and all seem super yummy. My favorites were the Blanca (really light and refreshing), the Havana Banana (very banana-y), and the Fresas. Be careful though because the wine glasses are huge and they are stronger than you would expect.

Dough was nicely rolled, moist, and had a hint of sweet.Ropa Vieja - Meat was tender, and paired well with the egg and avocado. Loved the finishing touches with the crispy sweet potato shreds.

The food was amazing (and as I said, I'm not a brunch loving person), and the sangria was delicious. They even offered several options for the three children who attended.  There were several people assigned to our room to help with everything we needed. They were very helpful and willing to even help with set up, take down, and moving gifts to our car.  I highly recommend Calle Ocho for a baby shower, or bridal shower, or any type of event.",0,0,0,Kathleen L.,"Houston, TX",80,6,3

2.0,7/13/2016,"We were spending the afternoon at the Natural History Museum and needed somewhere to go for dinner that evening that was pretty close by. I wish we had been a little more flexible and open to moving around, as this restaurant was kind of disappointing.Honestly, the highlights of our meal were the bread basket and appetizer sampler. The bread came with this black bean spread that was delicious, and our appetizer sampler had 5 different items that were all delicious. None was memorable enough for me to remember exactly what it was, but still. Delicious.My entree was definitely underwhelming. Again, I can't even remember what exactly it was, just that it had this potato hash stuff served with it and the potatoes were undercooked. I like my veggies firm, but potatoes kind of have to be cooked past where they're that weird starchy consistency, and these just were not. Considering the price point of this restaurant, I was sort of expecting things to be cooked properly. The rest of the entrees at the table got some ""oh this is yummy""-s but nothing over-the-top great. We had the dulce de lece dessert (probs spelling that wrong, sorry) that was overwhelmed with coconut, of all things. One other dessert that was, you guessed it, not very memorable. My sister got the sangria and it did pack a punch...but I hated the flavor. Luckily she liked it, and she was the one drinking it, so I guess that worked out.PLUS...the service was so slow. This is the second review I've written in as many days complaining about slow service, and really, I try not to, but our meal took over 2 hours. 3 or 4 different servers came by over the course of our meal, so we didn't even really know who was ""taking care of us,"" as they say, so it was hard to know who to look for when we needed something. Plus, we were behind this big pillar, on the other side of which was a register; you'd think this would increase foot traffic of servers to our area, but it certainly didn't help us get anything any faster. By the end of the meal, we were truly exhausted and just trying to get out of there and it took us 10 minutes to get anyone's attention. Also probably heightened by the fact that is was SUPER DARK and VERY LOUD. I could barely read the menu, I could barely hear anything my companions were saying even though there were only 5 of us. The good reviews here seem to be from brunch or something, cause dinner was truly a disappointment.",4,1,1,Katie A.,"New Orleans, LA",126,258,589

It's tasty, but it really does pack a punch. It's disappointing that it comes in such large glasses, because I wanted to try them all, but I totally understand why. I was tipsy in no time, and all the mixing of different alcohol + sugar gave me a headache that lasted most of the day :( that won't stop me from doing this again though - especially considering I live in the neighborhood!On the way out, I asked the hostess if reservations are required for brunch, or if some tables are reserved for walk-in... and I was told that reservations are needed.

4.0,7/4/2016,"It was tough to nab a reservation for this place, but with delicious unlimited sangrias for the duration of your meal, it's easy to see why! They say your table reservation is for a two hour meal and that you can keep ordering sangrias until your party has finished eating the entree, but I don't think they enforce these policies strictly. The sangrias come in a variety of flavors and are served in huge glasses - the coconut one is my favorite of the ones I tried. On the other hand, because of the large size of the drinks, you can't finish them as quickly or sample as many of the different drinks in the time allotted (so ... drink fast). The food was pretty good, reasonably priced (especially so when you add in the free alcohol!) and very well portioned, though not out of this world.

I only got to try the tropical sangria but it was really delicious and I definitely walked out of there more than tipsy. The food is where they lost a star. With all of the wonderfulness that this place had to offer, the food was not as great as I hoped. It lacked in flavor - especially for Hispanic food - and the plates were a little small in my opinion.

Needless to say, we ate a lot during our trip, but none of the dining experiences were better than our dinner at Calle Ocho.The food was superb, with great flavors and perfect presentation, definitely the type of dishes worthy of showing off to your facebook friends.

He raved about this place and with 1,900+ reviews & 4-star ratings - I might as well check it out. So, I made reservations two months in advance for five people. This place is extremely popular for the unlimited sangria during weekend brunch and it's though to get a spot for large groups. It's probably easier to book a spot if it's just two people. You have to play around the Opentable app and check for availability. Dinner reservations could be easier but there's no unlimited sangria.You'll get complementary mini buns, muffins, and croissant with strawberry butter on the side. Everything was warm and fresh. I thought the strawberry butter was alright. I would have preferred plain butter or just jam. For the sangria, I picked the ""Fresca"" and it was a strong drink for me I had to dilute the sangria with a lot of ice. I tried my friend's ""Tropical"" sangria and it's was a light white sangria. I'll get this next time.For the entree, I wanted to try four different entrees. But, I picked what the server recommended and it was also one of the four that I wanted to try. I had the ""Maiz y Camarones"" which is the shrimp and grits (for short). Interesting dish and I rarely eat anything like this too. I got sample my friend's dishes too and both dishes were also on my list. It was the ""Vegetariano"" and ""Vaca Frita"" and both were very good entrees as well.Service was fine. The decor was nice and colorful with big bold colors on the walls. It was slightly loud too for weekend brunch. The only minor complaint I had was that our sangrias were not served in the fancy wine glasses except for the ""Tropical"" sangria. I thought was a bit odd and we saw that other tables had their sangria served in the wine glass.

Ohmygoodness, totally missed out on such a delicious meal! It's true what they say. The bread is so good and fluffy - and with that strawberry butter?? I was already happy before the drinks + entrees started. Unlimited sangria with any entree. The only downside is that the glasses were too big - making it hard to take advantage of all the delicious sangria flavors unless you're REALLY REALLY thirsty. I got the Vaca Frita (skirt steak over rice) - super tasty, hearty meal. Deliciously marinated meat, avocado, 2 fried eggs, topping off some flavorful rice. Ah so good. Near the end of the meal, I couldn't decide if I wanted my last bite to be the entree or the bread+strawberry butter OR the sangria. That is a really good struggle to have. We were a group of 6, and unfortunately one of us had lunch plans afterwards. The restaurant WAS TOTALLY chill though with letting her sit with us, eat the yummy bread, and not order anything to drink/eat.

2.0,5/30/2016,"I've been meaning to check out Calle Ocho for a loooong time. I am a huge fan of Cuban food and with the weather hot and humid lately, I started to get a strong craving for some mojitos and meaty goodness. The restaurant is beautiful, spacious and warm all at once. I think it'd be well-suited for a big dinner with friends or a date. But the prices and the flavor of the food would prevent me from recommending this restaurant. I think this should be $$$ and not $$, my entree was $29 which was average and apps were $15 and up.There were lots of people working and everyone was very friendly. So I was disappointed when the food was really lacking in flavor. I ordered the Vaca Frita. When I've had and made this before, it was a shredded beef dish which was crispy and tender. This was more of an overcooked skirt steak with none of the citrus flavor I was looking for. It was tender, but pretty bland, I really wanted that hit of garlic or citrus and it was nowhere to be found. I ate less than a third of it. I should've flagged down our server but instead I pouted like a big baby, hoping they'd ask why I wasn't eating. But of the 5 people who came by our table in 30 minutes, none of them asked about the food or paid any attention to the fact it was nearly intact at the end of the meal. My friend ordered the glazed shrimp from the appetizers and said the shrimp was sweet but nothing special and the ""avocado salad"" was just a lot of guacamole.

Even in New York, yes I 'stayed in' and ate just because it is so good! Service, ambiance and Great Cuban food...When I asked the waiter (who I might add was one of the best in New York) what I should get for an Appetizer, he pointed to the Chivita. Golden and Red Beets, Spanish Goat Cheese, Garlic Oil, Assorted Greens and one of the best I've had. The flavors of the Beets mixed with the Spanish Goat Cheese is a true taste bud treat!For my main dish I went with the Mary Tierra...Grilled Flat Iron Steak, Grilled Jumbo Shrimp, Manchego Cheese-Hominy Grits, and Lobster Reduction. Not a lot of restaurants offer or can make a Flat Iron Steak, let a lone this good! The entire entree is a well crafted and flavorful Latin Master Piece!

5.0,5/15/2016,"I was looking for a place to have a Sunday brunch with my mom and two friends. I called Saturday night and was told Sunday was booked completely! But I was welcome to come and sit at the bar or lounge area with my party. However , I arrived at 11:45 am and the bar area was already packed! My heart sunk! I really had my mind set on this place. My mom took a seat on one of the couches in front of the restaurant and me and the girls began our search for seats. We noticed a woman occupying two chairs for 20 mins. My friend told a hostess and immediately the hostess told my friend not to worry, she would find us a table. Two minutes later we were directed to a table in the back!

As for the food, despite my previous negative experience with the ropa vieja, I decided to give it another try. Although still too salty (my friend agreed), it was MUCH improved from last time. The flan for dessert was good, but it had the texture of firm tofu, which is too firm for flan, in my book.Unfortunately, a couple hours after eating at Calle Ocho, I didn't feel too good.

4.0,5/4/2016,"What can make a Latin brunch place even more memorable? Complimentary Sangria that's what. My friend and I were a little unsure of this until we asked for the bill in the end. No charge for sangria! Located in the lobby of a hotel, we bumped into this place after coming out of our museum exploring. Although we did not have reservations and they were closing up in 5 minutes (they close at 3 to prepare for dinner) they still sat us with a giant smile. Talk about superb service!To start after offering you the sangria they gave us a basket with mini muffins and Cuban rolls with a side of a strawberry flavored whip spread. These were so good! If you don't watch yourself you can eat the entire basket which is what almost happened to us. Luckily our food came out soon enough. I ordered the vaca frita (shredded flank steak) and it came with rice and beans, an avocado, onions, and an egg. The first bite I have to admit didn't have me in food heaven. All of the flavors mixed came off rather strong. I guess my taste buds just needed some time because after that initial bite I couldn't stop eating it! Such an aroma of ingredients. The steak itself was cooked just like a proper vaca frita should, a combination of tender and crispy. Que Rico!If I had to make a suggestion it would be the egg. I would've liked to have chosen how I wanted the egg. They automatically served it over easy so the yolk leaking out became a tiny mess but it was fine because the rest of the dish was divine. Cherry on top was the salsa music playing in the back. Loved it! Was literally dancing in my chair. I would come back to Calle Ocho but next time want to try out their dinner.

Both of the sangrias I tried (Spanish Harlem and Punta Cana) were a bit too strong for my liking. Hey, there's a certain limit - stronger isn't always better. Then, we waited about 40 minutes for the food to arrive. Mind you, it was busy so it wasn't easy to flag down any of the servers running about. When we were finally able to ask one of them about our food, he said he'll check in the kitchen. A few moments later, a manager-looking man brought out our dishes. Except they had my order wrong. I had asked for the Latin Benedict with duck sausage and this was just a spinach and eggs Benedict. So I had to flag down a server AGAIN with difficulty, and he took it back to the kitchen. Then, a female manager-looking person brought my fixed plate with the sausage, but it must've had been sitting there because everything BUT the sausage was cold. Not even mild, but COLD eggs, COLD spinach, COLD arepa and COLD hollandaise sauce. I was disgusted. She brought a plate of fried plantains as a ""sorry"" but that wasn't what I had ordered or was interested in.I actually started to feel very nauseous, maybe from the sangria or from this really cold, stale plate, but either way, this was not the experience I was hoping for, and sadly I don't think I want to return again and go through all the hassle of waiting for a table, flagging down a server once in a blue moon, and possibly getting served the wrong food again.",0,4,0,Anju M.,"Manhattan, NY",21,144,120

The mancheho cheese was way too strong and the pea vinaigrette did not go well with the paella. I was sorely disappointed. I did like the lounge area in the front. Lots of seating and candles = a low key, relaxed vibe. I'd probably come back for sangria in the lounge, but not for the food.

So we decided to give it a go.  I can't believe that as a huge lover of the Museum Of Natural History that I had no idea this place was so close! Or even existed for that matter.  It's inside the Excelsior Hotel just to the right hand side as you walk in.  The decor and ambiance is pretty nice.  We started with the pineapple mojitos which were great.  My friend who doesn't even like mojitos loved it. I ordered the lechon which tasted very good and exceeded my expectations.  It was served on the bone and just fell right off. Juicy and full of flavor. My friend ordered the Vaca Frita al Caballo aka skirt steak. She and I both agreed it lacked flavor.  It was a bit bland. The great thing was it wasn't dry at all.  Juicy for sure but lacked in taste.  Instead of dessert we drank our calories and ordered more mojitos!",5,4,3,Laura C.,"Flushing, NY",111,247,515

Her attitude made me feel like I was a child and made us feel uncomfortable. They want you to be completely done with your glass before you can request for another. The problem is that then it takes a while for them to get you the next glass since it is so packed. They do not refill as you go like other typical brunch places. The sangria was good and it was not watered down. However, the food was not good at all. We had a party of 12 and no one was happy with their meal. To be honest, there's a ton of places where we can brunch where the food is so much better and where they are not strict about the bottomless drinks.

All of the sangria options were really good, especially the Spanish Harlem, a red with cinnamon and the Havana Banana, a pineapple/coconut white with lychee.They brought us a bead basket not too long after the first round of drinks and all of the options were really tasty - the honey wheat (I think) rolls with the strawberry butter were a really great snack for sangria drinking.We ordered the food, and everything was good. The ropa vieja I ordered though, was phenomenal. Really flavorful and perfectly seasoned. My gf's pollo rancheros was good, but she agreed that mine was the best of the bunch. I don't think you could really go wrong with any of the brunch entrees though.Calle Ocho is really reasonable for 4 people considering the quality of food, service, and the fact that you can literally sit and drink their various sangria for a couple of hours - we had 3 each and were feeling pretty good after.Definitely a place I would recommend.

Not sure what they are called or what they are made of, but the little nugget is GOLD. I couldn't stop munching on them. My friend and I literally ate the whole basket (which had ~10 pieces of bread/brownie, but go for the bread).3. Food was alright but I am overlooking for the drinks and the bread. We got the Vaca fritas (steak and fries) and a side of yuca fries. They came a little cold. Most people around me got this so I assume it was one of their best sellers. However, I am going back again this saturday. That's how much I miss the bread/drinks.Tip: if you have a small party, maybe can snag a seat or two at the bar/lounge area without reservation, but anything bigger than that, call ahead. Also, if you plan to take public transportation there, GO EARLY. The train will most likely delay you for more than 20 mins...

Knowing how busy it was, we called ahead and surprisingly they told us that there were still some seats, so we decided to go. Definitely recommend calling ahead unless you have reservations (I couldn't get any until May).I got there around 12:30 and snagged 2 seats on the bar, but there was still lots of seats in the lounge area. This might just have been a rare case though since it was very cold randomly this Sunday in March. My friend was late by 20-30 minutes, but despite getting busier, the bartender never felt made me comfortable about saving the seat for my friend. I wasn't allowed the unlimited sangria though until I made the order, which makes sense since it's only for 2 hours apparently.I got the Ropa Vieja, while my friend got the Latin Benedict. Both were good, but the Ropa Vieja has a bigger portion size, which I wanted (and needed) because of the unlimited sangria haha. The eggs went well with the hash, and it was the tiniest bit on the drier side for my taste, but I'm not the biggest meat person and I always tend to think meat is dry. Still I enjoyed it, and my friend also enjoyed the Benedict.Now to the sangria, I had 3 glasses: Tropical, Spanish Harlem, and Punta Cana. My friend got the Havana Banana - accidentally twice, so make sure to ask the bartender or waiter to get you a different drink or they might just refill it. I personally liked the Spanish Harlem and the Havana Banana the best. The Spanish Harlem has a nice deep red wine taste, while the Havana Banana was refreshing with still the creaminess without going over to the extreme cloying milky aftertaste. The Tropical and Punta Cana were nice as well, but these drinks felt more watered down, when the fruitiness should have been a highlight.

4.0,2/27/2016,"We were lucky to get a table without reservations at brunch on a Saturday morning! It was all about timing our drop in right after they opened, though there were already plenty of folks waiting at that point. When I heard about the bottomless sangria, I have to admit I was skeptical that it would not be worth the calories, if you know what I mean. How wrong I was! They are actually quite amazing! There is a white sangria with huge chunks of coconut and lychee that I highly recommend. We also had two of the red sangria variants and both were very good.The place is loud and energetic and seemed to be a favorite for ladies having brunch together, as at least 60% of the parties in there were female only.For the entrees: lobster salad did not disappoint! There was surprisingly tons of large chunks of meat throughout and the claw was already shelled on top. I'd say it was about a half lobster total with mixed greens and a delicious sauce with some bite to it. Lobster was cooked just right and not chewy at all.The staple pork and fried egg entree was big and delicious, and our daughter enjoyed the kids menu and blueberry muffin that came with the bread basket as well. Service was great and did not make you feel rushed so you can really take time to enjoy your sangria. There was along wait outside when we left.

One of the few restaurants where I have seen more than one ladies room. I think they actually have three or four (thank you). The service was first rate, we never waited more than a few minutes for anything we needed. The food was good. We ordered a plantano plate with both kinds of platanos, a ceviche entree, a shrimp with guacamole stuffed inside an onion cup, rice and black beans (needed a little more seasoning but that is a personal preference) DELICIOUS!

Order some apps and take it all in! There are several types of mojitos to choose from. I think the mojitos are just $5 which is dangerous for a Monday! If you want to book brunch, book early (2 to 3 weeks early). Not only is the food delicious, the drinks are great too! It's unlimited sangria with your brunch entree.

5.0,2/17/2016,"This is my absolute FAVORITE brunch spot. They sangria so are yum yum (I recommend the Havana Banana and the Spanish Harlem), the food is delicious, the service is stellar, and the feel of the restaurant is perfection. I go here so often for brunch that now when I walk through the door I feel at home. I get cranky going other places for brunch  and complain that it's not Calle Ocho. I also appreciate that when you make a reservation they save your info. In the computer. When I call, they say is this for ""Sherrone"" like they remember me. It's a small thing that make you feel special. I will ALWAYS come to Calle Ocho for brunch. I haven't come here for dinner though, and I don't think I would. It just seems like it should be open for brunch and only brunch all the time. Pros: Brunch, Service, Food, PriceCons: ...Bathroom...The food is great. They got a new executive chef not too long ago, because when I first came here three years ago the food was TERRIBLE, now it's amazing. I always get the ropa vieja for my brunch entree. I have also had the steak and pork fried rice and the lobster entree. Both were also good, but I love me some ropa vieja so I usually get this, like every time. I've also had their maduros which are yummy and came out piping hot. I liked that their maduros were sweeter than they may be in places where they just deep fry sweet plaintain. These must be friend in butter or dusted in sugar or syrup or something. Idk what it is, but don't stop doing it. Now the bread they bring out (and the strawberry butter) should be marketed and sold. The rolls are all warm and yeasty and fluffy. The butter is the perfect compliment to it. The food though is secondary. You come here for the sangria. They have 8? Maybe more different types of sangria and for the price of your entree, the sangria comes complimentary and is served throughout the course of your meal. Now these sangria so are not your normal sangria so, they come in huge glasses and aren't just wine, but have a variety of liquors and liquers mixed in with the wine and fruit and juices they put in. And there is a flavor sangria for everyone. From a lychee and banana flavored one with rum and white wine (my fav) to a peach to a fresh citrus and mandarin to strawberry and berries, to peaches and brandy. Let's just say there's a sangria for you!The service is good. They are generous with the pour and make sure glasses are always being refilled or full. They don't rush you to finish your entree, and despite this place always being packed, they always find a way to be attentive to the customers there. The only con is perhaps the atmosphere, although again, I have only come here for brunch. It quickly becomes a restaurant full of drunk ppl, with a bunch of drunk girls in line to pee. They have three bathrooms, but they are all single stalls, so there is ALWAYS a line at brunch. It would be nice to have a bathroom with a line of stalls to get people in and out more quickly, but that's not exactly something they can fix, so it's a minor con to coming here. If you haven't come here for brunch come. It's great for a large group or for a couple's brunch. It does get crazy though, but I thrive off of the energy of this place.

4.0,2/12/2016,"There is a reason why this place is considered one of the best brunch places in NY. It simply it. First - you have space.  When you are at a table with a large group, you are not sitting on top of ANOTHER large group.  Everyone has an actual seat and elbow room.  You might be there for the boozy brunch, but you're an adult and your treated as such!Second - the service.  The staff is having just about as much fun ad you are and they get that you are there for a good time.  Our waiter was awesome - giving us great suggestions and he kept the drinks flowing. AND I didn't have to ask for a straw. Third - the food.  There are a ton of brunch options for the carnivore to the glutton free/no dairy/i wont eat anything that once had a face group (we all have one in our clique) The down side? good luck getting a reservation.  I made mine weeks in advanced for a birthday celebration.",1,0,1,Lauren P.,"New York, NY",39,169,294

4.0,2/10/2016,"So you pretty much have to book at least a week in advance in order to get a table since it's such a popular place. I wouldn't say this is the best boozy brunch because the sangria there is super sugary. I couldn't even finish my first glass because it was giving me a raging headache. The food on the other hand was delicious. I ordered the Vaca Frita which contains cuban skirt steak, latin pork fried rice, topped with an avocado, and a fried egg. That was sooo delicious. The steak was so tender and just melted in your mouth. It didn't look like a huge portion but I could barely finish it. Also the bread that they start you with off was quite unique but very good. So in terms of the actual meal, I'd give them 5 stars but I was so utterly disappointed by how I could barely even finish my first glass of sangria because of how disgusting it tasted, so that's why I took a star away. The first few sips were fine but then I just couldn't take it anymore... it gave me a headache for the rest of the day. But then again, the price is pretty much unbeatable. I would go back just for a regular meal but probably not for the brunch deal.

Also, the waiter service was terrible.   We were asked in the beginning if we wanted coffee and after we said yes they brought our food but not the coffee. We had to wait for a long time to find our waiter in order to ask for more things. No salt no sugar at the table.

My friends had already arrived & the hostess was nice enough to seat us when I arrived 15 minutes late. I believe the kitchen closed at 3 so we had to order our food quickly which wasn't a problem. After all I was late so it wasn't there fault. They have an unlimited sangria bar & they have sere all different types. The glasses are huge & the sangria is extremely strong so I doubt anyone would be able to try all of them. I had the Maiz y Camarones (a Spanish play on shrimp & grits) and the Havana Banana sangria. Both were so good! I don't eat pork & they were able to make my meal with the bacon. I should also add that I not really a fan of grits but this was great. I would eat there again anytime. The sangria was amazing. It had pieces of fresh coconut & a few lychees. I love lychees so that was an added bonus. There were 4 of us & when the bill came was only paid 30 bucks each.

I did not make a big deal of my birthday and when making reservation simply stated that I request a nice table since it is my birthday. Little did I know, the reservationist noted this down. My server, Cindia, was professional and helpful. The host/manager, Tami, was respectful and really wanted to make me feel comfortable. Luis, the general manager, took his time to walk to the tables to chat with patrons. Such a gentleman. The Colombian pandebono, their complimentary rolls made from yucca root powder and cheese, were exceptionally good, as always. Cindia and Tami made sure I got some to take home. The pandebono is served with black bean paste, which reminds me of black bean hummus, except that it was a little sweet. I had the paella, which was just great. It tastes like paella I had in Spain, except that they added some tart lemony calamari and salsa so it tasted more Latin American. Really good, and a very generous serving, with half a lobster in its shell. The shrimp were so good - not overcooked, rubbery, but just right, which is a real skill to achieve in paella. The mussels and clams were yum! I didn't have any room for dessert, but Luis, Tami, and Cindia heard me saying how much I wish I had room for the flan. The next thing I knew, they were bringing me the flan with a little candle and singing Happy Birthday! I did NOT expect that! Flan was oh, so good, with the mango mousse sauce on the side. Now, one of my favorite NY restaurants - loved this place since before its move to the West Side - will always be part of my b'day memories.

5.0,1/20/2016,"Okay so at 4 stars and 1800+ reviews, clearly everyone else has already said everything that there is to say about Calle Ocho.Came here for Sunday brunch (1/17/2016) with 7 friends and we had a very, very nice time. Everything was great and enjoyable - food, drinks, service, ambiance, everythanggggg. Reservations are definitely a must (like weeks in advance!) We were seated at a round table for 8 which I like SO much better for a big group as opposed to a long table where you can't necessarily see or talk to everyone. The atmosphere was so lively, fun, festive, and the restaurant was definitely filled to capacity. It was the perfect vibe for boozy brunch.The unlimited sangria that comes with ordering off the brunch menu was AMAZING. 8 different kinds to choose from and they're actually really very good, strong, and served in decent size glasses. Our server was great and kept them coming (even after we got the bill, he brought not one but two more rounds for the table!) What a guy...The food was delicious. A lot of places that do boozy brunch tend to skimp on food quality because people are more concerned with getting drunk but Calle Ocho perfected both their sangria menu as well as the brunch entrees. I went with the Vaca Frita (skirt steak with two eggs, rice, and avocado). The steak was cooked well and so so SO tender and flavorful. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their food and we were sharing and passing things around because it was all SO GOOD. The fresh baked bread served beforehand was so warm and delicious. The strawberry butter that accompanied the bread basket was pleasantly different and really good as well.Prices are reasonable at $20-something an entree + bottomless sangria.Again with the service/rest of the staff being fantastic, were were about 20 minutes late but they still held our reservation because one person from the group was there on time and said we were on the way.ALSO, the bathroom was ridiculously clean for such a large and busy restaurant which means the kitchen's clean as well!Basically, I can't wait to return.",5,0,3,Mala L.,"Long Island, NY",514,301,1356

Our waitress was sweet and fairly attentive . For two hours of unlimited drinks you can order from their wide array of sangrias. I think my favorite was the fresas- the whites seemed a little more watery. I ordered the vaca Frita and was pleased with the flavoring of the steak. In past occasions when I've ordered steak, it was close to bland. The pork fried rice was also pretty great.

Everything is around $20 and includes all you can drink sangria. Its mostly eggs, beans, typical mexican fare. This is not gourmet by any means.I tried the Latin Benedicts and it was ok. REALLY small portion.Also tried the Maiz and Camaronez. Its a soupy mix of eggs and grits. Tastes really good but looks pretty unappetizing.BUT, the food isn't the star of the show.

This review is specifically for their dinner service. My friend took me out for dinner tonight and I thought everything was delicious as well. We ordered the Salmon (Spice Rubbed Salmon, Cucumber and onion, Yucca Crab Caraminola with Mango Mustard Sauce on top) and Paella (Lobster, Mussels, Clams, Shrimp, Chorizo, Chicken, Valencia Rice, Tomato-Calamari Salad) to share. The salmon was cooked beautifully and I really liked the yucca crab mash on the bottom. The paella was very filling and contained a lot of fresh seafood. The portions are huge here - we couldn't finish the paella. There's a wide range of white/red sangria depending on what type of fruits you like.

Drinks are unlimited if you order off the brunch menu, and you are capped at 2 hours - perfect amount of time. Atmosphere is lively and bustling during brunch times.

4.0,1/4/2016,"I've been coming to Calle Ocho for years for dinner, and finally I made it out to their legendary brunch a few weeks ago with a couple of friends of mine during Christmas weekend 2015. We came on a Sunday at 12PM, right when Calle Ocho. The wait wasn't too horrible, but this may have been because people were out of town for the holidays. Anyhow, my friends were in the mood for bottomless sangrias, and Calle Ocho definitely fit the tab and hit the spot!As mentioned before, I had come here numerous times for dinner only-- note that the brunch entree options are not served for dinner. There is no bottomless sangria option for dinner and there is no wide assortment of breads served during time either. Only one type of bread is usually served for dinner, which is akin to a sweet white dinner roll and is served with a black bean spread. The black bean spread is absolutely delectable and was something I actually enjoyed, even for me who doesn't like black beans much! As for brunch--this is where the magic happens. My friends and I both shared three entrees (each entree comes with the bottomless sangrias): shrimp & grits, ropa vieja, and mushroom paella, along with a side of plantains (combo of maduros and tostados). All the entrees were delicious, but my favorite was the shrimp and grits as it was creamy, full of flavor, and absolutely mouth watering. Brunch is served with a wide assortment of baked mini breads, muffins and croissants alongside a tasty strawberry cream cheese (?) spread that tastes good when added to all the breads that you are given during brunch!As for the bottomless sangrias, between my friends and I, we tried five of the sangrias, including the Tropical, Punta Cana, Havana Blanca, Roja and Fresas. My favorite sangria was the Havana Blanca since it reminded me of a piña colada and had a perfect balance between sweetness, fruitiness, and alcohol. Of note, the bottomless mimosas have a time limit of two hours, so pace yourself appropriately!  The servers are very attentive, noticing if your sangria glass is empty, and will ask you if you want another sangria. Awesome service!Overall, I have had great experiences coming to Calle Ocho for dinner and I'm happy that I was able to try it for lunch. Excellent food, excellent service and definitely worth the wait. I do like the bottomless sangria option for brunch, so I'll definitely be back here for some brunch and booze. Yum!

4.0,1/3/2016,"Quite an interesting situation here. It seems on weekend brunch there are unlimited glasses of sangria. This explains the dramarama to get a reservation. When I called the night before the very kind gentleman said tables for two normally book two weeks out (!) but that if we came right at opening we could eat at the bar or the lounge area. We did and I'd recommend the bar for their appropriate seating/food placing space over the lounge area, which looked cozier but more precarious and smooshed together. Salmon, arepa omelet was great. Huge and great. Friendo had some trouble with the vegetarian options. They were nice but hilariously could not figure out that meat was not vegetarian, kept recommending ""oh the chicken or the pork has a lot of vegetables"" as if vegetarian meant: likes vegetables. She ended up with a deconstructed other item and was given a side salad.  Sangria is honestly not my thing. But I will say that for made-en-masse booze it wasn't bad at all. And there are so many choices! The one with açai was very strong and the banana one was light and fresh. But you have like 8 options to choose from made in huge jars. A quarter of the bar was filled with prepped filled sangria glasses of all colors. This is a smooth operation.",6,2,3,Claire F.,"Brooklyn, NY",430,700,206
2.0,1/3/2016,"I went here for brunch. I had one of the red sangria and it made me feel sick to my stomach so I only had one (there were a couple other choices and I hear some of the whites are better). If you want a sangria you have to ask the waiter to bring you  glass, but the glasses are quite large so you won't need to call for a waiter every two minutes for a refill. Some of the brunch dishes they serve are a bit odd combinations and the food was sub par. My date didn't like her meal at all and I only ate about 20% of mine before I had to give up. They also were putting the bill on our table immediately after they gave us the food. I understand the place can get busy (it gets very crowded in there), but for what they charge during brunch I'd like to be left alone with my meal for five minutes before you are handing me a bill. Bottom line is this place is worth it if you like their sangria and are going to drink at least a couple, otherwise I'd pass on it and go to a place with much better food and just buy a drink on the side.

Yes, the prices are great, and yes the complimentary sangria is a nice touch, but I think by the time you've gone there for the fourth time, you really notice the little things. Sometimes the food is lukewarm. Sometimes your waiter or waitress forgets to check in on you throughout the duration of your meal, so you only end up with two glasses of sangria. Sometimes they forget to give you bread.

I go up and talked to a waiter and he said to talk to the hostess. She told me that I wasn't supposed to sit there. ""It's not enough space for another pair, it's for a group of four.""

4.0,12/16/2015,"Two words. Bottomless Sangria.Given that this establishment is always booked three months out and I was able to reserve a table for nine within a three week time frame, I mean... ya gotta give your girl credit.Brunch starts at 12pm and it really doesn't look like anyone will pop in at first glance. 1-hour later, BAM, all tables are filled, the sangria is pouring, waiters are running around, and the flow of conversation comes with ease and ever so passionately.Each party is only allowed a 2-hour time frame from when they get their first 20oz drank to when they are cordially kicked out by the manager himself. ""Your two hours are up, we need to seat the next party""... is basically what goes down. The way you take it in your inebriated state is all up to you.The food was pretty good, portions could have been larger given the fact it was *ahem* BRUNCH and you just so happen to also be guzzling down sangria by the liter. The bread basket is probably the best thing there, I'm pretty sure we went through three of those things (just to sop up the excess alc of course)... and sadly my friend felt the (drunken) need to take some ""on the road"" and stuffed them into her purse for future munchies.Rules are rules (yes there ARE a list of rules in the brunch menu), DON'T dance on the table tops or your WILL get thrown out.

I did read the reviews on here, and sometimes, you have to take them with a grain of salt. But they weren't too far off from this place.-For starters, it's a nice ambiance, a tad dark, but it's a nice place. Not crazy dressy, I went in dress pants and converse to be honest. -The service is good, always had water, nice waiter, I don't really pay too much attention to this unless I'm not getting my food.-Food...Here's where things get a little... off. (I won't be commenting on my date's meal, since I didn't taste it)They bring you pan de queso, which is fresh and tastes good, as well as some black bean dip  thing. A tad garlicky, but still good.*I ordered a pulpo a la plancha for the appetizer. It tasted well enough, the squid was soft and not at all rubbery. The sauce had a bit of spice to it, and didn't overpower the squid. It had maybe six 2"" pieces with some sauces dotting the plate. *Dinner was the paella. UM... yes, it had a lot of mix ins; shrimp, sausage, clams, oysters around the dish, and baby clams. BUT damn, the rice had a lot of peas, peppers and onions. It felt like where ever I tried to pick them out, there was more. I'm sure there was as many peas as there was rice. The problem with the dish, is that it tastes like it was just thrown together instead as cooked to be one cohesive dish. The rice didn't taste like much without any of the ""stuff"" on the fork. The lobster claw was bland when I took it out of the shell too. Another comment that seems to be a trend, is that food isn't actually hot. It comes out pretty warm, but not straight from the pan kind of hot, which, isn't very satisfying. *dessert was the domino, 2 domino sized chocolate pieces of cake with dulce de leche ice cream. The ice cream was yummy, and so was the cake.

I just wished they were better able to incorporate the ""pickled jalapeno"" in the dish. It was simply three jalapeno slices placed on top of the pork.

Now, first things first, if you're planning on coming to Calle Ocho for brunch, you should call ahead and make reservations. Otherwise, you should prepare to come early and sit by the bar or the two lounge sections available for those without reservations. I've done both and having a reservation by far is the best thing you can do. The moment you sit down, they'll place a bread basket with a pink side sauce in front of you. Don't make the mistake that I did and eat more than 1 or 2 pieces of bread. The bread is fresh and there is a little bit of variety so it's easier said than done. Also, you'll have a menu handed to you with your food options and a section with all the sangrias you can get. I fancy myself a wine connoisseur and generally enjoy red wine sangria. The 'Fresas' (red wine sangria with berries) and 'Spanish Harlem' which was also a red wine with cinnamon and run were my go to drinks. I did try the 'Havana Banana' which was a white wine, but it just didn't do it for me. The drinks are unlimited throughout the course of your meal.Food wise, I ordered the Vaca Frita which is skirt steak, black fried rice, avocado and eggs.

It makes me think that some customers go over board with the drunken brunch. But why have rules if it never happened? If it happens, then there will be rules set to discourage such behavior. Not the best brunch place I went to. I have tasted better vegetarian dishes. I ordered a Vegetariano. I felt it tasted ok.  It comes with dirty rice, red peppers mixed with red onions and a little bit of green peas. I kept eating the pastry they served. I ordered the virgin pina colada.

From the warm and festive decour and outstanding service, to the delicious food and most notably, the seemingly endless goblets of various sangria.Looking for the perfect start to the holiday month, we made a reservation back in September. I figured that the Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend would be a bit calmer and in fact it was. When we arrived at 12:30 pm, you could have easily walked in and been accommodated.I must have read every Yelp review and can honestly say that anyone feeling rushed or not being able to get a fast enough refill or disliking where they were seated must have visited during a very busy time because every moment of our meal was relaxing and enjoyable.We arrived to our friends already seated with their first glass of sangria. During the meal each of us sampled different flavors, averaging about 3 20 oz. goblets each.....that's almost a half gallon of pretty potent juice !! We had read the house rules and saw that there was a 2 hour limit and I must say that after at least and hour we had almost reached our limit due to our glasses being refilled so promptly ....I couldn't even imagine drinking another sip.The rolls. Ok. Let's just say that I could have made my meal could have been those little round rolls with some kind of sugar cinnamon dusting and the booze !!! Nothing else. The strawberry whipped butter I could have lived without, but it looked pretty on the table.And for the 20 something dollars that the entrees were, even just the drink and rolls would have been a bargain. So now, tipsy and indecisive, we begin to drive our fabulous server Gio, crazy with questions. Many questions. About food that is really not complicated to decipher from the menu. In the end two of us went for the Vaca Frita, an ample long plate of Cuban skirt steak, rice avacado and a perfect over medium fried egg. My favorite part of this was the finely cut tomatoe and red onion that gave a nice fresh zing to the steak and rice. I could only finish half. My friend went with the ever popular Ropa Vieja con Huevos...the crispy sweet potatoes adding a nice sweetness. Lee M seemed to enjoy his Latin  Benedict....poached eggs over pork and duck sausage with a chipotle hollandaise sauce. All perfect choices, all recommended .

That all changed this year when I scored a table for 4 at 2:00pm on Halloween.My friends and I got there at 2:00pm on the dot and after a few minutes of waiting, the hostess sat us down. It took awhile for the waiter to come with menus, but he took our orders for sangria right away while we continued looking for what we wanted to eat. The bread at the table is PHENOMENAL. No wonder people talk about it and the strawberry whipped butter is delicious too. My friend said it tasted like frosting. The breads are very sugary too, but still nonetheless great.Food: Gallitos (for 2, for $32). What a steal! So much food, it can easily feed 3. But it wasn't very good. The corn tortillas were thick which made it hard to make breakfast tacos. In the end I just started mixing the chorizo, guac, eggs, together and eating that. If I could have a do-over I would pay more to get an individual meal. My other friend got the smoked salmon on top of eggs which looked divine. I would definitely go with an individual meal next time I come because it just looked more appetizing.Sangria: Let me preface this with the fact that I LOVE sangria. Ehhhh, the white is definitely better than the red. I got the Punta Cana (Peach/orange/pineapple), tropical (mango/pineapple/lemongrass), and ended with a fresas (raspberries/strawberry). All of it tasted like incredibly sugary cheap wine, which did not sit well with my system. Service: While our service was a little slow, our waiter was very friendly and helpful. He gave us a description of what types of sangria there were each time we placed an order and gave recommendations of his favorites. Around 3:30 when everything was shutting down he asked us if we wanted another round and my friends happily obliged. Afterwards, we hung out in the lounge upfront while we finished our sangria!No doubt in my mind Calle Ocho is the most affordable unlimited boozy brunch in the city. Everywhere that I have been the prices have been $30+. Would I come again? Of course! But I won't be the one putting in reservations...",2,0,0,Karen F.,"San Francisco, CA",84,122,170

3.0,11/18/2015,"I've had better. Surprised about all the over-hyped reviews. We went for dinner so maybe all the good reviews were for their Brunch. We got the Paella and it was pretty good but the rice in the paella was not hot, very lukewarm and the flavor was very mediocre. The chicken plate was nothing special... The picture looks way better than the taste. I guess at least the food LOOKS good, but the taste? not so much. We were kinda confused why others raved so much about Calle Ocho. Food 2/5Service 3/5Atmosphere 4/5If you check in on Yelp, you get a free glass of sangria! But wait our server never brought it....... hahaha oh well. We totally forgot about it until he brought our check so I guess we should have asked about it before. But then again, he shouldn't have forgot it.. lolAnyways, I'm just very disappointed and felt like we wasted a good meal we could have had somewhere else in NYC during our short visit. Nice fancy atmosphere but the food was just blah. Sadly, just because it has 4 stars with over 1,700+ reviews, doesn't mean that it will be worth it. If you really want to still give Calle Ocho a try, I would skip their dinner and only come for Brunch.",8,7,7,Julie P.,"Bellevue, WA",469,141,355
2.0,11/17/2015,"Calle Ocho has been one of the places I've raved to friends, family and visiting guests about. The food, unlimited sangria, the service...to me, it has always been a solid reference which usually resulted in positive feedback. However this last experience left a really bad impression on us. Our group of 10 had brunch at Callo Ocho this past Saturday. When we arrived, the hostess welcomed us and told us we would be dining in the private room. Oh wow, cool! Private room! ...or so we thought. Upon entering the room, we found the rest of our party and before we could even sit, a server  came over and said, ""red or white?"" A little startled but thinking I was just misconstruing his gung ho attitude, I asked for white and my husband asked for red. Without even giving us any options (Callo Ocho boasts 8 different types of sangria on the menu), he plopped down two drinks and moved on. Ooook...maybe he just had extra and wanted to see if anyone wanted them? As we were finishing up our first drinks, one of the girls in our group asked another passing server what other types of sangria there were. At first it seemed like he hesitated and started to say they were only at the bar, which made no sense to us, but then rambled off our options and took our orders: 4 Havana Banana and 2 Tropico. Ooooohhhh yeeeeaaaaah. While we were waiting for our drinks and still waiting to order, the first server promptly came over and started refilling the red sangrias. Not wanting to break the house rules, we quickly stopped him and said we had already placed an order for sangria. This. made. him. mad.""NO. I AM YOUR SERVER. YOU ONLY ORDER FROM ME. THERE IS ONLY RED OR WHITE SANGRIA BACK HERE.""Our group was completely taken aback from this. We apologized for ordering from the other server and said we'd only order from him but after that he basically ignored our table; except to refill glasses with RED or WHITE sangria. However, we decided to make the best of the situation and continued to enjoy each others' company. As the rest of us were finishing up our entrees, two of the guys in our group were still hungry so they added the Gallitos or Platter of Traditional Costa Rican Soft Tacos for 2. They weren't even finished with the platter when the server dropped the bill onto our table. One of the girls in our group, asked really nicely if we could get one more round of drinks since they weren't done with their food yet. The server stared at his watch (it was 1:30 and we hadn't even placed our original orders until 12:30) and said fine, we could have ONE more round. He came by and with lightning speed poured our drinks; some of which were barely half a glass. I'm not sure if the server was on a super power trip, or having a bad day, or just didn't care since 18% gratuity was already included but we decided it was the last time we'd have our group brunch at Callo Ocho. If you do decide to visit Callo Ocho, I would strongly advise that you ask to be seated in the main dining area.",6,0,2,Vanessa T.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",93,68,84

Secondly, we had to wait for a bit at the bar, and the bar staff was friendly, funny, and helpful. Once we sat, our waiter gave us these delicious bread balls. Literally had like 4 of them, they were so good (and I was starving, so it's definitely a good appetizer substitute if you want to get straight to the entree). I ordered the skirt steak with avocado, Latin fried rice, and a fried egg. It was DELICIOUS. it was also a huge portion, so I didn't even get to finish it all. I literally Have no complaints.

Don't expect to be seated at a table (especially with a larger group) without reservations on a Saturday or Sunday.But seriously, finishing up my meal now after feeling treated like a king.

We had 4 dishes together...the rock shrimp chicharroh, was the best dish of the night...amazing!!!! the pulpo, my girlfriend n I debated if this was better than the shrimp...she liked this one better bc it was healthier...very spicy and also amazing! Next was the huachinango which is a red snapper ceviche...tangy lime and cilantro flavored...also excellent, fresh n flavorful! Lastly was the dulce...empanada with goat cheese...my girlfriend is more of an empanada fan and she loved it, I thought it was a little gritty but still very good. We had two red wine sangrias...the Spanish Harlem n the fresas...both were very similar, large glasses n tasted good, but not your typical sangria more tasted like wine then sweet.  Overall an amazing dinner!

5.0,11/7/2015,"I hosted the rehearsal dinner for my wedding last month in Calle Ocho's private dining room.  It was WONDERFUL!  I honestly cannot say how wonderful it was!  I called pretty much every restaurant on the Upper West Side, and determined that Calle Ocho was without-a-doubt the most reasonably priced (I think it was $60 per person for a three course meal with 2 options for each course, including wine, beer, and sangria.)  Each and every dish was heavenly - people are still raving about the food a month later!  The waiters were fantastic, and there was never (never!) and empty wine glass.  Just ask my Mom, who does not drink much, and had a major headache the next day as we were preparing for the wedding!  The waitstaff was not only attentive, but assisted us in setting up the projector for a slideshow as well as running to turn off the overhead music whenever someone stood up to give a speech.  Further, in the months leading up to the event, the managers were very responsive via email and open to special requests (vegetarian and kosher options, for example.)  This is the number one place I would recommend having a wedding reception, or any private dinner, on the Upper West Side!",1,0,1,Alice L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,10,3
4.0,11/6/2015,"Calle Ocho has bottomless sangria with an order of an entree. The wait for a walk-in can be very long so try to make reservations. The food is pretty good; typical Latin American options. They have a pretty wide assortment of sangria flavours, both red and white, so that's the draw here. As long as one has food on the plate, one is allowed to keep drinking. Try to get the waiter's attention for a refill right before you take your last sip of sangria because service can be a bit slow since there are so many patrons.I highly recommend Calle Ocho for a group brunch since there's a lot of space, but definitely try to make reservations beforehand.",0,0,0,Jem S.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,470,182

When I got that reminder, that call to confirm my reservation I was so excited! The boyfriend and I arrived a few minutes after 12 and was promptly seated in a two person booth. Great music in the background, sweet sweet statues every where, and a nice sunset orange on the walls. Immediately we got water, a cuban cigar tray filled with cinnamon, walnut, blueberry muffins and warm cheesey bread with a side of strawberry butter, and also offered our first glass of 20 oz wine. In the end we had tried the Spanish Harlem, a red, had a deep red and fruity flavor, rather heavy to drink a lot of. The Punta Cana, a white, was light a fruity, while the Tropical was strong with rum and hints of peach. We ordered the Vaca Frita, salty, flavorful, a good contrast to all the sweet, sweet wine, the rice was a bit dry, the meat was plentiful and tender, the egg, perfectly over easy, the avocado ripe, and the tomato/red onion mix was great. The ropa vieja con huevos was a bit too saucy to my liking, that the potatoes pretty much soaked up all the meat stew, so it would have been nice had it been rice and beans instead of potatoes.  After two glasses each, countless cheesy bread rounds, and an entree, we were more full than drunk from the brunch. The service was great, atmosphere upbeat, food decent. For about $22 per person not including tax or tip, it was a great deal for a Sunday brunch. The bathrooms were clean, it's located in the Excelsior hotel, the Museum of Natural History is right across the street, oh and if you still have room to order dessert I would eat it for you.

4.0,10/20/2015,"""Calle Ocho"" is named after a landmark in the ""Little Havana"" neighborhood in Miami. The menu here is a combination of Little Havana and New York City. They're very well known for their complimentary unlimited sangria offering during brunch.Having worked in the neighborhood before, I have been to Calle Ocho for dinner before, but this was my first time visiting for brunch. Note: if you want to have brunch here book a reservation way in adavance. I would recommend at least a month in advance. They're very popular, and when my friends and I arrived you could tell how busy they were from the the crowd at the entrance. Service was good. Once most of our group arrived we were seated. The waiter was efficient, and the food was brought out in a timely manner. My favorite part of the meal was the complimentary bread that came out before the entrees. They give you a mix of rolls, & muffins with strawberry butter. They were all delicious, and I would go back just to eat those again. I ordered the Ropa Vieja con Huevos. It was delicious, and the protion size of meat was decent. My only complaint is that I wish there would have been more crispy potatoes included. It came with only a few. The sangrias were good, and they did and excellent job of refilling our glasses without having to be asked. I also got the Domino cake for dessert. It had good flavor, but the cake itself was a little dry. My favorite part was the Dulce de Leche ice cream that came with it.Calle Ocho does an awesome job of giving you a taste of Little Havana. Their unlimited sangria offering is how they attract you, but their food delivers and completes the overall experience.

1.0,10/3/2015,"I recall years ago this place was great. It's cute and busy, but the food has gone downhill. We had the octopus appetizer, which was very heavy. The paella was mediocre, not flavorful and not made traditionally. The large appetizer dish with plantains, rice, beans, yuca fries and arepas was not great. It had no dips for the yuca fries, which were over fried and flavorless. The plantains and arepas were decent, but not even close to great. The rice and beans were weird to be included in an appetizer and just standard. Overall I question the reviews here and wonder if the place has hired reviewers to give it such high reviews. As a New Yorker, this was not good at all. The service and atmosphere was fine, but nothing was even decent. There's a lot to compete with in this city - even uptown where food isn't as great - and calle ocho didn't do it. For those prices, they need to up their game.

I'm pretty new to the brunch game but I enjoyed myself. The sangria (four whites/four reds) is unlimited so long as you're still eating and you get about 1.5-2 hours. I'm not a huge sangria girl but the tropical was my favorite. The Havana banana does not taste like bananas at all, much to my disappointment. I also liked the red one with the acai and the blueberries, I can't remember the name. Maybe Samba but whatever. I only had like three glasses and I was feeling pretty nice. They give you a complimentary bread basket with some type of pink butter and there's some bread in it that looks like it has raisins, surprise, it's freaking chocolate chips and it's delicious. My actual food was pretty good, I ordered the vaca frita. The skirt steak was awesome but I thought the rice would have some more flavor, it tasted a little over cooked.

I was so annoyed so I actually told the waiter who said he'll tell the manager and nothing happened. I wasn't upset enough to complain even more I guess because the delicious wide variety of unlimited sangrias had me in a care free mood. So to compensate for my lack of grits I ordered a side of yuca fries. That was pretty good as well.This place is nice. You get boozed up by really good sangria mixes that don't taste like straight sugar, you can definitely feel the wine. The food is very tasty and the price is great.

I wish I had pictures of the food and drinks to post with this review, but we honestly devoured everything so quickly. The food was great and the drinks were even better; large and potent. They also serve little complimentary Brazilian cheese breads as a starter (very appetizing). To recap: Amazing food, large drinks; marvelous service.

4.0,9/26/2015,"Now this place knows how to go hard for brunch, no joke. A little too hard. The key is the unlimited sangria, which comes in so many flavors. Delicious booze infused flavors. I was in a sangria coma by the end of the day lol. This place is incredibly hard to get into. I had to make the reservations almost two months in advance. Totally worth it though. We went for a friends birthday. They start you out with a delicious basket of breads with an amazing strawberry cream cheese? or something strawberry flavored. Anyways it was good. I started pounding down the alcohol at this point. By the end of the day, I had 5 sangrias lol I got the shrimp and grits. It was pretty good. It may not have been the best that I have had in the city, but then again this wasn't a Southern restaurant, so you can't really compare the two. The nice part about it was that after we had eaten and technically the restaurant was closed, we moved to the bar area and had one more drink. Good times.",0,1,2,Lindsay S.,"New York, NY",93,283,230

4.0,9/24/2015,"UNLIMITED SANGRIA (with a purchase of a meal during brunch for 2 hours).I mean that's all you need right? There are about 3-4 different flavors of reds and whites, so there is plenty to choose for everyone ranging in sugar/dryness levels.The food came out really quick, but my friend and I got two of the most popular dishes so I'm sure they kitchen is just preparing them like a machine back there. We got the pollo rachero and the vaca frita. I like both of them equally, but I think I'd lean more towards getting the chicken again because I felt like it had more flavor. Also, I didn't love the spanish rice that came with the vaca frita. It had a smokey taste to it, and that's not usually my thing, but it might be wonderful for those who like a smokey flavor! The waitress we had was ok on the attentiveness, but I understand the place is super busy so I don't fault her too much as she did come in to check on us about twice or so. We didn't feel rushed even though we had a 2:15pm reservation, and their brunch ends at 3pm. Though the manager did kindly ask us to move to the bar to finish the sangria, and that was no big deal.

Check, check, check.A group of four of us stopped by for Sunday brunch around 1:30pm. We didn't have a reservation and arrived prepared to wait close to an hour to be seated. To our surprise and expert hawking skills (and probably good timing), we snagged four seats at the corner of the bar within 15-20 min. We were initially apprehensive if we should wait for a table, but I'm so glad we stayed put. Being seated at the bar, we had more attentive service and it was so much easier to flag down the bartender for our second, third, fourth, and yes, for one of us, FIFTH glass of sangria. On that note, the selection of sangria is great and they definitely pack a punch- so be careful! For my entree, I tried the Maiz y Camarones aka shrimp and grits and all I can say is: wow! This dish was packed with flavor! As a huge fan of yuca, I was super excited to see that they offered it as a side on the menu. The bartender recommended two orders for the four us, which actually ended up being too much in addition to our individual entrees. Either way, the yuca was pretty tasty and I couldn't get enough of the smokey tomatoey sauce it came with.The only downside of our whole experience was that this place was super busy; so service is slightly rushed and stretched (and not to mention, it was a bit loud in there).

The atmosphere of this place (heightened by the Latin music background) is inviting. We started off with their freshly baked complimentary bread which was heavenly.  That, of course, was just a teaser. Our appetizer, which we decided to share, was the Langosta (poached lobster with grapefruit).  Its a delightfully interesting take on the usual ceviches I've had before. The serving is barely good for one, by the way...lesson learned the hard way.I had the lechon for my main course. It was not spectacular but it was above average. Yes the meat fell off the bone easily but I'd say that it's a little bit salty for my taste .  Plus beware the pickled jalapeños. That duck breast though...that duck breast was outstanding!

Not because the food was bad, because it really wasn't! But because there was a disparity in the portions that my boyfriend and I received. If you look at the 2 photos I put up, you'll see that I got a measly piece of meat while my boyfriend got a much larger piece. I'm sorry, Calle Ocho, and I understand that people probably come here for brunch more for the drinks than the food, but you definitely need to step up your game and fix your consistency issues.There was definitely not enough meat to complement the rest of my dish so my very generous boyfriend gave me some of his.

The food it's good. Not vegetarian but the vegetarian paella it's great. The sangrias are tasty and that bread basket they give you is to die for. So great food and good price. But your staff? They are seriously lacking to the point of being border line rude. I can give you an example. My friends were eating there and called me to meet up. They were almost done with their meal and I asked if I could order something. The waitress said yes and I ordered and was happy. When the food came she told me I had until x time to finish, which only gave me like 20 minutes to eat. I didn't even reply and ate at my normal pace. Just say no, we have people waiting you can't order please go to the bar. Don't bring me the food and ask me to gulp it down! Grr! And this is just one of the incidents I had with your staff.

Second tip: pass on the paella and order one of the other super well prepared dishes such as the cuban skirt steak (You could cut it with a fork...I mean come on!!). Yes the paella looks impressive with shellfish sticking out and whatnot but it is sorely missing some components of a good paella. First of all once you eat the one lobster claw, handful of mussels and clams, and a few pieces of shrimp and calamari you are left with this GIANT bowl of rice. Great if you like rice, especially kind of bland rice. Not so great if you are looking and your hubby's amazingly tender skirt steak wishing you had ordered that instead. Did I mention you should probably pass on the paella?? Still dreaming about that steak! For dessert order the bread pudding thing with the apple ice cream.

This place is really popular and is constantly overbooked.The highlight of their brunch is the unlimited sangria. They have different flavors in both red and white wine. You should try them all. Note: There is a time limit of an 1 hour and 45 minutes so make sure you drink as much as you can/want in that timeframe.They start you off with a box of bread. It literally comes in a wooden box. They also give you some delicious butter to use. I really liked the cornbread. The cornbread's secret ingredient is probably crack.The food is amazing as well. I ordered the Duck Sausage Benedict. I'm not really a fan of eggs benedict, but this was amazing. The sausage was so flavorful, and the egg was poached to perfection. That hollandaise sauce though. Damn. It was amazing.

5.0,8/23/2015,"I wanted our last evening in NYC to be a memorable one. How else do you do that without dining at a great restaurant? I finally narrowed it down and decided on Calle Ocho. LOCATION: Inside the Excelsior hotel. You go down the stairs and the restaurant is to the right.SETTING: Very dim lighting, which works for a romantic date night, however, the space is large enough to accommodate bigger groups. Booth seating & tables available. Cumbia & Salsa music playing in the background. SERVICE: Our server was knowledgeable and gave his honest opinions about the menu items. We liked that a lot! Both our sever and the busboys were attentive and fast. DRINKS: Mojito- strong, flavorful & tasty!! Highly recommend. FOOD:**The Ceviche Mixto was great! Strong citrus flavor, without being overpowering, (no puckered face following a bite of this plate). The base to the ceviche was creamy. The seafood was very fresh. **The Paella was excellent!! Lots and lots of seafood here. A big lobster, shrimp, clams, mussels, chorizo and chicken were loaded on the plate. We didn't feel short changed here. The rice and tomato salad were good accompaniments to the dish. **Vegeteriano- it was just ok. I wouldn't get this again. The mushroom paella wasn't flavored well, in my opinion. It was too chewy, also. The Guatemalan green bean salad that topped the dish was very flavorful, but the dish itself left a bit to be desired. **Domino Cake- I'm not usually the biggest chocolate lover, especially not chocolate cake, but this was delightful! Dark chocolate cake with a Dulce de Leche ice cream center was a perfect ending to an overall great meal. OVERALL: One item might not have gone over famously, but that's ok.

Then, we ordered a pitcher of roja sangria and also redeemed a complimentary glass by checking in. As for appetizers, we had the ceviche mixto and calamari. The portion of ceviche was fair and the presentation was nice. The calamari had an interesting twist. It was glazed with honey and topped with cashews, sesame seeds, and sprout salad. Our entrées took awhile to arrive but they kept refilling the bread in the meantime. We ordered a variety of entrées. First and foremost, the paella was a huge portion. The seafood was a bit dry but it was still tasty nevertheless. Each of the meat entrées we ordered (Vaca Frita, Lechon, Pato) was very tender and perfectly seasoned. The Mar y Tierra only came with two pieces of shrimp but the delicious steak made up for it. There was also a special for the night, a Mahi Mahi entrée. The portion was a bit small and they didn't have the red quinoa that they said it came with so I was given the option to substitute with whatever side.I rarely dine in upper west side, yet alone inside a hotel.

The bread baskets are also awesome here, I think the bread may be made from corn? They're slightly sweet, but very soft on the inside with a nice crust, and come served with some sort of bean paste. We got the Gallitos as an appetizer for the table--basically a build our own taco platter with spicy chicken, beef, shrimp, guac, sour cream, etc. The beef and shrimp were awesome, the chicken a little dry and lacking in flavoring. I got the salmon which came with a mango chutney and lobster mashed potato. Each component was pretty good, and they'll ask what temperature you'd like your salmon to be cooked to, but I found the mango chutney to be unnecessary.

3.0,8/17/2015,"I would have bumped it up a star if Calle Ocho had kept their self-serve sangria bar, but given how you don't even get that novelty anymore, well, there's really not much that separates Calle Ocho from the other Cuban restaurants that serves bottomless sangria brunch. Other than the 1-month reservation and the standout bread basket with the strawberry butter. Aside from a chunk of chocolate chip bread the size of my fist, the rolls were disarmingly small, so I ate around 3 of the rolls with the chewy mochi-like interior without thinking too much of it until I had to stop eating my vaca frita. I ... did not love the sangria. I think I ordered all the wrong flavors. I also confess to only being able to stomach two of the glasses before I wanted to take a nap in the sun. But the Banana Havana tasted like that Laffy-Taffy banana flavor and the Tropical contained an overly medicinal cherry aftertaste. I did love the vaca frita though. It's steak on top of pork fried rice, avocado slices, and runny eggs. There's not much to screw up here. Highly recommend making a reservation before you come but even if you don't, there's a small lounge area at the front of the restaurant where you can also partake in okay sangria.",5,1,1,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1203,824,173

5.0,8/11/2015,"It's been....YEARS....since I've been able to eat the bread placed on the table before a meal. Years. We sort of stumbled into Calle Ocho on our way back from the Met to the tube, and we weren't quite sure what to expect. It was late, we were ravenous, and so anything remotely palatable sounded like a good plan. Luckily, Calle Ocho is so far above ""remotely palatable"", we almost couldn't handle it.You enter the restaurant through the adjoining hotel lobby, which is....a decorative treat. Velvet and mirrors and gold and that feeling of ""this was probably a decadent space back when it was first furnished"". Now, the lobby feels old but inviting... (kinda like how your wacky grandma's house feels. You know, the one who hoards her costume jewelry and has a plastic cover on her 1980's white sofa, and an exotic cat she named Clementine who should've died three years ago but now she just sits on - or might actually be stuck to - the plastic sofa licking the last of her fur while Wacky Grandma feeds her flakes of fish food while singing old 50's ballads). Anyway. The restaurant itself is a complete 180 from the hotel lobby. Low-lit spaces, a lovely contemporary/latin mixture of decor, instrumental background music. The whole place feels like you've been invited to a high-end nightclub that's been temporarily transformed into a restaurant for the evening. Service was impeccable, Richard F was our waiter. He was kind enough to bring this Celiac TWO helpings of the Pan de Bono (because I had basically said ""f*ck it"" and proceeded to stuff myself til the seams bulged like Wacky Grandma's sofa cushions). The bread is made with precooked cornmeal and Queso Fresco so it's soft and chewy and sweet and tastes like ACTUAL bread. Not to be outdone, the Dulce Empanada on the appetizer list is a thing of culinary mastery. I can't even begin to do it justice in an explanation. Just....order it. If you're in this neck of the woods, please do yourself a favor and make your way to this wonderful restaurant. You'll leave feeling like you've been sitting on soft velvet, petting a kitten, while listening to your grandmother hum lullabies. Or something... ;)",4,3,3,Virginia M.,"Reno, NV",197,145,18

2.0,8/8/2015,"I've loved Calle Ocho for as long as I've lived in NYC (7yrs, much longer than any of my romantic relationships), though I must say that my last visit last Saturday wasn't the most rewarding. Not sure if it was the server or the restaurant's changes, but it definitely had me apologizing a lot to an out-of-town guest more times than I could count. The place is known for it's leisure and cool atmosphere as much as its complimentary sangrias and melt-in-your-mouth breads, but when I got to the bar, the bartender was very pressing for our orders (he asked literally as soon as we sat down), and wouldn't serve us anything until we gave it to him. I'm sure it's the case with any restaurant who's known to serve complimentary items that they are sometimes taken advantage of, but to not even serve us water on a 93-degree day appeared as the height of bad service. Also, never a good policy to make customers feel like thieves for frequenting your business.We actually ended up ordering our food in record time, despite my guest not only not being a NYer, but having never eaten at a Cuban restaurant before (excuse the triple-negative). This was also partly b/c the bartender couldn't describe any of the dishes to us, or the difference in portion sizes (shrimp & grits pretty small; pollo ranchero usually filling). Even still, it was hard to get the bartender's attention for much of anything (e.g. more water, silverware after the food arrived), though it was relatively unbusy for the latter end of brunch. Our bread also never came, though we asked more than once, to which the bartender first replied that the kitchen had run out and was ""cooking it up fresh"", followed by a confession that the kitchen had declined to make any more since brunch was now almost over...we'd been sitting there for 45min?! NOW you're out of bread, after you waited so long to make sure we wouldn't eat and dash?? And don't they still serve bread for every meal time?? Outrageous. No apologies, no consolation. The only saving grace that day was the surprisingly strong sangrias...or maybe it was because we'd been forced to wait so long without sustenance. Either way, one did the trick. Also, the bartender did allow for sangria changes for customers who didn't like a particular flavor. Bonus:  that goat cheese and mushroom omelette was to die for!Would I do it all over again?

The amount of lobster is substantial, I left both times from Calle Ocho very full & satisfied! Great place for a boozy brunch, not too pricey for what you get!

It was homemade sausage patties sitting on a cornmeal cake with a poached egg on top. It was very delicious and a nice twist on a classic brunch meal. However, the portion sizes are quite small. I would have liked some potatoes or something to go with it. Drinks: Not only are the drinks delicious, they are strong. There are bits of fruits floating in it so it's very sweet.

He had asked us if the tip we left him was ""correct"". I didn't know that there was a ""mandatory"" amount that we needed to leave so he basically guilted us into leaving more money. This was not only EMBARRASSING but totally not necessary. After we had already spent a large amount on our bill, we apparently had to shell out for a larger tip because the server didn't feel we gave him enough.

The Sangria tasted like straight up juicy juice (I'm not convinced it was actually made with wine). Overall the service was attentive (despite the waiter's horrible misjudgment of 4 people's appetite) but the food was vastly overpriced for its mediocrity.

For $32, I was disappointed, but I kept reminding myself that the food came with unlimited drinks and that is why the lunch items were so pricy.

4.0,5/27/2015,"I went to Calle Ocho with a few friends after a reservation someone had literally fell into our laps. We had a great time as the atmosphere is fun and the Boozy Brunch is all the rage. Starting with the sangria options, there were enough to try a few and still have some left to look forward to next time. The whites were lighter and easier to drink than the heavier reds, but overall they were all very good. The service was unusually slow, but I do attribute it to the fact that they don't seem to have zones and seemed perpetually understaffed. For the entree, I split the chorizo taco spread with a friend. The eggs were overcooked, but the chorizo was delicious and the fillings were given in generous portions. They gave us a healthy serving of tortillas and between the two of us, we barely finished! They did let us prolong our meal a little bit while taking advantage of the sangria with no complaints.",0,1,0,Danielle D.,"Manhattan, NY",2,30,0

4.0,4/23/2015,"Delicious food at a decent price with an awesome unlimited boozy brunch. Yes, they offer an all you can drink brunch deal. How it works: As soon as you order your food the unlimited sangria starts. The unlimited sangria ends once your plate is taken away from you. Very simple. People take their time eating in order to take advantage of the deal but the glass serves a large portion which is also very heavy in alcohol content. Just two glasses is enough to make it a boozy brunch. Also, it gets beyond crowded!! I suggest always having a backup spot bc unless you make reservations it is not guarantee that will snatch up a seat. We ended up having brunch by the bar and my bf had to stand for a while until a chair became available. I liked eating by the bar bc we got more attention from the bartender. Since there are so many sangria flavors, he explained how we don't need to finish an entire glass if we don't like the flavor we picked. We had the option to switch flavors whenever we wanted. He also gave us complimentary shots since we were celebrating our friends bday. Clearly, the staff is beyond friendly!

5.0,4/11/2015,"Calle Ocho gets a gold star for BOOZY BRUNCH EXCELLENCE. As soon as we were seated we were asked for our sangria drink orders. Choosing from among the many delicious options was easy because I knew I'd be able to sample soo many. Erring on the side of adventure, and because why the hell not, I was able to sample every white wine sangria on the menu. All of them were fantastic, but my personal favorite was the Tropical. The strong punch of hard liquor infused so well with the fresh mango, mandarin oranges, and pineapple. Once our group was good and tipsy, a platter of round pastries was brought out with strawberry butter. The pastries were amaaaazing, perhaps my favorite part of the meal...their slightly crispy exteriors contrasted beautifully with the dense, almost creamy interior, and the beautifully colored strawberry butter added a perfect richness that left me wanting to finish the entire plate by myself. But before I could ask the waitress for another plate of pastries, our entrees were brought out. I ordered the Vaca Frita. The skirt steak was cooked surprisingly well!! It was tender, flavorful and the portion was generous. The steak was nestled atop a bed of equally flavorful pork fried rice and accompanied by a slice of avocado and 2 fried eggs. I found the eggs kind of flavorless and unnecessary for the dish...but I ended up being glad they were there because as they sat on my plate throughout the meal, they allowed me to continue to order drinks, per restaurant policy.

Both entrees arrived at the table cold but yet a side order of sweet plantains arrived burning up on fire. I informed one of the 2 servers/ manager (afren ) who took care of my table and they removed the 2 dishes.

Also let me add that one was a medium skirt steak which was now brought back WELL DONE i couldn't be bothered for them to try to fix this mistake a 2nd time because we had theater plans nor did they offer to fix it and one dish came back without a salad that was suppose to accompany it.I work in a restaurant i would have let this slide on a busy night but there were hardly 8 visible tables.  Seriously big disappointmenti can't even begin to describe how much yelling n extra noise i wanted to make but i let that all go.,1,1,0,J F.,"Woodhaven, Queens, NY",57,9,0

4.0,3/15/2015,Went here recently for a group of friends of mine annual holiday dinner. Only had a few appetizers here which is not like me because I eat...A LOT. But was a little low on funds that day so I just spent within my range. The empanadas that I had were very good though and had a specialty drink that Calle Ocho's had. Enjoyed much of what I had and of course the company I was with and this place was not crowded nor overbearing as far as trying to get us out considering as usual with my group of friends we were the last ones to leave the restaurant.Definitely a nice restaurant for a medium size group of friends or a date night.

4.0,3/14/2015,"I've been here before but didn't remember the experience. And no, it's not because of the unlimited brunch sangria, because I remember barely finishing a glass since I don't like wine much. Fast forward. This time around, my friend was elated that she managed to score a reservation with 2 day notice (apparently it usually takes 2 months) for her birthday brunch. The second I sit down, our awesome waiter Tico is offering me a glass of Sangria before I can check out the menu. Uhh err uhh ummm SURE. I asked for the fruitiest one (Tropical) and nursed the magically refilling bottomless glass. Fun breadbasket on the table had chocolate-chip rolls and yummy buns.I got whatever the dish is with the skirt steak and was not disappointed. I think I dug into it before my friend was able to snap a shot for Instagram. OOPS. Tender, juicy, deliciously seasoned on a bed of tasty rice. I'm almost upset I didn't take the leftovers to go.There must've been about 4 other tables there celebrating somebody's birthday today! Every 10 minutes another group was singing! So I pull Tico over like ""We gotta get in on this! We're here for this girl's birthday!"" After our plates are cleared the embarrassed and surprised birthday girl is presented with a chocolate Tetris-looking cake slice and scoop of dulce-de-leche-tasting ice cream goodness. With three spoons so we could all get in on the fun. So I'm writing this review now before I forget all about the greatness a second time.

I was originally considering a different establishment for the birthday dinner, but I had such a horrible  experience trying to book a reservation. So I thought of Calle Ocho, and God knows I'm glad I did. The woman who answered the phone was extremely courteous and professional. She answered every question I had, and even let me know that the day I was requesting was the last day of restaurant week. That meant my group was able to take advantage of the restaurant week prix fixe prices. I had a few special requests since it was a surprise bday dinner, and they accommodated my every need. We all had an amazing time. Our waitress was great, my Paella was outstanding, and that Spanish Harlem sangria?!?!?! LAWD!!! I have no complaints with Calle Ocho at all!!

We decided to go heavy on the small plates and order one entree between the 3 of us. Everything was amazing. Highlights: The Dulce - sweet, creamy deliciousness; The Arepa - probably could eat that at every meal for the rest of my life. Their guac with them plantain chips - dang.

It was easy to get to and find and great ambiance to the place, very nice yet felt casual. Everyone seemed to be having a good time. The hostess and wait staff were all great. My group and I were sort of loud at time and we were never asked to keep it down. They just nicely said oh you guys are having a good time huh. Which is polite talk for shut the hell up already. Lol It was restaurant week in NY so some of us had food of the prefix menu and others had food from regular menu. From the appetizer to the entrée and desert, everything was delicious. Not one person had a complaint. I had the patacon appetizer, with filet mignon entree and the Pudin desert. All were delicious. My steak was great though I would have liked it a little more rare.   Overall, we all had a great experience at Calle Ocho and I would be there again in a heart beat and recommend all to try it.

4.0,3/4/2015,"Calle Ocho is a hit with me. My Latin roots are instilled in the amazing decor and restaurant that serves Don Julio tequila the way it's suppose to be served. The food has the flavor of the special Sofrito blend for the meat dishes which makes me happy. Loved the appetizer menu with a nice selection of fish and portion size, is like a meal in its self. The music is my kind of music. Salsa a todo queda and other Latin grooves. A very comfortable place to chill with your significant other or a small party of six. Service is on the money and on point. My entree selection was a pan seared cod perfectly cooked with a saffron mash potato purée and herb sauce that complimented the dish perfectly. The purée gave me a small kick of heat but not over bearing. Calle Ocho might be my favorite spot for a while. My only issue with Calle Ocho is its pricing. A bit on the high side.

I always like to order the vaca frita - it's a Cuban skirt steak with pork fried rice, avocado and fried eggs. The ambiance of the place is amazing! It's classy and decorated to feel like you are having a dinner in a Latin American country. Romantic enough to bring a date. I have been here numerous times for brunch and always left tipsy with a big smile on my face. Any restaurant that plays salsa, merengue, reggaeton or bachata music in the background while giving you an unlimited amount of refills of sangria and has good food is 5 stars in my book! Always make sure you also get the bread and mini muffins with the cream cheese/cinnamon dipping sauce. They give it free as an appetizer to all of the guests.

2.0,2/17/2015,"I would have liked to give this restaurant 5 stars but it's really didn't stand up to my expectations. Pro's - We arrived at 6 pm & was seated even tho we had a 5 pm reservation. Restaurants decor was nice and the staff was nice. Con's - The restaurant tables were wayyyy to close to each other. This really did disappoint me, the host literally pulled the table out just so I can squeeze by to my seat (as did every couple that was seated next to us). It was very uncomfortable to sit in this place & have a decent meal when your literally almost touching the next couple beside us. I couldn't even go to the restroom without having to push the table forward & have my ass all up on someone else table just to squeeze out (mind u I'm only 120lb). Another disappointment was our food:( ugh I was so hoping this food would make me want to spend $300 again and again and again but it wasn't worth $6 that u get from a regular spanish buffet. The entree was horrible.I ordered chicken stuffed with plantain, potatoes and some kind of sauce. I was really expecting something delicious but it turned out all wrong in every way. My chicken was dry, tasteless no seasoning nada, the stuffing with was suppose to be made out of plantains was bland and tasted old and I was hoping for mash potatoes but got some home fries instead or what seemed to be home fries that you get from the diner at 3am after a hard night of partying... Just dry burnt and just awful. :( I don't mean to throw another restaurant in the mix of this review but I guess my exceptions were because Mamajuanna has a similar dish but taste delicious!!

5.0,2/12/2015,"I recently hosted a bridal shower at Calle Ocho and was beyond impressed by management beforehand, service throughout and the quality of the food. This being the first party I have hosted at a restaurant in Manhattan, I did not know what to expect, but Calle Ocho definitely set the bar high! Not only was the food and service incredible, but it was so reasonably priced for an unlimited sangria brunch with a private room. We had the private room in the back and it comfortably fit our party of about 30 people. The shower was scheduled at to last 2.5 hours including unlimited sangria and a three course menu that I was able to choose beforehand; however, after about an hour of the shower, a server came up to me and told me we could extend our party another hour/hour and a half if needed. Not only did they continue to serve sangria throughout the extra hour and a half, but they continued to be friendly and interact with the guests. Several people even tipped the servers on their own because they were so accommodating!Due to weather, we were nervous about the turnout based on the headcount we had to provide 48 hours ahead of time, but management was extremely flexible with this and allowed us to manipulate the number if needed. Our party was scheduled to start at 11:30AM, but the workers at the restaurant allowed us to come into the private room before the restaurant even opened to start setting up for the shower.I would highly suggest looking into Calle Ocho for any private parties!",3,0,0,Alyssa L.,"New York, NY",0,1,0
3.0,2/10/2015,"Been here for brunch twice.  Had a great experience the first time, not so much the second.  The first time I went was on a Sunday about two and a half years ago.  The deal is still pretty much the same... Various brunch options (not a fixed deal) paired with bottomless sangria in multiple flavors.  My disappointment now, though, is when I went two days ago, unbeknownst to my friend and me, they're now imposing a 1-hr time limit.  That's really intrusive on a day that's supposed to be a fun, boozy brunch day.  And most restaurants with time limits allow at least an hour and a half to two hours.  Those restaurants usually print that caveat on the menu too.  I think that's a pretty major fail on Calle Ocho's part.  My friend and I were sort of rushed along to inhale our meals, and we were only allowed two sangrias a piece.  :: THUMBS DOWN!!! :: I'd rather save myself the trip down there and just go to Silhouette in the Bronx where they strongly recommend you make reservations, and you get to enjoy a 3-course meal with bottomless cocktails for four hours for about $42.",1,0,0,Christina D.,"Bronxville, NY",148,25,17

Decor: intimate, dimly lit but at the same time festive (good for a date or a dinner party with friends).Food: selections sounded unique and mouth-watering, our orders were served quickly.-Braised Pork Shank (Lecho)- tender, juicy, but the chef was heavy handed on that salt (Those with hypertension avoid this one so you don't stroke out)*The paiz (corn soup) that was swimming around the pork was amazing.- Sweet Plaintain and chicken dish (Pollo Peruano) was very similar to Mofongo--which I love.  Chicken was a tad dry but everything else from the sausage/peppers and the sweet plantains were the MVPs of the dish.Drinks: 5 Stars-Pom Collin's (Gin) *disclaimer* I'm not a big gin drinker but I wanted to try something different and I got to say this drink blew me away (taste wise and off the sober meter)--made very strong. Favorite part of my meal.-Passion Fruit Mojito- nice, sweet, but strong. Also well-made.Food--3 stars--nothing to rave about. Entree prices averaged $25-$30 (meh), portions were big but not $30 worth to me. I didn't mind the drink prices between $11-$13 because the bartender did a great job with the drinks.

I forgot to mention that they gave us pan de queso before our order which were amazing! Our entrees came later. I ordered the salmon which I asked for medium but it was definitely over cooked.

The music was just loud enough, and took me back to high school reggaeton days (I'm only 22 so about 4 years ago), the sangrias took me back a few months to my senior year in college (I had the Blanca, Tropical & Havana Banana sangrias, each better than the last), and the overall atmosphere allowed me to remain my young yet sophisticated self lol. I had the ropa vieja con huevos & it was magnificent; Steak seasoned, onions grilled & eggs fried to the T.  And the fact that the drinks came free with brunch had me praising the hell out of this place (yes, a contradictory joke lol). To top things off, sangrias are only free as long as there's still food on the table, however, our Cuban waiter hooked us up with supplemental mixed tequila drinks after we already paid the tab (maybe because I left a bomb tip)! But all in all, our bill came up to $47, with two entrees, a side of plátanos, & 6 drinks! Cmon, it doesn't get any better. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they seemed slightly understaffed, so we had to venture out to a different waiter once or twice for service.

4.0,1/21/2015,"First off, this place is HUGE.  It is tucked away in the Excelsior hotel, huge plus.  The restaurant is nicely decorated.  The staff greeting us right away and had a table waiting for us.  First, the décor:I agree with one of the other reviewers that although the décor is nice, it has no soul.  It almost feels like, ""this is what a Cuban place is supposed to look like"", and does not feel homely which is what I love about South American restaurants.  The seating was comfortable, you were not sitting on the table next to you, and in Manhattan, those points are certainly upsides.Next, the drinks.  We decided to go with cocktails, she got the mojito and I went with the caprainha (spelling?).  Both were delicious and can imagine that you can't go wrong with any drink you order here.Now, let's get down to what we all care most about, the food.  We started with the pulpo.  Overall, not a bad dish flavor wise, but the portion was a bit too small. I live in Astoria where Octopus is a staple and as such I am used to a good portion of it.  Calle Ocho's portion left much to be desired.For dinner, she got the vaca fritta and I got the bistec.  Hands down, mine was the better dish.  The chimichurri was perfectly seasoned and really brought the steak to life.  The vaca fritta, again, left a bit to be desired.  It was a bit bland, but certainly not ""bad"".  The latin fried rice that came with the vaca fritta was very tasty and a good pairing with the steak.  With my steak, I got yucca fritta.  Can't really go wrong with that in my book!!!We opted to pass on dessert. Overall, I think this place has a lot of potential.  I would like to go back and try some of the other dishes. The flavors are all there, but some need to be brought of a bit more, such as the vaca fritta.  We went at 8pm on a Saturday and I did not find the noise level to be an issue.  Good for a date night or a get together with a group of friends.",3,1,0,Leslie C.,"ASTORIA, NY",231,148,30

4.0,1/15/2015,"I've heard they have amazing brunch, but I made a Saturday dinner reservation for 10 for my mom's 60th birthday.  (I made it about a month in advance since her birthday is right around NYE.)Service: Everyone that I spoke to on the phone was very warm and accommodating. Even at the restaurant, waiting service was great. Constantly refreshing water and those amazing PAN DE QUESO. Food: A little pricey, but it's a nice place and amount of food is worth it. The only thing a little skimping was the octopus for appetizer. Octopus usually is, but it still felt a little paltry. A bunch of us ordered the steak, ropa vieja, fish and paella. Everything came out wonderful- steak not  tough and the egg and avocado was a great touch. Fish and seafood were tender. A lot of mojitos and sangria went around as well, and they did the job. =)Atmosphere: Definitely one of those places that has a darker lighting. It's also loud and rambunctious, as per Latino guidelines. Music was great. We loved the energy since it was a birthday celebration. Just our style. Great for groups. If you want a more reserved, Cuban spot with good light for food photos or even reading the menu, maybe not the place.

We ordered vaca frita, salmon, calamari, side of sweet/green plantains, and coconut creme brulee (crema catalana). All the food was hot and fresh. Portions are very generous. Left feeling like I had a food baby PLUS there were leftovers for breakfast. Everything was good. I will say, that the calamari comes in a very unique batter reminiscent of Korean fried chicken. It was a thick batter, covered in a soy sauce, ginger dressing topped with a sprout salad. It's the best calamari I've EVER, EVER, EVER had, and trust me, I'm a true calamari conoisseur.Service is great...anything you order will be excellent.

The complimentary bread basket comes out with piping hot, baked in-house little rolls that are crusty, pillowy, chewy and addicting. For starters, the Picada which is a selection of the chef's 5 favorite appetizers was outstanding!!! No, they did NOT pick the inexpensive appetizers to serve, they brought out arepa, calamari frito, battles, empanda, pulpo a la plancha. This sampler was actually enough food for dinner along with our mojitos!! But we ordered entrees: paella which was very good and the Bistec which turned out to be a large NY strip steak - I wouldn't order this again because it wasn't anything special.

4.0,1/7/2015,"So I wanted to dress up like Pitbull and be *that* person at brunch. Ha. Needless to say I chickened out. We went for Sunday brunch and since my friends are notoriously last-minute or *spontaneous* as they like to call it, we didn't have reservations. We pretty easily got a couple seats in the lounge area. The problem with that area is that, to my knowledge, there is only ONE server for that area. So every time he came over, each table attacked him to get the one thing that kept getting forgotten. Pros: -Food was surprisingly delicious! I'm always wary of drunch locations but the hash was DELISH-Decor is quite nice and the dining area is quite large! -Really on-point Sangria! I tried two reds and a white and all were good. Would go with the white again.Cons:-The plates are HUGE and don't fit on the tiny tables. It was a constant balancing act that got old real quick.-It took 15 minutes to get our drink once ordered. I know it's busy but it even took 15 minutes and asking 3 bus boys later to get our WATER. I'll be back with a reservation at table.

I do recommend the chicharron, (it's shrimp) it surpassed my expectations! We did not have to wait very long for our main course to come out. The one tiny complaint I'll have is that we asked for the steak to be well done, by the looks of it, it was probably a medium.

Pro-tip from her, even if you don't have a reservation, come in at 1:30 or later and you will likely be seated, or asked to wait only a bit. They purposefully don't book every table with a reservation.The place is huge and beautiful. Often booze brunches are held in places that aren't great and can devolve into drunken rowdiness but everyone was holding themselves together nicely.Onto the food and drink. 8 different types of sangria, most were excellent. I recommend the Spanish Harlem. Our waitress was super quick getting us additional drinks, and was nice enough to make suggestions. Food was very solid. Everything came out hot and was well prepared.

4.0,1/6/2015,"Hands down, best bang for your buck for a boozy brunch in NYC. Time and time again, this place pleases my friends and I for our group brunch.They only take weekend brunch reservations for a 12 o'clock seating or a 2 o'clock seating to limit boozy brunch-comers to 2 hours. It's enough time, especially with the staff being ON POINT with their service. You must make a reservation far in advance. I'm talking 3 weeks to a month. Typically my girls and I will make a reservation while we are there for the next outing. It works wonderfully. The place is always packed! From the moment you are seated, the attentive staff will get you a glass of sangria from the many choices. I've probably tried about 3/4 of them and they are all good! One of my other favorite parts about Calle Ocho is the bread basket! Yum!! The bread is always warm and the delicious strawberry butter is amazing. As for the entrees, many are delicious. I wish there were more options, or that they rotated the menu seasonally so that I wouldn't always order my favorite dish, the torte de pollo. Food comes out very quickly, so eat slow and keep on boozin'! 4 or 5 glasses of sangria later, we all leave happy, full and quite drunk. It's easy to get a lot of drinks during your visit, even with the crazy rule that you can only have one glass of sangria at a time. If you have some left, better chug it before the waiter comes back, because they will take it away!**I'd recommend the later seating, at 2PM, because they likely let you stay later than 4 and you can get an extra glass and finish it in the bar area!

My friend ordered pan seared salmon and lobster mash potatoes which tasted like it was made for someone in a nursing home....bland as hell.

3.0,12/15/2014,"It goes without saying that the Bottomless Brunch has essentially become synonymous with New York City, and no where else is more renowned for it than Calle Ocho. This Upper West Side restaurant is housed in the Excelsior Hotel, and despite having multiple dining areas, is easily booked out over a month in advance for weekend brunch. I attempted to plan a brunch with three other friends and literally had to make it for a day over a month and a half in advance; the lesson here is to come prepared.On the day of, we all arrived promptly and were shown to our table. While Calle Ocho used to let guests serve themselves Sangria, this procedure has now been swapped with having the server take drink orders one at a time. I opted for the Punta Cana, a white sangria with mamajuana and diced peaches, oranges, and pineapples. I have to say that I was pretty disappointed by it; the quality of alcohol was clearly lacking and there were very few pieces of fruit to be found in the glass. Thankfully, we were able to dig in their generous bread basket while we waited for our entrees to arrive.It took a considerable amount of time before we received our plates, but I'd opted for the Vaca Frita, which was presented (for some reason) on a rectangular plate. The main protein, the Cuban Skirt Steak, was slightly overcooked beyond the medium I'd requested, but was seasoned well and had a good chew to it. On the other side of the plate, the Pork Fried Rice was served with two fried eggs and a few slices of avocado. The rice was very tasty, with crisp cubes of pork interspersed in the yellow rice, and even better with the fried eggs, which still had a soft yolk, and the avocado. Dessert was also satisfactory, as the flan and the sorbet trio we ordered were much-needed counters to the savory mains we had earlier. Note that the Passionfruit sorbet was far too acidic, even for my tastes... And I usually enjoy the additional punch of citrus or vinegar in my food.It's hard for me, someone who can't really handle alcohol, to give what I think is a fair assessment of Calle Ocho, but I found the drinks underwhelming and the food to be slightly above average, although most certainly overpriced. Service is also on the slower end during weekends as well, given the number of customers and orders that they have to handle, but if you're looking for a boozy brunch and have plenty of time in the afternoon, Calle Ocho might be just the spot for you.",10,6,8,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

So large, this place I'm sure automatically lends itself perfect for parties and large groups. I wasn't drinking that evening, but they had a fantastic cocktail list. The food was surprisingly really good. I don't know why my expectations were so low, but I ended up pretty impressed.First of all the ceviche was was wonderful. I was with a group of 5 so we decided to split the sampler which we selected ourself.* Each one was great and although I could have eaten 100% more, it was a pretty nice portion for the price. The Cuban/Brazilian bread basket was phenomenal; I can only imagine the calorie count on those little balls of carby heaven.I ended up going with an app as I wasn't the hungriest and it was pretty damn filling and large although I think I'd forgo it and just get an entree. With that, the arepa topped with ropa vieja was delicious. A small corn cake, but quite a bit of delicious shredded beef topped with some crunch salad and a touch of creme was a great little meal. For $14, not quite sure it was a bargain, but definitely a nice small plate perfect for one.Overall the service was attentive, the mood was upbeat and the food was good all at a pretty reasonable price for Manhattan dining.

NOTE: be careful with open table here, our reservation got cancelled in the system but the woman who worked there was kind enough to honor our confirmation email and put us back in the system for an earlier time (which is what we wanted!) The place gets very crowded but they have 2 rounds for brunch. The first one goes until about 2 and the second until 330 (but they let you stay until past 4 which is good).The staff is pretty good although you can tell one person has a lot of tables but that just slows down how fast you can get your next sangria (which is probably a good thing) - there are some rules with the unlimited sangria including you must finish your first one before the second one comes, you can only have the sangria as long as you have food on the table, etc. So I have tried all of the sangrias- I suggest if you go with a friend you share all the 8 flavors (4 red and 4 white) because there is no way to go through all 8 in 1 sitting because (1) you don't have enough time and (2) you'd be completely zonked and would have to crawl home.FOOD: you get this bread basket in the beginning which has an array of different types of sweet treats. My favorite is the one that looks like a normal piece of bread but is actually very sweet (you'll know which one it is when you go there). For my main meal I ordered Rope Viejas con Huevos which is Hash, Fried Egg, Avocado, Crispy Sweet Potatoes. Unfortunately for the rules of sangria but fortunately for my belly/liver, the food came out REALLY FAST. I usually am a speed eater, but decided to start trying to eat slower (you know... because it's healthier-had nothing to do with the sangria rules). But it was difficult because it was so good! So I tried to keep my animal instincts from taking over - between every bite I would have to compose myself and take a sip of sangria. With all of that we also had dessert. The flan and a chocolate cake. My altered mind almost cried of how delish it was. Bathroom: very clean, but there are only 3 woman's toilets which there is always a wait at least 3 people deep for.Tl; dr: this place is really good!

Story: First off I had to make this reservation over a month and a half in advance - literally nothing was available on opentable - crazy! But I can see why it's such a great deal for the quality and atmosphere. Unlimited free sangria of your choice with the purchase of an entree amazing! Ropa Vieja meat was moist but not drowning in liquid which I often find and egg was cooked to perfection (runny yolk) - portion was just the right amount of food to soak up some of the sangria. Both sangrias I had were delicious but the Havana banana wasn't banana-y enough for me. Love this place will definitely be back,0,0,0,Mary M.,"Manhattan, NY",78,165,4

The sangrias, without a doubt, pack a punch. There were about 6-8 selections of both red and white sangrias and the ones I had did not let me down. As for the food, I got the ropa vieja con huevos and it was enjoyable but I definitely prefer the traditional ropa vieja. My friend got the vaca fritas and she loved it. I had a bite of the rice and it was so flavorful. My only qualm is that the service was a little slow. Our waiter looked completely swamped and kept forgetting our drink orders.

4.0,11/10/2014,"*Review is solely for Brunch. I went here with my girlfriend and another couple on a Sunday afternoon around 2:15p.m. I'm told that it is impossible to get a reservation at this place; however, after about 3:30p.m. the place was empty. If you want to go on a Sunday, I'm sure you could walk in any time after 3 and still get a table. The restaurant inside was HUGE I didn't expect the place to wrap around the entire lobby of the hotel. The tables were spacious and allowed enough room to breath, we weren't stacked ontop of another table so it was nice to have some privacy. There are rolls and muffins served complimentary when you arrive. They come with a delicious strawberry butter. We quickly devoured the muffins and asked for more. The server was very friendly and brought back out a number of additional ones which was awesome! Sangria is complimentary as long as you're still eating. They were pretty friendly about their policy- we were able to get three drinks in each in our 1.5 hour stay. There were a number of flavors to choose from and the few I tried were all very tasty. I am not sure that there is a ton of alcohol in each, but for their price (0$) I was super satisfied. For brunch I ordered the Latin Benedict. This was very delicious- the homemade sausage patties were very juicy and flavorful and the eggs and sauce were spot on. The corn base under the sausage added an interesting dynamic as well. The meal was a little bit on the small side; however, with the free muffins and rolls, I was satisfied when I completed my meal. All said and done, we got out of there with 3 drinks each, a number of rolls and muffins, and a brunch meal for ~ 25$ each. I think that is a fantastic steel especially for the quality of everything and the location/atmosphere. Even though I didn't think the food taste or portions stood out among other brunch locations, I would still choose this restaurant over many other options for the quality to cost value that you get when coming here. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in a sangria mood.",7,1,3,Mike D.,"Baltimore, MD",98,187,1566

I also had a Fresa sangria and I have to say that even though it tasted a bit watered down, I certainly felt buzzed halfway through my drink (that also could have been from the fact that I had no meals at all that day). Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and the surprise strawberry in the drink. Kind of felt like the treat in cereal boxes, haha!

I ordered something like a steak and eggs (I don't fully remember). Along with that they give you warmed up bread which is to die for.

3.0,10/5/2014,"Perhaps my expectations were inflated. I've had friends rave that this is the be-all end-all place to get brunch, especially given the AYCD aspect of it. That being said, there were various pros and cons to my experience here. Located inside of the opulent Excelsior Hotel, a luxurious lobby is the entrance to this bustling restaurant, the bar area filled with those already enjoying their meals and third sangrias. Sure enough, upon being seated, we were presented with the menus; it came complete with just short of a dozen types of sangria and some hilarious tongue in cheek ""House Rules"" for drinking them. I ordered two for myself in the course of brunch and was able to sample those of my three other friends. I went for the Spanish Harlem, a red sangria with dark rum and warm notes of cinnamon. It was delicious and would certainly make for a great cooler weather sangria. I also ordered the Havana Banana as well, a white sangria with lychees, coconut, banana (supposedly), and some coconut rum. It was good, though I am definitely a fan of red sangrias more. I also tried sips of two other white sangrias: The Tropical and Punta Cana. They were tasty, but nothing I'd order on my own. As for our meals, and friend and I split two plates amongst us, and I'm glad we did. I ordered the Torta de Pollo and she ordered the Vaca Frita. I was not exactly impressed with the former. We both agreed that the chicken was very dry. I found the sandwich itself to be poorly assembled and bordering on room temperature. The Vaca Frita was in an entirely different ballpark. The steak was thin yet extremely tender. The flavor shined. The Latin Pork Fried Rice was great (even if I couldn't find any pork in it), and the accompanying tomato, onion, and cilantro dressings provided a fresh burst with every few bites. I had a bite of the Ropa Vieja con Huevos, and that was great as well. The shredded meat just swam in its own magnificent and flavorful thick gravy. Also on a low note was the Calle Ocho Omelet that another friend ordered. Once again, the presentation was poorly executed and there really wasn't much to the plate. While the rest of us seemed to have various sides, she just had a very sad looking omelet with some home fries slapped on her dish that seemed to be plated as an afterthought. She told me she was less than impressed. Dessert was also hit or miss. The flan with mango was creamy and sweet. The sorbets provided many different flavor notes, with the passion fruit adding a shockingly sour taste to our mouths. While the guava and coconut ginger scoops were great, we had to let the scoop of passion fruit melt into a sad little puddle; none of us could stand to eat it. I'm glad that I went, and, honestly, you can't beat the AYCD deal here. Depending on what you order, you'll be spending about $19 - $25 a person for a bread basket, strawberry butter, a full meal, and a good few glasses of sangria. You'll get a great bang for your buck in that regard! Still, I'm going very back and forth on the meals. Is a great AYCD deal worth hit or miss food? (A question for the ages, truly.) Well, if I came back again, I'd know what and what not to order, at least. Torta? No. Vaca Frita? Yes ma'am. Spanish Harlem Sangria? ALL of it, please!",4,0,1,Allison C.,"New York, NY",215,1638,450

It's got a casual feel to it, but it's not your hometown home style super authentic Spanish food. It's american breakfast with a Spanish twist. The omelette is okay, the salmon over eggs and arepa is also okay. Nothing amazing about these dishes. The arepa became soggy after being underneath the eggs. Lemon caper sauce um... Didn't taste like the description.  Salmon was not super quality but good enough for a hungry person. The ropa vieja was the best dish I tried.  Everything just went well together and there was character to the dish- there was the pulled pork, and then the delicious guac, and that crispy curly things on top. Mm! This is the dish I would get if I were to return. All the dishes range about 19-26$ but includes endless sangria. It's one class at a time, there's 8 types (4 white and 4 reds).

This is not the boozy brunch you should   be vomiting at, go to PS450 if you need to rage that hard on a Sunday.Overall it was a solid meal, worth going once.

While the unlimited sangria is such an amazing attraction, once we got there, my friends didn't, or rather couldn't, go crazy like they'd hoped.

5.0,9/1/2014,"Two words: UNLIMITED SANGRIADo I even need to continue this review? We walked into Calle Ocho a little after 2pm on a Sunday. After reading a few reviews and tips, I was afraid we wouldn't get seated for brunch. Like everybody said, it's crazy in here. Don't expect to sit in the dining area unless you made reservations. Luckily, there was comfortable seating available for us in the lounge. We had our own personal waiter and he was very attentive. He checked in on us every 10 minutes and made sure our glasses never went unfilled. I really wanted to remember his name, but after my second glass I just knew that wasn't going to happen. The sangria here is awesome, actually some of the best (and strongest) I've had. I ordered the Havana Banana, Punta Cana and Tropical- in that order. But I tried the Spanish Harlem, Fresas and Roja- in that order. Hey, it's unlimited people. Don't judge.Oh snap, I was so sangria happy I almost forgot about the food. We ordered the Gallitos for two and it definitely hit the spot. I strongly suggest this if you're looking for a light but fulfilling meal. But people, that complimentary bread was a WINNER! I asked our waiter for details, he told us how it was made and the country it was from.

5.0,8/28/2014,"This is a great brunch spot!  My annual divas group met there for brunch and we all left very happy.The restaurant has a light, airy feel to it and coupled with the latin music that was playing it took my back to being on an island.  The only downside is the acoustics in the restaurant is not that great and since it was crowded you found yourself screaming in order to be heard.I like the fact they offer different sangrias to drink that accompany your meal.  Although I stuck with the first one I tried (Fresas), the rest of my group enjoyed the ones that they ordered as well.  Next time I have to drink a little faster so I can try other ones.Most of the table ordered the Vaca Frita which is skirt steak that came with fried rice, eggs and avocado.  This dish comes with alot of food so I tried some of it and it was absolutely delicious - the steak was tender and well seasoned and I love avocado any type of way so that dish was a hit with me.I had to be the odd man out and order Arepa Con Salmon, which was smoked salmon on a corn cake with eggs and a lemon caper cream.  The salmon was tasty and the cream on top was the perfect accompaniment with it.We were all stuffed so we didn't have dessert, but this is definitely one of my ""go to"" places for brunch - I will definitely be back!",0,0,0,Kim O.,"Yonkers, NY",67,190,2

4.0,8/21/2014,"Reserved for dinner at Calle Ocho, Monday night 7:15 PM group of 6 people: I was pleasantly surprised. I heard great things about the brunch but not too much about the dinner (so I was a little worried). But the food was good! I got a free glass of sangria because of my check-in with yelp. At night, the ambiance was nice and dark... and not too loud because not many people were there. This may or may not bother some people.Anyways, the starter bread was great! I don't really know how to describe the texture nor the taste... It was a little sweet? Texture was like bread on the outside but mochi-like in the inside (a little more bite to it)? If my description is turning you off OR confusing you, then ignore me and just eat it. It was good (especially with the black bean dip).We ordered the following for a party of 6 people:DrinksTropical White Sangria - Yum!Mojitos - my sisters ordered their $5 monday mojitos. For those who like stronger drinks, get this.Appetizers- Ceviche Mixto - I'm not a big fan of ceviche and the portion was tiny so I didn't try much of it but there were no complaints.- Pulpo a la Plancha - another small portion (obviously because it's an appetizer) but this was good!- Calamari Frito - I enjoyed this appetizer the most! It was glazed and had a sweeter taste to it than your usual calamari. Main Dishes- Paella (Seafood) - this is the dish I was most worried about but I enjoyed the most, The rice was cooked nicely and there was a looot of seafood on top. It came out very hot and yummy!- Lubina (Grilled Sea Bass) - was on a bed of quinoa... this had a lighter taste to it but it wasn't my favorite.- Bistec (Cuban Style Steak Frites) - Steak was steak... lacked just a tad bit of salt but it was good. - Costillas (Glazed Pork Ribs) - didn't get to try this one but everyone seemed happy about this dish!... and yes, we were extremely full after our meal and had left overs to take home with us. We must've spent hours there but didn't feel rushed at all.

4.0,8/19/2014,"This was one of my favorite brunch places during college and the wait to get a reservation used to be absolutely crazy. Last time I went for brunch was about 2 years ago, and last night I went again for dinner. Dinner at Calle Ocho has a completely different feel than the lively brunches I remember. Dinner is intimate and surprisingly empty (almost too empty), but the food is just as if not better. The starter is a bread basket of cheesy bread with black bean sauce - it's pretty good, but a little sweet for me. I had the sea bass & the Havana Banana sangria (rum with lychee and coconut and banana flavor - yum!) The sea bass came on a plate of red quinoa with fennel, tomatoes, and capers, and it was done really, really well.

Since GF is more of a big deal now, they're more upfront about being so gluten free friendly (it shows up on Find Me Gluten Free, for example), so that's no secret. Almost everything on the menu is gluten free (except the fried food). My favorite of all-time is the Vaca Frita Al Caballo: that pork fried rice is *special* and the way the egg and avocado plays with the steak is other-worldly.

We had ordered the skirt steak which was very dry and bland. Also ordered the paella. Majority of the table ordered the paella to see how tasty it would be. The rice was very mushy and rissotto like. The lobster served on the paella looked and tasted like its been frozen and defrosted. Looked really soggy. I'm not sure if it was just that day or it usually just tastes that way. For appetizers we ordered the camarones. This wasnt so bad. It was three jumbo shrimps on top of two onion rings on a small smear of avocado. Had two pitchers of the sangria since we were a large group. It didn't taste fresh. Tasted like it was premade and just poured into the pitchers.

We got another sangria and throughout the whole meal the wait staff was attentive but not rushing us. By the time we left the place was insanely busy and loud. really loud. There are two girls bathrooms and one boys bathroom. I'm 25 but there were for sure a lot of early 20 somethings there to get tanked.

3.0,8/7/2014,"Something different on the UWS. Calle Ocho is a far more festive atmosphere in comparison to many of the other restaurant choices in this area. The space is so large, open and bright, one might think they were in Tribeca. Though the air temperature was way too low, it is understood that the body heats up after a few rounds at the complimentary Sangria bar. They have so many different varieties of Sangria, you don't know where to begin. Though I found the Mojito Sangria to be my favorite. The food was authentic and fun for the palette. From the beet salad with it's bright cleansing taste to black bean butter with its rich creaminess, this is something a little unique.

2.0,8/3/2014,"Went there before catching a performance of King Lear at Central Park with my wife. Having been there years ago at their old location, I expected good food and good service. It just happened to be Restaurant Week so it was also a good deal.Their bread, as I remembered was excellent! Ordered second helping of bread. And the Camarone appetizer was also very good. I asked if they could make their Ropa Vieja appetizer into an entree and they obliged without a problem. And then the entrees came. Wife opted for the Restaurant Wee pre-fixe menu and ordered some pork. It came out somewhat bland and slightly overcooked. The black bean that the meat was served on top of was very dense and mushy with consistency of mashed potatoes. I could tell that it had been cooked all day and you could no longer tell any hint of individual beans at all. Meat was kind of rubbery as pork tends to become when over-cooked. My beef stew was just way too salty. It also had signs of being cooked too long and was void of any liquid. Ropa Vieja is supposed to be cooked with some root vegetables like carrots and potatoes and usually come in lovely braising liquids and their version was just cooked too long and became very salty probably because it has been left heating in the pan evaporating all of its juices. My wife ate two bites of the pork and did not touch the rest. I managed to finish more than half of my entree with help of a lot of water due to saltiness. The dessert was ok but nothing special either.I know during Restaurant Weeks, places only serve a few pre-chosen items and prepare them in large quantities. But that doesn't mean that the quality should suffer. We walked away feeling that we paid too much for the quality of food. I felt that the place has gone down hill since they've moved to the new location which is a shame. Many restaurants are great in the beginning and keep their food quality control tight. After almost 20 years of being opened, this place has earned its place in the UWS, but I can't help thinking that they need to revisit their commitment to excellence as they were when they first opened..",1,0,0,Rick K.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",28,7,0

Overall I'd grade the steak at a B. The steak was accompanied by steak-cut yucca fries. I was expecting it to be a delightful surprise but instead it was bland, dry and flavorless. I also decided to try their sangria. It tasted pretty horrible, as if it had been sitting in a jug for days. I barely drank the glass I ordered which is a first.

The bread basket is an amazing stand-out, but other than that, do not expect all that much from the food. It's not bad by any means, but it is entirely forgettable (especially with all the sangria you'll be drinking). I feel they do a better job with meat and starch dishes like steak and eggs or ropa vieja than they do with, say, their Latin Benedict, which didn't seem very fresh.But, c'mon. Free sangria.

Had this pollo dish with a tortilla, beans, eggs and avocado. It was good...not too spicy. Every component on the dish was delicious and went well together. Also must I forget...the sangria was endless and there was like 5+ different choices. Good luck trying to get all of em to try. I stopped at 4...lol.

2.0,7/13/2014,"I've spent the better part of two years being extremely envious of my friends' brunch dates at Calle Ocho... I finally make a reservation and it ends up being one of the worst meals I've had in New York City. Friends and I arrived at 12PM and were seated immediately--service started out very friendly and attentive. We got our bread basket quickly, a great variety of warm rolls with a berry flavored butter which ended up being the highlight of my experience. We ordered a selection of sangrias, most of which were quite tasty, then it was all downhill from there. I ordered the shrimp and bacon grits dish that came with two poached eggs drenched in an oily chipotle hollandaise sauce. This by far was one of the most off-putting dishes I've ever consumed a single bite of. If you read through any of my previous reviews you'd learn that I've never once left my food unloved but this was a special situation. The aroma coming off the plate was something like weird, spicy hot dogs. The shrimp and bacon seemed of a mediocre quality and the flavor of the dish was very obscure and really spicy. To add insult to food injury, the eggs had a bizarre, chewy texture on their exterior that made them inedible. I decided to abandon it altogether for the side of home fries I ordered which I then realized arrived freezing cold. I thought maybe that's how they were prepared but a few at the bottom of the dish were luke warm. My friends ordered the steak dish as well their classic benedict offering and both felt that it was passable but not enjoyable. The sausage under the poached eggs was overcooked as was the steak. Their Latin rice was okay but had a bit too much smoke for my personal taste. If I regret anything it's not selecting the salmon eggs in a corn crepe that passed us by several times and looked delectable. By the end of our meal it was impossible to get the check, even after it took us 20 minutes to flag down the waiter. I know that this place has tons of reviews saying otherwise but my point is DON'T come for the food. Sangria is fantastic... All I can hope is that I saved one person from smelling spicy, stinky hot dogs.",0,0,0,Nina L.,"New York, NY",565,731,189

My party tried the Latin Benedict, Ropa Vieja con Huevos (my friend had the original, which is VERY meaty, and I'm vegetarian so they kindly swapped in yummy beans for the beef), and the Tortilla Espanola. Everything was quite good and very big portions. And let's not forget the sangria. Unlimited sangria while you eat is a great deal. On top of that, our waitress was great. She started serving us sangria as soon as we sat down and was always around to refill as soon as she saw an empty glass like a sangria fairy.The biggest downside - some of the patrons really went way overboard and could not hold their liquor. During the time we were there, we saw more than one person ran to the bathroom to throw up. Not the restaurant's fault, technically, but maybe they need to be a little better about cutting people off, because no one wants to pee in a toilet some drunk chick just threw up in.",1,0,0,Cat S.,"Manhattan, NY",447,371,0

Luckily, I was scanning OpenTable on Friday when I found a Sunday 12:30pm table for 4! Of course I took it since the next available tables were in August.The restaurant is located in the fashionable Excelsior Hotel (close to the B and C trains). They have a strict 15 minute policy for reservations and we almost lost our table since two in our party were running late.The bread basket was steaming hot and pretty delicious, but didn't have as much variety as I expected (only 3 types). I liked the muffin ones the best as they were very buttery. The staff was nice though and got us a second basket, which we appreciated.For my entree, I had the very tasty mushroom paella. I was stuffed from the bread, so didn't finish eating it. I enjoyed the havana banana sangria, although the fresas sangria was too sugary sweet. My friend said she liked the samba better as it was more tart.This is a very noisy place, so I wouldn't try to bring someone you're trying to get to know as it's hard to hold a conversation.

We started with a pitcher of sangria. The price was decent at 33 dollars, you get a lot. However I found it to be average at best and a little watered down. For food I had one of the steak entrees. You get an incredible amount of food here so consider splitting entrees and ordering just a few appetizers to taste more items. The skirt steak was cooked perfectly and was very tender. Sauces worked well together and I loved the cold pickled salad which was a nice contrast. The rice and beans were serviceable. Fried egg was a nice touch, but wish there was a bigger yolk.

4.0,6/16/2014,"I dined at Calle Ocho for the first time this past Sunday, an invitee for a close friend's Baby Shower Brunch.It was Father's Day, so there was a fair amount of diners, but the noise level was reduced to a minimum; it was neither difficult to speak to all 12 guests at our table, nor were we disturbed by the conversation of other guests.As we had reservations, we were seated promptly and were served our first glasses of unlimited Sangria almost immediately. I began with The Samba, which was okay, but I definitely preferred the Havana Banana and Fresas options that I chose throughout the course of my meal. I must say that--by definition--I don't believe that any of these drinks are truly Sangria, but cocktails and not particularly strong ones at that.I had perused the Brunch menu before arriving at the restaurant, so I had an idea of what I planned to order. I had been debating between the Frita Cubana and the Vaca Frita before eventually selecting the former.Suffice it to say that I was not impressed with the meal, unfortunately. The burger has pork, and--as a result--must be cooked well-done. My burger, on the other hand, was over-cooked. The Chimichurri fries also left much to be desired, tasting very much like your every-day chain restaurant fries as they were covered with only a sprinkle of Chimichurri seasoning. The Chipotle ketchup just tasted like...well, ketchup. The guest of honour, who also ordered the Frita Cubana, shared my sentiments.About halfway into my meal, I regretted not ordering the Vaca Frita, but the only thing worse than an over-cooked burger, in my book, is an over-cooked steak. Another guest at the table, on the other hand ordered the Vegetariano and--after being fully convinced that the spoonful she was offering me was completely free of mushrooms--I took a bite which I enjoyed immensely. Should that dish be offered with the option to hold the mushrooms, I would certainly order it for my next visit.Where my meal fell short in taste, the experience was made up for in service. Our waiter was a tremendous delight; very attentive, very cordial, and very swift in action. The ambiance was equally as pleasant, and--during the course of our two-hour meal--I never felt rushed to leave or embarrassed to ask for another drink. After a night of drinking the night before, three sangrias was probably just enough for me anyway.I would certainly recommend Calle Ocho; it is a lovely restaurant within an even lovelier hotel, and it is only a block away from Central Park; what more could you ask for in terms of location?Should I be able to land a reservation, I will re-visit the restaurant for dinner and, perhaps, update my review to include the 5-star rating I think it truly deserves.",8,8,7,C Y.,"New York, NY",46,11,14

There was supposed to be bacon, I don't recall tasting any bacon. The chipotle hollandaise was alright... it could have definitely used more heat. The shrimp were  tiny and a little too chewy for my taste. The grits were good, but it'd be pretty hard to make them poorly. Overall I'm not impressed with the dish -- I was really excited after reading the menu, but the plate was altogether kind of blah. We came for brunch -- complimentary sangria was included. I gotta tell ya though... what they're serving isn't Sangria, it's cocktails. At the very least not any Sangria I've ever had. It was liquor with juice and fruit (cocktail?)...

4.0,5/27/2014,"Did anybody say COMPLIMENTARY unlimited sangria?? YESS its true!! they had 8 different flavors and all are delicious!! Some are stronger than others and some are more light and fruity but I thoroughly enjoyed each one.This place seems to be very popular for brunch as the next available reservation wasn't until July! WOW that's pretty crazy considering how there are soo many other restaurants in nyc that serve brunch but I guess that says something! So if you want to come here, show up right when they open (noon) and grab yourself a seat on their lounge areas. There's two different lounge areas and they are both very cozy with cute lil tables and comfy couches. They filled up pretty quick though, I think by 1pm all of it was full (and you'd imagine people would be sitting here for a while due to the sangria). As soon as we got our menus, our server asked us which sangria we wanted so our group tried a different flavor for each person. I love how there was fresh fruits in our glasses and you can tell that these have been prepared for a while because the flavors meshed very well with each other. The havana banana was probably my ultimate favorite. I loooove lychees and this one had such a strong flavor of it, can't really taste the coconut though. The roja and blanco were pretty good too but they were your basic sangria. Now for food, I got to try a variety of entrees. I can't really remember what all of them are called but I ordered the benedict with pork/beef sausage. YUMM the meat was so flavorful and soft! The egg was perfectly soft on the inside. It could've had a better or more sauce though. I tried the salmon crepes too and this was very interesting. i've had many kinds of crepes but never one with salmon in it! this reminded me of that bagel wiht cream cheese and smoked salmon dish. It was topped with a cream cheese like sauce and it was good. The crepe was soft but firm enough to hold in the salmon and it had a good flavor to it. I also tried the dish with skirt steak topped over rice. The rice was delicious! It was orange-y rice, kinda reminded me of paella but without the extra toppings. The steak was okay, it was flavorful but not super tender. I tried the pork/beef burger too. This was interesting how it didn't come with any tomatoes, lettuce etc but I guess that's how latin americans do it. It tasted pretty good, nothing too special. The fries though, were amazing! they were perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. They had this delicious flavor that almost tasted kinda like MEAT. It wasn't the kind of flavor you'd have from just putting salt over the fries. For dessert, we got the coconut crem brulee and the bread pudding. The coconut crem brulee was good. It was very cool to have that subtle coconut flavor in it and not like the fake coconut flavoring taste. It tasted like they had coconut milk in it or something. The bread pudding was good as well, but it was very small! I've had better sauce at other places though.Overall, this place is very good and worth a visit.

1.0,5/26/2014,"So I went for a bday celebration. The restaurant is located inside a  hotel. Therefore, I don't think they are worried about getting regular or at least repeat customers because they probably have a steady stream of one time hotel guests coming to dine here. It was a Saturday at 8pm and it wasn't that busy. The bar was practically empty and there were some tables in the dining room that were empty. Never a good sign especially for a Saturday during peak hours. When we entered the hostess was super nice and I think he was the manager or owner was extremely professional and accommodating. However, the server for the bar area had an inattentive personality and just did not add anything to the dining experience. The drinks range from okay to down right awful. The original mojito was okay nothing to rave about. However, the banana sangria and the passion fruit mojito were just horrible. Everything tasted as if there was a lime overload. Seriously, I can handle strong drinks, acidic drinks but this was not bearable. I hardly send drinks back but I had to. As we happily left the bar area, we were seated in the dining room. The decor is nice but nothing special.  As for the server in the dining room, he reminded me of a step above a cafeteria server. He seem rushed and just lack the quality that makes a server want customers to keep drinking and eating at a restaurant. More annoying he was there when you didn't need him and no where to be found when you did. I think this place needs an overhaul on how to train their servers to interact with customers. Seriously!  As for the food, it was a hit or miss with most being a miss. The plating was nice but the food didn't taste as good as it looked. We had for apps calamari, arepa, and field greens . The salad was the only app that was enjoyed. As for the entrees we had flat iron steak, Cuban steak, pulled pork, stuffed chicken, and salmon. The beef dishes were awful. The quality of the meat tasted gummy and fatty. A real YUCK. The pulled pork was chewy. Yuck again! The hit was the salmon. Most in our party agreed overall that the entrees were bland. I ate two bites of my food and left it as many in my party did. Overall, the dining experience, service, and food were all a let down.

2.0,5/25/2014,"I had a very bizarre experience with this place. I had been looking forward to trying this out because of the unlimited sangria. I got there with my boyfriend and I went up to the hostess. She ignored me before giving me a look as though I was not worthy to eat there. I was really weirded out that she didn't even greet me, but I just asked for a table for two. Maybe it was a language barrier or something, but she flat out refused to seat me. I stared at her, sort of in disbelief. She just said ""I have nothing for you."" And looked as if she expected me to leave on the spot. I was extremely confused, but asked, ""Uhh, well, is there a wait time?"" Again, she refused to give me any information... without a smile, apology, or any explanation. She just said ""I have nothing for you."" I don't want to make this into a race issue, but my boyfriend is a minority and someone flat out refusing service to an interracial couple in New York City is a pretty moronic move. It'd be different if she had ANY explanation or apologized, but she just refused to seat us with no explanation. When I kept staring at her blankly, she finally said, almost begrudgingly, ""You can sit at the bar if you want."" I just couldn't deal with being treated like a sub-human anymore so I walked away from her and my boyfriend and I immediately found a table in the ""lounge"" area. However, I was legitimately upset/extremely turned off by the way we were treated and it sort of tainted the rest of my experience. Overall, the sangria was tasty but it's weak; took me about three glasses on an empty stomach to get a good buzz on. The food menu was definitely unique and there's something for everyone. My food was quite good and something different for brunch... not your usual eggs/bacon, but a creative menu. Service was efficient if not friendly. However, too offended by the way I was treated at the front desk to feel good about going back, honestly.

1.0,5/2/2014,"First and foremost to get a resorvation at this place you have to do it when you are born I reserved a month and a week in advance. My friends and I went to Calle Ocho on my birthday for brunch on Sunday April 27. What enticed us was about the place was the bottomless sangria yay!! ( They ran out of glasses)That was THE ONLY good part about this place period. This place was packed not surprising due to the reservation timing with that being said you'd think they'd have enough workers and food to serve everyone right? Wrong! There was one waitress covering about 15 tables with parties of 4 or more (my party was of 5) when the waitress finally got to our table what we wanted to order was already out (it was only like 12:30pm) how they manage to run out of food before 1pm no idea. Moving forward we all just changed our orders. Waitress didn't take our menus there were 20 cups on our table keep in mind we are a party of 5(they ran ou of cups for sangria bcuz they were all on our table) . Sweet plantains were way under cooked complained about it got another batch of undercooked plantains. There were so many things on our table there was no room for anything more did they move anything before Putting more items down no, thanks for asking tho. On top of all of this the food was soooo mediocre/ border line BAD it was not worth the month wait it was not worth the terrible experience at all. One of my friends didn't even eat because they brought her a shrimp dish don't remember what it was called but it was WAY over seasoned it was visibly noticeable, we compared it to the same dish one of my guest ordered. I'm not a complainer at a Resturant as such but it came to the point that I HAD to speak to the manager thankfully he seen our table and how despicable it was he totally agreed with me and offered to cover our charge for brunch. Which I was very happy about because that certainly was not a meal worth paying for. I must note it was not the waiters fault for bad and slow service she was nice. It was managements fault with all the tables and amount of people reserved they should have had a staff to guest ratio in place. None of my guest were satisfied, the food was bad, service terrible, only good thing was the bill being covered and the complimentary dessert the manager gave us cuz they know they EFF'd up bad.

Either the portion size was on the smaller side, or it was just that delicious... I can't quite tell. Probably a bit of both.

4.0,4/16/2014,"Don't let the hostess ruin your day! I came to Calle Ocho this past weekend for a Bachelorette Brunch and overall I'd say it was an excellent experience. Getting a reservation can be tough, but I called the Friday before to see if there had been any cancellations and lucky for us, there were! The person I spoke with was great--very nice and helpful. Now onto our arrival....it started out rough. There is apparently an issue with waiting in the hotel lobby so the  hostess wanted to seat us early. Not a problem except that our entire party was there and she said that our 2 hours time slot would start as soon as she sat us. We let her know (very nicely) that if that was the case, we'd rather just wait for our whole group--since our reservation wasn't until 12 (and the restaurant doesn't actually even open until then). Her response could not have been ruder or more unprofessional. It was really astounding. Determined not to let that ruin our special day, we ignored her stink eye and asked to be seated at just before 12 when our group was present. Our meal proceeded famously--the food was good (the omelette and vaca frita seemed to be the favorites), the sangria was excellent (the Spanish Harlem reigns supreme). Our glasses were constantly filled and we sat far longer than our allotted seating time with no issue at all. From the bus staff to the waiters to the manger (whom I spoke with before leaving to let him know how wonderful everything but his hostess was), everyone else we interacted with was great.

The ceviche sampler was a good choice and we were both very satisfied with the bits and pieces of everything. The odd thing here was the popcorn that sat in the center. Why popcorn? It was a space filler so fine... I'll eat the popcorn...Our sangria and meal hit the right spots aka the alcoholic and foodie in us. Their pan de yuca alone left its delicious impression in my heart.

4.0,2/27/2014,"Calle Ocho is a really fun brunch spot on the upper west side with great ambiance and reasonable prices.  You can easily walk out $20 per person, which is a steal given the all you can drink sangria which is included with all meals.  The sangria will flow at whatever pace your table is drinking.  They don't hold back!The food is good, not great by New York standards.  The reason you go here is for the experience.  However, they do have a very fun pan Latin menu.  I ordered the tortilla espanol, which was a good choice that seemed to be a popular one amongst yelpers.Their tortilla espanol is an interesting take on this Spanish classic.  They serve it over a bed of ""pisto"" (spicy stewed papers and onions and tomatoes in a red sauce).  I liked the idea of the dish and thought it was pretty good. The biggest negative was that the tortilla was slightly over-cooked.This place will likely require reservations to get a table, but you can get in at the bar without a reservation if you get there right when they open.  Don't be late though because this place gets crowded for Sunday brunch!",0,0,0,Brandon H.,"Burlingame, CA",5,79,175

4.0,2/18/2014,"In my opinion the best Latin fusion food in Manhattan. I have been a fan since its older days (when it was located down the street). The move into the Excelsior (perhaps also a change in management?) was for the noticeable better. The ambiance is a classic feel of Latino in the city.Everything on the menu is solid, and it all begins with the warm, crustily soft mochi breads they give out to start. Some personal recommendations:calamari: awesomely marinated and fried to an optimal crispy (but yet still chewy!)steak and frites: a mean slab of prime meat and well-complemented steak friespaella: the absolute winner here. a mix of seafoods on spanish rice - my go to most of the time.There's a sangria buffet, too.

Not the best sangria I've ever had, obviously, but there are 8 different types (4 white, 4 red) and it gets the job done. I had the Latin Benedict which was ok, but let's not lie, you don't go to this place for the food. The waiters are pretty good about the drinks and we got a glass both right after sitting down and even after we already paid the bill (and a bunch in between). Definitely ask for some of those little bread things as they are delicious, for some reason they weren't brought to our table automatically. One bad thing about this establishment is that there are very few bathrooms for how much sangria they serve, and lines tend to get long.

Growing up eating Cuban food I would definitely say that this place is Cuban with a twist; it is not traditional Cuban food by any means.

3.0,2/3/2014,"Well it's surprising to say the least that brunch starts at noon and there are no tables. The hostess told me it was a 2 hour wait. She could not get it together to get the words out. She blamed it on her lack of caffeine so maybe if I bring her a cup of coffee next time, we can make arrangements.When you call, the voicemail message says nothing about brunch hours (this is hearsay from a friend who called to try and get us a table.) but the place is indeed open Noon - 3 on Sundays.Anywho, you can eat in the lounge or you can wait for a table in the lounge. The lounge tables are small so if your party is 2 or less this is smart. Otherwise, make a res for another day. The dance of keeping entrees and sangria and bread baskets balanced on the baby tables is not worth it. The waiter checked our coats. I don't know why the hostess didn't offer to take them. There seemed to be about 3 people working the door.Service flaws and responsibilities aside, the food is pretty good for starving yourself til noon. I think the last time I was here (years ago) I also enjoyed the fare and may have also been similarly offended by the $6 (!?!) home fries. Not worth the cost but I felt like I needed them to round out the meal. Potatoes don't cost that much. You're not fooling anyone Calle Ocho. Serve them with your entrees and tack an extra dollar on the cost. I also want to say that sangria as brunch imbibing option is not to be underestimated. It will knock you on your ass. I am loyal to the Blanca. I love it. It's not too sweet. It is just lovely.The bread came after our entrees. I didn't understand that. If I may be so bold as to say you don't need all those different breads. Just fill up the basket with Pan de Queijo. Those little sweet cheesy puff breads are so freaking good.

The waitress was very nice. My friend and I got there after 3 so the kitchens was about to close for lunch. She let is know and we hurried to order. I got the Pollo Ranchero which was good. The sangrias are weak as I've read in other reviews but if u make sure to get 3 or 4 you will be fine. The reds seem to be a bit stronger than the white.

The waiter delivered our food and drinks fairly quick as wellFood- I went for the brunch here. My friend and I ordered the Vaca Frita and Ropa Vieja but they weren't phenomenal. I would say the food wasn't worth the price for something that didnt taste amazing. Also....only the complimentary bread basket they offered when we were seated was delicious. Drinks-My friend and I were  psyched for the unlimited sangria so we tried all the red and white wines on the menu and they weren't as great as people made them out to be. We started with the most recommended sangrias (from Yelp)- Havana Banana (White) and Fresas (Red) which were both pretty strong. Felt like we were drinking straight from the wine bottles ourselves. But since we were already there paying for unlimited drinks and brunch we decided to try everything, thinking other flavors might have been better and they all tasted pretty much the same.

I have a very hard time believing this is the same restaurant.First off, our food arrived about 6 minutes after placing the order. NOTHING takes only 6 minutes to prepare, unless it's not actually being prepared to order. Furthermore, when one of the dishes is paella, then 6 minutes is entirely unacceptable.The ""sweet & green plantains"" were fried plantain chips that were neither sweet or even warm.The Camarones were sweet shrimp on top of a nasty tasting, seemingly asian inspired avocado ""salad."" I love avocado, but this was bordering on disgusting. The Paella tasted like Uncle Ben's rice that seafood was thrown on top of at the end. The rice had no flavor at all from the seafood, no toasted bottom, and THE SEAFOOD WAS COLD. You can't even pretend the seafood was cooked in the rice if it's COLD!The stuffed chicken was acceptable, but it's supposed to come with sausage and I got 1 tiny half inch diameter sliver of sausage.

I've also been here for dinner, but didn't enjoy the menu as much. And predictably, the prices were much higher (considering it is dinner and not bottomless).

I think I ate like 15 of them while I was waiting for my food. The Strawberry butter that it comes with is also delicious- The 8 different types of sangria provide a large variety that you can always come back to and mix-and-match so that you never get tired of their drinks. The two that I tried (one red and one white) were both very delicious- The price (about $23 after tax and tip) is not bad for unlimited drinks and foodCons:- The first glass is this huge monstrosity that takes forever to finish, but the subsequent glasses are all about half that size. It feels like they are ""cheating"" you, know what I mean?- The burger that I ordered with my meal was very dry and tasteless. I think it goes at the top of my list for worst restaurant burger. Will never order it again. DO NOT ORDER.- It's difficult to call over a waiter. It felt like our waiter was avoiding our table. We spent 15 minutes trying to find our waiter to get refills on our sangria. We eventually asked someone else to grab our waiter for us, but either he forgot or ignored us because we flagged our guy down 5 minutes later.Overall it was a so-so experience.

Now they have the waiter serve you, and since service is pretty slow, you are only able to get in like 2-3 drinks.I tried the sangria, one white (coconut and pineapple) and one red (strawberry) and both of them were not that great. The sangrias tasted too much like wine, (cheap wine), and not enough fruit flavoring. As if they didn't really soak the fruit overnight, like they do with most sangria.  I guess you get your money's worth, if the drinks are really strong, but I prefer better tasting sangria.secondly the entrees were pretty decent, my friend ordered the ropa vejia and I ordered the  duck Benedict.

I was excited to finally return six months later with my husband to get my Cuban dinner.Our meal started with delicious little biscuits and some sort of black bean dip. The combination was so tasty that I couldn't stop eating them! Thankfully, I held off on ordering sangria until I checked in via Yelp. Each diner who checks in gets a free glass of Sangria. I selected the Spanish Harlem Roja Sangria. It was delicious and a pretty large glass size, too.We ordered the Dulce appetizer, a corn empanada filled with goat cheese and topped with tomatoes and garlic mojo. Delicioso! For our entree, we shared the Puerco Asado, a large pile of pulled pork over steamed yuca covered in a mojo sauce. The pork had a delicious flavor, and I really enjoyed the yuca as well. We also ordered the Sweet & Green Plantain side. I didn't really enjoy the green plantains, but the sweet ones were good.I really wanted to try a dessert, but I was so full by the end of our meal that I couldn't even think about any more food. The food overall was very tasty, and I would come back again, especially with the tempting free glass of Sangria!",3,0,0,Elizabeth B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",209,819,213
1.0,1/4/2014,"This long-time once cool upper westsider never had great food -- plenty of over-priced ""nouevelle"" takes on traditional Latino dishes that were good enough, with an upbeat environment.  Service was never brilliant.  We live nearby and just revisited Calle Ocho tonite for the first time in several years -- and wish we hadn't.  It's still over-priced for what it is -- but the food is a horror show -- it ranges from insipid to downright awful and between our party we tried 10 dishes -- and couldn't wait to get the check and leave (and we are huge Latin food fans).   Calle Ocho's location in the Hotel Excelsior guarantees it a steady flow of tourists who think they're eating something exotic -- and locals whose palates seem to be conditioned by god only knows what.  AVOID.",1,0,0,Joe S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0

My friends and I had a 2:30 reservation and the moment we were seated out waiter says ""just so you ladies know the kitchen closes in 10 mins"" that set the tone for the next hour. Our waiter wasn't very engaging and it was very clear he just wanted us to be one of those tables that were in and out. He announced last call for us at 4 so we all had to chug our ""bottomless sangria's"" to get the next one. Shortly after that told we would need to move soon so they could prepare for dinner and our table was reserved. We dared not move right away and then someone else told us we needed to move to the bar with the remainder of our drink if we wanted to stay. I can't remember if the food was good or if the drinks were good I just remember being rushed from the moment I sat. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!! I'd heard great things.

5.0,12/29/2013,"I went there on a Wednesday and took my parents out for dinner.  It was a great experience from the start.  First, it wasn't busy at all so I was able to take in the aesthetics of the restaurant.  I usually don't go for dim lighting (I never understood why dim lighting was equated with romance - I hate not be able to see the girl or my food - especially on a first date lol) but it definitely works at Calle Ocho.  There's a classic, ballroom vibe to the place that the dim lighting enhances.  Our server (forgot his name) was incredibly friendly and helpful and patiently answered all of our questions.  As a first time guest, this is all you can ask - that the server make you feel like he/she has been waiting for you to visit their establishment.  I called ahead regarding the volume of the music.  They played Latino music - mostly salsa - but it wasn't obnoxiously loud as I've experienced at many Latino places.  I'm Latino myself, but I can't stand eating with loud music on.  And I KNOW my parents would've hated loud music.  The volume of the music was peripheral and added to the vibe - it didn't MAKE the vibe.  It was perfect.  We had empanadas (very small and not memorable, skip it) and the calamari (really good).  I had a mojito, which was awesome there.  After the server explained the details of all the entrées, we all settled on the Vaca Frita al Caballo, which is Cuban Skirt Steak, Latin Pork Fried Rice, Fried Egg, Avocado for $26.  I convinced both my parents to order the steak medium and it was a success.  The steak was incredibly tasty and juicy and was neither too soft nor too hard when I put the knife to it.  The fried egg is unnecessary and the one slice of avocado is more of a garnish than a part of the meal (we're Latinos - give us an entire avocado!).  After that meal we didn't have any room for dessert but we were ok with that.  I don't know how my experience may have  been on the weekend but on that day, it was incredible.  I can't wait to go back.",1,0,0,Stephen B.,"New York, NY",143,35,45

5.0,12/26/2013,"MY FAVORITE UWS RESTAURANTThis place is always awesome and everything about the food is perfect. The Sangria is delicious and there are probably like 10 varieties. The bread is very unique- I believe a waitress once told me it was made of yucca flour. But soooo delicious.I have had chicken, steak, and fish here and all have been cooked to perfection. The duck was also quite unique, although of everything, perhaps not my favorite. the lobster and grapefruit ceviche is to die for- I highly recommend it as an appetizer. The focus is definitely Latin, so if you don't like Latin food, don't come expecting to find a hamburger or pasta on the menu.  Although it is pricey, the entree portions are huge! I have never eaten more than half a meal here! Meat dishes come with plenty of veggies and fried rice (so unhealthy but absolutely delis), so you'll never leave full.Definitely a hard place to eat healthy though- the ceviche dishes are truly appetizers (too small for a meal), and no salads. Great service and ambiance- comfortable, low lighting, the booths are very private.

[ Helpful tip:  Don't order the Mule Kick which is jalapeno-infused vodka with ginger beer.] It was so bad that we actually passed it around the table to let everyone try what was generally agreed to be the worst drink any of us had ever had.  It tasted sort of like grass that had been left to ferment in an old gym sock.The food itself was timed terribly--half of my party of six got their food a full fifteen minutes before the rest of the party.  When the second half of the food came out, (two orders of pork shank) one order was stone cold and the other was so salty that it tasted like the meat had been preserved for a long sea voyage.  Seriously terrible.  Both were sent back (Which we almost never do) and the subsequent portions were only slightly more edible.The manager came over several times and tried to make amends--we had several drinks comped, the pork was taken off the bill and we were treated to dessert.  But there are too many good restaurants in this city to put up with service this bad.",1,0,0,Mike S.,"New York, NY",0,6,0

Yes, included in the above price, and yes, they have 8 different sangria choices, all of them spiked with brandy or other liquers.; Not just cheap wine, fruit juice and fruit.

OMFG, crazy delicious is all I can say. And then using my warm cheese bread to sop up the sauce........ My bf had the Latin Benedict with housemade duck and pork sausage over arepas, or corn cakes. Also amazingly delicious. Why not 5 stars you ask.... You can enjoy Sangrias only while you are eating your meal.

True to its Latin American theme, Calle Ocho had loud Spanish music playing overhead, which I found to be a bit overwhelming when the dining room got full.Nevertheless, this place is famous for its complimentary, free-flow sangria that comes with every entree. They make the glasses rather large, so unless you're determined on getting tipsy, it might be difficult to try more than a couple of glasses in one sitting.I really enjoyed Calle Ocho's version of Brazilian cheese bread, which was part of an assortment in the complimentary bread basket. It was soft and fluffy and best of, all, gluten-free. I've had homemade versions that tended to be chewier and more rubbery but this one was great. I got their hash for my entree, and it was rather more like pulled pork with avocado, an egg, and a couple of fingerling potatoes. I would have liked the pork to be a bit less salty, because it got quite difficult to eat especially with the low potato to pork ratio.Service here was very pleasant and expedient but not in a pushy way.

Service was great and the drinks were pretty solid. Once seated, the great service continued as we were brought ceviche, bite-sized empanadas, melty cheesy croquettes, and paella - all tasty. The ceviche sampler was fun and easy to share. I highly recommend that. We also ordered a pitcher of sangria which lasted most of dinner. Fun experience in NY!

2.0,10/25/2013,"Def a big not so cozy hotel restaurant. The dimmer lights help but ultimately you have to accept that the place is filled with hotel patrons after a long day - not interested in any more NYC adventure. We went for dinner after an evening walk across the park from the UES.Food was fine and did the trick for what we were looking for (a decent meal with no pretension). Was great to get a free glass of Sangria for checking in (thanks yelp!).That being said, we wouldn't recommend the vegetarian paella (not sure where the veggies were) as its a big plate of brown rice with little else. The Bistec was actually pretty great.Note the prices are not what I would consider ""$$"" - it was easily ""$$$"". $24-$30 for entrees.",2,0,0,Faizal K.,"New York, NY",4,9,0

3.0,10/24/2013,"I really had high hopes for Calle Ocho brunch after hearing about it from multiple people, and it was somewhat of a disappointment. I contemplated 2 starts, but judging by other reviews I'm wondering if I was just here on a bad day or something.We had a reservation for a group of 7 and we were sat down promptly. The dining room is very large, but it did feel a little scattered and noisy with all the tables crammed in. It had a weirdly lit cruise boat dining room vibe about it that I wasn't particularly fond of. Our service was very bizarre... We had probably 3 different people taking orders and what not so it got a little confusing. The sangria menu is almost more extensive than the food menu. The one saving grace was the sangria! It was soooo good. They brought it out to us immediately and we we're able to drink more than we even wanted. The food menu sounds amazing on paper, but it was the biggest let down! I love this type of cuisine for brunch and I was overall underwhelmed. A lot of our meals didn't come with all the toppings and sides and sauces that were on the menu, which is always a disappointment. I'm not usually critical with portion sizes, but come on its brunch you want to leave feeling full. It was by no means unacceptable, but it definitely wasn't memorable either.Overall I wouldn't say this is a bad choice for brunch, but I won't be organizing a trip back any time soon. They seem to be able to tolerate large groups well, and you really can't deny how awesome free sangria with brunch is. Lastly it's a block off the park and it's a beautiful area, great for exploring before or after your meal.",1,0,0,Caitlin G.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",63,141,32

I sat down and mingled with some guests at the party and our food orders were taken rather quickly. We did not really have time to look at the menu and collect our thoughts. For my appetizer I ordered the Arape. It was crunchy and came with a spicy mole sauce. My entree (I ordered chicken) was moist and had a little too much sauce for my taste.

We got a free glass of sangria each as a Yelp promotion. Cons. These knocked my rating down from a full 5 stars. - No warning that the octopus ceviche is extremely spicy. I am ok with spicy stuff but my portion was off-the-charts hot and, ultimately, inedible and had to return it. This was disappointing as we ran out of time and would've eaten something else.

They ended up charging her for everything, even though it wasn't what she ordered.

4.0,10/16/2013,"Making reservations at Calle Ocho is like a habit. If I'm feeling like it's been a while since I've had bottomless sangria, I look to see if there are any spots available for brunch. It doesn't matter how far in advance it is; I often just make the reservation for the maximum number of people on OpenTable (6) and then see if I can round up some troops to partake.It's been a year since my last visit, and not much has changed. They give you a basket of bread and muffins as soon as you are seated. Don't be a fool and eat something beforehand to avoid getting drunk too quickly. You want as many of these as possible. I especially like the round one with a slightly cracked exterior; that one is cheesy and not as sweet as the other muffins.This most recent visit was a party of 9, and three of us showed up first. They seated us  immediately, and started with the drink orders early. They only hold the table for two hours, so if you show up late, that's less booze for you (although, trust me, you'll probably have enough booze even if you don't show up on time)! The sangria tends to run a little sweet. If you want less sweet, go with the Blanca or the Roja. I've had the benedict and enjoyed it, and the cachapas are good, although a little sweeter than i wanted with the sangria. If you want more time to order drinks, order a dessert!

4.0,9/9/2013,"**Brunch Review** This past Sunday, I wanted to try a new brunch place. In the past, I've had about 3 failed attempts trying to get into Calle Ocho's Cuban brunch. Either it was too late, too crowded, or wait time was too long. Finally, I managed to get there early enough. We arrived around 12:30pm and no line! Yay.  As a sangria lover, this place caught my attention bc they specialize in a large variation of sangria flavors. The price is so cheap considering it's unlimited. Although they ONLY serve sangria for brunch, I find it hard to believe that someone wouldn't be able to find a concoction they enjoy. They have several whites and reds to choose from. I tried the ""Havana Banana"" which was my favorite. It was rum based, with coconut pieces, lychee and banana flavors. This was my favorite. The ""Punta Cana"" white sangria had mamajuana in it (if you're not familiar, look it up!). The reds were delicious as well. They consisted of either vodka, brandy or rum. The ""Spanish Harlem"" was enjoyable for me.The food....ehhh! Below average. I was not impressed. I had the steak and eggs for $18 and was regretful as soon as I took my first bite. The pork rice, steak, tomatoes, avocado and pickled onions was not a good mixture. I didn't understand the combination. The flavors did not blend well. It sounds better than what it is. Next time i'll have the burger which looked yummy! FYI, the steak was the most expensive item on the menu ($18) and that's including the unlimited sangria. Everything else averages around $15, it's a steal. Here's the catch, you can drink unlimited sangria as long as you are still eating. Once you're done with your meal and they take the plates away, bye bye sangria. I must say, they are very strong and I had to stop after 2.5 glasses. So although there's no specific time span ... it pretty much evens out. Plus, you can redeem a free glass by checking in on yelp if you want another one..... You're welcome ;) I was going to give it 3 stars, but they really do an excellent job with the sangria. So eat slow and drink fast, but most importantly buen provecho!P.S. I don't think they are super strict about that eating rule, so just be nice ;)",5,2,4,Yanill P.,"Manhattan, NY",574,355,1286
5.0,9/8/2013,"The ultimate boozy brunch gold standard: affordable, innovative, delicious! My first reaction here: how the heck can I afford this place? The lobby by the entrance is fancy, and the decor inside is beautiful. I'm coming here to boozy brunch, just have $40 bucks cash as I'm fresh out a charity run and I'm afraid of running out of money (or worse, overpaying for a bad meal). As a half Cuban, I'm always skeptical with Cuban restaurants, but I must say, this place gets a thumbs up from me. Delicious, well seasoned Vaca frita burger with crispy little fries, couldn't ask for anything better. Two patties of pork and beef, two! The chimuchirri fries were not too memorable, not terribly crispy or well infused with the chimichurri sauce, but the burger was the real star here. The chipotle ketchup was a great addition--tasted more like marinara sauce than ketchup, but that was a great thing, as it didn't overwhelm the burger at all. Any place that gives out warm bread is pretty much guaranteed an additional Star, but this was an automatic one--their bread basket was great, and included a slightly sweet ""pan de queso"" (cheese-ish bread). One of those baskets you need to pace yourself with, at the risk of getting full before your meal. And, of course, unlimited sangria, with many different selections. A very, very generous size with great flavors. They take boozy brunch seriously here. Service was great, as soon as your glass is almost empty, our waiter was back asking us if we wanted another.

Having 3 options made my choice really easy but they brought me my own basket of yucca rolls and some strawberry butter so I had plenty to eat.

I do miss their old location and the old buffet setup of sangrias. It made the sangria more accessible, and I had fun mixing different sangrias.

2.0,9/1/2013,"I went here recently for a friend's thirtieth birthday dinner, and, while I want to start off by saying she was happy with the experience, I also want to give this place two effing stars.Here's why:The food was bad.Sorry. There's not much more to say. The servers and water guys (of whom there were like a million) were all extremely nice and seemed very cool. The restaurant was clean and okay. And, I mean, there was free sangria with check-in. So that was cool. But, to me, when you go to a restaurant, you expect to have a good meal. And a good meal this was not.I had the ""calamari,"" which tasted like a B-movie version of chicken teriyaki. Everyone else's meals were equally odd. Nothing was inedible--everything tasted sort of okay--but not a single person made a comment about their food being good. And at $24-$34 an entree, I'd say that's a big big problem.To be fair to them, this is a restaurant within a hotel. But to be fair to the rest of us, this is still a restaurant. At least, sort of.",1,1,1,Sara C.,"Astoria, NY",369,132,0
4.0,8/31/2013,"Is original always the best? The first bite of pizza is always, if not the tastiest, the most memorable experience; the first movie chronicle often features the best cast and storyline (a debatable topic, surely); or the first spouse might be really 'The One'? (hence a lot of remarriage going on in law offices). How about restaurant? Back then when '8th Street' was still at its original location instead of inside a hotel, conveniently across the street from a museum and one of most famous park in the world, it was a fun joint to get inebriated on weekends.  AYCD sangria with the price of an entree? Whether the drinks are watered down or not, that just can't be beaten, especially with all the settled fruits in the bottom of the glasses, which are mainly fresh, not canned.  The old space was like a mysterious clubby joint which you've to enter through a dark foyer that leads to a cavernous opening, filled with populated tables and high ceiling.  But with this new migration, you enter through the revolving door, make a right (thanks to a direction sign) and you're there to meet the hostesses.  The mysterious palpation is gone.  The tables are still filled with patrons, young and old; family and friends; couples and occasion celebrations and yes, the decibel level is still off the hook.  In additional to the house Latin music and the surrounding conversations, I could hardly hear myself talk, not to mention my companion's responses.  But the most disappointment of all is the removal of sangria self-service.  Now, the overworked waitstaff will bring over your choice of beverage and will only grant you another one only if you've finished one.  It is like a conditioned theory whereas you will be rewarded with another one only if you have done said task (finished the first drink).  But when the glass is filled to the top, unless you've strong tolerance (and an elastic bladder), it is very, very difficult to go beyond two.  So the best way to sample all flavors is to go with a large group and like a smoke joint, pass the glasses around.  Sure, it is more sophisticated and sanitary to eliminate people from 'scoop and sip', but that also allowed me to try out all the flavors till palate fatigue. Oh, how I missed the mix-and-match days...Besides all my grievances, Calle Ocho is still one of the best AYCD brunch place to be.  The entrees are not compromised, which they could easily be and could be.  The tortilla Española was a hearty portion - a wedge of eggcentric frittata packed with cubed potatoes, vegetables, and mushrooms, and delivered on a pool of spicy crab enchilado.  The Cuban sandwich is a given - pork, ham, and cheese all melted in a panini press.  What's not to love about that for a meat eater? And the addictive pao de queijo.  Like mini orbs of cheesy carb, they are really savory, yet with a hint of sweetness.  Skip the overly-sweet corn muffins and just dive into this Brazilian bread.  There is a high table turnover, which means the drinks are always fresh and there is basically no quiet moment.  Service is sufficient, but if you need something, you do need to flag someone since the waitstaff is literally skating across the floor, trying to get things done.  If there is one facility improvement that could be implemented, is that there should be more available bathrooms.  I mean, only three for a house full of people here for AYCD? It is rationally reasonable to install more places for relief.  As in my 'original' review, Calle Ocho brunch is best if you're a heavy drinker and a lover of sangria.",2,1,2,GarGuPi L.,"Flushing, NY",87,496,1696

One of the best I've ever bought. I will be back with or without a deal and as soon as possible.Food - Combination of four empanadas with guac. Yum. The best two were the lobster and the mushroom. The chicken was very tasty.

Think ropa vieja but beef. Tender, perfect, to dream about. Excellent rice mixed with beans and the egg adds such creaminess. I'm mixing up my leftovers (and you will have leftovers), putting them in a tortilla for dinner.Bisteak - good cut of meat prepared perfectly. The yucca was killer.Ask for extra chimichurri sauce.All servings were large and plated nicely. The excellent bartender said the ribs were killer, also.Drinks - Not a huge fan of sangria. We did check in for a free glass (huge glass). It was good and flavorful. But, the special drink with tequilla? To die for! Strong and tasty. Loved it (and we did each have two).Service - Nothing more to say than excellent, the host, bartender, waitress, busboys. Well, I will say this. When my meal came out, the egg wasn't quite as runny as I like. Two seconds later, our waitress came over to see how it was.

3.0,7/30/2013,"Calle Ocho has been a longtime favorite of many, with their biggest draw being the unlimited sangria during brunch. However, this staple has been tampered with ever since their move from three blocks uptown to their new (not so new anymore) spot at the Excelsior Hotel.In the good old days, they had large jugs of varying flavors of sangria sitting on a long table at one side of the dining room. Brunch was enjoyable (as long as people didn't act like fools around that table) because you could try different sangria to tickle your taste buds. Once you've had a bit of food, and if your tolerance for beverages are all right, you'll get to enjoy delicious flavors of sangria that you might not have tried before.Since then, however, they've moved to doing waiter service for the sangria, for which your experience depends heavily on the individual waiter. I've had good and bad experiences here for that reason, from a time when a charming waiter would proactively bring sangria before people at my table could even finish a glass, to a time when a nasty human being refused to serve our small party for some strange reason, and would give us nasty glares when we tried to ask him for more sangria. The latter experience prompted me to speak with the manager, Joe, who is a fantastic guy that really went out of his way to ensure that our next dining experience here was superb, and it was.Beyond these unique details, though, the food is all right and are slightly more expensive than similar food offerings.

4.0,7/22/2013,"Go for the Sangrias, stay for the Sangrias.Calle Ocho has a great way of getting you through the door.  A slew of delicious red and white wine sangrias.  When you find out that you can have as many as you want, they're going to have to throw you out before you want to stop.  Just be careful not to pass out while exiting.  That would be embarassing.This Cuban haven is a great brunch spot in the upper west side.  It is usually very hard to find reservations for it but if you arrive early, you can sit down in a lounge area to the side of the bar.  You'll, obviously, not have the table real estate that you have in the main hall but, to tell you the truth, you're not there for the food.My salmon cachapa, while pretty good, didn't blow my socks off in any regard.  It was almost like a nice complement to the real ""entree"", the sangrias.  Some friends of mine, that have come in the past, have complained of watered-down sangrias while others tell me otherwise.  My experience was the latter.  Wide selection, great flavors and perfect kick.The slew of people that flood this spot every weekend can't be wrong.  It's a great drunch (drunk-brunch).  If you make a reservation now, you might get something in the next decade.  Maybe sooner.",0,0,0,Jose I.

They don't limit you to 2 hours and then kick you out like many other all you can drink brunch places. They were setting up for dinner service as we finished, so they asked us politely to sit at the bar, where we could continue imbibing more sangria!The service is great too.

I read about the cheesy bread they used to bring out, but we didn't get that, which was a shame. I think we got regular bread, but frankly I don't remember. I got the flat iron steak which was very tasty and the hubs got the salmon with the lobster mash and he raved about the mash.

I'll start with the good. I enjoyed the ambience - bright, colorful walls and lively music (but not too loud), with a little dim lighting. The sangria was free. Five of us shared a bunch of small plates and a few entrees. The ceviche was tasty - nice acidity, fresh fish. The octopus was tender and smoky. The bad. While free, the sangria tasted mostly like juice. The food is expensive considering the smaller portions and while I enjoyed the food, particularly the smaller plates, nothing blew me away. The carne and puerco were a little bland. The restaurant is in a hotel, so I wasn't too surprised. If you're in the neighborhood and want an upscale experience check it out.

Yes please, just remember to make a reservation so you don't end up just watching.What I Ordered!Vaca Frita Al Caballo*, Havana Banana Sangria*, Puma Cana Sangria * = das the stuff.My Experience (Starting from 5 stars):Food: At first I thought unlimited sangria must come with a side of mediocre entrees and small portion meals, I was very happy to find out that I was wrong. The Vaca Frita Al Caballo dish was delicious! There must have been magic in that rice because it had so much flavor. The drinks weren't slacking either, Havana Banana was one slick drink, sweet and not too strong (we're here to enjoy our drinks and not to get drunk remember?).

3.0,6/1/2013,"I celebrated two birthdays in a row over brunch in Calle Ocho! This is my favorite brunch place in a the city just based solely on the bread basket itself. Last year I came with my girlfriends from college and were amazed by the service and atmosphere. I've been raving this place for weeks to my grad school friends. They couldn't believe there exists such a great brunch deal in the city. 8 types of unlimited sangria? complimentary bread? 10+ types of unique brunch entrees? no time limit as long as you're eating? I'm there!8 of us arrived for our 12 PM reservation. 2 of us actually arrived  a little late and they were waiting for our whole party to be there before seating us. We happily waited in the hotel lobby seats right by the door. By 12:15, we were all seated at our table studying intensely at their brunch menu. All of us spent a little time reading the house rules on the side of the menu - no craziness, got it. The waiter was really prompt in coming over to take our orders. Basically our whole table ordered steak and eggs - for 2 extra dollars, u get steak! why not? 2 people did however ordered the vegetarino and salmon crepe. The waiter was quick in warning the portion size of the salmon crepe. Wanting to try something different, I offered to give some of my steak and eggs to my friend in case the salmon crepe wasn't enough food. She accepted the offer and stuck to her initial choice. 2 giant bread baskets were dropped off at our table shortly after. I really wanted to jump out of my seat and ask for third NOW. I know the bread baskets won't last for more than 2 mins and boy was I right. There were so many choices and we all wanted to try every type in the basket. There were donuts with caramel sauce, assorted muffins, chocolate chip rolls, and my fav cheese bread! We just couldn't put the cheese bread down. Drinks came shortly after. However none of the drink orders came out correctly. No matter what we ordered from the white sangrias, we all got havana banana. Both red ones we ordered ended up tasting the same?  I believe they just gave both of us fresas. We didn't bother correcting the drink orders since it's unlimited and we could swap out flavors later. Onward with more bread! And before we knew it, our main entrees were out. The steak and eggs came out sooooo quickly to a point that I suspect they were premade. Even though my 2 friends ordered vegetarino and salmon crepe, they were ready to serve them steak and eggs too. When we stopped the server and explained to them what they ordered instead, they really pushed them to get the steak and eggs instead. My friend who ordered the vegetarino ended up agreeing to just take the ready made steak and egg. My other friend however really wanted to try the salmon crepe. So we asked the server to take back the 8th order of steak and eggs and please serve us what we actually ordered. It didn't take too long for the correct dish to come out. And we were back onto munching away. I wasn't particularly impressed by the steak and eggs - definitely has been sitting there for a bit. I did however loved my friend's salmon crepe. Smoked salmon scrambled eggs wrapped in yummy crepe - with a creamy white sauce + gravy. Wished we didn't all ordered the same thing and was able to sample a few more dishes.It took the servers a long time to fulfill our second drink order. To make things less complicated, we just all ordered the same thing. The servers were all over the place. We had to remind them 2-3 times to replenish the bread baskets and to refill our water. They accidentally gave us condiments that the table next to us has ordered. The service was nothing like I remembered a year ago. I understand that it can get a little overwhelming with the all the drink requests and number of tables... but the staff really need to talk to each other. My friends and I stayed for almost 3 hours. We just kept nursing the drinks and taking small bites. I kinda wished I didn't ask for the last order of bread basket because my friends had ordered 2 surprised desserts for me - creme brulee and chocolate cake. I didn't know .. so I was still stuffing my face with muffins 3 hrs into brunch. Creme brulee wasn't particularly sweet and the portion was HUGE. The chocolate cake came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yummy but nothing to write home about. Overall, a little disappointed by Calle Ocho. Bread basket still a 5 stars in my heart. Salmon crepe gets 4 stars. But everything else prob 3 at its best. Hope the service improves at my next visit. But as long as u refill my bread basket with those cheesey goodness, I will continue to return.",1,1,1,Wing C.,"Pasadena, CA",213,1497,10231
3.0,6/1/2013,"The draw of this place for me is the free sangria and bread, not so much the entrees. I've visited twice for brunch and had fairly similar experiences both times. The service isn't bad but it's not the most attentive, place is absolutely packed and a bit loud. You can get your bread basket refilled so don't be shy to eat it. The first time I visited I got the frita cubana which was forgettable. It was extremely dry and required a heavy dose of ketchup. Perhaps if I would have asked for it to have been cooked medium rare it would have been better but the waitress didn't ask and on such a thin patty that would have been hard. Fries were decent but that's hard to mess up. It wasn't terrible but it's also not something I would order again. The second time I split the gallitos with my girlfriend. Again while it was good it wasn't anything special. The chorizo wasn't the most flavorful and I would have liked it to have had some spiciness. The eggs seemed to be cooked fine, I'm not really an egg person. The guac tasted good and seemed fresh however something was quite watery so the guac and lettuce were swimming in liquid. Home fries were cooked well and well seasoned. The first time I visited I ordered the tres leches for desert. It was really quite bad. I believe the cake was made using whole wheat flour and was a bit tough. Not the sweet soft almost falling apart kind I'm used to. The whip cream wasn't the normal thick rich kind you would expect and the milk the cake was soaked in wasn't as creamy and sweet as I would like. The second time I skipped desert, didn't want to chance it. As far as the sangria goes I didn't have any I didn't care for. The Blanca and Roja are your standard red and white sangria and they're just ok. The Roja reminded me of the jugs of Carlo Rossi that used to grace my counter in college. My top 3 would have to be the Havana Banana, Frescas, and Tropical. Calle Ocho is definitely a good deal for a boozy brunch but I would be hesitant to return for any other meal. There's much better Cuban food in this city, Calle Ocho is really only a standout for me because of their delicious and unlimited bread and sangria.",0,0,0,Matthew R.,"Manhattan, NY",151,749,53

However, I do remember our favourite of the night was the skirt steak with eggs on rice. You MUST try the ceviches. We ordered the ceviche platter and we didn't regret it at ALL.

1.0,5/26/2013,"Wow. After YEARs of coming here, this place has gone down the chopper. First off, since they stopped doing the sangria bar, you can only order one sangria at a time, and since they give you a big pour, you can't really try any of the others. I'm a taste tester so I like to try small amounts of many instead of one giant glass of one flavor. The food itself is just okay now. They stopped serving the cheese bread for brunch!!!! so sad. I asked 3 times for it (with three different waiters) to make sure. It was one of my favorite breads in the city *tears*. The service was also very slow. Lastly the waiter put the tip on my card incorrectly. He put a 50% tip. WTF? I have the original receipt, and I'm going to dispute it with the credit card company soooo sucks for calle ocho.

4.0,5/23/2013,"CAN WE HAVE A SECOND BREAD BASKET?! And uh...a  to go box? #noshameCheesy big round bread buns, so fluffy and cheesy on the inside, very 'bready' on the outside (was not expecting the inside to be SO GOOD) and thick, moist, black (red?) bean sauce. We got a pitcher of Sangria (so many sangria options!) and they were very friendly (but never intrusive) about making sure our glasses were always full. The dinner entrees were the standard 20-40 you would expect from an upscale restaurant but the portions were HUGE.  Like, cheesecake factor HUGE. I got the ceviche sample (of course! my ceviche trip!) and all four were very good. None of them stood out as the most delicious fish ever but they were all tasty. The Red Snapper with green papaya, grapefruit, and thai chili was my favorite by far. Rich tender fish and delicately sauced, sweet, spicy, tart, tender. YUM.The sliced aji tuna, mojarro, radish-sprout salad, and mango-mustard mojo. OMG MANGO MUSTARD MOJO. I was unimpressed by the mixto - too much tomato makes it taste like a shrimp cocktail which is not what I wanted. The fourth was forgettable - good! but forgettable...was it salmon? was it mojarro? what exactly was the taste of the sauce? Could not tell you. And of course, with Latin food you can never go wrong with chicken. THE BEST KIND OF CHICKEN AND RICE. Oh wow huge portions. It was literally a GIANT slab of chicken ontop a huge chuck of seasoned rice. Very moist chicken - perfectly so according to my friend and agreed to by me from the one bite I took. Crisp and slick outside skin (not too oily/greasy/etc.) and thick, delicately and appropriately seasoned chicken. Super sweet server! Very friendly host (male hostess?) And the floor manager came by at the end (think she does this with every table) to ask how our meal went. GREAT service. I don't normally comment on restrooms but considering there were two for women and they were both SO CLEAN and individual/private and large. UM. YES. AWESOME.

And the small cheese ball breads are soo delicious, especially when they first bring them out all warm and fluffy, straight from the oven (or wherever they came from). And with the strawberry butter, oh! so good. This past weekend, my friend and I both ordered the skirt steak, which comes atop a mound of latin fried rice, sliced tomatoes and a slice of avocado, and a side of fried eggs. The steak itself was actually just okay. But everything else complimented each other so well that I let it slide. I also tend to think that eggs are just eggs no matter where you go. These eggs were made perfectly fried on top but runny in the middle, just the way I like them. Make sure you make reservations because I've heard it can be quite a wait if you don't.

The ceviche was just not the ceviche we were expecting, the portions were tiny !!! I mean tiny and we're Hispanic, we know what ceviche should be, it wasn't. Maybe because it was Cuban.

Unfortunately, we didn't think to make a reservation which was a lesson we learned the hard way. The hostess informed us that the restaurant was completely full but we could try grabbing a spot at the bar if something opens up on a first come first serve basis. We really wanted to try this place so we decided to wait. Luckily, a table opened up and after an hour or so, we were finally seated. When I opened the menu, I was greeted with a pleasant surprise - FREE SANGRIA?!? They had a variety of red and white. We expected them to be stricter with refills, however our waiter frequently came by to ask if we wanted another glass despite seeing the half filled glasses of sangria on our table. Even at the end of our meal, the waiter was still offering us drinks which led us to wonder whether he had an ulterior motive... haha.I ordered the Cachapa de Salmon which was a crepe filled with smoked salmon and scrambled eggs and topped with crema nata (which is similar to sour cream). I thought the crepe was good but the flavors didn't make my palate dance. In my opinion, the flavor and texture were monotone.

I had been eyeing the Vaca Frita anyway so I decided to go for it with his blessing. It was Cuban skirt steak, latin fried rice, tomato escabeche, avocado and fried eggs. And oh man was it good! The steak was tender and teeming with latin flavor, the rice was a little dry but the escabeche (tomatoes, red onions, lemon juice, and parsley) gave it a nice little kick. The fried eggs were perfectly cooked with the yellow of the egg spilling out upon first cut which I also mixed in with the rice.  The girls got a Cuban sandwich, Tortilla Espanola, and Quesadillas de El Salvador.

5.0,3/30/2013,"Whether or not this may be located on ""8th Street"", is Calle Ocho a place that can send you to Cloud Nine?One of the great things about food is that it gives you a little insight into the culture of a people, and if you do it just right, the place you're enjoying your meal can help enhance the experience. When you first enter the location, you may think you might have made a wrong turn somewhere even though the outside awning is scripted with ""Calle Ocho"", and that's because you step into a quiet hotel lobby that serves to a certain caliber of clientele. However, a conveniently placed sign pointing out Calle Ocho helps you realize that you came to just the right spot. As soon as you enter the door, an infectious Latin jazz soundtrack plays as there's definitely some lively chatter at the location. The décor is roomy, a bit classy, and is outfitted with moody lighting and various art pieces on the wall.As my guest and I were seated, in the busy establishment, it wasn't soon before long that our waiter came to us. Our server was so kind, courteous, friendly and infectiously spirited we felt really comfortable asking about the items on the menu and what he might recommend. Even when we made the silly choice of ordering two separate dishes, while he was gently trying to tell us in his own way that ""DUDE, THAT IS A LOT OF FOOD!"", he never judged us. I wish I had remembered his name -was it Eric, Erin, or maybe even Sean? - the best I could describe him is how he looked and that is a tall slender blonde man with short hair and spoke with a bit of a lisp. If you get him, you're in for some real great service. The bus staff were on the up and up as well as they were sure to check that our table was clean - even if it was just a single grain of rice on the table.The dinner selection was quite nice and just about everything on the menu seemed quite appetizing - but my craving for seafood kicked in and I zeroed in on the paella which did not disappoint at all.  It was a great portion and the seafood was abundant - the whole dish was cooked to perfection. My guest was also having a great time as well as she ordered the Vaca Frites which she just simply wish she had more room in her stomach for.  For those of you interested in the alcohol selection, I simply couldn't comment because my guest and I were decidedly having an alcohol free night - I know, a sin to do such a thing at a Latin establishment. Finishing off the entire meal was a sorbet my guest and I shared and it was amazing. Three different flavors - coconut, passionfruit, and mango - each had its distinct flavor, and they all worked together to provide a great sensation on our tastebuds.SUMMARY:- PRICE: It may seem a bit pricey for some,  but with the portion that is given  with the quality of food proves that entry is definitely worth the price of admission - DÉCOR: It's somewhat fine dining with a casual twist. The environment is lively but you'll still be able to hear yourself. A good place for a date- FOOD: At times abundant, the food here is simply great. It's savory, its sweet, it can be spicy... it's Latin!NOTABLE MENTION: Calle Ocho does what many others have had a difficult time doing - having a fine dining Latin experience that is festive, with professional service and an excellent menu with amazing results.

5.0,3/27/2013,"Oh, Calle Ocho. It's been five years since I started going to you, and though things have changed a lot (most reflected by your move around the block to the Hotel Excelsior), you're still one of my favorite places in the city for a good time.The complimentary and unlimited sangria at brunch is probably the largest draw here (there are 8 types, and this isn't watered down weak stuff either! I prefer Spanish Harlem) but the food is also quite good. The yucca-manchego bread that arrives before each meal is a small revelation; though I suppose I could describe it as a Cuban version on French gougeres, that wouldn't do it justice. Warm and providing a nice tensile chew in the mouth, the bread has a beautiful texture that I haven't found elsewhere. Whenever I come here with my mom, she always buys extra bread for home, she loves it so much (though they often don't let her pay for it).For dinner, appetizers such as the fried calimari with Dominican honey or the smoked grilled octopus are standouts--it's been a long time since I've tried the ceviches, but if memory serves me correctly, they're also good. As an entree, I nearly always get the ""vegetarian paella,"" which is also available at brunch. It's a bit of a misnomer--not quite what I'd describe as paella, it's instead a wild mushroom-flavored rice, thick and rich with flavor, each grain of rice held together by manchego cheese. Vaca frita, bistec, and carne are also all good options, though that may just be because I'm partial to steak.Complimentary unlimited sangria (usually priced at $9/glass) really makes this a top choice for great-value brunch, but if you're going for another meal, prices will be in line with a New York dine-in average, if not slightly higher.",0,0,0,Audrey L.,"New York, NY",91,21,0

The sangrias however.......WOW!!! and so many red and white types to choose from. I think 4 reds and 4 whites on the menu. UNLIMITED. Calle Ocho is so tough to get in. You must make reservations like 3-4 weeks in advance.We ordered the following:   Tortilla Espanola - Spanish frittata with asparagus, potatoes, Piquillo peppers, and wild mushrooms over a crab enchilado. You could really taste the freshness of the vegetables and the frittata was fluffy and light. The crab added extra texture and a subtle salty taste to heighten each flavor-packed bite.Vaca Frita - Cuban skirt steak with Latin rice, tomato escabeche, avocado and fried eggs. So tender! So Juicy! A mouth-watering dish indeed. We would come back just for this.Sangrias - We tried the Havana Banana which was deliciously laced with lychee fruit, banana and coconut rum. The Tropical was our favorite! It was made with mango, pineapple, lemongrass, passion fruit, and rum. And Mojito, a nice twist to the traditional mojitos, with added lemon, orange, and sugar cane for a delicate sweetness.Bread Basket with Strawberry Butter - an assortment of chocolate, caramel and sourdough rolls with ample fruity butter to spread. You will be begging for more! Promise.Everything was simply exquisite. $15 - 20 dollars per person will get you an entree, sangria, and bread basket.

It's dimly lit, it's got the Spanish music playing in the background that makes you want to just get up and dance. It's definitely got that brunchy feel to it on the weekends.I was brought here last night by a friend for a birthday dinner. We started with the Gallitos appetizer - a platter of chipotle seasoned chicken, steak, garlic shrimp and a jalapeno pickled slaw with corn flour tortillas. Becuase I'm an avid Mojito lover, of course I ordered one. Let me start with the drinks... I can only speak on their mojitos, but for ME,I didn't taste much alcohol in it. I've had mojitos pretty much at every establishment I've ever been to, and this one wasn't memorable. It really just tasted more like mint-flavored soda. The appetizer platter was good. My favorite was probably the steak, but it could've stood to be just a little bit more tender.For entrees, I had the vaca frita which was skirt steak with 'Latin pork friend rice' (didn't know there was such a thing, go figure), a fried egg, pickled onions, and avocado. My friend had the duck two ways, which when it came out looked like it was really only cooked one way.I didn't taste her dish, but she said it was good. Mine was good, but again, it wasn't fantastic. I usually like for the egg to be more runny so that it blends with the rice nicely. This egg was literally more on the well done side so it threw me off. The steak was tender, but it was more ropa vieja style than the churrasco I had envisioned. The rice was... well, rice. If you're messing up rice, there's a problem. It was alright. If you want really really good food though, there are some better options.",0,0,0,Stephanie M.,"Brooklyn, NY",132,52,99

Simply because it's so cheap (less than 20 dollars an entree and you get to enjoy unlimited sangria).. How can you say no to a LAZY SUNDAY!!I guess it's because i came with my fav peeps in NYC!!! My fav girl, fav roommate, and my date (all my loves ones).. We were starving and started ""inhaling"" all the bread in the bread basket and order another one immediately. Have I said that they have one of the best breakfast?? Especially the ""cheesy bread"".. My roommate is 25% Latino so he told me the name of the bread but I forgot.. I guess it's because of the sangria.. The corn bread and the chocolate bread were amazing as well.. The chocolate bread was crispy and also semi-sweet made it perfect. I think I had a total of 5-6 breads.. We also finished the strawberry butter and the waiter brought us another ""bowl"" of strawberry butter..I was kinda glad that we had the room with a bigger table all the way in.. We started ""salsa-ing"".. I guess everyone around us thought we were really drunk but we only had a glass of sangria.. enough of my story.. let's head to the food..4 of us ordered- Quesidillas de el salvador.. It;s just quesidillas with chicken in it and top with avocado.. A nice mixture with some sour cream on top.. you have a really confusing taste.. sweet, slightly spicy, and mushy taste.. The chipotle chicken was so tender.. not my favorite dish but it's good- vaca frita.. The steak was so perfect.. perfect mexican food for brunch if you want a slightly heavier portion- burrito sucio.. MY FAV DISH!! It's like an omelet cover with beans avocado... PERFECT FOR BRUNCH if you want eggs.. it's like an american + spanish combination..SANGRIA!! It's totally depends on your taste.. my favorite is the spanish harlem and tropical..SERVICE!! Best service in MANHATTAN!!

Definitely not recommendable. I totally agree that their sangria is awesome. Tried both sangria rojas (original flavor) and sangria blancas (with mango and pineapple). It's really great, much better than Kefi's. However, their entree dishes fell below my expectation. Read some previous hype reviews on their cuban skirt steak and seafood paella, so we ordered both. Skirt steak? so disappointing. We wanted medium-rare but it was not properly cooked. Hard to cut and chew; was not tender and juicy. We even called and asked our server whether this dish is the best steak available at this restaurant. He said 'yes'. omg. Yuca fries served beside the steak were good though. Seafood Paella? great portion as much as one can share with another friend. Wished that we could have more seafood than chorizo and rice. Lobster was not that big as seen in photos at Yelp. Your first bite would be impressive, but as you continue having it, you might taste a bit greasy. One more thing that we liked other than the sangria was their bread which is served with main dishes. Like bread balls with warm cheese melted inside. Very yammy. Other than these two, nothing memorable and nothing special.

I really liked my boyfriend's, which was a red sangria and was berry sweet (see what i did there). But we still didn't get to try many flavors because they were a lot to finish. Still, good drinks.Food was not great. I ordered the platter for two and it was awful. Small portions and very mediocre. Nothing special about it, tortilla was very dry and the platter had very few selections to wrap in the tortilla. Very useless dish. Boyfriend got the cuban panini which I liked. That was actually pretty good so if you go, you can try that.Need to make reservations well in advance. Really nice comfortable atmosphere.

Two of us got there right around noon, right when they open, and were snagged great seats in the lounge. Our two other friends were delayed so we got to order sangria first and eat the bread/muffins they give out. I'll get to the sangria later, but let me start off by saying oh my goodness, that bread is amazing, oh so wonderful and delightful and leaves me wanting more delicious! A little sweet, but perfectly hard and soft and just so amazing, the bread already ensured that I will be returning.When my other friends arrived, we ordered more sangria and food. I had the Tortilla Espanola, which was good. I particularly enjoyed the crab enchilado, which was a little spicy, but well flavored. My friends and I didn't think any of the entrees were mind-blowing, but considering the amazing prices, delicious bread, nice ambiance, and unlimited sangria, you won't hear any complaints from me.As promised, the sangria! I started with the Fresas, which was delicious, but also strong. I couldn't finish it: the other sangrias distracted me, namely the Punta Cana, which was fruity and my favorite. Tropical was a close second and Havana Banana did not disappoint either. All in all, we had a great time and I'll definitely be back to brunch.",2,0,1,Joanna C.,"Cambridge, MA",191,648,1109

Was it steak?  Yea... you'll find that here.The wrong glass of sangria?  Yea... they'll bring that to you.Offering a free sangria with a yelp check-in?  Yea... they'll tap your phone to make sure your check-in offer is used, and then they will try to charge you for it.  Be sure to double-check your bill.I had this place bookmarked. and I hadn't been able to get a reservation for a long while until last Saturday.  Needless to say, it is no longer bookmarked, and I feel absolutely horrible for dragging my friends here.",2,2,1,Liv L.,"New York, NY",111,41,40

They are very busy which means the service isn't very prompt, but it's definitely worth it to come here at least once in your lifetime. The salmon crepes were ok, wouldn't get it again and it was a small portion, but the steak is delicious.

4.0,1/30/2013,"Alright so this joint is a spot that I have been going to for a few years now. It used to be at a different location but now has moved to the lobby floor of a hotel near Central Park. I had the chance to come here recently and I have to say that the atmosphere of the new location is much better. I like the Latin music they have playing in the background and it just feels like a fun relaxed environment with everyone smiling probably because of the awesome sangria but I will get to that in a moment. Now before I dive in this review is for their brunch only as that is what I have always gone to Calle Ocho for.  The servers here have always been super nice and helpful and this experience was no different. They started off the table with some complimentary bread which is awesome. I almost got stuffed just on the bread itself but had to pace myself to keep in mind that there was good food to be consumed. For the main, my friend and I ordered the Vaca Frita and the Cuban sandwich. The Cuban sandwich looked great and when I took a bite into it I loved the way all the flavors came together to compliment the juicy tender pork. For the vaca frita I will say that I was a bit skeptical about how this would taste. Now my issue with skirt steak usually is that it is a bit too dry for me but this place was actually really solid. The meat was pretty tender and the egg was cooked to perfection so I could not complain at all. I am hoping to go back to NYC soon to try some of their other entrees. Now one of the reasons I love this joint is for their bottomless FREE sangria (limit of one glass at a time). I mean honestly I don't know that many places that give bottomless free alcohol let alone really solid sangria.  They have four red and four white sangrias. Honestly I get one of each every single time I go there. Not sure that I have a favorite because I think each one of them are delicious. For those who don't drink that much the sangria is not weak so don't drink too many otherwise you will definitely be walking out buzzing...

3.0,1/30/2013,"I had such low expectations for this place that it was actually not bad.  We ordered a few plates to share between us, and got our free Sangria upon checking in, which made both Alex and me very happy.  The other guests were very happy with their drinks.  The food was not bad at all, with ceviche being acceptable, the empanadas solid, and the octopus nicely charred.  The prices were a little bit high for the amount of food we got, but considering I expected something like Applebees, it was not bad.  I don't know if I would really recommend it but I would not shy away if you are graciously being taken out by co-workers.",0,0,0,Lama B.,"Brooklyn, NY",229,592,50

1.0,1/26/2013,"I was really excited about going to Calle Ocho last night for a Restaurant Week dinner.  My husband and I went with another couple who had gone to the old location on their first date.  With the exception of the delicious bread basket, this is probably the worst meal I have had in NYC.  My husband and our friends all did the restaurant week menu, but I did not, as I had read reviews that the calamari frito and puerco (neither of which are on the unpublished Restaurant Week menu) were excellent.  I ordered both.  The calamari was heavily battered and fried and covered in a sweet and sour type sauce that was not good. My husband ordered the ceviche which had a strange mealy texture that made us wonder how old the fish was.  Our friends ordered the empanadas, which they liked, and may have been the only positive element to our meal.  The puerco I ordered for my entree tasted like airplane food, hardly any flavor and lukewarm. The rest of the group ordered steak, all cooked to medium.  When my husband cut into his, it was raw on the inside. The others cut theirs and it turns out that none of them were even cooked to rare. The server took them all back to have them cooked further. They were returned still undercooked.  Beyond that, they were doused on an A1-like steak sauce. Even the vegetables they came with were all covered in the sauce to a point that everything on the plate was unappetizing.  For dessert, we had the apple tart and the flan.  Flan is supposed to be light and delicate, this flan was overcooked and dense with a gel-like consistency. The apple tart was served cold with ice cream on top. The $1 apple pies at McDonalds are WAY better than this tart from Calle Ocho.  Our bill was $240 with drinks., which I felt really bad about considering how terrible the meal was.  I am at a loss as to how this restaurant could receive such great reviews. I think 1 star is generous.",0,0,0,G M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0

It's a fairly spacious area but is loud enough to create a busy vibe. I ordered the mushroom paella, which was pretty good, and I found the food to be decent quality but not too crazily priced. I tried some of the salmon crepe and the skirt steak, which were just alright. Obviously, the main draw of the brunch is the bottomless sangria, which is pretty good and is fairly free flowing. The desserts we split were the tres leches cake and the caramel flan, which were also not bad.

5.0,1/17/2013,"Holy Mother of Jesus!!! I totally did not expect this restaurant inside a hotel to be this spectacular. AAAMAZING dinner!! A friend and I decided to go check this place out since its restaurant week, boy were we pleased. Definitely a cozy, romantic kinda place tho, but we didn't mind cuz its alllll about the food. Service was awesome!! 1st: Sangria at the bar. I had Fresas, she had Spanish Harlem. Mine was fruitier than hers, so mine was best :) 2nd: Outside of the Restaurant week menu, we ordered Calamari Frito. I NEVER in my whole entire life had calamari like this before. The calamari had a sweet honey spicy glaze over it. Wished it was crispy, it was more like ""grilled"" calamari, but still tasty as heck! 3rd: I had the Sopa and the Puerco from the Restaurant week menu. The sopa was nothing to write home to mom about, but the PUERCO!!!! The first bite I took, gave me goosebumps literally. I had an orgasm in my mouth! The truffle oil definitely took that dish to a whole other level. Then on the bottom of the humungous portion of pork was some polenta. Damn, that whole dish was just sooooo amazing, mixing the mushroom with the pork and polenta...it's giving me the goosebumps just thinking about. 4th: She had the Filete, which is Filet Mignon. Medium rare, on the rare side is how the filet mignon suppose to be prepared and eaten, and that my friend was how it came out. The filet mignon came out on a bed of sweet potato and sweet plantains with a couple of pieces of asparagus. That was delish as well. 5th: Dessert~ best part of the meal (for me) I had the Hazelnut layered cake with Pumpkin Ice cream, she had like a warm apple tart with Almond Ice cream. Mine was so-so, hers was decadent! All in all, great experience. Even if it isn't restaurant week, I would definitely come back and spread the word of this awesome restaurant!

4.0,1/14/2013,I definitely enjoyed Calle Ocho. Atmosphere was tremendous. Food was great as well. Only knock I had was that the server wasn't as attentive as we would like. First started off with the blanca Sangria. Extremely tasted. I felt like I could chug it down like water but I wanted to be on my best behavior and decided not too. Appetizer - Calamari.  Wasn't your typical fried calamari but it was more grilled seasoned with a slight breaded crust. It was very good and filling. Entree - Vaca Frita al Caballo - steak was well seasoned and tender. Puerco Asado - pulled pork was a little bit dry. That's the only negative I would have to say about that dish. No room for dessert.  Had a great experience and would love to come back and try other entrees.,0,0,0,Dave K.,"Chicago, IL",269,181,508

4.0,1/12/2013,"Sangrias are solid, although I think the base blanco and rojo are substantially better than the numerous variants. Pisco sour was watery, lacking in flavor, although the froth was good and the bartender did try to match my specs on how I like it. We ordered a number of appetizers, rather than mains. I found the yuca fries bland, even with ketchup. Lobster empanadas, the ceviches, and the corn cake with ropas viejas on it (I am blanking on its name) were all quite good.Three stars because unfortunately, for all that is competent, it is priced at Upper West side hotel restaurant prices, i.e., super-high.

3.0,1/12/2013,"I'm pretty sure I'm going to say sangria in this review about 100 times, because this has to be the best sangria spot I've come across in NYC. Calle Ocho offers such a selection of sangrias it's crazy! And makes me giddy with excitement. Calle Ocho's location has changed and now resides in The Excelsior Hotel. Good move. Their traditional Cuban dishes pair well with all the drinks they offer. But I cannot stress enough! You have to get sangria. That's what Calle Ocho is all about to me. Their food was decent but I've had better. But when I tried the ""Havana Banana"" sangria I was hooked. I never drink a sangria in present day without having ""Havana banana"" come to mind. It haunts me. Concocted with coconut, bananas, lychees and coconut rum, this ""sangria blanca"" is genius. I love the slices of candied banana that float in the glass too. The fried yucca here is pretty good and would be a great side or snack with your drink.But if I were you I would eat before and come here and just try all the different types of sangria, there's nothing wrong with that. But hey, that's just me. I wish Calle Ocho had more of a tropical feel with authentic Cuban music playing, I think that would give it more quality. Other than that it's okay.

I love the skirt steak dish but now the steak is literally the size of a small deck of cards and the rice is like 6 spoonfuls.

The Vaca Frita was overly chewy and lacked seasoning. It could also be that i was decidedly less drunk since they got rid of the sangria bar... The sangria was good, fantastic in fact, and strong as always but with the switch to waiter service I couldn't help but feel cheated (I admit that this could be entirely a perception thing, but still). Not to mention that the entrees magically appeared within 5 minutes and before our sangria meaning again less sangria overall... Anyway, considering that it takes at least three weeks to get a reservation, I am quite comfortable nixing this from my list. Brunch is definitely not worth the fuss... On to the next one.P. S.

We all tried to take advantage of this... but some fared better than others. I managed to down four drinks: started off with the Tropical Sangria (mango, pineapple, lemongrass, passion fruit, rum) but it was just meh. Went for the Blana for my next three (fresh fruit and a splash of spirits) and was much happier. NH beat me with five drinks, but the winner was one of her friends with 7 drinks. How he did that, I do not know...You start off with delicious complimentary breads for the table, always a plus. For my entree, I ordered the Vaca Frita (cuban skirt steak, latin fried rice, tomato escabeche, avocado, fried eggs). Not only did it sound really good, but it tasted great as well. It may have something to do with the alcohol I was consuming, but I had a great time here. Drink and food were both good, and the decor here was nice as well.

4.0,12/14/2012,"Here's the thing. I'm in my mid-twenties and my expectations for a bottomless brunch are really low. Awful well drinks, Eggbeaters, 1 hour time limit, Sunburnt Calf low.So I was blown away when I first went to Calle Ocho (and continue to be impressed on too many visits back):-the drinks are strong and very tasty. Good variety too. Please don't try to drink one of each. I mean, try, but if you succeed, good God, you'll need a higher power to help.-the food is much better than expected and pretty damn tasty on its own. The tortilla espanola and vaca frita are particularly delicious.-the service is really good. The waiters are always walking around with refills and turn a blind eye when it takes a table of 4 an additional 45 minutes to eat the last half piece of toast.My recommendation: make reservations early and often.

My fondest memory would have to be my first time here (back at the old location where you could pour your own sangria); went with a big group, had the most amazing cuban sandwich & fries, and tried 6 of the 8 sangria flavors (sadly my goal of trying all 8 was cut short when I had to leave early for work, meh). Since then, I brought family, friends, you name it...and everyone loved the place. BUT. Although the food and service is still great as always (especially for how packed out it is during brunch), the sangria is sadly not what it used to be - at least in the case of my favorites - Havana banana and spanish harlem.

4.0,11/30/2012,"I'm embarrassed to admit that I've made several brunch reservations here but have failed to make them due to last minute emergencies and flakey friends. After the third try, I was determined to finally find out what the hype was all about. Our party size changed last minute (+1) but I didn't want to cancel once more so I called them and asked if it was okay the day of the reservation. They said to come by anyways and see if they can accommodate. Luckily enough, they accommodated our new size and seated within minutes of arrival.As seen in other reviews, the real highlight is the sangria. I thought the entree portion was a bit small and recommend ordering sides especially if you have big appetite like my group. I ordered the Cachapa de Salmon (essentially a smoked salmon crepe) and  a variety of sangrias. The dish was pretty good but I was still hungry so our group ordered a side of the garlic fries (yum!) and home fries (pass).Needless to say our party were pretty tipsy by the end of our meal. Calle Ocho is definitely one of the best booze brunches in the city especially given the price ($15 for entree and unlimited sangria) with the yumminess and best variety of the sangrias.

I particularly enjoyed the Tropical, which is light, refreshing, and served with huge chunks of mango. You're only allowed one glass at a time, but you won't be disappointed as the giant portion sizes pack a punch. Which leads me to their funny but oh-so-practical house rules which keep Calle Ocho fun without getting too rowdy. To help tame the rowdiness, Calle Ocho also offers pretty solid food. My friend and I shared the gallitos. For $28 we got more than enough eggs, chorizo, and other latin breakfast foods. While the entree was just fine, the bread basket here really shines. Make sure you try the cheesy bread (pao de queijo, I think?) Another word of advice, get reservations early, as in at least a month in advance.

1.0,11/25/2012,"Unfortunately not going back to this place.  First after making a reservation for their brunch they sat us 20 minutes late without an apology.  Then the waiter needed some customer service training.  Dropping the check without asking if there's anything else we wanted is not appropriate.  Less appropriate it is to talk back when we advised him we wanted coffee.  Then he brings back American coffee instead of what we wanted which was cafe con leche.  The kitchen needs a Spanish consultant for the Chef.  Serving a piece of skirt steak and calling it vaca frita! or serving a Cuban sandwich without mayonnaise, mustard or pressing the butter bread are simple obvious mistakes.  The worst was serving yuca frita with marinara sauce!!!!  The free choice of Sangrias for the brunch are good but you are at the mercy of the waiter's attentiveness.  At the end we left him a 10% tip and he claimed we left him a $1 and asked if there was a problem with his service.  When we said yes he just walked away and said have a nice day.  I am giving them one star because the Mexican busboy was kind enough when we wanted to return our coffee to apologize and insist on bringing us what we requested.",3,0,1,Manny L.,"South Ozone Park, NY",333,11,110

At other places you might expect subpar endless booze, but the sangria stood on its own as a great drink. The fruit inside the sangria was not alwAlays the same but it was always good fruit you would actually want to eat.The intro breadbasket was so delicious. Sticky sweet bread, restraint made donuts, chocolate chip muffins, and a killer strawberry butter to go along with it! SO GOOD!The menu was authentically tasting Cuban food and great quality. Fresh, superbly flavored, and great presentation. Bang for your buck all the way! We had a party of 6 and we each ordered different entres. I tasted each one, and would have been equally happy with any of them. I orders the steak and eggs. The eggs could have been a bit more runny, but the meat was tastey and just the right amount. I'm a sucker for good corn tortillas, and I just have to mention that there's are excellent. A little small, but they give you PLENTY.Then the desert... Oh man was it good! The chocolate cake came in the form of dominoes. If your a dominoes player like myself, you'll appreciate the attention to detail... Just great! I also sampled the tres leche cake and assorted ice cream... Everything just straight tastey!Here are the best aspects of my experience:1.) they accommodated my group of 6 with no reservation. Granted we were there right when they opened.2.) They stuck a candle in my fiancé's dessert and started up a round of happy birthday. It was a trick candle... We all had a great laugh.3.) it was so reasonably priced I felt compelled to pick up the bill for the table.4.) Clean, vibrant atmosphere, with comfy-as-f*#k chairs.5.)

3.0,11/9/2012,"Unlimited sangria for brunch!Came here for brunch after a looong night out, so it probably wasn't the best idea to come here the next day, especially if there's unlimited sangria.  They add a shot of something to all their sangrias so it's esepcially strong.  I wanted something lighter so I went for Blanca and that turned out to be one of the strongest... The Havana Banana was really good though.  Strong still, but refreshing at the same time. Calle Ocho provides all sorts of baked goods to start your meal.  The round bread reminds me of the cheese bread you get at Brazilian restaurants, and it was definitely my favorite.  The strawberry butter is a must!For the food, I got the Vaca Frita, which is Cuban skirt steak, Latin fried rice, tomato escabeche, avocado, and fried eggs.  Sounds amazing right?  It was pretty bland though.  The colors were vibrant so I was expecting flavors to pop, but it did not live up to how it looked.  My favorite were probably the eggs and the tomato escabeche, which is essentially seasoned and marinated tomatoes.I asked for hot sauce to add a little kick to my steak and the waiter brought out 3 types!  There's an orange looking one and it is probably made with habanero, cause it was surprisingly spicy.  Even the chipotle hot sauce in the back had a nice kick to it.  The pickled jalapeno was very good and I killed that little cup in a few bites with the steak.The Gallitos is for sharing, so 2 of my friends decided to get that.  Make your own breakfast tacos!  Comes with chorizo, scrambled eggs, homefries, and guacamole with other toppings.  It's a lot of food, but nothing was a standout.  Chorizo is less greasier than the Mexican chorizo I've had.I did like my friend's Cuban Sandwich.  Roasted pork, panela basted ham, Swiss cheese, and pickles. Juicy pork, and the panela (unrefined cane sugar) basted ham had a nice sweetness.  Nice crunch on the bread too from the press.  It comes with these chimichurri fries! A little different from the Argentinian chimichurri that I love but we like it so much that we ordered more on the side.Overall, it was just an average brunch.  I'm sure if I didn't go that hard from the night before, I would've enjoyed Calle Ocho a lot more, and took advantage of the unlimited sangria.  Great attentive service though!",1,0,1,Duke C.,"Torrance, CA",1032,1202,46

Our food came out within 7 minutes of us ordering. This would have been impressive at any other restaurant, but here, where they stop serving sangria once you finish your entree, it just seemed like they were rushing us so they would have to provide as little sangria as possible. The food was good, though. I was very happy with my omelette, and my friends enjoyed their ginormous burritos. We just did our best to pace ourselves, which took a considerable amount of self-control. One thing that truly deserves a mention - the bread basket they give you in the beginning is really good. The muffins are good, but the yuca flour bread is something else. We had to request another box because it was so good. On the sangrias, I believe all together we tried the Punta Cana, Tropical, Havana Banana, Fresa, Samba, and Roja. I think everyone agreed that Tropical was the best. Samba and Roja were good too.

2.0,10/8/2012,"There was a time when I would have given this place five stars. You buy one delicious entree and you also get unlimited sangria with your brunch. I've eaten  here at least ten times, but I think they've just gotten too popular for their own good. This past weekend I went there for brunch for the first time in months, and not for lack of trying. It used to be you could wake up on a Saturday morning and make a reservation for the next day. Now, if you don't call weeks in advance you're told by some snooty host that you'll need to and then you're hung up on.So this time I called about three weeks early and got a reservation for a Sunday afternoon. They were fairly speedy taking our drink order, but then they didn't bring them until after we'd been there for twenty minutes and already placed our food order. Some of us were given another round when our food arrived even though we'd asked maybe ten minutes prior. I'm a bit of a slow eater, so it's a big pet peeve of mine when people clear plates away before everyone is done eating. I've gotten used to it to some extent because, as I said, I'm a slow eater. But what I cannot believe is that they took my friends' plates and then asked if we wanted to see a dessert menu WHILE I WAS STILL EATING. I finished chewing, said no, not right now, I'm still eating, but we'd like another round of sangria. The waiter replies ""Oh, alright, I'll give you guys one more"" as if we were all drunk and he was humoring us. Meanwhile, I'm still eating, we've only had 1-2 drinks each, and the table behind us is so wasted they're shouting and standing on their chairs (note: they were already finished eating when we sat down and were allowed to continue sitting there/drinking until maybe ten minutes before we left). After we're given our last round of sangria, I finish my meal, and they immediately give us our check. We were still drinking our sangria, we had not asked for the check, and we were not offered a dessert menu again. I was with a group, so the process of dividing the bill takes a few minutes. While we are paying our bill the waiter comes back and says that they need to set up for dinner so we'll have to move to the bar. To finish paying our bill? Are you serious??I think I am being generous giving this place two stars right now. The food is good, so it can keep that second star. But I highly doubt I will be back.

The beef dishes can be chewy and fatty and the Creme Brulee tastes good (but the Madelines kill it and the brulee itself comes in a really shallow vessel, making one want to buy another) and they need to seriously reconsider their vanilla ice-cream choice, all of the guests at my table agreed that the vanilla didn't even taste like vanilla; it had an off-putting marshmellowy tinge to it that was not pleasant. I had to purchase a pint of vanilla Haagen Dazs just to get the taste out of my mouth and remember what vanilla ice-cream is supposed to taste like.Bottom-line: Go here cuz the Calamari alone is worth a visit.",1,1,0,AJ S.,"Riverdale, Bronx, NY",6,110,50

My complaints would be the sangria: EXTREMELY SWEET! we tried the havana, the strawberry one, the roja, and finally the acai one was the only one that wouldn't cause a diabetic comma.

We sat in really comfy pillow sofa chairs close to the TV because we didn't want to miss the U.S. Open either. There were four sangria flavors and although endless, you had to buy an entree which were priced ~$28+. So slightly pricey for bottomless fun :)  I tried 3 of the 4 and they were all red wine based. I would have liked to try a white wine mixed sangria but perhaps the 4th one was it and I missed it. Oh wells, till next time. The food was definitely very delicious and the portions were fairly adequate for dinner. The Cuban Skirt Steak was cooked medium well (I do not recall server asking for my preference but nonetheless delicious). To be frank, I can't comment further on the food as I pursued to fully capitalize on my endless sangria option.

There were actual large chunks of lobster not-so-hidden in there! And, I must say, the mix of the savory salmon combined with the mango chutney was--as Franklin mocked me for saying--""absolutely lovely"".Back to the sweets...Why not add a side of plantains--PLATANOS--to your dish? More sweet with savory is such a good choice!  SO YUMMY!Then--as I may have more than hinted earlier--you have to get dessert. Trust me, you'll want your own! SO GOOD!

The most economical with the largest proportion is the burrito filled with rice, meat, beans. Another good dish to order with the BOTTOMLESS SANGRIA is the Vaca Frita, Cuban steak with fried rice.

I tried 3 of the 4 white sangrias and I liked them all (blanca, havana banana, and tropical). They give very generous servings of sangria. The blanca was your standard white sangria. The tropical was my favorite- it had mango in it. The sangria was pretty strong too, not watered down at all. The ambiance was fun and colorful and we all really enjoyed our experience.

BUT, I got a coupon valid for Mon-Thur and they only have dinner available these days..it was still a good experience though!We came here on Tuesday night and I'm sure it was more tame than their weekend brunches. The server we had was incredibly helpful and nice and he seemed to have a thorough knowledge of the menu which, is impressive.Paella - HUGE portion. This plate could have fed 3 people so, even though it was pricey ($32), it wasn't bad for the portion you get. The paella came with pretty decent seafood, a huge lobster tail, mussels and clams as well as spicy chorizo, shrimp and chicken folded into the mix! The dish used a heavy amount of thyme which, kind of overpowered everything including the saffron and the rice was a bit undercooked so, though it was a good dish, I don't know if Calle Ocho is the appropriate place to try authentic Paella.Vaca Frita - Absolutely loved this dish! The pork fried rice was so flavorful and the pickled veggies it came with paired perfectly with everything else on the plate. The menu indicated it was a skirt steak so, I was thinking of a grilled, thin cut steak but, to our pleasant surprise it was actually slow braised which, was smart. Slow braising the steak kept it so tender which, you don't always get when you choose the alternative of grilling it. The meat was so tender that it be cut with our forks--nice! This is worth trying, people!Our meal was served with gluten-free bread prepared with yuka flour and a black bean dip. I loved the alternative uses of ingredients and it provided the dinner rolls with an interesting density..we really enjoyed it.

3.0,7/30/2012,"I've been wanting to check Calle Ocho out ever since they catered the Yelp Elite Event at the Empire State Building.  Boy, did they have some tasty treats there!Almost a year later, I was finally able to make it to during Restaurant Week and ordered the arepa app, carne entree and cocos dessert.  Since I dined there on a Sunday, I also got a glass of the Havana Banana sangria, compliments of the house.  Yipee!  It's all about Sangria Sunday!  Any entree comes with a glass of sangria of your choice. Unfortunately, the *deal* was the highlight of my meal.Of the three courses, the arepa was the best, by far.  Sweet, barbeque-like, pulled pork atop a corn cake and sprinkled with fresh onions and tomatoes.  Yum!  The carne, while cooked a perfect medium-rare, was tough and flavorless.  The only thing that gave it a little kick was the accompanying tomato and onion mix and corn salsa.  While the cocos dessert was pretty to look at, it too lacked in flavor.  The sangria was light on the alcohol and fruit.  I had a couple of stray pieces of coconut at the bottom that didn't taste like anything.  Even though it was served in a big glass, I didn't even get a buzz (and I'm a weak sauce).The presentation of everything was beautiful, they didn't skimp on the portions, and service was great.  Sadly, those three don't make up for the taste element, or I should say, lack thereof, which in my book is the most important.I'll be back one more time to try their notorious brunch to see if it's any better.",1,0,1,Sandee L.,"Discovery Bay, CA",235,494,105
4.0,7/30/2012,"I was excited to come here for brunch, especially for the unlimited free sangria! Place opened up at 12, Sat the restaurant filled up within minutes. I know they must have lots of regulars, some like to get nice to start off the day I guess. The waiter was polite and corteous, gave us the bread basket which was very nice touch, I loved the chocolate bread the best. My fiance appreciated the lively decor and background spanish music, was a nice touch, I just wish they had windows or something keeps me from feeling claustraphobic.The sangria came in large glass and we had good amount of choices between red and white. They were just strong enough to give it that kick I was looking for, unfortunately after one too many glasses I was definitely feeling it lol.

It's a fun place and good for a double date. Now down to the nitty gritty. The food was good, but could have, and should have been, better. The bread was AMAZING. I ate so much bread that I couldn't even finish my entree. Unfortunately, that was one of the only highlights of the meal. We got the grilled octopus as an appetizer and it was so tasteless that we had to make someone eat the last piece. The yuca fries were super hard like it was super undercooked. Thankfully my entree was much better. I had the salmon. One piece was a little dry, but the other piece was juicier. The lobster mash was good, but sadly I was just too full from bread that I couldn't finish it.  I had the Fresca Sangria which was good, but had a weird after taste.Service was slow throughout the night, but we got our check in record time.

I got the tropical one, with mango and pineapple and it was great. The desserts and coffee was good as well! Everything here was very fresh and flavorful.

4.0,7/26/2012,"A great AYCD brunch deal. The atmosphere is very laid back.  Our waiter Marcus was very friendly and decently quick with service.  We were waiting on a couple people, so after bringing us the bread basket, which was phenomenal, we got our sangrias first.  So the bread basket-- it's an assortment! There's a couple types of muffins, some cream-filled donut-like thing, a chocolate bread, and a mochi-stuffed bread.  Bread basket comes with a light strawberry butter.  Delicious.  I'm guessing it's to help the guests soak up the wine. They are very generous with that alcohol...the sangrias tend to/feel like they get stronger with each glass you order.  If you don't like the alcohol taste so much, they have a couple white sangrias that taste just like juice, depending on which glass you're on.  The Havana Banana is really good-- mostly lychee flavor, as is the Tropical, which tasted like passionfruit juice.  The Fresas from the red side is pretty yummy as well.  I got the Cachapa de Salmon..which was kind of a disappointment.  Why?  The tortilla was good, the eggs inside were fine but where was the salmon??? I had to concentrate to taste the salmon.  :/  However, the creme nata sauce it came with was delicious--soaked the rest of that up with the bread.  My friend's Vegetariano (mushroom paella) was good, kind of salty, but I don't think you can count it as a real paella.  The Quesadilla was a pretty standard one, and the Tortilla Espanola is a safe choice to go with as well.",2,1,0,Yifen J.,"Kyoto, Japan",320,363,167
5.0,7/26/2012,"There is two things you need to know about Calle Ocho.  One it is located in the Excelsior Hotel (just moved their recently) and two it is across from The American Musuem of Natural History.  So if you are as fascinated about history and things of wonder as I am then grabbing a bite to eat at Calle Ocho makes even MORE sense.          I came for their Sunday Brunch after reading great reviews on no other than YELP and a few word of mouths. KEY NOTE: MAKE RESERVATIONS as they are full to capacity almost always.  After my buddy overslept and left me hanging I decided to modify my reservation for 2 into 1.  Sadden by this I was quickly cheered up by excellent service provided by my waitress Shashona (I hope I spelled her name right) and the prospect of having to try 8, that's right 8 DIFFERENT kinds of sangria freshly made.  Alas, I only made it to 4 (lightweight =/).  But they are served by the 20 oz glass and after you finish one they bring you another quickly. My favorites sangrias so far are Havana Banana (light and just perfectly sweet), Tropical (tad stronger with slight bitterness which is perfect in my opinion), Spanish Harlem (dark fruity flavors bursting in your mouth, DEFINITELY a good choice), and Fresas (a mix of fruit that everybody seemed to love in reviews but I honestly prefer the Havana Banana and Spanish Harlem over Fresas anyday). And that is just the drinks folks!         Now comes the food, as you sit you are greeted with a small basket of freshly baked assorted bread with a side of Strawberry Butter (A MUST TRY, it is AMAZING).  My favs was the chocolate chip square bread.  I ordered the Pollo Ranchero which is like a fan of freshly pressed corn tortillas put together with black beans, chicken and scramble eggs. NOM NOM NOM!  But I wasn't completely full until I took a bite out of my next entree the Cuban sandwich.  C'mon, you have to order a Cuban sandwich at a Cuban restaurant, right?  Well I loved that decision as it came out perfectly pressed like a panini with ham, roast pork, cheese and pickles and to top it off with a side of Chimichurri fries.          I have a feeling that I will be making frequent trips to Calle Ocho for Brunch and to try out their dinner in the near future.",2,0,1,Anderson C.,"Queens, NY",1085,656,867

I tried the skirt steak and quesadilla. Both of which were decent but i think the skirt steak was worth the extra few bucks. There are 8 flavors of sangria, 4 red and 4 white. My favorites were the Tropical and Spanish Harlem. The drinks can be a little on the sweet side but I knew that's what I was getting in to when I came here.

I have a ""thing"" for great bread baskets, and Calle Ocho's was one that has been immortalized in my mind... just thinking about the sheer variety and types of breads (sweet! salty!) is enough to generate a Pavlovian response on my end.

3.0,7/10/2012,"I'm surprised at myself for not having reviewed Calle Ocho before! When I first moved to the city 2 years ago, this was our regular weekend go-to spot and I would've happily given them 5 stars. With completely affordable entrees and 8 varieties of self-serve sangria, how could you possibly go wrong??But alas, times have changed. Some biggg differences between the old and new Calle Ocho:- Relocated! I think by plopping themselves in a ritsy Central Park hotel lobby they thought they could up the class? Well I've got news for ya, pal. With all you can drink sangria, that's still never going to happen.- No more self serve sangria. Probably a function of too many drunk college students knocking over giant vats of sangria, but now you have to order your sangria from the waiter. They are generally pretty quick to bring you drinks, but you're not allowed to order a refill until you've finished your drink in hand. Rules, rules, rules. On the bright side, the drink quality hasn't deteriorated, so after your 4th or 5th glass you'll still be able to get your buzz on.- There are only 3 bathrooms. I mean...seriously?? When every person in the restaurant is pounding UNLIMITED sangria as quickly as possible, you really think 3 bathrooms are sufficient?Nevertheless, after 5 or 6 glasses of sangria and a slight altercation with the housewives-of-jersey-shore types sitting at the table next to us (though none of these fat wrinkly bimbos had wedding rings, so how ironic), we left Calle Ocho full, drunk, and belligerent.

I ordered my entree - a burrito, which came out in less than 5 minutes *side eye* Really 5 minutes was it sitting under a heat lamp in the kitchen or what??? When I asked the bartender about bread and why the food came out so quickly he told me ""It's crazy here because of brunch.""

5.0,7/7/2012,"YUM YUM YUM. I'd like to say that I've never heard of this place until the day before I went. Which probably will not happen to you because the reservations for brunch on the weekends literally takes two months. I came here with 5 others on a triple date, so maybe smaller tables will have faster reservations. But in any case, PLAN AHEAD!+1 Atmosphere and decor: very nice place here! not too loud, but loud enough for small groups to get together and have comfortable conversations. For a place with unlimited alcohol, I was surprised there weren't any obnoxious drunk people here. The lighting was good and the place was spacious. Decorations gave it a somewhat upscale feel, which surprises you when you take a look at the prices. I also love the colorfulness of everything they had, from wall decorations to the plates on your table. Bathroom was clean also! Great place to have fun without burning your wallet.+1 Service: I know some people mentioned that service can get a little crappy or slow if it's packed, but I went on a Saturday afternoon for brunch and my experience was great. The waiter was timely and took our orders with no confusion or mistakes. We ordered at least three rounds of drinks and even an additional bread basket. He was always very friendly and accommodating. No complaints here!+1 Food: UNLIMITED SANGRIA! Ahem. UNLIMITED FREE SANGRIA! They serve these in 20 oz glasses one at the time and they are SO GOOD. Such a refreshing and fruity taste to them. They had 8 choices when I went, 4 White and 4 Red. I didn't get to try all of them of course, but the three that I had were awesome. Definitely try the Havana Banana. It comes with lychee and coconut slices. I also had the Tropical (?) and the Blanca (?), which I recommend as well. The bread was delicious (I love bread) and came with strawberry butter. I ended up eating this most of the brunch cause my entree wasn't awesome, which I didn't mind cause the bread was just that good. For the entree, I got salmon crepes, but the egg taste was overwhelming and I didn't taste salmon at all. I'd recommend you NOT to get this if you do go to brunch. I tried some of my neighbors dishes, and they were actually really delicious. i.e. the steak entree was really good, and also the fries that came with the cuban sandwich were also delectable. The desserts we ordered (dark chocolate cake and flan) were also pretty good, and worth a try if you're not stuffed already.+1 Price: For what you get, the prices are great. At first, I thought the sangrias would be free refills, but it is in fact ALL free. Entrees came out to 15-20 a dish, which may be expensive for brunch, but it's definitely worth it if you think about all the drinks you are not paying for. Our bills came out to around 25 a person, which is not bad at all. Great stuff for the price.+1 Overall: I had a great experience here! My brunch was at 2:00 so it wasn't extremely packed, since they close at 3PM to prepare for dinner customers. But the service and food were still great and I was amongst good company.

I had the arepa con carne and the duck with platano amarillo which was the sweet component that usually compliments thr duck... The dish also had lentils... Very classic French stuff with some fushion. My girl had a shrimp and avocado dish and the paella that is meant to serve a family of 5 lol. Thanks for not saying that on the menu  ;-) ..

4.0,7/3/2012,"I've been here three times for brunch now. The food has actually improved since moving to the Excelsior Hotel -- the first two times I went my meals were uninspiring. As everyone says, the highlight of brunch is the sangria bar. Some changes with the move: the sangria bar is no longer self-serve, so you have to ask your waiter for the drinks. This change helps mitigate the chaos which would otherwise erupt in the restaurant, but it'd be helpful to leave a sangria menu at the table so we don't have to memorize the different options. Another tip: NEVER order the side of avocado. It's basically 6-8 slices of fresh avocado, served on a plate. It's really not worth it, and every time I see people order it I cringe. The chipotle chicken quesadilla is a solid choice, and it probably has more avocado in the guacamole than the avocado side. The tortilla espanola is a healthier choice. The tortilla itself is the size of a pie slice, but the eggs + potato go nicely with the sauce -- didn't taste much crab though.",1,0,1,Elizabeth L.,"New York, NY",240,816,249

Whether you have a rez or not (you should have one, I learned), be prepared for a packed brunch. The doors opened finally and were able to seated right away-which is a huge plus, but if you want to sit in the dining room, you need to have made a res. We had two choices- to sit at the bar, or lounge- which was fine by us! We sat at the bar and looked at the menu. Be sure to read on the right side that they DO serve free sangria in 20oz glasses one at a time. They have a few varieties for you to choose from- we both chose the fresa, per our server's rec. It was pretty sweet and alcoholic because I got drunk fast! I'm also a light weight. I enjoyed the lightly infused strawberry in the Sangria.Another great freebie was the bread basket- it's been said, but the strawberry butter is amazing!  You get corn muffins, doughy, sweet, butter rolls, and blueberry bread. This was pretty awesome!Onto food- my friend ordered the Cuban sandwich, which she had to take home since it was big! She ate one half here, and packed one half. I don't eat ham so I didn't try it but I did try the well-done, crunchy, garlic, parmesan fries which was DELICIOUS. :DI had the Pollo Ranchero, which was an interesting brunch mix of things- pulled chicken slathered with black beans, chili sauce, a crunchy tortilla, cheese, and a thin layer of egg. It all flowed well together actually- it wasn't the best dish I ever had ( the sauce was a bit sour) but it was tasty! Although I didn't get to see the dining room, decor seemed lounge-y more or less. The bar was comfortable enough but don't expect servers to be very attentive- it took a while to get our check, etc, and we didn't get any waters! (Sangria only). On the bright side, they often asked us if we wanted refills and the food came out fast.In the end, I totally recommend Calle Ocho for a unique brunch experience.

It's amazing!Checking in on Yelp will score you a free glass of sangria, which is awesome, especially considering the tastiness of their sangrias (8 different kinds, 4 red, 4 white). I opted for a (large!) glass of the Banana Havana sangria, which was refreshing and sweet. Loads of lychees at the bottom. And quite strong. Not sure how people can finish an entire carafe (5-6 servings), but I suppose it's do-able! The round rolls that they give you with the black bean spread are delicious. But save room for their spectacular ceviches! You can choose 4 different ceviches with the sampler platter. I was able to try the Huachinango (snapper, cucumber, mango, papaya, cilantro, lime), Hondureño (ahi tuna, coconut milk, pickled jalapeños), Mixto (a mix of seafood, obvi), and the Escalopes (scallops and goodness). They were all really delicious, and actually really filling. You may not have room for more after this! But if you do, their camarones appetizer (Puerto Rican rum glazed hrimp, surrounded by a crispy onion, on top of an avocado 'salad'... which looked more like fancy guac to me, lol) is phenomenal. So is their skirt steak dish... everything about it, from the Latin rice, to the tomato escabeche, to the runny egg (if you like it!), was perfection. Yum. Yum. Yum.Our watiress was super cute and bubbly, and she made the entire experience that much more enjoyable. I really liked the Latin music playing in the background, as well as the bright, fun colours of the restaurant itself.

Sangria is brought to your table which means they can monitor your drink intake and there's a strict two hour limit for each party. Less roudy, more organized but not as much fun. Glasses are 20 oz. to start which is a TON of sangria but still doesn't have the same feel. I get why they did it, but doesn't mean I have to love it. Menu and sangria selections are the same.

I was so buzzed afterwards that I flopped down on the grass in nearby Central Park and didn't move for an hour.So why not give them 4 or 5 stars, you say? Well, the food was kind of blah.

2.0,6/18/2012,"Yes...Calle Ocho has a great brunch deal - 8 lovely tempting exotic sangrias to choose from that are bottomless with the price of your entree.  But man oh man... our entrees were so disappointing!  My cuban sandwich looked  pathetic, with a few strips of meat barely filling the bread.  How can you F up a Cuban sandwich at a Cuban Restuarant?  I don't even understand. Perhaps they thought I was wasted enough not to notice- they were right about the wasted part but SO WRONG to even serve me that mess. My fiancé ordered the vaca frita and it left plenty to be desired as well.  On more than one occasion we were left hanging with an empty glass.  I understand it's busy but hellllllllllllllo - this is the sole reason we came to your establishment in the first place!Only thing saving this place is the sangria selection and the crack bread with strawberry butter.",1,2,0,Marina R.,"Boston, MA",152,236,19
5.0,6/14/2012,"For getting his mother drunker than he's ever seen her before, this place deserves 5 stars from our brunch boozing hero.  Bottomless sangria at brunch here is a deceptively strong killer that goes down so smooth.The complimentary bread basket was warm, sweet, and flavorful.  Their Cuban sandwich was on point and exceptionally well done.  The Frita Cubana burger with a pork and beef blended patty is a bit on the dry side, but still pretty tasty.  Their brunch menu overall was really good and was well received by our hero and his entire family.  All those freshly made 20 ounce glasses of sangria certainly helped too.It seems like they're trying to promote more patrons here on weekdays, because our hero's server even gave him $80 in gift certificates for use on Mondays-Thursday for free.PROS:- Located half a block away from Central Park and a subway stop.- Attentive and polite hosts and service staff.- Excellent Cuban fusion food.- Unlimited sangria while you eat during brunch.- 8 different types of tasty sangria available.  Hats off to you if you manage to have all 8 during the course of a meal.CONS:- The wait is pretty long for weekend brunch if you get there late.- You're cut off on the drinks as soon as you finish your entree, so you better eat slow and enjoy it.",7,5,4,Albert W.,"Bellevue, WA",749,758,949

4.0,6/8/2012,"Restaurant is located inside a hotel and is easy to miss - even once you're in the hotel. But once through the restaurant's doors, you're enveloped by their decor and friendly and personable host staff. We were seated immediately - despite being about 10 minutes late - and the wait staff was at our table within the first two minutes of being seated. Their complimentary bread is aMAzing. It wasn't like anything I've had before, and best way to describe is that it reminded me of a dessert but in bread form. Needless to say, it peaked my interest.Anyway, back to the review. A delicious Chicarron (deep fried rock shrimp glazed with sweet and source sauce) appetizer was shared and my boyfriend and I ordered Costillas and Bistec, respectively, for our main course. The sauce that accompanied my steak was tasty and its side salad of watercress, red onion and tomatoes complimented the steak's flavor well. My boyfriend liked the flavor of his ribs but said the ribs had too much fat for him. Drinks wise, we ordered a pitcher of their mojito sagria and I would return to this restaurant time and again for this drink. The only thing that caused me pause was the number of people in their wait staff. Now, the men in their staff all wear the same shirt but in different colors. After our bread was dropped off, a man - in a blue shirt - came by and asked for our drink order. A few minutes later, another man - this time in an orange shirt - delivered our drinks and asked if we had any questions. Meanwhile I saw the man with the blue shirt walking and looking at our table like he's determining if we're ready to place our order. Finally, I had to ask the orange shirt man if he or the blue shirt man was our waiter for the evening. Was just a bit confusing and I think it could've been avoided if some sort of intro (Hi, my name is X and I'm working with Y to help you tonight.) was shared.

4.0,5/29/2012,"Having lived in this area for a long time, I can't believe it took me so long to come here. This is easily becoming one of my favorite brunch spots and I knew that from just one visit. After dining here twice already, I felt good enough about Calle Ocho to sing its praises. I'm no heavy drinker but even I can appreciate a brunch that includes complimentary unlimited sangria of eight different varieties to choose from! Of course, they will cut you off if you become belligerently noisy and can't hold your liquor. Rightly so. For they do have their rules here. The place is very popular so be sure to book reservations for the brunch well in advance or be prepared to wait in line. I was also amazed at the amount of interior space that this restaurant has. When you sit at a table here you are not rubbing elbows with the table next to you like a lot of places. I have been here before and have tried several of the items on the menu. The food is above average and well prepared but it's obvious that the main reason that people come to the brunch is for the sangria. I'd have to say my favorite sangria is the Havana Banana. I don't normally lean towards white sangria but I'm a sucker for anything with coconut. There are some varieties that are good and some that are a little questionable or syrupy but the waiter was happy enough take a drink back for a new one. I know everyone assumes they are going in here thinking they will be able to try all eight varieties but the sad reality is the you would be too plastered to even attempt that feat. Plus they would probably stop you before you would do so. Like I said before, the food is done pretty well here. The free bread basket that they give you is fantastic. The yucca bread was probably the tastiest of the bunch. When we first came here we had the Gallitos, which is a platter of chorizo, scrambled eggs, flour tortillas, and several other fixins. The platter is so huge that it's meant to serve two people. I've also ordered the breakfast burrito here, but I found it to be a little too small. The Cuban sandwich was as tasty as I expected as were the chicken quesadillas. I highly recommend getting the Cocos for dessert, which is the coconut ice cream served in a chocolate shell. I'm sure I will be back here again because of the unique brunch that Calle Ocho offers. Despite the free sangria I've always managed to walk a straight line after dining here. This place is not for the irresponsible or easily enabled but you will have a good time.",2,1,2,Evan M.,"Manhattan, NY",96,320,158

3.0,5/21/2012,BRUNCH REVIEW ONLY:Things have really changed here for brunch at the new location.  All the rules.  The minute you're done eating they won't give you any more sangria.  And not to sound like a lush but before it was unlimited serve yourself and now you have to wait for the waiters to bring it.  They are very slow.  I had ONE glass before our bill came and as we were going to pay we asked for a final round and they said no because we weren't ordering more food.  While we were still eating we did ask for a second round and it never came.This place became too popular and out of control with reservations so they started speeding things up to get you out of there.  used to be such a nice leisurely weekend brunch spot but not anymore.  I took away a star.   I want to give it 2 but the food is still good and i imagine this is just a brunch problem not a dinner service problem.,3,0,0,Keiko C.,"Queens Village, NY",30,104,0

The pulpo was grilled octopus, which is not my favorite type of seafood, but it was interesting. The gallitos were excellent! The carne asada was particularly my favorite, served with steamed mini corn tortillas. My favorite appetizer would have to be the camarones, which were Puerto Rican glazed shrimp in an avocado salad. Even the bread and black bean butter was phenomenal. YUM!The sangria blanca is also a great drink choice to enjoy with all this food! It was made with raspberries, strawberries, and peaches.

4.0,5/15/2012,"I came here this past friday for my friends birthday dinner and I would have to say that the place is very nice. I never came before it was renovated but whatever renovations they did was a great job. The place is inside a hotel but its not hard to miss because as soon as you walk in its right there. The decor of the place is very nice but the place is quite dim. It is a great place to go on a first date or with your loved one. They have spanish music playing at a moderate level in the background. The service was great. The waitress was very nice and we didn't feel rushed out even though we stood there for 2 1/2 hrs. Now onto the food, It was very good but not excellent.  I had the pollo peruano and the majority of the people at my table had the skirt steak. Everyone that had the steak said it was very good and I really don't have any complaints about my chicken.  The food had a very fancy setup to it which was very nice to look but only lasted that way for about 5 seconds before I devoured my food lol. The birthday girl had vaca frita but she wasn't that pleased with it.  I also had a big pitcher of the fresas sangria which had strawberry, blueberries, raspberry's and raspberry vodka. It was extremely good. No one got dessert except the birthday girl but the dessert was average like any other chocolate cake with ice cream.  Overall I would say the whole dinning experience was good and maybe one of these days if I'm in the area again I'll come back.",0,0,0,Natasha S.,"Bronx, NY",29,62,60

Alas, the bread/strawberry butter hasn't changed, and the quality of the Vegetariano mushroom paella was wonderful.

4.0,5/1/2012,"I honestly thought I was going to be cut off when I learned that Calle Ocho serves bottomless sangria during the course of your brunch. However, after having not eaten all day and partaking in the Parkinson's Unity Walk, I was more hungry than thirsty. As a result, I overindulged in the delicious bread basket (corn muffins, chocolate chip bread and strawberry butter... how could I resist??), leaving little room for much sangria. We had the Burrito Sucio, Vegeteriano (veggie paella) and Frita Cubana burger and all of the food was delicious. My favorite sangria (and quite possibly the best I've ever tasted) was the Havana Cubana with fresh coconut and lychees. The reddish ambiance is warm and inviting and our waitress was attentive even though the place was packed. Next time, I will make sure to pace myself better when it comes to the food, so I can try each sangria flavor (there are 8) and get properly cut off.

3.0,4/19/2012,"I loved their old location... with the sangria table... oh the sangria table I miss thee!The new spot is a windowless space in a hotel. Food is still the same but the sangria table is gone! Which means your unlimited consumption is at the mercy of your waiter. Oh and the place is perpetually packed... you do the math!Things I love about the place:1) The bread basket served once you sit down... Yummy, warm and diverse. The strawberry butter is awesome as well. I can probably have 3 baskets of this by myself. 2) Sangrias are strong and tasty... many unique flavors to choose from. However, now without the sangria table you should consider yourself lucky if you sangira comes with fruit. 3) Taco cart- a bit gimicky but hey they are tasty and curb your hunger as you wait for your food to arrive which could be a while. Things I could change:1) Food is just ok... a bit bland... nothing to write home about. Having said that the protions are generous and hey eggs can only be so exciting right? 2) BRING BACK MY SANGRIA TABLE! (did I complain about this already)?3) Reservations are hard to come by so plan accordingly. I have never gone without one so I cant speak of how long the wait is.

4.0,4/14/2012,"Brunch at Calle Ocho is always fantastic.  No one remembers the food, but the drinks are memorable (even if its not the individual drinks, but rather drinking as a whole).  Saturday and Sunday brunch at Calle Ocho comprises of brunch and unlimited sangria for 2 hours. Now beware, Calle Ocho is a place which wont seat your till your entire has arrived, which I think is the silliest thing.  If you want to place a two hour limit for drinks, but seat us.  Don't start counting the time when our reservation was scheduled but refuse to seat us until the entire party is accounted for.Calle Ocho has the one of the best beard baskets ever.  I don't know what is was, but it was baked goodness.  Our bread came in a cigar box, and the little breads / muffins peaked out from the top, accompanied by a strawberry butter.  Yum.Most important are the drinks at Calle Ocho, unlimited sangrias for 2 hours.  WE actually went through at 8 since there were 4 of us - blanca, Havana Banana, Mojito, Tropical, Roja, Fresas, Spanish Harlem, Mulata.The new location now requires you to order the sangrias rather than a self serve bar, so be savvy and know where your waiter is so you can get a quick refill at all times :)For lunch, we had the Vegetariano, Vaca Frita, and Tortilla Espanola.  Food was decent, though the real standout were the drinks.We ended up passing our 2 hour limit, and the waiter offered us seats at the bar to continue the festivities.  We took him up on that and ended up hanging out with Nicholas and Tony at the bar for another hour and a half.  After our leisure 3 hour brunch, we decided to take a stroll in Central Park.  It's 70 and gorgeous, and hope your day was as fabulous!Same Review, with picturestravelmonkeybites.tumblr…",3,0,1,Linda W.,"New York, NY",39,421,124

The food is the same and still good - i've tried the breakfast burrito, chicken quesadilla, and most recently the flank steak. nothing amazing, but all solid choices. one loss was at the old location they also had a taco truck that went around the dining room serving chicken, steak, or pork tacos to start the meal. they also still have 'unlimited' sangria during your meal.  they start serving you when you sit down and will continue as long as you are eating. there are approx 4 white and 4 red types to choose from (and you can switch your choice each time). we were concerned that a potential downside could be slow service (meaning less drinks during brunch) but our server was fantastic. turns out i actually prefer not having to get up and get my own drink since he did such a good job. this is a great way to kick off the weekend. though i would recommend you visit on saturday so you have sunday to recover from all the fun you will likely have during and after you finish brunch!",0,1,1,Christina H.,"Manhattan, NY",54,533,110

I had a few of the white sangrias and it wasn't really that strong so 3 glasses went down easily. The place itself is nice. Almost a scene, really. It's a flashy Nuevo Latino hot spot so it can get a bit loud. The service was pretty good and we were able to get a table even without a reservation.

3.0,3/28/2012,"I didn't know but apparently this place is extremely popular that you had to make reservations weeks or months ahead of time.  That's all due to the unlimited sangria served during their brunch hours. Being not such a big drinker in general, it had no effect on me but I wouldn't mind trying some place new. The restaurant is inside the Excelsior Hotel. It appears to be a bit on a fancier side for a Cuban/Spanish restaurant, but price-wise for brunch, it's not too shabby at all ($ 14-18 plus unlimited sangria).  So I ordered the Cuban sandwich, which had roast pork, roast ham and cheese. Quite frankly, it wasn't as good as I imagined it would be. It was bit dry and didn't had much flavor to it. The sandwich portion was huge so I could only eat half of it. It also came with a side of chimichurri fries, which they overdosed on the salt and pepper.  I actually enjoyed the bread basket more, which came in assortments of fresh and warm bread and biscuits. Overall, if you enjoy sangria (and can drink a lot), this place is well worth it. But if you're here to try out the food, it's pretty average.",0,0,1,Rowena Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",480,1179,549

Not to mention the unlimited sangrias (at least 6 different flavors) and a list of house rules asking that you please not force the server to cut you off (hilarious). I had the Tropical white sangria and loved it! Food was okay. I ordered the Vaca Frita, which was nothing to write home about. I prefer dinner here. Service was great, and they accommodated extra people to ur table reservation. The new location inside the Excelsior Hotel is beautiful. You don't need a reservation at the bar or lounge area, which makes things easier.

I had the calamari frito which is like fried calamari but sweetened with honey.  The batter isn't light and crispy like most fried calamari dishes but it definitely has a good crunch. For my entree I had the spice rubbed salmon with lobster mash, cucumber relish, and mango chutney. The salmon was tasty but I didn't get much of the lobster in the mash.

I had the quesadilla as my meal. It was the perfect size for one and really good. My friend's had the burgers and they enjoyed those as well. The drinks were good too. The only downside was the restaurant was EXTREMELY noisy. I felt like I had to shout to talk to my friends. We also made a reservation but still had to wait a few minutes. Overall it was good.

Brunch is only served from noon to 3 so I would recommend making reservations. I opened the menu to find a list of I think 10 types of UNLIMITED sangria included with any entrée. I was sold on the concept but skeptical about the quality of the sangria... I had no need to fear, for the sangria was delicious and strong (no Little-Italy-sangria-juice served at Calle Ocho!). I tried two of the red sangrias and they were excellent. The atmosphere was also great. Bright colors and an interesting layout! Music was a little loud so might be best to go with a smaller group so you can actually hear each other talk. The bar looked nice so that's an option too for those who show up without reservations. The food was also delicious. When I mentioned to the waiter that I don't eat meat he said that the vegetarian entrée was one of the best on the menu, and he was not wrong. It was delicious: wild mushroom with rice and topped with creamy avocado and a crispy salad of green beans and red onion. YUM. Definitely will be going back soon!

I really enjoyed the calamari, bacon wrapped dates, and large prawns. Oooh, and I agree with Lizi, lobster empanada was awesome.  This sampler was more than plenty for 3 people! I had a lychee sangria which was soo refreshing and light. My friends ordered the lubina and carne for dinner, and from what I tasted, they were fantastic. I had the special which was salmon with lobster/ potato pancakes on a bed of spinach. Though the salmon was cooked perfectly, I have to be honest, there was just too much fried goodness there, and not enough fresh flavor with pan seared/fried salmon/ fried potato-lobster cakes with a mustard sauce on a bed of cooked spinach. Ambiance: Loved the feel of the restaurant, and all the warm and vibrant colors, and spacious too. We were lucky enough to get a cozy booth having only called 30 minutes prior to reserve a table.  Great place to hang out with a larger group for cocktails and tapas.Service: Our waiter was awesome, and I enjoyed all of his recommendations (except for the salmon special... ;)..)Overall, I had a wonderful evening and would go there again next time I'm visiting friends in the city.",1,1,1,Maria M.,"Boston, MA",80,169,220

5.0,2/21/2012,"A nice open space with good food and friendly staff tucked away in what, at first glance, seems like the corner of just another hotel overlooking the Museum of Natural History.  Besides the friendly smiles, you're greeted with the black bean spread while you wait, which proved to be maddeningly delicious. I decided that a glass of tampranillo should accompany the spread and I found myself happily content before the dishes even arrived.I went for restaurant week with my girlfriend for dinner, so I missed out on the vibrant brunch scene, but that did not dampen the awesomeness of the sangria Calle Ocho is known for; how could I not try it? The fact that I forget what appetizer I had attests that it was neutral while my girlfriend's ceviche was almost unbearably spicy, although the dish is supposed to be as such so there can't be much complaint regarding the degree. The steak atop a little pseudo pie of roasted peppers/tomatoes and drizzled with sauce made the carnivore in me rejoice with glee. We finished the prix fixe with seemingly simply scoops of ice cream in exotic flavors like passion fruit.All they need to do now is move the men's bathroom to the front where the women's are located instead of the farthest reach past the kitchen. On the other hand, even the open presentation of the kitchen behind a chest-high fixture of frosted glass mixed with a utilitarian counter-top at which the waiters await your food to make its transition from the chef's hands is interesting to behold as you pass by.

With drinks and 3 courses it ended up being $120 for two. This was my first time at their new location. I liked it, but it lost some of the grandeur of the Columbus Ave location with its super high ceilings and absolutely open dining room. It looked very small in comparison. I think overall they cut down their space by half. The service and food were absolutely impeccable, as they usually are. I was there on a date and we were afforded plenty of privacy by sitting on the mini 2 person booths. The only thing that annoyed me was the overhead lamp which hung almost right next to my face. It just made it awkward. I tried to forget about it and after a while (and some sangria) I did and continued enjoying my date.

The lights are just dim enough, the service so calculated and impeccable, and the food so masterfully conveyed from start to finish that I could have been on the set of ""Pretty Woman"" and wouldn't know the difference. (or maybe I've just always wanted to play a Latin Julia Roberts).  The hum of conversation is just loud enough that you never forget you're in the company of other people, but soft enough that you and your date are center stage, and can plan the feisty evening that will probably commence once you and your date get back upstairs (the restaurant is situated inside the Excelsior hotel, which is $219 on a Friday night - not that I asked or anything).  We got the ""Arepa"" appetizer to start, which was a sweet corn cake topped with ropa vieja, and drizzled with a cream sauce.  Delicious.  For dinner I ordered the pork porterhouse, which was absolutely huge and topped with just-salty enough sauteed collard greens.  My date got the Vaca Frita al Caballo, which was a skirt steak topped with pork rice, a fried egg and an avocado salad.  We were beyond satisfied with our meals, (our forks went back and forth into each other's plates for most of the night) but went for the Banana Tres Leches cake for dessert, which was sweet and flavorful.  Talk about a metaphor...I must also warn you, the signage of the restrooms is a bit perplexing.  There is a photo of Lucille Ball, (or was it Marilyn Monroe? sangria makes facial recognition challenging) on BOTH of the restroom doors.  In a bit of a drunken haze, I chose the more feminine looking Lucy, rationalizing that of course that had to be the women's bathroom, when upon leaving the area, was told by the maitre'd that the bathrooms are unisex.  Duh.  Told you this place was scandalous. ;)",3,2,3,Jen G.,"Staten Island, NY",230,215,9

2.0,1/17/2012,"My previous review reflected the Calle Ocho dinner experience. Several weekends ago, I visited Calle Ocho for lunch, expecting to enjoy the same food quality and elegance. Life often does not go according to plan, and my friend and I found ourselves at a noisy (not in the festive sense, but rather in the chaotic sense) restaurant with slow service (although friendly and smiling) and a very limited food menu that reflects none of the creativity or quality of the dinner menu. Not only were the portions small, but we had problems with inconsistency in the food temperature. Also, the yuca was dry and stringy. ¡Error fatal!  The appeal of the brunch is the unlimited sangria. If you go to brunch with the purpose of getting drunk on over-sweetened sangria, then you'll find happiness here.

3.0,1/10/2012,"Five stars for the old Calle Ocho, three stars for the new. Calle Ocho recently moved into a new space in the Excelsior hotel, and a lot more changed than just the location. Instead of a self serve sangria bar with 8 choices at brunch, they now have seven and you have to order it through your server. It's still complimentary, but you can't just get up and get a new glass at your convenience. They also have drafted a list of rules such as one glass of sangria at a time, and you have to stay within their time limit, although they don't specify what that is but will ""let you know if you are approaching it.""They still give you the amazing assortment of breads with strawberry butter when you sit down, and the entrees are still pretty tasty and a decent price (esp since they come with free sangria). They have the same, latin-american menu, and I usually get the burrito with eggs, beans, and chorizo inside. It's always delicious but the cheese on top wasn't melted this time and they could have been a little heavier handed with the salsa. The sangria was decently strong and tasty as always but the new system posed a problem since our server wasn't the best. He would disappear for long periods of time, so we had to wait forever for a new glass, and they only put two pieces of the boozy fruit in each. We also asked him for several things which he said he would bring and just never did. This used to be a favorite for brunch but terrible service and new ""rules"" considered, I may take my business to one of the other hundreds of boozy brunches in the city.",0,0,1,Christina P.,"Philadelphia, PA",270,243,4
1.0,1/7/2012,"**AVOID THIS RESTAURANT. (for now)I'm sorry, but this place is just ALL bad. We got there and asked for a table for eight and were told that it was booked. Our friends really wanted to try it, so we ate in the bar area and it was a horrible experience. Not only was the food mediocre, but the place was not booked at all. We ate very uncomfortably (across 5 or 6 little lounge tables, with none of our plates able to fit and the fear of something falling throughout the entire meal, but when I got up to go to the restroom I confirmed that there were over 10 tables that could fit our party of eight that were there when we arrived... completely empty!I remember when the chef/owner (Alex Garcia) used to be a visible presence at the restaurant - when they first opened and were on Columbus. I actually have followed him from Miami's Yucca (I was at the opening) to his move to NY to head Phil Suarez's restaurant Latin Fusion restaurant (name forgotten... and I was at that opening) and even at the opening (or within a week) of Calle Ocho at their last location. As a Cuban... we tend to be pretty loyal that way with each other... but Alex has let us down.I have avoided Calle Ocho for the last 5 or 6 years, because they have delivered a consistent LET DOWN in service every time I go. I try every once and a while and always am disappointed. As Cuban-American, it is disheartening to me to show up and watch as the hostesses and manager ruin what should be a signature ""Alex Garcia"" experience that they should be offering. Believe it or not, that used to mean something once.FYI... Thank God that there is now ""Amor Cubano"" in NY, a great little restaurant that is delivering amazing Cuban Cuisine and ambiance on no less than 111th and 3rd Avenue. Go figure. We would really be hurting for real Cuban cuisine in NY right about now.I thin that Alex needs to reassess his hires and get out of the back like he used to do. ""Alex!

5.0,1/7/2012,"First thing I told my friend when first sitting down here was, ""we are trying every sangria on the list."" We nearly managed to accomplish this feat, which I think is pretty impressive considering there were only two of us and eight sangrias on the list, each served in a 20oz glass. This has been by far my favorite boozy brunch experience. The space is upscale and spacious. You won't be rubbing elbows with your neighbor as you will at many other brunch places. They take reservations! (Which is nice because I refuse to wait three hours to eat). The staff is courteous and friendly. We never had an empty glass on the table. We got water, bread and food all served within a reasonable amount of time. I never felt rushed by anyone. Our waiter even encouraged us to get one more round when we were ready for the check! I got the quesadilla and my friend got the brunch burger I believe. The quesadilla was really good. Not the best I ever had but I enjoyed it and finished the whole thing. I'm not a fan of tomatoes and there were large chunks of them inside. I saw the platter for two go by while we were there. That looked very good! My friend enjoyed his, finished the whole thing. O and the biscuits and muffins served before the meal were great too! They even served them with strawberry butter which is one of my favorite brunch items.

3.0,1/3/2012,"Located in the lavish 4-star Excelsior Hotel in the Upper East Side, walking into the upbeat, vivacious atmosphere of Calle Ocho is a contrast like no other. When I considered and juxtaposed the calm, ostentatious and declamatory elements of the Excelsior with the boisterous merriment that takes place within Calle Ocho, I was in a temporary state of bewilderment. It just seemed so wrong. Notwithstanding, my personal issues with the current culinary trend to absurdely meld formality and informality together were quickly forsaken after downing a glass of the Spanish Harlem, a delicious red sangria, with impasioned delight.  Our evening began at the bar while waiting for two more individuals in our dining party to arrive. The bar is very active, to say the least. Thankfully, the fast-paced environment is something that the Calle Ocho mixologists have mastered; they're quite efficient and on point. As previously mentioned, I loved my Spanish Harlem. My dining companion wasn't as thrilled with his selection (the Havana Banana?), but with so many flavors to choose from, finding a sangria that suits one's tastes precisely may be a process of trial and error. But for only $8 a glass, that task could make for an enjoyable late afternoon or evening without punishing the wallet too terribly.  I suppose I got lucky with my first choice.After being seated and perusing the menu, the four of us decided to start with the Pulpo ($14), an appetizer of octopus served with a chick pea puree, chorizo, and chilli oil. What an unmitigated travesty! While the octopus was prepared properly, and the flavors married well together, the portion size was utterly appalling. Served on an elongated white serving dish, five or six miniscule tentacles were beautifully showcased amid an attractive garnish and the aforementioned accompanying sauce. The one tentacle that I had the pleasure of putting in my mouth was delicious, but, sadly, it only managed to piss my impatient stomach off further. One measly tentacle was not going to come close to tempering the hunger I had amassed throughout the afternoon. I was aghast that the waiter didn't recommend an appetizer that would have gone a little further, especially considering the size of our party. I'm an octopus connoisseur, and that is one of the most disappointing servings of octopus I've encountered to date.For my entrée, I employed the assistance of the waiter to provide his recommendations. He advised that the Vaca Frita al Caballo ($24), cuban skirt steak atop a Latin pork fried rice, was a signature dish of Calle Ocho, and a popular one at that. Indeed, the dish was downright spectacular. I loved every bite. The only problem is that I could have easily consumed another portion of the Vaca Frita. While walking out of Calle Ocho, after our group spent well over $200, my companion and I both looked at each other and confessed that we were both still hungry. So, off to a Jewish deli we went where we both shared an obscene, two-pound reuben sandwich. I'll be honest, I have a large appetite. Nevertheless, there have only been rare occasions where I've left restaurants hungry after finishing an entree. Calle Ocho, sadly, managed to become a statistic representing one of those rare occasions. It's a dastardly offense, one of the worst that can be committed against me.2.5, but I'm rounding up to 3.",4,4,3,Gary R.,"San Diego, CA",826,721,1896
2.0,1/2/2012,"I came here on New Years day for brunch with friends and was completely surprised that the place wasn't very packed. I had attempted to come to the new location at the Excelsior for brunch a few Sundays back, and had no such luck getting seated as the place was jam packed, so I'm assuming that a lot of people were away for the holidays. Either way it was great for us. We got seated immediately and ordered just as fast. Again, I had the vaca frita which the server told us already comes ""pre-made"" and cooked as medium well. I still don't know how I feel about this fact, but when it came it got to my table it wasn't very good. The piece of steak they gave me was rubbery, although very well seasoned, and just not the least bit enjoyable. The Avocado was equally as tough and that's the worse thing you could give me considering that I absolutely LOVE avocados. Anyhow, I still don't think the meal is worth the price however the bottomless sangria kind of makes up for it. I had the Havana Banana and it is by far one of my favorites. The service is still overall very snobby and rude. The host's as you arrive need to learn how to be less snappy and a lot friendlier when explaining that it is First-Come-First-Serve with the seating if you don't have a reservation. I gave it two stars and those are for the decor that remained consistent and the sangria that is hard to find across the city; good sangria that is. Other than that, if it weren't for the lack of Sangria on the UWS, I would never even bother, which is a shame because the place has a great vibe and look to it. If you are planning on Calle Ocho I suggest you make reservations and order apps, a main course, and dessert if you're trying to drink a lot of Sangria. The old location had a Sangria Buffet that was obviously self serve. They did away with that system here and have added a ton of new rules to the menu. Honestly, the rules are a huge turn-off.

3.0,12/31/2011,"Bummer how much changed when the location changed. The brunch deal is still pretty good, with solid food (try the vegetariano) and a rocking bread basket as well as ""bottomless"" sangria of multiple varieties for the price of an entree. However, servers now bring the sangria, meaning the order gets jacked almost every time (at a table of four with three to four rounds of sangria each, only one round was completely correct. All other times had at least one thing wrong with them). It also is a lengthier process, and it ends as soon as your plates are cleared (which I think that Cubans on real Calle Ocho would frown upon). And the ""rules of sangria"" are way less funny than they used to be.When I asked to speak to a manager to express our concerns, he was receptive but did not really do much to remedy anything. He explained that the physical space made the sangria bar impossible (doubtful) and that they needed to make a profit (true, but I think they were doing just fine with the sangria bar).I'm saying a lot of negatives because I am pretty disappointed, but at the end of the day they are total First World problems.  Calle Ocho is still a fun environment and good brunch deal...

4.0,12/25/2011,"The menu here appears to be exactly the same as the old location, meaning spotty. Some dishes are great, while others are so-so or the portions are too small. The unlimited sangria is no longer self-serve, and this is truly a pain in our collective asses. HOWEVER... This poor grad student guarantees that you can still make your Calle Ocho brunch experience more than worth the $20 by following these three simple instructions:1. Get as much sangria as possible: When the server comes for your order, say you are not yet ready to order your food, but you would like X or Y sangria. Drink most of it before you order, and when you order food, ask for another sangria. Finish this second sangria around the time that your entree arrives, and when the server comes to ask if your food is ok, order a third sangria. Although we haven't tried it, I'm fairly certain you could order a fourth if you really linger over your entree and the bread box (see #2), or if you consider dessert. That is, assuming no one in your party tips their chair over. We didn't actually feel a need for a fourth sangria, and we're heavy drinkers.2. Take advantage of the bread box: Since the entrees tend to be hit-or-miss regarding quality and portion size, you definitely want to fill up on the excellent breads, muffins, and donuts that they plunk down in the middle of the table. These include chocolate chip bread, blueberry muffins, banana nut muffins, tiny fried dough(nuts) with dulce de leche in the center, and tasty, doughy half-spheres of dense bread (my personal favorite), all served with whipped strawberry butter. Finish an entire bread box, and then ask for another. If you can't finish that one, take it home. Tomorrow it will taste great after warming in the toaster oven. 3. Know what to order. These are the choices I'm most familiar with:Entrees mediocre in taste and/or quantity:Cachapa de salmonTortilla espanolaCalle ocho omeleteBetter choices:Gallitos (looks great on other tables, haven't personally had it)Pollo ranchero (haven't had it, but my guy friends often order this)Frita cubana (ditto)Vegetariano (delicious, plentiful, and loaded with butter in a good way)This is not an all-inclusive list.

Last Sunday I came for a dinner in the new location for the first time(now hidden inisde the Excelsior Hotel). I went with 3 of my friends because we all had a pleasant experience earlier in April at the old location (even with a snippy waiter). So we sat and had our drink orders taken, and was given a good sized tray of pan de bono (i love) while we perused the menu. We had decided rather quickly and had looked around to signal to our waiter but he had some serious blinders on. Even other waiters didn't manage to notice us waving our arm in the air, or our ""excuse me""'s. Finally, after about 20 minutes we managed to flag him down as he was heading in another direction, and he explained to us really slowly (I'm sorry was this snack time at nursery school???) that he was going to put something down and then come back to take our order. So he came back, and took our order as promised. We ordered a lobster ceviche, calamari appetizer, an arepa appetizer, and 3 entrees for 4 ppl to split. WE WAITED AN HOUR BEFORE ANYTHING SHOWED UP.We were ready to complain but we were afraid of the possibility of the staff messing with our food, (NO 'TUDE BEFORE THE FOOD!!!) because waiting a whole hour for SOMETHING to show up is UNACCEPTABLE. Especially when we order something like lobster ceviche. Did they select a baby lobster for us and had to nurse it in the kitchen into a full grown lobster?? And that was actually the last appetizer to show up out of the 3 ordered. (it was actually my favorite too. the flavors were great) but the other apps were just ok. They were not as great as I had remembered. The calamari was tender but it just tasted not as good as the last time.The entrees came, a seafood paella, skirt steak, and salmon w lobster mash. They were all ok, the paella shined the most. but the steak was a little chewy, not the great skirt steak i remembered. Also, it took more just to flag SOMEbody down for more water.The funny thing is, as we were nearing the end of our meal, 5 different people came to ask us if we were done, our own waiter being the last. We waited this long for food, can we just sit back and try to enjoy this??We were so annoyed that we just gave up and finally said, yes please just take it away and just end this meal. There was no offer to look at a dessert menu or anything. I was just so DISAPPOINTED, I doubt I will ever go back.

4.0,11/28/2011,"Calle Ocho is an awesome, romantic Latin American restaurant. The drinks were strong. I had the Havana Banana Sangria, which contains coconut, bananas, lychees, and coconut rum. It was sweet too. He had the mojito, which was pretty good and strong as well.For appetizers for the two of us, we ordered the Arepa, which is ropa vieja on top of a sweet corn cake/bread. The ropa vieja is amazingly moist and wonderful. It melts in your mouth! Also, we had the Calamari Frito, which wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be. I guess it didn't compare to the Arepa. I must say the appetizers did come surprisingly fast, not sure if it's because they have it ready in the back though.For my entree, I had the Vaca Frita al Caballo, which was a Cuban skirt steak with fried rice. That was very moist and juicy since I got it medium well. The fried rice and fried egg that came with it was pretty good as well. For his entree, he had the Carne, which was a hanger steak that was thick and juicy.For dessert, we went all out and ordered three different ones, the tres leches, the flan, and creme brulee. They were all amazing, but my favorite was the creme brulee and tres leches. We left some flan simply because we were too full to finish the rest.It was a great and lovely experience! :)",0,0,0,Amy M.,"Manhattan, NY",51,303,615

The ambiance is amazing: beautiful decor, artwork and warm lighting. The staff was SO friendly and accommodating. I liked how the restaurant is separated, not just one big room. I sat in the back room, the main dining room looked had the same vibe and although the place was packed, no one was sitting on top of one another. I like the two person booths along the wall, great for a date. Here are the reviews for the dishes and drinks that I ate:Spanish Harlem Sangria - one of the best I've had Dulce- SO delicious. The sweet corn shell and the goat cheese flavors blended together so nicely, it was perfect. I like how they brought it out in the cast iron mold the cooked it in. Gallitos - although this is a two person appetizer, it can definitely be made into a meal because the portion is large. The chicken was perfectly cooked and tender and the shrimp was good. I liked the authentic corn tortillas that came with the dish.My friend who had the Calamari Frito (appetizer) said it was the best calamari that he's ever had and the other one who had the Vaca Frito al Caballo said his meal was delicious as well. I already made reservations to come back next week with my family.

4.0,11/15/2011,"I'll start by reviewing my previous experience at Calle Ocho, which was a few months back at their previous location (I believe it was right around the corner).I was not happy to say the least. I ordered the Vaca Frita al Caballo. I LOVE skirt steak so I was anxious to eat this dish. Once presented in front of me, I was very disappointed. The steak was small, thin, and DRY. UGH! The sangria was the only thing that saved this place that night.I went back this past Sunday to their new location at the Excelsior Hotel but with much hesitation due to my last experience. O boy, was I surprised. The decor is beautiful and the space was bigger than I thought. We were seated and greeted by our waitress. Her name was Lauren and I'll start off by saying that she was delightful. I started off with the Atun appetizer and was blown away. I LOVE Tuna tartar and this was just the best. My friend ordered the Mojarra ceviche and that, as well, was superb.For entrees I ordered the Salmon and friend ordered the Bistec. I decided to go with the fish as I did not want to be disappointed again. We asked Lauren a few questions about some items on the menu and she was very knowledgeable and friendly.The salmon was melt-in-your-mouth exquisite and so was the steak. The steak was so good that I ended up eating half of my friend's dinner! I rarely write reviews but when something is worth talking about, I will.Another plus by our awesome waitress - my friend thought his sangria was too weak so asked her if there was a stronger mix of the cocktail. She apologized and said no. He decided not to order another and when the bill came we noticed she had not charged us for the sangria. We thought that was very nice of her and enjoyed my whole dining experience.",1,0,0,Dnice A.,"New York, NY",22,7,0

4.0,11/11/2011,"Calle Ochoa is a Nuevo Latino style restaurant that was amongs my best dinner experiences in New York this time aroundIt is located in Manhattans' Upper West Side inside the Excelsior Hotel.It is a fun experience atmosphere wise.  Inside you walk by the busy dark bar where many are lounging the night away.  The dinner area is further in where it's slightly loud, but not uncomfortably loud.  A fun loud.They serve 8 types of Sangrias.  I had the traditional Roja Sangria.  It was good but lacked the punch and flavor that the best Sangrias have BUT I did enjoy it.The ceviche sampler is a must.  They lack the classic Peruvian Flavor but still tastes very good.  The Ceviches here still are excellent because of the texture and quality of the raw cooked  seafood.  I had the lobster, red snapper, scallop, and some other white fish (my favorite of the 4).  They each had different ceviche styles.  The Lobster was cooked in a tropical concoction of fruits like mangos and maybe even papayas while the scallop was flavored with coconut and quite possibly a subtle touch of curry.  The other two fish ceviches were flavored more traditionally.  A clever signature of the ceviche combo was the popcorn which I liked and made a great compliment side.For the main dish, I had the Paella.  It was the perfect size for two and had a wonderful combination of mussel, clams, lobster, shrimp, chicken , and sausage that makes the eating experience fun and exciting.  Only problem was that the Paella seemed too oily.  But, again I still enjoyed it.The service is prompt without rushing the customer or being too quick, yet was laid back without being uncomfortably slow, and friendly and fun without being overly invasive (A+ Service).I really want to give this place a 5.  Just a couple of minor things.

One of the head servers comes out and ask us ""You guys' didn't get bread?"" with his eyebrow cocked. We didn't know whether to be scared for the unfortunate soul who dropped the ball but we admitted yes we had been slighted. The head server walked off and began to personally bring bread out. They scored points here.-A server walked out hurriedly with our food, passed us, then walked back to the kitchen with it. We couldn't find our server to let her know what happened. Minutes later they bring out the same dishes. The food is cold. They lost points here. -We told the manager how disappointed we were and he took care of us with some complimentary desserts. They gained major points here even though the dishes weren't that great. Draw?Still a 3/5.

4.0,10/31/2011,"This is a review for the new location, inside the Excelsior Hotel on W. 81st Street. The decor is darker, more serious and pulled-together, with lots of semi-circular banquettes. The bar area up front is loud and attractive, with some seating by the front windows.The major difference is no more sangria bar. It's still gratis, but you place your order and it's delivered by the glass. I didn't have a problem with this, but it definitely changes the vibe. No more freewheeling sampling, no more guys stirring the giant vats to keep the fruit distributed. The apps (salad with creamy goat cheese, tamal, and an empanada that was plated from a giant metal press!) were all winners. Entree-wise, the luscious duck sat on a bed of the most flavorful lentils, and the hangar steak was similarly lip-smacking. Salmon came with a generous helping of lobster mash. There are usually fish specials, which are worth waiting for.The one sour note was our waiter. He was obviously annoyed with us the moment we sat down, and he responded to the simplest questions (Like why does the free sangria have prices listed in the menu?) with disdain. He slammed down requested bowls of fruit that had gone missing from our sangria. It was so bad that the 4 of us almost walked out. Then, suddenly and for no reason, he became our best friend.

I give the sangria's a 4 star.  We ordered a platter to share, the Gallitos $28.  It comes with scrambled eggs, home fries, chorizo and tortillas.  You basically make your own breakfast tacos which was great but not the best.  We also ordered a side of plantains which one was savory and the other was sweet.  Overall give this place a 3.5 stars and is a great little spot to hang out and listen to great music.",0,0,0,Emmy D.,"Milpitas, CA",168,111,30

However, it was still a very nice place, and being new, everything was new, clean, and in place.As for not having that sangria bar anymore--honestly I don't think I could have taken advantage of it! Many of us were buzzed from just our first glass! At first, I was disappointed and thought the drink was weak, but boy, was I wrong! And this was while I was also busy stuffing bread in my face the whole time!So, the bread. AMAZING. All the girls at our table agreed that the little pale white buns were the best. We gobbled them all up from the bread sampler, and slathered them up in the delicious strawberry butter. SO. FREAKING. GOOD. In fact, we finished all the buns, and asked the server to bring us more of only that bread--he complied and brought us a tray full of fresh, hot buns. I think I ate at least 3 of those, and that was me trying to have some restraint.As for the brunch entrees--the wild mushroom paella is quite delicious! I ordered that, and everyone who tried it agreed that it was the best one. It's only been a day since we had brunch there, but we've been constantly talking about coming back again for that bread and paella.

There are only three single-room bathrooms for the entire place, and the restaurant is quite sizeable. We had 30 girls in our party alone, and they were constantly waiting on the long bathroom line.

It use to be more open, brighter (especially in the back) and had a cantina sort of feel to it. Now it is definitely more intimate and romantic. I wouldn't say one location was better than the other, but it's just different. The most recent time I went, I came with a friend after going to the National Academy Museum. We got to Calle Ocho around 4:30pm on Saturday so they weren't open for dinner yet. We were directed towards to the bar, where we shared a pitcher of sangria (blanca is my favorite!). At 5, they moved us to the dining area. This was my first time in the new location and it felt like I was on a date with my galpal! We were a little hungry after taking a drawing class and gawking at the student art, but didn't want a full on meal. So we ordered 2 appetizers, the Dulce (Fire Roasted Sweet Corn Empanada, Goat Cheese, Vine Ripened Tomatoes ) and Tamal (Sweet Corn Tamal, Shrimp Enchilado, Goat Cheese, Pumpkin Seed Pesto). I don't know if it was because we asked for seconds for the OMGDELICIOUSBESTBREADEVER or because the appetizers were really entree sized, but by the end of the meal we were STUFFED. Okay, it was probably because we're gluttons for that bread.Both the Dulce and Tamal had the right mix of texture and flavors.

They were disgusting, unless you're some 18 year old who is really excited that they didn't get IDed and gets to drink free booze during the day. All the sangria mixes were so sweet I actually got a sugar high and a stomachache before I even felt the alcohol. I wouldn't go back here, but I know that 599 other people will each weekend, and it makes no sense to me.",3,2,2,Shauna D.,"Manhattan, NY",87,167,10

5.0,10/2/2011,"Great company + delicious food + ambient staff = what's not to like?!So okay, this was a little bit out of my territory - I don't usually travel that far up to eat but a friend of mine actually mentioned this place & I was looking for a place to eat for another friend's birthday. Although I had originally typed in ""seafood"" into the Yelp search box, lo & behold Calle Ocho popped up! So I though, why not?I'm glad I went w/ my gut because the food at Calle Ocho is AWESOME!- For starters, I think there must've been crack in their bread. Don't let the size of the bread pieces fool ya - they're packing w/ flavor. The crust was crunchy & the inside was soft & chewy like a soft pastry... It almost reminded me of mochi. & the bean paste that complimented the bread? GREAT! Each savory bite was filled w/ a bit of sweetness & a bit of saltiness. Nice compliment, right?- For our appetizer, we ordered the grilled octopus. Wow, each piece of grilled octopus was soft & juicy. The octopus was NOT overcooked like how some seafood restaurants can make it. I wish I could've ordered another plate...- The perfecto side dishes were great. I love, love, love fried plantains!- & my main dish? The salmon! It was cooked properly - medium rare just the way I like it. What made it better? Maybe it was the combination of the mango chutney sauce or maybe the fact that my 2 salmon fillets were sitting on top of lobster mashed potatoes? Oh yeah, & you can see those pieces of lobsta ;)- To end the night, the lovely staff sang Happy Birthday to one of my good friends & they brought her flan. The flan was thick... but still pretty tasty!Calle Ocho is pretty chill... Not as loud as some other Spanish restaurants that I've been to. Their music was at a good volume where you could hear it & not have to shout over your friends to hear yourself speak. & I love the decor of the place.

1.0,9/22/2011,"WOW this place is horrible! I heard from some co-workers that the wait list for brunch is about a month. As a Cuban American from Miami, I felt the responsibility to eat at a place called ""Calle Ocho"" (which means ""8th Street"" and is a stretch of US 41 which runs through Miami's Little Havana neighborhood). I decided to check out the hype and stopped by Calle Ocho by myself without a reservation for brunch one Sunday. I sat at the bar and they brought me a bread basket that was amazing. It had biscuits, pan de bono, muffins and other assorted breads with a strawberry spread (this was the highlight of my Calle Ocho experience). The bartender explained the whole unlimited sangria thing and I went to check it out. It's such a cheesy gimmick...so you get to stand in line for 10 minutes and pick among a few crappy sangrias with exotic sounding names. The drinks were watered down and way too sweet. The menu was horrible and there was nothing Cuban about the food. I ended up eating a breakfast burrito (a burrito is not a Cuban dish) that had eggs, sausage, cheese and black beans. I swear the beans were probably poured straight out of a Goya can. Their flyer showed a Cuban flag draped over a building in Old Havana.

They are located inside a hotel, so it's a type of place you go to because you know it's there. Apparently when I went they recently moved locations, and it was during their soft opening so their dining tables were all booked up for the night. The hostess did offer us 20% off if we wanted to eat at the bar or in the small lounge area so that's what we did! My friend and I ordered the appetizer sampler which was absolutely fabulous! Everything (except the calamari...it was kind of sad) was delicious and full of flavor. As we were just visiting NYC, it was our first meal of the night in order to try as many things as possible- so we just stuck to the appetizers. The platter gave us good variety and ended up being a lot of food. It was even better to wash it down with some of their sangria. It was sooooo good. SO GOOD.

3.0,9/18/2011,"We went to the new location expecting all you can drink Sangria, which is technically true. But the downside of that is, you have to flag down your waiter (who who does his best to avoid eye contact with you, flagging him down is about as easy as getting a cab in times square). Be sure to memorize the drink menu or ask the waiter to leave a copy of the menu on the table, because he won't be that helpful in helping you decide (imagine eye roll, followed by an impatient stare). The sangria drinks were really good! They had ten flavors, I had the coconut one with lychee, and the berry one. The drinks were pretty strong, we got somewhat drunk after three. The food was okay, nothing to be impressed about, i got the cuban burger with fries, tasted like a standard burger, nothing out of the ordinary, or worth the 2 month reservation. People definitely come here more the unlimited drinks and sangria.With that said, why the heck is there only one bathroom? I mean unlimited sangria coupled with tons of women, that only equates to long bathroom lines. If you dont want to wait, try the second floor hotel bathroom.All in all, the place was a good find for those who like to drink unlimited alochol for a relatively cheap price.

A friend shared a $25 dish with eggs, tortillas, sausage, beans, etc. It was sooo good, and so filling that our other four friends had some too! The best part of eating here is the bottomless sangria. I mean, where else can you get some? AND, you can CHOOSE A DIFFERENT sangria on the free refill.

Now, this only exists in my memory...I just came back from brunch at Calle Ocho's new location with a good friend of mine, and I am heavily disappointed.I was firstly very distraught at the discovery that the self serve sangria bar has now disappeared. This resulted in me only have 2 glasses of sangria instead of my usual ridiculous amount, and this is due to inattentive wait staff. The lovely waiters who worked at the previous location are now M.I.A. which makes me think that maybe there has been a change in ownership? Who knows.To make matters worse my favourite meal has now been taken off the menu. I used to love the Continental Latino which was cinnamon doughnut balls, Mexican hot chocolate and a plate of fresh fruit. This now also, only exists in my memory.I ended up having the quesadilla's which really weren't that great. The chicken was a mix of thigh and breast, and yes I know I'm picky.. but I really hate thigh meat. I ended up eating a tiny portion and bringing the rest home for my husband.Still hungry, I ended up having the dark chocolate cake for dessert which was delicious and in the shape of domino's which was very cute.This still only cost me $25 including tip so I really can't complain about value for money, but this is a far cry from what my favourite brunch place used to be!",1,1,0,Sarah B.,"Brooklyn, NY",74,65,16

Some ceviche, datiles (YES, the dates are bacon-wrapped AND almond-stuffed), roja sangria, and some of the cheesy bread with bean dip is usually all I need to get an evening started right.

We wanted a light dinner...two of us shared a ceviche and I decided on the gazpacho with crabmeat as my entree. Unfortunately, my friend's salad, which was supposed to be her second course, was brought with the appetizers. Thus, she had nothing to do while the rest of the table ate our second courses. Our observant waitress, who had asked that the salad be brought with the second course, apologized and later offered us a dessert on the  house, which was nice of her. While the ceviche was delicious and the salad looked very appetizing, I was disappointed with my gazpacho. They served it as they do in high end restaurants, pouring the soup into the bowl over the little nubbin of crabmeat. The crabmeat was fresh, if limited in quantity, but it was the soup itself I couldn't stand. It was yellow, creamy in appearance, completely smooth and devoid of any crunch or texture, and tasted nothing like I expect gazpacho to taste. It was so tart and vinegary, in fact, my friend made the observation that it could do double duty as a salad dressing. That is not a good thing. Thumbs down (way down) on the gazpacho.The dessert -- the choclate domino -- tasted pretty good but something about its appearance made it look like a mass-produced, grocery store-bought dessert.Finally, I was disappointed with my mango cocktail -- it was super sweet and tasted like a virgin drink.",1,1,0,Pamela S.,"New York, NY",906,1220,115

Since they recently moved, the place was not as packed as some of the other reviews make it sound, and we were seated pretty quickly.The biggest draw is the sangria deal (possibly only available for brunch): order any entree, and you get unlimited glasses of sangria from a menu of 8 choices for free. Between the three of us, we definitely had all 7 that were available that day, and they were all pretty darn good. Careful though: they're so tasty that you might neglect to realize that they're still fairly strong, and they're very generous with how much they pour in their large glasses!The food was also interesting: it seemed like traditional Cuban/Latin American food to me. I think everything we ordered was definitely better than average, but not the best in its class. I had the burger option, which ended up being very filling although a bit plain.But seriously, the sangria is the major draw here, and it's some of the best sangria I've had in the city so far. The bread they give you at the beginning is also amazing. All this for around $20.Some slight cons:-There's only one men's bathroom and one women's bathroom. There was almost always a line for both.-Either because they just reopened or because we were nearing the end of our meal, the waiters, although attentive, were forgetting what we asked them for. Not a huge deal, even if they were subtly trying to nudge us out, especially since they're so generous with their sangria.",0,0,0,Allen Y.,"Manhattan, NY",94,361,1
4.0,8/14/2011,"Ok, so I'm a vegetarian and I've never been there for brunch- but lemme tell ya, the two vegetarian dishes they have are FANtastic. I am in love with the dulce, which is delicate, creamy, and sweet all at the same time. I love the way they pop out a fresh empanada onto your plate from a mold- it's fun. All their sangrias are amazing, too! Very complex and certainly strong! The vegetariano isn't as flavorful as the dulce, but if you order them together, they're a great pairing. Also, oh MY god, the bread. The bread. The bread. If you've been to South America and have had chipa- this is pretty much the same thing... except better. I would marry that bread.

1.0,8/14/2011,"I came here for a Birthday Brunch.  This place is huge. They even have a private area where our party sat.  And I sat.....sat and watched everyone eat because there was NOTHING on the menu I liked. I usually look up menus before I go to restaurants, but I failed to do so.  I came to brunch with my mind and mouth wanting French Toast or some type of breakfast food.  The menu only had some sort of egg option.  I don't do eggs!  The restaurant is Cuban and I've been to Cuban restaurants before.  They didn't even have a grilled chicken option.  I will admit that I'm a selective eater, but I can usually find some sort of chicken/pollo item I can eat.  Not here.  I was with a bunch of lushes and they were there for the unlimited Sangria's anyway.  I don't drink alcohol either, so nothing about this place excited me.  I sat and drank ice tea while everyone got there eat and buzz on.Our waiter was cool and accommodating, but the bust boy that brought out our food had a little attitude and got snarky. A place this big should have more than 1 women restroom. Especially since they offer unlimited Sangrias for brunch!!  The line was long to the bathroom and there was only 1 stall.  There was even a wait for the men's bathroom, because after waiting for so long some woman hijacked that bathroom.  I couldn't even fault her.  When you have to go, you have to go! #need2tinkle",0,0,0,Toya M.,"New York, NY",66,20,5

Between their sangria bar and the awesome food, I can't even think of another place that comes close!For those of you who are unfamiliar with Calle Ocho, they have an unlimited sangria bar featuring 8 sangrias and is included in the cost of your entree. We tried all of the sangrias, and they were delicious, although my friends weren't a fan of the banana (I hate bananas, so I steered clear regardless). The line for drinks did get a little long at some points, but they were great about restocking the glasses, and they have someone behind the bar making sure the pitchers are full at all times.Now, for the food! They give you a ""basket"" (or an old Cuban cigar box) of assorted breads with strawberry butter. My favorite was a small zeppole-like bread. For my meal, I got the highly recommended vaca frita, and I really enjoyed it. It was bursting with flavor. My friends enjoyed their dishes as well.The service was great from start to finish. Our first server, Britney, was so excited that we were brunching for the first time and was eager to share recommendations with us. Over the course of the meal, we had several different servers who were all very accommodating.It can be difficult to get a reservation for their brunch, but I promise it is well worth it!

As far as main courses are concerned, I had the bistec which was literally a slab of meat still moooo-ing :) Was excellent!!! Oddly enough I think I enjoyed the sauce that was drizzled on top of it more than the meat itself - simply delish! My dining partner had the salmon with lobster mashed potatoes - while I was told both were equally tasty, I think the portions were a bit on the small side...Drinks were solid - we each had a classic mojito...nothing to rave about, but in line with expectations. One thing I'd like to point out (coming from a Portuguese guy) is that this restaurant is not Portuguese...I noticed in the categorizations its classified as such, but it certainly isn't....oh well, it's all semantics anyway!

I would pay $10 to order them as an app if they weren't free! Every app and entree I've had here has been impressive, both in quality and quantity. Traditional cuban dishes and ingredients, but usually with some kind of addition or twist. I wouldn't say this is fancy food, but they're definitely well-though-out dishes, not just food-on-a-plate.

4.0,6/4/2011,"As a Californian, I've been known to complain about Mexican food being crappy in New York.  My biggest issue is (among other things) how dang expensive it is.  I mean, is this burrito* REALLY worth $15?  It comes with beans AND rice?  WOW!!!   No.  Calle Ocho, while not technically ""Mexican"", it gets lumped into that category for me and paying $20-$30 (closer to $30) for entrees is still akin to sodomy. BUT!When the food is tasty and more haute cuisine than hole-in-the-wall, I almost understand.  Portions are generous and you won't be looking for the nearest burger joint after dinner.  Throw in the fact that they have some damn fine rolls (fluffy, soft, and oh-so-sweet) that are served with black bean spread.  Add onto that the selection of tasty sangrias.  And the nice and sexy waitresses they have working there....I hate to say it but I like this place.I found the Gallitos (appetizer for 2 -- $26) to be an exceptional value.  Beef, shrimp, and chicken served with fixings to make enough tacos to choke a small donkey**.  The pitcher of sangria (my favorite is the Blanca Tropical) for $30 is also more than enough to make 2 people feel a little swimmy in the head.This place tends to get busy and on more than one occasion, when coming in without a reservation, I've had to sit in the bar area for dinner rather than in the main dining room.  The dining room is fun and well lit with slightly better service in terms of getting water and roll refills but the bar area is dimly lit and and very romantic.  So if you find yourself on the UWS and hankering for some ""Mexican"" with a few extra bucks to spare, you know what I'd suggest.----------* Yes, I know burritos are not really Mexican food.** A real burrito.",3,3,5,Margaret T.,"Brooklyn, NY",530,358,80

3.0,6/1/2011,"I'm going to admit this first of all, in case you decide you'd rather discount my review - this place is just a bit too Upper West Side for me.  I like my little brunch places, serving a specialized and thought-through menu of seasonal food, with a brunch cocktail mixed just for me.  Calle Ocho is definitely not that.The place is vast - much bigger than you'd think when you first walk in.  Past the bar it opens out into a massive light-and-airy room with seating for hundreds.The menu is also huge, though interesting in places and with some unusual things.  The portions were big and the food pretty decent.  They have the quite-entertaining gimmick of having a taco-cart continually making the round of the restaurant serving up mini tacos to accompany your meal - though I couldn't help thinking that I'd have been better off (and less out of pocket) going to an actual food truck.So, onto the reason that most people seem to go to Calle Ocho: the unlimited Sangria.  Yes it was sangria.  Yes it was unlimited.  Yes there were lots of different recipes.  But none of them were great, they were all insanely sweet, and (because it's aimed at an 'unlimited' audience) they weren't that strong.  Plus they're served up on a table over on one side of the restaurant, which means getting up and queuing every time you need a refill - it doesn't exactly make for a relaxed brunch.  Is being served from passed jugs of Sangria really too much to ask?There are massive signs all over the Sangria bar forbidding people taking more than one glass at a time, which makes it feel a little bit like you're sneaking drinks out of your parents' drinks cabinet (or is that just me?).  But, looking around the restaurant, you can kind of see why: big groups of people who are on the beginning of a night out on a mission to get pissed (in the English sense).  But, even if this is what you're looking for, unless you're bringing a coach load of friends from out of town, surely there are more interesting places to do it?",0,0,0,Chris T.,"London, United Kingdom",30,91,2

5.0,5/31/2011,"This place is absolutely awesome!  It is rare that a place gets a five and keeps a five.  I've been going here for about a year.  I try to make it in about once a month or so if I can.  I go most often for brunch, which is terrific for the price.  Make sure you make a reservation.  Dinner, though is where the food is top-notch.  The paella is a great deal and beautiful.  It was filled with mussels surrounding the rim of the plate, and a large lobster tail on the side.  It doesn't get any better than that.  The plantains are always good as well as the taco cart on brunch days and the bread with great spreads.  The space is also so huge, high ceilings, a bunch of happy people drinking sangria, and good music.  I know everyone talks about the sangria, but it really is terrific: 8 different kinds of unlimited white and red for brunch.  Also, if you get a pitcher say for dinner, they do a good job with loading it up with alcoholic fruit.  My favorite!  I will keep coming back for sure.  I just hope that if and when they move to a new space, it still is just as awesome.",0,0,0,Sara S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,0
5.0,5/31/2011,"Why yes, I do believe Calle Ocho is as good as it gets. They have an amazing selection of sangria, my favorite is their red fresca sangria, a pitcher of that will make almost anyone a happy camper. To raise the ante even more, their all-you-can-drink sangria brunch renders all other brunches to be incomparable, it's almost unfair, but no one's complaining.For the other vegetarians, despite Calle Ocho being a Latin American restaurant, they have the most tasty dish of wild mushroom paella, conveniently called ""vegetariano,"" and adding sour cream to it makes it all the more glorious. My meat-loving friend ordered the chicken quesadillas for brunch, but could not stop eying my paella and ordered it for herself the next time, so it's that good.I also am very fond of their fried calamari, which has more a tangy and nutty Thai flavor to it - I highly recommend it. I guess the only downside (applies for brunch only, not so much for dinner) is you would have to make brunch reservations weeks in advance if you want a chance of getting in on the all-you-can drink sangria, but almost any and all consequences are worth getting a table in this case.",0,0,0,Angie D.,"New York, NY",400,21,8

4.0,5/30/2011,"They had me at ""unlimited sangria."" But when I realized that they offered multiple varieties of yummy and strong sangria, I fell in love. Beyond the point of no return.I went for Sunday brunch with friends, which was a great time to go. I would suggest sitting in the lounge, as it's more relaxed and fun. However you will have to wait, as it gets very crowded, and be ready to pounce on a table when it opens up. If you want to avoid this situation, make table reservations way in advance. Only downside: the entrees were just okay (at least the ""cachapa de salmon."" Not bad, but nothing to write home about). This is the only reason I would give it 4 and not 5 stars.I would classify the food as latin-fusion with a Cuban foundation (amazing in theory; above average in execution). However, the BREAD was AMAZING! Soft, warm, savory round rolls upon which you can spread strawberry butter sent from heaven. Loved the Cuban music playing in the background.

5.0,5/23/2011,"I hope that after reading some of my reviews, you know me well enough to know that my single highest priority is seeking out the very best value in NYC cuisine. Value is the perfect melange of taste and price. Calle Ocho is such a place. Including tip, my bill came to $19.75. I left the restaurant probably 10 pounds heavier, tipsy verging on drunk, and extraordinarily happy. Yes, the sangria is unlimited. Yes, it is free. And yes, it is actually tasty AND alcoholic. Brunch choices were certainly plentiful for me, but I am told that vegetarians would have a hard time choosing. Who cares when the sangria is... free! And lest I forget the non-alcoholic highlight of my meal -- the bread... I'm quite proud of myself for hitting the gym in advance of my brunch. Otherwise, the copious amounts of cheesy buns I shoveled in my mouth would make me blush. The waiters eagerly refilled the bread basket when I expressly asked for more of the cheesy bread. I ordered the pollo ranchero and was supremely delighted. It was very tasty and filling... long story short, absolutely no complaints. Will be back as soon as I've earned the right to eat more cheesy bread... The best part is that everyone is so genuinely happy to be there -- everyone is drinking, laughing, having a good time. It's just such a pleasure to be surrounded by so much merry-making.

The bartenders are perhaps too much into their clients by using some names that could only be used with someone you have been intimate with, but I guess it works, the female clientele are sipping their cocktails like water.

BUT, what does move me.. is the FREE bottomless sangria/mojito buffet..  now that gets 4 stars!! This is precisely why this place has a 2 month wait list for brunch! And rightfully so. My favorite you ask?  The HARLEM red sangria. This baby packs a punch. I believe its the long island of sangrias.  But tastier and dressed up w/ little bits of fresh floating fruit. How to get around the steep prices at brunch?  Ask for the taco cart selection as your meal. It's not on the menu but available for brunch til 3pm.  For $8 you get a choice of beef, chicken or pork meat in a decent sized bowl, w/ approx 8 baby tortillas and a plate of a variety of trimmings (cilantro, onions, pickled jalapenos) . Ask for the hot salsas as well!  These bad boys are awesome. I had the beef and chicken.  My fav was the beef- (more of a carne de res). Seriously, delish!! And filling. Plus, they give you a decent size complimentary basket of muffins, rolls and buscuits that are pretty hearty as well.Tip: you can only have one drink per person at your table.  So try to grab their largest glass at the buffet table so you dont have to keep getting upAlso- be sure to make your next reservation when you exit, so you're gauranteed a spot in a month or 2.  I also have my girlfriends also make rsvps.. so we can make it a habitual brunching spot",2,0,0,Maria H.,"Hackensack, NJ",127,150,73

I had the Pollo ranchero which was tasty and my girlfriend had the burger which seemed to be the popular choice as there was at least one on every table.

It is unlimited and pour it your self which is cool because you do not have to rely on your waiter to come by every so often.

Calle Ocho has a 2-hour table limit, so drink up! Drinks aren't watered down, so my friends and I left brunch pretty happy. You can't go wrong with any of the eight varieties (4 reds, 4 whites). The Havana Banana was a favorite at our table; it tasted like straight-up super-sweet lychee juice.Next, the food. Overall, pretty meh. Sadly, I enjoyed the free bread/muffin basket and strawberry butter more than my actual dish. I ordered the Cachapa de Salmon, which is Venezuelan sweet corn crepes filled with smoked salmon scrambled eggs. Sounds mouthwatering, right? The eggs were good, just a tad too salty for me, but the crepes were what completely turned me off. They had a really weird aftertaste. A couple of my friends tried and agreed. One of them said that's how sweet corn crepes taste, so at least now I know better. The Tortilla Espanola (Spanish frittata with asparagus, potatoes, piquilla peppers and wild mushrooms over crab enchilado) looked great, too, but the flavor was actually pretty bland. The Vaca Frita (Cuban skirt steak with fried rice) actually tasted really good, but the steak itself was pretty puny. The restaurant:  very spacious and bright interior, friendly and attentive service, and they didn't kick us out at 2 p.m. on the dot, which was very nice. Do make reservations well in advance.

Order the cheapest thing on the menu (I usually get the Burrito Sucio, a pretty okay dish) bc the food is NOT what you come to Calle Ocho for so just order whatever will give you access to the legendary sangria bar!!  The bread basket w the black bean paste is actually really good.If this is your first time, try all of them.   Seriously, just throw your shame out the window and try all of them.  There is no other way.  all of my friends liked different ones, so its really just taste specific. We measured to see which glass holds the most liquids (least amt of trips to sangria bar).  Huge wine glass looking thing is comparable (surprisingly) to the regular tall waterglass.  If you want to trick your friends into thinking you drank a lot, just get a small glass and tell them you are already on round 12.  Service is TERRIBLE, which is usually a bad thing but NOT AT CALLE OCHO.  The less the waiter takes care of you, the more time you have to drink.  I realize I come off like a lunatic alcoholic here, but I'm Asian and I just like to make the most of my money..and I think everyone may have a little asian in them.  I am usually plastered after a brunch at Calle Ocho until the next day.  Goodnite everyone.",1,5,0,Joyce K.,"Fullerton, CA",387,338,196

The ""Arroz Con Pollo"" was really great - the chicken was very moist and flavorful and the rice that came under it was delicious/a very pleasant surprise. the ""Vaca Frita al Caballo"" was also good - but the spinach, tomato, garlic mix under the meat actually impressed me more than the steak - it was super rich and tasty - difficult to eat the whole thing though. The bacon wrapped dates that I sampled at Taste of the UWS were phenomenal. This is kind of a place where people come in groups, but the food is worth taking your time to enjoy. The drinks were awesome - the bar at the front is a lot of fun, but very loud. The atmosphere is fun and loud - and the decor is trendy and sleek.

4.0,4/4/2011,This is my 2nd time going. First time would rate 5 stars. I would say that the Cuban Sandwich trumps the hamburger two patti thing that they have(in all fairness i'm a true carnivore and usually order things medium rare or rare-this came well done and crispy). The banana lychee sangria is amazing as are the pastries and strawberry butter. Reservations are advisable unless you want to get seated at 330.  I also do not care for the chipotle ketchup. I know its random but its so off for a place that has most everything spot on.  Oh the coffee is great too.,0,0,0,Jay B.,"New York, NY",81,177,9
4.0,4/3/2011,"I brought my bf here for his bday. The food and the drinks were very good. He ordered the roja sangria, I got the havana banana sangria. Both were very tasty. The paella was veryyy good. It came with lots of seafood and you can tell they were fresh, not frozen. The rice was very flavorful and they gave a lot of chorizos. We also had the ropa veija, which came with fajita wraps..quite interesting. However, this restaurant is on the expensive side. Each entree was around $30, whereas you can get the same entree at a cheaper price and a larger portion at other spanish restaurants. But I must say, their paella is one of the best I've ever had so you get what you pay for. However, the ropa vieja was nothing spectacular. You can get the same quality for cheaper elsewhere. OH! And I must warn you, they give these cheesy bread balls in the beginning. DO NOT EAT TOO MANY OF THESE! We finished all 5 and we ended up having a hard time eating the entrees.

The back waiters do a good job of staying on top of things, but during our last visit, it took over 20 minutes to be noticed by our server who finally took our drink order. We were just about to leave. She did her best to make up for it after that, so things turned out OK and the food was delicious. At the end, we were asked if we wanted desert and we declined. She brought one anyway to ""make up"" for our wait. This was a nice gesture, but we REALLY didn't want it and didn't appreciate feeling forced to have one. We would have preferred to have one of our drinks comped instead. This has happened to us in a couple of places in NYC within the past year.  Restaurant management should realize if they want to comp something, it's much more impactful to remove a relevant item from the bill (like one of the drinks we had to wait so long for) than to give the customer something they didn't order and don't necessarily want.  Still the gesture was somewhat appreciated and the food was really yummy!",0,0,0,Sarah P.,"Fairhaven, MA",4,10,1

1.0,2/22/2011,"Calle Ocho used to be my favorite restaurant in NYC!  It was such a trek for me to get up there from Brooklyn, but I've always made it a point to go there every once in a while.  I've been there for brunch, dinner, and drinks; and I've absolutely loved it! ...until the last time I went!! It was my friend's birthday, and I recommended Calle Ocho to my friends because I loved it so much.  Unfortunately, it was the worst experience we've ever had at a restaurant!  The waiters were inattentive, clumsy, and forgetful!  The entire dinner took more than 3 hours!  At one point our waiter was nowhere to be found, and it took nearly 30 minutes to get service!  The waiters, while clearing another table near us, dropped and broke several plates and/or bowls, and the shards flew everywhere!  The service was so slow that we finished our first pitcher of Sangria when the appetizers came out.  We ordered a few more pitchers, but the waiter completely forgot about them until we asked again midway through our entrees.  The food was also sub-par -- I've definitely had better at Calle!  They also messed up one of our orders, so the rest of us all waited until our food went cold for the last person's food to come.. and the list goes on..THE WORST PART!?!  THE WAITSTAFF STOLE OUR BIRTHDAY CAKE!!!  We bought the 8"" Lady M Mille Crepes Cake for our friend.  If you've ever bought that cake before, you'd know that it's $75 and it's the best cake ever!!!  We brought it to Calle Ocho, they kept it in the kitchen while we had our meal, they brought it out for our friend to blow out the candles, everyone saw how big it was, and the waiter promptly took it back to the kitchen for cutting.  When the waiters came back with our individual slices, we each received less half an inch of the cake!  One of the waiters had a huge grin on his face as he asked, ""That was the thousand layer cake, right?"" We responded, ""Yes?""  And he said, ""Yea, it's suuuch a great cake!""  We looked at our slices, and all thought the same thing, ""Yess, we know!  Did YOU have the rest of our cake?!""  But we let it go, thought maybe they were saving us the middle (like some restaurant do) for us to take home.  After we finished our measly slices, we asked the waiter whether there was any left.  The waiter said ""yes,"" brought out some slices that were thinner than the last and told us that was the last of them. We're all smart people, there were only 8 of us, and it was an 8"" (diameter) cake.  So if you do the math to find the perimeter of the cake (2*pi*4) = 25, divide that by 8 ppl, you'd see that we should have received at least 3"" of cake each  But we were each only given less than an inch of cake!  I know it's sometimes customary to offer the waiters some of the birthday cake AFTER we've had enough.  But simply taking it BEFORE we've even had our share, and WITHOUT our knowledge is just unacceptable, immoral, and heinous!!  AND, since we had a party of 8, they charged us 18% gratuity!!!  the nerve!!!This happened Summer 2010, I haven't gone back since, and I've put it behind me.  The only reason it came to mind is because I'm thinking of getting another Lady M cake...and I thought that I share my story on yelp.",0,0,0,L.

Spend close to an hour by the loungue area at the request of the hostess since no more names were taken, to wait for a table to be open. After waiting close the hour, the manager says that the kitchen closes in 15 minutes. This should had been said so at the beginning. Oddly enough people were being escorted to tables after we were told to wait for one open.

5.0,2/20/2011,"I LOVE Calle Ocho. It's one of the best brunch places in NYC if you like sangria. Basically, you order one entree (ranging between $12 to $20) and you can have unlimited sangria which sit in 8 giant jugs on one side of the room. Of the 8 jugs, 4 are white sangria and the other 4 are red. I have to warn you though, if you are a sangria expert and expect high quality, don't. These are great sangrias, but they are not high quality. To be honest, while they have a wide range of entrees, nothing has yet to wow me. It's all good food, just not amazing. But then again, with the price and unlimited sangria, I'm not complaining. I came here one other time for dinner and it's the same deal. But I don't think it is every night so you should check their website or call them. Their dinner menu was slightly expensive, but the food was really really good. We also had the unlimited sangria.

5.0,2/19/2011,"Verdict: An amazing place to have brunch in NY. The on the house Sangria bar has interesting varieties and the bread basket is just the way BBs should be at a brunch place. Food's great and the ambiance lively !Location: We went to the Calle Ocho on the Upper West Side. The place is huge and one might have to wait couple of minutes before getting a seat. No outdoor seating. Ambiance: The restaurant is pretty big, with the bar upfront and big hall at the back. Buzzing with activity, its a very lively place over the weekend. One of the highlights is the Sangria bar which is on the house when you get one entrée, has many varieties and large jars topped up for all ""sat-afternoon-is-a-good-time-to-get-tipsy"" crowd. Food: As I mentioned the bread basket is great ! Its an assortment of different breads unlike many restaurants which just stack up two types of bread and offer some olive oil to dip it in. This place has atleast 6-7 types of bread, different shapes, textures, fillings and taste. For entree I stuck to a basic omelette but I have to mention the accompanying  salsa was fantastic. I tried the Mojito Sangria and loved it. Deserts - go for the Crema Catalana - you wont regret it !

2.0,2/17/2011,"I have some caveats to my review, so I'll discuss those up front. First caveat: I have only come here twice and treated Calle Ocho as a restaurant, not a bar. Second caveat: I have come to Calle Ocho for dinner, not brunch.Calle Ocho is a massive cave of a sangria bar, with enormous portions of uninventive bland ""Latin"" fare and uneven service. On my first visit, our service was good, except the restaurant rushed us through our (very expensive) meal in order to turn the table over. On the second visit, our service was all over the place. I didn't order a drink but one emerged anyways. One of the entrees was wrong. At least our three year old dinner guest was served quickly - her child's meal looked more appetizing than the vegetarian option (the single offering on the menu). I should also mention the restaurant lost our reservation (for 6 people).I needed salt, spice, and kind of wanted a margarita to pour on my food to give it some much needed flavor. Or at least to make things interesting. Hey, at least both times I've been to Calle Ocho I've been in great company.

Overall the place was nice, Spanish music playing in the background and the main dining room is huge.. they don't get a A+ for decor but hey we are here to eat right? Started off the night with two drink specials, I had a tequila drink called ""encanto de amor"" and my friend had a chocolate martini. My drink was a little too strong but tasty, and the chocolate martini was pretty yummy but a little too thick for my preference We started off the night with the camarones appetizer, and although it is not made to split between two hungry people, it was sensational... the shrimps were crispy and seasoned perfectly and the onion with avocado mix was surprisingly addicting I also forgot to mention the scrumptious bread they give you with a bean spread... at first we thought it was strange but once we tried it 2 bread baskets later we were in loveFor the entree I chose the Vaca Frita al Caballo, steak with rice, beans, tomato salad, avocado and a fried egg. Personally I am not crazy about eggs that aren't fried well done, but the fusion with the rice and meat went perfectly together For dessert we ordered Cocos, which is coconut ice cream with pineapple sauce, it was light and delicious Price was very reasonable and will definitely come back to see what the buzz is all about with their brunch specials",2,0,2,Amanda D.,"New York, NY",285,104,13

The mash was ok I wish i had subbed it out for something else. There is always next time. I also tasted the duck two ways with lentils......DELISH!!!

I've had AMAZING Steak Frites before (try Floresta in Sunnyside!!), but this wasn't even close. The steak was very fatty and quite bland and the frites were seriously rock hard... (sidenote: there are good frites at Sinigual near Grand Central). My sister's salmon was BRIGHT pink in the middle,but the waiter was nice and brought her a new one right away. We ordered a pitcher of the tropical (white wine) sangria. Honestly it tasted a little watery, but didn't get to try any of the others so maybe it was just a weaker batch...Overall,it was fair.

The portions of food was great also. We were so full after eating two thirds of the calamari. I find I'm extremely picky when it comes to salmon- just because I think I've tried it just about anyway you can cook it. It was slightly overcooked, and very salty.

4.0,2/5/2011,"I was physically removed from the sangria table! Who said I can't put a big straw in each selection like a personal IV cord? That was not on the House Rules list!Seriously, this place rocks for brunch! Unlimited sangria? Eight different types! Hell yeah baby! We had a reservation for 12:30 brunch and made sure we were there by noon. When we walked in there was a crowd waiting around the host desk. Checked in and we were whisked away ahead of the crowd after only waiting about 5 minutes. I guess many of those waiting did not have reservations. We were led past a very nice bar and lounge type area to a hallway that let to the enormous main dining room. This place is huge and you would never know from the outside. Wow - the main dining area has multiple rooms, eclectic decorations, murals on the walls, bright colors, funky giant lampshades, and terrific wooden architecture on the ceiling. Miami in the house!We were led to a table that was right across the sangria bar - jackpot! All types of flavors and unlimited with the cost of an entree as long as you are eating there. We ate very slowly today! The place was bustling, staff were constantly running from table to table, sangria was constantly being poured and refilled. Latin music is playing. It is quite a fun scene here as everyone seemed to be in great spirits. Maybe it was because of the sangria high? Our waitress was friendly and gave us some suggestions on what to eat and she was right on. We had the Vaca Frita (Cuban skirt steak) and the Pollo Ranchero (chicken, scrambles eggs, tortilla, black beans, sauce) and both were delicious. Plus, the bread basket you get has some great muffins and biscuits. That cheese biscuit thing is awesome and the strawberry butter adds great flavor. I literally only had to walk five steps to get to the sangria table and made that trek constantly! Our faves were the Roja, Tropical, Harlem, Fresas, and Havana. All full of fresh fruit. Some are on the sweet side and some are on the dry side, so it is up to personal preference. Another good tip is to make sure you get a big glass and hold onto it, as those go quick, and then you are stuck with the smaller versions. Table is set up as self serve and pitchers with ladles are there for constant pouring.Also, another fun option is to get the taco cart for an additional $8. A server runs around the place ringing a bell on this taco cart and will come to your table and set you up with all the ingredients for a tasty taco adventure. We did not do this but the table next to us did and it looked good.We had to look over the dessert list and decided to share the Bombas, which are doughnuts filled with creme and covered in brown suger. You also get a scoop of this AMAZING banana ice cream! Holy cow was that good. So much flavor i could have eaten a pint of it right there.This place is great for groups, couples, parties, and bringing visitors for a fun afternoon. Reservations are a must! Our whole bill came out to around $43 - super bargain considering all the sangria we drank and the food we ate. Service was quick and attentive, and we never felt rushed at all. Overall, food tasted good and sangria was full of flavor and fruit. Could not have asked for a better brunch experience. Left buzzed, fat, and happy!",11,9,8,Phil H.,"New York, NY",5000,3324,13021

2.0,1/30/2011,this place is junk. There are a few reasons for my 2-star rating. Part of it is the major let down after hearing so many good things about this place and about the Sangria bar. The other part of it is for the low-quality and tasteless entree dishes.

3.0,1/27/2011,"Ultra meh. There are two ways to look at this place. If one appreciates Called Ocho for their style, decor, service and presentation, they give every other Spanish restaurant *un corrido * for their money. The bar is beautiful and the restaurant is even more so. You are taken care of every time you need taking care of, and the waiters seem nice (at least ours was). I haven't seen Spanish food made so creatively in a long while; they proved that you *can* do more with empanadas than you think. This place has SEX written all over it. Even the food comes out sexy. Definite bonus points for Spanish culture there. (Watch a Spanish novela if you don't get it.)On the other hand, I'm Dominican and, unfortunately, my Mom cooks really good food. It's not just a family-bias thing; friends and girlfriends of past have unnaturally asked for seconds/thirds of her rice, but that's another story. With that in mind, I expect a dish full of awesome when I go to a Spanish joint, and lots of places I've been to surprisingly deliver. Calle Ocho didn't. Maybe this is just a restaurant week thing, but everything was god-awfully small. Definitely not Latino-like. I had the salmon, and it tasted pretty bland. Perhaps it's just my mom (doubt it), but weseason the crap out of everything (including steak). Second Latino fail. The biggest disappointment, though, was right at the end; sorry, boys, but that flan was horrible. It came out beautiful(ly small), but tasted light on sugar. And caramel. WTF? To me, that's kind of like missing a three-point shot with all air (or considering the size of the thing, a layup would be more appropriate). Perhaps they saved all of the sugar for the dulce de leche, which wasn't anything like the way we make it (had no beans, for starters), but was tasty nonetheless.If you want to make your date feel special (or if you're a woman and want a really nice free dinner), Called Ocho's your man. Don't even think about coming here if you want the real dea, though. El Malecon is a bit further up and walks this place.

Definitely the highlight. Closely following was the Dulce, a cheesy, creamy salad. The Datiles were also a favorite (again -- people love bacon wrapped things!). We also ordered the empanadas of the day, which were spinach, and not that tasty. The Yuca fries followed and were dry and served with marinara sauce, making them not that tasty.

2.0,1/12/2011,"wow, im shocked that there are some 5 star reviews for this restaurant.  the food was below average, and expensive!  the 2 stars are for the service, the space was really nice, and the sangria.we were with a big group - our waiter was really nice and helpful and patient, so i have to give them props for good service.  but besides that everything else pretty much stunk!  we got a bunch of appetizers, and almost all of them were below average.  especially the calamari - they looked and tasted like the chef just dumped a ton of sweet and sour sauce all over them. gross! especially for $13 bucks!! and the arepa's were so dry, i get better ones at the street fair.  of course the empanada's sucked as well. the meat on the inside was super dry and not tasty at all.  all  the other appetizers were just as bad, but these 3 really stood out in my mind.on to the entree's, the only one that i tried that was pretty good was the Gaucho - Grilled Hanger Steak, and Argentinean Chorizos, the Gnocchi were gross - super heavy drenched with really heavy sauce.  not sure why gnocchi would even be served at a cuban restaurant. but they were pretty awful.  i had chilean sea bad and it wasn't even filleted (spelling?) properly, leaving bones everwhere.  the side of spinach it came with was drenched in oil and salt. very disappointing. i will never return here, not sure how long this establishment will last because the food was expensive and truly a disappointment.",0,0,0,Andrea M.,"New York, NY",3,36,13

When I think of going to a Spanish restaurant I imagine the food being so seasoned and big portions of yummy food. The portions were small and the food was average...It was good but it wasn't ""OMG this is SOOOO good, you guys gotta try this!""  I feel like the menu was too limited for my taste. The only thing that surprised me was that black/green spread they serve with the bread. It looks like baby poo but it tasted good lol. i didn't have any of the Sangria, but I'd love to come try the unlimited buffet that they have for brunch.

1.0,1/9/2011,At first glance this place seems to be a hot spot with people coming to this venue frequently. Once you sit down and receive your entree that seems they tried to put a little creativity into it the food has to be the worst tasting Cuban food i've tasted for the price they are charging. I have a problem with the previous reviews it seemed as if they wrote themselves because for one sure thing the food really sux!!! With the exception of the free bread that's given to you.

After I reserved, I noticed several mediocre/negative reviews, especially about salty food. We had a wonderful meal-- it is large but broken into several rooms- we were in the vaulted area which may have been a little noisy but actually was great for the kids.  How can you go wrong starting off with pisco sours?

The wait staff and bartenders are very friendly ... and kool .. not cool... KOOL! =) The entree... for me...well.. I don't care for it.  The little muffins and bread is good though. I never finish my plate here because I simply do not care for the food.  It's edible but doesn't taste all that well.  But eh.. I don't go here for the food.. I just eat it to absorb all that alcohol I take in.  When you go to get your sangria you have to wait in line (buffet style). You need to grab a glass at an adjacent table near where the Sangria is.  The glasses are in diferent shapes and sizes.  So... what you have to do is keep an eye out for the nice big glasses to get your sangria drinkin on... those lil small glasses are a tease..and you have keep getting in line for refills...  if you're patient they will bring out the nice big glasses to satisfy your Sangria thirst!Ah... it's amazing how I come in totally sober and walk out nice and buzzzzzzzzed... everytime... never fails! =.O",1,0,1,Christine L.,"Manhattan, NY",19,34,1

I went with high expectations.  Maybe my palate is not as sophisticated as some reviewers here but I had been craving ceviche for quite some time and i was ecstatic to finally get it. The fish was OK - i think i like my ceviche a little on the tart side. it was bland. just simply bland.Four of us went - we got gaucho, skirt steak, pulled pork, and tilapia. I think the skirt steak and the tilapia were great. The steak was nicely seasoned, well cooked, and was tender - couldn't really complain. The tilapia sauce was quite amazing. simply amazing - the waiter told us it was a bit springy - and yes it was! It was citrus-y with a lot of zing. It blossomed in my mouth. However, the pork disappointed me.  I'm not too sure if they salted the meat before, during and after they roasted the pork - it was wayyyy too salty. Definitely tender, but nothing really special. The salt just masked all the flavor if it had any - and i stopped eating after a few bites.  gaucho - i just tasted the gnocci, but it was too wet for my taste, if you know what i mean. it was chewy, but too soft...maybe too much water?!Four entrees, we all got drinks, two appetizers and the check came out to be 160.00 excluding tip. Quality vs price? i would not go back there again.

That itself was 5 stars. I had a razberri mojito and several cocojitos. Throughout the night they were also serving appetizers out which was very nice even though we pre-ordered so much!

There was one member of our party who even had his order messed up (got the Pollo, but wanted the Bistec), and it there was absolutely NO HASSLE changing it. It came out pretty fast too. I couldn't catch the name of the main waiter, but he's a keeper!FOOD - Pardon my French, but FAN-FUCKIN-TASTIC! Our dinner was a prix fixe menu, with unlimited sangrias, beers, and wine. If you haven't gathered this from their other reviews, the bread balls and black bean hummus are amazing. Get 4-5 baskets! For drinks, I had the white wine sangria which was also awesome. For appetizer, I had the shrimp over an avocado salad inside a fried onion ring. Now I know that might not sound too tasty, but trust me, the portion was huge and I was already full just eating that. Then the entree came -- Pollo. Not just any chicken, but your adobo marinated juicy chicken breast over a bed of roasted peppers and potatoes with sausages. YUM!!! And for dessert, there was a choice of either chocolate cake, creme brulee, or flan. And no, those weren't the names of the items on the menu, but I sampled all three and LOVED THEM.PRICE - The price came out to be $75/head including tax and tip, on the company dime of course ;) .

Now you know you should have already made reservations three weeks ago for the peek brunch time, because come 4pm, the Sangria is shipped off to the magical world from which it came for another 7 days!Now, they do actually also sell food here, and while prices have gone up over the years, it's still a great deal for a solid brunch. They have Spanish style fritadas in iron skillets, the classic steak and eggs, burgers, and several more unique dishes to boot. They drop off a bread basket while you wait (which is not very long, they are fast here), and all the while you are filling your own glass with the 8 choices of Sangria (both Red and White wine based options)! I'd also suggest getting some Yucca fries for the table (They give you a lot), and wearing your stretchy pants. The food is salty, which makes the sangria go down faster, and the bloating come to the mid-section in record time!The wait staff are always friendly, and they have enough bus-boys to keep things moving (you can almost feel a bit rushed).

4.0,11/15/2010,"I've been to Calle Ocho for brunch more than a few times now, and each time I've left the restaurant unsatisfied with their food but happily tipsy. My friends and I have managed to try pretty much the whole brunch menu in the times we've been there, and there hasn't been one dish that impressed me. I think the only food item that I really like at Calle Ocho is the little yuca bread balls that they serve in their bread basket. That being said, I would recommend the Gallitos, because it's portioned for two people and it's fun to share and make your own breakfast taco. Also, their Yuca Fries are a great alternative to the regular fries. The rest of their menu is average, neither good nor bad, with the exception of the Cachapa de Salmon. We've tried it twice now, and none of my friends like this dish. It's like the salmon crepe has a personality disorder; it can't figure out if it wants to be sweet or savory, and not in a good way.What Calle Ocho lacks in food and service, they make up for in ambiance and sangria. I struggled with 3 or 4 stars and decided to be nice and round up, since hey, who am I kidding? I go to Calle Ocho for the sangria, and oh do they do that part well. The sangria is complimentary with your brunch entrée and there are 8 types to choose from so there's something for everyone here. The sangria bar is set up buffet style and it's completely self-serve so that you can refill at your leisure. My favorite is the tropical because it has diced mangoes and pineapples. And since the sangria is unlimited, my friends and I usually hang out at Calle Ocho for a couple of hours and drink to our heart's content.**This is a really popular restaurant for brunch, so make sure you make a reservation. Also, your whole party needs to be there before you all can be seated.",8,3,6,Amy S.,"Astoria, NY",272,308,2490

3.0,11/14/2010,"We went to Calle Ocho this weekend for brunch with some friends and ended up sitting at the ""bar,"" which could mean bar stools, or if you're lucky and get there early enough, a bar booth, as we did. Calle Ocho gets major points for the ambiance (dark, inviting with intimate booths) and the variety of all-you-can drink sangria - score!! The wait staff was very accomodating and friendly....even after we pestered them for a few more rounds of that delectable cheese bread...and could we have a side of black bean dip with that? :) The food itself was decent, not spectacular. Tortilla espanola was moist, and simple with top flavors of potato and egg. Sadly, I couldn't taste much of the other listed ingredients (mushrooms, asparagus, lobster, etc.). The sauce that accompanied it, however, added a nice zing. E and friends all got the steak and eggs. Loved the red onions and rice, but given that' it's flank steak, it was a little too stringy for my taste. Go when you've got a few hours with good friends to spare.

We arrived right when they were opening for dinner so the hostess told us to have a seat at the bar and that she would call us when our table was set. I had the tropical lychee infused sangria and my husband had a mojito and we were both loving our drinks. Not long after, they sat us at our table, a comfy booth. The restaurant is very nicely decorated and dimly lit for ambiance...how romantic. :)I ordered the seafood paella and my husband ordered a steak dish. We also ordered the yucca fries/black beans combo plate as a side. Our server handed us a basket of cheesy bread balls and pureed black bean paste with queso fresco on it and let me tell you...i seriously wanted to be that customer that asks for more bread refills just so that i could stuff some in my purse! They were sooooo yummy! Im so sad that I dont live in NY and cannot replicate those yummy cheesy bread balls myself. :(Anyway, the food arrived in a timely fashion and both my husband and i were impressed with our food.

5.0,10/25/2010,"In New York City, there are three ways to get over a Sunday morning hang over:1. Spend the day couped up in your home watching TV.2. Running it off somewhere in central park or along the Hudson.3. Drinking more.And, well, since it's New York City, you should be going with number 3, and there is no better place to do it than at Calle Ocho. Countless Sunday headaches have been cured with a refreshing glass of Havana Banana sangria (with lychee bits), and oh the food is just too good to stop eating.The sangria bar is packed with eight different types of wine, all flavored with various liquors that do their job in getting you hammered. If you get lucky, you'll arrive at the table with a large glass waiting for you. Other times, you'll end up with a small one, but who says more trips to the sangria bar is a bad thing?The large, sun-lit atrium fits quite a bit of people, which makes the atmosphere as lively as being in the heart of Acapulco. The bread is so soft and buttery, and their black bean paste, which is not that visually attractive, is the bread's soul mate. You can't have one without the other.Onto the food - I really don't know how you can go wrong. I'm halfway through trying everything on the menu and I haven't regretted ordering any of them. The burrito is hands down a favorite, but the steak and eggs is just as good.Brunch starts at noon and the last call for the sangria bar is 4:00PM. After eating, head over to central park and stroll around to walk off the buzz on a nice day, or head down to the flea market and browse at some neat little shops.In the spirit of their Sangria Bar Rules, here are mine for the glorious Calle Ocho:1. Call and make reservations at least a week in advance.2. If you skipped rule 1, go early (like 12:30PM)3. Waiting is OK so long as you have a drink in one hand, it's NOT okay if you're sober by the time you get seated4. The bread must be ordered. No exceptions.5. Last call only means bringing at least two glasses back. One for now, one for the road.6. No man/woman visits the sangria bar alone - it's the new buddy system.7. Asking for their hot sauce platter (free) gets you brownie points.8. Never let a drunken Sunday go to waste.",2,1,2,Andy C.,"New York, NY",52,41,1
4.0,10/25/2010,"When I see the words ""complimentary all you can drink self serve sangria buffet,"" I get excited. In a city like New York, words like that are few and far between. Obviously, there was no question whether or not I would be checking out brunch at Calle Ocho- it was a foregone conclusion.Even though the 8 flavors of free fruity alcohol sounded too good to be true, I couldn't help but be really, really excited when Boyfriend I headed there for a Saturday morning brunch date. Boyfriend got the Vaca Frita, which was a delicious variation of your classic steak and eggs, with tomatoes and avocado. I got the Burrito Succio. I may, on this occasion only, agree with Boyfriend's all too common assertion that I ""ordered the wrong thing."" A burrito with chorizo and eggs is, in retrospect, an obvious attempt to please Manhattan brunchers looking for a bacon and egg dish. The Cuban twist on this classic brunch favorite was edible, but far from a home run. With too much egg and black beans and not enough chorizo or cheese rolled into a rather bland bundle, my teeth were longer for something crispy to counter all that softness.Somehow, even with the lackluster breakfast burrito, Calle Ocho managed to live up to most of the hype. I immediately fell in love with the large, airy space in the back room. The canopied sky light roof made me feel like I was eating outside at a Spanish resort. The complimentary sangria was fruity and delicious, the bread basket was out of this world, the space is airy bright and beautiful, and the price is right. I definitely want to come back here with a crowd. All the free booze would make for quite the party, and unlike many brunch hot spots, they actually take reservations. (Even without one, we didn't have to wait for a table, but I guess there were only two of us and we were on the early side at noon.) Expect to see me here again, enjoying my fruity libations and making sure to get my bread basket refilled, but ordering a different meal!",4,3,4,Sarah C.,"New York, NY",152,352,60

I agree with Katy H. review about service and food. I guess my friends and I got a double miss today with food and service. But first of all, i absolutely LOVE the sangria bar. I will go back again and again just for that (and for the warm baked breads). I'm not a fan of Latin food, especially for brunch (way too heavy) but I still wanted to experience the sangria bar. My favorite was the Havana Banana white wine sangria. It had coconut and lychee meat in it (i'm crazy about lychee). Mojito white sangira was very good too because it had peach schnapps in it. I'm not a fan of red wine so didn't try any of the reds. Besides, when I got up to get my second glass, they had already cleared the bar (3:34pm). It'd be nice if they had give us a heads up before they close up the sangria bar.Our waiter was not friendly. When we finally waved him down to take our orders, he came, stood there, took out his little note pad, and said nothing. He just stood there, not even a ""hi"" or ""how are you doing."" It was really odd to me because he was super talkative and friendly when he was taking orders for the next table. He even explained to them how the sangria bar worked and asked if it was their first time there. And for us? not a word. i almost wanted to asked him if he was a mute...Food was disappointing, except for the bread. I think the bread was the best out of the whole meal. We had Skirt Steak, Cuban Sandwich, and the Frittata. They couldn't do a medium-rare because it was a braised steak and probably already made. Cuban sandwich was thin, dry, and flavorless. I could only taste the mustard (or was it horseradish?). I had 1/4 of the sandwich and gave up. Cafe Habana's is much much better! The fries came with the sandwich were crispy and seasoned with garlic salt and parsley so the dish wasn't a total disaster. The frittata itself was ok, the spicy shrimp (they ran out of crab) enchilados made it much better. We also order the Home Fries and it was fine but not memorable.  If you've never been to Calle Ocho, give it a try (for the sake of the unlimited alcohol), but...1. make a reservation first2. expect slow service3. order the cheapest entree they have and go crazy on the sangria bar4. don't forget the bread & strawberry butter",0,0,0,Alexia G.,"New York, NY",85,68,12

5.0,9/23/2010,"went for some Saturday brunch lovin'...-the food is spectacularrr.  lots of bold flavor.  fun presentation.  my bf is cuban and he went crazy over the food and savored every bite.  i had the beef/pork burger with the special ketchup and the chimicurri fries... the fries were to die for.  bf had some skirt steak and that was great too.  i'm not hispanic but i guess i can conclude from my bf's reaction that this place is on par with authenticity. one really awesome thing about this place is that instead of the usual white table bread and butter they give you a box of spanish sweet breads and strawberry butter... amazing.-the ambience is unexpectedly very nice... the space you walk into from the street is a narrow, dimly-lit bar area but behind that is the enormous, bright, and cheery atmosphere of the grand dining room.  the dining room is deceptively huge, and it's got some great architecture and awesome energy going on.  that's no surprise when the restaurant offers an unlimited gratuitous sangria bar...-oh, yeah. the FREE UNLIMITED SANGRIA BAR that comes with brunch on the weekends. 8 flavors. need I say more? i particularly enjoyed the one with the cinnamon, the one with the lychee (havana banana, i think?), and the mojito sangria.  i was surprised to find that they didn't water them down, at least i couldn't tell.  it's a serve-yourself thing so you can drink however much you want, however often you want.  suffice it to say, we were feeling gooood by the end of the meal... tip: there's a nice dog park across the street by the museum of natural history with some greenery and plenty of benches to walk/sit off your buzz afterwards. or you can walk it off by stumbling through the wonders of the museum, whatever you dig.-can't quite complain about the service. it was really busy and the waitress came around enough. we weren't hurried out despite the rush either.bottom line: I can NOT wait to come back here!  what a dining experience... and for the price it is really a steal.  highly recommend!",0,0,0,S D.,"Jersey City, NJ",66,80,9

4.0,9/21/2010,"5 stars for the bread basket.3 for the food (though I should order better next time).5 for the awesome sangria bar.A little annoying that they don't keep tables for the regular wait - they were booked solid and my friend and I were lucky to get a seat at the bar for Sunday brunch. Also they didn't take orders til after 12 noon.. what's with that? Good thing we didn't get there any earlier. It would've meant more sitting around hungry.The main dining room is great - so wide & open lots of bright lighting. And I like that in the front by the bar, there are all these couch/lounge type tables that feel more casual.The bread basked consisted of a very soft, moist chocolate chip bread, still warm from the oven (YUM). And a moist and very subtly sweet cornmeal bread (also YUM). There was a 3rd type but it obviously didn't impress me as much as the others. These came with strawberry butter. YUM.Sangria bar - tried  the Banana Havana, Mojito, and one with passion fruit. All were very delicious - sweet, fruity, light in alcohol flavor (but probably heavier in content than it tastes).My friend got:Burrito Sucio - good, filling, hearty burrito. Can you tell I'm not a huge burrito aficionado?I am a sweet brunch person, which is kinda dumb to stick to at a Latino place. I got:Continental Latino (cinnamon sugar doughnuts, mixed fruit, and mexican hot chocolate) - this was good, but didn't amount to what really felt like a brunch meal. Don't get me wrong, I didn't leave hungry. But I felt like I was just snacking on stuff.. little doughnuts (moist and soft, but coated with a little too much sugar), fruit pieces (including mango! nice touch), and hot chocolate (not particularly memorable. Wish it was thicker). I heard the steak was good.. should've gone with something Calle Ocho would be better at.",0,0,0,Ziyan C.,"San Francisco, CA",83,2073,9557
4.0,9/20/2010,"If I hadn't received the tip that this place served unlimited self-serve sangrias, I would have never dragged myself to the UWS for brunch. Food was okay, yea, they have delicious chocolate chip bread, fried dough, burrito sucio, taco cart, giant portions, whatever. But sweet baby jesus, were the sangrias delightful! They have 6 giant canteens of red or white sangria, each tasting completely different. I would suggest pouring a modest helping your first round, just because the restaurant doesn't allow double-fisting, and there's really no reason why you shouldn't have a taste of each type of sangria. By the time we got there at 12 (when Calle Ocho opens) Half the restaurant was already full. By 12:15, there were barely any tables. As a reference, this place is huge, with high, vaulted ceilings and multiple open rooms that creates a nice, breezy Caribbean resort feel, minus the ukeleles and watered-down pina coladas. Prices were pretty fair too. We got the burger, burrito and a side of plantains and the bill came out to $40 including tip. I would recommend getting the fritata or the crepes, just because my massive, beastly burrito turned out actually kind of bland, and the burger my boyfriend got was kind of dry. 3 stars for bad food + 5 stars for booze = 4 stars overall!",1,2,0,Nancy Y.,"San Francisco, CA",234,130,7

I fill up just on the bread and bean dip.  I had the Burrito Sucio the last time I went and I will probably never order anything but that from now on.  It was massive.  It was delicious.  It was filled with chorizo.  Phenomenal.Que mas?  Oh, there's a guy with a taco cart that comes by your table.  Cheap and delicious!  Do it!  And make reservations ahead of time.  The wait for this place can be hours long.",1,1,0,Lynette B.,"Miami, FL",472,548,725

The only memorable flavor was a hint of spiciness from the peppers.On to more important things, here is a list of the flavors of their unlimited sangrias:Blancas:Blanco (fresh fruit and a splash of spirits) - plain, but a solid drink. Havanna Banana (coconut, bananas, lychees, coconut rum) - the rum is very distinct in this one. Mojito (lemons, limes, oranges, sugar cane, citrus vodka) - strong vodka taste, but the non-alcoholic ingredients hold their own here. Tropical (mango, pineapple, lemongrass, passion fruit, light rum) - this was a table-favorite. The alcohol is subtle here. RojasRojo (fresh fruit and a splash of spirits) - plain, but good. Fresas (blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, raspberry vodka) - true to its name, this was a fruity delight. Spanish Harlem (peaches, mandarin, cinnamon, dark rum, brandy) - my personal  Favorite! This drink had a very distinct flavor and is different from the others because of its cinnamon bite. Mulata (Tarmarind, Vanilla, Spice Dark Rum) - another idiosyncratic Calle Ocho drink - try it to be different!

1.0,8/22/2010,"So I'd heard about calle ocho, and planned to go here, even had reservations, numerous times.To say i was displeased and highly disappointed might be the understatement of the year.To start, trying to come here for a large brunch party, not only took months (which was bullshit, as evidenced by other reasons to which i wont get into), but they 1) wanted a CC, 2) wanted an exact headcount 3) literally wouldnt take us until 230 pm about a month later, and 4) rudely REPEATEDLY told me we must ALL get there on time, they WONT seat us until our entire party is there.Ok, we show up in basically a freaking monsoon, and when i say i'm here for XYZ party (bear in mind they called to threaten me days prior about showing up on time blah blah so we were there early), he's all 'we have you waiting over there""...nothing else.After determining that he's clearly not preparing our table etc, I tell him we're all here.  He then says they'll let us know when our table is ready...ok by now its past our reservation time, so why must we arrive in time/early if our table isnt even ready on time?!?!Regardless, once we're finally seated, as i DONT EAT BRUNCH so basically paying for food i know will SUCK in a few hours when i eat it for dinner, I ask to do it to go. I reiterate about 10x if i can just get it made about 5 mins before we leave. our waiter says YES, let me know about 5 minutes before you want to leave and ill send it to the kitchen.clearly no point in food getting soggier/nastier than it really needs to.Strange, because then MY to go food shows up before ANYONE else at our table of 20. Hmm...i tell the rando who brings it out, the waiter told me to tell him 5 minutes before I'm leaving and he'll send it to the kitchen...so basically now my SHIT food is sitting in the damn kitchen, getting nastier than necessary for the next hour or two...So yes, they bring my soggy, clearly crumpled bag of food out when we're leaving, and now, hours later, i open it.  Odd...for $14, its ONE tortilla folded in half...with SOUR CREAM and GUAC on TOP of it. AKA even if i'd eaten it when we were LEAVING it would have been soggy nastiness. Nonetheless when AGAINST my wishes they made it PRIOR to anyone elses food, nonetheless no where NEAR when we were about to leave.additionally, they wouldn't let us come in until 2:30, and then take away the sangria at about 3:30, so I had TWO glasses of sangria the entire time.Sorry, this place sucks, I'm livid about everything regarding this experience from the very rude ""we're doing you a favor letting your LARGE party come here"" (boyfriend said i should them sarcastically email THANKING them profusely for letting us GIVE them business) to the CRAP rip off food and pretty much NO sangria due to the time restraints they stuck us in.  To legitimately bring MY food before ANYONE elses when i was the ONLY one dining to go and ""5 mins prior to departure"" is bullshit. I wouldnt pay $5 for this crap quesidilla (even if it WERENT a soggy disaster), nonetheless $14 for CRAP food i didnt want and almost NO ""all you can drink sangria.""oh, and after we vacated the table, they still wouldnt give us more sangria (3rd glass at most for some, less than for others) at the bar.",4,1,0,Danielle J.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",213,572,10

The flamboyant waiter was very accommodating to a big party, 9 of us sat comfortably in a flashy Latin style cavernous dining area. The place is festive, swanky, energetic and loud, with fun Salsa music in the background. The Food:1) Tacos Al Pastor - 3 stars. It's OK...didn't impress me. I'd stay away from ordering anything Mexican here. Go for Cuban!!!2) Tilpa - this plantain crusted tilapia was ok, not my favorite. 3) Vaca Frita Al Caballo - This cuban skirt steak with latin fried rice was my favorite. It was marinated in a tasty sauce similar to Ropa Vieja. It's $24, but most dishes here are about that price anyway. 4.5 stars.4)Paella - 3.5 stars. This paella is HUGE! It's enough to share between 2 persons. I loved how the paella was filled with lots of seafood such as lobster, mussels, clams, and shrimps, but the rice itself was cooked too dry for my liking. Don't expect the same kind of paella you eat in Spain - it's not moist, and lacked the richness of flavor. It's probably acceptable to most average American people.5)Caramelo -This traditional vanila flan with mango sauce was excellent!! 4.5 stars!6)Cubanito - This chocolate hazelnut mousse with cuban coffee ice cream and peanut butter crust was delicious, but I recommend Caramelo more. 4 stars.We spent about $50/person and had a blast!

Pretty fantastic.The brunch menu isn't very extensive (mostly just classic Latin dishes with scrambled eggs thrown in for brunchy-ness), but the burrito I had was pretty good.

Very high ceilings, lots of space, and there are booths and tables available. There's a lounge and bar in the front and then a large dining room in the back. Make reservations if possible though, as it's apparently gotten more popular recently.The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that the sangria isn't delicious.

As if leaving NYC wasn't difficult enough.The only downside to Calle Ocho that I can think of is that it gets a bit crowded, but for a good reason. Literally every tapas dish I ordered was delicious (I think Tamale was one of them, if I remember correctly). But I could have just as easily stuffed my face with the bread rolls and the yummy dip that they brought out before we placed the order and would have still left happy.The complimentary Sangria bar (on Sundays!) with all the amazing Sangria varieties was a dream come true for an indecisive person like me - I could just get straight to sampling everything.I really enjoyed the ambiance too.

3.0,7/22/2010,"It's Restaurant Week in NYC and now's the best time to try the culinary delights of the Big Apple. Having read good reviews of Calle Ocho, we decided to start here to take advantage of the special menu all for $35. Upon arriving, we were pleasantly surprised by the spacious dining area decorated appropriately in Spanish accoutrements with a sangria bar hidden in the back. Although we made a reservation for 15 people, only 1 waiter worked our table and he basically ignored us for over an hour. It took him 90 minutes to take our orders and by the time he did so, we only had 2 choices left on the special menu. I opted for the normal menu since the Restaurant Week menu was basically gone and chose shrimp for the appetizer and paella for the main entree. The food was great especially the bread but the service was horrible. Overall, if you like Spanish food and a good atmosphere, go here but expect poor service. I personally would not go here again considering the other establishments that offer great food, atmosphere and service.",0,0,0,David N.,"Stamford, CT",7,41,446

5.0,7/15/2010,"Wondering if I should move to NYC just for this tasty place... I came here for brunch and had the most scrumptious mid day meal I have ever EVER consumed. It's not fair that it only exists across the country. So many reasons why this place will rock your mind off:1. Great service - our waitress was fast, efficient and always giving us more water. We had a group of over 10 and she was patient with taking orders and getting us our food. Works well under pressure? Yes. You go girl.2. Que bonita el ambiente - The ceiling is a large window with sheer coverings so the lighting changes slightly as the clouds shift. Le siiiigh. Beautiful, bright paintings and tapestries line the walls. Large plants and lively music make this a vivacious place to graze. 3. Sangria Bar - Hello, this was like the #1 draw. I was traveling with many family members (read: somewhat STRESSFUL) and having UNLIMITED access to a variety of sangrias was so needed. It's a little watered down but still did the trick. I left very happy, indeed.4. THE FOOD! THE FOOD! THE FOOOD. Ok first you will have to eat the breads they put in the middle of the table. And if there aren't enough for you to try all of them, just ask for more. You must try the cheese balls and the caramel dulce bread thing. I think my eyeballs just rolled to the back of my head. So good. The waitress recommended the Pollo Ranchero so I got it. Love it when they make suggestions that are GOOD. This was ridiculous. Crispy corn tortilla toppled with guacamole, scrambled eggs, chicken escabeche and refried beans. Crack cocaine. This stuff should be illegal. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!

However, MANAGEMENT: BRING BACK MY CUBAN SANDWICH. Previously, the Cuban sandwich was pressed down. It was a smaller portion of food, but it was juicy and had the best flavor with a little bite to it.  NOW, the Cuban has dry bread, dry filling.  It's really bad.  I asked the server the last time to see if the chef could do it the old way... it came to be with a slightly heated and still dry. In protest of the civil disobedience variety, I will not return until my Cuban sandwich of the good ol days does as well.

There's a really great bar in the front which is cute and lounge-like. The restaurant part is in the back and is a big room with comfy seating and you don't feel like you're on top of the person next to you.The drink menu is extensive and has at least 3 different kinds of caipirnhas (fav drink ever!). They have great mojitos as well. The drinks are like $10-12.The bread that comes to start is AMAZING. Warm, soft rolls that are served with this amazing black bean spread. I could eat a whole meal of just that....Main courses that I've tried: bistec (so yummy!), the duck two ways and the steak. My fiance absolutely loves the gaucho (a huge plate of different kinds of meat and really amazing gnocchi).  Even the black beans and rice are superb.Desserts and coffee are also fantastic. The coffee is in a french press and good and strong. The cubanito is a hazelnut mousse with peanut butter crust served with coffee ice cream and is one of the best desserts I've had.

It took a while for our food to come out but the servers refilled our bread baskets and the round bread with the strawberry butter is AWESOME... i wish I could just have a whole basket to myself.

However, I was bit disappointed with main courses, Mar y tierra (Too salty), Salmon (My friend liked it), Vaca Frita al caballo ( the meat was so tough that you had to chew about 100 times) and lastly Gaucho (Gnocchi was too greasy, and another tough meat). Moreover, the staffs were friendly but they were rushing us, coming by every second asking if we were done with our dishes, I was annoyed by it. Another weird thing is that, they knew we were celebrating my friend's b-day and they asked who the b-day girl was but they didn't really make it special for her.

As soon as we got to our table, husband started hoarding the bread with bean paste so we quickly asked for more.  Everyone ordered individual entrees even though they were big enough to share.  We had the chicharron calamari which keeps getting smaller and smaller as I keep coming back.  But every bite was still just as good as I remembered.  I ordered the paella and husband ordered the ribs.  Paella was awesome of course but after tasting hubbie's ribs, I want more!!!  The ribs came with a spicy corn as well as sweet potato fries.  Those fries were yummy!!!  Awesome place, highly recommend for a date, a large group or just a chill night out.",2,0,0,Kim W.,"New York, NY",19,240,31

It brought a little tropical island to NY. 2. Fresas - Red wine with an assortment of berries and raspberry rum. Antioxidant overload. The berries soaked up the wine and were very sweet. 3.

Their starter bread is too good and our table asked for more bread literally 4 times and they had no problem just keeping it coming along with the black bean puree dipping sauce. We tried the soft flour taco appetizer which came with chicken, beef and shrimp. Seeing as how I don't eat beef I can't comment but the chicken was ok and the shrimp, while covered in a bright green sauce, was not as flavorful as I would have hoped.The guac is pretty good and while I don't remember what i had the very first time, the second time I had the tilapia because the salmon was ""sold out"" and it was unimpressive along with the limp greens that  came hidden underneath itThe sangria table when I went the first time took forever to get to the front of the line the first time but had no line the second time (both on Sundays) so I suppose it just depends on the time of day (the first time was more brunch and the second time dinner)The staff was patient with us for the most part but at times disappeared for what seemed like an unnecessarily long time when all we wanted was the check.

4.0,5/25/2010,"ATTENTION SINGLE MEN.  I'm still not sure if I should be sharing this with you but here goes......Brunches are great places to meet women.  Especially, at Calle Ocho!I, too, used to cringe at the mentioning of brunch.  Specifically, on a Sunday during football season.  However, my ignorance was blinding me from what now seems so obvious.  I mean think about it.  Who goes to brunches?  Groups of women that want to catch up with their girlfriends.  Who else?  Gay men.  Okay, so the table is set.  Single women and the only competition is from gay men.  It's easy to tell which women aren't single because they dragged their boyfriend along!! Now, I know you're wondering, why Calle Ocho? I'll tell you why.  They have a sangria station.  A SANGRIA.  STATION.  Repeat that in your head if necessary.  SANGRIA STATION.  If my memory serves me correctly, they have 7 different types of red and white sangria, with various fruits, and different alcohols mixed in.  It is virtually impossible to leave Calle Ocho without being inebriated.  So far, Calle Ocho has done most of the work for you.  They brought the women to this place and then they got them drunk for you.  Remember to eat something so you don't get too wasted yourself.  I was told that everyone goes to C8 for the sangria and not the food but I'd have to disagree with that.  I devoured my Pollo Ranchero and helped finish off my dining partners steak and rice and burger and fries, respectively.  Oh the other great thing is that this is all taking place on a Saturday.  So here comes the kicker.  This is big.  Those crazy mofos at C8 don't charge you for the unlimited sangria they allow you to drink.  Talk about making out on a deal.  There is a catch to this craziness.  The Saturday Brunch is only from 12-2 so you have to work fast.  Everyone wants to sit at the tables in the dining room in the back next  to the sangria station.  I say screw that and sit in the front room where it's easier to start conversation.I mean seriously, C8 has done all the work.  All you have to do is break the ice, which if you drink the sangria with the brandy in it, shouldn't be to hard.You guys owe me one!!",10,14,8,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",217,141,13

I don't really remember the food but I recall it being great. The unlimited sangria stands out in my mind more... oh. my. word.

2.0,5/23/2010,"I must be out of the loop because this place just didn't do it for me. In short, no bueno.The all-you-can-drink sangria bar isn't terribly bad. The glasses aren't the largest, but that just means that you can sample more of their drinks. It is a bit watery for my preferences, but I was there to imbibe alcohol, nothing much else. Unfortunately for me, the alcohol in the sangria choices is sorely lacking. No bueno.They do have a delicious bread basket. I'll give Calle Ocho that. They've even made a couple of the top bread basket lists that I've somehow come across. (Who makes those anyways? And where can I get that job?) There's a little puff that is absolutely delish. Yuum.For my entree, I ordered the burrito sucio. It arrived all wrapped up in a plain flour tortilla that was straight out of an overprocessed tortilla factory. Fine fine... I can forgive that since I wasn't expecting much. The problem was that not only that I was unimpressed with the burrito, but I also grew tired of picking through the interior for any sign of meat. No bueno. I ended up boxing up half of my burrito and then deciding to leave it there because I didn't actually want to be forced into eating it later.The service here was no bueno. It took an abnormally long time for our food to be served (larger parties who had been seated after us already had their food and were halfway done). Our server checked on our food multiple times before it came and then when it came, one of the dishes was wrong! So two of us sat there, starving, while the third sat there and stared at our food, starving. We finally told our server that one of us had to catch a plane, so he started being a bit more attentive and timely with the rest of our meal. So I guess that's the key to better service here. -sigh-",6,3,2,Jenn L.,"New York, NY",221,317,547

I know they were very busy because it was mothers day but that was one of worst waiters I had ever experienced in my life. People rave about the bread well we never got a basket....

Calle Ocho has mastered the art of brunch food and early morning inebriety. The menu features traditional latin breakfast items, jazzed up with unique flavor combinations and creative presentations. The entree dishes are affordable for Manhattan ($12-16 each) and include unlimited trips (or stumbles) to the SANGRIA BUFFET BAR. The buffet offers 6-8 types of sangria, including the Spanish Harlem (peaches, cinnamon, rum, brandy), the Mojito (sugarcane, citrus vodka, citrus fruit), the Fresas (a blend of berries, raspberry vodka).Calle Ocho is perfect for birthdays and large group gatherings (reservations required). As an upper east sider who has acclimated to cramped dining quarters, I still cannot get over how spacious the restaurant is. Finally, I have to mention how friendly and attentive the staff is.

Of the four, the ahi tuna with coconut milk was a good one.  The mariscos one was good as well, with pieces of lobster and shrimp mixed in. Fried calamari: Pretty standard calamair, however the sauce was very good.  It was a creamy sauce that seemed like it had some mayo and horseradish mixed in it.chicharonn de pollo:  This dish reminded me of the fried chicken you get at the boba tea places.  It was good, but nothing special.Overall it was a good meal and a great place to go with a big group.",4,0,1,Josh W.,"New York, NY",151,397,54

That aside, dinner itself was pretty good.I will say the service is slow. Perhaps they were overwhelmed by the amount of people they had to service. Perhaps, or just that the service is just slow. If you're in a rush to make a movie or show, this is NOT the place to go. They have these awesome cheesy breads! Small balls of bready cheesy goodness. They're small so you think you can eat a couple. Don't! You eat to many and you're already full before your entree comes. And yes it will be a while before your entree comes. As a party of 5, we ordered different dishes. Where to begin? Pato  - duck two ways, lentil-sweet plantain salad, valencia orange sauce. The duck, made 2 ways, it was kinda small. But it will fill you up if you didn't already fill up on the cheesy bread.The Gaucho - grilled hanger steak, argentinean chorizos, chicharron, homemade gnocchi, was tasty! The hanger steak itself was cooked perfectly. They had a size of chicharron, oh pork fat goodness. a bit on a salty side but they don't give you a huge piece.The Paella  -lobster, mussels, clams, shrimp, chorizo, chicken, tomato calamari salad. This thing was very filling. The calamari was tender not chewy. The lobster was good, you have to work a bit to get the claw meat, but the tail is cut in half for you. Its a lot of rice, you can take it home after.Lechon  - charcoal braised pork shank, tamal en casuela, wild mushrooms. My god, the pork shank was pretty big. I had to take it home, cause I ate 3 or 4 of those cheesy bread balls. Its very filling, pork shank was so tender it fell off the bone. No fight, no struggle. Oh so tasty! *drools*Dessert time! Yes even after all that. The Domino dessert - dark chocolate cake, dulce de leche ice cream.This dessert is quite good, visually it appears as 2 black dominos made out of chocolate. Tasty indeed. Worth trying.Also the flan is worth trying out! It has chopped mango on the side and whipped cream on top. Its not too sweet.The coffee comes in a french press! It comes in a small press and a large press. Get the small press unless you want to be caffeinated all night! You get a good 4 cups of coffee out of that small press!

4.0,4/16/2010,"I love the space here more so than it's food. Calle Ocho is a bit of trek for me. Located on the UWS, it took about 45 minutes to get here from downtown Manhattan. I'm glad my friend suggested we dine here. I typically never make it out to this area of the city, but since he happens to work around here, it was a convenient spot, but also a great choice in terms of decor, atmosphere, service and food. The interior boasts a few pleasant surprises. The bar area is spacious enough with cozy booths and even a reserved area that is slightly elevated off the ground. Happy Hour must be a mob scene  with $5.00 mojitos (and other drink specials) that can't be beat. My friend and I thought it would be best to grab dinner along with our drinks so we migrated from the bar, into the dining room through the somewhat hidden corridor. I was smitten by the large space and colorful decor as we walked in to take out seats. It was visually stimulating and felt like a world unto itself, in seclusion from the noise and hopping bar scene just a few paces away. Instantaneously, I pictured many birthday dinners taking place in this delectable alcove. The menu seemed vast with lots of Latin classic dishes (meat and seafood). I wanted something relatively lite and went for the special on that Monday night which was a shrimp soup. It was nothing to really brag about, the broth was much too salty and the pieces of shrimp were measly. But I definitely loved the pan de queso that we noshed on before our respective meals were served. This spanish staple was deliciously warm and soft, tender with each bite. Dessert was ice cream (can't remember if it was vanilla or dulce de leche flavored), atop a chocolate/fudge cake. It was run-of-the-mill. Nothing really stunned my tastebuds saved the bread, but still good for what it was worth, I think. I would most definitely return for the lively mood of this restaurant which is full of vibrant colors yet paradoxically serene. You can enjoy a quiet dinner and actually hold a conversation without any noise to interrupt your dinner.  To sum it all up, there's more wow-factor in the setup of Calle Ocho rather than the execution of her food.3.5 star ~",6,1,4,Jennifer C.,"Elmhurst, NY",559,645,1350

3.0,4/13/2010,"Went here for the 3rd time last night. When you 1st walk in, the place looks small and crowded. It's because most people crowd around the bar to drink the sangrias. We went in a little after 8PM, and we got seated right away, so it wasn't too crowded in the actual dining area. The place looks deceptive because it looks small from the outside and in the bar area, but it does open up. The 1st time i came here, i went with a bunch of friends a few years ago for restaurant week. I remember thinking the sangria was awesome but the food was a HUGE disappointment because everything was just too sweet. Even my friend, who picked the place was shocked of how crappy the food was. I vowed never to go back, but i finally decided to give it a 2nd go over the summer. I was not disappointed. I had sangrias again and i remember the Paella being AMAZING!. Calle Ocho came back around and won me over.It seems like Monday nights, they have a $5 mojito special. We tried the Fresas, Cojito, and the Caribbean mojitos. Our fave was the unanimously the Fresas mojito. It was sweet, but not overbearingly sweet. The drinks were deceptively strong too. For food, we shared 1 appetizer and 1 entree. For the appetizer, we ordered the Chicharron. It was yummy, but it reminded me of americanized chinese sesame chicken. The calamari was crispy with the dominican honey so it was sweet and it was topped with crushed cashews, which reminded me of toasted sesame seeds. It was crispy and yummy, but sadly it just reminded me too much of american chinese food. The entree, we ordered the Monday classic which was the Chupe. Chupe is the Peruvian Lobster & Shrimp hash, root veggies, and achiote oil soup. It was very flavorful. It had a nice spice to it and it was delicious. This was definitely an awesome dish. They also serve yummy complimentary bread with an awesome bean dip that is just to die for. I seriously could put that bean dip on anything and devour it. It was so good that i was licking it off my knife. I hear the brunch is great because of the all you can drink sangrias.

I dare you. I recommend drinking plenty of water/sangria to stay hydrated from the drooling. The Ceviche is my all time favorite which is best ordered as the sampler with 4 varieties, all of which trump any sashimi salad you could get at a Japanese restaurant. You can go SO wrong with paella but they do it SOO right if you worship seafood. Their entrée's are entirely way more food than one hungry man could ever eat on his own so bring friends and immerse yourself in the lavish dishes together.Postres- Desserts make you feel like you're eating art.

4.0,3/27/2010,"I choose this spot to celebrate my 25th b-day with just my closest lady friends, of course, I did my usual and came in  30 minutes late from my scheduled 10pm reservations.  I did call them ahead of time to inform them that I was running behind schedule and they said it was perfectly fine that they were running behind schedule as well.  KEYNOTE: Not many restaurants ever say that they are running behind schedule.  This in my book is a place I would like to come back to because I know that the hostess does not need to lie to me or having me waiting.The blonde headed hostess, god-bless her soul for being a baby Jesus  impersonator, because she attended my every need and desire that night.  Before I could even say my name for my reservations, she flat out said she has 3 guests registered and waiting for you ""Ms. Ocasio"". That brief encounter was a celebrity ""A Club"" moment.  Maybe it could have been that I was the last reservation for that evening, but she still amazed me with saying things before I can conjure them out of my mouth.  This place would get a complete 5 stars, but the waiter was truly the most laziest I've encountered. Now please refrain me from speaking blasphemy, he was on point when he had to explain the dishes and why this certain culture eats the dish this way.  However, due to his slow services of attending my friends and I, It could not be fair to give this place 5 stars when there was an inadequacy somewhere.  The drinks were amazing, but if memory serves me right I could have sworn on their website that it said ""all you can drink Sangria"".  I mostly chose this spot for my b-day because of this themed ""sangria"", but it turns out that this only applies to certain days of the week or weekend.     I know for certain Sunday's they have an amazing brunch and ""all you can drink Sangria"".  I'm definitely going to have to come here on a weekend to enthrall my liver to some sweet juices of nature.  When we received our entrees I must say I don't think I heard any of my girlfriends say, ""I can't wait to head to Sin City - well only me of course said that throughout my meals and conversations"" but all my friends kept saying was, ""Mmmhmmm, omg this meat comes right of the bone, or I'm so full but I can't stop eating this succulent dish"".  AND I MEAN THIS IS WORD FOR WORD, lol!  I had the chicken stuffed adobo with potatoes, I personally wish there were vegetables in this dish as well, but the chicken was extremely delicious.  Not a huge fan of potatoes, but the spices went well in this dish.  Lastly, let's talk about my birthday finale with a domino cake and ice cream on the side.  I definitely embraced my Puerto Rican side for sure.  It was such a delicious piece of cake, I found cake on the side of my mouth because I was hogging this cake up before my friends can dabble a spoon or poke a finger to try the icing.  Overall, I would definitely be coming here.  I would like to experience on my next trip the brunch and all you can drink Sangria, hopefully I'll get a more attentive waiter.",1,1,0,Aurora O.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,11,0
2.0,3/26/2010,"Disappointment.  That's what Calle Ocho made me feel in my heart.  I had heard such amazing things from so, so, so many people that I was shocked when I had one of the worst dining experiences in a while.  Sad?  Very.I went for a birthday party (with a group of about 15), which may have had something to do with the service and timing of the food.  Throughout the entire meal, it was nearly impossible to gain the attention of our server.  Multiple times it was necessary to actually walk over to the wall he was leaning against - yes, he spent the majority of the evening leaning against the wall by the kitchen.  Sadly, I'm pretty sure that we were his only table...As for the food, it was disappointing.  All of the main courses came out over the span of 10 - 15 minutes.  You would expect a well-oiled NYC restaurant to have their timing better for a larger party.  A friend who ordered the same dish had a completely different presentation - she was missing all of the garnishes and sauces that came with mine.  After waving frantically, our waiter brought out the missing necessities.  The taste was bland, the food was barely warm, and the meat completely not cooked according to my request.  Most of my fellow diners felt the same way.It was one of the only times that I have cried over paying an 18% gratuity...If I can force myself to give it another chance, I'll cross my fingers that I can review Calle Ocho like most of the yelpers on here.",1,0,0,Keith L.,"Seattle, WA",284,172,42

I got the skirt steak and it was really really small. I understand that people come here for the drinks, but I mean its just skirt steak,  for $18 can't you at least give me a bigger piece? Quesadilla was tasty but just as small portioned.

5.0,3/8/2010,"Heard about this place from a friend and after hearing that it had a free all-you-can-drink sangria bar, we were sold.We came here on our last day in NY and walked in around 11am.  We were quickly told by the greeter that their Sunday brunch reservations had been fully booked 2 weeks -- wow.  But she also informed us that we were more then welcome to sit anywhere in the lounge area we would like and still get the same menu/service ... at 12pm, which was when brunch started for them.  So the BF and I decided that we'd wait and decided to take a walk along the park and browse around in the near by street fairs/flea markets going on.  Soon enough 11:45am came and we headed back to the restaurant.  There were already quite a few people seated, but we made our way to the upper lounge area and found an open corner for us to sit and eat.Not too long after 12pm hit we were given menus, plates, utensils, waters, and a variety of breads served with a sour cream infused type of butter.  The server took our orders and let us know that the sangria bar was down the hallway to the right, and it was unlimited during our meal.  So we made our way down the hallway and found the bar ... about 7 or so different types, and all looked great!  They have a bunch of rules for the sangria bar hanging on the wall, some of which are a bit funny, but are true -- i.e. one cup per person.But from all the ones I tried they were all fantastic!  Our food came not too much after we got back to our seats and we began to enjoy ourselves quick.  The service was great, our water glasses kept full, our bread basket refilled before it got down the the last piece, and we were constantly checked on.  They were on point.The downside of sitting at the lounge is taking the chance of sitting next to ignorant people. Might sound mean to say, but because you sit in the lounge area you have to walk to down the hallway to the other dining room to get to the sangria bar, so one time when we got up to get the sangria ... I guess the people in the table next to us thought that we were done and placed a plate of theirs on top of my boyfriend's plate of food -- ugh!  Luckily it was a clean plate and they looked embarrassed, and did apologize ... but it was quite irritating that it happened.  Honest mistakes can probably occur frequently in the lounge area due to that factor ... or maybe it was just these people since we did leave all our jackets and etc on our seats ... eh, who knows.In the end we paid about $40 (tip included) for some great bread, fantastic service, awesome sangria, and amazing entrees.  The best part was that even though they were fully booked on reservations for ALL of brunch time = 400+ of them, they NEVER once made us feel rushed.  Even after our entrees were done they still encouraged us to grab another glass of sangria and refilled our bread ""basket"" (very cute wooden cigar boxes).The place is a gem and I am so glad we were able to experience it.  The next time I'm in the city, I will be sure to make brunch reservations at this place.",6,2,2,Pia V.,"New York, NY",1913,894,1648

This place had me at all you can drink sangria bar.I went for brunch to Calle Ocho on Saturday at noon and was absolutely delighted with the place.  The space is inviting, the food is tasty and the sangria is AMAZING! There were almost ten different kinds, and although I didn't try them all I was smitten with the ones I did.Their complimentary bread baskets are delicious! So delicious in fact that we went through two of them. We also got to try the the taco cart. Their chicken taquitos were even better than the entree I ordered. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and just slightly spice. If you go to Calle Ocho you MUST try the taquitos!I had the Quesadillas de Salvador with chicken, cheese avocado and sour cream. The quesadillas weren't bad, but they weren't the best ever. They could have been more flavorful.One of my friends had the Cachapa de Salmon which is a corn crepe, smoked salmon, scrambled eggs and sour cream. I loved it! Her dish was definitely much better than mine. My other friend had the Cuban Sandwich. I didn't try it, but the chimichurri fries it came with were wonderful.Calle Ocho is the PERFECT venue for a bridal shower or birthday party.

4.0,3/8/2010,"Brunch on a gorgeous day.  Not just any brunch, but brunch accompanied by unlimited delicious/refreshing fruity sangrias.  The food was good, the service was great but the sangria bar sealed the deal.As everyone said, front bar/lounge area is deceiving and makes you think the place is smaller than it is.  The back has very high ceilings and is bright/lively.  Being that there IS a complimentary sangria bar available we assumed there'd be a lot more rowdiness but instead found normal people having brunch and some even brought kids.Once seated we picked out our entrées and put in our orders.  Portions were smaller than we expected when they came out but they were all good and everyone was happy with their selections.*The taco cart choice sounded interesting but we'll decided to try it on our next trip.*Tortilla Espanola: good and not heavy.  LOTS of tomatoes and onions, some lump crab meat thrown in and topped w. a spanish omelet.*Cuban Sandwich: chimichurri fries are awesome.  fries could be crispier but the light flavor was good!*Vaca frita: steak had a braised texture and was tasty.  Bf liked his dish.And of course the bread...light sugar on the crisp outside and good dough on the inside that has melted cheese...mmmWinner hands down though...Sangria barSo many choices!!!  You can get 1 of the flavors available or mix them.  Spoons are available by the pitchers (pls use those, NOT the huge thing behind them) so you can scoop out the yummy fruit chunks/slices (do so!).  Since it was our first time, we went through 1 by 1 to see how each tasted.  We each settled on favorites and had a great time.  We pretty much stayed til 330....Many thanks to our waitress for GREAT service and not hating us for staying :)Definitely going back!!Although once we got outside it felt overly bright (ack SUN!), which is strange since it's bright in the restaurant....And we all felt super full from all the ""tastings""...",1,0,0,Caroline V.,"New York, NY",57,507,1081

The customers were racially mixed (always a plus) and everyone seemed to be having a great time. Maybe it was the free unlimited sangria bar that amplified the happiness? They have maybe eight different kinds of Sangria- I had the Mojito, Banana and Fresca sangrias. They were great. I had a nice little buzz all day. Went for brunch and had the $14 vegetariano paella (rice and mushrooms and salad). It was extremely delicious and the presentation was very fancy! If you're vegan and going there for brunch, that's your only option on the menu (aside from putting together a few side dishes ($6 each). It was also a great portion. Not too much, if you're health conscious, and not too little if that's you're first meal of the day.The bathrooms are clean, which is also something I always look for when I visit restaurants. Don't be scared when you walk in (can seem pretentious and deserted). The front part is completely different from the main dining area, which is lively and fun. Don't forget your IDs.

5.0,2/24/2010,"I have made it my personal mission to visit every AYCD brunch in NYC (that I can afford) and this one is by far my favorite thus far. First of all, the fact that the sangria bar is complimentary automatically puts it many notches above the rest. I assumed that the sangria would consist of some cheap wine with some effortless canned pears so you can imagine my surprise when some of the 7 or so barrels of sangria included Bacardi! Not to mention they were also filled with deliciousness. My favorite one (Harlem Nights or something like that?) included raspberries and blueberries and cinnamon and was so tasty, it was hard for me to try the others. I managed to force myself and was not disappointed. Some were fruity, some were light, all were delightful.Back to the beginning, I had made a reservation for 6 at 1:30, assuming (correctly) that the place would be packed. We ended up arriving fourty-five minutes late and were expecting a passive-aggresive punishment. instead, they greeted us with a smile, dismissed our apologies and whisked us right to a booth. We were intially worried by the loungey entrance but the back opens up into this big, colorful, festive room. The walls are are painted with various ""ethnic"" looking scenes and the ceilings swoop in a musical fashion. The booths are inviting and large and the whole atmosphere is just so darn lively.The food is pretty good too. I had the quesidillas which were creamy, a word I've never used to describe a quesidilla before. Especially delicious were their (oddly tiny, but fairly portioned) seasoned fries. I requested hot sauce and they brought me this plate with a variety of different sauces ranging from mild to spicy and even included some jalepenos. The service was disappointingly quick, preventing me from slamming down every sangria they had.",4,1,2,Becka G.,"Woodside, NY",14,43,2
4.0,2/17/2010,"I've only been here for the open sangria bar brunches, but I've been enough times I think I've sampled half the menu. First of all, the open sangria bar: it's awesome. They offer around 6-8 different sangrias in pitchers and you go up and help yourself (after being carded at your table, that is). The only problem is the line sometimes gets a little long and sometimes they run out of glasses. So hold on to your glasses and be a little patient - it's unlimited free booze for christssake, calm down and wait three minutes. Secondly, the food: It's good, but not great. I can tell that's the case because, despite going to brunch here about once a month for the last 6 months, I can't really recall a single dish that I loved. But nothing was ever bad, save for the cachapa de salmon (though that could be just a bad ordering decision for me since eggs and salmon are not really my thing).Thirdly, taco dude: There's a guy who comes around dispensing taquitos out of a little cart with all kinds of fixings. I think it costs like $8 or so per order. Trust me on this: one order of taquitos per every 2-3 people is more than enough, unless you want to get so full you feel like the baby alien from Alien is going to burst out of your tummy, and you're ok with that alien being made entirely of taquitos. Also really difficult to get a decent buzz going that way, even with free sangria. Lastly, desserts: If you are not so full you need to be rolled out of the restaurant just yet, the desserts are awesome, especially the bombas (South American donuts). Oh, I almost forgot about the bread. The yummy yummy bread and the delicious strawberry butter they give you with it.

The food is good...nothing extraordinary...and nothing that I would come here to seek out. The service is passable. I had a reservation for 1:45 and had to wait 20 minutes for them to get a table for me. The combination of hunger and cold made this 20 minute wait a little annoying. All that aside, the food is good. The unlimited sangria is better. The atmosphere is laid back energetic. Loud Latino music pumps into the room and bright lights make the back room swimming with energy...but as long as you stick with your table and the long sangria line there's not too much to distract you from a good brunch with good, strong drinks. Like David L. ...I too spend about 3 hours here drinking, eating and talking...the desert list is worth a look...the coconut concoction is well worth a try.

4.0,1/19/2010,"Calle Ocho is one of my favorite restaurants in all of NYC! The food is delicious, the staff is very amicable, and its brunch cannot be beat! On Sundays with an entrée you are granted the opportunity to sample, or indulge in all of their Sangria options free of charge. Although Sunday mid afternoon drinking might not be your thing, it's definitely worth checking out. The sangria is some of the best I have ever had and is just one of the many things that Calle Ocho has to offer.   The food is decent. Dinner is good, but as someone on a budget, you might be able to get more bang for your buck elsewhere. Also, for dinner, I recommend looking elsewhere if you are hoping to have a small group conversation, as it is easily drowned out by the buzz of other voices and Latin beats in the background. With a few small changes, the evening dining atmosphere can be enhanced, but brunch certainly cannot be beat!",0,0,0,Evan P.,"Washington, DC",120,862,0

At initial visual observation, the marvel that is bestowed is a sight worth appreciating!  With the array of colors ranging from the bright orange of the salmon to the vibrant white of the Lobster Mash, the entrée itself appeared more to be an art form than consumption.  Prior to ordering, I made a request to have the Salmon cooked Medium Rare.  How was the fish served?  WELL DONE! During consumption, it was revealed that the Salmon was excessively overcooked and dry.  The wonderful seasoning consisting of Paprika and Cayenne Pepper was dismissed the chance of elevating the flavors of the Salmon due to the lack of moisture within the fish.  When consumed, patrons will find that the fish is flakey and dry, which adds to a highly segmented flavor of the seasoning.  Furthermore, the Lobster Mash only contained a 0.25 oz of Lobster Meat.  It was more Mash than Lobster Mash.  Looking back, I question why I didn't send this dish back and request the Seafood Paella instead.$27.00 in the hole and slightly buzzed...  One should always heed the warnings, never order fish in a Latin America, Mexican, Cuban, or Spanish Restaurant.  Just stick to the Steak or Paella.Never again!Notes on Calle Ocho:- Two Words...  Unlimited Sangria!  With over 8 flavors to choose from, one can't help but sample each (twice)!- Learn from my mistake...  DO NOT ORDER THE FISH!  My girlfriend's Paella was pretty good.- Expect to drop about $80.00 per person.  ""Cheap"" is not a term used at Calle Ocho.",15,3,7,C M.,"New York, NY",266,454,791

I feel like this isn't authentic by any means.  I was confused if it was Spanish tapas or Peruvian food.... but since they label their place as Latin American cuisine, I'll just nod and say okay.  Their menu isn't focused it's kind of like all different ""latin american"" cuisines thrown on together.  We started off with the Tuna Tiradito ceviche.  No where on the menu it described it to have 3 different kinds of tuna ceviches.  I guess it was nice to give 3 a taste, for me it was less of a ceviche but fusioned sashimi.  One of the 3 concoction was sliced tuna sashimi with LIme Mojito drizzled on top.  Like what the Top Chef judges say, instead of making three mediocre things make one good one.  I would send that advice to the chef for the tuna ceviche.  We also got the Tamal which wasn't too memorable.We had the Lechon the pork shank to share.  The dish was very big.  The pork shank was cooked well and the sauce was very good a bit on the salty side.  They gave of ""tamal"" which tasted like grits and when it dried up it had a jello consistency.  It didn't look appealing nor did it taste so good.The jug of sangria that we ordered didn't come until our main course.  It was the worst sangria I've ever tasted.  Do Not do the sangria!!!!  I feel like all the dishes were trying to be upscale with the plate food decor.  Even if the plates looked pretty the food didn't taste good.  The ambiance is okay, very commercial and a bit cliche.  It's a modern latin feel?!

4.0,1/11/2010,"I've read many reviews of Calle Ocho's brunch, but not many for their dinner.  So for all the evening-eaters, here you are.  The fifth star was removed because of the following: After making a 8:45pm reservation on a Wednesday night, at 8pm my group of five sat in the bar area to start with some cocktails.  Around 8:50pm, I checked with the hostess who stated it would only be 5 minutes more.  Fifteen minutes after this, we checked again and were told 5 minutes. So around 9:15p, we were finally seated in the dining room.  At this point, the group was a little drunk and very hungry.  The bread arrived and the table quickly emptied the basket.  It was delicious, especially the bean dip! We shared an appetizer of Chicharon (calamari) which was very tasty, although it had pretty standard breading and marinara sauce. My first choice for an entree was the nightly special, but it must have been good because they were out. (Perhaps if we were seated 30 minutes earlier, I could've gotten lucky.) So, I chose the Spice Rubbed Salmon, Lobster Mash, Cucumber Relish, Mango Chutney. This was hands and feet down, the best salmon dish I've had in NYC since moving here over a year and a half ago.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned, each bite had overwhelming amounts of flavor and when combined with the mash, relish, and mango chutney, the overall flavors were as harmonious as a Boyz II Men song (yea that's right, I just made that reference).  I found the portion to be the perfect size, although I'm a 5'2"" woman.  But I was dining with four men who all looked equally stuffed/satisfied at the end of the meal.  In all, I would certainly return to Calle Ocho to dine and drink.

I would recommend ordering these side dishes if you are craving it, but don't go out of your way to do so.We were an hour late for our reservations, but they were extremely accommodating and treated us as if we had arrived on time. I was impressed with that! :]",4,2,3,Ellen C.,"Seattle, WA",718,1088,223

1.0,11/14/2009,"Vomitrocious!: A review that laconic sums up my experience earlier tonight at Calle Ocho. I'm still recovering from the number the vaca frita did on my stomach. Long story short we arrive at 9:22 and were told that though I had 9:30 reservations we would have to wait a ""touch"" past 9:30 because they were running behind....apparently a touch = 30 mins+. Finally seated, I ordered a Fresa (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries) sangria, and my dining companions ordered the salmon entree the other the paella and a side of sweet plantains. They were both satisfied with their meals, though agreed they were not worth the $$. I, on the other hand, in all my dining experience have never had such a violently visceral reaction to a meal. The Vaca Frita I ordered consisted of a skirt steak atop of a bead of fried rice all topped off by an overeasy, fried egg. I consider myself an adventurous eater and egg atop red meat is something I have had and enjoyed many times before.  This time, however, a few bites in and I had to stop chewing and focus intently on not spewing my food/digestive juices on my friends or the people next to us...you get the picture. At that point I was done, for the remainder of the night I snacked on the complimentary rolls (good but not as great as some of the other yelpers would have you believe). Based on the other reviews, and my experience, maybe brunch is what they do best....or maybe the unlimited sangria inhibits judgment.  : (",0,0,0,Ash H.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,51,6

Very good and we're excited to go back to try the others. Have to agree with everyone else --LOVED the bread! We ordered the array of sides as an appetizer to start. It included plantains, arepas, fries, and rice & beans and was HUGE for just two people. For our entrees we had the Gaucho and Paella. The gaucho is a meat dish, which has beef, sausage, & chorizo...delicious, but definitely a dish for the carnivore. The seafood paella was pretty good. With chicken, chorizo, calamari, mussels, clams, it also includes half of a lobster.I would say this place would be great for a date, for groups and also great for families.

1.0,11/2/2009,"I made a reservation for Sunday evening at 8pm for four people to celebrate my boyfriend's belated birthday.  We had heard great things about the food and unlimited sangria on Sunday.  We arrived promptly at 8 pm, however, we were not seated until 8:45.  The restaurant was busy but not crazy.  We should have gone with our gut (literally), walked out and gone to shake shack down the street!When we were seated, the hostess failed to give our entire party menus (I had the one I was looking at while we waited to be seated).  We couldn't find our server and after 30 minutes finally managed to flag down the manager who took our order but looked pained to do so.  We had to flag down another busboy  for bread because I was starving at this point. We order the paella, arepas, gaucho sausage, beet salad and calamari.   The gaucho sausage looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for too long and the paella smelled a bit too fishy.On top of the atrocious service and so-so food, a random server refilled my boyfriend's sangria glass with water.  So either the sangria was too clear or their water was a bit too murky.  You decide.Before we left, I spoke to the manger about our terrible dining experience.  She simply said, ""I can take your name and the next time you come in, I'll make sure it's not the same experience.""  In what world would I come back?!?",0,1,0,C P.,"New York, NY",0,77,0
3.0,10/31/2009,"Let's get right to the point while I'm still digesting.The bread is as everyone else says, quite tasty. It was served with a black bean dip/butter. My husband had a Fresas Sangria and loved it. It is blueberries, strawberries, raspberries with a rum razz. I did not drink so my head was completely clear to properly review this place.Entrees:Vaca Frita al Caballo - is not actually vaca frita! What you get is a whole churrasco (skirt steak) served with a fried egg and over fried rice & beans. Ok, vaca frita is supposed to be shredded skirt steak fried pretty close to crispy. Rice and beans should absolutely never be fried, they just taste like you over cooked your moros, or even burnt them. The only positive thing I can say about this dish is that the steak is so tender that a butter knife is all you need, and what Cuban would complain about a fried egg over their steak & rice? The steak was actually quite tasty, but it is NOT vaca frita, so don't call it that.Lechon - Well, when I think about lechon it is usually some juicy, garlicy or lemony prepared roast pork. Not here, they serve it with a mushroom sauce and tamal. The tamal is actually liquid, not bad, but certainly not a tamal. The lechon was extremely tender and fell right off the bone shank, and I didn't hate the mushroom sauce, but it just isn't the same.Dessert:Crema Catalana - Spanish Traditional Dulce de Leche Caramelized Custard. Ok, this sounded close to flan so we tried it. What we got was flan flavored crème brûlée. It wasn't bad actually.Tasting of Sorbets - Guava, Passion Fruit, Coconut Ginger. The Passion Fruit and Guava sorbets were delicious. We absolutely loved them. The Coconut Ginger was terrible. Why did they mix ginger into this when the other two were left alone? I had such a strong ginger after taste that it ruined the entire meal for me. I STILL taste ginger, an hour later, and it is driving me insane.Service:Service was great and attentive. We made a reservation and were seated immediately. The place wasn't packed when we arrived but filled up a little.Decor:The decor is lousy. There isn't a drop of Latino culture, much less Cuban culture in this place. There's a wall with a sad attempt of flavor and they do play Spanish music, but it falls flat. Poor branding:Let's discuss the name of this place: Calle Ocho. Why would you take a name that represents the epitome of traditional and authentic Cubans, and use it on a Nuevo Latino establishment without an ounce of neither tradition nor authenticity? To me that's false advertisement. From the name of the restaurant to the name of their dishes, it is one false advertisement after another. The owner seriously needs to learn about branding and labeling.That being said, I almost always do research before trying a new place and that was the case here. I knew going in that it was Nuevo Latino and I knew that most of the things on their menu didn't jump out at me. So I went in not expecting much, and yet I was still disappointed. I've tried Nuevo Latino before and have never been this disappointed, because they've always kept Latino roots in their flavors and mixes. Calle Ocho does not. They take Cuban dishes and completely take the Cuban out of them. I didn't see one other Latino there while we were there, which goes to show you. I should probably mention that I am Cuban, from Miami, and used to frequent the real Calle Ocho all the time. They are WAY too overpriced for the mediocre attempts at Latin Flare they give you.",1,0,1,Carmen O.,"Manhattan, NY",111,286,77

I've tried the tropical mango sangria and the Spanish Harlem sangria. Both were delicious. My boyfriend had the classic mojito. We started with the snapper ceviche, which was wonderful. It was very light, fresh and flavorful, and came surrounded by a garnish of buttery popcorn. I was surprised by how well the salty and crunchy popcorn went with the spicy and citrusy smoothness of the fish. The actual meal was nothing special. I had the Costa Rican taco appetizer as a meal and my boyfriend had the tilapia. The order of tacos was massive- it came with a dozen or so mini corn tortillas and steak, chicken, shrimp and a plate of salsa, guac, lettuce and sour cream- definitely a good appetizer for a group. The chicken was good, but the shrimp had a strange texture and the steak was really tough. My boyfriend's plantain-crusted tilapia was what surprised us the most. It came thickly breaded and fried, which we didn't expect from the menu description. I think we were expected a lightly coated grilled or pan fried fish with vegetables and a flavorful tropical sauce. The fish looked and tasted like it should have been served with fries in a newspaper cone. To sum up: great drinks and appetizers, mediocre and expensive (around $25) entrees.

This place is the perfect place for a date, girls day out, or a celebration - which could all happen at brunch!  The best part about Calle Ocho is their brunch. Brunch is definitely something that many restaurants in NYC have taken on (even pubs LOL) The feeling I get when walking into this place starts with a tropical Cuban adventure that leads into the main dining room where the party begins. The room is spacious and filled with color, laughter, and flowing sangria. 10 types to be exact (5 red and 5 white.) Now I'm not talking box of wine sangria. I'm talking the real thing ! Not only are their flavor combinations spot on, the fresh fruit they add to each is truly something you can't find anywhere else. From the coconut to the raspberries and peaches (did I mention these are all fresh fruit?) its hard to decide just which one to try first. Thankfully - you don't have to worry because the sangria bar is UNLIMITED!!! - Yep you heard correctly... and at no additional cost, it comes with every meal (you will only wind up spending around $15.) I've actually started a brunch with friends at 1pm and only left at 5pm because they were turning over to dinner service. Of course everyone likes a few drinks here and there, but with those drinks comes the hunger pains... and this place sure knows how to satisfy them. Make sure you get there early around 12 or 1 to order the tortilla espanola, a fabulous signature potato-like quiche surrounded by a spicy/tangy tomato sauce filled with onions, peppers, and better yet - fresh crab meat. Their strawberry butter and fresh roll assortment that they bring out to start, is truly unique and delectable. I stress the getting there early part again. Last Sunday I got a 2:45 reservation and they has already ran out of the strawberry butter and the assortment of pastries. But they filled in with the delicious rolls and their black bean dip that they serve to start as well. The staff is amazing, especially the girl who got me the last tortilla espanola in the kitchen because she remembered me from a previous time.

Our party of 8 requested ""more bread please"" three times during the course of our meal and even though we were surrounded with dishes like skirt steak with egg & avocado, crab cakes, grilled shrimp salad and a spanish omelette,  every hand kept reaching out for the basket of rolls in the center of the table. It was just THAT good.As for the actual main entrees? Well I only sampled my bf's skirt steak and my grilled shrimp salad but neither was really all that memorable. The portions were small too.

3.0,8/22/2009,"I was here on a Friday night with a party of 6.  We had a reservation and were seated fairly promptly.  The restaurant is quite large for NYC, and there is a surprising amount of space between tables.  You don't have to sit with the couple next to you, so that's a plus.I started with the provoleta, a blend of ""Argentinian cheeses.""  It came with some type of bread to eat with it.  The two things combined ended up being a lot like a mozzarella stick.  I ate two of the four bread thingies because it was just too heavy.I split a soft taco dish with a friend.  It came with shrimp, chicken, and beef fillings.  We substituted a 2nd order of chicken for the shrimp b/c of a shellfish allergy, and they were very accommodating.  The chicken was delish.  My sangria was good too ($8 per glass on a normal night).  Everybody's entree was pretty gigantic.  Those who ate their whole dinner ended up uncomfortably full.  None of us had room for dessert.  On a positive note, everyone must have enjoyed their meals to have gorged themselves.Staff was extremely helpful.  Bathrooms were clean.  It's a nice restaurant.  I don't know that I'll go back for dinner though.  It was pricey after all was said and done, and I'm not sure that the food was THAT good.  (Except maybe for the rolls you start with.  Some other reviewers mention them too.  Scrumptious!)  I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars because the place was just all right for me.  I would love to go to the brunch that everyone says is amazing though.",0,0,0,Betsy J.,"Boston, MA",24,68,5

They're tasty and generally done right.The unlimited biscuits they bring to the table is like crack. I was stuffed by the time my entree came out. There was also great purple (yes purple) hummus that came as a dip for the bread. Both went well together.As for the food, I had the seafood paella. This dish was very generous in its portions. I couldn't even finish it all. The paella was quite good and the seafood was done very well. The  lobster that came with the paella was succulent and perfect.I also had the calamari.

3.0,7/26/2009,"This is one of those occasions where my enthusiasm for the place went from 5-stars to 1-star back up to 3.Even before you sit down, Calle impresses with its outdoor flower pots, expansive entry way, long bar and ample velvet banquette seating. One feels immediately transported to a Spanish resort. Then you walk into the main dining room and to the left, unlimited sangria bar, to the right, a series of huge U-shaped booths, and ahead a curmudgeonly ol' guy pushing a little taco cart around and ringing a bell. Sensory overload!Probably to avoid over-drunkeness, the sangria bar is self-serve. Two best are mojito (white) and Spanish harlem (red). This is where things start to go downhill. The rest of the meal proceeded like an episode of Three's Company...Friend to waiter: ""It's so hot in here!""Moments later, Waiter: ""I turned down the air"" (huh, we're boiling? later they do turn down the interrogation style spotlights that are on the edge of the wall)Table to waiter: ""Will we be getting bread?""Waiter: ""Yes it's on its way""It did eventually show up and was awesome. Scones, muffins, chocolate bread, and strawberry whipped butter.Table: ""Can we have some more plates?"" (table of 6, we only had 4)Waiter: ""Yes, oh and I see your coffee is not here, let me get it.""It doesn't show until brunch is practically over. Apparently they ""ran out."" When it does come, they comp it (as they should do), and we have to ask for milk. Then we have to ask for spoons. The spoons that arrive are about 8 inches long when the coffee is served in low latte cups. Ha ha, I suspect they are for sangria, specifically digging the fruit from the bottom of your goblet.Lastly, I thought the food was average. Maybe my choice of spanish omelet was uninspired. If you go, order the cuban sandwich or the steak, as those are the favorites. Sides of chorizo and plantain won't disappoint.So why back up to 3-stars? Because even though the service was laughable, our bill worked out to be $20 each with tip included.

I am not usually a loiterer, nor did we plan to be.  I just hate that rush-rush-rush feeling at a restaurant.  But, the food was good, the sangria was tasty, and I would try it again to see if we get some better service.  I'd also give dinner a try here.",1,0,0,Elizabeth B.,"New York, NY",51,414,0

The bar was a cute romatic spot with large wire fans overhead, made you feel a bit like you might be on a tropical vacation. We had a reservation and were seated within a few minutes of arrival. The dining room proper, was more like an upscale cafeteria, incredibly loud, bright and really large with people being shuttled to their seats like cattle (with politeness, of course). The service was great from start to finish, very polite and attentive but didnt try to smother you with attention. The appetizers were a heirloom tomato salad with warm goat cheese croquettes and the pork empanada with white bean salad. Both were just delicious. Entree was a coriander rubbed salmon over quinoa salad and a pork tenderloin wrapped sausage. We ordered rice and beans as a side. Salmon was flavorful and moist, the beans were too good to even be fair and the pork was just ok (according to Joe). Dessert was doughnuts with coconut ice cream, a peanut butter mouse, and two cuban espressos which were very sweet.At one point I switched from my mojito to cava which wasn't chilled quite enough but I'll forgive it. We practically rolled out of there with how full we felt. But the meal was the best I have had in a long time and I will definitely be back for their famous brunch!

5.0,7/9/2009,"My only regret in writing this review is that is may be contributing to my difficulty in getting a seat here. Crazy delicious.This is a latin food restaurant with an upscale minimalist decor, high ceilings, and some modern seating.Most seating is chairs at tables, but at the front they have booths with small square tables, or small backless stools with square tables that are short-come up to your knees. This odd seating is just behind the host/hostess stand and along the front window. The remainder of the restaurant has standard table and chairs, except for the bar which has tall stools.If you are tall, have back issues or just want to sit at a regular table, make sure to let them know so you don't feel stuck at the odd table configurations at the front. (i didn't mind)I remember the music being kind of a techno/electronic genre.I've really be hitting the brunch spots around NYC. Brunch is my favorite meal in NYC, very often it is affordable, social, and had some kind of unlimited alcoholic drink.They send you to the back of the restaurant (if you are in the front) to get your sangria and then bring bread to the table. It is very nice to start eating something right away.I had the cuban sandwich here. It was really good, I was pretty shocked at the price versus the quality, it was affordable and tasty. I guess the dish was on the smaller side portion-wise, but it was a perfect brunch size and included plantain chips and salsa.The variety of Sangria's was great, I was able to try several things back to back and really get a feel different 'kinds' of sangria and to learn what I liked. (I suppose a purist may say their is only one kind of sangria, like there is only one kind of martini)The service was good and it was pretty easy to get in, we had reservations, which I recommend for any brunch spot I have been to.For the time being I'm gonna keep trekking to Calle Ocho until I'm absolutely eager for a change.

For our main course, we got the Salmon, Tilapia, Paella and Bistec (steak frites). The presentation was great, but the taste was too salty for our tastebuds. The Yuca Fries were impossibly overfried and the watercress salad did not match the steak, but the steak itself was good. I was just a tad disappointed with the overall quality and it was an expensive meal. They should pay more attention to the food.

If you like meat this is the place to go. We started with bread balls along with a side of black bean dip which was a welcomed surprise to a simple starter.Once we ordered a round of drinks it was off to getting into the main course. My friend and I decided to split what she likes to call the Platter of heaven which consisted of skirt steak, chorizo, pork, and chicken all over a bed of grilled veggies. It was such an epic dish that it took 4 outta the 5 people to finish it! Of this dish I would have to admit that my favorite part was the skirt steak and the grilled asparagus that came with it. The different flavors exploded and it was a little peace of heaven for sure! We also decided to order the ahi tuna which was another grand dish, not being too fishy or too salty either. The goat cheese tamale was an interesting selection simply because I had no idea what goat cheese was but the taste of mushrooms erased any doubt I had in my mind.Overall this was a very pleasant experience and I would easily suggest those who want to try something different with a flair to come here.

I personally like to mix the Havana Banana and Tropical.Calle Ocho is just fabulous. Fabulous for big groups, fabulous for friends, and fabulous for families. This is just the type of place where me and my cuzins could get down. Too bad they are all on the West Coast. Brunch is cheap here and there isn't any long obnoxious wait time like those other famous NY spots. But just because the brunch is cheap (affordable and reasonable rather) doesn't mean it falls short on flavor, presentation, or punch. Pretty much everything you get at Calle Ocho will be outstanding beginning with the bread basket (an array of mini muffins and yuca bread) and ending with the multiple glasses of sangria. Multiples. Yes.I love the Vaca Frita. The steak isn't over done and it is just so tasty on top of tasty rice and the plate is even piled on with sliced tomatoes, avocado, and onions. It's all real refreshing and satisfying. It even has a side of egg (which I have just recently started to embrace). On my first visit to Calle Ocho, they gladly gave us egg whites. On my second visit, the waitress was adamant that there were no substitutions allowed. What's up with that? The menu states you can get the dish with two eggs to your liking. I do not like sunny side up. I like egg whites. The yolks used to cause me death.I also shared a cuban sandwich with my friend. The cuban sandwich came with pickles. I am not and never will be a fan of pickles. But since it was Calle Ocho and everything is fabulous, i decided to give it a try. And it was good! The bread they used for the sandwich was more like a fried tortilla. The cuban sandwich also came with latino chips. I wasn't sure if some of those chips were banana but for sure some were yuca. My hands were just in a bag of Terra vegetable chips and there is yuca in there. But man oh man you can get freshly fried yuca chips at Calle Ocho and there is no comparison. Their salsa is pretty good too.All this good chips and salsa could have one reminiscing about Chevys. I corrected my friend, ""Please do not insult Calle Ocho. It is no Chevys."" Calle Ocho is so much better. It surpasses Chevys and La Pinata in every way.   Oh and Calle Ocho serves up a side of Kyle J every time. I met him for the first time at Calle Ocho. That was before I found out he was an undercover Yelper. And then I ran into him again there. What can I say? Yelper's know good eats!",16,4,11,Rachel A.,"Brooklyn, NY",732,1493,1730

3.0,6/7/2009,"Buffets of any sort are dangerous for someone like me, who has to try every option. I tried seven of the eight. There's a banana-lychee, tropical (mango), mojito, white (just...white), and with the darks, one with vanilla, and the others weren't so memorable. The best was the banana-lychee (lightest) and the mojito was rather strong. Fruit could've been better (what, no lychees for the banana-lychee one? only coconuts?). Some instructions:Pour from the pitcher, and don't ladle from the big jars (oops).Before you get in line, feel free to look at the options, so you don't dilly dally when you are in front of the sangria. The people in line need to get their drink on.Read the instructions posted above the buffet (no taking the pitchers back to the table, use the ladles, not your hands). Laugh. An hour later, when you're dancing on the sangria table, you can tell yourself, ""That sign did tell me so.""You're liable to have conversations with other tables. I was staring at a girl who was angrily gesticulating at her companions, trying to figure out if she was mad at them or if she was mad about her topic (e.g. global warming, etc.)--this was after trying my sixth sangria. She noticed me staring, and said, ""WHAT, am I entertaining you?"" ""Yeah, a bit,"" accompanied by the index and thumb gesture. ""You want to take a picture, huh?"" ""No camera or I would,"" sad shrug.Non-sangria related: the bread is warm, slightly cheesy (it's mixed in the dough somehow) and fantastic. The wait for two people at 2:20pm was only about 15 minutes, which surprised me, but I didn't realize it had so many tables. The room is huge.

Truth be told, the place looks inviting but looks are not enough in a place like Manhattan, the food is simply put, okay. Plus, let's face it, the service is pretty terrible (if I want to wait that long for anything, I'll go to a theme park & just 'cause it's NYC doesn't make it alright).I on the overall, throughout the years, have enjoyed my meals here  (been here twice & both times dinner) but it's not a place that's worth more than one visit, if that (I can get okay Cuban food for cheaper else where).

I've been to Calle Ocho probably about seven times since I've lived in New York, which is about seven months...so, you do the math. The ambiance is classy, and latin-inspired. You definitely feel like you're in a nice place. The food is delicious. My favorite dish is the Tortilla Espanola, which is a quiche-like delight with potatoes, and egg, I think...but it comes in a cast-iron pan with peppers and crab. I also love the Huevos Divorciados, which is basically crab cakes and eggs. My description doesn't do it justice.But, the best part of brunch at Calle Ocho is the sangria. There are probably about 10 different kinds -- both white and red -- and you can help yourself to as much as you like. It's basically a sangria buffet. You don't have to ask the server for it, so you don't feel like an alcoholic, constantly bothering the server for another drink. Warning: do be careful with how much you drink. After sitting there for an hour or two drinking unlimited sangria, you can definitely get a bit sloshed. Also, you should know that you'll want to take a nap immediately afterward, so if you have something important to do later in the day, skip the sangria. The prices are pretty reasonable, especially with all the sangria you get. My bill usually comes out to be between $12 and $20, depending on what I get.

I was pondering what to drink (beer or mixed drink?) when our server told me this and within less than a minute I was on line, sampling the selection of sangrias. I opted for the mango sangria for starters. This was my second time at Calle Ocho but the first was for dinner and I was on the date from hell. But many of the dishes that enticed me that night were represented on the brunch menu, too. Bonus. My partner in crime ordered pollo ranchero, while I opted for the vaca frita (ie Cuban skirt steak) -- both were pretty good, especially considering the modest prices (about $11 for each). The pollo ranchero didn't approach Cafe Habana/La Esquina status but it was definitely tasty, whereas the Vaca Frita -- served with Latin rice, tomato escabeche and an avocado -- satisfied my Sunday morning hambre. Stumbling back to the sangria bar for second and third rounds, we skipped the coconut and berry sangrias and went straight for the mojitos. Mojito sangrias? Never heard of this before but it was pretty damn good and included copious amounts of rum. Service was friendly, if a bit spotty, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since  the place was packed with screaming kids and big groups. The lounge area, incidentally, was bustling at noon on Sunday, just minutes after the joint opened. Would I return to Calle Ocho? Hells to the yeah. My only advice is to pace yourself and make sure your plate is cleared for the rest of the day.

You go to the sangria bar and pour to your heart's content. Parents, red in the face, laugh at their screaming babies, couples make out in the near the bathrooms, people shimmy and sashay to the loud Latin music as they make their way to more sangria. Calle Ocho keeps their lights turned on all the way up because if they lowered them it would start an orgy. They don't  take reservations, thus, the front room was spilling over with people lounging with their sangria. I had the mango and the mojito--- both tolerably sweet, well mixed, and refreshing--- the fruit tasted very fresh. That stuff was no joke though, my friend always put vodka in her sangria and I think Calle Ocho does the same--- lots of vodka, you don't even taste it, it's wrong.My very polite friend had the Vaca Frita al Caballo which is Cuban skirt steak, Latin fried rice, tomato escabeche, and avocado. He got it without the avocado--- wouldn't you know it, they got his order perfectly and announced it at the table with a sense of pride. The steak was tender and the fried rice had great bite and flavor.  The service is mixed. I got carded! I gave her an incredulous look, boarderline dramatic prairie dog style. I was about to whip out my ID out but our server lost her nerve and just gave some line about not wanting to get arrested... dude. Next, a back-waiter standing right in front of steak knives could not get one for us--- poor newbie, surfing around in a sea of people who can get extra drunk because they don't drive will make you delirious. Oh, and the server didn't ask my friend how he wanted his steak--- it just turned up well done which was fine because it was delicious/we were too tipsy to notice (but now I remember, yeah, my memory is awesome like that).I got the pollo rancheros--- not the best I've ever had (cookshop heuvos rancheros are my god)--- but tasty. I was expecting just a little more flavor, it was very nice though. They brought lots of hot sauces for me in little dishes that made for a neat and appetizing presentation. The more I think about this place as a whole rather than some tedious service points--- the more I love it. Next time I come here it'll be for a victory brunch (i.e. I did work all night, I cured cancer, I ran seven miles) and I'll get fucked up enough so that management will just think about closing the sangria bar but don't actually do it.

5.0,3/9/2009,"I went to Calle Ocho on a warm Saturday night for dinner - the place is lively, loud and with nice enough mood lighting. After being led through the bar - the restaurant part of the place hidden in the back - you reach a huge dining area. Our seats (two people) were in the corner by a huge dinner party, and while it was a little cramped, it added to the atmosphere (for the most part).I had the paella and a mojito - stunning. The mojito came with a huge stick of cane sugar, and was about as perfectly made as any I've ever tasted. The Paella was piled high with...well...everything. Including a large hunk of lobster, still in the shell. It was an absolutely delicious meal.The only slightly low point (if you can call it that) were the Bombas - maybe it's my ignorance, but there was so much sugar over them that it was nigh-on impossible to eat them without crunching down on it. The filling and the ice cream were delicious, though.All in all, I will be back. Especially considering that mojtios are $5 on Mondays.

Free Sangria buffet all day brunch or dinner! 7-8 different types of sangria - both red and white. My personal favorite is the Spanish Harlem - a fruity but full bodied red sangria. Literally there were 8 barrels of sangria on a table and you just help yourself.The food is so well priced for brunch - entrees are from $9 to $14 (Sangria included). My personal favorites are the Latin Benedict, the Cuban Sandwich and Vaca Frita. The servers are always flexible with changes and substitution, which is a really refreshing change from other brunch places with the unlimited alcohol. But the best part of sunday brunch at calle ocho is the bread basket!

4.0,3/2/2009,"We had a group of 11 for a birthday brunch yesterday and we couldn't be more pleased with every aspect. First was the ambiance of the restaurant. When you first walk in it looks like a tiny place, but when they take you back to the restaurant you walk into an open floor plan with warm colors and tons of tables. When the birthday girl told us it was a Sangria brunch, I thought they'd have one or two varieties, but I was wrong. There were multiple varieties of both red and white Sangria, with descriptions of each variety. Next up is the menu. There were so many different options that sounded delicious, that I had a hard time picking out what to eat. We each got something different and everything was amazing. The portions were perfect and the prices very reasonable. We capped off the brunch with coffee from a press and it was some of the best coffee I've ever had.

DELISH!The menu is sort-of a Pan-Latin fusion, done up for the Upper West Side. I ordered the Pollo Ranchero, which was good, though portions are small to moderade in size. My friend liked her crab-cakes but said she preferred the pollo. The plantains are yummy, half are green tostones and half are ripe platanos, perfect for dessert! The bread basket was great too--the pao de queijo really made me want to go back to Brazil!Warning: Sunday brunch is BUS-Y. We had a reservation for 3:15 and thankfully they allowed us to change it to 1pm, surprising since, when we got there, they were completely booked and were not even keeping a waitlist. The only caveat is that because the place was jam-packed, there was always a line for sangria (mostly waiting for more clean glasses, which they ran out of often).

I expected mediocre sangria and mediocre food given the prices and the gimmick but my expectations were exceeded in every way.  The sangria is a serve-yourself bar in glass barrels.  Six different variations.  It truly was a difficult moral decision for me to decide between trying new sangria or sticking with the delectable variations I had chosen already.  The Harlem variety was my favorite.  I also enjoyed the wintery mix which had cloves and vanilla within its flavorful, seasonal clutches.Sign me up.",2,0,1,Layla C.,"Montclair, NJ",129,542,0

There is loud Cuban music blasting in the background, and the place is a bit noisy. I also felt this place had no soul.  Despite the food being very good, everything else about the place was BLAH.  They have excellent drinks, I had a Rain Caprinha! They also bring out nice bread baskets accompanied with a bean spread.  We went for restaurant week, and I had the ceviche, which was probably the best ceviche I have ever had! My BF had the sopa and it was tasty! For dinner, he had the corvina and I had the loma (pork loin).  My entree also came with sweet potato puree, but really it was way too sweet. The rest was good though!  We also had a dessert, some sort of cheesecake, topped with guava sorbet. The sorbet was way too sweet for me.

4.0,2/1/2009,"I can't get over what a deal this brunch was! For unlimited sangria and tasty Latin bread baskets, an entree, and a cup of coffee, I spent $20! I am so impressed. The sangria was really good- it wasn't watered down and didn't taste like it was made from shitty wine or anything. And there are seven different kinds! I liked the tropical white sangria and the red with tamarind in it.I didn't loooove my entree (smoked salmon and scrambled eggs in a corn crepe), but I liked it enough to scarf it down in about two minutes. I don't know that I'd recommend it, though. The waiter told me it was his favorite, so maybe others would like it more. Honestly, though, I would have been perfectly happy with sangria and bread. Try the bean dip that comes with the bread! It is surprisingly tasty, even on the rolls with chocolate chips in them. Apparently black bean dip goes with everything. Who knew.This is a perfect place for brunch with your ladies (and boys- it was a pretty equal mix). It's HUGE, so there's plenty of room for groups (though the booth was a tad squished and not the most convenient for hopping up and down for refills at the sangria bar). The decor is big and bold, lending it a Vegas-y feel, which makes even more conducive to sitting around and stuffing your face. And, best of all, they didn't rush us out- we sat there for a good hour after we finished our food, just nursing our delicious sangrias. That was a definite bonus. I get the feeling that you could sit there all day and they wouldn't give you shit. I will definitely be back.",1,0,0,Emily A.,"Richmond, CA",61,156,0

Good Food:Our starter was the salmon ceviche (house cured salmon, aji amarillo, sour orange, pineapple, $11); quite good and not as sour as ceviche usually is.  The aji amarillo pepper was not overpowering at all, and the pineapples were even grilled before they were cubed (nice touch).  A pleasant surprise was the popcorn served with the ceviche.  The older kid ordered the Pollo (grilled chicken breast, pigeon pea asopao, green plantain fritters, $21), and the younger one and I split the Paella (lobster, mussels, clams, shrimps, scallops, chorizo, chicken, tomato-calamari salad, $29).  I was disappointed with the paella as the rice was undercooked.  Luckily, the little one filled up on the bread (and, earlier in the day, a cheeseburger, shake, and ""Candy Caned"" custard from Shake Shack for lunch, and a big cookie from Starbucks for a snack--YES, I AM an awesome dad), as she did not dig the paella nor the ceviche.  We all liked the chicken, although none of us liked the asopao (probably good asopao based on other Yelpers, we just didn't like it).I have to note that the rolls they served were intriguing.  They were the size of those Superballs you buy from vending machines that bounce a mile high before disappearing down the street and, to some extent, just as chewy.  I'm not saying I liked them, just saying that I kept eating them until the kids slapped my hands and told me to save my appetite for dinner.  ""What?  You're not the boss of me!""Of course, no meal/life lesson would be complete without a demo of responsible drinking, so I limited myself to a Co-jito (a coconut mojito made with Malibu Rum, lime, sugar, and mint, and served in a coconut shavings-rimmed glass, $10).  ""See, kids?  Daddy's eating fruit.""Dessert--yeah, most of this was for me--consisted of churros (included a dulce de leche dip and a syrup with pepper seeds, $8), and a Cuban (sweet expresso-like coffee, $3.5).2. Relaxed Environment:This being a Cuban restaurant, the theme was obviously Latin-based.  We appreciated that the music was not too loud, but loud enough to mask the other conversations in the spacious dining room.  Service was very good (although our server forgot my Co-jito, she comped it).  The manager also came by to say ""hi"" as I had booked the reservation through Opentable.com and told them that this was the kids' first trip to NYC.3. Wonderful Convos:We did the child-friendly version of ""Marry, Kill, F*ck"" and now know neither would have blended spinach over sautéed Brussels sprouts; it's probably better to be killed by a dull guillotine than an arrow to the head (the older one has a sick sense of humor), and they love ME better than their mom (I think they said that because I told them child labor laws are loosely enforced in NYC).  We also gossiped (""Billy has cooties?  Yeah, all boys are infected.  Stay away as it isn't cured until they're like 1,001-years old, or dead.  Would I lie to you?""); and generally messed around.  Hmm, not unlike most of my dates, except this meal was more cerebral.Come to think of it, anyone have the number for CPS?  I should call and turn myself in when we return to LA.",8,9,9,George T.,"Los Angeles, CA",282,333,799

We of course finished the basket in no time and were waiting for our food when he brought us out another pastry basket, this time with more pastries but different types from what we had had before! I had the tortilla espanola and the hubby had the huevos rancheros. Both were large portions and tasted great. My tortilla espanola was a little unexpected. I thought that it would look more like a Spanish frittata since I have had it at different restaurants before, but what came out shocked me. It had a lot of peppers and onions that had been sauteed on the side and was topped with a tomato sauce.

But it's airy on the inside and the decor is quite pretty. It actually reminded me of a restaurant at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas (y'know the one where there fake clouds painted on the high ceiling so you would always think it is daylight outside). Anyway, Brunch was festival and fun.  They had many types of sangria to choose from and a lot of it too. And furthermore, the sangria had nice, huge chunks of wine-soaked fruit in it.  I loved that.It was a lively atmosphere -maybe because people were drinking there for a while?  People seemed happy and it was great for people-watching.  Oh - be warned - it's crowded -- so  It probably would be a good idea to make a reservation before you go.  But there is a big waiting/bar area if you do have to wait.The only downfall is  - hate to say this --  the food. It's not bad. It was just small - and plain. The crab-cake entree was TINY and they had run out of a lot of dishes (probably the good ones) by the time we sat down (it was toward the end of their brunch hours). The cuban sandwich was good-  it wasn't oily or too dry.  It was better after I dipped it into some of the sauce that came with the crab cakes.Our waiter was very nice and attentive.

It is large enough for two dudes to eat it for a pre-party meal. $25 is a great deal.for dinner i have had the Paella which we just ok. Nice fresh seafood, but the flavors were weak. The strip steak was HUGE and if you get it rare it is like raw rare so be sure you like it really rare. The flavors are pretty toned down in my opinion. But you must remember where it is. It is an upper west side joint that is popular with the yuppie UWS'ers. If that place was in the east village nobody would go there. Seems like corporate food.

I think this place has the most incredible brunch selections along with the UNLIMITED Sangria (Who can beat that!). I must say though that in my opinion as far as brunch goes, this place is really better for ONLY Large Groups. It's very lively, gets crowded and pretty loud. Not a very relaxing spot to brunch for 2. I would not suggest this place as a brunch spot for couples, It's way too hectic for that. If you have family in town or are entertaining a group of friends then this is the spot you want to come to.

With no room for dessert, we promised that we'd visit again for Sunday brunch.  To top it off, the service was quite good.  Definitely one of the better serviced meals I've had in New York.  The waiter folder our napkins after each time we got up and even brought us a big to-go box of bread as we left since we loved the bread so much.  Nice touch and well appreciated!",0,0,0,B C.,"New York, NY",15,53,0

I went with a friend who told me that it was named after 8th Street in Miami. And you definitely get that vibe as soon as you walk up to the white doors and leafy green plants outside. So Miami. So cute. Inside it's exposed brick everywhere and the main bar with a cocktail seating area. This area is a bit cramped and it is indeed very noisy and was very busy for a Monday night, but I'm guessing that either had to do with restaurant week or just for the fact that it's a really fun, happening hangout. We went to the bar for drinks while we waited to be seated and despite it being pretty damn busy and expecting to have to wait several minutes to get the attention of the bartender, he looked right up at me and I had no problem ordering. We get escorted to our table in the back dining area, which is much more open and yes still a little noisy, but it has that lovely unpretentious charm to it. We ordered a pitcher of the tropical white sangria which had pineapple, mangoes and lemongrass in it. For two people, I expected more of a carafe than the water-sized pitcher it came in. Glorious. And delicious. I prefer white sangria with dinner, it's lighter and easier to drink with food. We ordered the oyster shooters and goat cheese empanada for apps. Both great though I would have preferred the oysters on the shell. I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass in Sea Urchin butter for my entree and my friend ordered the Cuban Steak.  The sea bass was cooked to perfection. All the flavors of the dishes we ordered complimented each other so well. Amazing. By the end of the night the pitcher of sangria was empty save for the fruit and we left two very happy and full guests. And they gave us each a $25 gift certificate to use by Sept. Nice gesture, I have no idea how they decide to give these things out, but I will definitely be coming back to use them. And free sangria on Sundays?

3.0,7/28/2008,"All the secondary attractions are first rate. That is, service, sangria, dessert. The service was extremely attentive without being oppressive. Your glass is always full but you never remember asking for it to be filled. I wouldn't trust my own opinion on wine, but I thought the white sangria was actually better than the red. The desserts were not cheap, but tasty.Alas, I wasn't impressed by my duck entree, or for that matter the entrees my friends let me sample. That would cut this place down to 2 1/2 stars if that was possible.Would I come here again? Absolutely...part of that great service was the $25 gift certificate they laid on everybody in the party =).If you want excellent service that'll guarantee your evening will start off smoothly, this is a good place.

Last night I took my wife to the city for her birthday, on the recommendation of a local policeman and after not being able to find the place we were looking for, we ended up at Calle 8.  To be honest, we were looking for a small place to have some snacks, or a small (good) tapas place.  Going past the bar, we thought ""great"", then they showed us to a big loud dining room.  The place is nice, clean, and very trendy.Atmosphere would be good for a bunch of friends or a big family, even for a group of colleagues to go grab a bite after work.  Not for a couple to celebrate a mellow birthday. Food was not impressive by any means.  My wife ordered the ceviche, and it wasn't really like ceviche.... it was more like a fruity chutney dressing thrown on some shrimp, and served with ""popcorn?"".  I ordered the ""ropa vieja"", which was served ""cafeteria style"".  That meant, on a metal tray, like they serve lunch at the school cafeteria in Puerto Rico.  Great idea, but when you serve hot food on a cold metal tray, the food gets cold really fast.  The meat was good, but too much garlic was waaay overpowering.  I don't mind having a nice pricey meal at any given time, I mind when the food is not even close to worth it.  The mojito wasn't very impressive at all, maybe the bartender was in training, tasted like a lemonade with the tiniest hint of mint, and no taste of rum.......bad..... Sad, it's a nice concept that is not really well executed.  I must say, everyone from the hostess to the server and the buss guys were very attentive.  Great old school salsa music playing way too loudly, can't really enjoy a quiet conversation.  As a Cuban/Puerto Rican who enjoys a good meal, it was disappointing.",0,0,0,Ricardo S.,"Stewartsville, NJ",0,43,3

Anyways, we ordered the ceviche which was pretty good, along with a beet salad and the pimento rellenos. The bread basket was awesome, tasted a lot like sweet flat bread.

But seriously have the Mojitos they really are BEST in the city.  Only downside I would say is where they seat you, when making reservations make sure that you ask to be seat in the booth or in the middle of the room.

Immediately, sweet bread w/ black bean dip appeared on our table and it was just as advertised...delicious!  We had to hold back... next came the mambo sangria ($10) and the peach mojitos ($8); both were spot on and some of the best i've tasted. It was a little light on the ETOH, but still good nevertheless.We had the special shrimp ceviche of the day w/ pinnapple ($15)....unbelievably good and refreshing. We could have eaten 10 of these dishes.  I had the vaca frita (skirt steak $22) and my companion had the paella ($28). The paella was to the brim w/ half a lobster, mussels, clams, chirizo, and shrimp...it was awesome and enough for both of us. The skirt steak was ok, tender but I was not overwhelmed by it.

4.0,6/25/2007,"Located about 73 blocks higher than its name implies, it's fitting b/c everything a bit higher than expected at this pan-Latin spot (inc. the prices).The lounge is much bigger than a simple waiting room.  With some seats and couches available, it's set up to be a destination to itself.  With their great Latin cocktails (tasty mojitos, caipirinhas, and sangrias - all with several variations) and a mix of tapas/ceviches/latin-based apps, Calle Ocho is a worthwhile stop for a quick drink and bite even if you're not coming for dinner.The main room is hidden from lounge view and is quite grand itself.  There's definitely some background buzz but I just expect that in a Latin restaurant...I'd be more concerned if it was quiet...The menu bounces around Latin American cuisine with ceviches (6 of them for $10-$14/each), appetizers such as Empanadas, Arepas, and Tamals ($10-$12), and main dishes like Seafood Paella ($28/can serve about 1 1/2), Vaca Frita (25, Cuban Skirt Steak), and a Mojo-crusted Pork Chop.After being started off with some lemony bread and so-so black bean dip, we went with the Lobster and Rock Shrimp ceviche and it was very good.  A bit tiny, though, espec. for $14....We split the Seafood Paella and Vaca Frita.  The Seafood Paella was very tasty and came with two nice pieces of lobster (one claw), several  mussels, and your standard mix of saffron rice, scallops, chorizo, etc.  This was really good and, while on the pricy side, I'd say it's worth it.The Vaca Frita was good but I didn't love it.  It's super tender - almost as if they were prepping the meat to be pulled for Ropa Vieja.  While it was nicely spiced and portioned, I kind of felt like I've had just as good for cheaper at other places.  The Latin fried rice it came with was good but It was disappointing there wasn't another side like plantains or Yuca fries.We finished the meal off with a Tres Leches cake that I just found ok.All in all, I enjoyed the food, drink, and environment but the food prices are a bit too steep.  Maybe I'm just spoiled b/c there's enough tasty reasonably priced Latin food in NYC...Note:  Only available for brunch on Sundays.",3,0,1,Scott R.,"Austin, TX",309,784,12
3.0,6/24/2007,"This place was alright.  However, I wasn't impressed with the food for its cost.  I got lechon for $23 which was not what I expected.  I guess I was expecting a Filipino style of lechon which is a pig roasted over a fire which has a crunchy skin but very soft flesh.  My meal however, was missing the crunchy outer layer and the meat, although very soft, was not that tasty.  I was also annoyed by the fact that I was served their stout on tap with so much head that I did not drink it immediately.  Despite these minor problems, I did enjoy the atmosphere.  The lighting was soft, the restaurant area is very open, it wasn't too crowded on a Saturday night, and the staff was nice.",1,0,1,O R.,"Woodhaven, NY",3,13,0

Fancy fancy feel.PAELLA. could there BE any more succulent seafood?and the endless little balls of bread basket heaven. blackbean(?) dip goes with perfection. don't go crazy though. I learned my lesson. My poor paella had to be packed halfway through.SANGRIA ROJAS. one of the best i've had. not too tart. just enough fruit.Oyster shooters are a no-no. alcohol overpowers the oysters.. for me at least. and feel a little bad for your wallet because it will be used and abused.,2,1,2,Yui K.,"San Francisco, CA",72,247,37

Oh, and I nearly forgot - the bread buns - warm and sweet!!! Keep 'em coming...Cons: We tasted out most of the ceviche and other appetizers, all were merrily consumed, but to tell you the truth, none blew us away, especially considering that they are a tad pricey.",0,0,0,Joe N.,"Manhattan, NY",16,7,0

5.0,3/26/2007,"Holy moly this place was amazing.  I have the tendency to expect things/places/life in general to fail to live up to my expectations.  But, gosh darn it, Calle Ocho proved me wrong.  The drinks, appetizers and entrees were all stellar.  The mojitos come adorned with a sugar cane stick, which would make any 20-something-year old kid happy.  I had the salmon and the boyfriend had another fish dish (I forget which one--sea bass sounds right), and both were incredible.  The portions don't quite match the price (not surprising or unusual, though)... but for the fast-paced, energetic atmosphere and Latin music serving as a soundtrack, Calle Ocho is definitely worth a trip.",3,0,3,Laura T.,"New York, NY",3,10,0

Definitely worth the trek to the Upper West side of town. We're still dreaming about the after-dinner drinks: slightly warm Romano Sambuca with 3 coffee beans floating around. Suck the beans.

5.0,1/21/2007,Has some of the best latin cocktails (think mojito/sangria/caipirinha) of any restaurant in NYC. The bread is awesome.

The food is surprisingly good and hearty (not too much to handle). The place itself is enticing with a deceptively shallow front-end with the bar and lounge area, til it opens up as you walk in the back to an expansive space.
