3.0,4/27/2019,"I want to give this place a 4 or 5-star, but my recent experience wasn't quite perfect. They overcooked my $100+ dollar steak, which is hard to forgive, especially since that was the only main dish and kind of ruined my mood for the night, which not even a $2000 bottle of wine could fix.The staff is always extremely friendly, and I love the casual fine dining vibe of the location. The decor feels very cozy and reminds of you old school New York, and you can easily have a conversation with a big group.Food is overpriced as is with most fine dining spots, but it actually tastes pretty good, unlike most fine dining spots. Some of the memorable dishes I've eaten here include the rigatoni, cacio e pepe, and the goat cheese ravioli. The flavors for all of those dishes were on point, and pastas were perfectly creamy. Unfortunately, my dry aged steak was cooked medium, so it was tough and dry. I didn't bother finishing it since it was disgusting.The bread and butter are also delicious! Get the mini baguette when it's hot.For group reservations, I wish we could select a few more things on the menu, but they were accommodating about ordering stuff off the menu. The group reservation staff responses were also a bit slower, so make sure you leave plenty of time for negotiating a contract.Overall, you'll get an excellent fine dining experience while also eating pretty tasty food. Just maybe skip the steak, unimpressionable dessert, and most appetizers since they're not really worth it.",0,0,0,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",23,200,0
3.0,4/12/2019,"I came here after 6 years and I have to say the service (which was so very kind in 2013) has suffered. The bartender who served us while we waited for the rest of our party of 5 was snobbish to me, and our server at our table could not be bothered. She had to be flagged down multiple times and when she did come to our table, she spoke to us very peremptorily. The sommelier was also not super enthused after we told him we wanted a bottle under $100 (I guess last time we didn't ask about price and the old adage about money garnering better service went into play). The quality of the food was mixed. We got the seafood salad app (which was excellent last time) and while it was fresh, it was uninteresting (and for $30, quite pricy). The cod croquettes were excellent. And the shrimp cocktail was also good. We got both fish entrees and the steak entree. The fish were both excellent (not overdone like last time) but the steak was extremely overdone and tough to cut and chew. We got a couple of desserts and the cheese plate which I had loved last time. The cheese plate was still great (though quite sparse with 3 tiny lengths of cheese) and the desserts were also good. Not sure I'd recommend this place because of the service and how expensive the meal was for a mixed bag.",0,0,0,Abeer H.,"Jackson Heights, NY",46,290,1

The plates of pasta solid. Both pastas were cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of sauce and seasoning. The cod was tender and had an Asian twist to it which made it stand out.

5.0,3/23/2019,"Excellent food and exceptional service. Visited the restaurant for a birthday celebration out of town, so we didn't know what place would be good, and had to rely on good old yelp to help us find a place and weren't disappointed! Every bite we had was amazing! Started with yellow and red beet salad, seared foie gras, and ravioli to share. For entrees we had the NY strip steak and racks of lamb. And for desert we had the apple tart with vanilla ice cream. It would be very difficult to pick a favorite dish, as each and every one was full of flavor, I'd happy to have it every meal. One extra nice touch was the server's assistant Latif, he was so attentive to our table! Definitely made the difference! No one in our party could drink, so our total bill was quite bit low as well! Definitely a place to return on next visit to NY. Things to note for newbies like us, restaurant keeps card on hold for reservations in case of no shows and will charge $50 in case of such, saw this on a confirmation page after reservation was made, good thing we were able to commit and did not need to make any changes. The place was on a bit chilly side, so a light cardigan or blazer would have been great.",0,0,0,Aia S.,"Boston, MA",0,6,4

4.0,3/23/2019,"Really nothing to criticize about this place as the service, the ambiance, the food are all great.

3.0,3/3/2019,"I stopped here for a work dinner, the restaurant has a dining area set lower (watch the stairs as you enter and then step down again into the dining pit) and a long bar to the left-hand side. Coat check at the front, and check-in with the lady closer to the bar.Drink was spilled on the way to the seat, and they very nicely made me another. Bread to start was a multi-grain, whole wheat sourdough (tasty) and a hard baguette (tough). Asked and received a small plate of olive oil (which the table shared).Tried appetizers:- Tuna Tartar w/ cucumber shiso and miso, clean and refreshing- Deviled eggs with creme fraiche and golden trout roe, a nice touch of salty on the creamy center- Grilled tiger prawns - on the dry side, not good for me, too smoky, tooDinner mains:- tagliatelle - wild mushroom, al dente and savory but not overwhelming- long island duck breast was cooked well from a display perspective, but didn't stand out with much flavor- rack of lamb w/ swiss chard, potato puree, onion and reduction - done well and not too gamy, consistency and pink was just right- miso cod - disappointed, the miso flavor tasted simply drizzled on the top of the well-cooked fish, but had no infusion of flavor like you would get at NobuDessert:- gotham chocolate cake - too bitter for me, and I don't like salty ice cream- pear souffle - light and puffy, delicious end to a mealOverall, service was top-notch and the food was a little hit-and-miss.

1.0,2/16/2019,"Michelin, really? I had higher expectations from you. Grumpy waiter, dated interior and the pear soufflé killed all my hopes and dreams. I specifically chose this place for a soufflé, and it broke my heart. The pear soufflé costs $22. It took time. However, it tasted like jolly ranchers. Just pure pear syrup, artificial flavor.. had to send it back. The waiter was reluctant and questioned my taste, saying ""that's what it's supposed to taste like."" Got a replacement chocolate cake which was nothing else but just a cake. The food is average and service below average.",1,0,0,Jane C.,"New York, NY",2,48,748
3.0,2/12/2019,"We came here for restaurant week lunch and it was very disappointing overall.I think the service is wonderful and I would give it five stars. For a starter, I had the curried soup and tasted just like an Indian dhaal. It was a little weird to me though as it did not taste like a soup somehow, it was too thick and seemed like a plain curry that would have paired better with rice and I found the flavor to be overly bitter. I tried the ceviche which my friend ordered and the flavor palette was superior to mine except the portion size was tiny. For the entree, I had the pan roasted chicken. I felt it was better than the soup but still left much to the imagination. I mean I imagine chicken to be paired with sides usually. It was a decent chicken and had some sauce but it didn't wow me and I finished all the glaze that came with it in the first few bites and then the second half of the experience, the chicken was dry/unseasoned.My friend had the vegetable risotto, and again, I felt the flavor was stronger for that than the chicken. However, she was not full.Overall, I felt the food was sub par. For example, even the free bread was hard like a rock. I'm a bit perplexed and wonder if they let their quality or menu options slide because it was restaurant week or because it was lunch? Overall it makes me wary to try out Michelin starred restaurants as I fear they may be overhyped as this one was.",3,1,0,Tina S.,"New York, NY",112,197,226

Everything from the appetizers to dessert are well done and beautifully plated. What stood out to me was their chocolate cake. It melted in my mouth. The sponge was so delicious, and unlike any cake I had before.

3.0,1/27/2019,"My friend and I came to Gotham Bar and Grill for a weekday lunch. We had a 1 pm reservation and I was seated promptly. The restaurant was busy but not every table was full nor was it crazy. I was offered a drink menu and I started with a glass of wine, before it arrived at the table my friend showed up. She placed her drink order which was delivered as we began to mull over the menu. The waiter never checked in on us nor did he reappear. We saw staff with a bread basket handing out warm rolls so we asked for one, and the server obliged. It was an extraordinary amount of time until our server came to take our food order. We both ordered from the Lunch 3 Course $48 menu: - The Seafood Salad- The Bucatini Cacio E Pepe- (2) Miso Marinated Black Cod with bok choy, shiitake mushrooms, sticky rice, soy lemongrass- Gotham Chocolate Cake- Assorted SorbetWe had decided to split the appetizer, first course, and desserts which we had mentioned to the waiter. The food came out very slow, it was delicious and precise. Perfectly presented and no need for accoutrements.  As we eagerly awaited each next course we also eagerly awaited ordering another drink. The surrounding tables came and went and we didn't finish dining until after 4 when we had arrived at 1pm. Thankfully we weren't in a rush but this seemed extreme. The lack of attention from our original server who eventually left for the day in the middle of our meal was replaced with someone friendly and more attentive. This experience was disappointing especially considering with food and drink this meal for 2 was close to $300. The food itself is to die for (except the bland sorbet). If it wasn't for the lackluster service this review would be 5 stars.",0,0,0,Melanie M.,"Sunnyside, Queens, NY",91,157,125

Decor was really cool... and the restaurant had a very airy feel due to the high ceilings. Food excellent and generous portions -miso cod was possibly the best cod that I've had. The miso complimented the fish really well. And the sauce was delicious. -ordered the cote de beouff burger, which was a special ($4 upcharge).

2.0,1/2/2019,"Overall, I rated this experience a 2 due to poor service from our waiter combined with food that was good, but not great. For a Michelin rated and highly renowned restaurant, I expected much more from this establishment. I was shocked by how aloof our waiter was the entire evening. He was disinterested from the onset, seemingly insincere throughout the evening and, at times, borderline rude. On our way out of the restaurant, I discretely flagged down a manager to provide feedback and specific examples. The tuna appetizer and the Gotham chocolate cake were both very good, the entrees (duck & surf and turf) were less desirable.

1.0,12/25/2018,"I made a reservation celebrating my mother's birthday with the rest of the family. I've been to Gotham before for an anniversary dinner and had an amazing time. However, my second visit did not live up to my previous high expectations. The food was good, but the service was lacking. From the very beginning, we were not made to feel very welcome. Despite having an early reservation at 5:30pm, the hostess spent a longer time than necessary checking us in and finding us a table. It looked like they were trying to find another table for us (maybe our appearance wasn't up to their ""high"" standards). Our party of 5 was finally brought over to a square table meant to be seated for 8. What kind of restaurant seats an odd-numbered party at a square table? I saw other round tables with 5 seats, why couldn't we sit there? Was it because they were at the front of the restaurant? It went downhill from there. The waiter (Edward S) was incredibly rude and gave short responses when my dear mother asked questions about the items. Luckily, she was oblivious to the poor treatment we were receiving. However, unlike her, I've been to many top restaurants - Le Bernardin, Jean-Georges, The Modern, Marea, etc. - and recognized how disrespectfully we were being treated. I didn't say anything in order to not ruin the evening. Overall, food quality does not compensate for poor service and mediocre dining experience. The rudeness and discrimination of the staff has now left a sour taste in my mouth.

5.0,12/22/2018,"The BEST restaurant I have ever been to! Unbelievably good all around. I wanted to find something wrong with this restaurant, but I just couldn't. Everything was simply amazing and it was hands down the best dining experience I have ever had. From the food, to the service, to the ambiance. It was impeccable, 5 stars!!!!!Upon arriving to the restaurant, I was quickly seated. I made a reservation the day before and the process was easy and painless. After being seated, the waiter introduced himself and explained the menu. I decided to go with the a la carte menu for dinner: deviled eggs - ""For the Table"", rack of lamb and surf and turf - entrees, and apple crisp/tart (item was special and not on their menu) - dessert. Once my order was taken by the waiter, a gentleman (I would like to think of him as the ""Bread Man"") gave us some free bread and fixed our table setting based on our meal. He was on top of his game from beginning to end. Bread was on table quickly, our plates were quickly taken after we finished each course... and then more bread was on the table. I loved the Bread Man!Now onto the food. The deviled eggs were an explosion of flavor in my mouth. The surf and turf was freakin melt in your mouth. The rack of lamb was punch you in the face good. And, the apple crisp was simply amazing. Delicious food. Needless to say, this dining experience was far above anything I've ever experienced.

It's described as chilled but no worries the salad was not refrigerated cold. It came with plenty of mixed seafood but it could use more lobster. Everything was so tender. The vinaigrette was subtle. I wanted to order seconds and I'm still dreaming about it. - Lobster and short rib surf & turf (5/5): AMAZING! The meats were buttery melt in your mouth delicious. I started thinking what have I been eating all my life before this?? The ""foam"" on the lobster was impressive with great flavor. Everything was perfect.  - Tagiatelle (4/5): Waiter had warned us that pasta portions were small and that we could pay more for a large but we didn't. I thought the portion was good. The pasta was al dente with a strong mushroom flavor. The goat cheese wasn't seen but really compliments everything. - Electric avenue cocktail (5/5): This is one of those very few moments where I felt the cocktail was actually worth $18 price tag. It was tastefully crafted. - Gotham chocolate cake (3/5): A popular choice but I wasn't a fan. The texture of the cake was super airy almost chalky but it tasted rich and heavy. The salty ice cream on the side was unmemorable.  Overall I had a wonderful meal. Our waiter was nice but the service needs improvement.

5.0,11/25/2018,"Had a very nice time here last night. Christmas decorations are up! It's a beautiful restaurant, but I personally think it could use a little more flair like nice music playing loud enough so you can hear it and I noticed that the bathrooms were very lackluster. I guess I just expected more extravagance. Some things just need a little updating, but I guess this is one of those classic take it or leave it restaurants. When we arrived around 8:30, the line for coat check was very long and the restaurant wasn't even completely full - they definitely could have used another person. I got the hibiscus mule - very good a little ""spicy"" from the ginger. Not very sweet, which is how I prefer my drinks. Beet salad - it was good, small (3 cubes of beets topped with garnishes), so definitely not meant to share. Kale salad you get more if you're looking to share. Chicken - delicious crispy skin and must be slow cooked because the meat is very soft. They serve a piece of both dark and white meat. What I didn't like about the dish was how buttery the vegetables were or how much vinegar the cabbage had in it, and I'm a vinegar lover!Dessert - we got the apple pie, which was full of buttery deliciousness! Each person gets his or her own mini scoop of vanilla ice cream with it.

According to the guide, one Michelin star is primarily on food so I tempered my expectations on service. Service was still above average, but it was not impeccable as there was a 5 min interval where they failed to refill our water cups. Besides that, service was spot on and we were checked up at decent intervals to ensure we are having the optimal experience.I got the dry aged steak, which was the first time trying it, but it was worth. A minor criticism is that there are some areas that seem to be burnt, as it was bitter. Other than that, it was solid.

The crowd scales a little older- and we were there on a Wednesday night- so I am assuming that many were there for a business dinner.  Our waiter introduced himself and asked us what we would like to drink. I started with a Cabernet Sauvignon, Truchard as I knew I wanted a red meat dish. The wine by the glass was limited and averaged about $12-$16 per for a generous pour. My hubby started with a clever 12th STREET SAZERAC cocktail- Rittenhouse whiskey, remy martin 1738 cognac, absinthe, demerara & peychaud's bitters. It was delicious. Then bread was brought to the table with Butter. I am capitalizing the B in Butter because it was so perfectly creamy and salty. Honestly, if you can judge a meal by the butter .........perfection.I ordered the Rack of Lamb which was perfectly cooked- medium rare- with swiss chard, roasted cipollini onions and mashed potato puree. A lamb reduction added a dense richness to the dish. I almost licked the plate clean. Hubby ordered the Surf and Turf. His dish included a Maine lobster tail, braised short rib & same potato puree. I had a bite of the short rib and it was smokey and meaty and really divine. The presentation was stunning. I saved room for dessert and ordered the Gotham Chocolate Cake served warm with salted almond ice cream on top. It was like a beautiful chocolate cloud in my mouth. Worth every calorie. Service was attentive and playful. Our waiter gave us just the right amount of attention and allowed us to enjoy the evening on our time. No rushing. We noticed that many people hanging at the bar were picking up dinners to take home. Lucky them! We have enjoyed fine dining in many restaurants across the US and this may be one of our favorite places. We absolutely will be back the next time we come to NYC. Truly a delicious and memorable dining experience.",1,0,0,Maureen F.,"Wilmington, NC",203,158,219

We had a reservation for 7:30 but arrived early. We waited by the bar until our table was ready. I order a rose wine for starter which was ok. I'm very picky when it comes to wine. One thing that I enjoyed was they allow us to taste the wine before filling it to the top. Our table was finally ready and they took the wine for us to our table. I enjoyed how attentive the server was to us and helpful when I needed a suggestion.  There was a guy going around passing bread which was delicious by the way. For appetizers I ordered a butter nut which was amazing. For the main course I ordered their famous steak which by far the most AMAZING steak I ever had. It was crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside. Very well season and a good size. For desert We ordered a chocolate cake which was on the house.

I came in for dinner recently, bringing a couple of out-of-town friends. You just want a place to be on-point when you do that. But did you know that they have a really bad seating section in the back where you're shoved in with a bunch of other tables? They do have a seating section like that, and that is where they put us.  I'm sorry, but a place that charges exorbitantly for their food shouldn't have tables like that. Every corner should feel inviting in some way.Also, the food wasn't that great, the wine was so-so, and the steak was burned on the outside (weird).  I just expect so much more and have gotten it in the past.  All in all, it left a bad taste in all of our mouths and we ended up at the Knickerbocker right after where we ended up essentially eating a second dinner and drinking better drinks, eating better food, and receiving better, warmer service.

Diced fruits and vegetables were properly uniform. It nicely cleansed the palate. The fish was buttery smooth and fresh. This was an excellent dish. The pesto pasta was just not that great. It tasted very strongly of pine nuts and overpowering herbaceousness. The pasta didn't taste particularly fresh and was too al dente to absorb the flavors of the pesto sauce properly. The kale greens in the dish only exacerbated the overt grassiness of this dish. The best way I could describe this miss is that it was too ""grassy."" There were too many robust and leafy ingredients competing for mouthfeel. There wasn't a balanced flavor profile (too bitter).The cake was excellent. The crumb looked like a regular cake.

5.0,9/1/2018,"Went here for restaurant week. I have been wanting to come here for a while now but usually they only have restaurant week specials for lunch so a bit hard to get in unless you're in the neighborhood. It was such a pleasant experience from the very beginning. We were invited in with a warm welcome. We were even welcomed to the neighborhood which was so sweet. Food:Wild striped bass crudo for appetizer; it included strips of bass, pineapple, cucumber, radishes, red onion passion fruit granada, with a chili citrus emulsion. This was very light and refreshing. The slight kick of chili and citrus really brought the mild tones of bass up a notch. The pineapple balanced it out with some sweet tones. Pan roasted branzino for entree; roasted fennel, peppers, baby leek, fingerling potatoes, white port lime emulsion. The branzino was done very well. The crispiness of the top skin was a pleasant addition to the symphony of flavors. Gotham chocolate cake for dessert; it came with salted almond ice cream. This dish was not so mindblowing but a solid dish nevertheless. Ambiance: Light and spacious. Beautiful cloth draped light  fixtures adorning the restaurant. It is elegant with some old time charm. Service: Very good. We were seated very quickly and served timely. Water was timely refilled. Everyone was very pleasant. Overall I would come back.

I can frankly say, Gotham was the better out of the two.The food was amazing. Everything was very well presented. The food was up to par with the formal ambience the restaurant had- make sure you don't walk in with jeans and t-shirt. The thing about restaurant week is that sometimes I feel like I'm not really getting a ""better"" deal than ordering from the regular menu. Gotham made me feel otherwise. I was so satisfied and get like I had gotten a bang for the buck. It was very well seasoned and everything on the menu was delicious.The half-star is off because of the waitress/ service.

All in all, really enjoyed everything about my experience other than the wait for the entree & the check. The restaurant is pretty spacious and I loved the classic decor. We were seated right away (despite arriving late for our reservation). I started off with the wild striped bass crudo as an appetizer and ordered the roasted chicken for my entree. The bass was delicious--I could have sworn there were small cubes of mango (which I am allergic to and was not listed in the menu description), but I ate it anyway and didn't break out in hives sooo all good. The entree did take a while to arrive, so while waiting, I went to the restroom, and coming back, they had put a steel dome plate cover over the dish to keep it warm--which I really appreciated. The dish was beautiful (see photo) and the chicken was cooked perfectly. If we had had time, we would have loved to try dessert as well. After our meal, it took three tries to get our server to bring the check (I assume he kept getting distracted because the restaurant was pretty full by the time we finished).

We also shared the chocolate cake which was very moist and indulgent. Some high quality stuff and a great deal at lunch!Only thing I was bummed about was the service.

4.0,8/7/2018,"Enjoyed a great lunch at Gotham Bar and Grill today. Nice ambiance, great food, great prefix price, and wonderful servers, they were so sweet~Personally, I didn't care much for any of the first courses, either the gazpacho or the Wild Striped Bass Crudo, and would probably never order them again outside of Restaurant Week. My sister liked them well enough, so I guess its just a matter of personal taste.The second courses were when I fell in love. I demolished the Pan Roasted Branzino in like minutes, it was both tender, flaky and juicy on the inside, buttery and crispy on the outside, and had a great sauce. Whatever vegetables were underneath it, those were delicious too. Overall a fantastic dish. The Soft Shelled Crabs were also amazing and had a great crunch and texture. Really savory. I wish they offered a spicy version, that would be truly decadent. Also for whatever reason, I almost started to hum Under the Sea as I was eating the crabs. This dish really brings the ocean to mind haha.Finished off the meal with the Gotham Chocolate Cake and the Yogurt Parfait. The cake was more like a dense mousse. It was very thick and rich and pretty delicious. I've honestly had better, but this was still very delicious. Yogurt Parfait was tangy and refreshing, perfect for today, as it was hot and steamy.The complimentary bread they gave out during lunch was all sorts of nasty, didn't touch it again after the first bite.

We gave him a timeline and we were then seated.We ordered a bottle of Pinot grigio and water for the table. We were served bread first. For appetizers we had the mexican cocktail shrimp. These were served with a cocktail sauce that had the perfect kick of spice to it. Another sauce served was a creamy Sriracha sauce. My personal preference was the cocktail sauce that paired so nicely with the giant cocktail shrimp but the creamy sauce was nice too. The second course was the seafood salad which was served chilled with a lime dressing that was incredibly delicious! The salad had shrimp, squid, octopus, lobster and some micro greens. Very tasty and highly recommend this!For the meal, we ordered the black cod which comes with bok choy, sticky rice and mushrooms. I swapped out the bok choy for squash and the server raved about the sauce. The entree was amazing! The cod was cooked to perfection. The filet had a good crust with a soft, melt in your mouth texture that was incredible! The soy based sauce was tangy and paired really well with the rice. The mushrooms were also very good. Also ordered the 28 day aged steak which came with onion rings and baby carrots. The steak was cooked to order and very good. The onion rings were crispy and served with a sauce.

2.0,7/12/2018,"I had eaten here years ago and had a very favorable experience. The food was excellent, as was the amazing service. However, went I went again with a friend for a special birthday last night I was very disappointed. To begin with, we waited 45 minutes for our appetizers to arrive. Upon their arrival, my friend was very pleased with her buratta, rhubarb and frieze salad, but my $22 seafood salad was INCREDIBLY meager and totally tasteless. When our entrees arrived we were both struck by the meager portion again. Paying over $42 (or was it $44?) for cod and for halibut, and then each getting a piece of fish barely 2 inches in length is totally obscene. We were both so unsatisfied we felt the need to fill up on bread. Perhaps that's why they come around and offer it to you so many times during the course of your meal! Really, just another over hyped restaurant in NYC that goes by the rule that the more you pay the smaller the ""chic"" portion is. Oh, and then there was the delicious, but tiny $15 desert we shared that we each got to take about 2 bites of each. What else would be nice is, if at a restaurant where you easily pay over $260 with tip for a dinner for 2 people (just one glass of wine each plus coffee) there was at least a minimal dress code. Is it really necessary for men to go out for a dinner at a ""fine restaurant"" in a T shirt (with writing on it no less) and jeans? It really takes away from the ambiance, IMHO.

4.0,6/15/2018,"3.5 starsA classy restaurant that is often classified as a ""NY Institution."" The high ceilings and chandeliers make for a beautiful oldworld feel, and has an older clientele to match. Service was mostly friendly but at times uncomfortable as our waiter peered at us over his spectacles. Had I asked one too many questions? Efficient and quick in the beginning of the meal, he was nowhere to be found by the end of it. I liked the appetizers better than the entrees. The Tuna Tartare (5/5) that they are known for is excellent, not very exciting but the flavor is great and the presentation is beautiful. The standout was the spring vegetable risotto (5/5), perfectly creamy but brightened up by the bursts of peas, asparagus, and salty bits of pancetta. The baby kale salad was perfect and necessary as a lighter option, ultra tender greens seasoned perfectly. Who can resist those fancy marcona almonds?For mains, the Miso Marinated Black Cod (3.5/5) seems quite popular but I found it to be fishy. The sticky rice was too sticky, almost mushy, and the sauce was a tad too acidic. Overall disappointed. I was confused when the Dry Aged New York Steak (3.5/5) arrived - did we accidentally order a tenderloin? It was fine, but didn't have extra beefiness I expect from dry-aging, and could've used more vigorous seasoning. For dessert, go with the Gotham chocolate cake (4.5/5), with a texture closer to a cakey brownie. I wasn't a fan of the cherry souffle (3/5) sadly, which didn't taste discernibly like cherry and the flavor was too saturated and unenjoyable, I couldn't really enjoy more than a bite. All in all, it felt like it needed updating and perfecting. I appreciate the classics, butwhen there are so many options, there were too many things that ""could have been better.""

2.0,5/22/2018,"Dated and tired in nearly all respects. We returned for a nostalgic visit, having not been in many years, sadly only to find Gotham whimpering along. It just seems to be mostly going through the motions at this point - devoid of vigor and intensity. Menu, while conceptually good, is not executed at the right level. Decor has not been refreshed ever? Service was neither very warm nor sharp. Rather surprised it has maintained a Michelin star, as Gotham is no longer competitive at this level versus others in the city. What a shame, as it held such a good memory for us.Atmosphere- Desperately needs a refresh; decor and fixtures are well past their prime. - Suggest later reservation times, when it becomes more lively.- Clientele is very skewed toward older demographics, rather than being a diverse mix.FoodAlthough sounding good in concept, with well selected flavor profiles, the execution was lacking. We were disappointed at this price point. Nothing tasted bad per se, it just didn't seem to be prepared with any sort of passion or care really. Good job on pasty though.On this visit we had:- Spring Vegetable Risotto (asparagus, english peas, spring onion, pancetta, parmesan- $29): Lacked creaminess or that nice al dente bite, treatment of pre-prepared rice was poor. Flavors nice. Seemed almost cold when arrived.- Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras (mandarin orange, fennel, rhubarb, sicilian pistachio - $35): A bright spot, good caramelization and quite enjoyed the flavor pairings, the pistachio in particular.- Long Island Duck Breast (quinoa, candy cane beets, pistachio, orange confit - $48): Sad - it was not succulent and juicy with proper fat rendering. Doused in heavy sauce, but even that couldn't cover up the flaws. This beautiful protein just got lost.- Miso Marinated Black Cod (bok choy, shiitake mushrooms and sticky rice, soy lemongrass ginger sauce - $48): Decent, fish was cooked well and flavors were good. Fine, if unremarkable. Would have been better with a creamier broth.- Vanilla Cheesecake (strawberries, green matcha meringue, rhubarb sorbet - $15): Quite nice and well presented. Wish it was a touch larger! WineThe wine list at Gotham contains a number of high quality and interesting options. Nice collection of gems, but feel the list has gaps in sub-$200 red offerings. It would also be nice to see some more domestic options in reds. Overall, just could use more balance. We selected the 2015 Domaine du Comte Liger-Belair ""La Colombière"" Burgundy ($225), which was an excellent selection and a great find. Service- Good interaction with the somm (Artem) who was nice, approachable, and helpful.- Our waitress was going through the motions. Nothing was left unattended, there was just no real hospitality or warmth.- Maitre d' / hostess were both pleasant.",1,0,1,D. L. J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,115,647

3.0,5/18/2018,Meh... Service was choppy and just so so. Very loud and I felt sort of trapped in a chaotic-atmosphere.  The waiter was hurried and pushing bread but the somalis didn't come until requested. Food was very beautiful every dish- the posted pics don't lie- designed with care. We had duck and lamb chops. The crust on the lamb was great but not a lot of flavor after that. The duck was excellent with a almost burnt sear and very tender. I liked the meal but  not enough to really give a rave review.,1,0,3,Danielle K.,"Garden City, NY",1,62,119
5.0,5/14/2018,"It has been over a decade since i last visited Gotham, located in the village.For this particular occasion, i visited with my husband and a friend for dinner. I waited at the bar and enjoyed a delightful cocktail (the Vesper) while i want for the other two to arrive. The drink was perfectly made.The meal was fantastic. We ordered several appetizers and main courses to share. The service was formal but not too fuzzy, tuned to deliver a fine-dining experience. Stand out dishes include the terrine of foie and chicken, the seared foie, the smoked duck salad, the lovely dry aged New York steak, and the rack of lamb: an array of fine dining classics done impeccably. For dessert, the cherry souffle stands out as well as the chocolate cake that is to die for.The meal was not cheap (but then that should be pretty obvious), but the portions are all generous and the service was fantastic.

2.0,5/10/2018,"A bad experience at what had been my favorite restaurant in NYC. Of course, I took an out-of-town guest there for dinner, raving all the way about my love of this restaurant. Everything that happened that evening was an anomaly and unexpected based on my past meals. The hostess refused to seat us until we were all present (the restaurant was empty), there were no seats at the bar so we had to stand. When the third guest arrived we asked to be seated and were promptly ignored by the waitress for over 15 minutes. We asked for the sommelier who arrived after the appetizers, couldn't find one of the two bottles we wanted and looked annoyed when we said that the proper wine didn't arrive with the proper food. The waitress ignored us for the rest of the meal, leaving us without requested water and bread. As always, the food was well prepared and we were offered complimentary desserts, but it was too late. I'll go back soon and if my experience is better, I'll revise this review.",0,0,0,Lou Sal G.,"New York, NY",0,7,0
2.0,5/1/2018,"The food was beyond underwhelming. Probably the worst ""Michelin"" star restaurant I've eaten at. No, the worst upper scale restaurant I've eaten at. The only reason they have two stars is due to the impeccable service. Our waiter was amazing-Accommodating to my vegetarian tastes (so he informed me about chicken stock and bone gelatin used in the dessert) Went here for my 8 year anniversary with my partner, no additional steps were undertaken to make our day special. Our apps were the sashimi and the soup. The sashimi was akin to an ethnic restaurant attempting to serve up some high class dish, whilst utterly failing to get a quality product. The best part was the black sesame and the fennel. The citrus ""sauce"" was so sour that I wasn't sure if it was ill conceived or spoiled. The pea soup- looked beautiful - but was hot and had that poorly conceived flavour. It tasted home-made in a bad way, also soups like that should  be served chilled. The mains were goat cheese ravioli and the bronzino. The ravioli had a killer flavour, the goat cheese was top notch. I loved the way the pasta was cooked, but again the presentation killed me. Am I in a Hungarian rustic restaurant or am I paying a premium for your dishes? Based on the bill should be the latter, but why give me a bottom end presentation? The bronzino was cooked well, but this sweet and sour style sauce that was again too sour and not well merged with the dish. Also why is fennel mixed with citrusy olives? Let that fennel breathe- it was the best part of the dish. The dessert -a favorite course- was highly unremarkable. A trio of sorbets (I wanted the parfait, but it being non vegetarian was not an option) the raspberry was beyond sour, but pear was beyond tasty, the apricot was interesting. The chocolate cake was good, but generic French bakery good - not Michelin star worthy good. Left with too big of a dent in our wallet for too little satisfaction and beyond hungry. Really thought this place was going to be fantastic, very scorned that the food was so underwhelming.",0,1,0,Queen R.,"Brooklyn, NY",160,603,20

5.0,4/15/2018,"My favorite upscale restaurant in NYC. I've been here a few times for dinner for birthdays and anniversaries. Both the service and food have always been top notch. It's upscale without being pretentious and overly expensive, especially compared to some other NYC restaurants I've been to. Although they have a dress code, they're not that strict about it. I think some items on the menu change seasonally, but everything I've ordered has consistently been really good. This is the sort of place you bring your parents when they are visiting, or for special occasions. One dish that has stood out for me has been the tuna tartare.

5.0,4/14/2018,"What a lovely experience! Came here to celebrate an anniversary and enjoyed every element of the evening, from the ambience, service, food, and decor. It's not hard to see why this establishment is so highly touted -- the food was delicious and you feel completely pampered the whole time and it's not prohibitively expensive. The two of us ordered and shared the tuna tartar appetizer ($26), the miso cod ($48), the pork chop ($44) and finished the meal off with the chocolate cake ($15).I don't go to fancy restaurants much, but when I do, I always get the tartar appetizer when it's offered. Get it here! It was the perfect amount of savory and sour blended together in a sea of richness. My only regret is that each of us only got two tiny crostini! Very, very good.The miso cod plates were probably the best bites of the night. Served with sticky rice, mushrooms, and bok choy in a salty miso broth, the fish literally melts in your mouth. It was completely ridiculous. Nothing should taste that good -- it's just not fair to other foods. The mushroom and vegetables were of course also tasty, but the fish and rice were the stars of the dish.By the time the pork chops rolled around we were both completely stuffed but we soldiered on due to our admirable determination. Okay, we only had a couple bites before we packed the dishes to go, but they were probably the softest and most perfectly cooked pork chops I had ever eaten. Still, nothing comes close to the cod!We wrapped the evening up with the restaurant's namesake chocolate cake. True to our waiter's description, the flourless cake really did taste more like mousse than a traditional cake. It was thick and rich -- almost too much so, if that's possible -- and came with a small dollop of salted almond ice cream (I believe?) that helped to cut the sweetness. In addition, you also get a few baked treats that taste exactly like Madeleine cookies! The dinner was as close to perfection as one meal can be, and a special shout-out must be given to our waiters John and Pedro. It's always a pleasure to have knowledgeable and professional wait staff, so a big thank you to them both. Another thanks is in order because all of our dishes, while shared, were plated individually. Restaurants typically bring the entree along with a sharing plate or bowl, but Gotham did the splitting for us (and each plate was a 10/10 on the aesthetic scale)!

4.0,4/5/2018,"4 stars for food and ambiance (very upscale looking and no pretentiousness).  However, the service was standard (hence I can't give them 5 stars), nothing memorable.  I do not recall them adding ""more"" to the whole dining experience.  My party size of 9 - as we were here for our Office Holiday Lunch, were serviced at the minimum.  I know we saw our server once when we sat down with our menu's, another time for our Champagne toast, and then to order.  We didn't see her again until it was time for dessert.  In between, we were assisted by other table staff (for clearing plates and water refills).  Any how, they do get the 4 stars as we all enjoyed our food from start to finish.  Sadly, I have no photos of the food (could not Yelp pics, no cell phone policy at the table because it was an office event).  Was so bummed because the presentation of a few dishes were drool-worthy.Skipping to the good stuff - why you should try this place - besides it being well priced for the quality, the variety makes it pleasing to all tastes.  Must try appetizers:  the Muscovy Duck and Foie Gras Terrine (which I had as my first plate), the Chicory Salad (think squash, apples, parmesan and candied walnuts), and the Yellowfin Tar Tar (presentation is quite different from others, you'll be pleasantly surprised).  I wish I could suggest more but it seems great minds think alike as half my crew ordered the same plates!Must try entrees:  I thoroughly enjoyed the Pan Roasted Branzino.  Reading my other reviews, I am a carnivore at heart but when I can, I try to order fish.  Many make it mediocre and a few earn ravs.  This is one of those that I liked - a lot!  The branzino was hearty and perfectly roasted.  The top was slightly crispy and the flesh was soft and flaky - just as Branzino should be.  Normally a summer favorite given it's light texture, but I personally just love this fish all year round.  The best part was the blood orange emulsion.  The other stand-out entrees from what I sampled, the Miso Marinated Black Cod (served with sticky rice and bok choy - perfectly balanced flavors), and the Braised Beef Short Ribs, the red wine reduction and potato puree made it all complete.  Note: they have a great ""prix fixe"" lunch - totally worth the price and a great way to give this place a try before committing to the full lunch or dinner menu.  Plus, it's like dining in a fancy place for like half the price.  I would totally come back here again - even if it's just to Yelp the food.  Gorgeous plating on some and very creative I might add.  They score high just for that.  The portions were good to generous too.  Another reason to eat here again.",4,2,2,Jeannie T.,"Queens, NY",372,532,7611

We immediately asked to move to the next table over, as my wife was sitting on a seam in the banquette, and we were accommodated.  Our waiter greeted us and handed us menus for food and beverage. We then waited for over 20 minutes to have our drink orders taken. Once we placed our orders it was again a long wait before our drinks arrived. As we had our cocktails (excellent!) we noted that tables around us were receiving rolls and butter.  We did not see our waiter so asked a server for rolls. When nothing came we finally found our waiter and asked for rolls again and she said they would be arriving shortly. Again, a long wait for the person to bring us rolls.Our waiter later returned and took our dinner order. It was indeed excellent food and we had no concerns about what we were eating and enjoyed it thoroughly. During the meal we were never asked if we would like another cocktail or wine, and had to, once again, flag down our waiter to place a wine order.During this entire meal we felt that we were ""working very hard"" to get the service that we expected and desired.

For our first course we got the tuna tartare and shrimp cocktail - our waiter was kind enough to split up each order into 2 so that my dad and I could enjoy a little bit of everything - super appreciated! Got the seafood soup and seafood salad as our second course which was also both delicious - if you do not like creamy soups, I wouldn't recommend. Seafood salad did not skimp on the octopus, scallops, etc... Got the halibut which was a bit dry - wouldn't get again but that might just be the texture of the fish. Dad got the miso black cod which was DELICIOUS - we were so full by this point but we finished the entire thing! Topped everything off with the three flavor sorbet (apricot, raspberry, pear) which helped ease off the savory goodness we enjoyed. Waitor surprised us with these tasty little pastries for my dad's birthday and topped off our sorbet with a white chocolate piece that read ""happy birthday"".Not going to lie, this place costs a pretty penny... or two!

Nothing to complain about.The seafood salad had lots of octopus, shrimp, scallop, and crab with a bit of greens. There was more octopus compared to any of the other seafood. I wish they had a better balanced salad. The New York steak 28 day aged was grilled on the outside and juicy on the inside. I really enjoyed this steak and felt like it was the first time I had a proper New York steak, which makes sense since I'm in NY. Not even sure how large it was, but must have been at least 12 ounces. Mixing in the dijon mustard custard with each bite of NY steak was very appetizing and made the taste of steak refreshing with every bite. Onion rings were good although could have been slightly crispier since it was a bit soft when we had it.Tried my friends foie gras and it was so rich and appetizing.

The cake was so damn good, it made up for the rest of the meal. Damn. Not overselling the cake one bit, I promise.  Appetizers: The sunchoke soup was delicious, but not incredible, the pears were an interesting touch. The red snapper, which our waiter had told us had little flavor, also left little impression. The dish was light and refreshing, the fish quality was great, but it also tasted like nothing. (the bread was warm, delish and kept coming)Mains: The branzino was cooked perfectly, the skin amazing. I really liked the potato puree, the brussels sprouts and sauce was tasted mildly of Hawaiian punch did nothing for me. The chicken was dry. It was edibly dry, but dry nonetheless. I think I expected..... more out of a Michelin star restaurant.Dessert: The flourless chocolate cake was not fucking around. It was like the perfect chocolate cake, the perfect fudge, and the perfect mousse came together and birthed the perfect cake. It was perfect. The salted almond ice cream on the side was damn nice too.Service: We had a reservation but the waiting area was filled with people, packed like sardines because they were running behind...

Should have cost around $16.  The pumpkin ravioli were also $28. They were delicious but not sure they were worth $5.60 each. The tuna tartare is $26 but is definitely worth it because it is fresh and delicious and always pricey regardless of where it's purchased. The vegetable plate at $32 is NOT worth it. It was the smallest vegetable plate I had ever ordered for that price. Tasted mediocre and totally overpriced. The miso glazed cod at $48 was excellent--this was one of the best fish entrees I've had. Service was not the best--wasn't focused, didn't come back to check how we were doing.  Tried to use a dining reward that was earned through OpenTable and the young manager rudely came to our table and told us we couldn't, even when OpenTable had us reserve a table here just to use the dining reward.  Even though the food was mostly good, I would not return because of the rude management and the value just isn't there.

4.0,2/4/2018,"Gotham Bar and Grill is a swanky new American styled restaurant that serves generous portions. It has a 1 Michelin star, so the prices and service reflect that.

Would definitely come back, especially for a more casual quality meal.The venue looks upscale and well decorated. It can be bustling inside, but you can still have a conversation. I would imagine you would probably want a reservation to get seated here due to the busyness. People dressed pretty casually here, I would say most guys dressed with a button down and dark pants.There isn't a preset menu, one can order any number of dishes; bread is included.I ordered:Yellow tail tartare - basic dish, pretty much what you expectHudson foie gras - HUGE piece, very well prepared, ofc melts in your mouth, comes with figs/jam to cut through the fattiness.

4.0,1/25/2018,"So, I went here today to celebrate my brother's birthday.  We decided to do the Winter 2018 RW prix fixe lunch menu. Ambiance:The decor is elegant enough with white linen tablecloths and napkins and a coat check immediately upon entering.  This restaurant is across from NYU and Cardoza Law, so there were a plethora of professors that seemed to be enjoying the lunch fare (as I was able to overhear several conversations while waiting about 15 min to be seated.  I reserved a table.).  The crowd was a bit on the older side, and less ""well-dressed"" than the dinner crowd.  The attire was business casual.Wait service:Once we were seated, we were immediately given a roll, silverware, and asked if we were interested in cocktails.  We decline, as it was the lunch hour and we had to drive.  Our server also wished my brother ""Happy Birthday"", which surprised me.  But then I realized that while trying to book the reservation, the receptionist asked me if I could do another day, and I mentioned I wanted this day because my brother's birthday was today.  So, I was impressed. Additionally, our water glasses were constantly refilled, and I felt that we were being attended to in a way that was enough not to be overly intrusive.Food:-Roasted Sunchoke soup with roasted bosc pearThis was a hot soup, extremely creamy and smooth, but not clawingly rich.  It had several small squares of poached pear that added a delightful sweetness to the soup.  Both my brother and  loved it.  We both thought this was the best appetizer. Portion size was not bad either.-Red Snapper Sashimi with sesame ginger, guajilllo pepper, lime, gingerThe snapper was delicately sliced and dressed with frisee.  By itself, the fish was tasteless. Although mild, snapper does have a flavor.  The ginger was so non-existent as a flavor profile, I wasn't sure it was even added to the dish.  The heat in the guajillo pepper was of the mild variety, but was present in the dish, and was quite nice to be honest.  Sadly, the presentation and the dressed greens were the best things about this dish.-Pan-roasted Branzino with fingerling potatoes, fennel, black olives, brussel sprouts.The Branzino- perfectly cooked so that the skin was crispy, while the fleshy side was deliciously moist and flaky.  There was a blood orange emulsion that was tart yet sweet and was a welcomed accompaniment.  I asked for my fennel to be taken out, which they accommodated.  However, my dish had no black olives, and the potatoes were under-seasoned.  But, when eaten together, it wasn't bad.  Though, you can't go wrong with the Branzino, it was excellent!  This was my brother's favorite entree.-Braised beef Short ribs with brussel sprouts, thumbelina carrots, cipollini, potato puree, red wine reduction.This was my favorite, and the meat was melt in your mouth tender and perfectly seasoned.  The reduction was delicious and the puree wasn't overly assertive, but smooth and light against the richness of the ribs. Cipollini was nicely roasted, though the outside skin that is usually removed through blanching somehow remained. This also costs an additional $12 above the prix fixe menu.Dessert: (KUDOS TO THE PATISSIER!!!)-Gotham Chocolate cake with salted almond ice creamDELICIOUS, especially if you love dark chocolate.  I was expecting a spongier cake from the appearance, but it was a cross between a chocolate cheesecake and a chocolate souffle texture.  The ice cream and crunchy crumbles just elevated this dish to star quality.-Lemon Parfait with matcha , mandarin sorbetMy brother loved this so much that he ordered a second one of these ( for an additional $15).  This was not the American type of parfait, but the frozen kind that the French serve up.  It's similar to a semifreddo.  That being said, it was lemon flavored and nestled atop what looked to be   Chantilly creme.  The sorbet was mandarin, and tasted like I was eating the fruit right off the tree. It did not have the muted taste that usually accompanies fruit once it has been mixed with water. Oh, and they put a candle on it, and wrote out happy birthday in chocolate on the plate.Summary:  Gotham is elegant, our wait staff exceptional, the desserts were amazing as were the sauces to all the dishes.  A RW menu might not have given me the scope of this restaurant, but I was not overwhelmed as I have been in other Michelin rated restaurants.  The plating is not large, but pretty enough.  The menu is sort of on the safe side, even for the regular lunch menu.  The food was good, well presented, but nothing that will blow your mind.  However, how can you beat $30 and $42 for a 3 course meal at an elegant restaurant. With the extra dessert our meal came up to about $93.",1,0,0,Kia T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,8

There was a bit of amateurish familiarity that bled through.  All our meals were very good, but nothing was memorable, let only spectacular.  Gotham's kitchen was very middle of the road and miss hit on their innovative risks. On my Dover Sole entree, a dish almost demanding classism, the Gotham Bar & Grill served some bistronomic dish that deconstructed Dover Sole.  It was weird at best, and nothing I expected.  The meal made me yearn for the Gotham Bar and Grill of past years.

While I would have loved to try multiple courses, my date and I were on a time crunch, so we shared a first course and each had a main. The Hudson Valley foie gras was seared and presented beautifully, but the flavors were lacking. It tasted far too fatty, almost like gristle, compared to other identical dishes at similar restaurants. We always order this dish when we're out. I give it a D+. For my main, I had the salmon, and loved the attempt at mixing flavors. The sauce was phenomenal, and temperature of the meat just perfect. Presentation needed some work, but the flavors were there. I'm not quite sure how to express why, but despite the above, I wasn't wowed by the dish.

My favorite of the night was the yellow fin tuna tar tar. The tuna was fresh and had a great balance of freshness and hint of spice. For my main course I ordered the lamb.

The chicken was like butter, meltingly tender and hightened by the rich, tangy sauce.

5.0,12/18/2017,"It always confused me how a French tire company found its way to becoming the definitive metric for rating restaurants. I leave the star ratings to the experts, but I think Gotham Bar and Grill seriously deserves a re-eval to raise its one star to two. The interior is what you'd expect of a fine dining restaurant that's been around for a few decades - grand accents of deep mahogany, delicate drapery hanging from the ceilings, cream-colored walls to soften the atmosphere, and of course festive lights twinkling for the days leading up to Christmas. That brings me to our festive waiter, but something told me that the upcoming holidays had nothing to do with his cheeriness. This guy was definitely cheery ALL the time. The entire night, he was accommodating, knowledgeable, patient, hospitable, refreshingly funny (not in that trying-too-hard overbearing way), and overall good person. His name is Garin, and you're in luck if he takes care of you for dinner. His enthusiasm for the food was palpable as he eloquently rattled off details about the specials and the classics.Of the four staple dishes that's been around for 30 years, we selected the miso-marinated black cod and the seafood salad. Read on for our other selections - literally did not have a single complaint about any of them. Seafood salad: basically all my seafood faves, including lobster, octopus, scallops - elevated by a simple lemon vinaigrette. A salad disappoints when there's too much green and not enough of the other not so green ingredients. But this is a whole lotta the delicious not so green elements. Yellowfin tuna tartare: there was just so much going on here - fresh raw fish, arranged in a cylindrical tower that was decorated with pieces of thin pieces of toasted bread. Surrounding the yellowfin were thinly sliced cucumbers, which gave the dish even more freshness, and mixed into all this were a minty but mellow shiso flavor enhanced by the unexpected sweetness of miso. Amazing. Foie gras: I honestly don't remember anything else on the dish except the foie gras - the tiniest bite explodes in a decadence that's both inexplicable and inimitable. (However, it's too small.)Mushroom risotto: probably my favorite appetizer. The wild mushrooms, seamlessly blended in with the perfectly cooked rice, and the gruyere cheese enhanced the nuttiness of the mushrooms. Maine lobster: don't worry about this being a measly serving of this ridiculously tasty crustacean. This dish was generous in both quantity and flavor. Each meaty bite of the lobster delivered sweetness and freshness, and convinced me that it was plucked from the ocean and cooked right away. Miso-marinated cod: my favorite entree. The cod practically glistened from a long soak in the miso marinade, though the corners of its surface was sweetly charred from being cooked. Each slice literally just slid off the rest of the fish, staying true to its flaky nature, and each bite slightly fatty and intensely savory. The dish was well-balanced with pieces of steamed bok choy, immersed in a gingery sauce, and a small mound of sticky rice, just the way Asians like to accompany their meats and fish. Dessert: an assortment of sweet endings entailed complimentary financiers, both almond- and chocolate-flavored; Gotham chocolate cake which was rich and when paired with an almond ice cream was what you'd expect of a chocolate/ice-cream dessert in fine dining; and an apple tartine, the star! Might I add - the apple tartine was a gift from Garin, as a sign of his apology for the overcooked steak (service at its BEST).One of us ordered the New York steak, which he claimed was not medium rare enough for his taste, so Garin brought a completely new one, apologized profusely, and didn't leave us until he heard that the meat was nothing short of perfection. Apparently the crispy onion rings were tasty too.I unfortunately can't attest to the drinks, as I was nursing a hangover and abstaining from alcohol - boo. But our table flowed with old-fashioned's, wines, and other cocktails, and everyone was raving about them. I sipped on a (virgin) delicious fizzy house-made concoction called ""Toast"". The complexity of the flavors, from white cranberry to ginger, made for an amazing beverage, and the whole table ended up abandoning their alcoholic ones for a little while to sample a glass. Everyone agreed. (This was again, another suggestion of Garin's, when I asked for ginger ale.) It's difficult to say where exactly I'd place this one on the Michelin map, if my dreams ever came true and I could visit restaurants and drop forks and be pampered, I would say: it's not quite an EMP or a BHSB (the Tarrytown), but it overshadows Atera in the 2-star category, and definitely stands out among some of its 1-star peers, like Batard and Aldea.

5.0,12/9/2017,"Great dining experience here. Loved the decor and ambiance of the restaurant. I was surprised to learn that this was a one Michelin star restaurant as the menu wasn't as out there as some of the usual Michelin star restaurants. I liked that the menu had ""normal"" items that were just really nicely done as I'm not a very adventurous eater. We had the truffle risotto app - $65 for a generous portion of fresh white truffle. The risotto had a really great flavor but was a little on the runny side.The Maine lobster was really good. The steak was pretty good too, although cooked more medium than medium rare (which is what we asked for). It wasn't really better than any of the steaks I've had at really great steakhouses but was still good. The seafood salad is really yummy!  Would totally have it again. The chocolate cake is more like a mousse - it doesn't have a cake like texture at all. Overall, Gotham is a safe Michelin star restaurant to go to where you'll get a solid meal with menu options that anyone could find something they'd like.",0,0,0,Jules M.,"North Dallas, Dallas, TX",0,57,23

4.0,12/4/2017,"We've been to the Gotham Bar & Grill for lunch numerous times and have always had a wonderful experience. Our first dinner there this past weekend was not quite as rewarding. The restaurant is beautiful and is nicely decorated for the Holidays but it was also very noisy. We had a reservation but had to wait 15 minutes to be seated as it was very crowded. The service was good but not outstanding eg; I had to remind our waiter three times that I had ordered a glass of wine. For the first course, I had the Muscovy Duck and Foie Gras Terrine. It was good but lacked that punch of flavor I was expecting. We also had the Niman Ranch steak special which was $100. It was very good but not worth that price considering that the great NYC steak houses have the very best steaks for lesser costs. The Rack of Lamb was also very good but needed more of a sear on the outside and seasoning and, the lamb reduction was very sparse. We both had the sorbet for dessert which was very good but, again, not exceptional. I'm being very picky with this review based on this restaurants reputation and the prices they charge. Everything should be exceptional but it wasn't...it was just very good at a very high price. We'll be back for lunch!",0,0,0,Mark S.,"Rocky Point, NY",0,130,0
2.0,12/3/2017,"Why the two stars? We had a 6:00 pm reservation with 4 adults and 2 children ages 16 and 18 months. We had a great time, the children were well behaved, the wait staff was accommodating and the food was delicious.  We even had people coming to our table giving us compliments about how well behaved the children were. At some point the children needed some extra  entertainment as they started to whine and appear bored. Being well equipped parents we provided the children with coloring books and crayons. As we enjoyed our dinner and drinks, we had a manager come up to our table to tell us to not allow the children to color on the table cloth. We looked over and realized the kids went outside of their coloring books. We immediately took away the crayons and entertained them with toy cars. The dinner was great up until we received the bill. The waiter stated "" I apologize but this wasn't in my control."" We look at the bill and we see that they charged us $35 for a linen fee for crayon markings. We were shocked and appalled so we asked to speak to the manager Noah Alexander; Noah stated I am sorry we cannot remove crayon it is a stain and we have to charge you. Our bill was $630, we ordered drinks, appetizers, entrees, desserts and coffee.  We tipped the excellent waiter and bussing staff accordingly. We paid $350 a couple. Being that we kept the children quiet, entertained and spent so much money at this restaurant we couldn't understand the nerve of this manager.  As I come from a family of restaurant owners we have a policy of "" the customer is always right."" The manager had not one intention of removing the charge. We kept the table cloth and washed it first thing in the morning, guess what? Crayon removed! What was supposed to be a lovely dinner turned out to a poor experience because of the managers poor social and people skills. This manager Noah Alexander does not deserve to be in hospitality. We are so disappointed at this event and will never return to Gotham Bar and grill. Whoever hired this manager needs to consider a reevaluation.",1,1,0,Michaela E.,"West Hollywood, CA",0,2,5
2.0,12/1/2017,Our experience at Gotham Bar and Grill did not start off well. If it were an Applebee's or an Olive Garden I would've been more understanding. We arrived 20 min before our reservations. There were only two seats together at the bar and we were there to celebrate our recent engagement. The hostess stated we should stand away from the hostess stand but there was nothing that she could do. The bartender quickly shewed us away from the two seats together and stated they were saved for someone else apparently more important than my money. We will not be back.

3.0,11/24/2017,Here's my honest review on a 4hundred + dollar (incl tax and tip) meal for 2 people (our 1 yr marriage anniversary). 1st star - great cocktails. Recommend the whiskey sour and the blueberry thyme caipirinha. 2nd star- appetizers: seafood salad and oysters (east ones are better than west)3rd star - Niman ranch 40 day dry aged steak. Great flavorful crust. However: Sides left something to be desired. Mashed potatoes were thin. Veggies were just okay and the custard sauce on the side was kind of gross. Final thoughts: We didn't get dessert bc it just didn't sound appetizing. Waitstaff is OD attentive to the point of being annoying. Waiter literally came by every minute to see if my husband was finished eating his oysters. One. By. One. Crowd is mostly age 45+.  Place just feels stuffy and pretentious.

4.0,11/21/2017,"I booked a table for 3 here recently to celebrate a milestone birthday. We arrived and were seated promptly. We ordered drinks and main courses, which arrived in a reasonable timeframe after the complementary bread. I got the rack of lamb, while my dining companions both opted for the miso cod. The lamb itself was delicious, but the potatoes could have used some help. Their miso cod was very good, but not quite as saturated with flavor as I had expected. Dessert was really the home run course. I got the chocolates, 3 assorted varieties, which were so amazing I don't even remember what anyone else at the table ordered. They all thought their desserts were the best, though. Throughout dinner and dessert we felt well attended, always had water and offers for more drinks were made. Two issues though- after dessert, it took 40 minutes to get the check. We ended up having to wave someone over to go get our bill and check, as we were trying to make a train that didn't run past 10pm. I really didn't anticipate this being an issue, having arrived at 6:45 and given ourselves ample time to enjoy the meal, but, this check thing really took quite a bit longer than expected. Also, the tables. There's a long bench on one side and chairs on the other, tables in the middle. I sat on the bench side, and had to get up in the middle of dinner. With the spacing of the tables all being so close together that you can't squeeze between them (it involves physically moving tables when someone wishes to leave) it was a hassle, and I felt like I was interrupting the dinner of the table next to us because I had to get up. Yes, I understand space is at a premium, but it's pretty poor design when you count on physically moving entire tables to access 50% of your seating. It also makes intimate conversation impossible, so, be careful what you plan to discuss with your partner here.",1,0,0,April H.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,301,373

We shared the $26 tuna tartare which in my opinion was very expensive for what it was. Subsequently we had the $50 cod and I had the mushroom risotto. The portion of risotto was pathetic for the $29. Next to that it was too runny, and more like soup than risotto. Same applied to the Miso cod of $48, again pathetic size with a couple of brussels sprouts. When we made our disappointment clear to the waiter,  who forgot to bring the cheese and salt and pepper, he said he would ""lodge it with the management""and then walked away ! What a pompous idiot. Any good restaurant would have the manager over straight away. Gotham has clearly chosen to go the path of milking the customer for as much money as they can without any regard for value for money.

4.0,11/11/2017,"Gotham is my special occasion place when I want a nice comfortable meal with friends. My last visit was good but I just have to say the service disappointed me, and this is the first time this has happened.When I booked the table I added a comment that a Spanish language speaking server would be appreciated. My partner and I were entertaining a friend from Argentina whose English isn't that strong but who appreciates nice dining and American cuisine. So I really wanted the evening to be as relaxed and comfortable for him as possible. When I checked in the host acknowledged my special request for the bilingual server and I thought everything was going to be fine. It was a rather long wait before the waitress appeared, and an equally long wait for her to take our drink order. She did introduce herself and told us she spoke Spanish, and spoke a few words of it to our guest. But then she gave us our menus and left him to struggle with it. We had to translate everything line by line, and I guess that's our issue but somehow I thought she'd be more helpful. In fact, when we made a similar request at a restaurant with similar stature our waiter really supported our guest and made him feel comfortable with the menu. Our waitress at Gotham just didn't make us feel like she cared much, but she performed her serving tasks so I can't say she failed to do her most basic job role. It wasn't 'poor' service, it was just not outstanding service. Gotham isn't cheap, and we've had so many positive experiences there, this was a bit of a letdown.Will we be back at Gotham?

But now I realize that it's just a super well-kept secret by the real foodies, because this restaurant is probably one of the best restaurants I've been to in my 27 years of living in New York. Gotham meets all the top-notch criteria: been around for ages, a constant rotation of their menu to reflect what is in season, and perfectly consistent quality in all their dishes. My favorite dish by far is the soft shell crab--this was so delicious, we ordered another one right after because we couldn't get enough. The Sweet Corn Tortellini was so delicious, it was halfway appalling that there were only 4, because how can anyone just eat 4 of these? I've also tried several Miso Black Cods, and this is definitely near the top of the list. The Pork Chop is also one of their signature dishes and a popular recommendation. Don't think about skimping on dessert either, because these are also insanely delicious! The raspberry souffle is fantastic, and the chocolate cake is so light and creamy that I don't even think I could classify it as cake. It is transcends cake. It's like...a godly cake. You just have to try it to believe it. Aside from the dessert, by far the sweetest thing about Gotham is their service. The staff was extremely attentive, charming, and just outstandingly well-trained! The Sommelier made fantastic recommendations despite us giving her the most impossible preferences (We may have said something along the lines of, ""Half the table hates Red.

The menu has little bit of everything for everybody but small and not confusing. Started with some fresh bread and very nice bottle of wine from their list. Foie grass and asparagus risotto (tasty and enough for 4 of us to get a bite). Black miso cod is the best ever, better than Nobu. Pork chop is perfect entree for men in your group. Seafood salad was the best entree I have had In a long time anywhere, perfect mix of fresh lobster, scallops, octopus and shrimp with Citric greens, and good size for small meal. Tuna tartare the most beautiful presentation and very tasty. Finished with flourless chocolate cake - the most intense dark chocolate flavor, and ice cream covered in chocolate sauce and peanuts, couple bites is enough but could not stop nibbling on it. Overall, amazing experience, worth the splurge and highly recommend for all. Can't wait to go back. Top 5 restaurants ever for me.",0,0,0,Aurelija M.,"Vero Beach, FL",82,5,6

4.0,8/25/2017,"Gotham is an above average NYC restaurant with above average food, service and pricing.  My experience was that they do everything pretty well, not spectacular but pretty darn good.  We split an order of the tuna tartar to start and to my delight they kitchen actually made two separate but smaller orders. It was not just an extra plate and fork. Quite a thoughtful beginning made an excellent initial impression.  It looked and tasted very nice.  I appreciated the subtle addition of shiso leaf in the seasoning even though I'm not a big fan of it's distinct flavor.  The asparagus risotto was acceptable but did not make the wow impression I was hoping for.  Same for the kale salad. The halibut and black cod entrees were closer but still not overly compelling. Certainly not commensurate with the pricing.  Gotham has a great wine list and attentive staff. The vaulted ceilings yield an impressive setting. It's an enjoyable overall  experience  with above average ratings across most aspects of interest.",0,0,0,Anthony A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,70
3.0,8/21/2017,Yelp let me down on this one. Stuffy. Not my crowd. Not a place for a girls night out.Food was mediocre so I have no idea how this got a Michelin star. It seriously makes no sense.The tuna tartare was dry and absolutely forgettable and so was the ceviche.The branzino was underwhelming at best. The duck was  the only saving grace. Pork was okay.  Nothing special. Lamb was decent. What an overpriced meal. Even the dessert was ridiculous. We got 2 ice cream but they were very tiny. The chocolate cake was way too sweet you can't survive more than 3 bites.Our server did not even smile at all.

5.0,8/21/2017,"My favorite upscale restaurant in NYC.The ambiance is nice.  Bright, well decorated, clean ambiance.  I've been here for Restaurant Week lunch and also for regular dinner.  The food and service is very good.  It is pricey, but you do get what you pay for here.  Dinner here is a delightful experience.The risotto that I've tried was one of the best.  I hate it when risotto is soggy - here, they served it a bit al dente, which was perfect.  It wasn't drowned in sauce/soup that it felt like porridge.  Just great preparation and excellent presentation.The steak that I ordered medium was a perfect medium.  Compared to Peter Lugers and other NYC steakhouses, it was on par with them, with some of the other steakhouses having a slight edge.The service was excellent.  Staff was attentive and not overbearing.  From the moment that you are greeted at the door to the time that you pay your bill, the staff did an excellent job to make sure that we were taken care of.With all the Michelin star restaurants in NYC, there are many more on my list to go to.  But I will come back here every now and then, knowing that this is a reliable winner for a special event.",2,0,1,Brian C.,"Manhattan, NY",26,270,0
4.0,8/17/2017,"An overall good restaurant week experience - gazpacho was gazpacho, salmon was underwhelming and tasted like the stuff you can get at the grocery stuff. Entrees were better as the chicken was quite moist and flavorful while peach green goddess dressing was a well balanced blend of sweet and savory. The branzino had an excellent crispy skin, but the quinoa was overly tart from the tomato vinaigrette. For dessert, the vanilla parfait with lemon sorbet and blueberries was refreshing and light. The chocolate cake was closer to a mousse, but I appreciated the fluffy texture as well as the slightly more bitter chocolate.

5.0,8/11/2017,"$29/person for a 3 course meal at 1 star Michelin star restaurant? Of course I had to take the advantage of NYC Restaurant Week of 2017 Summer. Thank god I made the reservation one hour earlier because there were about 15 people waiting for a table when we got there around 1:30pm. Our reservation was at 1:45pm and we waited until 1:50pm to get our table but I have no complaint because there were people who were waiting before us and we got the table earlier due to our reservation. My husband got summer vegetable salad, pan roasted branzino and chocolate cake. I got cured Atlantic salmon, free range chicken salad, and vanilla parfait. I've been to two other 1 star Michelin star restaurants, and I would say while Gotham bar & grill has more relaxing bar and their decorations looked a bit more 'less expansive', I enjoyed my meal at Gotham bar & grill the most. The portions were small but I was comfortably full at the end of the course. Each dish was combined with unique ingredients and flavors that I've never tasted before, which was a pleasant surprise. There were multiple servers handling our table and they seemed less personable but they were fast and efficient.

5.0,8/10/2017,"I came here with a friend during restaurant week. Having not looked up the place before hand and made the reservation at my friend's request, I saw the name and thought (and hoped) that it'd be a small, hole in the wall type gastropub -- not unlike The Spotted Pig (of which I am a huge fan).Boy was I in for a pleasant surprise! Entering the elegantly designed dining room woefully underdressed in my normal athleisure wear, we were seated by an incredibly friendly waiter. My friend and I quickly perused the menu and decided to split a few items -- the Heirloom Tomato Gazpacho and Cured Atlantic Salmon for starters, followed by the Pan Roasted Branzino and Duck Breast for the main course, and ending with the famous Gotham Chocolate Cake and assorted sorbets.Everything was exquisite -- the service, the atmosphere, and the food was second to none. The gazpacho was absolutely refreshing on the warm New York afternoon and the calamansi lime emulsion accompanying the salmon was delightful. Of the main courses, the duck certainly took the cake -- the juiciness of the roasted black plum with the tokyo turnip duck sauce lightly drizzled on top left me speechless. Finally, if you come here for one thing, you have to get the chocolate cake, both light and moist with just a dollop of salted almond ice cream to wash it down.

3.0,8/8/2017,"We always know the food will be amazing and the service beyond with an ease that really stands out.  A favorite in over 20yrs of ours. While I did enjoy my meal, I must state the last 2 experiences the service has really fallen a few notches.  This last time I found myself actually startled several times by a server repeatedly asking us about water?! and our waiter seemed irritated, it was uncomfortable like when you are around someone who really doesn't like you. The other time our waiter never checked in after our food arrived. Two of us ordered the same thing which was incredibly salty. We couldn't eat it, the waiter never even asked if everything was okay seeing our meals barely touched. We did say something but the waiter didn't respond and cleared the plate. Because we know Gotham as having superior service we thought we would let the host know our experience after our friends left so as to not make a scene.  Again, they really couldn't care.  We didn't plan on returning again, but a friend wanted to come here for her birthday so we did.I am relieved my last experience I enjoyed my food, but with a second experience of bad service it is no longer at the top of my list.

3.0,7/26/2017,"After hearing rave reviews from a past employee and knowing that Gotham has been a long staple of NY, I was very excited. I was given the option to sit at a table or the bar and chose the bar. However, there is a large gap between the rail and the bar and it looked as if I would have a hard time dining. Although they provide you with some type of tray to bridge the gap, I am only 5'3"", and it was still awkward, so I moved to a table located in the bar area. I was approached by Robert aka Beau and he brought me water. I sat for a long time before he decided to take my order. He walked by me several times without acknowledging my existence and so finally after some rubbernecking, I saw him chatting with the other staff and I had to ""summon"" him with the look. When he approached, all he asked me was if I was ready to order and if I had any questions. No mention of the specials or recommendations that I had heard about from the waiter at the table below me. I ordered the kale salad and he said ""is that all"" while gathering my menus. I told him I planned to order a meal and I placed the menu back in front of me. He had the audacity to remove my menu and place it on the table across from me and said that he needed that space to place my salad. I was appalled. Maybe I should not have dined at Gotham after having dined at Gabriel Kreuther the night before. The service at Gabriel is what I am accustomed to as I dine all over the country at least 4-5 times a week, so when I receive bad service, it is always a shame. The salad was very good albeit a little too much dressing, so I would suggest asking for a light pour. Again, after what seemed forever, I had to search for beau to place my order of the miso cod (which was made to perfection). I was truly annoyed by him so much so, that I had to ask a front manager if he was a new employee and to my dismay, I gathered that he has been employed at Gotham for a while. Evidently, she must have had a chat with him, because he seemed more attentive, but it was too late at that point, as I was on to dessert. I decided on the chocolate cake and it was extremely good, but very rich. Gotham also graciously provides you with a basket of chocolate and vanilla financiers.As I was signing my check, I noticed in the side pocket a brochure that Gotham's Cordioli olive oil won the gold prize at the 2017 NY international olive oil competition and is served in the dining room. It would have been very nice to have known that as I would have liked to try it and most likely would have bought a bottle. Overall, while I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, I concur with a few other Yelpers, that the service is pretty bad. Beau should have spent less time socializing with the staff and more time noticing my empty plates. I almost reduced his tip from 20% to 15%, but instead, I wanted to send a message that class always takes the high road and we always do what is right regardless of how poor we are treated.",6,1,1,Quin T.,"Chicago, IL",132,580,4

I arrived and the location was pretty empty which is surprising for the evening. I checked in and the host took us all across the restaurant to seat us in completely empty area in a corner that has a wall blocking the rest of the restaurant. It was the most bizarre thing I have ever expereince. Having friends in the restaurant industry its surprising the host wouldn't fill the front or middle part of the restaurant instead he put us literally in a corner. There wasn't any server that came over to introduce themselves. There were three employees standing around and after some time of waiting we left. Why would a restaurant have three people standing around and not think to check on their only guest in the empty area.

3.0,6/5/2017,"Gotham has been on my list for quite some time and to be honest, I left disappointed in the food quality and taste. For the price of this restaurant, I expected the meals to be one of the best ever and I just didn't get that. I had the free range chicken which was tough and bland. For $40, I would expect this chicken to be flavorful and tender. I will point out, though, the service and ambience were exception. From the moment you enter the restaurant, you are treated like royalty. The team of waiters are very knowledgeable and able to provide smart recommendations. They even allowed me to sample a few drinks until I found one that I enjoyed. The ambience is very old-school charm with high vaulted ceilings, wood paneling, and minimal wall décor. The service alone earns a 3 star rating. Based on the high level of reviews Gotham has received, I would like to think that I might have had a one-off disappointing experience.

The food was absolutely delicious. The pea soup was rich and flavorful; the branzino was perfectly roasted with a nice crunch to its skin; and the chocolate cake was wonderful. The cake was not too sweet (which is the problem I usually have with chocolate cakes) and it's texture was smooth and reminded me of a brownie more than a cake. My friend let me try her chicken dish and that one bite just blew my mind. It was moist and tender, and its skin had a nice crispiness to it. I have to mention the green chickpeas on the chicken dish. It just tasted so fresh. I would definitely return to order the chicken dish for myself in the future.

Being a lightweight, I had NO idea that the Ryes and Shine would get me red that quickly but overall, it was a good drink. It was more bitter than I expected but then again, I'm not expert since I do not drink much. Next came our meals - we had ordered the lunch which consisted of the quinoa salad for myself and the soup for my friend. I didn't try the soup but the salad was a nice starter! Next came our entrees which consisted of my chicken dish and his fish dish. What I loved about the chicken dish was that it wasn't dry (isn't that always a great thing when you order chicken outside?). I also loved the vegetables that came with it and I think they paired well together. For our desserts, my sorbet was a bit tarte but not overly sour. Surprisingly, as a person who doesn't like cherries much, the cherry sorbet to me was the best. My friend had the chocolate cake and it felt so chocolate-y (not a bad thing). It held a more ""creamy"" texture which made it taste less ""cake-y"" but still yummy. We also had a complimentary dish for his graduation which consisted of almond(?), chocolate and vanilla(???) mini cakes. Overall, I loved the atmosphere here.

We ordered the Green Market Lunch for $38. I ordered the kale salad, the campanelle pasta, and the chocolate cake. My lunch companion ordered the kale salad, the free range chicken, and the baked Alaska for dessert. One word: WOW!! From the very beginning, we were blown away by the level and quality of the food and the service. The bread we started with was perfectly crunchy. The salad was well dressed and flavorful. The entrees were rich but not too rich and perfectly portioned. And the desserts were divine.

4.0,4/27/2017,"I've been wanting to try Gotham Bar & Grill for a while now, so it was the restaurant of choice for my one year wedding anniversary.  We arrived on a Saturday night, about 15 minutes before our reservation time; however, we were immediately seated.  We sat in the very back close to a window, tucked away in a sense, making the mood very intimate and romantic for my husband and I.  As I glanced around the white, crisp room, I noticed that although fancy, there was still something about the dining room that made the atmosphere comfortable.  Some fine dining restaurants can be stuffy and this one definitely didn't come off that way.As far as the service goes, I wasn't thrilled with our waitress.  It's pretty bad when halfway through the meal, our waitress disappears, never to return, and then we have to start pouring our own wine out of our bottle, while looking around the room to see when and if another worker would come and finish off the dinner for us.  My guess is that our initial waitress got off of work without telling us that someone else would be taking over, because once someone started to see us pouring wine in our glasses, another waitress came over to see if we were pouring our bottle or stealing from someone else's (talk about rude), and then the man that was previously passing out bread to everyone, took over as our waiter for the rest of the night.  It was extremely awkward and weird having to deal with that part of the evening.The first bottle of wine we selected, the Sommelier came over to tell us that the bottle was out of stock.  I couldn't understand why a Michelin Star restaurant would be out of stock on anything, so my expectations were immediately lowered for the remainder of the night.  The Sommelier recommended another wine that was close in style and price point to our first option, so we went with it.  Once the bottle of wine was brought to us, we happened to love it and were pleased with the selection.Food breakdown:Yellowfin Tuna TartareI've eaten a hundred Tuna Tartare's in my day, and this is one of the best.  The crostini's were toasted at just the right amount, the flavor of the tuna was exceptional, and the cucumbers with the sauce really elevated the overall taste combined together.  Red Shrimp CevicheI've never been a fan of ceviche until trying Gotham's.  There was just the right amount of acidity, sweetness, and mildness to the shrimp, fruit, and sauce of the Ceviche.  We couldn't decide which we preferred out of the Ceviche and the Tuna Tartare, as they were both excellent seafood choices to start off with.Escarole SaladFor my second course, I wanted to go with a simple salad, and although simple, it was one of the best salads I've ever had.  The pistachios, escarole, vinaigrette, etc all blended so wonderfully together.  It was pure perfection.Shellfish BisqueThe bisque was light, yet creamy, with a great flavor overall.  There wasn't a lot of seafood in the bisque; however, the seafood flavor was definitely there.  Thank goodness this was my husband's second course and not mine, because I ordered the Lobster as my third course and I'm pretty sure it was the same bisque in the entrée.Maine LobsterMy highlight of the night was this lobster dish.  There was a large portion of lobster, which was so appreciated.  The entire meal was divine.Long Island Duck BreastI am not a fan of duck or foie gras, but I was sold from the one bite that I had.  The only thing is that this dish was so rich that I wouldn't have been able to eat an entire plate of it.  We were so full that we didn't want to order dessert.  But, to our surprise, the new waiter brought us a small cup of muffins, which were delightful!  Even though we were stuffed, we managed to eat every last vanilla and chocolate muffin since they were so moist and tasteful.Overall, the meal was sensational.  The service could have been a lot better, and I wasn't thrilled that they were out of the first wine that we selected.  Other than that, it was a great time and a nice experience.",7,0,2,Lily M.,"Dallas, TX",621,875,1389

WOW, what a bargain! And the food is fantastic. I started with a celery root soup that was rich a creamy, garnished with toasted hazelnuts and perfectly cubed caramelized pears. To die for, and it prompted me to buy a copy of the cookbook that Alfred originally published the recipe in (conveniently offered for sale at the restaurant). My boyfriend ordered the baby kale salad dressed with apples, cranberries, marcona almonds, and maple vinaigrette. I tried a bite of his salad and agreed with him that it was delicious. Light and sweet. My main entree was one of the restaurant's newer dishes- grilled branzino served over roasted leeks, potatoes and olives in a blood orange reduction. Also amazing. My boyfriend chose the roasted chicken with sauteed apples, creamed potatoes, and a red wine reduction. We finished up our meal with the chocolate cake and left feeling fat and happy.

And from the coat check to the wait service, you are treated royally well.And they do not skimp on the portions! They offer a set three course meal, with each dish surpassing the previous one. Ordered the kale salad for appetizer - which was sweeter than expected but equally satisfying my pallet. For the entree, the fish was spot on. Skin was especially crunchy and so flavorfully baked.

3.0,2/5/2017,"My soup appetizer came in a dish with four-inch rims that sloped down to a bowl that could hold less than a cup. The frisée in my companion's delicious salad was teased out like Donald Trump's hair, giving the illusion of twice its heft. I was served less than four ounces of branzino with five of those tiny round potatoes and an indistinct puddle of minced vegetables that had no doubt been poached in some ethereal broth. My companion's chicken was considerably more robust and I could swear I saw at least three brussels sprouts on the plate. But you don't have to be Alan Turing to realize that chicken costs about a quarter of what branzino does. My neighbor ordered the short ribs of beef which looked fantastic but it came at a twelve-dollar supplement, thus defeating the spirit of Restaurant Week. The desserts were tasty but minuscule.

4.0,2/4/2017,"Situated near Union square, this restaurant is unassuming on the street front but absolutely beautiful once you walk inside. I was prompted to try this place during restaurant week and had a delightful experience. We ordered from the restaurant week menu and the regular menu for lunch. The following is what I tried:Seafood salad (5/5) - Incredible. Small amount of food for its price, but that is to be expected at a four dollar sign restaurant. In terms of flavor, it was absolutely wonderful. All the seafood (scallop, octopus, shrimp, lobster) was perfectly cooked. The slight touch of tang from the lemon vinaigrette made this a refreshing and perfect appetizer. So delicious.Pan Roasted Branzino (4.5/5) - The branding was absolutely perfect. The skin was crispy, and the fish was cooked just right. I enjoyed it a lot, the only complaint I have is the fennel confit. That was not very tasty at all. If it wasn't there, this dish would likely be a 5/5. Setaro Mezzi Rigatoni (4/5) - This is pretty much a very fancy short rib pasta. I am a huge fan of pasta, and this dish was tasty. But it was not very unique. The pasta was good, but not fantastic. For a Michelin Star I was expecting something that would leave me with an impression, and unfortunately this dish was a tasty pasta I am likely to forget.Gotham Chocolate Cake (4/5) - It tasted very similar to a flourless chocolate cake. It is good, not too dense, but still very rich. The salted caramel ice cream that came with the chocolate cake was a bit too salty. I think the cake was good, but again it was not fantastic. It was chocolaty but the individual components of the dessert did not work super well together. Service was solid even during restaurant week.

This provided a nice combination of textures and flavors. The entree was pan roasted branzino. It was over a fennel confit, black olives, potatoes, and blood orange emulsion.  The skin of the fish was crispy, and the other elements supported the delicate fish without competing with it.  We ended with chocolate cake and salted almond ice cream.  The cake had a soft creamy texture, but with the intense chocolate flavor you expect from a heavier cake.

We had the yellow fin tuna tartare, mushroom risotto, miso glazed black cod, halibut and mascarpone mousse as dessert. The tuna tartare was a real disappointment. We've tried tuna/raw fish tartare at so many different places/countries (some are much affordable restaurants), this one is one of the worst. The tuna is tasteless, and the ikura on the cucumbers I saw from the photos here was changed to be miso paste. It's like eating raw fish without seasonings. The mushroom risotto was ok. Black cod, the fish itself was ok. Yes, you cant really go wrong with black cod; however, the sauce was very boring. It said it's miso glazed, but I could hardly taste it. Instead of miso, they put soy sauce underneath the cod. It's ok just because of the fish is nice. I don't like the soy sauce and the bed of bok choy and mushroom.Halibut was ok. Nothing amazing. Mascarpone mousse might be the best/most exciting thing we ate. The honey ice cream was interesting and the mousse with the crumbs were good combination.

We shared a pasta appetizer and I had the dry-aged steak, which I ordered medium well but came well done so I wish I had gone with medium.

5.0,1/9/2017,"Apparently Gotham Bar & Grill has retained the same dining room set up as it was the day it opened in 1984. Cloths drape over the overhead lighting and cast a dim glow onto the tan tablecloth and bare walls. A row of tables within the main dining hall forces guests to rub shoulders and eavesdrop conversations. The New York foodie who invited me here recounted a story of his once sitting next to a gynecologist in that row. He told me he had come to Gotham for the first time when he was my age, and now wanted to gift such an experience to me. It would be appropriate to wear a suit.The menu offers two parallel paths which I have yet to understand: one that provides you a starter and an entree, and another that offers simply a ""first"", a ""second"", and a ""third."" On account of having come to experience the wonders of Gotham, we each ordered the three course meal.The first that arrived in front of me was a tuna tartare. It came upon a bed of cucumbers and micro-greens dangling over two pieces of bread arranged like the spires of the Petronas towers in Kuala Lumpur. These soft tastes cut into the wonderfully sharp flavors of tangy, spicy, and salty that the tartare provided.The next dish was a foie gras. It was seared perfectly with a gooey interior that disappeared so quickly in my mouth I wish it could've lingered for just a bit longer. The fruit that it was paired with is now eluding me - perhaps an apricot? - but while I was told it was meant to cut the grease, was totally unnecessary as the Foie Gras itself was only a small piece to begin with and not heavy.The NY foodie had tried all of the delicacies I'd listed so far, so he went instead for the risotto. It came in a small serving with a creamy consistency. It was the kind of food that's so well incorporated that when I put the spoon in my mouth the taste saturated each flavor of my palette. Because of my novice foodie status, I couldn't quite pick out the distinct flavors within it.Finally the main course arrived: a hefty rack of lamb. I tend to like lamb shank more than a rack of lamb as it usually holds its moisture better. In this case, it was not too different. While the center of the medium rare rack was excellent, as I moved outwards, it became a little bit tougher than I would hope. But I loved the flavor. It was gamey without being overpowering. By the foodie's recommendation, we paired this with a first growth wine.And as I ate, I remembered another disadvantage to the rack of lamb: it's nearly impossible to finish off every bit of it. The pieces around the bone can only be left to its own. As I secretly wish I could tear off the last little bits and savor it with my wine.For a classy night out with friends, a price around $100 each (for food only!), is not too bad. And for a classy night out with friends who are foodies - Gotham Bar & Grill is highly recommended by me!",0,0,1,Willy X.,"New York, NY",873,222,74
1.0,12/29/2016,"Their policies of 48 hour required phone confirmation and charging $50 per person for cancellations within 24 hours of the meal are the epitome of restaurant ego and poor customer-focused service.

5.0,12/27/2016,"Came here for a lunch with the BF during a trip to NY and was pleasantly surprised by the food and the service. We decided to come here as it is one of the more affordable Michelin-starred restaurants. A lil tip: make sure you make a reservation if you plan on stopping here! They open for lunch at 12:00pm and our reservation was for 12:30, so it was relatively empty when we first arrived. However, throughout our first hour there, the tables were filling up rapidly and by the time we were finished with our meal, every table was occupied. They have a Prix Fixe ""Greenmarket Lunch"" option in which you receive a three-course meal for $38/person. Being frugal graduate students, of course that is the option we went for. The following is a review for each of our courses:Appetizer:Kabocha Squash Soup - 5/5. I thought this was absolutely delicious. Creamy and flavorful, and served in the perfect portion so that you're not left feeling heavy or full of regret. The squash was blended to a perfectly smooth consistency, and I would definitely recommend this if you are a fan of squash soup.Wild Striped Bass Ceviche - 5/5. This was an excellent dish as well and quite popular, as the tables around us all seemed to order it as their appetizer course. This sauce is nice and citrusy but not too sour.Main:French Quail - 3.5/5. This dish was just okay to me. If you like a more smokier flavor, you'll probably enjoy this as it was quite smokey. I actually am not a big fan of smoky meats, hence the mediocre score.Nova Scotia Halibut - 5/5. This was excellent! The halibut was cooked perfectly and was so soft and melted right in your mouth. The BF LOVED this dish and he hates really ""fishy"" dishes. So if you enjoy milder fish dishes, I would recommend this to you.Dessert: Caramel Panna Cotta - 4.5/5. This was delicious. Tasted like a mini apple pie crumble a la mode. The buttermilk ice cream was very creamy, yet portioned perfectly to ensure satisfaction without overindulgence. Gotham Chocolate Cake - 4/5. This cake had a more fudge-like texture, rather than cake-like texture (I am not a fan of fudge). It was quite good though.- And of course, be informed that the portion sizes are quite ""small"" in American standards. However, eaten slowly and spaced apart, it does leave you feeling full.- Customer service was great, and we never had to wait on drink refills.- Bathrooms are located downstairs.",6,0,2,Julia O.,"Houston, TX",446,48,55

3.0,12/21/2016,"My experience: food was SPECTACULAR, service was not--especially for a one-star Michelin restaurant. The food alone is what keeps this review afloat. I have to admit, I share my sentiments with other Yelpers who gave Gotham two or three stars. The bad: Our waitress was unfortunately not up to par. I sympathize that she had to cover a lot of tables, was courteous and professional..but my sister and I couldn't help but feel neglected throughout our meal. It got to a point where we had to ask the servers and busboys for our waitress. The tables between us shared the same issue. While I hate being rushed out at restaurants, it also should not take 30 minutes for customers to receive their check (Insert Frye meme of ""SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY""). Furthermore, there seemed to be either a lack of training or communication of the staff in general. When the servers gave us our food and dessert, they just plopped them down in front of us with nary an explanation; very perfunctory. Now the good: Holy macaroni, the food was amazing. My sister took the seafood route, while I was on a meat kick. My mezze rigatoni was the best starter ever, a heavenly combination of mozzarella and lamb shreds and the right amount of cream. The seafood salad was probably the best bang for your buck out of the options with the amount of lobster, shrimp, scallops, octupus, and squid. Worth it if you're a seafood lover.  I had the Long Island Duck Breast, and my sister had the Dover sole, which was cooked perfectly. The duck breast had an interesting combination with mustard and mango chutney. The foie gras was cooked to perfection: fatty and translucent without being gross. My sister enjoyed her Dover sole, which was grilled well and the sides complemented the fish nicely. I recommend both dishes. With two orders per person, we were quite full and glad we started small. Otherwise, I would've needed someone to roll me home.  Verdict: Glad I went, had great food, but service left a lot to be desired.

I'm talking straight up MELTS - seriously can't say enough about it.For the main course, we got the steak and the lobster. Both were just as good. My girlfriend especially was blown away by the presentation as well as taste of the lobster. For dessert they provided a nice ""Happy Birthday"" plate with a candle.

1.0,11/14/2016,"Came here for our anniversary.  We were shown to our table and met our waiter.  She was very nice and not pushy at all.  We decided on what we were going to have before ordering our wine.  We ordered the Ceviche, Tuna Tartare.  For mains we both ordered the Duck. For Dessert we ordered the Peanut Butter Sundae.  The Tartare was far superior than the ceviche but the tartare wasn't amazing.  Next was the duck.  We both thought that the duck had too much sauce which over powered the flavour of the meat.   The Sundae was the best part of our eating experience.  Now onto the wine.  This was this biggest disappointment for the night.  We weren't too sure what type of wine we wanted as we were going to try a different type to what we normally drink. So we asked the Sommelier for some advise.  She provided us with 3 different bottles of wine. We ordered a $90 of Grüner Veltliner Smaragd ""Achleiten"" Jäger.  When the Sommelier came back and started to pour she said ""It's not that cold and so would put it on ice. ""  We were almost finished the first glass when our waiter poured our second glass.  I noticed that it was the same temperature as before and asked her to make sure it's cold. I then asked the Sommelier what the recommended temperature was for the wine.  She said about 58*f.  I informed her that it still wasn't cold enough.  She then said that she would put more ice in the bucket.  Upon the 3rd refill of our glasses the wine was finally at the correct temperature.For an establishment like this that has a one Michelin star review I found it highly disappointing.  Having spoken to two members of staff about the wine temperature there was not even an apology.  For the amount of money spent I would go somewhere else.

But the Setaro Mezzi Rigatoni - simply awesome. My main entree was the Niman Ranch Pork Chop - which comes with sauerkraut, smoked bacon, sweet potato purée and apple quince chutney.  Excellent - the pork chop was cooked perfectly.  And the portion was pretty substantial - I was anticipating a ""french size"" (i.e. small) - not the case.  We shared a couple desserts.  The first was a peanut butter sundae (its more complicated than this, but best way I can describe it).  Loved it.  Second, we had the Mascarpone Mousse - which included figs, gingerbread, honey ice cream. Enjoyed this but liked the peanut butter dessert better.

If you're only going to stick with one appetizer, get the foie gras for sure! The outside was seared to perfection and the fattiness of the foie gras was married with a crunchy peanut sauce with a berry jam. If i base my review just off the appetizers, i would give it a 4.5.Unfortunately, my entree was a disappointment. Ordered the lamb and steak + drinks. Not a fan of lamb but it was cooked and seasoned well. I originally ordered the steak medium-rare. The steak came out totally medium-well...no red on the inside and it was tough to cut. Waiter suggested that i cut the middle of the steak... steak was grey and not an ounce of red. I immediately sent it back. THIS IS NOT A MISTAKE THAT A MICHELIN STARRED RESTAURANT SHOULD BE MAKING!!!!This was the first time i had ever sent food back to the kitchen. My replacement came out within 5-7 minutes. Waiter apologized. At this caliber of a restaurant, i expected at least a scoop of ice cream or small dessert...for a mistake that i expect from my local Applebee's.. not a michelin starred restaurant. Yes, our expectations should be higher for restaurants of this caliber.  Was foodless for a bit while mine was being cooked...boyfriend kept offering me his food because he felt awkward eating by himself. The steak does have a charred taste to it.. if youre not a fan of that taste, this steak is not for you. I thought the meat was tough...maybe ate about half the steak...offered some to my boyfriend and he ate some and gave it back to me... and he is a STEAK LOVER.

I've read some reviews and seen some pictures but had no idea what to order. My boyfriend ordered the yellowfin tuna tartar and I ordered a dozen oysters to share for our first course. I'm not the biggest fan of tartar because I think some places don't do it well but Gotham's was so savory! The yellowfin tuna tartar comes with Japanese cucumber, shiso leaf, sweet miso, and asian ginger vinaigrette. I was a little jealous I didn't order this and I wish it was bigger but I definitely ordered the better fish. The oysters were so yummy! I understand some people hate oysters, but they're wrong and they're delicious. We ended up ordering another half dozen! We could've just sat there and only ate oysters to be honest.We paired our first course and second course with a glass of their white wine. Our waiter was so great! He was making us laugh and giving us great suggestions. He also kept lighting our candle because for some reason we just kept blowing it out talking. The space is so big! I don't know what people are talking about when they say they are so close to other tables and it's so loud because I didn't feel that way at all but maybe it's different with a big group because I was only with my boyfriend.For the second course I ordered the seafood risotto and my boyfriend ordered the seafood salad. I loved my seafood risotto and you can tell they literally just made it a second ago! I was a little hesitant ordering risotto because places either undercook it or make it super mushy. This risotto was perfect. It was a red shrimp risotto with English peas, pea tendrils, pancetta, and manzanilla sherry reduction.  My boyfriends seafood salad looked great. I'm not the biggest fan of ordering salads at expensive places because I feel cheated but this salad was packed with scallops, squid, Spanish octopus, sweet shrimp, and avocado lemon vinaigrette. It's a good clean option and the octopus on it was on point. The third course we decided we wanted red meat. So, we ordered two glasses of red wine. I chose the rack of lamb with Swiss chard, roasted cipollini, potato purée, and a rich lamb reduction. I loved this lamb! It was so juicy and flavorful. My boyfriend ordered the pork chops with hen of woods mushrooms, broccolini, roasted potatoes, polenta, and a Marsala sherry reduction. I don't know how his pork chops tasted because he ate it all before I could get a bite! He told me it was very tasty though. We were so full we chose not to order dessert. Which I'm kind of regretting now because I see people raving about their chocolate cake! So, until next time. I would recommend this place to my friends if they wanted to celebrate something really special it's not really a place you go to every week or every month. Also, make sure to make a reservation!

I've been here before and loved it, but it was years ago. perhaps my memory failed me or this was an off night, but 5-star restaurants should be 5-star at all times. the food was mostly very good, but it's very loud and the service was not on a par with the foodour server was very perfunctory. not friendly at all. didn't ask if we needed any help with the menu or had any questions. took our drink order (no cocktail menu), but it took way too long for the drinks to come. it was weird. throughout the meal the service was very roboticall the food lived up to expectations, although I wouldn't order the steak again. would recommend the Argentine shrimp cerviche, seafood salad and branzinosince I don't live in NYC anymore and only get to visit a few times a year, we'll probably take a pass on GBG. it's sad because I had such great memories of it.",1,2,1,Bob U.,"Dublin, CA",669,633,143
4.0,9/23/2016,"Well, well, well! After a few years of building and perfecting my food snob reputation, I decided it was time to try my appetite at a Michelin Star Rated restaurant! And the hubby and I picked Gotham, as we wanted to stick with a 1-star rated place. I mean with $$$$ we figured that's pretty affordable for a couple of middle class people! I am nowhere near ready to take out a loan for a meal, so this fit the bill perfectly! With 4 people dining, the bill was a little over $430 which was not bad for a bottle of wine ($95), 2 appetizers, 4 entrees, and 3 cappuccinos!The atmosphere is upscale with a slightly classy vibe, which I liked. We were seated immediately (with reservations made kindly by my friend, through Opentable - convenient!!) Upon reaching the table, the maître' d kindly pulled the table out so that myself and my other female companion could be seated on the comfy bench seat. But, here is where they lost a .25 star! I was wearing a black dress and they provided white linen napkins! This surprised me as I have been to less expensive (but still upscale) dining establishments that offer either a white or black napkin to match your attire, as to prevent lint from showing on your clothes after dining. They were missing this little detail, which was astonishing to me! But on to the FOOD! First of all, all of the food was utterly amazing, with the exception of the hubby's Dry-aged steak. While I thought it was fine, he was not impressed at all. But there is a key point to my statement, it was ""fine"". It should have been mouth-watering amazing! But, let me talk about what was amazing! For appetizers, we ordered the Yellow Fin Tuna Tartare and Wild Mushroom and Foie Gras Terrine. Wow!! The tartare was art-on-a-plate and was very well seasoned and very fresh. I wished there was more! And the foie gras, color me impressed! This was my first ever experience with foie gras and I can say I was pleasantly surprised! Who would have thought I liked liver?? I just focused on not thinking about WHAT I was eating, and instead focused on the flavors and how they went so well with the small bits of fruit and beet that accompanied the dish. Very good combination!For entrees, my girlfriend and I each got the Thai Spiced Maine Lobster and the boys ordered the Rack of Lamb and the 28-day Dry Aged Steak. Man!! That LOBSTER though! The Lobster was another art-on-a-plate presentation, with the meat just barely laying inside of the shell (which made it effortless to remove from the shell). The lobster had a great flavor and I could really taste the ginger and curry sauces, done just right, and not too overpowering. The light sauce allowed the lobster taste itself, to still shine! The lobster was laid over a bed of Asian noodles that were also very delicious. I cleaned my plate, to say the least!The Rack of Lamb was also amazing! Luckily my girlfriend's hubby shared two bites with me. The presentation of the lamb was well done and it was a large portion. Very well seasoned, cooked medium to rare and just tender and juicy and lovely! But sadly, here is where they lost the other .25 star! The steak!! I can agree with the hubby that the steak had a char flavor that took away from the flavor of the beef some. While I did enjoy the few bites that I had, and it was cooked to a perfect medium-rare, I have to say it was just fine. No wow factor though, which was disappointing considering the Michelin star!I did enjoy everything for the most part and the service was great. When entering the restaurant, the maître d asked if we were celebrating anything and it just happened to be both my hubby and my birthdays, within a week of each other! And after our meal, the hubby and I were graced with the cutest little dessert with different flavored cake balls, and a nice piece of chocolate with ""Happy Birthday"" written quite impressively on such a small piece of sugar square! And a cute little birthday wish candle as well! Great touch and a great end to the night! Overall, a strong 4.5 stars!Follow me on my way to foodietown! britneygfoodie.yelp.com",3,1,2,Britney G.,"Houston, TX",446,526,2524
3.0,9/23/2016,"This was it. The big one. My first foray into a Michelin Star restaurant. So I thought I would dip my toes in slowly and start off with a highly recommended 1 star - The Gotham Bar and grill. Whilst visiting friends in New York and being a Texas boy, I thought it would be an experience to finally dine at a Michelin Star restaurant. For the most part, the Gotham was amazing. Our party was seated right away thanks to our handy reservations courtesy of our friends we were staying with. The atmosphere was delightful. You could hear the whims of conversation taking place over drinks, but it wasn't so loud it was deafening. The host slid the table out so the lovely wife and accompanying friend could adjourn to a comfortable bench. The table was then slid into comfortable range of the ladies so the men could sit down. Now, my wife while wearing a black dress was forced to use a white napkin. This would certainly be a food critics niggle, but she brushed it off. I was a little discerned as I have eaten at far lesser restaurants that offer both napkin choices for the corresponding attire. Our party was eager to get to the mains. So we ordered 2 starters for the table to share. The Yellowfin Tuna Tartare...so sweet, so fresh, so delectably gentile, subtle, and explosive all at once...it was every bite amazing. We wished we had ordered 3-4 of these it was that good. However, the Tartare was slightly overshadowed by one of my guilty pleasures, Wild Mushroom and Foie Gras Terrine.Yes. I like fatty liver. Yes I know there will be some ecomentalist or PETA member (which I am a member of, People Eating Tasty Animals) blithering on about how cruel it is blah blah...droning...annoying hipster voices...sorry...lost it there for a sec. I don't care. It tastes good. Damn good. I hunt, skin, clean, and consume my own forages in the form of wild game. Fatty Liver? Delicious. And this was no exception. So soft cutting it with a knife seemed insulting. So deliciously satisfying I smirked, until I smiled, until I exclaimed...""Damn this is good."" And brioche...well...enough said as it is brioche. Then out came the mains. The loving wife and her best friend ordered the Thai Spiced Maine Lobster. Which was amazing. Perfectly cooked lobster with amazing presentation. The Thai spiced noodles were softy, just slightly softer than al dente, and delectable. The other male companion in the group ordered the Rack of Lamb, which was superb. Soft, juicy, flavorful little riblets which, when split into individual lollipops revealed they were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Truly a treat in which I wish I had partaken. I went for the daddy...the 28 Day Dry Aged New York Steak. Never meet your heros. As noted earlier, I hail from Texas currently. I have had many a bovine critter on my plate if you know what I mean. Some of which were mooing that morning. I am also a home gastronomist and have put hours upon hours of practice into perfecting the judicious application of heat and seasoning to bovine parts. The steak here was good-ish. You could taste the age and it was cooked about as perfectly perfect as cooked perfect steak gets, but that was about it. The beefiness was far overshadowed by the char on the outside, which was borderline all you could taste. It seemed there was no seasoning at all on the steak. The char flavor permeated the through the meat so much the aged steak flavor I so was so wantonly desperate for was all but gone. Top it off with a bordelaise that also had an air of burnt char only compounding the meat masking flavors. I continued to eat the steak, not wanting to send a Michelin dish back. The onion rings that accompanied the steak were sweet, but bland. Salt could have saved these as well. But the rings like the meat seemed un-seasoned after so much care was taken to perfectly fry them. The root vege that came with the dish was delicious as was the mustard custard. The steak though...just a miss this evening. We did take a recommendation from the house sommelier and paired our meals with a lovely bottle of red. Excellent recommendation on their part. The after-dinner cappuccino's were delightful, tasty, and a filling way to end the evening. In summary, this evening was like driving a Lamborghini Countach. Damn near EVERYTHING is perfect...the presentation, the way it looks, the way the scissor doors slide open, the touch of the steering wheel, the smell of the Italian leather, almost perfect...except for the one thing you actually wanted it to do...be fun to drive...while the remainder of the experience is epic...you can't help but feel a little gutted. Which is not to say I would EVER dissuade someone from eating here. Really. The place is magnificent. Just don't get the steak. And never meet your heros.",2,1,0,Matt G.,"Houston, TX",177,211,598
4.0,9/22/2016,"Went on a Monday with family.We were quickly seated as we had a reservation, and were greeted by a courteous yet unobtrusive server. The food was good. I had the prawn ceviche (great and spicy, presented differently than expected, in a row with a little bit of the ceviche liquid added at the table) and followed it with the branzino, which was good but I thought too many flavors going on in that dish for such a delicate fish.

Not authentic by any means, but incredibly refreshing and delicious. Tiny bites of watermelon, cucumber, just surprise after surprise. (My dining companions had amazing-looking apps also)Halibut: Straightforward, perfectly prepared. Corn and tomatoes alongside were delicious.Dessert of sorbet (boring, yes, but I was full!): Perfect quenelles, not icy, served very quickly after we ordered desserts.The plates that my companions ordered looked so amazing it was a shame to put a fork to them.

The vegetables with curry reminded me of airplane food.The rack of lamb was completely burnt and tasteless. The ""mashed potatoes"" was basically a single sliced potato taken straight out of a boiling pot of water with no seasoning.

I also enjoyed the duck, very tender and flavorful. For dessert we got the soufflé which was fluffy and had a good flavor.

Don't get me wrong, my meal was excellent, the service was good, and the atmosphere was along the lines of classic old New York establishments (high ceilings, a sprinkle of formality and close tables). Really though, the offerings and the experience was a duplicate of many places I have eaten in New York and also my native Cleveland, which is no slouch to NY restaurants in its own right. Compared to other Michelin establishments, Gotham did not do anything that much differently than many other excellent restaurants I have visited without the coveted star.

Each of our family members ordered different appetizers, including:-beet salad-artichoke tortellini-complimentary bread.All of them were amazing and well worth the price. For entrees, we had -miso black cod, which was absolutely delicious, juicy, and very well prepared (although rice was useless)-Pork Chop, which was probably the best of hem all, with a crispy outside and a flavorful, amazing inside.-28 day aged steak, which was also crispy, flavorful, and well cooked (I got medium rare). The onion rings were excellent.-Free Range Chicken, which was possibly best of all, with moist, delicious skin.We did not get a dessert, but there are two amazing doughnut shops very nearby.

For this year's Father's Day, we decided to take the dads in our family to Gotham to show them a good time, unfortunately, I was very disappointed by the service. I have called and emailed to let them know that we have 11 adults and 6 kids. When we arrived at the restaurant there was only 16 chairs; what surprised me was that the staff was initially not accommodating enough and made us feel that we made a mistake and adding a chair would have been a huge problem. Although at the end they were kind enough to find us a high chair, the cold service at the beginning just set the wrong tone for the dinner experience.While the adults have the three-course prix fixe, we ordered chicken with pasta for the kids and a dish of shrimp cocktail as appetizer for them to share, however, five orders of shrimp cocktail were served. Can three toddlers and two teenagers each finish a serving of shrimp cocktail as appetizer? There may have been some miscommunication so I didn't want to make a fuss about it and to ruin the mood.

3.0,5/31/2016,"Gotham was an underwhelming experience. Didn't suck but didn't impress (and you go to a Michelin place to be impressed right?!)I don't know about you, but when I visit a Michelin star restaurant, there are certain expectations that come with the increased price tag. As such, there were two things that caused this rating: 1) service and 2) seating arrangement.Regarding service - if I have to wave down the waiter at a Michelin rated establishment MULTIPLE times, you get dinged one star. I've been to pricey spots where a member of the staff is in the vicinity at all times. And I can't count how many times I had to flag the guy down for one reason or another during the evening. Several reviewers who have gone there recently have said the same thing on Yelp, so I hope it's not a trend. By the way, the guy was nice...just not attentive at all.Regarding the seating arrangement - when I pay $250+ for two people to eat, I don't want to be close to other patrons. Sorry but I need a little space; the night I went it wasn't empty but it wasn't packed to the brim. Some places have a 'schtick' that revolves around ppl sitting in close proximity...But I don't like those joints and steer clear especially if it's pricey. And yes they did have tables that were more spacious, but clearly I wasn't lucky enough to get one.And I'm sure you're wondering about the food - candidly I was pleased with what I had. For starters I had the shrimp risotto and it was legit. For the main course, I had the 28 day aged steak and it was quite tasty and would recommend it for the meat lovers. I went with golden potatoes instead of the onion rings it came with, and they weren't bad. I tried their halibut also but that was lackluster and don't recommend it. I tried a few cocktails which were infused with bourbon and didn't like either.To sum up - food was good, but you're paying for that AND the experience. And it's the experience that was meh.  Since NYC has like 15+ Michelin establishments I can't see myself going back because it didn't impress. But I wouldn't say don't EVER check it out...just mix my experience with everyone else's and decide if you want to drop that kind of coin.",5,2,2,Justin P.,"Chicago, IL",477,135,11

1.0,4/30/2016,"What happened to you Gotham?!!So I've been here a total of five times. The last two times made me not want to come back ever again. Unfortunately, I brought a friend both times too, especially after raving about this place.The second to last time: we sat down for 20 minutes (I was clocking it) and no one acknowledged us. No waiter, no water, no nothing. We had to flag down someone and our waiter finally came. He was extremely cold and didn't offer to tell us about the wine list, menu, etc. Just stood there staring and asked, ""What would you like"". Our appetizers came out pretty fast, but our entrees came out a total of 40 minutes later. Unacceptable...and we had no bread. So after our entrees finally came, we wanted dessert and just couldn't see our waiter anymore. We flagged down another person and waiting around another 45 minutes, our waiter showed up. Smelling like cigarettes. I kid you not, he went out for a smoke in the middle of his shift. The LAST time (I'm never coming back): I brought my boyfriend here since he was visiting from Chicago, and I told him how it's my favorite restaurant in NYC. So we were all really excited about coming. Then it was almost the same experience -- our waitress came after 20 minutes of just letting us sit there, not even with a menu this time. She did pay a lot of attention, however, to the table of 6 nearby. The table next to us came later than us and apparently ordered the same appetizers. They then mistakenly got our appetizers, and no apologies from our waitress, as well as no appetizers for us. The rest of the dinner was similar to the previous (minus the cigarette-smelling waiter) -- the entire dinner took a total of 3 hours and we ended up almost missing our movie...We couldn't get dessert because the service was horrendously slow.

They do have some flaws in a couple of their servers, in which they look more like they're going through the motions rather than being personable. Aside from the few, most of their servers are fantastic. The sommelier has always picked fantastic wines to pair with all of our dishes. My favorite dishes are the Thai curry lobster, 40 day dry-aged bone-in strip, seared foie gras, trout sashimi, and 28 day dry-aged steak. Their desserts are also outstanding, including the seasonal flavored souffles, Gotham chocolate cake, and the apple tartin.

3.0,3/30/2016,"I found myself here on a Saturday night. Throughout the dinner, the same thought circulated in my head: What am I doing here, I don't belong here.In fact, the good people at Gotham Bar and Grill agreed by tucking me in the high corner table by the kitchen as to not spoil the pristine image of the restaurant. I don't mind them doing it; it gave me an overall perspective of the restaurant's landscape and its rich clientele, rich as in money rich, not diversity.The clientele of the people who dine here are your middle class to upper class citizens. You won't find any goons here, but you will find plenty of schmucks. I saw family dining here for special occasions. I saw friends dining here. I saw a lot of couples on dates. You know everyone who is out on a date here is going to get some tonight. It is very dressy here. There was this one young, blonde, lady who walked in who froze the entire the dining hall. Like Cinderella walking down the grand staircase, this lady captivated everyone's attention. She wore a black dress with white trimmings where both shoulder straps extend down to her navel revealing cleavage and leaving the belly button exposed. It was very revealing, yet still incredibly elegant. Meanwhile, I just wore a short sleeves dress shirt, red khakis, and sneakers. Whatever, man, I am frugal when it comes to clothes, so I can be spend-thrifty with everything else.Robert was our waiter. Robert was spectacular as a waiter. He made us feel at ease, despite us all feeling slightly anxious for being at such an upscale restaurant. For my second, I ordered the curried kabocha squash soup ($20) that came with duck confit. Whenever I imitate someone from Chopped or someone dining at a fancy restaurant, I always imagine ordering duck confit.For my third, coming in, I told myself I would order the item that travel farthest. I asked Robert which item traveled the farthest. He replied if I wanted the moon rocks; unfortunately, they ran out that day. Therefore I had to choose between the black cod from Alaska ($46) or the Dover Sole from the United Kingdom ($65). They are both roughly 3,500 miles away. He told me the dover sole was shipped every morning, never frozen. They both sound good, but the black cod was 19 dollars cheaper, so I went with that.They give complimentary bread. The bread was alright, but the butter was real rich. He gave a soup plate with the duck confit, apple pieces, and pumpkin seeds. I had no idea I ordered a soup, but thought I just ordered duck confit. You could imagine my shock when I saw how little it was, but then he poured in the kettle of soup which instantaneously alleviated my worries. Cool, man. I ate my soup with my eyes closed in a poor attempt to heighten my taste buds. It did not work. The soup definitely tasted good, and was deceptively more than I thought. The waiters colluded to throw down our thirds synchronized to the correct guests. It was a completely unnecessary kind act. The black cod was cooked well. Everything else on the plate was okay, the rice, bok choy, shiitake mushrooms. The sauce was decent. It was good, but I think I would have preferred the dover sole.I forego desserts. My tab was already running high. I paid $90 for my meal, including gratuity. You had to go down a flight of stairs for a bathroom that was mediocre. I don't know why, but I imagined a really nice bathroom with Japanese toilets that wipe your ass for you.It is hard for me to give a restaurant that costs north of $60 a five-star. My palate is not sophisticated enough for this. I grew up as the youngest brother who had to fight for scraps and scarf it down. I never learned how to REALLY TASTE food. It goes in my mouth and out my ass, preferably to a Japanese self-wipe toilet. Sure, the food was good. But then again, I have not found many food that I don't like.When you come to Gotham Bar and Grill, you are paying for a dining experience where all the employees are trained to pay attention to the detail. If you are coming here with a date, you are also paying for post-dinner sex; however, I was not on such a date, therefore I should not have to pay as much.****You have to make a reservation to dine here and call within 48 hours of dining here to confirm your observations; otherwise, you lose $50 a head.

2.0,3/29/2016,"Well thanks for giving us the least desirable table.Maybe we were considered too young (and thus not yet a hedge fund manager) to score a prestigious table in the primary dining room. In any event, we were seated at the table situated next to the hectic kitchen entryway, which is hidden behind a big wall, and you can't admire much of the beautiful restaurant. With the exception of seeing one beautiful couple walk by, with the blonde dressed in a magnificent dress and bright diamonds, we were unable to people watch very well.Alright cool I think that's all I was jaded about. Robert, our server, provided exceptional service. I'm glad we had him because he was really chill about us not being in the 1%.My friends and I ordered the duck soup, some white wine, foie gras, pork chop, NY strip steak, black cod, and chichory salad.Duck soup: my friend indicated that the soup had an inconsistent temperature throughout.White wine (Chardonnay, Santa Barbara--UC *clap clap* SB!): very goodFoie gras (my dish): Eh, it was okay. Robert mentioned that it comes medium rare, and although meat tastes better that way, it didn't work out this time. The sauerkrat and pear compote didn't add to the dish.Pork chop: This was dank. Nice and tender.NY strip steak: Good enoughBlack cod: Good enoughChicory salad (my first course): I think they were trying too hard to make these flavors pop.It was still a nice experience, so thanks :)My tab came out to $90 with tip.",5,4,4,Jerry B.,"Laytonsville, MD",378,424,188

There are only 2 setbacks. 1, they only have 2 ladies bathroom stalls so you will most likely find yourself waiting in line. 2, the bread was hard and cold. bf and I had:- 3 glasses of wine. The cab blend is on point. Bordeaux is great with the lamb!- oysters (great, but I would pass unless you are craving for it)- hamachi sashimi (delicious but didn't stand out)- foie gras is the star of the evening. The best I've had. Will be back for this dish! - rack of lamb medium rare (REALLY GOOD) you're in for a treat if you like lamb. It's a pretty big portion too. - dry aged steak was cooked perfectly medium rare as well. Didn't need the onion rings, the mashed potatoes on my lamb entree was better. - Gotham chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream is actually heavier than i thought it would be but it was excellent. Not the texture I was expecting, but delicious! We also had espresso shots and complimentary mini cakes. The price came out to be 350ish including tip.

Really beautifully plated and the seasoning was perfect. It was extremely fresh and all the seafoods were perfectly cooked. (especially with octopus!!)  Very well seasoned and I really liked the tanginess of freshly squeezed lemon. Their foie gras was okay. It had mushroom and I believe bites of chickpeas inside. The taste itself wasn't amazing but the plating was wonderfully done. For the second, I tried black cod with miso dressing and Ravioli. Black cod was really interesting.

1.0,3/15/2016,"As can be seen from my prior review, I think the food and dining experience at Gotham is amazing.  I love it.  This review is solely based on the disrespectful treatment I received from the maitre d'/man and woman charged with seating customers on or about February 13, 2016.  I attempted to purchase chocolates for Valentine's Day per an email that I received from the restaurant.  It was about 5:45 so I didn't think it would be crowded, and it wasn't.  There was a man and a woman standing behind a podium receiving dinner guests.  I told them that I wanted to buy a box of chocolates and asked for the 9 piece version.  The woman said she would get it for me.  I waited for at least twenty minutes.  There were times when they were seating guests, and I understood that they could not assist me in those moments, but there were times when they were just standing there, yet still not helping me.  I felt like an idiot.  I stood there, waiting for nothing, as it was clear that neither the man or woman had any intention of helping me.  They didn't apologize for the wait, nor give me any update.  I would love to buy the chocolates advertised in the emails I receive, but it is not worth the time or embarrassment of being forced to stand stupidly waiting.  I am also turned off from dining at the restaurant again due to the obnoxious service.  I am writing this in the hopes that it will be passed on to management and so that this doesn't happen to anyone else.",1,1,0,Marissa S.,"Manhattan, NY",17,267,285

2.0,3/13/2016,"Does this establishment really have a Michelin star?My fiance and I love fine dining. We have eaten at places like Daniel and Del Posto. For some reason, I thought that this would be in the same league, but boy was I wrong. The price tag will make you think that it would be, though. We haven't gone out to a nice dinner in a while (we are saving up for our wedding so we have had to scale back), so we were very excited for a nice night out of good food and service and our expectations were extremely high.I put on my reservation on Open Table that it was my fiance's birthday. I also called and asked if they could put special candles on the dessert when it came out. The lady on the phone said it would be fine and they could do anything, and the maitre'd seemed excited when I handed them off to her as we walked in. Our waiter was very inattentive. We had menus for about 20 minutes before we ordered.The food was good. We started out with the oysters. One of mine had a shell in it that I had to spit out but I figured it was an oversight after shucking many in the back. I got the Maestro 75 as a cocktail and it was very good. My fiance's wine and cocktail were great as well. I got the seafood risotto as first course and it was delicious. Then I had the lobster and braised short rib as a main course, and it was also very good. The portions are good and are not skimpy.In between meals, nobody really checked on us when it came to our food. There were many crumbs on the table and nobody cared to clean them up. My glass of water went all the way down to the bottom before somebody refilled it. There really was no attention to detail. The service was more like that of a diner than an established restaurant.We ordered dessert and got the souffle and Gotham chocolate cake. When they arrived they did not have the candles on that I called about and spoke to the maitre'd about. I was visibly pissed and kind of took it out on the poor bus boy who was working very hard. Our waiter was nowhere to be found at this point. Bus boys served us more than the ""waiter"" that we had. They eventually came out with whip cream and the candles and three chocolates. How nice of them *rolls eyes*. They comped the desserts and apologized (I believe it was a manager that came up to us, it wasn't the waiter that apologized), but even after that the dinner came to $361 dollars. As our waiter gave us the bill he apologized for the candle situation. Otherwise we were ignored. Of course he would apologize since it's time for us to tip. Where were you the rest of the night?Very disappointing after saving up for a nice night out. When you spend this kind of money you expect service to be perfect. This establishment is obviously getting by due to accolades from 20 years ago. I will not be back and I do not recommend others to spend their money at this establishment. The owner should come to his restaurant and see how it is functioning.This is no Per Se, but I would love to see them get a scathing review in the NYT just as Per Se did.

3.0,3/12/2016,"We went for an early dinner while our kids were at a concert nearby.  I had checked it out on the way and I found that the menu hasn't changed much in the last 8-10yrs. (That's as far back as the pictures went) it got really great reviews so we went anyway. The restaurant itself is simply decorated but feels comfortable and timeless. It was louder than I expected considering the very high ceilings, I felt like I had to lean in to hold a conversation and speak louder than seemed appropriate. My first course was a tellegio ravioli, it was delicious. My husband got the tuna tartare which looked exactly the same as in the 8 year old pictures I saw. For my entree I chose the NY Steak, it was good, not great, just good. My husband got the duck which he said was good. We finished with dessert, we got the ""famous"" chocolate cake and a peanut butter/chocolate something. They were both good, not great. My wine was refilled consistently but my husband had to ask for a second cocktail. I should expect in a place of this caliber we really shouldn't have to ASK for anything. When we were done, it took what seemed like an eternity to get our waiters attention to get the check. So 2 apps, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, 1 bottle of wine and 2 cocktails plus gratuity came to a little over $450. My advice, save yourself a bill or two and go across the street to the Strip house. The steak was much better, the service more attentive and not quite as pricey.  My advice to GBG: stop resting on your 20 year old laurels and come up with some new ideas, your restaurant is as stale and flavorless as your bread.",0,0,0,Alicia M.,"New Milford, NJ",0,4,0

1.0,3/6/2016,"If you've been keeping up with my reviews, you know that I generally dislike handing out a 1 star review as it means that I wasted both time AND money.  The money isn't so much the issue as that can be recuperated or regenerated.  It is purely the loss of time that I cannot regain.  I went there last night for a dinner for 4 people. Having been to arguably one of the best restaurants at eleven Madison park the night prior, Gotham had its work cut out to prove that it is deserving the sole star that it has accrued.It failed.The food was enjoyable- and that is the unfortunate reality. When you lose points in my mind because of service- that is deplorable.My girlfriend had finished one of her two lamb chops and asked for the other to go.  We made this very clear when the bus boy asked us if we wanted one or two boxes to go and we indicated that we wanted three. One for each of the three patrons who had not concluded their meals. This seemed like a fairly simple request. Why he mustered a look of bewilderment is beyond me. He returned with two boxes. We then asked our server when she came by again for a third box for my girlfriend's meal. She whisked away the food after acknowledging our request and ... Threw out the food.Neither the server or bus boy would take responsibility for the act.  The server offered us some chocolate as if to say sorry. We sat there without eating it. Only then did they bring out a half order of lamb in a to go bag- and delivered it with such angst. Nothing about the interaction was enjoyable. They made it feel as if WE had done something inappropriate.  I was floored by the service, or lack thereof. The appropriate response would have been to incorporate management at this time and not hide behind the mistakes. That level of professionalism was not afforded us at this meal.This place is subpar. For spending 600 dollars for four people, I'd rather spend 1600 for four at eleven Madison, a restaurant deserving of every penny that meal cost.  Save your money and go somewhere that is deserving of a Michelin star.  Based on service alone, this place should have its star revoked.

I took my daughter and wife there to celebrate a special occasion. It is very rare that I find a restaurant where everything it spot on, but guess what, this is the real deal. After  the staff brought around a variety of breads to try we decided to try the Wild mushroom and foie grass terrine as our First. This was awesome, especially with the wine that our waitress helped us select. We didn't want to overdue it, so we skipped the Second and went directly to the Third. My wife selected the Duck, which other reviewers had raved about. No fooling, this is an amazing dish. I have not Duck prepared anywhere else that exceeded the taste and presentation of this dish. My daughter and I could not resist the 28 day dry aged New York steak. Once again, the flavor and presentation were outstanding. I wish i could remember the name of the chocolate dessert we shared as it was remarkable. Too often we dine at a high end restaurant and something just doesn't hit the sweet spot.

Halibut and Lamb chops for Main course. Gotham chocolate cake and elderflower porfait  for dessert. Both appetizers were reAlly good. Halibut was better then the chops imo and I was not the fan of their famous Gotham cake but the porfait was yammi. I was a bit surprised that a Michelin restaurant would serve cold bread, no freebie courses, and no specials or something from the kitchen to acknowledge that this was Valrntine Day. There was live music, but the ambiance didn't feel right, maybe because of how they have their tables arrangement, just didn't feel very romantic or cozy. The service was a bit off as well, perhaps because there were too many people and servers seemed disoriented.

Spacious for a NYC spot, and I must say that Gotham is one of the most elegant restaurants I've been to. On to the food. Started with the Mushroom Salad. The presence of the mushroom flavor was pleasantly strong, although the salad didn't blow me away. Also tried my friend's Curried Pumpkin Soup, which was sweet but balanced with a perfect tang. For entree, I got the black rice noodles served with a lemongrass curry sauce. The curry also had great tangy flavor, it was just a bit too soupy for my preference. I tried my friend's Crispy Chicken and whoa. . . simple but remarkable. Should have stolen more from his plate. For dessert I got the Brown Butter Parfait, and my friend got the infamous Gotham Chocolate Cake. I know that everyone's been lovin' that chocolate cake down, but I didn't feel it (the luscious salted almond ice cream stole the show, for this one). It was definitely interesting - it was almost mousse-like, but at the same time, it had this powdery consistency, seeming to crumble in your mouth. It was intensely chocolatey. My friend, who did admit that he wasn't a huge fan of fancy food, commented that it tasted like ""Nestle chocolate powder."" A bit harsh, in my opinion. On the other hand, my artistic Brown Butter Parfait was amazing. Subtle, and not overly sweet, allowing the flavors to meld seamlessly. The pear was an unexpected but delightful dimension.

One fine day, stars aligned and I found that this Michelin Star restaurant was participating in NYC Restaurant week. I made reservations faster than me going through my empty refrigerator.

The staff is courteous and attentive and service is seamless once you've decided your order.For the first course, I had the curried pumpkin soup while my friend had the mushroom salad. I think the pumpkin soup surprised me because of its mild flavor, but it grew on to me. The mushroom salad was pretty good, crunchy greens, cheese and mushrooms with white balsamic vinegar. For the second course, we both had the black rice noodles. I also had Bok Choy, which is chinese cabbage for the first time and discovered I'm not a fan. Out of the three courses, this was probably my least favorite. For dessert, my friend had the Gotham chocolate cake while I ordered assorted sorbets. The cake was gooey chocolatey deliciousness packed in a slice. One of the best chocolate cakes I've had in a restaurant so far.

So when I went to Gotham to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday, I was under the assumption that I'd get the same extraordinary service that I received from the upscale restaurants I've visited in the past. Sadly, I was actually disappointed with this place.Now don't get me wrong - the food was just absolutely terrific! I got the tuna tartare, which was just heavenly. The seafood risotto was hands down my favorite part of the entire meal - so full of flavor, it was just perfect. My main entree was the lobster and short rib, which was wonderful - lobster was perfectly cooked and short rib was so tender that it ripped right off of my fork.The food wasn't the problem, but the service was the part I was not impressed with. After finishing our second course, the third course took over 30 minutes to arrive, which was a lot longer than I expected. During the wait, our waiter never came by to let us know why it was delayed. On that note, our waiter wasn't really as attentive with us as I would've liked. It took about 25 mins between the time we first got seated to the time he finally took our orders.As it was my boyfriend's birthday, I thought I had noted in the reservation as such - and was a little surprised that I was still issued a dessert menu. Usually in many other restaurants that have a special occasion noted in the reservation, dessert would come as a freebie honoring that occasion. Our waiter took back the menus after we declined, and after another 10 mins, as if it was an afterthought, one of the busboys came by to our table with a little cup of mini cakes with a lit candle...and what a sad little cup of mini cakes it was! I saw on Yelp that many people got chocolate cakes and other legit desserts for their birthdays, so I was kind of surprised, and a little sad to have gotten this instead, which I believe every table got at the end of their meals anyway...Anyway, the decor was great, and I really appreciated that they honored my note in the reservation to give us secluded seating, but the quality of service was just lackluster.",6,1,0,Tashnuva E.,"Queens, Queens, NY",273,551,126
4.0,1/30/2016,"Come during restaurant week. I don't usually go with RW because the food is always not signature or good and turns out to be a waste. But I heard so many good reviews and things about this restaurant, so we decided to give it a try. It's definitely a great deal for $25. My friend is like three courses cost 25 while a glass of juice costs 5. Back to food, for the appetizer, please get the kale mushroom salad! It's the best salad I ever had. It may have a little bit more vinegar, but it's fine and tasty. My friend's salmon is just okay. For the entree, we get the fish. It's alright, nothing much to comment on. Maybe we should get the steak that's ppl are raving about instead? For the dessert, I of course get the chocolate cake. To be honest, it's not as good as ppl talk about. SPOT is wayyyu better. I don't even finish mine because it's below average. The almond vanilla ice cream tastes pretty good though. My friend gets parfait, this size is mini.Anyways, it's not as good as other reviews described. I still confirm that resultant week is kinda of waste. But for the price, I can't say more.

4.0,1/29/2016,Restaurant week lunch. 4 stars based on my Michelin standard.Bread-very good. Warm and fresh. Crispy on the outside and chewy inside. Good quality of butter.House cured salmon-good. Well marinated salmon slices that has multilayered flavor. A little salty. Really thin slices of radish. The freekeh feels completely irrelevant to the dish. Hard and almost tasteless. Great lemon confit. Interesting smoky eggplant that hardly tastes like eggplant.Curried pumpkin soup-very good. Smooth and thick. Multilayered flavor. Mild level of sweetness and spice.Nova Scotia halibut-average. Fresh halibut. Lacks tenderness. Well cooked vegetables. Mild potato purée. The white wine verjus sauce is too sour for me.New York strip steak-very good. Great quality of steak. Well cooked on the outside and medium rare in the middle. Tender and juicy. Good taste of red wine reduction.Gotham chocolate cake-delicious. The best chocolate cake I have ever had. Rich black chocolate flavor. Moist and smooth. Small scoop of salted almond ice cream on top of soil-like nutty chocolate. Some black chocolate sauce on the side.Brown butter parfait-good. High quality of ice cream.Good food presentation. Average service at the bar. Excellent ambience. But I had higher expectations for the food.,1,0,0,Susan X.,"Claremont, CA",5,369,152

5.0,1/29/2016,"This is probably my favorite restaurant in New York City so far.  From the moment we sat down, everything was great from the beautiful decor to the friendly service that was on top of their fans from the beginning. We came during restaurant week and still walked away with a hefty bill. We couldn't walk away from the steak upgrade (worth $10) and thanks to the $18 cocktails we spent more on alcohol than food!The appetizers we had salad with the most amazing marinated mushrooms I've ever had. They could have served us a bowl of mushrooms and I would have been content. We also shared the house smoked salmon. This was food enough on its own but the smoked eggplant sauce was to die for. I will forever be experimenting in my kitchen as I strive to replicate it. Entrees were halibut and steak. Both were very good. I love halibut though all the time. To be honest, as good as the food was it was the least memorable part of dinner.Then desert came. People aren't lying about the cake. Seriously. My wife who has the sweet tooth and bakes prolifically said it's the best cake she ever had. I concur. I did not know a cake could be that moist. And the accoutrements! The cocoa powder, the dark chocolate sauce. It was heaven. The other desert was actually pretty good too just over shadowed.And the drinks. Yes, they are expensive. They have to maintain that beautifully stocked bar at the front. I had the barrel aged old fashioned. It was great. Definitely worth it. I also had a cranberry bourbon drink that had just a touch of cranberry flavor. Also very good. My wife had a cider drink which was not my thing (too sweet) but she loved it. I wouldn't mind trying the bourbon infused smore one day.I WILL be coming back despite the price tag. And if I need to save money I'll be happy coming to lunch or sitting at the bar (again, it's very pretty) and splitting a burger, the cake, and a drink.",2,1,1,Michael M.,"New York, NY",209,464,1020

I figured I'd sneak in during restaurant week.It was pretty crowded with walk-ins when we got there, but we got shown to a corner booth/table right away. Service was a bit shaky at first (servers fumbling the water and a couple plates). Our waitress was very friendly and helpful and did refill my coffee various times. I got the house cured salmon salad to start, which was pretty good. The smoked salmon wasn't as chewy as I'm used to; it was a bit, doughier? That's the best way I can describe it. But it was sweet and the salad had some good flavor.I got the NY steak for $12 more (the website says it's a $10 supplemental cost, but I believe they actually tacked on $12), and my medium rare was pretty good. It definitely had the texture of a NY steak. The red wine sauce was okay, and I did enjoy the vegetables and mashed potato smear on the plate.The chocolate cake for dessert was a bit too pillowy and mousse-y for me.

5.0,1/20/2016,"I always laugh when people say there are ""Power People"" eating lunch at the Gotham Bar and Grill and you'll need reservations six months in advance. Shaddup!It's a Michelin star restaurant true, no reason to slip anyone $20. There are plenty of reservations available. I had my reservation today and I got to the restaurant first, my party was still on the subway. I asked the host stand if I could be seated and was told I need to wait until my party was all together. Kind of annoying but not a problem. While waiting, I'm surveying the room. What a beautiful looking space! The bar is large and the main dining room is well laid out to accommodate both large and small tables.Once seated, from the white linen tablecloths to the crystal glasses, this is a very elegant spot. I think we're the last open table, a full restaurant should be slamming the kitchen. And this is where Gotham Bar and Grill shines. This place is a well oiled machine, Michelin star in the house!I started with the three course lunch. I've been reading about this place for years and my tongue has been hanging out for the wild mushroom risotto with white truffles. I've been thinking about it all morning. Man, I can't wait to get into those white truffles. No such luck today. Oh well, I'll have to plan out another time when its on menu. I have to start talking about the famous Gotham chocolate cake. It's a flourless cake, its almost a mousse. Very rich and decadent. It was served warm with salted almond ice cream. This cake today affirmed there is a higher power. It's so intensely delicious, someone had to have divine intervention when creating this masterpiece.I started with house cured salmon, this was a simple dish but still very elegant in its presentation. Great tasting, an excellent starter.My main entree was Nova Scotia Halibut. I thought it was simple, I really wanted to be wowed. It came with kale and potato purée, it was a good dish but it didn't leave me looking up to the heavens saying thank you like the flourless chocolate cake.Gotham, it was a pleasure to dine in your establishment today.

As you walk in you are greeted with very friendly staff, a complementary coat check which was convenient, and we were quickly seated despite arriving slightly ahead of our reservation time. Our waitress however was not nearly as friendly, which could have been due to the added rush of people coming in for restaurant week. FOOD- mushroom salad: favorite course of the meal! Delicious dressing, mix of arugula and roasted hazelnuts was a nice combination- halibut entree: fish was nicely cooked, broth was so flavorful and complemented the halibut- brown butter parfait: deconstructed parfait, was not a fan of the accompanying sorbet on the side or the apples and the mousse itself was underwhelmingThis was the first Michelin star restaurant I have been to and I have to say I was underwhelmed.

Roasted cauliflower (the perfect winter side), and the taleggio raviolis (what dreams are made of). The first course was so delicious.

Unfortunately this is where it took a slight turn for the worse. Just as we were giving our order the restaurant became feverishly busy with 5 deep at the bar and a full to the brim dining room. This in turned spelled a little bit of doom going further. The apps came out in a fair amount of time although was disappointed with the taleggio veal ravioli as far as portion $26 for 5 thumb size ravioli, flavor was excellent tho. Our drinks were not arriving but I realized the bar was a nightmare and our server was a bit stressed although exceedingly polite and we were patient. 2 of our party ordered the Niman Ranch cote de boeuf for 2 which was delicious but took forever to arrive and was luke warm at best. At $195 you would prefer it sizzling or at least hot. The $56 surf and turf which was beef short rib and lobster was delicious but again surprisingly tiny for the usual Gotham portion sizes.

2.0,12/16/2015,"My experience at Gotham Bar and Grill was very underwhelming. Having dined at several 1-michelin star restaurants, I expected more and better. I made a reservation about 2 weeks in advance, for a party of 5. For many of my friends, this was their first time in NYC. I hope Gotham Bar and Grill would be a quintessential lunch/brunch experience in the city. Although the price of the lunch prix fix ($36) was attractive, I preferred their la carte menu instead, which two of my friends opted for. While the food tasted good, the entrees and appetizers were neither spectacular or interesting. Also note, that the portions for prix fix were small. I had the bass sashimi (starter), poussin (entree), and vanilla parfait. My friends got the gotham chicory salad (starter), pan-seared halibut (the better of the entrees) and mezzi rigatoni (entree). Two other friends opted to order a la carte: beet salad (starter), mushroom and foie gras terrine (starter), seafood risotto (entree), gotham burger (entree). While the bass sashimi was good, I seriously wished there was more than 3 meager slices. The poussin legs was cooked well, but I was disappointed that the breast meat was tougher than something I make at home. I have to say that my favorite entree was the gotham burger. The fries were perfectly salted and the burger meat was pretty good (although, I would have much rather paid $10 more for Minetta Tavern's Black Label Burger). Seafood risotto was average as well. Mezzi Rigatoni had well made pasta but the ragu was mediocre and portion was smaller than all the entrees for prix fix.Overall, I did not enjoy Gotham's food as much as I had wanted to. I appreciated the complimentary coat check, however the dining service was below average. It took about 3 hours to dine here with 30 minute gaps between each dish. I really expected faster and better service. It took another 30 minutes for us to get our check and leave. Maybe their dinner service is better. But I really saw no passion from the chef's mind during the lunch service. Knowing this now, I would much rather preferred taking my friends to Norma (lesser yelp stars, but trust me on this one) for a quintessential New York brunch.

We all had 1 drink, the risotto or lobster appetizer. We then had either the beef rib or coq au vin, main course. One person had the steak. Ok--the food was good. The risotto was excellent. THE PROBLEM IS the portions were simply too small. I wear a size 2-4. I am by no means a big eater! However, our bill totaled almost $500, $$550, with tip. When I left, I was actually STILL HUNGRY. It is RIDICULOUS to pay $125 for a small dinner, even at Gotham, and still be hungry.

This place is good for groups.  Service was excellent although they took a while for getting our bottle of wine.  I don't know, it may have been in a vault downstairs.  But other than that, all was great.

Gave me good information about the dishes and how much I should order since it was my first time there. Food was great, ordered all the classics, Tuna Tartare, Seafood Salad, Foie Gras, Miso Black Cod, 28 day dry aged Strip. Everything was cooked to perfection and quality was as expected. The chocolate cake at the end for our dessert was arguably the best I've had.Little things with this place. The bread could be much better, at least a bit warm. I rather not be served bread at all than be given cold bread. I expected more from a Michelin Star restaurant. I know it isn't a big deal, but if that's going to be part of the dinner, why not?When I was about to leave, the manager talked to me as if I was mentally challenged or something.

5.0,11/29/2015,"We came here for the Greenmarket menu. We ordered the following:1. Gotham Chicory Salad: frisbee, trevisano, toasted pistachio, mango, shaved pecorino pepato, white balsamic vinaigrette.      - This was refreshing, simple, with just the right amount of dressing to not overpower the other ingredients 2. Curried Kabocha Squash Soup: green apple, toasted pumpkin seeds lemon yogurt.      - I really enjoyed this soup. I preferred this over the salad as a first course. This isn't because it was sooo cold outside. I really loved the complexity and smoothness of the soup. You didn't taste curry in your mouth after, just while enjoying it. It was perfect.3. Pan Seared Halibut: romanesco cauliflower, shiitake mushrooms basil puree, versus emulsion.      - It was perfectly seared at the top and nice and tender in the middle, like a nice juicy piece of fish steak. I would choose the short rib rigatoni over this however. The halibut is a great choice if you want to have something ""lighter""4. Mezzo Rigatoni: short rib ragu, basil, sheep's milk ricotta, parmigiano reggiano.      - Can I get another order of this? Tender short rib with milk ricotta ... oh myyy5. Vanilla Parfait: coconut dacquoise, passion fruit cream, mango coconut sorbet     - The ingredients came beautifully together. The tang of the passion fruit was offset by the coconut. 6. Gotham Chocolate Cake: served warm with salted almond ice cream     - The cake was so moist! The salty ice cream was interesting... it was all quite nice and decadent6. Assorted Sorbets: raspberry, pear, apricot     - You can never have too much ice cream or sorbet. I would order the parfait and chocolate cake over this. Then head over to Grom for gelato.By the way, whatever they do to make that bread, it was so buttery, salty and good. This is coming from someone who normally doesn't inhale bread.

From the moment you walk into this large and beautiful restaurant, you just know that you are destined to have a fine dining experience. I had a terrific lunch at Gotham during restaurant week with a couple of co-workers. For my three restaurant week courses ($25), I ordered the Wild Striped Bass Crudo, Pan Seared Halibut, and Gotham Chocolate Cake. Their food seems simple, but all the unique ingredients offer a complexity in the taste and it all comes together in a beautiful presentation.  The Crudo and Halibut were fresh and moist - it almost melted in my mouth. Their infamous chocolate cake was delicious and the salted caramel ice cream was the perfect complement and most interesting element. The dessert was presented like a cake but the consistency and taste was more like a chocolate mousse. The ambiance is great and the service was attentive, but not overbearing.

After telling them I had a reservation, the host and hostess welcomed me as if I were a society matron from the Upper East Side. It's nice to feel special.A man came around with complimentary bread, and I had two pieces over the course of my meal. Pretty good, but hey, it's just bread. The Gotham burger ($19) was super rich. I couldn't eat dessert after and that says a lot since I typically have room for dessert. And I don't even like truffles but the truffle cheese was excellent. It's a simple burger, devoid of lettuce and tomato. The bun was grilled which was a nice touch. The patty was incredibly juicy and soft. Yum! It was a little rarer than I expected/wanted but I survived. The fries and picked veggies were a great complement as well.The bathrooms were downstairs.

4.0,9/6/2015,"**Bar review only. The menu has VERY few options for vegetarians so we ate somewhere else and came here for a nightcap afterwards***. Manages to have both an old-world and a modern feel, both opulent and warm. We came here for a drink at the bar while waiting for our table at a popular speakeasy nearby. Things were already winding down at 11 pm on a Sat night and we were warned that last call was soon approaching. The bartender was an older gentleman in a classic suit vest. First thing he told us when we sat down at the bar was that they were no longer serving a drink that was on the cocktail menu. When I asked why, making conversation, he stiffly answered ""because we aren't"". That was a bit off putting, but I realized as the night wore on that his formality adds to the allure of this place. No doubt, he has been working here for years, a professional career-barman dedicated to the craft of serving the perfect cocktail. Suddenly, I was transported to a cruise ship in 1890s London. (And not everyone that works here is stiff. The bar back was very friendly). We ordered a drink that was not on the cocktail menu (French 75) and the barkeep knew how to make it and even recommended that Beefeater would be the best type of gin for it. He measured the pours swiftly and precisely, accommodating each of our individual tastes (one in our party wanted less gin and more champagne, another wanted a different type of gin altogether). My cocktail was perfectly balanced. The bitterness of the Beefeater perfectly cut through the sweetness of the champagne and simple syrup. The sourness of the lemon rounded out the back end. Sometimes less accomplished 'tenders can turn this drink into something more akin to a sugary lemon soda. I took a sip of the drink of the person who had insisted on having hers with Hendricks, and while I usually prefer Hendricks as well, it was too smooth and didn't stand up as well as the Beefeater.

It was cooked perfectly and was one of the most tender pieces of fish I have tried.For my main I had the grilled branzino. The fish was cooked well and its skin crispy. But the vegetable components were the true star of the show. Baby carrots, escarole and fingerlings - everything was tender and worked miraculously well together.For dessert we shared chocolate cake, vanilla + chocolate ice cream + apricot sorbet, and cheesecake. My favorite was the chocolate cake. It tasted like a fluffier brownie with almond ice cream on the side. Least favorite was the cheesecake, which had an overpowering taste of ginger.

While many people say not to judge a place solely on Restaurant Week, if a restaurant is THAT different from their lowest quality to their highest quality, I think it speaks volumes as a whole about the restaurant.Appetizers: Gazpachos are so familiar on NYRW summer menus, as they are inexpensive to make (in large orders) and good for the heat. So I wasn't too keen on it, but it was actually perfect! Tangy, slightly hearty with the tomatoes, and refreshing for the summer heat! The crudo, on the other hand, was a disappointment.Entrees: I got the tagliatelle - while it was a small portion, it was delicious. The broccoli rabe's bitterness accompanied the tomato sauce really well and balanced the whole plate out. The chicken was good, but nothing to write home about.Dessert: The blueberry creameux was good, but the chocolate cake was AMAZING. While rich and decadent, it still had you wanting more and more.

The watermelon pieces make this dish quite refreshing. 9.9/10.Pan Seared Halibut: Fresh and not fishy tasting at all. Flavor was great, but thought the fish was a little too bit on the dry side. The sauce had an earthy taste. Quite interesting. 7.3/10.Tagliatelle: I loved it. It was in a tomato based sauce. It was quite creamy as if one used butter in their cooking. The broccoli rabe was great. 8.5/10.Blueberry Creameux: My boyfriend ordered this. It wouldn't be fair for me to review this dish because I'm one who dislikes blueberries. My berry lover boyfriend likes this dish a lot. Actually, like is an understatement. LOVE. He rates this a 9.9/10. Assorted Sorbets: Probably my least favorite dish, but still not a bad choice.

For the final course we both got Gotham's famous chocolate cake. This was my first time having this little gem, although I've heard much about it over the years. At first glance this little slice of cake is quite unassuming, it even appears as if it would be dry. Take your first bite however and you instantly appreciate what all the fuss is about - the cake somehow dissolves into velvety heaven in your mouth. It's texture on your fork is boring, in your mouth it's transcendent, taking on the the feel of a chocolate molten lava cake. The taste of chocolate is so intensely concentrated, it almost has a hint of coffee.

The wild striped bass crudo made me want sashimi.  It was ""different"" but not mind blowing (not really a fan of the texture of bass).For seconds, the tagliatelle was subpar because it was overcooked and fell apart in your mouth (a Michelin star restaurant and not al dente?!).  The poussin was a bit salty outside and bland inside and still had some of the raw chicken taste.Lastly for dessert, the chocolate cake (sweet enough to give you diabetes) was more like chocolate mousse with too salty almond ice cream.  At least my lunch ended on a better note with the blueberry cremeux.

I was looking to go upscale and dressy to celebrate our wedding anniversary for a night in NYC without kids.  We wanted to feel like aristocrats and since we are binge watching Downton Abbey right now, why not go all out.  Gotham delivered! Jacket is not required which is totally fine because even though we were looking for upscale and dressy I didn't want to lug and wear a jacket in August.  We were greeted warmly by the hostess and taken to a great table for two which was almost secluded but still had a good view of NYC's elite.  Our waiter, Chip was engaging, knowledgeable, but also low key and very professional.  He helped us through their wonderfully diverse menu, as we started off with a half bottle of champagne. We decided on the shrimp cocktail to start along with tomato, peach and mozzarella salad.  I know you're thinking, what's so special about shrimp cocktail but the dipping options were excellent and shrimp very good.  After the 1st course, we shared a seafood salad, great assortment of fruits of the sea, topped off with some caviar, and avocado.  Delicious! The entrees were superb.  I had the steak prepared wonderfully with a Dijon mustard custard in the side and onion rings, yes onion rings but so flavorful.  My wife had Maine Lobster taken out of the shell on a potato purée. All the while, Chip and other servers were on task but not overbearing. Somehow we had a little room for dessert.  We chose the Key Lime Tart for 2 with a chilled yogurt on the side.  The tart and yogurt were a perfect combination.  The dessert was still too large to finish.

3.0,8/8/2015,"Amazing food. Subpar service.I came for Restaurant Week 2015 with a group of five other ladies and order the wild striped bass crudo, tagliatelle, and blueberry cremeux. The crudo was nice and light, but could use a little bit more flavor in the dish. Tagliatelle was delicious, creamy and quite filling. I was afraid the dessert would be too sour, but it was the right amount of tartness and the ice cream accompanying it meshed very well with the overall flavor.I would've otherwise given Gotham Bar & Grill four stars if not for the service, for which I deducted one star. Near the end of the meal, our waiter gave us the bill before the entire table could finish our dessert, and while gathering up the money (we were paying for our own separate food), he came to the table and said ""27.22"". I initially didn't know what that meant, but my friend mentioned that it was the individual price of the restaurant week meal, with tax. I personally found that really rude to instruct guests how much the meal costs; we could've easily calculated it based on our bill, and we certainly did not welcome it. When I expressed my displeasure with our waiter's behavior with the rest of the ladies that I was dining with, I discovered that our waiter was apparently giving us an attitude from the very beginning; I didn't notice it, but our waiter apparently rolled his eyes as he walked away from our table after one of us asked if any of the dishes had vinegar in it. For the Michelin star restaurant, I expected more.",0,0,0,Amanda W.,"Brooklyn, NY",122,5,0

3.0,8/6/2015,"(Restaurant Week Summer 2015 lunch)I came here with a large group to try the Restaurant Week lunch menu. The menu looked promising online but fell just short of my expectations in execution. For my three courses, I opted for the Wild Striped Bass Crudo, Pan Seared Halibut, and Blueberry Crémeux. They started us off with small rolls and butter, pretty standard for a New American restaurant. The crudo was arranged beautifully and had really wonderful notes from the watermelon, lime, and avocado, but I would have liked some more textural variation to combat the softness of the fish. I think I am generally more of a ceviche or sashimi than crudo fan. The halibut was again plated nicely but too dry. I also couldn't taste the smoked eggplant and basil purée components. Overall, it just wasn't an interesting or well-prepared dish. Our desserts took the longest to come out and interrupted what had so far been smooth transitions between each course. My blueberry crémeux looked enticing and tasted almost as good. There were plenty of fresh blueberries, and the gel-like dessert was lighter than what I usually order. My favorite part was the corn ice cream, which I preferred over the sugary crémeux. I also tried some of the chocolate cake. It was fudgy and reminded me of melted chocolate. Compared to the crémeux, the cake felt more decadent, and I almost wished I had ordered it instead. The space is a picturesque, classic American dining room with tall windows and ceilings. I was taken aback when I went to use the bathroom downstairs and found myself in an outdated stall with used paper towels crumpled on the floor. I understand that it was Restaurant Week and the staff was dealing with more foot traffic than usual, but even the bathrooms matter when you dine at a restaurant of this caliber. Combined with my disappointing halibut entrée, I would say that Gotham Bar and Grill lags behind newer, more innovative restaurants in its price range.",4,0,1,C C.,"Los Angeles, CA",108,194,203

They made sure there were no stray splashes on the plate before serving us and they came in from the left side each time. Each course came out shortly after we finished and they were always around without being overbearing. I had the tomato gazpacho and my boyfriend had the bass crudo. Both were divine and lovely for a hot summer afternoon. The flavors really came out and complimented each other. The main course was beautifully presented. I got the halibut while my boyfriend got the poussin (chicken). Again the flavors came together so well. Dessert is the best course and here I got the blueberry cremeux and my boyfriend got the chocolate cake. Who knew polenta could be used in a dessert? It worked really well with my blueberry and sweet corn ice cream since it was light enough. The chocolate cake was so light and melts in your mouth.

5.0,7/23/2015,"As I was coming into the place, I saw the Zagat rating and was amazed. 28 for food, 27 for both service and decor. ""Wow, this place must be really good,"" I said to myself. And I'm very glad that what I said to myself was true. First of all, let's start off with the food. The menu was divided into four sections- Weekly specials, ""First,"" ""Second,"" and ""Third."" We were told by our waiter that it would be best to order a dish from each section. I hoped that those dishes wouldn't be overwhelming, because I wanted to save my tummy for the entree. And they weren't. I ordered the shrimp cocktail as my first dish, and it was decent and could have been better. The shrimps were served cold and fresh along with nice, freshly cut lemons and sauce. Overall, I was very satisfied with the shrimps but one thing that could have made them more tasty would be them being a little bit bigger. The second dish I had was the Ora King Salmon. Unlike the shrimps, the salmon was not served very fresh and cold. I was able to find dry stains, which I did not like. I would not recommend the salmon at this restaurant. Now, the entree. Simply put, I struck gold today. Gotham offered a 45-day dry aged steak today on its weekly specials menu, and I fell in love with it. The steak was very big and juicy and I savoured every single bite. I would recommend this dish to anyone who is planning to go to Gotham, but the only thing that would make them hesitant is the price. The steak was priced at a juicy, fat price of 100 dollars. Anybody would think: ""Why would anybody spend a Benjamin Franklin for steak?"" Yes, I agree on that point that not many people would want to spend one of the Founding Fathers of America on steaks. But the 45-day dry aged steak justifies the price. I totally recommend the dish to anyone who wants the ultimate meat-bitin' and swallowin' experience, only if it is on the menu of course. One thing though, it is a very heavy meal so be prepared to feel the post-dining experience which makes you not being able to walk properly. I feel like me loving this restaurant also had to do with luck, because they offered a Key Lime Pie, which is my favorite dessert, on their weekly specials dessert menu. I was disappointed when I did not opened the menu to see that it wasn't there. However, I found myself forming a big grin on the face when the waiter told me they had the pie in the weekly specials menu, which was unlisted. I was very happy that they had my favorite dessert and the pie itself was great of course. We were served by a very friendly and nice waiter who we felt that was happy to work at Gotham. Me and my family noticed that all the waiters had a smile on their faces and wanted to work in the restaurant. The restrooms were clean, even though I wish they had more toilets and urinals. The noise level in the restaurant was not too loud, but not too quiet. I recommend this restaurant to a group of friends who wants a nice dinner but not to a couple who wants a romantic evening. Thank you Gotham for the awesome experience today.",0,0,0,Harry K.,"Manhattan, NY",1,2,0

4.0,7/8/2015,"First off, let me say that when I went, I ended up getting sick that night. So this might be a little bias because me being sick impacted the way things tasted. With that said, I decided to go for the Sweet Pea Soup and another dish which I forgot the name of. It was a steamed carrot with veggies on the side and it was delicious. The pea soup was a little too strong for me. It had a green creamy texture to it and I'm not too used to drinking something like that. Maybe it was because it didn't help my throat as much as I had hope it would. It wasn't bad, but it was sweet and something that might not mix with other dishes too well if you plan to have it as an app. The steamed carrot however was devoured in minutes. I have no idea how they seasoned it but it was done to a perfection no one else could replicate. For dessert, even though I wasn't up for it, my fiance ordered the Gotham Chocolate Cake. I took one bite and it melted in my mouth. By far the best dessert I have had and I'm a pickler for them. If you go, you need to try that for your first time. It'll be bringing you back for more.

The decor and design is modern meets fine and the servers are in traditional black and white. Ordinarily, I wouldn't be able to afford this meal, as the prices are very very high. But lucky for me, my out of town cousin was doling out an all too generous treat. We started the meal with the tuna tartare. My boyfriend quietly mentioned that we can split it and the restaurant was awesome enough to portion it out on two separate plates with the same beautiful presentation as the full portion. The tartare was delicious! Very light and refreshing. My cousin ordered the ceviche which again was again very yummy. So far so good! For entrees, my cousin got the risotto. She said unfortunately, it was very salty. I didn't try it, but judging from her palette she is a big foodie and she barely finished it. She just picked out the shrimp. I got the halibut and although the flavors were delicious (loved the eggplant texture too!) it was a bit overcooked and quite dry. For a $43 entree, you kind of expect it to be immaculate. My boyfriend got the salmon special they had and his was cooked to perfection. Much better temperature and moisture than my own fish entree. For dessert we all shared the chocolate cake and chocolate hazelnut mousse. The mousse was very nice a fluffy. Light, nice choice if you don't want to feel overstuffed. It also had these awesome little chocolate pieces that tasted like rice krispies covered in chocolate. We loved it! But really, the chocolate cake was the star! It was so light in weight but rich in taste. It was seriously an anomaly. They also gave us some delicious chocolate and pistachio financiers at the end of the meal that were moist and lovely. I didn't say much about the service because except for at the top of the meal, they were very silent like ninjas. Maybe they are trained to be that way? They were efficient though as my glass of water was always filled and like I said, things were plated to perfection. I personally love a server who's a little more engaged, but that's just me. There were no missteps in the service so I can't complain! Overall, the meal was fine and lovely. As expected. I do think it's overpriced for what they serve and think there are many more intimate and personal restaurants with uniqueness tjat fit the bill for half the price. But if you like food that's overall consistent and generally above average to good, this is a good choice! Gotham is kinda like the A student that does everything right but has no social life.

4.0,6/29/2015,"KenScale: 8.5/10Ever since its opening in 1984 in Greenwich Village, Gotham Bar and Grill has been one of the most enduring dining institutions in NYC, showcasing New American cuisine with farm-to-table sensibility (with chef Alfred Portale at the helm) in a very classic setting. It is the type of restaurants that I would love to take any out-of-town friends to introduce them to the greatness of New York dining experience. My first visit to this restaurant was back in the summer of 2012, and I've been meaning to make a repeat visit to see how the food here is holding up. Overall, the experience was a very successful one.For an restaurant that has been around for such a long time, there is always concern that the menu may be somewhat dated. Not at Gotham Bar; I could sense spirit of experimentation with emphasis on freshness of ingredients and thoughtful execution to really bring the flavor and texture together in each dish. The famed yellowfin tuna tartare that came on top of Japanese cucumber was still as delicious as last time I tried it. My dining companions couldn't stop raving about the sweet pea tortellini with came with morel mushrooms, leeks, carrots, pancetta and parmesan, and I concur that the pasta dish was great. My favor among the starter dishes however was the seafood risotto that came with ruby red shrimp and calamari. The seafood was absolutely crunchy to my delight, and the way they worked together with tomato, basil and chile was remarkable! Among the main dishes, the most successful one was the miso marinated black cod. You probably saw this dozens of times at established Japanese restaurants, but the one at Gotham could top most black cod dishes, with perfectly cooked fish that worked in great harmony with bok choy and sticky rice. The meat dishes I had tried (five spice duck with Chinese broccoli and rack of lamb with swiss chard, roasted cipollini and potato puree) were more or less perfectly cooked, but I wish the seasoning could've been slightly toned down to give greater emphasis to the texture of the meat. Out of desserts, don't skip the Sicilian pistachio semifreddo with fresh balsamic cherries, pistachio cake and yogurt ice cream. It was a pure delight, with the flavor of pistachio that was elegant without being too sweet. On the other hand, peanut butter sundae felt a little bit too overwhelming.Getting a reservation can be hard to come by at this classic institution, so make sure to book in advance. The restaurant has a full bar with very extensive wine selection. Service was overall professional and attentive, although I was a bit puzzled when we had to wait 30 minutes for a table to clear up. Gotham has that you-can't-go-wrong classic vibe perfect for a special occasion.

The burrata is perfect, soft and mushy and the perfect consistency of almost liquid on the inside.Sea bass ceviche: also superb. Served with a chili sauce that's drizzled on as it's presented.Oysters: pretty good, nothing outstanding.Entrees:Duck: delicious.

We started with oysters on the half shell and ahi tuna tartare. Both were perfect.For the main courses, my colleague had the rack of lamb - and was excessively happy. I had the salmon and asked for it rare - it was served perfectly on a bed of beautiful veggies with a delicious sauce. One of the best pieces of salmon that I've had in a long time.We shared the chocolate cake and it's as good as everyone has raved about. It's just so good that I can't even describe it effectively. It's extremely rich but not too rich. It's served warm but not too hot. It's decadent but still somehow light and isn't a bomb on the belly. It's served with a scoop of salted toasted almond ice cream. Perfect complement. Seriously...this is one of the best pieces of chocolate cake you'll ever experience.

Tonight I had a steak that contained the right amount of char but any semblance of precision cooking or tenderness was not on display. My ""steak"" knife repeatedly had difficulty.

2.0,4/28/2015,"I grew up as a latchkey kid. My parents were always busy working and traveling and had no time to cook food. Lucky for me our home was right next to a famous culinary school and my mom knew its administrator. She arranged for some of the school's best students to ""practice"" their cooking skills in our kitchen. My parents would buy them the best ingredients and they would cook whatever they learned that week in class. No time to cook...problem solved. I loved watching them work and over the years learned from them much about the culinary arts. That was in the late 60's... No, I didn't become a chef...I grew up and became a doctor. But cooking has always been my intense hobby and I eat out to enjoy good food and do some ""learning"".I'm not from New York but, when I visit, I make it a point to eat at highly rated restaurants as well as neighborhood dives and ethnic venues. I've been to Montrachet, Per Se, Esca, BLT, and many more, but for some reason skipped Gotham. So last week, while in Manhattan, it was time to book a table at this venerably worshiped establishment.No one is perfect and restaurant experiences are multifaceted - sometimes the food is extraordinary but service is mediocre. From experience I've learned that the best restaurants usually shine in most categories. Surprisingly, and singularly, Gotham was a very big disappointment. In fact, my greatest disappointment in many years of New York City dining.For starters I ordered the Striped Bass Ceviche and the Foie Gras. I've had countless iterations of ceviche style food - from Red Hook food trucks and the Koloa Fish Market in Kauai to powerful dishes at gourmet establishments world-wide. Gotham's ceviche was overly acid, really acid, with the citrus notes bordering on acute bitterness that obliterated the flavors of all other elements on the plate - including, first and foremost, - the fish. The morsel of Foie Gras was just that - a morsel just short of two inches long and less than an inch wide. I hate Denny-sized mega plates, but one should at least be afforded a two-bite experience. But that's OK. I can understand the exclusivity of bite sized presentation. The problem was that my tiny piece of plated property was ridiculously seared. All the yummy, buttery, gelatinously rich texture was gone only to be replaced with something resembling, in taste and texture, rather overcooked chicken liver.I ordered the New York Steak and my wife, the Rack of Lamb, both done just a tad above medium - not medium well and definitely not anywhere close to completely done. Let's start with the Lamb. First, a ""Rack"" is defined in most dictionaries as something relatively long. In the conventional wisdom of food a Rack of Lamb (carré d'agneau) is at its minimum, four individual frenched chops. Gotham served three. The meat was well done (not a hint of ""Pinkness"" to be found), there was absolutely no ""Rich Lamb Reduction"" to be found and the single tablespoon of mashed potatoes was watery and bland. My steak arrived, similarly, well done and again, absolutely no Bordelaise sauce. The sous chef in charge of sauces must have been on vacation that night. Fortunately, the meat was well aged and therefore tasty - even in its ""well done"" state - albeit a dry experience given no sauce whatsoever. The onion rings were soaked in oil - reminding me of the last days of the Park Slope Chip Shop.A few words about the staff: I cannot remember the last time a waiter at a comparable dining venue had to come back and ask what we ordered. This happened at Gotham twice!  There were four seated at our neighboring table and we watched as their main courses arrived ushered by three runners. Three of the four guests ordered Lobster and the fourth - the Salmon. The runners, our waiter, and a petite hostess on stilts went into a frenzied process discovering to whom belongs each dish. Finally, one of the runners discovered a note with the critical information. It was amusing.To summarize again: Surprisingly, and singularly, Gotham was a very big disappointment. In fact, my greatest disappointment in many years of New York City dining.",0,0,0,Ether S.,"New York, NY",1,9,0
4.0,4/28/2015,"Okay so there's a handful of restaurants that earned a posh status in Manhattan and have kept it despite the high volume of wannabe that open on a bi-second basis and GOTHAM is definitely one of them. I've been here twice and both times I was happy by the food and the service and all the other reviews will tell you enough about how delicious the food is (and I agree) So let me give you a twist: the restaurant blueprints are strange. One time we were seated against a huge Column and I felt so crammed I had to get moved (and they didn't seem too happy about that). Another time I was there with a larger group and we were seated at a decent table that was like a level above the rest of the restaurant. You have to squeeze between like 4 tables to get in there. It was strange. But that's not the worse part: a poor sad couple in front of me were literally seated with a Column directly in front of them. Just imagine this: you're sitting at a romantic restaurant enjoying some lamb chops with lots of fine New Yorkers surrounding you and you look up from your meal to see a MASSIVE column directly ATTACHED to your table ie. That's your view. So you say: well this is New York and space is expensive and that's that...and I understand BUT this place is pretty large! Space is NOT the issue. It's the structure. Tables need to be rearranged and there should be NO one seated against a column. It's just not appropriate and takes away from the atmosphere of the restaurant. It really dropped it a star down for me. So moral of the story? If you're a couple and you're going there for the first time REQUEST a good table.

Starting with our pre-meal drinks at the bar, the service was professional and friendly but not obtrusive. The Eastern Traveler and Square Root were refreshing and unique cocktails. For dinner we had the raw oysters and stripped bass ceviche.  While the oyster were delicious, the ceviche was the real standout for the first course. Second was the pea soup and beet salad. The soup tasted of fresh peas while the salad was a nice mix of red and golden beets with goat cheese. Both were nice dishes and in a different context might have been more remarkable but paled in comparison to everything elseThe entrée course was the salmon and the squab. Here, the squab was the clear standout and without a doubt, the single best dish of the night.

Our table ended up ordering a nice arrangement of dishes.The sashimi was heavenly. The fish fresh, the wasabi mayo potent, the salt crystals on point. I was so disappointed when it was all over; I wish I could've gotten as a second portion as an entreeThe halibut was cooked very well and fresh, flaked nicely when punctured, and had a nice crisp on the outside. Unfortunately my potato purée was cold when it arrived at our table. They might've had poor timing and coordination in the back, but especially with potatoes, cold food takes so much away from everything else. I think a second portion of the sashimi might've been a better choice.For dessert, I got the Gotham chocolate cake which was unlike anything I've ever had. The cake was so light and sliced so easily that it took me a while to understand the contents. It looked exactly like a cake but ate like a mousse. The accompanying ice cream was a perfect pairing.

Ain't got that kind of time to wait around since I already waited almost 20mins for my table so I just didn't eat that part of the fish.  The dish didn't wow me...Vanilla custard with caramelized steel cut oats - Yes .. steel cut oats.  It was like chewing steel in my mouth.  Plating was pretty, but it was poor dessert.  I didn't even finish it.  My jaw was tired after chewing that steel cut oats.Service was awkward at times.  The waitress was trying too hard to impress us.  After we paid our bill, she reached out for hand shakes.  Really?  That wasn't really necessary and a bit over the top.  It came across as insincere.  The whole experience was a disappointment.  My expectation was high.  I really looked forward to dine here.  Perhaps they were having an off day??  Pictures of Gotham bar look better than what it really is.  Tables were tight .. especially the front seating area.",6,0,1,Kim S.,"Stamford, CT",206,235,454
4.0,3/23/2015,"Alfred Portale is the pioneer of altitude plating (and foodie attitude) and he is an accomplished purveyor of nouvelle new york dining, especially for the expense account set. Despite collecting years of rave reviews and thereby having an excuse to rest on its laurels, Gotham remains a solid competitor for fine dining honors in NYC.  Pricey -- yes, but oh so worth it when the kitchen is on (which is to say, almost always).  The room itself is a spectacle of understated elegance, wide open with high ceilings, a tasteful build-out, and an intimate feel in the sunken dining area.  The staff are professional, eager, knowledgable and attentive, without being overly intrusive, allowing for a relaxed meal in multiple courses, as intended.  Loud when packed, the acoustics mute the volume enough to allow conversation. The seasonal menu showcases classic French technique, often married with pan asian variations. On our most recent visit,  I especially liked the first course of striped bass ceviche with its rainbow of sweet, sour, salty and spicy flavors accomplished by the marinade of pineapple, radish, pomelo, avocado, and grenada chili citrus and deft seasoning.  The pineapple and pomelo break down and cook the bass ever so slightly and loosen the texture enough for the other ingredients to seep in. A wonderful start.  No less successful was the  chicken and foie gras terrine, given great depth and earthiness by addition of morel mushrooms, sweetness with beets, texture with pistachios, on a perfect foil of brioche toast; showcasing the chef's skill at coaxing a cacophony of flavors from just a few ingredients.  The second course salads were less impressive but the mushroom risotto was perfectly cooked, although the mushroom/pancetta component was too assertive when paired against the baby arugula, gruyere and chervil, causing me to lose the more subtle ingredients in the dish. The NY strip with bordelaise was well executed to the right temperature and the sauce was correct, but I agree with others that the meat was hyped to a higher standard and was ultimately less flavorful than an aged cut at The Palm or Lugers.  The lamb rack was also well executed and the lamb itself (and the lamb reduction) was very rich, but I was missing some crunch, and something zippy to go with, like middle eastern or north african spicing to punch up the onions, chard and mash.  We finished with elderflower parfait, sorbets and the signature chocolate cake, all of which looked terrific, tasted great and left a lingering sweet richness and kaleidoscope of more subtle flavors on the palate that says ""want more.""   The wine list is impressive and priced to match.  Gotham is not bargain basement dining, and some folks seem disappointed by the value of their ""restaurant week"" experience.  I get that the promise of high end dining can sometimes underwhelm on any given day and especially during a citywide marketing event.  The final point about Gotham is that for many years now it is on the top ten list of best restaurants in NYC.  This is no accident.",1,0,1,Yuri Y.,"Ridgewood, NJ",449,440,1563

5.0,3/11/2015,Sooo full disclosure I also came here with my dad when he came to visit last year but I realized I wrote no reviews about our restaurant extravaganza so here I go. First off- Absolutely fantastic food and service. You cant get any better than Gotham Bar and Grill. The service was amazing as well. We had an old school NYC waiter who was around my dads age and looked like he knew how to take care of a table. He was great.We ordered the yellowfin tuna tartate to start and it was absolutely perfect. The fish was so smooth it felt like glass in your mouth. In a good way.. like the kind of way when you can tell the fish is high quality and fresh. For our second course we ordered the risotto. My dad usually isnt the biggest risotto fan but this blew both of us away. It was perfectly cooked and very tasty. For my entree I ordered the miso marinated black cod. It was absolute perfection. The fish was perfectly cooked and the portion size wasnt so small where I was hungry after I ate it. The soy lemongrass ginger sauce was the star of the plate. I wish I had a whole vat of it to pour over every single thing I cook. I cant remember what my dad ordered but it was either the pork or the lamb... i just remember he was extremely impressed by the food. Now we usually dont go for dessert but we were casually checking out the dessert items coming out from the kitchen while we were eating our meal and gave into temptation. We went with the chocolate mousse and were not disappointed. I need to come back here again.,2,0,1,Shannon H.,"Redwood City, CA",380,224,322

4.0,3/5/2015,"This place is very fancy, bright, and simple. The waitstaff are detail oriented and professional. They know exactly who ordered what. My favorite appetizer was the yellowfin tuna tartare. This is a must have. Their foie gras is also very good, and definitely worth a try. The beet salad was ok but the roasted cauliflower was very good. For entrees, the muscovy duck is pretty good. I had the 28 day dry age steak. It definitely filled me up, but it lacked a bit in flavor. I had to rely on the sauce for flavoring. There was a stack of onion rings, those were very crispy.Dessert consisted of the sorbet  and salted almond ice cream with chocolate cake. They also gave us cute complimentary ball shaped buns. Everything was good. I'd definitely come back",3,0,1,Jennifer A.,"Flushing, NY",305,328,502
4.0,3/5/2015,"One of my Restaurant Week picks this year.  Great choice.  The pumpkin soup was amazing.  I am a bit biased because I love everything pumpkin, but this was definitely above par.  My friend had the tuna appetizer and was very pleased with that choice as well.  Both of us had the quail as the entree.  Loved the couscous.  The Moroccan flavoring was delicious.  I had the vanilla custard for dessert and my friend had the chocolate cake.  The custard was definitely the star.  The citrus and sorbet on top was the perfect tart complement to the smooth, creamy custard.  The chocolate cake was not bad, but it was aggressively chocolatey.  Too rich for its own good.  Half a star off for the chocolate cake and half a star for one of my pet peeves: when the waiter brings the check when only one party is at the table.  Especially if that party is the woman.  Still one more day in Restaurant Week.  Check it out if you can!  (Also worth a visit at full price.)",2,1,2,Candis D.,"Brooklyn, NY",63,251,77
4.0,3/4/2015,"A colleague and I decided to play hooky from work in order to hit some restaurant week top 10's for lunch.  Despite opentable stating that there were not tables left for lunch, we wandered in around 12:15 and were seated immediately at a small two-top.  The restaurant itself is very nice, well lit, well decorated and feels posh.  If you're headed there for lunch, more casual work/dressy attire is recommended and I am sure it upgrades to straight dressy attire for the evening rush.  With high ceilings and an feel somewhere in between modern and old world, the ambiance here is quite nice and was quite comfortable for a nice lunch.As per restaurant week norms, we worked our way through the prix fixe menu.  H.L. started with the sea bass sashimi and I with the pumpkin soup and traded half way through.  The pumpkin soup was creamy without the grainy fibers that squash soups can often take on.  Sprinkled with small spots of oil in a colorful pattern around dried cherries, pumpkin seeds, and miniscule cooked pieces of pumpkin, the dish had a wonderful array of texture, taste, and colorful bright notes from fruit.  The sea bass was entertaining but more was more one-dimensional.  Fresh sea bass was sprinkled with a soy based sauce with pickled onions, peppers, and micro-greens that were all finely sliced.  While good, it wasn't something I'd absolutely have to return here for.In the second/main course, I opted for the risotto while H.L. chose the short ribs.  The risotto was of a lighter nature and had a much higher content of vegetables than expected but resulted in a much lighter lunch-style risotto.  Normally I would have expected the risotto to be much heavier and much more cheesy but the chef here accounted for the general nature of lunch by switching the rice to a much lighter pearl barley.  Cooked perfectly and not overpowering in nature, I would definitely try the risotto again as a great lunch special.  H.L.'s short ribs were apparently a favorite on the menu and were alright.  The meat fell apart in that oh-so-wonderful slow cooked fashion and was given a dollop of sauce on the top that wasn't overpowering but was very hard to distinguish.  It was cooked perfectly and had a decent amount of flavor, but I think I'd rather stick with the risotto in the future.For dessert, I ordered the vanilla custard as I generally love lighter desserts.  The vanilla custard itself was creamy and smooth with little black flecks to show that a real vanilla bean was used.  It was topped with four small mandarin orange slices, a small dollop of mandarin orange sorbet and had a small amount of carmelized steel cut oats as a side.  The oats themselves added a wonderful amount of texture to this creamy dish but weren't quite as flavorful as I expected.  That being said, they didn't overpower the light and fruity taste from the mandarin oranges or the custard so in the end they matched quite well.  H.L. opted for the gotham chocolate cake which was delicious in it's own right.  The cake was deliciously moist and incredibly chocolately.  It was paired with a salted almond ice cream which helped mediate the intense chocolate flavor when taken in the same bite.  Not quite my cup of tea, as the chocolate was a little overpowering for me, but H.L. is an avid chocolate lover and would recommend this to anyone who loves chocolate.  All in all, the restaurant was beautiful and the food was on that the higher middle ground area of New York restaurants.  I would say that it would be a good standard if you could afford to pay a little more for lunch or dinner and wanted something that wouldn't disappoint in any course.",0,0,0,Caroline L.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,94,56

4.0,3/3/2015,"This place is beautiful- we chose it as the restaurant to celebrate the night of my 30th in, so we got all dressed up- something the restaurant calls for anyway. My husband wore a jacket as specified but noted other diners not wearing one when we arrived.We started at the bar and had some wine, and being rather hungry we dived into the complimentary bar snacks (salted nuts).  we had been waiting approx. 20 minutes to be seated despite having a booking when the guy came over and said something about  needing to get us seated before we ate all the snacks- I'm not sure if this was a joke or not but it felt at the time as a bit of a barbed comment- maybe they were 'look and not touch' snacks?!Once seated, we chose one main meal each, no starter or dessert. As it was a special occasion I went for the lobster and hubby had steak- both delicious and well presented. This place is expensive, but unlike other restaurants it does give the option to go minimalistic if you wanted to, so we called it a day and asked for the bill as we wanted to visit the Empire State Building before the evening was up. It was unfortunate timing that the bill had been paid and we were literally just standing up to leave when they presented me with a birthday dessert plate-  something I was very touched by but wondered why they'd literally waited til the last minute to present it. As I say, just unfortunate timing but it was a nice gesture.

If you can get one, the tables in the back are much better because they are spacious compared to the tables at the front which are way too close together!I tend to prefer the appetizers here to the main dishes, the main dishes are good but the appetizers are just exceptional.  My favorite appetizer is the seafood salad (although they've changed the recipe this past year and it's not quite as delicious as it used to be)! For entrees any of the seafood options are good.  During lunch the short rib, lamb shank or burger are very good.  Last time I was here, I noticed a couple eating what looked like the most unbelievable apple tarte tatin which was not on the menu.  Upon leaving I asked the hostess if this was a special order that we could request next time we came.  I was told the waiter always mentions the tarte and was really disappointed since NO ONE has ever mentioned this to us out of the numerous times we have dined and lunched here... I also have to say that the service although good is sometimes a bit snobby which I could do without.  All in all great food and the place to go for a special occasion or to treat yourself to a fancy and tasty meal!",1,0,0,Clara H.,"South Orange, NJ",102,298,89
4.0,2/26/2015,"Restaurant Week Winter 20154 stars based on the fact my meal only cost $25. If it had cost normal, non RW prices, this probably would be 3 stars. FoodWild Striped Bass Sashimi - Good but should be eaten quickly as the sashimi quickly soaks up too much of the sauce and becomes overseasoned. I really liked the avocado wasabi puree.Pumpkin Soup - Delicious and creamy but nothing too special that you can't make at home with a good blender.Pan Seared Halibut - Halibut was well cooked but very plain. Could use more seasoning. Not enough sauce in the dish to make up for lack of flavor in halibut.Crispy Moroccan Spiced Quail - Well-cooked and juicy with lots of flavor.Gotham Chocolate Cake - My favorite part of the meal. This was one of the best chocolate cakes I have had. Delicious, rich, creamy, with a pure chocolate flavor. It tasted like chocolate truffles but lighter and creamier in cake form. The salted almond ice cream accompanying it was amazing but they were very stingy with its portion.Vanilla Custard - Good custard, nothing too special, tasted like a more expensive version of vanilla pudding cups. The steel cut oats accompanying it weren't great. To hard, not crunchy. The accompanying citrus mandarin sorbet was pretty incredible, very tart and pure in fruit flavor, but just the for the ice cream above, very very stingy with portion.ServiceGood service in my opinion.

I rarely find dining during Restaurant Week worth it, but the prominence of Gotham Bar and Grill and their 1 Michelin Star convinced me to make a lunch reservation on President's Day during RW Winter 2015. The whole experience was a collection of hits and misses.About the atmosphere:(HITS)The space is indeed gorgeous. I appreciated that even though it was a busy holiday, our table was ready for us when we arrived. Coat check was available, but they let us keep our jackets if we wanted. (Foreshadowing!)(MISSES) 1) As soon as we were seated, we noticed that the table wobbled because the legs were uneven. This was fixed when I brought it to their attention... but still? It made everything feel less fancy.2) The tables are REALLY close together. Like, so close that I know the Korean couple sitting to the left of us were celebrating the husband's birthday, and the wife carried a Céline handbag. The family on the right of us were visiting NYC on vacation; the daughter didn't eat fish, and the son was on a gluten-free diet...3) We were seated about 5 tables into the restaurant, but we still felt the ultra chilly 20°F draft every time someone opened the door. Good thing we didn't check our coats because by the time we got our entrees, we had to put them on.Onto the food:Appetizers:(HIT) Wild Striped Bass Crudo - Delicate and delicious.(MISS) Organic Kale and Quinoa Salad - Not creative at all.Entrees:(OK) Pearl Barley and Wild Mushroom ""Risotto""- Tasty, small portion. As the quotes suggest, not a true risotto.(OK) Crispy Moroccan Spiced Quail - 2 well-prepared pieces, but a bit hard to eat using a fork and knife with all the tiny bones. The quail was served over a tablespoon of couscous which was laughable.Desserts:(HIT) Gotham Chocolate Cake - If you like dark chocolate, this is the dessert for you! Sweet, bitter, airy, and rich. This was the best thing I had during my meal.(MISS) Vanilla Custard - Disappointingly, this was not a vanilla custard at all... more like a citrus pudding with citrus fruits, and toasted steel cut oats on the side. The oats were really tough to chew, and we left most of this dessert untouched.Overall, there were more misses than hits, and I don't think I'll be returning during Restaurant Week or otherwise. I know I had failed my lunch partner when the reaction to his dessert was, ""I can't wait to go home so I can have a bowl of cereal."" Womp womp.",10,5,4,Nicole C.,"Washington, DC",197,569,918

If you are a fan of citrus flavors, I would order the salmon. My boyfriend had the Tuna Tartare which I liked even better. Presentation of the tartare was unforgettable. Almost too pretty to eat. Would get it again.Second course was actually my favorite. I had the Wild Mushroom Risotto. I do not know how to explain with words how I truly feel about this mushroom risotto. My last meal on this world will be this mushroom risotto. For two weeks after this dish, I tried to make the perfect risotto. Nothing came close to this. I threw in the towel. I have given myself the boot. I suck. My boyfriend hates mushrooms but loved this. I don't even remember what he ordered to be honest, my mind was elsewhere. I visited back in December yet the flavors and texture still haunt me. By the third course, I was becoming full. I did not anticipate that. I ordered the Free Range Chicken. The sauces made this dish. The chicken was  moist on the inside and fell apart with ease. This was an excellent follow up from the mushroom risotto. The mushroom flavors in this dish are a welcome transition. It is the cheapest of the third course selections, however it tastes just as rich as my boyfriend's choice. He chose the Maine Lobster and Short Rib of Beef. The presentation of this was my favorite. The lobster is served with this beautiful foam, hot and steaming. The beef was like butter. The texture is melt in your mouth. Easily the best beef I have had. Although we were both full mid way, we continued to eat. It was that good. I cannot speak for the desserts but they looked lovely. The server who waited on us for the night was patient and had a kind face. It was my first time at a restaurant with such accolades. I was excited yet nervous but our server put me at ease.

I ordered the halibut which was super tender and had great flavor. My parents ordered the lobster and the aged steak which were both good as well. The service was excellent.For dessert, I had the peanut butter sundae which was a bit too sweet. I was hoping for more ice cream but it was mainly just whipped cream and peanut butter.

5.0,1/24/2015,"Went here last night for a friends birthday. Got the tuna app, shared the tortellini, had the duck and tried the cod. The tuna and cod were absolutely phenomenal. Highly recommended. The duck was very good and well cooked. The tortellini was also phenomenal (save bread... I'd eat the sauce just with bread) but overpriced.More information...Food: Tuna tartar: very very high quality. Nice portion size and had good umami. Presentation was also excellent. Tortellini: As mentioned before, very overpriced but also excellent. The sauce makes the dish. If they had brought more bread it would be worth every penny. Duck: Perfectly cooked and not oily in the least. Sauce was perfectly sweet but it could have used a bit more. The ends were crispy and far and away the best part. Couscous was flavorful and served as a nice accompaniment.Cod: the highlight of the night. Miso and soy was the perfect pairing for the thick by flaky fish. It had body but melted when you took a bite. The sear was on point. Highly recommended. Peanut butter Sunday: Cookie crumble was delicious. Very heavy. If you aren't full after dinner you will be after this. Atmosphere:Relaxed and cool but definitely high end. Open seating arrangement with high ceilings but not loud in the least. Very easily had a conversation across a large table all night without raising my voice once. Staff:Perhaps the only demerit. The staff was not snobby but clearly aiming high. There's a difference between service and servants and they felt like the second of the two which I don't enjoy at all. Recommendation:Visit on a special occasion, but definitely visit. Including a bottle if sparkling wine and drinks, the bill was over $600 for 5 people.",1,0,1,Dan G.,"Keansburg, NJ",57,37,8

4.0,1/17/2015,"I enjoyed my experience at Gotham. Would I be back? Probably not, but I will always cherish my memories there. Kampachi SashimiKampachi is my latest obsession and this dish was the perfect start to our lovely evening. The beautiful mix of sweet and zest lubricated our palettes for what turned out to be a truly fantastic meal. The dish was very generous in terms of portion size and sauce. Fish was top-notch. No complaints here.Seafood RisottoA great follow-up to the sashimi. It was rich, it was savory, it was mesmerizing. Before I knew it, it disappeared off my plate. Shrimp was perfectly cooked and seasoned and I loved how the pancetta gave the dish a natural saltiness.Muscovy DuckSince I live in California and could not eat foie gras (legally) until a few days ago, I make a point to order it when it's on the menu. The duck was cooked beautifully--medium, just how I like it. The foie gras was out of this world--seared to perfection. I couldn't care much for the quinoa. It was too citrusy in my opinion but if you mix it with the port sauce, it wasn't too bad.Foie gras stole the show for me though.Rack of Lamb It was good but not spectacular like our other dishes. The potato puree and the reduction were great but the lamb was underwhelming. It was not as tender as I  had hoped.  Elderflower ParfaitWe were super stuffed but knew a meal was not complete unless we got dessert. I've been into elderflower a lot lately since I tasted my first cocktail starring the delightful flower. I had no idea what a sable (pronounced SAB-BLUH in French) was, but according to our waitress, who had to ask the chef, it is a kind of shortbread that crumbles in your mouth. There was some science involved that I simply cannot remember.The dessert was light, refreshing, and a perfect palette cleanser for the evening.",2,1,1,Vina V.,"Redwood City, CA",1034,235,3

Service is near perfect, friendly, prompt, knowledgable, efficient, with no hovering and wasted effort. I ordered the salmon for my main course.

3.0,12/22/2014,"This place, in my opinion, is a little over hyped. I went in with extremely high expectations. 4.5 stars in yelp, 1 Michelin Star-This place is going to be great. Reservation: extremely difficult to get. We ended up getting a 9:30 reservation on a Saturday night. A time is better than no time, but also we made this over a month in advance.We arrived for our reservation at about 9:00 and we're told to wait until 930 to be seated (said nicer than that, but that was the tldr). The waiting area is non existant so we were hovering around an already crowded bar and other tables of patrons trying to enjoy their dinner. This was a bit annoying becuase as we are standing and waiting, waiters are trying to get around us to serve the customers in that area. Obviously, this is just a disaster waiting to happen - and sure enough, it did happen as a waiter was cleaning up the chocolate fudge and vanilla ice cream dessert, his hands slipped and dropped it on the floor thus splashing it on nice suit pants of my boyfriend. The waiter quickly appologized and ran to get a rag - then was no where to be found. After about 10 minutes, we asked the maitre-d for a wet rag to see if we can get the stain out before dinner. They were very apologetic, but surprisingly, did not compensate in anyway until we called the next day when we saw there actually was a stain there. They then said to bring the dry cleaning bill to them (we are sitll in the process of doing this). But all other restaurants would have compensated right that night (perhaps with a complementary cocktail which would be the equivalence of drycleaning). Service: The service was good and out water glasses were always full, but the bus men and women when pouring water would splash it all over the table. Perhaps I am being picky, but these are the things that I notice. The tables were very close together so it is a bit tight to get up and out of your table to go to the bathroom or wherever.Food: For food, we got scallops, lamb, and venicin. BREAD - they walk around giving you another piece of bread as you finish your previous one - bread is room temperature/cold since they kept walking around with them. Scallops: the food was in the indent of a plate that was about 3.5 inches in diameter - although there was not a lot of scallops, the taste was very good. The lamb - cooked to perfection and paired with spinach and mashed potatoes. Sides went very well with the lamb, but the lamb was a bit salty for my liking (although once you got past the outer salty layer, the inside was nice and pink and cooked very well). Venicin: I've never eaten venicin before - it doesn't taskt or look much different than other meats (closer to a steak or the red meats than chicken). As a ""thank you"" for coming, you get these little balls of bread type cakes (about a half inch in diameter). They were very cute and a good way to end the night. If I wasn;t stuffed to the brim, I would have munched on these a bit more.Bathroom: the bathroom has an interesting set up - you walk in a diagnal door and then walk doen a longer hall way to the stalls. I think there were 2 stalls in there (seems to have slipped my mind) and there was no line.TL;DR: I think this place was a good experience (ignoring the incident in the beginning) but not sure I would go back again for dinner.",6,0,0,Dana M.,"New York, NY",114,312,130

4.0,11/17/2014,"I'm sure you are wondering why they don't get five stars. Well, we were a party of 6, celebrating my birthday. Reservation was for 9:30. The table wasn't ready until 10, which wasn't a big deal, because parking was a nightmare. The host was so sweet, and had us seated as quickly as he could. We sat at this large round table, half booth. So spacious and perfect for us, because we knew we'd be filling the table with allt of food. After being sat, we waited about 10 minutes before we were greeted. I ordered sparkling water for myself and my husband and the rest of the table had tap. After getting water, another five mins passed before our server asked for cocktails. Mind you, we still don't have menu's at this point. About 5 mins after we order cocktails, our server then comes and gives us menus. We browse the menu for about 10 mins, close the menus and wait for our drinks. Our drinks finally come and we order appetizers. I kid you not, it was a good 35-45 minutes before we ordered. The server insisted we order everything right away because ""it's typically best to do that on a busy night"" which was fine, we were all ready. Apps came out about 15 minutes later. My husband and I went outside after and the host said have a good night how was dinner. When we told him we still haven't had it yet, he was shocked. It was 11:30 at this point! We came back in, dinner was hitting the table. This was the last time we saw our server. He told us to enjoy our dinner and we became the forgotten table. They never filled my sparkling water, instead they filled it with tap, fine no big deal. But some people wanted to order more drinks and we couldn't. Now here's the part where it gets good! The food! Everything was perfect. We started with shrimp cocktail, Tuna tar tar, fois gras terrine, white truffle risotto (they shave the white truffles on the plate at the table!) and the burratta salad. Everything was perfect. The shrimp were cooked to perfection, the cocktail sauce was nice and spicy. The tuna tartar was served with toast and it was mouth watering. Risotto was INCREDIBLE. The fois gras had squab in it, and it was literally like butter. The burratta had just the right amount of red peppers and dressing. I can still taste it! Two of us did second courses, the risotto, and the roasted cauliflower. Both were great dishes and perfect palate cleansers. Now for the main event, the entrees. Three of us ordered the lobster and short rib, and then the others had the veal, the duck, and the lamb. The lamb was a bit over cooked, but we didn't mention it because it was medium instead of medium rare. The lobster was cooked PERFECTLY! the short rib literally fell apart and melted in my mouth. The veal was tender and juicy. Great flavor, the duck smelled delicious. I didn't try it. All in all, our entrees were pretty much perfect. No one spoke at the table until our plates were empty! Our table was cleared, and we ordered dessert. The apple tarte tatin, the chocolate mousse and the peanut butter sundae. The apple dessert is served for two, at a whopping $28, and did NOT disappoint. The chocolate mousse had a weird flavor behind the chocolate and the peanut butter sundae is exactly how it sounds. All, very delicious. The service was spotty, drinks and food were perfect. Absolutely  check this spot out.",3,2,3,Danielle S.,"ROCKAWAY PARK, NY",185,102,7

Japanese Cucumber, Shiso Lead and Sweet Miso Asian Ginger Vinaigrette. This opener was outstanding... Quite possibly the best Tuna Tartare I've had in the city, rivaling Jean Georges' Nougatine. Fresh, light, crisp, and refreshing. An excellent execution from a starred restaurant.Wild Striped Bass Sashimi @ Gotham, NYC. Asian Pear, Watermelon Radish, Cucumber, Yuzo Ginger Emulsion, Avocado Wasabi Purée. This dish pales in comparison to the former Tuna Tartare, but still did not disappoint. The fish was fresh and buttery, and did not stay on the plate long after this photo was taken. The avocado wasabi purée was a bit much for my taste, distracting from the delicacy of the fish.Seafood Salad @ Gotham, NYC. Scallops, Squid, Spanish Octopus, Lobster, Sweet Shrimp, Avocado and Lemon Vinaigrette. Pretty much a combination of all of my favorite things. I could eat this for breakfast everyday...Local Albacore Tuna Nicoise @ Gotham, NYC. Haricot Vert, Fingerling Potato, Quail Egg, Frisée Lemon Olive Vinaigrette.Miso Marinated Black Cod @ Gotham, NYC. Bok Choy, Shiitake Mushrooms and Sticky Rice, Soy Lemongrass Ginger Sauce. I went into this dish not expecting much, as it seems to be a staple on soo many menus. I was happily surprised.

It is like the chocolate of chocolate. It has been about 3 weeks since our visit and I can still taste it in my mouth.Our waiter was superb. He clearly has tasted each dish and formed his own opinion about them. I cannot stress how important this is. He made fantastic recommendations and even corrected my terrible French pronunciation of a wine all while never being condescending or snooty.

Our server, Kimberle, barely greeted us and left us alone with the menus after we said no to ordering wine. It took her a while to come back and get our orders in, and once she got them in, she was no longer existent. Not once throughout our meals did she come and ask us if our food was okay or if we would like dessert towards the end. She mainly focused her attention on the bigger party next to us. I even tried to wave her down a couple of times but she'd just stand there looking dazed before running the other way. Luckily for us, the bus boy was more attentive and helped us throughout our meals. The food didn't really impress us either. We got the yellowfin tuna tartare and seafood salad for starters which was good followed by the miso marinated black cod (a bit too salty) and ricotta tortellini (the vegetables were bitter).  We then finished the meal by sharing the gotham chocolate cake which was really nothing to rave about. Having read all of the positive reviews here on Yelp, I guess my expectations were simply too high.

My lack of self-control around carbs was thankfully not an issue tonight! Side note, the walnut-embedded bread is delicious!For an appetizer, I got the tuna tartare. The presentation is elegant and simple and it was the perfect teaser to start the meal. I also had a taste of my brothers' tortellini appetizer which was well-proportioned and had a great sauce.My main course, the muscovy duck, was so delicious and well-paired with the quinoa.

5.0,10/19/2014,"""Bar and Grill"" is a bit of a misnomer here, as this is truly a fine dining restaurant. The kampachi sashimi is among the best I've had, and the roasted cauliflower appetizer was absolutely amazing--complex and delicate at the same time.True, I did have a New York strip steak for dinner, but it was really the only item I'd describe as coming from a grill. It was an excellent steak, by the way, with a thick char and coated with a sticky Bordelaise.There is a solid if somewhat pricey wine list.Service is professional yet friendly.The one caveat: The place is LOUD. There isn't really a quiet corner where you can hide from it, so be prepared or go at an off time, if there is one.",2,0,1,Steve A.,"Orlando, FL",262,1232,3712

Make a reservation in advance on Open Table. Food: The Seared Hudson Valley Fois Gras almost felt creamy. The Halibut ont eh other hand was just okay. I thought the flavors overpowered the fish.

4.0,10/13/2014,"We had dinner here on a Friday evening and it was completely packed. We had a nice table next to the bar which is slightly raised so you can get a good view of the other diners and more importantly what they are eating. The downside of this was that I was in direct line of the air-conditioning so spent most of dinner wearing my jacket. I have no idea why everywhere in the USA has to be so cold. If its too cold to enjoy dinner without a jacket - well its TOO COLD !!Another downside of being next to the bar was that it did increase the noise volume at our table.That being said we had a lovely waiter who talked us through the menu making suggestions. He was speedy with any requests and more importantly with toping up our wine. I had sashimi to start and it was deliciously light and just about the right size. Next my lamb was amazing. I like to order lamb when we are out as hubby doesn't like it so I never cook it at home. When I see it on the menu it is a nice treat. I wasn't disappointed. It was cooked perfectly and was succulent and tasty. I'd come back again just for that dish. My husband wasn't very hungry and had a starter seafood risotto as his main he said it was well cooked and tasty but that it wasn't breaking any culinary records anytime soon. There was a good selection of house wines to choose from that were served by the glass too. Getting a table here isn't easy. It has a Michelin star and gets very busy but I'd definitely suggest it if you are in town, and it will feature on our list of places to go next time we are here.",0,0,0,Swisswife Y.,"New York, NY",0,31,3

Everything on the plate married beautifully creating a symphony of flavors on the palate. Pork chop was cooked perfectly (although the kale garnish was way over done). Gotham cake was a great way to end the night. Why not 5 stars? Bread was average (served cold and hard as a rock until I said something and the bus boy brought me some warm rolls which were delish) and the decor is rather underwhelming compared to other high end places I have been to.

Always a good start to the meal if the bread is good. Only suggestion would be to warm the bread first. ( I do love me some heated up carbs!)We started with the beet salad. Which they so nicely split for us. Very tasty with the golden and purple beets. My next course was the duck, foie gras, and persimmon. Loved every bite. I made sure to try all the combos together but the foie gras with a little duck, followed up by a bite of persimmon was probably the best. Reminded me of a restaurant in Paris where I last had some really magnificent foie gras. The hubby had the fish which was also phenomenal. (I enjoyed mine more. Shhh)The sommelier was on point with her suggestion. Smokey and paired elegantly with our meal. Topped off with some chocolate and regular corn bread? Not quite sure. Instead of ordering a dessert we opted for a nightcap. Their old fashion is out of this world. My meal and service was really top notched that night. The hubs really out did himself with my welcome dinner to the city.

5.0,10/7/2014,"For our last night in NYC, we made reservations at Gotham Bar & Grill based on the outstanding reviews.  During all of our dinner reservations prior to our last night, we were continually late so we decided to make our dinner reservations at Gotham at 10 pm which was PERFECT.   We checked in and they had our table ready for us.  A couple of the ladies had to use the ladies room so they waited til we were all ready prior to seating us. Some of the girls grabbed drinks and when we were ready, they brought our drinks for us to our table.  We were seated at a big booth to fit all six of us. Our waiter was wonderful and provided outstanding service.  We ordered several appetizers and each ordered an entree.  Everything was very well made and fantastic. For first and second courses we all decided to order several and shared them family style.  Following are the dishes we ordered: Baby Organic Kale And Quinoa Saladblack currants, bosc pear, marcona almonds, pecorino pepato*this was delicious!  Yellowfin Tuna Tartarejapanese cucumber, shiso leaf and sweet miso ginger vinaigrette*I love tuna tartare so I was definitely a fan of this dishSeafood Risottoruby red shrimp, calamari, razor clams, pancetta, eckerton hill farm tomatoes, capers and basil*YUM Seared Hudson Valley Foie Grasrhubarb confit, amarena cherry, sicilian pistachio, brioche villa manodori cherry balsamic*I didn't get try this but my friends raved about it I ordered the Miso Marinated Black Cod as an entree and it was just wonderful.  I didn't get to try my friends' entree dishes but they all raved about theirs.My friends tried the foie gras and loved it. We llve in San Francisco and they've outlawed the sale of foie gras so they definitely indulged in this dish.  Service here was definitely top notch.  Highly recommend this place for a date night out.  It was an awesome pick to end our trip to NYC.  LOVE!",5,1,1,Christine P.,"San Francisco, CA",667,741,736
5.0,10/1/2014,"I've eaten here twice, both times during restaurant week. My first experience was 8 of my freshmen friends in college and we clearly weren't used to such a fine dining experience. Still, we felt welcomed and proceeded to have an incredible meal. Service from top to bottom was excellent and attentive. We ended up ordering everything on the restaurant week menu and traded bites of each. What I remember most is their fantastic treatment of mushrooms, several different types prepared several different ways. That one meal turned me into a mushroom fan, and I've been trying to recreate the experience ever since. We were served several courses, including an amuse bouche I believe, and left incredibly full and satisfied. That is a rarity for a restaurant week meal. My second experience was also great, but couldn't match the first as the bar had been set incredibly high. It really impressed me that they pulled out all the stops for restaurant week diners, and I hope to go back and try their regular menu someday soon.",0,0,0,Wade C.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,129,2

With drapes on the ceiling and bright lighting. They were super packed for a Thursday lunch so I was super happy to have made reservations in advance. For my lunch entree I ordered the soft shell crab. It was perfectly golden brown and  crispy all while retaining all the sweetness and texture of the crab meat. It was served on a bed of corn salsa with spicy mayo drizzled on top. My friend ordered a grilled fish entree served on a bed of vegetables. She enjoyed it just as much as I enjoyed my meal. We shared a bottle of Riesling that was recommended by our server and it completed our meal.The service was very attentive and catered to our every needs.

The seafood salad was pretty good, way too much  calamari but again pretty good. not a lot of flavor but hey, you can always make up for that with quantity right? My wife's tuna tartare on the other hand Perfect,. For entrees my wife ordered the duck I ordered the steak. The duck was okay pretty fatty sliced very thin served kind of cold. Came with a boring side of couscous. The steak was fine a little over cooked, I ordered medium rare and it was definitely medium. Look, there's nothing really to complain about, except for the fact that this is a Michelin rated restaurant and the meal cost over $300. I should mention the service, which like everything else, was just okay. She was very attentive at first but then she disappeared for 10 minutes or more when we needed her towards the end of the meal. No big deal but hey... We could have gone to commerce in the village or many other restaurants for half the price and a better meal.

Be prepared to sit at the bar (and possibly receive worse service) if you don't have reservations. My choices were:Quinoa and kale salad: I thought this was overly and unnecessarily dressed because the dried currants, fresh stone fruit, salty quinoa, and shaved cheese imparted so much flavor into this artfully composed saladNova Scotia halibut: this was a show-stopper of a plate. The halibut was cooked and seasoned simply, which really highlighted the absolutely delicious pea purée and vegetable ratatouilleMeyer lemon pudding cake: I actually forgot this was a Meyer lemon cake because I only recall it tasting of ricotta, but this was a light and tasteful dessert with lots of sweet berries, a slightly tangy and very yummy yogurt ice cream, and a buttery shortbread crumble. However, the portion size was very small - if it's quantity you're going for, I'd suggest the chocolate cake insteadFor a restaurant with such a classic (if slightly dated) feel, I was pleasantly surprised by the modern farm-to-table sensibilities exhibited by the menu.

It came with some barley+ turnip salad but I'm not sure it goes well with the slices if salmon. I decided to eat it with some of the bread roll we got before our meal and it tasted good together. This dish needed a better carb option. Halibut- Good but slightly dry. The bed of vegetables under it was well seasoned.Chocolate cake- I wish it came with more ice cream. The cake to ice cream ratio just wasn't right for me. It's a pretty dense cake-- more fudge than cake. The texture was somewhere between a brownie and chocolate mousse.

5.0,7/8/2014,"I am so glad i trusted other reviewers and tried this place. The many many many managers, servers, bartenders, bus people.... were all so sweet and helpful. I mean it. I liked this somewhat conservative approach to dining a lot. Not so edgy, trendy, hip and hard and LOUD. This place is lively, full, attractive and fun, but thanks to good design and ceiling materials installed, one can hear and be heard without getting a headache. I know, people think if their restaurant is noisy that it implies that it's frantically fun. NOT.And the food ! Branzino was lovely texture and taste. The Maine Lobster is very pretty and tasty plate.  My husband said his chocolate concoction flourless cake for dessert was like a chocolate black hole you just fall into. No end to the flavor and you float all the way down. You come back up happy but not sickeningly full. Neat idea.",0,0,0,Jocelyn M.,"Watsonville, CA",61,57,9

5.0,7/6/2014,"Alfred Portale is my idea of a chef. He's not spreading himself too thin, not hawking Yogurt, not spending countless hours selling overpriced cookware/food products or playing on reality shows. He's in the kitchen working. At least I think he is.We first visited Gotham over twenty years ago. It is as good today as it was then. We recently celebrated our twenty first anniversary there. Had a bottle of their 30th Anniversary Cuvee Champagne. Delicious. Tuna Tartare, rare duck breast and a specially requested side of frites for me, Terrine and deconstructed Tune Nicoise for my wife. A delicious slice of choclate cake to finish.Many restaurants operate for years and years. Some coast along on auto pilot based on past glories. Gotham has the formula down.

The gf ordered the duck with foie gras which was delectable. My rack of lamb was superb. Cooked to tender perfection. The only thing I could have asked for was for better presentation. The plates all came out a bit messy. For a sparkling start, get the Gotham 30th anniversary Cuvée. Its savory intoxicating effects will definitely add a beautiful highlight to your evening.

The restaurant had a variety of dishes to choose from. I ordered the yellowfin tuna tartar as my first course and the free range chicken as my second course skipping to order another course as the food served was plenty for one person.  My son and my brother ordered roasted yellow and red beet salad as their first course and 28 day dry aged New York steak as their second course and opting a third course too whereas our friend ordered the asparagus salad and confit tomato burrata salad and namin ranch pork chop for the main course.  All the courses our table ordered were delicious.  The servicing staff were very attentive and made sure our table stayed clean, glasses never empty and parties at the table enjoying themselves.  Dessert was recommended however, no one had any room as we were all stuffed.  Though desserts weren't ordered, our waiter provided us after dinner sweets consisting of butter /chocolate mini sponge cake.  Thank you!!!Visiting NYC for the weekend made it more enjoyable by coming here to Gotham.  I will definitely come back here when I am back in NYC.

From the moment we sat down, the service was fantastic. Our waiter started us off with drinks as we took time to look over the menu.Upon our waiter's recommendation, my first and second course were the tuna tartare and the seafood salad.

4.0,6/10/2014,"The food deserves three stars, but I'm giving it four because the service was so freaking fantastic.The food: good, but overpriced and inconsistent. Three of us basically turned our dinner into an 11-course meal. The kampachi sashimi was divine, but the yellowfin tartare was not fresh. Beet salad was good but somewhat uninspiring.The sunchoke veloute was smooth and sultry. The foie gras was everything it should have been: silky, luscious, and over the top. The asparagus and split pea risotto: a tad bitter, and again, uninspiring.The duck: fantastic. The lobster and short rib: the lobster wasn't fresh, the short rib was probably one of the best things on my plate that entire evening. The Niman Ranch rib-eye was good, but $100 good? It could be that by this point the meal was kicking our asses, but it didn't taste $100 good to me. We ended with the key lime pie, which was heavenly (saying a lot given that our sides were splitting). The chocolate cake, while very good, failed to live up to the pie.I'm always irritated when I have to know what to order from a menu and yet the prices are what they are. At this level everything should be good, and definitely everything should be fresh. But alas.The service was really phenomenal though. Attentive, ready with suggestions, and they served up some tawny port on the house when they realized that no, we really were going to shut down the place with them.And I do love the ambiance.

And Gotham surely did not disappoint.The seared foie gras is a must get. The delicious buttery foie gras melts inside your mouth like how amazing foie gras should taste like. The grilled seared top was a nice touch & the thin slice of crostini added a nice crunch. The bits of beets & pistachio added a balance between sweet & savory for the dish. Very good, I must say.I ordered the pork chop. The pork chop is a hefty portion so I gave a good amount to my best friend friend. It might've been too thick of a piece to my liking but the sauce added a nice tart compliment flavor & I liked the balanced between the apricots & the braised kale.The raspberry souffle was very gelatin-like & full of raspberry flavor. If you like more of a cake texture in your souffle, you might not enjoy this dessert as much. I thought the vanilla ice cream added a nice touch to the dessert & helped even out the tartness of the raspberries.Perfect for a date night - dimly lit & intimate. Tables are a little cramped.

4.0,6/3/2014,"Gotham is a ""quintessential"" NYC restaurant (according to their website, of course) with three stars from the NY Times and one Michelin star. I believe that it truly deserves its stellar reputation. The restaurant itself is beautiful. The words 'elegant' and 'upscale' come to mind: open, high ceilings with beautiful drapes of white cloth and fresh flowers throughout. The waitstaff is attentive and knowledgeable, though not up to the level of service at restaurants like Jean Georges or Colicchio and Sons. One thing I noticed is that a majority of the diners seemed to be regulars who were obviously from rich, upper-class families. I sometimes felt a bit out of place.Food was very good. I started with a striped bass ceviche that was light, delicate, and beautifully plated. The only critique I can make is that the dish felt slightly unbalanced, with an overpowering acidity in the sauce. For my entree I had the maine lobster in sauce americaine. This was perfect. The lobster was cooked perfectly and the sauce served as a perfect complement. The braised swiss chard acted as a great side to cut through some of the richness. For dessert I had the spiced pumpkin souffle. Once again, this was almost perfect. The souffle was light, airy, and not too sweet or eggy with a surprisingly rich pumpkin flavor. It was balanced by a mocha panna cotta and cranberry yogurt gelato with pecan crumble. Not the most cohesive dish, but each part of the dessert was delicious.My experience here was top-notch and Gotham deserves its popularity as one of the best in NYC.",0,0,0,Eric K.,"Manhattan, NY",31,30,92

5.0,5/29/2014,"The timing of the three course lunch deal is absolutely on par. First the appetizer, which I got wild striped bass sashimi, then steak, then dessert. As with most high end restaurants, you dont come here for portion size. Huge plates with tiny servings in the middle are the norm, but dont be fooled by the size. The meals are impeccably timed so that you are full by dessert, and the small portions force you to savor every bite and not down the whole meal in a gulp. The service was intuitive and my glass of water was always full. Not used to high end restaurants, I really thought the excessive service in changing utensils was unnecessary. Each utensil was changed for a new course. But I guess this adds to the overall ""fancy"" aura of the restaurant.

We had a wonderful meal--split the beet and seafood salads, both of which I highly recommend--and which had even more layered flavors than the entrees. We both got the miso black cod and it was divine.  Just to balance out my gushing though, I will say the sticky rice that accompanied  the cod could have had more flavor, and at $44 a dish, it really is unacceptable that it didn't.  Upon returning, I would likely get multiple apps and forgo the entree. The only other flaw was the multi-grain roll which I only took a bite of because I am influenced by my dining companion who limits the carbs. This one was easy to take a bite of and put aside.Ended the meal with delicious coffee and the perfect chocolate cake. I am glancing at a review as I write this that bashes the choc cake to smithereens...I will say if I was designing the perfect choc cake, I do prefer one a bit denser (this one is very light and airy) , however it was quite SPECTACULAR--and the perfect way to end a meal in which you are on the full side but like a few bites (oh who am i kidding!?) of sweetness.

It is clear that the people who are raving about this cake have no real palate for chocolate.1. Uneblievably small and overpriced.2. It blatantly tastes like espresso. From the first bite I could tell it wasn't plain chocolate even though it was advertised that way. I actually confirmed that there is coffee in this cake afterwards. 3. Not dense at all - it's mousse-like and light. Not a good or bad thing, just depends on how you like it.4. Not sweet in the slightest. They use dark chocolate and very little sugar - this is a huge huge plus in my opinion. I hate sweet cake.5. Drenched in an unnecessary amount of cocoa powder - it's so drying, you have to take a sip of water with every bite. Why so much cocoa powder?

As part of their 30th anniversary celebration they had a special degustation menu created by Tom Collichio who worked there a number of years ago. Gotham is a great spot that has stood the test of time and still serves some of the best New American cuisine in NY. Rack of Lamb was awesome. Local Bass also very tasty. House made ice creams awesome. Service was top shelf. All and all 4 stars, two thumbs up and A+. A bit more expensive than Craft, Gramercy Tavern or ABC Kitchen but excellent none the less.

But the food at Gotham is great and the service is pleasant, and the Bloody Mary is perfect. I love sea food, so I went for the sashimi appetizer, cod fish as my main and finished with a delicious vanilla parfait dessert. Every dish was amazing, beautifully plated and served on time.

5.0,4/23/2014,"My new favorite restaurant! I went to Gotham with two close friends for my birthday dinner and the overall experience was fantastic.  We started off with yellow fin tuna tartar. The presentation was gorgeous, but I wasn't that impressed with the dish. I thought it had a little too much vinegar. For main course, I ordered the miso marinated black cod and it was extremely flavorful. The fish wasn't too fatty which I was very happy about, and I liked the bok choy and shiitake mushroom that came with it. It's not the most creative dish but it was very well executed and I enjoyed every bite. I didn't touch the rice that came with it. In fact, I thought the dish would have been better if it didn't have rice but that's just a personal opinion. My friends ordered the muscovy duck and the New York steak. I really liked the duck as well. It was cooked perfectly. The meat had this beautiful pink color and it was tender and well-seasoned. I'm not a big steak person but my friend said the dish was tasty so I believe her. As if all that food wasn't enough, we ordered three desserts. It was my birthday so I got the famous Gotham chocolate cake. We also ordered rhubarb soufflé and dark chocolate mousse. The Gotham chocolate cake was without a doubt the best flourless cake I've ever had. I'm not going to describe it, you'll just have to try it. My friends and I agreed that the first few bites of rhubarb soufflé tasted weird. But as we ate more of it, our taste buds started to adjust to it and by the end, we couldn't get enough. The chocolate mousse was the weakest of the three, but it was very good as well. My only critique is that the service could have been a little better. The waiter was helpful but not very attentive. I've had better service elsewhere. If you are thinking about going, just go. You won't regret it.",1,0,0,Lucy H.,"Manhattan, NY",2,5,0
4.0,4/23/2014,"I wish I could give half stars, because this place really deserves four and a half. My critiques may seem minute, but for the price, I really believe service should be immaculate. The scoop: I came here with my parents and fiance for my birthday dinner on a Sunday evening. We waited at the host stand for about five minutes, which is 4.5 minutes too long, in my opinion. Particularly because the three host/hostesses at the podium kept whispering to each other and looking nervous as they periodically looked over their shoulders. The members of my party and I were all silently worrying to ourselves that they had lost our reservation.  When we were then led to our table, it became clear that something was indeed rotting in Denmark. They sat the four of us at a very large square table intended to seat eight.  It was slightly absurd and certainly made dinner less intimate, as we had to actively raise our voices to communicate with each other across the abyss of fine white linens. As it got later and the restaurant emptied out, conversation became much more pleasant, but still, not exactly what I had in mind. We are still unclear as to whether that nice gentleman who came to speak to us about wines was actually a sommelier, but if he was, I'm afraid to say he should be replaced with someone more knowledgable. Whether or not it was his intention to lie, he awkwardly bumbled his way through Italian wine regions with my fiance, who is from Rome. I don't like to cringe at birthday dinners. As for the food, I don't have a single complaint. My mom had to send her lamb back as it wasn't cooked to her taste, but that's what happens when you order lamb chops medium, mom!

5.0,4/14/2014,"For my birthday, the Boyfriend and I decided to have a birthday lunch instead of dinner since we had a pretty full week of plans ahead of us. Gotham offers a regular a la carte menu along with their special $34 Greenmarket Lunch Prix Fixe. We both opted for the Greenmarket Prix Fixe since it seemed like a great deal. You get three options per course, which I thought was an ample selection.When I had made reservations via OpenTable, I made a note about wanting a quieter table since it was a birthday lunch - just the two of us. When we checked in with the maître d', I was greeted with Birthday wishes from both the host and hostess. After we placed our orders (our waiter didn't even bat an eyelid at the fact that we went with the cheaper option), we were given a bread roll with butter. The bread was a bit on the harder side but was a nice segue way into our first course. We both opted for the Wild Striped Bass Sashimi with asian pear, watermelon radish, cucumber, yuzu ginger emulsion and avocado wasabi puree. The avocado wasabi puree was very refreshing and not spicy at all. The wild striped bass was very fresh and  we both quickly gobbled it down.For my second course, I went with the Pan Roasted Hake, served with braised savory cabbage, potato puree and a verjus butter sauce. This was the first time I had foam on my food! The hake was very soft and cooked to perfection. The potato puree was very fragrant and the savory cabbage was very refreshing.The Boyfriend went with the Braised Beef Short Ribs, served with braised greens, roasted root vegetables and parmigiano reggiano. I had a bite of his short ribs and they were very well done. It was soft and tender and very flavorful.For his dessert, he went with the Baba Rum, which is rum cake served with passion fruit cream, whipped chantilly and citrus segments. I had a bite of his rum cake and they definitely did not skimp on the rum. He especially liked the blood orange segments since its a bit more tart.For my dessert, I went with the famous Gotham Chocolate Cake, served with salted almond ice cream. To my surprise, my cake came with a candle (held up by a dollop of cream) and a ""Happy Birthday"" plaque. I loved that they did that without any prompting from the Boyfriend or me - it was such a nice way to end a great lunch. The cake itself was airy and rich at the same time. It tasted like a lava cake but without the gooey chocolate. It wasn't overly sweet and was contradicted nicely by the salty almond ice cream. With every bite, I wished I had more!I really enjoyed my lunch at Gotham. Our waiter was very attentive and personable the entire time. I've been to restaurants where the waiters visibly show their displeasure when you order the cheaper prix fixe rather than a la carte. But this did not happen here at all.

We got no response at all. NONE. The complaint was not a case of  "" we didn't like our steak"". It was a formal complaint of numerous instances of rudeness and unprofessional behavior. The food and drinks are good but not extraordinary by any means. That being said, one would think that they would want to compensate with outstanding service. That goes a very long way and will set you apart even if the menu won't.  However, with management that can't be bothered to reply to a customer, especially one that is virtually their neighbor, says to me they don't appreciate or value patronage. They lost this customer and I don't think they give a sh. There are better places to dine where one does not pay to be treated that way.

Wild Striped Bass Sashimi - asian pear, watermelon radish, cucumber, yuzu ginger emulsion avocado wasabi purée - ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  The best appetizer I've had out of all the restaurants I've been for RW and this dish definitely made everything worth it.  All the flavors and textures came together for a delicious combination.  The sauce on the sashimi made it almost ceviche-like.2.

Gotham Chocolate Cake - served warm with salted almond ice cream - I'm not really a huge fan of chocolate desserts, but since this was THE chocolate cake, I had to get it.  I just now learned that it was flour less, which would explain the almost mousse-like texture it had.  My favorite part was actually the salted almond ice cream with almond chunks in it - I could probably eat a whole pint of this.I would definitely come back and dish out the cash for their actual lunch and dinner menu.",2,1,4,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2170,1311,3573

The noise level was moderate which made it comfortable to talk and enjoy your meal.  They also could provide different table arrangements to accommodate larger family type dinners.    Food:The food was good.  I had tuna tartar which I was told was their signature appetizer. However, I didn't notice any difference between this tartar and a tartar I've eaten at any mediocre restaurant.  Maybe they forgot to add the ""tar"" to the tuna tartar.  My friend had a beets salad.  The salad was good but then again I don't know of too many chefs that can ruin a beets salad.  For my main dish I had black cod.   This was also mentioned as one of their specialty dishes...finally we hit the jackpot!/bulls eye! I highly recommend that you try this dish!   My friend had an aged NY steak.  It was perfectly prepared as ordered and was delicious.  The wine list was somewhat confusing to me.  Normally there are different styles of chardonnay on any wine list.  This list had three wines but they were all of the same style.  It reminds me of the Henry Ford comment ""you can have any color car you want as long as it's black"".  Hey guys, for a change, why you don't add a Californian style Chardonnay to your list.  I know it's my personal preference but for God's sake I'm not the only one in NYC who drinks this type of wine. Service: From start to finish the service was excellent.  We were nicely welcomed and seated promptly.  The waiter did a good job outlining the specials of the evening and describing the menu.  And of course the food arrived ""on-time"".  So, no complaints in the ""service department"".  Conclusion:I might go back to the Gotham to try some of their other dishes but not anytime soon.

A convenient location for an East Village resident like me:) The Wild Striped Bass Sashimi was good--well balanced flavors, but would like to see more of a kick here and there, maybe introduce some citrus flavors? Because striped bass has such a rich texture on its own, even when raw, it needs an acidity to balance out the richness. The wasabi puree was a nice touch but maybe a little superfluous.I had the Parpadelle w/ Braised Short Rib Ragu for the main course. The Short Rib Ragu was everything a well braised beef should be--tender, soft, and warming to the heart. It was a nice pasta dish for lunch, would have been even better with a nice glass of bolla valpolicella (2012?) to pair with it to cut through the heavy/somewhat fatty texture of the meat. Remembered to ask for extra shaved parmesan and sea salt on the side:)The meal was finished off with the classic gotham chocolate cake. The cake was great; dark chocolate was used instead of some cheap, overly sweet milk chocolate that would probably cause chest pains later. The dark chocolate had a bit of a mousse-y texture to it, and paired excellently with the salted almond ice cream, which I believe was the highlight of my dessert.",1,0,1,Joy W.,"New York, NY",216,50,47

5.0,2/24/2014,One of the more memorable michelin rated restaurants that I've been to. The prices were not unreasonable given the quality of the food.The Muscovy duck is one of the top 2 duck dishes I've ever had for sure. It was cooked to perfection with seared foie gras on the side. The ruby port sauce was absolutely delicious and paired so well with the dish. I will return again for sure to try other dishes.,2,0,0,Eva C.,"Queens, NY",151,129,96

5.0,2/22/2014,"I've been wanting to try Gotham Bar & Grill for a year now, and I finally found the time to go. I was impressed as soon as I walked in - the restaurant was beautifully decorated in white for Christmas. It was pretty empty at 12, but by 1 it was full, so definitely make a reservation!The food was exceptional and presentation was beautiful for every single dish. Service was top notch as well. I started with the seafood salad, which included pieces of shrimp, scallop, squid, and octopus, as well as fresh avocado and fish roe - it was absolutely delicious. I don't usually like squid and octopus, but I treasured every bite because everything was tender and seasoned to perfection.My boyfriend started with the duck and foie gras appetizer, it was a very interesting and tasty mixture of duck, foie gras, and pistachios. It looked like a small portion, but it was very very dense.For the main course, we both ordered the miso black cod. I absolutely loved it. It came on a bed of delicious bok choy and shiitake mushrooms that tasted authentically asian. The cod was perfectly moist and melted in my mouth. The rice was well-made as well. My only criticism would be that the sauce may have been just a little bit too tangy, but that didn't detract too much from this masterpiece of a dish.For dessert, we shared the Gotham chocolate cake. It was very sweet and satisfying, with a remarkably light mousse-like texture while still being extremely rich. Highly recommended.The food is pricy, but I truly enjoyed my meal at Gotham Bar & Grill and I can't wait to go back.",0,0,0,Christine Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",337,354,172

4.0,2/16/2014,"There are some places you walk into and can't help but be won over by. Without a doubt, Gotham Bar and Grill falls into this category. Having passed this restaurant numerous times on my walks to and from Union Square, I had always been forced to peer enviously at the diners inside. When a rare half-day of work coincided with a visit from a good friend of mine, I immediately made a lunch reservation to take advantage of the Greenmarket Lunch Prix Fixe.On the afternoon of, we easily found our way to the front doors and stepped inside. I was awestruck at the interior; I tried my best to take in the high ceiling, ornamented with voluminous drapes of cloth around the lights. The floors made way for seemingly endless rows of tables, each neatly covered with a white tablecloth and sparkling silverware. It was almost as picturesque as the garden view from the expansive windows towards the rear of the restaurant. Conversations were held in hushed tones, and  the simple act of walking towards our seats seemed enough to break the ambiance. In a nutshell, Gotham has all the elements of modernism, simplicity, and elegance, creating the perfect dining environment for an intimate meal.We decided on our three courses for lunch, and right after our orders were taken, were presented with a roll and a serving of butter, which segued quickly over to our first courses - a velvety butternut squash soup. I had made my decision with some hesitation, as my few prior experiences with this vegetable had resulted in a cloyingly sweet, almost sickening, concoction. This was one instance where taking a risk paid off, though; Gotham's version was able to rein in the overdose of sweetness I was expecting, and bring out the true flavor of the butternut squash. It was further enhanced a few cubes of apple, potato, and bacon, and topped off with a small dollop of sour cream.Once our first courses were finished, our bowls were quickly taken away and replaced with our entrees. My braised short ribs were a treat for the eyes as well as the tastebuds; the centerpiece was between a fluffy mound of pureed potatoes and a small pile of cubed root vegetables. Each bite was full of flavor, a gentle reminder of how fresh vegetables should taste. The star was very much the protein, however. There was need for a knife as the meat was so tender, it fell apart at the touch of the fork, and was further enhanced by the red wine sauce. It is a dish that is satisfying in flavor and depth, and I easily cleaned my plate.And dessert. I instinctively selected the famed Gotham Chocolate Cake, despite the fact that chocolate is not usually my first choice in sweets. The slice came out with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream flecked with crushed almonds, and appeared deceptively simple at first glance. The cake is a lesson in contradictions - airy, but rich; sweet, yet with bitter undertones - it was less cake, and perhaps more mousse, but even that would not be a correct description. Each bite left me even more and more puzzled as to how exactly it had been created; but regardless, it is quite the treat for any chocolate lover.Gotham, for your wonderful environment, the detail placed in each of your plates, and service that goes above and beyond... that Michelin star is well deserved.",5,2,6,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827
5.0,2/15/2014,"I came here for one of my mutiple birthday meals with my best friends and it was delicious!! I had the risotto for my starter and was followed by the duck. Both was absolutely divine. I have to admit though the risotto was just a tad more amazing. The rice was sooo fluffy and flavorful and there was a hint of bacon with each bite. MMM MMM MMMMz. For a michelin star restaurant, I was not disappointed whatsoever. It definitely wouldn't be an everyday meal because with 2 dishes + 1 drink, the bill came out to a little $100 a person after tax and tip.

Our entrees were pretty decent, but it didn't exactly blow me away. We had the 28 Day Dry Aged New York Steak which was good, but a tad bit over cooked, and the Muscovy Duck has a very gamey taste which is good, but a bit overwhelming.

I was having a bout of indecisiveness so I heavily leaned on him for suggestions.  He said ""Don't worry I will take care of you"" and he did.  His first suggestion was The Royal cocktail which was refreshing and different.  It smelled like a lemon drop but was smooth with hints of basil.  I had no idea which direction I wanted to go for my entree....poultry, beef, fish....I was spinning.  He said ""get the pork chop, it will not disappoint"".  He was right and I was very happy with this classic dish.  I have been here twice and have always left satisfied but next time I will ask to sit in Robert's section.",2,2,3,Melissa R.,"Washington, DC",569,543,1069

I liked that the duck was done closer to medium versus medium rare as some places do. The foie gras on this dish was cooked more thoroughly than the appetizer. I would recommend this dish.Earl Grey Soufflé - Undercooked. But if you ask about it, they'll tell you that the jiggly custard like center is caused by the earl grey tea being poured over the top of the soufflé. Does that sound right to you? I would think the top of the soufflé would sink in...  Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this if you want a fluffy light soufflé.I forget what the bf ordered for his entree as I did not try it.

5.0,1/26/2014,"This is not a restaurant: it's an institution. My very first meal of my life in NYC was here. I came in 1989, my junior year, to visit schools and met my parents here. Dad used to stay at the Regency for work so we stayed there and cabbed to the Village (Dad didn't do the subway but once or twice). A colleague of his took him here and he wanted me to see it. In the early 1990s, I ate here a handful of times with Dad's colleague, with whom I stayed weekends when my dorm in New Haven was truly the size of a closet and I was going mad without any peace and quiet. Cut to 2012 when I went to have a drink and appetizer at the bar. I will NEVER forget the special (vegetarian) entree. I *never* waste a meal in a fancy restaurant on something vegetarian but if everything those people ate were like this, I could almost understand it. Root veggies with three sauces: it looked more like a work of art in a museum than food. It's a gorgeous space, somewhat different from the early 1990s but not that much. Great crowd. Exquisite food. Perfect drinks. Excellent service. And prices to match all of this. If I had a lot of money, I'd eat here once a month.

1.0,12/27/2013,"I cannot believe I am giving Gotham anything but 5 stars. I've been going here since it opened 30 years ago. Been maybe 50 times. Admired everything from the menu to the architecture of the plates to the energy of the space. Yes, I had been noticing a bit of a decline in the service in recent visits and the menu seemed a bit tired around the edges but it remained close to our hearts even after we moved to Massachusetts so much so it became our family's annual post-Xmas holiday meal... until today. From the moment we waited 15 minutes for our table and then they crammed our 7 on a six (clearly haven given ours away) and the hostess simply said someone else had REQUESTED the larger table and we should have too but we could ""wait and see if something opened up"" when we have sat at the same table every year for 30 years and never been crammed on a six, we should have known. From the moment no one took our order for 15 minutes. From the moment we looked at the menu and saw of the 5 appetizer choices for lunch THREE were cold seafood, one was a salad, and one was a terrine -- nothing warm... in December?. From the moment we saw three of the ten dishes for app or main were duck. From the moment it took 10 minutes for a glass of wine to arrive.... we should have known. The food was FINE, not great. One app was put down which such force that the sauce spilled on the tablecloth and no one did anything. And then it got worse. The waiter poured the last drop of our wine and walked away without asking if we wanted another for 20 minutes when our mains had been served. Three people ordered THE BURGER because the rest of the mains looked unappealing and two came incorrect. The one requested without the mayo-like dressing came with it (but they checked the other one BY LIFTING UP THE BUN AT THE TABLE to see if they put the mayo-less one down wrong). The one ordered rare came medium in half and then WELL DONE in the other and when sent back another was not sent out! NOR DID THE WAITER ASK. This was a burger! How does a place like Gotham screw that up and then not make right? By now we were livid but making the best of it. It really was comical. We laughed until the hostess started lingering by our table to listen to what we were saying but NEVER asked us what was wrong and if anything could be done. The manager came over when we saw them staring at us by the front and waved so they knew we saw and thought we wanted him to come over (we did not) and was such a condescending ass that I cannot believe someplace like Gotham would ever employ him. The rest of the meal? The miso cod, a signature dish, was tired and fine but presented flat with a big scoop of white rice blandly filling the middle of the plate -- look it up online and you will NOT see that photo I assure you. The steak came with a flat presentation worthy of a wonderful tavern, not the joy of Gotham. In the end, we all lost our appetite for lunch and for Gotham. Part of our family still lives around the corner or nearby so they may give it another shot. We sadly moved from NYC so we can't risk it happening again. Goodbye Gotham. May NO ONE have this experience there. May it just be an exception (though it can't just be the holidays because we've been going on the same day for five years now). But be forewarned. No one there did anything to make it better when we were there. No one. We'll stick with Danny Meyer's places and those that have never let us down. So sad and disappointed.

4.0,12/26/2013,"I came here for lunch with my boyfriend today. We made a reservation for noon, which is when they open. It was completely empty when we sat down, however, by 1 pm, the place was pretty packed.The service was great - my water glass never got more than half empty and I was offered bread 3 times. I took the first two rolls, as they were warm and delicious.My boyfriend ordered the pre-fixe and I ordered the miso cod and we kind of shared his extra 2 courses. The soup he ordered was a vegetable puree soup - I haven't had anything like it before, it was really tasty but also very rich.He had the goat cheese ravioli for his main course. This was very, very buttery, but also quite tasty. He's vegetarian so he ordered it without the lamb shank. It was a pretty small portion, however, with how rich it was, it was more than enough food.I ordered the miso cod, which was incredible. The fish was well cooked, maybe even a bit under cooked, which is how I like that dish prepared. It came with some rice, bok choy and mushrooms presented very well. The vegetables were well cooked and seasoned perfectly. I really enjoyed this dish and would return just to have it again.The final course was chocolate cake with almond ice cream. The ice cream was a bit strange - it was quite salty, which I really enjoyed, however, my boyfriend found it a bit off-putting. The cake was dark and decadent, a nice end to the meal.Overall, it was a great lunch, but I'm not in the habit of spending $80 on lunch so we'll probably only come back on special occasions.",0,0,0,Thao L.,"Manhattan, NY",30,174,1

I went to the bar with a large group, most of us being Asian. I encountered a very rude and racist bartender (bald African American man), who immediately disliked our presence at the bar. As he was serving us our drinks, he stopped mid way saying ""Are you guys even old enough, let me see your ID's."" We were all over 21 and showed our ID's. A few of us had the new NY drivers license and I guess he wasn't used to seeing them because he remarked, ""Oh yeah I know all about those China town fake ID's.""

We also had a salad that was...well...just a salad, nothing special :/My friend and I both had the snapper for our main course (which sort of annoyed me because I tried to push him towards the lamb chops - that way I could taste both main dishes and feed the cravings of my inner fat girl), but he wasn't having it, that bum. The snapper just sounded way too good to the both of us, and it was. For dessert we did gelato, which was fine.

4.0,12/9/2013,"Came here to celebrate my birthday with my boyfriend. I love this place for its atmosphere, the service, and the food. I wanted to give 5 stars but comparing to some other places' food I decided to give it a 4-star. Why? Because I think the food can be more creative. We ordered scallop as appetizer.  It was very delicious and the plating was beautiful. We told them we were gonna be sharing, so they considerately separated the plates before serving. Then we had our second AMAZING dish -- white truffle. I was eye-openning. I like how they serve truffle with rice soup and egg. I could feel the flavor and smell of truffle melted into the rich and smoothy rice soup. Next is the main courses. I got market sword fish. Though sword fish by nature is a bit dry anywhere, they did a good job. The fish was served with all kinds of fresh vegies, and topped with foam. I'm not sure what sauce they used in there, but it tasted a bit sour. I guess there's lemon juice. This dish was fresh, light and healthy. Good plating as well. I'm very satisfied. The only downside is, still, not creative enough. My boyfriend got duck with foie gras. It seems that everyone else recommended it. Good choice. I had a bit of everything in his plate. The foie gras was very very good. The duck has almost no fiber in -- which I found amazing. There is a half peach, however, that I didn't enjoy that much. But overall, it is a great dish to order.

5.0,10/28/2013,"We've been to many expensive restaurants and had many memorable meals over the years. But there was just something so *special* about the lunch we had at Gotham Bar & Grill during Restaurant Week.I was impressed from the moment we walked in. High ceilings, tall windows, & large bowls of live orchids in whites & greens. We had a 12:45 reservation, and we only waited a few minutes to be seated as they cleaned our table. I was delighted as we were brought to a table at the back of the restaurant, with a view of the lovely plants in their courtyard. The tall windows accentuate the high ceilings of the restaurant, giving it an open, yet still intimate, feeling. The dining volume was perfect -- the restaurant was busy, crowded, and every table was full; yet, our conversation was easy and neither of us had to raise our voices above normal levels.Despite the increased Restaurant Week traffic, our server made us feel like we were VIPs from the moment we walked in. He was so informed, so professional, and was able to answer all of my questions about the prix fixe menu. And I loved how the silverware was carried in small boxes & polished before each course arrived. And the food! Ah the food. Each dish was perfectly portioned; simple yet incredibly flavorful & each plate felt so ... complete. Here are the menu items we chose, along with the two glasses of the recommended Riesling:My meal:Chilled Corn Soup - One of my questions to our server was about the heat level of the chipotle foam. I have a terribly low tolerance for anything spicy, and he was able to accurately describe how spicy it would be (just enough for me to feel like a daredevil, but not that much if you're into spicy food). The soup itself was delicious: smooth, fresh-tasting, with just a hint of spice & a handful of freshly cooked corn kernels. I'd order that soup every time -- and have I mentioned that I hate soup?Grilled Beef Strip Loin - Corn was clearly the featured ingredient of the day, and it was just as delicious in the entree. And the polenta added that necessary starch that rounded out the plate. But the real star of the show (obviously) was the beef. I've never had a piece of meat cooked better than this one. Pink in the middle, so tender & juicy ... and I would've licked the sauce off the plate if the restaurant wasn't so classy. My gosh, it was fabulous.Raspberry Cremeux - You'll rarely see me turn down a dessert made of berries, and I'm glad that I chose this over the chocolate cake. The cremeux was sweet & bursting with fresh raspberries. There was an accompanying crumble, and a few other berries scattered around the plate. It was satisfying, light, and refreshing. Definitely on the sweeter side ... just how I like it!His meal:Gotham Chopped Salad - My man said that this is one of the best salads he's ever had. Everything was fresh, and it was topped with some fresh corn (as per the featured fresh veggie of the month).Pan-roasted Fluke - He really loved the flavor, texture, and sauce on the fish. I think he mentioned that the accompanying sauce was a little spicier than I would've been able to handle.Gotham Chocolate Cake - (Disclaimer: I don't like chocolate cake that much.) We both tried the chocolate cake, which tasted better than most chocolate cakes I've had. It was a little denser than I prefer; I was a lot happier with the Raspberry Cremeux. He's not really into berries, so he was very happy with the chocolate cake. Win-win, I guess?After our meal, we couldn't stop talking about how great of an experience we had at Gotham Bar & Grill. We did a quick search to see if other reviews shared our joy, and ... what? A Michelin Star?! Leave it to us to ""accidentally"" book a reservation at what I could easily say is one of the best restaurants in NYC!

5.0,10/8/2013,"This place is absolutely fantastic - for the food, the service and the entire ambiance of the restaurant.  We arrived for NYC Restaurant Week for lunch and we were completely amazed by the entire dining experience even starting off with the complimentary bread and butter!  These restaurant weeks made fine dining (Michelin star rated restaurant) very affordable for people who like me who thoroughly enjoy high quality made dishes but don't necessarily have the bank roll.  At $25/person, we were beyond ecstatic.  The bread is that perfect crunchy and warm soft middle.  So fresh, so delicious.  My absolute favorite was the chilled corn soup (normally $18).  I just could not get enough of this refreshing and subtly sweet taste.  We also had the striped bass ceviche (normally $21), berkshire porkchop (normally $38) and the white cod (normally $39).  All were extremely well prepared and not a single bit of food left on the plates.  We finished off our lunch with ice cream and sorbets (normally $12) and oh boy was this satisfying.  Fresh fruit combined with housemade sorbets and jellys...

The ambiance is great and the service is impeccable.Before we started with the food, we had the prosecco and a cocktail called ""royal"". The prosecco was very good and brut. I also very much liked the royal, but it has a very strong thai basilicum tasted almost medicine like. Either you love it or you hate it.I've had maya shrimps for the first time in my life and they were by far the best shrimps I've ever eaten. Yet, they were served head-off (I heard some people like to take the head off and suck it). My wife had the seafood salad which was also very good but I'd prefer the shrimps. I continued with the gazpacho which had an orange color instead of the traditional dark red but the tomtoes they used were particularly tasteful and fruity. Our main courses were the duck and the cod - both dishes among the best duck and cod we've ever eaten. The cherry clafoutis were the perfect finish of our meal.As we did not want to go for a full bottle of wine, we asked for recommendations by the glass. I had the Barbera and my wife the white Burgundy wine. Both wines worked very well with the entrees!The chef recommends ordering three courses.

I was happy to see that in addition to their menu they also have specials AND a small seasonal menu. Great touch. I ended up with an appetizer of soft shell crabs which was complex yet light and delicious. I'm such a sucker for soft shells and these were great. They had a lot of asian flavors that worked wonderfully together. Then, as my main course, I had the winner of the night, the Muscovy duck prepared medium rare, with foir gras, plums, quinoa, and a port sauce. It was heaven. I love duck and this had to be one of my favorite duck preparations. We then closed with the largest key lime pie portion I've ever seen and called in a night. Yes, the pie was great.

Here's what my $25 got me:  Gotham Chopped Salad (beefsteak tomatoes, corn, sugar snap peas, radish, plums, blue cheese, fines herbs, buttermilk) - Really simple and delicious salad.  Grilled Beef Strip Loin (w/ sweet corn polenta, braised swiss chard, bordelaise sauce) - While the strip loin itself wasn't fantastic and was served at room temp, the swiss chard and polenta were delicious enough to save this dish. A few dips in the sauce and you can overlook the fact it was prob under a heat lamp for a while. The serving size wasn't large, but enough to fill you up while leaving room for dessert. Gotham Chocolate Cake (served warm with salted almond ice cream) - One of the best slices of cake I've ever had. It was soft, moist and not too rich. The complimenting salted almond ice cream was a perfect touch. So good.  Wine Pairing: Dry Riesling, Hermann J. Wiemer, Finger Lakes, Ny 2012 - An extra $10, but very light and fresh.

But this was the first time I was dining their without the presence of an adult figure (I'm 18). My boyfriend knew Gotham was my favorite restaurant, so he saved up enough 'pocket change' to take me. My mother immediately warned us that we may be treated differently because we are not if age to order alcohol. This was not the case whatsoever. The second we walked in the maitre d was polite and welcoming. We were given a table inbetween two other couples. The table was situated in a private area away from the hustle and bustle of the dining room. But not far away enough to feel like we had been pushed to the side. Once we sat down, our waiter greeted us with a smile. He proposed a drink (I guess we appeared of age), but we declined. This did not change his attitude in the least. We ordered our appetizers, he got the foi gras terrine, while I got the risotto. I can't speak for him, but mine was OUTSTANDING. I love risotto in general but the combination of tangy notes contrasted by the bacon, really made this dish wonderful. For our next course, we both ordered the steak, a signature staple on the Gotham menu. It was delicious and cooked perfectly, as expected. For dessert, I ordered the chocolate cake, while he had the 's'mores sundae.' Both were incredible and the almond ice cream that came with the chocolate cake was incredible.

Definitely seemed more of an (ahem) well-heeled crowd when we arrived (I think our reservations were at 8PM) but there were some younger (30s-ish) patrons that arrived later. Dishes sounded more traditional on the menu but were creatively paired and beautifully presented. Ordered the soft shell crab (one of the daily specials) as an appetizer based on the recommendation of the waiter and it was amazing. I was amazed at the size of the crab - typically soft-shell crab legs are pretty skinny but these were actually quite meaty and juicy. It was paired with a puree that was really flavorful and a yuzu foam - normally I am anti-foam but this one had so much flavor and it actually blended in well with the puree, lending it a juicy acidity. We also had a chilled corn soup that had a lobster fritter - also incredibly delicious, and the fresh sweetness of the corn really shone. For my entree I had the Maine lobster and this is probably one of the best-cooked lobsters I've ever had. The tail meat was perfectly roasted, and the claws were enormous and butter poached. Beautifully presented too. Gah, just remembering this meal is making me wish I could go back and have this meal again!

5.0,7/7/2013,"Dinner at Gotham is a must if you're looking for somewhere nice to splurge. After mentioning it in conversation a few times, my friend and I decided to finally make a dinner reservation for 6:30pm here on a Sunday night.The restaurant was surprisingly very empty when we arrived, but by the time we left (around 9pm) it was almost entirely full, which I found very odd for a Sunday night. Another thing I found unusual: the number of families dining there with small children. The table next to us had two preschool-age children, and Gotham seems to be very good at accommodating small kiddies - I overheard the waiter offering the kids a plate of chicken with shoestring potatoes, which was obviously not on their normal dinner menu.As for our own food, my friend and I decided to share two appetizers: the striped bass ceviche and yellowfin tuna tartare. Our waiter kindly offered to split each appetizer into two separate plates for us, which saved us the trouble of having to halve everything ourselves. The striped bass ceviche came with several pieces of fish topped with leaves and citrusy bits, and the waiter poured a slightly spicy Thai broth into the dish. I'd never had striped bass ceviche before, and found it interesting because it tasted less raw than other ceviches I've had, but the Thai and citrus flavors were great. Our second appetizer, the yellowfin tuna tartare, came centered neatly on a plate, with two pieces of toasted bread and surrounded by cucumber slices dotted with Asian ginger vinaigrette. Ceviches and tartares are probably my two favorite types of raw fish dishes, but when it came to these two appetizers, I definitely liked the tuna tartare more - the tuna was so nicely complemented by the cucumber slices and toasted bread.For my entree, I ordered the Berkshire pork chop. The pork was very tender and I liked the sauce. Unfortunately, the waiter gave me a very dull knife so cutting the pork was quite a struggle. I wasn't a huge fan of the vegetables (mainly the roasted fennel) that came on the side, either. While taking a break from sawing away at my pork, I also tried a bite of my friend's entree, the Maine lobster, which tasted buttery and delicious. The broth that it came in tasted like lobster bisque.Being the gourmands (read: fatties) that we are, we also decided to split a dessert. We went with the apricot souffle, which was unbelievably good. The texture of the souffle was super light and fluffy. The apricot flavor was present but not overly sweet, and my first thought upon taking a bite was, ""This would make a great tea flavor."" The souffle also came with apricot sorbet, panna cotta (extra delicious!), and apricot slices on the side, all very nicely completing the apricot palette. Then, just when we thought we'd finished with all of our dinner courses, we were also given a small cup of complimentary, bite-size financiers that came in 3 different flavors: pistachio, almond, and chocolate.

It was a bit of kale and a mesclun mix, the parmesan dressing was fantastic. I then had the razor clam chowder. Again this is really more of a seafood chowder because there's more of a lobster taste (it's a lobster broth) than clam, this was very very good. I really liked the Old Bay foam. My main was the lamb chops which were fantastic. Then I had dessert of strawberry coulis which was ok. This wasn't bad but it wasn't great.I was dining by myself and I appreciated that I wasn't treated differently as I sometimes have felt at other high end restaurants. The sommelier visited me and recommended some great wines and my server was 5 star all the way. The tables are very close together. In fact, there was a table of 3 seated near me that asked to be moved so that they would have more space. Not a big deal, just something I noted. The interior is pretty and it's really easy to get to from Union Square.",0,0,0,Stephanie H.,"Golden, CO",232,451,10
5.0,7/4/2013,"Came here for lunch and ordered off the pre-fix menu, which is an amazing deal!  I got the strawberry and arugula salad, the slow cooked chicken, and the Gotham Chocolate Cake. The strawberry and arugula salad was very fresh and light, and was really delicious.  It is a pretty big portion so I could not finish it because I was trying to save room for the rest of the meal.  The salad came with fresh greenmarket strawberries, hazelnuts, goat cheese, radishes and was coated in a light balsamic vinaigrette.  My sister got the seafood salad, and loved that as well. The chicken not only looked really pretty, but tasted delicious. It was cooked to perfection, as it was still very moist on the inside but crisp on the outside.  The sauce made it even better, and the raisin chutney was amazing.  The couscous was also good, but the chicken and the chutney were the stars of the dish.  My sister also raved about the miso glazed cod, so if you like seafood you should get that.  I tried the sauce and rice that it came with, and can vouch for the fact that the sauce is delicious.  She usually is pretty critical of cod since it can be a hit or miss, but she absolutely loved this dish.  Once we were done, the waiter brought over the coveted dessert menu.  Since I had already scoped out the menu online, I knew what dessert I was getting; the Gotham Chocolate Cake. My sister did not plan on getting dessert since she did not do the price fix, but the seasonal offering today was the coconut dacquoise so she gave in to temptation and ordered it.Oh. My. God.  The chocolate cake was so amazing!  This was one of those situations where I went into lunch with good intentions of only eating half the cake, but ended up finishing it.  I was left with no guilt, however, as it was TOTALLY worth every single calorie.  It is so rich and decadent, yet light and fluffy at the same time, and it just gets better and better with each bite.  It also came with a small scoop of salted almond ice cream and some chocolate crunchies, which were ok but could not even compare to the amazing flavor of the cake.  My sister is not a huge chocolate cake lover, but she took one bite and had the same reaction as me.  In fact, she told me I had to finish it otherwise she would!  The dessert that she got was really good as well, but it just could not compare to the chocolate cake.  Overall, this was an amazing lunch experience.  The decor is very nice and elegant, the service was impeccable and the servers were all very friendly and attentive, and the food was outstanding.  They really pay attention to the details here and every aspect of each course was fresh and flavorful.  The two stars in my eyes were the chicken and the chocolate cake, and my sister said her two favorites were the cod and the chocolate cake.  While it is pricey, we will definitely be back here.  The greenmarket price fix lunch is an amazing deal and you really get your money's worth.  There are many expensive places in the city that are over-hyped and pretentious and the food doesn't live up to the price tag, but at Gotham it is totally worth every cent.  I looked around at the other tables, and everyone was smiling and raving about their food.  Basically, you should save up your money for the week and splurge on a visit here. It will be worth it!",0,0,0,Allie S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,70,166

5.0,6/30/2013,"Gotham is clearly one of my all time favorite  dining spots...we have been to the kingdom of Alfred Portale 6 or 7 times always looking forward to his towering dishes...namely, a ""meaty"" crusty soft shell crab preparation which blew us all away. The 1st course preparation was a refreshing seafood salad in a tangy mixture of sweet shrimp,  spanish octopus, scallops, lobster,squid, avocado well worth the $24 tab( Sorry , I don't mean to be that nonchalant about the worthlessness of the American $ in a top NYC dining emporium, but it's a fact that the ""less well heeled"" must deal with).My wife chose the Muscovey Duck which came with a seared foie gras, carmelized mango, etc....Unfortunately, I prefer FEEDING and not EATING these cute waddling creatures which I frequently find  on our golf course. Moreover,  Muscovey duck,  in my opinion is  a little reminiscent of ostrich which is  not my favorite texture in poultry meat.The Key Lime dessert was the key to ecstacy, if Keylime is your thing.Our table of 4 easily shared the $24 dessert which was created for 2. To be honest , I had one minor disappointment...we were not offered an Amuse Bouche ...somewhat unusual for a restaurant of this caliber.It was hard to depart from the golden warm glow of Gotham's classic setting.The staff was friendly & always there without being intrusive.

5.0,6/24/2013,"I enjoyed my meal here completely. Almost everything we ordered was delicious. Razor clam chowder - slightly on the watery side but still very tasty and fresh. Tuna tartare - Fresh fish. All the flavors went well together. Foie gras terrine - This was my least favorite dish. Was slightly dry and couldn't taste the foie gras too much. seared foie gras - Delicious. I wish I ordered another one. miso marinated black cod - the cod was cooked perfectly. The cod had huge meaty chunks that fell off and the miso sauce was tasty. Muscovy duck - one of my favorite dishes. the duck, the foie gras and the sauces were all delicious in one bite. Each element complemented each other. Gotham chocolate cake - Texture is different from regular chocolate cake. Kind of a cross between mousse and cake? Hard to describe. I can imagine, if you like chocolate, that this would be very tasty. small Madeleine - there were 3 different flavors. Each one was tasty and a good end to our great meal.",7,4,5,Hae A.,"Los Angeles, CA",503,657,135
5.0,6/23/2013,"I'm still dreaming about this dinner! To start with, their whole grain bread is delicious!  I don't even like bread!  I had two or three pieces before the meal which is highly unusual for me.  For my main I went with their signature dish - the miso marinated black cod.  The fish flaked off perfectly.  It was cooked to perfection.  I had been a little worried that the combination of the lemongrass ginger sauce would be too much with the mushrooms and soy, but it all complimented itself so well!  My expectations had been blown out of the water.Then we got to the dessert course.  I normally don't much go for dessert either.  Yes, I know.  No bread, no dessert... I'm a total weirdo.  My mouth is still watering just thinking of the vanilla sorbetto with diced mango, coconut, passion fruit cream andcoconut sorbet.  It was heavenly.  I could have eaten three more plates of it at least.  It is an expensive restaurant, but if you have a reason to splurge it's safe to say you will love this restaurant and not be disappointed in any way.",0,0,0,Jamie S.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,15,8

5.0,6/18/2013,"Finally had dinner at Gotham. The space is massive, and the clientele a bit on the older side. We had to wait a while despite having a reservation, but the place was packed as it was a Friday night, so not surprising. Everything we had from start to finish was crisp, clean, and flavorful. My mom and I started with the Seafood Salad, which was tossed in a citrus vinaigrette. All the various seafood was cooked perfectly, and though light, it was quite filling. JB had the foie gras and loved it. For mains, I had the special soft shell crab. The portions were surprisingly large, and the presentation beautiful. Mom had the cod which she enjoyed, and JB had the lamb which is he said was the best he'd ever had in the city. Dessert was a great treat. We all ordered one and shared - the meyer lemon cloud, brownie, and chocolate cake. The chocolate cake was rich, dense, and just what you want out of a chocolate cake. The brownie and cloud were both deconstructed in presentation, and all the various pieces made for an amazing dessert.",2,0,0,Monica B.,"New York, NY",6,159,11

5.0,6/3/2013,Hands down The best food I have eaten in NYC in years.We started with soft shell crab and it was prepared so the taste was light and delicious. The shell was crispy without a hint of oil or deep frying.Second course consisted of a 30 day aged ribeye that was incredible along with Maine lobsters that were broiled to perfection and served outside the shell. Even the desserts were fantastic. We had a house made (whole) key lime pie and a chocolate cake.  The bill for four was hefty ($1500 pre tip) but consider $900 of that was champagne and wine.  The food is worth every penny but the wine is very overpriced.,0,0,0,Ralph A.,"San Diego, CA",46,51,1

It's always a concern that when you say you don't drink, you'll be getting terrible service because the bill won't be as high, but they could not have been more accommodating.

5.0,5/27/2013,"Class, quality, beauty, customer service, and OMG the food! Five Stars without a nano-second of hesitation.Had lunch for four today. The restaurant is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful, Billowing fabric surrounds the many ceiling light fixtures. White linens and plants and flowers everywhere. It seemed as though there were a dozen different people servicing our table all of the guys were polite and courteous as could be. We were given one small dinner roll each as we sat done along with a big disk of the butter for the table. The rolls were so good they vanished quickly, but no worries-- seconds and thirds came out just as fast, The second batch was so hot it was impossible to hold it to cut it in half -that's not a complaint, its just an indication of how fresh it was. Three in our party had the Tagliatelle carbonara served with an egg on top. Everyone loved it. I had the Miso Marinated Black Cod ($25) served with bok choy, shiitake mushrooms and sticky rice in a soy lemongrass ginger sauce. My fish was absolutely divine. Tender, PERFECTLY cooked to the point that I could separate the layers in the fillet with my fork. It was served with 4 baby bok choy stalks that were equally delicious, as was the rice and sauce. This dish may have been the best fish dish I ever had in my life.We all had dessert -4 different kinds, a S'More Sundae (toasted meringue, marshmallow, dark chocolate graham cracker ice cream for $14), a slice of the Gotham Chocolate Cake (served warm with seasonal ice cream for $13), a Key Lime Cremeux (basil olive oil cake, rhubarb compote, coconut sorbet), and a sorbet of the day - coconut served with cake crumbles and thinly sliced pineapple. The pineapple was sliced on a meat cutter -it was so razor thin and delicate I didn't even recognize the taste. I knew it was something familiar, but I couldn't place it. It was delicious.Four lunch entrees, four desserts, 3 coffees ran about $170.

5.0,5/22/2013,"This was the first Michelin restaurant I'd ever been to, and boy did it deliver! The food was phenomenal. I'm sure some dishes do disappoint a little, all places with this much hype have that downside. But overall, the food was memorable.Space: elegant, not trendy but not dated either. Very white but not stuffy either. Don't look at the ceiling though, it's ugly.Service: some reviewers have lauded the service but I found it disappointing. Nothing like MK in Chicago. The waitress was friendly but not helpful. She evidently didn't know anything about wine because at the mention of it she called one of the 3 sommeliers to come assist me, who was a snobby jackass who looked down his nose at me with total pretention because i didn't want to spend $100+ on a bottle. He was putting his quota far ahead of his pride in the wine selection, which makes him a horrible person. The waitress also gave no explanation of, or invitation to, any of the dishes. She was kind of like a robot who was only supposed to write down the orders. Whatever. The food: exceptional. 3 courses are perfectly filling even for big appetites, and won't cost you more than $100, so it's actually pretty good value. I had bay scallops with some delicious foamy broth for an appetizer, very fresh and flavorful. The seasonal special, pigeon (squab), for my entree -- what a symphony of flavors! I'd dare to call it a perfect dish. One leg and one thigh, perfectly braised, with a delicious red wine cabbage reduction sauce, served with a few potato gnocchi, house mustard, AND an exceptional slab of foie gras on a bed of pear compote. The flavors were great individually and collectively. Dessert: the famous (flourless) chocolate cake. Believe the hype. Get it.My girl's dishes were all great too: an exceptional yellow fin tartare, aged duck breast (can be poorly executed at many places but spot on at Gotham) and the pear soufflé.",0,0,0,Jacob W.,"Chicago, IL",0,59,0

5.0,5/17/2013,"I came here for a weekend dinner with a large group of friends. We made a reservation ahead and we were seated promptly when we arrived. I really lied the overall ambiance of the place. It's classy and upscale, but not overwhelmingly so. The staff was quite friendly and attentive to our needs too. The complimentary bread served in the beginning was quite good too; there are three kinds of of bread to choose from and I personally enjoyed the garlic focaccia the most.As for the food, I really couldn't complain about any of the dishes I ordered. I started off with Spring Vegetable Risotto. The portion was appropriate considering that it was a second course, and a good amount of mint made the dish delightfully flagrant. All the ingredients came together quite nicely. For the main dish, I ordered Muscovy Duck, which was the best duck dish I've ever had. The duck was cooked perfectly medium-rare and I loved the caramelized mango and foie gras that came on the side as well. And for the dessert, I ordered their famous Gotham Chocolate Cake. I must say the cake was one of the best cakes I've had. It was so chocolatey, yet light and moist. The almond ice cream that was served on the side went perfectly with the cake as well.I also got try a bit of my friends' Miso Marinated Black Cod, which I thought was amazing. But my friend thought the marinade was too salty and greasy although the fish itself was perfectly cooked. So if you don't like food that is on the salty side, stay away from the cod. (The duck did not have that issue though). My friends also ordered the Striped Bass Ceviche, Razor Clam Chowder, New York Steak and Rack of Lamb, and they all said they thoroughly enjoyed their food.Overall, this was one of the finest dining experiences I've had at New York. It's definitely pricey, but I think it's well worth it judging by the quality of the food and service they offer. Make sure to make a reservation ahead though, since it gets quite packed for dinner time. I also recommend that you dress up (at least wear a dress shirt if you are a guy, and a dress if you are a girl). Although I saw some people just wearing t-shirts and jeans, most of the people are dressed quite nicely; it's just a good excuse to put on some of the finest clothes you have and enjoy their classy, yet inviting environment.",2,0,2,Elle C.,"Manhattan, NY",21,331,0

3.0,3/20/2013,"Very nice. The service was pretty good and very professional. It took about a minute for the hostess/host to acknowledge we were standing there, but after that it was all business. We sat on the side and had a great view of the entire restaurant. Quite busy already at 7:00 PM on a Wednesday night. My feeling is that most people were on an expense account, therefore the wine and food was flowing. The wine selection from our waiter was great and the bread was very nice. I had the yellowfin tartar which was a bit spicy, but very tasty and filling. My wife had the special salad for the day which she enjoyed. I ordered the pork chop. That baby was thick and cooked to perfection, but unfortunately a bit tougher than I had thought it should be. My wife had the risotto which was amazing. It took awhile then for the waiter to take our dessert order. We had the house-made sorbet and ice cream. Very good. Although it did not apply to our table, but at a table of four, four staff served the meals at the same time. That is classy. Mostly parties and hardly any couples here.

5.0,3/12/2013,"Gotham's prix fixe lunch was one of the most outstanding meals I've had in this city of culinary oohs and ahhs. The creamy and sweet flavors of the celery pomegranate soup passed the baton perfectly, while the chicken entree with its crispy skin was surrounded by an adoring entourage of complex textures and tastes ranging from fruity to tart, more enticing than any chicken dish had a right to be. Matched with a crisp sauvignon blanc and capped with a refreshing dessert of panna cotta, the meal left me stuffed yet floating. Oh, and the waiter was simply fantastic.

5.0,2/24/2013,"I had dinner here on January 30th. My assistant got us a dinner reservation, partly because she saw that Gotham was participating in Restaurant Week. When we got to the restaurant, we found that Gotham was only participating in the promotion for lunch. Oh well!But we still had a wonderful time. The restaurant was really hopping, and the seating was a bit tight. But after the wine came, we didn't really care. I had the roasted beet and goat cheese salad, and a roasted fish (I think it was the soy-marinated cod). Both were absolutely delicious. I usually don't care too much about plating, but the dishes were strikingly beautiful. The three guys across from me all got the dry-aged New York strip steak. I managed to finagle a bite and it was awesome--meaty, juicy, with a tasty crust. I brought a few friends from Colombia and Peru and they were bowled over by the experience.

3.0,2/16/2013,"Could a man have two disciples more distinctly different than Wylie Dufresne and Bill Telepan? Yet, Alfred Portale, the longstanding head chef of Gotham Bar and Grill, has had both serve as his sous chef, headlining a legacy that saw the meteoric rise of Tom Colicchio and the almost unheralded success of Jason Hall. But for all its storied apprentices, Gotham Bar and Grill does not feel tied to its history. Indeed, overt nods to tradition are nowhere to be found, and the ambiguous striving towards a constant modernity permeates the restaurant. Though the space itself is timeless, it is the attention to detail that betrays the sense of the contemporary. Slim sconces line each pillar, accenting the sweeping vertical lines of the room, and foiling the heavy, looming pendants. The service has been coached in the pomp and subtleties of white coat, with its gentle attempts at reprisals to our adjacent table punctuated with the honorific title of madam. The two older women who received it were neither fazed nor flattered; they just wanted comped wine. But the service, in spite of its subversive grandeur, can be equally affable, charming, and downright genuine. If these two elements are newness shrouded in foregone conventions, the food is the spirit of inventiveness: it bears no disguises. Sadly, a more knowing wink to its origins would have done wonders for its memorability. I started with the Grilled White Tuna, excited at the prospect of a slightly heartier rendition of a rustic Italian classic. The pickled onions seemed to have been somehow both brined for an eternity and freshly plucked from the earth; bright, biting flavors that neither lingered nor overwhelmed. Through one well-executed vegetable, I understood Portale's express commitment to seasonality and locavorism. It was an utter shame then, that little else about the dish felt so gripping. The tuna, while seared flawlessly, was underseasoned on its crust, and the smatterings of dill and unseen splashes of lemon juice did little to save it. The fingerlings and gigande beans became one and the same, collating into something approaching an earthen paste. M's Sunchoke Soup was the wiser choice, the blood orange and satsuma reductions alternately asserting themselves in a soup that seemed to have been strained through a chinois of the gods, luxurious in its smoothness. The freshness of the sunchoke stood up surprisingly well to the cream, no doubt aided by the acidity of the aforementioned fruits. With a quip and a smile, our plates were cleared and we were presented with our entrees. Instinctively, I reached for my camera, before recalling Gotham's universal ban on it. Sadly for Gotham, the presentation of both dishes was quite lovely, and fully deserving of photographing. Perhaps they are scared that people with poor compositional skills will sabotage the kitchen's hard work, but if that is their fear, then they are being terrifically foolish. Any Canon toting boob could capture the architectural achievements on display. Wonderfully crisped chicken perched precariously askance atop a nest of couscous, rife with whole mushrooms and turnip segments, all encircled with a delightfully robust yogurt sauce. Would that the taste had matched the visual and textural sensations. The yogurt simply had to carry too much of the dish, as once again, the meat element was a little bland. Combined with the fact that it wasn't the juiciest piece of chicken it could have been, and once again, M made the better choice, though in this case it was only marginally so. Her salmon, much like my tuna before it, was meant to evoke aspects of the Mediterranean, its black olive vinaigrette and confit tomato a deconstructed tapenade. However, the bitterness of the chard was more aggressive than the sweet licorice taste of the braised fennel, and the salmon, in spite of its crisp skin and tender flesh, was largely forgettable. Our desserts, likely due to their relative simplicity, fared better. You'd have to be quite the misery guts to bemoan warm chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream, but to its credit, the version at Gotham is utterly enjoyable. The cake is not a cloud of chocolate, but neither is it a densely packed nugget. The Sable Breton is likewise unlikely to win any awards for ingenuity, but the combination of maple, oatmeal, and apple is familiar for a reason: it is delicious and should be paired. Gotham Bar and Grill has been a fixture in New York for over a quarter century. But its occasionally lackluster impact does not stem from the restaurant being dated. It instead seeks to buck trends, but in doing so, occasionally misfires. I do not begrudge you your Michelin star, Gotham, and indeed I think the potential is there, resoundingly. But my experience was simply not to that standard.",7,3,3,Jordan S.,"Manhattan, NY",865,273,672

I imagine they are used to bills over $55. Regardless, the food was definitely the best enjoyment/bite/$.  They werent big plates, but the flavors that were built into each one, the textures and the presentation were steller.The Sunchoke Soup came out looking like a large sunny side up egg - the creamy puree had a round center mound of Mandarin emulsion with some blood orange reduction drizzled about.  The play of earthy, sweet, citrusy and a buttery sensation were impeccable.  A great start.  My lunch buddy liked the tuna app, but I didn't try itI ordered the pan roasted salmon, and, while at first glance it appeared a bit overdone on the outside, it was just a thin edge of it was cooked thoroughly, the inside was still most and trending rare toward the middle, just how I like it.  It was well seasoned and in a good sauce, and the escarole was cooked to a softness with a touch of bite to it.  Very nice.My lunch partner had the butternut squash ravioli - very buttery and smooth but not too rich.  yum.Since it was lunch and I didnt want to go to heavy on the dessert I went with the sorbet, each of which was magnificently fresh and flavorful.  A great way to end the meal.  That said, my lunch partner got the caramel panna cotta with maple ice cream and it was soooo good.  Would have been too much midday for me though (she didnt quite finish it either).I WOULD GO BACK ANYTIME (that my wallet sees fit).",1,0,0,Grant B.,"Brooklyn, NY",291,128,28

It was very rich and flavorful. I ordered duck medium rare and surprisingly it was very bland. The wine poached pear that came with it outshined the duck. The black miso cod was not the best cod I've ever had.  It wasn't as flavorful and flaky as I had expected. The timing between the two courses was long. Thankfully their bread is delicious. Gotham redeemed  themselves with dessert. :) The baked apple caramel panna cotta was comforting and the Gotham chocolate cake was divine.  The cake was too rich for my lover but I wouldn't mind having a slice all to myself. I wouldn't eat it in one sitting though. Hehheh Price-wise it's fairly reasonable.

The hostess said it was because our entire party wasn't there (indeed, we were short 1 or 2 people), even though the original response given to my early-arriving friends was that our table would be ready shortly.No matter, it's a popular place and Restaurant Week is a madhouse, so all is forgiven. We received a very nice table on a platform at the back of the room. I started with a lemonade with bitters, a proper apéritif. We also received some fresh bread rolls that kept us happy until the real food arrived.The lightly grilled tuna appetizer, which came with gigande beans, was delicious at the sashimi level of tenderness and equally fresh. My slow-roasted chicken was nothing superlative, but did come fortified with a couscous salad and grilled eggplant, apricot and golden raisin chutney, in a harissa yogurt reduction. In retrospect I'd sample the salmon or butternut squash ravioli, but it's a nice chunk of bird.

This is a large restaurant that was literally packed for Friday with many people waiting. That's always a good sign because it's not easy to have a large restaurant so busy during lunch time.The portions were tiny! but the food was phenomenal. The first few spoons of my milky sunchoke soup were delicious but then I uncovered the sharp citrus center of the plate hidden beneath the milky surface and tangy flavor filled up my palate. So good. Butternut squash ravioli would burst in my mouth filling it with delicious liquid sauce. Not too hot temperature, just perfect. I could eat a pound of them but there were very few very tiny flat ravioli, I should have taken the picture of the plate, how little food was there. If whatever left of my manners allowed I would lick the plate.Then the dessert arrived. I almost took off one star from the review because of the time gap between the entree and the dessert. That was too long. But I won't (take one star off). Anyways, the dessert arrived and it was great (and tiny) as everything else. The combination of flavors is just so good in all the dishes.The restaurant also had great ambiance. The place is perfect to take your client or someone special to.

3.0,1/14/2013,I thought this place was just OK. i think i expected too much because of the all reviews raving about this place. We had the steak and the duck and both dishes were average.  One thing that was absolutely delicious though was the chocolate cake. It was so soft....it literally melts in your mouth. SOOO TASTY!! We had to change our reservation twice because we were running late with doing all the tourists sightseeing in NY.  And the restaurant was very accommodating with that. We ended up eating a very late dinner--9pm. One thing that was super annoying was that we arrived at the restaurant 15 mins before our reservation and wasn't seated until 9:30pm! So much for making a reservation. They were super backed up or something because 5 parties after us had to wait too...but i thought the point of making a reservation is so that you can be seated promptly!I would come back for chocolate cake...but I can definitely get better and cheaper steak somewhere else.,1,1,1,Caitlin P.,"San Francisco, CA",425,246,1020
4.0,1/14/2013,"Came here in in December of 2012 with a reservation for 4. Has a coat check which in NY is a big plus. We walked in and immediately I felt under dressed. We just came from a day out and about (with tourists) and everyone was dressed particularly formal. All men were wearing jackets and women in conservative clothing. We were seating immediately by a friendly host even though we were missing one person in our party. They sat us by the window which was nice. Despite my feeling out of place, the associates were all very friendly and we ended up having a great dinner.We started with bread and cocktails, then apps and an entree. The food was so good I wanted to devour every bite, but I was too full. Even the bread was amazing.At first I had never heard of this place and was hesitant, but I am so glad that my gf made the reseveration. I would definitely come back (appropriately dressed of course).Have to Get: If they have the Garlic Foccacia - GET IT, the Yellowtail Tartare, Mushroom Risotto, and the Miso Glazed Cod.",0,0,0,Tiffany M.,"Pasadena, CA",123,52,4
5.0,1/12/2013,"My husband and I were in New York for a family reunion and had one night to ourselves so we decided to have dinner here. What a great decision! The weather was awful that evening and we both looked like drowned rats when we arrived (should have taken a cab!) The hostess didnt even bat an eye and thanked us for coming out on such a crappy night. The service was prompt and attentive but not overbearing. We started with the Tuna tartare which fresh and delicious, next we had the foie gras which was equally tasty but so rich that I couldn't eat too much of it. For entrees I got the whole main lobster, it came to the table shelled (which I appreciated). It was perfectly cooked and served with spaghetti squash, brussel sprouts and some other veggies... amazing! My husband ordered the rack of lamb, it was delicious as well and cooked just how he likes.

5.0,1/7/2013,"I was promised to experience a dinner of a lifetime at Gotham by a very close client/friend of mine who has owned a restaurant himself and experienced a lot more of the finer things in life than I ever have. When I looked at the menu online, I scoffed at the prices. No place can justify these prices, I thought to myself. However,  I was very wrong. For one it's NYC, so their square footage and decor alone justify the prices, but I did have a meal of a lifetime at this restaurant! I would say probably the best meal I've ever had. I don't know if it was the prowess and the regularity with which my client/friend frequents this place, but the service was incredible and I was treated like royalty! The place was packed on a Thursday night. I ate things I had never eaten before! I ate fried goose liver, butternut squash raviolis that were better than any butternut squash ravioli I've ever had, this egg risotto dish that was delectable and far superior to any other risotto dish I've ever had...I even tried some steak which for a normally non-meat eater or liker, it was delicious, smooth and just perfect! The cow was definitely honored in a true culinary fashion! RIP! I ate all kinds of delicious desserts too! After dessert, it all hit me and I had clearly pushed my eating limit because I had hot flashes and needed to step outside for some cold air!

Great atmosphere, fabulous service and for the most part spectacular food.  My wife and I share two apps - ravioli stuffed with butternut squash which was very flavorable and the grilled octopus which is a personal favorite of mine and GBAG did not disappoint. Our entree on the other hand was some what of a let down. We shared the 50 day aged steak for two and it was horribly tough and chewy. As the waiter recommended it as being so special and at $175 it was even more disappointing. I would have sent it back - and I never do that - but was with business colleagues and let it go.  On the positive side the braised short rib that accompanied it was like butter and so good and for whatever reason the other half of the steak - the more fatty side was good. GBAG finished strong with dessert. We had apple tartin special that was simply amazing. Pastry was so buttery and apple were cooked to perfection - not too hard, and not mushy. Also, coffee was really good. This is great place for special occasion and there are a bunch of interesting things on menu I would still like to try.

5.0,12/9/2012,"I've had my eye on this restaurant for several years now, so it is with great pleasure that I can announce that I fiiiiiiiiinally got here this last visit to the Big Apple.  While I tend to be long-winded with my reviews of places I love, I'll cut straight to the chase and say, this is up there with the BEST of them.  Put another way, we dined at the 3-star Michelin award winning restaurant, Daniel, this same trip, and I was equally impressed with the food at Gotham's 1-star Michelin restaurant.  I'd say Daniel was a bit more elegant and refined, but not by much.I think I liked my appetizer best of the dishes we tried here.  I had the Yellowfin Tuna Tartare, and it was sooooooo flavorful.  Decorated with japanese cucumber and sweet miso Asian ginger vinaigrette, I couldn't believe the wonderful flavors I tasted.  I savored every bite.  The tuna was so fresh with a hint of saltiness.....I loved it.  My daughter had a scallops appetizer, which was also delightful, but mine was better.  My husband had their butternut squash soup, which, again, was really good, but mine was the best of the appetizers.  :)For entrees, I had free range chicken, which was served with braised turnips, hen of the woods mushrooms and israeli couscous, swimming in a sauce of preserved lemon and spiced yogurt.  Wow, it was delicious, and the chicken was as moist as I've ever had !!!  My husband ate red snapper, which came with carmelized fennel, baby swiss chard and red bliss potato confit in a tomato and black olive vinaigrette.  While that was quite tasty, it wasn't as good as my daughter's winning dish of mushroom crusted Nova Scotia halibut, served with potato purée, braised endive, leek, roasted shiitake verjus emulsion.  I have to say, her dish was the best.  I can't even describe the flavors, but when I took a bite of it, the flavors waited a second and then exploded in my mouth.  It was a very pleasant surprise and a huge joy to eat.  For dessert, my husband had some flourless chocolate cake, which was served with a salted caramel ice cream.  It was divine.  My daughter and I shared a Peanut Coupe, which was peanut butter mousse, chocolate sauce, virginia peanuts and vanilla ice cream.  It was delish !!My reviews are typically wordy, if not properly descriptive, but I guess with this place, I just want to say, and keep it short, that we love Gotham Bar & Grill.  The service was top notch, the maitre'd was gracious and gave us a really nice table, and we wanted for nothing.  There was an air of sophistication, but not stuffiness, and the vibe and look of the restaurant was very ""New York.""  Yes, that's a compliment of the highest kind.  With over 19,000 restaurants to try in New York City, and with my living in California, I'm not too sure when we will return to Gotham Bar & grill, but you know the saying, if there's a will, there's a way.  This was truly a wonderful dining experience.",4,2,3,Claudia B.,"Simi Valley, CA",1144,1299,6819

It has a very neighborhoody vibe to it, though on our particular night it was mostly white financial guys (Xmas parties??). But the service, atmosphere, and food are all VERY good. The waitress was particularly helpful in advising me: instead of ""well, x dish is very popular"", she gave me information that was of use in making my choice (e.g.""our miso cod is excellent but we always have it, so if you are deciding between that and the pork chop, I would go with the chop"").

5.0,12/1/2012,"Oh Gotham how I love you.  I cannot understand why I have not been here before, but I am so happy I have tried it now, because it will become a regular with my mama when she's in town.  We started with the bee's knees, which the lovely bartender was more than happy to make with very little syrup for me.  I don't like sweet drinks, and it was a lot more balanced for my palate with just gin and lovely lemon tones.  Once we were seated at a very nice table towards the front of the restaurant, we began perusing the menu. I want to preface this review with the very important fact that I was NOT hungry.  Not a little hungry, or meh I can eat hungry.  I had lunch with Maha at Basta Pasta, and for some reason was still full by 10 pm.  I think this is important considering how much I managed to eat. We started with the striped bass ceviche, the scallops with cauliflower puree, and the roasted beet and goat cheese salad. The starters were nothing short of divinity.  The ceviche was unlike anything I have had in the world of ceviche.  It was not overly lemony, and was balanced perfectly by the delightful avocado cilantro puree, and the grapes were a lovely surprise.  I could eat that puree by the spoonful.  The scallops were mostly mine, because I just could not get over the cauliflower puree and the perfectly medium rare scallops.  The beet salad was just good-which is in a good way good.For mains, Maha had the chicken, Nelly ordered the black cod, and Nelly's mom and I both ordered Lobster.  The chicken was tender and perfectly cooked.  The black cod was infused with flavor, and had a delicious crust.  The lobster though, oh the lobster.  It was hands down, the best lobster I have ever had.  It was juicy and tender.  The spaghetti squash with the port wine reduction was nothing short of genius.  If I could have that lobster weekly, my quality of life would improve significantly. Although all of us could have stopped eating at that point (keep in mind, I consumed all that food without being in the least bit hungry), we did not.For dessert we ordered the Gotham chocolate cake, the black forest cake, the pear souffle, and the vanilla semifreddo.The deconstructed black forest cake ""looked like a forest"", to quote my sister Maha.  It tasted deep dark and rich, just like I imagine a forest would.The pear souffle was my favorite, but I am beyond partial to souffles.The Gotham chocolate cake was surprisingly good.  I didnt want to order it because I'm so over chocolate cake.  But I was so wrong.  This one was insanely good.  It was warm and fluffy, without being light-again, a good thing.The vanilla semifreddo was well received, and was unique in its balance of flavors, and intensity, despite having been done before by others.Overall, this meal was insanely good.

5.0,11/19/2012,"All aspects of this dinner were flawless. This perfection started before the dishes, with the décor and atmosphere. The seating has floral patterns, but that are in darker tones, achieving a subtlety that more garish floral decoration misses. The ceilings are very high, which can often ruin the intimacy a restaurant like Gotham tries to achieve, and only works very well in the most opulent, old guard restaurants or the most sleek and cold (not a criticism, just a reality of the ultra-modern style in general) restaurants. However, Gotham resolved this problem by hanging beautiful white paper lights - a bit like Chinise paper lights let into the sky on New Years - that cuts off about 10 feet of perceived height, keeping the intimacy along with the elegance, also aided by the beautiful finishings, like sleek lights wrapping around the pillars    Let me not digress further or we may find ourselves discussing every thread of upholstery and focus on the  most important aspect: food. In short, perfect. Undoubtedly it was the second best meal of my life (after Taillevent's transcendental experience). I started with tuna tartare. The tuna - fragrant enough for my dinner partner to smell from her end of the table -  surrounded by salad and had its edges sitting on slices of cucumber. Poking out were four slices of well toasted bread, creating the culinary representation of the millennium dome,  with the only difference its beauty. The tuna was spiced to perfection (I'm sorry. I can't help but overuse this word!), leaving the full flavors of the fish, while leaving a lingering heat between each bite, and balanced perfectly (there I go) with the cucumber.    2nd course: Razor clam and crab chowder with crab croquette and octopus. The difference between a good and a great soup is subtle, but there is notdoubt that this was great. It was oddly refreshing, leaving a dry finish.  it avoided the usual trap of chowder: too creamy and heavy, crushing any nuanced flavor and just leaving the taste of shellfish-infused cream. Here, with this thinner soup, one left it feeling light and refreshed and was able to discern every flavor. The octopus was fantastic although the crab croquette wasn't all that necessary, just getting soggy and not tasting like much.   3rd course: Roasted Muscovy Duck in a ruby port sauce with roasted plums. Foie gras poillee with pear. The duck was the cooked to perfection (the beautiful pale pink of medium rare, gradations of increasing pallor from the center) and sauce of good consistency and flavor. The foie gras was as good as any I've had - including France - and melted in my mouth, always a good sign. The duck, however, could have been a little more flavorful to balance its natural taste with that of the sauce. But this was to a very minor degree, and I am only bringing it up in an attempt to find fault. Still, overall a fantastic dish.Dessert: Normally I gravitate toward the richest possible dessert, which is usually the fondant au chocolat, or the next most chocolately item. But a good restaurant can make a great fondant. It is not a dish of sufficient finesse to differentiate a good from an exceptional restaurant. A tarte tatin, on the other hand, is. So, thank God my dinner partner was  hungry and a huge fan of tarte tatin, because the restaurant only made it for two. And this was the best tarte tatin (it was apple) I have ever had! Although this is not saying too much, because I have never had a great tarte tatin - evidence of their trickiness - my dinner partner is near 80 years old and a seasoned restaurant goer. She has unsurprisingly tasted a lot more tarte tatin's than me and still found it the best she had ever had. Why so good? The easier elements, such as the caramelization of the apples and the subtle spiceing were done faultlessly. But the infamous pastry was not only just the right thickness and cooked to a flaky perfection but also caramelized with a thin film - so thin as not to distort the pastry texture but rather adding an extra layer and thus dimension to the flavor.    All in all a superb experience. I almost forgot to mention that the service was highly attentive and the perfect degree of impersonal (and extra points for having a waiter who sounded like Michael Caine).",2,0,0,Grant H.,"Manhattan, NY",172,4,0

Service was excellent from the bar to the table.Ordered:1. Seared Hudson Foie Gras- reunited with my love at last.  This was a perfect piece of foie given with roasted plum and cherry/balsamic sauce.  Every piece melted in my mouth.. It was just so heavenly. Definitely my favorite way to eat foie!2. Day boat sea scallops- I usually don't order scallops right off the bat but hey this time we did.  It was cooked perfectly well and came with a great apples/curry froth emulsion.. great presentation.3. Roasted Muscovy Duck- My absolutely delicious entree.  Everyone at the table was able to try it and definitely chose it as a fav of the night.  Duck was cooked medium rare and topped off with another piece of seared foie gras.  I always made sure to combine all the ingredients together in every bite to fully enjoy the entire dish, which came with roasted black plums and ruby port sauce. A MUST!4. 28 day dry aged new york steak- I think this could of been alot better if it was ordered medium rare.  Instead I was able to try some of it but it was ordered medium-well.. No gooo when it comes to steak!  The bordelaise sauce helped out the beef though.  Steak also came with onion rings5. Grilled Swordfish- Just had a taste of this and the sauce always makes a fish plate stand out or else it'll be bland. Bravo to the sauce Chef!6. Vanilla Semifreddo- I love fruity desserts.  It came with coconut crunch at the bottom, drizzled with mango sauce. Semi-frozen dessert it is again next time! Even though I do hear good things about this chocolate cake of his...7. Complimentary desserts- chocolate brownies, citrus marshmellows, and fruit jellies.I topped this meal off with a glass of riesling from Spain.. perfect balance of not too dry and not too sweet.I definitely had a wonderful experience here and can't be more open to telling you guys to check it out yourself!",6,1,1,Kathy D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2136,1124,541

Minus 1.Also had the Octopus for appetizer, they coursed it  and split it in 2 nice separate plates for me and my GF as if we ordered 2 plates. Taste fresh and fantasic. Plus 1.Main course: Roast duck and the famous 28 day aged steak... Both excellent with super rich flavors. I ask for Medium Well for the steak, I think a Medium or Medium Rare would have been better. But even at 70%ish cooked level, the outer layer is not completely charred. Impressive. Portion was good! (also had a bottle of wine to go with the steak, it was the best experience ever) Plus 1.Desserts: Was too full to get 2 desserts so went with the Gotham Black Forest Chocolate. The chocolate was absolutely aromatic and thick, they added mint ice cream with it which went well and added refreshing tastes to the rich flavor. Savored every piece of it.

3.0,10/9/2012,"I've dined at Gotham at least once a year since it opened, and while it has its strengths and weaknesses, it usually succeeds in pleasing me and my dining partners. Today, however, was an exception. The Beet and Goat Cheese appetizer was nice to look at, but the citrus fruit was the star of the dish. The goat cheese was in minute amounts and the beets, sad to say, tasted like those I serve at home from a can. My ""heirloom beet and goat cheese"" at the Brasserie last week was far better. My dining partner had the scallop which had a distinct Indian Spice flavor and was good. Entrees consisted of a good duck and a branzino that had so many accompaniments that overwhelmed the fish (especially the tomatoes). Service was haphazard and not at all personal. A Cabernet was ordered by the glass and another was brought. Only when questioned did the server say that they ran out of the previous wine and now were serving a new one. The Cabernet was harsh and tanic, but the server insisted that the previous one was harsh and the current one was ""smooth"".  Gotham is still a good value, and the kitchen is capable of turning out decent dishes.

My husband have a pretty discerning, sophisticated pallet and were excited to try an assortment of dishes from this well acclaimed chef. To start we shared the Grilled Spanish Octopus, Seafood Salary and Label Rouge Chicken & Foie Gras Terrine. Each of the dishes was AMAZING. The Spanish Octopus was my favorite by far; it was tender and so flavorful. My husband had the Roasted Muscovy Duck entrée and enjoyed it tremendously. I had the Free Range Chicken entrée. The chicken was amazing, literally so tender it sliced like butter. I will say it was a bit salty but I never put salt on anything so it's important to take that into consideration.

I wanted to like this place, but after my last visit I don't think I would ever try coming here for their regular menu. I understand that when you come for restaurant week and order from the prix fixe menu, it is not going to be the same level of quality as the restaurant would normally put into their food. That being said, I was pretty content with the food here. Both my boyfriend and I got the Wild Bass Ceviche for our first course and we both agreed that this was our favorite part of the meal. For the second course, we got the Hanger Steak and it was good, but not great. For dessert, I got the Strawberry Shortcake and he got the Gotham Black Forest Cake. Both were pretty good and I wasn't disappointed.So why not more stars if I was content with the meal, you ask? While the food was good, the wait time and service were not up to par. We waited 15 minutes for our first course which was fine, but we literally waited over an hour for second. I know that the restaurant is extra busy since it's restaurant week, but the table next to us (that got seated after us) got their second course around 30 minutes before us. After waiting for a while, we kindly asked the waiter how much longer we would have to wait, he didn't say anything and never got back to us.

4.0,8/15/2012,"I'm not sure if it's a result of eating at more refined places or a change in the menu, but my most recent visit to Gotham causes me to knock it down a notch. We came for dinner last Saturday, and while it's still a very nice place decor-wise, the food simply did not seem as up to snuff. I still very much enjoyed the tuna tartare - good to know that some things don't change - and the scallop was alright as well. The second course really was uneven. The seafood salad was okay, but the my chicken / foie gras terrine was as close to just a plain-out bad dish that I've had at a restaurant. I'm not sure if it wasn't taste-tested, but adding chicken to what is usually a very creamy-tasting terrine is a bad, bad idea. The apricots were a nice touch, and the brioche is well-prepped, but the mixture of chicken and foie gras is just no good. Absolutely don't bother with it. The entree was good - the miso glazed cod was very flaky and marinated just the right amount. The duck was also smoky and very hearty as well. The chocolate cake still does not fail to impress, but the Gotham chocolate special is a disappointment. You basically get a small-ish piece of what looked like chocolate pudding along with some other accoutrements (like black cherries) that don't really make up for it.While the food here was good for the most part (save for the aforementioned terrine), it's a pretty big hit to the wallet ($230 before tip for a 3-course + dessert meal) relative to the quality of the dishes you get here. I certainly would eat here again, but I definitely feel like the restaurant does their best job when they take staple contemporary American cuisine and enhance it. The dishes where they tried to get too fancy (like the terrine and the chocolate dessert) were disappointing and not worth the cost.

Nothing interesting, I didn't have an extreme makeover: home edition style meltdown over it. I thought the ceiling looked awful. For a place everyone touted as gorgeous, I was very underwhelmed. Anyway onto what I had for lunch that day. They have this special Greenmarket market menu going on. I didn't like the list of entrees on it and asked if I could substitute the salmon. I was told no, but I could still order anything from the Greenmarket menu. So that is what I did. To start I order the Wild  Striped Bass ceviche off the greenmarket menu. This was my favorite thing. For my entree, I ordered off the regular menu and got salmon. It was good, but nothing to write home about. I really wanted to try the strawberry shortcake, and I normally don't order dessert for lunch, but what the hell why not right? It was kind of a letdown. I was expecting awesome, but got an average dessert instead.I at least can say I've had dinner at Gotham Bar and Grill. Now that it's been crossed off my list, I doubt I'd come back.

4.0,8/1/2012,"Most of my meals are eaten with plasticware off of a tv tray in front of an oscillating fan, so I must admit Gotham made me feel pretty damn classy before I even ordered off the mouthwatering Summer 2012 Restaurant Week lunch menu. Ambiance is beautiful, service is polished and professional (and yes, impersonal), and the food is gorgeous. Can't speak for anything other than the RW menu offerings (and doubt I ever will, unless I strike it big or end up fulfilling my Jewish nana's dreams), but I'm sure Gotham rarely, if ever, disappoints.Appetizer: The three of us raw foodie freaks had to go with the bass ceviche over salad or soup. I probably could've slurped down everyone's portions and still been ravenous, but it was the dish to go with here. Super fresh, incredible flavor - the bit of watermelon rocks. Entree: I was pressured into the halibut since the others went with the hanger steak. It was good, but I say go beefy on this one. The fish was a little overcooked for me, but it was beautifully prepared. Steaks were tender and cooked perfectly - probably the best cut of hanger I've tried. Dessert: Loved both the strawberry shortcake and the black forest cake, a gorgeously presented dark chocolate mousse-like treat with bing cherries and mint ice cream. The shortcake was topped with a very memorable Thai basil ice cream that was so NOT weird, I promise. You can eat your dessert here and not feel guilty - refreshing and tiny.Gotham is all about quality, not quantity, which is a nice change for volumetric me, who whips up infant-sized omelets at home for dinner with steamed veggies piled as high as the garbage on your curb. The flavor is so spot-on that you don't yearn for anything additional, though, and you can return to the office feelin' so fresh and so clean. 4.5 stars.

5.0,7/29/2012,"The last time my boyfriend (""The Guy"") and I were in NYC, he treated me to an insanely lovely dinner at One if by Land, Two if by Sea. This time, I wanted to treat him, so what better place than Gotham Bar and Grill? One of the best-reviewed restaurants in the city, I'd been angling to go for years but had never gotten the chance when I lived there. Finally!Of course, Gotham didn't disappoint. Beautiful ambiance, attentive (but not intrusive) waitstaff (I managed to drop both my butter and steak knife at different points in the meal--they were retrieved so quickly, I'm not sure either of them actually managed to hit the floor), and absolutely delicious food. We started off with the tagliatelle--I'm not a real pasta fan, but this was quite tasty, and the sauce really hearty and did a great job of whetting the appetite. The Guy had the miso marinated black cod which was truly divine. He ate everything on his plate, including the vegetables (he's not a veggie-phobe, but he looked as though he were EAGERLY eating everything on the plate, which was heartening). I had the 28-day aged steak with onion rings and carrots. LOVED IT. I am a sucker for a good steak, and this was a great steak. I ordered it a little more rare than I tend to get (I'm the dork who generally gets her steaks medium-well...got it medium this time) and was not remotely disappointed. It was juicy, flavorful, and left me feeling almost woozy with happiness. There was only one complaint I had about the restaurant (not the meal though) and that's the restroom. For such an elegant place, I was taken aback by how messy the restroom was. I think on busy evenings, they need to work on taking better care of it--such an easy thing to fix!I still thought the dinner at One if by Land was slightly better than Gotham B&G just because it's more conducive to a romantic and intimate evening--however, Gotham is an excellent restaurant all around. I would never take a client or even friends to One if by Land lest they think I'm going to try to make out with them later. Gotham is elegant and wonderful for any conceivable occasion.

5.0,7/28/2012,"hands down..one of the best restaurants in NY and also one of the best ive been to ever.to first, i have to give the staff a HUGE thank you for the amazing service and respect. My boyfriend and i strolled into the place way underdressed since we were out at central park all day. The staff did not bat an eyelash when I came in jean shorts and toms (totally my fault). We were seated and was still given top notch service all night.we started off with the foie gras...WOW now thats how its supposed to be cooked! it came with sweet pineapples...a great contrasting flavor to the liver. The liver was cooked perfectly--slight seared on both sides--still raw in the middle.I had the lobster with napa cabbage, mushrooms, peas in a ginger both.  this was probably one of the best dishes ive ever had. YES it was that good. the lobster--right just was on top of cabbage, buckwheat noodles, and mushrooms..it was a party in my mouth. I will come back every time for this dish.Boyfriend got the 28 day old dry aged NY steak. Only complaint was that the steak was not cooked the way he asked--medium rare--it came out medium, however, the rest of the dish worked so well, that we didnt really care.dessert: strawberry parfait. freshly homemade basil ice cream...yumThis is def. a place to go for a once in a while splurge!!",2,0,1,wenting x.,"New York, NY",93,82,9
5.0,7/26/2012,"My experience here went from negative stars to 5 stars in one lunch outing. The reason being the maitre'd of the day aka one of their FOH managers was beyond rude to my friend while we were waiting to be seated for our 2pm reservation. We arrived at 1:45p to give ourselves some time or perhaps get seated earlier. We check in, wait and around 2:10p check to see where we were on the list. (Mind you, the front waiting area was awfully packed & disorganized, quite unusual for an award winning restaurant) Anyways, the maitre'd (Oh I wish I got his name) had the audacity to point around and say ""Look around you, this is how many people"" and continued by saying ""I can't help you"". Speechless and quite taken aback, my friend returns and shared what had happen looking very upset. Of course, I doubled checked if he was the manager and then checked to see if the GM was around because his behavior was totally unacceptable! Finally we got seated at 2:40p, (yes almost an hour after we arrived) in a crappy lil corner seat awkwardly squeezed in between the stairs and another large table. (It definitely should NOT be a table) At this point we didn't care and just wanted to eat. BUT we had an amazing amazing server named Dan which out of curiosity I asked about the disorganized waiting area and rude manager. After retelling the situation and venting without expectation, the GM arrives and apologizes and said that our entire lunch was comped!!!! Thank goodness for their top leadership which I commend, not because we received a free meal, but acknowledging your guests and their  inappropriate/pretentious behavior (esp FOH).Anyways, all to say that I am no longer surprised that they have received nothing less than 4-5 stars on their reviews, along with much recognition for their food. Everything was delicious and wonderfully plated especially for restaurant week, so I can't imagine what their normal menu tastes like!

The individual dishes were absolutely exquisite and flavorful.  The ambiance was good, but not great.  The coldness of the server, unfortunately, marred the evening.  Made us feel like we offended her for asking a question.  To pay the amount we did and not feel we were welcome by the waitress gave us an uncomfortable feeling that lasted throughout the meal.

For dessert, we had the strawberry parfait and chocolate cake. The chocolate cake had a delicate refined texture and was very rich in flavor. I personally preferred the strawberry parfait since it was a complex blend of black sesame cake, organic berries, and basil ice cream. Every dish we ordered did not disappoint. I also want to make a note of the decor, which was beautiful and elegant. This place had a neutral interior with high ceilings. The seats are a bit close together but the type of patrons that dine here are generally pleasant. At least they were when I went. There is a window in the back of the restaurant that has no view, but instead is covered with lush greenery from outside. The ambiance of GBG is fresh yet refined.

I believe it was a mushroom ravioli and a tiny portion, but super good. The lobster entree on the main menu was gorgeous in presentation, but so tough! I had a hard time cutting the lobster with the knife they provided and I even tried to pick it up and gnaw on it with my teeth, which proved to be difficult.

4.0,6/11/2012,"Gotham is a comfortable place to relax and enjoy good food.  Their website boasts of no pretentiousness and they are true to their word.  We went for an early dinner after a matinee Broadway show and although a bit out of the way from the theatre district (a $10 cab ride), it was worth the trip.  After having skipped lunch, we were starved so I started with the Day Boat Scallop appetizer while my companion got the Smoked Salmon.  The Day Boat Scallops (2) were big and the dish was phenominal with garlic cream, foam and root veggies.  I was in heaven.  The scallops perfectly seared. The Smoked Salmon was a huge appetizer with dill, green beans and caperberries.  I really like the bite of the caper berries and the crunch of the veggies with the silky smooth salmon.  And not too smokey, just as I prefer.  I could've stopped the meal right there and been completely satisfied but we had so much more to go.  The Niman Ranch, bone-in, 40 day, dry-aged NY steak was excellent.  Served with a bordelaise sauce on the side, veggies and a small iron pot of potato gratin.  Perfectly medium-rare seared.  The Roast Suckling Pig was served as a giant pork belly.  The meat was pulled from the bone, pressed into a square and topped with a thick, crunchy, skin crust.  It was hard to eat and with only a small amount of apple jus, was a bit dry.  The dollop of sweet onion marmalade made it. Served with smashed fingerling potatoes topped with a hot spice.  Desserts were Black Forest Cake which was a deconstruction of the original with bing cherries served with a balsamic reduction, crushed chocolate cookies (chocolate sable) and a dense chocolate mousse-like cake (chocolate dacquoise).  And if that's not enough, two spoons of fresh mint ice cream.  Of course my companion got the chocolate cake which was a flourless chocolate cake with salted almond ice cream.  Hers was good but mine was better.  The cappacino was even good.  And just when I thought I'd have to be wheeled out, we were given 6 petit fours which of course I had to try.  The first was a red gel covered in coconut that sent me over the edge.  It was tart and sweet and floral and just incredible.  My companion tried half and as I saw her face turn, I took it from her and ate the rest.  So good.  The next one was, I think, a tangerine scented marshmallow.  I couldn't eat the last one - something chocolately.  OK, so why not 5 stars?  If I could give 4.5, I would.  There was a gnat that continued to bother us.  We were actually able to get rid of it towards the end of dinner only to have another show up.  That and the pork dish didn't wow me.  It was good but not blow my mind good.  For me, the appetizer and dessert was better than my entree.  I'd wished the entire meal was that great.  Our server was great however and had the answer to every question that we asked.",0,0,0,Michelle S.,"Fairbanks, AK",32,652,26

5.0,6/7/2012,"Love! Went there for dinner on a Tuesday evening and the place was packed. We were there on time for our reservation and were seated immediately. Service was impeccable; I love the ambiance of this restaurant- it's old school, classy but not formal, quite noisy as the tables are arranged very close to each other. The food was amazing! The wines are expensive - you'd be hard pressed to find a bottle that's below 100$. I believe the cheapest HALF bottle was 80$. The foie gras and tuna tartar were delicious; as were the roast suckling pig and lamb rack. They managed to pair everything with either a really flavorful sauce/ rub or vegetables/ fruits that gave a different dimension flavor to the dish - eg foie gras sits on a thin slice of pineapple, roast pig had a perfectly roasted and crispy skin and had a delicious sauce, lamb had some rub on the skin, etc. Every dish was cooked to perfection. They also timed the dish perfectly- never rush, never too long a wait. Portion was perfect - definitely not family size but a starter plus a mains will fill one up. We had the chocolate cake to share. It came with almond ice cream which had a tiny salty taste to it- that again was a perfect contrast to the rich chocolate cake it came with. The cake itself melts in your mouth the second it's there. Overall my favorite restaurant in NYC so far. Only wish they had a wine list with a lower price range!

The Wild Mushroom Salad was delicious. The greens were fresh and was combined with juicy mushrooms and perfectly tasting thick cuts of bacon. Although I'm a HUGE mushroom lover, the bacon won over the mushrooms in this dish! Yummy bacon.The Yellowfin Tuna Tartar was pretty good. It tasted fresh and the crackers that accompanied it was perfectly paired. The Striped Bass Ceviche was nice too, but I didn't think it was that memorable. For the main dish, I ordered the Miso Marinated Black Cod. I thought the fish was cooked perfectly. It tasted flakey, buttery, and soft - exactly what good fish should taste like. It was paired with some Bok Choy and mushrooms, which wasn't that impressive. I thought the Miso sauce was a tad too salty too. We ended our meal with the chocolate cake, which was AMAZING. Yes, it was very rich, but the texture was the perfect mixture between cake and moose. The cake was so soft, it literally melted in your mouth. Definitely the highlight of the meal. The Affogato was a little disappointing. This dish is actually a very simple dessert, which is what makes it so good. (Kind of like when all you want is a simple scoop of plain ol' vanilla ice cream). However, I think the pastry chef went a little overboard with the ""fancy"" for the Affogato. I think this dish is served best with a strong espresso flavor, and the  plethora of whip creme that surrounded the dish diluted the coffee taste. This was a bit disappointing. Service: Tentative, good.Overall: What's memorable about this restaurant is its beautiful interior. You are wowed when you walk into this high ceiling, beautiful soft lighting decor. Also, I absolutely LOVE the round tables for large parties here. I don't understand, but I think more restaurants need to incorporate this into their place.

4.0,5/3/2012,"Gotham Bar is quintessential classic New York fine-dining, at its best. The decor and ambiance is airy and grand, yet quite elegant as it overlooks a lush garden through the large floor-to-ceiling window panels. The menu boasts upscale, classic American fare, along with an extensive wine and cocktail menu. Service is just as it should be too, polite and attentive without being overbearing. Honestly speaking, Gotham is probably more suitable for proper business lunches than those seeking adventurous gastronomic experiences.Although the regular menu prices here are quite high, their $25 Greenmarket prix-fixe menu during lunch on the weekdays is a steal. I personally love that the Greenmarket menu changes regularly, as it features whatever fresh ingredients are in season at the nearby Union Square Greenmarket. You also have the option of adding a dessert (from a limited list of options) for just $7, so a 3-course meal at lunch tops out at just $32! Needless to say, the bf and I both ordered different items off the Greenmarket menu:Appetizers - Both my red watercress salad and his crispy pork torchon were winners. Although the watercress & baby spinach were crisp and bitter, the vinaigrette made with goat cheese added richness, further complemented by the crunchy hazelnuts and sweet tangerines. His pork torchon was deliciously rich and porky in the best way, but not overly fatty or leaving a cloying mouthfeel. The bed of beluga lentils it rested upon was a classic combination done right, and the mustard cider jus helped brighten it up. I was actually quite jealous to not have ordered the pork torchon myself... Entrees - My pan seared skate served with bacon, ramps and fingerling potatoes was one of the better skate preparations I've encountered. The skate wing was tender with a crispy sear, not at all stringy or slimy. I'm a huge fan of ramps in the Spring (but then again, who isn't?!) and really liked how the bacon and ramps took a rift from your traditional Southern collards. The spring pea ravioli dish he ordered was super dainty - each of the half dozen of raviolis were probably just the size of a nickel. However he appreciated the rich broth that accompanied the dish, which seemed to be strongly flavored with shitaki mushrooms and vegetables. Desserts - We just had to order both the Gothan chocolate cake and coconut tart off the Greenmarket menu, because it was such a killer value. The coconut tart (which was presented so beautifully) was light and refreshing, completely tropical with a fresh mango puree and pink grapefruit. The coconut sake sorbet was unexpected and very refreshing as well, better than any sake-tini I've had at your low-brow Japanese joint. The Gotham chocolate cake was certainly worth the hype - rich, luscious and deeply chocolaty without any heaviness. I'm not sure how the pastry chef achieves such airiness with a chocolate cake, but whatever it is, I don't want to know - I just want to eat it!I think it's safe to say that Gotham Bar & Grill deserves all of the stellar reviews and hype it receives, and the notable Michelin star. However, I don't think the food here is exactly forward-thinking or super interesting - which is why I have to withhold the last star for now.",3,1,2,Cecilia Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",762,644,43
5.0,5/2/2012,"Although I have eaten in just about every great restaurant in Manhattan, Gotham Bar and Grill is without a doubt my very favorite place to dine in New York, which is a huge compliment given all of the desirable restaurant opportunities that Manhattan has to offer. I know that it sounds ridiculous, but I have had the perfectly roasted chicken with a mountain of the best hand cut shoe string fried potatos practically every time that I've ever dined at Gotham. My husband, who is used to a more diverse course selection always let's me sample whatever he's eating and neither one of us have ever been disappointed in any of Chef Albert Portale's offerings. I do switch it up when it comes to first course and highly recommend Gotham's Wild Mushroom Salad with its slab type bacon and the delectable chicken & foie gras terrine with pistachio which is a meal in itself. Getting back to Gotham's magnificent fowl,  I was so enamored of Mr. Portale's scrumptious poultry that I wrote him a fan letter! This very busy and kind gentleman not only answered my letter thanking me, he gave me the recipe!

3.0,4/20/2012,"I had a 5:30 PM reservation as we were going to the theatre after dinner, which the restaurant was made aware of. Our server was very nice and personable, making some humorous remarks here and there. He recommended the oysters--which were very, very delicious. I also had their pork chop dish, which was huge and I only ate about 1/3 of it before I had to leave. I'm giving it three stars because of the pace. We had to leave in quite a hurry since we had a show to go to, and because they were aware of this from the beginning, they could have worked on bringing our dishes out sooner. For example, there was quite a lag between my second and third course. Thus, we never got to try dessert--bummer as I've heard great things about their dessert.Likewise, I thought it was surprising that at a restaurant of this caliber, the servers do not explain what you are eating when you are presented with your dish.

5.0,4/13/2012,"I came here for a special treat dinner and was delighted with my experience. The atmosphere is very elegant, yet comfortable. The service was attentive and genial. What a wonderful night, but now onto the food... I ordered the Mushroom Salad, which was a Market Special meaning that it was a seasonal item. The salad was beautiful as were all the other dishes. The combination of flavors was beautiful and delicate. The mushrooms were woodsy, the roasted hazelnuts crunchy, nutty, and creamy. The frisee was fresh and crisp, as good greens should be. There were thin shards of lardon, salty, fatty, porky goodness. Also included was a fresh goat cheese and a white cream sauce, as well as pickled onions. The onions cut the richness of the cream and bacon. For my next course I ordered the Roasted Suckling Pig, which was also a Market Special. If this is offered I highly recommend you order it. The pork comes with sweet onion marmalade, similar to caramelized onions, crispy crushed potatoes, spicy broccoli rabe, and apple cider jus. The caramelized onions were sweet. The pork was super crispy on top and the meat itself was flavorful and delicious. The potatoes had a wonderful natural sweetness and were crispy and buttery. You know what you're eating is good if every bite brings a smile to your face. Then for dessert I chose the Mango Souffle, which was by far the highlight of the meal. The souffle is served warm with coconut panna cotta and coconut sorbet. The souffle came to the table puffed high in all its glory. The souffle was redolent with the flavors of sweet fresh mango and even had little nuggets of sweet mango, as well as being light and fluffy. The panna cotta was perfectly creamy and smooth. I also tried the Warm Bread Pudding, which I would also recommend. The bread in the pudding was reminiscent of the perfect french toast, not too heavy yet custardy and bready. I also loved how they serve you a small little plate of petit fours at the end of the meal. These include a poppyseed macaron, dark chocolate truffle, and some sort of small cream torte. The dark chocolate truffle was so creamy and rich. A fantastic end to a fantastic meal. Do come here. You will not be disappointed.",1,0,0,Melanie T.,"Manhattan, NY",27,339,233
5.0,4/12/2012,"#152I stopped here for lunch to experience one of the most influential and well-known restaurants in NYC. Gotham Bar and Grill currently holds a 1-star rating in the Michelin Guide. The head chef is Alfred Portale, one of the most well-known American chefs. SERVICE- 4.5I arrived just after lunch started, so I had no problem getting a seat. They offer a coat check, and I happily dropped my bag off with the clerk. This was just the beginning of this pleasant dining experience. I was politely shown to my table, which was positioned far away from other patrons in the restaurant to sort of give it my own little world. Throughout the entire dining experience, the staff was quick to fill my water and see to my needs being met. I even stepped outside to make a phone call, and when I arrived several minutes later, found that my previously unkempt napkin had been folded for me. FOOD- 4.5I ordered the Gotham Burger, cooked medium well. The Gotham burger comes with fries and pickled vegetables. When the burger arrive, it came out medium rare. But, you don't actually know that until you bite into the burger. Let me tell you, this is one FANTASTIC HAMBURGER. Even though it came rare, I would've preferred it this way. The moment you bite into the patty, meat juices just come pouring out and rushing into your mouth. So succulent. So tasty. The combination of the gruyère cheese, grilled purple onions, and harissa aioli made for a really unique tasting experience. NOTE: I DO NOT LIKE ONIONS. But, the fact that I was able to eat through this entire hamburger-- purple onions and all speaks testament to how well these flavors all come together. All in all, this was the kind of juicy, delicious hamburger that I was expecting. Fries were very tasty and came with a variety of dipping sauces. Not a fan of the pickled vegetables... TOO PICKLY! My only gripe is that, in my opinion, their lunch menu is a bit limited. Aside from the seared magret duck and pan seared skate, the rest of the options didn't really wow me. AMBIANCE- 5This restaurant has great ambiance. Tasteful decorations. Just an excellent place to bring a date to. Very quiet and pleasant dining experience that you can carry a conversation in. Total class, but not as pretentious as you might think. I walked in with jeans and a casual long-sleeve shirt, and didn't feel like I was treated any differently than patrons dressed in full business suits.OVERALLThis restaurant is very deserving of its 1-star rating with the Michelin Guide, and while I'm not a huge fan of fancy New American cuisine, I'd definitely come back here.",2,0,0,Will C.,"San Francisco, CA",79,258,92

Then black cod prepared with bok choy, and generous rack of lamb cuts. Did not have room for dessert!Would definitely return when in the area. Great atmosphere and food.

5.0,4/3/2012,"Perfection from the moment you make your reservation to the moment you walk out their doors. There is a reason this place is a New York institution. Everyone I encountered throughout my experience was courteous and extremely accommodating. And not in a stuffy way, but in a warm and welcoming way. I came with my boyfriend for their $25 green market lunch special. I appreciate high-end restaurants that offer such specials to give those who might otherwise not to be able to experience fine dining. They really think of everything....from liquidated sugar for my iced tea with a special stirring spoon, to neatly folding my napkin when I left the table for a moment. We both ordered the radicchio and arugula salad to start. It was finely chopped with inventive additions such as apples and hazelnuts. The presentation was beautiful with Parmesan slivers delicately placed over it. The salad had a pleasing balance of acidity and smoothness.For my main dish, I ordered the salmon. It came in a light broth with vegetables and thinly sliced potatoes. Every bite with the ingredients was absolutely delicious. It was the perfect portion as well, kept me full but satisfied. My date ordered the skirt steak which I tried a bite of. I am not a huge fan of steak but it was tender and juicy. For dessert we shared the chocolate cake with cashew and coconut ice cream on the side. I am not a huge fan of sweets but it was absolutely amazing! The cake had the most odd yet splendid combination of being rich yet light and fluffy at the same time. The ice cream complimented the dark chocolate cake and there were also chocolate crumbs placed beneath the ice cream which gave the overall dessert a pleasant texture. The decor is classic, open and inviting. Large windows towards the rear leave plenty of light coming in and give a sneak peak of exposed brick from other buildings as well as some natural flowers. The bar displays fine wines and high quality scotches. Fresh and massive floral arrangements are sprinkled throughout the establishment.

The Maitre'd informed us that it would be few minute wait. We were suspect from the moment we walked in. The bar was crowded in a way that a restaurant of that caliber should never be. We asked for a realistic time frame from the maitre'd's assistant. She informed us there were FIVE table ahead of us.

3.0,2/9/2012,"1st Stop of Restaurant Week 2012- For LunchTo Celebrate my bestie's birthday early and treat her to lunch!! :) her's is today but we went on Tuesday. for 2:30pm. and got seated around 15 mins later although we got there at 2:25pm. I went a crazy researching adventure in search for the perfect ""the one"" restaurant. At first, I reserved at Morimoto, heard they had the most amazing bathroom. Shoot, I just forgot that I didn't even check out the bathroom at Gotham. Probably so distracted by our bad seating. What's the f*ing point of reserving, if I'm going to get a crappy seat?? And then I was going to go to Maze by Gordon Ramsay but read some of the reviews that they served their food cold. :( And then we were going to go to Boulud Sud, but it was kinda really far from NYU. So after going crazy with more research, I decided on Gotham Bar and Grill cause people said that it was their best RW experience and the food was good even during the restaurant week.Service and Seating:I didn't like my seating b/c we were all waiting to be seated and I assumed the people in front of us that were in a group still needed to speak with the maitre, but the people behind us (also a party of 2), who were also waiting, just cut us, when they called for the next people and were seated right away. we still had to wait like four minutes. and then they give us a crappy table. they gave us a seat almost right by the door which was kind of insulting, when I especially reserved & noted that I wanted to be in the main dining room with a nice view of the restaurant. So I asked if I could be seated somewhere else, the guy said that he would have to go see the maitre. So we had to wait another few minutes. but we were seated in an awkward, tight spot right in between two tables and right by where people go up the stairs and were crammed. could barely put our stuff/ bags down. :( good thing I had good company. I made a comment to the person who oversees the restaurant, I guess that they didn't have the scallop sandwich anymore and he rudely pointed that that was the RW menu. I KNOW THAT. I agree with some of the reviewers. There's too much time in between the meals. Our server kept refilling our water without any question, which was nice.Decor: Looks better in pictures. kinda small but inside is cozy. the ceiling decor is ok. have seen better. The plates and utensils were nothing special. definitely wasn't blown away. FOODhad the trout for appetizer. was good, i guess. interesting. cool presentation.the braised short ribs were ok. not noteworthy at all. Mine was kinda really burned on the top. I didn't get it. Why? I had a big piece of fat on mine. :( I thought that they should know better at a high end restaurant. tasted kind of korean inspired. and the pickled cabbage kinda tasted like kimchi. no joke. When someone came over to ask how the meal was, I just smiled cause I hear a lot that when you complain and ask for a new plate, they spit in the food and do weird things to your food. also I'm not a very confrontational person.the Dessert was the best part of the meal. it was the Gotham Chocolate Cake. the cake was warm and the ice cream served with the cake was divine. It's kinda like chocolate and chip with little sprinkled crumbs, can't really explain it. you gotta try it to know!! the BDAY girl ordered the assorted sorbet, which was eh, didn't taste good or unique, kept eating my cake, and she's a skinny one. :) I would go back probably for the cake.They put a candle in the sorbet with ""Happy Birthday"" written on a chocolate inside the bowl. That was a nice touch.  :)Bill came out to about $53 dollars for just two lunches. left a ten dollar tip didn't have the nerves to pay them less. whatever. our server was pretty nice and polite.

4.0,2/8/2012,"This review is for lunch during restaurant week. The restaurant itself is very lovely and the colors are very warm. There was a bit of a wait for our table as there was for many other people's table. I guess this restaurant is one of the most popular RW choices. I went with my coworker and all of the tables were full. They were very busy but food still came out in a very timely manner. I had the steelhead trout, hake, and chocolate cake. The bread is like if a hot roll and an artisan loaf had a baby--soft inside but somewhat crusty outside (butter was room temperature). The portion sizes were very good if not a bit bigger than other places, however my coworker has the short rib which was much smaller than my fish but the beef was also very rich. To start the trout was lightly smoked and very refreshing. It was served with a small frisee salad and small dots of a crème freshe dill sauce. There were three slices which were twice the size of the slices of the walu I had at Rouge Tomate. Then was the pan seared hake--so delicious. It was expertly cooked, very moist, well season and had crispy skin. I especially like the mustard grain vinaigrette they served on the warm potatoes. There were two types of red potatoes used, one was creamy and the other was waxy--very good contrast. Finally we had the chocolate cake. The chocolate cake had a very intense flavor, very moist, and almost disintegrated in your mouth. It was very filling and the ice cream provided a nice hot-cold contrast. The dessert was very straightforward but the chocolate cake was amazing and I appreciated that the dessert wasn't overly sweet. All in all, this is someone I would like to come back for the regular menu. Last note: the service here is very rough. It's definitely not like other fine dining/ Michelin star rated places. I think it's because they were packed and it was restaurant week but there were a lot of slip-ups. 1.) Crowding at the hostess station. 2) Coat check was not offered to patrons. Their coat check is more like a club's--there is a nook with a woman standing there. 3) When they presented your plate of food, no one told you what it was. They just placed it on the table and walked away. 4) The server who is responsible for replenishing your silverware did not have enough silverware to plate the table at the same time. 5) Rolls were not neatly stacked on the bread trays. It literally looked like someone dumped them onto the tray. I understand it was very busy and it's RW but Café Boulud was equally as busy and they still managed to tell you what everything was, placed your silverware correctly, and have neatly stacked rolls.",1,0,1,Lucy Z.,"Manhattan, NY",9,107,0

5.0,2/3/2012,"I am a local who grew up in a seriously foodie family, and a current Columbia student. Gotham was my introduction to fine dining. I must have been around 13 years old when my dad took me out to lunch here for the first time (this was back when they had a year-round $25 lunch prix fixe, but truthfully I don't begrudge them their price hike because their food is absolutely worth it). The experience--not just the food, but the dining room and the service as well--opened my eyes to a whole new world. I still remember the dishes I ate at Gotham so many years ago, down to the tiny ball of goat cheese rolled in peppercorns and perched atop a sourdough crouton in the lentil soup.  Gotham will, accordingly, always have a special place in my heart. My parents took me back to Gotham several times over the next few years, and then for some unexplainable reason several years passed without my returning.Today I took a west coast friend to Gotham for a Restaurant Week lunch. I was excited and a bit anxious walking in. The airy and elegant dining room never fails to impress, but I worried that the food wouldn't be as wonderful as I remembered (I have been to many more of New York's top restaurants in the years between my last trip to Gotham and now), or that poor Restaurant Week service would spoil my perfect image of past meals there. I left feeling elated that none of my fears had come to pass.We were seated promptly and welcomed by an extraordinarily friendly waiter. Good rolls were added to our bread plates each time a server noticed they were empty. Our waiter checked in on us frequently without being intrusive; each course was served without delay, but we were never rushed. In short, two college students, below the drinking age and ordering off the Restaurant Week menu, were treated in exactly the same impeccable manner that my father and I would have been, eating off the regular menu with a $100 bottle of wine, and that meant a lot to me.The food itself almost goes without saying. My friend's trout appetizer was light and lovely. The soups are always stars at Gotham, and my celery root soup with pear-quince mostarda was no exception. My hake was cooked perfectly, moist and flaky, with a beautifully crisped skin, and served over potatoes and fennel with a delicate mustard sauce. My friend's ricotta ravioli, in a creamy but not overly heavy sauce with rich wild mushroom flavor, could easily have been served in Italy. With my very fond memories of Deborah Racicot's desserts (and my friend's irresistible urge to try the honey bush tea ice cream that came with the bread pudding), we just had to order two desserts à la carte in addition to the Gotham chocolate cake and the sorbets from the prix fixe. All of the desserts were wonderful (the honey bush tea ice cream was, indeed, a revelation), but the Gotham chocolate cake still eclipsed the three others. My friend instantly declared it the best chocolate cake she had ever eaten, and I was astonished to find that the dessert that I had daydreamed about for years was really, truly, as inescapably heavenly as I remembered it.Truthfully, the rolls could have been just a touch warmer (and that meal would have been better accompanied by a good white burgundy, but our age and budget made that impossible), but I found it incredibly gratifying to know that Gotham still has the wonderful food and attentive, elegant service that I remembered from years ago.",2,0,1,A.

The duck, however, was awesome. Prepared two ways, crispy fried leg and sliced breast with a red wine sauce and sweet potato puree, this was too good.For dessert I had a cheesecake that was delicious.

5.0,1/21/2012,"I was caught off guard, had about 5 minutes to get shoes and jacket on and headed over there because a friend of a friend had a reservation. I wasn't familiar with this place (can't believe I didn't stumble upon this earlier as I must have walked past it dozens of times) but the name, Gotham Bar & Grill sounds like a place to get a burger or steak and a beer. The name definitely doesn't match the quality and setting of the higher end restaurant. I'd drop the Bar & Grill.. Anyhoo, it's a good thing I don't care about money, coz the friends that brought me, thought there was a restaurant week special for  $35 for dinner. I knew that couldn't be on a Friday night.. We almost walked out coz one was a cheap guy, but I insisted we stay because I saw a few dishes whiz past me and my mouth watered. The service was superb. They are on any empty glass or finished plate within seconds, but you don't feel they are over the top on it. Very friendly, informative/knowledgeable waiter, maitre D, hostess and coat rack person.Now, the food! Spectacular! I had the Sea Bass Ceviche, though a tiny portion for $20, it was stellar. The cilantro / avacado sauce was exquisite, and a perfect match with the pineapple and finely chopped onions/peppers. The fish was raw, not cooked in lemon like my ceviche, but it was pure and tasty. I had the chicken dish and the entire piece was cooked perfectly. Normally, when I get chicken that is roasted or grilled, the first few bites may be perfectly cooked, then it still cooks and by the time I get to end it sometimes is overooked and a bit dry. Not the case here. Scrumpscious, tasty and a lot of meat. It was on the bone, but every single bite was good chicken meat and a tiny little bone when done. No tendons, cartilage or anything, really, perfect! It came with a great rice/chutney/peanut + spices. It was perfect amount of food and I was so impressed - which is VERY rare! One friend had the steak, said it was awesome, but what does he know, he orders it medium/med rare. It looked pink, way too overcooked for me, I ask for it black and blue or very rare. Other friend had the pork chop, said it was awesome.I can't wait to go back at lunch time and try lunch special. Overall, definitely awesome. Plan on $ 100 per person (or 150-200 if you drink like me), although the portions are bit on the small side, with 3-5 dishes you'll leave full. Guys taking dates here, it's definitely a wet restaurant :P   -   Thought I do wonder if they turn down the lighting at all later in the night, seemed very bright - but then again, my eyes are sensitive to light... Oh, and I must say that because it was spur of moment decision to go and I definitely wasn't dressed well (jeans, sweater, haven't shaved in a week and a NY Giants winter hat and my hair definitely was frazzed when I took hat off), the maitre D and waiter were open to conversation and answered my questions, not only with respect (regardless of my dressed downness) but with enthusiasm and were friendly, which I wasn't expecting as I was borderline embarrassed of my attire. Next time I will dress appropriately..Happy Eats!",4,1,2,Bruce W.,"New York, NY",116,84,2

It's for a big night out, celebration of sorts, or for you corporate expense account kids (damn you - you lucky jerks!) one for the Big Boys to pick up.Everything from start to finish was top notch. It was quite impressive. The service itself was some of the best I've ever had in New York. The decor is definitely fancy, but it has a warm feeling to it. I did not feel like I was out of place or unwelcome in the least. It was even lovelier with the snow coming down outside the windows behind us. The food is amazing, Michelin star well deserved my friends, well deserved indeed. I have no idea what my date had to start because I was too busy inhaling my seafood salad. For mains we both had the dry aged New York Steak... although he went home with half of mine for lunch the next day because it is that big. I should also mention that until this time I had been a vegetarian for several years so GB&G steak was the first one I had after crossing back over to the dark side... damn was it worth it! I also love that it comes with onion rings. Yum yum. Then to end the evening, and also because it was my date's birthday, we ordered the chocolate cake. Oh My God!! The chocolate was so decedent I could have licked the plate clean... although I think they frown upon that sort of thing at GB&G.  I don't think he got more than a couple bites because I just couldn't stop myself from scarfing that cake down.

2.0,1/14/2012,"if you read my other reviews this is going to have some of the more standard things I complain about, how people determine if a restaurant is handicapped accessible, America's fascination with salt or the over salting of food and why people pay so much money for overpriced cuisine because other people tell them its worth it.Lets start with the handicapped accessibility of GOTHAM, its not handicapped accessible and should not be listed as such, some clearly misinformed person told YELP it was, first and foremost there is for lack of a better description a raised platform or stage of three steps immediately inside the entrance which means that if you are in a wheelchair you have to get out of it and have another member of your party lift the wheelchair up and over it, but GOTHAM has a solution for you... they take you through a service corridor, the same one they bring food into the restaurant and the garbage out of the kitchen, its poorly lit, it's smelly and the floor was greasy but what the hell, your only going to spend hundreds of dollars on a meal, who cares? clearly not GOTHAM, and clearly not YELP. There is also no handicapped bathroom, I couldn't check the ladies room but there was not even a handicapped stall in the men's room, and there was also no sink you could have washed up at from a wheelchair. I am now going to describe everything the party of six of us ate, even after the opening experience of being brought through the service corridor to get into the restaurant we were trying to be in good spirits it was the birthday of a member of our party and we didn't want to bring the evening down.We all started with appetizers, I had the oysters as did another member of our group, lovely fresh and delicious how can you ruin oysters, one person had the Mayan shrimp cocktail, kind of a hybrid of a a classic shrimp cocktail and a cerviche, interesting but not overwhelming, two members of the group had the yellow fin tuna tartare both were extremely disappointed with it feeling it was not substantial enough and lacked flavor, the last member had the smoked trout which was good but not very smoky ( or rather more salty then smoky).For Main courses we all ordered across the board,One of us had the lobster, I don't get why people like grilled lobster, for me it toughens it, drys it out and makes it chewy but it was well prepared at about what I would guess was about a pound and a quarter, the accompanying sides were kind of off putting against the clean taste of the seafood, baby lentils, cauliflower and eggplant in a curry butter all of which did nothing to enhance the lobster, One of us had the Miso marinated cod. I don't really like Cod but it one of the more successful pairings accompanied by bok choy, shiitakes, sticky rice and a nice ginger sauce,One of us had the Roast Duck Muscovy, the first thing I will comment on is that it was way to salty, I know this is a technique to crisp the duck but don't people know how salty there making peoples food when they prepare it? sadly this was the case with the next to dishes as well, I will say that the turnip and turnip greens along with the pears and foie grass were Delicious and complimented the duck well, My wife had the baby lamb chops, the accompanying swiss chard, roasted cipollini, potato purée and lamb reduction were all delicious but again the dish was rendered almost in edible by the over salting of the meat, you want to taste lamb not a salt lick.I had the 28 day aged steak, I love steak it was well prepared the accompanying side of marrow mustard custard, vidalia onion rings and bordelaise sauce were all great, but again it was so overly salty it was hard for me to eat, all I could taste was salt, I love a good steak I've had them all over new york, at smith and wolensky, at del frisco's, at peter lugers, I've never had a steak as salty as the one at ""gotham"" in my life,Since it was a birthday we all had desert, 2 had the gotham chocolate cake which was yummy, one had the warm apple strudel also delicious and flaky with a perfectly sweet caramel apple ice cream, one had the smore but didn't like it and offered it around, I think the lavender ice cream is an acquired taste, my wife had the seasonal ice creams all really good, three quenelle's all very flavorful and delicious, I had the pumpkin cheesecake which i felt was not dense enough, the accompanying grape jam? more like a jelly was also good, but the cardamon ice cream need more cardamon, To sum up this experience, the restaurant is way pricey about $200 a piece including two drinks each, The food was for the most part delicious  if somewhat small for the price,but most of the prepared meats, (lamb, steak, Duck) Were far to SALTYoh and if your disabled be prepared because ""GOTHAMS"" not designed for you, its not handicapped accessible.",2,0,0,howard T.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,53,0

4.0,1/6/2012,"For a $1200 bill I was really hoping for a little better meal than what I got.  Maybe its because im not a hedge fund manager where my 1200 is really like ordering from the dollar menu at McDonalds.  The suits come out after a day of hard day of work to drop 150 dollars on a meal at the bar.  This really isn't my type of restaurant.  Its more fun to say that I ate here than actually eating here.  The atmosphere is a bit stuffy and more of a fine dining experience than what I really like.  To be fair, there were 8 of us but most of us werent drinking and thats where the bill can even get higher.Now that doesn't mean that I dont appreciate good food when I come across it.  I love good food and finding gems can make my day.  This place started off strong with butternut squash soup, risotto and foie gras.  I had the 28 day dry aged steak as my main course.  It was Eh, and sightly overcooked for my medium rare order. For 46 dollars, I expect my steak to melt in my mouth.  Some of the other main courses looked really good as my friends ordered the lobster and lamb.  Maybe Ive ate too much good steak recently so im not impressed with what they had in comparison.    The service is pretty interesting here as I couldn't discern one server for our table but a whole host of different people just randomly checking in on us.  Eating here 3 years ago I kind of knew what to expect and it really didn't exceed my average expectations which I set pretty low for the meal.  I go back and forth with this place on giving it 3 or 4 stars but at the end of the night there are just too many good restaurants out there putting out quality meals that are less expensive.  It gets 4 stars if youre willing to shell out the money for the presentation.  It gets 3 stars becasue im not a 50 year old rich dude that is dating a 23 year old model trying to impress her with how much money I can spend on dinner.  Overall minus the price, it was well worth 4 stars because they do have some good options on the menu and the presentation and ambience of the restaurant is above your average NY dining experience.",3,4,2,Nathan L.,"New York, NY",256,281,5
5.0,1/6/2012,"When staying at the Carlyle this holiday season, we approached the concierge in search of ""the perfect restaurant"" - a place where we could dress up for a romantic night on the town and have that ideal (but very hard to find) balance of ambiance, service, and 5-star food.  When we heard ""Bar and Grill"" we were admittedly hesitant because we wanted somewhere upscale as it was our last night in the city and we were aiming for a cozy, beautiful spot.  Fortunately, the concierge recommended Gotham so quickly after hearing our request that we figured she must be on to something, and so we decided to take her advice.  Do NOT be deceived by the ""Bar and Grill"" name - this place is perfectly classy and top-notch without being arrogant in any way.I should perhaps specify that our idea of a great meal involves straightforward, quality, delicious but not crazy-elaborate food.  In other words, we're not into a $40 dish that has a one-square-inch bite of the advertised ingredient, topped with 6 sauces, flower petals, and 2 types of foam.  Some of the ""finest"" and most expensive restaurants seem to care more about presenting visually artistic masterpieces than making something that tastes amazing, and we've wasted good money and good appetites on such places.  All of that to say, Gotham Bar and Grill is NOT like that at all.  In fact, I can confidently say it's one of the most perfect restaurants we've ever eaten at.  The bread they brought out at the start was fresh and moist - I probably had two pieces more than I should have.  The butternut squash soup was so good I could have had a second bowl for dessert - it was silky and delightful.  The truffle risotto was to die for, even with the unforeseen $90 price tag for the fresh truffles shaved on top, which would normally have caused me to experience severe ""orderer's regret,"" but not in this case!  The truffle-crusted halibut was divine.  I don't even remember what my boyfriend ordered because I was too lost in my own culinary bliss.  Needless to say, we both cleaned every plate.  The Gotham Chocolate Cake is the move for dessert... Smooth and rich but not heavy, unique and yet simply classic - just like the best of everything that is New York.   As for ambiance, this restaurant is clean and simple elegance - the tables are spaced so as not to feel crammed but there is still plenty of opportunity for people-watching.  The lighting is soft but still plenty bright to read the menus, and the seasonal decorations were lovely.  Service was excellent.  The staff was prompt and attentive without being intrusive, and each course was perfectly spaced.Bottom line: don't hesitate with Gotham.  Just go there.",1,0,0,Charlotte G.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,38,10

Very refreshing, perfect balance of sweet and bitter (it's made with grapefruit juice) - highly recommend it.Before I get into the food, if I could give half stars, I would. This place is better than a 3, but compared to some other places I've tried, it isn't quite a four. I think I will settle for 3.75, actually. For appetizers we ordered:1. Yellow Fin Tuna Tartare - very fresh fish and the sweet asian ginger vinaigrette was a fine compliment. The taste was amazing - the fish melted in my mouth and overall, this was the best of the meal after the cocktails.Mains: 1. Roasted Muscovy Duck - ordered it medium rare and it came a bit more medium than I would have liked, but it was still a solid choice. The best part was the poached pear! I love duck and I love the pear and the two together is such wonderful combo! There was also not much duck fat on the duck, which was good for me - less to cut off.2. 28 Day dry aged Steak - so i didn't actually eat this but my boyfriend ordered it medium rare and it was well-done. For a dish costing almost $50 that was sumply unacceptable so he sent it back. It came a little more rare, but it wasn't the best he has had. It also was a shame we couldn't enjoy our meals at the same time...my duck was pretty cold by the time he got his second plate.Dessert:  Sorbets / Ice Cream - decent.Service was exceptional - despite the sending back of the order, the waiter was very patient with us and even gave us a Confused Traveler on the house.

I probably should have ordered something else but I went with the Roasted Muscovy Duck.  Why you ask?  Well because it came with foie gras in a red wine vinegar redux that's why!  It definitely reminded me of my review from Mockingbird Bistro (Houston)  it tasted like that.   Mockingbird is better IMHO but this was up to par.

2.0,11/25/2011,"I came here a few days ago because one of our friend sister came in town and she wanted to try a Michelin star restaurant so I took her here. We made a 1 o'oclok reservation and got here around 1 ish. There were a guy outside passing a flyer about this restaurant and how they spread disease. That was pretty gross but I didn't want to take his words for it so I kept walking in. The restaurant was pretty nice and sleek and remind me of those nyc restaurant I seem in movies. We order the pre-fixed lunch for only $25 each(come w/2 course) plus $7 if you want dessert. I decided on getting the Celery root soup and Chili rub skirt steak. My friend order the mixed chicory mixed salad plus the pan roasted day boat haddock We decided on getting the hamchi tartare because they were suppose to be known for it. The hamchi came out looking gorgerous where you didn't want to eat it but finally we did and it lack freshness plus salt. How can you forget to put salt in the raw hamchi? It was bland like hell plus I don't understand why NYC restaurant fishes are so fresh but they don't understand it isn't that fresh even if they just purchase from their fish guy. If you ever get a chance to eat the fishes when they are caught then you would understand what I mean. We also order a bottle of red wine which was pretty decent and cheap for only $31 buck. At first they handle it out bread but we didn't get any butter for a long time so I had to asked finally. The 1st course came and my soup was pretty decent and just right enough of soup. The salad was very complex with simple taste. Finally our entree came out and the haddock look elegant and it was so mosit and had a awesome sear to the skin. That was proably the hightlight of the meal. My skirt steak came out raw which i love but everything else like the rice, bean, chiurrimi sauce was a disappointed. The plate look soppy and messy. There so many ways to plate it so why did it look so freaky UGLY. The whole dish was disappointed. We decided on getting 1 dessert so we got the pear. The plate setting look nice and the taste too. Why just a 2 star? More for the LACK OF SERVICE. Our waitress was barely there and she seem to have a attitude. For 1 michelin star, how can you LACK SERVICE?? Forgot to give me butter?? Anyway there were some highlight but more lows in my book. I am happy that I can cross this restaurant out on my Michelin star list.

The white cheese, infused with black truffles, were quite strong but not to the point where it overwhelmed the patty.  It achieves just the right balance in flavor, and second most notable element after the beef.  It's well melted, also delicate and not too heavy. A smaller portion of tomato confit is underneath the melted cheese.  It's a nice touch, but it's contribution to the burger was a bit too subtle and muted.  I felt the need to add some ketchup as a sweet sauce to the burger, and it worked well.  Mustard, a with a good horseradish kick added some spice to it. Bun is great.  The Bread is nice, is toasted and has a good char inside the bun. Maybe a tad heavy in consistency of the dough, but not distractingly so.  Burger here feels a bit bread heavy.  Maybe the bread to meat ratio is a little off, but really not by much at all. Portion size of the burger is a bit small, but the meat is very dense and it is a heavier burger that's quite filling.Kennebec fries are closer to a McDonald's cut fries.  Like the burger, the execution is spot on with a light crisp, & perfect seasoning.  Otherwise there's nothing complex and works great.I feel perhaps the biggest weakness of the Gotham Burger, if you can call it that, is that despite the top notch quality I felt there was not much that set it differently from other gourmet burgers.  I was much more impressed with the creativity of my seafood salad.  Nonetheless, I find it difficult to find much fault with the Gotham Burger or the Seafood Salad in general.  Great burger.Earlier review, to be updated shortly, will go into the 'seafood salad'.",3,1,1,Adrian Robert H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",720,350,1747

5.0,11/10/2011,"I dined at Gotham Bar and Grill with my wife and my parents on November 5th.  A friend recommended the restaurant to me and described it as ""the best meal I've ever had in NYC.""  Of course, once he told me this, I was sold on eating here.... but couldn't get a reservation!  Persistence paid off and after checking opentable every day for two weeks, a 6:30pm reservation finally became available.  I quickly snatched up the reservation and waited patiently for Saturday evening to arrive.This was an absolute great dining experience.  We had a round-top setup for us in the back of the restaurant which was lovely.  I will say, I wouldn't be too excited to dine at this restaurant as a party of 2 because those tables were VERY close together.  I knew this was going to be a special occasion type meal, as there aren't too many times the four of us are in Manhattan together.  With that being said, I checked the menu prices ahead of time and prepared myself for the pricey tab that was about to come my way.  We started out with two shared appetizers.... the roasted cauliflower rissotto which was amazing.  It had diced sweet potatoes, roasted cauliflower, and a touch of lemon.  I thought the balance of flavors was to die for.  My wife felt it had a tad bit too much lemon, but she is not a huge fan of lemon flavor.  My mom and dad both enjoyed it very much.  The second appetizer was a butternut squash soup with a bit of marrow in the bowl and that was very good as well.  I'm not sure the soup was worth $17, but I get that they are a fine dining establishment with a renowned chef so they justify their prices accordingly.  The rissotto was $25, and again, while it wasn't a huge portion, it was delicious flavor.The ladies drank two glasses each of pinot noir during the evening at $17 a glass, and my father and I both had Whistle Pig Rye cocktails.  Mine was a Manhattan up and my father's was an Old Fashioned.  Both drinks were made to perfection so we ordered a second with dinner (which neither of us normally do... especially at $18 a drink.)  For our entrees, my father and wife both had the 28 day dry aged NY Strip steak which had amazing flavor.  My mother had Halibut that came dressed in a cauliflower puree that just bursted with flavor.  Both dishes were unbelievable.  However, I may have had the best dish of the evening with the Roasted Duck Breast entree.  It came with a poached pear and spinach.  The Duck was so tender and cooked medium rare to perfection.  The entree was absolutely divine.  It also came with foie gras, which I've never had before, and wasn't a fan of the flavor.  It was very bitter for my taste buds.  It was probably cooked to perfection but just isn't a preference of mine.What pleased me most about the experience was how the maitre'd and our server made us feel so welcomed at Gotham.  Very polite, very detail oriented, and very professional.  The tables were cleared properly, pre-coursed properly, and our server was extremely intelligent when it came to the menu.  Her descriptions were spot on.  The women were served first, cleared first, and it was just an absolute pleasure to dine at Gotham on Saturday evening.  As I stated, we splurged a bit, each sharing 2 appetizers, having our own entree, and having 2 cocktails apiece, and our bill came to $480 with tip.  The dining experience was worth the pricey tab.",2,0,0,Geoff G.,"Olney, MD",52,122,0

4.0,11/8/2011,"Celebrated a birthday dinner here last weekend. It was an incredible experience. The space is really beautiful and despite the large crowds, it never got that loud at all. It is also very spacious - even the row tables. The bar is quite large and a perfect place to wait for a table. Only one bartender when we were there, so he was quite overworked. We started with a round of cocktails. Delicious! highly recommend the ""positively 12th st"" if you like gin. We were lucky enough to be escorted to one of the best tables in the restaurant - overlooking the entire room. Service was impeccable the entire time. Of course, the food was perfect as well. We started with the ceviche and hudsons seared foie gras. Both were spot on. The ceviche was so fresh tasting with alot of zest. The foie gras was incredible, with a great slight crisp on the outside. It was very rich, so I would recommend sharing this one.  Entrees were equally as impressive, and the portions were surprisingly huge! I had the pork chop. Well cooked, great flavors in the au jus. The onion and escarole was a nice sweet/bitter contrast and worked perfectly together. The wine list is really impressive - one of the best I have ever seen. Perfect if you are a connoisseur. However, be prepared for it to double or triple your bill. Most bottles are in the hundreds, quite a few in the thousands. It is also about a 40 page book, so its fairly intimidating. Since we had cocktails, we opted just for a glass or two instead of the bottle. But overall the wine list is very pricey. (You know its bad when even the NY times review admits it's expensive) Overall, it was a pretty amazing experience. Perfect balance of fine dining without being too stuffy. They definitely earned their Michelin star. If you go on a weekend, definitely make your reservations at least 2 weeks in advance - when we left close to midnight the place was still packed.",1,0,0,Joseph F.,"New York, NY",51,183,5

Their sommeliers are supposed to be one of the city's best, and i'm sad we didn't take advantage of this service and went the cocktail route instead, but there was one sommelier in particular whose laugh i especially loved. He had the type of laughter that was contagious, perhaps next time I will ask for him. We debated a while between the prix fixe option or a la carte. In the end we decided to do the a la carte so we could get the caviar. The caviar comes with the standard accompaniments: blinis, creme fraiche, egg, capers, onions, etc. I crave these flavor combos. mmm. we had the seafood salad and the seared foie, these dishes are new and innovative, but they are executed exceptionally well.  for the entrees, i had the miso cod and the bf had the lamb. The miso cod had a very good chili oil sauce that complimented the buttery cod very well. I'm not the biggest fan of lamb but i must admit the lamb here could possibly make me into a lamb fan. We skipped on dessert because both of us were too full to continue, we couldn't even finish the entrees. I should also state that the service here is impeccable.

She is a chocolate nut, and I wanted her to have the best chocolate experience NYC could offer. The flourless chocolate cake is something everyone raves and then some about. We came by around 10 pm on Saturday Sept 24. We were casually dressed, both in jeans, me in flip flops for crying out loud.Most Michelin places would not have even looked at us, much less heard what we had to say. They greeted me like a regular (including the general manager). I said we wanted to try the cake and sit at the bar. Sure! they exclaimed, excitely, genuinely. We were served quickly at the bar with the same attention and pristine sevrice that GBG is known for. The cake was world class as usual. And you even brought petit fours despite the fact that we only got dessert. Really marvelous and what a treat for my wife's first trip to NYC. I sent them a special email thank you for this.

The service was impeccable; our waiter was Christian, he was polite and friendly and very, very attentive. I loved everything about this restaurant. The food was simply amazing. Everything that was ordered had endless bursts of delicious. There was a small assortment of bread and each choice was yummy. Gotham offers a 3-course menu, but you most definitely do not have to stick by it. You may simply order first and second course, first and third, second and third, et cetera. For starters, I chose the yellowfin tuna tartare - it was fresh and every bite I took melted on my tongue. Second, I had the squab and foie gras terrine - loved the texture and the sliced garlic bread that it came with enticed my palate. Third, I chose the Dayboat Atlantic Halibut as recommended in a Yelp review. I did not go wrong in my selection! The halibut was fresh and not overcooked as many restaurants tend to do. The flavor was a wonderful blend of different tastes which made it even more enjoyable. For dessert I had their own chocolate cake with ice cream that tasted lemon-y and basil-y. I didn't ask what it was but it was interesting. Oh, and Christian gave us these delightful little pastries that were complimentary. Even their cocktails were perfect. The decor is elegant and cozy. When we arrived around 7pm, it was pretty quiet and the restaurant was fairly empty. By the time we left around 9:30-10pm, it was packed with diners. Our meal ended up to be around $150 per person (we had 6 in total), which is kind of pricey but really, this place is amazing.",0,0,0,Angela S.,"Flushing, NY",80,19,7

3.0,8/31/2011,"Had our first anniversary dinner here last week and booked the reservation through Open Table -- I noted in the reservation that is was our anniversary, which netted us a cozy corner table and also a cute little chocolate placard on our dessert  that said ""happy anniversary.""  So that was nice and classy on Gotham's part.  The food was terrific -- I had a steak that was kind of out-of-control good.  My wife ordered a chicken dish that she loved.  So, why not more stars?  Well, this would actually be a 4 star or even 5 star review if it weren't for a couple things that took away substantially from the experience.  First, once we were seated we waited about 20 mins before our drink orders were taken or bread was brought to the table...we were pretty ravenous by then.  Then, I ordered a scotch, which took another 20 mins to arrive -- and when it arrived, it arrived with the first course.  Picky?  Maybe, but actually when I sit down at a restaurant like this, I want my cocktail in my hands, stat! Especially when it's 18-year old single malt, mmm-k?So...maybe the cozy corner seat was working against us (we had trouble getting the waitress' attention through out the meal...but we shouldn't really have had that problem at these prices, anyway.)That said, this wasn't my first time here (went for my wife's 30th bday -- it was awesome and no issue with service then) so I expect this service issue was a one-off.The place is really gorgeous -- no problems there.  It's an elegant space that really feels like a night out.Oh, and the chocolate cake -- looks are deceiving!  It appears to be a plain chocolate cake...but it is served warm and is almost like cake pudding.  Amazing.  Not to be missed.",1,2,0,Ethan M.,"Brooklyn, NY",185,62,5

If this place were a man, it would be the guy that everyone likes - he isn't perfect, but he is affable and not pretentious.They had an amazinggggg semolina hazelnut bread. Honestly the best bread I have ever had. ANYWHERE. Apparently the restaurant manager said they had just introduced it recently.The striped bass ceviche was decent.. The seafood salad appetizer was enormous and was probably 3x the size of a main dish at some places (*cough* Respite *cough*). And it was good.After we ordered, we found out the crispy soft shell crab is their most popular dish, followed by the miso marinated black cod - the two dishes we just happened to choose. Both were really really good and the portions were quite large. The flavoring on the cod was a bit heavy though.The sommelier was quite knowledgeable. The only gripe I have is that the service could be a bit slow at times. Oh and you probably want to be a bit dressier than casual.

I went with my husband and best friend, and all three of us ordered the tasting menu. Normally, I just love tasting menus -- but I wish I had ordered something else. Of the five dishes, two (the scallop with foie gras and the lamb with French curry) were amazing, one was really good (the bass/cucumber salad in orange jalapeno sauce), one was not that good (the dessert, a brioche soaked in riesling served with pineapple and rhubarb ice cream), and one was genuinely terrible (the poussin, which had this olive/apricot sauce that just didn't work - it tasted artificial, like Tang, and was much too overpowering). I ordered the wine pairing, which was excellent. In fact, the wine was the only thing that made the poussin edible.The service was trying hard, but didn't quite make it - the server forgot a diet restriction, and didn't seem to know the menu very well. We asked a few questions, which she couldn't answer, and offered to ask for us, but then never followed up.I left feeling it was ""fine"", but not what it should have been for the price, especially with so many other amazing restaurants around.The atmosphere is fancy and feels corporate; they make a show of service, pulling the table out for you, replacing your cutlery, speaking very politely.  I'd recommend it for a corporate lunch, when you want to feel fancy and you aren't actually paying.

5.0,8/16/2011,"Gotham was a four-star affair in my head; but it deserves some extra credit. This was one of the more indulgent meals I've treated myself to recently, and, despite it costing a pretty penny, and my being one litigious bitch, I didn't find anything at all objectionable.  The decor - airy, high-ceilings, stately columns, warm white paint, dark trim - is classically beautiful, with no undertone of 'sexy' (and, at $40+ per entree, no hint of the cheapness that 'sexy' might suggest). Our 6-shrimp cocktail appetizer was a $22 affair (that's $3.67 per shrimp!); first courses (mine; the quail and foie gras terrine ($24); hers, a chanterelle linguini ($26)) were timid whetters. We both opted for big, meaty mains - soft-shell crab; whole lobster - which are usually a little less interesting, flavor-wise. These seafoods were no slouch; crabs were delightfully tangy and swam in a chickpea remoulade, and the lobster, topped with raisins and a light eggplant curry, was special and distinct. A brand, on anonymous protein. The sweethereafters ran $15 a pop; hers was a pineapple cake with a hibiscus glaze; mine was the desconstructed s'more, which didn't taste much like a s'more, but was nonetheless a pleasant mash of marshmallow and chocolate. I actually appreciate it when the dessert isn't the best course, though these were by no means mediocre.Gotham's made the cut of re-eatable restos in the ~$100pp range. The service was nothing special, but the elegant environs managed to be both inviting and grand, and the food was good. A solid splurge; I recommend it.",6,2,7,Liz C.,"Brooklyn, NY",643,600,3

The dry aged 24oz steak-a special-albeit expensive is so flavorful and well prepared that's it's truly worth the extra bucks.  Oh and if you are a Hudson valley foie gras--then go for this one.

Goat cheese is disgusting, it has a pungent taste to it and i will never recommend it to anyone after trying it for the first time here. Main Course- grilled hanger steak- I ordered it medium rare and it came out rare looking. However the cooked part of the steak tasted good.

3.0,4/19/2011,"When I made the reservation for this restaurant, I definitely thought I would come away from it with at least four stars. For a restaurant of this caliber, we decided to have a three course meal and dessert. I had the shitake mushroom soup to start, which needed SALT. I will say, the smooth, rich texture of the soup was a welcome surprise to the grittiness many mushroom soups often have. I then had the Artichoke Salad with fennel and braised vegetables. Braised? They were crunchy and cold. The truffle dressing was oily and felt slick on your lips after. For my entree I had the Black Cod. Really, not any better than I have had elsewhere. I will say, my husband had the truffle Halibut for his entree and that was outrageously tasty. The one saving grace of the meal was the dessert, for both of us. The chocolate peanut butter mousse, was absolutely the crowd favorite and is something I dream about even now! They drizzle chocolate over the top of the mousse and pair it with raspberry sherbet and other raspberry flavored concoctions. The other dessert we had was the pistachio souffle. It was light, but packed with decadence all at the same time.

I don't think either way I could've gone wrong. They offer individual selections per diner from the ""bread basket"" - I went for the foccacia. Twice.

5.0,4/12/2011,"I was here for lunch and dinner, and I will say off the bat that the lunch specials and 80's Sundays in the summer are definitely worth it.  For lunch, the restaurant is much quieter for lunch and relaxing, service was perfectly paced.   The bread here is notoriously good -- I usually don't dive into the bread basket in anticipation of a good meal, but I have a very hard time resisting here.  Especially for dinner where you get at least 4 options and all of them are delicious.  For lunch, we were limited to just one - which may have been a good thing.  I came here for lunch with a friend recently and got the $24 Greenmarket Prix Fixe, which gives you a choice of appetizer and entree.   I got the BABY SPINACH SALAD, which was really delicious -- came with poached pears, candied pecans and apple cider vinaigrette.  It was really about as perfect as a salad gets.  If I make it back here for lunch I'd be tempted to try the other salad.  My friend got the MUSHROOM SOUP and that was also very good.  Creamy without being too filling, and it came with a unique hazelnut custard that really differentiated it from any other mushroom soup I've had.  We both got the sea bass with potato puree for entrees.  It confirmed for me that Gotham does fish really well, and also really likes presenting the fish with some kind of foam!   For whatever reason, it works -- the foam sops up all the flavor and we both thoroughly enjoyed all the elements of the dish.  We also opted for sorbet for the $7 supplement and finished our meal with three tiny scoops of blood orange, strawberry lime, and guava.   I loved the blood orange, but the strawberry lime was a little too subtle.  Dinner here is good too - though most recently the service was very odd.  Our waiter was forgetful and didn't check up on us very often, maybe because we were sitting in the corner table by the bar.  At one point, squeezing between our table the one next to ours, he bumped into my friend's glass of water and almost knocked it over.  We rescued it but I don't think he actually noticed....The food however was fantastic the whole meal through.  Again, the BREAD.  So good.  Can't get over it.   We kept asking for the bread guy to come back.  I think he was a little incredulous by the 4th request.   There was this whole wheat one that was slightly sweet and had a great nutty flavor, it was totally addicting.  But enough about the bread.  We started with the WHITE TUNA CEVICHE, which they split on two plates for us, three slices each.  It came on a thinly spread avocado cilantro puree, and topped with cucumber with granny smith apple.  It was as refreshing as it sounds.  SEARED FOIE GRAS was good, but a little much for me.  I loved the caramelized fennel (though I didn't realize that's what it was until I re-read the description after), and the orange flavor with each bite.  The citrus was a nice way to break up an otherwise very heavy and fatty dish, and to me the most enjoyable part of the dish.   Perhaps I'm just not a foie gras kind of person.   For the entrée , my friend got the ROASTED MUSCOVY DUCK,which was delicious and very tender.   The foie gras it came with was a bit much after the appetizer.  My friend left 3 pieces unfinished (out of a whopping 6-7).   I got the TRUFFLE CRUSTED HALIBUT, and was in love with my dish.   Each bite had great texture from the crusted top, and the foam (verjus emulsion?) was packed with great mushroom flavor.  It was powerfully flavorful without being overwhelming.  Mushroomy in the good way.   I cannot get myself to order an entrée that isn't fish here.  It's been so good.  And while I've tried some of their gamier main dishes and thought they were delicious, I wouldn't enjoy eating a whole plate of it as much as I did devouring the seafood.    And of course we had to order the Gotham Chocolate Cake -- you cannot skip this dessert.  It's unreal.  Every chocolate lover should try this unassuming slice of cake, which looks so.... NOT extraordinary.  Yet it was amazing - each bite was packed with cocoa flavor and yet it was light.  I believe it's flourless too -- not sure how they managed that, must be some kind of magic.  It was my second time having it and it still blew me away.   Oh yeah, the passionfruit sorbet was nice too.   Though a part of me thinks maybe a simple scoop of vanilla ice cream would have been just fine, as the chocolate was clearly the star.   Yep.  Just thinking back on it makes me happy.  I do love it here, and will be glad when 80s night comes back.",6,0,1,Lu H.,"New York, NY",1218,411,1977
5.0,4/8/2011,"I brought my girlfriend here today to celebrate her birthday, which I noted when I made our reservation. While our overall experience was five star, the food was not. However, a lot goes into a good restaurant experience and this place pulled it off very nicely.While the food was not five stars, it was by no means bad. I'd say it was four stars. For our appetizers, I had the yellowfin tuna tartare and my gf had the seafood salad. Both came out sculpted likes works of art, to the point where you just wanted to admire it and not eat it. However, upon tasting each, they were absolutely heavenly. It was delicious beyond your wildest imaginations of what food could taste like. Our appetizers were easily five stars, if not better.For our main courses, I had the braised lamb and she had the miso black cod. It is here that I have to agree with a previous Yelp review that I read in which the reviewer noted that the main courses were not as good as the appetizers. While they were not as good, that doesn't mean that they were not tasty. The braised lamb wasn't bad, but I had braised lamb a few weeks back at the Gramercy Tavern and it was definitely a step or two up from what was served here. Suffice to say that if I hadn't had the lamb at Gramercy Tavern, I wouldn't have known otherwise. They also noted that the lamb was more of a winter dish and would probably be coming off the menu by Monday. As for my gf's miso black cod, it had too much sauce on the plate, which gave the fish an overly saucy and salty taste. However, our waiter was very nice and took her plate back to the kitchen and had the sauce removed. Upon returning, he also brought some sauce in a separate tiny pitcher, just in case she wanted any. Getting rid of the sauce definitely improved the flavor of the cod. Our main courses were more like 3 stars, compared to 5 star appetizers.For dessert, we had the sorbet - grapefruit lime, yogurt and rhubarb. All were yummy, tho the grapefruit lime was more grapefruit than lime. I was pleasantly surprised by the yogurt sorbet as well.The interior of this place and the ambiance are very, very nice, and our server, Kevin, was very nice and attentive during the entire meal, checking in on things, answering questions and making recommendations. But what really made the experience especially worth while was the attention the staff paid my gf for her birthday. Along with our sorbet, they brought out a small plate of sweet treats, one of which had ""Happy Birthday"" written on it and a candle as well. When our check came, our server said that all of the desserts were on the house. Now that's the kind of service I was hoping for! On our way out, everyone wished her a happy birthday as well.

This used to be one of those institutions that required a dinner jacket. Given the Michelin star and the prices, it still draws a very well-dressed crowd. The service is quite excellent and wasn't really snobbish. The interior is nice, well-lit space, and the artwork is noteworthy. And the food well deserves the Michelin rating. They have a Gotham select menu that changes often and even their regular menu gets updated a lot. For the entrée the roasted duck is excellent, so is their steak. For starters, the fish appetizers are excellent. The desserts are also exquisite. The chocolate peanut butter mousse is delicious!

After utilizing the complimentary coat check the hostess found us two open seats at the buzzing bar. We enjoyed two drinks after the bartender gave us some great recommendations. When our table was ready, I pulled out my wallet. The bartender told us that we didn't need to pay her and that the bar tab would transfer to our dinner bill. See what I am talking about?Once at our table the waitress performed as you would expect, flawlessly. We started with their tuna tartare. Our waitress asked if we would be sharing and I told her that we would. They brought the appetizer out beautifully arranged on two separate plates. Unreal. In the meantime, two guys were walking around the restaurant with bread trays filled with three different options. All were amazing.Next was the main course. ""Special occasion"" I told the waitress. She recommended the Wagyu Steak for two, so we went with it. Once our meal was ready, a crew of 4 came to clear our used plates, silverware and glasses. Eight hands on deck for a table of two? That is how they roll. They have two men in suits floating around to make sure everything is perfect. I wanted to ask our guy if his business card read ""Professional Smoothy""...but with my girlfriend's encouragement, I resisted. As for the steak: silky, buttery, perfection.

The service was quick and efficient despite the place being very crowded with restaurant week groups. I was no exception, I came here to see what they had in stored for restaurant week.... only to be disappointed. I chose the Shitake Mushroom salad as my starter and I was delighted at the presentation when it arrived, however the saltiness of the bacon topped with sprinkled Parmesan cheese was just too much. The salad alone fulfilled my quota of sodium for the day.The steak was my entrée and I asked for ""as rare as possible"" and wow did they do a great job. It was perfectly seared on both sides, just enough to meet my expectations of a rare piece of steak. The plating wasn't lacking either, but one thing did stick out -- the saltiness. Again, the sodium levels were abit overwhelming for me to really enjoy the perfectly cooked steak.Finally as the finisher for the 3 course restaurant week menu, I chose to have the Pineapple cake, I personally thought this was the highlight of my lunch, however my friends found it to be too sweet and a bit on the hard end.Overall, given that this is my 3rd experience here and despite the upsetting saltiness of the food, I have to give it a 4/5. The service is exceptional and the atmosphere of the place really gives you a good vibe.

It was packed with mushroom flavor, creamy and light. I could have asked for another bowl!-grilled hanger steak: cooked to perfection! It was neither dry nor chewy and the fingerling potatoes were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.-trio of sorbets (mango, guanabana & pear casis): smooth, citrusy and refreshing!My friend ordered the Gotham chocolate cake and I would DEFINITELY recommend that. The cake tasted like a flourless cake in that it was light and fluffy. The mint ice cream was delicious and that was the highlight of her meal (and mine because I finished what she couldn't!).The food, although sounding so simple, was so delicious and prepared and cooked perfectly. You could tell the ingredients were of the highest caliber and I would come back for more meals here...or even a drink! The bar area looks beautiful and Gotham just seems like a great place where you know the food, service and ambiance will be the start (or finish?) to a great night!",0,0,0,Janel Y.,"Walnut Creek, CA",299,1407,1628
1.0,2/1/2011,"huge disappointment.its been a long time since we dined there, so we decided to see how the place is holding up.well, the ambiance is still lovely. but food is below average, and the portion are ridiculously small. we are not used to eating large portions but these were not just small, they were lilliputian and at those prices a rip-off.new england clam chowder arrived in a very tall bowl, barely covering the bottom of it. in addition, it was not the hearty, creamy and delicious soup one usually associates with chowders. it was as thin as broth, without any substance. but the worst part was the seating. the tables at gotham are barely 5"" apart and with so many people bringing their heavy winter coats and huge bags to their tables, the seating is cramped like a burger king during school lunch break.if that was not enough, there were 2 women seated next to us. while they were eating, the younger one was describing in great details some strange rash she developed on her chest.when they paid for their meal, we all cheered thinking they'd be leaving soon. not so fast. the older woman then pulled out her cell phone and proceeded to scream in spanish and in english at some poor telephone company clerk for not changing her last name on the latest bill. that went on for at least 20 minutes and no one stopped her.If the management is too afraid to usher out the screaming customer, it is clear they do not care about other customers. we dont care to return and pay for a dining experience that is so unpleasant.",3,1,0,b k.,"Manhattan, NY",0,69,0
4.0,2/1/2011,"I have suddenly been turned into a believer of poached pears. I... I love them. Poached pears was something ive seen in a lot of menus. Tried it once somewhere and never really cared for it. So what? the pear is poached, big deal. Yesterday my friend and I ordered the lunch prix fixe menu and ended up having one of those pears in our salad. and from then on, I understood why they were so delicious. It was delicate and a touch away from mush that was delightfully seasoned. I can eat a bathtub full of those poached pears. But anyway, though their menu, to be honest, doesnt look that exciting, their dishes are damn good. They're one of those restaurants with good, solid dishes that you'll never be disappointed with. The table service was precise. A mistake order in our first course was corrected in less than 5 minutes. At the final drop of the fork, our plates cleaned. Our small single bread that was served in the beginning was warm and soft with a crusty exterior. The portions are not as small as they look. (except for the desserts. they can be bigger.) and their medium rare is more in the rare side. (well, I would have ordered a rare hanger steak if my friend wasnt so against extremely bloody meat.)

This place is truly great, but our experience was a tiny bit short of perfect. there goes:The service was impeccable from our particular reservation request to the busboys to our sweet but not too sweet waitress. The only hitch was that it took a very very long time to get our first and second courses out... you know.... enough time that even though you meant to not really eat the bread rolls and delicious butter - beyond ""one bite"" you end up polishing off two rolls and half the butter.We both had the prix-fixe lunches:The salad (mixed greens, sugar pecans, pears, blue cheese type) was the best of its kind I've ever had.The clam chowder was bowl licking good.The PAN ROASTED LONG ISLAND SKATE is fantasticbut the GRILLED HANGER STEAK with onion piperade and crispy fingerlings bordelaise sauce strongly indicated that the chef was in love... it takes a lot to oversalt a steak and potato meal and this one certainly was.but then came dessert and boy was it good.... they were out of the prix fixe's CHESTNUT TORTE and offered a sponge cake with sesame seed ice cream, tapioca and fresh mango.... loving all of the ingredients I though 'sponge cake, meh, but i'll go with it..... BUT imagine my shock when the sponge in the sponge cake looked like a delicate coral like sea sponge and not a brick of yellow cake.... it was so beautiful and delicate and a complete novelty (for me, maybe you all already had beautiful sponge bob cakes in your lives - you never know in NYC)so to sum up maybe when the chef is less in love and moving faster this place might just be a perfect five.",0,1,0,tatia r.,"Brooklyn, NY",164,32,0

The service is incredible and completely unpretentious. I showed up with my parents WITHOUT a reservation late on a Friday night.

5.0,1/16/2011,"Went there last night for dinner.  I wasn't excited at first when we  had to wait for 25 minutes although we had a reservation.  I definitely changed my mind once the food arrived. First came the bread, I had the walnut, rosemary, and the pumpkin one.  They were all so good, but if I had to choose one, I would with the pumpkin, and if I had to choose two, I would add the walnut. For appetizers, I had seared foie gras, which was absolutely delightful ( sprinkled with cocoa with a touch of orange sauce).  I was very happy with the artichoke salad, but then had a bite of the foie gras and couldn't go back to it.  For the main course, I had the lamb rack which was excellent--I'm taking my dad there next time he's in NY!  My husband had the aged steak which was also very good (I obviously preferred the lamb).  For desert, I ordered the apple tart tatin with dolce de leche and sumac.  I wasn't thrilled about it.  Luckily our friend, who ordered the Gotham chocolate cake (flour-less), didn't like it much so we switched deserts.  The dark chocolate cake was sensational! I totally loved it.  Our third friend ordered the truffle cheesecake, which was good but we all agreed that it was too rich that you really can't have more than a bite or two.  Finally, we were all impressed by how informed our waiter was.  His recommendations were genuine and he definitely knew (i.e. tasted) what he was talking about.  He was also very nice and answered all our questions and detailed inquiries about the food.",0,0,0,Petra J.,"Irvine, CA",1,37,22

4.0,1/8/2011,"If you can pretend that you never read any review or viewed all of the accolades and awards that this establishment has plastered on the walls would you still consider Gotham Bar & Grill as one of the best restaurants in NYC?I am not so certain of that. Yes it is a grand space with excellent service and very good food but say you were a tourist and just happened to walk by this place and want to run in for a good meal (considering you didn't need to have a reservation) would you rate this place as high as all the other reviews?Lets start off with the details and service. Made reservations about a 2 week before hand with no real problem. We were even able to push up the reservation 2 hours from our requested 9 PM so that was a good thing. They greet you with a friendly smile and take your coat just like any other restaurant. They sit you right away (which doesn't always happen in other places) but this was a Tuesday and after a major blizzard so not sure if this would happen on a busy night. Next the waiter takes care of your needs with beverages and the bread guy comes around with 5 choices which is very good. We get the menus and carefully read the options for 1st 2nd and 3rd so it would compliment our bottle of wine. We decided to share the yellow fin tuna tartar and that was wise since the portion was large enough for both of us. It really tasted very good and had the perfect blend of flavors that erupted with each bite! So far a great start and we were ready for the 2nd part of our meal which was the Maine ruby red shrimp risotto which had bacon in it and my wife ordered the endive salad with goat and marcona almonds. The risotto was not my favorite and tasted a bit hard and salty with the pieces of bacon and it was starting to fill me up so I must have left 1/2 of the portion. My wife like the strong mix of flavors which the salad had but no where is this a 10. Paying $25+ for an app you would think that it has to be outstanding and perfect but this one fall just a bit short and I would rate it a 7 at best.During the break between our portions the waiter and staff were very attentive to all our needs and even came around to talk to us about the menu and restaurant. Now that the room was at almost at full capacity the ambiance was starting to feel good. The crowd is definitely a mix of upper class locals and tourist as well as a handful of people just happy to share a special occasion with a loved one. Now on to the main course, I had the miso cod with bok choy, sticky rice and shitake mushroom. Wife had the duck cassoulet which she seem to enjoy but I didn't taste. I love bok choy and shitake mushroom and usually prefer to order fish over meat when dining out so this was a simple choice for me. Honestly, this was very tasty and didn't taste too salty as the waiter said it may. I gave it a solid 8 only because I was hoping the portion would have better presentation for a main course.We found room for desert and since it was my wife's birthday the staff was nice enough to bring out the chocolate cake with a candle. We also ordered the assortment of sorbet which I personally loved. The chocolate cake which is the signature desert of the restaurant was really good and rich but nothing that blew me away. I have had cupcakes and ice cream that had a greater impact than this hype.So 3 hours and $300+ later we were finished with our meal and had our experience with our of NYC best restaurants. I can check it off my list, put a star next to it because of the event but I don't think if I came in blind that I would be as impressed as the rest of the reviews that I have read.",0,0,0,Vadim K.,"New York, NY",17,66,20

I've been to many nice restaurants where the service is superior, however in a very intrusive way. This is not the case at Gotham at all.

5.0,12/12/2010,"Dining at Gotham is like slipping on a suit of silk satin pajamas: Smooth, luxurious and beseeching for relaxation. There will be no nerves, no worries and no premonitions that something unpredictable, unavoidable and totally unsavory will materialize to ruin your night, well, perhaps except for their appalling tap water for it thoroughly shamed the claim New York had enjoyed on having the best tap water of all the fifty states (not that I believed it for a minute). LOBSTER FETTUCINI According to our jovial waiter, this last-minute change in the menu due to the sudden appearance of once-unavailable lobster was insanely good. Insane, you say, my right eye brow arched. Fine then, insane it is. Just as my heart sketched it out, the fettunici came wrapping around chucks of lobster meat in a pretty pink tomato sauce; just as my palate expected, it was rightfully delicious. I must confess that I have acquired a weakness for seafood in creamy sauces these days, despite my younger stoic disdain toward such sacrilegious marriage under the Italian tradition (of course, there are exceptions even in Italy, which only confirms the prohibition otherwise, as Cicero would have argued). If I may be a tiny bit exact, the pasta was 30 seconds over-cooked - an oversight, but it did not negatively affect the creamy lobster sauce. COLD SMOKED TASMANIAN SEA TROUTHaving long adored the smoked brook trout at Gotham's sister restaurant in spirit (Telepan), my mischievous curiosity was intrigued - every relationship needs a sprinkle of spice now and then; without an element of surprise, how utterly unbearably boring we will be - notwithstanding the fact that it did not grace the waiter's list of recommendations. The trout had the delicate jelly-like consistency, which was salted just enough to bring out the sweetness and the flavor of the beautiful cinnabar flesh. The use of pumpernickel croutons was an unanticipated delight, which danced off in its crunchy glory on the smooth fish. The garnishment of dollops of mayonnaise and fennel and celery collaborated to make the whole seven pieces varied and balanced. TRUFFLE CRUSTED ATLANTIC HALIBUTGotham is one of the very few restaurants where I can order fish and not feel adventurous in an ulcer-causing way. I have almost forgot, in my long toil of ill-executed fish dishes that when you go to a reputable establishment, you are not supposed to fidget in your seat, worry about the food. Being surrounded by water has not taught New York much, I regret. I have come to realize that being geographically close to the source of a resource does not guarantee, or even stimulate, the growth of culinary skills; furthermore, in this age and time, a skillful chef can cook good fish on a mountain top. While freshness is key; culinary technique is absolutely critical. When you can cook, you can cook anything. When you cannot, well, please do not open a restaurant. Contrary to its thick and meaty appearance, the halibut was cooked decidedly soft and flaky. The dust of truffles was interesting for its flavor and texture, which were perfect accompaniment for the neat alabaster fish. The medley of cauliflower, leek, mushroom and almonds, again, provided contrasts and tones to the mildness of the halibut. The skill of Gotham lies in the way that a good dish is not simply a good dish; it also manages to be both entertaining and intellectual. After all, restaurant is a performance art, is it not?ROASTED MUSCOVY DUCKBold, pushy, strong are all welcome on my palate, especially when it is done is a cassoulet style, a quintessential winter dish. Although not exactly in cassoulet, you have to give it credits for having risen above the ubiquitous orange or red wine sauces.  The plate presented three styles of duck for enjoyment. The tender duck breast was perfectly roasted to a satisfying chewiness, while attaining a pleasing crunch on the skin. On the other hand, the leg confit was gamey with strings of dark flesh falling off the bone. Small, but not neglected, the garlicy duck sausage was firm and stimulating. To tie all parts of duck, the sauce was bold, strong and yet velvety, in which the sweetness of the quince melded all flavors most charmingly. WHITE TRUFFLE HONEY CHEESECAKE I had often wondered about the possibility of truffles in dessert: For example, white chocolate truffle truffle (no typos), what do you think? Gotham seemed to have read my mind and dutifully placed its answer in front of me. The smooth, velvety cheese cake was truly infused with the flavor of white truffles; the devilishly subtle aroma sneaked into my heart with each bite - one second here, the other second gone - with an agonizing playfulness that would produce a life-long addiction. Well-calculated, well-thought-out, and well-executed. Could I just make one tiny request, though? Please redo the Armagnac ice cream because it was watery.",2,0,1,The World Digested A.,"Tokyo, Japan",8,119,85

Honestly that was the best fish ever! I started my meal with the autumn chicory and endive salad. Nice portion and I enjoyed the flavor. I have never had a salad like this before! We split a bottle of wine (I think I drank most of it)...and wow that complimented every bite and taste...smooth delicious wine! My review is jumping all over the place because even as I am writing this I am excited with my dining experience and I don't know which to mention first. EVERYTHING was to perfection!

4.0,12/7/2010,"One of the most prestigious restaurants in NYC.  Me and My wife went there for our anniversary a few months ago and were seated immediately with our reservations.  The ambiance and the decor is what I expected from a iconic restaurant of this caliber however the wait staff was a bit pretentious.    I ordered the N.Y. Sirloin and it was cooked with perfection.  The outside was slightly burnt but the inside was juicy and melted in your mouth.   The flavor was overwelming and complemented the side dish of sauteed vegitables.   My wife ordered the aged steak on the recommendation of the waiter.  She immediately complained about the strong flavor and the acrid odor.   I took a bite and I must say it was a most unusual taste.   Not in a good way.  the taste was so overpowering that we could not get the flavor out of our of taste palates.  To be fair maybe, this is how aged steak tastes but we did not enjoy it at all.  A good waiter should have given us the heads up. (also it was double the price of the sirloin) .  Overall, the experience was pretty good despite the wrong selection.   I will definetely go back on a special occassion(Since I may have to take out a loan.)  and try out some of the other house dishes.   Other than the waiter, the rest of the staff were very professional as one should expect.",1,0,0,Hank K.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,83,771

I ordered the mushroom chestnut risotto and the NY steak.  The food was good, but i actually had to send back the risotto dish because it was severely undercooked.  No apologies were given, just slower service for the rest of our food. And for spending over 100/person AND being michelin rated, this is unacceptable.  Yes the flavors of the dishes were good, but the prior issues were too significant to overlook.Will likely not be returning.",1,3,0,Michael L.,"Houston, TX",117,779,260

For dinner I had the truffle crusted halibut, the fish was cooked perfectly and the truffle and almond vermouth sauce, still makes my mouth water.

5.0,11/1/2010,"From start to finish, Gotham Bar and Grill earned 5-stars, even taking into account the hiccups that occurred... that my friends, is the mark of an truly wonderful restaurant. The hiccups were that four members out of my party of six had decided on the tasting menu before the waiter even came over for our wine orders. Perfect right? Wrong. The menu fails to mention that the tasting menu is only available for complete table participation AND that those tables must be four people or less. When our waiter learned that the majority of the table was unhappy with this information, he quickly ran to the kitchen to see if the request could be accommodated but, before he did, prefaced the trip by saying that it was most likely not possible.... in the end, it wasn't possible, but our waiter's attempt to keep the table happy while also setting expectations did not go unnoticed. The other hiccup in the evening was the end, when we had to be asked to vacate the table for the next diners. Now, I understand that there is a  need to turn tables however, this is typically a HUGE no-no for my group of folks.... after all, we had just spent a grand on dinner (to be fair we had also paid and then spent 45 minutes chatting). At Gotham Bar and Grill however, this request was wonderfully executed. The maitre'd, instead of telling us he needed the table, invited us to continue our conversation at the bar with a glass of complimentary champagne as a thank you for the inconvenience. Very well done, sir! The rest of the evening was flawless from start to finish. Definitely come here for an important dinner -- the food is, of course, amazing (I highly recommend the lobster - its divine), the service is impeccable, and the ambiance is airy, warm and inviting.  N.B. As far as dress goes, it sort of seemed like a free for all. The Opentable website says ""Smart Casual"" which is always confusing to me - apparently its confusing to others as well. Our table was in suits, dresses or skirts and dress pants/sweaters but there were also tables that I saw wearing designer denim and more casual attire. That said, I don't think I would have been comfortable in jeans unless they were very high fashion and paired with equally fashionable heels...

Had no idea it would be so difficult to find a restaurant open at 5. Most places seem to open at 6. A few open at 5:30.Even though GBAG is on the price-y side for me, it fit my scheduling needs. Once in a while, it's really nice to be treated on a luxe level while getting good value. And this restaurant didn't disappoint. In booking through the Open Table website, the reservation setup asked me if I had any special requests. My comment was: ""A romantic table."" When we arrived, we were ushered to a cozy back table-for-two with a sweeping view of the restaurant. The food was great. We shared a ravioli appetizer what was plated for two before it arrived. Bread basket featured four choices, from multigrain to sourdough raisin. Our two main dishes were the organic chicken with stuffing and veggies (very generous portion and very filling) and a halibut (a rather small chunk but still delicious). Dessert was the peanut butter mouse with a raspberry sorbet (a tasty but odd-looking item...the mousse was shaped like a little tube with a egg-shaped lump of sorbet on the side).

4.0,10/16/2010,"I haven't been to Gotham in years, but when it came time to celebrate my Dad's 60th, it felt like we should go with a classic, and so we chose Gotham.  There's something that feels magical about the space, even though it's so minimalist - the big white covers on the lights, the floral arrangements, the small service touches (i.e. the man with the bread basket who is always wanting to offer one of four kinds of bread, the petit fours served with coffee).   And so much was good about our experience here tonight that I'm willing to  forgive the things that weren't great. We started with two appetizers- the tuna tartare (served sculpturally- stacked and gorgeous surrounded by thinly sliced cucumbers) and a chicory and endive salad (slightly seasonally incorrect -- it was marketed as autumnal but it was very summer -- but still good).  The entrees were more varied- I had the chicken which I remembered to be a classic. The presentation was still gorgeous, but it wasn't as flavorful as I remembered, and the golden raisin stuffing and hazelnuts were just underpowered by the heaviness of the meat.  Far better was the miso marinated cod served with bok choy (which, I admit, was sliced a bit too big for my taste- a few mouthfuls were stringy and left my jaw feeling like it had to be bionic to make its way through the veggies), shiitake, and sticky rice- the taste was clean and refreshing while still complex. The steak and lamb were both solidly good.For dessert, we split the warm berry pie which was delightful and sweet without being overbearingly sweet.   The tuscan melon and lemon anise ice cream was, in my mind, unpleasant (perhaps too sour).  We loved the thick, dense, sweet, luxurious Gotham chocolate cake.The service was unobtrusive but not particularly pleasant- I've always found the Gotham service approach to be that the waiters are present but almost unwilling to engage beyond a script.  Sometimes this feels a bit like chilliness, which is how it felt tonight.  Gotham is definitely a special occasion place (entrees are $35-45), and it does so much well that it feels like the right place to celebrate an occasion.  I will say that my own tastes have changed since I was here last, and I could imagine wanting to celebrate a birthday at chic, daring Ilili where the cuisine feels riskier and more interesting.  Most everything we ate was absolutely delicious, but nothing that was intriguing, surprising, or particularly fresh.  If safe and pleasant is what you're looking for, this is your place.

The decor at Gotham is amazing - I won't describe it, just look at the pictures yourself. My descriptions won't do it justice.Given that Gotham was awarded one Michelin star this year (and has been for consecutive years), our expectations were pretty high for the quality of food we'd receive. The chefs certainly didn't let us down; BF ordered the Seafood Salad and the Grilled New York Steak, both of which were presented just as nicely as they tasted (from the little bit that I tried). I ordered the Winter Squash Risotto and the Curry Spiced Muscovy Duck Breast, both of which set standards for what I would expect in subsequent orders of risotto and duck.What's cool about their bread is that Bread People walk around with a tray of an assortment of dinner rolls that range from Multigrain to my favorite, Bacon Onion. They give you one roll (per person) at a time, and since they're constantly walking around, your bread desires are never left unsatisfied. Very attentive!This was the first time I ordered duck as an entree and I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered it medium and it was cooked to order. Medium was perfect; the duck was juicy, but not red, and not pink to the point it became dry. I was a little worried about the sauce being too overpowering, but the curry flavor in the garam masala sauce was subtle and complemented the duck nicely. It came with seared foie gras, basmati rice, and apricot chutney. Foie gras is interesting. It tastes rich and melts in your mouth like fat. In that sense it was quite tasty, but at the same time, a little gross since I felt like I was eating a slab of fat.We didn't order dessert, but received a complimentary plate of small sweets that included chocolates and a miniature key lime pie that I thought was so cute and so tasty.

Thank God that is over... my entrails have fully grown back.... but anyways, one of the few (if any) perks was having a few good restaurants in the area  like Republic, Blue Water Grill, and of course Gotham Bar and Grill. I had heard great things but sadly could not afford the full price menu on my unpaid, 9-5 five days a week internship so I waited until Restaurant Week to indulge in the $24 lunch menu which I could afford.

My water was immediately filled and my waiter, who was clad in a classy white jacket, asked me for my drink preference and even gave me suggestions for the RW menu.

My steak was a little overdone and tough, but I managed to enjoy it just fine.The weird. We were seated at our (odd and uncomfortable) table. The position of said table ensure that any waitstaff behind us was in danger of whacking me in the head as they came up or down stairs. But it was a packed house, whatever. I didn't actually get hit, so it was just my own paranoia. We waited about 10 minutes for someone to come over (we had no menus) and then they just gave us the drink menu. 15 minutes later, they came over to take the drink menus and our drink order. Still no menus. The waitress made a snarky ""oh, boozy"" comment about my partner's drink order and at the end of the night, encouraged him to order a coffee or something. Because of the booze, you see. So it was nearly half an hour before we got the damn food menus. I was ready to walk out then and there. I watched people get seated after us and order their food before we got our food menus.Well, I stuck it out and we got the menus.

We sat and waited... and waited... and then I started paying attention to how long we were waiting for things. They must have thought we looked to young to appreciate good food because they let us sit at the bar until 2:23pm. A bit ridiculous, if you ask me, but it was Restaurant Week and they may have been more busy than normal, so I'll let it slide. A waiter stopped by at 2:25pm to ask what we wanted to drink, ""water, please."" And it took 5 minutes for the water to actually make it to our table (yes, I was still paying attention to the time because we were feeling pretty neglected). At 2:35pm we were finally asked for our order and a minute later we received our bread, unlike the other tables that received bread as soon as they were seated. The whole situation just seemed sort of awkward. Our first course was received at 2:50pm and that is when things turned around because (a.) I tasted the food and (b.) our waiter was suddenly a bit more focused. The food: it was tremendous! I started with the risotto, which easily might have been the best course. It was light and fresh, not overly salty or over-done. Really, I love risotto and this one was perfection! For the main course, we both went for the salmon. It was great, but it was a bit overly salted and crunchy on the one side. For dessert, the chocolate cake with blueberry ""ice cream."" The cake was light, fluffy, and tremendously fantastic! Add to that, I don't even know if the blueberry ice cream could be classified as ice cream. It seemed to be 80% blueberry and 20% cream. It was SOOOO good. So, so, so good.

If comes in a deep plate, its was a lump of something orangey red in the middle that had the texture of avocado and the waiter pours in an olive greeen creamy soup.YUM I ordered the fish, it wasn't really expensive I think $18. they made the fish skin really crispy and the top they placed a long seashell filled with ceviche. My mom got the duck with the fois gras that was really good, better than my fish. It was a lot more expensive than mine. In the end my uncle spent like $350( not including tip). He got steak and my aunt got risotto and the other aunt got lamb. btw as a small town girl from So Cal I took a lot of their napkins from the bathroom, don't ask but it was just different from the regular napkins at other restaurants.oh and when i spilled a little bit of the soup on the table, the waiter quickly covered the stain with a napkin(:",1,2,1,Vicki C.,"Santa Monica, CA",55,47,2

5.0,8/4/2010,"Gotham Bar and Grill, part 2Last time I went I tried the Monday special prix fixe menu that they offered at the time. I was not a big fan (good not great) and decided to give GBG another shot based on the traditional menu.First impression - I forgot how open and nice the space is. Much better than Le Bernardin. And far less stuffy a crowd. A great overflowing chatter here that gives the place energy.First courseGazpachoNew to the menu. Perfect temperature. Light. Flavorful. Very nice although I don't think I would know between a very good gazpacho and a mind blowing one. This was somewhere in between.MainDuckUn-freakin-real. The duck was cooked to perfection. The foie gras was seared to heavenly perfection (yes, a cut above perfection). The sauce worked perfectly with the duck and did not overwhelm whatsoever. The chutney was great and put on the side so the diner could decide how much or little to use. The rice was a nice palate balancer in between bites of the duck. This dish along with the great service so far means GBG's 5 star yelp rating from me is their's to lose depending on dessert.DessertOn yelp, someone said the ice creams are out of this world. The cake is their signature dish. I have a dilemma. I asked the waiter and he said he tried the ice creams in the morning and the brown sugar was amazing. But the cake is the signature dish. So he said, the cake comes with an ice cream scoop (blueberry mousse) and he can swap that with the brown sugar so I can try both. Friends, this is what I call *listening and sensing* your customer. Very very nice. The 5 star review is very very much their's to lose now.Brown sugar ice creamLooks like this was brown sugar, toffee, and hazelnut. Very unique, very nice! I was not in the mood for some fruity ice cream so I am very happy with this.Choc cakeOK sir. Good Lordy Lord. The first bite confused my brain. It was rich yet light. It had layers yet was one in total. But the flavor and texture were just incredible. Defintely the best slice of choc cake I have ever ever had.Petit Fours6 count in total. The jelly was flawless and flavorful, the macaron was the best one, and the rest were excellent. The macaron was passionfruit and fennel - very different and delicious.Well well well, after a disappointing night at Le Bernadin last night, my fine dining experience in NYC has been saved by GBG.

The restaurant was alot fancier than i had imagined, with a slight conservative air to it. There were several younger diners though amongst all the old white men in suits, so i didn't feel out of place. Service was initially disappointing. My friend and I had to wait 20 minutes from when we were first seated for the waiter to take notice of us and bring us our menus. However, this picked up after and the bread basket was brought to me three times, so I forgave them. Speaking of the bread basket, there were about 6 selections of bread. The foccacia was just ok, but I loved their multigrain raisin rolls. I probably should not have filled up on this, but I was soo hungry waiting for my menu. Portions here are larger than what i've seen at other fancy restaurants. I am normally not one to refuse large portions, seeing as I was appalled how tiny the plates were at Eleven Madision Park. But i guess I like seeing more on my plate than less. Between us, my friend and I ordered the seafood salad, the goat cheese ravioli, the branzino with chorizo and the duck breast w/ foie gras. I was a little disappointed with the seafood salad. I felt they could have done much more with the dish, and I got that slight fishy after-taste, which i disliked. My friend's goat cheese ravioli was a special of the day- and that was phenomenal- it so rich and creamy, I could have eaten so much more. The flavours in the branzino and duck dishes were also just as rich. I liked that about the dishes, but it also filled me up much faster. In any case, my duck with foie gras was excellent. I liked that even with the all spices and sauces, they preserved the original duck flavour. When it came to dessert, we were so stuffed but had to try something just because. I chose the flourless chocolate cake since other yelpers had yelped so much about how that was the signature dessert.The cake came out warm and rich, served with a side of some kind of berry sorbet. I had always thought that flourless chocolate cake would be light and airy, but this definitely wasn't and after a few bites (as much as I wanted more) it was just alot of chocolate for me to handle. I do love chocolate though, so would definitely eat this again! At the end of our meal, our waiter came out with complimentary petit fours- 6 different bite-sized pieces, which were quite yummy.

Entree: The grilled hangar steak was probably the most disappointing of my meal - dry, and the slices were all unevenly grilled.  Almost as if the piece of hangar steak was pressed down more on the right side when on the grill... Some pieces were certainly medium rare as I'd ordered and others bordered on medium/well.  Kitchen is certainly ""heavy-handed"" on the salt - both the fingerling potatoes and bordelaise sauce were too salty.  Have to agree with another reviewer that of all the foods on the plate, the baby carrots were probably the most satisfying.  Dessert: Ah, the one that everyone raves about - the Gotham Choc cake.  It was extremely rich and smooth.  I quite liked it but wouldn't say it's the best I've had in the world.  The ice-cream helps with the richness of the cake... pity it was a tiny scoop that is just enough to go with about half the cake.

Next I had the salmon, which actually came out more rare than I was comfortable with, but they had no problem taking it back and cooking it a bit more even though I felt embarrassed to ask. My boyfriend had the hangar steak. I should really say and I also had the hangar steak because  Oh. My GOD. I don't even like steak, but this has absolutely made me a believer. And even more to my disbelief-- it was rare! and I loveeeddd ittt. Its honestly why I haven't raved about the salmon coming out perfectly after it came back out-- because once I had the steak, I lost interest in it... not completely, because it really was perfect in its own right. I loved it so much that my boyfriend tricked me into eating his last bite-- and he's wanted to go there for a while. For dessert, we both had the chocholate flourless. Honestly, it was good, but not the best ive ever had. It was somewhat gritty possibly and a tad too light for my taste. Too whipped and mousse like. I prefer my chocolate flourless cake to be dense, thick and rich. The ice cream next to it was by far the best I've had in New York. I really don't eat a lot and one of my favorite parts of the meal is when it was over I didn't feel disgusting. Not too full. Just really happy. And, they didn't rush us out.

It is elaborate, the Parmesan froth is there and the main course is piled on top of the veggies.Portions are generous.So in order:-Spring risotto - a clear winner!-Pea raviolis, definetly peasishI ask the waiter for counsel on the main, especially the rack of pork vs the rack of lamb. With a big grin, the ear to ear type, he says hands down the pork, rubs his massive belly and says: 'trust me I did a lot of field reasearch!"".So how can you not go for it, I mean there's inches of research staring at me, and yes it was worthed it.The steak - amazing!All in all, beautiful setting, great people around us, great food, great wine and good service.  People watching - abso-freaking-lutely!

5.0,5/7/2010,"What more can be said about Gotham that hasn't already been said. It's exactly what you expect from a high-end restaurant in New York. From the decor, to the service, and finally to the cuisine. Gotham has it all! I've been here numerous times and love how the menu changes based on seasonality. Last time I was there I had an incredible pumpkin risotto and a delicious cut of Chilean sea bass. Everything was cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly. The more I think about my last meal there, the more I want to go back! This is one of the only fine-dining establishments I've been to in recent history where you pay for the quality you're actually getting. Far too often is the occasion where you pay a high price for something that isn't what you were expecting. Definitely an excellent place to go for an important dinner or even for a business lunch.

We were offered a variety of bread from the bread basket to begin with.  I only took one piece (to avoid looking too pig-ish), but the waiter insisted on me trying more than one kind, which I happily accepted =). The bread was warm and delicious, especially the multi-grain and the onion and parmesan. They will bring around the bread basket more than once so you don't even have to hunt them down to ask for more! We started off with the black bass ceviche as an appetizer which was very flavorful and just a bit tart. Very refreshing and good to begin with. Our entrees were the miso marinated black cod and the curry spiced duck breast. Both were fantastic (I especially enjoyed the sticky rice that came w/ the cod) but I found the black cod just a tad salty...a minor imperfection.

Early but seated punctually and with friendly sentiments all around. A very nice space, it's elegant & bright, yet subdued & relaxed. Christian Bale's tirade had luckily been replaced by a delightful 'cheers' after my every word. Contrary to my initial hesitation, the bread was excellent and complemented quite well by the butter and (scoopable) sea salt. It kept coming, so that was greeaatt. Farro salad was well-flavored yet subtle; medium-rare salmon was was the helping you've always wanted ('bon apetit'? Really? Ill forgive you, man of many tongues, since it was that good); yogurt panna cotta, once the waiter understood the order (cheers), was one of the best desserts I've had since I hit puberty (I used to really like Dunkaroos). They have what they have on the prix fixe for a reason, but everything still satisfies the diner. A move of utter daring, I scaled the wall of my cholesterol-raising adventures and sampled a piece of the bread without any added sodium, and it still pleased me, so maybe I need to chillax next time around. I really liked my napkin...like...a lot a lot. It provided the perfect layout: a solid center to sag between the legs & patterned borders to give the thighs some company. The mere fact that I only had to order once and received three courses always makes me happy, especially when such a meal can be consum(mat)ed in under an hour without feeling rushed.

B and I had five courses of nothing short of amazing. Even the nuts at the bar while we were waiting - amazing. Once seated, Kyle brought us two complimentary glasses of champagne. Seriously, it's nice to know people... A special chef's tasting menu was created for us which included: White Tuna Sashimi, Winter Squash Risotto, Seared Foie Gras, Black Cod (for me), Grilled Rack of Lamb (for B), and Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse. Not to mention a full bottle of wine and wine pairings to go with two of the aforementioned courses. Risotto is one of the most common dishes that restaurants can mess up. Ha, Gotham couldn't have gotten it more right. I have a serious obsession with brussels sprouts and bacon, so once I heard that this risotto had two of my favorite ingredients, I was ecstatic. Every bite was filled with a delicious melding of duck confit, smoked bacon, brussels sprouts, and turnips. I could've died right then and there, it was THAT good.Foie Gras is controversial, but seriously this is one of the things that makes me so thrilled I'm not a vegetarian. Sorry goose liver, you are mine! The seared foie gras was a super treat for B since he had never had it before. Why not try the best at a Michelin starred restaurant? Foie gras when it's done correctly is like heaven on a plate. Do yourself a favor and try some. Both the entrees were delicious. At this point things started getting a little messy...after all, we had had champagne, a whole bottle of wine, and two additional pairings of wine. Major props to Gotham's sommelier by the way. She had really thoughtful suggestions and brought us the best wine I've ever had to drink (the Cadence and the White Sun Vintners Chardonnay). ...three hours later...I fell asleep at the table and started talking in my sleep.

I live nearby and have walked by Gotham dozens of times, always saying that I needed to check it out some time. I'm very glad I did.The place is nice; sunken and tiered seating, well dressed waiters and many dapper looking patrons. We started off with a reasonably priced bottle of red wine. Perhaps it was a Pinot Noir, I don't quite recall. My memory is about as cloudy as the cataracts that were tracing my movements to the back table we were seated at. I wasn't entirely hungry and after having been informed that Restaurant Week wasn't valid at this time, we decided to order three small plates and two entrées between the three of us. My eyes made a beeline to the Seared Foie Gras. Done. My friends agreed to get the Organic Chicken And Foie Gras Terrine and the Seafood Salad. The seared foie gras was amazing; all buttery in texture and oozing deliciousness as it slid down my throat. Mmmm. We then proceeded to play round robin with our plates so we could each have a taste. The seafood salad was crisp and refreshing and the terrine was tasty. A debate then ensued about whether seared foie gras was better than foie gras paté. I prefer the seared and they prefer the paté as they feel the seared is too rich. I wasn't about to argue as it just meant more seared foie gras for moi.For entrées we shared the Curry Spiced Muscovy Duck Breast and the Rack Of Lamb. Little did I know, but you actually order duck breast as you do beef, i.e. rare, medium, well done, etc. Also little did I realize, but this particular duck breast dish came with more seared foie gras!

I loved that they took the idea of a traditional salad and turned it into a work of art. The beets and mango were chopped into little cubes and served on a rectangular plate with nuts. The nuts definitely overpowered the salad and added a strong but interesting flavor. For my entree I had the Mezza Rigatoni with veal. Thinly sliced pieces of veil were laying on top of about 10 small pieces of rigatoni (like I said very small portions... I tried not to devour it in one scoop and managed to eat it in three.) It was delicious. It was a shame they were so skimpy. For my dessert I ate the Pavlova with ice cream on the side. Pretty good although nothing worth mentioning. Overall... Food 4/5... Decor 5/5.... Staff 5/5 (Very attentive and very helpful). I enjoyed the ambiance and the food although I would only visit during restaurant week (I think it is a better value for the money).",0,0,0,La Viajera M.,"New York, NY",45,68,14

4.0,2/1/2010,"For all of you that don't know, Gotham is a New York institution.  They've been around since '85ish, and the restaurant's head chef is Alfred Portale.  It's a one star Michelin place, which is a pretty big deal, and the food they serve is almost second to none.  I got a chance to try this place because of restaurant week, otherwise, my student budget wouldn't be able to handle the normal regular load.  First off, the atmosphere is really great here, it's a modern, classy atmoshpere, that really pairs well with their food.  As for the food:1st course:  Warm Mushroom Salad.  I'm a big mushroom guy, and this dish easily impressed me.  I really enjoyed the contrast in textures, crunch bacon and nuts, warm soft mushroom, with the fresh salad to finish.  Wonderfully done.2nd course:  Grilled Hanger steak with baby carrots and potatoes.  Potatoes were fine, and the baby carrots were also decent, but I particularly enjoyed the steak.  Hanger steak is one of my favorite cuts easily because of its really intense flavor, and this dish had all that.3rd course:  Chocolate cake with espresso ice cream.  The cake was nice and moist, and paired really well with the ice cream.  Great dish overall.I think this menu really reflects upon their restaurant.  Most RW restaurants will water down their menu's and treat you like trash, Gotham is definitely not that.  Their food is a reflection of what they will serve roughly everyday.  I definitely will be back in the far future, but until then, only RW will I come.",2,0,1,Minh L.,"New York, NY",22,193,1

Superb service from start to finish.I had a warm mushroom salad thingie for appetizer, cod for entree and chocolate cake for dessert. Salad was delicious and original, with some sort of bacon or ham bits and a perfect amount of cheese on top of thinly cut greens. Cod was cooked to perfection with the crispiest, tastiest skin and some yummy white sauce on top of delicious veggies I can not name. The cake came with a scoop of ice cream and was very yummy.My brother had the soup to start which looked delicious and I got to try his steak entree. Wow. Finally a perfectly cooked medium rare steak with lots and lots of flavor.Service was great.

Upon walking in to the restaurant, we were instantly greeted with the warm and inviting atmosphere of Gotham's spacious dining room. We were seated in a lovely corner table. We instantly were commenting on the perfection in light that was achieved in the restaurant. The space was dim enough to be romantic, yet not so dark that it caused issues in serving or seeing your food. In summary, the space is just a lovely place to dine.On to the food... After having a discussion with our exemplary waitress about the wine, we questioned her about a couple of dishes and placed our order. Shortly after, the bread guy came around with a scrumptious assortment of breads to choose from (and if you've read kitchen confidential, this is always a pleasant surprise).The food was delivered in a timely manner with impeccable plating and presentation. Our first course was the tuna tar tar, followed by the foie gras, and then the rack of lamb.  Each course was more wonderful and tasty than the previous. The tuna was fresh and delicious, served over a bed of Japanese cucumbers. The foie gras was served and served on top of a wafer that had been soaked in the pan juices of the dish while cooking. Lastly the rack of lamb was cooked to perfection and covered on one side with some sort of crusted mustard that, to say nothing else, was so zesty and smoky that it made my nipples hard. Everything about my meal and experience was utterly perfect. I am not one to give away 5 stars frequently, but this placed deserved 6 if possible.

4.0,12/1/2009,"I decided to take my guests to Gotham Bar and Grill after years of curiosity in Alfred Portale, but also because a friend is interested in working there. Gotham is world renown for their structural presentation and modern American cuisine. We had the luck of visiting during the 25th anniversary week.Luckily my table was all for sharing so we were able to sample lots of plates starting with the Sashimi of BlueFin Tuna Chu-Toro (fresh wasabi, scallion and yamamomo berriessoy yuzu dressing), a melt in your mouth mix of hot wasabi and sweet soy dressing.The American Wagyu Beef Carpaccio (parmigiano reggiano, garlic croutons and baby greens lemon mustard dressing) was just the right note to reassure that we were in for a night of truly fine dining. It ended up being the winner of the night and I have this down as a must for anyone looking to try Gotham.Gotham's Seafood Salad (scallops, squid, Japanese octopus, lobster and avocado lemon vinaigrette) a mix of quality, fresh seafood, but it needed an extra hit of lemon.The Mushroom Risotto (baby arugula, black truffle and gruyère cheese, warm porcini emulsion) was very good, but did not impress like the other dishes. I felt like I could have made it at home and maybe even improved it a bit.My main course selection was the Miso Marinated Black Cod (bok choy, shiitake mushrooms and sticky rice, soy lemongrass ginger sauce), a sweet and subtle dish that among stronger dishes may go unnoticed, but I very much enjoyed it.My partner in dining ordered the Grilled New York Steak (marrow mustard custard and vidalia onion rings, and bordelaise sauce). The marrow mustard was incredible and the onion rings avoided being overly greasy but just enough to be a guilty pleasure for all.At this point a normal person would admit defeat and not push on with the menu, but this trip needed to be educational so we gave in and ordered the Frozen Chocolate Whiskey Parfait with caramalized banana and the worlds richest malted milk shake. I should have stopped eating after one bite, but I this was no one bite dessert. It reminded me of my love of scalloped bananas and carbomb cupcakes in one dessert with some rice krispie treats!

If it's elegant presentation doesn't wow you, the taste of it will... I couldn't get enough of the sauce that the lobster was served with, and the lobster itself was delicious, just a tad overdone but better than most. Overall Gotham lived up to my expectations. The only drawback for me was my dessert. It was my birthday so I was looking fwd to having an amazingly scrumptious ambrosia-like dessert, instead my chocolate cake was way too rich.

Even places my friends recommend whose opinions I trust can disappoint - an off night, the wrong entree choice, etc. But I had heard great things about Gotham, regular and prix fixe so I figured it would be a good choice. We decided to try their 1980s favorites menu and it started off well. The appetizers were tasty, I shared the cured salmon and enjoyed the fresh vegetables it came with as well. Two of us ordered the striped bass and it was dry and flavorless. Such a disappointment. We actually saw the older couple next to us order the bass and have it exchanged - I wish I had done that too! My friend's lobster pasta was delicious and I regretted not ordering. The portion was small but the lobster was fresh and the sauce was very flavorful. Service was excellent, but such a bummer that the bass was so bad - with a decade of entrees to choose from they could have picked something tastier. Also, it is not like the meal was super cheap - their 1980s prices were still on par with many current restaurant prices.

5.0,11/9/2009,"I could right poetic verses about this place but I will spare you. Instead straight to the facts.  This place is one of the best. What separates the best from the very good? The fact that every dish that came to our table was perfect. I have had single dishes at other places that were just as good but never a complete meal that was so perfect. Since I was there with a large party I was able to try a huge portion of their menu, and wow is it good. From the 1st course to the last these dishes were amazing. Every single dish was executed to perfection from conception to planning. I'm not going to ruin these dishes by attempting to describe them but everything from the fish to the pasta and to the steak was incredible. The waiters are top notch and the type of wait staff that I expect at any establishment of this caliber. My only complaint is a slight lack of personality, a touch more personality would have been nice. The restaurant itself was beautiful but best of all I didn't get any sense of pretension which to me is really nice. With 1 Michelin star I was worried this place might have an air of pretension but it didn't; a major bonus. Many will comment on the high price; yes this place is expensive but it's important to note that you can spend this type of money at many places in NYC and get much worse food.

4.0,11/7/2009,"When you make reservations at a Michelin Star restaurant you expect an upscale level of service and a refined dining experience that is common to any Establishment recipient of that magnific Star. Gothman Bar and Grill have earned that Star. Yes indeed! Chef Alfred Portale should be proud of himself by delivering this great experience for the past 25 years. Now you are wondering why not give 5 Stars to this restaurant since I am raving so much about GBG. The answer is simple; for me to give 5 Stars, I must be blown away, swept out of my feet repeatedly dish after dish; after dish; speechless to say the least, mind baffled, without words to explain what I just ate that tastes incredibly. Although my experience was very good it was not fantastic. The service left much to be desired. Not sure if during lunch the level of service drops or it has any correlation to me not having wine or any alcoholic drink. I felt our waiter was not enthusiastic about serving us. I took advantage of the 25th year anniversary prefix lunch. Here is a list of few details along with some of my favorite dishes: The Fleur the Sel sea salts served next to the butter is a very nice touch indeed. I found myself eating 4 bread rolls. As Margaret Visser quoted: ""Salt is the policeman of taste: it keeps the various flavors of a dish in order and restrains the stronger from tyrannizing over the weaker"". GRILLED LEEK SALAD 2009 quail eggs, idaho potato, Celery and cherry tomato confit whole grain mustard dressing. This dish was nicely done I really appreciated the acid on the vegetables. DAY BOAT CHATHAM COD 2009 romanesco cauliflower, leeks and marcona almond vermouth emulsion. Fish is meant to tempt as well as nourish and the Cod dish did just that. The vermouth emulsion brought the flavor of the sea to my taste buds. GOTHAM CHOCOLATE CAKE 1985 served warm with seasonal ice cream WOW! This cake left me moist.

3.0,10/28/2009,"Michelin madness continues with a visit to the Gotham Bar and Grill (1-star) in Greenwich Village.  They have been around for 25 years, and in celebration of that, they offer a special $25 prix-fixe lunch which is worth a look.  I began with the fennel soup.  While fine, it was more complicated than it really should have been.  Rather than having a nuanced broth, the chef decided to vary the texture and flavors considerably.  There was shaved fennel, crostini, olive tapenade, olive oil, and garnish in addition to the broth.  With such complications, I think we left the realm of soup.  Individually the flavors were good, but together they did not surpass the potential of a simple fennel broth which is what I was expecting.For the entree, I had the pappardelle.  Long flat noodles that had the appearance of being made in house.  These were draped with braised veal shank, broccoli florets, diced carrots, tomato concasse, shaved fontina cheese, and veal jus.  This was a very nice dish, but it did not surpass in quality anything I could prepare myself.  Nonetheless I did appreciate the use of quality ingredients and nice flavors.  The dish could have been improved through finer knifework and the incorporation of wine into the braise.  For dessert I had the chocolate cake.  The texture was strange.  It was beyond moist.  The pastry chef clearly entered the realm of colloidal structure in this effort.  Assuredly a delight for fluid dynamicists, it was too much of a liquid for most people to consider it a cake.  The accompanying ice cream was muted in flavor.  So in short, I would probably pass on this choice.  The restaurant itself is beautiful.  I love the grand sweeping space with seating on two levels.  At the far end there are huge windows that betray a verdant mecca just beyond them.  I really felt like I was swept away from Manhattan.  And with all of the rain, the green color emanating through the window was even more intense.  For ambience, this is a lovely place to enjoy lunch.  However, the lunch itself, though reasonably priced, it not the most impressive.  3.75 stars",5,3,5,Jim U.,"Washington, DC",690,1303,3044
5.0,10/27/2009,"Extraordinary. 4.5 stars My colleague and I were fortunate enough to experience Gotham's 25th year anniversary prefix lunch today. Gael Greene has been quoted calling Gotham as ""one of the city's most important restaurants of the last 40 years"". I have not lived that long, but I can tell you, Chef Portale is the James Brown of New American Cuisine. He utilizes fresh seasonal ingredients & creates a soulful complexity in every dish. The low down: Each item on the prefix menu has a year corresponding to the debut of each dish, artfully created by Chef Portale. From my understanding, some of the dishes debuted before 2009 may not necessarily appear on the menu outside of the anniversary prefix offering. Chef Portale is a seasonal chef so his menu can change at any time. The prefix was created to showcase some of their best dishes that have graced the menu of Gotham from the last 25 years. I believe that with this menu, you will experience first hand what it takes to create a Michelin Star & 3-Star NY Times caliber establishment. Listed below are the items we selected: Grilled Leek Salad: quail eggs, idaho potato and cherry tomato confit whole grain mustard dressing - 2009 Warm Vichyssoise: potato crisp and poached leeks, extra virgin olive oil - 1996 Day Boat Chatham Cod: romanesco cauliflower, leeks and marcona almond vermouth emulsion - 2009 Grilled Hanger Steak: baby carrots and crispy fingerling potatoes in bordelaise sauce - 1989 Peach Ice Cream Cake: late harvest peaches, matcha tea sponge cake, ginger granite - 2009 Gotham Chocolate Cake: served warm with seasonal ice cream - 1985 _______________________________________________ The epilogue: Unless you're a chef or a professional critic, I will assume that you may not initially notice something significant that will be placed on the table upon sitting down. A roll, butter, & salt. Yes, you heard right. Salt. And not just any salt. Artisan Gourmet Sea Salt. Thin & flaky with earthy notes & a clean finish. This isn't yo momma's salt. This is also known as ""Chef's Salt"" costing upwards of $140 per bottle. So please, don't waste the experience, do a little homework & understand what you're consuming so you can really enjoy the experience. And so the purpose here is to sprinkle the salt on the butter then spread on the bread. Simply. Outstanding. Service was (almost) impeccable. We had a lead waitress & a server. The lead took the orders & made sure we were fully engaged in the experience. The server stayed near our section of tables ensuring filled glasses of water, a crumb-free table, & endless bread refills. If you continue to finish your roll, the server will continue to replace it. Also, I would like to have seen the lead server explain every dish that was placed on the table as this was part of her job. She clearly was not representive of the Michelin star service requirements. The space was beautiful. Nicely lit & decorated with a classic retro NY feel while keeping it classy and understated. The final verdict: A memorable experience. They drop half a star with service. I felt that the service wasn't as warm when we declined to get any kind of drinks. Bottled water just seemed right at the time. Two dishes were great and four dishes were exceptional. The best dish? The Gotham Chocolate Cake.

3.0,10/10/2009,"I'll be honest. If it wasn't for their anniversary lunch menu ($25 prix-fixe), I wouldn't go there because it's more of a occasion/corporate account meal than a casual one.  My mom has been working hard, so I wanted to treat her someplace nice. I wanted to steer away from the $8 lunch deal and opted for something fancy and a place to get pampered. I looked at the website online and realized that the lunch prix-fixe has nothing I wanted (as in not much vegetarian options) so I was forced to order a la carte.  Luckily, my mom enjoyed her meal. We were seated at a corner table, which suited me fine beacuse I love the cushioned seats.  We were served with mini french rolls (guess they provide more bread options during dinner service) and I loved the idea that the server provided them as you've consumed them, so you wouldn't waste any food.  I find it so wasteful when some restaurants present you with a whole basket of bread and the patrons never tasted it.  Now, I try not to imagine how they handle the bread - for the next patrons or to the trash? Please don't tell me. Ignorance is bliss.For appetizer, she ordered the squash soup.  Nice a creamy and not overly sweet.  For entree, it was a debate between the cod or the beef. Wanting to try something that has more history (the cod dish was created this year), she went with the beef, medium rare.  Again, nicely cooked and not tough at all (according to the eater). And finally, of course, you'd have to choose the chocolate cake.  It looked more like a triangular-sized dark chocolate mousse to me because it wasn't dense nor cakey.  That was served alone with an oval-shaped scope of homemade ice-cream.  A dessert alone would run you $13, so this prix-fixe is definitely a steal.  As for me, the chef looked around the kitchen and customized a vegetarian dish for me.  At first, I thought it would be a salad topped with avocado and some tomato and other greens, but what came out was steamed blossom squash, heirloom squash, french long beans, and half of a sliced avocado. Woh, I could never down so much avocado.  The server witnessed my look of concern and assured if everything is alright.  The squash looked beautiful, so I can't complain...except for the price. A cup of steamed vegetables and half of an avocado (granted the vegetables are probably organic) costed me $18. My gosh! Luckily, I earned back by stuffing myself with the unlimited bread. While my mom enjoyed her dessert, I felt cheap and bad to just sit there, so I also ordered a pot of Asian tea.  Funny that the server couldn't explain where the tea leaves are from. Guess he's more educated with the wine selections.  Why is tea is underrated??  Lovely tea. Just the right temperature, but really, $7 for a pot is really pushing it.  Sorry if I sounded too cheap and Gotham is a very beautiful restaurant with nice service.  The portion is just right - you feel sated, not stuffed (that is if you control your bread consumption).  I would hope that they'd put in some vegetarian options in the prix-fixe menu.  That would definitely raise the rating to a 4 star.",2,0,0,GarGuPi L.,"Flushing, NY",87,496,1696
4.0,10/7/2009,"wow...this review is way long overdue....so i've only been to gotham 4 times.  twice in 2003, once in 2004, and once in 2005.  three times i had their prix fixe lunch, and once their dinner.  and to be honest, i really don't remember what i ate (i know there was a salmon one time...and some type of beef another time as for the rest it's been too long).first time i went purely out of curiosity.  not of how the food/service is, but to see if diners could look into the apts that were facing the backside of the restaurant.  you see, i lived on e.11th street where my apt was right opposite of the back of this restaurant, separated by maybe 12ft alleyway...and my windows were about 45 degree angle above the restaurant's.  and i had a habit of walking around naked in my living room after i took showers (it's called air drying ppl)...until i noticed that there was this restaurant brimming with ppl!  seriously, i dunno how i never noticed it before. anyways, first thing any rational being would do is to cover himself and run as far as he can away from the windows.  but instead i tried to see if they'd notice some pale asian guy jumping up and down.  no one seemed to notice.  perhaps they couldn't see.  but i had to make sure.  my post shower ritual hinged on this.so the very next day, i walked in during lunch hours.  if my memory serves me correct, they had a $35 prix fixe lunch menu.  which i chose.  and it was good.  so good that i momentarily forgot why i went there in the first place.  and left with a big ol' grin at having a very fine lunch.as soon as i stepped outside, i realized that i've completely blown off the reason why i went there in the first place!  being that as it may, i decided that it wasn't such a big deal.  after all, i wanted to know if ppl could see into my apt at night.  so i promptly made a reservation for the dinner the following week and eagerly counted off the days till i could try their delicious food once again!so a week goes by and i finally convince one of my friends, chris, to go have dinner with me (i remember him threatening me that it better be worth all the $$$ since we were both poor poor students then).  we go and i remember walking in for that dinner how nice the restaurant looked.  with its high ceilings - the open airy dining room was so warmly lit and it was packed.  but nonetheless we were promptly seated for our reservation and i remember thinking ""omg why does this place look SO much more expensive at night?""  which was echoed by my friend who kicked me under the table as soon as we were seated, hissing ""dood, i don't think my credit card has high enough limit for this place!""  as he stood up, it was my turn to kick him to make sure he stays for the food.the food came and went.  and apparently my friend had high enough limit on his card to cover his portion.  and more apparently, he greatly enjoyed the dinner.  so we get up to leave and as i was about the step out into the cold nyc winter night, i stopped and RAAAAAAAAN WAY BACK TO THE BACK of the restaurant.  when i got there, i apologized to the diners as i peered out the window across the dark alley where my apt building stood.  i couldn't see anything.  hahahahahahahahahathat made my trip well worth it.  and yeah i went back a couple of more times.  and everytime it was good.  but too long ago, so i don't remember anything specific.",0,2,0,Daniel K.,"Los Angeles, CA",316,100,86

Also, I love good food. But there's so much amazing food to be had in NYC, and in that area specifically. When you pay $42 for an entree and $17 for a cocktail, it's nice to get an amuse bouche or two. -There were six of us at dinner, and the waiter hit the ""auto tip"" button!

5.0,8/31/2009,"We dined at Gotham Bar & Grill on the occasion of my husbands 60th birthday. We'd been to the restaurant before with friends who live locally. We selected it for the decor, food & service. Our 2nd visit was totally memorable and everything stellar. We had a group of eight and they were able to honor our request for the large, round table which permitted terrific dinner communication.I was very impressed with the level of service: we had a primary waiter who was supported by 5 other wait staff. They managed to achieve the perfect blend of attentiveness without hovering over us. Yet, they were available to our table whenever we needed them. The care with which they presented each dish was fantastic. They work hard and take food very seriously.All of the dishes were flavorful, artful and thoughtfully arranged on the plate. And each dish tasted unique and was different from the others. The kitchen uses a variety of spicing approaches.One especially pleasing offering was their YELLOW FIN TUNA TAR TARE tower with Japanese cucumber, shiso leaf and sweet misoasian ginger vinaigrette.The night's special of Halibut was delicious. And the array of desserts, which we shared, merry-go-round style, were spectacular due to their different forms and textures. Their decaf cappuccino was excellent.

4.0,8/31/2009,"It was 80s NIGHT! On summer Sundays at Gotham, they are bringing back their most popular dishes from the 1980s, and serving them at 80s prices. So even though I was just Livin' On a Prayer, now I'm Walking On Sunshine.  As soon as I arrived, Like a Virgin, I was giddy. I had high expectations, and I was Hungry Like the Wolf. Even though the rack of lamb on the regular menu sounded fantastic, at $42, I Can't Go For That (No Can Do). Under Pressure to decide, I ordered off the 80s menu.The garlic and onion foccacia out of the breadbasket was Just Like Heaven. Better than the foccacia at Aquagrill, which is something I never thought I'd say. Time After TIme, I asked our waiter for more because when something tastes that good, I Just Can't Get Enough.We started with the goat cheese ravioli, and quite honestly, Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This). I thought I was in for the best meal of my life. And when my hanger steak arrived, it was a nice medium rare, and the sauce was fabulous. But Every Rose Has Its Thorn, and the piece of meat just wasn't that great. Chewy and a bit stringy. You know what though? It's not The End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine).

FOOD[[ Appetizer ]] --- Chilled Sweet Corn SoupLight and refreshing, but just creamy enough. A great starter.[[ Main Course ]]  --- Mezze Ritagoni with Braised DuckThe sauce is soupy, so I was desperately trying to roll my pasta in the puddle to absorb as much flavor as I could. Mission: Failed. The duck was the real winner here. It reminded me of the texture of pulled pork.[[ Dessert ]]  --- Gotham Chocolate CakeGood god, someone bring me the whole pie. What is this, and why can't I stop eating it? II. SERVICEThe only issue I had was with the service. Granted, this was the beginning of Restaurant Week, but we were watched like a hawk to see when we were finished. My plate was gone and replaced before I even noticed. I found it a little uncomfortable, but it did help minimize my already extended lunch break. III. VERDICTFor $24.07, lunch is definitely worth it. The portions aren't huge, but enough to fill you up comfortably. No gift card at the end, but I was more than happy with the meal.

5.0,7/19/2009,"Came again for restaurant week lunch with my date and had a perfect time. Our waiter was the picture of patience and friendliness - an expert at knowing when to approach us and never once rushing our meal. For appetizers, I decided to have the chilled summer corn soup, which tasted like liquid satin transformed into corn. My date had a hell of a good time eating his asparagus salad, which included both green and white stalks, box-shaped potatoes, and a single, adorable quail egg with dijob mustard dressing on the side. What's great about such a salad is the myriad combinations one can make while eating it.  What should I do first? Combine the potatoes with the dressing? Perhaps the asparagus with the egg. It's an adventure. I decided to get the mezze rigatoni with braised duck. It was cooked al dente and didn't skimp on either the duck or the broccoli rabe. It was served in a tomato ragu and covered in parmigiano reggiano cheese. My date went for the grilled chicken sausage, which was welcomingly spicy and snappy. The vegetables, criminis, fingerlings, and jus rounded it out. If I had an extra $14 on me, I would have gone for one of the regular desserts, but I refrained and instead went for the toasted corn cake. I wasn't disappointed - in both size and taste. I've noticed that restaurant week desserts tend to be extremely basic, sparse, or even poorly made, but this was the exact opposite. The corn cake, with corn kernels strewn throughout, sandwiched a set cream filling. Beside it, a blueberry compote was spiked with just a little basil oil - having all three together was one hell of a ride. A nice tough was the lemon-thyme popsicle, best eaten as a palate cleanser before starting the real dessert.  My date had the gotham chocolate cake - an inky black dessert with a consistency and taste that nearly obliterates one into unconsciousness. It was served with crunchy cocoa nib ice cream, which he deemed sublime. Perhaps I sound like a shiller, but miracles do happen! Fancy restaurants can surprisingly be worth the money.

5.0,7/14/2009,"They say your enjoyment for food is highly influence by your experience. The people you are with, the way the light settles on your eyes when you walk in and get your first full view of the restaurant, whether the waiter is pleasant and friendly, or frustrating and foolish, and whether the chef's love for his craft is reflected in the molecules on your tongue and in the price. All these components build to be the perfect, or not so perfect night. So my friends, let me say, here you'll find a perfect night. The waiters, aside from their assigned rigidness, are friendly, completely accommodating, and most of all excellent individuals with serious care for service and their customers. I asked for his recommendation regarding a good, not too sweet dessert wine to try it out, he picked the least sweet, but I still didn't like it. He noticed it relatively untouched on the table, took it back and took it off the bill. Excellent! On to the food! Potentially the only, and best lobster risotto I have ever had. Perfect portion, sweet sauce. The risotto was perfectly well cooked, not mushy, not sticky, with a round taste. Huge chunks of risotto slipped their way onto my fork, rich flavors of lobster completing their home in my mouth. The boy ordered an incredible steak that had the crispiest outside and softest inside I've ever had on the blessed tissues of cows. Finally came the molten love of chocolate cake.

4.0,6/22/2009,"Gotham is a classy restaurant with a soft-spoken staff and an elegant, simple interior.  It would provide the perfect setting for a first dinner with a boyfriend's parents or a fiftieth birthday party.  This is not to say that it wouldn't serve other purposes just as well, but it is something of an upscale, quiet, trendless space.  The ambience is mellow and nice, but not, I suppose, inherently fun.Thankfully, the menu is modern and innovative, with delightful offerings that are several shades more colorful than you might expect from such an established place.  I went with my mom and a college friend for Sunday dinner and we ate well and had a lovely time.For starters, the bread - onion foccacia and olive - was fantastic.  I also enjoyed the tiny Barbie-sized shovel in the salt.  The three of us split three appetizers.  The black bass ceviche - with honeydew melon, hearts of palm, grapefruit, and radish in a jalapeno cucumber broth - was light and refreshing, and I enjoyed the pretty table-side pour of green broth.  The Alaskan King crab risotto - with braised artichokes, prosciutto di parma, and pickled ramps - was good, though a bit too rich.  My favorite appetizer was easily the grilled octopus served like a festive salad with yukon gold potatoes, roasted peppers, capers, and greens with a bit of a dijon mustard aioli.  The octopus was cooked just right, firm but tender with deep flavor.For our entrees, my mom and I split the Nova Scotia halibut and the miso marinated black cod.  The halibut was a nice piece of fish, but the dish was more or less uninteresting.  Served with morels, ramps, English peas, and white wine emulsion, nothing popped, and the morels even tasted a little...well morels are delicious, and these were not, so shall we say ""immorel""?  OK I take it back, don't shoot.  The black cod was much better.  It came with bok choy, shiitake, sticky rice, and a soy lemongrass ginger sauce.  All the components gelled well, and the wonderful bright brothy sauce actually made the standard miso cod Gotham's own.  I stole a good portion of my friend's crisp soft shell crab - with chanterelles, asparagus, sweet corn, brown butter aioli and white verjus sauce - and thought it was quite good, with the optimal amount of crunch.The dessert menu was somewhat uninspiring, but we ended up ordering the s'more and the Meyer lemon pudding and both were delicious.  The s'more was worlds fancier than your campfire treat, with bittersweet chocolate, toasted marshmallows, and hickory nut ice cream.  The marshmallows were amazing - not only were there little cubes, but there was one big gooey portobello mushroom cap of a marshmallow right in the middle of the plate that was both gorgeous and a delight to sink our teeth into.  The lemon pudding was another winner.  Marvelously refreshing kaffir lime sorbet and mandarin orange granita highlighted the light tartness of the pudding, and a little bit of crumble kept the ensemble grounded.The prices at Gotham are a bit brow-knittingly high, but the portions are not your usual fine dining nibbles.  We saw an order of steak go by big enough to kill a man, sitting right next to a mountain of stacked onion rings.  I left clutching my stomach in a pleasant, ""Hello food baby"" sort of way.  So while you may want to avoid Gotham for a bachelorette dinner or date #n (where n = the number of dates it takes to get you out of your clothes), don't hesitate to stop by for a leisurely, satisfying meal.",5,5,3,Steph C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3889,3532,94

On the dessert menu, the cannoli was a letdown  (in fairness, our very frank and helpful server Kristi tried to dissuade us), but the rhubarb-pineapple souffle was dreamy (as our server also rightly suggested).There's only one salad on the menu, which slightly disappoints, but it too is big enough for 2 to share.The $40 reds (Chianti, Portuguese Tinto) are just as good as some in the $50 range.",0,0,0,AM K.,"New York, NY",26,88,2

4.0,6/19/2009,"Three of us ate dinner here recently--Monday night and the place was full.  The high ceilings mean the noise level is not overwhelming--we were able to converse easily.  Our table was not the best--it was located at the major crossroads in the middle of the restaurant, and the heavy footfalls of the staff coming and going from the kitchen were felt in our chairs--but this was a minor concern.The food and service more than made up for any qualms about the table placement.  Our waitress was professional and attentive, as was the rest of the staff.  I had the chilled English pea soup, which was good, but the Masala spiced free range chicken was out of this world--tender, tender, tender, and beautifully spiced, with perfect rice.  I had the mango empanada, which was the only element of the meal that I felt misfired--the empanada tasted a bit of the frying oil, and was on the heavy side.  My companions had much better deserts--the Gotham chocolate cake is great, and the basil choc. chip ice cream served with was delicious on its own, and perfect with the cake.  The Rhubarb pinapple souffle was good as well.  My companions started with the grilled octopus (tender, delicious) and then had the duck breast, also good (although maybe a little heavy with foie gras on the side?).As nicer restaurants have moved toward $100+ prix fixes (which means $25 app, $50 main, $25 dessert), this place has more reasonable prices, and more flexibility in constructing a dinner.  Very enjoyable",0,0,0,David J.,"Jackson Heights, NY",0,84,17

5.0,5/15/2009,"Oh, Gotham, Gotham, Gotham . . .After enjoying another spectacular lunch at this delightful establishment, I decided I must finally write a review. I've never had the pleasure of dinner here (as an actor, my nights are otherwise occupied), but I make it a point to stop in at least every couple of weeks to enjoy their fabulous lunch menu (which, reduced to $25 in celebration of their Silver Anniversary, is a steal!). This time around I started the meal with a Chilled English Pea Soup. I must say I was a bit disappointed that my beloved Goat Cheese Salad was off the menu, but the soup more than made up for it! I was dubious at first; pea soup, a fall and winter staple, on a balmy spring afternoon? And yet I was pleasantly surprised; this chilled soup was not the hardy, heavy dish I was expecting, but instead was wonderfully light and refreshing! The parmesan croutons were a delight as well.This was followed by a beautifully prepared Grilled New York Steak. I must make an admission: I am a bit of a beef snob, and always take my steak sans sauce of any type, preferring to bask in the simple perfection of the meat itself with a dusting of salt and pepper. This steak is an exception; it comes lightly dressed in the most stunning bordelaise sauce, even I couldn't say no! The sauce was so terrific, as a matter of fact, that I had to ask for more bread in order to let not a drop of it go to waste! And yet the greatest joy of the steak wasn't even the meat itself, but rather the arrestingly spectacular ""twice baked potato"" served as an accompaniment. This little bar of cheesy, potatoey goodness is made with, of all things, horseradish! It packs a delicious kick! I could easily have eaten pounds of this side dish (and not have been able to fit out the door!)For dessert I enjoyed an old favorite: the Gotham Chocolate Cake. It was, as ever, perfection. There is nothing more to say. One further recommendation: if you enjoy red wine, do treat yourself to a glass of their house wine, Block 12. Too often the ""house"" wine at restaurants in New York seems like the sommelier simply ran to Trader Joe's, picked up some Charles Shaw, and stuck a new label on it. Not so at Gotham Bar and Grill! This Cab/Merlot blend was designed by beverage director Michael Nelson and it is a complex, enjoyable wine. The perfect accompaniment to the perfect meal.",1,1,1,Michael O.,"New York, NY",0,5,0
4.0,5/7/2009,"Lunch Prix Fixe, $25, 3 courses.  Asparagus Salad, Steak, and Chocoate Cake.  That is a deal, deal, steal.   And I thought the restaurant space was decorated to a style and detail as one would hope for a serious place.  However, would I be convinced to go non-deal time, not quite, not on my dime.  I appreciate I had the prix fixe food, which is probably just a level lower than the regular fare so that would make it more difficult to judge, but I am working with what I got.  Also, the service was not super top when judged against top standard.  Just being picky, they didn't ask me for my alcohol selection before the meal, and they brought the coffee before the dessert which means they don't get it when giving the experience.  A little harsh review yes, but they are trying to be a top class joint so I think it fair to review them that way.   However, if you are thinking about the meal deal, don't hesitate, head over there right now.",0,0,0,Andy B.,"New York, NY",0,48,0

I made reservations for two, and unfortunately got there late because we got lost. But they kindly accommodated us and sat us down very quickly. The server that was assigned to our table was rude, and we had to flag her down several times for some attention. Now you would expect better service coming to a 5 star establishment.

3.0,1/22/2009,"I know this place is suppose to be a classic but the food is getting borderline outdated. This is the first time I've ordered a steak in a non-steak house restaurant.

The other choices I remember were miso cod (from Nobu), grilled branzino (fish of the moment apparently), braised shortribs au poivre (another ""classic"" sauce), peking duck breast (if i want Peking duck, I'd go get Peking duck).... God, looking at their menu again, I could go on. You can say though you know what you're eating before entering so why bitch about it's choices or lack thereof? You're right, you can't fault the place for knowing the menu before hand. But my scallop crudo appetizer was one of the worst dishes I've had in a while. Something about it just wasn't appetizing as was the presentation of the dish. Based on this dish alone I would have given this place 2 stars, possibly 1. But my steak and dessert, along with service was solid, hence the 3. For this price range, I expect a little excitement, a little something new.

4.0,1/21/2009,"Somehow in my many years of New York dining experiences, I've missed this place.  Finally decided to give it a try this past week and while I wasn't at all disappointed, I can't say I was thoroughly overwhelmed either. Make no mistake though, all 4 stars are fully deserved and food is excellent. Your meal will be excellent and service is on point. The meal started with mushroom risotto which was pleasantly earthy and paired beautifully with our Shea pinot.  This for me is the dish of note.  It's  subtley sweet, with enough textural variation to keep it from becoming slush. At least 3 different sorts of mushrooms were mixed within. Sadly the black truffle on top wasn't quite as flavorful as might be expected (and yes, I know it's not a white truffle). Arugula added a bit of welcome peppery-ness, though the gruyere was underplayed. The emulsion atop was a pleasant addition, but more style than substance -- I didn't feel it did much to really elevate the dish in its entirety.  I tried a bite of my dining companion's foie gras and it was pretty unbelievable, well-executed with a slight char giving way to some seriously decadent goose. Didn't have the opportunity to investigate the rest of the dish too much but suffice it to say, the foie gras was a success. Bread was plentiful and tasty, but nothing exceptional. Butter, on the other hand, was somewhere just behind the foie gras in terms of decadence.  The sprinkling of sea salt on top really does it.For our main we split the Niman Ranch (which, interestingly, isn't even owned by Niman anymore) steak. Assuming GB&G did the air-drying for this cut, they did a solid job.  The concentrated beef-ness of air-dryed steak is truly remarkable.  The preparation was also spot on as is to be expected in a place like this.  Medium rare arrived just as ordered. Smores and cheese for desert were also delicious.Where I'm at a loss to furnish a 5th star for GB&G is in its seeming lack of innovation. Sure, it's ""the"" restaurant that defined the New York downtown dining establishment and it's still doing it well, but if classics like Le Cirque and Daniel can re-invent themselves, or at least refresh themselves, you'd expect the same form GB&G. The décor looks like a set out of an exurban Sweet Sixteen party. Food is familiar and top-notch, but  just lacks a real defining feature that makes it seem, frankly, like a restaurant coasting on its reputation. If you want a low-key dining spot downtown, GB&G will certainly do the trick.

Deserts were the apple souffle with gruyere puffs (good and creative) and a marscapone trifle. This is a hugely important and classic NY restaurant, and should be on everyone's list.

If GB&G was high school, I would have a hard time figure out which ones were the jocks, the cheerleaders and the band geeks. The only reason I gave it a 4-star was because I didn't love my entree. Of all the things I could have gotten, I got the duck, I think it was the seared foie gras in the dish that got me. Damn it.My friend and I shared the oysters which were delicious and fresh. My friend was definitely better at determining which side was freshwater and which were from the sea. I'm still not quite sure which is which but one was definitely sweeter. (I know, I'm borderline useless in this entry but please read on).For some reason when I order duck I always think of it as flaky, with an almost chicken-like consistency but in reality duck is cooked very much like steak and when it comes medium well it isn't quite the same as say, the duck in your red coconut curry at a Thai restaurant.My point is, it was a little too gamey for my taste and I had a hard time adjusting to duck cooked to the slightly raw texture of a medium rare steak.My friend got the pork chops which were so well marinated and boasted the flavors of one of my favorite spices: cumin. It was definitely sizable and wonderful to the palette. Don't forget, it is the other white meat.

The reviews here about consitency with the food and service are true, which is why, I believe, it continues to be successful. The service here is impeccable, and aside from one poor review of the service (when Jacque Pepin was dining), I would say the reviews spek for itself. They are like ninjas, gliding in to clean your table and replace your silverware during your conversation without even being noticed. In my opinion, Gotham sets the standard with service. Last night, my common law wife, Rebs and I enjoyed the starters of seafood salad, a stacked concoction of lobster, scallops, squid and octopus and avocado, and the mushroom risotto, which was ridiculously good. She opted for the miso marinated black cod which is always a winner and I went with the porcini crusted halibut, also very good. A must, and I mean MUST, is the gotham chocolate cake. Which I maintain, is the best chocolate cake you will ever have. At $190 for 2 people (1 glass of wine (I didn't drink), 1 dessert) it is quite a treat. The only consideration I would add is that the clientele is 35 and up. She and I were the only ones under 30 there.",1,0,1,Alan N.,"Morristown, NJ",81,334,8

5.0,10/7/2008,"I've frequented Gotham Bar & Grill many times for it's $31 prix-fixe lunch menu (which is a bargain imo), but whenever I get a chance to eat dinner at Gotham B&G, I still have that feeling of excitement as if it will be my first time dining at this Alfred Portale establishment!If you look back, Gotham Bar & Grill is one of the ""meccas"" of the New American Cuisine movement in New York, opening in 1984 with Mr. Portale becoming executive chef in 1985. I wonder what the pricing of their 3 course menu was back then, but I digress...When you enter Gotham Bar & Grill, you'll notice on every patron's face a feeling of contentment and joy. The decor and ambiance is very intimate for a popular, high-end restaurant. Perhaps it's due to the high ceiling room, or the lively bar on the left, but whatever it is, when you dine at Gotham Bar & Grill, there is a very inviting atmosphere for it's patrons. The service is just as intimate. Many of my friends feel a bit intimated when engaging in high-end dining, but from the hostess, to the bartender, to the waiter, there is a very friendly, non-pretentious vibe emitting from the fine staff of Gotham Bar & Grill. I read from one reviewer that he gave his waiter carte blanche with his order and asked him to bring the waiter's favorite dishes, to much satisfaction. On my most recent trip to Gotham B&G I did the same thing, and boy was I impressed! I had the sashimi, the risotto, and black cod and it was just superb! Other favorites for me include the tartare for first course, seared foie gras (seconrd course) and some main courses I particularly enjoy are the 5 spice duck breast and also the rack of lamb.There's so much to say about the food. The quality of ingredients used in Portale's dishes, the meticulous detail in presentation, how each ingredient on the platter complement each other - producing a sensational taste rarely experienced. Hopefully you'll have a chance to have that sensation as well =)",2,0,0,Gary R.,"New York, NY",34,38,2

4.0,9/30/2008,"4-1/2 stars.I'd give it 5  if it weren't for the prices. Generally, I don't think it's fair to complain about the cost of meals at top-notch restaurants such as Gotham. After all, who doesn't know they're expensive going in? But $15 for dessert? That's just silly. At least my $14 cocktail was VERY strong, easily packing the punch of two - so I'll forgive them that transgression.Otherwise, everything that's been said here is on point. The food was all delicious and the portions were perfect. Service was attentive but not overbearing. The ambience is modern, yet classic. And a special nod to the ladies' room, whose stalls include their own sinks and nice paper hand towels.I particularly recommend the pork chop and the black miso cod. The s'more dessert was phenomenal as well - the only time this rather cliche treat has not been too rich, overwhelming, and messy.

4.0,9/21/2008,"Went here on Friday for their prix fixe lunch menu.  Overall, I think the food was exceptional, however, the timing was way off!  How can you expect to eat lunch at noon and don't even leave until almost 2:30 pm!!  That was ridiculous!!!  My sister was visitng NY for literally 2.5 days, so we pretty much had to rearrange our schedule because of the very long lunch.  So def. don't plan this to be an in and out experience!!!  Anyways to the food.First course - I got the the heirloon tomato and watermelon salad.  Refreshing, light, fresh - everything you'd want for a end of the summer salad.  My sister got the beet and mango salad.  She really enjoyed it, however, the tomato/watermelon had exceptional, clean flavor.Second course - My entree was an awesome duck sausage ragu with gnocci.  Literally there was only about 8 pieces of gnocci, but each one was a pillow of heavenly delight!  AWESOME!!!  The duck sausage was good, but I'd actually like it if it was just regular duck pieces.  By the end of the plate, I grabbed my bread and started sopping the delectable juices, SO GOOD.  My sister got the NY strip.  GREAT flavor, however the paprika rub was very overpowering towards the end of the meal.Third course - I got the warm fruit tart with vanilla ice cream.  EHH.. it was OK.  Something I could definately make at home - variety of fruit, granola on top, baked, then topped with a small scoop of ice cream.  Also, got the flourless chocolate cake.  Honestly that's a hit or miss, it's suppose to be world reknown, but I didn't like it at all.  Different textural as you eat it (obviously solid, but once it hits your mouth it liquifies almost).  Give it a whirl and decide yourself.Also, got a cocktail with blueberry and peaches ($8).  Prix fixe is $31, so total with tax and tip was a little over $50.  Go check it out, it's definately cheaper to experience lunch vs. dinner.",1,2,2,Cindy H.,"Chicago, IL",100,404,1

Your friend wants proof, a meal to truly rave about. If this is the case, take your friend to Gotham.As any New Yorker worth his or her Metro Card will tell you, Gotham Bar & Grill is a modern landmark in the world of fancy Manhattan restaurants. Gotham's chef (his name...) is the unofficial founder of the 80's ""stacking"" technique in plate design, and his restaurant is one of the few that has earned a four-star review from the New York Times. Gotham is one of the handful of hyped restaurants where you pay for what you get - and I mean that in a good way.You'll obviously need some reservations and a more than decent pair of slacks, but after that, you're treated like urban royalty. The ""waiting for the waiter"" concept becomes obsolete here, as your waiter will be your meal's OnStar, ready at any time and for any request. When I went there, I ordered the tuna tartar as an appetizer. This very dish got me hooked on tartars, just J.D. Salinger and Langston Hughes did with writing. Thanks Gotham.But fret not ordinary diners - this is not just for the Wall Street crowd craving for some ""sophisticated"" food. (It's worth noting that many brokers and suit-wearing types meet clients here or have a drink with buddies after work.) Gotham is also known for making commonplace diner menu items into miniature works of culinary art. The steak I had a Gotham was one of the best I've ever had - juicy, with a memorable seasoning that had just the right amount of saltiness. The onion rings were elegant, and sautéed vegetables  were addictive. These, probably oxymorons at your local diner, make Gotham really stand out. Gotham features some of the best plate design/portions in fine dining without being pretentious. Remember that scene in ""Scent of a Woman,"" when Al Pacino and the kid go to the Waldorf?

We went for dinner last week, and I had the beet and asparagus salad as a starter, and the fish dish (which is not currently listed on Gotham's website). My boyfriend had the linguini with mushrooms to start, and the veal chop as a main. I must admit, his veal chop was so delicious I was able to forgive myself for eating baby cow, but nothing else that we had impressed me. Actually, impressed is being nice - I just didn't really enjoy my food. The fish came in some sort of vinegary sauce that was just too vinegary (but like I said, the sommelier was spot-on about the wine, and the wine perfectly complemented the vinegar in the dish).  Maybe I just didn't order the right thing, but for the prices you're paying for the food, everything better be the right thing, in my opinion.BUT - you reviewers were absolutely right about Gotham's desserts!! DELICIOUS!! And those 5 little mini-cubes they brought with the dessert (*free!*) were amazing!

Let's start w/ the positive:  *It's beautiful; *the service was excellent; *risotto was fresh and perfect;*the butternut squash soup was luscious; *the Riesling from Alsace, France was the best wine I've ever tasted; *I accidentally hit the server in the knuckles with the flat spoon (also known as the sauce spoon) and he didn't wince or cry out; *the desserts were phenomenal, Earth-shattering, lovely and they wrote ""happy anniversary"" in chocolate... awww...The negatives:*the miso-marinated black cod was raw in the middle; *the sauce was too salty; *the sticky rice wasn't sticky; *the bok choy was tough and stringy; *I ended up pushing my food around;*the NY steak wasn't that great - but then again, my husband was raised on Nebraska beef.Seriously, we were presented with sextet of miniature desserts and there was a cube of...

5.0,3/16/2008,"Most romantic date ever at Gotham Bar & Grill.When I first moved to NYC, my boyfriend and I dedicated Friday nights to ""Zagat Restaurant Night.""  Yes, we were cheesy, highlighted our picks, and tried all of the fancy schmancy restaurants we could.  Why am I telling you this?  Because out of all of the most posh and pricey places we ate at in Manhattan, I feel that Gotham Bar & Grill is the best.  Hands down.Don't get me wrong - this is a special occasion place.  I had no idea what to wear.  It was summer time and I wore a summer dress...I still felt underdressed.  We dined among Jamie Lynn Siegler and Freddie Prinze Jr. which was cool.Now onto the food.  I love the mini french baguettes they bring out - wonderful.  I follow etiquette in fancy restaurants but...I love my bread!  Gracefully placing a mini baguette on my place is much more elegant than digging through the bread basket :)  We split a salad, what kind I cannot remember, only that it was fabulous.For the main course, I ordered the lobster and still dream about that meal.  The presentation was artful and the portions were not too big and not too small - just right.  This is important because in a place where cuisine is art...one must always try the dessert.  I opted for the molten chocolate cake - a MUST!If you come here...go all out.  It's worth it and an experience you'll never forget - dine late to avoid the crowds (we came around 10:30) and then enjoy the beautiful walk along the sidestreets nearby.  (Caution: I did not pay for the meal here - but a big thank you to the one who did)",6,4,7,Nic B.,"Miami Beach, FL",320,516,60

5.0,1/10/2008,"How fitting that the creator of American ""architectural"" cuisine, the layering of food into fantastic shapes and heights, should have originated in New York, the capitol and progenitor of all things majestic in the United States. And how laudable that twenty three years later, Gotham Bar and Grill is not only still here, but keeps going from accolade to accolade, perennially a premiere restaurant in the city and the country. All credit is due to Alfred Portale and his relentless pursuit of perfection in the kitchen and on the floor.Perfectly situated in the Upper West Village, the room seemed to accommodate all of Manhattan when I walked in. Or perhaps it is only a delightful illusion of vastness that is created upon entering, the long majestic bar on the upper level that highlights the vast multi level room, a converted warehouse with huge two story walls, billowing parachute style cloth curtains and chandeliers bedecking a room motif of various soothing gradations of beige and cream. At the far end, iron paned windows reach floor to ceiling, looking out onto a soothing garden scene. Clearly, as wonderful as the room is, the food is the attraction that keeps it filled, and Portale never stops inventing. Initially a jeweler, which undoubtedly developed his aesthetics, he graduated from the Culinary School of America top of his class and rounded out his education in the kitchens of some of the most celebrated chefs in the world, both in New York and Europe. Not only is his architectural food visually appealing, it is also densely layered in flavor and sophistication. It may look modern, but it conceals his deep knowledge of classical cuisine, which he blends into his interpretation of New American cooking. Seasonal dishes and a continuously adapting menu are the norm here, and one of the reasons for the Gotham's enduring popularity.  Perhaps his greatest gift is that of a great teacher, as many of America's best know chefs have passed through his kitchen.  His influence, thankfully, continues to spread.For starters, one can order something as simple as a salad and be happily stunned at the complexity and freshness of flavors within. An Organic Beet and Orange Salad comes with some carefully placed mixed lettuce leafs, shaved fennel and feta cheese, drizzled with white balsamic vinegar, awakening all the senses of the palate, this clever balancing of root vegetable, tart citrus and rich cheese. Perhaps a Celery Root Soup, surprisingly combined with red wine poached pears and a balsamic reduction, a hint of sweet and sour subtlety on a cold winter's day. For the main course, Pappardelle with Braised Lamb and Broccoli Rabe, flavored with basil, parmigian and a white wine tomato broth, an exquisite and rich balance of flavors highlighted by the young rabe, the lamb tender as butter, the homemade pasta absorbing the delicious sauce. Or Pan Roasted Haddock served on potato puree, with Brussels sprouts and leeks in a white wine emulsion - one marvels at the perfectly cooked fish, the pairing of the vegetables, sliced very thin and balanced on top, the whole concoction floating on the potato base, the sauce blending it all together, so simple yet sublime. For dessert, the justly famous Gotham Chocolate Cake, flourless and so intensely rich, served with orange flavored chocolate crunch ice cream. For those brave few who decide to stay away from chocolate decadence, they would be amply satisfied with another excellent concoction, the Maple Creme Pot, a delicious flan custard flavored with maple and citrus zest, with candied pecans and a cranberry orange compote. Heavenly.To complement the exquisite menus a vast collection of stupendous wines are available and an expertly choreographed staff caters to the clientele's every whim. The service is impeccable, and is kept in perfect synchronization by an expert team of managers. For not only has Alfred Portale received several James Beard awards and an unprecedented four consecutive three star reviews in the New York Times, Gotham continues to place in the Zagat Top Ten most popular restaurants in New York after all these years. That perhaps is the true sign of success. One final tip - when booking your next flight, think Singapore Airlines.  Portale is now a consultant, the New York chef on their International Culinary panel. You will definitely enjoy your flight.

I think the mousse was pumpkin.. oh this review is terrible. My memory is shot. But I think that sort of means the food wasn't all that amazing.. I would advise visiting during lunch hours rather than dinner. I don't think it was really worth the $180 check for two but I'm not necessarily complaining.

Gotham is always my favorite after 12 years from my first visit.  I recommended friends about this place.

I really liked this restaurant though.  The service was fabulous, which I feel is sometimes difficult to find in NY, they really took care of us throughout the entire evening.  From helping us select great wines to always being there whenever we needed them.  The 1st and 2nd course menus were so difficult to choose from, because there were so many yummy sounding choices..In the end I split two 2nd courses with my friend, the Lobster Risotto and the Asparagus Salad.  The chefs did a great job in splitting them because each plate looked like its own mini version of the original.  Both were so absolutely delicious.  I've made lobster risotto before, and so I was particularly interested in the ingredients and flavors used.  I really liked this one. It had a tangy citrusy background, with artichoke hearts, and prosciutto...the lobster was cooked to absolute perfection.  What really was surprising was the asparagus salad.  I know it's not to hard to screw up asparagus, but this salad was on a completely different level.  First the jumbo white and green asparagus were cooked perfectly, the accompanying fern heads and morel mushrooms, and the overeasy fried egg, were really an amazing combination.  I just really loved this salad!  For my entree I got the chicken breast..Normally I don't order things that are so plain and uninventive but this dish sounded amazing.  It was an organic chicken breast with gnocchi, wild mushrooms, pancetta, broccoli rabe..I really just wanted to try the gnocchi :)  But I was pretty disappointed in this dish.  The chicken was cooked perfectly, juicy tender, but the sauce was not my favorite, the gnocchis were pretty flavorless, and the broccoli was a bit overcooked and mushy...it wasn't bad, it just really wasn't my favorite.  I did try my friends lobster tails dish though, and man was that amazing, some of the best lobster I've had in a lonnnngg time...so sweet, buttery yummy.  And then for dessert though we all shared the Gotham Chocolate Cake and the frozen Banana Charlotte.  OMG the chocolate cake, was soooooo good. I don't think I've ever tasted anything so chocolatey scrumptious..I am now adding that to what I want for my 'Last Meal on Earth'.  The banana thing was good, but nothing compared to the chocolate cake.

A good experience.As some other reviews stated, its got a bargain of a prix lunch, especially considering this is year to year one of the top 3 restaurants rated in New York.",2,1,1,Victor L.,"Brooklyn, NY",340,1059,14
5.0,3/21/2007,"I've been going to Gotham Bar & Grill for about 9 years now and have yet to be disappointed!  In fact, it still remains my favorite restaurant in NYC after all these years and not just because I have the fond memory of my husband proposing to me there ;-)The decor is very open and airy.  The staff is super attentive (as soon as you take a sip of water or finish your roll, someone mysteriously appears out of nowhere to replenish it) and professional.  They have a wonderful selection of excellent wines.  Everything that I've ever eaten there has been near perfection!  I normally get the Maine Lobster Tails because that is my all time fav, but everything is delicious and well worth the prices, which are a bit on the high side (even for NYC).  We took my parents there 2 years ago for Christmas Eve dinner and the bill came to about $700, but again - well worth it!  My Mom has a severe gluten sensitivity and the staff was amazing with her.  They all went out of their way to ensure that all of her dishes from appetizer to dessert were prepared especially for her & gluten free.Whatever you do, DON'T skip dessert here!  They have some of the best desserts in NYC - especially the Gotham Chocolate Cake, which is their signature dessert.  After dessert, they present you with a plate of complimentary mini desserts (cookies, petit fours, candy, etc.) which are equally delicious!Overall, from the food, to the service and down to the decor - this place is a must!  It's the perfect place to celebrate a special occasion.",3,0,1,Michelle L.,"NY, NY",82,170,76
4.0,2/15/2007,"Gotham was a great experience. My wife and I headed there after work on a Sunday afternoon. We didn't feel dressy dressed, so we sat at the pink marble bar to eat. Immediately impressed by the decor and lighting, we also noticed how crisp and professional the staff looked, from coat-check and hostesses to the wait-staff, and bussers. As soon as we asked the bartender for dinner menus, she set us up with these neat table tops that hooked on the edge of the bar and created a continuous surface between us. Bread service kept coming every time we finished what we had.Since we weren't too hungry (we both work in a restaurant and had eaten earlier) we shared and app and an entree. The app was the yellowfin tartare ($18.00). The chefs split it in the kitchen for us, so we didn't have to do the share plate thing. Nice touch. If the food runner hadn't told us it was split for us, I would have thought that we had two full orders. The miso and ginger vinaigrette was mildly tart and perfect with the yellowfin.The New York Steak ($40.00) was our main course, also split in the kitchen for us. The steak itself was mouth watering, cooked to a perfect medium rare, and reminded me more of a high quality filet mignon, in that it practically melted in my mouth. The Vidalia onion rings were so puffy that they looked more like small doughnuts, and were sweet and juicy. There was also a Dijon mustard and marrow flan and Bordelaise sauce that complimented the meat perfectly.Dessert was an artisanal cheese platter ($14.00).  I can't remember exactly what the cheeses were, but the platter was delicious, and a glass of icewine (compliments of the bartender) completed an awesome little dinner. With two glasses of wine, the split dinner came out to just over $100, but we felt like we had each gotten a full meal.Overall, a great dining experience, Gotham knows how to make you feel as though they really care about you. I can't wait to go there for a full meal in the dining room. I'll update this review then.",1,0,1,Mikah R.,"Stamford, CT",0,20,8
5.0,2/14/2007,"Lunch at Gotham's should be a must on everyone's New York itinerary. And it has to be lunch because that's the only time you can get a $25 prix fixe meal. Otherwise you will be ass raped.$25 gets you salad or soup (their caesar is a keeper), an entree (always salmon, which is exquisite, or a pasta), and dessert. Their flourless chocolate cake is amazing. You also have at your command a fleet of super professional servers. In fact I would say they are the most professional I've ever encountered. Our first visit, they were really attentive but at the end of the meal we were unsure how to subtly signal to them how to receive the check. (The servers were all lined up near us, but they didn't want to crowd us.) We had fun trying to guess how to do it and look like we knew what we were doing. The other visit, we realized we were one of the only parties left, and the server stood nearby at all times because he had to until we left. We finally asked him if that was the case. He said it was, but he also said not to hurry.To sum up: Awesome food. Super robot efficient servers.",6,2,2,Kathleen M.,"San Jose, CA",971,1571,134
5.0,12/28/2006,Very pricey but worth the $$$.  (Dinner $75-100 per person)I gotta say I'm impressed everything was wonderful.It was the perfect place for an anniversary dinner. They know how to prepare food so that it's flavor honors the quality of its ingredients.  The presentation sets high expectations and the food lives up to the flair. It was so beautiful in its presentation that you really hesitate before taking your first bite. They know how to focus your mind on the food that your mouth eagerly anticipates. I highly recommend the fresh seafood salad as an appetizer. It was a generous portion of select ingredients with distinct attention paid to flavors that each ingredient brings. I could have spent an hour eating it a morsel at a time.The lamb was also very good. Once again the Chef showed tender appreciation to the quality of ingredients that was used.Be sure to take someone you love(partner or friend).The experience of this food is something you want to share.,1,0,1,Dave Y.,"San Francisco, CA",40,17,8
5.0,12/20/2006,"This is one of the most elegant, sophisticated and classiest restaurants I have dined at. I loved the atmosphere. It's such a big room and you feel like you are in a park that is indoors. It's so lovely. Service was of the highest standard. The food was amazing. Had the tuna tartare to start with (stacked high). This chef (Alfred Portale) is known to stack/elevate his food in such a beautiful presentation. For the main course, I had the braised lamb with pappardelle which is my favorite pasta. It was so flavorful and filling, and the broccoli rabe was fantastic mixed in with it. For dessert, the crepes, choc cake with gingerbread icecream were hits. But the winner was the chestnut cheesecake with passion fruit puree and ice cream. Great place, will recommend to others and will go back. Yes, it's pricey but yes, it's worth it.",6,0,1,Jen L.,"New York, NY",183,268,0

3.0,12/10/2006,"We went here for my boyfriend's birthday (his parents took us) only a few weeks after we had gone to gramercy tavern for our anniversary.  Putting the two restaurant experiences so close together left me wanting much more at Gotham. They get three stars because they bill themselves as being in the Gramercy league, but I just didn't buy it.  It's not that the food was bad, just uninspired.  When someone (even if it is the bf's parents) are paying that much for dinner, you expect an experience as well as solid food.  Inspiration, creativity, something....but Gotham seemed to lack a cohesive theme for their food.   Some of it was asian influenced, some latin american, but they didn't adequately fuse their ideas together, and the dishes did not necessarily make logical food sense from one course to another.  I think there are better restaurants for the same price or even slightly less where you will get better food, better service, and a better experience.",5,1,0,Elizabeth B.,"New York, NY",51,414,0
5.0,9/23/2006,"Very classy new American restaurant. Mmmm ... my belly is still full of rack of lamb as I type this. It was cooked perfectly, and my only regret is that I didn't order the sweet corn soup (with lobster, tomato and bacon). My favorite part was the tray of little bitty desserts at the end!! My friends and I agreed that eating here makes you feel like you're in a movie. Something about the decor, and the attractive clientele and waitstaff. Of course, you pay for it too, so be smart and go here when someone else is picking up the tab. Or, take advantage of the $25 prix fixe lunch special.",1,0,1,Anita C.,"New York, NY",12,66,0

4.0,5/31/2006,"I have been coming here since the 90's, and even if the restaurant is not the 'flavor of the month' anymore, and maybe if it has slipped a bit, its still a standout in a town with so many great restaurants and so many that are simply over-hyped. If Alfred Portale's restaurant was the place to be and be seen, it was for a good reason.  The tall dishes he is so famous for creating (I believe he is the one who started this trend), had heavenly deliciousness in every bite. I especially liked the tuna tartar.  Service was attentive, without being overly stuffy, and the atmosphere was happening. Funny story:  I was once supposed to meet another couple for dinner here from out of town, and I happened to take my carI usually never drive in Manhattan, and I kept going in circles due to a one way street situation nearby.  By the time I got there, the couple had left (I was an hour late!) but when I explained the situation to the hostess, she realized how stressed out I was and gave me a glass of champagne on the house, which I had consumed at a table near the bar. (Good bar scene, by the way).   I was alone, and I was by now starving, so they seated me at a great table, and I had a most delicious meal and several glasses of excellent red wine.   I was not in the least bit uncomfortable, and the waiter and hostess kept coming over to me to chat.  The couple in NJ, they missed out big-time, unfortunately. I still feel very badly about it and owe them.  The moral: don't ever take your car downtown! And if you do, you have to stop at the Gotham!",1,0,1,Judith G.,"New York, NY",532,252,80

3.0,4/8/2006,"I've been going to Gotham for over 12 years now, and, while it is still quite good, it certainly isn't the mind-blowingly-perfect experience it was in the 90s.  Clearly, the meals are prepared and served competently, and the wines and desserts are well-thought-out.   But the service can be spotty, and the restaurant doesn't appear to be staffed with same quality it once was.  I've had situations where my waitress interjected into a private conversation (with incorrect information, mind you), and I've seen staff bad-mouth other restaurants to patrons.  In the past couple years, I've seen situations where patrons couldn't get servers' attention -- not something that used to happen.  Bad service experiences can turn even the most perfectly-tuned meal into something regrettable. Unfortunate then, that the menu has become much more hit-or-miss.  I've noticed that many of the best choices are ones that Portale put on the menu when the place was newly-opened.  Lately the kitchen seems to be more certain with its seafood, and less sure of its red-meat entrees. Now, if you go to Gotham, will you get a good meal?  Without a doubt.  You might expect a very good meal.  But, you'll very certainly be paying for it, and I'd wager you might be saying that it wasn't quite worth the cost... especially with some other choices in the neighborhood, like Mesa, Sel de Terre, Veritas, Gramercy Tavern, etc.. Take your parents there, take business clients or your boss there, and expect a dinner that is... reliable.  Unfortunately, you can no longer expect one that is magical.",2,1,1,Don M.,"New York, NY",2,25,0

4.0,2/28/2006,"I've been to Gotham Bar & Grill many times, but only twice to eat a meal. I really enjoy coming here to have dessert at the bar. You can even have a walk-in meal there if you like. There are bar tops specifically designed to cover the bar railing and provide an elevated dining platform for your pleasure. But back to dessert. I don't know if the same pastry chef is still there, but I believe she used to work, or was going to work, on Wall St. And then 9/11 happened, and she made a career change - truly for the greater good. It was a sad day indeed when GB&G took the Tahitian vanilla creme brulee off the dessert menu. A wonderfully crunchy crust and a custard that made you want to lick the ramikin. The portions were just right. Unlike the mystifying creme brulee at Keen's steakhouse (served in a bowl way too deep), GB&G's creme brule guaranteed enough crunchy crust for each spoon of custard. But enough of the past. The dessert menu changes seasonally, if not more frequently. Meyer lemon ice cream? Reimagined S'mores (check pics)? Choose one of their enjoyable teas or strong coffees (I'll take mine black, thanks) to wash it down. Just when you think you're done, some petite fours appear out of nowhere. Gratis. Have a cheap meal somewhere else and have dessert here. You'll feel like a million bucks. Oh, and the bartenders are all friendly, know the menu and can discuss the strengths of each dessert (or will inquire for you in the kitchen). I like Chikalicious, but I'm surprised that GB&G rarely comes up. Just more dessert for me. And now you.",1,0,2,Larry L.,"New York, NY",67,61,75

From the moment you walk in the door, you are treated as a guest; the wait staff is extremely knowledgable about the food and wine; and for some reason, the bread keeps coming at a rapid pace while you wait for your appetizers. It was quite astonishing, as a matter of fact--you'd reach down to finish your last bite of bread, the next moment there'd be another piece on your plate. We believe that they give their staff training in stealth and speed. We had, among the four of us, a baby organic green salad, tuna tartare, grilled steak with bordelaise sauce, roast chicken, grilled salmon, and a few other things which I didn't try. By the time the dessert menus appeared, we were all too full to even think about ordering anything else.

I loved and savored every bit. The fish was perfectly crispy and juicy with miso flavor. Not too strong. I loved the shiitake mushrooms in the sauce.   The dessert was the best part. It was a trio dessert. So I had 3 little desserts on my plate. I was torn between everything on the menu. I decided on the white chocolate peanut butter mousse, banana tarte tatain and rice crispies.
