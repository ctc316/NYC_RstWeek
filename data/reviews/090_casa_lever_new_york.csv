5.0,2/7/2019,Exquisite ambiance and taste. We went during 2/2019 Restaurant Week and place has artsy swanky vibe w the andy Warhol paintings on the walls. Food was flavorful w appropriate portions. The service was stellar from the front desk to waiters. A very memorable experience. We had the baby squid and passera clementine for appetizer. The pollo and risotto for entree and the tiramisu for dessert. All were outstanding. The tiramisu was very memorable as well-- uniquely done,0,0,0,Wallace W.,"Queens, NY",474,61,105

4.0,12/14/2018,"Solid restaurant for Italian food. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the cocktail I ordered was not good at all - the Parmigianino (a cheese-infused vodka martini)....it actually smelled like cheese :( the waiter told me that it was a cheese vodka and insisted that it was good, however when the bartender delivered it, he said ""I hope you like salty drinks!"" (And apparently I don't like salty drinks lol). The food was very good though; the veal was delicious - I was impressed since most restaurants don't do veal that well. Would also highly recommend the tuna tartare...and I rarely eat any fish, so that means quite a bit coming from me :)",0,0,0,Nicole P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0

5.0,5/3/2018,"You simply cannot go wrong with their prixe fixe menu on a Friday/Saturday night (weekends only) to draw in the crowd when it's less busy.  Same menu options, same food, as the regular $$$$ menu, but it's half the cost.  If you're willing to be ""un-cool"" in midtown on a weekend, you'll be dining somewhere where all the biggest bankers, fund managers, and business c-suite dines on weeknights.  I simply don't mind because the room is still full, buzzy, and you're sitting beneath those spectacular, rare Warhol paintings.",0,0,0,Sofia M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,20,1

The vibe is lively and the art work adds a nice modern feel. Service was nothing to write home about but was fine. I ordered the brussel sprouts side and the pasta arribiata; both were good but the arribiata was soooo tasty with the perfect amount of kick.

The restaurant is VERY loud, especially since the tables are so close to one another. The decor is definitely unique, a mix between a ""Mad Men"" setting and an Amtrak restaurant car. Definitely not my cup of tea. The crowd was an odd mix.

Drinks, I had a glass of Red the Contessa Sauvignon, Toscana very good wine. Appetizer I went for the Caprese salad very good buffalo mozzarella, good tomatoes. Main dish I tried the Cacio E Pepe such a simple dish but very tasty pecorino cheese, Italian butter & pepper hard to go wrong pasta itself was very good. As If I wasn't stuffed enough at this point can't forget the dessert, I had the Gianduia which apparently is their signature dessert & after having it I can see why, wow!! I must say very good a lot going on has a waffle type crust personally not a big chocolate fan but w this the chocolate taste is light enough that I can enjoy it.As for the restaurant nice set up, plenty of seating with a simple yet tasteful decor.

1.0,6/6/2017,"Seems nice outside and very close to my job, but because Costumer service SUCKS I give them 1 star if not half.  Not only they keep messing up the reservations I make for my boss, but they called him up with the wrong reservation date. So I called them back and asked to speak to a manager since I have 3 reservations coming up on different dates. The manager that pick up the phone was someone named Robin, someone who knows nothing about costumer service, she was rude and short. Instead of helping me resolving the problem. Not even caring to hear what I have to say. I just want to make sure he will have all his business meetings reservations in their system.. So I decided to  stop by the restaurant to introduce myself and maybe fix the misunderstanding, since the Restaurant is next door from my work. After I get there the coat check girl called ""Robin"" and she told me she was too busy (at 10:30am), to speak with me, that she would not come down as she didn't know that I was coming, so I asked her when would be a good time she told me another day until 10:30am and hang up. She was so rude that was unbelievable someone like her have a job in a Restaurant working with public.  Rude, rude, rude. Maybe she should know that this is part of a manager job, have a good costumer service skills, what apparently she has none.",0,0,0,Cacau O.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",17,5,0
5.0,5/8/2017,"Went here for a family celebration.  Very pleased.Setting aside the food, which lived up to expectations, I have to say the service is simply superlative.With three children present we were not going to be a high ticket boozy dinner with huge tip potential.  (That said, I tipped extra to help make up for it -- but the staff do not know that going in).  Service was nonetheless attentive and yet unobtrusive.  Food served to the left, taken away to the right, and no plates cleared until everyone finished their course.  No pressure.  Water glasses refilled promptly and efficiently.  I had the ""San Daniele"" appetizer.  Prosciutto and mozzarella.  Mamma mia it was good.For the main course, I doubled down on cheese and pork products and went with Spaghetti Carbonara.  Excellent.The service and food lived up to the great location and décor.  ****",3,0,0,John L.,"Wyckoff, NJ",0,51,0

4.0,1/11/2017,"I had a simple breakfast at Casa Lever for a business meet and greet and I have to say this place was the bomb.com (do not go to that site unless you want government officials showing up at your door.. been there ). The Warhol displays throughout the restaurant are a nice touch to the trendy vibe. The coat check sits above the rest of the restaurant so you can see the whole layout from the front. Once you're ready to be seated, you follow your escort (dining escort.. pervert) to your table through a descending tunnel. We were seated and told everything on the menu was good. I didn't order everything on the menu due to time constraints of my meeting but I have to say my ham/zucchini/cheese egg white omelet was the shit. Accompanied by well-prepped potatoes and house-baked bread, the meal hit the spot. I would have been content if it was brought to me by a serial killer (just finished watching the Jinx, I digress) but thankfully the service was very good and we left full and happy.

On weekends the restaurant is less full, and arriving at 6 PM, we were able to get a spacious corner booth. The food was from beginning to end wonderful, with the drinks and wines offered equally excellent. I would heartily recommend our menu choices. My spouse had the spinach ricotta gnocchi (GNUDI) and the pan-seared wild skate wing (RAZZA). I had the organic egg salad (CRISPY ORGANIC EGG), the baked eggplant (PARMIGIANA DI MELANZANE), and the osso bucco with saffron risotto (OSSOBUCO ALLA MILANESE).

3.0,9/4/2016,"Came here during restaurant week and it was pretty average. It definitely has the fancy vibes with the interior decor and the older, bougier crowd but it wasn't all that I expected a fancy restaurant to be. The restaurant week menu is tiny, as to be expected, and I got the aged prosciutto for my appetizer, a garlic and oil pasta for entree and the tiramisu for my dessert. The prosciutto was so yummy and I was very impressed at how MUCH they gave. Usually appetizers are so small in portion but I was very shocked at how much they gave. It was super stinky due to it being aged in jack Daniels but it was still pretty great. The pasta, however, was a bit disappointing. It was just average at best and nothing that excited my taste buds. And I know that garlic and oil can't be all spunky and out of this world but it wasn't even that creamy or buttery or rich in flavor. It really tasted like I could have made that at home -_-  I did however like my friends pasta which was the spicy tomato one. I didn't expect it to actually be spicy since a lot of Italian restaurants claim their dishes to be spicy and it never is, but this one actually had a nice kick to it and it was good! The tiramisu was average as well... Nothing that fancy except for the way it was served. In a nice big wine? cup and you had to crack the glazed sugar on top or something. Wouldn't really go back, I think restaurants should pay more attention and put effort into their restaurant week dishes so people can come back for more but it feels like they didn't really care for that.",1,1,0,Phoebe K.,"Flushing, NY",351,49,164

3.0,6/16/2016,"I was really excited to try Casa Lever but was disappointed with the experience. I thought that the place was really nicely decorated and warm. The service was average -- the server at our table basically ignored my party for the first 15 minutes and didn't know the prices on the specials when we asked, but the manager noticed us soon after and took our orders. I got the lunch prix fixe, which is a two course for $51 (and supplement $ for different items). The baked eggplant & mozzarella appetizer was well balanced and a great way to start the meal. The Spring chicken for my entree was really well cooked but extremely over seasoned. I tried all the components separately and the culprit was the broccoli rabe puree, which I had to avoid entirely afterwards.

In the past month and a half we have been there three times, each time with different friends  who agreed this was  a place to return to. With great food, outstanding service provided by Anna, beautiful setting and welcome management. Among the outstanding dishes we've had are:Beef Carpaccio,PARMIGIANA DI MELANZANE,soup of the day, excellently prepared pastas,CUTELÈTA ALLA MILANESE,  and etherial desserts. On weekends they have a $39 special - wow. This has become our go to fine dining restaurant - expensive but well worth it.",0,0,0,Edwin H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,58,0
4.0,10/29/2015,To start...I can't give 5 stars...4.4 is probably where I stand - just not enough to round up to 5.We went to dinner...the restaurant wasn't overly crowded - we walked right in with a reservation...maybe because I went with someone who is a frequent customer but the service was top notch. The food was good on a few and superb on others. The sommelier had a few great choice - albeit very expensive bottles but very good pairing on what we were eating.Great - service - wine - drinks - pasta - both cacio e pepe and the best meal of the day was their signature pasta dish with white truffle - very impressed with the quality and how it was cooked and served. The steaks were good - not too bad at all. We all had the NY Strip - there was one that was a special - very good sauce - and another had one on the menu which was equally good.For an expensive place - the not so great - the appetizer wasn't the best...their albacore tartar was ok - the hamachi wasn't all that impressed. Too much sauce - very little on showcasing the fish. The fish could have been subpar and they just dressed it up with a lot of sauce...Overall - would I come here without an expense account - definitely no - but the quality of the food was great. I might just come back for the pasta and cacio e pepe. I would say 4 more than 5 stars for this place and I'd like to come back again.,1,1,1,George C.,"Glendale, CA",1,20,0

It's really a shady spot under a midtown skyscraper which sometimes smells like hot garbage, and sometimes like a $25 glass of pinot grigio. As a midtown neighbor, my employer is likely responsible for half their profits. Yet each time we show up, they command $50/head ""minimum"" to sit on couches spotted with pigeon feces. The good news is $50 is two drinks.

4.0,8/6/2015,"I've been wanting to try Casa Lever for a while.  Walking by the outdoor bar, it's always a lively scene.  I came here with friends to try the restaurant week menu.  It did not start off well.  The arrogant hostess by the bar gave me attitude when I asked for the entrance to the restaurant.  Who knew you can give so much attitude with 4 words - ""It's around the corner.""  When I was joined by my friends at the table, they had a similar experience as well.  Second, we asked the sommelier for a jammy wine recommendation and he promptly said they don't a jammy wine in the entire menu.  Uh okay.  That's a first.  Then he continues to say the closest thing he has is in the $95 range.  We were hoping to spend around $60-$70 and his demeanor changed 180°.  Then he proceeds to tell us that he doesn't have anything with what we want in that price range (but he didn't have a single wine in the ENTIRE restaurant with what I wanted).  In all my interactions with sommeliers, I've never had one so condescending.  They usually try to work with your palate and budget and make suggestions based on that.Moving on...  Once we were past those two, dinner was great.  We started with complementary pea arancini which were delicious.  Our salads, were tasty - caprese and a beet/cabbage salad.  I loved my beet salad with beet vinaigrette but the cheese was a little dense.  Next up was arrabbiata with spicy tomato sauce and skate.  The original restaurant week menu is salmon but it was switched to skate.  Skate is one of my favorite fish and it was paired with lentils so I was happy.  I looked forward to dessert before we started and it did not let me down.  The gianduia is a healthy portion of wafer toppped with chocolate mousse, chocolate gelato and a hazelnut creme.  Our servers were very friendly so it made up for the beginning of the night.  Once we were done, we sat and chatted for a bit and didn't feel rushed at all.  Despite our rough start, I would come back and choose my own wine.

5.0,8/6/2015,"Had the most incredible dinner last night at Casa Lever.  The setting is impeccable with flickering candles,huge Andy Warhol's lining the walls and lots of crystal and of course the requisite fabulous looking people.  The waiter dressed in bowties and the somms and managers are an absolute delight to behold while providing impeccable, silent service that elevates your experience without intruding into the intimacy of your table.The food was extravagant and indulgent yet clean and pure all at the same time.  We had the 3 course, $35.00 restaurant week menu that was outstanding in delivery and value.  I started with a  beef carpaccio that was not only ample in portion but slightly elevated by the chef's use of a tangy earthy mustard in the dressing that I have never had before but now am obsessed with. A simple but impeccable spicy arrabiata pasta was perfectly al-dente, creamy and so delic but the piece de resistance was the interpretation of tiramisu.  It came in a huge brandy glass with pillowy layers of cream atop espresso and chocolate and I'm not sure what else but the effect was incredible rich and light all at the same time.  The wine list is a journey and an adventure and the wine director Gerardo( forgive me if I mispelled his name) and his partner Jason made sure the wine selections from the extensive and well conceived offerings paired and delighted all of us at the table.

The great things about Casa Lever are the fantastic staff providing excellent service, the design and decorations of the restaurant and the wine list. In that order.

4.0,11/22/2014,"I work nearby and I've had drinks in the outdoor area but I hadn't ever had a meal at Casa Lever.  I heard about this $39 weekend supper and decided to try it.  ""Weekend supper"" deals I guess are a thing now at this type of place around here.  I consider that to be a positive development.  So we did the $39 dollar deal on a Friday.  The place was pretty full but the service was very good.  The food was good, some dishes excellent and one surprisingly mediocre.  Our apps and the other entree were nice.  The crispy egg thing was really nice and so was the salmon tartar.  The gianduja, which I believe is one of Casa Lever's sort of well-known plates, was excellent.  For me, the main fun of going here is the interior and ambiance.  Its a great space, the lighting is nice, our table was sufficiently spaced from our neighbors, and of course the Warhols are badass.  Casa Lever is an expense-account type of place.  When your boss or a client takes you, I'm sure its fun to order the truffle menu or throw down on some nice but overpriced wine.  When you're armed with the firm Amex things could probably get adventurous.  But I personally don't know if I'd be happy with the food quality for the price if I was paying normal menu prices myself.  The prices on the regular menu are cartoonishly high (e.g., a chicken breast for like $37 or something).There are plenty of Italian places within a ten minute walk that are just as good and don't cost as much.  But those places don't remind me of a luxury spaceship, Warhol edition.  Which is why the $39 deal is the move.  At that price when a dish isn't super great its nbd, so between the food and the environment, I feel like  its worth it.  We had a lot of fun.",0,0,0,B S.,"Williamsburg, NY",0,29,0

5.0,11/7/2014,This place was wonderful. I haven't been giving out many 5s recently but it definitely deserves it. I went for dinner with my manager who was in town and my other colleagues; it was my manager's suggestion. He had apparently asked for a booth when he made the reservation as there would be 4 of us and it would be more spacey- we got it and loved it! The waitress was really nice and was on top of everything. The bread basket was really good- my favorite was the nutty bread. I started with the rainbow beet salad: wow! The goat cheese was so smooth and complemented the rest of the salad perfectly. I had the entree special of braised short ribs in polenta... It just melted in my mouth; simply exquisite. My colleague had the rack of lamb and I'm no fan of lamb but it smelled and looked amazing- he said it was really good. For dessert I had the warm cheesecake; I will just say that my only disappointment was that it was as small as it was. I usually stay away from cheesecake at restaurants because I feel like that's easy to get anywhere else but am sure glad I picked it.

4.0,10/13/2014,"Casa Lever proved they were able to put on a very pleasant change of pace Manhattan Elite Event on a Saturday evening. They entertained our small group of about 15 Yelpers amongst two tables and left no stones unturned. What was the occasion? Casa Lever was rolling out their new fall weekend prix fixe menu and wanted us to be the first to try it out. And enjoy it we did! Casa Lever accomplished that part of their mission! From the moment I first entered the restaurant I, and fellow Yelpers, were treated with the upmost service from the team of servers who remained pleasant, charming and professional. Mirko specifically was a hit with the table and provided great recommendations, as well as a noticeable entertaining sense of humor.Then there was the food and drinks. This was what Casa Lever was highlighting this special evening, and the reason for our being in attendance. The food and wine were remarkable and everyone was thoroughly impressed. The two red and white wines that were being showcased, but of course we weren't limited to, was Casa Lever's own special blend. I went with the red and though I don't consider myself as anything close to an expert, it was quite nice and refreshing with a nice aroma. My appetizer, I chose the Cured Salmon Carpaccio (crème fraîche, peperoncino oil, salmon roe, broccoli florets). It was fresh, light, flavorful, tasty and tender. What's more, the portion size was a lot larger than expected. It could have been easily shared, especially considering this was the first of three courses. Unfortunately I was unable to pull myself away. I tried to pull myself away but was unsuccessful. Oh well, ...I tried. Next for the main course I decided on the Risotto (acquerello carnaroli aged rice, artichoke purée, smoked eel). I am a sucker for risotto and couldn't manage to try anything else. It was richly flavorful, well cooked, just the right balance of eel meat and creamy, but not to thick or soupy. The consistency was spot on and like the appetizer, a nice size portion. For desert I, for the first time in the forever ever and time, went with the something that wasn't actually sweet, well sort of. Mirko came through with the great recommendation of the Formaggi, a selection of three different Italian cheeses, fresh in house backed and toasted small pieces of toast, and a sweet apricot spread. I failed at finishing it, but was able to share with the others. Lime myself, they too were stuffed and unable to finish the cheese platter, but undoubtedly enjoyed it! I was hailed as having a hit desert. Thanks again Mirko! By this time we could only slowly savor all the great flavors we'd been privy to. The restaurant is located on the corner of Park and 53rd, with the entrance on 53rd. The interior is nice and the wall lined with Andy Warhol paintings to set a kind of 70's retro feel. Casa Lever is able to offer a great weekend deal with plenty of food and wine, before heading out for a nearby dive bar if you as it gets later if you like. In regards to the ability to handle larger groups, I assure you they are more than capable. They handle our small little crowd that livened up as the night went on with no problem. Thanks Casa Lever for allowing us to come and enjoy what turned out to be a wonderful Saturday evening with you. Thank you too Ruggy for facilitating all of this.

As soon as you walk in, you are greeted by Andy Warhol portraits just casually hanging inside of the restaurant. The dim lighting and retro architecture really brings you back to the 50's/60's. The staff were great. They really made us feel welcome and took the time to talk with us and share their ideas and goals on what they are doing to take Casa Lever to the next level. The chef came out to greet us and talk us through the menu. I started out with the crispy organic egg over white asparagus. I did not know you could poach an egg and then fry it. I have never seen that before. The egg yolk was still golden yellow and oozed out of the fried shell as soon as I cut it with my knife. It was absolutely delicious! Then chef sent us out a amuse-bouche which was very generous. Now onto the risotto... Oh I was not a fan of this at all. It was supposed to be smoked eel but there was no eel. The risotto was cooked perfectly but it was so salty that the risotto tasted like it was cooked with miso soup. All I kept tasting was miso soup and it was not what I was expected. Definitely regretted getting this for my entree when I saw everyone else's! For dessert I got the Panicotta and it was perfect! Not overly sweet and great texture. Nice balance as most places make it too sweet! I would definitely come back for a nice dinner here with a date.

4.0,10/8/2014,"Classy establishment. I was lucky enough to get into a Yelp event at Casa Lever and try their new Seasonal Menu. I was blown away by the food. I can't stop raving about the Beef Carpaccio and the 36-month aged parm cheese it was paired along with. The chef introduced himself to our table and the staff was so friendly and attentive. Casa Lever is trying to cater to a younger hipper crowd, and I think that by offering their $39 pre-fix menu they will definitely draw some people in. I would also suggest perhaps offering some type of brunch deal or happy hour ? I can almost guarantee an unlimited type of brunch deal that includes mimosas or some type of specialty drink will draw the younger crowd in. Although everyone should keep in mind this is a classy place, therefore dress proper and behave yourselves. What was supposed to be a 2 hour dinner turned to almost 4 hours. We were having such a great time and the wine kept flowing. I'll definitely come back here for the pre-fix and hopefully they can work on those other specials and get the word out!

4.0,10/7/2014,"I came as part of a last-minute Yelp event.  As usual, the event itself was great.  Ruggy always gets together a good group of folks to share a well-planned experience.When we were seated, the hostess/owner of the restaurant (not sure), told us that they would like to get a younger, hipper crowd to come in on weekend evenings and that they would welcome feedback on how that might be accomplished.  I think it's important to describe the interior design and atmosphere in order to think of good ways to get the target crowd to patronize it.They already have a $39 prix fixe on the weekends with a varied selection of fine food choices.  So, it's not a price issue or quality issue.  It's mostly an ambiance issue.Location - Being in midtown East, it's definitely not in the most happening part of the city.  But nothing can be done about that.  Let's move on.Interior Design - Deliberately mid-century modern.  You feel like you may have actually gone back in time to an awesome restaurant in 1965 - but in a *good* way!  As others have said - all the walls are covered in Warhols - LOTS of Warhols.  The space is large.Atmosphere - In consideration of the interior design, it goes without saying that the goal would probably be to have the younger folks come in for a dining experience.  Nothing over-the-top can be done here, considering the possible millions of dollars of artwork on the walls.  Similarly, they probably don't want anyone *too* young who cannot appreciate what the heck is so valuable about a Warhol.So - how to get the crowd in?  We chatted about this at my table a bit.  I thought it would be important to use the bar as an anchor to get in the crowd.  The bar area is open, large and sexy.  It's visible to/from the dining area (which is sunken in comparison to the bar).  They have loads of wine, liquor, and possibly beer (not sure about the last).  If there is some sort of attraction targeted at the bar offerings, that might help get folks in to check the place and perhaps try it out for dinner.  Another gal at the table suggested doing fancy happy hour specials for the after-work crowd to introduce them to the space; then they would consider it for the weekend.  I agree with that idea.But - overall - the Saturday night crowd was full of older folks, some possibly tourists, who want a fancy place to eat in the city.  These are NOT people looking for a crowd or fun - they want a meal somewhere in the city that they can brag about its fancy-schmanciness.  This is not appealing to the younger crowd.  Food and service - basically amazing.  I cannot add anything better to what has already been said.  It was so good that I even tried the caviar!  yep - me!  who doesn't eat seafood.  And it was pretty damn good!",1,1,1,Jenn A.,"New York, NY",73,459,122
4.0,10/6/2014,"There was no way I could turn down a sampling of Casa Lever's menu when Ruggy emailed me last second Saturday morning. First off, the ambience is simply stunning here. Grand opulent chandeliers, a huge dining space with original Andy Warhol prints adorning the walls. We were discussing what would motivate a younger hipper crowd to come in for dining on weekends in a large corporate area and thought it would make a great hall for dancing. Though, not something Casa Lever is really focused on. They are focused on their fine wine selection and cooking you a great meal. For which, you can get a three-course prix fixe on the weekends for only $39. Not bad for such a ritzy place. We were warmly greeted at the door with our options of trying a prosecco, white, rose, or red wine. Their wine list is a bit pricey. But its also pretty impressive. For our dining experience we were started off with an amuse bouche of a lightly buttered crouton brioche with black caviar. It was both buttery and salty but incredibly smooth caviar. For my appetizer I had the beef carpaccio with mustarda di cremona (an Italian syrup of candied fruit and the oil of mustard), mushrooms, and 36-year aged parmigiano reggiano. First off - there were no mushrooms. But that's okay because mushrooms and raw beef together doesn't sound appealing. This was clearly the best dish I had of the night. The aged parmigiano was out of this world, mind numbingly delicious and perfectly paired with thinly shaved red beef with that smooth red wine. My main course and desert unfortunately I wasn't as impressed with. The risotto was delicious tasting: acquerello carnaroli aged rice, artichoke purée, smoked eel. It was creamy and rich and decadent. The smoked eel was something I had never had before but was an interesting savory twist. Though, I even asked someone else that had ordered the risotto if something tasted off and he agreed. The rice was slightly chewy and tasted as if it had been sitting too long or was re-heated. Also, usually you find risotto in an indented dish or bowl and not on a big wide plate. I can't imagine it wasn't cooked from fresh since the restaurant knew 20 people were coming in to try items from their weekend menu. Though, I did enjoy the garlic crisp chips resting in the middle of the risotto and understand it is a hard dish to master perfectly. Other peoples' dishes though looked and I'm sure tasted beautiful though: the scottish salmon nestled in a bath of white asparagus puree, the cappellacci covered with liquid mozzarella, roasted green circle chicken.For desert I went with the tiramisu: mascarpone, savoiardi, espresso. It wasn't a traditional tiramisu. Insert extreme disappointment. Tiramisu is my favorite desert EVER. But this time around everyone else's desert looked infinitely better. This was more of a mock on the tiramisu with turning it into a mascarpone mousse with a twirl espresso crunchy cracker resting on the top of the glass. The 10 year port desert wine I had to go with everything though was sinful. Go with the profiteroles, their cheesecake, ice cream, gelati, or even their cheese dish platter. But skip this one. I have to say though that the staff was simply amazing and really accommodating. They were around to explain every dish and wine, answer questions, my glass was constantly refilled. Despite a few flaws, definite major props to Chef Alessandro and thank you Yelp for such a wonderful culinary experience.",3,0,1,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",843,1384,11457
4.0,10/5/2014,"My visit to Casa Lever was an absolute experience. It made for a truly memorable night. I was invited to a special tasting event in which my fellow guests and I were able to sample dishes from their three course prix fixe menu, drink delicious wines, and converse with the staff and chef. I was in absolutely heaven!Seated in a gorgeous dining area, Andy Warhol prints sounding us, excellent music playing softly overhead (Beck's ""Modern Guilt""? Good call!), we perused our options carefully. They covered the gambit rather well, with many excellent salads, seafood plates, meat plates, and pasta dishes. After much back and forth of a few items, I settled upon the Rainbow Beet Salad to start with the Cappellacci de Ricotta as my main course. The salad was flavorful, the beets weren't too earthy-flavored (which doesn't bother me, but does turn others off), the snap peas added a nice crunch, and the goat cheese foam was magical. The Cappellacci de Ricotta (a close cousin of ravioli) was off the charts as well. The housemade ricotta it was filled with was perfect, the tomato sauce had a comforting stewed flavor to it, and the liquified mozzarella was certainly something else; all of the flavor and none of the bulk of regular mozzarella! Ha! For dessert, I opted for the cheesecake with barbecued strawberries, raspberries, small boba pearls, Strega, and rosemary chocolate sauce. It's a decision I will never regret. It's rather hard to convince me to come to Midtown East to eat a meal. One, out of the way for this Inwood-living gal. Two, most of the restaurants are a little out of my league in a myriad of ways.

At one point we each had three different glasses of wine at our table, rather than them waiting for us to finish a glass or ask if we were ready for the next.Most importantly though, the food was a disappointment. I had the duck risotto, which was over cooked and mushy. The sauce also had formed a film over top from sitting out too long. The sauce itself tasted like processed cheese, and while the duck ragu could have saved the dish, there was not nearly enough. The artichoke salad was decent however and our selection of desserts were quite good.

I've had a bit more cash lately (street walking) and I thought I'd surprise her with a fine dining meal (as an apology for my voluntary street walking ;) ). It was very nice! Two glasses of wine, two appetizers and two pastas came to $140 which was not cheap but was reasonable for the quality of food and service. It's beautiful there and dark and romantic and my mate was thrilled. Our server was really excellent. I mean REALLY excellent. He was just so professional and well-mannered and the food came out really fast. The octopus in spicy tomato sauce was stellar, the beet salad was delicious, and the pastas were top-notch. He paid us a lot of attention and took time explaining the wines and the dishes etc. That said, the attention he paid us, he also paid everyone else which slowed down the meal some when he brought dessert menus. He took so long to come back that within the 10 minutes when he dropped the menus, my girlfriend went from choosing two decadent things to deciding sh*t, she just wanted to go home and snuggle on the couch. So we just got the check. Not a big deal.We were waiting for him to come back for the check as well, and were becoming antsy to escape. Eventually the nice Asian lady who'd poured our wine came and took the check with my debit card. She came back and handed me the check which read $240 instead of $140! I was about to say something when she said she realized she'd done something wrong, apologized and took my card back, saying she'd fix it. When she came back, she assured me the first charge would disappear but for now, twenty hours later, both charges are there and my debit card reads $250 bucks lower balance than it should. Listen it's not going to break me or anything in the meantime and I'm sure it will disappear, fine. But for the quality of the place, and the quality of the experience we were having right til that moment, it was a monumental f*ck-up and soured our experience.

4.0,4/6/2013,"Dinner at Casa Lever in NYC on Tuesday, April 2, 2013Casa Lever, New York, NYFood: Italian.casalever.comOverall: 7.7/10 vs. restaurants priced $$$$/5.Ambiance: Exceptional. Food: Very Good. Service: Very Good.  Wine/Drinks: Very Good.  My rating scale: Exceptional, Very Good, Good, Ok, Needs Improvement, Terrible. Ambiance: Upscale trendy. Casa Lever is modern art meets upscale 1960's decor. The website gives a great depiction of what the restaurant decor looks like. The walls are scattered with Andy Warhol's. Given the location (midtown) if you want a great 'vibe' go during the week and not on the weekend when midtown feels a little desolate.  Food: I'm a bit of a tuna tartar fanatic so of course I ordered this to start. It was tasty but lacked pizzaz and it is extremely tiny. For a main I had the Filetto, which was incredible. The accompanying goat cheese coulis is very good and the small potatoes that are sculpted so the gravy nests inside were top notch. The cutlery at Casa Lever is amazing, 100% silver and the steak knife by Sambonet cut through my filet like butter. Wine/Drinks: A phenomenal selection of high end wines from Italy and decent selection from France. Where I think Casa Lever misses, and this might be on purpose, is on the mid-range wines. In the sub $100/bottle range there is a limited selection. Be prepared to drink some great wines but at a cost.Service: The waiter took a while to get into the flow with our table (took too long to take our orders), but soon after he caught his stride and was very attentive; we were a large group of 8, which is a little more difficult. Although I appreciated the staff's attention to our wine glasses, there is an ideal time to pour wine for a patron. I could only get one sip in before my glass was topped up again, and at $265/bottle, I know the ""strategy"", especially in large groups, pour and pour and open another and another, which happened in this case.Overall: I'd definitely recommend Casa Lever for someone wanting great food and great service all in a great atmosphere. It's very expensive though so be prepared for that bill.JustAGuyThatLovesFood.bl…",1,0,0,Mark H.,"Manhattan, NY",49,36,16

1.0,1/2/2013,"Service was poor poor poor.Went for dinner on a Friday night at the recommendation of the hotel concierge.  The restaurant was half empty at 9:00 PM and we only saw our waitress once.  They were out of the wine we asked for so the sommilier recommended a different wine to us without mentioning that it was triple the price of the one we had requested.  I understand that this happens but it was a little shady to say the least.  The table next to us was having a very loud - very private conversation.  We rushed though our meal in order to get away from this table (no one came to check on us for us to request to be moved).  When we finished eating we took our own wine glasses and bottle of wine and moved to the bar.  The waitress, manager, hostess did not come over once to see why we had moved.  We asked the bartender for our check from the table.  The entire time we were sitting at the bar the manger was standing talking to the hostess in our direct proximity.  It wasn't their fault that the table next to us were fighting, but for a $200 dinner it would have been nice to have not had to feel like such second class patrons.  If you are in New York - surrounded by world class restaurants - SKIP CASA LEVER.",3,3,1,Hillary U.,"Washington, DC",1,2,0

The agent scours the bar for his lady though chats it up in Italian language with the exotic bartender instead. Together they taste olives and wines of the Mediterranean while he sips his martini. Shaken, not stirred. Of Course.Seated later in the back room of Lever house, 007 scouts the well dressed wait staff that swarm through this deco Park avenue high-rise, only to discover no lead for his assignment. A frugal dark eyed man orders pastas for the table to save on the pricey entrees, though the appetizers and liquor run up the tab quickly regardless.The group is started with oven warmed breads, tender veal served with tuna puree easily mistaken for gourmet hummus, and delicious yellow tail ceviche. Happy with the meal is the event's host, though the MI6 spy attempts to enhance his evening by inviting the cocktail server from the bar to the soiree.Dinner dishes are served, risottos and pastas with meat ragu, seafood -- lobster, mussels and urchin -- the urchin Bond avoids, knowing his awful experience only weeks earlier at a sushi bar. Mr. Bond excuses himself from the event with his martini friend in hand.From that point little can be remembered as he ultimately awakes in a haze in an unfamiliar place. He escapes a water closet to find that he never actually left. It is late and the expose is seemingly vacant at this point. Suddenly the dark eyed man and exotic tender appear from the bar area, exit through the bridge tunnel to the entrance area and out the door to Park Avenue. The lead to his assignment makes itself evident and Bond follows closely behind.

Upon walking in, you will immediately notice the place is filled with mostly 30 something business professionals coming straight form work. The place itself has has a modern and classy ambiance without being too pretentious. If you can, try to get a booth along the sides of the restaurant. They are much more private and give you a good angle of the entire room while dining. On to the food....My party decided to split the Vitello Tonnato (slow roasted veal with tuna and caper sauce) to start. I am personally not a fan of tuna or capers but this dish was decent. The tuna and caper was light and not overpowering. I thought the veal could have used a little more flavor though. For my main, I ordered the gnudi di spinaci. The spinach and ricotta gnudi had a wonder soft texture and the brown butter sauce it came in was absolutely delicious. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys gnudi. My friends ordered the bolognese, agnolotti, and gnocci and everyone seemed to enjoy their dish as much as i did.Overall, my experience at casa lever exceeded my expectations. The food was good but I must admit it was nothing special, especially for the price tag.

It was a great experience from the moment we walked through the modern short tunnel into what looks like an art gallery turned into a posh upscale yet not stuffy restaurant. The first thing we noticed was the bar by the entrance filled with a chic, well dressed business crowd and serving delicious cocktails. We went with the lychee martinis to kick off the evening. After we were seated for dinner, we were immediately taken care of by a very attentive and charming waiter. He shared his recommendations for food and wine after he told us the specials of the day. We decided to go with four different pastas and were all pleased. I don't think there was a bite left on any of our plates - granted the portions were not that big but for girls trying to keep it light, it was just right. We ordered the pappardelle with slow cooked duck ragu (one of the best I have had), gnocchi primavera, linguini with lobster and spicy sauce and the spinach and ricotta dumplings (another favorite). Since we weren't ready to end the evening, we decided to splurge on dessert and ordered the pumpkin cheesecake, hazelnut tart and coffee. The desserts were light and sinfully good at the same time.

The restaurant was empty when we got there but it filled up closer to lunchtime so no matter for us, but if a table is important, make a reservation.I had the $43 prix fixe lunch menu with calamari alla piastra for starters and baccala (potato crusted cod) as a main (menu: casalever.com/menus/Lunc…). My friend had the caprese and the porcini mushroom risotto but I didn't taste it so no comments on how that was.Calamari was kind of rubbery and tough but the sauce had great flavor. Still, for the price point, I'd expect a better-prepared piece of squid.The potato crusted cod was good, but again, nothing really special. Potato crust was made of quarter-sized overlapping discs of potato, which I thought was interesting and probably quite a lot of work. I'd expected a mashed potato crust, so points for effort and style, but again no real ""Wow"" factor where flavor was concerned. It felt somewhat like I could make this dish myself at home if I wanted.Ambience was lively with many interesting art pieces, good decor, comfortable bar seats. I had a coke ($4.50) and my friend had a small bottle of still water ($6). I felt the music was a bit loud as we had to speak pretty loudly to be heard.

I asked my friend if she had any idea what the place was. She laughed at me, gawking at the fact that I've never heard of it. Of course, she's eaten there with her husband. Those two have eaten at almost every high-end restaurant in New York City.  A week or so later, after making a reservation, I made my way over to the Lever House for dinner. Dressed in my Chanel black dress, Dior shoes, and my favorite necklace from Saks, I sat down surrounded by other people dressed, like me, to impress. What did I order? I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir to start, followed by the Hamachi. Can I say delicious? The Lever House has an incredible Raw Bar, serving anything from clams to ahi tuna tartare with capers. The Hamchi is yellowtail with pomegranate seeds and lime. YUM! The food tastes great! Fresh as can be! And yes, after another glass of wine, and a very satisfied tummy, I ordered dessert.  I ordered the Case Lever Chocolate Cake, which is a flourless chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.

3.0,2/16/2011,"I had a starter of prosciutto and it was very good. The bread basket here is quite close to exceptional (the grissini are probably the best in the City - crisp, rustic, flavorful). My entree, a pear ravioli, wasn't the best choice for my appetite (it's a very small portion served on a sushi-style rectangular plate that really reads ""starter"" more than main course). In terms of flavoring and execution,  I was looking for something more pyrotechnical (the menu implied more complexity and sophistication than the dish actually presents; for example the brown butter sauce had no nutty backnote nor any  satin finish). This dish is not so much haute cuisine as it is ""hauspital food"".My sister's roasted cod, however, was much, much closer to the standard represented by this class of restaurant. This was a flawless excercise in seafood preparation (roasted to exact temperature for the absolute correct texture and flavor - in fact that's very hard to do). Yet our red wine was $24 per glass. Really? You know what? Why don't you simply take my wallet and keep it? (and my watch and shoes, too). In fairness, there were others on the wine list. Here again, we chose poorly.Breakfast on the next morning was quite good (strong coffee in an attractive silverplated service). My ex had the porridge ""done up"" fancifully and she praised it. I had a small plate of expensive roasted potatoes (""m'eh"") and a small (nanoscale) but fresh pannini (ham with cheese on what was actually a finger roll). Here again, wildly overpriced and a really small portion of good but not exceptional quality food. Why? A small fruit plate was excellent, like the freshly squeezed orange juice (bright, flavorful). Service was gracious and attentive because only two customers were present during my one hour visit. I do actually  like this concept very much and I'm willing to pay appropriately for it, but Casa Lever needs to scale up the portions substantially. I could have eaten twice the volume of food served to me here and considered this restaurant worth revisiting. Yet I'm reluctant to return because it's very, very overpriced and less satisfying than one would anticipate. Further, I'm not normally a ""value"" diner and consider my appetite and expectations to be aligned for this market (I fully understand the business model at play here and I know that it is not the Olive Garden's, yet I  objectively feel that the portioning and pricing of items on this menu is unrealistic here).Do go ahead and try Casa Lever, but please pack your Amex Black Card for the bill, and a Power Bar for the ride or walk home.",3,3,1,Monty Q.,"Manhattan, NY",0,25,0
4.0,1/28/2011,"Excellent establishment. Aside from it having the same name, just in Italian, Casa Lever bears no resemblance to the cold, boring and uninviting Lever House. One of the few really worth while places in its neighborhood.The lunch menu is fantastic, perhaps the City's best Italian lunch menu. Not a lacking version of some much better dinner menu like other Italian place such as AI Fiori. The ambiance is bright and cheerful. The service is top notch. And, the up tempo background music completes the experience.Of special note are the Vitello Tonnato and the Bolognese, each the best of their kind in the city without question. The raw bar civiches are also top notch. In fact, after several visits, nothing has missed.Last year the service was definitely bumpy. But they seem to have ironed that out. Perhaps that was opening jitters. In fact, one hostess type woman seems to do nothing but wonder around as quality control.The crowd is a nice mix of a celebrities, business folks and socialites. But, in a good, ""we're really here to eat and enjoy"" way, not in a bad ""we're all here to see who else is here way"". You can be in jeans, a jacket or a three piece suit and feel comfortable.

3.0,9/28/2010,"I came here for a business lunch last week. I really like the decor of the dining room, especially the Warhol style paintings. The lunch price fix starts at $39 for one appetizer and one entree. However, most of the appetizers and entrees that I was interested in had a mark up. To start I had the arugula, thinly sliced artichoke and parmesan salad. It was very light and tasty with a tangy lemon dressing. For my entree, I had the dover sole which was $15 on top of the price fix. It was my first time having dover sole, so perhaps I can't properly compare, but I didn't think it was worth an extra $15. It was very good and the mustard sauce on the side was delicious, but it certainly wasn't worth having my lunch cost $54. Our table also split a side of asparagus because the waiter told us how absolutely delicious it was, but it tasted just like normal asparagus. Nothing special. I might come back again to try the pastas for a business lunch. If you're looking a fancy Italian lunch place, try Alto.",0,0,0,Katie S.,"Brooklyn, NY",37,196,2
4.0,9/25/2010,"Casa Lever is among the best restaurants I have been to in NYC, and there are not a lot of places on my ""amazing"" list. Granted, the location is not ideal - who likes midtown??? - but the food more than makes up for it. The decor is also very unique: you enter through what feels like a tunnel into the interior of a modern version of the Starship Enterprise, and pop out into a pop-art mecca of Warhols, retro booths, and red tables. We called in advance to get a booth, which I recommend - you get privacy, space, and I felt like I was in my own mini-restaurant. The service was impeccable, from cocktails through dessert. The food was amazing. We started with a salad of artichokes, parmesan, & arugula, as well as an order of Polipo (roasted octopus, cannellini beans, and romanesco). My date declared that the octopus was ""the best he'd ever had,"" and this man is a seafood-aholic. I had the canneloni with vegetables - the pasta is hand made, and you can taste it. My date got the 28 oz steak, which was perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and delicious. For dessert (OH YES WE DID) we shared the flourless dark chocolate cake with vanilla gelato and a vanilla lemon semifreddo. It sounds like people tend to ""lunch"" here over quickie business meetings, but I recommend using this restaurant to appreciate what it's really here for: lounging over a serious glass of smoky scotch, eating slowly, and savoring the experience.",29,26,32,Ray J.,"Alameda, CA",1137,646,460

4.0,8/5/2010,"This is fine-dining done well.  First, the decor is lovely and elegant, but what stands out is how they don't try to cram as many tables/seats as they can into the place to maximize profits (ahem, Convivio).  Second, the food is really delicious.  Hamachi appetizer was pretty sizable and tasted very fresh.  I would probably try something else next time though because it was a little too decadent.  My friend had the house salad and it looked gorgeous (and tasted great too, according to him).  The lamb chop entree was cooked perfectly medium rare with a nice crust, extremely tender and seasoned just right.  The saffron spaetzle and carrot puree that came with it complemented the meat well.  Friend enjoyed his Dover sole very much.  Portions were generous.Their chocolate cake dessert was addictive - hints of coffee and very rich chocolate.  Wasn't entirely delicious (texture was a little too ganache-y), but I couldn't stop eating it either.Excellent spot for a classy business lunch that isn't uptight.",1,0,0,Rilly E.,"New York, NY",0,43,0
4.0,7/3/2010,"The space was awesome with original Warhols on all the walls. Service was great because the restaurant was not full. The maine lobster salad and the squid were both a bit too soggy but the san danielle prosciutto was one of the best that I have tasted and the scallops were perfectly cooked. The pasta dishes were OK except the vongole or clams were not fresh, quite fishy. The best main course was the veal milanese, excellent and the halibut was good too. So overall, we will go back if convenient but not a craving for sure. Excellent location if you stay at mid-town hotels.",0,0,0,Daniel F.,"San Marino, CA",72,60,0

1.0,5/23/2010,"Came here for a corporate lunch one day.  The service was pretty good.  The food was not unfortunately.  This place has the air of your typical expense-account restaurant.  I got an appetizer of a simple salad with fresh mozzarella.  The cheese was decent, as was the salad, but was nothing special.  The pasta I ordered as the entree was terrible, namely because the pasta itself was so undercooked it was crunchy, and white on the inside.  Paying around $30 for a plate of pasta and it turns out worse than the barilla pasta i make myself.  Unacceptable.  If you want an unexceptional expense-account-ey meal, go here, but don't order the pasta.  If you're looking for good food, and a relaxed atmosphere, go elsewhere.",3,0,0,John G.,"Seattle, WA",16,35,0
5.0,5/8/2010,"I felt compelled to, because this was quite the inspirational experience. I am not a self professed ""foodie"" (I feel like I don't know enough about food to call myself that. Its serious people!). I had what I call and ""ultimate dining experience"" here at Casa Lever. From the Andy Warhol inspired interiors to the bold punchy colors and efficiently organized space, to the perfect scale of furnishings and finishes, to the impeccably styled wait staff, and finally, to the awe-inspiring food. The hustle and bustle of this establishment, filled with businessmen and women in tailored suits during lunch hour felt reminiscent of the Old New York (a la Revolutionary Road, the movie). Description aside, this was, quite possibly, the most artfully executed lunch I have ever had. The modern Milanese fare was simple with complex flavors, unbelievably fresh, and had the ability to melt in your mouth in a delectable slow motion that one could only dream of experiencing. I didn't take the time to take quick Blackberry ""food porn"" snapshots because I wanted to experience this restaurant without interruption. Plus, as famed chef David Chang says, ""Your food is getting cold."" The $37.00 pre-fix menu was a steal.",1,0,0,Avril D.,"New York, NY",22,79,0

That and their homemade pasta!! When they say ""al dente"" this is how it should be cooked!! Perfection!! The only reason why it didn't get 5 stars from me was because I ordered hot water with a side of lemon (like how most restaurants would do it) they charged me over $3 for it.  They call it Canalino which is hot water with a lemon rind soaked inside!! I thought that was a little ridiculous cuz I only really wanted hot water.  The lemon was just an added flavor if needed. But I will definitely go back for their pasta and just not order hot water!!",1,0,0,Mee-stique K.,"San Francisco, CA",69,453,0

3.0,2/23/2010,"Casa Lever provides another stylish place to grab a drink after work in midtown.  The marble bar is welcoming, if somewhat small, the drinks are creative, and a variety of tasty snacks accompany your drinks.The service is friendly and helpful, if a little unpolished.The food, however, just OK and quite pricey.  The scallop appetizer is sizable, but the scallops were a little undercooked for my taste.  The artichoke salad is also a generous portion, but the artichockes are sliced so thin, you really don't get the full flavor of them.  As for entress, the saffron risotto is delicious and has a beautiful golden hue.  I did, however, expect a little more than a postage-stamp-sized piece of braised meat for $28.  The papardelle is pretty good, but not great.  The hazelnut dessert was delicious.In short, I definitely hope to meet up for drinks at Casa Lever in the near future, but I'll probably look for another location for dinner.",1,0,1,Rebecca S.,"New York, NY",3,6,0

2.0,11/17/2009,"I thought this place was very mediocre.  If you're going for a business dinner when someone else is fitting the bill, by all means, check it out.  But, I would much prefer a Batali restaurant or Il Mulino for my fancy Italian.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good, the ingredients were fresh but nothing was noteworthy.  The artichoke salad for a starter was good and a generous serving.  The salmon carpaccio was a disappointment.  It tasted as thought the dressing was missing or even just a spritz of fresh lemon.  When we mentioned it to the waiter, the chef or manager came over and in so many words said that's how it's supposed to be.  Pasta dishes were good, again not great.  The bolognese and lamb ragout needed to be doused in parmesan cheese for flavor.  The Veal Milanese was tasty but more in an Austrian schnitzel kind of way with a super thick fried and breaded crust.  Typically, it just has a light dusting of a crust so you barely know it's there.  Service was great though, we really liked our waiter and the free dessert they gave us because we didn't like our salmon carpaccio was delicious.",2,0,0,lyndsay s.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,20,0
