4.0,4/13/2019,"Despite not being full, the service was lacking. Drinks didn't get refilled, we weren't checked on regularly, etc. The atmosphere and ambiance we're nice, as were the menu selections. We opted for the dining room over the cafe as it had more brunch-style food choices. The food was delicious and sophisticated.",0,0,0,Jody T.,"Birmingham, AL",79,22,142
3.0,2/14/2019,I brought clients here for a business lunch and what a disappointment. They kept bringing us other tables food and our food took so long and it was just average. My small serving of sea bass was fishy and full of bones and barely room temperature. The saving grace was the great waiter and the delicious ice tea that was continually replenished. Cool to be in the Morgan's real dining room- I wish they had some of their family history written on the menus. Next time I'll try the cafe- beautiful 2 story open area with floor to ceiling windows.,0,0,0,Nikki R.,"New York, NY",0,3,0
2.0,2/2/2019,"In the past our experience at this restaurant has been fair to good but this time the food was just poor. As well as the service...the pot eu feu was an unappetizing mass of boiled glop, the risotto tasted alarmingly metallic, the tartine was tasteless with too many black truffles overpowering a slice of bread with what tasted like Philadelphia cream cheese, cold figs,and some radishes and watercress scattered over it, and why did the beef dish have olives in it?The service was way below par as well...the woman next to me was more than half the way through her meal when her wine finally arrived but first it was given to me...the waiter had no recollection of to whom it belonged. We were finished with our coffee when our cookies finally arrived which were sickeningly sweet. We were not asked if we wanted more coffee and there was no apology.I gave this review two stars because of the wonderful look of the room and I felt nostalgic since I have been a patron for years. What has happened here? Indeed there is some sadness for the disappearance of elegance left in our lives, so we are drawn here for its promise, but this faking it, this sophomoric attempt to show off and fail miserably, left me with the thought that at least the fast food eateries are genuine.",0,0,0,D F.,"New York, NY",0,9,0
3.0,2/2/2019,"I have been coming here for years and have always had the loveliest experience. However, yesterday was a sore disappointment. The entrees were good but the service was exceptionally slow. My mother and I were sitting with empty plates in front of us for at least five minutes until we had to flag down our waiter to tell him we were finished. We ordered coffee and the cookie plate. Our coffees came quickly but by the time the cookies came we had already finished our coffees. We reminded the waiter we ordered cookies and he said they're on their way. Once they arrived there were three cookies, one chocolate chip, one peanut butter chip and one oatmeal raisin. They looked and tasted like they came out of the Keebler box. We were sorely disappointed in the lack of quality in the cookies and also the fact that it took over ten minutes to take three cookies out of what seemed like a box and throw them on a plate. Nowhere on the menu did it say homemade cookies, but for $9 we were expecting something a little better; especially in comparison to their other food. And not once we we asked if we wanted more coffee. Our waiter was very nice and polite but we then had to ask for the check twice. The reason this place gets 3 stars instead of 2 is because I have experienced how good the food and service can be. But for the prices they are charging, yesterday should not have happened.",1,0,1,Gina A.,"Manhattan, NY",182,278,1
5.0,8/24/2018,"We had lunch at noon before seeing the adjoining museum, library and gift shop. I had an off-menu special to start,  a cold, creamy, almond/strawberry/grape soup. Great taste. It was blended, except for the grapes. They served appetizers with a choice of three fine breads: country, chiabatta, and dark nut ... I was a good boy and limited myself to only two slices with soft butter.  My entree was a salad, also with almonds and grapes, plus medium sized cold shrimp - one of the best salads I've had. My wife and my buddy had the branzino and his wife had the pasta of the day, which she felt had a slight bite (spicy), but that actuallly went fine with their beer. It's a fancy place, we enjoyed our dishes, talented chef, a bit pricey ($85 without dessert), but given the quality and atmosphere, I can't complain",2,0,0,Aba H.,"East Meadow, NY",7,104,112
3.0,7/18/2018,"The small dining room was a lovely place to eat. The food was well prepared by the chef and the service was impeccable. Lunching with friends, I would give four stars but the place is too noisy. We had an early lunch but mid-way through the meal we were practically shouting at each other. This is unacceptable for lunch that can easily run upwards to $40.00 with a beverage.  Management should definitely consider having ambient soft music.",0,0,0,Dani W.,"Malverne, NY",0,55,0
4.0,5/29/2018,Came here with my dad after a classical music concert at the Morgan Library. The food here is fresh and local and they have good cocktails. Service is knowledgeable and friendly. Definitely a cool place to take out of town visitors.,1,1,1,Andrew D.,"Brooklyn, NY",870,623,310
2.0,5/13/2018,"I was shockingly disappointed by the Mothers Day brunch at the morning dining room.  I would have expected for such an important occasion they'd be top of their game - but everything was mediocre and sometimes barely edible.  It was very clear much of the meal had been made in advance - e.g. complementary beignets (cold & chewy), and a desert with sponge cake that tasted incredibly stale.  It wasn't a cheap meal, and I was embarrassed I chose the place.  My mom did her best to hide her disappointment, but it was unpleasant seeing her pick around her food.  Says a lot about a place when they clearly don't respect their food - especially on such a special day.",0,0,0,Karen T.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,11,0
4.0,1/2/2018,"It is located inside The Morgan Library & Museum.  It is an upscale lunch-only American restaurant, and you do not have to pay for the admission for the Museum in order to dine here.We went for Brunch, with a reservation for four. From their Brunch menu, we ordered Vegetable Baked Eggs & Brie, Maine Lobster & Smoked Pancetta Quiche, The Pierpont Salad, and a few desserts. They were tasty, high quality, and very fresh. We enjoyed the lunch. The menu was not very large, but had a nice selection. The portion of each dish including the desserts were a bit small, but this is where the quality vs. quantity comes in. They are definitely the quality, which I was ok with, I prefer to have a smaller amount of high quality food than a whole lot of bad or not tasty food. We had a nice light brunch, tasty and high quality, relaxing and elegant. The service was good, polite and friendly, a bit slow but there was a huge group party who came in shortly after we arrived, so they got busy with them on top of all the other customers.",2,0,1,June S.,"New York, NY",212,624,4546
5.0,9/14/2017,"There are places you don't want to tell other people about because you want to keep it a secret...this is one of them. Great for drinks (there is a 3-martini lunch item) and lunch. The museum is fascinating (but expensive at $20) but dining here is reserved, tony and quiet. Food is good too. It's not for everybody but a great spot for a business lunch or when the city just gets too frenetic and you need a changeup. I've had the gazpacho before which is awesome but they were out of it at lunch today so I had an interesting Japanese style bean tofu which was packed with flavors, a bit small but intriguing and tasty. Tried the salad with chicken and bacon which was quite good and companion had shrimp dish which was devoured quickly. The break basket looked delicious although I proudly did not partake (trying to lose a few pounds). Good service, you're not rushed at all and it's great to chill out. It's a little oasis in the city in Murray Hill which is truly lacking for good choices.",3,0,2,Joe F.,"Tenafly, NJ",60,223,53
4.0,5/24/2017,"The service is impeccable, the ambiance is inviting, the location is convenient, the surrounding art collection is awe-inspiring, the prices are reasonable, and the Pan-Seared Skuna Bay Salmon, while delicious, was slightly overcooked (well-done rather than medium).",1,0,0,George S.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",21,119,197
4.0,2/14/2017,"Very nice ambiance. The soft love chairs are not too comfy, and the chic tables don't fit the rest of the museum setting. The food was very well prepared, but very little selection. I had the chicken with mashed Yukon potatoes (both very good), and my wife had flavorful trout, though with barley (meh). Cheese cake was tiny, but not bad.",0,0,0,Alex -.,"Lawrence Township, NJ",0,5,0
4.0,1/24/2017,"I've done at the cafe side before and thought I would try this formal one for restaurant week. I usually don't get good service going myself other restaurants during restaurant week. But the people here are nice and attentive even though it was under staff. Food was ok, but my server made it better experience to dine here. Smoked salmon was very good, but my main dish fish was a bit too small for me and apple turnover had almost no apples inside... a little disappointed.",1,0,0,shion a.,"Manhattan, NY",30,31,315
5.0,9/1/2016,"Impeccable service and phenomenal foodRW Summah '161) Burrata and Grilled Peppers - BEST BURRATA I'VE EVER HAD - the texture of this Burrata was unbelievable, I've never tasted a creamier center in a Burrata that was still firm on the outside. The grilled peppers confused me at first, but with the balsamic reduction, it was truly magical and complemented the Burrata very well2) Wild Salmon - A craftsmen or woman must have cooked this to the highest caliber. An absolute beautiful sear (pic) like I've never seen. Juicy, flavorful and a fresh robust quality just emanated from the fish; I had a somber epiphany for a moment of how bad Costco and farm-raised salmon are, it pales in comparison 3) Closed with a nice vanilla Panna cotta and a warm, freshly baked Madeline. I thought the food couldn't be better than the service I received because the service was outstanding, but the food delivered on all accounts, checkings savings and more!If you're on the East side of Midtown, Don't pass up on this SUMPTUOUS restaurant with world class service hidden in the Morgan Museum :)",12,4,10,Albert K.,"New York, NY",2235,456,1930

2.0,7/22/2015,"My coworkers and I went here for Restaurant Week. We had a very friendly waiter but he was very slow with service. We waited very long to receive bread and we had to eventually ask for the butter! It took a while for our plates to be cleared as well. Also when we ordered our dessert and coffee, we were served the coffee first and then served dessert. It was just a less than sub par experience.",0,0,0,raphael d.,"Germantown, MD",2,6,0

4.0,9/14/2014,"Nice space, very good food.  I had he French Toast for brunch (and the ""3 Martini sampler"") and my wife had the Pierpont Salad (and ""Onward and Upward"" cocktail).  I'd recommend everything.  The cocktails were very good and the cool thing about the 3 Martini sample is that it's supposed to be 3 mini-martinis (one with onion, one with olive and one with twist), but they put too much Grey Goose in each so you are flying after this $13 drink!Wasn't too crowded on a Sunday and the service is very elegant.  It's really a find.P.S. I reviewed museum separately.",2,1,0,Joe T.,"Manhattan, NY",5,97,4
4.0,4/14/2014,"Had a lovely brunch with 2 girlfriends. We started with the burrata, which was creamy and subtly savory; the presentation was so pretty. We then had the eggs benedict, the French toast, and the crab cake (sans prix fixe menu). The food was delicious and well-prepared. For dessert, we had the butterscotch pudding (ok, but you're not missing out by not ordering it) and the apple tart (which was wonderful). The service was very pleasant but a little hands-off. Would've appreciated being checked on and having waters refilled a little more promptly. Our waiter did notice when our white sangrias ran low and asked whether we wanted refills in a chummy manner. This was much appreciated.",0,0,0,Christine L.,"New York, NY",90,134,212
5.0,9/21/2011,"Back in 2006, this spectacular dining room received two stars from the New York Times, which hailed it as ""probably the best museum canteen in New York City."" I agree! Between the gorgeous museum and this special eatery, going to the Morgan is a great date place. The dining room was actually once the dining room in this fancy mansion. We sat right next to the beautifully carved fireplace. Service rises to the occasion, as does the food. There is a splendid assortment of $11 mixed drinks with an old time-y feel (a classic Rob Roy, circa 1890, anyone?), along with $6 beer and $10-$14 wines by the glass. All the menu entrees are thoughtful, creative and some even tie into the exhibits. I chowed down with the basic $22 roast chicken, which was tender and sheathed in a bit of exquisitely crispy skin. Our other order was the lovely $23.75 dayboat cod. Lunch came with a choice of perfect rolls. We liked the whole grain and swooned over the olive bread. There's even detail to the butter, which comes flecked with a confetti of flavorful herbs.Bookmark this place for a hot date with someone who enjoys flirting over conversations about art. P.S. -- There's also a more moderately priced cafe, which I want to check out too.",1,0,0,Betty Ming L.,"Westchester County, NY",59,357,42

4.0,10/31/2009,"I had planned on visiting the museum this weekend with the bf and noticed on their website that they have a cafe AND dining room AND the executive chef is a jean-georges alum. We are some sort of closet foodies, so I called up the dining room and made res for 2 for lunch.The dining space was modern, bright and lovely.  The bf ordered the eggs benedict which he claimed was very yummy while I got the lobster salad with shaved celery and cress, on a slice of brioche. It was so delish! i HATE celery but this combination was so good i ate everything on my plate. The best part about the Morgan dining room was the staff! They were extremely polite and helpful. I pre-ordered a bottle of champagne and requested them to serve a bowl of strawberries with that when I made the reservation. They graciously obliged and as we sat down at the table, the bubbly and berries were brought out, with no prompting. It was a very happy lunch experience for us and I'd recommend it if you're looking for a laidback setting that wouldn't break the bank.",0,0,0,Melissa T.,"New York, NY",3,65,0
