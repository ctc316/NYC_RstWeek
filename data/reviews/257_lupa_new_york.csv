3.0,4/26/2019,"Came for a date on a Saturday night and Lupa just didn't hit quite right for us this time. Even though we came pretty early, the restaurant was already quite full. Since tables are close, it was loud and we had trouble hearing each other. My boyfriend is Italian and chose the spot due to its description and backstory as a Roman Osteria. There were certainly elements that we loved - like the fresh foccacia before the meal. Others, seemed out of place, though. The salumi we ordered came arranged in a very Lunchable fashion and tasted similar too. For pasta, we had the Cacio e Pepe and Carbonara. Both were nicely al dente and the Cacio e Pepe had a great thick sauce and flavor. The Carbobara was the most disappointing dish. Instead of guanciale or pancetta, it came with bacon. Also, there were lots of greens mixed into the dish. Apparently to Italians, this is as sacrilegious as putting pineapple on pizza. This was disappointing mostly because our perception was that Lupa was a more authentic Italian kitchen.  All in all, food was good, but a bit of a let down given our expectations of more authentic Roman meal.",1,1,1,Jennifer D.,"Brooklyn, NY",947,354,618
5.0,4/20/2019,"First of all, this is the first review I have ever posted, so clearly I very much enjoyed this place. To start, we were unsure what bottle of wine was best to order. A manager walked us through the whole wine list based on what we were looking for and listed her recommendations. We took her advice and the wine was incredible (Unfortunately, I don't remember the name of it). For food, we split the carbonara, cacio e Pepe, and ragu. The ragu was good but the other two pasta dishes were absolutely amazing and incredibly authentic. When my boyfriend made the reservation on open table, he mentioned that it was for a birthday. Without mentioning that to the waitress during the meal, they still brought over our dessert with a candle in it and wished him a happy birthday. The waitress was also very attentive to both our wine glasses and water glasses and never let them go empty. Me and my boyfriend left feeling extremely satisfied with our decision to go there and will definitely be going back the next time we're in NYC.",0,0,0,Sami C.,"Barnstable, MA",0,1,0
2.0,4/15/2019,Really mediocre in every way. I don't understand what the fuss is about this place. Tons of better atmosphere/food experiences and not cheap either.,0,0,0,Tina D.,"Mamaroneck, NY",0,23,0
1.0,4/15/2019,"I'm writing this on my way home from the restaurant. Let me preface this by saying that I love the food and love coming here. However, it's a terrible shame they have not properly trained their hostess in having humanity/etiquette. I am over 8 months pregnant and the hostess refused to let me sit until my party was complete and my friend arrived. Mind you I'm huge and look like I'm 10 months pregnant and am clearly now uncomfortable. Incredibly impolite and just flat out wrong to not be courteous of a pregnant woman. It reflected terribly on the restaurant and its entire staff.",0,0,0,Jackie S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0
5.0,4/8/2019,"I don't take it lightly when I say this is amongst​ the best Italian​ food in NY. The pasta with duck, the house-made​ salumi. Amazing​ but obscure wine list.

4.0,4/6/2019,"We love the warmth of this Roman osteria, which has an approachable and relaxed feel; but that unassuming nature doesn't translate to the food, which is decidedly excellent. A great choice for a cozy, Italian night out. The food is done right. An honest, straightforward approach lets the ingredients take center stage and really highlights a classic style of Italian cooking. Naturally, this only works if the execution is on point, and it is. The pastas, as expected, are awesome and not to be missed. Certainly a highlight. Incredible list of Italian wines, with a great mix of classic benchmarks and value-oriented choices. Don't come to Lupa without taking advantage of the top-notch wine program. Lupa is one of our favorite choices for casual, upscale Italian in NYC.Atmosphere-Cozy, old world type of feel with exposed brick and basic furnishings. The design is rather nonexistent.-Expect tightly spaced tables, the space is small.-Casual, come as you are.FoodThe Roman fare is uncomplicated, which really allows the flavors, quality ingredients and spot on execution to shine through. Appreciate this 'true' approach to cooking, and it really means each dish focuses on the flavors. High points certainly included the pastas and dessert, though everything was tasty and well executed. We enjoyed:- Radicchio with Citrus, Fennel & Pecorino ($16): Characteristically bitter, but the pomegranate is a nice offset, wish the fruit elements were amped up a tad for better balance.- Burrata with Kabocha Squash & Chestnut ($16): Spicy, savoriness from the squash; quite unique and well-balanced. Not too large.- Cavatelli with Sausage & Broccoli Rabe Pesto ($20): Amazing! The flavors are so harmonious, and broccoli rabe pesto lends nice depth and offset to the subtle spiciness of the sausage. So perfect for the fall/winter. Highly recommend!- Bucatini All'Amatriciana ($19): Another winner, the pasta is cooked perfectly. Red sauce has just the right amount of acidity, and pancetta adds lovely rich flavor. Highly recommend!- Saltimbocca ($29): Very thinly pounded veal, topped with prosciutto and a touch of sage. The meat is delicate, with a light crust. Tasty, but presented without any flair.- Olive Oil Cake with Quince Confettura & Sesame Gelato ($12): Dense, but good for two to share. Olive oil is perceptible, but not overwhelming. Quince pairs so well, and the gelato helps balance the density/richness of the cake. Incredible!BeverageThe wine list at Lupa is not to be missed, and naturally is 100% Italian. Very impressive quality, and to be sure it's got some pretty (expensive) heavy hitters. However, there is a balance with many many bottles sub $100. Some really great finds! We loved the 2013 G.B. Burlotto Monvigliero Barolo ($175), which was actually presented at a very reasonable price point, all things considered. Please don't overlook the wine list on your visit! Extensive collection of Amaro to conclude. Give it a try! Easy to get overwhelmed, but the staff are happy to provide guidance. We liked the Cardamaro ($9) which was recommended by the somm. Service- Casual (but in a good way), approachable and relaxed. Pretty attentive.- Very accommodating, they helped move us (and others) when the temperature was not agreeable.",0,0,0,D. L.

5.0,3/18/2019,An intimate restaurant. The wine selection is unbelievable and the small dishes and starters are superb. Some of the best pasta I've eaten. If you go the Apricot Roccota Cheesecake is a must have. It'll be gone in 30 seconds whether you are full or not.

5.0,3/14/2019,"YUM! I loved this place. Pasta is my all time favorite food, and this place did not disappoint. Service was great as well. I will say the food is filling and you probably don't need as much as you think. We ordered a ton and ended up getting so full before the final 2 dishes came out. Honestly we had forgotten that we even ordered the last 2 dishes, and when they came we we're like OMG we cannot finish this no way. Delicious food, good portion, great service. I definitely recommend!",0,0,0,Lauren C.,"Austin, TX",470,49,325
2.0,3/10/2019,"We arrived on time for our 815pm reservation and were told that tables were finishing up dessert and we are welcome to get drinks at the bar. The bar had no seats available and we were crowding into tables with nowhere to stand or sit.  After about 15-20minutes, we were seated towards the back. The waitress didn't come to take our orders for at least 30minutes- and even then it was a different person than our original waitress. We ordered our meals, received our appetizers and finished our appetizers before getting our first round of drinks (these were thankfully comped). Once we got our entrees, they were pretty tasty (cacio e Pepe and carbonara) but at no point during our meal did anyone come over and ask if everything was good.It took another 20minutes after finishing our dessert to get our check (we had to ask the bus boy for it) and then had to call our waitress over to take the check once we were ready. Overall, horrible service but good food. To be fair, the food came out in a timely manner once it was ordered.

5.0,2/24/2019,"My husband and I were in town for the weekend, couldn't get a reservation but decided to walk in instead around 7pm. The hostess was very friendly and accommodating and was able to sit us at the bar after waiting about 30-40 minutes. She let us know several times how many were ahead of us and what was going on, which was appreciated. Our bartender (Matt I believe) was excellent, made some wonderful suggestions for our cheese board and desserts. Even though the restaurant is small and was very busy on a Saturday night we never felt rushed. And the pasta dishes were excellent!

5.0,2/17/2019,"Food here is consistently top-notch. I have yet to find an Italian restaurant that beats Lupa. Favorite dishes:Carbonara--Despite being a relatively simple dish, the flavor in the Carbonara is incredibly rich and creamy. Cavatelli is always a must for me when I come here.Cacio e Pepe is also phenomenal. The lamb may be expensive but its worth every bite. Steak is also very good.I haven't worked my way through many of the appetizers but the salads have always been great.I really recommend eating family-style when coming here.

5.0,2/17/2019,"Sitting alone as a single female at the bar to eat, I expect uncomfortably scant service.* Can't you get a date? Don't you have any friends? You're going to leave a crappy tip, aren't you Single Lady.  Not Lupa, and not Matt, who guided me through my dinner, making sure I picked the right wine to go with my primo (pasta) following a special antipasto that he made sure didn't have anything I was allergic to. (No  on the ""allergic"" thing. We're talking Epi-Pen, not preference.) Everything was delicious. I felt part of the big long table of the bar.

5.0,2/16/2019,I am always hesitant to go back to a restaurant where I had such an outstanding meal because often it doesn't live up to my memories.  Well Lupa proved me wrong. Amazing meal the second time. Again had the marinated sardines which makes me want to replicate this at home. Spinach salad one of the best. Homemade pasta with black truffles. Broccoli rabe the best I've ever had. What a meal. Only thing lacking was the weak focaccia but who wants to fill up on bread.,0,0,0,Debbie E.,"Setauket- East Setauket, NY",2,94,1
3.0,2/15/2019,"Solid place with a few good pasta dishes on the pasta tasting menu. The only issues were: 1. quite expensive for a bunch of pasta (though it was a lot of food, we paid $230 all in for 2 people, one $45 of wine, no apps or desert) and 2. TERRIBLE music. I really don't understand why they had basically a wedding playlist playing at an Italian restaurant, which had an otherwise great ambiance. This was also On Valentine's Day. Once you notice the music, you can't go back.",0,0,0,Mike G.,"New York, NY",0,4,0
4.0,2/5/2019,"I once read in an magazine interview Julia Roberts said this is her favorite place to grab a bowl of pasta, so naturally I had to come and check out Lupa. I saw that they had a tasting menu and of course, the idea of having bowl after bowl of pasta is appealing to just about everyone, and I didn't know how to choose just one to sum up a restaurant's experience! The pasta at Lupa is super tasty, and any dish with the guanciale is TO DIE FOR. It is probably the best tasting bacon-esque thing that I have ever eaten. Insider tip, if you get the tasting menu, you can take leftovers of each home in small boxes. It's a LOT of just straight up pasta and sauce. There's not much meat, vegetables, or any other mix ins, so get ready for a lot of carbs.",0,0,0,Amy F.,"New York, NY",201,73,115

5.0,1/26/2019,"Came here for lunch during NYC Restaurant Week Winter 2019, and it was amazing. We made a reservation on a Tuesday afternoon and the restaurant was practically empty! It's pretty spacious inside and there are a lot of tables. We started off with bread as well as a complimentary appetizer (can't remember the name of it). The bread was so soft and the olive oil was delicious--the server brought two rounds!I ordered the Broccoli Sformato to start and the Orecchiette as my entree. I was debating between the Stracciatella alla Romana (soup) and the Broccoli, and I'm so glad I ended up going with the Broccoli. The server had described it as being like flan, so I had a tough time imagining broccoli-flavored flan, but the dish was soooo delicious. It literally melted in my mouth and the combination of flavors worked together perfectly. The Orecchiette was pretty good as well, but the pasta was cooked a little too firm... Ended up taking half of it home and it still tasted great as leftovers!

2.0,1/20/2019,"Ok the the star rating would have been higher because the food was exceptional BUT the service.....oh man what a let down. The first waiter was attentive and courtieous but before our appetizer came he let is know that another server would be taking his place. Ok no problem is what we thought but was I wrong. First our three course meals came...slowly but they still came. I was only upset cause my 7 year old was getting hungry but she's tough she waited. But after the third course there was nothing. No 'How is everything' No refilling of our beverages No can I taken your empty plates nothing. Nothing for 30 minutes. Other patrons who came after us were promptly taken care of while we say and waited. Then after 30 minutes a gentleman came over and asked if I was finished. To which I replied in was finished over 20 minutes ago. I excused myself to the rest room and when I came back expecting coffee for us and ice cream for my kid but my wife's face said a different story. She said get the check I want to leave now. Ok no problem. I got the check paid and we left. Outside she tells me while we were at the bathroom they came cleared the played and that was it. She asked one of the guys for a desert menu and he didn't even offer one but said ""oh you want you desert?"" She said yes and coffee but since you brought everyone else menus and asked them I guess we're not good enough so forget it. He said to her...""ok"" and walked away. Really? So glad for YOUR staff she didnt tell me this inside because you would have not only heard my mouth EVERYONE would have heard my mouth. How hard is it to wait on everyone equally? Maybe my skin color isn't right?  Was that it? Was the hipster white kids behind us who ordered two bowls of pasta with water yet got allot of attention better than us? Seriously you see she was upset so a simple sorry and bringing menus isn't too hard. Real sad part.... This isn't the first time we've been here.

3.0,1/6/2019,"Not the best for my first time. The real stars of the show were lacking. Cacio e pepe was strong, but not the best i've had in the city. The pepper flavor was incredibly overpowering (it needed more salt, less pepper), and the pasta came out a little drier (not enough cheese or sauce) than I expected. The carbonara was a disappointment. Barely any meat (or any ingredients really) and generally lacking in flavor. I've had much better carbonara. The bucatini pasta was undercooked and i found a few bites of the pasta straight up crunchy or hard, though the sauce was nice. The saltimbocca agnolotti was absolutely delightful and meaty and ended up being my favorite.The olive oil cake really punches you in the mouth with olive oil flavor, and it's delicious. The free crostini and foccacia were delightful. Salumi options were great and the beet salad was incredibly flavorful. The restaurant is a stickler when it comes to the tasting menu. Either the whole table gets it, or no one does. We had one vegetarian in the group, and the restaurant was not willing to accomodate her so the rest of the group (there were 5 of us) could not do the tasting menu. Frankly, at $59pp, i think it's a better deal to split pastas. The restaurant will split, the portions are bigger, and you can create your own tasting menu. Four of us got 2x 8 plates of pasta and shared, and ended up with a more wallet friendly dinner that came with more food. Service is slow though our waiter was great. In classic NY fashion, tables are incredibly crammed with barely any room to move. I will return to give it a second chance but wasn't that impressed first time around. 3.5 stars.",0,0,2,Stef S.,"San Francisco, CA",132,779,6

5.0,12/24/2018,"Every time I have a craving for some amazing pasta, Lupa is always one of the top places that come to my mind. It's a cozy restaurant on Thompson St that is always packed with pasta lovers. The service is amazing. Every time I come with a friend and we want to share pasta, the waitress asks if we would like the pastas split before it comes out. Convenient! Complimentary appetizers and their focaccia bread are a great start to the meal. It gets better when the pastas come out. Cacio e Pepe and Carbonara are a must if you have not visited. If you've read all the rave reviews, you will understand why after the first taste of these divine dishes. Must leave room for dessert though! Make sure to get Lupa Tartufo before asking for the check. If you don't have room for dessert, order one and share. You will not regret it. The mix of hazelnut, chocolate, ice cream and a hint of cherry is the perfect way to end the meal. Always a fantastic meal at Lupa!",1,0,0,Claire Y.,"Manhattan, NY",100,14,44
5.0,12/18/2018,What an unreal experience. The food at Lupa was incredible. We got the pasta tasting menu which will cost you 55 USD per person with a side of Brussel sprouts. Each dish is half portion and we were so full by the end of the 3rd item. You also get a lemon sorbet at the end which is really flavourful and wakes you right up after a pasta heavy meal. Every dish was cooked to perfection. Lupa really upped the bench mark for a great Italian experience. Wanted to highlight the favourites.Tonnarelli Cacio e Pepe - so simple but so tasty and light. The pepper really stood out to me on this dish and wasn't overpowered by the cheese. Spaghetti alla Carbonara - such a classic dish and a staple. Really yummy and can't say anything bad about it at all. Pajata Finta - the favourite of the night. I wish I had a full serving of this pasta. I now understand what al dente should really be like. The ragu was so light and fresh. The tripe was mouth watering. This is a must get.  The Saltimbocca Agnolotti and Bucatini All'Amatriciana were both amazing as well. We had a bite each and packed the rest to go. Wanted to have the experience of it fresh before eating it as left overs the next day. Could have gone without these two but none the less it was really good. So happy that we got last minute reservations for Saturday night on a Thursday evening. Although it was busy and backed up due to volume and a big party that was going on. Had a few drinks at the bar and time flew by pretty quick.

5.0,12/8/2018,"I had came before for the Cacio E pepe which was a little salty but I  really really wanted to come back and try the pasta tasting menu. We came in for lunch and thought the tasting menu might be a bit much, so we made our own. We shared an ecarole salad and then ordered the following three pastas to share, saltimbocca agnolotti, bucatini all'amatriciana, and finished with the spaghetti carbonara. The bucatinni and carbonara were definitely the standouts and next time would definitely come back for these. I wasn't a huge fan of the agnolotti. For dessert we had the olive cake with sesame gelato and some kind of apple caramel sauce. The sweet sour of the apple sauce really balanced out the sweet of the cake. The cappuccino was also very delicious and went well with the olive oil cake. Our server was super sweet and made great recommendations. She had no issues with splitting all our entre pastas for two.

5.0,12/7/2018,"Lupa's Roman-style pasta tasting menu is out of this world. My wife and I came to New York in large part to eat delicious (Italian) food. Our culinary outings had largely been distracted by the other delicious cuisines throughout the city, and by the time we came to Lupa, we had been defeated in trying to get some decent pasta by three hour waits and fully booked restaurants.We arrived at Lupa and were relieved to find no wait and an open table, albeit a table with a one hour and fifteen time limit, which was fine, honestly. We were grateful to enjoy any delicious pasta at this point. The menu was a bit too much for my wife and I. It was a large, daunting menu rife with untranslated Italian dishes (there was a glossary on the back--not the ideal way to inform someone on a time crunch). My wife and I were fazed by all the delicious sounding options, but knowing that we were there to sample as much pasta as possible, we chose to indulge in the five pasta tasting menu. I suspect the menu design is intended to guide patrons into these options--they occupy the most real estate on the menu and are in English, not Italian. Regardless of the menu play, we were satisfied with our choice. After a round of delicious complimentary crostini, the first pasta brought out was Cacio e pepe. It was simply incredible. A buttery, cheesy pasta laced with potent and vibrant pepper, we were blown away by its craft.The second pasta, carbonara (or breakfast pasta as I jokingly call it) was similarly incredible. The guanciale (bacon) was a perfect texture and the dish had an interesting herbal taste I couldn't put a finger on.After the one-two punch of the cacio e pepe and carbonara, we got really full, really quickly. And there were three more pasta dishes left! We were drunk with extravagant tastes, and sadly our ability to independently enjoy the remaining pastas was lost in the maelstrom of our time crunch and our full stomachs. There was a vodka pasta with veal tripe, a classic red, and another red sauce pasta that I just simply couldn't eat because I was too full. Part of me feels like Lupa preyed on me by inducing me to gorge on delicious pasta, but my better nature regards the experience as a nurturing introduction to Roman style pasta.

5.0,12/4/2018,Phenomenal Italian Restaurant that my wife and I go to almost every time we are in New York.  It's small and can be hard to get into for dinner so we've only been there for lunch but are super happy we go.As with most places we eat we eat at the bar.  The bartender always does a phenomenal job pairing wine with our meals.  They have an incredible wine list.On our last trip we started with the Escarole salad - delicious.They had a special duck and sausage ragu pasta that was out of bounds.  Absolutely delicous!!!  My mouth is watering thinking about it.  The bartender paired it with a killer Italian red.  Not very fruit forward.  Absolutely perfect.I've had the Branzino several times and it never disappoints.  Served whole and cooked perfectly.  Crispy skin.  Delicate meat.  One of my favorite items on the menu.  Once again paired incredibly with an Italian white.  Perfectly matching the delicate flavor of the fish.Run to this spot for a romantic lunch or plan ahead for a killer dinner.,1,1,1,Dave K.,"Alamo, CA",51,196,390
5.0,12/3/2018,"I had a really great experience at Lupa. It's super cozy inside and it was decorated for the holidays which made it even cozier. I went with two friends and we opted for the squash as an appetizer - it was really delicious and sprinkled with pomegranates (my weakness). We went family style for mains with the spaghetti, goat cheese filled some type of pasta (I can't remember and the whole menu was in Italian lol), and squash stuffed other type of pasta (sorry this review is super non specific). All three were absolutely delicious and we washed everything down with Lambrusco followed by the Lupa Tartufo for dessert (this was SO good). The service was great as well and put the whole experience over the top. Lupa has definitely made its way onto my list of favorite Italian places in the city.",2,1,1,Devki P.,"New York, NY",329,79,34
2.0,12/2/2018,"Where to start? The support staff was great, attentive and quick. Unfortunately it did not make up for the fact that our waitress and the Sommelier had the combined personality of a wet sock. The Som was more concerned about his commission than what we were telling him our palette was. The waitress let the bus boys do her job. While the salads were perfectly adequate, our mains were subpar at best. I had the Saltimboca, a dish which could best be compared to an old leather shoe. A whole lemon and half a dish of salt was all that made it tolerable. My dining companion had the Pasta with short rib, another bland dish that one would expect to find find at an Olive Garden not an upscale Italian restaurant in NYC. Calling Lupa a ""Roman"" Italian restaurant is, quite frankly, an insult to the iconic cuisine of Rome. As a foodie who makes almost yearly treks to Rome, all I can say is that all roads may lead to Rome, but they certainly shouldn't lead you here.",1,0,0,Mika O.,"Austin, TX",215,2,0

3.0,11/28/2018,"As a big fan of Babbo, I really wanted to love Lupa, but found that this restaurant just fell short of expectations. We came as a party of three on a Saturday night with a reservation. Once our entire party had arrived, the staff seated us and brought us copies of the menu. We ordered glasses of wine first, and I asked for a recommendation based on the kinds of wine I like, though the waiter (though not a sommelier) didn't seem too knowledgeable about them. We ordered a variety of dishes, including charcuterie, beef special, bavette cacio e pepe, and scallops. Out of all, the beef special was the best dish, though nothing really was extraordinary. Ambience here is also nowhere near as nice as Babbo. For about the same price, I'd recommend going to Babbo over this place, and having a much nicer experience.",1,0,1,Su L.,"Manhattan, NY",122,267,1105

Who knew something so basic could be so delicious when executed well. Call it my Rothko of basic pasta establishments. The rest of the food was good, but nothing spectacular (i.e. beets app), but highlights end with dessert and the assortment of formaggi to close the meal was spectacular. Next time, I might even skip the bottle of vino and just go with the Chef's tasting menu to get an even wider assortment of primi!

Anytime I had a question about wine selections the bartender or waiter knew the perfect pairing for my meal. I recommend making a reservation because they're usually busy but a lot of the time they have seating at the bar. You typically don't have to wait for a table when you make a reservation but if you do it's a max of a 5-10 minute wait.

5.0,10/22/2018,"Lupa is my absolute favorite Italian restaurant in the city, and I've been to almost every similar place (Babbo, Lilia, L'Artusi, Il Buco, etc). Ambience - cozy and romantic, feels like a neighborhood spot, has bigger tables for groups as well. Very intimate and perfect for the fall/winterService - I've always had attentive, prompt, and friendly service here. The waitstaff answer all of my questions, come by to check on us regularly, and make us feel at home. Value - The portions are generous and you will definitely leave feeling full. the wine prices are AMAZING. My boyfriend and I were given a full glass and almost a full small decanter's worth of wine for the $14-17. Honestly, it was about ~2 - 2.5 full glasses. The pasta tasting menu is only $55 and has so much food you won't be able to finish it. I've been to Babbo, and think that Lupa's food is just as good for half the price. The setting is much more neighborhood-y and no frills, but I prefer it this way. Food - The first time I came, I tried the pasta tasting menu. Every single pasta was amazing and the second time I came, my boyfriend and I ordered our favorites from the menu. I got the carbonara (best carbonara in the city in my opinion) and he got the saltimbocca. The carbonara is creamy, rich, salty, fatty, and just perfect. The pasta is slightly on the thicker side and perfectly al dente. Other carbonaras I've tried in the city have either been too bland, too al dente, or too running. This is seriously the perfect meal. My boyfriend is obsessed with their saltimbocca agnolotti, which are just tiny raviolis full of veal. It pops in your mouth and is truly amazing. They put this seasoning/bread crumb on it that gives an amazing texture.",1,0,0,Michelle C.,"New York, NY",800,15,5

However, the service was terrible.We went there to celebrate my husband's birthday thinking it's one of the better Italian restaurant in the city. Firstly, we ordered a side of brussel sprouts to start with. The server did not bring it out until the main course  was served and then walked over to us saying, she didn't want to put the order in because she wanted us to see the entre first?! I understand it's a side order but I'm vegetarian and it was something I wanted to try. I would like advise but not pinning the server's oversight on us.Secondly, the server ""conveniently"" forgot to even mention the specials to us. But happily chirped the whole special menu to the table next to us. Since the place is so cramped we could hear it. I seriously lost my appetite at that point and wanted to get out of there to the point where I didn't even want to get dessert for my husband's birthday!I am not sure if it's just us who had this experience or a bad night there.

The tasting offers a 5 course selection of pastas each of which is packed with flavor. Time stops at Lupa as the restaurant caters to the experience of each customer. The service was excellent; the sommelier helped us pair a refreshing wine with our meal and each course was separated by 5-10 mins which gave us some time to digest the mountain of pasta we had just devoured.

They were there to serve food and drinks solely.  Okay, I guess.  However, all the pastas were fantastic.  Prices were good for New York, and everyone had a grand time.  Below is my review from several months ago.We frequented Lupa when it initially opened and loved both the pasta and prices.  However, it became too popular and trendy, and Lupa took on attitude.  We stopped going.Yesterday, while wandering about in the rain, we were hungry and knew Lupa was down the street.  Grabbing two stools at the bar, we shook off the rain and settled in.  The friendly bartender immediately took care of us, made suggestions, and was thoroughly engaging. Lupa felt different. There was no more ""tude,"" and Lupa felt like a neighborhood joint. People around the bar talked and laughed with us, and we felt a part of the ""gang.""The three pastas we ordered were fantastic, with the Cacio e Pepe taking first place.

I received the fava bean Chef's complement before my wine. The entree before the bread and the check before I was even finished - ""no rush of course""...I think you just rushed me. And then no offering of fresh cheese - I had to ask and was greeted with annoyance. My favorite Carbonara was also 'off' tonight. Less creamy and rich - more runny and lacking flavor.

I must say that their pasta is very al dente which I did love however it was on the saltier side for me and I felt the portions could have been bigger. We were seated in the back so the wait staff was always readily available during the night. We ordered the salumi del giorno, which did taste good but there was also only a few pieces.. Next, came our mains. We ordered the spaghetti alla carbonara and the octopus alla piastra. The chef did send out a white bean crostini compliments on the house which all tasted amazing however my main thing is the portioning.

5.0,7/17/2018,"Okay I don't even know where to start. But classically let's start with that.Walked in and was early for our reservation yet still greeted with haste and was told our table was being prepared. Took the time in between to get some bubbles at the bar and loved how the bartender just sent the check to the table instead of having to close me out at the bar. Greeted by Victoria and assisted by all the helpful service staff, we spent some time trying to decipher much of the menu as we are both not Italian, even a little. Love that they have a glossary right on the back of the menu though, I know everyone appreciates that. Trying to figure out which Nebbiolo I wanted, Nikki helped me navigate the Italian wine list while sticking within my price range. Offering different options that were below what I gave her to be around we landed on a wine together with just simple conversation. She was so knowledgeable and genuine that it made the entire Italian wine list navigation a simple one. Ended up picking a nice 1997 Barolo. After tasting the wine and loving it, both Nikki and Victoria gave run downs of the entire menu with great detail due to my endless questions and we decided we had to have pasta because that's what brought us there in the first place. Started with some olives and a beet salad, we were just ready to eat the entire menu by this point. Picking the three best pastas based on their recommendations, we loved every bite of the carbonara, bucatini, and the bavette. The bavette is such a simple pasta, cheese, and pepper dish but it was seriously a home run. We ended up splitting the three dishes and the kitchen gladly split them for us. Although so full towards the end of the entrees, Nikki insisted that we had to have the tartfuo for dessert and she was completely right. I just wanted some gelato to be refreshing and figured the tartufo would be too filling but that was not the case. Amazing gelato wrapped in a light coating of chocolate with hazelnuts and a warm chocolate hazelnut sauce on the bottom. The contrast of cold/warm and rich/refreshing was a perfect topping to my dinner. Nikki brought over a complimentary tasting of a Barolo Chinato and it's like she read my mind about wanting a port. Perfectly predicting what I wanted without having to even ask. Although not a port it was still done in a fortified process and perfectly complimented my Barolo I had with the entire meal. Usually I don't have time to write these things, nor believe that what I put up on the site really even means something but Lupa seriously blew me away. Top notch service, elegant close Italian style seating, and wonderful food from apps to dessert. If you haven't been there yet AND you actually LIVE in NYC.... please do yourself a favor and go. Not to knock anyone else but ideally between Sunday and Tuesday because Nikki's the somm those days and she can share some of her knowledge and genuine kindness with you. WE WILL BE BACK! Ps.

5.0,7/17/2018,"In the southeastern corner of The Village, narrow southward-bound streets trickle into SoHo, donning names like Wooster, Mercer, and Sullivan. The streets are lined with trees that gradiate in color from bright olive to the gold found within the innermost part of a trumpet. Thompson Street, especially after a light summer rain--the kind where you keep your umbrella at bay because the sight and sound of raindrops patting against Manhattan's self-prescribed umbrella of trees keeps your heart light and dry in and of itself--feels welcoming and pulled from a storybook, lit with iridescence from the small handful of infamously exclusive restaurants that call Thompson Street home.One of these restaurants is Lupa. Named after a ""she-wolf,"" Lupa is aggressive but in the best way. There's a glossary on the menu that takes up about 70% of the backside; if that's not aggressive than I don't know what is, and I completely respect it.The dishes were set on the table with the same gusto as an angsty teenager serving his younger brother dinner because their mom will be home late. In other words, the plates were essentially tossed onto our table, which, if anything, was wildly entertaining. We ordered the Spaghetti con Pomodoro because so many Yelp reviewers hyped it out of this world. The perfectly al dente spaghetti was primo for sure, and paired well with a spicy pomodoro (tomato) sauce.The Saltimbocca is a sight to be seen. When our waiter fielded the question ""Does the dish come with anything other than the veal?"" he looked at us with a face that read, ""Of course it doesn't come with any sides, it's a frisbee of schnitzely veal and its presence demands a plate vacant with nothing but the veal."" To our surprise, there was an assortment of sautéed greens hiding under the perfectly circular, ultra-thin piece of veal.Lupa has a mystery punch concoction on the cocktail menu that requires an inquiry to the waiter, and even if you find out what it is, they change it whenever they're feeling inspired. Instead of going with the mystery punch or a cocktail, I zeroed in on the leather-bound tome of a wine list; the leather on that thing felt nicer than any leather thing I've owned. Suddenly, a sommelier appeared to bait us into ordering a one thousand dollar bottle of wine. When I told my mom about my Lupa experience, she asked me to repeat ""sommelier"" four times because she liked the sound of it. The sommelier schtick is a cool one, especially if your knowledge of wine extends no further than understanding it must be swirled, sniffed, and sipped to provide a facade that says ""I know what I'm doing."" Our sommelier was friendly but didn't hide her disappointment when we selected a bottle of wine under $500.For dessert, I'll tell you (along with 1,300 other reviewers) to go for the tartufo. In essence, it's a giant, cold Ferrero Rocher truffle and it is GOOD. It's so good, in fact, that you won't notice the toddler seated next to you flinging noodles at you the entire dinner until you get home and find the noodles in your bag.Important note for summer visits: the bathroom is a mere 6' wide and has its own window AC unit; in other words, it's an ice box A.K.A. a lifesaver for the days when Manhattan sells its soul to Dante's Inferno.The Lupa experience is a smooth one, from the quick service and great food to the warm ambiance and wine-y wine, and all the while Thompson Street waits just beyond the glass to carry on the night.",13,8,12,Laura P.,"New York, NY",905,414,255

I rarely eat pasta that is not cooked at home, and I was pleasantly surprised at the blend of flavors on top of perfectly cooked Al Dente pasta.I ordered their daily special, a Rigatoni Pasta combined with mushrooms, black garlic, and butter. At first bite, I knew coming out to eat Italian was worth it! The Rigatoni was cooked to perfection. The mushrooms, butter, and black garlic created a full-bodied coating for the pasta. Additionally, there was a slight spice factor that really helped tie together all the flavors.The waiters here were very attentive, consistently filling our waters and letting us know how long we should expect to wait for our meal.

The tripe and sweetbread added the additional fatty and savory tone to the dish, and it was absolute perfection when mixed with the whipped ricotta on the bottom.

My wife and I sat by the open door on a lovely summer evening and while it was a bit cramped, dinner felt relaxed and there was no problem being able to converse over the crowd.  While all the food we had was good and I had no complaints whatsoever, there was simply no ""wow"" factor in any of the dishes.  The Cacio e Pepe had a nice peppery kick but it tasted very buttery as opposed to the traditional boiling water, cheese and pasta that becomes a divine, minimalist combination. The Bolognese pasta was solid but did not stand out and it tasted a bit too sweet for my liking.  The skirt steak was cooked perfectly but I was not enamored with the herb and mushroom seasoning. We had a street view and all I could think of was wishing I was across the street at Carbone which is my absolute favorite Italian restaurant. The flickering sign of Carbone teased us all night.

It's such a simple dish, but the pasta chefs perfectly prepare it. Just enough sauce with the perfect amount of salt.

2.0,5/31/2018,"The pasta tasting menu was really subpar, but the most distasteful part of the experience was the seeming discrimination my waitress showed towards me and my boyfriend - I am not sure if it was a race issue or something else. This was evidenced by the clear difference in how she was treating the table next to us vs. our table. I am passionate about pasta and enjoy understanding all my options before I order. Not only did she seem annoyed and curt by my questions regarding the dishes, I noticed that she recited the special pastas of the day to the table next to us, but did not tell them to us. I didn't make a big deal as the menu had plenty of options. I finally ordered the pasta tasting menu for $55 a person, which was really mediocre - nothing out of the world by any means. Again -  Not only did she not once come and ask me how my pasta was within the 5 courses, she did not offer me cheese on any of my pasta dishes, despite clearly offering cheese to the other table right next to us.The cherry on top was the end - after the blatant disrespect she showed, I guessed she was not expecting a very good tip. I was wrong - she actually brought a credit card machine over and asked me to input the tip amount(starting at 20%) right in front of her. I pushed ""no tip,"" as I thought this was the most unprofessional, presumptuous thing I've ever seen.

We had a complimentary pureed bean on crostini, which was tasty and the bread (two services). Very tasty. The beets were delicious, but not unlike other beet dishes we have had before. We knew we would be having the carbonara in advance and were not disappointed. We both agreed that it's the best we have had outside of Rome. The meat was crispy and fantastic and the sauce authentic. Also, the portion is fairly large, so we will probably share one next time and try another of the pastas. A standout would be the brussel spouts. They were perfect and unlike and spouts we have had before. Really, really good.

But I feel like this was heavily offset by the fact that their was a group booking of 20-something near us that I don't think is a regular situation. Where we were sitting was kind of like eating in economy on a long haul flight - surely doable but you need to manage your space and what you are doing with each course!We started with a charcuterie board which had some fantastic meats in the selection, some that are made onsite. There was one that was like a pickled cornbeef that was out of this world. Very very good. Cheese pairing excellent. We had a cocktail and no one had a complaint. I had the Negroni and it was right on point. The key to a good cocktail is for you to taste the alcohol with harsh aftertaste and it was spot on.Main course I went for the recommended Bucatini Amatriciana, which was a solid 4. I think the pasta went between slightly undercooked to al-dente. Was definitely borderline. Weird, no Parmesan, no garnish, nothing. Colleague had the Veal Ragu and the pepper and cheese based pasta (cant remember the name). One colleague didnt finish but enjoyed it, the other finished and gave it a 4.We finished with the Lupa Tartufo and the butterscotch & goat cheese panna cotta, but neither hit the mark or were finished. The Panna Cotta is recommended, but we had some hesitation and were proved right, the goats cheese was so overpowering! Wine was good without being a knock out.

2.0,1/30/2018,"I so very much wanted to like this place. I don't know if it's gone downhill recently or what... I had heard amazing things about the cacio e pepe, carbonara, and amatriciana dishes in the past (all three of which we ordered), but all three were beyond disappointing--the lack of flavor was almost laughable. I mean, and I'm still shocked as I type this, but they were just NOT good AT all-- a few bites were taken of each, and then soon abandoned! And get this, we had only ordered the amatriciana AFTER trying the initial cacio & carbonara orders; they were terrible, but we gave the benefit of the doubt (things happen!) and pretended to ""just want to try the amatriciana too,"" which ended up to be equally disappointing. The cacio e pepe was bland, and then (possibly even worse) the only flavor offered by the amatriciana and carbonara was the pervasive taste of old, almost freezer-burned guanciale--which was supposed to be the ""hero"" of both dishes. Good lord, could that not have been further from the truth; you know it's bad when your tomato-based and egg/cream-based pasta dishes both have the same haunting, vaguely meaty aftertaste. In fact, the only halfway decent part about the three dishes was the pasta itself--it was cooked al dente, with a good texture and no offensive flavor of its own (the sauces, however, were another matter). We also ordered 3 sides, or ""contorni"": the mushrooms (unremarkable to the point I almost forgot they were on the table), broccoli rabe (actually revolting to the taste--it was left untouched), and pomegranate brussels (yummy only due to the sugar of the pomegranate).  The best thing on the table was my sister's orecchiette w/ duck ragout (mouthwatering in comparison to the rest of the orders); it was the special of the night, which leads me to believe it was good because the ingredients were presumably fresh (see note about the upsetting guanciale). THAT IS SAD THOUGH--1 SUCCESSFUL ENTREE OUT OF 4?! For a such a reputable restaurant with famous roots, this was shocking.

The crostini was delicious as the crab was perfect and the bread was fresh. The prosciutto was also delicious. Great start to the meal.I then had the Cacio y Pepe which is one of my favorite dishes, alongside a glass of Pinot Nior. Upon the first bite, I was overwhelmed with the taste of black pepper. Thinking it was a fluke, I had a few more bites and it was the same overwhelming black pepper taste. I was in a rush and didn't have time to send it back, so I just ate what I could. The wine however, was excellent.I'm really torn writing this review as it's clear that the Cacio Y Pepe dish was accidentally saturated with black pepper while cooking it.

To peppery for me but I'd definitely love to come back one day and try the carbonara which looks good from pictures. It was also perfectly al dente btw, my hubs loved it and called it his favorite meal. I can't even remember the first thing he ate but it was in a meat sauce I think.

5.0,1/16/2018,Right before New Year's Eve - maybe 3 days before - I finally made it in to Lupa.  I have been dying for their gnocchi for like a decade.  But I was with friends so we did gnocchi AND the tortellli stuffed with pork belly.  While the gnocchi was indeed a pillow from heaven - the tortellini was one of the most amazing pasta dishes I have had in my lifetime.  Then I had monkfish - which the bartender recommended with passion.  Wasn't appealing but I allowed them to order it for me.  They described it as if I was eating lobster served as a fish.  Spot on!!!!!!  It was out of this world.  So happy I went - what a wonderful experience.,0,0,0,Rob M.,"Huntington, NY",318,22,20

If that scent can't soothe a frazzled soul, I don't know what will.We all opted to do the pasta tasting menu, two of us added the wine pairing and were very pleased with their decision.Unlike most tasting menus, this one is super accessible for those who may not be the most adventurous eaters. Each pasta is delicious and slowly brings in some of the more unusual ingredients slowly as you go along. And they don't skimp on the guanciale. Which brings me to a new personal policy, guanciale on everything.Every pasta tasted freshly homemade and special. I loved everything about them.My only regret was not pacing myself. I started strong finishing the early dishes in their entirety and then had 3 or 4 more dishes to enjoy. Such problems to have!The pasta tasting also comes with a sorbet for dessert. It was blood orange flavored and just so delightful. During the summer months, I would love to float on a cloud of it,To add to the beautiful experience, the music was top notch.

Part of the Mario Batali restaurant showcase, Lupa is smaller, more intimate and homier than some of Batali's flashier places. This cozy atmosphere lends itself well to enjoying handmade pastas, cheeses and of course, plenty of wine shoulder to shoulder with your dining companions. Definitely start with the buratta, prosciutto, and beet salad followed by literally anything on the pasta list. I asked our server his pasta recommendation and he told me to ""close my eyes and point"". I did so and was not disappointed. I would not miss the truffle angliotto- a ravioli type pasta pouch bursting with truffled goat cheese and other spices. If you have room for dessert I'd recommend the hazelnut cake. It's a nice and light way to end a carbtastic meal. Perfect for a first date or a group outing, Lupa is the appropriate place for most gluten friendly occasions.

Finally, at the end of our meal, we ordered a liqueur and waited and waited. When it didn't come, we called her back to remind her and her reaction was a vague ""oh, I didn't realize you wanted it""!

I was extremely disappointed. No cracked egg or egg yolk on top? I lived in Rome and judging by my experience of eating carbonara there, I know the consistency of the sauce should have been thicker. This sauce was basically the same as cacio e pepe. The Carbonara at Olio e Piu gets five stars in my book, and the Carbonara at Lupa gets two stars.  I wouldn't even dare comparing it to the pasta at L'Artusi because L'Artusi absolutely triumphs. THE WINE:I did not like the first wine we ordered (the 11610) because it had a lot of ""skin contact"" and frankly was acidic and tasted cheap.

2.0,9/17/2017,"Save yourself the calories and don't order a tasting menu.My wife and I came with high expectations, considering this is Batali-Bastianich collaboration and an interesting concept. Unfortunately, it just did not live up to the hype. We LOVE tasting menus and ordering the Roman tasting was a no-brainer. I got the wine pairing. However, rather than enjoying the meal, we were so overstuffed we could not enjoy the dessert. This was the all-you-can-eat version of a tasting menu (see below). We were forced to buy two of the same tasting menu rather than one Roman and one Pasta, but the portions could have easily been split. Also, the staff did not take time to explain the dishes. At one point even our waitress laughed because she watched the server throw our plates down and tell us the name of the dish as he was walking away.The first course was a fried rice-cheese log with classic tomato sauce. It tasted like a high-end mozzarella stick. It was paired with a white wine that was too light to stand up to either the sauce or the cheese. The second course was primi-sized portion of pasta in a cream sauce with pork belly. These two dishes were more than fatty enough to fill me up. Next was a pasta in a creamy tomato sauce. This was probably my favorite dish, but it was no better than its counterpart from any other Italian restaurant. Next was oxtail with a tomato sauce and celery. Again, we LOVE oxtail when it is done right. This was fine but again no frills. It was hard to dissect off of the bone. The wine pairing was poorly matched. Next, the cheese plate was 3 large portions of sharp cheeses, and we each got the same plate. This should have had smaller portions or been shared so that we could enjoy the flavors rather than force down a quarter pound of cheese. The wine was from the same vineyard as one of the earlier whites. To me, this betrayed a lack of creativity, budget considerations, a surplus of the wines from the winery, or all of the above. Finally the ""sorbet"" dessert was chocolate gelato encrusted with hazelnut and sitting on a lake of chocolate sauce. To a chocoholic such myself, this should have been a highlight. Unfortunately, the flavors were too disconnected, and it just was not good enough to jam into my bloated stomach. The pairing, a very interesting bitter citrusy liqueur, came out so late I thought there may not be a pairing for the dessert course.

1.0,9/12/2017,"We've been several times and this was by far the worst experience there, to the point where I doubt we will ever go back.  The service pretty much ruined the meal.To start, the first batch of focaccia we got had to be from the week before.  It was a hard brick.We ordered the wine pairing with our pasta and for 3 of the 6 dishes the wine had to be asked for (the maitre d, the waiter, the busboy) - the Sommelier should be fired.  Not only did he NOT come over and tell us about the wines, he decided the best thing to do would just avoid us the rest of the night.  When my wife flagged him to ask about the final wine, he couldn't even figure out what words to say.  Utterly incompetent.  Our waiter knew how pissed we were and didn't try and alleviate any of the tension.  For the amount of $ we pay/paid for dinner - there are better cheaper places that aren't as snooty and uncaring.",0,0,0,Al D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0
3.0,9/6/2017,"Lupa is good, but for me it is not as over-the-top spectacular as some reviews make it out to be.  To begin with, while Negroni on tap is an interesting novelty, I don't know that it results in a superior or even standard Negroni - and, I sort of resent paying $13 for a cocktail that is poured from a tap without the bartender having to do much at all.  As for the food, as is often the case, the appetizer was better - buffalo mozzarella with marinated eggplant was nicely balanced and tasty.  The pasta dishes were good but not great - maybe not as al dente as I'd like, and too salty.  Very salty.  Ambience is nice, but not as if I have been transported to Rome.  If the prices were 30% lower this would be a solid neighborhood Roman style Italian place.",1,0,0,Paul L.,"New York, NY",31,9,6

5.0,9/6/2017,"My wife and I came here for the pastas and they didn't disappoint.  We thought about getting the pasta tasting menu but there were some pastas on the regular menu that we really wanted to try so the two of us ended up ordering 3 pasta dishes:Oxtail Ravioli: This dish has a short prep time (as informed by our waitress), so we used this as app. Loved the chewy texture of the ravioli, the flavor of the salsa verde and the oxtail filling. 5/5Linguini with shrimp, mussels & fennel:  Another perfect pasta dish. The fennel was just subtle enough to make its presence felt but didn't overwhelm. 5/5Mezze Rigatoni with pork shank: This was one of the specials for the night.  The tomato based sauce was pretty standard but the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and there were enough chunks of pork shank to make a meat-lover like myself very happy. 4/5Olive oil cake with sesame gelato and peach: The cake was delicious and though I didn't get much sesame flavor in the gelato, this was a really good ending to a great meal. 4/5We didn't have reservations but you can just walk in if there is space in the communal table or the bar.  We sat at the communal table and were fine with it.  I liked the relaxed, casual atmosphere and enjoyed the music they were playing (mostly rock like led zep, cage the elephant etc.).  Their wine list is extensive so if you are gonna get a bottle, I would recommend talking to their very knowledgeable sommelier.",1,0,0,Wahed K.,"Astoria, NY",680,778,1618

I do not even know where to start with this review... if you need ANY convincing to go here for any sort of reason (birthday, anniversary, just because), please take me word for it and just go! Make that reservation, PRONTO. You will not regret it. Then come back to read my review on what I ordered and how amazingly delicious it was. Lupa sure knows how to cook pasta. The noodles were cooked to perfection and the sauces for each of the pastas were not just accompanying the noodles but was a part of them. They were one magical duo. Each bite was beyond heavenly and as full as I was, I wanted more! My boyfriend and I came here for dinner and left amazed. We skipped over the appetizers as we wanted to try more entrees and not waste any stomach space for them. (I do not doubt how delicious all the appetizers are). For pastas, we went with the mushroom ravioli, the cacio e pepe and the gnoochi. OH MY GOODNESS. I order cacio e pepe at every Italian establishment I go to as this pasta dish is so simple yet so delicious if executed properly. This is hands down the best cacio e pepe pasta dish I have had. HANDS DOWN. I can eat that everyday of my life and be perfectly fine. They kindly split the pastas for us so that we would each have our own half. I had to stop myself from stealing my boyfriend's half of the cacio e pepe. He insists that the mushroom ravioli was better but I stand by my cacio e pepe. However, the mushroom ravioli was also superb and so flavorful. The mushroom flavor really stood out and danced around my mouth. The gnoochi were little fluffy bites of clouds that just melted. I will most definitely be back to try the rest of the pastas. For entrees, we went with the lamb (humuna humuna humuna) and the scallops. Best lamb dish Ive ever had. Perfectly seasoned and cooked and so beyond flavorful. It only came with a crispy potato pancake but that was all it needed. The scallops were also so so good. I sound like a broken record at this point but I have to stress how delicious this dinner was. We were beyond stuffed so skipped on dessert.

After arriving on time at 9pm and waiting 25 minutes we were finally seated without so much as a ""sorry about the wait."" It seemed like the type of place where the hosts really didn't care if you stayed or went, in fact it probably would have made their job easier so maybe they were hoping we would leave. When we finally sat down our waiter was fantastic. He was extremely attentive and he even split the portions for us up in the kitchen before serving them. We got the carbonara, short rib ragu & and the amatriciana. The ragu was unbelievable but the rest of the dishes were underwhelming. My onions and pancetta were black thats how burnt they were, and the carbonara was bland. It wasn't the worst food I've ever had, but shouldn't be on any type of best pasta list.

4.0,6/14/2017,"Just got back from Italy and realized I have never had a clue what real Italian food is all about until I tasted it in the motherland.  I have been going to Lupa on and off for many years now (10 years or so) and in my mind, without anyone saying so, I always categorized Lupa as the restaurant that was supposed to best mimic the cooking of the motherland.  I went recently to see what I would think after having my taste buds reeducated.Overall, very, very good. Food quality is consistent after having logged at least 10 visits.  All the dishes were clean and no flavor was overly dominant.  We order the Asparagus Cacio e Uova, RIcotta Gnocchi with Sausage & Fennel, Arctic Char, and Skirt Steak.  Out of what we ordered, felt the Gnocchi was the winner.  Really great texture to the gnoochi and had a mild and subtle flavor to the sauce.  Asparagus was also quite subtle in flavor where it was never too cheesy or overly spiced.  Arctic Char was nice but basic in flavor as was the Skirt Steak (a little overcooked for my taste).  Service was excellent as always.  Usually if the food sucks, I feel it an hour or later and I definitely had that light and delicate feeling going so props for that.Although not fair to compare but I'll say it anyways, it does not come close to food from Italy. I think they try to be like Italy in the good ingredient, subtle flavor, easy on the sauce kinda of approach and certainly they deserved an ""A"" for effort.  I would say you have to be in the mood for clean food instead of in your face flavor.  I think if I were in the mood for stronger tastes, then I might give them a lower review. I have my ""food moods"" and try to match the restaurant to that.  So if your in the mood for clean Italian and looking for a low key evening,  check out Lupa.",0,0,0,Daniel Y.,"New York, NY",0,18,0

Years ago when you ate here you could taste the skill and artistry of the chefs but that certainly wasn't present for my dinner.

4.0,5/10/2017,"Marinated OlivesNice variety, well worth getting to snack on with a salumi board or even to just have the oil to dip the focaccia in.Crab CrostiniA generous amount of crab flaked onto toasty bread. Very fresh tasting (I'm usually not a big crab fan). I do wish that maybe it had a squirt of fresh lemon to add some brightness. An order is 2 pieces so a little awkward to share between an odd number of people if you're not dining with people that your close enough with to just take a bite or two and pass along.Asparagus Cacio e UovaAsparagus is in season now so worth getting. Not overly thick sauce with the cheese, but enough to add good flavor to the dish. The chili slices add some heat that can potentially overpower the flavor of the asparagus but luckily they don't go crazy with the chilis.Salumi BoardI'm not really a huge cured meats expert and honestly I don't really remember all five meats we got but it was all excellent. The prosciutto was good, nice delicate flavor and not too fatty. Two other standouts were a head cheese that had a good amount of nutmeg ground on top. As my friend said, it basically tasted like Christmas. I would have preferred a little less nutmeg though, I thought the amount on top overpowered it. My favorite was the Lingua though. Sliced thin and marinated in a sweet, tangy liquid with some onion slices in it. Spinach Salad with Apples and SpeckNot the best salad I've ever had but very tasty. Apples were sliced super thin which I appreciate because the texture mixed well with the spinach. A lot of times when I've gotten apples in salad they're usually sliced too thick for my tastes and instead of harmonizing with the greens they can overpower the more delicate vegetables. Speck is rendered out till super crispy and drizzled on at the table side, preventing everything from wilting too quickly or having the oil start to cool off and re-congeal.PastasTo start, I thought all the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. Nice teeth bite with just a little bit of stick. And none of the sauces were overly cheesy, thick, or rich. I personally think those are the most important aspects of an excellent pasta dish, especially ones that have very ingredients.Spaghetti alla CarbonaraUsually a good standby pasta for me because it's easy to make a good carbonara (I've yet to have a really bad carbonara eating out). I did like that the sauce wasn't overly thick or rich.Bavette Cacio e PepeReally good, not overly peppery or cheesy. I do wish that maybe there was a twist or two of freshly ground coarse pepper on top to give the dish a little more bite that you lose when you cook black pepper. But since the dish wasn't overly cheesy the cooked pepper wasn't overpowered.Ricotta GnocchiAs much as I liked the ricotta gnocchi I had at Union Square Café, I felt that one was a little too soft and light. The gnocchi at USC was almost pillow soft. I much preferred the gnocchi at Lupa because there was still some bite and texture to it.Pork Belly Tortelloni with Ramps and Smoked RicottaLoved the flavor and texture of the tortelloni. The only real complaint I had about the dish was that I felt the smoked ricotta overpowered the entire dish. I would have preferred either less of the smoked ricotta or if less of the smoked ricotta was used. The smoke flavor was nice but I couldn't even taste the ramps and the tortelloni was almost overpowered itself.Oxtail RavioliNice, thick sauce that held on well to the ravioli. The oxtail was obviously cooked really well, no toughness or stringiness at all.Orecchiette with Sausage and Broccoli RabeBest for last, personally my favorite of the pasta dishes we had (maybe favorite dish of the entire meal). The orecchiette was cooked perfectly for my liking, and because of the size of the pasta had an excellent mouth feel. There was also a very nice, delicate sweetness that I assume is coming from the sausage. The sausage was also flavored nicely with a hint of I think white pepper. Broccoli rabe added a slight bit of bitterness to balance out the sweetness of the sausage and the texture of the pasta. I would definitely get it again since it was such a standout for me and wouldn't mind getting a whole plate for myself next time I go back.Lemon SorbettoAmazing lemon flavor, really concentrated. The best way I could put it is the very bottom of those Luigi Ice cups except not as sweet or tart, just a very pleasant, delicate lemon flavor. Also, if I ever had an ice based dessert that I could call creamy, this would be it. Great was to end a heavy pasta meal.Butterscotch Panna CottaA denser panna cotta than I'm use to but still excellent. Not an overly sweet butterscotch flavor. I didn't personally like the pomegranate seeds sprinkled on top, but that's mainly because I'm not a big fan of pomegranate seeds and they were easy enough for me to pick off. If it were me I would rather do a pomegranate reduction sauce and just slightly drizzle that over.",2,0,0,Stanley C.,"Ridgewood, Queens, NY",16,21,0
3.0,5/10/2017,"**3.5**Made reservations and came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The weather was great and it was early so it was pretty empty - I requested to be moved closer to the window area but they said it was all reserved for later.They have an extensive menu for wine and I was super interested in their five-course tasting menu featuring paired pastas and wines, but I wasn't hungry enough for that haha (NOTE: the fixed menu course is mandatory for parties of 8 and over)Service was great and they were constantly filling our water glasses and wine glasses. We got the:Crab Crostinis: Generous with the crab which was great and the bread underneath was nice and crispy but completely soaked in olive oil.Casarecce with Short Rib Ragu: Nice hearty sauce with tender bits of short rib. Great slow-cooked flavor.Carbonara: The star of the meal - The spaghetti was perfectly al dente and the bacon bits were thick, crispy, and almost had a pillowy texture when you bite into it. Definitely get it!Overall, it's not that anything was necessarily horrible but rather that nothing truly stood out to me as being spectacular and it's pretty pricey.

4.0,5/3/2017,"I went to Lupa on a spontaneous date night with my husband and was very happy with our choice. The ambience is pretty low-key and the restaurant is fairly casual. If you are looking for something upscale to impress then this is probably not the right restaurant. It can get pretty cramped at the front of the restaurant especially when the bar is packed and waiters are trying to weave around the tables with food and drinks. Most people waiting to be seated spill out onto the streets because there simply isn't enough space to wait. However, if you're looking for friendly, knowledgeable waiters and great food then this is the right place. I explained to the bartender I was looking for a light, not sweet red wine and she allowed me to sample a few before I found one I loved. For my entrée, I had Bavette Cacio e Pepe which was fresh and delicious. It was probably high in calories as the sauce was all butter and cheese, but the splurge was totally worth it. It was a little bland so I used some crushed red peppers to spice it up. It complemented really well with my wine selection. Overall, Lupa is a great spot if you are looking for fresh, authentic Italian food. However, it is fairly casual. Prices are also mid-range depending on your wine selection preferences.

2.0,2/19/2017,"My boyfriend and I were very happy to eat at a roman restaurant. I was born and raised in Bologna (Italy) and I truly miss real authentic Italian food here in the US. We made a reservation for 10pm on a Saturday night and although it was very late (at least for us) we did not care as wanted to eat good Italian. Couple of remarks: 1) My boyfriend wanted to order the 'Roman pasta tasting menu' and I wanted to order a la carte, however they said that was not an option. Here is the inconsistency and lack of customer service.... Not only does the tasting menu not specify a minimum for two, but also a single-person table (or at the bar) can order the tasting menu alone (we asked!). 2) We order 'Spaghetti alla Carbonara', a delicious roman pasta dish and we were extremely disappointed. The egg was overcooked (which is the biggest NO-NO for La Carbonara) and the guanciale (the key ingredient of this dish) was not existing, but they used instead bacon.3) We also ordered the 'Whole roasted baby chicken'. It comes with a fried egg on top, so I asked if they could substitute it with some roasted potatoes and the waiter said no. She literally said ""we can serve the chicken with no egg, but we won't give you any extra food to replace it"".Even the skirt steak and the desserts were below average.Being Italian I generally care about the quality of the food more than the service, but this time I was extremely disappointed by the mediocrity of the food (not authentic Italian food) as well as the poor customer service. It's overrated and too pricy for the actual quality of the food. If you are looking for good Italian food in Manhattan, I would definitely not go to Lupa.",0,0,0,Lara P.,"Menlo Park, CA",1,9,0
4.0,2/18/2017,"A friend and I came here for dinner sort of by accident on a Friday after work. It ended up being a happy accident, fortunately. We had intended to get cookie dough and the now legendary Do, but the line was about a block long, so we quickly gave up on that dream and decided to change course. Hence dinner at Lupa.Since we didn't have a reservation, our choices were either to sit at a table and get ousted within an hour and a half or sit at the bar for as long as we wanted. Obviously, we sat at the bar. To start, we ordered cocktails. I can't remember the name of mine, but it was essentially their take on a French 75 and was quite delightful.For food, we shared the roasted cauliflower with pine nuts and currants to start, which was good although I didn't expect it to be cold. It was a hefty portion--probably too much for an appetizer, really. For mains, I got the pork belly tortelloni with chestnuts & butternut squash, which was hearty and delicious. My friend got an orecchiette special and said it was great. We drank more after dinner (too much), and ordered the tartufo for dessert later on, which was basically a cold delicious hazelnut bomb.The atmosphere was warm and cozy and the volume was good for talking and being heard.

5.0,2/16/2017,"My husband and I came here for Valentine's Day dinner. A few days before Feb 14, we got not one but two phone calls from the hostess inquiring if we wanted to see the prix fixe menu they were offering for Valentine's Day. Initially I thought she would pressure us to order the prix fixe but she happily sent us both the prix fixe menu and their regular menu, which we appreciated cuz we ended up ordering the regular menu when we got to Lupa.Ambience: romantic, relatively narrow restaurant, tables are close together (I had to hold my purse in my lap the whole night) and I definitely got brushed by the wait staff whenever they walked by, dimly lit (candles/brick walls), two seating ""areas"" - one in front with the bar and one in the back behind the bathrooms Food: We  got the prosciutto to start and that was quite good. Nothing astounding - definitely can get from Eataly but husband enjoyed it thoroughly! Husband ordered the cavatelli and he loved it. Decent portion! I had a bite and it was great! I went for the daily special which was the crispy duck and oh my goodness, that was AMAZING. I pride myself as an amateur ""roast duck connoisseur"" and my oh my, Batali has made this Chinese mama proud. The duck was juicy, perfectly crispy on the outside with the right amount of fat and seasoning. I'm salivating just reminiscing of it! If you go on a Tuesday, order the duck. Or else, I will. Dessert was the apple tart with cinnamon ice cream. I liked the ice cream- had just the right amount of cinnamon but husband said it tasted like mint to him! I didn't care for the apple tart as it 1) was too cakey 2) the apples were soggy and made the pastry into a flour blob crust Service: for Valentine's Day, we honestly did not expect great service... ESP when each table has a 2 hour limit. However, our server was great and attentive. He suggested a nice bottle of wine and came often to top our glasses up.

3.0,12/15/2016,"Had a nice hearty meal here on a chilly night.  Cozy room, not too loud and friendly staff.  For app's we ordered cauliflower, Matsukake mushrooms and the spiedini.  The cauliflower is served slightly chilled with pine nuts and a light but flavorful dressing, however it could have used a hit of salt or perhaps some acid.  The mushrooms were nice and meaty and the goat cheese was sparse but delicious.  The spiedini was a couple cubes of cheese with a tempura like batter.  Maybe the oil was not hot enough when it went in because it was a little too greasy and the cheese was not soft/melted - this was our least favorite.  Redemption came when the bucatini all' amatriciana hit the table - perfectly cooked with the right amount of spice.  The ricotta gnocchi was good, but I truly feel there was something lost in translation between myself and the waiter.  It was described as a ricotta dumpling stuffed with sausage and fennel, which unfortunately, I could not detect visually, and though I think I tasted something of those flavors it may have been simply the power of suggestion.  That said the gnocchi itself was well executed - light and soft.  For dessert we had the apple tart with cinnamon gelato.  Lovely tart but the cinnamon gelato was the star.",0,0,0,J C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,16,0

This tasting menu includes: Tonnarelli Cacio e Pepe, Saltimbocca Ravioli, Bucatini All'Amatriciana, Spaghetti Alla Carbonara, Pajata Finta, and Sorbetto. All of our pasta dishes were al dente and full of flavor. My favorite ones were Tonnarelli Cacio e Pepe and the Pajata Finta.

If pasta is what you want then do not by any means forget to order the gnocchi. It's absolutely amazing. The fluffy pillows of goodness were to die for. Honestly one of the best gnocchis ive had.

I'd like to say Mario Batali does it again but this was actually my first time eating at one of his restaurants. It did not disappoint! Everything, from start to finish, was delicious. We ordered several appetizers to share: escarole salad was probably one of the top 3 salads I've ever had, burrata toast - enough said, prosciutto was so fresh and flavorful and not stale-tasting like cured meat can sometimes be, and the tuna carpaccio was...interesting (not a fan of the texture but taste was ). We also ordered cacio e pepe to split because we all wanted to try it. I've made it my undeclared personal mission to find the best cacio e pepe in the city and this could be a strong contender. V v sad that I could only have a few bites. I had the short rib ragu pasta as my entree and HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend. The short ribs were hardly fatty at all and the pasta was so fresh and cooked perfectly. I also tried a bite of my friend's ricotta gnocchi which was also amazing and will be what I order the next time I go. Next stop- Babbo!",1,1,1,Kristina P.,"New York, NY",250,150,39
4.0,10/30/2016,"Lupa was awesome! Would definitely return. We sat at the bar as we didn't have a reservation and that was the first option available. I never mind sitting at the bar either. Lupa's bar is gorgeous with three brick arches which the liquor bottles sit inside. Wish I had a picture of it. The bartender was extremely knowledgeable, but our drinks and food definitely took a pretty long time to get to us which was disappointing. But it was a busy Saturday night. For food we had the small meat board and olives to start. To be honest, I wouldn't get it again. We asked to swap out the lingua and terrine because I don't eat either and they said we weren't allowed. Fine, we ordered it anyway. It's basically just the meats. It doesn't come with any accoutrements like mustards, bread, or anything. So meh. Also nobody told us the names/kinds of the meats as they put the board down or as we ate. Also disappointing. The olives were reallllllly good. I could've eaten two more bowls.  Next we had the gnocchi with sausage and fennel and the cappeloni nero with lobster. The gnocchi was awesome but there were no discernible pieces of sausage- I guess it was ground into the sauce? Kind of odd and disappointing when it was described on the menu as gnocchi with sausage. The cappeloni nero was different... the pasta itself was reallllly rubbery. So much so that I assumed that had to be the actual texture of it, not a mistake. My boyfriend thought it might have been undercooked but I didn't agree- I think that was their purposeful texture. I wouldn't order again, but that could've just been our preference as we aren't used to pasta like that. Then we had the heritage pork which was awesome. Definitely worth ordering. The flavors were amazing- I don't know what the spices were on the pork but really awesome. There were also garbanzo beans and cabbage on the plate. All very good. We also sides of broccoli rabe and fingerling potatoes. Both good but nothing inventive. Probably wouldn't order again either. Lastly we had the hazelnut tartufo which was sooo good and the butterscotch panna cotta which was also very good. We tried three of the house cocktails and all were extremely good and worth ordering. The gin/lemon jam cocktail was my favorite (marmletto or something like that). We also tried the red berry vodka cocktail which tasted like fruit punch but of course was actually made with fresh ingredients. And the bourbon cocktail which was the first on the list. All very good! So all in all, sort of a mixed review. I would definitely return. The staff was all extremely friendly and knowledgeable- kudos to them. Ps- update your menu online, lupa!!!!

So hard to explain, you'll just have to go try it!Carbonara was just average for me. A bit too peppery, reminds me more of cacio pepe with guanciale. They use the same guanciale as the bucatini so I just made sure I finished that and unfortunately didn't finish the pasta. As for appetizers, we ordered the spinach salad, it was good (probably an above average spinach salad) with the crispy speck and apples but nothing to die for.

4.0,9/13/2016,"Lupa is a restaurant I've been wanting to go to for a while. Ive ate at Mario Batalis restaurants before. Im always sure of one thing, Its going to be great food.  At this restaurant I was hoping for a more romantic vibe and we got that in the back dining room. It was quiet and had great music playing. The walls had Warm colors and a huge map as an accent wall. It was Really cool. It was romantic and the ambience was on point. The front was a little more like Otto, Batalis other restaurant!  It was an open pizza kitchen and a little loud. All in all, the restaurant is beautiful. There was so much food to choose from, but we narrowed it down because it would def be to much to order! This place is also a little expensive.  We decided on:A duck and sausage homemade macaroni with tomato sauce. This was amazing! I could have had a pound of this. It was fresh and rich. The only way I can describe is the flavors weren't muddled.  In some sauces you cant taste each ingredient, this you can! Just delicious.  Def something you need to get if it is a special that night.I ordered  the goat cheese and truffle agnolotti with corn and scallion. This was yummy.  Creamy with a hint of truffle and the sweetness from the corn went nicely. I really liked this. Just know the pasta is about 6oz per order. They are small portions like an app size not an entree size!! For an entree I ordered Scallops with prosciutto, figs and melon. For one, this is bitter melon. The scallops were sweet and crunchy on one side. The figs complimented the scallops so well. The saltiness of the Prosciutto and melon went well, but was barely there and I think there was cooked romaine underneath? Three scallops come with an order. I feel this is more like an app then an entree. I really liked this dish but I wanted more, especially for the price!We also ordered saltimbocca. This dish was def not much to look at. A round disk in a plate but it was very good! Underneath the veal was a small side of escarole. The veal was tender and it was crunchy and fried and perfectly seasoned! We also got a side of escarole it was cooked with garlic and it was amazing. Tender and not bitterWe couldn't leave with out getting dessert. We absolutely had to get the Tartufo. Hazelnut gelato covered in chocolate and underneath a pool of chocolate Genache and hazelnut. By far a decadent and great dessert. Not to sweet but just right! I had the olive oil cake kissed with citrus, roasted peaches and a unique twist, sesame gelato. What a great combination!  The cake was slightly warm which really made this awesome.  I thoroughly loved this dessert! A must tryThe wait staff was nice and polite. Although, once she heard we weren't going for the expensive wine or cocktails she kind of lost interest in us. She didn't bother giving us the amuse bouche like every table who ordered wine and didn't tell us about the dessert specials. We felt a little left out and not taken care of. Lupa is beautiful, romantic and some what quiet as long as your sitting in the back dining room. Make sure you make a reservation and def leave time to get a spot if your driving.  (256)",6,0,3,Kim G.,"New York, NY",149,340,1077

Why does it not taste the same and it's not even peppery at all. Not to mention it was under cooked and P tasted and was wondering why was I raving about this dish. I had to send it back and when it came back, still the same, still lacklustre, but they added more pepper and some parts were al dente and some were still under cooked.Yeah, whatever, not coming back here ever again and they obviously don't care about their customers here and making things right, since they get so much tourists coming in and out of here.",3,2,0,Ro R.,"Brooklyn, NY",83,2220,93

The ingredients served with the duck breast were similarly perfect. It is rendered before it is served, so make sure to order an appetizer in advance.

I would imagine a 180lb guy needing two of these to be satisfied.- Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage & Fennel $17 - the sausage is just sprinkles of ground sausage, my friend found out the hard way after receiving her order lol While she was disappointed about the lack of protein, she admitted that the gnocchi was on point with a perfect soft texture and the sauce was good.- Fried Lupa Baccala $22 - didn't get to try this but it looked good. Friend who ordered this didn't seem that impressed though...Service:Amazing. Even with the conditions they were working in, my waiter had a sense of humor and was lovely. He always came back to refill our water and check in. We were also treated to some fava bean crostini - courtesy of the chef, it was a nice touch :)Side note:The bathrooms are sketchy, dimly lit and small....",2,2,2,Elaine C.,"New York, NY",426,341,1129

I didn't notice this until I flashed my phone flash light on a strange looking and feeling substance and googled what I had been eating. I threw up later that evening. Besides my gross pasta, my friend had a 15$ pasta dish that was butter pasta and pepper. It was over priced and inedible. Do not waste your time or money here.",0,3,0,Jen C.,"Hanalei, HI",0,13,1

4.0,7/6/2016,"My friend and I stopped here for a small pasta meal after a long hot day of walking around the city. I used to live in New York, but have since moved to Philly, so we were exploring some of our old haunts. A few years back we had enjoyed an amazing meal at Babbo, and obviously jumped at the opportunity to try another Mario restaurant. The food was really nice. I can't complain about that. I had the Bucatini Amatriciana and my friend had a gnocchi dish. However, our server left us with a sour taste. I don't know his name because I don't believe he ever told us. We didn't order drinks and we only ordered an appetizer of olives and then one pasta dish for each of us. I'm not sure if it's because we didn't rack up a hefty bill, or if he didn't feel like he needed to waste his time on two 20 something girls when their were older people in bigger groups, but he made it clear that he didn't have time for us. He hardly made any eye contact, and usually only stopped by our table long enough to drop our food. If we had had any questions or problems with the food, we would not have been able to get a hold of him. I even left him a note on the check, saying ""You are a bad server, though I still left a 20% tip because I also work in the service industry and would never tip less.""

The pastas were the right portions, flavors, rich and beautiful. The Bavette Cacio e Pepe was spicy but addictive. Then came the desserts. OH, the desserts.

Otherwise, food was fine, although slightly saltier than it should be. Lights are so dim you can't see the menu. The music soundtrack would have been good for a dive bar, not an Italian restaurant.

The spaghetti pomodoro was a decent portion size and pretty tasty, although it seemed to be missing something. The cacio e pepe asparagus side had good flavor.

5.0,6/4/2016,"With so many amazing restaurants in NY, where do you go?  How do you choose?  If you, like me, are a fan of the Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group's restaurants, then the dilemma is simply deciding which B & B restaurant to visit for dinner. If you've read my reviews, you'll know I'm a huge fan of Otto in Las Vegas.  That said, I definitely wanted to visit Otto in NY, but wanted to try something different.  And since we tend to be a casual group, that left out Del Posto & Babbo for this trip (but assuredly we will be back to try them both).  After hearing that Lupa has the best Roman-style dishes we eagerly made reservations.Upon arriving at Lupa, I was delighted with the quaint, welcoming vestibule and friendly hostesses.  We were seated on the patio - a perfect outdoor table hidden behind a privacy screen of foliage, separating diners from strolling pedestrians.  The very cordial GM, Ray, greeted us with Prosecco (a wonderful way to start a meal!).  A generous prosciutto board soon followed, and the gauntlet was thrown with Ray's tongue-in-cheek ""Take that, Vegas!"".  Man, this place is FUN!Next up, marinated sardines and multi-colored beets with pistachio and ricotta salata (one of my favorite cheeses).  The men enjoyed the sardines while us ladies shared the beets.  Very refreshing and light!  We eagerly anticipated the next course: Primi.  As other reviewers mentioned, the Bavette Cacio e Pepe is a-MAZ-ing!  This is a dish that I will dream about...  The pasta was perfectly cooked al dente and the strong pepper flavors were balanced with a slight butteriness that I won't forget anytime soon.  We also had to try the Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage & Fennel, and they were perfectly fluffy, tasty little pillows.  Francesca was so lovely and has a wonderful palate for wine!  Her recommendation was spot-on - just wish I could remember Our easy-going, friendly waiter with great pronunciation of the Italian dishes (Gavin? Garlin? Sorry...you were great!) recommended the flank steak and I knew the men would want to try the oxtail as soon as they heard ""oxtail"".  Francesca's 2nd recommendation was even better! A 2009 Paolo Bea Montefalco Sagrantino from Umbria was complex and stood up nicely to the proteins.Wrapping up this incredible meal, we tried several desserts (kudos to the pastry chef!) - the olive oil cake was delectable!  Moist without being too wet served with the most beautiful, delicate cream and luscious cherries.  I wish I could remember the name of the golden ball of goodness that lay atop of berry compote.  It was mouthwatering!  Ray was incredibly generous (and so much fun!), as he brought out amaro.  My favorite, Nonino, and one I hadn't tried before, D'Arancia Rossa (blood orange) from Sicilia.  I love the delicateness of Nonino, but it is sweet.  The blood orange amaro was a fun and interesting contrast, and worth seeking out again.  And with a flair that only Ray can deliver, we ended a phenomenal meal at Lupa.  Thank you for a wonderful experience, and making us feel like family!",2,1,1,Stephanie P.,"Henderson, NV",94,133,60

3.0,5/5/2016,Lupa is a fine restaurant but it didn't amaze me on my first meal there yesterday.  We ordered Italian Margaritas to start and they turned out to be surprisingly tasty and potent.  They had a tinge of spice to them that put us in a good mood as we threw them back while trying to study the menuThe atmosphere is quite dark and reading the menu was only possible with my IPhone's light - this made me particularly hesitant about ordering a fine bottle of Italian Red as I'd at least like to know what it is I'm ordering before dropping coin on a nice bottle.My lamb chops were juicy but too salty - not quite salty enough to send back but almost.  The Verdi fettuccini with minced veal and prosciutto was excellent and suitably 'all dente' but I would try a different Beginning Pasta if I go back to Lupa as there are many exotic sounding pastas to choose from.As is typical in New York our dishes were whisked away by the busboy even though I hadn't finished all my food - details like this make one feel like the management cares more about the next clients who will take our place and less about who is sitting there now.I would go back to Lupa again but not before trying some of the other fine Italian Restaurants that abound in NYC.Reservations are advised to dine at Lupa,2,1,0,Luke P.,"Charlottesville, VA",15,18,3

4.0,4/5/2016,"Went to LUPA this past weekend for my birthday dinner with my husband. I was craving some decent carbonara ever since having it in Rome and was told this was the place to get my fix. We made reservations because we saw the 6 course pasta tasting on their website and that was my plan. My husband isn't so much into pasta but fortunately they have a 6 course roman tasting that was listed on the menu alongside the pasta tasting that was right up his alley. Only reason I don't give this restaurant 5 stars is because we were told when we went to order one of each of the tastings, that all people at the table have to do the same tasting. Disappointing.... especially because they are both 6 courses and both ""tastings"" - seems like an unfortunate rule. Despite that; everything was fantastic. The carbonara is spectacular and so was every other pasta on the pasta tasting menu. I even tried the sweetbreads which was a first for me! And if you like guanciale, it's featured in several of the pasta dishes; perfectly fatty and crisp in all it's gloriousness. I personally hit a wall at pasta course #5 but brought that course home as leftovers. Finished off with a creamy lemon sorbet which closed out the meal perfectly. Love the restaurant - love the romantic lighting but I did question if the romantic lighting in the bathroom is the best choice when sharing restrooms with men who may not have great aim and was confused in general by the music playing during our meal. You would think some low key romantic Italian music would be serenading you while you eat pasta but I was truly stumped with the choice to blast Journey.....

My friend and I came here for dinner on Thursday. We had early 6PM reservations. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by a very friendly Maitre D and were seated right away. Menus were brought over and they asked us whether we wanted sparkling or tap. We chose sparkling. Within seconds of us being seated, a very nice young gentleman, (I wish I remembered his name) came over and introduced himself as the sommelier. I was quite overwhelmed with the wine list as it's quite extensive so I described the type of red I like and he offered two great options in the right price range. I chose one and was not disappointed at all. It was the Montefalco Rosso, very dry and medium bodied wine that paired beautifully with the dishes we ordered. CONSTANTINE! The man of the hour. What a real pleasure. Constantine was our waiter who really made our meal so magical and fun. The menus are all in Italian with the back of the menu having a dictionary but it could definitely be overwhelming. So having a waiter who knows every good dish, and knows translations is exactly what we needed. He explained why we should go with the appetizers and entree's we ordered and surely, they were the best decisions!We ordered as follows:Roasted Cauliflower with Black Truffle Fonduta ---- The combination of flavors in this dish is purely outstanding. The sweet pears combined with the flavors of the truffle and the savory cauliflower was simply top notch.Marinated Sardines --- Sardines have never tasted so good than this right here. They take that unappetizing fishiness out and present a perfect dish.Casarecce with Short Rib Ragu --- I'm salivating just thinking about this. I thought I'd had good pasta dishes but then I tasted this and my mouth dropped. The rigatoni was cooked at a perfect al dente. And those short ribs! AHHH! Tasty, soft, tender, perfection! Pollo Alla Diavola --- It's called the devils chicken and rightfully so. If you like your mouth on fire, this is the dish you should order. Covered in black pepper and cooked remarkably well, this dish is to die for. Lamb Scottadito with Gnocco Alla Romana --- If only all restaurants knew how to make a lamb taste this good! Maybe that's why Lupa is so up there on the ranks. Fantastically medium rare, soft and juicy this lamb was so outstanding. What can I say, their food is just 100%.All of these dishes were recommended by Constantine and I thank him for being so attentive and perfect. Really. For dessert, the sommelier suggested we order the Tartufo. GUYS! This is paradise. Chocolate - hazelnut - nutella - gelato. What more could you possibly want? This ball of paradise only upped the night by 100 notches. It was the perfect end to a perfect dinner. I cannot be more thankful to the wonderful team at Lupa for giving us VIP service when we were just coming in for a small time dinner.

1.0,2/29/2016,"I was compelled to write a review after two terrible experiences at Lupa. Each experience was marred before we even got to the table. Experience 1, called in to the restaurant an hour before and was told there was a 30 minute wait for a table (for 2). Arrived and was told by the same lady that the wait was 3.5 hours. Wait what? Instead of an explanation, I was met with a cool indifference. Great. One month later, I decided to treat the past incident as an aberration  and went back...with a reservation in hand. What could wrong now? Turns out a sh*t tonne. Upon arriving at the restaurant I was told I didn't in fact have a reservation. Funny, I seemed to have a emailed confirmation from opentable on my phone. Upon pointing this out to the hostess I was met with complete indifference. Mind you this was someone completely new - apparently being unhelpful is part of the job at Lupa. Rather than try to work with me, the customer, I was told I would just have to wait...for an unspecified amount of time.  Ughhhhhhh!So asides from sharing my experience about a restaurant, the real reason I wanted to write this review was to publicly shame Mario Batali. One of two things is true here. (1) this jovial image he portrays is a complete facade and he is a phony or (2) he has completely lost touch with his own restaurant and it's operating in a manner completely unreflective of the man that owns it (and which it should be a representation of). Either way, terribly disappointing.",1,1,0,Jim L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0
4.0,2/26/2016,"Now this is what Italian food is all about! Came here for weeknight dinner with a friend and had a great experience from beginning to end.  We were seated right away were immediately brought a ""compliments from the chef"" dish and bread for the table.  While I am sucker for warm bread (love the taste of melted butter on warm bread), the bread was in fact cold but above average taste. What we Ordered: Bucatini Al' Amatriciana - GET THIS!! Known as one of their signature dishes.  Loved that had a kick to it.  Spiciness seemed to have come from black pepper and hint of chiles - that combined with perfect al dente pasta made me wanting more! Will absolutely order this again. Ricotta Gnocchi - While this was very tasty as well, it did not come close to the amount of flavor as the previously mentioned dish.  Probably would not order this again.  Instead, I would consider the Bavette Cacio E Pepe, another one of their signature dishes and if you're sharing - nice to have a variety of sauces. Lupa Tartufo - A giant forrero rocher is how I would probably describe this dish.  A bit big to share only for 2 but perfect to share with 4.",2,1,1,Anu K.,"Manhattan, NY",341,227,407

5.0,1/6/2016,"I can't stop loving this place. It was my first time trying lupa and I am thinking of when am I going to return. My brother wanted to try some high end restaurant from some famous chef while visiting NYC and Lupa was my choice after doing a bunch of research. They do have a reservation at 6pm on a Monday holiday week. When I arrived, the wait was an hour without reservation. Thank GOD I made one.I am not a huge italian cuisine fan but reading good reviews and my brother wanted to try so I just find myself once in a while ending up in an Italian restaurant.Looking at the menu, while I love how they use all the Italian words that I don't understand but with a description behind. Waiter/waitress that works here need to have a good memory since the first thing he did was telling us all the special and all the price. They have like at least 5 specials, some of it are on the menu. The wine by glasses are priced served in 1.5-2 glasses which I find it pretty cheap for $15, I am able to enjoy more than 1 glass of red wine. Before hitting the main entree, we were served some complimentary bread, which was warm and delicious. I don't even need olive oil or butter with it. There is also a small complimentary amuse from the chef which was some spread on the bread. My brother and I started of with grilled octopus. The grilled octopus is so flavorful and cooked to perfection. I think it was my favorite so far out of all places but my brother preferred fried.I went ahead and order myself porterhouse pork chop topped with honey crisp apple and lentils. I see many table ordered this and I bet this is their signature dish. I am not a huge fan of pork and I decided to be a little adventurous in trying new stuff since the waiter also recommended it. I am so glad I did. The pork was juicy (kinda tasted like steak). It was a little on the salty side I wished is a little less salty but it goes well with my red wine and the apple. My brother ordered the crispy duck agrodolce which was one of their specialty. The duck was boneless and it was served with risotto. I had a bite of it and I immediately fall in love as well. I am always afraid of boneless duck because some restaurant make it so dry but the duck here was soaked with flavorful sweet spice.

5.0,1/4/2016,"My meals at Lupa have more or less been impeccable. Residing in the upper tier of the NYC Batali empire, this is a top pick for a fancy and flavorful experience. This place is pricey but worth every cent. My favorite dish, hands down, is the roasted quail (preparation varies with the season). I don't know how they manage to get this bird so succulent and glorious. Other stand-outs include the grilled baby octopuses, lamb chops, and if you are feeling adventurous, the pajata finta. This last one is rigatoni pasta tossed in a sauce of offal, tomato, and cream. Truly though, it is nearly impossible to go wrong with any item on the menu. All meals are served with an amuse bouche to get you amped up, and delightfully olive-oily salty focaccia. Service is deft and personable.

My fav of the night. Cooked perfectly al dente with these retardedly good crispy pork cheeks. I can never have regular pasta again. Gnocchi - we literally cleaned the bowl with our focaccia bread. The sauce was AMAZEBALLS. It was blended with sausage and SO flavorfulCacio e Pepe - also so good but you needed to have his first because the immense flavors of the other two will make this one seem too simple. Order and eat this one first with the table then order the other onesEntree:Lamb: so tender, SO goodSkirt Steak: we shouldn't have ordered this, should've went with another pasta. We ordered medium, this came rare and was barely chewable unfortunately. Without this dish or the cold apps that should've been hot this would've been a 5 star review.

If this were like a gelato/ice cream cake texture I would've been all over it. Good flavors tho. Overall:PASTA PASTA PASTA. Some of the best pastas we've ever had.

But there is one - and only one - favorite of mine.  LUPA!  we stumbled on Lupa years ago when we had in our minds that we wanted to go to Babbo (one of Mario's restaurants) but couldn't get anywhere NEAR a reservation!  settle?  i wouldn't call it that, but we went.  and it was one of the best meals I'd ever had.  for years we would visit NYC for business and make reservations for our first night in at Lupa - sometimes our flight would be late (shocker!) and we'd call and let them know, only to be answered with ""no problem, mrs stone ... see you when you get here.""  the people are so amazing that, even tho they have a teeny tiny space, they would hold our luggage at the front until we finished dinner!  THE ATMOSPHERE:small, cramped (but in a good way - hey!  how else are you going to determine what you're having for dinner if you can't see your neighbor's plate?), comfy Italian feel, casual, relaxed, laid back but with a TON of style.  romantic. THE WINE LIST:i can't even begin to tell you what this wine list is like.  if there was ever an italian wine that you loved, it's on this list.  the ALL Italian wine list can be a bit overwhelming, if you're uncertain about italian wines - and in that case, you need to talk to the wine guy because he can totally set you up with a great suggestion!  Average prices, but the selection makes up for it - id rather have an awesome selection and pay a wee bit more for that!THE FOOD:This is the real deal, y'all!  Every pasta is handmade.  meats are cured in-house.  sauces are special and the tastes are just amazzzzzing!  we always used to start with the shaved brussels sprouts with pecorino, but thats not on the menu any longer (sorry - but if it comes back, you need to have it), but now we are into the brussels sprouts de bufala.  perfection.  we usually have a salumi tray at $10 a choice (they have a few choices) - pro tip: the meat tray is VERY PLENTIFUL - order wisely.  All of the pasta dishes are great - they run anywhere between $13 and $21 and my favorite is a toss up between the sausage and fennel gnocchi and the cappellacci with brown butter and sage sauce.  On the secondi menu, i can tell you that i have seen most things on the menu - and have tried a handful of them - you cant go wrong with any.  And any of the sides are a great addition to your table.  For dessert - you have to have the tartufo - no question.  or maybe the panacotta ... or the lemon cake.  hmmm - at 10 bucks a pop, get a few!  But what really interested me this last time was the chef's tasting - the guy sitting next to us was having his own version of the chef's roman tasting and wow - i wish i had seen this the night before when we were in (yes, we visited two of the three nights we were in town!).   It was a good amount of food for $65 - I dont know if i can eat that much, but next time im going to give it a try!",6,3,3,Christina S.,"Birmingham, AL",289,190,276

4.0,11/8/2015,"Crowded and casual high-end Italian.  The lamb mezzaluna were delicious, though compared to the heaping bowls of pasta that my dining companions had, my plate was far smaller especially given what I remember as the $23  price (and I definitely could have eaten more).  The crimini and parmesan with aceto salad was also small but very tasty.  I also liked the bread.  Wheelchair accessibility notes:  There are two stairs to get in, but that's the least of the problems (and I didn't ask whether there is a portable ramp -- there may well be).  The tables are very close together and the place is very crowded, so I don't think a wheelchair patron would have an easy time navigating.  Plus, I saw only two single bathrooms, and even the larger one seemed too small for a wheelchair patron.  FYI.",0,0,0,Meg S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,137,0

The food was not exciting at all...I felt like I could cook every dish better and I don't even cook often.  The appetizers were confusing and not enjoyable (roasted cauliflower Truffles & brussel sprout).  The spaghetti and Gnocchi were just there, not interesting or special.If you don't know Italian food by name (Like me) it'll take you a while to order since the menu does not describe any of the dishes, they have a long dictionary in the back but who's going to take the time to review it in detail.  Our meal came out to $150 and was not worth it.The only bright spot is that the service is pretty good.",3,0,0,Minto S.,"Richmond Hill, NY",147,274,10
3.0,10/29/2015,"Honestly, I was expecting more from a Mario Batali restaurant, especially after a friend raved about it. Their specials sounded amazing, but I decided to go with the gnocchi (their version is made of ricotta cheese, instead of potato) with sausage and fennel. The sauce was tomato based, and I expected there to be chunks of sausage and for it to be separate from the sauce, but it was embedded in the sauce. Also, I didn't really taste the fennel. The gnocchi was pretty good though and tasted light, with a nice texture. The entree portions were quite small. At least the appetizer of slices of potato with lemon and rosemary were a bit more substantial. The potato pieces were thick, crispy, tasty with lots of flavor from the rosemary and lemon.The prices were a bit on the higher side. I am glad that I picked the gnocchi for my main course, versus the special, which was twice as much. My friend ended up getting a fish dish, which had a decent taste, but was definitely not worth $25.The service was spotty. For example, I think we were supposed to get bread, but the waiter never brought us any and we didn't think to ask until we saw they had brought bread to another table and by that time, we had already finished eating.I don't plan on coming back and I probably won't trust the person who recommended the place, regarding restaurants, but I am glad I had the chance to try it for myself.",13,10,9,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",783,438,5876

4.0,10/22/2015,"This is one of Batali's restaurants located near Washington square.  I decided to go for a quick lunch because I read an article recently about their pasta, which i was craving at the moment.  The restaurant was not packed because it was a weekday lunch before noon.  For drink I asked the server for a nonalcoholic cocktail, and he fixed a bloody orange drink, which was decent.  Then they took out focaccia with olive oil, which was very good.  focaccia was very soft but with good texture, and olive oil complimented the bread perfectly.  The very sort of thing I was expecting from this place.  Even though they were offering pasta tasting menu (5 pastas + dessert), I decided to go with an appetizer and primi because I wasn't that hungry, but really wanted to have a good pasta.  I ordered a roasted cauliflower with truffle sauce.  it was roasted well, then the sauce made it a perfect appetizer.  The only thing was that it would have been greater if I had a bit more sauce topped on the cauliflower.  For entree, I ordered a spaghetti with tomato sauce.  This sauce had a very strong flavor and aroma of tomato, which I haven't tasted before.  My guess is that the herbs and greens he added to the tomato when making the sauce made the flavor very strong.  Here again, the only caveat was that pasta was not cooked enough (at least for me, but I don't know if their way is how pasta is supposed to cooked).Overall it was a great lunch for one, and I would definitely come back for the pasta tasting menu.",2,2,2,Jay I.,"New York, NY",260,683,192

3.0,8/14/2015,"For the longest time, I have been a Batali fan-boy. I used to watch Molto Mario, and more recently devoured the Mario-esque chapters in Bill Buford's Heat. I remember his accounts on how fervently Batali would make traditional Roman ravioli, and the care that went into its preparation. With all this knowledge, I decided to embark on the Roman Pasta Tasting Menu at Lupa, and it goes to show that the book is once again better than the adaptation. That's not to say anything was terrible, just that most of it felt inauthentic and lacked an organic flow. I'm no expert, but simply an Italian who has eaten some of these dishes in Italy and imitated them under more rigid terms. The lack of flow began with the pappa shotglass of tomato pulp and bread. I wasn't sure if it was it had any relation to the meal that would follow or simply served as an acidic palate cleanser. Onto the mains: The tonnarelli was the most technically proficient pasta of the evening, but the cacio e pepe it was served in was too reliant on butter. The carbonara that followed must have been made from the same base, with no discernible component of cracked egg. The most disappointing dish of the evening, however, was the veal saltimbocca ravioli. They were still due south of al-dente when served and the crisped bits on the plate did nothing to bring out the flavor. On the other end, the bucatini amatriciana that followed was the highlight of the evening, with deliciously smoky pancetta. Finally, we get to the Pajata Finta, their speciality, worth of an article in Saveur. It was an adequate, gamey conclusion to the meal, but the ricotta beneath it felt less like finta and more like filler. The peach sorbet at the close of the meal was delicious, but once again a disconnect from the everything that preceded it. To end with some praise, the Bastianch red that we ordered (which I assume is imported directly by them) was delicious accompaniment to the last three courses. If given the chance to go to Lupa again I would, but I've been put off their pasta.",0,0,0,Ari P.,"Queens, NY",40,403,0

I would prefer that they would have told us that it will take such a long time, and we could choose to go to a different restaurant for dinner.The second part is the food: Great! My favorite is the Pasta orecchiette with duck Ragu, maybe one of the best I ever had. But still, with such a long waiting, it was hard to call the whole experience great.

Despite coming during restaurant week, they were still at top form, and everything I ordered (with the possible exception of the dessert) was fantastic, as was the service.The restaurant week menu is limited to a choice of three items for each of the three courses, but they seem to have assembled it in such a way as to give most diners a good set of options. I started with the baby octopus, which was a nice-sized serving of really small little cephalopods in a light dressing. For the main I had the pork arista with pork mostarda on sautéed greens, which was again delightful (though maybe a bit small for people with huge appetites). Dessert was a tough one for me, but I finally went for the ricotta with fennel honey, which I found I didn't love, since perhaps the honey was insufficient for the volume of cheese, but whatever the reason, I could barely discern its flavour. I went for the wine pairing with my meal, and enjoyed each of the three wines they poured me. The only service hiccough I experienced was with the wine, which was not poured by the time the accompanying course had arrived for my main and dessert, though this was quickly rectified. Lupa is a great option for people wishing to savour the Mario Batali style of Italian food without resorting to paying Babbo-style prices or dealing with a long wait for a table.

We were so excited and had such high expectations, being that this is Mario Batalli owned...but sadly left with some mix feelings...First of all, coming to a restaurant and being presented with a menu that has a dictionary on the back, the last thing you want to do is read and try figuring out things for your else. Having no idea how to order, we expected to receive guidance from our waiter...bad idea! Was this guy high? On crack? How the hell is he a waiter for such a well known chef's restaurant?? The guy came to take our order while looking around the world and asking if we're ready. No explanation, no recommendation and no care. Somehow, we figured out the menu and started with the beef rib pasta, and for out entrees, I went with the skirt steak, while my husband ordered the lamb chops? Oh and to mention, our ""waiter"" didn't ask how we would like the steak or lamb cooked. Took our order and went on his merry way. Received our pastas, didn't get asked if we would like cheese on it. Anyhow, getting to the food...OMG! Bite of heaven in your mouth!! One of my fav pastas already and I'm not even a huge pasta fan! Highly recommend this dish to anyone coming here. And the portion is a meal itself, which we wish we would have been informed on! Then came our entrees which we ended up taking couple bites of and bringing back home because we were so full. The skirt steak was cooked to perfections, soft, juicy and packed with flavor. Lamb chops, delicious and perfect! Only wished that the entrees came with a better side for the price. Nevertheless, Mario Batali definitely delivers with his food! Winner!! We waited for God knows how long. The party next to us began complaining because they had the same  waiter us. Apparently, our waiter had disappeared and left for the day and didn't even inform us!! Finally, the manager came due to the next party complaining and we had a chance to pitch in. He apologized and introduced us to a new waiter. Gave us dessert on the house, but then he also disappeared for a while after apologizing about the last guy. Is this place a trend for bad service???

We truly enjoyed the main course and one of our pasta dishes, namely the corned filled pasta.  We were slightly disappointed with the carbonara, the ""sauce"" was so thin and liquified that it did not stick to the spaghetti. It was like a spaghetti soup. We are spoiled with Wiley""s spaghetti carbonara at meadowlark, it's our favorite. The only other issue was the loud heavy metal music.  It was so harsh so we asked why they were playing it and they kindly changed it to Led Zeppelin which was much milder than the previous songs.

5.0,6/15/2015,"Lupa, I love you to the moon and back. Ok, that was a pretty bad attempt at a wolf-pun, but seriously, everyone needs to go here. Or rather, everyone needs to steer clear so I can eat everything myself. Truly, truly well-executed and delicious food from the focaccia bread to the very last side dish. Not sure whether they are better at making seafood or meat dishes? You don't even have to ask because they know how to cook everything, period. Here are the deets of my insanely good meal:-buccatini: just get this. Probably the best pasta on the menu, I don't think I left a speck of that amazing red sauce, and that's coming from someone who isn't a huge fan of red sauce in general. The chunks of delicious pancetta are crazy good as well, but I would say that they could have been a bit crispier. -octopus: smoky, tender, melt in your mouth awesomeness. I would eat this all day, and start growing tentacles at some point, but  luckily it's pretty filling. You may initially doubt the portion size, but 2 pieces are enough to fill a person up honestly-pollo al Diablo: don't let that ""al Diablo"" scare you off, this chicken dish is not actually that spicy. It's more of a smoky chipotle flavor, and let me just say that is some fine chicken. The skin was flawlessly crispy and the meat silky and tender. Wow just wow. Chicken can be a pretty boring entree option at most places, but Lupa's chicken rocks in its simplicity with a touch of  kick. Oh, and did I mention it comes with a roasted red pepper and tomato bruschetta?-broccoli rabe side dish: this was a good way to get some veggies in the meal, and I'm glad we ordered it, but it's definitely not as extraordinary as the primi and secondi dishes. I was a tad bit disappointed because the menu said pickled chili peppers and I'm pretty sure they just sprinkled on raw chili peppers (not very spicy ones). However. I was very happy that the broccoli rabe was cooked perfectly. We were way too stuffed for dessert, but I've heard myths about their Tartufo. Apparently Romulus and Remus were only motivated enough to found Rome after they were fed this hazelnutty goodness. Or so they say.",2,1,0,Claudia D.,"New York, NY",58,109,211

The sommelier was so knowledgeable and personable. We ordered the tasting menu with wine pairing. Every dish arrived photo ready, perfect temp, and tasted amazing. Each course was better than the last. The wine pairings were not all home runs, but you could see why it was paired with the dish. Not everyone has the sophisticated pallet for such a variety of wines. There were only two wines we didn't like or finish. There was not a dish that we failed to finish.  It was a great way to celebrate our anniversary. I loved the experience and will absolutely return. The pasta with pork cheek was the most amazing dish I have ever tasted. My mouth waters for it as I write this. The pasta was all freshly made and perfectly al dente. Best I ever had. The most amazing part was how simple the dishes were yet the flavor profiles were over the top. The ox tail was so tender, it fell apart with a fork. They gave us knives, but we didn't need them. This place is special. You get what you pay for. Don't expect this quality without an equal price tag.

I've been to Lupa about 5/6 times now. every time had been amazing until last night. there were 4 of us, we all got starters which were excellent. especially the prosciutto. then we got some pastas to share, which were also all excellent. and then we got our main courses. these were not excellent. they were all very heavy on the salt. we had the market fish, the pork, the octopus, and the veal. after eating less than half (each one of us) we let them clear the table. initially we thought we simply over ordered, and that was why it was impossible to finish. but when we started eating our desserts (we shared the tartufo snd the lemon semifreddo - both excellent), we then realized that it was just all too much salt! we actually were still hungry!as soon as we realized this, we brought the saltiness to the attention of our waiter. and he said he'd mention it to the manager and hopefully she'd be able to help out. well this is where the meal went downhill in a hurry. the manager was just useless. Maria Chicarelli was her name. she claimed that because we waited to bring up the saltiness till after the less than half eaten plates were cleared, there was nothing she could do because they could no longer assess the food. to which our logical response was, ""how do u assess saltiness? are u gonna taste it?"" I certainly hope not lol I can understand assessing food if the complaint is overcooking something, but assessing saltiness? the whole conversation was odd and resulted in no solution. she single handedly ruined our experience making 4 loyal customers never go back again. my hope is that this review gets read and that Maria gets taught a lesson.

Pasta cooked al dente infused with the sauces they were finished in. For dessert, we enjoyed the orange and fennel panna cotta and two glasses of Prosecco. Everything was great at this restaurant, I really enjoyed the building it was housed in, lots of exposed brick with many arches spanning the walls, certainly feels like you could be eating at a place in Rome. The one drawback of the place was the noise level. Perhaps it was that particular night(it was a Saturday night), or being sat next to a large group, or the bass coming through the speakers pretty loudly. I was hoping for a slightly quieter place to enjoy dinner, it's not that the restaurant was too loud, it's that we didn't expect that much energy in the room that evening, but it certainly didn't not dampen our spirits. Service at the restaurant was exceptional. Friendly staff who are genuinely interested in your dinner and the quality of your dining experience.

We had a nice quiet couple next to us so we lucked out I guess. Ok so the food. We ordered the beet and goat cheese very good. The prosciutto.. I forget which one.. the most popular one. It was good.

The pasta wasn't too Al Dente which I personally hate so I was very happy about that!We also ended with the octopus. which was just ok in my opinion. My BF really liked it. Now I've had this dish a bunch of times all over Italy last year and it's way better there. The reason.. well this one seemed fried to me. Little greasy. My BF said it was grilled. But I don't know seemed like it had this crust on it that didn't quite make the mark. I also wasn't thrilled with the potato, it just wasn't enough for a main.. at 26 dollars. Anyway. to each their own! We ended with the pistachio gelato.. very good. Overall service was great. I was pleasantly surprised with our waitress.. I don't know her name, a brunette.. I know that doesn't help.. but she was friendly and no one rushed us out.Great date spot for sure. They had the window open so it was chilly. but it was not loud at all.

And unfortunately I had that experience at Lupa with 3 graduates of a major school of hospitality in tow. The manager on duty when questioned over the cost of an expensive glass of scotch, $60! When I never paid more than 35 or 40 even at a hotel bar was unapologetic nor graceful. My bill was almost 500 and we enjoyed ourselves with the entrees being the least favorite, but on balance an enjoyable evening. My dinner party was aghast at his attitude, all professionals in his trade, and in my 35 years of dining never was treated as if my business was unimportant, and certainly not appreciated. I let him know my feelings after no accommodation or offering of goodwill was extended-which further flabbergasted me and my party. And I let him know my feelings.

I devoured it. And it had a mountain of cheese, which I immensely appreciated. We had the proscuitto and lingua too. The lingua was nice and tender. My brother had some kind of tripe pasta dish which sounded weird but was actually delicious. I had the bucatini which was some of the best pasta I've ever had. Perfectly al dente, rich flavorful spicy sauce, delectable meat. BUT. I asked for some parmesan to put on it. The waiter told me it didn't need cheese. I put mountains of parmesan on every pasta dish I eat. I cannot eat pasta without parmesan. I like to put on as much cheese as there is pasta. Don't tell me it doesn't 'need' cheese!

Our server was a lovely Colombian who was well versed in Italian cuisine and wine. As an appetizer we had the beets with pistachios and a plate of prosciutto di Parma. Both were exquisite. As a Primo we split the pasta special which was orecchiette (house made, of course) with a tender pork.As my Secondo I had the poached, then charred octopus.

We ordered a salad as appetizer, it was saturated with salt and vinegar, and it wasn't even mixed evenly.  Some part tasted more vinegary, other parts tasted more salty. Ordered 4 other plates: gnocchi, soup dumplings, market fish, and some spaghetti dish.  Each dish was super small, about 8 gnocchi and ""soup dumpling"" in each plate.  Gnocchi had chili pepper in it which I wasn't a big fan of.  The spaghetti dish had nothing but tons of pepper in it, almost too much pepper. Fish tasted fishy, for a very small piece of fillet. Overall, this place is highly overpriced for the little portion and the quality of the food.  We ordered 4 dishes ( each was tiny in portion) and the total cost was $120.  What a rip off!!",1,2,0,Shanna W.,"West Windsor Township, NJ",31,234,18

As an appetizer, my boyfriend and I had the special for the night. It was mozzarella cheese on top of this really crunchy bread which made up for the soft bread served since I do love crunchy bread. As my main dish, I had the Bavette Cacio e pepe which I only ate half of.

1.0,3/8/2015,"Let me start by saying the 1 star reflects the poor service not the food.  But I do think that service is important and so I have taken the time to write this review.  I went to Lupa last week during lunch.  I called ahead of time because the restaurant week menu did not list a vegetarian entree.  The woman on the phone said that the restaurant would accommodate and mentioned a specific pasta, the pumpkin ravioli, as one such option.  Satisfied with this pleasant possibility, I made the reservation and went to Lupa. Upon arrival, the waiter told me they could not accommodate my vegetarian diet but would check with the manager.  The manager told me in no uncertain terms that they would not substitute a veg entree on the preset menu.  The manager told me that no one should have told me otherwise on the phone and that he would make sure his staff knew that going forward.  Suffice to say, I was disappointed. If your employee makes a mistake, you should try to accommodate.  I came specifically because I was told it would be fine.  Nevertheless, I decided to move forward.  I ordered a la carte: The cacio e pepe, which was delicious.  I also ordered a quartino of wine.  When my bill came, I noticed that the price of the wine was higher than I remembered on the menu.  I asked my new waiter about it and he told me my previous waiter (whose shift had presumably ended) had switched the wine I ordered because they were out of what I wanted.  But I was never told this and then I was charged the higher price. Again, no discernable reaction from the restaurant.  It was only after I complained affirmatively about it that the restaurant made an adjustment in price.  I know Lupa, with its excellent food, will continue to enjoy success.  But they have lost this customer.",3,0,1,Hiral M.,"Manhattan, NY",1,5,0

It was their special for the day.... needless to say, it wasn't that special. I got some kind of pasta with lamb. I felt the pasta was under cooked and the lamb was stringy and kind of hard to cut. Secondi- I opted for the veal ravioli-the flavors were there, but I wasn't a huge fan of the texture of the ravioli. It was a little hard for my tasteDolci- I got the tartufo. BEST part of the meal.

Portion sizes are a bit on the smaller side, but the food is rich so it leaves you feeling full and satisfied. Ordered the following dishes for 2 people (and this was definitely way too much... we were just super eager to try everything):BRUSSELS SPROUTS: Always a fan of brussels sprouts. There wasn't anything too special about the seasoning or the way it was cooked, but still a tasty side dish nonetheless. BAVETTE CACIO E PEPE: I've been waiting to try this dish for SO long, and I'm so glad my first time having it was at Lupa. It is 100% my new favorite pasta dish, EVER. This version was super buttery and creamy (maybe even TOO much) but I thoroughly enjoyed it. PUMPKIN CAPPELLACCI: I love pumpkin pastas, and this one was delicious. Fresh pasta with a sweet and simple filling. RICOTTA GNOCCHI (made vegetarian): Originally comes with sausage and fennel, but we requested to have it made vegetarian. Was extremely simple-- gnocchi pillows in a marinara sauce. Don't know if there was anything too special about this dish to be honest!Overall, the highlights were the ambiance, cacio e pepe, and pumpkin cappellacci. We also got a fava bean bruschetta dish to try for free, which was super appreciated (and tasty too!). The server was extremely friendly and down-to-earth, and willing to accommodate because we wanted to dine vegetarian.

5.0,2/18/2015,"I thought I'd eaten good Italian food before and I always made fun of Mario Batali's croc inspired get-up, but Lupa blew me away.  Hell, I bet if Batali shredded his orange crocs and sprinkled it over his pasta I'd still wolf the bowl down without a second thought.  Lupa is legit.I didn't mess with appetizers since those seemed like scams.  For a few bucks more, you get pasta.  And don't fool yourself.  It's all about the pasta.  Forget about your diet.  Forget about your gluten free bullshit.  Let the croc wearing pasta god whisper into your ear, ""Pasta.""I was tempted to get the pasta tasting menu but refrained since most prix fixe/tastings were rip offs.  However, I think I might just get it next time because the pastas are amazing.  I tried the Pajata Finta and Bucatini All'Amatriciana.  The most obvious thing you'll notice is how perfectly al dente this pasta is.  I don't know what black magic is going on in the kitchen, but judging by the quality of the pasta and the cooking technique behind it then I'm sure the plain sounding Bavette Cacio e Pepe is well worth it--if someone isn't going to throw sauce or any other kind of shit to dress their carb, you know it's either bomb or someone's trying to rip you off.  I don't think it's the latter.  The Bucatini is pretty spicy so for any of you cats who can't deal, don't order it.  This isn't some pansy ""just a few sprinkles of chili flakes"" nonsense, Batali was clearly not afraid to get some Asian level heat in this.  The Pajata Finta is a creamier and decidedly milder dish, which suited my taste at the time.  Both dishes had this crazy pan-fried pancetta.  I would eat that pig all night long if I could.  So fatty.  So crispy.  I don't know how those pancetta bits retained their crisp even thought those pigs were drowning in sauce.  That's some voodoo shit.It was a Saturday so I was able to get their Braised Pork Cheek entree.  I also tried the Crispy Sweetbreads with Pignoli and Pickled Lemons.  I knew I had to get the cheek because when I asked the waitress if she'd recommend the shoulder or the cheek, when I said 'cheek' she made the best OMG O-face and said, ""Ohhh yeah, the cheeks.""  Hey, if the staff still gets off on the food they eat every day during family meals then you'd be stupid to not get it.  Do you still pop a nut or rub one off to that guy or gal you've been seeing for more than half a year?  Admit it, you don't.  But these servers are, and to a piece of pork.  Yeah, a little bit died inside of me after that plate of pork cheek because I realized I'd never had that experience ever again.  Pork cheek virginity, out the window.  Oh yeah, that Sweetbread was pretty good.  If you're a fan of lymph node and the nasty delicious bits, they did it well.  The one thing I wish they would tell you is that those lemons are edible and you need to eat the damn lemons.  Not only are they delicious non-face-puckering lemons, but they make the dish.  Without them, you've just got some well executed but bland as hell throatal node stuff on your plate.  Put on your knickers and eat the lemon.I could have died right then, before dessert, and wouldn't have complained but I'm glad I clung to life to see the meal to its glorious end.  Lupa served a rice based gelato flavored with almond that day.  It was spectacular.  Not the normal creaminess you'd expect but still hitting whatever mark that dish is supposed to hit.  At that point, I didn't care.  It was delicious.  I'll be honest, I had no idea what the heck a Tartufo was but I'm glad I ordered it.  It's one of things that everyone on  Yelp says is good, but never explains why.  Here are all the reasons why you  will dream of this Tartufo for days to come: it's a hunk of ice cream covered in a layer of hazelnut armor, it's sitting in a pool of its own hazelnut sauce and nutty bits bits, did I mention there's ice cream in there?, there's a brandied cherry in the center, and it's as big as your fist.  Basically, you're eating a huge frozen Farrero Rocher (yes, another Yelper did indeed mention this) except this one will put you into a glorious coma that you'd never want to wake up from.I'm still dreaming of that Tartufo.  Is this real life?",2,3,0,Eric C.,"New York, NY",120,124,0

We came in with our friends from Europe (6 guests), and I guess the waitress assumed we all were visitors, not that it warrants poor service. We shared appetizers- she never gave us appetizer plates, and we ended up using bread ones since we were starving. Not a big deal, but does speak to her lack of attentiveness. Entrée quality was mixed: octopus and pasta special were solid, but skirt steak was barely warm when it made to the table, and pretty tough. Tomato sauce on spaghetti was really not a sauce at all- just warmed up canned tomatoes, pretty embarrassing for the type of establishment. The waitress suggested we get the tomato sauce without chili flakes, and I guess they didn't really have that sauce ready. We had the same pasta 3 weeks ago, huge difference.

We didn't drink what was on our bill.I order the artichoke... I grew up on this dish, and expect a lot from Batali and Bastianich. I'm lucky to say there wasn't any choke. But, there was no stem or heart, either. It was an oily, fried artichoke leaf  ""paper"" that was chewy and bland. I love sweetbreads. A lot. I had high hopes for my main dish, my ""secondi"", to redeem my night. Oh well. Dry & bland.I can not recommend Lupa, for the bar, a snack, and definitely not for dinner. A shame.

5.0,12/23/2014,"Whoa. Lupa, you little she wolf*, you. What a great experience the other night. Not only did I enjoy every bite, but the service was impeccable and the ambiance nice and cozy; perfect for a casual night out or a fancy one. I found for the level of food and service, prices were more than reasonable. What really tied this package up with a bow was that I heard everything from Jay Z to the Fugees to Naughty by Nature throughout the evening and I loved every song. We went with a few cocktails while we browsed the menu and decided to forgo the tasting menu's and pick one dish from each category to share. It ended up to be the perfect amount of food for two and a great way to dine at a restaurant like this!The crimini mushroom starter was the lowest highlight of the meal and they were still pretty good with thick shavings of parmesan. The piccolo plate of fresh cut salumi was delicious and a definite must with ample meat for two. We went with Pajata Finta as our pasta choice since it seemed to be the Lupa special and it was perfection. Al dente pasta with the most flavorful tomato sauce filled with meats and slightly melted ricotta. We finished the meal with the veal saltimbocca: a large spiced, pounded thin veal cutlet. Think schnitzel accompanied with sauteed spinach. We added some brussels on the side and I mean, wow. Just wow. Ending the night with their famed tartufo which was basically a giant gelato version of a Ferrero Rocher and a espresso cocktail was the cherry on top.I don't often frequent the same restaurant in New York since there are so many to try, but without a doubt I'll be back to Lupa. A perfect place for date night, friend night or even rolling solo at the bar. If you're looking for an unpretentious evening filled with fine food, drinks and service, Lupa is your girl.* Lupa is actually Latin for she wolf.

Not great, certainly not spectacular, but not awful, just fine. Perhaps though, I would have enjoyed it more had the manager on duty today not been SO rude to our table.A woman in black came over to bring a fork to one of the guests in my lunch party and we were looking at the wine list. I asked the woman if she could please tell us about some of the wine choices and in the snottiest tone she replies:""I don't know. I'm not the som, I'M the manager.""Um, ok, I am SOOOOO sorry that I mistook you as someone having any knowledge about what's served in your restaurant? Why would the manager know that? And ok, that's fine if she doesn't but there are about a dozen different nice ways she could have replied to my request if she didn't know the answer. Also, a VERY good friend of mine has managed several high end restaurants through out the city and I have seen him at work and NEVER in a million years would he condescend to a customer asking for a wine recommendation.  999 times out of 1000 he would know what his restaurant was serving and if he didn't, he would happily find the answer.I'm officially done with the Batali properties.

Not quite uncomfortable though. And nicely put together. The service was top notch. I'm always worried that these celebrity chef places will be obnoxious and patronizing. Lupa was not at all. Our waiter was friendly and accommodating.Strangely, it was the food that disappointed a bit. The cacio e pepe was a bit overcooked. The pork shoulder was bland and nor particularly tender. The bread was plain bad (though to be fair Italian restaurants don't do well here in general). And the tartufo average. Respect for the interesting selection of cured meats (tongue, cheek) though.

4.0,10/23/2014,"I came here last Friday on a double date and came away very full and very happy.  As you might know, Lupa is one of Mario Batali's more casual restaurants (I would say the vibe is similar to that of Casa Mono's, but the space is much bigger).  The menu is quite large, so I'm glad we came as a group as we got to sample a number of dishes.  We came in a bit too overzealous and had originally wanted to order a primi and secondi each, but the waiter quickly suggested ordering just three of each in addition to a few appetizers since otherwise we would have too much food. This was comforting; he wasn't trying to upsell us.  What we ordered:Appetizers: I am a HUGE fan of cured meats, so we got the Affetati Grande (basically a large meat platter) to share.  It came with a selection of 5-6 meats, and I thought the Linga (pickled veal tongue), and Testa (head cheese) were especially delicious.  The platter also comes in a smaller size so if you're with just one other person, I would definitely suggest getting it to sample the various meats.  We also shared the Spinach & Warm Pancetta Salad, which came exactly as the name would suggest.  This was a light dish and brought some greens to our otherwise meat-heavy meal.Primi: We chose to get the Bucatini All'Amatriciana, the Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage & Fennel, and the Black & White Tagliatelle with Mussels & Jalapeno.  My favorite by far was the Bucatini, with the Gnocchi coming in at a close second.  The Bucatini was cooked perfectly al dente, and I very much liked the red sauce that came with it.  The Tagliatelle was probably the most disappointing, the pasta itself was fine but the dish seemed slightly bland even with the jalapeno scattered throughout.Secondi: At this point we were actually starting to get full, but powered through our Secondi choices which consisted of the Heritage Pork Shoulder, Pollo (Chicken), and Octopus with Salsa Verde & Leeks.  The meat on the pork shoulder was super tender and broke apart easily, but my favorite secondi had to have been the octopus - it came in a generous portion, the texture was perfect, and it was incredibly flavorful.  I try not to order chicken at most restaurants but Lupa delivered a solid dish here; the skin was crispy but I found the meat to be slightly too dry for my liking.  We were too full to try desserts, but I look forward to coming back and trying several next time!",19,10,14,Angela W.,"Manhattan, NY",223,157,65

4.0,8/20/2014,"My girlfriend and I stopped in here for our anniversary, and it was a great choice.  We both had the pasta tasting, and it led to the best and worst meal ever.  The best meal, because it was 5 courses of perfectly prepared pasta (handmade and al dente).  The worst meal because we had to drive home in traffic for 2 hours with full bellies of pasta.  The finish the meal off with a lemon sorbet, which was a nice contrast to the 5 bowls of pasta that came prior, however, I seriously questioned whether I could even stomach it at that point.  All in all, the pasta tasting was solid.  Nothing out of the ordinary or unique about it.  It was simply, well executed.",1,1,0,Wellington W.,"Philadelphia, PA",42,17,1
5.0,8/18/2014,"There was nothing to complain about with dinner at Lupa. From start to finish, we had a great experience. We were a little early for our reservation but were seated right away at a nice table on the terrace. The interior is smaller than I'd expected, but cozy and casual.Starter: a ""piccolo"" assortment of charcuterie which included prosciutto, salumi, coppa, lingua (picked tongue) and testa (head cheese). My favorite by far was the testa - it had a great texture and wonderful flavors. I'm a pate/nasty bits kind of girl so this was right up my alley. I thought it was a pretty good sized serving for $20.Primi: we tried a special which was essentially a ragu Bolognese (forgot the proper Italian name) and cacao e pepe. The waiter kindly split both portions so my husband and I had both - and both were perfect. The Bolognese was rich, meaty and just creamy enough and the cacao e pepe was silky and just the right amount of peppery. It was better than many versions I've had in Rome.Secondi - we split a saltimbocca which was served with sautéed spinach, and we added a side of Italian braised long beans. This is the first saltimbocca I've had that wasn't dried out or tough (and that includes some in Italy). Also, it was a large portion - definitely something splittable for two.Dolci - blackberry panna cotta with buttermilk and black pepper. This was a nice way to finish off the meal. It was light, not too sweet and the flavors of the black pepper came through in a subtle way.Service - lots of places turn out good/great food and then ruin it with lackluster service. Our service here was excellent - our waiter (wish I could remember his name) was warm, friendly and full of great suggestions. When the bottle of wine we ordered was out, he recommended an alternate that was actually less expensive. Overall, my only real nitpick is that the wine list is overpriced in a fairly serious way. The entrée prices are reasonable (most under $30 and pastas in the $15-18 range) so I'd expect to see more bottles in the $28-40 range.That said, our dinner here was excellent",5,2,4,Joanna T.,"Wauwatosa, WI",463,2529,1834

Here's what we ordered. We got the bucatini with the red sauce that found its way into the crevices of the pasta. The gnocchi were pillowy and soft. There was a linguini special that day which was with an olive oil based sauce. And we also had the trout, which was all of our favorite. The fish literally melted the second it entered our mouths.

It wasn't as sauce-y as I would have liked but still very good and cooked al dente. I was impressed by my mom's branzino, but my dad's pork chop was disappointingly dry.I adored the tartufo for dessert and gobbled it up.

2.0,7/28/2014,"Made a reservation for 5 a month ago at Lupa for my daughter's 20th bday. Arrived 5 min early with 4 out of 5 of us (husband was parking). They would not seat us. Another party of 5 came in five minutes later and the hostess seated them. I questioned her about it but she would not budge and seat us. My husband came in at 7:05 and there was no table. Twenty minutes later they wanted to seat us right by the front door adjacent to the bar. It was packed, so there was no way I was going to sit drowning in people. Hostess told us our only option was to sit at a communal table. So we got to sit with 8 loud, rude tourists, right next to the bar with people bumping into our chairs once every 10 seconds.I got to eat my appetizer with the waiter yelling in my ear to the stranger sitting next to me about which wine he could choose and why. Waitress ""by accident"" poured our $$ wine into out sparkiing water glass making for a very expensive white wine spritzer. Service overall was lackluster. Food was okay, lacking in salt but way over peppered. We had trout, pasta carbonara, orachetti with cherry tomatoes, and pasta with a ragu. Appetizers were nothing special. Portions were teeny tiny.

I was in the mood for steak and it was perfectly tender and juicy. My brother got the market fish (sea bass) with sweet corn and cherry tomatoes. Fabulous combination. The only thing missing with our dishes was a side - preferably a carbohydrate. Mashed potatoes would have been perfect, but we didn't see it on the menu.The atmosphere was intimate in size yet lively and happening. Dim lighting also helped set the mood.

Again, not bad - but didn't expect it to taste that way. The chicken was recommended to us by our waitress. It was good but somewhat gamey - had a similar dish at Spasso a couple weeks earlier which was much better.Also tried the veal cutlet which was so thin, you could barely taste the veal.

This was a last minute decision so of course my dining times were relegated to either 6:30 or 10:15. I made a 10:15 and thought we could maybe squeeze in earlier. As chance will have it my honey was late coming in from Greenwich so we walked in around 9:00 on a stormy summer night. I told the pleasant Hostess at the front that we were early and she smiled and said "" your table is going to be ready closer to 10:15"" sad face...but wait..."" You can have a seat at the communal table if you'd like"" yes please!!!! Even though this is a communal table it has more elbow room than a lot of two tops in this city, plus because of an odd number of people at the party next to us I had the seat to my right open. The decor is rustic Italian trattoria that is cozy and somewhat sexy.  From there on our  night was a very pleasant surprise. Upon seating, the absolutely engaging sommelier sidled up to our table and took me through an interesting tour of Italy. I love how the whole face of sommeliers in this city has changed. The majority are now young, tattooed hipsters with such a passion for wine. They're not intimidating or condescending and they make choosing a new and different bottle a fun learning experience. We talked about how we had both studied with the court of master sommeliers and then went on a trip through Italy. He pointed out a lovely Sardinian wine that was fabulous. On to the food. We started with the asparagus with egg and ricotta salada, and you must as well. The egg was cooked to perfection, the ricotta flavorful with a touch of a sour tang and just an all around perfect starter. For a primi we split the ricotta gnocchi with sausage and fennel. They split this for us in the back, which I love. These were pillow like nuggets of flavor. You couldn't see any sausage or fennel, it must have been mixed in but you could taste the sweet flavors all cloaked in a light red sauce, very, very good. For a secondi we went with the trout with fennel and fava beans. This was a perfect whole fish, roasted, super moist and flavorful with just the right amount of accompaniments . The fish comes a la carte so we ordered a side of tortino di patate e prosciutto and if you need a starch, order this. Granted it could have been warmer but it was basically a mound of mashed potatoes studded with really good bacon bits, yes we licked the plate.

My hubs and friends all ordered it as a first course and I tried a bite and loved it! It was so creamy and tasty. I don't even like pasta much but I couldn't stop eating it! Our friends said it was the best carbonara they had ever had. For main course I had the lamb chops which where cooked perfectly and were so tender I could have cut them with a butter knife. It came with a pesto sauce which was a perfect compliment. Hubs had the deviled chicken which was cooked perfectly as well and had nice spice to it. Our friends got the cod and the daily fish special. Both were delicious. In addition to the amazing food, our service was great. The sommelier recommended an amazing bottle of wine that was perfect for our meal. The only thing we didn't like was the bread. It was just your standard focaccia but it was cold and pretty boring.

4.0,5/27/2014,This actually a 4.5 star review or a solid 4 stars.1.We had the escarole salad 5 stars. Just right amount of dressing (the veggies weren't swimming in dressing).2. Gnocchi with fennel. Simply awesome. The flavor from the fennel was perfect and the tomato sauce was not overpowering either. 3. Salimbocca (veal) I found this dish slightly salty (therefore the 4 stars). Otherwise very nice.4. The skirt stake with funghi was great.5. We drank a bottle of Super Tuscan that the sommelier recommend and it was be very good for the price point.I this Lupa would probably receive 5 stars but our experience at Vicoletto  (San Francisco)is still too fresh in my memory.

2.0,4/7/2014,"Maybe Batali just hasn't stopped by here in awhile to ensure some quality control to his menu, but I was seriously (as Ed U put it) underwhelmed by my experience here. After my friend made numerous attempts to get us a reservation for 4 (and failed), we ended up waiting for over an hour to get seated. Once we did (at a communal table), we had one of those super pretentious waiters who constantly interrupted us and pretty much was of the opinion that we're extremely fortunate to have the opportunity to be served by him. That being said, his serving attitude was a little ""over the top"" and none of us appreciated his attitude and his lack of checking in on our table....to the point that I ended up not ordering more wine because my glass was empty for so long and I was just so OVER the experience. Instead, I sipped on my water and appreciated the fact that at least it would end up being a smaller bar bill. We started with some charcuterie and a side of broccoli. Meh. The meat was good, but there wasn't a lot for us to split (for the price). Same deal with the broccoli. Meaning, it all tasted good and the flavors were there, but for the price and portion size - not worth it.My entree - I had fish - I think it was a sea bass - was unremarkable (hence my lack of even remembering which fish it was). What I do know is that my portion was minuscule and the flavoring was non-existent. I didn't even bother finishing it - it was so bland- and I seriously begrudged the price point because of it.We all briefly contemplated dessert and ended up grabbing beer at a place nearby as an alternative, since we really didn't want to give these people more of our money.We ended up spending roughly $100 pp for a mediocre meal.

3.0,4/5/2014,"3.5 stars - we were fortunate to be able to walk in without a reservation at 9 pm on a rainy Thursday night. It felt like we walked into a place in Italy  (as opposed to an Italian restaurant in the US, if that makes any sense) - the menu is full of Italian and the flavors taste foreign and authentic. They have a pretty extensive wine list (all from Italy, waiter/sommelier knows his stuff), and one type of prosecco (it was on the sweeter side).We shared the bucatini all'amatriciana which was served perfectly al dente with crispy bacon (really can't go wrong with bacon) in a red sauce. I'll definitely be coming back for more pasta. For entrees, we got the orata with smoked eggplant and artichoke and the saltimbocca. The orata came out in two fillets, skin on, perfectly crisped. However, my bigger fillet was completely raw in the middle. They were super gracious about it and made me another within 5 minutes, and the finished product was a delicious combination of flavors. The saltimbocca was good - I've never had one served flat (only rolled), but it worked well. For dessert, we shared the tartufo, which really did taste like a giant ferrero rocher, as other reviewers have noted.I'll have to come back for lunch one of these days - they have a 3 course tasting menu for $25 going on right now.",2,1,2,Tammy K.,"New York, NY",71,224,19

The bar staff were attentive plus its more fun exploring the wine list at the bar.   Started with prosciutto de Parma sliced so thin you could see through it. Matched that up with a clam and their version of Israeli couscous -- clean and lots of citrus. Opted to go with the pasta carbonara -- this is a good test of a romana style restaurant. Sure enough the pasta was perfectly aldente and the sauce creamy not soupy and perfectly seasoned.   The ""Tears of Christ"" red was perfectly paired with the pasta.

5.0,3/30/2014,"I've been to Lupa twice, and both times we've loved everything we ordered. The prosciutto is a MUST. It ranks up there as one of the best I've ever had. They slice it right before they serve it, so its super fresh, light, salty and amazing. One order comes with ~7 slices, so its perfect to share. Can't go wrong with any of the pastas - carbonara, bucatini, ricotta gnocchi - all perfectly cooked, and very flavorful. Last time we also opted for the pork porterhouse, which was the dish of the night. It was so juicy and flavorful, and served with some crunchy spring veggies. We also had the broccoli rabe, which I loved as it is served with some bianco sardo cheese which is slightly melted and adds a great flavor to cut the bitterness of the greens. If you're two, I think the best play is to get 1 app, 2 pastas, and 1 main to share. We ended with the tartufo, which is a ball of hazelnut gelato awesomeness, covered in a chocolate shell. It is delicious. Wine by the glass comes in a carafe, so while each glass seems pricey, you're getting 1.5 glasses per order. Unless you have a reservation, be prepared to wait a while.

Everything was superb, even the mushroom salad that I was hesitant about was absolutely amazing.For the pasta dish, the special for the day was pea pasta... what the heck, it was so good even though I hate peas - they really pureed and seasoned it so well it worked fantastically as a pasta dish. The Duck Ragu was absolutely wonderful and flavorful.For entree we got lamb chops.. cooked to perfection. The salmon fish with crispy skin was yummy. As a side we had roasted asparagus and curried cauliflowers. I don't know what they used as seasoning, but this was like crack!!One of our dessert was a cheese platter which I don't really care for.

4.0,2/25/2014,"Italian cuisine has never been one of my strong points. But when a last-minute dinner reservation opened up over the weekend, I decided to give this much-praised Batali and Bastianich establishment a try. Lupa is named in honor of the female wolf who, according to Roman mythology, nurtured the twins Romulus and Remus after they were abandoned; the former brother eventually became the founder of Rome.Located in the midst of Greenwich Village on the corner of Bleeker Street, Lupa required a bit of a trek since there had been a considerable amount of snowfall the evening before. Nonetheless, we entered what I'd imagine a trattoria to be: a bustling restaurant and bar area with high walls and a pervasively orange glow, wines and liquor enclosed in the arched brick walls, and a multitude of tables snugly placed to each other. Although our table wasn't ready until nearly half an hour after our set reservation time, our hostess handled the situation with grace; she apologized for the hold up several times and offered each of us a glass of prosecco while we waited.We were finally seated in the second dining area and were given menus for the night. The task of choosing the dishes for the night was quite a feat as Lupa offers a variety of antipasti, salumi, pasta, and entrees, but after some debate, we settled on a pasta to share as well as our own entrees. Once our orders were taken, a serving of some of the softest bread flecked with rosemary was brought to our table with olive oil; it was so good, I had to sheepishly ask our waiter for a second plate.The kitchen had been considerate enough to split our pasta dish for us, and each of us received an elegantly plated bowl of the Spaghetti con Pomodoro. In all honesty, I wanted to dislike this simple dish; I'd had it ingrained in my mind for so long that Italian cuisine, especially the basic pastas, was overpriced at a point that didn't justify its ingredients or preparation. In hindsight, I can say that Lupa shattered that pretense for me. The pasta was evidently made in-house, each strand at the perfect just past al dente texture with a distinct chew. The pomodoro sauce was refreshing and light, with slight punches of acidity that layered perfectly with the savory undertones. Despite my best attempts at making it last, I was soon staring at an empty bowl and wishing for more.Thankfully, our main courses followed shortly afterwards. As pork belly is one of my greatest weaknesses, I couldn't help but order Lupa's rendition. I was presented with two portions of pork belly, served with slices of pears and scorzonera. I will remember this pork belly far, far into the future - perfectly braised and seared, it was a decadent, fatty portion of meat that brought joy with each bite and taste. Though the pairing of pears and scorzonera threw me off a bit, the contrast of soft against crunchy, savory against sweet, was thoughtful and well-balanced. Although the portion appeared small at first glance, it was a surprisingly filling dish.It was impossible to finish off the meal without ordering Lupa's signature dessert, the Lupa Tartufo. A generous serving of hazelnut gelato is encased in a chocolate shell, sprinkled with crushed biscotti cookies, and served with warm dark chocolate syrup. Although my preferences lies with lighter, fruitier desserts, I was not disappointed with the tartufo; nutty, not overly sweet, and with all dimensions of texture, each spoonful was a surprise of pure decadence. The final treat was a single cherry in the center of the gelato, which I sheepishly took for my final bite.In hindsight, my meal at Lupa was one of the most satisfying that I can remember. The array of flavors and textures will hold your attention throughout the course of the meal, and each dish shows an evident amount of thought and care. The service at Lupa is also commendable; our servers and waiters that evening were professional and amicable, and were able to immediately address any concerns or requests we had despite the full house that evening. We walked out of the dining room completely content; and for myself, I admit that Lupa has made a convert out of me. Italian food? Let's go.",14,6,10,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

I've never had gnocchi with such marshmallow-like textures. I definitely enjoyed it.Saltimbocca - Not what I expected. It was like a meat pancake or meat frittata. It came as a large circular, flat piece of mixed meat. I wasn't a fan.Tartufo - Huge ball of ice cream covered in chocolate, on top of hazelnut-chocolate syrup.It's very rich and tastes like frozen Nutella.

Everything I ate, from the prosciutto to the salad to the cacio e pepe to the ricotta and honey and everything in between was perfect. Waiter made some great recommendations which helped, forgot his name but taller gentleman with a foreign first name dark hair. Excellent waiter. I'll certainly be a regular at this place because of his recommendations and the quality of the food. Also to try the chef's tasting menu. All in all spent about $160 between my mom and I, without drinks. For that price, it was well worth it.

4.0,2/15/2014,"With superb pasta and a truly outstanding selection of salume, Lupa is one of the better Italian restaurants near Washington Square Park. While the food is certainly excellent, the customers here are packed in to an almost uncomfortable proximity and dessert is decidedly an afterthought. However, if having elbow room and good dessert is not on your 'must' list for restaurants, definitely head here for a great dinner. I have probably eaten at Lupa about six times and each time was very good. As for pasta, the Ricotto Gnocchi is probably the best, closely followed by the Carbonara. For secondi I have to recommend the Pollo Alla Diavola. It is peppery, comes with a great jus, and has this piece of bread with chicken liver spread on it that alone makes the dish worth ordering.As for the salumi (or ""carne"" as it appears on the menu) there is only one way to go: the house-made Coppa Cotta!! Oh man. So, so, so awesome.Unless you are lucky enough to be seated in the back room, get ready for one loud, cramped, and fairly dark dinner. I am aware this is an Osteria-style restaurant, so I guess that is part of the Romanesque atmosphere.Anyway, don't bother with dessert. They are all pretty mediocre. Kee's Chocolates and Dominique Ansel are both walking distance, however, so the dessert issue is not really a problem. If you go to Kee's for dessert try the creme brulee truffles and if you go to Dominique try the wwayyyyy underrated Frozen Smores.Anyway Lupa is awesome. While Babbo and Scarpetta might be more solid five-star locations, for the price it is difficult to do much better.",3,0,0,Paul A.,"New York, NY",270,403,462
5.0,2/9/2014,"Worked with Jay the manager on getting a reservation for 8 for my wife's 25th (+15yrs experience) birthday.  They were technically booked, but he was able to manage a table for us at 8:30.  Given our group size of 8, we had to dine via Prixe Fixe, which I am usually not a big fan of.  However, working with Annamarie was smooth and I found her to be particularly accommodating.  We chose the 85 prixe fixe, because my wife and I analyzed the photos of the dishes and honestly, felt that we weren't going to have enough food, so figured we'd go the $85 per person route to ""get a tad more"" than the $75 price fixe.  We get there, it's got a nice buzz, but very crowded bar.  Seated closer to 9pm, but totally understandable as it was clearly a busy night.  Definitely recommend the back room (less busy and loud than the front of the room).  As for the food? WAY more than I expected and probably could have (or maybe should have) fed 12 people EASILY.  I was also a tad put off that the menu didn't have more options to choose from, but at the end of the night, the food was exactly what we wanted.  Salad, salami, appetizers were very well made and delicious.  We had the cacio pepe and the skate broccoli rabe, both of which I would highly recommend.  By the time we got to the Main course of the fish and pork belly, we were all stuffed.  The fish was very well made (cooked perfectly) and the pork belly... mmmmm.... pork belly.  So, overall, way over the top, great food and we doggie bagged much of it (great as leftovers on the Sunday).  Definitely will be back again.  Cheers!",0,0,0,Ny L.,"Rye, NY",0,14,2

4.0,2/6/2014,"KenScale: 8.0/10Lupa is one of many Italian restaurants from the acclaimed chef Mario Batali featuring Roman dishes near the NYU area in Greenwich Village. It's been beloved by New Yorkers (and tourists) for a long time as a great casual Italian dinner option. I've been to this place multiple times since I came over to the city, and recently went for another visit. While the food here is not perfect, most of them are pretty solid and I really liked the casual and youthful vibe. For appetizers, I highly recommend the salumi which you can order in different portions. I really liked the variety of flavors and textures from each of the salumi dishes that were pretty easy to share. Sardines with golden raisins and pinenuts were also a light and refreshing dish that can start your meal in the right way. Lupa has been known for its prowess in pastas, but unfortunately these dishes are by no means perfect. I found Bavette Cacio & Pepe a bit too salty and Spaghetti Alla Carbonara a bit too creamy to my preference. On the other hand, I really liked the spicy edge of Bucatini All' Amatriciana that worked very well with the above-average texture of the pasta noodle. For dessert, a simple dish such as raspberry sorbetto would be ideal after going heavy with pasta dishes. The restaurant has an extensive wine menu (with generous carafe portion even if you order wine by the ""glass""). It's still hard to get dinner reservations here, especially during weekends. The restaurant was packed when I visited for Sunday dinner. On the other hand, it is relatively easy to get a seat during lunch time. With the kind of vibe and the proximity to Washington Square Park that you can stroll around when the weather is not too cold, Lupa can be a great weekend neighborhood brunch option. With the not-too-stuffy atmosphere and solid dishes at reasonable price range, Lupa can be a great first date venue as well. I wouldn't put the restaurant on the rank of the greatest Italian restaurants, but it is the type of can't-go-wrong restaurant that you can visit every once in a while.",4,2,3,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,612,4738

It was super greasy from all the fat but the meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender. It was cooked perfectly and the side of potatoes and leeks was nice.Also tried:1. Rigatoni w/skate and broccoli: This was nice. It was light yet flavored just enough. Pasta was cooked al dente to perfection. 2. Spaghetti Alla Carbonara: Once again, really good. Everything was there to make it a great carbonara.3. Ricotta Gnocchi With Sausage & Fennel: Gnocchi was superb, as expected. It came with a red sauce which was also very nice.4. Side of parsnips: Never really had parsnips before but these were a little tough. Maybe undercooked? Not sure but we didn't really like it.Service was quite good.

4.0,1/23/2014,"Their Bavette Cacio & Pepe is delicious. It's like aged liquid cheese penetrating your tongue and the back of your throat -- but you like the abuse.An old Italian neighbor once told me, ""If the pasta ain't al dente, you're eating at the Olive Garden"". He was so right, because I was eating at Lupa. Lupa offers a bit more than just pasta. Try their Braised Oxtails with Gnocchi Alla Romana. Oxtail can be done horribly, but they make it horribly irresistible. And you can never go wrong with decorating your mouth-watering oxtail with a few drops of gnocchi. It's so good that if you replaced the oxtail with horse sh*t, you might mistake it for braised lamb.

Sometimes I have lunch instead, if dinner plans are not possible.I had the fortunate occasion to be here during one of the nicest weeks in the season (highs in the 50s in early December, I'll take it!). I was meant to be dining here with a friend and made a booking for 2, but he flaked on me due to work. They did not bat an eye when I showed up solo for my table. Yes, as others have said, the service here is unfailingly polite. My server was prompt and never huffed at my being a solo diner; in fact, my meal felt anything but rushed. I had my go-to favorite (bavette cacio e pepe). That and a salad are usually enough to get me through but since I was alone, and therefore free of judgement for gorging myself, I opted to order a main course as well. I tried the octopus with lentils.The bavette was just as I remember - subtly creamy, peppery. Salty, definitely salty. But dammit so delicious. The octopus, on the other hand, was simply out of this world. As tender and flavorful as you can possibly imagine. Beautiful flavors and texture. The lentils paired with it were sort of soapy and mushy but can be overlooked.I finished with the pistachio torta and that was the most disappointing element of the meal. Gritty and mealy, with no defined flavor profile other than olive oil. I would not recommend this dish to anyone.All in all, it's earned another notch in my belt and definitely worthy of a return trip again.

But that's perfectly fine with us!Anyway, I love the intimacy of this restaurant. Dimly lit. Great for dates. It has that rustic romantic feel. And not too loud either. PERFECT.We shared the selection of meats as our appetizer. If you're a prosciutto fan, this is a must. If you're adventurous, try the slice of brains that they had in that selection. Personally, the foodie in me couldn't do it but bravo to those that can!The must get on the menu? Ricotta gnocchi for the win! They're like soft pillows waiting to burst in your mouth. Imagine little clouds swimming in a tomato-based sausage sauce waiting to be eaten. Sooooo delicious!And of course, I had to go with the panna cotta for dessert. Its texture was soft yet firm - cultivated for the perfect fit. And to be topped with cherries? mMmm good!",1,2,1,Olivia S.,"New York, NY",656,607,1036
3.0,10/26/2013,"Good, but not outrageously so - it was worth going once, but with all the other restaurants to choose from, I don't think I'd make a point of going back. It was packed and we ended up eating at the bar, which we particularly like because we can A) actually hear each other and B) usually get great service than if we were at a table. Points there - nice bar, great bartender, generous pours, very good wine selection. Our first courses came out: I had the arugula and Tuscan kale salad with apple, shaved Parmesan, and a warm guanciale dressing - it was really fantastic. I don't remember what my wife had. Our second courses were surprisingly kind of disappointing - both were clearly rushed: way too undercooked (don't tell me about al dente, people - I know what al dente is and this was not it - rather, it was about 30 seconds from uncooked. In fact, I half expected it to crunch). My wife had the cacio e pepe, which had much too much sauce. It was good but not great. I had the bucatini, which tasted good, but again, raw-ish pasta. We soldiered on through some of it because we were hungry, but couldn't get the job done. I want to note the atmosphere. It has most of the makings of a ""favorite neighborhood hot spot""m but the food is a bit meh, in my opinion. I had better pasta at another Batali joint, the mega-eating emporium Eataly, under fluorescents. I expected the cozy, bustling-ness of Lupa to take that pasta to the next level, and it just didn't. Too bad. (Thankfully, we got to have Italian do-over the next day - see my review of Osteria Morini).",0,0,0,Andrea S.,"Boston, MA",17,16,3
4.0,10/25/2013,"What is it with places and really dark lighting? I totally get that it's to set the mood and make things more intimate, but you'd need night vision goggles to traverse through this place.Anyways, random thought aside, Lupa is one of many in Mario Batali's chain of restaurants across NY. My friend and I came here for our 6:45 reservation, got seated 10 minutes after, and got our menus immediately.Our waiter was an extremely friendly and bubbly man. He took our drink orders and immediately launched into a full on explanation of the entire menu. From the way he described each dish, you could tell how passionate he was about his job, a rare occurrence these days.We ended up going with the tasting menu because we couldn't decide what to get. Our drinks were brought out promptly, with my Vulcan and my friend's Riesling. Her Riesling was delicious, as it was both fruity and refreshing. My Vulcan was interesting, as it was a rum-based (if I recall correctly) cocktail with traces of jalapeno, giving it a kick. It was definitely unique, but not really my jam.Anyways, our tasting menu consisted of 6 courses, but really, it was more like 10, because their appetizers had multiple dishes. This is probably the only tasting menu I've had where I was full afterwards. And by full, I mean full full. In terms of taste, the food was alright. Nothing really stood out all that much to be honest, except for our dessert, which was amazing. My favorites from the tasting menu were their ravioli (creamy, buttery, cheesy goodness), smoked whitefish (loved the smoky crispy skin) and the dessert, which was a vanilla gelato encrusted in a soft shell of chocolate laid over chocolate hazelnut drippings.The food might not have been the best I've ever had, but you definitely get a bang for your buck when it comes to quantity. That being said, I'd suggest their individual menu items (like the pork belly and duck breast) over the tasting menu.",1,1,1,Peter Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",656,636,415
4.0,10/25/2013,"My friend and I had reservations to this restaurant for dinner at 6:45 PM last night. We had to wait a while for our table despite our reservation... but that didn't bother us all that much. The place is a very cozy small restaurant and extremely dim lit. The noise level I'd say fluctuated but was a little louder than what I wanted it to be.We decided to be adventurous and try the 6 course tasting menu ($60 per person - which is not too bad for a tasting menu). I think I underestimated the amount of food that was going to come our way. Regardless, the tasting menu was a good idea because it was our first time at this restaurant and we wanted to get an overall feel for this restaurant's food. The tasting menu took us 2 full hours to complete but with good company, the time is always well spent. The service was excellent! The waiter always came by after each dish was served to tell us about the dish and the ingredients. He was very nice and personable. Overall the food that came out for the tasting menu was good. If I recall correctly, some of the dishes that came out were:- Clams & Fregola - Marinated Funghi & Farro- Misticanza alla Romana- Prosciutto Di Parma (I think this was very standard)- Heritage Pork Belly with Spring Onion & Pickled Peaches (very chewy and hard to cut with a knife but the taste was good nonetheless)- Market Fish with Salsa Rossa & Sweet Corn (fish was delicious)Then the desserts came:- Biscotti (had an interesting spice to it)- Lupa Tartufo (this was my favorite dessert, I recommend this! It's a nice combination of gelato and hazelnut chocolate sauce)- Formaggi (ricotta with honey was excellent!)Although I enjoyed Lupa's tasting menu as an introductory meal overall... now that I've had it once I don't know that I would order it again.

4.0,10/16/2013,"Was in a bind for an anniversary dinner after getting screwed by Blue Hill and striking out for a reservation at Babbo and Del Posto. Was a little nervous to book an osteria for a fancy occasion, but the Roman-specific menu (our favorite subdivision of Italian cuisine) won me over, so I gave it a shot. So glad I did. The atmosphere for dinner was informal but sumptuous. Note: there was MAJOR ConEd construction happening on the street right outside the restaurant. Upon entering and closing the door behind us, the noise was gone. Sign of great forethought in design on the part of the owners. The menu was seasonally appropriate and casually impressive in the way only great chefs can pull off. Good Ligurian rossesse wine and Lazio-style octopus with lentils, pork belly with apples, and cappallacci filled with seasonal parsnip and squash. The standout upon walking away, however, was the expert-level service we received. Our primary server was knowledgeable, helpful, exactly chatty enough, but otherwise striking the perfect balance of stealth, timing, and attentiveness. Even the busboys were like unobtrusive ninjas anticipating our needs. It may be an ""osteria"", but this was ""ristorante"" level service. Whoever is hiring and training Batali's servers knows what's up.Final note: spring for the house-made limoncello with dessert.

The bucatini was over cooked and not properly seasoned, wound up sending it back...it tasted burnt!  Replaced with the gnocchi which was good, but I've had better. All the portions are very small, so don't expect to get full unless you ate prior.

It's like ravioli with a creamy squash center and some crispy deliciousness on top. For entree, my boyfriend and I shared the market fish. It was  a wild striped bass which was tasty but small. For dessert, we shared the tartufo which tasted like a frozen ferrero rocher chocolate- very good! I would definitely come back and sample the other pastas.

5.0,9/10/2013,"My fiancee and one of her friends had a joint birthday dinner here recently, so we had the privilege of coming here and having a prix fixe five-course dinner. The service here was pretty solid, even for a big group - our waiter was very straightforward in describing what was on the menu, and he was very good about knowing what every menu was on the item and describing it. The sommelier gave us pretty solid advice on the wines - they didn't end up overpowering all the pasta and other food we downed. Although the beer selection isn't huge, I did like the different kinds they had. In particular, I was a fan of the Extra ReAle IPA - slightly fruity overtones, with the usual hoppiness (but not overly so) of an IPA lurking at the back.As for the food - first, it ended  up being way more than I had thought it would be. The first course was basically an assault of appetizers - it's hard to remember what all we had, although I do remember really liking the prosciutto that came out  - much heartier and fuller of flavor than a lot of other prosciuttos that I've had a chance to experience. The speck panini was also delicious - a rich middle between well-toasted pieces of bread that seemed akin to brioche. There were other appetizers as well, but some of them (mixed green salad, whitefish with celery and olives) weren't particularly memorable. The next couple of courses were pasta dishes, both of which were phenomenal. The first was simple yet delicious - pennette with a couple of classic cheeses (pecorino and parmigiano) and freshly ground pepper. The pasta was cooked really well - not anywhere near as soft as most places, but not too undercooked such that it tasted like raw pasta. If anything, it came off as a tad salty, but I would eat this as a dish anytime, even though the amount of ingredients is minimal. Next was the pork agnolotti with truffle butter, which was stupendously delicious. Truffle's one of my favorite flavors, and mixing it in with small pasta pieces filled with succulent pork is a fantastic combo. For the entree, I went with the offering of pork belly, which was about as fatty a piece I've ever had - so delicious. The cheese selection was good, with a decent mix of soft and harder cheeses - but nothing that I wouldn't have had at other places that include cheese in their tastings. Dessert was a tale of two choices - the tartufo was absolutely delicious, with the chocolate ice cream with hints of coffee encased in a real nutty hazelnut shell. The panna cotta, though, was disappointing - very plain on its own, with some blueberries on top. It stood out as a bit spartan relative to the rest of dinner.In all, though, it's hard to top the entrees that we had hear. All of the pasta was really well-done, with simpler dishes and more complex ones done equally well. Although a few things (some of the appetizers, the panna cotta) were a bit forgetful, the overall quality of the dishes that were done well was so high that it overcomes a couple of blemishes. It's got a nice vibe to it - particularly when the windows are open in the evening - and I'd definitely come back again to sample some of the delicious Italian food (traditional and thematically inspired) that is served up here at Lupa.",1,0,0,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

5.0,8/12/2013,"I love all things Mario Batali so it came as no surprise that Lupa would surely impress. The great thing about Lupa is that the full menu is available Mon-Sun from open to close. So if there is something you really want from the menu you can get it at any time which I appreciate. No working your schedule around when to come here.I came for lunch on a Saturday and it was a nice relaxing experience. I imagine dinner is much more crowded and hectic of course. They start you with delicious focaccia and olive oil. The menu seemingly changes with the seasons, and on this day I had the following:Mezze rigatoni with skate and broccoli rabe- These are half size rigatoni with some finely chopped broccoli rabe, shredded skate, pignoli nuts and what tasted like some celery, and some toasted bread crumbs. The portion is deceivingly large, yet light since it isn't doused with a heavy sauce and was basically just a garlic and oil type sauce. Pasta is cooked nicely al dente, usually to the extreme side as in most Batali spots. When getting all the flavors together, this is a wonderful comforting bowl of pasta. A little bitterness from the broccoli rabe, crunchiness and nuttiness from the pignoli nuts and toasted breadcrumbs, and of course the soft luscious skate throughout. I know cheese and fish is a big no no, but I would have loved some here. My only critique is a bit more skate, but obviously the main event here is the pasta and they want to make that shine here.Next was one of the better things I've had recently. Rarely do you see pork belly as a main these days, but Lupa is serving it paired with pickled peaches and scornozera (caramelized black salisfy). What came out was two thick logs of fatty, juicy, soft, pull apart pork belly goodness. No knige needed. No teeth needed really. The richness was cut by the sweet peaches and the caramelized salsify tasted like a sweet onion. A very generous portion indeed and after the pasta definitely more than enough. This was easily one of the best pork belly dishes I have ever eaten, which is high praise coming from me considering my intake of the fatty delicacy.

We were expecting exactly that - a nice meal.  What we got instead was a gorgeous one.We started off with some cocktails.  I had the Sardinian Iced Tea.  SO refreshing and light on a hot Saturday afternoon!  I then moved onto a rose and then a beer from Piedmont.My husband and I shared the clams and fregola and ordered two meats - proscuitto and coppa cotta.  The proscuitto melted in our mouths.  There was hardly a reason to chew.  The coppy had such complexities of flavors that you had to take a second bite to fully understand all of them.  Great. Great. Great.The clams and fregola were a nice bright contrast to the salty meats.  The clams were so meaty and there was an abundance of them and the fregola added some nice texture to the dish.For primi, I had the pasta special, tagliatelle with duck and sausage and my husband ordered the solid bucatini.  Both were delicious.  My husband mentioned that the bucatini was a bit more saucier than it is at Otto but both places have fantastic pasta.  My dish was nice and salty with savory duck pieces.  Simple and delicious.For the entree (I realized soon enough that it wasn't even necessary to order one) I had the mackrel and my husband had the pork porterhouse.  Both were so delicious but I could not have any more food so I only ate half of my entree.  I had heard great things about the tartufo (my favorite dessert of all time) so I could not live with myself if I left too stuffed to even try it.Get the tartufo.  It is big enough for two to share and it comes on a bed of melted chocolate/ganache with bits of almond sprinkled around it.  It was gone in a flash.We ended our meal with some limoncello and we were off.  Gorgeous meal.Our service was great too.  From our drink orders to our water glasses being filled, I think everyone was being very attentive.If only we could eat like this every weekend!",0,0,0,Kane K.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,72,0
5.0,7/22/2013,"I took my girlfriend out for a birthday dinner date night. I called 2 weeks in advance and got my requested 8:30 Friday night reservation unlike Babbo which is requires 30 days in advance for prime time.The night started with cocktails at the bar as we arrived early for our reservation. I had the il Diavolo and my girlfriend had a tito's gimlet, both crafted exquisitely and added to the table, no starting a tab and closing out separately at the bar nonsense.  We opted for the extremely reasonable $60, six course tasting menu because so many of the dishes sounded amazing. As a note, It is required if you want the tasting menu that each person have it, and they can do a vegetarian version, not for us, overheard from the next table. The wine list is varied and also reasonably priced with a bunch of great bottles under $45. The real highlights of the meal were the pasta course which was the special with duck, the main course, duck breast was also great, the market fish was a white fish but i forget which one, very smokey and flavorful. The cheese plate came with 2 cheeses, a hard cheese that i loved and a bleu cheese which i am not a fan of but sure was equally great. The desert was Lupa Tartufo which ended the meal on an amazing high.

4.0,6/22/2013,"One of the advantages of being a consistently voracious eater is internalizing the regional distinctions of certain nations' cuisines, so that when someone asks whether you want Italian, you can respond with ""What kind?""The good kind is a great start, but a close second to that is Roman: rich, simple, and seasonal. Give me a lovely cacio e pepe with nothing to hide over some tomato-dripping, cheese-stuffed lasagne any day....Pecorino, shell beans, greens, fatty pork, and spice carve out a beautiful place in the Italian universe.Initially skeptical at the possibility for, well, celebrity chef-ness in an unwelcome way at a Batali/Bastianich spot, I was pleasantly surprised to find Lupa sleek but welcoming and well-priced. Plenty of antipasti mightily tempt, as do seasonal specials (what I ended up ordering) such as bucatini with Pecorino, greens, and lemon. My dish was perfectly al dente, with a beautiful mix of citrus, bitterness, and salty cheese. I nibbled on my friend's sardine antipasti and felt just the smallest twinge of food envy as I savored each sea-infused bite of fish and vegetables. The three of us had no reservation and were coming straight from a full day of yoga teacher training (so not quite the dressed demographic B&B might be hoping for), but service was impeccable! Our waiter Joel took excellent care of us, and made an already special night even better with a little round of moscato to celebrate my belated birthday.Let me also say I loved my very first aperol spritzer, and it won't be the last....There are big names lurking everywhere within Lupa, but the menu is suffused with creativity, seasonality, and precision in a fully dependable manner.

5.0,5/19/2013,"Not to be dramatic or anything... but best meal of my life.This was a graduation dinner for my brother finishing law school and this meal was meant to make him forget how miserable his life will be for the next 40+ years; or something like that.  The food was so good that there were almost no insults between members of my family (almost).  We were a party of 6 and sat in the back room which seemed to be less hectic and more spacious than the front room.  I was able to try all of the following.  I'll put stars around the dishes that I thought were super, super amazing.  Everything else was only regular amazing. Appetizers* Escarole, Walnut, Red Onion & Pecorino - Delicious salad but has a ton of cheese on top (in case you're ordering to be healthy).  The walnuts are seemingly toasted and were super nutty and delicious.* Choice of 3 cheese (off the dessert menu but we ordered as an app) - We got two portions of the Ricotta with Honey because my bother loves it and gets it everytime he comes and one portion of the Bianco Sardo.  The cheeses are served on a thin, long platter.  The ricotta is super soft and comes in small baseball sized mounds.  The honey is drizzled on top.  The ricotta has a better texture than the store bought stuff but doesn't taste all that different to me.  The Bianco Sardo is a hard cheese similar to pecorino romano.  It was very, very delicious, unique and extremely tasty if you're into hard cheese.  For me, I could have lived without the cheeses and perhaps swapped it for something else on the menu.Primi (all the primi pastas we had were pretty good portions; you may be able to get away with apps and a primo as a full meal... but on the other hand - why risk it?)* ***Bucatini All' Amatriciana*** - Phenomenal.  This is a thick spaghetti with a spicy red sauce.  It's about as good as a red sauce can get.  Pasta obviously cooked perfectly.* ***Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage & Fennel*** - Amazing.  Super light ricotta gnocchi. Excellent bits of sausage.  Also in a delicious tomato based sauce.  The sausage has more of a black pepper taste than other sausages I've eaten (but was still subtle and not overwhelming) in case you don't care for black pepper.* ***Spaghetti alla Carbonara*** - Heavy and indulgent like Carbonara is supposed to be.  The cuts of meat  weren't a bacon or pancetta but closer to a super tasty, crispy pork (possibly from the other ""Heritage Pork"" dishes(?)).  The cheese sauce was good and they gave a perfect amount.  The pasta was not swimming in the sauce.  I loved it.Secondi* ***Heritage Pork Porterhouse*** - (Available on Saturday only) - I have no idea how they could get a pork chop to be so tasty.  When you cut into the thicker than normal chop, you see how incredibly juicy and moist it is.  The herbs and carmelized shallots(?) on top were fantastic as well.  If you get weirded out when your pork isn't cooked to a grey color, then ask for them to make it well done.  The waitress mentioned that it is cooked medium and it was definitely pink and even reddish in parts - but I was fine with that.* Market Fish - Striped Bass - Quite good but the portion might have been a bit small.  Still fantastic; but not oh-my-god-i've-never-tasted-anything-like-that-i-don't-know-how-to-react fantastic.* Saltimbocca - This was the only thing here that I wasn't crazy about.  It's a flattened veal cutlet, wrapped in prosciutto and shaped like a pancake.  The taste vaguely reminded me of breakfast sausage and I wasn't crazy about the texture.  The portion size was huge but wouldn't recommend this dish with all of the other superior options.Desserts* ***Lupa Tartufo*** - Do yourself a favor and get this.  A ball of vanilla gelato with a chocolate shell and crushed hazelnuts on the outside.  It's served over a chocolate syrup with more hazelnuts.  Just the most amazing dessert I've possibly ever had.* Sorbetto / Gelato del Giorno - We got the lemon sorbetto and the chocolate gelato.  They were both great, but don't tempt fate and miss out on the tartufo.",4,0,1,Michael S.,"New York, NY",6,66,23

4.0,4/29/2013,"Graced with a generous gift card for some collective catering my family did for family-like friends a while back, I've had the good fortune to be able to return numerous times to Lupa over the past couple of years.  While I typically nook into the end of the bar for leisurely nibbling, sipping and crowd watching (for there is always a crowd), I recently sat at a table for two for a late lunch.  For each of the visits, I've relied heavily on the suggestion of the waitstaff, and I haven't been steered wrong yet.  I typically describe what I'd like to be drinking, share what I've had previously, suggesting it would be silly to repeat with the rich options available and let the quartinos be chosen for me.  The only repeated food item I've had is the fried brussel sprouts.  Get them for your table, or bar nook.  Specials are frequently suggested, which has warranted me delicate mushroom trios which delighted my mouth with a subtle earthiness punched up with a clean toss through olive oil (and I'm not really a mushroom fan, but if you ask for suggestions, you have a certain obligation to accept them!), duck, both confit, and as a ragu another time, and a delicate portion of arctic char over a brightly colored, al dente medley of spring vegetables. Equally delicious and homey are elements from the daily menu: pastas... I've had several, and the meat platter, which I like making into a meat AND cheese experience... which does cause the server to have to go fetch the dessert menu, as cheese aren't on the primary menu.  Service is ever warm, unpretentious and gracious.  While very accommodating, there is frequently a wait for tables, and in this small venue, it can lead to the bar becoming crowded and cramped.  I'm grateful that the gift card has allowed me to get to know this comfortable little nook of a place, though when it runs out, I may be seen less frequently.  It is a bit overpriced for what you get in quantity, but the quality and freshness are always worthy elements.  Much more comfortable a space for smaller parties, I'd suggest larger parties look elsewhere.",0,0,0,Kathleen C.,"Bethel, NY",0,4,0

4.0,4/15/2013,"This place serves up the fattiest, and ergo, best pork belly I have ever had. The serving size was tiny. I mean, at first glance, I felt insulted that they would charge me $24 for two pet-sized pieces of pork belly. Then, I took a bite. O-SHIT. I don't think I even had to chew. It just melted in my mouth and left the pure taste of nirvana. I've never had pork belly this tender and flavorful. I don't know what they're doing to the pigs these came from, but carry on, good farmer. The pear was warm and sweet with a slight crunch. The scorzonera, which I later found out is a root vegetable, tasted fine, but I don't really recall anything about it specifically. I tried some of the pasta my friends had. It was perfectly al dente. All the sauces were fantastic. Most were initially subtle but left a complex, and thoroughly enjoyable, aftertaste.I had a bit of the bone marrow. It was pure fat and bliss, a dietitian's nightmare, and therefore, my personal ecstasy.I had heard much about this dessert called the Tartufo. It is described by some as being a large Ferrero Roche. So, of course, I ordered it. The ball of gelato was quite large, easily feeding two people. The consistency, however, was bit harder than I would have liked. They most likely took it straight from the freezer. The nutty chocolate sauce underneath served to warm it up a bit. It was a decadent dessert that did indeed taste just like a Ferrero Roche, which, for me at least, was a plus.The service was fine. Nothing to write home about, but generally up to par with a restaurant of this caliber.The prices were pretty high. I ended up spending $40 on two pieces of pork belly and a ball of gelato, and while they were both very good, I could think of a hundred other places in this city where I could eat for $40 and come away feeling just as, if not more satisfied.

Wednesday night I met two of my best friends at this restaurant which was selected by one of those friends who is in the food industry in Manhattan and has a highly discriminating palate. This is one of her favorites. We had a fabulous bottle of wine recommended by the bartender. The pasta was possibly the best I have ever had. Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and gluten free option for the celiac among us. The salad with squash, ricotta , greens and the house cured meat was divine. My girlfriends had the beets in pistachios and loved it. The tartufo is everything and more that has been reported in Yelp. It was a fun scene, very hip, very New York, we had a blast plus had amazing food.Couldn't WAIT to bring my husband and daughter there for dinner Friday night! We had a reservation and were seated right away in one of those tables meant for two people and all 3 of us are large people- I'm 5'10, my husband 6 feet! I felt like I was sitting at a child's table and we were all cramped and uncomfortable. Didn't mind the close proximity to other diners but the MUSIC! What was that? It was an assault! Some kind of weird piercing rock music. Dreadful! Unfortunately the kitchen really screwed up our food order and we had to wait forever for our food. They offered us a glass of wine to compensate but we were already drinking a bottle and really were starving. Unfortunately then the food came all at once.(apps, pasta, primi-there wasn't room on the small table!)

I'm used to them being at least 5x the size.Trust, I know it sounds absurb, but I'm not joking at all when I say this dish tasted EXACTLY like Kraft Macaroni before you add the cheese powder (with the addition of little chunks of sweet potato) I'm not hating, I promise, I love some boxed mac n cheese every once in awhile. For goodness sake, as a lifelong vegetarian, with red-meat and potato eating parents and friends parents who didn't know what else to feed me, Kraft mac was a staple of my childhood. The noodles were essentially soggy over-cooked Kraft noodles in a pool of melted butter. I enjoyed sweet potato (as opposed to powdered cheese) flavor. I just prefer the $2 price tag, to the $20 here. Got the Tarfuto for dessert, and loved it! Really delicious. Didn't love the taste of the dried fruit bits inside, but they were easily avoidable.

3.0,3/19/2013,"Came here for an early dinner with two other people.  I hadn't been to Lupa in awhile, but I had read some reviews saying that one could skip the ""Secondi"" section of the menu altogether, and still leave satisfied.We shared the escarole salad and the hot coppa to start.  The former was beautiful in its display, but a little bland to taste.  It needed a bit of salt and pepper, but we were not offered any.  The latter dish was tasty, but definitely a strange combination of textures.  We also shared a side order of brussels sprouts, which were crispy, spicy, and great.Each diner got their own ""Primi"" dish: Two orders of the carbonara, and one cacio & pepe.  All simple dishes, and all well executed.  The pastas were cooked to a perfect al dente, and tossed very well with their respective sauces and seasoning.For dessert, we shared a tartufo and an apple and chestnut torta.  The tartufo was perfect, though difficult to share due to its shape and size.  The torta was a huge disappointment, as the cherries served with it were overly sweet, and made the cake soggy.  The dish could use some adjusting, also maybe some gelato.I would return, but only if someone else was paying for me again.  The prices, although not bad for this area of Manhattan, are still a little steep for what you get.  Additionally, the wait staff are kind, but not incredibly smooth.  The music selection was very, very strange--Unless of course you like disco with your Italian food.  The ambiance is strangely formal at times, though the restaurant itself exudes a flatly casual air.",0,0,0,Helen L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,20,6
4.0,3/18/2013,"decided to spend one of my last night's in the city here! We made reservations at 6:30 and were promptly seated once we arrived. the menu is mostly in italian and is very difficult to decipher (even with the glossary of terms on the back of the menu). in any case, our kind waiter took the time to explain most of the items on the menu, which made the choosing part a lot easier!here's a look at our selection:3/5: Sardines, Golden Raisins & Pinenuts $12 - i wasn't a fan of the sardine taste though i LOVED the dressing they had with the raisins and pinenuts. Others at the table enjoyed the dish.3.5/5: Bucatini All' Amatriciana  $16 - a little too al dente for my taste, but the thick, spiced tomato sauce was very good.4/5: Sagne a Pezzi with Cauliflower & Ceci  $18 - this had a strong cauliflower taste that was good. very interesting, though certainly enjoyable. 4.5/5: Pollo alla Diavola  $20 - a seasoned, large chicken breast piece that i would recommend splitting with others in addition to pasta dishes (since its ONLY meat). flavor was great!5/5: Bavette Cacio & Pepe  $15 - the STAR of the night and will single-handedly bring me back! just a simple linguine with salt and pepper and olive oil. it was DIVINE!!!!! love love love!!!!so overall, a cozy and quaint place. some of the dishes were mediocre but if i do come back, i know exactly what i'll be getting!",2,0,1,Asmita J.,"Philadelphia, PA",235,567,2

Can you come in at this time? Can you be done with the table in two hours? Just say, ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"" and quite possibly you will find yourself dining at one of the better Italian restaurants in the City.Up until yesterday, I have never heard of Lupa. I had no idea it was affiliated with Batali and Bastianich and I had no idea it was such a popular place. Most people reserve a whole month in advance just to get a seat! I struck gold and all I was trying to do was get a plate of saltimbocca for my out of town friend. I searched far and wide on the internet and Yelp for this dish. Lupa was our best bet.Lupa delivered. From the complimentary foccacia bread to the massive pounded veal disc, we noshed on antipasti and pasta. This is the way to go. So easily you could make a meal out of it paired with the cured meats. The salads were large. I highly recommend the hot coppa with ricotta and squash. The misticanza all romana was more of a salad filler with thinly sliced radish. Our pasta dishes were the ricotta gnocchi with sausage and fennel and the cavatelli with calamari and octopus. The pastas were EXCELLENT! A little on the small side, but EXCELLENT! We ate family style so really everyone had about three bites but it was just enough to have us craving for more. Really, I'd rather be craving for more than to be stuffed beyond the point of appreciation. It was good we shared the saltimbocca because it was a large portion and would have been too salty on its own. It needed the pasta pairing. The wilted greens it came with was not enough to balance it out. We skipped dessert as the options seemed bland. I'd return in a heartbeat, as I have drooled reading the Yelp reviews for the past two hours and long for the taste of Lupa in my mouth again.

The food is honestly really tasty and the servers are decent but the hostesses & management I would say otherwise! I have never written a review like this, but felt it was VERY necessary given the circumstance.  We dined here right before Christmas and had reservations.  We were the first of our party to arrive and our 2 other family members were running late due to traffic but due to their ""management policy"", they would not seat us first.  This was unacceptable given that I was almost 6 months pregnant and needed to sit down which we told them.  The hostess said she would check with the manager and due to their policy still couldn't seat us which was ridiculous, actually it felt almost like discrimination even.  She stalled for a good 15-20 minutes with this excuse.  Luckily our 2 other party members arrived within 10 minutes after that so then we got seated and they even had the gall to seat us closer to the door, and it was almost 40 degrees outside so it was freezing cold! No apologies, no sympathy....nothing.  We asked to change seats further away from the door and got attitude.  Given this, I would hesitate to EVER dine there again just due to the poor management & treatment of this so called ""high caliber"" restaurant.I've never felt discriminated against but being pregnant and Asian, I certainly felt like I was treated poorly and if I were not ethnic, would not have received this horrible treatment.",1,4,1,Korey W.,"San Francisco, CA",3,11,0

My waitress was new, told me she was new, and I could tell. She pretty much shoved the specials down my throat even though I told her several times I was ready to order. Her serving style was pretty awkward. Hope she gets better in time. The back wait staff was very attentive.

The perfect lunch spot for dining solo and would be quite the ideal date night or a fantastic spot for a dinner for four. I was eying the beets and pistachios to start but I just couldn't pass up the hot coppa salad with housemade ricotta and roasted squash. I'm glad I didn't as it was a very interesting combo of flavors and made for quite a delicious salad. When I took first bite of the Bucatini, I imagined that is how Anton Ego felt when he took his first bite of Ratatouille. It was incredible. Just the right amount of tooth to the fresh housemade pasta. The perfect kick of heat. The right tartness from the tomato sauce. Thick cuts of pancetta and oh so perfectly roasted chunks of slightly caramelized onions. Delicious. I even ate the left overs a few hours later cold and it was just as good.

Pickled tongue was amazing, best one hands down. Prosciutto (normal and aged) and Coppa were quite delicious as well. Salami was solid, Bresaola was a little too strong (my personal preference). The Testa I couldn't finish. It was actually tasty, but just a tad too rich.Marinated Funghi & Farro Piccolo - Cold mushrooms marinated in something acidic/vinegrette on top of a grain. I didn't expect it to be cold so it was a bit of a surprise coming to the table, but it quite grew on me, especially when you get mouthfuls of mushroom with the Farro and the nuts that are thrown in their (pine nuts?). Very nice mix of flavors. Surprisingly satisfying.Apple, Fall Greens & Guanciale - Not super special, but nonetheless a solid salad, with bacon and fat nicely drizzled on.  The vinegrette on it was a tad bit too acidic though, and the Guanciale just  a bit too salty. The other ingredients couldn't really balance out the flavor.Veal Sweetbreads with Shishito Peppers - Yummy. Yummy. Fried sweetbreads with cornmeal, I think, with a couple blistered shishito peppers and what I think was fried daikon. Everything on the dish didn't necessarily blend together, but everything tasted good by itself so I didn't mind.Bucatini All' Amatriciana -  Everyone says get it. It's good, in a hearty comforting way, but not that good. Certainly I've had pastas I've enjoyed more (Zoe's Pappardelle, or Basta Pasta's urchin pasta, or Tre's Funghi, Mermaid Oyster Bar's Lobster Fra Diavolo...). Big dish though, so quite filling. Couldn't finish due to too much other food.Fish of the Day. The BF got it. I tasted some. Was... unmemorable. Can't remember much about it.Dessert - Panna Cotta - Disappointing.

My friend and I headed to Lupa around 9 pm on a Friday night and were expecting to have to wait for a table. Fortunately, 2 spots at the bar opened up so we were seated within 5-10 minutes. We went kind of nuts with ordering -- got the fried brussel sprouts (special for the night) and prosciutto for appetizer and also 3 pasta: cavatelli with octopus and calamari, bucatini all amatriciana, ricotta gnocchi with sausage and fennel, for dessert zuppa inglese.Fried brussel sprouts - slightly spicy, love brussel sprouts [even plain, roasted], these were just as good. Prosciutto - sliced super thin, these were mouthwateringly good!! Geez, probably my favorite part of the meal. Cavatelli with Octopus and Calamari - short pasta which was half dipped in squid ink, pasta itself was on the more dense side. Octopus and calamari were tender and had great flavorBucatini all' amatriciana - long pasta with hollow center, cooked al dente (perfect), slightly spicy with tomato-based sauce, bacon vs pancetta. Ricotta Gnocchi w/Sausage and Fennel - I didn't think that I liked gnocchi until I tried this dish. The truth was that I had just never had good gnocchi! These gnocchi were so soft, pillowy, and airy! The ricotta inside had kind of a goat cheese flavor.Zuppa inglese - similar to tiramisu. Thought it was very interesting, and I enjoyed the crust on top, kind of tasted like rice krispies. Spent about $100 total (for 2 people) including tax and tip, and it was oh so worth it.

4.0,9/25/2012,"I made a reservation for the boyfriend's birthday dinner for 8pm and changed it to 730pm to make sure we had enough time to get to his party afterwards. Someone from the restaurant called the day before and confirmed us for 730. We walk in at 740 and the tiny hostess greets us and tells me that since we're so early it will be a bit of a wait. Excuse me? No, we have reservations for 730. She argues with me gesturing to her computer screen and finally says, ""Well if someone called you to confirm, they told you to be patient because it might be a wait."" RUDE. Actually no, no one said that [B*TCH]. The point of a reservation is that your seat is guaranteed at the time you reserved for, give or take a few minutes. At this point my face read: Sometimes little women just need to get pummeled by other little women. So she asked us to wait outside while she would try to sit us immediately. But no apology. My boyfriend asked for an approximate wait time and she couldn't give us one. We were seated 10 minutes later in the back corner which was fine but I'd be lying if I told you I didn't still want to punch the waitress in the face.We ordered the small meat plate, carbonara, and the duck agrodolce (Tuesday's special). The meat plate was awesome even though half a glass of wine got spilled in the head cheese by the birthday boy. My favorite was the lengua and smoked prosciutto. Carbonara was fantastic. The pancetta was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and greasy within. The generously portioned half a duck was also tasty. Could have used a little marinating.

We were seated pretty promptly; space is tight here, though. There were a few large parties, which surprised me, but they seemed accommodating. Ambiance was pretty nice, a little cramped but nice homey atmosphere and candlelight from the tables. Our waiter was very helpful regarding the specials and recommending his favorite items.We started off with the clams fregola and the buffalo mozzarella. Resounding 'mmm's of approval regarding the clams, and the mozzarella was delicious. Creamy, light, full of flavor. The grilled leek accompaniment was tasty as well. We also got squares of bread and a nice, fruity olive oil.I had one of the specials for dinner, tonnarelli with guanciale and chicken ragu. The pasta was absolutely perfectly cooked, with a lightly spicy sauce with delicate bits of guanciale and incredibly tasty chicken. The portion looked small, but was filling- I didn't finish it myself. Several of us at the table got the Sunday dinner special, the braciola alla cacciatora. Simply presented, it was really great. Another of us got the veal, and another the ricotta gnocchi. Both said they were excellent. The ricotta-eater asked for another piece of bread to soak up the sauce, as it was so good. For dessert, my date and I opted for a cheese plate, featuring choices of parmigiano-reggiano, taleggio, and ricotta with honey. It was served with bread, some sort of apple jam(?), and a pistachio brittle. The cheeses were fantastic, and we could have easily done with more of the apple-y accompaniment. The ricotta with honey was particularly good. As a giving kind of person, I made up servings for our table to share the cheese love. Our waiter noticed we were nearly out of bread for the cheese plate and brought more without having to ask. None of us opted for a sweet dessert, as we intended to hunt down the Wafels and Dinges truck, but I'll probably try the tartufo the next time I'm here, as I'll definitely be back.TL;DR: Delicious food, great service, unstuffy ambiance, will unquestionably return.",2,0,2,Rachael F.,"Metuchen, NJ",134,47,5
2.0,9/15/2012,"Lunch @ Lupa1. Ambiance:  great especially since they opened the doors for a great autumn day. 2. Food: -Bread: ""The first thing that tells you if the place is delicious""-according to my mom. The bread came out cold and  apparently it is always cold. Tasted just like the bread they give out in my college dining hall, they wouldn't even toast it for us (maybe it's against the rules or something). It is soft tastes nice but nothing special.-Beets and pistachio:  Legitimately they took two beets cut them in half and cooked them nicely, sprinkled with whole pistachios with other garnishes. The plate was huge compared to the antipasti. -walnut red onion and escarole salad: just a salad with tangy dressing.  In my mind not really worth the price.  -Salt and pepper pasta (something like that): salty -My mom got the Lamb quill pasta. Tastes like Lamb, pastas a bit funky kind of like eating tofu wrapper. (Mom doesn't really like Lamb). I tried the lamb it tasted mushy squishy (maybe fat) and the taste of lamb didn't let me swallow.-mussel and clam pasta: (taken back because it was wayyyyy to salty) too salty to handle.-Pomodoro:  pasta was kind of too al dente (probably because they rushed to get it out), sauce was fresh not too salty . Dad finished it in like three fork rollups. ""I'm still hungry""-Dad. -Gnocchi with ricotta and sausage fennel:  the gnocchi was deliciously light and fluffy but once again the sauce was a bit salty for my taste.**In general the amount of food for the price was not worth it. I'm not the stingy type. If was delicious I would not have minded so much** 3. Recommendations: -maybe it's better for you, but we did not have a good time. We expected a lot since I chose this place after looking at all the rave reviews. - ask to make the pasta not as salty.4. Final thoughts:-Maybe I'll give this place a try again but right now don't feel like making my way back here again.-did not try the meats since the waitress told us the pasta is a must. -Mom said that the pasta at Mama Teresa is better. The pasta texture might be better here but the overall taste is better at Teresa's ( + they give more food) {Doesn't mean I'm saying that more food means tastier food}Posted a picture of the check so you can see the prices.",1,1,0,June W.,"Great Neck, NY",1,4,8

4.0,7/9/2012,"I feel like a princess whenever I set foot in one of the castles of the Mario Batali/Joe Bastianich empire. And it has absolutely nothing to do with prices because comparatively speaking, these restaurants are very inexpensive with the exception of Del Posto - and with very good reason. As soon as I sit down on a Batali chair, I feel like I am being waited on hand and foot. A certain magic wand is waved upon each dish before it is delivered.The prosciutto popped off the menu, and I gritted my teeth when the waitress came over, so as not to say ""prosciu..."" No, I'm going to try something that I would never order elsewhere because, frankly, I don't really care for mushrooms, unless it's portabella. But with Mario, it doesn't matter if you don't like a particular food. You could order crackers on a platter, and somehow you'll be fantasizing about that delicious platter for weeks to follow.I had the roasted mushrooms with the cavolo nero and shaved ricotta."" The cavolo nero, we were informed, is a type of kale, but not as bitter. Did I really order that? Oh, and thank goodness I did! It was hen-of -the-wood mushrooms, fully of earthiness, and the greens were shredded and also roasted, giving them a little bit of a crisp. All that was topped with a hard ricotta, adding a bit of saltiness. Wow.Then, the seafood spoke loudly to us off the menu: Red Snapper with Sunchokes, Grapefruit & Rapini (broccoli rabe) landed in front of me. The skin on the snapper..oh yes, crispy again..was balanced by the soft sunchoke puree and the refreshing, cool citrus. There was zero bitterness to the rapini. It was like fresh greens from the garden.In front of him swam in the Fluke with Lentils, Bitter Greens & Agrumato, which is an extra-virgin olive oil pressed with lemons. Without wanting to interpret the flow of taste and the perfectly crafted combination coming off of my plate, I waited until I was finished to taste the fluke. It was another winner but a close second.Finally, the dessert round was nearing. Unlike Otto, Lupa offers more than gelato. And while Otto's gelato combinations are works of art unto themselves, I needed something a little more solid. The olive oil torta and roasted pears fit that criteria. I immediately recalled the first time I heard ""olive oil gelato"" at Otto and cringed until it touched the tip of my tongue. There was no cringing this time when I heard ""olive oil"" as an adjective to torta. The Apician Spiced Dates & Mascarpone was a healthier choice, but three dates instead of two large ones might have made it a more worthy contender.

I'm trying to remember if I ALWAYS get a bowl of the sublime cacio & pepe bavette (a medium weight spaghetti), but I should if I don't. So simple, so perfectly prepared. She went with a special, the sweet pea angolotti - small pillows of filled pasta touched with mint leaves. Light and almost fragile (must be Italian - Fragile!), it was a great call. I had the Arctic char, accompanied by artichoke bulbs wrapped in speck and grilled crisp. Again, flawless preparation - the filet, skin on, was the texture of butter.Desserts were very nice - something similar to a trifle and an amazing olive oil torte with fresh blueberries, served warm.

I opted for the Ricotta Gnocchi. They were a little too similar in consistency to marshmallows for me but the sauce was great. Topped it off with the Arctic Char.

I had one yesterday and, as expected, Lupa did not disappoint. We had the salumi plate, which was wonderful (although I'm not adventurous enough eater to try to the tongue or head cheese while with a business associate), and then I had the special fish--a wild striped bass served over purslane and a green sauce that had, I think, lime juice and other herbs. Seriously good. The fish was salted in just the right way, moist, and meaty. My associate had the sausage and peppers, which he said was great.

For the pastas, we ordered 4 -- the triangolo (ravioli with pork cheek), gnocchi (ricotta gnocchi with sausage and fennel), spaghetti alla carbonara, and spaghetti aglio e oilio con pomodoro.  Now all pastas were out of this world, but the gnocchi in particular was the most soft buttery plump perfect gnocchi I have ever tasted. The spaghetti alla carbonara here is also the gold standard for all carbonaras -- not to mention the just plain spaghetti with garlic and olive oil (which I have had at a previous visit).  Our waiter was awesome, by the way.  We asked him for a red wine at about $60.  He brought us the Capolino Perlingieri Sanno Rosso ""Sciasci"" 2008 for $43.  The wine was unbelievable for the price.  It went seamlessly with every dish we ordered.  For me, the wine selection just reinforced what an outstanding restaurant this is, and for the price you'd be hard pressed to beat it.",0,0,0,Jen C.,"Los Angeles, CA",124,429,95

4.0,2/22/2012,"Went here at 6PM on a Wednesday.  The front of the restaurant is more noisy and casual but our table was in the back room, which is a quieter environment with tablecloths and such.  We started out with the charred mackerel and the buffalo milk mozzerella.  I was expecting the outside skin of the mackerel to be crispy but it wasn't.  It tasted pretty good, though.  For the primi, we split a bowl of linguettine with calimari & meyer lemon. The citrus was certainly present but subtly done.  It tasted exactly how you'd expect it to taste.  I noticed that the pasta was cooked to the point that it was a bit softer than al dente, but that's fine by me because that's the way I like it.  My entree was the braised short rib with gnocco al romana.  Pro tip: this gnocco is nothing like the gnochhi pasta that I've eaten.  This was more like a thick, rich disc of polenta except smooth and not grainy.  It was really good.  As for the short rib, I had to warm up to this one but by the end of it I was a fan.  The outside part was ok, but I thought it was slightly overcooked.  However, once I started eating the inside portion I found that part to be perfectly cooked - moist and tender, well marbled and flavorful.  I think they used some sort of balsamic sauce.  We finished up with a cheese plate with robiola, la tur, and gorgonzola.  Very creamy, rich, and interesting flavors.",0,0,0,James S.,"New York, NY",20,102,387

I knew nothing about the restaurant but it looked popular so figured I'd give it a try. I was there on a Friday night and was seated at the bar within 15 minutes despite what looked to be a packed house.The two bartenders (who, I might add, were rocking fantastic beards) gave my date and I some of the best service I've had in Manhattan. These guys could answer any questions about wines or food without missing a beat. They were always ready with another pour and always kept an eye open for our empty glasses. They seemed to share the same brain- If I told one of them I liked a certain wine, the other one already knew it when I spoke to him. Pretty amazing attention to detail and memory from these dudes. We split a few appetizers and a few entrees, and this place was kind enough to split every entree into two separate plates and bring them out one at a time, each as a different course. We didn't ask for this- we figured we'd just pass the plates back and forth. Really, really impressive to do that, as it would extend our time in our seats on a busy night. The highlight of the meal was either the minestrone soup (a strong contender for the BEST soup I've ever had), or the butternut squash agnolotti with a delicious brown butter sauce. I'd eat either of those items every day if I could. We didn't have room for dessert, but it's a shame. Everything else all night was so good. I can't wait to go back and bring friends.

The food was on point...delicious...the wine that was recommended by our waitress was AWESOME and when we gave her our pricepoint and told her what we wanted in a wine, the one she picked was WELL under our pricepoint. Which rarely happens at restaurants...normally they will pick something similar to what you asked for at the top of your budget (We're talking the bottle was $25 we gave her a budget of $60( I really appreciated that because it shows she was listening to what we were looking for, not having dollar signs for eyeballs about how big her tip was going to be. The desserts were standouts and the food was delicious (We got gnocchi and ravioli). My critiques: 1) The place is pretty small so its kinda tight quarters...I could easily listen in on everyone's conversations around me but then again...they were Italian...I'm sure I could hear an Italian's conversation through nuclear war. (Sorry Grandma!) We were put in a corner near a window and the table was kinda small...with our app plate and individual plates and glasses, the table was packed full. 2) the plating was basically non existent and the dishes and plates seemed bulky and cheap. I hate to say that, but if you're going to a nice restaurant and paying as much as we did...(it was pretty pricy) I'd at least expect them to invest in a little good china/plates. They were kinda like diner plates. And on top of it....nothing was really garnished, and it was kinda just tossed on the plate.

Friday and Saturday nights might seat you in between a couple of people from 'Jersey Shores' and some from the Valley. If that's your scene, fine be that way. There are so many delicious dishes on the menu - small and large that you want to try. I recommend family style dining (even for two - just share everything). Last time I was there with my husband we started with the Snap Peas, Leeks & Mint paired with Clams mixed in Fregola & Basil.

I tried the Butternut Squash Agnolotti, Bucatini All' Amatrician and Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage & Fennel. I really liked the agnolotti -- it had a really unique flavor for pasta and was very rich and delicious. The other two were okay but nothing special.

3.0,11/30/2011,"The bread is an omen of things to come. It's a bad sign when a meal starts with shitty bread. I mean, if a restaurant doesn't thoughtfully consider the very first bite of food a customer eats, then what the hell are they doing?The bread at Lupa was terrible. Totally average, flavorless focaccia, served way too cold, with some unremarkable olive oil on the side. It didn't bode well for the rest of the meal.Okay, I'm being a little bit melodramatic. The meal did get better from there. Sort of.We started with the verdure miste antipasti ($25) which had marinated olives, beets with pistachio sauce, potatoes roasted with onions and balsamic vinegar, fall squash alla Romana, treviso with vin cotto, and broccoli rabe with stracciatella. (Oh, did a few of those words lose you, too? Luckily for us there is a glossary on the back of the menu. If you're coming to Lupa to impress a date, though, you might want to brush up on the menu options before you come in so you don't look like a total noob flipping to the glossary every five seconds.)The antipasti were all pretty good, but none of them blew my mind. (Well, okay, the treviso with vin cotto -- which, to you and me, is basically radicchio with vinegar -- was pretty amazing. But that was the only exceptional part of the meal.) Then we moved onto our entrees. On the advice of Yelpers (thanks, guys!) I ordered the bavette cacio e pepe ($15), while my boyfriend was peer-pressured by me into ordering the sea bass with sunchokes, grapefruit, and broccoli ($22). Our two dining companions both got the short ribs with gnocco ($24). According to the waitress, a ""gnocco"" is a ""gnocchi"" made with cheese instead of potato. I was tempted to ask her how, then, a ""gnocco"" differs from a ""gnudi,"" but then I would have had to give into the overwhelming temptation to stab myself in the face so I stayed silent and remained ignorant to the subtle differences between various Italian cheese balls.The bavette cacio e pepe was good. Sort of. In the, ""I am fully certain I could make this at home where it wouldn't cost me $15"" kind of way. But, you know, it was good.The sea bass was cooked very well, but the broccoli and grapefruit on the side were pretty much ... cold broccoli and grapefruit. It was unclear to me how they complemented the sea bass, but by that point in the meal it had been made clear to me that I don't know a gnudi from a gnocco and therefore don't know anything about anything and should just shut the hell up.Oh, and I did have a bite of that gnocco off my friend's plate. It didn't particularly taste like cheese (or anything else) to me. She must have thought the same thing, because she didn't finish it. It's basically a ball of cheese, guys. If a person doesn't finish a BALL OF CHEESE, something must be seriously wrong. We had desserts, cocktails, and cappuccinos, but I'm seriously too depressed by this review to go on. Yeah, yeah, everything was, technically speaking, fine. But for those kind of prices, everything should be freaking awesome.

It was delicious...BUT if I feel i can make it at home, i get annoyed. I had the hanger steak with polenta and mushrooms. It was supposed to be medium-rare. It was rare, and a bit chewy. The polenta had so much butter/cream in it it barely tasted like polenta anymore. That saddened me. The wine was good though. We had the olive oil cake for dessert which was yummy...but not gizz-tastic as I expect my desserts to be in restos. One super annoying thing was the number of busboys lingering around. I swear they were preying on tables like their life depended on it. It was distracting and annoying for such a close space and one of them hit my head and didn't even apologize. I was going to give it 3stars beacuse it wasn't offensive per se, but given the name behind it, the quality should really be higher...2 stars it is.",1,0,0,Melissa E.,"Vancouver, Canada",37,390,19

The waiter was very knowledge in explaining some of the Italian terms not written in the dictionary provided and gave great suggestions.  Our focaccia was warm and extremely tasty while we waited for our meals.

4.0,10/29/2011,"Lupa is an excellent, classic, Italian establishment. Expect only the greatest tasting food, with a lovely, quaint atmosphere. I came here on a Sunday afternoon with a party of 6 for my birthday. For appetizers were ordered the Verdure Miste, a sample of all the cold antipasto and also the Affetati Piccolo, a sample of all the cured meats. Everything in the Verde Miste was excellent, I was particularly fond of the broccoli rabe with stracciatella. The prosciutto was excellent, or perhaps I am just really easy to please? It was just perfect. Of the entrees I personally had the carbonara, it was good. I also tried some classic spaghetti in pomodoro sauce which was simple but excellent and also purposely spicy. I also tasted braciole special which was excellent as well as the hanger steak and polenta. The polenta was out of this world tasty! For dessert I sampled the pumpkin gelato and the quince sorbet. Both were great, the quince sorbet was very refreshing. Why not 5 stars? Our waiter was WAY too forward with his opinions and suggestions about our food. He told us we needed a larger appetizer portion, when we specifically dictated that the smaller portion would more than suffice. When someone at the table ordered the hanger steak he was informative in saying that the steak would come medium rare, she asked if it was possible to have it cooked just a bit past medium rare and he replied with, ""do you want your steak to taste like rubber?"" I personally agree with him that steak should be prepared medium rare (at almost all times), but I don't think it's necessary to sass a customer with a know-it-all attitude. He dropped and checked on the check before we were finished with the meal, and came back for it one too many times making us feel rushed.

3.0,10/21/2011,"My first trip to the well-known Mario Batali restaurant had me with high expectations. I mean, I was a bit disappointed with Iron Chef Morimoto's flagship restaurant in NYC, so I was hoping not to get disappointed here. Turns out that although the prices made the dinner worth every bite, Lupa is a good restaurant that never really hits the ""wow"" level on the taste meter. The food:Table bread = Surprisingly cold foccacia. I mean, it wasn't bad; it was just a little disappointing, because it appeared to be warm and it would've been so damn good if it was warm.Squash = Also surprisingly cold, but it's very flavorful.Tonnarelli special pasta with pork ragu = Had a very unique, cheesy flavor. The Tonnarelli was cooked to a perfect al-dente.Bucatini with Cured Pork = The cured pork was phenomenal here, but the sauce lacked a memorable flavor.Hanger Steak w/ Polenta & Mushrooms = Well-cooked steak at more of a medium (than the requested medium-rare). The polenta had a strong butter flavor that made it taste more like movie theater popcorn than real polenta (albeit still very delicious)Tartufo (Hazelnut gelato covered in chocolate) = This dessert (supposedly the most popular dessert according to our waiter) tasted like the top part of a Nestle Drumstick ice-cream cone. I wasn't too thrilled with this one.All in all, Lupa is a very good Italian restaurant that dares to be a little different, while still maintaining a lot of the Italian authenticity that Batali is known for. It's definitely a nice place for a date, due to its romantic, dim-lit atmosphere and Italian charm.

It was Fashion Week, but what's a vacation without good food with good friends?When I hear raving reviews from foodies alike about Italian cuisine, there is always a hesitation to believe that the restaurant is truly worth trying. This place was mentioned quite a few times... so my friend and I ditched our late dinner reservations at Hudson Clear Water just based on the fact that 1) He's been wanting to try this place, tho Hudson was his new favorite 2) Duck confit was on the menu 3) Italy reunion with Italian fare seemed fitting.We were on time for our reservation, but waited for our table to clear out for about 15 mins. No biggie, but we were starving. To be quintessentially Italiano, we took our sweet time with each course. Started off with a order of  spicy coppa (+) and cold mussels tossed in a light sauce over cous cous. Then moved on to a shared calco e pepe pasta (+). This was sort of the make it or break it test. My friend Robbie lived off of this dish like no ones business everyday for 6 months straight in Rome. This is not an exaggeration. There was definitely a nice kick to it! For our entrees, I had the duck confit  (+) and he had the devil's chicken (+).. cazzo! My duck was delicious, perfectly seasoned and crisp.. the portion was ridiculous. The devil's chicken, indeed was a firecracker to the taste buds. A little too much for my liking, but was well executed-- simple, rustic.

1.0,7/29/2011,"Went to lupa last night and ended up with a bleeding finger, i nearly fainted. It was supposed to be a romantic night, as my date was going on a business trip for a week the next morning. But lupa totally ruined it.I was excited to try lupa after seeing nice pictures on Yelp. We had ham platter, cheese with honey, followed by three pastas and a spcial dish for the night, pig. I would give three and half stars for the food there but the service was not impressive at all. We ordered a bottle of expensive white wine, when she brought over the wine it was an opened empty bottle, she had already opened the wine in the back and poured it into a container. This is the first time ive ever seen something like this in my life! Restaurants should always open wine in front of customers!!!! We felt uncomfortable but didnt complain since her reason was that the wine we ordered was very special and needs to be aired. (the wine bottle was ice cold! Shouldnt it be in the room temp unitl its picked?) Then the container was brought to the back, because apparently they didnt have ice buckets for wine!!!!!Since we requested to have pastas and pig served at the same time, the table wasnt big enough. We shared everything so we needed small plates. There was no room on the table. The waitress did not arrange the table for us ( they had these square tables where you can make them into round tables by unfolding the sides) so i decided to do it on my own.  The table was old. When i unfolded the table my finger was caught and cut by the metal parts that were under the table. I started to bleed a lot! I felt super dizzy, nearly fainted!!! Even people on other tables were saying,"" look! Shes bleeding!""  people from the restaurant had no reaction what so ever!!! My date had to get up himself to go ask for help. No one ever apologized to me, no one ever asked if i needed anything....  A person from streets would have simply asked ""are you ok?""This is one of the worst experiences ive ever had in my life! I love food and have been to a lot of restaurants in the world....

1.0,7/23/2011,"The employees of this place must think that their shitake doesn't stink, but I can assure you that it does. I had made reservations for my wife's birthday at the recommendation of a friend and the earliest they could take us was 10:30. At first, I thought 10:30 was too late, but then thinking that it is NYC, this time would work. Anyway, since the reservation was kinda late, we decided to hit up another restaurant/bar for appetizers and drinks before our reservation at Lupa. Once we got to Lupa, all we wanted to do is have some wine and entrees. First of all, the place is kinda small and was very crowded, so waiting for a table is very inconvenient for both the wait staff and the patrons We kept feeling like pinballs being bounced around as the wait staff whirled around us to serve their tables.Secondly, once seats finally opened at the bar, we went to sit down for a drink and the bartender rudely told us that we couldn't sit down there because the seats were taken. Last time I checked, bar seats are usually first come, first serve. Strike 1.Also, once we finally sat down at our table, out waitress went over the specials and offered appetizers to us. All was well until we told her that we already had appetizers and that we'd only be having entrees. She seemed to get pretty irrate once she heard this and acted like we were not worthy of her attention for the rest of the meal. Arrogance at its finest. Strike 2.Lastly, when I called to make reservations, I mentioned to the hostess that we'd be celebrating my wife's birthday and ask if they could do anything special for her and they assured me that they would. Did my wife once get recognized for it being her birthday, NO!! Strike 3, you're out! Overall, I would give this place a failing grade. The food was mediocre and simplistic at best.

5.0,7/21/2011,"You think you know food until you've had good Italian.. And at Lupa, you get AMAZING Italian. Coming here, getting pasta is a MUST. How often do you get freshly made noodles? And delicious, intricate, mouth-watering sauces? With that being said, the GNOCCHI is phenomenal. Made with ricotta, they are like fluffy little pillows sent from Heaven. The tomato, pork, and fennel sauce tastes like it had been simmering for hours. The fennel is so soft it just melts in your mouth, and the pork adds the right amount of meaty flavor.I get hungry thinking about it.For dessert, try the zuppa. I at first overlooked the item because I thought it was going to be like some sweet soup, but it's actually pretty much like tiramisu. Only better? There is a thin layer of crunchy cookies of some sort on top, and then a layer of whipped (fresh) cream, and then a thick cake soaked in espresso and liquor. and then more cream... I am telling you, d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s. The cake was very dense yet super moist. Amazing.Service was excellent.

1.0,7/17/2011,Was really looking forward to eating at a Mario Batali restaurant. Every dish was terrible. I started with the beets with pistachio appetizer.Sour and salty to the point that there was not beet flavor. Very unpleasant taste and could not force down more than two bites. Waiter took away an almost uneaten dish with no comment. I had the lamb short ribs which was the Saturday special. Very fatty in the middle and charred on the outside. It was burnt to the point that I had two bite fulls of charred crunchy charcoal. My wife had the pasta special. the pasta was salty to the point that it overpowered any other flavor in the dish.

4.0,7/12/2011,"I heard so much good things about this place and finally booked a table for the family and went. As we were deciding what to eat and looking over the menu, this waitress overheard us wondering what stuff was in Chinese, and she came over and did her best recommending dishes to us. She wasn't fluent in Chinese but she was trying so hard it made us feel warm inside. The spaghetti alla carbonara was so rich and creamy, the chucks of bacon were so flavorful it wasn't just salty on your pallet. I wish it had came in a bigger portion haha. I was tempted to order 3 more of these and just gulp them down. Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage & Fennel was delicious as well. My parents liked this one better than the spaghetti alla carbonara. The Prosciutto came in big long thin slices on a wood board. It was delicious with their foccocia bread with olive oil. The salad was tangy and clean tasting, it was maybe one of the best salads I've had. The pork chop and the crispy duck were good too. The crispy duck was moist and savory. The meat was really tender.The only downside of this place is that although it has tons of seats, it was very very crowded. There was no room for our purses/coats and you bump into people's tables when you get up to use the restroom.

Lastly we followed with a dessert, the lupa tartufo.  This was the best part of the meal =)  I mean, who could argue against hazelnut, ice cream, chocolate.  This combination was just meant to be.  Amazing.  Maybe it's a good thing I don't live in NY, or I would be a frequent visitor of lupa solely for the tartufo.",0,0,0,Tiffany C.,"San Francisco, CA",336,688,33
3.0,6/23/2011,"Came here last week with Buo Z. to try some fine Batali fare. The ambiance is really great; you can immediately tell that you're at a higher-end restaurant, but one that's neither too stuffy nor too sceney. It's a good date spot, but would be even better were the food more even. Being the gluttons we are, we opted for the tasting menu, a six course meal that the chef normally prepares of his own accord, but we had assembled a list of dishes we wanted to try. Fortunately this wasn't a problem; otherwise I might have broken down in tears, as I'm wont to do when tasty food is involved. Our dishes were served in a series of pairs: antipasti, primi and secondi.We started with the lingua and the sardines. The lingua was served as thinly-sliced, slightly pickled tongue with sliced onions as a garnish. It was good, but nothing too different from what you'd expect to get if you went to an old Italian or Jewish deli and asked them to slice some tongue for you. My face lit up when I saw the sardines, golden raisins and pine nuts on the menu. These are the basic ingredients to a Sicilian sardine sauce, a dish that I've yet to see on a menu in New York. Add some fried torn bread crumbs, which came with the plate, and some fennel, which didn't, toss with pasta, preferably bucatini or something similar, and you've got a great dish. This was almost there, but instead of giving the sardines a minute or so to cook, the fish tasted like they had been placed in a lemon ceviche for just a short amount of time, leaving them mostly raw, which was a really strange sensation compared to the other items that were sizzling on the plate. For primi the ricotta gnocchi garnered such fantastic praise here that there was nothing I could do - I had to order it. Egged on by descriptions of airy, pillowy gnocchi, my imagination soared and my salivary glands started working double time. Reality, however, was a different story. The gnocchi were kind of dense and the sauce, which seemed to have been either applied very sparingly or tossed with the gnocchi and then removed, gave the impression of being everywhere and nowhere at the same time - everywhere as in you could see it and you could detect the flavor, but nowhere as in you couldn't taste it strongly or roll it around your mouth. If you want really light gnocchi try Serafina - theirs is awesome. The bucatini all' amatriciana, on the other hand, came out of nowhere and rocked my world. The pasta was cooked to al dente perfection and the rich tomato sauce, which received a superlative assist and further texture from a little heat provided by what tasted like crushed red pepper, was studded with crisp, yet tender pieces of pancetta and onion. It was the best thing we had at Lupa; so good that Buo ordered another serving to go. I haven't decided whether this dish is food hall of fame material, but it's close.Even as part of the tasting menu our main courses were substantial. The market fish that day, a sauteed Mediterranean striped bass, was simple enough but could have been better - the fillet that graced our table was unfortunately overcooked and had something of an unpleasant, rubbery mouth-feel to it. Our other main, the chicken alla diavola, came as something of a surprise. While I had expected a more traditional, spicy tomato fra diavolo sauce, the chicken we were served was instead encrusted with ground black pepper and tasted much closer to a jerk. After it was placed on the table another server came over and poured some sort of chicken stock into the bowl to give it more flavor. While the pepper imparted some heat to the dish, it was nothing representative of the apprehensive look our waiter had in his eye when he warned us it was spicy. The chicken was okay - it was more or less plain chicken - but the best part was discovering the and tasty piece of fried bread smeared with pate that the chicken had initially concealed. When we ordered the tasting menu our waiter assured us we would be full by the end, but this little piggy still had room for dessert - I always do! - so we ordered the olive oil torta and a prosecco / lemon sorbet drink. The cake was warm, rich and moist and went perfectly with the sweet  stewed rhubarb and slightly sour creme fraiche - an all-around great dessert. However, I wouldn't recommend the drink; the two parts didn't come together well and the lemon sorbet couldn't mask the alcohol's bitterness.Don't buy Buo's line on the moscato d'asti - it's nothing more than sparkling white grape juice. I had the hardest time trying to detect even a lick of alcohol in it and eventually gave up because I couldn't.My meal at Lupa was good, but mixed. The dishes ran from two to four stars so a three star rating seems fair. With some more good reviews and quick tips we can figure out how to get the most out of this menu. I'm counting on you, Yelp! Make me proud.",1,0,1,Mike K.,"Seattle, WA",89,147,91
4.0,6/20/2011,"Really enjoyed the food and low key ambiance at this Batali outpost. Unlike Babbo, there is a more casual atmosphere that doesn't make you feel uptight about how you're holding your silverware. The food is also more approachable, and dare I say, more palatable. When I visited Babbo, while everything was ""good,"" I consistently criticized the saltiness of all the dishes I sampled. While at Lupa, I mustered very minor complaints.We decided on starting with the rabe and stracciatella, lingua, and calamari farro. As someone already noted, the lingua is a bit sour as it's pickled with onions. But paired with the rabe, it was perfect. The calamari farro was nice as well, a good balance of textures. We followed these dishes with the evening's special of pork shoulder and the garganelli with tripe ragu. Again, the two dishes were good independently, but superb when combined. Everything was stellar, however the fresh garganelli pasta was especially noteworthy.Surprisingly, we had ample food leftover. Which, by the way, the leftovers tasted even better the following day. I learned haphazardly that finding the right combinations and pairings of dishes is what makes for a good experience at Lupa. Every dish chosen worked well with one another, each dish complementing the others. We all agreed that though Babbo is good, it wasn't memorable enough to return. And considering the difference in dish prices, I'd say Lupa is more worth a visit, as it's also a more youthful and less contrived Babbo without compromising quality in any way. PS. The music play list is basically the same at both restaurants, which includes a lot of 80s rock and pop. + 1 for playing my favorite Psychedelic Furs songs ever. - 10 to the table next to us who couldn't correctly identify any song and then proceeded to shamelessly sing them off key anyway.",0,0,0,Karen T.,"Los Angeles, CA",223,312,1

4.0,6/13/2011,"I have to admit that I was a bit underwhelmed by Lupa, but in full disclosure, it could be that I was a bit tired of the Batali-Basitanich culinary juggernaut by the time I got to it during my most recent trip to NYC. After all, I dined at Becco my first night in town, subsequently buzzed through Eataly in the Flatiron District and at Madison Square Eats, then had pizza at the Tarry Lodge in Port Chester, and of course, right afterward, had to peruse the adjacent Tarry Market, a mini-Eataly in the 'burbs. All of these are properties of the burgeoning paisan partnership that keeps New York groping for upscale pasta. So I guess it's my fault that I went on Food Network overdrive. In need of a more casual trattoria, it only made sense that I should go with Babbo's slightly downscale cousin Lupa in the Village. Hardly a place you'd call ""the other side of the tracks"", it is nonetheless more reasonably priced for dinner if you don't mind a more straightforward menu of favorite Italian dishes. I made a reservation on Open Table just three days prior, which may account for the fact that we were seated in the more casual front section of the restaurant across from the bar. I guess you have to be ""in the know"" to get a table in the more elegant-looking back room. Still recovering from our soul food-a-palooza at Amy Ruth's in Harlem that morning, Jamie W. and I order uncharacteristically light for us - a couple of pasta dishes, a shared entree and a shared dessert. Yes, I know...we should do that more often. Jamie tried the $16 Spaghetti alla Carbonara, while I ordered the $18 Trenette with Rock Shrimp and Wild Herb Pesto (see photos). Both were fine and well-executed from a freshness standpoint, but for some reason, they were missing an oomph factor to make the paltry portion seem more than what it was... paltry portions of pasta in bowls. We had better luck with the $21 Braised Oxtails, which for some inexplicable reason, was served on Grilled Polenta rather than the Gnocchi alla Romana stated in the menu (see photo). At first, it looked small, but the portion turned out to be just right for our already saturated appetites. The oxtail had a savory, melty taste punctuated by the pignolas that were thrown in for good measure. Dessert was probably my favorite part of the meal, which is surprising since I don't associate Batali with the sweet side of a meal. It was the $10 Olive Oil Torta, shaped like a baba rum and topped with a dollop of creme fraiche over a roasted rhubarb compote (see photo). Tasty ender for sure. Service was a bit on the mechanical side but not enough to detract from the dining experience which was mostly relaxing even though the serving credenza was right behind me. And thus ends the Batali-Bastianich juggernaut... for now. FOOD - 4 stars...fresh pasta, solid entree, superb dessert - but the oomph factor needs tweaking AMBIANCE - 4 stars...low-key, casual vibe in the front room at least SERVICE - 3 stars...nice enough but a bit perfunctory TOTAL - 4 stars...better than Becco, not quite Babbo, stuck somewhere in the middle",11,5,8,Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4521,4629,37977

5.0,6/4/2011,"On a recent business trip to New York, a Sicilian colleague and fellow foodie recommended that I try this place. So, my expectations were fairly high before I even walked in the door. I must say, Lupa lives up to its reputation and its original concept- an Italian trattoria serving the highest-quality fare at moderate prices. I started my meal with the scallop antipasti which was on special that evening. The scallop was thinly sliced, served raw with a delicate julienned watermelon radish and orange gooseberries on top. It was an extremely refreshing and playful dish. The crispness of the radish and the slight tartness of the gooseberries paired perfectly with the sweet and tender scallop. As my entree, I split the bucatini and and the mushroom agnolotti with a colleague. The bucatini was great, but it was the agnolotti that stole the show. These tiny pillows of pasta were light and airy, but grounded by the earthiness of the mushrooms and the butter sauce. Very delicious.As our sweet closer, we shared a couple desserts among the table. The tartufo is solid. The crispy chocolate shell yields to a creamy almond ice cream center. However, the spiced dates and mascarpone really sealed the deal for me. The mascarpone is covered with a lovely caramel, date and almond sauce. Our server poured the warm sauce out of the saucepan tableside.

This isn't fried rice we're talking about.  There's no chunks of scrammed egg.  It's simply tempered in with the Peccorino-Romano, pepper and bacon to pretty much give the pasta a saucy consistency.  I could have licked the bowl.",0,0,0,Lindsey B.,"San Diego, CA",124,181,54
3.0,5/30/2011,"Got a few dishes to share. The gran reserva prosciutto was excellent, fatty, and rich. However, it was also pretty expensive. The baccala was not salty, which is a little weird for salt cod. The dish came with olives and was ok. The lingua was a little sweet and sour, but had lots of pepper in it. The tongue meat was soft. The oxtail meat was tender, and the gnocchi was fluffy. The dish was one of the better ones we tried. The carbonara spaghetti was al dente and not too salty, but the sauce was too thick to be smooth going down. Finally the gnocchi were pillows of goodness and the sauce was very good. This was the best dish we tried. All in all the food was good but not so much better than many of the high end Italian restaurants in New York City.",0,0,0,Tony T.,"New York, NY",246,919,1464
4.0,5/30/2011,"Oh Lupa, where do I begin with you...For my recent trip to NYC, a friend of mine gave me a going away/have fun in NYC gift - a gift card to Lupa. I was very excited after reading the reviews, seeing that it is one of Mario Batali's restaurants, etc. My cousin and I visited Lupa on a Sunday night around 10PM. We decided we were either going to go for a really early or really late dinner, since we knew there would be a wait around the prime dinner hours. When we got there a little after 10PM, there was no wait and maybe 1/4 of the restaurant was full.The decor at Lupa is simple, cozy, and casual - you definitely dress down to eat here. The service that we received during our visit was just okay - probably because it was the ending of a Sunday night, but our servers switched a few times and towards the end of our meal, it was hard to get a server over to our table as the staff had retreated to the back of the restaurant.The food here, however, is really good. What I loved about the food here is that all the dishes are very simple - simple sauces, combinations, etc. When you taste your dish at first, you may not think right away that it's a mouthful of yumminess, but the contents definitely give your mouth some fun - I noticed that although the dishes seemed simple, the sauces and textures weren't boring at all. Each dish definitely allowed for me to analyze and taste each of the ingredients in the dishes.For dinner (and what may seem like Thanksgiving), my cousin and I ordered Prosciutto, Artichokes, Broccoli, Chitarra pasta, Ricotta Gnocchi, Arctic Char, Tartufo, and Panna Cotta. Now, I'm not a huge meat eater, but after Lupa, I fell in love with Prosciutto. I never had Prosciutto before dining here, but their version is absolutely delicious. Very thin sliced, buttery, and just melts in your mouth. The Broccoli appetizer was good, and also was the Artichokes. Very tasty artichokes and potatoes, but I personally didn't like the taste of the ramps.As for the two pasta dishes, I really enjoyed the textures - very fresh tasting and cooked to a perfect taste. Chitarra pasta was tasty, but yet again, I don't like the taste of ramps. The Gnocchi was SO good. Of course I had to order this since it seems to be the most popularly liked choice based on Yelp reviews. This dish looks and tastes very simple (btw, you barely notice the sausage and fennel), but every bite is just so perfect - delicious and unique tasting sauce and texture of the gnocchi is just right. The Arctic Char was a great selection - the fish was very supple and buttery, the skin cooked to a flaky texture. Eating the fish alone was just okay, but the combination of the supple fish and flaky skin was awesome - yum yum yum! As for desserts, Tartufo was very enjoyable, and the Panna Cotta was ok.I really enjoyed my experience at Lupa - having each dish was like a culinary adventure (yeah, sounds corny and lame - but true!). It was interesting going to an Italian restaurant where the dishes aren't your norm, and having to get to taste some really simple yet delicious sauces. Definitely a much different experience than going to your average Italian restaurant. I would definitely return!",1,0,0,Tiffany K.,"Fremont, CA",906,1000,50
4.0,5/29/2011,"Yum yum yum yum yum yum yumLupa was wonderful. Our server was really pleasant and helpful, the ambiance is inviting, and the food is succulent. I do think the appetizers leave a bit to be desired. Beets with pistachio - an interesting flavor pairing but still just... beets and pistachios. Prosciutto was top notch, but still just... prosciutto.  We also had the calamari which I didn't try but I was told it was a little cold and not worth writing home about. Pastas were really delish. Ricotta gnocchi with sausage were light and fluffy and had just the perfect hint of sausage in the tomato sauce. We also had the bavette cacio and pepe which our friends had raved about during our wait across the street and it totally met our expectations. It's such a simple dish - pasta in a light cream salt and pepper sauce - but so perfect. For entrees we shared the artic char - perfectly cooked with extra crispy skin - and the special of the night, lamb short ribs. I don't typically opt for lamb but this dish was the star of the meal by a long shot. Tender does not even do it justice. You literally could not touch the plate without meat falling off the bone. So. Good. For dessert we had the ricotta with honey and the famed tartufo.

3.0,5/20/2011,"I really really wanted to like this place and was expecting to rave but that wouldn't be representative of my experience. I got the Market Fish (tilefish), it was cooked perfectly and hot when it was served but the overall taste of the fish and of the veggies that came with was incredibly salty. I ate it because I like salty things and I kept convincing myself that it wasn't that bad but by the end of the dish I told my boyfriend that if anyone else was eating it, they would probably consider it inedible. To top off my meal, my margarita was also not very good. As for the other people with me, 1 of the 4 of us was happy with their main meal. Two people got the hanger steak; both were completely unimpressed and described it as bland. The Spaghetti alla Carbonara was really good and my boyfriend got the gnocci as a primi and it was awesome.I will say however that they earned their 3 stars. The service was good, helpful, and not pretentious. The atmosphere was warm and pleasant. The presentation of the place, the food and the staff was great. The ingredients were fresh and the size of the appetizers was actually for sharing (Prosciutto Di Parma and the Escarole, Walnuts, Red Onion & Pecorino salad were both good). The wine list was extensive and the dessert was outstanding (tartufo, rhubarb tort and a coffee flavored ice cream with real cream and some indescribable crunchies on top).

3.0,5/12/2011,"Although it pains my Batali loving heart to say it, I wasn't particularly impressed by Lupa. Maybe I just had too high expectations going into it but I just found it merely good not great.Now, I know it's a popular spot and they need to run a tight ship but there's a difference between efficiency and bitchery. Not to say that anyone was really bitchy, per se, but I just felt so unwelcome. Now, the hostesses were really nice, I will give them that, but our waitress was so brusque and gruff. It also rubbed me the wrong way how you had to order your appetizers and meal together. Again, I understand needing to be efficient in a place like that but come on, really? Her reaction to our request to start with some appetizers before we each decided on our meals was met with such ice that it made me afraid to possibly add anything again later. And in the end it wasn't really that snappy of service anyway. We had a decent lag time between our apps and our main courses coming out. The food was tasty. The appetizers of tuna & cannellini and marinated olives were delicious. My main course of the spaghetti alla carbonara was light but filling. I tried my friend's beef and it was cooked perfectly. My dessert of panna cotta with spiced pineapple was enjoyable but it didn't knock my socks off. All good but it just didn't leave me walking out of there thinking ""Boy, I can't wait to come back!"" The space is cozy and casual. The music playing was awesome (some of my favorite songs represented throughout the night including some music from my friend's band which was a nice surprise). In the end I'd definitely give the spot another shot but it's funny how this was the meal I was most looking forward to during my trip to NYC and it ended up being my least memorable.

I recognized it right away and shouted ""Gnocchi's!!!""We started off our romantic night with Beets With Pistachio and Prosciutto Di Parma. The beets were good, as was the pistachio sauce. But they were just juicy beets. I love beets so it was good- but nothing special. The Prosciutto dish was HUGE! (and GREAT) 6 HUGE slices! At tapas bars, a portion would consist of 1/2 of 1 of these slices cut into 6 pieces.

Our waiter was casual but professional, and he gave us solid advice, including the recommendation of a wine I'd never heard of before (but which complemented our meal perfectly). The wine list is huge. Do not try to negotiate it alone unless you have a lot of free time.We started with the escarole salad--not mezmerizing, but solid, with excellent pecorino over the top.The ricotta gnocchi were . . . wait, let me sit down first. The memory makes me faint. The texture was incredibly light, and we left not a drop of the fennel-y sauce behind. One of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. Do yourself a favor and order this dish.It's all downhill from here, though, right? Wrong again. The hanger steak over polenta and mushrooms had so much wonderful flavor infusing every bite. My husband had the whole roast trout and loved it. It did not come with a starch, or much of anything else, so consider adding to this entree if that's an issue for you.The desserts knocked us out. (Or maybe that was the sambuca.) Peanut gelato sounds bizarre and tasted amazing. The panna cotta was the kind of confection that makes you say, ""How do they DO that?""As delicious as the food  was, it's worth noting that the service and the setting really made this meal special.

4.0,2/25/2011,"Two friends and I decided to have dinner at Lupa last night. We had no reservation, which was a big mistake on our part. We ended up having to wait more than 90 minutes at the bar. However, the bartender was attentive and the wine was good, so how can I complain?It's a very tight space, so prepare to contort yourself to get to and from the bathroom without hitting anyone on the way. The menu is limited, which I like. I get overwhelmed when I have too many options. Immediately upon sitting, we were given a plate of very oily herb bread with olive oil in a dish for dipping. It was very good, though it probably tasted better because I was so hungry by this point. We also got the bread refilled as many times as we wanted, which was much appreciated. I ordered their daily special, which was a saffron cavatelli with a braised chicken sauce ($22). One friend got the winter greens salad. The hot dressing was poured onto it tableside, which was impressive. She followed that with the garlic & oil pasta. Everything was delicious and we all cleaned our plates. The whole experience was greatly aided by the fact that our waitress was extraordinarily friendly and helpful. Despite the manic atmosphere created by the crowds, she was calm and smiling the entire time.Also, if you go, use their restroom. Even if you don't have to go, you should go just to use their hand drying machines. I won't elaborate. Just do it.All in all, this is a great date place or small-gathering place, but be sure to make a reservation well in advance.",1,2,1,Keith T.,"Manhattan, NY",98,519,43

Does not have the typical Italian fare, tending toward more interesting and dare I say exotic options, like squid ink tonnarelli and oxtail. Was not a big hit with our under teen aged kids but was great for the four adults in our party. Service was strong. The waiter was very knowledgeable about all the menu options--we asked many questions--and also had a good handle on the wines.  The bread is a super tasty and the salads were delicious--lots of arugula!  We had a variety of dishes and all were very tasty--the seafood was fresh, the pasta is made on the premises. Sauces were super tasty. We skipped dessert, so no comment there. The place was packed on  Friday night and we just snuck in at 530 PM before the rush.

They were okay, but nothing to write home about. They were slightly salty and soggy.Next we split two pasta dishes: Butternut Squash Tortellini and Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage & Fennel. Both of these dishes wowed us. The tortellini looked more like a dumpling with butternut squash filling, but it packed such a intense burst of flavor that I still can't forget it. The gnocchi was just as good with a great sausage and fennel sauce that was a perfect compliment to the ricotta gnocchi. For our main course, we split the Sunday night special which was Braciola. It was pretty good, but paled in comparison to the pasta dishes.Overall the restaurant was above average, but the fact that I had what I would consider the two best pasta dishes of my life makes me have to give this restaurant 5 stars.The glossary on the back of the menu is also a nice touch since the menu is essentially written in Italian.",0,0,0,Chris S.,"San Jose, CA",13,45,2

4.0,2/16/2011,"Like David Puddy and Elaine, I've had kind of an on again off again thing going with Super Mario's restaurants. On with the spectacular meal we had at Del Posto. Off when Ottoman managed to lose my credit card and still miraculously charge us for the meal. However, I'm pleased to report that after our latest visit to Lupa (named for the she-wolf who nursed Romulus and Remus) we're back together again. Lupa has a small space and after checking in we were taken to a tiny little table that was right on top of another couple and smack in the middle of Main street. That wasn't a pleasant start, but the food that followed more than made up for this bunk draw. We began with some Verdura (veggies) Brussels Sprouts with Local Apples and the Broccoli Rabe with Ricotta. Kris really loved the brussel sprouts and while not really my thing, they were good. I preferred the Broccoli Rabe, though I'd have to say that the spicier version they serve at Otto is far better. For the Primi we shared the Bucatini All' Amatriciana (always a winner) and the Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage & Fennel. The gnocchi was the one I liked more and since my lady just nibbles at meat dishes, I got to house most of it. While Kris was saving room for dessert, this little piggy moved on to the Secondi with the Saltimbocca. This was a big portion and I wish she had jumped in to help me with it. It was a big round dish filled with rich and cheesy goodness. I loved it. It was a more traditional version of the dish than you typically see and perfectly done. On to dessert. We ordered the seasonal apple cider sorbetto. In the blink of an eye a bowl with some pinkish sorbetto arrived for us. It took us maybe one spoonful apiece to deduce that this was not the droid we were looking for. Indeed a manager swooped in with the cider for us. This was amazing and we gobbled it up in no time. Make reservations for this one, you'll likely need it. Food was stellar, service was okay, space is tight, company was excellent.

3.0,2/12/2011,"Lupa touts itself as a traditional Roman trattoria, but I feel it just slightly misses the boat on the meaning of the word.  Where it does do it right is atmosphere.  There's a very rustic, homey vibe.  The restaurant is split up by a narrow hallway with one big room in the back, and a seating section up front.  There's also a chef slicing up prosciutto in the front room.  Overall a great atmosphere.On this night I had a daily special, pappardelle with lamb.  The pappardelle was pretty good and the lamb was cooked in a way similar to pulled pork in terms of texture.  It was a great dish, and maybe i'm just a fatty, but the portions were just way too small, especially at an average price of around $20-$25 a dish for dinner.For dessert, I had the Ricotta Panna Cotta with Plums.  Plums wouldn't be something i'd go out my way to try, but my dinner date swore by it.  To my surprise, it was quite good.  They also took the time to put the plums for you so that you can just dive right in.  It wasn't overly sugary, but was still sweet.A good meal, but it just left me slightly unsatisfied given the price.  Up next, a review of the chicken nuggets I had right after this dinner.",2,4,3,Kyle W.,"New York, NY",205,211,355

3.0,1/17/2011,"Dinner at Lupa was my most highly anticipated event in a recent trip to NYC.  Unfortunately, I left the restaurant feeling somewhat disappointed in the overall experience.I made a reservation on opentable a few weeks before our trip, and was only able to get a 5:00 Sunday reservation.  We prefer to eat dinner later, but thought- NYC! MARIO BATALI!  Besides, the sun sets early in winter, so an earlyier dinner didn't seem like such an issue.  I was slightly annoyed when several tables were still empty around 6:30 when we left, and wished we would've forgone the res and just showed up.Atmosphere: the front room is cozy and warm feeling.  We were led to the back room which was much more sparse and had a draft blowing through it every 10 minutes or so.  I think we were near a vent.Once seated, we were handed menus and the waitress fired off the specials at a rapid pace.  Many of the specials included Italian words, and my processing skills couldn't keep up with her speech.  I got the overall gist of the dishes, but felt uncomfortable asking questions as she seemed ready to move on to the next table.  She gave us some time to think and came back a bit later for our wine/app order.  We were going to skip antipasti, but our waitress seemed slightly dismayed by this, so we ordered a salad to split and a bottle of chianti classico.  The salad was decent, and the wine was great.  The wine director poured our glasses for us, and she had a pleasant aura.  For dinner I ordered the bucatini and my husband ordered spaghetti carbonara.  I liked my dish, but found it rather simplistic.  My husband loved his carbonara.  Dessert was a success, with the highly recommended Lupa Tartufo- a great blend of textures, and how can you go wrong with chocolate and hazelnut?  The prices are fair for quality and portion sizes.  If I was a NYer I might occasionally find myself at Lupa, but as a sometimes guest of NY, I will on future visits search out something more memorable.",1,0,0,Heather E.,"Chicago, IL",18,75,19

We couldn't get a reservation but after a nice phone call to find out if they take walk-ins, we decided to give it a try. Since the group as a whole couldn't make it out to eat until around 730pm, we decided that the 2 who were about to fly the coup could wait while the bf and I met them an hour later. They got there at 630pm and put their names down. The plan was set in motion. I (with nothing to do at the time) decided to keep them company and met them there to wait. Since we thought it would be boring to just wait there though, we decided to go to nearby Francois Payard Bakery and have some dessert before our meal. We sat. We talked. We waited. And by 730pm, our entire group was ready to eat. Just perfect! If only... We returned to Lupa only to find out from the host that we were supposed to call 20 minutes prior to inform them that we still wanted to eat there. What?! Never heard of such a thing. And even if that was their policy, how about you tell us that when we're putting our names down?! Alas, that did not happen. We were instead asked to wait another 45 minutes to an hour, and to call in 20 minutes to tell them we still wanted to eat there. Bad service might I say? Indeed I do. I understand the mix-up but could nothing be done to somehow compensate for it? Can we not have been placed at the next table and have been told, this time once, we could sit. Next time, we must call! If not, can we not at least have had our wait time cut in half so that our starving selves didn't have to bite our arms off before being able to eat??? It's too bad really.

3.0,12/1/2010,"I am being pretty generous here, given the price level. We had a 9pm reservation, got there a bit early and were told to wait by the bar. Fine, no prob, who doesn't like sitting at the bahh sipping on some vino in anticipation of a delicious meal....except there's about 6 seats at the bar at this palce and everyone's eating dinner at them. So we kind of mulled around the area, had to move and duck out of the waiters and bartenders way who were going in and out of bar area about 216 times =). But we did get seated at promptly 8:55! So anywho, the Savignon blacwine ($47) was AMAZING, really, the best white wine I have had. The apps : I  got a cod salad/appetizer thingy and it was fine...fine, who wants fine food right? exactly. There was not much flavor. And the arugla salad was....fine. For the main dish I just had  a simple Spaghetti pomodoro which was super fresh and yummy (but yet was missing the wow factor). Hub had the hanger steak and it was a straight out 3 out of 5. So, I'm not known to say no to dessert, but I decided to pass it up, given the anticipation of something just ok tasting.

We also got three pasta dishes: the gnocchi, bavette cacio & cepe, and the spaghetti. Both the bavette and spaghetti were VERY al dente to the point of crunchiness. Sauses were average and dishes arrived cold to the table. We had asked for recommendations on wine, had the manager?/sommelier ?/someone? arrive.

4.0,10/30/2010,"Let's clear a few things up about this place: It's small, it gets very crowded most nights between 7-10:30, and tables are close. Tables do not get sat incomplete. Just standard operating procedure. Be prepared. You'll get ""rushed"" to order as some complain, for the missing people  if they let you sit incomplete, which seems a reaonable trade-off. It's small, and a volume driven, in order to seat people with no rezzies Pasta- Under Primi section (primi as in first people- NOT ENTREES) This isn't Tony Di Napoli's or Carmines. most if I recall are priced on average of 17 bucks, with the more labor intensive fresh pasta being around 22.  My fave that I can eat over and over is the Spaghetti Pomodoro, this is perfection on a plate.  16 bucks!Can't tell you how many times I've brought friends in for late lunch, when it's surreal and quiet, and had one carafina ( glass and half mind you) , some nice foccacia, one pasta and split a dessert, and my share was about 32-34 bucks with tip.. I don't love everything on the menu, and yes certain items that are inherently salty, i.e. sardines olives, items with cured pork or sharp aged cheeses,  on occasion, will receive  that little extra dab of seasoning that pushes a dish to the brink. But  I saw too many complaints about dishes that are just that, inherently salty, and let's face it, most restaurant food is typically seasoned much more than most cooking at home. When it's bad, it's bad, but try and keep some perspective.  Every vegi antipasti is 6 dollars. I like the simple beets personally, just a dallop of a pistachio butter, and the brussel sprouts and apples are tasty as well. Oh, did  (YOU at home endlessly blogging)  forget Broccoli Rabe is F'ing bitter by nature ?? hey it's not something I've gone out of my way to order either, but let's keep that in mind, shall we?I might say the pesce area of the menu leaves something to be desired, Love Calamari, the sardines ( which we didn't have on this visit) have always been stellar too. Though I'm not so crazy on underseasoned Baccala...and glad to see Octopus was gone...  Def a hit or miss area of the menu, depending on what you like. The rest of OUR meal condensed:Entrees: Someone at the table had the striped bass, looked great, nice filet w crispy skin, my GF had the chicken, yes it's very peppery, but a half organic CHX ( she asked our waiter about that ) and so awesome with juices poured over, so good! I loved the treat of liver pate served with it. It was Tues, and that means as I'll always now remember, Crispy Duck! Half a frickin duck, described as confit, and then gently fried to get crispy skin, the roasted pears went well, this is a delicate balance, I could see how one second too long getting crispy can dry it out, but 99% of the meat was perfectly most still. As a side I noticed Lamb Chops are on the menu now too.. Alas only on Wed... Well, desserts are simple, but the gelato is amazing, apparently there's some Gelato guru coming up with the flavors, again, simple but unequaled richness and smooth texture... wow! My buddy had an Amaro that he said was awesome to see on a menu, not too savvy myself, but I had a perfect Espresso. It was hot, it was slightly tangy and bitter, just right... What a great meal, and for 3 of us, w a few      antipasti, two pastas, 3 entrees and one dessert- w btl of red that was 47 bucks, with tip was 224 bucks.

5.0,10/25/2010,"Came here for Friday dinner, and over all 5 stars experience. First of all, just like Mario Batali's other casual dining place babbo, their bar is quite small. Say, REALLY small considering the number of guests they accommodate. I arrived 10 minutes in advance for the reservation and was told to wait at the bar. At the bar, all the seats are taken and no room to stand at bar table, nor at away from bar table. Where should I be with a glass of wine while I don't have any space even to stand at the bar area? I know it's not a big deal for many people, but for me, drinking at the bar before dinner is happy ritual. Apparently the iron chef tried to squeeze as many tables as possible in the restaurant to handle all the guests who try to make reservations here. I know this place is known for food, not for drinks. So, maybe he's right. But, just wanted to have comfortable space to happily wait for my dinner time. On the other hand, all the food I had here was really good. And reasonably priced too(wine list is also reasonable. It starts from thirty something). You must, definitely, order ""affetati"" (appetizer sampler). For two person, piccolo was the perfect size. We ordered pasta and fish from that day's special and both tasted really good. But above all, the hanger steak was remarkably good. Maybe the most tender hanger steak I've ever had.

5.0,10/6/2010,"A product of Mr. Mario Batali's culinary genius it should surprise exactly no one that Lupa is as good as it is. I have eaten here about half a dozen times, and with each trip I discover a new Italian meal that ranks among my favorites.On my most recent trip the meal started with a flavorful bread and a simple but delicious olive oil. There is no way on this planet the olive oil comes from a store. For no reason whatsoever* they brought out a ball of prosciutto encrusted with deep-fried bread crumbs. How do they get a clump of prosciutto, by which I mean prosciutto literally rolled into a wet ball, to seem thinly sliced? The thing was deep-fried yet still managed to seem delicate?There is only one answer: Mario Batali is a wizard.I broke that fucking story right here on Yelp, bitches.Next up was my bucatine al amatrician and garden carrots. Now, when you read that word,""carrots,"" your mind probably served images of something orange. Perhaps it was moist and good, perhaps it was cold and crisp. Neither option matters here. What I ate was some sort of pale-fleshed cinnamon-flavored carrot god. My bucatine was perfectly al dente and lightly smothered in a sauce so delicious that the expression, ""That is some excellent pork chin!"" no longer sounds like an aberration coming from my lips.** My service was ideal. While I've never experienced a moment of service joy that nearly made me weep (cf. my review of Canlis in Seattle), I never waited too long for anything, food, drink or otherwise. The decor and environment ooze class and understatement. Brick walls with lovely arches hold shelves with a wide assortment of spirits and Italian wines, and the ambient music was barely audible over the indistinct murmur of the other diners. When I originally wrote this review I gave Lupa four stars, a truth that might have you holding your head while rocking back and forth in your chair.""Not one of your sentences above is negative!"" you howl with so much strain you project ropes of spittle into the air between us. ""You rave about the service and the food. You keep returning to this restaurant like you need to go to meetings for your Lupa habit! What madness is this that you would even consider a four-star rating? Is this some sort of Da Vinci code? Did Dan Brown ghost write this review? Help me understand, Thompson!""Just take some Thorazine and stick with me. I'll explain. A few months ago I ate at Babbo, another Mario Batali restaurant. I ate heart. I ate tongue. I ate oysters. I had interesting things cooked not very well but perfectly. When I wrote all those nice things above I was thinking about the delirious and wonderful experience I had when I ate at Babbo, and no matter what Lupa simply cannot compare. Then I remembered the price. Lupa is cheap enough to be a lunch spot, and Babbo is where you take the Pope when you want to butter him up and ask him to apologize for decades of providing sanctuary to child molesters.*** Because you and the Pope are friends in this scenario. The truth is that Lupa is not supposed to be Babbo. Babbo wears a tuxedo even when sleeping, and Lupa wears 1950s style pajamas like your grandfather while never descending into the admitted comfort but legitimate laziness of boxer briefs (i.e. Olive Garden). Between the price, the food, and the excellent service you simply cannot go wrong with Lupa. *-- other than my dashing good looks, naturalmente.**-- al amatrician means it's based on  guanciale, or pork chin, pecorino cheese, and tomato. I did not know this either when I ordered my bucatine, but trusted my server's good taste, much to my reward.***-- If you are Catholic I did not write that sentence.

We also had the gnocchi with sausage and fennel which was delicious.

Let sme just say that if you go around April, they will have the Brussel Sprout appetizer on the menu and you MUST order it. I went the second time, salivating for it but it was out of season :( They have an excellent, always updating/changing wine menu and the bartenders really know how to suggest a nice wine for your taste. They also are happy to provide you with a generous sample so you can pick the one that is just right for you. I would say you cant go wrong with any of their specials, lots of home made pastas to choose from and in general the theme throughout the menu is Simplicity. Basic ingredients without overwhelming the plate. At my second visit, I ordered a pasta that just plainly had fresh black pepper and peccorino with freshly made pasta. It was very salty. A couple of other dishes such as the radicchio appatizer was also a bit salty. So a bit of a miss that night. I would definately come back again because the bill for two people with a couple drinks, appetizers, two entrees and one yummy panna cotta dessert later, the bill was under $100 which is great for NY.

Now, after you've settled down a bit and enjoyed a generous pour from the excellent by-the-glass wine list, its time to really get serious and order some pasta.   I've had the bucatini all' amatriciana and the spaghetti alla carbaonara.  The bucatini is unreal.  Its so al dente, so perfectly sauced, so subtly porky, its almost too much to bear.  The guanciale is coarsely chopped and sticks to the pasta so you can nab some with every delectable bite.  The carbonara is perfectly balanced between egg, pecorino and coarse black pepper with the egg and the cheese binding together nicely and the pepper lending a pervasive kick throughout.  Delicious.I will have a hard time ordering anything else but I suppose I should force myself to branch out.   Molto Mario does it again.",1,0,0,Ryan F.,"New York, NY",5,42,0

The only reason I don't give it a full 5 stars is because our waitress was not as welcoming as I'd hoped and based on other reviews here it seems like this is a trend and not an outlier. As others have recommended, the ricotta gnocchi is exquisite, you must have at least one person in your group order this. The pappardelle with meat ragu is perfectly executed and boasts a hearty, flavorful sauce. Like the other Batali restaurants, a big focus here is on the antipasti. This time we ordered the vegetables and was quite surprised that vegetables could taste so good. Most notably the roasted beets with pistachio sauce - divine. Lupa also has a great wine list with tons of offerings at a variety of price ranges. We found a wonderful bottle for ~$30.

Actually they were a little less than okay, but given that it was a Sunday brunch special and that it didn't cost that much I would give it an ""OK.""The side of corn felt like it was boiled in straight up salt water. I did not taste ANY other spice other than salt. It was awful! I asked the waitress if it was supposed to be that salty and she asked if I wanted another side of corn instead, which was nice of her. So she brought back a ""re-done"" side of corn and it tasted much better -- although still not amazing.  It had some other herbs in there and the dosage of salt was cut in half.The spaghetti carbonara was pretty light and the noodles were firm. But there were only about 3 pieces of teeny bacon in there so it seemed very plain. The pork shoulder was also very salty and we all agreed that the sundried tomatoes were overpowering the entire dish.

4.0,7/23/2010,"With any Batali restaurant, I think you will get good food.  It is a matter of value for the price and pain in the ass of getting a table at a reasonable hour.  This is true of Babbo and to some extent Del Posto.  Lupa is a pretty good compromise.  A great way to get a taste of what Batali does really well (pasta) while not having to mortgage the house and wait for weeks and weeks for a reservation.  Lunch gets you a better shot and getting a table, but not a break on prices.  Stick with the pasta, it is near perfect.  We had a pappardelle with pork shoulder ragu.  The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente and the ragu had a rich meaty flavor.  You could really taste the freshness of the meat and the herbs without being overwhelmed with cream or heavy cheese.  I think it is the trademark Batali experience to be able to taste the ingredients in his dishes.  The other pasta was a grilled octopus and mint linguini.  Big points for delivering an unusual flavor experience (at least for the US).  The octopus provided a nice texture to the dish and the mint really brightened the flavor of the dish.  Again, the pasta was perfect al dente.  The other dishes were nice compliments, but not the star of the show.  We ordered a shaved asparagus with pecorino appetizer.  It was a really good side dish.  The shaved raw asparagus provided a unique textural experience and the pecorino delivered a punch of flavor.  It was a really good way to start the meal.  The secondi was a grilled striped bass.  Well executed and very simple.  The skin was crispy but I found the fish to be a bit under-seasoned.  I am going with 4 stars for this place because of the great pasta and apps and good service.  It doesn't get 5 stars because I think Po is a better end to end experience at the same price point.   Lupa did not have the same variety of great dishes on the menu and the secondi was a little flat.  I would totally go back to Lupa and could be converted to a five star believer, but for now, four stars it is.",0,0,0,Scott C.,"San Francisco, CA",24,530,285

We were ushered to table along aisle, next to an occupied 2 top. Those of you who know the place know it is shoebox size and 2-tops are right next to each other, almost like table for 4. Since it was mostly empty we asked for another table, was told the 3 top along wall was only for 3. Ok, how about big communal table along front? only occupied in middle by two people. She wanted to seat us next to door, we asked for other end of table. Remember we told her we would only be an hour and place is half empty. She again said no that was for 3, so she sat us again right next to other couple. we asked to move other one seat. Thank goodness that was ok with her! OK, wait for it, here is ultimate in horrendous restaurant service. Three seconds after we sit down, a walk in party of 5 arrives, hostess comes over and asks us if we could move over 1 seat because this is only table for 5 they have, is at big table.At this point, we were flabbergasted at the rudeness and were almost speechless. How can you treat 2 paying customers like that? Why couldn't we have the 3-top? What are the odds that in the hour we are there, they need it?????Will never go back or recommend it to friends after being jerked around like that.

We also ordered a bottle of chianti and it went well with our meals. Our entrees came out timely and I had the chance to taste other people's plates. I tasted the bucatini which was in a spicy tomato sauce- very simple and full of flavor! that would be a plate I'd order next time I go there. I also tasted the spaghetti with oil and garlic- classic and very simple. The garlic was not overwhelming and I found it very satisfying to the taste buds if one wanted simple noodles and some flavor. The focaccia bread that comes out standard to your meal, was very good and fluffy. Too bad the gnocchi portion was not that generous- it was from the primi section of the menu so its expected to be a smaller portion. We would've ordered some dessert but we were full from the wine, meals and focaccia. Service was great. While sitting there paying for the bill, my sister who sat right across from me accidentally knocked her wine glass over which splashed all over me and my white dress. I sat there in shock for a good 5 mins of no movement. But the waiter saw this happen and got me napkins to wipe up and said ""come with me we have wine away"". Got up and followed him to the bathroom and there he gave me the bottle of wine away to spray. Stood in the bathroom spraying every part of my wine stained dress and washed my face. Despite the wine spill, the food and atmosphere were excellent! There were only 2 bathroom stalls so waiting is ensued. The bar area gets crowded very easily and since there isn't a railing or separation between the two, the bar crowd sometimes spills out into the restaurant floor so it creates a big crowding/blockage when youre trying to get through the restaurant. I'm not saying it's the best damn italian food I'ver had.

THAT'S a curvy man. some brave souls would even venture to say he's fat ... and i doubt that they're talking about the ""ph"" kind. but, ya know what? if i owned a restaurant like lupa, i'd be pretty curvy myself. i'd eat things like ravioli with spinach for breakfast, bass with fennel & fava gremolata for lunch, hanger steak and risotto for dinner and snack on black pepper pannacotta for those little meals in-between. it'd be important to maintain that curviness with those five (little) meals a day. see! yums in the tums AND health-oriented dibbs. woo hoo.  but, alas, that is only a pipe dream. because, not like you needed this spelled out or anything, this place is kinda pricey. for now, i'll settle on having my lupa fix once in a blue moon, and revel in the fact that i can still (somewhat) zip up my jeans. yo, lupa - take pride in the fact that you're pretty phat ... and not even batali himself can say that.",15,12,11,Aimee O.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",282,238,10

5.0,5/6/2010,"I took my girlfriend here last week.  I was a little lazy making the reservation (didn't do it until the morning of, on a Friday), so the only times available were 4:30 and 11:00.  So on the weekends, reservations are a must, preferably a day or two in advance.We had some time to kill, so we grabbed drinks at The Room on Sullivan, just South of Houston (basically 1 block away).  11:00 may be a late dinner, but it was worth the wait.  The restaurant has a dim, romantic atmosphere and the service was unbelievable.  We ordered a bottle of Lambrusco (sparkling red, highly recommend) and the sommelier came over to highlight the finer points of the particular bottle we chose.Then the culinary adventure began... We started off with two appetizers: speck and broccoli rabe with ricotta.  Both were delicious - especially together.  For entrees, I went for the gnocchi and my girlfriend chose one of the specials, a whole fish.  Although the gnocchi was delicious, the portion was rather small.  The fish on the other hand was a generous portion, too much for her to finish in fact - lucky me :-)  They filleted the fish right in front of us, which was a nice novelty.After we finished the entrees we had finally reached the real reason we chose Lupa in the first place, the tartufo!  This decadent dessert alone justifies the trip.  The shell is a soft, chocolate-hazelnut and inside you'll find an explosion of fruit and vanilla ice cream that just overwhelms the senses.If you're having trouble getting a reservation at a reasonable time, I'd recommend eating close by and skipping dessert.  Late night (around 12 or so on the weekend), the restaurant really clears out and you can just walk in to try the tartufo.  The portion is large and very share-friendly.  If you're looking for good Italian food in Manhattan, Lupa is definitely worth checking out.",1,0,1,Anthony D.,"New York, NY",158,38,2

The veggies samples were ordered were okay: - Marinated Olives - Beets with Pistachio - Squash Alla Romana  - Brussels Sprouts with Pecorino  - Treviso with Vin Cotto  - Broccoli Rabe with Ricotta I liked the beets and the butternut squash the best. For my entree, I ordered the Pappardelle with pork shoulder (butt) ragu special.  I did not like the pasta much and was disappointed with the pork butt sauce.  It was nothing like the pork butt at Momofuku Ssam Bar, or the kind the Squab & I make for our pork butt curry.  The Squab ordered a pasta with pork jowl (Guancial).  The pasta was al dente and better than my pappardelle, but not exceptional.  The pork jowl meat was good though. I tried my friend's lamb short ribs (the Saturday night special, but they agreed to make it for him)  and was unimpressed.

I have had the brussel sprouts before at Vino de Marco (?) in Vegas, and to be honest I think it was better there. However, the radicchio was Incredible! I don't really like radicchio generally because it is too bitter, but this was wonderful and sweet and savory - just to die for. I have figured out the brussel sprouts and now feel I make a good version - this one will be more difficult. Next we had pasta - the special was a small gnocchi w/ lamb ragu, and the black pepper linguine. The lamb ragu was very flavorful, though the overall dish would not bring me back to a restaurant. The linguine is apparently one of their signature dishes, and it was indeed very very good. Seems so simple, but it is so amazing. next - the pork shoulder. After listening to this poor man next to us complain at length about the fact that the duck special was unavailable (we were disappointed as well, but what can you do?), we were happy to find that the pork was excellent - the crusted edge was great.Finally, we had the black pepper panna cotta with cranberries. My friend is a big cranberry fan, so that was good, and it was a very good panna cotta, but I must say I didn't get the pepper.

It was a toss up between the ragu and the carbonara for me...i normally prefer my pastas with more meat in it, so the ricotta gnocchi was a little plain.Finally, we had the hanger steak, which was cooked almost rare, but done so well that it surprisingly didn't bother me. Overall, an excellent dish, but the pastas still take the prize in my book. The two desserts that i enjoyed: the panna cotta with cranberries and the tartufo.

I had shivers while eating it--the panna cotta of such a texture to be soft without airy and insubstantial; figs sweet without being saccharine (i found them to be woody and green, even); and the black pepper to be super fresh and just the right amount.I'll say that the pasta dish was well done, perfectly al dente. the fish was interesting, with blood orange, and not oily. and the salad was, well, salad.But I'll go there and eat dinner (perfectly happily, btw) just to get to the panna cotta!",2,0,0,Brian P.,"Brooklyn, NY",88,232,3
5.0,2/10/2010,"Wow! I love this place! Been here several times and it never fails to amaze me. Sounds like a 5 star rating!Last two times, I arrived mid-week close to 10 oclock with no rsvp. No Problem. They take walk-ins and have a nice bar area where you can hang out and enjoy a glass fo wine as you wait. On that note, the wine list is incredible (wines in all price ranges). I also like how the menu is in Italian with a glossary in the back. Gives you that extra feel of authenticity.on to the food...For appetizers, I like the salted cod fish (Baccala). Nothing will dissapoint though. The pastas are cooked to perfection!!! Some of my favorite pastas were: Bavette Cacio & Pepe & the Bucatini All' Amatriciana. Simple yet delicious. In fact, next time I go I am getting 2 pasta dishes instead of one Primi and one Secondi. Yeah, its that good!For dessert, the tartufo is money! Best Tartufo I ever had. Also, nice selection of cheeses for after dinner. Highly recommend trying the Ricotta with Honey. I recommend the late night winter Roman tasting menu if it is still available. They constantly have various tastings and specials. Final thought:Hands down one of the best restaurants in NYC!",4,0,0,Mike S.,"New York, NY",28,117,19
3.0,2/6/2010,"Another Restaurant Week try out. Headed here for lunch and even though we made 2 separate reservations for our group, they were nice enough to put both tables together.The place was crowded on a weekday at 2PM. Once our party of 12 was seated, we received bread and olive oil. We all ordered from the menu and here's what I tasted:-oxtail terrine and bitter greens: consistency similar to pate and flavorful-pureed white bean soup: salty with a few whole white beans and pasta at bottom. Seemed to be lacking something...-house made pasta with Heritage pork ragu: perfectly cooked and tasting pasta with tender and chewy slivers of pork-veal meatball with swiss chard and chickpeas: meatball was dry, tough and very dense-house cured cod in winter vegetable soup: tasty broth-tartufino: like a chocolate truffle, get this if you like chocolate-ricotta with honey: delightfully light and refreshingI felt the food was mediocre.

4.0,2/6/2010,"Lupa is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in NY.  I've had a great experience each time I've gone.  The food is always tasty and simple.  My favorite pasta is the cacio e pepe.  I've sat in the front room, the back and at the bar.  I think the back room is the best since it's not quite as crowded.  However, the front has more ambiance and better people watching.  The bar is fine but I felt a bit crammed as people started to fill in and wait for their tables. Definitely recommend showing up early (before 6pm) to sit at the bar.  Reservations should be made at least a month in advance. When it's cold, I recommend checking your coat so it doesn't get in the way. The hostess will hook you up.The service has always been great.  Very approachable and helpful.  Our waiter helped us pick out some delicious wine in our price range.",2,0,1,Tina B.,"Chicago, IL",115,342,47
4.0,2/3/2010,"I went here for dinner tonight and was not sure what to expect. Every time I have walked past Lupa there has been a line of people waiting for a table. So I did expect it to be crowded- and it was. Waiting for a table by the bar resulted in a lot of jostling.  However, once we were seated at a table in the front dining room, things improved. We had the special salami as an appetizer.  It was ok- none of appetizers really knocked my socks as I am always hoping for calamari at Italian restaurants. My friend and I both had the hanger steak and it was EXCELLENT. Best of all, the proportion was not tiny- but was not too large either.  It left you full, but definitely craving more. Did I mention the hanger steak was excellent?  We both had tartufo for dessert which was also very good. However, while at dinner, it was just great to enjoy the ambience and scene.  it was a neat crowd and good for people watching. I will definitely go back.

Well it's restaurant week in NYC and lupa had this 3 course special that was going on and I decided to take a stab at the meal.  I got the ox tail terrain, spaghetti with meat ragu, and hazelnut gelato.Ox tail review - The ox tail terrain was fabulous but to dense.  The dish came with bitter greens but the down side was they gave you only 5 leaves of arugula and 2 pieces of radicchio.  The dish would of been perfect if they gave more greens and a lemon slice on the side.Spaghetti - All I have to say is simple and good.Gelato - Nutella and gelato.  What can go wrong?The day I open my restaurant is the day my dream comes true. =)",1,0,0,David S.,"New York, NY",5,48,0
4.0,1/31/2010,"After our taste buds failed to be wow'ed by Del Posto, I was hesitant to keep my ridiculously late reservation @ Lupa. We got there earlier and surprisingly, there was room for us and were seated within 10  minutes. I love places that are rustic, bustling, and inviting (not to mention SMELLS HEAVENLY) so we were already getting a good vibe. As for the food, we really enjoyed ourselves and wished we had a bigger appetite to order everything we had our eyes on. I know the saltimbocca seems to get mixed reviews, but I enjoyed it, although I do not agree on the $23 price tag. It was large, tasty, and satisfying but it's more of a ""comfort"" style food than a fine dining or tasting experience. It tasted like a tender version of a Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage..which I love, but like I said, not quite worth the price. The Bucatini alla Amatriciana was deliciously saucy, although a bit on the salty side and not at all spicy like the description said. Had good bits of guanciale in it, which added a very ""porky"" flavor to the pasta. Service here is very accommodating. Our waiter seemed a bit frazzled (it was a very busy Saturday night..I guess the frigid temps can't keep us away!) but still very nice and helpful. The coatcheck girl was a sweetheart, the reservation girl was as nice as she could possibly be while managing hungry patrons grumbling about the ridiculous wait. Despite the price on certain dishes and saltiness, I would come here again..one of the most satisfying Italian dinners I've had in some time. I would definitely try to book for an ""off-peak"" day if Lupa even has any.

I can, however say that this is without a doubt a beautiful experience from start to finish. There was a calm sophistication to the restaurant that made me feel like this was an effortless execution for them, something that they weren't really even trying hard at. While I know this was exactly the handsomely crafted experience that I was meant to have, I cant help but feel a bit enamored by the air of ease. The Service was wonderful. When we sat at the bar and discussed our pre-dinner drinks with the mixologist we found him to be extremely keen on explaining our different choices. I won't detail the drinks. You should openly discuss your desires and know that they will be fulfilled. Our waitress Deborah, I highly suggest you ask for her by name. She was wonderful, emotive, and generous- everything a server should be.Our mealAntipasti E Salumi Carne- Wonderful, depth of flavor and detailed curing. Highly recommended. Escarole, Walnuts, Red Onion & Pecorino- Refreshingly dressed and covered in a nice pecorino.   Shared it between two people. Pork Shoulder with Treviso & Aceto- Beautifully, if not a little boldly seasoned. I would suggest you not eat this as your only course. Sabato- Extremely decadent. The flavors and nothing to scoff at. The hard boiled egg salad that topped them was a refreshing counterpoint to the rich, fatty lambiness (pardon the made up words)Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage & Fennel- The low point of our order, while delicious would have been better replaced with something else. However it was still very good and sauced lightly with a very rich sauce. Butternut squash Ravioli- Amazing, easily the finest ravioli that I have had. The textures were so well foiled, buttery filling and crisp bread crumbs. Fantastic. Apician Spiced Dates & Mascarpone- This was my personal favorite. Smooth and creamy dates were accented wonderfully by the Mascarpone bedding. The sauce was a sweet reduction of raspberry that I sopped up with my fork until I saw diminishing returns. Black Pepper Panna Cotta & Rhubarb- An extremely well made panna cotta that really brought out the flavor of black pepper as paired with rhubarb. I love rhubarb, so this was a tasty treat. Lupa Tartufo- This is a no brainer. Cover frozen dairy in sweet chocolate and then mount it atop a bed of chocolate sauce and walnuts, I'm going to be a fan- and I was. Everything was shared and a there was a healthy amount of wine to wash down the cuisine. The aperitif was an adventure, something that I am glad to have tried and will continue to cultivate a palate for. I am awarding my fourth 5 star review ever to this wonderful restaurant.

4.0,10/19/2009,"Once upon a time, a long long time ago (1999), in the magical place of Greenwich Village, there lived a wise man named Mario Batali.  Mario loved his village, and wanted to give the gift of good Italian food to everyone.But giving good food to the village wasn't easy.  You see, there was an evil monster called the Darden Restaurant Group (NYSE: DRI) that had invaded the lands to the north, and had a weapon called the Olive Garden ""$9.95 Never Ending Pasta Bowl"", which had warped the hearts and minds of the neighboring town.  Those people thought that Italian food meant wilted fettucine with gloopy alfredo sauce or 'herb grilled salmon'.But Mario had the wisdom and courage to set the villagers straight and serve a dish of house marinated sardines, 'fishy' flavored, but delightfully so.  ""Ho ho!"" he exclaimed, ""try my octopus with sorrel and my platter of house cured charcuterie!""  The villagers did and they loved it (especially the headcheese from the charcuterie platter).And Mario smiled upon the villagers, and showered them with a savory and unctuous Bucatini Alla' Amatriciana and a suitably delicate, almost fluffy, skate with sweet corn.  The villagers danced in the street, drunk from the bottles of barolo and dolcetto, chosen for them by the excellently informed waitstaff.Though Mario's food was excellent, he tested the villager's nerve and patience, by making them wait (over an hour) to eat his food.  And due to the sheer enthusiasm of his guests, Mario's restaurant became quite crowded and very loud.  But the villagers understood that good food requires a little suffering, and all was right with the world.Thanks to Mario and his restaurant, the villagers were able to avoid the tyranny of the Darden Restaurant Group, and lived happily ever after.",24,49,29,Chris H.,Hong Kong,170,603,2140

In the desert department i felt that the selection was quite weak (no Tiramisu, give me a break). I had the Tartufo which was ok but did not blow me away. The restaurant praises itself as 'family style', in my opinion it is far from that. It also calls itself  'Osteria' which is also incorrect, for more information on the true meaning of Osteria visit en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Os… . Price is another issue here, I believe that sicne it is family style and on top of that Osteria  the portion/price ratio should be greater than 1. in our case it is about 0.5 . Final verdict, Lupa was nothing special.",0,0,0,Matey P.,"Flushing, NY",0,21,0
2.0,9/21/2009,"Two words...absolute disappointment. I could not believe this restaurant was tied to an iron chef. We ordered the chef's tasting menu, but did not even bother to stay for the last two courses which was the cheese and dessert course. Don't get me wrong , service was great and ambiance was nice, but the food was not impressive at all. The starter is horrible and the pasta dishes were ok. I am not sure what the craze is about here.

5.0,9/17/2009,Cool place. Cozy is the word here. I was really surprised how good the spaghetti with pomodoro sauce was. The noodles were al dente and the sauce was tangy. The bread beforehand was also great but I didn't like the olive oil. For appetizers we got octopus which was pretty good and corn with seasonal herbs. The corn was REALLY good!

5.0,9/11/2009,"My fiancé and I ended up here on a whim, after a delightful Sunday matinee of Billy Elliot.  We arrived around 7pm with no reservation, and were quickly seated in the back.  The menu was pretty intimidating considering our lack of fluency in Italian, but we were relieved to find the glossary on the back page.  There was quite a lot on the menu that we wanted to try, but we decided to be adventurous and try headcheese for the first time.  It was a lot lighter in texture than I was expecting - it literally melted in our mouths.  The flavors were rich, buttery and meaty, and lingered on my tongue.  We were both pretty pleased with ourselves for trying - and liking - something that our hero Anthony Bourdain so gleefully touts.  We also ordered the octopus appetizer, which sounded too enticing to pass up.  It was the most tender, flavorful octopus that I think I've ever eaten.  There was a bit of a kick to it too, which I wasn't expecting.  I fell in love with that dish!For our entrees, my fiancé got the orecchiette with pork sausage, which seemed so simple yet had so much flavor.  It was a really well balanced dish.  I ordered the Sunday night special of braciola, which had so many layers of rich flavor.  The herbs and spices were wonderful, and there was even a little bit of heat to it.  It was so tender, I didn't even have to use a knife.  My only complaint is that it doesn't come with starch, which I think would have helped to cut the richness of flavor.  I found that it went really well with the orechiette.  Apparently this is a very popular dish because they were sold out by around 8:30pm.  Our dessert was the black pepper panna cotta with blueberries, which provided just the right amount of sweetness to finish our meal. The service was very good - the staff was knowledgeable, helpful and friendly.  Considering the quantity and quality of food we received, we found the prices to be incredibly reasonable.  The fact that I'm still thinking about this meal a month later proves that we got more than our money's worth.  I can't wait to return and work my way through the menu!",5,2,4,Kristine R.,"Astoria, NY",299,363,1

4.0,9/4/2009,"Unlike Babbo, which exudes casual, clean sophistication, the feel of Lupa is much more laid back and homey. The space is smaller and warmer, but not intimate in the sense of something romantic - just cozy. If you don't want to know your neighboring diners intimately by the end of the meal, then this isn't the restaurant for you. But, if you enjoy eavesdropping as much as I do, or the chance to interact in some way with the people around you, then Lupa's got you covered. That comfortable, cozy feel translates directly into the food which hits the spot for traditional tratoria food. This isn't a menu that is going to have any surprises - no inventive combinations, classic no-frills plating, just your standard tratoria fare. What could become another cliche Italian restaurant is made exceptional because of their execution - each dish was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, and lived up to all of my expectations of what a Batali restaurant should be. The best comparison I can make is to Bouchon, which offers a traditionally french bistro menu where each serving is the epitome of whatever that particular dish should be.So, what did we order? My eyes were clearly larger than my stomach, as my friend and I shared a bottle of wine (they actually recommended their cheapest white wine, and it was delicious!), the beets with pistachio, the sweet corn and ricotta cheese cappallacci (ravioli), the Bucatini All' Amatriciana, the pork shoulder with treviso and aceto, and finally, the Tartufo. I think I gained 10 pounds just from writing all of that! The sweet corn pasta was the standout for me - I'm a sucker for fresh pasta and it was done just right. And, the Tartufo is not something that should be overlooked. The service was...interesting. I think our waitress and I just didn't click. Like, that person that you know is cool, but it's clear you're never going to be friends - it was a bit like that.  And the runners literally just put plates down in front of us without a smile, or a reminder about what we ordered, or anything. So, it was kind of like there was a wall between the us and the staff - which was fine because I was expecting it to be low-key, down-to-earth service. But a smile from time to time would've been nice. Although it wasn't a ""wow,"" it was solid food with a solid atmosphere and a nice way to have great Italian food in NYC without a designer price tag.",7,3,8,Kelsey E.,"San Francisco, CA",693,222,29

4.0,8/25/2009,"My first Mario experience. I've always wanted to try one of his restaurants, but I hate having to pack dressy clothing when all I want to do is bum (and eat) my way around NYC. This was a perfect compromise.There were four of us for an early dinner on Saturday night. We started out with salads, prosciutto, olives and a sweet stuffed corn pasta. The  salad consisted of escarole, walnuts, red onions, and pecorino. It was a bit bitter for my taste so Jeff finished it off. The sweet stuffed corn pasta was delicious. The menu simply said ""sweet corn"" so  this would have been completely missed if our friend didn't order it. I had their spaghetti Carbonara. After we ordered our dinner, our waiter came back to the table and asked me if I had ordered it before from Lupa. I said No and he informed that it is ""aggressively seasoned"". When I got the pasta, I felt like it was seasoned just right so apparently I'm a aggressively season kind of gal? The pasta was definitely al dente.Jeff had one of their special raviolis of the night with a pork ragu filling. He finished the entire plate, but then again, the portions weren't huge.

4.0,8/3/2009,"Well, this is a Mario Bitali joint so I guess there's a lot of hub bub about it. I was excited about going here and knowing it was a 25 food wise on Zagat gave me quite a bit to look forward to.We got there like 5 minutes early, which was a bit too early though, because the table wasn't yet ready. The fact they we couldn't get seated on time was an annoyance, but not a huge deal. We decided to take a quick walk and come back.So, the seater had told us 5 mins so we made sure to get back in 5 mins, but we wound up waiting another 15 minutes because it still wasn't ready upon our second arrival. What sucked the most was that there was no place to wait comfortably...the bar was full, and there was almost no standing room. So we stood right by the doorway as unawkwardly as we could, along with a few others who were waiting just like us.I have to say, at first glance I liked the look of the place. On the downside the vibe was a bit hectic, and it was quite noisy. There were wall to wall patrons there, which is a double edged sword; a packed place usually means the food is good, but it doesn't make the place very comfortable especially with the tables being so close together like they are at Lupa. Anyway, when they finally got a place together for us, we were more than rewarded with what I think was the best spot in the place; a cozy corner booth in the back room. We started out with a sampler of apps, which included beets and pistachios, olives, brussel sprouts, prosciutto, and some others. None really stood out for me aside from the beets and the meat which was quite tasty. I also want to mention it was served in a dish that was chipped and rather old. I thought it was a shtick to make it homey but after looking around it was clear it wasn't, it was just an old piece. Kinda lame, vibe wise. Get some new plates Mario!For an entree, I went with a veal dish called Saltimbocca and my girl got spaghetti covered in herbs and olive oil, Spaghetti Aglio e Olio. her meal was fresh and delicious, definitely one of the better spaghetti plates I ever had. It was cooked perfectly and the spice/oil level was right on the money...it was wonderful to eat. My main was AMAZING. I was eating this lovely, well seasoned, and juicy piece of veal and thinking to myself how good it was. I got through about 1/8 and realized there were also greens in butter underneath, a nice treat. Then about 1/4 of the way through, I started to wonder if the entree had any breading or flour, and in general what the coating was. Then it hit me...It was covered in prosciutto, end to end! My mouth started to water, and I then I started to go on and on about how this was the best meal I ever had. Veal, veal, veal! I was in heaven, and I think I can safely say my girl loved it too when she got some tastes.When that was all done, we got a lovely desert called Apician Spiced Dates and Mascarpone. The beauty of this dish was that it was brought out, hot and being stirred in the pan by the chef then poured onto the plate. Nice visual. I also had some coffee which was just OK.For me, the entree made the entire meal experience. Not to overstate it, but it was so good I asked my girl if she thought that could have been the best veal anywhere on the planet. She said if it wasn't, it was close. Man, it felt good to know I ate some of the worlds best food, veal that was right up there with the best of the best. The apps were just average for me, but the dessert was a success, that's important to noteNon-food stuff - The look of the place was pretty basic, but nice and pleasant. The bathrooms were tops, well decorated and notably clean for such a busy joint. They even had the usual English language signs in Italian, a nice touch. The seating was comfortable. The service was competent and relatively quick. My one gripe (as I wrote above) was the reservation not being honored on time. It was really a pain in the ass to stand around in what amounts to a cramped doorway, but it didn't kill the evening for me, the food was just that good.",1,1,1,Jeff S.,"Bucks County, PA",592,1834,584

5.0,7/30/2009,"There are few places that can actually show so many good qualities. This is not about eating Italian, and it is not about small dishes, rustic fare, Lupa is good living, period.Every dish has that soulful affection that expands in your mouth and penetrates your brain.Of course, I'm Italian and I feel it more intensely but again, hey, dinner was insanely good and spectrally various.The frutti di mare platter was just a perfect and very hefty choice of delicacies. One by one:- Home-cured baccala' was creamy, with the perfect texture and absolutely delicious- Striped bass in scabece, absolutely the creamiest fish meat ever tasted in my life with the perfect vinegary twang- Sardines with cracked wheat, alas I'm not a fan of marinated sardines but my girlfriend assured me of their absolute perfection- Octopus with chickpeas, OMG!!! Delectable texture with just the perfect ratio between beans and fish, totally not overlapping flavors but marrying in a perfect earthy/smoky experience- Tuna with cannellini, and there I was, eating what I thought it would have been the most boring appetizer and there I was realizing how wrong I was. I will kiss the hand to whoever marinated that tuna and maintained its flavor so bright.- Clams with fregola and basil, honestly the least interesting of the party but still absolutely palatable and enjoyable.Now, the main course, skate with artichokes pureed and fried alla giudia.Hyperbolic experience here where every part of the dish was singing and dancing in my mouth. The skate was just perfectly cooked and so was the artichoke. With those earthy undertones elevating the fish and never-colliding flavors. Just fantastic.If I had the right paycheck I would be a regular here, I promise.And now for the dessert, a lovely tartufo that offered a sweet surprise when a core of almond paste revealed itself.The waitress (Jamie Y) was so nice and also offered me an amaro when she realized I was from Piemonte and never heard of amaro Cora, a light and delicate nocino that ended the dinner more than perfectly.One note: Lurisia water, what a treat (tinyurl.com/kwomjx).I actually didn't mention one dish here, the marinated in scapece grilled vegetables: the reason why I kept them for last is simple, they were the most absolute revelation to me. I mean, you just wouldn't expect a marinated veggie to rock your world right? But they did and here is the recipe (tinyurl.com/m9uwuq).

3.0,7/24/2009,"Lupa is one of the most popular restaurants in the Greenwich Village serving ""Roman trattoria fare"". Behind the restaurant stand four men: Jason Denton, Mario Batali and Joseph Bastianich, and Mark Ladner. Lupa serves solid food and is somewhat more casual and less costly than some other Batali restaurants. Don't take me wrong, I have been fortunate enough to eat at Lupa four times as guest of friends within the last few years but I just don't get the herd of people waiting hours to grab a tiny table and rub elbows with the diners at the next table. Food is good but why go all the hassle that I don't get.My last visit to Lupa was on a Tuesday night so the crowds were almost non-existent but we still have to wait about twenty minutes for our table. Because most walk-ins eat at the bar, you really don't have any place to stand so you have to wait on the sidewalk for you table to be ready which could take longer than expected as in our case. It seemed like the diners before us decided to take their time with their desserts so six of us ended up waiting about forth-five minutes to actually sit down. Manager was nice enough to offer us a rose for our trouble which I did appreciate. Menu is somewhat limited to other well know Italian restaurants in the area but still offers a good selection of meat, fish and fowl. We wanted to order bunch of appetizers to share and our own main course. So our selection of starters (about $6 - $10 each) included; Ricotta Gnocchi which was better than I thought but no match for Chef Marco Canaro's gnocchi served at the Hearth. Besides the gnocchi, we ordered the Prosciutto Di Parma, Escarole, Brussels Sprouts with pecorino, Beets with pistachio, Mixed Olives, Tuna & Cannellini, They were all good choices, maybe some too salty for our taste.Main course included Pork Saltimbocca, Skate with corn & guanciale, Pollo Alla Diavola (Chicken is quiet spicy so watch out) and Martedi crispy duck ""agrodolce""(Special dish for Tuesdays, take a look at the web site for daily specials, one dish per day). For dessert we ordered Black Pepper Panna Cotta & Rhubarb, Various Sorbettos and Lupa Tartufo.Overall Lupa offers good food at moderate prices but waiting for tables even with reservations and sitting at tiny tables, placed so close to each other makes me want to think twice about going back to this place if I can convince my Lupa cult friends.I would have given four starts if I didn't have to go to all the trouble of waiting for a table and bumping in to my fellow diner at next table every so often.

We also had the baccala which was not as I remembered (I remembered a tasty puree of sorts on bread but this was just....chunks of fish. The olives and the lettuce helped, but it was not my favorite and I wouldn't order it again).We shared the cacio e peppe which I've actually salivated over just thinking about. Also as good as I remember. Also shared the market fish which was a striped bass. My friend liked it a lot and I thought it was decent but a little bit over-cooked.

They were all wonderful, the delicately seasoned cold fish was strangely lovely, and the combination of Beetroot & Pistachio was masterful, I'm sure inspire some of my own recipes in the future.We opted for Pasta as a Main (Entree) as we loved the sound of the dishes and sure we wouldn't have space for the entrees as well. I opted for the Sausage Gnocchi, and my companion for Veal Ravioli. My Gnocchi was amazing and my only complaint was that I could have eaten more, though this was simply my greediness rather than the small portions. The ravioli was lovely as described, as this is as a non veal eater.We opted for the Nero D'Avola Nausica, which was light and fruity, perfect companion to all our food.To finish we chose to share the cheeseboard, and some dessert wine. We went for Three Cheeses for $12.00: Ricotta with Honey, Coach Farm Goat Curd , Pecorino Romano. They came with Apple Sauce, Bread, & Nut Brittle, which accompanied the cheeses perfectly.

But no. I ordered the ricotta gnocchi with sausage and fennel since everybody seems to be up in a tizzy over it, and you know what? It was just okay - it was going for delicate I suppose, but to me, if something's going to be delicate, it better be interesting and build up over time. It was unsatisfying and disappointing as it was just a smidge tasty; it really could've been a home run given a bit more flavor; I barely detected any sausage (I think there were a couple of bits thrown in there) and while we're at it, damn, I could've eaten twice the portion they dished out.Tripe as a starter was decent, and the walnut salad was, well, just a salad. My family absolutely adored the tartufo dessert, which I was a little surprised about as it failed to really get me goin'. The wine was good and the service, friendly and accommodating (although the hostess kind of irked my family by refusing to seat them while they waited for me to get to the restaurant from down the block).

Although we tried to get a reservation few days ago, the only available time was too late, so we decided to go there early around 6pm(wednesday night). Luckily we got seated without much wait but the restaurant got packed quickly and was busy all throughout our meal. I suggest you get a reservation at least a week in advance! Between 3 of us, we ordered the following:1)A caraf of Morellino: I'd like to thank our waiter for recommending good wine!2)Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage & Fenneli: The best gnocchi!! Buonissimi! I loved the texture of it, so chewy like mochi and went well with the simple traditional tomato sauce. Next time I'm not sharing this, period.2)Linguine Cardoons and Razor Clam: Cosi cosi..... it didn't impress me. It lacked that distinct seafood flavor, very bland...I had better one. So not convincing that this is the famous chef's pasta. It's an interesting attempt to use baby squids, but I prefer big squid rings.3)Tagliatelle with braised pork: spicy and yummy! 4)Duck Confit: Good, but not amazing.5)Lupa Tartufo -Mmmm! Yum!6)Black Pepper Panna Cotta & Rhubarb - My favorite! Adding black pepper to panna cotta was very creative and added a nice spicyness. Loved it!7)Apician Spiced Dates & Mascarpone - minus one star for the tiny portion. It's good, but I'd skip and order more panna cotta instead.The portion size in general was tiny.

Service is really attentive; ate for 2 hours and did not feel rushed at all. A caraf of Morellino, which is comparable to a dry Merlot paired very well with our meal. We ordered 3 pastas: the gnocchi, special of day tagliatelle with braised pork, and linguine seafood. The best of course was the gnocchi. I like how yelpers call it soft pillows, bc they are indeed that way. The tagliatelle was good, but could have done without the linguine. All I tasted were noodles, where were the clams? Next time we'll just order 3 gnocchi's and skip the rest. And bc the special of the day for secondi was duck confit which I have never had, we shared it. This was a good size drum stick of a duck--and very moist--but I'd skip it and get another dish of gnocchi.We were definitely full by then...but whats a meal without dessert? I know everyone raved about the tartufo, and it was definitely good icecream-- but have you tried the panna cotta???? The black peper and rhubarb meld so well into each other, Id confidently say that it is better than tartufo.

Then the real star of the day arrived- the tartufo. Hazelnut and vanilla ice cream covered in really good chocolate with a cherry in the middle. The best part about it though? The rich chocolate hazelnut sauce around the ice cream bomb. My mom was right to be lusting after it. That little guy gets a star on its own. Was it worth the money?

I came here for a low-key dinner on Valentine's Day--it wasn't all hearts and roses and pink and over-priced prix fixe, which is a major plus in my book. If it weren't for the fact that every table was a couple, the restaurant treated it like any other Saturday night, which was great.I ordered the pork shoulder, which the server recommended to the table behind us--it's marinated in balsamic vinegar and brown sugar, and was tender and flavorful. The small bit of bitter greens on the side accompanied the meat well.The braised lamb daily special (only served on Saturdays), however, brought ""tender"" to a whole new level. The server warned that it was served with lots of fat, and it was falling-off-the bone-amazing. It was topped by a smidgen of egg salad, but it's pretty much a hard-core meat dish.We also split the lobster linguine--there were meaty pieces of lobster, which were perfectly cooked and sweet, and the pasta was just slightly underdone relative to al dente. Overall, the food was first-rate, and I'll definitely be coming back. Service was a little spastic--the server went from being very friendly with helpful information to brusque and rushed, but the overall atmosphere was perfect for an intimate dinner. It gets crowded though, so make reservations unless you're willing to take your chances with the wait.Overheard: ""Just to let you know, I loooove everything at Intermix. It's my faaaavorite store. You can't go wrong if you get me anything from there."" --high-maintenance blonde ditz to her bored-to-death WASPy boyfriend (she only ate four pieces of her ravioli; he seemed more than happy to devour the rest for her in addition to the braised lamb)Tip: The restaurant's weak spot is dessert--there were only five choices, all in the $8-9 range.

But, the place was busy and by the time we left there were people waiting at the bar. They were very accommodating and didn't rush us at all.We started our order with a foursome of: sardines with cracked wheat, brussel sprouts with pecorino, broccoli rabe with ricotta, and octopus. They were all very delicious! The sprouts came shredded and raw, well they were very well prepared and crunchy. The octopus, which I was reluctant to try because I just thought it was going to be chewy and rubbery, but instead were succulent and fresh. I don't know how they cooked it but I was so glad we ordered them because they were great! The sardines were briny and vinegar taste. I liked them but my fiance thought they were a little too big. We both loved the broccoli but a little too salty but I don't think it was that bad.I ordered the Pork Shoulder with Treviso & Aceto and my fiance got the Bavette Cacio & Pepe (spaghetti). I loved my dish but my fiance's spaghetti dish had a little too much pepper.They're wine list was pretty decent but asked the sommelier for a suggestion to go with our foursome starters... he picked a inexpensive bottle of Erta e China '06, but it went very well with our dishes.This was a much better visit than I had a couple years ago where the dishes were all too salty.",0,0,0,Aaron T.,"Los Angeles, CA",71,63,98

5.0,2/17/2009,"Lupa is my probably my favorite Italian restaurant in the city. The pasta is divine.My favorite dish is the 'bucatini al'amatriciana'. So good. Really. I know that everyone has a hard-on for bacon, I mean, who doesn't but this dish has guanciale, which is unsmoked piggy jowl, aka bacon, plus tomato sauce and some delicate onions. The pasta is cooked perfect - very much al dente, so toothy. I also love splitting the escarole, red onion, pecorino and walnut salad. Don't get it for yourself only - it's really quite large - definitely made for splitting. Lastly, all of the pesce antipasti are to-die-for (my favorites are the sardines and the baccala).

1.0,1/1/2009,"Lupa has been my favorite restaurant in New York for the last seven years. But that's because I hadn't been there in seven years...Last night I realized that either I've experienced much better food in the meantime, or this place has gone downhill:  I'm thinking a bit of both. I have a reservation for my birthday, which after the wait staff experience of last night, I will swiftly cancel. A few people (coat check girl, hostess - oh, sorry ""maitre d"") were downright rude, but most just seemed really annoyed with their jobs. I watched our waitress give each table the same tight-lipped, small, ""I'm barely tolerating this"" smile. Yuck. Overall I got the impression that this must be a horrendous place to work, or, for the younger staff, that they really wanted to feel special that they were working there, but weren't quite getting the props they felt they deserved. The gnocchi was excellent, but that was the only thing. Everything else I ate made me wish I had chosen one of the many much more comfortable, tastier, not so uptight place in my neighborhood. The tartufo that I had loved in the past now just tasted like a plate of Ferrer Rochers from Key Food. The wine tasted like any other crap glass of wine I've ever had, again, far from the delicious wine I had tasted there many years ago. The waitress seemed to know zilch about wine (just like me), and I realized as I drank it that she had most likely simply recommended the most expensive glass to me when I described what I wanted, rather than matching a glass to my desired description. The atmosphere was just horrible, besides all the miserable wait staff scowling about, we were seated about, oh, one inch away from another table. I understand this is New York City, and space is limited, but as much money as Batali has at this point, I found it insulting that he would expect such decisions to be conducive to a pleasurable dining experience. Even three inches apart would have been ok! I agree with others that the portions are somewhat small, but the dishes are reasonably priced, and as rich as they are I actually couldn't finish mine. Nonetheless, I found myself extremely antsy to leave, because I felt so hungry!  And couldn't take being surrounded by so many unhappy faces.

Alas, as this is an establishment where everything is supposedly seasoned properly they do not supply salt on the table. My bf got the special of the day, which was duck...he said it was just ok.

5.0,12/11/2008,"Lupa is a wonderful experience.  It's my roommate's favorite restaurant and for her birthday she wanted to have a meal there.  We were there on a Wednesday night and we arrived a bit early for our reservation, so we squeezed in at the bar where we were promptly given menus and served prosecco.  Our table was ready at 9:30 on the dot, and we were seated at a quiet corner table away from the main traffic of the dining room.  The decor of the place is simple but good: lots of brick, archways, wood and rustic colors give the feeling of warmth and comfort, and the decor matches the simple and hearty food perfectly.  A fireplace with freshly burning logs would not be out of place here at all.  The ambience is busy, festive and elegant but not too loud or too stuffy at all.  It's quality food in a casual, comfortable, unassuming environment and that is a nice balance that many restaurants find it hard to strike.  I've been to places where the food is good but the decor is just trying too hard.  I've been to other places where the food is mediocre and the decor is perfect.  Lupa has it just right and anyone could be comfortable dining there.The fare you get at Lupa is simple, no-nonsense Italian food done perfectly.  Everything they do, they do well, and they don't try to pull off dishes or tastes that they don't have a clear point of view on.  Because it was a late dinner for us, our order was simple.  We had the olives plate for an appetizer, and the marinade for the olives was a simple olive oil and a few herbs.  There was something lovely about eating those olives.  They all tasted fresh and distinct from one another in flavor and because they were brought to the table immediately after we ordered we had time to really enjoy them.  We also loved their house bread -- a really thick, fluffy focaccia that comes with more of that yummy olive oil they use for the olives.  They did ask us if we wanted more bread, but we said no because we were trying not to walk out of there stuffed!My main course was the linguine with pepper (I think it's called the bavette) and it was awesome.  I've never been one who likes a million things in my pasta.  My feeling has always been that if you have really good quality pasta and fresh ingredients, you only need the pasta, a good sauce and very little else.  There were no vegetables or any other extras in my pasta, but the sauce and seasonings were perfect.  They bathed the linguine in a thick, buttery, lemony sauce that clung nicely to the noodles, and they didn't use too much or too little of the sauce.  Then, they shook a whole lot of freshly cracked black pepper onto the pasta and mixed it all up -- the result being a delicately flavored pasta that had a nice kick to it all the same.  My roommate ordered the bucatini and said it was pretty good but she thought my pasta was the winner at the table.For dessert my roommate insisted we needed to get the ricotta with honey.  We did, and that same combination of perfect and simple that we had already experienced in the atmosphere, appetizer and dinner was evident.  The cold, creamy ricotta tasted so fresh and was not runny or watery, was laced with just the right amount of honey and came with three pieces of crusty bread.  It was a delicious combination and I kept thinking that it seemed like the perfect thing to have for breakfast; but as a dessert it was a nice finish to the meal.I would have loved to try one of their fish appetizer dishes -- at $10 each and with some interesting seafood/veggie combinations it would have been nice -- but we were afraid of ordering too much food.  And I have to tell you, they gave us a very tall bowl of olives, very decent-but-not-too-big bowls of pasta and a nice helping of ricotta with our bread.  We were very pleasantly stuffed by the time we left.Service was polite, prompt and friendly.  I appreciated that we were treated just like everyone else even though we weren't wearing cashmere sweaters, suits, diamond studs or expensive watches like the other clientele in the place.  The food at Lupa left me intrigued because of its perfect balance between quality and simple, rustic and gourmet, flavorful but spare.  I've also tried Otto, another Batali restaurant, and I don't remember being nearly as impressed.  There's something about Lupa that's just right and I will be back to try some other dishes.  I hope they are as good as what I ate on this visit!",2,1,2,elise h.,"New York, NY",52,243,6

The place was packed. The hostess said we could be seated at the communal table so we headed over - nothing like being seated immediately upon arrival. We were seated right in the middle of the large communal table at the front of the restaurant. Everyone seemed friendly enough, probably bc we all knew what we were signing up for when we sit in a communal table. The place was nice and dim and had that standard 'italian restaurant' feel - and for some reason the volume level was surprisingly low and comforting- i'd say a 4. It was nice that no one was trying to scream over each other. The bread and dipping oil was nice and fresh; and as I walked to the back for the restroom I saw that they had a huge meat slicer next to the bar with this enormous chunk of prosciutto. It was amazing. Although I didn't order it, I saw it served to many tables and it looked delicious. I ordered the bucatini and it was the perfect portion. They said the sauce was spicy, and although it wasn't that spicy to me (that's only because I eat sriracha chili sauce with everything from eggs to ramen noodles) it was very savory and flavorful. I opted not to have an appetizer because I knew I was going to get the cheese plate for dessert. Amazing dessert: ricotta with honey, coach farm goat curd, and robiola a du latte, served with toasted bread, apple compote, and almond/pistachio brittle. It was amazing. Can I say amazing one more time? I won't. OK i will. It was amazing.The waitress was super friendly and helpful with her suggestions, and the bus-boys were on point with keeping my water glass constantly 2/3 full.All in all a good dining experience.

On the other hand, the chicken alla diavola was really dry and not impressive. Desserts were also varied but were just aight. Although the restaurant quickly got packed, we were never rushed to leave. I had to step out to take a conference call sometime just before dessert was served and because I was going to take a while, I was worried that the group would have overstayed our welcome in light of the need to turn tables but my worries were unfounded and it was nice to savor dessert apres the call.Oh, did I forget to mention that the staff was most helpful in accomodating our group and settling the gigantic baby stroller one of our friends had by the table.",3,1,3,Laur T.,"New York, NY",26,780,0

I realize that sometimes table camp out but when you make a reservation a month ahead of time you expect things to run a little smoother.

4.0,11/14/2008,"I have been wanting to take a bite into the world of Batali cuisine and found this a great entrance into his culinary vision.  In a spur of the moment decision, my friend and I decided to grab a Saturday lunch at Lupa.  The dining room is a rustic, Italian-style home-away-from-home.  Though a bit cramped at the communal table (that is what happens when you do not have reservations!), I enjoyed sitting next to a young family, international travelers, etc.  It just added to the cozy experience...and believe me, that is not something I would normally be advocating.In terms of the service, our waiter was extremely attentive, possibly to the point of being a bit much.  However, he was also friendly and provided some great recommendations.The meal started with some delicious Parmesan-topped foccachia bread.  I then started with the Baccala with Potatoes, which contained massive chunks of Baccala and large Yukon potatoes.  They were in a very light mayo-ish sauce.  I enjoyed this new spin on potato salad, but thought it needed some more seasoning...pepper, perhaps?  My friend ordered some of the sliced Italian meats, which were delicate and full of flavor.  For an entree, I tried the Skate with Clams & Rabe.  The skate was lightly sauteed and full of flavor.  The dish was out-of-this-world!  My friend ordered the Spaghetti alla Carbonara, which we found bland.  The spaghetti was perfectly cooked, but the sauce was more like a meat sauce than the traditional ham and cream Carbonara we are used to.  The dessert menu was not really enticing, but the cheese selection sounded quite interesting.I would definitely return to Lupa to try the dinner or enjoy the delicious skate again.  The cozy environment also makes it an appeal place to escape the fall chill.",1,1,1,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

Both Bavette Cacio & Pepe (the kind where fresh black pepper actually makes it spicy which I like) and Spaghetti Carbonara (the non-creamy kind which lets you taste the pancetta) were al dente, simple and comforting - again, just the way I like my pasta!  I am yet to appreciate good grappa?  I rarely like dessert drinks, why do I keep doubting myself?  L'Arzente J.

He had tomato soup which while excellent as a soup would have been great as a pasta sauce. I had buffalo mozzarella with pine nuts, arugula and red onion. A surprisingly tasty combination. A little while later our pastas arrived. I had bucatini with a spicy tomato and pancetta sauce. It was very good, the pasta was very al dente and the portion was just the right size. I also took a bite of the spaghetti con aglio e olio and it was a garlic lovers dream. Although we were ridiculously full we had to try a dessert and decided on the tartufo.

It's good in concept - the room is fun and warm and fits the menu, it's a great vibe. Generously speaking. The service is inattentive, slightly impatient, and the menu is not revealing. I think a little insight to your meal is only fair. Anyway, you deal, it's casual. The problem is that the food is so salty that I almost have to wonder. Isn't salt the original preservative? Bread doesnt need to be that salty, but when it is you dip it in olive oil to balance. And that is much of the Batali experience to me. The caccio i pepe pasta is wildly peppery, like your mouth will protest but your brain will keep going. This is what happens with salty spicy pasta, you can't stop but it's not what I would call a light or unique or fresh tasting meal. It's perfectly al dente, and it's nice to sit at the bar and eat.

4.0,9/7/2008,"Lupa in Italian means werewolf.  Don't ask me why it is named that, ask Mario Batali.As scary as that name is, the restaurant is hardly as frightening.  One walks into a dark yet inviting greeting area and bar and is led past the kitchen hall and into a comfortable dimly lit room.  Ceilings were abnormally high and lightning gave off a romantic hue that allowed for a comfortable meal. The wine list was long and personally, I have problems knowing which bottle to order.  After describing what we were looking for, a white was recommended and it was spot on.  We ordered the parma and peccorino sauteed asparagus for our 2 appetizers.  I discovered that the parma was cured in Italy and flown here for our eating pleasure!  Now, if you think that is amazing, the meat was thinly sliced and melted slightly in the mouth.  The consistency was chewy but not dense and slightly salty.  The asparagus was not completely cooked, leaving a bite to it.  Combined with the cheese, it was a bit cheezy; a bit salty.For my entree, I opted to have the orchiecette (pigs ears) with fava beans and a protein.  For some reason I can't remember what that was, which leads me to believe it wasn't memorable enough.  While the dish was fine and very tasty, it was not unlike most pastas I've had elsewhere.  Unfortunately, with the Batali name come the Batali expectation.  We almost half expect him to be in the kitchen and churning out these creations himself in his orange clogs. Don't get me wrong, it was a great meal, a wonderful experience with delightful company.  Service was top notch, not to mention quite pleasant and gracious (only one would understand that)... the time spent there was overall lovely.  I have no complaints other than my desire to see the kitchen door open slightly and catch a glimpse of something orange -  perhaps hair, perhaps clogs.

Half-way through I discovered a nasty looking red and pink undercooked portion, which I was told was a ""vein"" that had somehow escaped the chef's eye. Lovely. They took it back for me and either recooked it or gave me a new (small) portion. They were kind enough to apologize and were gracious enough about the whole thing. I wasn't particularly upset.

4.0,8/30/2008,"Lupa ""Osteria Romana"" is the laid-back little brother of Babbo, that wildly successful pan-Italian brainchild of Mario Batali. Since this is a *Roman* restaurant, the focus here is on the cuisine of Rome's home region--Lazio. I've been here a few times, and--with the exception of one Friday night--found getting a table without a reservation to be remarkably easy.It's a dimly-lit space, fashionably cramped, with a bustling bar area. But I'm here to review the food because, well, that's just about all I really remember--after all, it's been over a year since I lived in these parts.My ordering was a little unconventional--my standard would consist of two ""piatti primi,"" part of the ""pasta"" course of a full Italian meal, but perhaps their categorization of the menu was unconventional, because no pasta is to be found in their veal sweetbreads.So, on with a brief overview of what I'd have each time I'd go:1. Bucatini all'amatriciana: a hearty dish of plump spaghetti-like noodles, rich with tomato, onion, and guanciale--smoked pig cheeks. Really, it's not terribly different from bacon, and that smoky chewiness is what makes the dish. Supposedly it's one of their most popular items.2. Animelle (veal sweetbreads): Sauteed in beurre-noisette, with ramps (a type of leek). The brown butter gives a smoky flavor to the sweetbreads--hey, don't hate on thymus glands, they're grrrrreat! I seem also to remember there having been something like pecans or almonds in the crisp coating. In any event, they're divinely succulent and have a texture that is somewhat intermediate between a chicken breast and a properly-cooked liver.3. Spiced Apician Dates with Mascarpone: It is what they say it is. 'Nuff said.Service, as I remember it, was attentive but dry.

I ended up ordering blindly on the off the menu because of it. When i asked her what wine she recommends she said ""they are all nice...i would just choose either white or red"". The appetizer platter we ordered was nothing but dissapointing. It looked as if they went to whole foods and just tossed a few items from their kitchen on to our table. A major letdown. The pasta dish i had ordered was among one of the worst dishes i have ever had.

I would even say the pasta at Otto is better. That's just me. Started off with the sweet corn and chili antipasto, it was good, not great. It literally is what it is, cold sweet corn kernels and minced chilis. Had the bucatini (spelling?), it was a bit too al dente for my taste. The sauce was very good, (spicy tomato/onion) but in words of Bourdain, a good sauce cannot save a poor noodle, not to say this was poor, but I couldn't get over the hard center.Next, had the special for the day, the rack of lamb. As far as lamb goes, it was melty, came right off the bone, had a nice acidity to cut some of the grease, but the fatty greasy-ness was just too overwhelming for me. 6 times out of 10, I'll eat the globs of fat, but this time was just a little too much for me. Actually after eating it, I couldn't get the feeling off my lips. This is a personal bias, so don't take my word for it. Finally ended with the black pepper panna cotta with stone fruit. Sounds weird, but it was very good, cool, refreshing, and at time, you tend to get some bite from the pepper. Overall, a nice dining experience, but it was nothing I was wow-ed by.

Their perception of us is still stuck at a point in time and the resulting mental image doesn't change till they get a rude jolt.So, thank you, yelp for giving me the platform to do the mature act of sticking my thumb out at all the cynical friends, who endured my painful and obstinate insistence on a better dining establishment with jokes like: ""Chill! You've got zag_t up your ass""! To, all you cynics: nyah nyah nyah nyah... pffft! :PAnd to all you yelpers, Thank you.... you like me, right now, you really like me!Ok, ok, so how is this related to Lupa? My friend (above) and I got 'I, Robot' as our server when we visited. ""The man couldn't care if we were dead or alive or whether he had bumped an elbow into us while retreating from the table right next to us"". Said my friend who is an active follower of 'The Art of Living', and one of the most laid back people one can ever find in life.  Unsmiling throughout, it appeared that Mr. Sourpuss hated to be there that day and would probably have had a great career in the arts if it weren't for serving ingrates like us. He had trouble responding to our questions on the menu choices, had to be asked about the bread, and disappeared for lengths of time. Finally, when I ordered their (sublime) Tartufo for dessert, he had the temerity of asking me whether or not I should ask my friend first, before doing so!!!!Being a Mario Batali establishment you obviously are going to get good to great food. The dishes that are popular here include: Beets with Pistachio, cured meats (Prosciutto, coppi), Ricotta Gnocchi with sausage and fennel, Bucatini All' Amatriciana, Pork Saltimbocca... so for vegetarians and people who don't eat pork (moi), selection can be somewhat limited.But a sublime dining experience extends beyond the food to the ambience and service. Given the indifferent service, chattering crowds, lack of room and absence of a sense of relaxation, Lupa has ""Miles to go before I sleep"".

I decided on the asparagus with pecorino as a starter and the linguine with mussels.Both were delicious, the linguine had chopped up pieces of jalapeno pepper, which created a spicy sauce.Mmmmmmm,not too spicy but the heat was an added touch.My friend ordered the ricotta gnocchi with sausage and fennel, it was OK.A bit bland and not a lot of flavor. For dessert our waitress suggested the cantelope sorbet, mmmmmmm.Creamy and sweet, it was the perfect ending to our dinner. Our waitress was helpful and accommodating.

Before we even got there, the service was excellent.  They were accommodating of our large group (boyfriend and cousins were also coming) and printed up special tasting menus for us that said ""Happy Mothers' Day!"".  They also allowed me to pre-order a bottle of prosecco for the table, so it would show up as a fun surprise!  Everyone loves fun surprises, especially when fun surprises involve alcohol.The rest of our meal was just spectacular.  $35 pp got us 4 courses, which started with an incredible antipasti--prosciutto and salumi, olives, marinated tuna, artichokes and onions, raw asparagus with ricotta and some very tasty foccaccia bread.  Next course was ricotta gnocchi in a fennel sausage sauce--light, pillowy and delicious--and then our secondi--pork shoulder, tilefish or chicken.  I had the pork, and I WON!  It was so tender that it was literally falling apart, and so savory it that almost tasted more like short ribs.  YUM.

2.0,4/14/2008,"This will come as a shocker, but I was very disappointed with Lupa.  I called 3 times and made 3 different reservations, always hoping I would get a better time slot.  You can only call 1 month in advance to make reservations and even if you call at 10am on the dot (when lines open), you will still have trouble getting through (it took me 4 min to actually get through).I went there with my husband and in-laws for a special meal.  We had a 9:30pm reservation, which didn't seem so late, seeing that those without reservations were looking at eating at 11pm!  First off, I don't know what the deal is with the main room being first-come-first-serve and the back room being for reservations only.  The hostess was very gracious and kept telling us the party at the table we had reserved was paying and should be leaving any time now.  Anytime turned into 30 min, and I saw a couple of other parties get seated first in the first-come-first-serve area.  Not sure what the process is, but the 30 min delay did put me in a bad mood and we were finally seated in the first-come-first-serve area, which didn't make any sense to me (if we, who had a reservation could be seated there, why didn't they sit us there in the first place???).Then came the waitress.  She was an older lady who promptly came to ask if we wanted WATER (of course we did), but who took about 10 min to come back and ask us if we were ready to order.  While she spoke to us, she kept looking all around her.  Maybe she had a wandering eye or some type of congenital disability that prevented her from focusing on our table,  but somehow, I don't think that was the case. The aloofness of our waitress was somehow redeemed by the busboy, who kept our water glasses full and our bread baskets coming.We started out with the prosciutto croquettes, which were too meat-heavy for me.  If you want the BEST croquettes, go to Tia Pol.   Then came the beets with pistachio, which was delicious, so I'll overlook the fact that we shared ONE beet amongst the 4 of us.I ordered the fish of the day, and it wasn't until 15 min later that I was told they were OUT of the fish of the day, but had grouper instead.  ""Same preparation,"" I was told, in an attempt to assure me that it would be just as delicious.  It was tough and bland.  The fava beans that came with it were minimal (I counted 8-10).  My husband and father-in-law both got the Lamb Shortribs (Saturday's special), which were interestingly prepared with a barbecue sauce.  They were very good.  My mother-in-law got the Pollo a la Diavola, which she commented tasted like breast meat.  After one taste I realized what she meant:  the chicken was dry and did not live up to its ""devilish"" name.  Dessert was also a bit of a disappointment.  The panna cotta was more like a flan, too sweet and should not have been called a panna cotta.  The tartufo (ice cream covered in chocolate), however, was excellent and enough for 4 people.  I understand this is a Batali restaurant, but after all the hype and my own experience there, I don't think Lupa will be on my list of top restaurants.",3,0,1,Kelly C.,"Seattle, WA",12,56,0

Great!Came back about 40 minutes later (my bf was running late), and lucky us, we were told while the current wait for the bar was about 20 minutes, a table had opened up, but had an ""8:30 stop time"" because of a private party. No problem, it was only 7:10pm. After a long, frustrating and stressful work day, things were finally looking up for us.We ordered sparkling water and were quickly served some foccacia with rosemary. We were impressed by our waitress' ability to list all of the day's specials from the top of her head - there were 2 pasta specials, 2 special sides, and a couple of fish/meat specials, and she gave us all the detail without pausing. We ordered a bottle of white, on her recommendation, and we loved the selection. We also asked which pastas were fresh made vs. dried, and what were her favorites on the menu. She was very friendly and helpful.For food, we ordered the 2 special sides - fried brussel sprouts and roasted hen of the woods mushrooms. For mains, we each ordered pasta - the bavette cacio e pepe for him, the special, fresh oricchiette with pork sausage and a few greens for me. The waitress told us our pastas would take about 15 minutes to prepare, so if we were starving she could send out the sides first, as appetizers. BF was starving so we went for that option. I love brussel sprouts, in fact, I make them at home all the time, but had never had them fried. They were delicious, with a bit of lemon and a pinch of crushed red pepper. I will be trying to replicate this at home, but not fried. The mushrooms were meaty and deep in flavor, very good. Just as we polished these off, our pastas arrived. The bevette is great, cheesy and peppery, but not greasy or anything, a very simple and tasty dish. My oricchiette was fantastic, that wonderful texture of fresh made pasta, perfectly cooked, and the sausage added some great flavors (and a little salt and grease to coat the pasta) to the dish. Yummy!Service was great, they have just enough people in there to keep an eye on you and pace things without making you feel rushed, and without you ever having to look up to flag someone. The bussing staff came to take dishes away a couple minutes after we'd finish so you didn't feel like they were stalking you, and they even scooped the crumbs off the table. Our waitress had our bottle of wine chilling in ice somewhere away from the table, and she was great about keeping our glasses full. After we finished our food, we just savored the rest of the wine. We were far too full for dessert. Our check came, and we paid and were getting up to leave at exactly 8:30, just in time for that private party to come in.A great meal with amazing service was the perfect antidote to a very stressful day of work. Everything was wonderful, and we will definitely be back for more!",0,0,0,Jennifer L.,"New York, NY",26,290,0
3.0,3/25/2008,"Ok you know you're going to get at least decent food at most of the Batali spots (except Otto which, unabashedly, sucks) but I must say that I was pretty let down. On top of the fact that the dishes just seemed uninspired, my pasta, which was pretty good, was this lilliputian serving that I just couldn't get behind. I mean, if you're paying $18 for a pasta dish and you're getting 2 - 3 ounces of the 'lamb ragu', couldn't you at least get a decent bowl of it?On top of that, the hostesses were pretty impossible and I found their excuses and constant avoidances pretty annoying. In general, I wouldn't go back there if I could avoid it. The thing is that, its not even a bad place and if you go there, I don't think one would be hugely disappointed, but why would you pay $100 per head for only decent food?

The service we received was rather disappointing. Our waitress was cold and I got the sense that she was impatient while taking our orders, and we did not even bother her with too many questions. In the end she also did not ask if we needed anything else before giving us the tab. Some good and bad with the food. I did not like the gnocci, but I'm biased and usually do not order gnocci. The appetizer with raw scallops and crispy pancetta and mushrooms was okay, a bit overwhelming. Themisticanza salad with light vinegarette was bland.

5.0,1/30/2008,"Good luck trying to get a seat here on short notice... I tried to make reservations, but everything was booked for days!!! they told me to give them a call back at night and in the morning after they confirmed their reservations... no luck.  They ended up telling me to just come in as I could wait for a table, but it would probably be about an hour and a half wait.  As soon as we arrived we saw people hanging outside the door already. We tried our luck and went as a walk in guest and they were able to accommodate us at a communal table with two other parties on both sides. The only stipulation was that they needed the table back for a party by 7 pm which we would have been finished eating by that time anyhoo.The place is pretty small, dimly lit, with a large bar area (in relation to total space), and a few tables... which Im guessing is why it is such a long wait and reservations fill up quickly.  I guess I should note that we only tried this place by a recommendation from a friend who said he had the best dinner of his life here, but forgot to mention exactly what he had ordered.  One thing I noticed was that I didn't understand ANYTHING on the menu and had to refer to a nice little glossary which was placed in the back of the menu for everything.  Maybe it was just me? but I highly doubt it.  To start the meal off almost like every other Italian restaurant you will encounter is the bread and dish of olive oil.  I don't know what kind of olive oil or what they put in it, but it is the best tasting olive oil I have ever had... and im sure others will agree with me. The bread was plentiful and moist and the waiter didn't hesitate to ask us if we wanted more bread which we anxiously accepted ""Oh, dont forget the olive oil!"" We settled on one of the specials which was a linguini dish with shredded pork (think pulled pork type deal) and one with a thick spaghetti mixed with beef in a tomato/spicy sauce.  i forgot the actual name of the spaghetti dish, but the taste was a tad bit over powering, but still good to say the least.  I had also ordered a side of potatoes which came in a small cup and it was slightly breaded and fried to perfection.  We ended up skipping dessert because we filled ourselves up on sooooo much bread, but all in all we had a great meal and a great evening.",0,0,0,Steven T.,"Orange County, CA",366,467,1212

The next day we came to Lupa and again were overwhelmed by the salt. Is it Batali? I don't know why everything has to be covered in salt, even vegetables and salad. We started off with scallops and proscuitto, and the escarole salad. Nothing that blew me away. For entrees my sister and I shared the Saltimbocca and Spaghetti en pomodoro. The Saltimbocca was more salty than anything, we couldn't even taste the sage that was supposedly in there. The spaghetti was decent, but even then still salty. Even the roasted cauliflower was salty. I just can't get past it. I did like how they had a glossary in the back that helped you decipher the menu.

5.0,1/3/2008,"I have yet to try Del Posto, but I'll still make the claim -- Lupa is Mario Batali's best restaurant.  This is top-notch Italian food (but not your typical fare... this is the real Roman stuff) that even the picky wannabe food critic in me can't find any fault in.  I've been here for both lunch and dinner and I've never been disappointed.  It's such a satisfying, delicious meal and one of those meals that makes you feel good.  It's restaurants like these that make me understand why we have celebrity chefs and why NYC is such a great restaurant town.  Yes, it's still tough to get a reservation here.  But for food this good, it's worth a bit of effort -- call way in advance, go for lunch (still a bit crowded but less so than during dinner), sit at the bar, or be open to a super early or late dinner.  Once you do get in somehow, go crazy and try a bit of everything to share with the table.  It's probably not a place you'll visit on a frequent basis so you might as well.  Yes, I am a glutton, not to mention, my eyes are bigger than my stomach usually.A few stand-out dishes I have had there include:CARNE (meat): their prosciutto di parma is amazingVERDURE (veggies): love love their parsnips, and the brussel sprouts (two of my recently discovered favorite vegetables)PESCE: really good octopus w/ sorrel and scallopsPRIMI: you can't go wrong w/ the pastas here... bucatini, linguini, tagliatelle, etc... they're all cooked and flavored perfectly.  i also suggest you consider the daily specials since the kitchen seems to do a great job of taking advantage of seasonal ingredients.SECONDI: i usually go for the fish.  i believe the skate was really good as well as the trout.  i've heard great things about veal so will have to try that next time.  I didn't think highly of their desserts; thus, I'd recommend you opt for a dessert wine from their extensive wine menu.  You'll probably be so full from the meal anyways that a drink might be easier to stomach than more food.Service is pretty good usually and the price is not bad... esp when compared to Babbo, the sister restaurant, or any of the other Batali spots (except Otto... which I am not a big fan of).  The ambiance here is also great... rustic, warm, traditional but not stuffy, and full of good energy.  I'm going to attribute it to all the happy diners that are in food bliss as they enjoy their meals here.  Mario has done it again... Esca, Babbo, Casa Mono / Bar Jamon, and Lupa... all some of my favorite meals I've had in the city... only leads to very high expectations for Del Posto!",4,1,4,camilla c.,"New York, NY",171,336,1

The desert Panna Cotta was bland. The ambiance was nice, with pretty good music in the background. Of course, this place, like so many others, faced with space limitations, has to seat you uncomfortably close to the people at the next table.

For our main courses, we ordered a seafood spaghetti and broiled trout with olives.  Every single item we had was delicious, and tasted like it was carefully prepared, and didn't give you that heavy feeling in your stomach that Italian food usually do.  Portions were not oversized which is what I like.   My favorite dish was the trout, and I can't say that I've come close to tasting any quite like it.  I will definitely look forward to coming here each time I'm in the Big Apple.  Be sure to try their homemade lemon sorbetto to end a perfect meal.",1,0,1,Nancy G.,"San Francisco, CA",136,100,3

I decided to have an early lunch before heading out to the Cloisters Museum so drove into the city admiring the beautiful weather. Parking didn't look like it was going to come easily so I was dropped off to claim a table.I wasn't too happy with the table we got. It was in front of the doorway leading into the back room but I made do with it. Service was prompt and although I was sitting at the table alone for awhile, our server came around to check on me and take my drink order. The prosecco is a good bet although I wouldn't recommend the Bellini. The peach nectar muddied up the bright notes of the prosecco and it wasn't quite as enjoyable as I thought it'd be. I love the bread here. It looks like focaccia but instead of being greasy and spongy like many other places, the crust tastes like a biscuit, flaky and buttery, and the inside is soft, almost like a baguette. We started off with an insalate of lettuce, shaved bottarga (fish roe), and a warm dressing with chickpeas. It was savory and refreshing at the same time, a slight astringency complementing the richness of the dressing. We also ordered from the Pesce list and we ordered the Baccala with potatoes. I absolutely loved this dish. The cod was flaked but was thick and meaty, and the sliced potatoes proved to go well with it. The whole thing was drizzled with olive oil and lemon juice, with some capers and flat leaf parsley. Fresh and absolutely delicious.For me, ordering pasta at any Mario Batali restaurant is a must and I'm doubly glad we did at Lupa. Our handmade tagliatelle with roasted pork ragu was my favorite dish of the entire meal. We split one order which was the perfect amount although it was so good I wanted another bowl. The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente and the ragu was rich, savory, and hearty. I wanted to run my tongue around my bowl. Instead, I used a bit of bread. We ordered Secondis and when the food came out I sort of wished we'd just stopped at the pasta. My Pork Saltimboca looked good but it was huge. I definitely wasn't expecting it to be so big. It was the size of a dinner plate. It was well-seasoned and the crust was slightly crisp and you could definitely taste the sage. The whole thing came atop of some kind of braised green, I think it might have been escarole but I can't be sure. It proved to work well with my pork and cut through some of the fat. I didn't really like the roast pork dish that we ordered. It was roasted to perfection sure, but the sauce (?) that came on top of it was didn't go well with it. When I first saw it, I thought it was a sort of tomato sauce but when I tasted it the flavors of ginger and cinnamon were over-powering. It was also cold, tart, and sweet. I think it was pickled cactus pear...? For me, the flavors didn't work but that was just personal taste. By the time we finished everything, I was stuffed.The meal was good and the service was prompt and courteous. We'll drop in again but we'll probably be ordering only pasta.

If I could find an Italian place that was half as good as Lupa and was twice as much, I would gladly pay for it here in Austin.That said, I come into NYC quite a bit for work and this is one of my MUST places to eat. I like the fact I can stroll in anytime and at worst, wait a bit at the bar where they always treat you right.I can't really recommend anything in particular since everything I've tasted is incredibly yummy and unique. Seriously. There's not much on the menu that leaves you thinking ""oh, I have cooked this"" or ""this looks easy to make"". From the salad with beef cheek to the boar ragu, it's all goooood.What I will recommend is that anything you see on the menu do not think ""that looks odd so I won't try it"" most likely, the more unique something is to you, the more surprised you'll be once you try it.Can't wait to eat there next week!Uptdate:Went back to NYC for work for the week (week after original posting above) and this place hasn't missed a step. Good grief, the food was top notch, service was excellent and if this place isn't easily top 10 best places to eat in the city then I need to try more places (which I have!).

Since I noticed that most people who waited hours for a table were showing up around 7:30pm and later, I figured coming earlier would be ideal.As soon as we walked up, we put our name on the list and asked for our wait time. Wait time = 1 hour.However, as soon as I turned around to walk out the door, the man (he might have been the manager or one of the owners? Sorry that I don't know) motioned me to the bar area and said that we could eat right away if we dined there.Perfectly fine with us! Whoo hoo!Apparently, there is usually a wait for dining at the bar as well so it was nice to be served immediately. Plus, I was really hungry and everything smelled soooooooooooooooooooo good!As soon as we made ourselves comfortable, we ordered terrific drinks and apps per our server's recommendations. We had the tomato salad (whoops - can't recall its' official name) and the marinated eggplant (yum!). There are 2 kinds of marinated eggplant and we had the warm version (aka fried). The other kind is served cold. For dinner, I chose the Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage & Fennel. OMG, it was so DELISH!!! I tried to eat it slow to savor each bite but it was so darn yummy that I couldn't help myself and instead, I devoured it! The only thing I would change about that dish would be to double the serving size!Then came desert and I went with the Lupa Tartufo. I hope that was the name of it because it's perfect for chocolate lovers like me! The servers were wonderful and our all-around experience at Lupa was Fabulous!

2.0,7/22/2007,"I picked this place out for a Restaurant Week visit based on the very large assortment of gushing Yelp reviews. I was distinctly underwhelmed. I loved the focaccia and excellent olive oil, but it was downhill from there.My first course was tuna with cannellini beans, which tasted exactly like tuna and white beans; there's not much to be said for it. My friend had the oxtail terrine, which was a bit more interesting but not stellar. It had some sort of unusual green leaves and a vinaigrette dressing. Then I had the gnocchi. They had a great flavor and texture to the dumplings and a tangy tomato sauce, but I wished for more sauce and more of the purported sausage in the sauce. My friend's second course was penne with salt and cracked pepper, which was good, but just a little too al dente.I've forgotten the fancy Italian name of the meatball with cannellini beans that was my main course. It was okay, but unexceptional. The beans, again, were lackluster. My friend's fish was similarly unmemorable. My dessert was the tartuffini, which was chocolate and hazelnut and was a solid four-star dessert. The other dessert, ricotta with honey, was served with thin slices of a warm baguette and was very, very good.The poor service knocks this down to two stars. We had to flag down our server to order, to get water, and to get our check. The pacing of the meal was also very slow; at one point, my friend actually asked if we could have our next dish. We had a reservation and still had to wait about 15 minutes. For a 2:00 reservation, we didn't leave the restaurant until 4:00 -- and not because we were lingering, either.Sorry, Yelpers, I won't be back.",0,0,0,Cheryl C.,"Chicago, IL",23,152,11

The proscuitto is delicious, salted and cured perfectly. Some of the best i have had. For my entree i get the Pollo Alla Diavolla. It's a breast and thigh, marinated in olive oil and coated (skin on) in pepper. it's then roasted for about 20 minutes. Perfectly juicy and tender, the pepper and olive oil taste is amazing. For dessert, i say go for one of 2 options. the Tartufo, which is quite decadent, or the gelato (flavor changes routinely). For drink, they have a pretty nice wine selection, usually with a few good ones by the quartino. It's crowded, bit cramped, generally bit of a wait, but completely worth it all. the patio is nice if you can grab it too...This is also priced very reasonably.

One is perfect to share.I've definitely eaten my way around most of the menu. Definite highlights include - the grande cured meat plate (the proscuitto is still unrivaled in my book), some tongue thing (amazing! I think it was a special), heirloom tomato salad (when in season), BUCATINI (my default pasta), the ""ear-shaped"" pasta with pork sausage (a common special which is my #1 pasta choice), the square-shaped spaghetti with morels, the tartufo (my default dessert), the wine list, the fantastic olive oil (earthy, grassy) served with foccacia (thank goodness they don't serve that thin foccacia they had for a while in late 2005 / early 06?), peach and seasonal bellinis (i.e. rhubarb). The food speaks for itself. It's robust, hearty and straightforward. The service is very knowledgable and helpful. The atmosphere is warm & lively, but can feel loud and cramped if you don't know what you're getting yourself into.I've eaten in a lot of places in NYC, but Lupa is my favorite because of the food, wine selection, relaxed atmosphere and reasonable pricing. I've had pasta for lunch for $14, and I've also gone on gastronomic adventures for $100pp.  Either way, it's still wonderful.I remember the days when a walk-in didn't require a one-hour wait.

She actually cancelled her Bar Americano reservations for tomorrow so she can go to Lupa again! Another convert. Go check out Lupa, it really is a gem!",1,0,1,Vivian L.,"San Mateo, CA",42,840,1746
5.0,1/15/2007,"Thank you, to the divine miss Heather H for popping my Batali cherry.  Generally I can't be bothered with hypey restaurants.  I don't want to have to wait for a reservation.  I do not worship at the alter of Batali.  I will not sell my left testicle for a 9pm reservation on a Saturday night in December.  But for that gnocchi, I might part with a finger.  Maybe two.  This is one of the better meals I've had in a while.  We came for lunch on a cold and rainy MLK day and decided to go hog-wild.  We created our own tasting menu - three appetizers, one pasta, two entrees and a desert.  About $45 each.  Not too shabby for what's supposed to be a very pricey restaurant.  Yes, I know it was lunch.  Shut-up.And the food.  Wow.  I mean wow.  Everything was scrumptious.  From the beets & pistachios antipasti, to the gnocchi - actually the best gnocchi I have EVER had - to the rabbit sausage and striped bass.  Flavorful, innovative, delicious.  In a word brilliant.  And our server was lovely and friendly.  A divine way for two yelpers to pass a dreary afternoon.  I will return soon.  Very soon.",9,13,11,Sam P.,"New York, NY",1869,875,636
5.0,1/9/2007,"We took a brisk walk around NYU, taking in the sights and touring around the park. We planned to have a wonderful lunch at Lupa. We werent let down. Escorted to the back with a long table and our prix fixe menu staring at us on our place settings. You come here, you better know your wines. That was my first impression: as most of us do know, we were still dumbfounded by the authenticity of the wine selection. Classic and contemporary Borolos and Dolcettos, Valpoliccelas and Barbera blends. Luckily the wine steward knew our tastes based on our interests. This was quickly followed by a beautiful array of antipasti. Delectable and diverse. Then the gnocci. God the gnocci. Glad to say we found the recipe and will be having it soon. I think that our meal began to run together after that with oohs, aahs and mmms. The chicken, seasoned to perfection. The pork shoulder, marinated with roses. The fish was beautiful on 4 senses. Needless to say the dessert was the last straw. I need to contact Mario. He needs to know that his workers are doing a damn fine job. Kudos to the service staff. Good timing, good attention.

We had a dinner reservation, but they made us wait over an hour. Our waiter was completely scatterbrained, and while I ordered the most expensive dish off their seafood menu ""Fruti di Mare,"" which was a platter of various types of seafood grilled and fried, I was highly disappointed. The fish was not fresh, and the squid was tough and rubbery. Perhaps, I should've stuck to pasta. I don't remember what the rest of our party had, but we were all unhappy that we had to wait so long for a crappy, expensive meal. On the plus side, the scatterbrained waiter forgot to charge us for the wine.That experince: 2/5 Long wait even with a reservation. Poor service and inattentive waitstaff.

4.0,12/1/2006,"A friend and I hit up Lupa around 9 PM.  It was an ideal time to show since we were without reservations and did specifically intend to linger over our meal.  We got seated inside the plastic porch under heat lamps.  It was cozy and comfortable, and very much preferable to the loud restaurant inside.  But the red lighting cast an insistent rosy hue over the evening, making us look a a bit strange and making it difficult to discern what we were eating at times ...But about the food ... In sharing a variety of dishes, we created our own tasting menu.  We targeted ingredients we were most curious about, ordering pairings that seemed obscure.Sunchokes:They look like galangal.  Their texture is slightly soft, slightly snappy-crunchy, like redskinned potatoes.  They taste a little sweet and a little earthy, the way rutabagas do.  They were served in halves sitting in olive oil, with thinly sliced pickled red onions.  The olive oil pool was a tad gratuitous.Duck (Special of the Day):Our concession to something ordinary.  The meat was dry, but the skin was crispy deliciousness.  This cruel contrast reminded me of Thanksgiving all over again.Lupa's best dishes were certainly their pasta dishes.  These were a unique education in what pasta has the fabulous potential to be.Ricotta Gnocchi:Fluffy pillows of potato pasta rolled around a ricotta-center surprise.  None of the dense gumminess one typically experiences with gnocchi.  Served with a modest portion of sausage meat and fennel-ly tomato sauce with crunchy flecks of not-too-spicy fresh ground pepper.  Lovely!  Relevatory!  Words you wouldn't think to describe the humble gnocchi.Pork Liver TortelliniSmoky pate (tastes identical to the paste spread on Vietnamese sandwiches) stuffed inside very al dente (or undercooked?) tortellini.  Served in a butter and black truffle sauce with a sprinkling of chives.  Fat and generous shavings of black truffle -- we were aghast but elated.  From this, I learned that black truffle tastes a lot like garlic sauteed in olive oil, but with less of the garlic-sharpness.  Not sure what the hype over truffle is, but maybe this wasn't the best dish to showcase such a subtle ingredient.  The flavor of the pate had a tendency to dominate.food: 5 for gnocchi; 1 for duck; 3 for everything elsevalue:  3service:  5 (waitress was exceedingly helpful and polite)ambience:  3 (nothing out of the ordinary here, save for volume)craveability:  5 for gnocchi; 2 for everything else",0,0,0,Tam N.,"New York, NY",103,76,132

5.0,8/21/2006,"Having studied abroad in Florence AND having a French father tend to make the normal, baseball-loving American from Chicago (me) rather adventurous when it comes to non-American ingredients. I eat (and adore) foie gras, raw oysters and sweetbreads on a fairly regular basis. But nothing could prepare me for the authenticity--the sheer brilliance of simple presentation with UNADULTERATED INGREDIENTS--that one comes across at Lupa. The tasting menu is beyond description: there is never a moment when you can deny that a competent, authorially-trained chef or sous-chef is choosing your menu. Achingly-crisp sauteed asparagus shares plate space with pause-giving roasted beets, surrounded by prosciutto as smoky and decadent as it could never be in the New World--this, a truly Italian antipasto; gorgonzola gnocchi as simple and devastating as a Roman trattoria's; oxtail in ragu and roasted fish as fresh as from Cinque Terre--and as far from the general American experience of culinary excellence as Del Posto is from Sbarro's.

When a friend suggested we grab dinner here on a trip to New York, I got very excited- how delicious do those dishes on Iron Chef look at 1am when you can't fall asleep? We got there around 6:30 with a group of five and were seated in less than 10 minutes- pretty good for a Wednesday night during a holiday week. The service is friendly and informative, yet casual. A great place to sit with old friends- it's kinda loud and relaxed. Maybe not so much for a first date when you want a quiet romantic restaurant though. We got the pork ravioli and some of deep-fried meatball looking bread-prosciutto-cheese delights, which were both fantastic. Two in our party swore that the saltibocca was the most amazing thing ever. My Buridda- fish stew- was very good as well. Even my vegetarian friend's house-made pasta with simple butter, salt, and pepper was fabulous. The carrafinas of wine are pretty small but both reds we selected were great- I preferred the Pinot Nero. Dessert- watermelon sorbet was a little too sweet but refreshing and the tarfulo(?) was rich and delicious. Overall a wonderful meal.
