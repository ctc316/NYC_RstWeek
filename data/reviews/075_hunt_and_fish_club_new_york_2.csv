1.0,4/23/2019,"Visiting NYC for the second time and decided to go here for my significant others birthday celebration. It was A Friday evening, weekend of Easter. I had called before hand and rescheduled our reservation, and confirmed the evening event- they offered dessert for his birthday and I kindly accepted and thanked the lady for the nice service. As we arrive, we were greeted and brought to our table. Waited a few minutes and asked about our preference for our water, sparkling or still. It had seemed like our waiter was a bit more attentive to the little group next to us as their party has 3, ours had two. Not if it was because we were ""young"" and felt like we were discriminated by that... maybe he thought we weren't going to tip him well so he gave us horrible and inattentive service? We had salmon as our appetizer, which was okay. Then followed by steaks, lobster Mac and cheese, fries, and another side dish. Must I say that I ordered medium-rare though more on the cooked side. Or steak came out horribly cooked. Outside was burnt, inside wasn't even warm... fries came out cold and so did the Mac n cheese. Our waiter didn't even assist us, it was other waiters walking around. The restaurant wasn't even busy other than the large party but that only took one server to service. Our bill came out to be $350. Final total was $400. I always tip based off of service, never percentage but it'll never be nothing. And that was without my significant others dessert, they didn't even bring that out. I was a bit disappointed because this was supposed to be the highlight of our visit to NYC. But I guess we wouldn't have known unless we tried. Never coming again, thankfully NYC is filled with steakhouses for us to try during our coming trips!",0,0,0,Nittaya S.,"Seattle, WA",5,81,26
5.0,4/22/2019,"OMG I am obsessed with this place! I had seen so many beautiful pics on their IG page, I kept telling my gf we needed to go (and had it bookmarked for months). I am happy to say, my experience matched my high expectations. Everything was amazing.We were running a bit behind on our 7 pm reservation, so they were happy to hold the table until 7:30 pm. Immediately upon seating we ordered six oysters and a nice bottle of wine. The sommelier was happy to pick out a lovely French white wine for around $100 for us. We then ordered the 'Owner's Recipe Seafood Salad' and 'Gnocchi With Lobster & Caviar' along with 'Truffle Tater Tots'. Everything was absolutely outstanding. I made the mistake of gobbling down the delightful complimentary bread they put down before our food even arrived. This was legit the best bread I've ever had. It was crispy and cheesy on the outside, and warm, gooey, and heaven like on the inside. The bread its huge too and of course I had to ask for seconds! Then came the seafood salad which was the best seafood salad I have ever had. The salad came with fresh calamari rings, scallops, pieces of lobster and shrimp with lemon in a light vinaigrette dressing. The gnocchi arrived at the same time and it was outstanding. Large pieces of fresh gnocchi in a creamy, Parmesan like sauce with huge pieces of lobster, along with caviar and bread crumbs on top. Wow. The tater tots were a very unique dish. They came seven to a dish and they were huge. They came with a really tasty tarter like sauce on the side, yum. The server also handed us a free plate of brussel sprouts and they were excellent too. They came seared in a very tasty sauce. By 8:30/9pm, the place was jammed packed, most people looked like they were at business dinners. My gf told me they had a separate bar downstairs, which I noticed when I went to the bathroom. I'll have to go check that out next time I'm there. I was beyond full and a little tipsy and ready to head home, but then came out the largest piece of chocolate cake I have ever seen, complimentary too! That was so nice of them! We weren't even there on a special occasion! I thought the staff was excellent overall! They were very friendly, hospitable, and accommodating. I was so pleased, I knew I needed to write a fabulous review, straight away! I cannot wait to go back!",3,1,2,Shannon W.,"Paramus, NJ",592,501,940
5.0,4/21/2019,"This spot has been on my list for some time, and I finally decided that last week was the week I would go, and go solo.  I had a plan to get one or two things, but ended up ordering three.  The bartender, Johnathan, was so helpful in helping me decide what to order.  Ultimately, I ordered the crab cake, Mac and cheese, and the bison burger.The crab cake: SOOOOO good.  Tender, crispy outside, with a perfect slaw and remouladeMac: HOLY CHEESUS.  This was the best I've ever had. I'll leave it at thatBison burger: super tender and juicy! Would order again for sure!This spot is worth the $$$ and the menu has a lot to offer!

5.0,4/20/2019,Came here for my birthday and everything about this place was perfect. It is absolutely beautiful and the waitress was extremely kind and super attentive. Started with 5 oysters and ended up ordering 6 more because they were that good. The salmon was probably one of the best salmon I've had. The lemon chicken was delicious too. Have absolutely no complaints about this place. The margaritas here were the best margaritas I've had in the city. And this is coming from someone who only drinks margaritas. I've had margaritas from all over and this take the cake. I would most definitely come back.,0,0,0,Sherllin T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",13,31,118
3.0,4/19/2019,"First and foremost I'm mainly giving 3 stars because of the service. Our waitress Rosa was so nice & pleasant and was the best part of our experience. But anywho, as far as overpriced steakhouses go this one just blends in. Nothing spectacular but nothing too bad either. The beef carpaccio, truffle béarnaise sauce on our steak (if you order the steak it's a MUST) & 24 layer cake were the best parts or the meal. Everything else was just meh.The crab cake we ordered was a little rough on the outside making it hard to break into & share.  The sparkling water I paid $8 for tasted flat. Like dang, can a girl get a bottle of Perrier? Our steak we asked for medium rare and it came out over cooked And as I've seen on other reviews the lobster was a little over cooked as well. The meat was slightly dried out & it the crab meat stuffing was more stuffing than crab. I probably wouldn't go again but the experience was a cool one time thing.",0,0,1,Torae B.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",464,69,156
1.0,4/19/2019,"In a word........horrible.    Unless you like One Star sleepers. I've been to every well known and many obscure steakhouses in the city, probably multiple times so this review isn't from a casual tourist that felt burned.  Hunt and Fish is trying to join the ranks of one of those elite but falls so very far from the mark. L.  Last nights experience wasn't good.   It started off with the a weak Old Fashioned cocktail which I could happily excuse if the service and the food was top rate.    Fact is, neither one was and the cocktail was just a prelude of what was to come While the Porterhouse was somewhat salvageable (average at best) the Hunt and Fish Special with the Tomahawk steak at $350!! was what irked us most. Falling significantly below average at an over priced premium, poor presentation and weak flavor.  Both the Porterhouse and the Tomahawk were  served rather cold. The wait staff is completely uneducated as to what they serve and  happy to serve  poorly prepared specials and luke warm sides. I blame management not them.  .  As if huge pats of butter on a steak aren't gross enough check out the unmelted ones in this picture that the untrained staff was happy to bring to the table in a drop and run.    Don't even get me started on the accompanying amateur sauces.      Our waiter was happy to be non-existent once he clocked in the sale of the ""special"".  Seems like a commission based wait staff if I had to guess.  The sad special which I can't get past  includes 6 mediocre/medium sized  shrimp and a small anemic lobster tail somewhere in this attached photo all atop herbs which looked more like weeds.  As for dessert, We tried for redemption with the ""signature"" waffles for two.   Again cold but this time dramatically presented by a nasty fool as the staff smears Smuckers Jam and bottled caramel on a platter at your table only to drop in a cold rather old waffle for the grande finale as if it was made by Paul Bouse himself.     Who serves cold old waffles for dessert??  Forget the fact that they were completely unable to answer questions as to ""what is that ?"" I won't mention where you should go for a good steak and service at the risk of sounding  like a paid influencer but  there are many to choose from and as for Hunt and Fish we had ENOUGH!  of this place.   Our crew will not return.  One star rating because that's the lowest I could give it and still enter an online review.  $240 per person - one cocktail and no wine.",0,0,0,Gus F.,"New York, NY",0,22,26
5.0,4/18/2019,"I wish I could give this place more stars. We got stuck in traffic, the staff accommodated the reservation change. We had short time for dinner because of show time and the staff accommodate that. Not only was the staff top notch, the food was incredible. From the free bread, with amazing herb butter to the silky smooth steak that was like butter the food was a home run.

4.0,4/15/2019,"Upscale venue with a great ambiance. Good for large parties. The food was delicious, though every item was a bit too oily/greasy to give it a 5/5 for me. It's also very pricey but I knew that coming in so it wasn't a surprise!",0,0,0,Serena R.,"Dupont Circle, Washington, DC",9,30,77
4.0,4/12/2019,"Nice restaurant in a great part of the city. Lively, a little loud and a great place to grab a good meal. Service is outstanding. Food quality is superb. Food texture was on point. Fell a little short on flavor and nothing was really impressive aside from the chef's seafood appetizer (very fresh and perfectly flavored) and carrot cake dessert. The steak was cooked to perfection and very tender. Brussel sprouts was just average and not something i would order in the future.

5.0,4/10/2019,"I came here with my boyfriend a couple days ago for his birthday and we had such a great experience! We didn't have a reservation but were seated right away. The service was excellent! We received constant attention without it being too overbearing. Each course was brought out promptly and hot. We had the French onion soup which was delicious with the addition of short rib. The scallops were definitely our favorite course of the night, and they were probably one of the most flavorful scallops I've ever tasted (highly recommend!). The rib eye was seasoned and cooked perfectly as well. We got it with the stuffed half lobster and the small size for such a high price was the only disappointment, since the stuffing was primarily breadcrumbs but overall, can't complain since we were pretty stuffed by then anyway. We could barely dig into our sides because we were so full but we really enjoyed both the tater tots and creamed spinach. Will definitely be coming back to try out some other dishes!",0,0,0,Emily G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0
3.0,4/7/2019,"I came here because they started following me on IG, and I was impressed enough with some of their videos and their account. In the mood for lobster, I said, ""Why not?"" Suckaaa...Look, it wasn't horrible, but for the price, it definitely wasn't transcendent. The problems started with logistics. I called in to change a reservation time, and the entire thing got lost entirely. So did that of the person in front of me at check-out. NBD, they were able to seat us, but what if they hadn't?Internal decor looks like it was conceived by people who didn't realize Wolf of Wall Street wasn't supposed to be a flattering and admiring portrait. Tacky, along with the loud club music that inhibits substantive conversation. What about the food? It's mixed. Lobster mac and cheese was cold. Bone marrow was terrific. Signature lobster didn't look at all like the IG photo, and worse, the actual meat was overly done. There's nothing more gross than non-moist, dry lobster meat. Panna cotta was incredible, tho, and definitely saved this from the famous #MERLINTWO review. Worst thing? Curious about this place, I looked it up, and learned it's co-owned by Anthony Scaramucci??!

4.0,4/6/2019,"If your trip to NYC includes splurging on food, this is the place for you. Food was amazing, service could not have been better, but overall, way too expensive. We were the first table for the night (5pm, which I highly recommend if you are hitting the theater for an 8 pm show, to give you time to walk-off your dinner). Service could not have been better; staff was very knowledgeable, attentive but not obtrusive and by 6:30 when we were getting ready to depart, the dining room was already full. Ordered Chef's Seafood Salad to start/split -  a delightfully light dish swimming with gems like shrimp, calamari, lobster and scallops. Dinner for both was the 10 oz. filet with mashed potatoes (delish!!) and toasted asparagus (over roasted/mushy). For dessert,  the mind-blowing 24 layer chocolate cake with salted caramel gelato - really needed 2 scoops but they also took the time to write a celebratory birthday message on the plate. All in all a wonderful time, but the bill for 2, including 2 glasses of modestly-priced wine, was close to $300.",1,0,0,Shell T.,"Livonia, MI",0,18,22

2.0,3/18/2019,"Hunt & Fish was my final stop on my week long tour of celebrating my birthday. The restaurant is located in Times Square-- which is something I was skeptical about from the beginning but I got over that. The restaurant itself is wonderful; very chic and classy vibe. The sparkling lights in the ceiling was a nice touch, the huge mirrors on the bottom level, the soft music and the layout itself was well-done. However, outside of the aesthetics; this place wasn't up to par.Usually when I know I'm going somewhere for dinner, I'll try and grab lunch somewhat early while at the office, work up a nice appetite, however, when I went, that wasn't an option. I probably ate lunch around 4PM and the reservation was at 6PM. So while I wasn't exactly too hungry, neither was the person I was dining with. She's trying to diet and didn't want anything to heavy or burdensome; apparently that was an issue for the ""second server"". I refer to him as the second server, because we initially had one person who took our order but then someone else sort of took over. After we placed our drink orders, he came back and took our orders for dinner, along with the ""second server"". Since it was my birthday, he took my order first. I wanted the Salmon, but that seemed to bother him, for some reason. He just grabbed the menu after I requested the Salmon, as he then went to take the second order, I chimed in, that I wanted the creamed spinach. I just felt rushed and that he should have let me complete my sentence before moving on. The poor service continued,  when my aunt requested the Lobster Mac and Cheese, and his response was, that's it. I've dined many places in my life, and I've never heard such a thing. He says you should add the Branzino to that, but she wasn't interested. She added the crab cake, but while I didn't ask, I believe she was sort of pressured into it, because she really only wanted the Lobster Mac and Cheese.We also had the Tater Tots, but I wasn't a fan of. It was brought over when we ordered dinner, which I felt was slightly odd. I didn't care for the Salmon, the creamed spinach was just ok, too. While I didn't sample the Mac n Cheese, I was told it was ""too cheesy"" which took away from the taste of the lobster. I did order the cheesecake which along with the spread that came with the bread (I believe it was vegetable cream cheese) was my favorite part of my meal. That's not a good sign whatsoever, when you only enjoy dessert and the complimentary bread.In short, it's a beautiful restaurant with a lot of potential; that should be a perfect venue if you're going to the theatre afterward, but the lack of proper service and subpar food would prevent me from returning here, in the future.",9,3,6,Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",400,480,1763
1.0,3/12/2019,"Been wanting to try this place for quite some time. Maybe it was the name that invoked the legend of a Hunt and Fish Club in Queens or the fact that the Mooch owns the joint but I wanted to see what the hype was about. And hype it was, all smoke and mirrors (nice job on the mirrored wall by the way, hats off to a great glazier) The H&FC is located in the touristy theater district for good reason. Only a tourist should eat there. A real New Yorker like myself knows his money would be better spent at Lugers or one of its great knock offs like Wolfgang's or Ben and Jacks, or even Smith and Wollenskys. This place is ridiculously expensive even by NY steakhouse standards  and a rip off to boot.  Sat down and we were asked if we wanted sparkling or ""still"" water, I replied regular is fine, not paying any attention to how our glasses were filled. Some time later my guest was asked if he wanted another cocktail, and he replied no.  A few minutes later the waiter whom we had chit chatted about his native Columbia with as we sat down brought a refill. Thinking that it was a nice gesture on his part only to discover when the check arrived that not only was the ""complimentary"" cocktail on the check but 2 bottles of water @ $16. as well! It is my seasoned impression that both of these erroneous charges were placed on our check intentionally. Didn't think I had rip me off tourist written on my forehead but guess I was wrong.  Oh, by the way food was mediocre at best,",1,1,0,Ari G.,"Franklin Square, NY",0,3,0

5.0,2/3/2019,"I made a reservation at Hunt & Fish Club for my husband's birthday and were left stunned by how amazing our restaurant experience was. As someone who lives in the city, don't let this steakhouse's location near Times Square turn you off. This place is incredibly classy and chic, with stellar service and even better food. From the moment we walked into the dining area we were in awe of how beautiful it was with its lighting fixture in the roof, which led to a romantic feeling. It is a bit pricer, but worth the splurge for a fun night out. From the moment our waiter brought us the complimentary bread (I think they were cheese pop-overs) we knew that the actual appetizers and entrees would be great. No joke, I could have eaten the bread as a meal and been happy with my decision.We got the octopus to start, which was perfectly cooked. Since I'm not a huge steak fan, I went with the scallops entree - it was fabulous! It came with more than just the scallops, so I probably didn't need a side but we ordered the mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts anyways (note: if you get steak definitely get a side, also the sides are huge and made for sharing). I'm not one to rave about brussel spouts, but they way they prepared them in a bit of a juice was amazing. The mashed potatoes were also incredibly creamy and worth trying as well.

3.0,2/2/2019,My experience here was okay. I feel this place has potential but as a first time diner I wasn't too thrilled.I'll start with the positives. The decor in this placeWas gorgeous. They have beautiful lighting and a classy set up down to the uniforms of the servers. The bread for the table was delish! As well as these small flat crisp crostini's. They were served with fig and cheese and it was so tasty. The food was decent. I had the king crab risotto as an entree and the baked shrimp as an app. I loved the shrimp ..risotto was mediocre. The menu offers lots of options and I am sure there are some really good quality entrees however mine was just average.The most disappointing thing about this place was the service. The waiter assigned to our table was not attentive at all. We waited extremely long before he came to take our drink order to the point where we had to flag someone down. I understand places can be busy but it didn't seem like that was the case. He seemed to be new I'm not sure either way he wasn't so accommodating. Wasn't happy with him.

However, it is restaurant week and they were busy. The popovers are fabulous. Excellent dirty martinis. The Som was super nice. The hanger steak was well prepared. A little over smothered with the mushroom preparation and sauce. The cream of tomato soup which I normally never ordered her was phenomenal.

2.0,1/25/2019,Went here for restaurant week and am so glad that I didn't go on a normal day because this place is not good and overrated. I would describe it as a wannabe corporate steakhouse. Ordered a dirty martini that was so bad that I couldn't drink more than 1 sip (price point $21). The staff didn't asked once me throughout the meal if I didn't like the drink or why I had not drank ANY of it (it was completely full). Food was average - I would never pay full price for it nor would I recommend this place to anyone.

I love the arugula salad because it's very refreshing. Then we had steak and grilled char as mains. I ordered the steak medium rare but I think it's a little over cooked or it's because it's hanger steak so it's super chewy. The steak could be prepared a little better in my opinion. For desserts, we had the s'mores bar which was super creamy and delicious. We also had the tequila pineapple sorbet. Both desserts are yummy. The service was overall good.

4.0,1/23/2019,"For a place right across from Times Square, you wouldn't think it would be much - but Hunt & Fish has been one of the most impressive restaurants that I've had the pleasure of returning to this year. It's not your average place (you'll want to make note of the 4 $ price point), so ideal for special occasions or the potential work event. The interior space is meant to impress as well - beautiful, high ceilings, elegant lighting, and spacious tables.For a place that specializes in steak and seafood, the pastas here are some of my favorites. The Mushroom Tagliatelle is al dente and coated in a flavorful mushroom sauce, and a great option for vegetarians and omnivores alike. And while not a side, I would recommend the hash browns for any course of the meal; they're some of the largest I've yet to find and deliciously crispy.The steak is where they truly shine, however. The Tomahawk is meant to share and presented impressively; if you ask for a medium rare cook, it's what you'll get. On my second visit, however, we got the bone in Rib Eye, which was seasoned to perection and cooked to the perfet medium rare. There's a number of sauces and sides you can pair with your entree as well, and their bearnaise and peppercorn sauces are divine.For dessert, their signature chocolate cake shouldn't be missed. It's 20+ layers of chocolate cake and ganache, and will be sure to satisfy any chocolate lover out there.Would definitely recommend Hunt & Fish to anyone looking for a special dining experience.",13,4,10,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

4.0,1/11/2019,"I heard many good things about HFC before finally coming here and I've gotta say that what I've heard matches up with what I experienced. Starting off is the decor: beautiful, classy, VERY New York. Once you walk into the main dining room and see the lit up ceiling you'll understand what I mean (whether you're from NYC or not). Next we have the fantastic service: well dressed & attentive servers only add to the very classy, old school-y NYC vibe that this restaurant brings. As you can see...so far, so good. Once me and my dinner companion sat down we ordered two drinks (a Jalisco tequila drink that was very, very good and definitely got us feeling a little tip-say). We started off with a delicious gnocchi with lobster & caviar appetizer that was only beat by the amazing grilled bacon we also ordered. Hard stop on this review: ORDER this bacon! One of the best I've had in the city and a definite must try. Okay...back to the review: After having our starters out came our main courses: 24oz Bone-In Ribeye and our bacon mac n cheese. I gotta say that the steak was not bad at all. Add some chimichurri and you're good. Not the greatest I've had but certainly nowhere near bad (far, far from it). BUT! The winner -hands down- was the bacon mac n cheese! Uff! What a beauty! Cheesy AF with chunks of bacon baked in, this one was a show-stopper. To top it all off we had a delicious 24 layer cake and a cheesecake that were seriously good. Major points for their dessert platter. Another easy recommendation. Overall HFC is a must visit with a great ambiance and honest to goodness great service. I'll definitely be coming back here and cannot wait to try out more of the steaks offered on their menu.",1,0,0,Em P.,"Brooklyn, NY",36,68,157

My fiancee had the seared scallops and they were wonderfully cooked and seasoned. I had the boneless ribeye cooked MR, and it was certainly the most perfectly cooked steak I've ever been served.

5.0,1/4/2019,"I wanted to take my mother out for a nice birthday dinner and I couldn't have picked a better place. Taking a seat in the main dining room makes you feel like you stepped back in time to something out of the Great Gatsby. It's probably the most opulently well-designed restaurant in the country (at least that I've been to) Every plate that comes past you from the kitchen going to another table makes you want to ask your server what it is. The Grilled Bacon is a great appetizer! I had to get it because it's a unique menu item that you don't find at most places and they do it right! We split a bone-in Ribeye and had a lobster tail each. I had Crispy Lemon Potatoes and Mac and Cheese for sides. Everything was delicious. Even the bread they bring the table taste incredible. They have a huge wine selection. Their wine menu is basically a book. I think we only had one glass each. We passed on dessert but probably should have gotten something now that I think about it, their dessert menu sounded yummy. Anyone coming here should expect to atleast shell out $200-300 for dinner, but it's definitely worth the tab. Looking back, this was probably the best dining experience I had in 2017, and it made my mom feel very special which was the most important thing. I want to come back here again soon.

Drink, appetizers and dinner orders were taken separately but in a timely manner. We ordered multiple small pasta plates and appetizers which we shared and found excellent. Our dinners spanned the entire menu fish, pork and steaks. All were high quality cuts cooked to near perfection.

At the last moment the concierge was able to get us a table at the Hunt and Fish Club. When you first walk in, it's dark and then you move the curtains and enter a beautiful bar and restaurant. I asked the hostess if she could put us at a table by the door so I could feel the cold air, since most places in New York are hot inside. Without any hesitation the hostess put us at a great table. Within seconds our waiter came over and our culinary adventure started. To start I ordered their shrimp cocktail appetizer. The shrimps were nice size but the presentation of that dish was the nicest I have ever had, anywhere in my life. Since we had a big lunch we decided to split the 10oz filet mignon. In addition we ordered the mashed potatoes and the Brussel sprouts with bacon. The whole dinner between the food and service was top notch. Through out our meal, the manager Tina came to our table to introduce herself and talk with my wife and I. Tina is a true professional. After we were done eating I asked for the check as I was full and passed on desert. I was then informed by my waiter that Tina was sending our table a complementary dessert. The waiter brought to our table a 25 layer chocolate cake and on the side was maybe the best ice cream I ever have had. Tina throughout our meal checked in with us and I have now found my new favorite restaurant in New York.

3.0,10/5/2018,"Ok so this rating was hard, because we did really enjoy the food, but we struggled with a lot of other aspects throughout the evening that undermined our great food experience drastically. So here is a breakdown:Decor: Gorgeous, low-light, intimate decor. Especially the light feature with the mirrored ceiling is captivating. The tables are a bit close here and there but the leather couch sections are comfy.Food: Although at first sight, one might think that the prices are higher than average at this place, the quality and quantity more than justify this. Every dish we had (check pics) tasted great, was made with quality products and was more than enough for all of us.Atmosphere: Unfortunately I was not aware beforehand that the bar and restaurant are not fully separated. There were quite a lot of people in the bar area (especially for a Thursday eve) who were talking at a very high volume. I think they tried to compensate for this by turning up the volume of the music. Sadly, the music was way too uptempo and clubby and did not fit the establishment at all. Also, bring a winter coat because the room temperature is set so low one would expect it to start snowing indoors.Waiters: Now here's where the experience really fell short for us. Our waiter (Marcos according to the bill) spent a total of 3 minutes at our table throughout the entire night. He could not care less about us. Meanwhile, he spent a good 10 minutes at the table next to us explaining the menu and making small talk. It started with him asking what type of water we wanted; he asked me, my husband and then completely ignored my mom and walked off saying ""tap water it is"". The girl in charge of drinks was a lot friendlier luckily. When it came to ordering food, he seemed very displeased that we were not having starters/appetizers because I said we would rather do mains and desserts. Once we were finished, he brought us dessert menus without saying a word. Then he went back to another table to chat away with them again. I think the girl in charge of drinks noticed this, so she came to take our dessert order instead. When he was finally done talking to the table next to us, we got our desserts. All of a sudden he rushed over to our table and wanted to pour caramel over our éclairs (after I kindly had told the guy who brought out the dish that we would do it ourselves because we were going to share). I stopped him just in time and he immediately took off again. Once we were finished, he just out the check on our table. So no small talk the entire night ""how are you, are you visiting from out of town, are you enjoying the food,.."". For a place that pretends to be upscale, it sure has a a strange standard for waiters. Also, two of the guys that clear tables were at one point standing at the table next to us (which was empty), with their backs turned to us and one of them started rearranging his shirt in the back of his pants. Dafuq? -_-So yeah, we really did enjoy he dishes we had. But sitting in a freezing room with loud club music, noisy bar guests and a rude/negligent waiter was a real disappointment to us.",1,0,0,Ilse V.,"Murrieta, CA",96,259,496

3.0,9/8/2018,"After hearing rave reviews, I came here with a friend for lunch to partake in this past Summer Restaurant Week on the very last day it was taking place. I immediately fell in love with the interior decor of the place. There were these gorgeous sparkling lights all over the ceiling and it was absolutely stunning. There were white tablecloths on the tables with beige walls and cool mirrors. The ambiance was classic, classy and chic.One thing I did not like about the Restaurant Week Lunch menu was that they only offered 2 courses: Appetizer and Entree for the $26 price tag. If you wanted to try dessert, it was an additional $10. We were served this huge, fluffy, soft and still warm onion bread which was accompanied by garlic butter. The bread itself was very tasty and the butter added to the yumminess.For my appetizer, I ordered the Prosciutto with apricots, brie cheese and aged balsalmic. It came beautifully plated with bright colors of orange, pinkish hue and white. The prosciutto was not overly salty and I enjoyed the fruit with the cheese. There was just the right amount of slightly sweet and sour vinegar.I chose the Hanger Steak for my entree, which had peas, fingerling potatoes, mint mixed with Greek yogurt. The steak was cut into smaller pieces and on top of the potato salad. I had requested that my steak be cooked medium well, however it came well done. I know it is partly my fault for ordering it the way I did, but it was way too burned, dry, tough and bland. I do like char and the crispiness it comes with, but this was beyond even me. It was really hard to eat because the steak was extremely tough to chew. The concoction of peas, potatoes with Greek yogurt was pretty good. There was definitely more flavor in that and quite fresh, crunchy. I do prefer french fries with my steak though.I think my friend's Chicken Saltimbocca with prosciutto, sage, roasted rosemary potato looked better than my dish, which is strange since steak and seafood is supposed to be the specialty.My friend and I shared the Vanilla-Almond Creme Caramel dessert. This consisted of strawberry rhubarb compote and almond strawberry biscotti, with creme and sliced almonds on top. I thoroughly enjoyed the biscotti - It was still warm, perfectly moist and crumbled deliciously in my mouth. The biscotti had a strong taste of delightful almond. The strawberry rhubarb compote on top of the flan-like caramel cake was just okay - It was a little too tart for my liking. I adored the rich, sweetly smooth creme that was placed over the compote and that went with the cake wonderfully. The flan cake was sitting in its caramel juices which helped enhance the flavor, but I am not really a fan of flan. This dessert would have been better if it was an actual vanilla cake. The service was good and the decor is lovely, but the food was just mediocre. For that reason, I do not feel the need to return.",16,10,10,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",783,438,5876
2.0,9/1/2018,"The steak house restaurant market in NYC is a tough one to break. So, if you are going to set yourself up as a high end steak experience in Manhattan you need to bring something special.H&F NYC looks sparkly on the surface from afar at first, but lacks style and substance overall. It's the weakest steak house experience thus far in NYC. The service was lackluster, reluctant and they had this annoying need to walk in between guest's chairs (knocking them as they passed).

The wait staff was attentive gracious and welcoming. And it just kept getting better. All 3 of us had the restaurant week menu. The portions were large and I'm very happy they were. We all left full. We had choices for all 3 courses. I opted for the crap and avocado crustini. There were 3 and amazingly delicious. Next I had the mushroom and truffle risotto. OMG. OMG. Can I say it again OMG!! Ended with peach and blackberry crumble with a scoop of ice cream. Perfect ending. On each table is served 3 crisps with marscapone cheese and dates. The flavors meld perfectly. Also each person is served a popover that is the size of Brooklyn! Just kidding. But large warm and delicious. The butter is creamy savory and works on the popover.

Wow!... And secondly, for going through the trouble to make the lunch up to us!  The restaurant is beautiful and my party enjoyed lunch immensely.

1.0,8/9/2018,"This is a review for the restaurant week lunch. I have been here for dinner many times and the food is great. I don't know what happened with the lunch menu. I have been telling my coworkers about how great this restaurant is so we all decided to go and try the restaurant week menu (all 8 of us). We all decided to start with the baked clams; they looked gray and were not warm once they got to the table. Also the toppings were extremely overwhelming in taste (bacon and cheese ). We all came to the conclusion that we did not like the dish. For the entree: a few of us ordered the chicken saltimbocca which was very salty; and had way too much sauce on top of the chicken which made the roasted potatoes that come with it extremely soggy. The chicken was wrapped in Sage, which was extremely overpowering for your tastebuds as that's all you tasted. A few of us ordered the Arctic Char Provençal which was dry and extremely salty as well. Overall, our conclusion was that we only enjoyed the bread that was given to us; might I add it came late! The service also wasn't up to par with what I experienced in the past. Personally I was extremely disappointed, given I wanted my coworkers to experience the restaurant like I did and wanted them to come back for dinner. However due to this experience non of them would want to go back to the restaurant which I think is a shame. I understand that restaurant week is a deal, but that doesn't mean you don't hold yourself to the same standards because that's how you loose potential customers. After this experience even I am thinking twice of going back for dinner.

3.0,8/5/2018,"Review for RW Summer 2018: I was impressed by the decor, the prompt answers I received when I made a call to the hostess, attentiveness of the server(s), as well as the presentation the food- which was impeccable! Where it was lacking was the smoothness of the seating/ordering and communication.I had called 2x prior to make sure our reservation time was ok (3 is available on Opentable but they seem to be closed at that time on Google) & to see if they could do an entree without a pork product. (Chicken minus prosciutto) When we came in at 3:04 - we were told to hold on to check to see if they were even open. So ridiculous and awkward?! Some minutes later they seated us and proceeded with a dinner menu - I specifically called to see if they were open for lunch for our reservation.* They proceeded to explain that since we came in a ""couple"" of minutes later that they didn't have staff. It resolved itself after me explaining multiple times that I called to double check not 60 minutes ago AND the day before. Honestly this kind of thing is understandable & in any kind of business miscommunications can happen. It was just so incredibly awkward and no one really apologized or acknowledged the fact that they were in the wrong for not blocking off their reservations then OR calling me and telling me..which they could have done multiple times. I was spoken to in a deadpan..standoffish way when we were discussing this. (Servers and hostess excluded)Food was OK but presented beautifully ..salad was dressed quinoa. Steak was ok, fish was cooked nicely. The dessert was good! Freshly made biscotti? It was soft. But they did not accommodate us with the entree without pork product, which again, would be understandable had we not called and asked and received the OK.All in all - if you're having a special occasion and you don't want the details fudged, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",1,0,0,Rahnama F.,"Long Island City, NY",275,20,65

I have been here before a long while ago, and looked forward to this visit.They did not disappoint, although we made it just at the cut off point for serving they happily seated us and some other guests that came in shortly after us. We had the entire arena to ourselves...all 2 tables worth.We giggled, we chatted, we took pictures of everything and chatted some more until we were gently reminded to open the menu...and place our orders...oops!!The entrance of the restaurant leads you directly to a side lounge area and the bar. Lots of stuff going on at the bar even midday, but as you enter the dining area it is breathtaking and beautiful with crystals and all things sparkly. It lights up the whole sense of being present and enjoying the moment. The pale open area leads to the start of a great dining experience.The waitstaff treated us with such attention and care, offering us suggestions, substitutions and pairings.For restaurant week, we had a choice of a few items. But even with the limited choice I struggled with what to order. We settled on clams, artic char provencal, hangar steak, and strawberry rhubarb.The baked clams were so buttery, and just a little bit oily. Both my friend and I devoured this goodness in mere moments....well, in between gossip but still we both finished. Then we shared the entrees and giggled some more as we realized yumminess has turned us into little piggies....then when my friend left to powder her nose I ate ALLLLL of her strawberry rhubarb and mine. She ate more of the entrees so I made up for it in dessert, all is fair. The downstairs is beautiful, and they also have an adjacent party room upstairs.

The char is awesome as the skin is nice and crispy but the meat itself is super juicy and tender. I'm not amazed with the rest. The sorbet is awesome. It has pineapple tequila flavor that has a bit cream in but it tastes very good. They have decent wine selection and the Chardonnay tastes good. The service is very good.

They delivered my medium steak very well done and when they took it back to the kitchen they did comp it which was much appreciated. The service isn't great however and you have to essentially hunt someone down to get another drink order. Likely wouldn't go back, it wasn't the experience I had expected and hoped for. There also seemed to be a lot of tension between the staff- I saw several awkward altercations between managers and servers and the sommelier. They also highly prioritize large tables and don't pay much attention to parties of 2 or 3.",0,0,0,Maddie B.,"Rockville, MD",315,11,5

3.0,7/8/2018,"Really great location -- the restaurant is right next to Times Square. Ambiance of the restaurant was beautiful. My husband and I visited for my birthday and shared a Caesar salad, a 24 ounce ribeye with trifle bernaise sauce with a side of bone marrow and grilled mushrooms. Everything was superb and the portions were big enough for us to share and feel very full but not overwhelmed. The only downside was the service. Our server was pleasant but appeared to have a very ""Applebee's"" like energy which was super upbeat and very strong. At a fine dining romantic restaurant I would have preferred a different etiquette. The server was also very pushy on up-selling items which was obvious. It felt uncomfortable. We had to pour our own waters too and our sparkling water bottle was never refilled. We declined desert but they still brought it a happy birthday fruit plate for us but the server added ""it's on us you don't have to worry about it."" Felt awkward. Was also disappointed with how the restaurant didn't have a dress code enforced. With the ambiance it felt awkward to have people in cargo shorts and flip flops. Food was excellent but would not go here looking for ambiance again.",1,0,0,Isra A.,"Philadelphia, PA",44,108,29
4.0,6/25/2018,"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars. But, the service was just lacking at a place of this caliber so I had to go with 4. We had a Saturday evening dinner at Hunt & Fish Club NYC. Different vibe from the usual NYC places. I expected a woman to come to the table at any moment offering ""Cigars...Cigarettes..!"" The atmosphere is amazingly relaxed, like a Zen Garden for the Rich and Famous. Dishes were excellent across the board. Service, however, wasn't up to par. They didn't ask about any food allergies, the ""Amuse Bouche"" which is supposed to be presented first, was presented after the appetizers were served. When we ordered our meal they didn't ask if we wanted any ""sides"" (my Branzino didn't come with any vegetables or potato). Also they just dropped off the check (a BIG NO NO in NYC) without saying something like ""I'll just leave this here when you're ready"" or similar. No goodbye greeting at the door either. Didn't appreciate the mensroom attendant putting mouthwash in front of my face nor did I appreciate the fact that he had a bunch of $20.00 and $10.00 bills in his ""tip"" bowl. Honestly, who tips a mensroom attendant $20 or even $10. I gave him $1.00. Interesting experience. As for the food. The beet salad was excellent with goat cheese, pistachio, with a beet vinaigrette. It was adequate in size. The ""Owners Recipe Seafood Salad"" was also excellent and a generous serving for an appetizer portion. The whole Branzino was perfectly cooked, filleted, and served with a hot lemon for squeezing and a small amount of lemon-caper pesto sauce. . No sides came with this dish which the server failed to mention when taking the order.  Our other entree was the Swordfish with Artichoke Hearts, Olives, Caper Berries and Tomato. This dish also was excellent but the caper berries, if they were there, were invisible and the only ""tomato"" sat atop the fish. This dish also didn't have any sides included. Dessert was the exceptional bittersweet chocolate panda cotta with cocoa crumble, orange-vanilla bean foam, and fantastic ""creamsicle"" gelato. Coffee and decaf were only ok at $4.50 a cup. Apparently, this place is frequently written up in the media. The kitchen is sold. Despite the uneven service, this is a wonderful restaurant when you just want a relaxing meal.

It was my husbands and i's first time coming to hunt and fish club, we made a reservation (to celebrate his birthday) and we love trying ""trendy"" nyc restaurants for special occasions and cost isn't a factor. We got super dressed up and were so excited to dine here. The start was fine, we arrived 10 min early and were advised by the hostess to take a seat at the bar and they'd get us when our table was ready. We ordered 2 titos and seltzers for 32$ and the second we got our drink they called us to our table (we tipped the bartender, how convienant) we were seated at a corner small table- and the quarters were so tight they had to pull our table out so we could get into the space (mind you there were plenty of open tables, throughout the entirety of our meal) We never were greated by a waiter, someome in a suit (assumed a manager) took our drink order and about 20 minutes went by before the man came over asking for our order...all in the meantime no bread service was offered. While the man took our order, a waiter interupted him WHILE I WAS GIVING MY ORDER and the man continued to speak with the waiter. Our ""salad"" came and other appetizers..i know when you come to an expensive restaurant you have to sometimes assume its quality of the food not necessarily the portion size your getting for your buck...but for 19$ this was downright insanity...2 halved small beets with 2 small chunks of goat cheese and a sprinkle pistachos, my husband had the french onion and at the bottom of his bowl was a literal brick of bread that he couldnt even cut with his knife.... bread finally came...this was the best part of the meal, the popovers were delicious...then our dinners came...we ordered the brussel sprouts and lemon potatoes for sides, i had the salmon and my husband had the bone in ribeye (cooked medium) my salmon was so dry i didn't even finish it, the brussel sprouts were burnt and my husband steak was rare and full of fatty meat. The table next to us recieved the wrong drink order, the wrong side dishes..so we knew it wasnt just us. The bill came to 210 dollars and it made our stomachs curl to pay that much for a meal that we barely ate. We are normal blue collar workers, so we were very disappointed.  The service is really what upset me... we later ended up at a cute little random beer and wine place and the bill was 50 bucks, had amazing service and great food... just shows just because the place is expensive doesnt necessarily mean its going to be good...we will NEVER dine here again.",1,0,0,Kerri S.,"Farmingdale, NY",7,84,37

For starters, everything is over priced and the food items are very petite. The appetizers were a rip off. I ordered crab legs for $29.00 and I received 3 crab legs broken into three pieces which made 6. Not enough to feed two people and it's considered a sharable item. I ordered a crab cake and it was a mini crab cake for $21.00. It's displayed on the menu as a jumbo lump crab cake and it wasn't. Very Misleading to say the least. I ordered two drinks and spent $50.00. Such a rip off. The dinner came and I ordered a steak and it was the size of my fist for $42.00.

5.0,2/22/2018,"Came here with the family for my mom's birthday.Decor/Atmosphere: The space and looks dark from the outside, and I was not the only one in my party who walked past the entrance the first time around.  Once you're inside, however it is a different story. It is a very nice space, with a bar in the front, and a large  seating area in the back. There is an enlarged black-and-white print on the far wall of a double-imposed flying boy  hovering over a bull.  There is a very nice chandelier/lighting fixture that spans about 10 to 20 feet hovering over the center of the room. Even the support beams are decorated with mirrors on every side.  Perhaps the coolest teacher, however is the wall of the house. There are 3 sections, each of which contains specially engraved knives for celebrities and VIP patrons/investors of the restaurant.Staff:  The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about food and wine. When my father began to ask the waitress about wines, she immediately sent the sommelier over. That night we had a lovely champagne, the good red wine, and amazing white burgundy.Service: The service was good. The waiters and waitresses were very attentive. Well the entire meal took about three hours from start to finish, it was a relaxed atmosphere that did not feel rushed-- a nice break from how some of the restaurants in New York City might behave.  A family friend of ours, who had recommended the restaurant to us, has one of the aforementioned engraved knives reserved for when he visits, and my dad requested it, assuring them that The owner is in you're up, and therefore would not miss it. They kindly obliged, and our family friend was delighted to see that not only were we enjoying the restaurant, but that we were using the knife in his honor.Food: The food here was very very good! I start out with fresh big pop out overs, still warm from being in the oven. We were then served a complement of the chef tuna tartare and little spoons, which were also quite tasty. A few of us had trouble ordering because everything on the menu looks quite delicious. I was torn between two salads, burrata caprice salad or the beat/goat cheese and two appetizers, (as opposed to salad) the lobster bisque or the bone marrow with toast. We also got a round of oysters for the table, One set of East Coast and one set of West Coast. I ended up going with the bone marrow, as it is barely seen in restaurants, and it was quite delicious. I was given two bones that have been cut in half(likely by saw) (so four half bones), topped with parsley, cilantro, and a few sweet red onions.  It was very tasty, but very rich, so I ended up wrapping up the last bone half so I would have room for my main course.  I had the boneless 16"" ribeye with the truffle béchamel sauce. My table neighbor order the same thing, but with the peppercorn brandy sauce. They were both quite exquisite. I traded bites with my dad for his Porterhouse cut, which was also quite tasty.  We also ordered A side of potatoes (which I could not partaking because I gave potatoes up for Lent), sautéed spinach (""creamed spinach"" is on the menu, but we asked if we could get sautéed instead, and the restaurant kindly obliged), And lobster mac & cheese (which honestly could win awards, it was so delicious!).  We surprise my mom with the dessert platter (which my dad ordered up on making a reservation to the restaurant).  It was A gorgeously decorated plate, with ""happy birthday Donna"" written in chocolate sauce along the border, and three desserts, including a 24-layer chocolate pudding cake, pear upside down cake with maple bourbon ice cream, and a vanilla cheesecake with strawberries.  I was pretty stuffed from dinner at this point, but the delicious draw of these three desserts allowed me to tap into the mythological ""second stomach specially reserved for desserts."" (I hear that the French actually have a third stomach for cheese in addition to this, which I suppose allowed me at that point to partake and eating the cheesecake ;) ). All in all, this restaurant was quite good. The only thing that might prevent me from coming back anytime soon would be the high price point for all the food.  During the ordering process, it was explained to me that this restaurant is often a ""expense place"", meaning that many patrons don't pay out-of-pocket, so much as they have their companies cover the bill. Was the food and service worth the price? I would say that it was quite good. If I had unlimited funds (or if they had a special deal, say during restaurant week), I would return here often-- and with relish!!

It was served with a delicious garlic and herb butter so that was a nice touch. Now onto the service, we had Scott as our server and I must say this establishment must be so proud to have such a valuable team member like him. He took his time making recommendation, provided genuine care, consistently checked on us, and surprised us with a miniature dessert as the grand finale. We ordered the bacon to start with the beer cheese and it was amazing! I ordered the Filet Mignon with Peppercorn Brandy sauce and completely finished my plate. We got the brussel sprouts as recommended by our server and they were so crispy and juicy from the bacon bits sprinkled on top. We also got the truffle tater tots which are presented as really large tots with a nice aioli on the side and those were also great. The ambiance is romantic but trendy and I will definitely be back for more. Thank you for a fantastic experience overall! Cheers!",1,1,1,Shantel Z.,"New York, NY",10,49,49
5.0,2/13/2018,"People of New York City ... I think I have done it... I have finally found the triple threat: cool ambience, amazing food, and unbelievable service. Hesitant maybe even reluctant at first because of how close it was to Times Square but to sum it up, ""wowwwww.""Started with prompt, very welcoming service from the moment we walked in - until we were seated at the table. This is where we went from an ordinary restaurant to truly a five star experience, Scott, our server earned the award for the true MVP. He is an unbelievable asset to the team and really cares for his customers - VERY HARD to find in midtown. He recommend the pork chop (5/5), glazed bacon (5/5), and Brussel sprouts (5/5)... thank you Scott - you definitely earned a couple local customers.Highly recommend, worth every penny!!",3,1,1,Derek O.,"New York, NY",206,62,236
1.0,2/12/2018,"My friends and I were looking forward to having an amazing dinner on Friday night but that experience took a turn for the worst. It began when we arrived and our reservation was set for the wrong date . (Granted they resolved it very quickly and sat us within in 10 minutes.) When we finally sat our waiter was extremely bothered as he defiantly assumed we were restaurant week patrons or cause we were young African American diners just by his attitude (not that I don't love a deal but I had no idea this restaurant even participated) He didn't offer us any drinks or any type of explanation regarding the menu and the portions as it was all our first time dining at the restaurant. We were charged for Still water and were never given the option to choose if we just wanted regular tap. Once the food arrived everything was made to perfection!!! (Only reason why I would ever go back) The waiter never checked if we were ok if we needed anything additional. Moving on to desert, I mentioned to him we were celebrating a birthday in hopes the desert would come with a candle like others celebrating around us...That was a a big NO! Once we received the desert and the bill (given at the same time) that was the last time we seen our waiter. We waited about 15 mins and still no waiter, I had to stop another server just to pay our bill (and we still left a tip), which I find ridiculous. And to make matters worse I received a phone call the next day Saturday for a  reservation for that day for 3 people which was no where close to my reservation of 5. Its very just disappointing  that an establishment which such great food had such horrible service.",1,0,0,Jessica B.,"Bronx, NY",0,2,0
3.0,2/11/2018,"2018 Restaurant Week review:I had never been to Hunt & Fish Club but decided to check it out, as it was NYC Restaurant Week. I ordered a delicious cocktail with mezcal, lime, and a mushroom truffle salt on the rim. It had a sprig of rosemary in it and it was super yummy, but the ice cubes in it were so big, it was hard to drink. I had to wait for them to melt a bit in order to have a decent sip.The popovers brought to the table were SO good, even plain, but definitely try the herbed butter they were served with!For my first course, I opted for the prosciutto, which was served with chunks of parmesan and pieces of blood orange. It was a nice dish, drizzled with balsamic. I was not pleased with my entree - I ordered the char (similar to salmon), but it was overdone. It was a huge piece, but I barely touched it. I should've sent it back but just didn't feel like bothering since I wasn't super hungry. The white beans and almonds underneath were SO good, though.Dessert - I went with the coconut profiteroles. They were very tasty, although they're large, and I had to ask for a knife to cut them, or else look like a pig trying to stuff the whole thing in my mouth. I asked for knives, but despite us being a table of 3, the waiter only brought us 2 knives (why?). Overall, I wasn't that impressed and probably will not return. I understand that NYC Restaurant Week menus do not always feature the best dishes, but I've had better fish at SO many restaurants, and this is the freakin Hunt and FISH Club!",0,0,0,Kimberly D.,"Yorktown Heights, NY",111,356,1582
5.0,2/11/2018,"I don't even know where to start...this place is ahh-mazing! The boyfriend and I came here for (an early) Valentines Day dinner Saturday night and I was in awe the minute we walked through the doors. The super romantic dining area is very spacious and dimly lit (which really set the mood). The ambiance is very upscale so come dressed to impress. There is also a decent sized bar area with a few couches, separate from the dining area, as soon as u walk in. So if ur not dressed in ur finest of linens u could always grab a drink at the bar. Now to the food. We basically ordered half the menu and everything tasted soooo good! We started with the grilled bacon and the baked shrimp as appetizers. The grilled bacon was MASSIVE and tasted like the best Christmas ham you've ever eaten. The baked shrimp came in a tomato sauce concoction and was delicious. Oh, I almost forgot the legendary popover bread they bring to the table. It came with a house made herb butter that I had to fight myself not to lick out of the container (trying very hard to remain classy here people). So freakin good. For entrees, I had the 24 oz bone in ribeye (cooked medium) with the truffle béarnaise sauce on the side. Best steak I've eaten. The boyfriend had the salmon and he loved it. We each ordered 2 sides (clearly we were very hungry): the creamed spinach (OMG), Parmesan Fries (OMG), truffle tater tots (OMG) and the lemon potatoes (Ehh). My least favorite of the sides was the lemon potatoes only because it had no lemon taste to it. But overall the meal was incredible. The servers were very attentive as well and even asked if we had a show to attend after dinner (I'm assuming in an effort to expedite our meal) which I thought was extremely gracious of them. Two thumbs up!Recommendations:- super cute for a fancy date night (anniversary, Valentine's Day, Birthday etc.)- reservations a MUST- pricey so be prepared to spend some $$$",0,0,0,Sarah S.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",43,13,35
2.0,2/9/2018,"I was looking forward to dining at Hunt & Fish Club after hearing so much about it. I was greeted pleasantly and after our coats were checked, seated promptly. After being seated, the waiter came with menus but failed to mention his name which should have been a sign as to how the night would progress. The seating was cramped to the point that a fellow guest commented it felt as if it was a speed dating event. We ordered the Crab Cake, Grilled Bacon, Hunger Steak and Panko Fried Chicken, all of which had no seasoning. To our surprised the Truffle Tatar Tots were seasoned and delicious. The Spiked Pear drink and the Chocolate Hazelnut cake were good as well. The waiter checked in with us once after the appetizers were served and once again after an hour wait for entrees. Overall Hunt & Fish Club provides beautiful ambiance but lackluster service. If your looking for a nice restaurant to take photos in this the place for you.

2.0,2/8/2018,"TL;DR Don't come here unless you have alllllllll night to have dinner.My husband and I were so looking forward to our fancy night out. We were going to have a nice dinner and see a Broadway show. I picked a place that was a block from the theatre, and made our reservations for 6:30 so we'd have plenty of time to enjoy our meal and not have to rush over to the theatre. The best laid plans....First off, the positives: The place itself is very beautiful. We each got a glass of wine, and they were delicious. The food was good, I think (you'll see why I'm not entirely sure), though I think they went a little crazy with the lemon dressing on the arugula salad.So, we're sat at 6:30. After a few minutes, we're given our menus. The dining room is about half full. About five minutes later, the server comes over to take our drink order. At least, I think he was our server. Again, it will become clear why I'm not sure. Five minutes after that, we get our drinks. We're enjoying them, sipping lightly because I like to wait for some food. Fifteen (yes) minutes later, we start to wonder aloud if anyone is going to take our order. A few minutes after that, a woman comes over and asks if we're ready to order. We do. A few minutes after that, the first server comes over, and seems surprised that we've ordered already. It's already a little past 7 at this point. We've been there for over a half an hour, and our server seemed surprised that we've put our order in. We were doing the Restaurant Week prix fixe, so apps, entrees, and desserts. The appetizers come out at around 7:10, and I try to start to relax. We still have 45 minutes to enjoy our meal. I'll skip the parts of anxiously looking around for an eternity for our entrees, how I actually broke down in frustrated and concerned tears because where is our food, how not a single person once came to check on us. I eventually flag down the man who I think is our server (again, he brought our wine, and that's been pretty much it till this point), and ask about our food. He says it's coming, that they're very busy. The dining area is 3/4's full at this point. At 7:35, over an hour after we arrived, our entrees came out. I had the fried chicken and my husband had the char, items that are notorious for taking a super long time to prepare, especially when they're ordered completely out of the blue and not from some sort of pre-determined menu (yes, sarcasm. I'm still annoyed). The food is dropped off by runners who don't even stop to ask if we need anything. I'm trying to get someone's attention to let them know that we're going to need our desserts to go, but no one will make eye contact with me. This place was full of hostesses, servers, runners, busers, and I couldn't get one person to look at me. I finally spotted the woman who had taken our order, so I start waving my arms at her. The initial server sees this, and comes rushing over. I tell him that we'll need our desserts to go and the check. It's now 7:40. I had wanted to leave at 7:50 to give us five minutes to get to the theatre and five minutes to get sat and comfortable. We have 10 minutes to scarf down our very hot entrees. We both agreed that they were good, we think. It's hard to tell when you're just trying to eat quickly and it's very hot. We finally have everything paid and ready at 7:50. We go to the hostess to get my husband's checked bag back. She leaves for two full minutes. When she finally comes back, I am not kidding, she has the wrong thing. She goes back for about for three minutes (I know all of this because I've been anxiously looking at my watch the entire time). It is now 7:55, and we literally run out the door and down the street. This was a horrible, horrible experience that literally drove me to tears. No one ever checked on us, no one ever seemed to care if we were enjoying ourselves, or that we were even there. I don't know what the excuse is, Restaurant Week, a server or cook didn't show, or if we just slipped through the cracks, but I have never felt so held hostage by a restaurant before.",0,0,0,Hayley N.,"San Francisco, CA",0,5,2
4.0,2/6/2018,"Note: This is Restaurant Week (Feb. 2018)-centric review.So, a friend of mine had a coworker cancel on him for RW reservations, so...having no reason to turn down a chance for good food, I had no problem tagging in. The venue is pretty interesting. The entrance opens up to short (but wide) bar area, and past the bar/hostesses is what looks like a pretty swanky event hall / dining room. Very nice, but I almost felt like I should be waiting for a Best Man's speech. The food: Bread - Popovers were served and promptly devoured with herbed compound butter. AWESOME.Apps - Prosciutto with Valencia Orange, Aged Balsamic, Parmesan - gorgeous looking dish, generous portion of prosciutto and chunks of parmesan. Very potent balsamic brought it all together.  My friend got the baccala fritters, which looked somewhat dainty, but likely good - as they were inhaled.Mains - Hanger Steak w Pizzaiola, Red Wine, Mushrooms, Herb Salad - lovely. I know many places do hanger steak for RW, it's true...but this was good. Really liked the mushroom/red wine reduction. My friend got the Panko Fried Chicken, as recommended by our server...and it was, indeed, really good. Can't go wrong with this guy or the steak.Dessert - Coconut profiteroles - light, lovely, amazing. I tried some of the Hazelnut Chocolate Tart - it was good, but I think I still won.All in all...I'm glad my friend's co-worker canceled.

We had a booth-seat in the corner which was next to a larger table of about 8. The owner knew individuals at the table and spent a good 10-15 minutes interacting with them, right around the time our main course arrived.

Which resulted in three grown men standing 4 ft from our table, laughing and conversing in a tone louder than talking due to the ambiance level (but not yelling).  To the point my wife and I complained to the manager as the group was in deep conversation. The manager stated (quote) ""he's the owner"" and did nothing to simply advise him, his interaction with his friends was ruining the dinner of a couple's 10 year anniversary.

3.0,12/21/2017,"The Four Seasons recommended this spot, and it was a disappointment. The location as well as the  ambiance is good. But the service, poor. Our party of 5 was seated, waited 15 minutes for the only waiter to fill our glasses with water, and his initial greeting was ""ready to order""? He seemed irritated when we suggested starting with a round of drinks and appetizers. It should be noted, our waters were never refilled nor were we asked if we'd like another beverage. None of the dishes can be altered in any way- for instance we requested a plain cheese flat bread, and the waiter said the flatbreads are pre prepared and just baked. For the price, i would expect better than a pre-made pizza. One of our children asked for pasta with butter, and he was unable to serve anything than what wasn't on the menu exactly. There were no specials or any description of featured entrees. I ordered a bloody beer and he said he didn't know what that was. The popovers are excellent, but the food was just average-it probably would of tasted better had our waiter not been so rude and angry.",1,0,0,Tulsa R.,"Bixby, OK",113,8,0

Staff gracious and attentive.Beet salad: good but somewhat bland, chunks of ingredients when i'd prefer a more homogenous mixture- if they doubled the pistachios, it would be sooooo delectable Brusselsprouts: too sweet for me, huge servingSteak: the flame/grill was too hot when cooking my steak.

5.0,11/27/2017,"In my opinion this place deserves all the accolades it has been receiving since it opened a couple of years ago.  The place exudes class.  The dining room is beautiful as is the bar in front.  The hostess station is ""manned"" by some very charming ladies.  I shared a porterhouse with my daughter and it was one of, if not the best one ever.  It was served on a metal dish and did not have that buttery taste that some other steaks have in other steak places.  The creamed spinach was also delicious.  The Caesar and the chopped wedge salad were excellent starters.  The complimentary popovers are about as good a bread basket as you will see anywhere.  This place really cares about its clientele as I saw the manager making the rounds of the dining room and stopping at many, if not all tables, including our own.I scored major points with my daughter for taking her to this ""hot"" place when in walked Bob Saget and his fiancé.

5.0,11/1/2017,"I just went here this past Saturday and absolutely loved my experience. I went with a group of about 12 people for my friend's birthday dinner. I have to admit when I found out my friend picked a steakhouse located in Time's Square for his birthday dinner I was disappointed. Right in Times Square, seriously? I felt like a complete tourist on the ride up, but this place is worth the crowded traffic buzzing outside. Bread: The bread they dropped off at our table was some of the best bread I have eaten in a really long time. The bread is large, doughy circles hollow on the insides. I could have continue eating that bread and forgot everything else on the menu. Truffle tater tots:JUMBO! Served to us piping hot with a large enough quantity to share with a friend. Delicious.Main course: King Crab Spaghetti: The pasta was cooked to perfection. The ratio to crab meat and pasta was just right. I was beyond happy with my main course selection. I tried both the 100 year old cognac ice cream and cheesecake selections. Both delicious. Service: Everyone was so kind. Our entire group felt very well treated all night long. The waiters were there exactly when we needed them and gone when we were in the midst of enjoying each other's company. I definitely want to come back and try one of their seafood towers.

4.0,10/21/2017,"Let's get some good food in Times Square (said no one ever....successfully) - until!!! Hunt & Fish club is that place. I mean legit food. Bring an important client legit. The bar out front is an acceptable please to start but I've had better service. They also didn't want to transfer the bar tab to the table check - not as expense account friendly as I'd have hoped.No worries as the food is the main event. For starters, If you're into seafood towers they will not disappoint. However the secret side order item is definitely the truffle tater tots. They are jumbo marshmallow sized and insanely delicious. Don't eat more than one or they'll roll you out. In the main department you'll enjoy their fish of the day (especially if it's the halibut) or the on-menu branzino (ask for it to be deboned). Where you might want to keep the bone in is the rib eye - steakhouse grade! Save room though for the dessert. Go straight for the 24 layer cake (confirmed - 24 layers- see my picture) and share (it's pretty big).",1,2,1,anthony r.,"Brooklyn, NY",444,137,1805
4.0,10/18/2017,"It's pricey, popular, gets crowded even on weeknights, so you best have reservations. If you don't, they don't mind telling you as they told me ""there will be about a 2 hour wait."" But lucky for me, I found a seat at the bar. The décor of the area near the bar is near men's club like, warm and charming. The rear dining area boarders on being somewhat gaudy but not tastelessly so. You just have to keep in mind that you are in New York.  The food at Hunt & Fish Club, however, is top notch, very good with their HFC Three Course lunch for $38 being of particularly good value. For my dinner meal I went for their 8 ounce filet mignon with additional sauce ($48) along with a side of Parmesan fries ($14) and a Maker's Mark Manhattan ($16). When served, my steak was not only eye appealing but prepared exactly as order. My Parmesan fries were likewise good as was my cocktail which contained real extra sweet maraschino wine soaked as opposed to red brined cherries. The only thing preventing me from going Five Stars on Hunt & Fish Club is that the menu isn't all that innovative or creative that would mark it as being superlative or exception as compared to other restaurants in its same class.",11,3,6,Marqus R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1552,3745,17344

3.0,8/18/2017,"Tried this place out for restaurant week early Thursday evening so it wasn't crowded. Service was fine and the decor made it memorable. Of note, the temperature needs to be better controlled. The majority of my party was freezing the entire time and even the drinks (great wine selection) couldn't warm us up- helpful tip, bring a cardigan!For the food, we tried all four appetizers from the RW menu: poached egg & mushrooms, burrata, fried polenta, and oysters- listed in order from best to worst IMO. If I was rating solely based on that poached egg & mushrooms dish, this place would be a 5 star. Perfect egg with amazingly seasoned mushrooms over a spinach sauce that was heavenly- really good! It's hard to go wrong with burrata over prosciutto but nothing special; the fried polenta was decent but the glops of honey everywhere made it cloyingly sweet; and the oysters were a bit too salty (FYI don't eat the foundation the 3 oysters came out on because its inedible salt...)We also tried all four main entrees: Arctic char, hangar steak, chicken, and bolognese. The fish was by far the best, with a great crispy seared skin and juicy filet. The steak was fine but a dish of very small portion- the many burnt potatoes around the few pieces tricked us into thinking there was more meat! The chicken also had amazingly crispy skin but the meat was extremely dry and tough... and the bolognese pasta was fine but pretty doughy and heavy on the butter. Overall the dishes were decent but nothing remarkable. The desserts were probably the most disappointing as the cake, gelato, and sorbet were all very sour and heavy on the acids which definitely did not satisfy the sweet tooth craving to end the meal...",1,0,0,Jinny C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,49,290

It is still overpriced (however a Gilt City coupon fixed that), but I really had a nice meal and lovely surroundings with attentive service.First, came an amuse bouche.  I think it was a risotto ball, which was very good with excellent flavor.Initially they forgot to bring their popovers, but one of the waiters realized that and brought them over and glad he did.  One does not see popovers very often, but these were perhaps the best I have ever had.  They were moist and had a consistency inside a bit like custard.  Fabulous.  They came with herb butter, but I also used olive oil.  The oyster presentation was very nice.The strip steak was 16 oz bone-in at $62 which is way too much for a bone-in.  It would be high if it were without the bone, but way too high for a bone-in.  Also, it was a bit small for a steak lover.  It really should have been 18 oz., if not 20 oz. given the bone.The mashed potatoes portion for $14 was very large. They were very good, but too creamy for my taste. I really prefer a lumpier and less creamy mashed.For dessert, the Twenty-Four Layer Chocolate Pudding Cake at $18 is very good.  More than enough for two or even three.  I generally prefer a flourless cake, but with so many layers and so much thick ganache between each layer, it is definitely pleasing to a chocoholic.

We left him a big tip as a result. The table we were at was wobbly. Fabio called over a bus boy who seemed to want nothing to do with the task of sticking something under the table leg. Which showed when the guy then disappeared on us for 10 minutes and we had to prompt the waiter once more to fix it. The food was mixed. The crab cocktail was good and the iceberg wedge was so so. Most disappointing were the steaks. One was the 24 oz bone in ribeye and a 16 bone in ny strip.  They had too much spice rub on them which felt like it was there to mask the subpar cuts of meat. My medium rare came in medium to medium plus. For $65 pieces of meat , it was definitely not worth it.

2.0,6/19/2017,"I have to say I was really looking forward to dining here for a birthday celebration.  The dining room is attractive but somehow a bit cold in feeling.  The service at the bar was very good and we were seated close to our reservation time.  Since this is a theater district restaurant it cleared out on a Saturday night right around 7 PM so that felt very strange.  We had a waiter with a very difficult to understand accent and I have no problem working with that except he did not appear to understand us at all.  As an example, with dessert described as a sundae,  I asked for hot fudge and he told me they did not have that, then he told me they have ""chocolate sauce"", huh?  Anyway the biggest problem is average food for exorbitant prices.  If I pay $50 plus for a steak, it should be wonderful instead I had a heavily seasoned boneless rib eye with minimal flavor, my sister had the filet mignon and it was just acceptable. A good steak does not require this heavy handed presentation.  The whole Branzino was quite good but pricey The popovers that came before dinner were tasty but they were huge and just too much.  Pre-dinner oysters were fresh and tasty, a salad was average and the strip of bacon was delicious. I could not even give this three stars because it falls into that category of restaurants that rely on their proximity to the theater district and then serve overpriced average food.Not going back and I do not recommend it.",1,0,0,Connie M.,"Bethpage, NY",0,4,0
1.0,6/11/2017,"The only good thing I can say about this restaurant is that they cooked my steak properly Sadly, I can't say good things about the quality (despite the very high price tag)a, as I found out that it was generically sourced and had bovine growth hormone in it... which my wife is horribly allergic to. She had the scallops instead, which were awful. The bread was burnt, the asparagus was burnt, the other vegetables were drenched in vinegar, and the scallops were still raw in the middle. Service was... acceptable, the waiter did try to find out about the growth hormones in both the steak and the ice cream sundaes for dessert, but sadly, since the restaurant only uses cheap ingredients, it did no good.",1,0,0,Dustin H.,"Fresno, CA",3,28,0

4.0,2/23/2017,"Hunt & Fish is a hidden gem. It's a relatively new spot that's inconspicuous amongst the neon and flashing signs of Midtown restaurants.  It's not a ""club"" but the entryway might give off that kind of vibe with the heavy velvet curtains and dark accents. But wait until you become mesmerized by the white room and the ceiling lights.So I came here for lunch during restaurant week and the options on the their menu were quite enticing and definitely a lot more variety compare to the typical RW menus. It catered to carnivores, pescetarians, and vegetarians alike. Instead of choosing the other unique items on the menu, I decided to go for their Fried Chicken. I probably deserve a slap on the wrist for that but you know what, it was totally worth it. Huge portions of two fried chicken breasts  with a side of sweet potato fries that's bigger than the size of your entire KFC order. I have to say the honey on the side was a bit of an oddball. Was I supposed to dip the chicken breast into the mini sauce cup or vice versa? Nevertheless, I did not regret my decision. But wait, let's talk about their popover bread and baked clam appetizers. Possibly the most amazing popover bread I've ever had. It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I could literally eat a whole tray of that for lunch and call it a day. The baked clams with creamy spinach were excellent as well. Perfectly cooked and lots of flavor. Based on these two items, I could tell it was the beginning of an amazing dining experience. Unfortunately, good things don't last all the time but it was good while it lasted.  I ended my meal with  dessert but options were a little flat. It was either ice cream..or more ice cream. Well I should say one came with a pear tart. I ended up getting just a regular gelato but they only offered vanilla. It was ok with me until they served and I noticed two scoops where one looked slightly off-color. The one that looked normal tasted like vanilla but the off-color one was a mystery and it was not good! It tasted nothing like any flavor I've ever had in my life so I don't know maybe it was some exotic umami flavor?? So I asked the waitress and she said it's vanilla but when she saw the color, she went back to the kitchen to confirm. Then she said it was something banana flavor, which is so not true. I wasn't going to fight for it but at least I got some vanilla out of it.",3,1,0,Rowena Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",480,1179,549

The hostess then walks you into a chic low light room with the most fabulous chandelier/lighting fixture. I wish I had gotten our waiters name because he was amazing, helpful & very attentive. I was there earlier in the night around 6 PM so that could account for it - as the place was not exactly packed. I had a delicious cocktail called the Sound Machine. It had pineapple juice so it was the perfect amount of sweet. I am not 100% sure what kind of liquor was in it. But the drink was great. We started off with oysters and the crab cake. The oysters according to my mother were the best she's had. Although I cannot attest I did not have any but I do trust her on this. The crab cake was perfect - it came with a dipping sauce and an apple cole slaw. Also, we were given a tasting of a salmon crostini that was DIVINE ! The bread for the table are rosemary popovers that can only be described with the word WOW. From just the first half of the meal I was blown away. For my entree I ordered ""Max's Lobster Lasagna"" which is not like a normal lasagna at all. It was layers of Long thick pasta and lobster with the greatest San marzano fresh tomato sauce. The lasagna I would compare to a savory cinnamon bun. It was so innovative I love it !My mother had the swordfish which she also was over the moon about. For dessert we ordered the carrot cake with the bourbon ice cream. The carrot cake was my least favorite part of the meal but the bourbon ice cream was fantastic ! I had never had a liquor infused ice cream and I am upset I hadn't tried one sooner.

Service: the service was soooo slow. We sat down at 8 and didn't leave the restaurant until 1030. The waiter was not friendly AT ALL and the meals took forever to come out. We did go during restaurant week so perhaps they treated customers differently on restaurant week? Isn't the point of restaurant week to have customers come back not give half ass service for half price ?

The appetizers were good but a bit over priced but that is typical Manhattan. I loved the French onion soup with braised short rib.  My husband had their famous bone marrow with pickled onions.  It was bland and flavor less and the onions were awful.  The oysters were small but the  the salad was decent.  For entrees we had the branzino with lemon caper and pesto sauce and it was great.  However the scallops were bland and they only gave you 4 for 40 bucks!  The filet mignon was what you would expect and the stuffed lobster, according to 2 people, was delicious albeit 85.00.Do not order the $14.00 tater tots or the $32.00 lobster Mac and cheese.  The tots were not much better than the frozen kind and the lobster Mac was watery and tasteless. Mac and cheese was 16 plus additional 16 for add in of lobster.  Capital Grill has a very good lobster Mac for 19.00 that is delicious.  Our waiter was very nice but not at all attentive. We found ourselves looking around for him multiple times.  Lastly, they presented me with a nice variety of desserts as they sang happy birthday but other than the banana ice cream I could  take it or leave it.  Ricotta cheese cake was ok but the chocolate cake was bland.  Don't think I'll be rushing there again anytime soon.",2,2,0,A.

Furthermore, we were there with a party, and the staff was annoyingly attentive. It is great when staff waits on the table, but the staff was too pushy, and kept butting in between people to clean and spill water when people weren't finished.

We were led to a 1980's style basement with a musty, sewer smell and a jazz pianist who was clearly there to avert attention from the dim lighting (no doubt a diversion as well), sad curtain-esque hangings around the walls (a poor attempt at style & coziness) and the stretch limo looking mirrored and star-lit ceiling.   We joined people in jeans and toboggan's who likely did not have reservations.  Bright spots (other than the mirrored, star-lit ceiling) was a pleasant waitress, a well-seasoned  chopped wedge salad and lovely pop overs.  Downers:  horrid bone marrow - and I love well executed bone marrow. This was underdone, poorly seasoned and brought none of the beautiful unctuousness that most marrows exude.  For those who don't like bone marrow it's likely because they tasted something akin to this.  Rib-eye was not well-cooked.  Baked shrimp appetizer tasted like ammonia - anyone in the biz knows what this means.  In short, not worth the time or money.  Over-hyped.

When I had first made the reservation at 9:30 for my 9 year-old son and I, I didn't realize how long our Broadway show would last. Once I checked the times I had moved our reservation back to 10. The hostess from the restaurant then called me to let me know that they couldn't hold my reservation at that time because the kitchen closed at 9:30, so I would have to arrive at 9:30, or not be able to be seated. I expressed that I couldn't make any promises because we'd just be getting out of our show, but that we would try. I thought it would be rather pointless, but we still high tailed it out of our show at 9:30 and headed over there. On our way the way over I received a call from the hostess who called to tell me that they would accept me to eat if I was on my way. We arrived at about 9:40 and the staff and manager were very welcoming, despite them closing at 10. They took the time to ask about how our show was, and escorted us to our table.

It's elegant, it's high quality, it's downright perfect. The branzino with pesto is just about the best I've ever eaten. They kept it whole for me, as requested, and simply doted on us as we devoured. My dining companion raved about her bone-in sirloin, dry aged and cooked to pink perfection. To top it off, crispy Brussels sprouts was an absolute winner (although, at $12 for a side, I'd expect it). I don't do swine, so they kept the bacon bits separated for me.

My filet mignon was good but not the best quality I have had for the price. The shrimp add on to my steak came in 4 huge ginormous sizes and were quite fresh. All the main dishes of steaks and seafood complements were decent. Two things that I did not like from this restaurant were the French Onion Soup. It barely had any onions and onion flavor. It was basically beef soup with not too much cheese either.Another item that wasn't the best was the bone marrow.

1.0,5/1/2016,"Worst dining experience i have ever experienced in my life all because of the manager and poor communication from staff. The manager was insulting and useless. I travelled all the way from California to this disappointment. I never leave reviews but the manager was so terrible that i could not stand not to.  If I could give 0 stars i would. Not for food and not for services 100% but because of management alone. I visited this restaurant as part of a bridal party of 10 ppl on a sunday night around 7:30pm. The restaurant is actually a quite beautiful place to dine and initially service was spectacular.  Everything went downhill after placing our food orders.Appetizers came out very quickly they served large delicious bread rolls which was nice. I happened to have a problem with my appetizer which was the crab cake, it was too salty for me. I never return things to the kitchen, plus i am pregnant so i know things can taste differently to me, but after i had a few people try it and agree i asked the waiter if i could change for something different. He said no problem and brought out my second appetizer away. The problems arised when the communication stopped after that and the entrees were delayed. My sjster the bride questioned the delays on the entrees and was told 2 times by the server that it would be 20 to 25 minutes because of the way the dish needed to be prepared. After over an hour of waiting for entrees they all came together and it was delicious but everyone agreed the servers lack of communication and explanation of reasoning for the delays was very disturbing a d should be addressed, especially considering there were only 2 other tables where there was anyone dining . We politely asked to speak to a manager who basically blamed everything on the chef wanting everything to be perfect and come out on time, and quite possibly had to refire several dishes for this reason. We explained that that would have been fine if better communicated by our server. What bugged me  the most about the manager was his need to repeat that it was a fine dining experience and the difference between service delivery and expectation i guess at a guess a less expensive restaurant. I found this very insulting, as if we never experienced fine dining before. Poor excuse of a manager.After giving up on this guy and chalking the experience up and was time for the check. I noticed on the bill the appetizer i ordered and returned was still on the check. We asked the server if it could be removed. He asked for guess who... the manager . This guy comes over and basically says the chef would not allow for it to be taken off the bill because there was 2 bites from it.   Heres my thing, at what point do you make the customer aware, and at what point, as a manger do you quit blaming everyone else and excercise some control and handle the situation to save the dining experience for your customers,unless of course we were say an average joe like myself. He refused to remove it. I believe that the color of  our skin or less than elite status impacted the service delivery from this manager. What a shame hunt and fish.

3.0,4/3/2016,"First let me start out saying the ambiance in this restaurant is beautiful.  The bar area is quite nice and the dining room is warm and inviting...Unfortunately, the dining experience  was not the greatest...Our waiter seemed to be very polite and personal when approaching the table... He took the order and that was it!   Didn't see him again till it was check time...he never came to the table once during the meal asking how everything was or if we needed anything..The food was just average... The Ravioli appetizer was 4 pieces of pasta  that needed to be cooked longer..too chewy....I know "" al dente"". But this was more like "" al don'te"".    The steaks were good but the veal porterhouse was tough and seasoned with such a  salty rub , more to disguise the veal rather than enhance it... The food was served without a steak knife, and so we had to try and catch the managers attention as our waiter was not around.

5.0,3/14/2016,"What a beautiful experience at Hunt & Fish Club NYC. From the moment my wife and I walked in we were greeted like royalty. The Hostess immediately checked our coats and bags to make sure we were comfortable while dinning. We were then whisked away to our beautiful table which provides us with an amazing view of the entire Resteraunt. Breathtaking indeed. Here is a break down of the food, ambiance and staff we enjoyed so much. This place is a must visit for anyone who loves quality food. Manager: Mr. Moon was an amazing host and courteous. He came over to our table and personally introduced himself. We had a wonderful conversation about our native lands and how blessed we were to have the amazing blessings we have today. His energy let us know that we were getting ready to have one of the best dinning experiences we've had in years. His kindness was refreshing in an industry overwhelmed with mediocrity. Waiter: George was truly an amazing man who kept us company until our waitress Sharon was available. Team work at its finest! Waitress: Sharon (smiley) what an amazing women. Her attention to detail and attentiveness was beyond compare. I call her ""Smiley"" because her beautiful smile lit up the room and her knowledge of the menu was very helpful when we needed to decide what we wanted! I felt courageous and asked her to pick a drink based on what I usually like and she nailed it. She chose a drink called: The Mitch Robins and I was beyond impressed!!! It reminded me of spiked egg nog in the best way!!! It was nostalgic and delicious all in one. I would tell you what's in it but you should experience it for yourself! Amazing Bread: everything you love about bread in the shape of a beautiful mushroom. I call them Mushrooms of joy! Flakey, buttery, and cheesy..... Delicious!! Bone Marrow: absolutely delicious! To date the best bone marrow I've had in a years! Seasoned to perfection. We spread it on what I believe was Rye toast with Caramelized Onions and parsley..... My taste buds were dancing. King Crab Linguine: the pasta was cooked to perfection with a sauce I would sincerely drizzle on anything!!!! AMAZING!!! I will be ordering that next time I stop by. Great choice for an appetizer or a light meal. creamed spinach: let me just say this..... If there was a pool filled with this spinach not only would I dive in but I would protect it like a raging wolf! GET THE SPINACH!!! Don't think about..... Just do it!!! Trust me on this one! Bone in Rib Eye: COOKED TO PERFECTION!!! The chefs hands have been kissed by GOD!!! I am truly in awe! No need for a description. This is a must taste and hopefully they still have the truffle butter to drizzle on it. Heavenly Truffle Tater Tots: these delicious Potatoe bites blew me away! With just enough truffle oil infused to make this classic fresh and new.  They complimented my meal to perfection. If you are in NYC please treat yourself to one of the finest dinning experiences you can ever have. There is something on the menu for the most sophisticated taste buds to the taste buds that just love to eat!!! Make sure you tell them Lucky Church sent you!!! It's an experience you will never forget.",3,0,1,Walter S.,"Bronx, NY",550,26,8
5.0,3/13/2016,"Beautiful place, great service and exceptional service.  Went here for a meeting but was flabbergasted by the quality of the food and spot on service.  I had the bone marrow and then the ribeye.  The bone marrow was a flintstone size bone which held so much marrow that it was if you took a stick of butter and sliced it in half length wise.  The ribeye was cooked perfectly and the manager came over to make sure it was ""medium rare with a little seat"" as requested (which it was). My buddies had a ribeye and the other the Bronzino, which disappeared except the bones and the head (minus the cheeks).  The only complaint was that we barely had enough room for dessert.  The 24 layer cake was beautifully made and should not be missed.",0,1,0,Way S.,"New Hyde Park, NY",64,65,139

Jennifer, who is barely 5 feet tall, took our very heavy coats and checked them for us. I felt like the coats weighed more than she did but she did it with a smile. I had the scallops and he had the lemon chicken. We loved our meals. The waiter was very attentive and made sure that we would be done in time for curtain call.

I don't want to call it a TOURIST TRAP as I work nearby and appreciate restaurants that can provide a good experience but this was below subpar Big table with appetizers, all steaks and side dishes. Many wine bottles. I can't say the service was bad (pregnant lady that manages the place was attentive) though I can't call it fabulous (young guy that took our order refused a small request) That said, the steaks were TERRIBLE, they had an after taste so bad I and others could not finish our steaks.

Will request that next time. Hear the tater tots amazing; will look forward to them on another visit.

I went early on a Thursday evening for a business dinner and enjoyed pretty much my entire experience. My dining companion and I were looking for a place to talk privately, but the trendy and quite lovely layout of the restaurant did not allow for this. Although, the restaurant did try to accommodate us as best they could. We spent some time looking over the wine list and menu and were never rushed to place an order. However, after you shoo away the waiter a few times, they are usually reluctant to come back and take your order. We finally were able to place our orders. I started with the New York Chopped Salad and it was quite good. For my entree, I had the Swordfish and it was tasty. My dining companion had the Salmon for his entree and very much enjoyed it. The marble bar in the front of the restaurant looked inviting and on another occasion I will stop there for a drink.

3.0,1/18/2016,"Oh I wanted to love this place, especially since my wife picked it herself for her birthday. The decor is amazing but that's the least important thing in my book.Oysters were not fresh but I didn't want to complain so just added some extra horseradish. Burrata was very bland. No flavor and a poorly executed appetizer. Linguine & Crab was okay, pasta was a tad overcooked.Albeit, many bones left (easiest fish to filet), Branzino was probably the only hit at our table.Swordfish was good but the artichoke hearts was so bitter I was cringing with each bite. They didn't have the dessert that we ordered so we were offered a complimentary substitute. Service was decent. At one point, waitress was mia and other people were taking care of us.

5.0,1/9/2016,"Where do I start...... The interior is amazingly beautiful and intimate. The staff welcomes you and makes suggestions good ones at that. What I also liked is that the general manager walked around and introduced his self making sure that everyone was comfortable and not in the need of anything. This is definitely a plus and would make me come again. I ended up ordering the seared scallops with lobster Mac n cheese and my date ended up ordering the 8 oz filet with mash potatoes. Prior to ordering our food we ordered patron margaritas which were strong lol but good. One was enough for me but two were good for my date. They also have a good wine menu but the drinks were fine. When my food came, there was crab meat in the middle and the sauce around the plate made the entire entree!!!!! The scallops were seasoned well and fulling. My date added the truffle butter to his steak but the sauce was what balanced it. It was kinda like a honey bbq sauce. So when I tried a piece with the butter and sauce on it I was a little upset he didn't offer me another piece lol. It was so tender and delicious!!!!! He also said the mash potato was good. I was too busy on the lobster Mac n cheese. I think the price is reasonable (some may say a little pricey) for the service, delicious food and scenery. The music also compliments the scenery. I can't not wait to go back again!!!! Thank you very much. Also the lobster bisque was right on!! Not to creamy or thick but just right. Make sure you save room for dessert.

Between the extremely helpful sommelier to our delightful waitress, we left feeling extremely well take care of. We chose the Hunt and Fish Club for a steak dinner prior to the theater - definitely a convenient location for that. As many of the other reviews state, it is a great atmosphere - the lighting and decor are a nice touch for a romantic dinner. On to the food ...I loved the bread (my boyfriend was so-so on it) - light, slightly sweet. We shared a wedge salad, which is always a personal fav and followed that up with the linguini and clams which was a delicious choice - great sauce and flavor with the right textures all around. For our mine courses, I went with the filet while my boyfriend chose the ribeye. Both of us were very happy with our choices. For a side we went with the lemon potatoes - which were not particularly remarkable. In hindsight, we made a mistake in not going with the truffle tater tots. Unfortunately, we didn't have time for dessert because we needed to get to the theater but the dessert options sounded fantastic. The only negative I have would be related to cost but as with most places in NY, I feel that there is an up charge for being in NY. I would say the same meal home (Detroit area) would have been about $100 less. But, for a bottle of wine, salad, middle course and entree, this was on par for NY.

Our entries of branzino and salmon arrived after one hour (7:15pm)!  I must admit the food was excellent, but we were unable to appreciate it because we were now rushed to eat.  At 7:40 pm our elusive waiter appears with dessert menus!  I very politely told him we did not have any more time to eat & my husband requested the check.  Needless to say, we will NOT BE RETURNING.  It is truly a shame about the service because the food was really wonderful.",1,0,0,Marcia G.,"Cortlandt Manor, NY",0,17,0

2.0,8/23/2015,"So I was not able to review this on my open table account since I had called to make the reservation and did not do it via open table but I felt as if I needed to share my experience with others. Let me just start by saying the menu prices online do not match the actual menu prices in the restaurant. For example, the online menu shows that the Grilled Branzino is $32, whereas the real price was actually $46. Also, the online menu contained items that did not even exist on the paper menu. Another example: The Baked Little Neck Clams are listed on the virtual menu as an appetizer, which got me excited because I LOVEEE clams. Getting there in person, this was not even an option anywhere on the menu! For the overall ambiance, the place was dead quiet, barely had any people there on a Saturday night and little to no music at all. The service was fine, however all portions were EXTREMELY SMALL. One of the appetizers we ordered was a seafood salad which was mixed with 5 different types of seafood. I went with my parents and this was not something that the 3 of us could have shared. IT WAS BASICALLY EMPTY. We made light out of the situation and laughed it off. My mother ordered a glass of white wine. Now their wine glasses are extremely large and deep so I was expecting there to be a decent amount of wine in there. The waiter literally poured a drop (not his fault, obviously) and I then realized the over sized wine glasses are there to make people think they are getting more than they are actually getting. I ordered the salmon, it was alright, but came with nothing on the side or on the dish except 3 asparagus. The side dishes come in good sized portions, the mashed potatoes were good.

Otherwise again this place is a solid 4 but 2nd time round same mistakes means I'm dropping 2 stars. This time we didn't even get asked if we wanted drinks apart from water right at the beginning. The waiter also didn't ask us if we wanted any sides, which we did and just forgot to ask for, but he should have been trying to upsell us anyway and should have asked, amateur. Especially when the dishes were so small that we 100% would need some sides. Maybe, like us, he thought for the incredibly high prices we were paying per dish the plate would be packed full of food. But it wasn't. My client asked if he could deviate from the menu a little, answer 'maybe we could grill you a salmon"".Just like last time the waiters all disappeared after our food arrived so it took a good 5 mins to flag one down and order a side to share to compliment out tiny, expensive entrees. Just like last time they were no where to be seen at the end when we wanted the check. I'd have gotten much better service in Applebee's or Olive Garden. As for the food, we split some delicious Atlantic and Pacific oysters to start, then I had the halibut and my client had the Branzino with sea bass - he just wanted the Seabass but they couldn't do that apparently, which is when the waiter said he could have salmon. How can you not give more Seabass (which is already on the plate/menu) but CAN give salmon which isn't even on the menu?Anyway, despite the good location, amazing interior and very good food in general, I am done with this place. I'll stick to some more solid, reliable business lunch spots in Midtown like Wolfgang's, Vitae, Quality Meats and Quality Italian. Note to the owner/manager: go check out these places and see how they work, and go poach some new waiters from Applebee's, I guarantee they'll be an improvement.",8,4,1,Tom B.,"Round Rock, TX",75,247,11

2.0,8/1/2015,"I don't usually write reviews, but feel I must after my experience at Hunt & Fish Club. I've had many steaks at the usual NYC places - from BLT to Luger to Keen's - and can say without equivocation that the ""Kosher"" cut (that's the name of it) ribeye was a steak that takes me back to the days of Ponderosa steak house or maybe the old Times Square 'jewel"" - Tad's. Dry, tasteless, and I literally had to saw it aggressively to cut it. After being assured thrice ' we get the best cuts from the best butchers from all over the city"" - I find that hard to believe - or the kitchen knows how to murder a good piece of meat - which takes some doing. We had the additional issue of a guy parking himself at the end of a 4 top table so that his back was right up against our table. He was quite animated in conversation and was very close to toppling our glasses of wine with his elbows- I pointed this out to our waiter. He must have been a regular/friend of management because of instead of making the guy move, they had the entire row of tables slide over so he could stay in his ""spot"". Never seen that move before at a high end restaurant. It's a good looking room - the constellation of lights overhead is a nice touch. The pricing is definitely at the very high end (even compared to the very best NYC steak houses) and tailored for maximum drain of the expense account.",3,1,0,Richard R.,"New York, NY",0,3,0

5.0,4/25/2015,"Just went to HFC on a Friday night for dinner with 3 other friends. Staff was very accommodating and friendly and got seated in a nice cozy booth. Decor- love it. Old school feel, lots of marble and mirrors with really nice paintings/artwork tastefully highlighted. several different rooms with the main 'white' room with its huge chandelier, the 'green' room thats for larger group reservation, skylight ceiling and live plant wall and the 'blue' room downstairs by the huge glass wine fridgeration that would be perfect for private parties/bdays/etc as it has its own bar down thereFood - They serve popovers (instead of regular complimentary table bread) and they were warm and fresh and amazing with butter! Table order:-Starter: Roasted Bone Marrow and 3 leaf caesar as starter. Salad was good but typical, nothing to rave about and the Bone Marrow was very good and wasn't chintzy with the marrow. I could have used more toast to spread it on!- Entrees: Branzino (great according to friend, but note it is served as a whole fish), Pan Roasted Halibut (very tasty and light and loved the jumbo crab lumps in it), Burnt lemon Chicken (friend liked it and decent but i personally didn't think it was anything to write home about) and Bourbon Braised Short Ribs (huge portion, tender and came with bed of smashed potatoes). Also got the Ricotta Agnolotti for the table which i personally thought was excellent (a ravioli type dish but very tasty). -Sides:  Mac n Cheese (was expecting something tastier and richer, it was just typical shells/cheese), Brussel sprouts with Bacon Vinaigrette (i don't usually eat B sprouts but i gobbled these up!) and truffle tater tots (probably the highlight of side dishes, perfectly fried and must try if you like truffles!)-Dessert: Everyday Sundae. Menu doesn't even describe the insanity that it is which is probably why most don't order it and go for the fancier desserts. Homemade rich and creamy vanilla ice cream and pretty much every topping imaginable on it. A 5 yr olds dream. Comes in huge pretty bowl and easily feeds 4, my group didn't even finish it because we were so stuffed by the end of the night!Overall, definitely would come back here, it is pricey, best to come on corporate cards or deep pockets.

The food was excellent!I believe that a steakhouse should be judged solely on the quality of their steak and the porterhouse at HFC was incredible... Cooked to perfection and juicy.

After ordering the porterhouse I was expecting a sizzling, caveman sized hunk of meat cooked to perfection. What I got was cooked well, but thinner than I expected and luke warm at best.

This restaurant is in the Time Square area which finding parking and /or walking thru TS to get there is a total nightmare. The restaurant is beautiful, very masculine with dark tones mixed with white and beautiful lighting and art work. We got there a bit early but out table was ready. We started out with some Malbec and Rioja ($13) which was lovely, and their tuna tar-tare with mango and pineapple. The tar-tare ($22) was just OK for me, nothing really that blew my socks off, I've definitely had better. My GF ordered the Grilled Branzino ($32)  which I had a bite of and I found it pleasing. I had the 18oz dry aged bone in sirloin ($53) website says $49. I found my steak to be just OK. I wished that it had some oomph to it for the price but it was just a piece of steak that was thrown on the grill. it lacked flavoring/seasoning. That was a bit disappointing but all in all it wasn't terrible. We capped it with a piece of prailine crusted cheesecake which was pretty good and definitely for two people ($12) Setting,atmosphere wise it's a great date place to have some drinks.

Its also literally right next to times square. Service was definitely exquisite and our waiter was mad knowledgeable. Food-Oxtail and bone marrow French Onion Soup: I always love french onion soup. But sometimes it could be too salty. This one was just perfect. Perfect glaze and delicious oxtail inside. I could also taste the difference of the soup broth due to the bone marrow. I would still order the bone marrow appetizer and this if u really love bone marrow.Dry Aged Rib Eye: Delicious and perfectly crisp. I ordered it med rare and it coulda been a lil more rare. It was more like a med rare plus but I order that sometimes too as well so it was fine for me. It also comes with this really unique sauce. Guaranteed you'll never have tried that sauce anywhere else.Lamb Ragu: One word. Delicious. If ur lookin for pasta, uve found your dish. Its also got good chunks of meat. Very well done for sure.Lobster Mac and Cheese: My friend really enjoyed this. I think it coulda been a lil more cheesy, but it was still bomb. Great pieces of lobster added into it, and they made it so that it didnt have that seafoodyness, which I thought was impressive.Truffle Tater Tots: Best side of the night for me hands down. The sauce it comes with is super good. However, just the texture of the tater tots itself was insane. Instead of crumbling, it stretches. The flavor was also magnificent.Panna Cotta: One of their lighter desserts. So good that I was stuffed and still ate all of it. Imagine kind of like a yogurt. Theres also some crumbs in it to give it texture.

4.0,3/29/2015,"The title perfectly captures a feeling of exclusivity (Why, it's a club!) and the activity that makes the menu possible- hunting and fishing, a  welcome reminder that what arrives on the plate must be captured, killed and expertly prepared in the case of H&FC. (I find such honesty refreshing in a world where Portlandia-esque detail about where and how a piece of meat was treated becomes self-parodying.)And on a Friday night this club was quite crowded, from the bar to almost every table in the dining area right down to the three private stalls that make up the men's bathroom.There comes a point in every dining experience when one peruses the menu, zooms in on the appropriate attraction and then is informed by the waiter of a special that shatters the plan, changes everything and makes you reconsider life, the universe and everything you are about to eat.In this case the words were ""côte de bœuf"", a cut of meat also known as a cowboy steak that is a thick bone-in rib steak. Joining other words with "" côte"" in them (like Cote d'Azure and Cotes du Rhone) , the côte de bœuf if prepared correctly can turn any hardened world weary carnivore into a drooling schoolkid who believes in the power of Santa Claus, the tooth fairy and democracy.Perhaps our waiter's claim that there were only three left was false and created a false sense of urgency making me act now. Whatever the motive, he did well by telling us about the côte de bœuf. Moments later a chef arrived presenting the raw piece of meat in all its fleshy wonder for us to inspect, to ensure that quality was met and expectations exceeded. It was all a bit theatrical, to be honest, one part Caligula Roman decadence and another part Food Network porn. (Now if all the cuts of beef were paraded out for us in their raw splendor, spin around and wait for the selection, that's getting to be way too much like a bordello of beef).30 minutes later and the côte de bœuf was presented in all its glory, oozing and sizzling and dripping and just about every other food porn verb one can conjure up on those lonely nights of dining on a frozen dinner instead of a proper cut of beef like now.And there was bone marrow, thick gelatinous bone marrow that I dipped the côte de bœuf into that only adds to the  debauched nature of this experience. Each bite melted like butter but as a red meat butter that does not publish calorie count and  does not care about playing second fiddle to what it's spread on. Yes, there were two sides ordered, a mac and cheese and creamed spinach that were just that: sides, extras, distractions from the main course. (And honestly, the mac and cheese shells while tasty weren't extraordinary).Prior to the arrival of the côte de bœuf we were given complimentary pop-overs and soft butter to while away the wait. Appetizers such as oysters are certainly available but I fear that anything that entered my belly would have taken up precious côte de bœuf real estate. The wait staff was certainly attentive and professional, arriving at just the right time to remove the feast and tease me with talk of dessert.For the non-red meat eater there at least five fish or chicken dishes on the menu, representing the fish side of the Club. Seeing as it was a Friday night, I do have to comment that the tables were relatively close together leading to a buzz of noise, making conversation not impossible but not easy either. Add a James Brown soundtrack and other 70's hits and you had an odd mix of various themes. None of which really matters after finishing off a côte de bœuf.",5,2,4,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",337,820,47

2.0,3/25/2015,"Was hoping for so much more considering the hype.Wanted to grab an early dinner at the bar - unfortunately it was during the polar vortex and the way their front door and bar is set up, every time the door was open and gust of frigid hair would sweep through the bar.Thankfully we found out the down stairs bar was opening, so the three of us moved down there.  Started out great.  Service was quick and friendly.  Ordered our meals, and then the issues started.First course was great, bone marrow was excellent.  Steaks were about average, nothing bad but nothing great.However half way through our entrees, they somehow realized (probably from the irate host that showed up and saw us 1/2 way through three steaks) that they had rented out the space for  a private party. So as we are trying to enjoy dinner they are rearranging the bar while the host and manager stare at us.Finally as we got closer to 8:00 they offered to reseat us in a private room upstairs.  Thanks, but 3/4 of the way through a meal, the last thing I want to do is have it taken from me, up two flights of stairs, and set back up.They were gracious enough to get us three seats at the bar and buy desserts that we really didn't want - drinks or another bottle of wine would have gone much further.Overall service at the bartender level was great, food was average, but how management misses a bought out space like that is beyond me.....",7,0,0,Brian S.,"New York, NY",148,21,0

4.0,3/9/2015,"Let's get the good stuff out of the way.The steaks here are exceptional. I've been to every premium steakhouse in NYC and this place is the best (for steak). Lugers (in my opinion) is king but that's in another category. I had the filet and it was perfectly cooked and the cut was a piece of art. Now let's talk about everything else:This place looks like it was designed by a Russian stripper. They are trying way too hard to be sophisticated. The service is also very inexperienced. They don't know the menu, didn't have an recommendations from the menu and just seemed like they were ""figuring it out"". I also shouldn't have to carry my own coat to the coat check located conveniently next to the kitchen.I was also shocked at how small and weak the bar was. They didn't have standard top shelf booze.Bottom line here is the steak is awesome, the service sucks and the clientele is trying a little too hard and are a little too ugly.",0,0,0,Julian P.,"Atlanta, GA",0,8,0

4.0,3/3/2015,"The Hunt & Fish Club had been described to me as as ""one of those restaurants where old men bring their hookers."" As an off-duty sex worker myself, you can only imagine how wet this got me. The onyx, marble, silver, and gold--all the colors of cash would be represented with a few well placed ivies--and celestial depictions of half-clothed maidens and matadors in the club's interior confirmed his description. Compound this with the fact that we were seated next to a middle-aged, dorky, bespectacled suit type and a young Asian woman in a stereotypical schoolgirl getup, and I was absolutely in heaven. This was going to be awesome, despite the fact that I'd already snagged my stocking somehow, and that the run was crawling slowly but surely past the hem of my dress.Dinner began with complimentary bread. The bread was delicious but really only worth mentioning because I stealthily stuffed a roll into my jacket pocket. A glutenous energy boost, just like a bar of soap swiped from the bathroom of a 5-star hotel, has the potential to come in handy when your plans include a full evening of debauchery replete with a heart-shaped box of goat cheese. The flavor and texture had even improved by later in the evening, when the soft, buttery insides had melted from my body heat.We ordered cocktails to start: the Adelina for him and a Night and Day for me. The Adelina was good but not particularly memorable besides the heavy rim of sugar that my companion took special pleasure in fellating. If you want to broadcast your best bedroom eyes while swirling your tongue around a flesh-colored beverage served in a flute-shaped vessel, this is the drink to order. My drink, the Night and Day, was disappointing. I was expecting some iteration of a Bloody Mary, but this concoction had the smokey taste of exhaust and vodka. A drink dubbed Night and Day should provide some contrast of flavors, like a swirling pool of man-made fluids, but the Bloody Mary served at Lace Gentlemen's Club was more exciting than this. Yes, Lace serves a Bloody Mary--one evidently made with more interesting fluids. But the olives were good and it got me pretty drunk, which the version at Lace failed to do.I ordered a second drink, the Taj & Tanya, hoping for better luck. Unfortunately, I had the same problem: where was the flavor? My partner suggested that I stir the drink, but shouldn't it have arrived ready for consumption? What if I showed up for a session still needing to be stirred? A mango flavored condom might have more exotic vibe than this.Thankfully, the food was on point from the dinner rolls to the hibiscus-infused Jell-O shots--just kidding, liqueurs--that were provided as a complimentary after-dinner drink. My prior experience with caviar had been limited to a sample-sized portion I tried once at Costco, and the serving that we shared was probably about the same size. The flavor, however, was large enough to satisfy my most extravagant caviar sploshing fantasies. The Filet Mignon was very good as well, but my tastes are not so refined: one tender piece of meat is about the same as the next to me. Meanwhile, the toro red Wild Boar Ragu inspired a bloodlust that resulted in me savoring my food rather than compulsively scarfing it down. There was actually physical matter--as opposed to my feelings--left on the plate when I laid my fork down, completely satisfied.We were both stuffed, but after having watched the extravagant-looking chocolate torte pass by several times, I subconsciously felt compelled to try it due to the glittering silver confections embedded in the chocolate frosting. Our waiter topped off our dessert with another Jell-O shot and sent us each off with a gold-colored box containing two chocolate truffles, which I dismantled later in an instinctive search for cash.tl;dr: got metal?",1,13,2,Margot R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0

The marbled floors and mirrored walls added a very Wolf of Wall Street vibe and really opened up the space. My dining companion and I had a res here on a Saturday night which definitely needed as the place was packed.  I was running late as I had a friend in town and was pleased to find that we had a comfy booth in the back.  A very dirty, very dry Ketel martini was waiting for me which made me a happy girl.  We then split some west coast oysters that were very good.  More drinks were ordered and then we settled on sharing the boneless rib eye medium rare, macaroni & cheese, and the mashed potatoes.  Everything was super yummy, although no one can touch Peter Lugers and Strip House when it comes to my favorite steak ever, but this steak was juicy and tender.  The mac&cheese and mashed potatoes were both super decadent.  We decided to forgo dessert as I had to get myself to Tippler and Rose Bar.",5,0,3,Sascha M.,"New York, NY",593,822,7
5.0,2/22/2015,"Wow...just wow... This place is incredible. Once you enter the decor sets the mood for a luxurious and scrumptious meal. The wait staff was great, the hostess took my gfs coat at the table to coat check and we were consistently followed up with to see if we needed anything. Even the bathroom was top notch, you know you're at a fancy place when the bathroom attendant hands you a cloth towel to dry your hands off!We started with the seafood platter. Oysters were fresh and plump, king crab, stone crab claws, shrimp and lobster were all crisp and delicious. Next we had the uni and snow crab which came out so beautifully plated it was difficult to eat. Next was the oxtail bone marrow french onion soup which is literally the best soup ive ever had hands down. For our main course we had steak for 2 cooked to perfection. I asked for something between rare and medium rare and the chef de cuisine nailed it. For sides the bacon brussel sprouts and the lemon zest asparagus was recommended. Normally I do not eat either of these veggies but figured I'd give them a shit since they were suggested and I'm glad I did! I'm not even sure what we had for desert but they were awesome too. At this point  I was deliriously full but the food was just so good I kept shoving it in my mouth.Highly recommend this place, especially for couples. The decor is impeccable, service exemplary and food... Well you read my last paragraph. Yes the bill may run you more than your typical meal, but worth every penny.

We made a reservation a couple weeks in advance from Valentine's Day. After making reservations all of a sudden all I saw on the blogs was this restaurant. We came a little early and when I gave him my name I was asked if we wanted to sit next to each other or across not knowing what he meant I said next to each other? We had the whole booth to our selves. I felt like a rock star!  It was so romantic we were in the corner with a whole booth. The ambience was amazing dim lighting, great music, marble everywhere, great art.  The wait staff was stellar. Just a fantastic evening.The food was just as great as the atmosphere we started withAppetizers:Crab cakes with Apple slaw and remoulade. This was a great starter. The crunchiness of the slaw went really well with the crab cake. There was big chunks of crab and the remoulade brought it all together.We also had Burrata with roasted peppers which also was very good. I was slightly disappointed how tiny the Burrata was for the price.EntreeWe ordered the porterhouse for two. We ordered it medium  but it was slightly under. The seasoning was spot on we also got the beurnaise which was delicious its a tarragon sauce. It complimented the steak perfectly.SidesTruffle tater totsThis is a must. It was fried to perfection. The sauce it come with is delicious.Brussel sprouts with bacon were perfectly executed. Nice and crunchy and you don't even know your eating vegetable! lolAnd lastly we ordered Mac and cheese which was also extremely good very gooey and creamy and the Macaroni was perfectly al dente. The sides are large and def good for sharing.  For dessert we went for the coconut angel food cake. It also had coconut sorbet and caramel sauce. It rounded out the meal. It was large enough to share and whimsy with the spun sugar. I had coffee to go with dessert.  They also gave us complimentary truffles and a home made fruity vodka .  All and all dinner was fabulous and I would def come back.

Theres a bar at the front when u first enter and another bar downstairs also.We started off with a cold seafood platter which consist of oysters, lobster, shrimp and snow crabs. All amazing. We tried the bone marrow which my bf enjoyed very much. It was served with bread so we used it as a spread. Very buttery and flavorful. We had the filet mignon and it was cooked nicely, warm and tender red center and the outside was crusty. We also tried the oyster rockafella (not sure of the spelling), which i only thought was ok becos i've had better. There was a pasta dish we had (i dont remember the name) but it was really good!!

3.0,2/19/2015,"My wife and I had 8:30 reservations on Valentines Day. To my surprise we were seated right away! For appetizers we had the Tuna Tartar and Oysters. Both were delicious.Here's where the problem starts. Problem 1.We ordered two glasses of wine. I ordered red, my wife ordered white. The waiter poured my glass, but never came back for my wife. We asked someone else, they said ok, but never came back. Finally the waiter came back and apologized. The waiter kept pressing us to order dinner. I know people in the restaurant industry say to order the main course with the appetizer. They say the staff knows how to spread it out......So we order in when he comes back with the missing wine.....As soon as we finish out appetizers, the main course was on our table...No table to enjoy the night. Problem 2.When I ordered the main course- Porter House for two, tater tots, mac and cheese. I also ordered a glass of club soda. That usually helps me digest the steak I'm about to eat easier. That never came until half was through the steak(still charged us). BTW, we sent back the mac and cheese because it tasted like macaroni salad that was microwaved.He took it from the table (still charged us) Got the spinach dip instead. The meal except for the mac and cheese was awesome. Problem 3.My wife wanted steak sauce for the steak. Since the waiter was M.I.A. from our table, we asked the person who brought us the steak. To no avail. We didn't see the waiter again until it was time for the desert. The food and decor from this place was great. The service (at least our waiter) was terrible.

There were plenty of seats at 5PM but can imagine it could get pretty packed as the evening progresses. Food was pretty good but there were a few missteps. For appetizers, we had the crab cake and the Caesar salad. I thought the crab cake was a good portion to start a meal and very light. My boyfriend thought the salad had too much Parmesan cheese shavings but he didn't find it too harsh, he just set them aside on his plate. For mains, we had the pork chop and the halibut. The chop was huge and thought it was prepared pretty good. There was a bit of over-charring but was expected for such a large cut. Boyfriend's halibut was prepared beautifully but he found a piece of bone, thankfully he noticed it before he ate it, but it was definitely a misstep. He set it aside, no harm no foul. Desserts, we shared the crème brûlée and thought it was prepared nicely and satisfying. At the end of the meal, since it was Valentine's Day, were provided complimentary hibiscus infused vodka.

The food was great, and had the burrata + tuna tartare to start.  Our entrees were the salmon, branzzino, and kosher cut steak.  I have to admit my steak was slightly overcooked in areas, but not enough to send it back.  I would have to chalk it up to the place being new perhaps.  Also seemed like they had limited cuts of meat but maybe it was the lunch menu and simply limited at that time.All and all, I liked it enough to return and hope to upgrade the rating to 5 stars.

5.0,1/26/2015,"WOW.  Arrived early evening, just after seeing a show.  The decor is quite impressive and decadent.  Every detail was thoroughly thought through.  Had a cocktail in the bar pre-dinner.  Excellent Gimlets.  The bartender is on top of his craft-takes time with every drink to make sure it is perfect.  The hostess gave us a tour of the restaurant and the Green Room and the Private Dining downstairs.  As she was giving us the tour, I thought that I had to plan an event just to have it in the Green Room.We were then seated in the main dining room.  The service was impeccable.  The server is very knowledgeable and you can tell that he takes pride in where he works and what he does.  Very important.  He knows the menu backwards and forwards. We started with the bone marrow with toast points.  WOW.  Superbly prepared.  I didn't think I needed to eat anything else after that-how could this restaurant top that?I had the Grilled Branzino.  Perfection.  for sides, we ordered the Grilled Asparagus and the Crispy Brussels Sprouts.  The Crispy Brussels Sprouts was the favorite-even if you do not like vegetables, you will love these!Wait for it...dessert is legen-dary.  I am not a big fan of sweets and very rarely eat dessert.  The server recommended two-a pineapple cheesecake and the coconut cake.  Divine.  The coconut cake was light and airy and delicious.  It was served with coconut sorbet that was incredible.  And the spun sugar on top was a work of art.  I cannot say enough about my experience at Hunt and Fish Club.  If you enjoy food that is divine and service that is absolutely impeccable and personable, this is your place.",0,0,0,Annie D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,53,0

She told us all about this restaurant and its investors and explained the stories behind each mural they had in the restaurant. Thank you Rena for the great hospitality.The ambience was exceptional. Fancy! they have a lounge and we have yet to explore the rest of this place. I love their bloody Mary's and since we came for lunch (today was their first day for lunch) and tried their crab cake which I enjoyed! definitely coming back for date night or even stop for a drink. this place is great.me and my boyfriend are both in the industry and we both understand how important customer service is and we feel that this place exceeds (shoutout to Rena) our expectations. much love from California!! thanks Rena! we will be back!,4,0,0,Theresa A.,"San Diego, CA",193,49,11
4.0,1/12/2015,"Hunt & FIsh Club is the new hot spot in Midtown--and deservingly so. Head-to-Toe marble and an enchanting display of decanters remind you that you're in a place of importance. Should you find yourself not following a budget, then you should find your way here. All of our dishes were lovely in presentation, if not beyond delicious. Try the roasted bone marrow and indulge in the $260 caviar dish if you wish to taste true decadence. If you don't want to come off too much like a throned bourgeois lord, the Tuna Tartare is delicious and served with crisp, lotus root chips which is a clever complement to the tired dish of tartare. The Oysters were standard--I applaud them for the freshness and cleanliness, though I would expect nothing less from Hunt & Fish Club. For your main dish, there really is no way you can go wrong when it comes to the Marbled Rib-Eye bone-in steak. Perfectly cooked medium rare, with a lovely, salty sear coat. If you're not a big fan of giant cuts of meat, the Cavatelli Wild Boar Ragu is a wonderful dish that was arguably one of the best plates of the table, with widespread appeal. The lobster was decent and steamed well, however it was a tad over-salted. If you choose to pursue dessert, the Chocolate Flourless cake was the overwhelming favorite of the table! Do yourself a favor; indulge in this dessert and taste the complexities of flavors--chocolate, banana, and a hint of peanut butter. Order the Coconut Angel cake if you're not a fan of chocolate. Also yes, it IS that hairy-looking dessert that you keep seeing coming out of the kitchen.  Being a huge fan of Panna Cotta, I was slightly disappointed by their Yogurt Panna Cotta---the tartness overpowered the fresh flavors of the fruit.Hunt & Fish Club is an experience and decadent meal--perfect for those who are thirsty for a new, hot scene in New York City. An experience truly fit for the expression ""A meal fit for a King.""",11,2,8,Josephine Z.,"Queens, NY",787,445,182
4.0,1/5/2015,"Spontaneous adventures in NYC are simply the best. Our dinner tonight at Hunt & Fish Club was certainly one of those. My partner in crime and I came here on a whim to check out the official opening of this new restaurant. Part of us didn't want to go too far because of the freezing cold and the other part had been encouraged by a notice from Urban Daddy. We walked in just to grab a drink at the bar but upon noticing already how lovely the interior was, we decided to inquire for a table. We figured why not give this place a chance! From beginning to end we received nothing but attentive service from everyone who worked there. Even the owner (whose name I believe was Lester!) greeted us and told us because we were his very first diners on their first official day, our dessert would be free. Way to make me fall in love with you already... I took a break from alcohol this evening but I could not help but take a gander at their cocktail list. They had a great array of libations to suit every palate. Around the beautiful dining room with its lit up ceiling and marbled floors the waiters were bustling around attending to every guest as if they had no other. Without even a word a gentleman walked over to our table and saw it was a tad wobbly and fixed it before we could even make a comment. Never before have I seen such efficiency on an opening night. Not once did I get an air of pretentiousness or attitude which one might expect from a restaurant with such a name and such interior design. It was absolutely wonderful.Now that I've gushed about the service, let me get to food. I always believe restaurants can strive to better themselves after their openings and I see the potential in H&F's dishes. To start, my PIC and I shared the Baked Littleneck Clams, the Uni, Crab & Ponzu appetizer and the Oxtail & Bone Marrow French Onion Soup. I consider myself to be a baked clam connoisseur and these were delicious! There was an unknown undertone of flavor to the dish that I absolutely loved. I did not love the Uni appetizer (porrrrrr queeeeeee!!!) as it seemed a little too jumbled together in terms of taste and presentation. I can see this working if it was restructured and maybe another element added in. The soup was absolutely out of this world. On nights like tonight where you just want to stick your entire body in an oven to escape the cold, this soup was the perfect remedy. The broth was thick and hearty with chunks of oxtail meat and you could taste the sweet richness of the bone marrow in every drop. This soup is to die for. I would come back just for this dish alone. Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommended.For our mains, she ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon (Bubble & Squeak, Horseradish Créme Fraîche) and I was craving pasta (typical) so I went with the Cavatelli Wild Boar Ragù with Local Smoked Ricotta. After that toe-curling-inducing soup the pasta was a tad underwhelming... but as mentioned earlier I can see the potential in the dish. It needs something to give it more depth in flavor and I think it also needed some more cavatelli. Once I had eaten all of the pasta I still had ample chunks of boar left in my dish (which I of course took home and will find something useful to do with it later). I stole a bite of the salmon which was cooked perfectly medium rare with a dab of the horseradish créme fraîche. So yummy.For dessert it was hard for me to choose. At one point I had chosen the Chocolate Torte at the waiter's recommendation but then I saw the Sundae station out of the corner of my eye... my inner child squealed. They wheeled over two carts- one has a bunch of toppings and the other with my ice cream bowl ready to be doused in goodies! I wish I had asked for a scoop of chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla since I thought my sundae came with both choc and vanilla but it's all good. For toppings you can choose from: fresh berries, chocolate pearls, rice krispies, chocolate walnuts and hot fudge. GET ALL THE TOPPINGS!Oh and to make this meal even more interesting, we were interviewed by a reporter for the NY Post on what we thought about the restaurant and had our photo taken. That's a first for me... but I quite enjoyed it. We were also given a tour of the private rooms and were sold on using this venue in the future. It's such a beautiful restaurant and their attention to detail plus dedication makes us completely confident that they will wow anyone we send there.We also had some fun people sightings such as Charlie Gasparino and Darryl Strawberry. Definitely looking forward to more adventures in the New Year!",34,21,25,Leslie D.,"New York, NY",1565,656,1217
