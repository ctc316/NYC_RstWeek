1.0,11/24/2018,"Wow. I can't believe how horribleThis place is. With all the pomp and circumstance around DB's name. The place was horrible. I should have known when I walked into an empty restaurant that it would be bad. I was in the area and thought I would stop in with a friend and we both had bad dishes and starters. Find a better alternative, there are many!!!",0,0,0,James S.,"Maplewood, NJ",1,20,3
5.0,11/11/2018,Arrived here for lunch around 2:30pm.  It was empty so we thought the place was closed but it wasn't.  And I can said I'm glad it wasn't the food was so on point. We all enjoyed our meals and were able to have a great conversation without having to yell or anything.  Highly recommend this place for lunch.  Haven't been for dinner yet but will soon and I will report back to you.,1,0,0,Madd M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",2,19,10

2.0,10/18/2018,"I had breakfast here twice. I wish I never had. Omelette, bagel, pancakes were fine the first day - nothing out of the ordinary. We only came back because we had to catch an early train the last day. There were only one other guest in the entire restaurant. Yet, it took forever for the food and coffee to arrive. When it finally arrived, we were served cold poached eggs with runny whites, cold hash browns and cold cappuccinos. The manager took them off the bill without being asked which was nice.",0,1,0,Lise P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,0
2.0,10/1/2018,"Went there for lunch. The entire restaurant has only about 6-7 tables seated but service was sooo slowwww and poor. Took about 20 minutes to get the orders in, appetizers we're about about 25 minutes and drinks didn't come out until after the apps. Another 25 minutes for entree. Now we were in a rush to we had to ask for the dessert (included in the meal) and check at the same time. The restaurant really dropped a lot from its hay day.",0,0,0,Joe D.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",1,40,1
4.0,9/17/2018,"Service was great, the selection was subpar on a Saturday afternoon. I ordered a frozen drink which ended up making me nauseous. Probably because it was too sweet. I had the brioche french toast, which was good but the middle was extremely soggy. That's the main reason I don't order french toast but if I do it has to be a bread thick enough to withstand the heavy milk and eggs. The setup is nice and my friend's food was actually really good. She had some type of egg bake with potatoes and mushrooms. I'd definitely go back for dinner.",0,0,0,Amira A.,"Brooklyn, NY",397,761,449
5.0,8/26/2018,We came here for the restaurant week event. Compared to our experience in other restaurant week restaurants I think David Burke kitchen is really generous about the food! They don't give you a smaller portion or simpler menu. Everything you can order! (Except for some that you have to add some extra money) I really liked the tuna tartare with their homemade chips. That's a combination I've never tried before. The entrees are both SO GOOD. The scallop is very fresh and the lamb ribs are so tender! (I think it's medium rare but it doesn't smell at all!!) and for dessert we did a cheese cake lollipop tree. We thought it'll be another fancy dessert just looking good but taste not. But it actually was really tasty! I'd love to come back again for this dinning experience.,0,0,0,Johnny Yueh Han L.,"Manhattan, NY",146,49,263
4.0,8/22/2018,"Came in on a Sunday night for dinner and was literally the only table in the place. Shared the smoked duck breast and the clams and mussels apps. Really liked the later. The duck was more like a salad with duck on it - good but not what I expected. I had scallops for my main. Good dinner portion and good sides with it. Had the chocolate malt cake for dessert. It was sort of dry, the best part was the caramel popcorn on top.",0,0,0,Jen B.,"New York, NY",220,23,14

5.0,8/13/2018,"Such a great experience! I'll admit,reading the past reviews made me a little skeptical of the place but the staff, food and atmosphere completely blew my mind. Maybe I had such a great experience because it was Sunday night and I arrived an hour before the kitchen closed, but the staff didn't rush my boyfriend and I at all. The whole staff was so accommodating, for example: it was drizzling when we got there and all the tables outside with covers were taken, the hostess offered to set up an umbrella for us and the bussers rushed to get us the table set. My boyfriend and I had the crispy zucchini and the duck breast salad to start and, OMG I highly recommend the salad. The duck breast was so tender and the balsamic glaze is to die for. We paired our dinner with their shiraz rosè, it was light and refreshing with a few tannins to it. Definitely ask for the wine to be extra cold for the perfect sip! For our entree, we had the pan seared scallops, the rack of lamb, a side of asparagus and french fries( because you can never go wrong with french fries), the scallops were a bit fishy but the sauce it's served in balanced the dish. The rack of lamb was AMAZING, so juicy and flavorful. My only complaint is that the asparagus had too much garlic( literally more than 2 teaspoons full of chopped garlic on that dish) but the view and the rest of the meal was so good,it didn't really bother me. The cheesecake tree is a MUST!",1,0,0,Yamii N.,"Queens, NY",191,11,5
5.0,8/12/2018,We came here for brunch during the restaurant week. This is one of the few places that allows you to choose an appetizer and an entree from their menu for the restaurant week. The hostess was kind and promptly showed us to our table. We opted to sit on the terrace as the day was really nice. The place itself was very nice and cozy. We got two brunch cocktails which was only okay when compared to the food. We got the smoked salmon and the coconut yogurt as appetizers. They were both very delicious. We had the French toast and the goat cheese omelette as our entree. The French toast was excellent. The goat cheese omelette was well done which can along with a salad and maple bacon which was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good food and ambience.,0,0,1,Anusha T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",55,64,53

There is also a garden area if you'd like to eat onside on a rooftop.For appetizers, we ordered the Clams and Mussels and the Duck Breast. Both were good but the C&M was a bit too salty. For entrees, we ordered the chicken and branzino. The branzino was well cooked and tasty but a bit fishy - could use a bit more cooking wine.

3.0,8/10/2018,"So I get that it was restaurant week and busy is not an uncommon thing. But.... I went with my friend and we each got an appetizer, the mussels and clams and duck salad. The duck salad was popping. Ok now the mussels and clams was salty salty. Like why are you so salty? Not only that the clams and mussels were so tiny and small, I didn't felt like I had any. I got the ribeye and she got the branzino. The branzino came with a side of spinach which was salty. The rib eye was great. I got it medium rare and it was hu-mung-go. We then got the cheesecake lollipop dessert which was good. Had many different cheesecake lollipops to try. Ok now the service was...horrible. It was not busy to the point where they could not filled up our cup of water. But, for some reason, everyone's water got filled besides us. I wonder why. I don't want to feel some type of way but I did. We didn't get more water until we asked twice. Overall, it was a good experience but not the service.",0,1,0,Linda L.,"New York, NY",4,11,0

4.0,8/1/2018,"Despite working in the area, I have yet to have a meal at David Burke Kitchen. A coworker and I always do Restaurant Week and we were looking for options in the area. This year, they changed the lunch option to $26 for a two-course meal - you get an entrée and your choice between an appetizer or a dessert. DBK was offering a dessert add-on for $5, so that sealed the deal.We arrived on time for our reservation and realized that the main dining room was closed. No worries, because sitting outside on the patio was nicer, in my opinion.They're offering their regular menu as their RW menu - you just pick what you want. The scallops did have a +$7 supplement. We both opted for the Smoked Duck Breast Salad with figs, balsamic honey, and blue cheese. It was really tasty and a solid portion size for an appetizer. We then split the Roasted Branzino and the Burger. The branzino was the highlight - it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The burger was good and very filling.We opted to split the Chocolate Malt Cake for dessert and it was a good idea. It's a big portion of cake and we would've never finished it if we each ordered a dessert. The cake was moist and soft - a perfect slice of chocolate cake!Service was so-so. Our waitress kind of disappeared after dropping off our entrees and we had a hard time flagging her down to order dessert and get the check. I think this was literally the only flaw to our lunch.",1,0,0,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",367,1165,1125

1.0,7/28/2018,"FOOD POISONING ALERT! I've been to a few David Burke restaurants in the past. In fact I even met David Burke at his Fishtail Restaurant & he was super nice guy even gave me an autographed copy of his cookbook. Needless to say I've been a huge David Burke fan for years. However last night was a different story. I was going to order tuna tartare but the waiter recommended the Clams & Mussels. Big mistake!!! The dish was not remarkable at all & some of my clams did not open. I told the waiter & he told me to take a knife to pry the closed clams open! Well I went home & came down with a severe bout of food poisoning from the clams. I am still trying to recover & I have to attend a big event tonight. I still cannot eat anything. Next up the sea scallops. I love scallops & let me tell you I have NEVER eaten so much sand in my scallops ever. Every bite was just sand. They obviously did not soak their scallops in saltwater to remove the sand. It was really horrible. Next up the goat milk panna cotta. I asked the waiter to omit the balsamic syrup, as I wanted it plain with just the strawberries... well it came with the syrup. This was the worst experience I've ever had dining at a David Burke restaurant & to say the least I am shocked & appalled. I love David Burke & I don't know what happened here but to have an issue with all 3 courses & now food poisoning from clams? Eating gritty sandy scallops? This was not a good experience at all. I will not be coming back ever again. Mediocre food & food poisoning wrapped up in one. I really hope they do something about this. Farm to table should not result in clams that don't open & food poisoning. Please get rid of that sand in your scallops. I really wanted to like this restaurant. I am sad that I even have to write this bad review because I am such a David Burke fan, but now I just have a bad taste in my mouth.",0,0,0,Lil W.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,24,115
2.0,7/28/2018,"Went for restaurant week and picked this place because they allow you to get anything on their menu for restaurant week. Good service minus my waiter seemed to be on too many tables and disappeared for long periods of time. The food is mediocre, as is the decor for inside seating. Considering I paid $55 for the aged prime ribeye, I was not impressed by the quality of the meat, nor the flavor. We bought all the upgrades +$ on the menu and the best thing was the tuna tartare. The mussels and clams were too oily. I guess I like butter, but don't believe it makes all food better. My best dish was the chocolate cake, not too sweet and super moist. Overall, I just expected way more.",1,1,0,Kit L.,"New York, NY",0,18,13
4.0,7/27/2018,"Went here today for lunch for NYC Restaurant Week of Summer 2018. Two courses for $26 each. Had the smoked duck with figs as well as mussels and clams to start. The duck was smoked within an inch of its life tasting more like jerky than delicate duck. The mussels had a very strong lemon flavor to the broth, and we had to ask for a side of bread as the crotons in the bowl were already soggy as mush. The mains of ricotta cavatelli and a beautiful burger with fries were generous portions but nothing amazing. All in all the service was great, wine really delicious but the food nothing much to write home about. Might return might not.",0,0,0,Alex A.,"Brooklyn, NY",420,193,68

3.0,7/12/2018,"Was walking around SoHo and decided to come here, because we were looking for brunch in the area. Everything here was just kind of meh. The ambiance was nice, we sat on the comfortable rooftop to eat, but I thought that the prices were a little expensive for what the food was.I ordered the baked eggs, which came with gruyere cheese and veggies. The quality of the food tasted just fine and great, but the flavors were very bleh. The dish just tasted really bland and plain and just wasn't worth the price to me. Guess if you're looking for classy, nice vibes, this is a great place for brunch. But don't come expecting great food.

4.0,7/5/2018,"My friend and I came here to the garden area for drinks on a Friday afternoon. We came around 3:30PM and there were not many people at the bar or eating. We sat at a table near the bar and got service immediately. They have a really interesting looking cocktail menu but on this particularly hot Friday (which was the start of the heat wave in NYC), a nice crisp glass of rose is what we both went with. As the afternoon went on, more and more people came into the bar. We left around 5PM and the place was pretty full. We were still given great service the entire time. Even though the place was packed, the server came to us to check in frequently and we had no trouble getting a second glass of wine when we wanted one. We didn't even have to flag her down, she knew we were ready and came right over. This was a really nice atmosphere. There were lots of trees around to shade us and I liked the vibe. Not sure what it would be like when it's more busy. The prices are pretty steep but we expected that for this place. We had a good time!",2,0,0,Joanna V.,"Brooklyn, NY",153,1361,1267
2.0,6/30/2018,"This is an overpriced steakhouse because it has lackluster dishes not worth the price tag. The restaurant is situated in Tribeca, an area known for upscale dining options. If you come here for dinner during the summer, seating is on a nice outdoor patio with a beautiful view of NYC. Very summery vibes! It's a beautiful view, especially if you get a chance to catch the sunset. Regarding service, waiters were very attentive and accommodating to our party. They constantly refilled our water glasses as it was an extremely hot day. Sitting outside was not ideal due to the weather and a lack of AC. Besides aesthetics and service, the restaurant has terrible food. My friend and I shared the chicken wings for $15, it was probably the best thing I ate here. At a steakhouse. They were solid wings but not $15 wings. The entrees were minimum 20ish dollars. There was a generally consensus among the table that the dishes lacked flavor and good portion sizes. The lamb ""lasagna"" I had was pretty much ground lamb, cheese, and zucchini in place of pasta. It was bland and once again too expensive for what it was. The food is not worth the price as the dishes are not flavorful or adventurous enough. There are much better options in TriBeCa. If you're actually hungry for a meal, look elsewhere. 2/5, not coming back.",1,0,0,Shan R.,"Boston, MA",167,48,87

Ordered the prix fix lunch which included a salad burger and dessert. All good but nothing amazing. My main issue is the service. Only two other tables were filled in the entire restaurant and it took nearly two hours to get our burgers until we called out the waiter.

3.0,2/28/2018,"David Burke Kitchen has been on my list of NYC restaurants to go to for a long time - and what better time than Restaurant Week? David Burke is tucked away in the SoHo neighborhood with so many other great restaurants around. We got a reservation for 2 at 7 PM and it was packed. It boggles my mind the amount of people who come to these popular restaurants without a reservation - rule #1 of eating in New York: always make a reservation. As for the food, here's what I got:Appetizers: Lamb Meatballs, BurrataEntree: Both got Squid Ink CavatelliDessert: Cheesecake Lollipop Tree (for 1, which was plenty), Meyer Lemon Pound Cake$45/person, about $50 after tax and tip.The lamb meatballs and burrata were so delicious! The lamb meatballs were a little drier than I preferred but the burrata was silky smooth and went great with the pear (to my surprise). The Squid Ink Cavatelli was a little discomforting - tasted great, but my friend couldn't help but point out that the pasta shape looked like little larvae. If that doesn't curb your appetite, I don't know what will. Pro tip is to definitely order the cheesecake lollipop tree for 1. I love cheesecake and wanted to order for 2 but I'm glad we didn't because each tree came with 8 or so lollipops. After 1 or 2, we were all Cheesecaked out and even ended up taking some home. We finished the rest of our meal though and were really stuffed. David Burke serves New American food which was great, but not super impressive. Don't get me wrong, it was a great meal - but definitely a little underwhelmed compared to the standards I had in my head based off of how much I'd heard about David Burke prior to my visit. Service was on point though - they were swift, didn't bother you unless you really needed it, and seating was super cramped.

3.0,2/8/2018,"We came here for NYC Restaurant Week Winter 2018 and while our experience started off on a high note, it slowly worsened throughout the afternoon. And we had such high expectations too!We had a reservation for two and were able to seated right away. Our server was friendly and prompt in giving us our menus and making sure any questions we had about the menu were answered. What I LOVED was that for the restaurant week menu, you can basically choose anything on the menu for your appetizer, main, and dessert. And there were so many options! For appetizers and main courses there were at least six options each, so people of all dietary restrictions can find an option that is right for them. For desserts, they were offering the option of a cheesecake pop tree for two. It looked AMAZING, and as we saw so many of these trees come out, we knew we had to get it for ourselves as well.However, we received our first bit of bad news from our server that they were all sold out of the cheesecake pop tree. Our server told us that they get the cake pops from a different bakery, and therefore they are not made in house - so once they're gone, they can't make anymore. He then told us that the day before we came, they sold 400 of these cake pop trees and on the day we came they had already sold 300. Ok, so these cake pop trees were REALLY popular, which makes sense why they would sell out. What I can't understand though is that if they could see there was such a high demand for these cake pop trees, why couldn't they order more for subsequent days to ensure that they will have enough to get through lunch service?Anyways, we dishearteningly decided to choose different options for our dessert. For my appetizer, I ordered the Pastrami Smoked Salmon; for main course, I ordered the Sagamore Rye & Maple-Roasted Pear Skillet Cake, and for dessert I ordered the Meyer Lemon Pound Cake.The Pastrami Smoked Salmon came out right away, and I enjoyed this dish a lot. I was thrown off by the size of the pancakes that came with the salmon, however. They were REALLY tiny, and the dish only came with four of them compared to a large portion of the smoked salmon, and I definitely ran out of pancake before I ran out of salmon to put on top of it. I think they should fix this proportion issue for the future. The salmon itself was wonderfully smoked and not too salty and the cream cheese that came with the dish was light.The Sagamore Rye & Maple-Roasted Pear Skillet Cake came right away after the appetizer, and this was the most impressive dish of the afternoon for me. It was a sizable cake that was moist and sweet because of the caramelized pears but there was creme fraiche on top of the cake which helped to balance out the sweetness. Such a stunning dish, and I would hands down go back for more of that skillet cake!After my empty main course dish was taken away was when the afternoon started to go downhill. We noticed that everyone in the restaurant, including us, were waiting on dessert, so if I had to guess, it seemed to me that the restaurant had run out of dessert and was in the process of procuring more. This meant that we were waiting 30 minutes for dessert, which is more time than it took for us to eat our first two courses combined. Seemingly at the same time, our server left halfway through service without letting us know and no one was assigned to replace him so we were neglected as everyone else was getting their dessert and none of the servers even looked our way.At one point, a server even brought us our check BEFORE we got our dessert (he didn't know we hadn't gotten dessert yet), and the look on my face told him that that was a bad move. He promptly apologized and brought us what we had ordered after we waited for so long. I was hoping that the dessert would be the saving grace after the mini fiasco of having to wait so long and be neglected by the restaurant staff (because dessert cures all!), so imagine my extreme disappointment at biting into a stale, overly sweet pound cake that had frozen meringues on it and had equally sweet berry sauce on it. It was so cloyingly sweet that I could not take more than a few bites, and I actually left the rest. As a major dessert lover, me leaving a dessert behind is practically unheard of. I was hoping for so much more from David Burke Kitchen especially in regards to dessert because I'd heard so many good things about their dessert. If it weren't for that Pear Skillet Cake, I would have given this review two stars. I'm not sure that I'll come back to David Burke Kitchen anytime soon.",2,0,0,Pooja M.,"Fremont, CA",543,264,1109
3.0,2/7/2018,"Restaurant week #4. Service, ambiance and company were incomparable. That being said... caviar and tots leaves much to be desired. Adorable in presentation and taters are food to my soul but they could've been crispier and while the sour cream was decadent and a great accompaniment, this dish needed a good kick of sea salt and squeeze of citrus. The caviar? We could've done without Bc we couldn't taste mediocre caviar with something as strong as sour cream. Cool concept that was Not well thought out. We paid for it. The burrata and octopus apps were standout in flavor, plating and portion size. The beets were sweet while the oyster app was pretty lackluster. The miso black cod was too sweet and salty, cut only by the freshness of flash blanched yuchoy- but to be very honest, my mom could have done better on both ends. But black cod is indeed black cod and it would be a miracle to F that up. The other entree, squid black cavatelli were a bit overdone. While flavor were present and subtle the entire dish needed, again, a hit of salt and citrus. That seems to be a running theme at DBK.Now the dessert. I am so sorry to have to say that I did not ""save the best for last"" to end this on an anticlimactic- anti-cliffhanger- antithesis to what one would expect. It was an absolute disaster course.

4.0,2/4/2018,"Had a reservation here for Restaurant Week and overall had a positive experience. I enjoyed the appetizers and desserts more than the entrees here. For the three course dinner I had the below:Lamb Meatballs: Was my favorite dish that I had here and would definitely recommend. If I returned, I would actually pay full price for these and I usually don't like to repeat dishes. The waiter said this was his favorite appetizer and they really did not disappoint. It was dish was a lot of different flavor layers. I normally don't like lamb that much, but the lamb flavor wasn't overly prominent. The meatballs weren't too dry and complimented the sauce well. Friend also really liked this dish too.Squid Ink Cavatelli / Lobster Ravioli: I thought these dishes were good, but if it wasn't Restaurant Week, I wouldn't want to pay the full price for them. I had the squid ink cavatelli and while there was nothing bad about this dish, but there also wasn't anything too unique about it. I tried my friend's lobster ravioli and felt the same. They are both pretty big portion sizes though so prepare to feel stuffed after..Dark Chocolate Coconut Tart / Lemon Pound Cake: I ordered the dark chocolate coconut tart which I really loved. If you're not a fan of almond joys or coconut, I would probably stay away since you can definitely taste the nuttiness, but I really love coconut so enjoyed the dessert. I tried the lemon pound cake my friend ordered and think this is more of a crowd pleaser that most people will like. Both desserts had really nice presentationsOverall, would recommend this place for Restaurant Week. Their appetizers and desserts were a nice treat and were quite unique. The restaurant also has a really nice ambiance. I would make a reservation though, since it was pretty crowded/had a long line when we got there, but luckily had a reservation so were seated immediately.",0,1,0,Sarah X.,"New York, NY",53,118,324

We stood around and chatted - it wasn't so bad. But, at 9:45, we were getting a little restless and our table wasn't even ready at that point. We got seated at 9:55. The restaurant week menu was a little limited, with many options having a 5-10 dollar supplement fee, and only 4 or so options actually being within the price fixe.

4.0,1/27/2018,"Decided to go here last night for Restaurant Week. We've been wanting to try it out, and their pre-fixe menu looked amazing, so it seemed like a great opportunity. Our reservation was at 9:00 (according to our confirmation), but we were told it wasn't until 9:30 when we arrived. No big deal, they were pretty busy so we didn't mind having to wait until the time they had in their system.We were seated just after 9:30 and ordered right away. Our drink order took about 15 minutes, which seemed kind of lengthy, but again, they were busy so we weren't too bothered. However, our appetizers took about 50 minutes before they came out. Once we finished and they cleared the table, another 30 minutes went by and we still didn't have entrees even though the restaurant had pretty much cleared out at this point. We finally asked what was taking so long and were told they had just asked the kitchen the same thing. Our entrees finally came 45 minutes after our appetizers had been cleared. My food was just barely warm, and my boyfriend's was cold. Our friend's pasta was hot, though. We had almost forgotten about dessert since we had been there so long, but that only took about 10 minutes. The waiter also gave us complimentary glasses of champagne as consolation for how long we had to wait. Overall, the food was delicious. I had to knock off a star for the ridiculous wait for each course though and for the cold entrees. I would definitely go back and give it another try, just not sure if it would be worth the usual full price.",1,0,0,Skylar T.,"New York, NY",249,14,3
4.0,1/26/2018,"Restaurant Week 2018! Winter Edition  So glad I finally got to try DBK. My husband works nearby and eats here at least 1x a week (they have an awesome 3-course prix fixe lunch for $29), so I was glad to finally be able to try it for myself for dinner during RW, with a 3-course pF for $42. Loved every bite of food I put in my mouth here. The portions were generous, which I wasn't expecting. I left full and happy. - The burrata: silky smooth and came atop a gorgeously dressed salad with arugula and a crostini. (Could have used a pinch of salt on the burrata, but that's just me. #saltbae)- Roasted chicken breast, mashed potatoes: Let me just preface this by saying I NEVER order the chicken dish when dining out. I make it so regularly at home that I always get something I don't make at home when I go out. But it was either between this or the salmon (which I also make at home on a regular basis) so I went with this. And, my god. The breast was such a good size, skin-on, bone-in, thick, not dry, and with the most amazingly crispy and flavorful skin I've ever tasted. Brava! Great helping of mashed potatoes too. So creamy and flavorful. I polished off the entire dish. Surprised I didn't eat the bone. - Cheesecake lollipop tree for two: loved this! So cute. And loved getting different flavors. Was just the right way to finish the meal. I couldn't stop eating them! Each flavor better than the last. + $13 for a glass of MalbecIt came to about $73/pp, with RW, 1 glass of wine, tax+tip. Without restaurant week, it would have cost about $100/pp to order all the same dishes, so it was a nice discount. Service wasn't my cup of tea. Waiters seemed indifferent and a bit impatient. But I guess that's just soho for you. Decor was great, though. Loved the mixture of wood and light fixtures. Very ""now,"" but not in an obnoxious way. All told, would I eat here at regular price? Probably not. But I would definitely come back for the $29 lunch special. Or another restaurant week!",1,0,2,Sarah G.,"New York, NY",178,350,239
3.0,1/26/2018,"Let me start off by saying how I despise going out for restaurant week. In theory, its a great idea. Give people who normally can't afford or wouldn't spend the money on expensive restaurants an opportunity to eat at a reasonable price. What you get is usually reduced portions, sub-par food, and a disgruntled staff due to that fact they'll be receiving less money for their services. I'm sure David Burke Kitchen is usually a fantastic experience, the food was very good, nice, clean atmosphere, drinks were great. Bartender was very friendly and attentive. My party's waiter on the other hand is an example of the disgruntled staff I felt. He didn't really seem like he cared much to be there, when asked for a recommendation, he basically just looked at the menu and mentioned the first thing he saw, and my kicker was at the end. Got the bill, put the group's cards in. Then he comes back shortly with a new bill because he forgot to charge for a glass of wine. Takes another 15-20 min to come back, and during this time we realize he charged a surplus for items that weren't supposed to have a surplus charge, thus making the bill a $3 difference from the first one. And at this point, we've been there an additional 30 minutes over $3. Again, quality of the food was very good, I had the oysters, duck, a side of brussel sprouts and the monkey bread for dessert, and my girlfriend had the burrata, chicken breast, reggiano fries, and the chocolate tart for dessert. No complaints, and we left satisfied and full, I'm not going to give this place a 1-star review because of 1 detail like some reviewers. I just feel that the service was sub-par considering the name, hopefully its due to Restaurant Week and nothing more.",0,0,0,Mitch G.,"Suffern, NY",283,91,4

We were excited about dining here for restaurant week as the full menu is available to choose from (as opposed to most restaurants have only 2-3 choices for its pre-fixed. We had a great time and enjoyed the dining experience, but overall thought the food itself was average at best (but nice presentation and table settings). Had the lamb meatballs for the appetizer, pork belly for the main course (a bit too heavy), and bread pudding - supplemental charge, but it was too sweet after a couple of bites. The meal didn't blow me away, but it was decent and I enjoyed dining with my friend. The menu changes seasonally, so I would come back to try some of their other dishes.

I decided today to try something different. And I was rewarded. First, their lunch Prix fixe deal is great - app, entree, and dessert for $29. Some things have an additional supplement but otherwise their whole menu is game. The beet salad was incredible. The various vegetables were cut into small dice. The dressing was light (nice!) and fresh tasting. I thought the goat cheese was skimpy but it turned out to be just the right amount. For entree, I got the salmon. It came with a side of artichokes and another vegetable that was sliced thin and crispy. The salmon was cooked firm but not tough. The waiter suggested medium but it felt a little more done than medium. Still it was very delicious. And for dessert, the peanut butter chocolate thing was decadent and rich but not overly sweet. The mini scoop of ice cream provided a sweet punch and helped wash down the thick peanut butter/chocolate concoction. Service was fine but as usual, a bit slow. Probably more a reflection of the care put into food prep.

I was looking forward to being seated out in the garden but unfortunately it was booked for a wedding reception so we were seated in the basement. The server came to get our order and when she heard that we would just be drinking water she immediately became disinterested at our order. Having come for the pancake, I ordered that. I also heard that the dry aged steak was something that was not to be missed so I also ordered the dry aged steak (medium rare) with sunny side eggs. While waiting, there was a couple next to us with an order of fries which looked good, so we flagged down the server and asked for fries. Out comes our order, the pancake looked good but my steak looked overcooked and it was. It was medium-well, but we were starving at this point and just decided to eat it. The meat was extremely fatty. So incredibly disappointing for the steak to be sub par at a steak restaurant. The sunny side egg was more like over medium-hard. The pancake was delicious. Not like your traditional pancake where it has stacks of thin cakes but it was more like a skillet cake, slightly dense, thick and fluffy. The fries we ordered was good but cost us $10. $10 for a small bowl of plain fries. I guess I wouldn't complain so much if the service was top notch (our server didn't come check up on us once after taking our order), or if the food was exceptional- it wasn't.

4.0,7/29/2017,"Went here for restaurant week menu n was disappointed in the service.  The patio was 70% empty.  We had asparagus n the lettuce to start and I asked for bread.  The starters were amazing and we wanted to soak every bit up.  We were given two thin slices and thought our meal, which we didn't eat at a slow pace, constantly had to shoo off the bus boys who wanted to clear mid-forkfull.   As a vegetarian who loves pasta, for the main I ordered the pasta dish w/o seafood.  I had called earlier n asked if I that was doable and was told yes.  The dish was just fine (I understand the dish was meant to be WITH the seafood).  When the bill came we saw that we were charged an ""up charge"" for the pasta seafood dish per the price fix menu.   We paid it but felt it was petty.",2,0,0,M M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0
3.0,7/28/2017,"Went here for Restaurant Week which presented a pretty good value for such a fashionable restaurant. Had to wait 20 minutes to be seated even though I had a 7 o'clock reservation. Table bread was quite varied and fresh. Three different varieties were served. My party and I ordered the prix fixe menu. We had the Lamb Meatballs, which were served with ordinary pita bread and while well spiced, were drier than the needed to be. The burrata was fine, seeming a little bland and not really of a high quality. This is not the place to order burrata. The bread accompanying this had a delightful crunch For entrees we had the braised rabbit agnolotti, which while serving a skimpy portion of rabbit, was quite good. This dish was plated terribly and was the first thing I noticed when it arrived. Someone ordered the pork belly and seemed to like it fine.The chocolate cherry mousse seemed fine, but I've always hated the combination cherries and chocolate so I'm totally baised.The best thing on offer was the Stone fruit short cake. I don't even really like peaches but this cake and it's accompaniments were amazing. Order this! I was told the cocktails were very good too.The service here was fast and efficient, to the point of almost being brusque, and the servers have a hard time checking in on you because of how cramped and loud this place can be. Also, we hated the large printed photographs of butchers and fish mongers. Overall, I'd say this place is fine, but not really in par with some of its competition in Manhattan.

2.0,7/27/2017,"It was a good meal. Not sure if it was the 5 star experience I was expecting. The bacon appetizer + pork belly main was TOO MUCH PORK which I didn't think was a thing but trust me it's real. Lamb Meatballs were good but very very strong on the yogurt flavor. Buratta was amazing and very fresh and flavorful. Cheesecake lollipop tree was very filling but nothing special aside from the novelty of the dish. Drinks were good but pricey. Pork belly looked like it had come off the pig that day (In the temperature, cut, and color) which was a bit off putting. The pineapple fried rice was very inconsistent in flavor and didn't match well with the taste of the pork. All in all, it was a good dinner.

4.0,7/27/2017,"DB Kitchen was a particularly pleasant surprise, after I came away from Lure Fishbar significantly poorer, still hungry, and an aching throat from having to shout across the table. The acoustics here are pitched perfectly so you can actually carry a conversation without sounding like a smoker for the rest of the night. Both the food and the service were impeccable: I think we had no less than three servers checking up on us. They start you off with a small bread tray of three rolls and a slick of butter on a salt block. Having never come across such an inventive item before, my friend and I spent a good few minutes marveling over the block and running our fingers over it. The multigrain roll came studded with dried cherries and hazelnuts.My friend went with the RW menu, which is unique in that there are no fixed three courses and you can just pick an appetizer, main, and dessert from their regular menu. Definitely appreciate the wider selection. I was tempted by the lobster toast from their table plates section, though, and decided to forego the $42 prix fixe. They definitely don't skimp on the bread for the lobster toast: perfectly buttered and toasted. While I could always use more lobster, I thought the portion size was pretty reasonable for a $19 price tag. My beet salad was beautiful and fresh. No complaints about the generous dollops of goat cheese and pistachios scattered throughout. ... and we had to get the cheesecake lollipop tree. As soon as the waiter set it down, the tables next to us gawked their heads off. Come on. Something tells me you've been in New York long enough to see crazier gimmicks. The cheesecake lollipops were pretty sugary and rich and, despite both of us having rather large sweet teeth, we had to stop after two or three. I think a RW three-course meal, one lobstah toast, one beet salad, two drinks, and a supplement for the lollipops came out to about $120. I'd love to come here again for a celebratory meal but it's definitely a splurge.",7,4,4,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1203,824,173
1.0,7/23/2017,"This is one of the most disorganized restaurant services that I have witnessed. There was no bartender yet they offer drinks.

Great selection of wine. For appetizers, I had the lobster minestrone, DELISH! We had the beat salad & asparagus to share for the table. Both very fresh & tasty. My husband had the pork belly on fried rice and he was very happy with his dish. I had the salmon with was DELICIOUS & super fresh. Probably the best salmon I've ever had. I'm very particular with seafood. The salmon was buttery and perfectly cooked. It literally melted into my mouth. The sauce and the beans it came with complimented the salmon perfectly. For dessert we had the drunken donuts which was amazing & super fun. You get to squeeze your own fillings. It came with small bottles of raspberry, caramel, chocolate liquor. Highly recommend!

We also had a beet salad which was good as well---came with slices of orange and grapefruit, which really made it light and crisp. Great two starter dishes. I had the Caesar salad (without the added anchovies; by choice) which was OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS. Seriously craving it right now!! It came with pieces of Wedges and was really filling. It came with chicken which was like a little free range chicken on the side of the Wedges. Shaved fresh Parmesan cheese and the dressing wasn't too overwhelming. My mom got the cheeseburger, and of course I had to try it !! Soooo good!! Great quality and the fries and bun were excellent as well. Overall, I would give this place a 10/10.

5.0,3/2/2017,"We were already fans of the David Burke restaurant experience, so we knew we were in for a great meal when we found DB kitchen @ the James while strolling around the city on a Spring-like Winter day.Although we were hoping to be able to eat out of doors in the Garden rooftop, the warm weekend was a surprise to us all and it was not open yet for the season. We were surprised to find the restaurant not packed- nearly all of the city's 8 million inhabitants were out in force walking about. Upon entering the hostess seated us promptly and promised that our server would be over promptly. Not a moment later, Bethany came over to offer us water and a cocktail. I asked for a spicy Bloody Mary, and thats exactly how it came out. Garnished perfectly with a nice juicy shrimp that was cooked perfectly, it really hit the spot. The mad Russian was bushed from all the walking we had done and needed a pick-me-up so ordered a cup of coffee. Not completely starving and also not wanting to pass up eating at David Burke, we ordered light. An order of lobster toast that was so well presented it almost looked too good to eat. Large chunks of lobster claw meat and a healthy supple of toast served on a tray that probably would have held us over till much later, I still wanted something more. I asked for a side of bacon- not realizing what I was in for. Did I want the regular order or the special order? Special, thank you very much! With no exaggeration, probably the single best food decision I made this year so far.When the ""Clothesline"" came out, I could not have been more impressed. See the pictures and you'll know what I mean. After cooking it was still a full 3/8"" slice of heaven. Three pieces suspended from a clothesline complete with clothespins. A masterpiece of art and food combined. Yes, $18.00 is quite a bit for a ""side of bacon"". However, it was worth every penny. So delicious and almost enough for a meal in itself. I still show the pics to my friends and proclaim my wise choice!Overall, as you might imagine, we are huge fans and hope that you'll experience this great restaurant for yourself.

I was dying to try out their dishes to see what the rave was all about! Service and dining experience was splendid, I ordered two pasta dishes; House made rigatoni with duck egg and the Braised Rabbit Agnolotti. The first few bites was wondrous, each bite was textured to the right amount al-dente, creaminess and richness of flavor. Then after a few bites, it became boring and bland. Like the feeling you get when you eat too much of something and then you just get sick of it. The rigatoni was too much. It became too creamy and gamy due to the overwhelming meat to pasta ratio and so we left a mountain of meat left behind. The rabbit agnolotti, had a regular sized portion so we were able to finish it. But both dishes became less tasteful as we took in more bites. Maybe if the portion sizes were similar and if they came out with small sample portions of other dishes, I would have enjoyed it better. Also, the clothesline bacon, seems like a pretty neat concept but I wouldnt want to spend $18 on 3-4 pieces of bacon.

Some places offer their mediocre dishes during restaurant week, which makes no sense to me. If someone has a mediocre experience during RW, why would they want to come back and pay full price? That's just my opinion, but this place definitely is far from mediocre. Everything I ate was delicious. The celery soup was very tasty. It tasted like smoked celery, but puréed into a soup. I could have did without the chicken roll that came with it, but it added a nice crunch to the dish. The rigatoni was delicious! It was hearty and flavorful! My friend got the salmon and loved it also.  We shared the lollipop cheesecake for dessert. The dish was super creative and very good.

For appetizers, we got the celery root soup and the east coast oysters--both of which sounded promising but didn't deliver. The soup was a little too cream-heavy, while the oysters didn't taste all that special. For the entrees, everything just screamed heavy and unappealing. The flavor of the roasted sea bass clashed with the taste of the sauce, and the acidity of the citrus fruit. The House Made rigatoni was recommended by the waitress because of the variety of proteins and flavor--but when tasting it, I felt that the flavors melded together in a disappointing way, and didn't do much for the freshness of the rigatoni. The grilled salmon was probably the only decent dish, but by a small margin. As for the dessert, the infamous cheesecake lollipop tree was profoundly disappointing--it wound up tasting and looking like a toddler's arts & crafts project.

It's a lot bigger on the inside than I expected. The staff was friendly. The three of us each had a different appetizer from the prix fixe menu - Smoked Celery Root Soup w crispy chicken spring roll, Roasted Kabocha Squash, Roasted Beets.They all were great sized portions. I had the Kabocha Squash and really liked the  presentation of the large piece of delicious squash.  The warm brie was really nice with everything on the plate. I tasted my friend's chicken spring roll and it was SO good. Reminded me of a Vietnamese or Filipino style spring roll. (Yes THAT good!)For my entree I had the salmon (would have preferred to have something different than something I eat as often as salmon by ordering the other fish entree, but there would have been an extra charge!)The salmon was cooked PERFECTLY, juicy and tender and the skin was super crispy.  I eat brussels sprout salad somewhat frequently so it wasn't something too unique but still delicious. I really liked the crunch of the pomegranate, etc. A lot of people in the restaurant ordered the giant burgers, they sure looked good as they passed lol.For dessert 2 of us had the Hazelnut Mocha Budino, which had the consistency of a flan and - wow! So many delicious flavors on that plate, with crunchy hazelnut pieces. and my friend had the Lemon Meringue Tart, which she said was amazing. (I hope that tart is on the menu next restaurant week so I can try it).",2,1,1,Ginger B.,"New York, NY",169,255,719
3.0,1/25/2017,"Went here last night for restaurant week.It's good but nothing special honestly. For this price range, or less, there are soooo many better places. The staff was all really nice and attentive- except for the near absent bar tenders while waiting for my friend...more on that later. It's a solid place and if someone really wanted to go there, I'd probably go.Even with restaurant week pricing it felt a little over priced actually. Everything did taste great and they use quality ingredients from local source but the presentation is really basic in a way that I would do at home when attempting to be 'fancy'. It would possibly work better for them if the plating was actually more basic rather than trying to be fancy but not pulling it off. My friend had the squash first course which was just a big wedge, skin on, over 4 pieces of lettuce?? (imagine all the different ways that could have been presented...w/o lettuce obviously) I had the beet salad which tasted great but served in a bowl rather than a dish so it was a little annoying to eat. For the main course I had the bass and friend had the salmon. Both were served almost idenically- fish over top of the sides but the plates themselves were different and nice. At least we had $9 bottles of beer to smooth things over...yeah, $9 for a 12oz IPA.  The decor is a bit uninspiring and kind of weird...images of farmers hanging out with cute animals looking over you as you eat animals could turn some people vegetarian, which might be a good thing.?OK...the bar situation:They have a decent selection of whiskey but it's extremely overpriced- $18 just for some basic stuff like Bulliet. I got their house selection which is Breckenridge Bourbon which is a great bourbon and for $16 is was a decent pour. I did have to wait about 10min before ordering and it came full of fast food style ice 'cubes'!! This was blasphemous..they serve $18 cocktails. Good ice should be expected. After I finished, I was going to get another round as my friend was running really late...after waiting literally 20min the bartender just places the bill in front of me without ever asking if I wanted another. This isn't a fast-paced lounge or club but an expensive restaurant- good ice and fast, attentive service is the norm.",0,0,0,Matt B.,"Brooklyn, NY",455,37,8

5.0,11/5/2016,"My family and I came here after we went and saw kinky boots. It was also a celebratory 16th birthday for my sister. We originally had reservations for 7pm, but we got out of the show early. We were starving so we called and asked if they could take us earlier and they did! It was so nice. When we arrived we were sure to be appreciative of the seating. When we arrive at the restaurant we were the only people there. Our waitress brought out drinks right away with bread and butter on a salt rock. It was awesome. We ordered so much food so don't judge me with what I'm about to list. Our appetizers included: close line bacon, ham cheese and crackers, and seafood aracini rice balls. My dad almost cried at the sight of the bacon and so did the rest of the family. Everything was presented beautifully to the point where you didn't want to mess it up by eating it. As we scarfed down our appetizers we all were plated with our second course. My dad got the salmon, my mom the squash stuffed pasta, and my sister and I got the house made rigatoni with beef mushroom ragu. I couldn't finish the huge portion and took it home for second dinner later on. We then ordered dessert where my sister had a surprise candle lit mini cupcake made for her. I ordered the early gray creme brûlée. My dad the drunken donuts, these were the highlight of the night (also offered at all of David Burke's venues). And my sister the apple hand pie which came along with a cinnamon milkshake. We were all bursting at the seams at this point and made it a mission to finish our plates. The service here was attentive. The food whimsical and delicious. The atmosphere warm. The drinks strong and the family time we all got to bond over food was priceless.

1.0,10/19/2016,I was so excited to go to David Burkes because I saw their Cheesecake pops on the Food Network.  My husband and I went during the summer and were not overly impressed by our waiter James.  He seemed distracted although no one was in the restaurant yet.  We got through our meal and then it was time to order our desert.  He did not ask us if we wanted coffee or tea so we thought they may not have it.  (Right) After a few minutes I asked the waiter (out of curiosity) if any of the deserts had Almonds because my husband is highly allergic.  Unfortunately 9 out of 10 of their deserts have almonds even the Cheesecake pops :-(.  I mentioned to the waiter there was no indication on the menu nor did he ask if any of us had a nut allergy.  He came back with it is the customers responsibility to mention if we have a food allergy.  I do not disagree however I have gone to many other restaurants and the waiter/waitress either asks or it is indicated in the menu.  Because of the waiters attitude and the discomfort I felt I needed to mention our uncomfortable experience.  The desert chef was kind enough to come out and apologize and provide us with another desert which does not have nuts of any kind.  Still no offer of coffee or tea by the way.  The waiter pretty much ruined our chances of ever going back.,0,0,0,Christine D.,"Staten Island, NY",18,5,0

They have a seasonal menu which I adore because you get to sample something different every quarter. My brunch experience has been wonderful - typical menu but the flavors are always on point.

1.0,10/9/2016,"Made reservations to be seated on the roof, for brunch on oct 8th upon arriving (5min early) the hostess who was a lady wearing a dark green dress, shoulder length haircut with highlights was working at the desk. Usually it is very very common to get at least a hello or even a smile, but not from this lady she just stared at us and said you must go down stairs. A little confused and taken back by this considering this is a public Restursant and not some type of high security restricted area we were just intruding in. I told the employee that we have reservations and we are only about five min early and that we will wait until they are finished setting up, she replied almost shouting saying you must go down stairs, umm ooook so we proceed to the elevator waiting for the elevator to arrive she comes up to our group and said ""do you not know how to use an elevator, you have to push the button"". Wow thanks for the wise words of advise I don't now know I just walked out of a cave somewhere and stumbled into David Burkes kitchen. So we sit down stairs everyone else is very nice as usually food was amazing as usually, the waitress told us our bread board was comped by the manager because of what happened on the roof, ok that's nice but a simple in person apology would have gone a lot further then a $22 serving of bread.As a disclosure I did not visit this as a tourist NYC is my home town Born and raised plus I live just a few min away from the James hotel and frequent the restaurant many many times throughout the month.

1.0,10/6/2016,"This review is tardy from Mother's Day.  We were supposed to go to another restaurant but oops, change of plans so we came here instead with my new baby nephew.  The hostess, she was the mostest and offered us a choice to sit upstairs outside on the deck or in the dining room at the subterranean level.  We chose to go upstairs and sit outside because who doesn't like a little sunshine, but it was monsoon-like conditions and strong winds.  Big brother put a blanket over my new baby nephew so the wind wouldn't chap his face.I took time to do my hair and it just blew all over the place.  It nearly destroyed me and for the rest of the day I looked like one of those trees in Africa that grow sideways. It was an M-day menu so it was slightly different from the normal one.  We had a few apps, lobster toasts, some lettuce with radishes and a third raw tuna dish.  I'm not good at remembering things if you choose to read my other reviews, I ordered the hamburger and big brother most likely ate some of my fries but he's always paying so who cares, what do I know.  Who the hell knows.  I don't remember what everyone else ordered, sorry.  But something happened that almost killed my mother.  The old lady ordered  the non-alcoholic carrot ginger juice.  When it was given to her, she took a sip and thought there was booze in it.  She got the sauce allergies and can't have liquor, so in cases like this she makes me try everything because if I die, who cares, so I took a sip and detected something but I wasn't sure because I hate ginger and anything with ginger taste like glue..  We asked our waitress who assured her it was just juice.  My mother didn't want to drink it but then then a manager and another person came over and promised the old lady that the bartender assured them that drink was clean.  There was some hesitation from the old lady but she finally said fine because if the waitress, the manager, some random person and the bartender vouched for the juice then it has to be good.  For the rest of the meal ma sipped on her juice like she was in a  Ludacris video.     For dessert, everyone wanted the cheesecake lollipops except me.  Food shaped into lollipops makes me feel funny so I knew better.  When this pop tree came to the table I asked who ordered from 1-800-Flowers.  I thought someone was going to sing Happy Birthday.  The lollipops didn't taste very good.  The chocolate and cake lacked flavor and was just sweet and somewhat cheap tasting.  There was a small dish of pink bubble gum sauce on the side, and I gotta say, of all the things I've eaten in life, this was one of the most disgusting things on the planet.  If you've ordered this and you like it, I'd like to shake your hand.  I ordered coffee but I didn't get any cream or sugar so like a good neighbor I just used some of the cheap gum sauce for my coffee.But later that night ma's whole body started to itch and she developed a rash from her chest down to her legs.  She looked like giant eczema.  I drove her to the emergency room and they put her on steroids, then saw her doctor the next day.  Diagnosis:  murder.  Just kidding.  Diagnosis:  alcohol poisoning and anaphlactic shock.   On a serious note, David Burke is a celebrity chef and Kitchen is one of many restaurants bearing his name.  Something like should have never been allowed to happen.  The menu had two offerings of the same carrot ginger juice, one with alcohol, one without.  There should never have been a parade of employees come to the table to insist the drink didn't contain alcohol and insist it be taken as is.  It's an $8 drink, take it away and make the patron a new one.  We all informed the waitress that my mother cannot drink alcohol.  Whether it was a mistake on the bartender's part who accidentally made an alcoholic cocktail or accidentally added a splash before stopping, well, put a halt to it, throw it out, drink it yourself or give it away.But never ever ever continue to serve a drink or dish to someone who fully informed the employees that they have an allergy and don't bring a parade of fucking people insisting that it's okay to drink when it clearly wasn't safe.1 star for the tall hostess in the dining room0 stars for the resulting aftermath and cheap tasting dessert",3,1,0,Dew B.,"Stamford, CT",0,18,8

So here's my annoyance: the idea of restaurant week is that you get a great meal for a deal but here, most of the dishes on the menu have supplement charges, which negates the whole point of restaurant week. The food is also very pricery for the portions. The tomato and watermelon gazpacho is delicious, and unexpectedly delightful. I ordered the Eggs Benedict for my main meal, and the spinach was scrumptiously garlicky. I cleaned my plate.Now here's where the restaurant falls short in my opinion: the desserts. Both desserts I tried were WAY too overly rich and heavy. Personally, I ordered the panna cotta. It had good flavor but it was way too large of a portion, there was a strawberry jam at the bottom which was way too sugary and the berries on top were not tarte enough to make up for it.

She was fantastic, warm, attentive, and informative. When we finally met our server he seemed very rushed and annoyed. Clearly wasn't our fault, but me and my friend could feel it throughout our experience. The hostess continued to stop by throughout the night was the most redeeming aspect to that part of the experience. Now for the menu and food.  It's restaurant week, and my friend and I had tried during the last couple RWs to get a reservation here, so we were very excited to finally go, since we heard such great things (they offer their full menu during RW). Well, while they may offer the whole menu, the BEST things and most recommended dishes are anywhere between $10-25 EXTRA per item, on top of the $42 RW price.With two extras, a table share at $16 (the bacon, which is AMAZING), and a side of fries, plus 4 drinks total,  we spent ~$300. While this is COMPLETELY normal in NYC, it is NOT normal for RW, nor does it make sense for the food we were served. Felt very much like a, you're paying for the name, not the quality/taste of the food. I've never spent over $200 during RW, and that includes about 5 or so drinks per person at much fancier restaurants. I had the lamb medallions, which were NOT good. The puree of potatoes they rested on tasted like they had a hint of caramel, which was a very odd combination of flavors. The lamb itself was cooked perfectly, though under-seasoned. It was not very tender, and was much gamier than my usual experience with lamb (lamb is gamy as a rule, but not this gamy).My friend had the branzino, which was fantastic. The asparagus starter is nothing special (the hazelnuts were not fresh). The burrata was OK, but I've had better.

2.0,7/14/2016,"We had a 7pm reservation for 4 in the garden deck of the restaurant. First of all, I would like to start with the lovely hostess downstairs in the restaurant. She was sweet and let us put a bike in the coat room. Once we headed upstairs to the garden, it was a different story. The hostess wearing the blue wrap-around dress had a very bad attitude and was not welcoming at all. It was drizzling a little bit, but we still wanted to eat outside, so we requested to sit in one of the cabana type of tables. There were 5 cabana tables, with only one of them being occupied. The group that was sitting there was drinking wine and not even eating dinner. After we kindly asked the hostess to sit at one of those tables, she nastily replied with ""those tables are all reserved for people with reservations."" We replied to her stating that we also had reservations, albeit, the restaurant was quite empty. She proceeded to sit us down at another table with an umbrella over it. This was fine because the drizzling had stopped, but her attitude and demeanor was the opposite of what a proper hostess should be. We sat down and we saw her return back to her hostess stand and talk about us to her other hostess friend. Otherwise, the food was good and our waiter was fabulous. He was very knowledgeable and helped us make our dinner selections. The drinks were a little pricey for the size ($18 dollars for a small blackberry gin cocktail), but we knew to expect that. We ended up staying for around 2 hours and the entire time, NO ONE was seated at those cabana tables we requested to sit at. The nasty attitude of the hostess and the fact that she flat out lied to us about the tables. This is the reason I am giving 2 stars. Also to note, we were a group of 20-somethings in the restaurant, while the only group of people seated in the cabanas appeared to be in their 50's. We ended up spending over $300 dollars on a dinner, while they only drank wine. No wonder David Burke restaurants are closing down (Townhouse and Fishtail). Word of advice - don't judge a book by its cover and get rid of the rude personnel. We will not be returning to this establishment.

2.0,6/3/2016,"The ambiance here was so lovely and romantic, especially on a summer evening but I was really sort of underwhelmed by the food. Maybe it was the selection my group made so there's hope that some of the other stuff is better. The tuna tartare was alright- they had cubes of watermelon and tuna that were indistinguishable from each other, which was creative but when I come to eat tuna tartare I want more tuna than anything else, and I want anything that I think is tuna to be tuna. I also don't think the tuna was put in any sort of soy based marinade or any sauce at all, which made it a little bland to me. There's usually some marinade, maybe some avocados which go great with tuna, and scallions and other types of dressing but none of that here. The Brussels sprouts were, again, so so seriously underwhelming. It just seemed not cooked enough cuz it was still kinda hard in the center and again there seemed to be no seasoning on it or anything like walnuts or apples or sour cream for instance to keep it interesting. I always order Brussel Sprouts at restaurants that serve them and this is by far the most boring rendition of the dish I have ever had. My table ordered the duck medium rare so that preparation just wasn't for me based on my table's preference for how the meat should be cooked. There wasn't much else on the plate to nibble on except the duck and some charred romaine- again not interesting. We had some fries that were really good (the most well seasoned and interesting dish we got), but fries are fries- a restaurant's best dish can't be fries. Last but not least we had this cheese and nuts platter which was good, but again this is an appetizer and in conjunction with the main dishes the foodie in me will not be rushing to come back here. Actually, I almost forgot, had to deduct a star because two waiters came up to me telling me there was a cabbie outside who said he still needed to be paid- how awkward is that??? I hadn't even taken a cab to the restaurant and kept wondering why they were singling me out to waste my time with that awkward interaction- I had to be short with the second waiter who came to me. That's just bad service in my opinion. For a scenario like that where they were effectively needing to do guess work, it would have made more sense to just tell the cabbie they wouldn't be able to identify the person and move it along than bring awkwardness to my dining experience at their establishment.",0,0,0,Chi O.,"New York, NY",117,44,4

This would normally be a 2-star review but there was only one thing on the menu that lived up to the hype for a Weekend Brunch- The massive bowl of greek yogurt, honey, granola, and berries. Seriously the best yogurt i have ever had in my life. The yogurt itself was a meal. I decided to get the spinach and feta omelet as my main. IN all honesty, that yogurt was more than enough. I should have just ordered a side of bacon and called it a day. The ""omelet"" was a disappointment. It was merely a thin sheet of egg whites with pocket of spinach and a drop of feta cheese. It came with a small handful of lettuce. Not what I expected. My mother ordered the bialy and enjoyed it but they didn't prepare her eggs the way she requested and served her a runny egg sandwich on a cutting board. There was egg yolk EVERYWHERE. She enjoyed it despite the shortcomings and said the bacon saved the day. I ordered a side of the chicken sausage which was just okay. I would come back ONLY for the greek yogurt.

At one point 5 minutes went by where not a single employee was in the dining room - no server, bartender or busboy. Created a strange atmosphere.

3.0,3/16/2016,"First time I had David's cuisine was when he was at the helm at The River Cafe. Years have gone by since I ate there so I was excited to try his resto in the under belly of The James Hotel. Decor and ambiance was very nice. Perfectly dimmed lights and background music at just the right level where you can enjoy some tunes and still engaged in conversation with your dining companions. I am going to give this place 3.5 stars only because it did not really deliver that 4 star feeling. Started with the Pecorino Fries as an appy and the Foie Gras and Duck Pate Board. My girlfriend and I both felt that the fries were a small portion and the shaved pecorino needed to be melted more. The good news is, the Foie Gras and Duck Pate was probably the best I have ever had. Fried dates, large slices of grilled country bread, and a nice port wine as a demi glaze on top of the goose liver made it a true marriage of sweet and savory. As for dinner, I order the Breast of Duck from Long Island and Keek ordered the Seared Scallops. I thought the duck breast was nice, 5 slices of breast plated beautifully with some sauteed spinach and a lovely au jus. The Seared Scallops were accompanied with a crispy potato cake and some champagne butter sauce. Nice little number but definitely not worth the hefty price tag. The dish came with only 3 barely rotund pieces of fish. We split two sides, the brussels sprouts & shallots were excellent, probably the highlight of the meal and the beer cheese and broccoli, the beer cheese tasted like cheese whiz.Decided to skip dessert as nothing caught our eye.

I love the whole farm to table vibe and the place itself is so quaint. I really adore the pictures of the farms that surround the walls. Anyway, I started off with a glass of Syrah, which I wasn't feeling, and the waiter was happy to take it back and get me whatever else I liked. I went with a Sancerre which was tasty. Since it was freezing, I started off with their roasted acorn squash soup which was perfect for a freezing cold day. The soup itself is fairly heavy and creamy and they do give you a fair share. I loved slight the brown butter taste and the candied apple crumble. All and all sweet, creamy, and delicious. For my main I had the grilled head on prawn toast which was absolutely amazing!!

I brought a friend here who I hadn't seen since we went to school together as she was visiting the city.  I left kinda wishing I had gone for a more unique choice, but I needed a place that took reservations.  I mean this was just a notch above Sarabeth's for brunch I felt and maybe I should have picked a place more memorable.  That said, I do love rather bland American fare like this for brunch personally.  Hence, the Benedict.Btw, they do special things for b-days.  The family party next to us was celebrating a b-day and there was a special dessert with a lighted candle in it, but fortunately we did not have to endure any singing.There was also this couple here for v-day and they got the cheesecake lollipop tree and the girl was literally taking pictures of it for 10 minutes from all different angles, with it on the seat, with it on the table, mock eating it, kissing it, and even a couple selfies with it, and so we also got to see a bit of a unexpectedly comic show here.",1,1,2,Christine N.,"Manhattan, NY",138,374,294

2.0,2/5/2016,"Restaurant Week - Winter '16 - BrunchI came with a large group and had to wait until literally every person was here even though we have 9/10 people waiting for over 20 minutes. Appetizer: I started with the Greek Yogurt and Granola which although not the priciest, was probably one of the best decisions. The portion was MASSIVE and could have been a meal by itself. The fruit was fresh and large and I had no complaints. I did get to also try the Chicken Dumping which was a favorite amongst friends as flavorful and satisfying compared to the salads they had which were not very substantial (pass on those). Entree: I had the Skuna Bay Salmon which I asked for medium rare but came a little more rare than preferred. The Salmon was just okay and was not very special. The potatoes and bacon were not very flavorful and the sauerkraut was WAY too strong. Do not get if you do not like sauerkraut. The Kitchen Burger is what you expected, a normal burger that you could get at any other American restaurant that's not worthy of any special mention. The Brussell Sprouts and Mushroom Rigatoni was likewise bland and not exciting. Overall, the entrees for R.Week were very disappointing. Dessert: I had the Peanut Butter Candy Bar which was WAY too sweet for my taste. The bar itself was hard and chewy with some jam on the bottom. Overall tasted like a way too peanut buttery PB&J.

2.0,2/3/2016,"Came here for Restaurant Week and was very underwhelmed. I came during a very slow time, so I have not experienced waitstaff issues that other reviewers had (although our waiter was at times inattentive/distracted).The hostess was a ray of sunshine and most of the waitstaff was as well.  The decor and ambience is upscale casual, lending it to a relaxed, yet semi-fine dining appeal. However, the food was barely mediocre.I ordered the beet salad and was unable to finish it.  It reportedly is seasoned with citrus dressing, but my serving lacked in flavor.  I just tasted sliced pieces of beet, grape food, pecans, etc ... nothing special, just sliced segments of each.I then ordered the salmon dish medium rare.  It came very overcooked and dry with absolutely no seasoning (I didn't even taste a bit of salt and pepper).  I asked the waiter to please exchange the overcooked salmon with a medium rare one.  He was very gracious, but the second portion was half the size of the previous one (although, it was medium rare this time), and it was as bland as the first salmon.  This is a pity because salmon is such a naturally flavorful fish -- I didn't understand why it tasted so bland.  I suspect that the fish is previously frozen?Since I do not eat dessert, I asked to substitute coffee instead, which the waiter refused (I understand that some restaurants have a strict no substitution policy and David Burke Kitchen is one).  No problem -- so, I opted to add a cappuccino and it was actually pretty good lol.  The cappuccino ended up being the best part of my dinner.All in all, the food is barely mediocre (at best), but the waitstaff, hostess, and ambience are terrific.  But don't think that is reason enough to dine at this restaurant for a second time.P.S. The Restaurant Week Lunch deal is just $4 cheaper than the prix-fixe lunch that has almost the same menu (only dessert is different).",1,0,0,Teresa G.,"Bronx, NY",0,15,0
2.0,2/3/2016,"I went here for Restaurant Week Winter 2016 but this time was such a disappointment.  I came in 20 minutes early but we couldn't be seated until closer to our reservation time of 7:15 - I saw many open tables available but it was fine considering one person was running late.  The thing that disappointed me the most was the service.  Our waiter did not care and to me, clearly did not want to work.  No welcomes just ""what would you like to drink.""  Also walked back and forth for a good 20 minutes before taking our order.  Also no suggestions or any specials to mention or even describing the menu - I noticed another waiter in the next table describing the menu and was much more livelier.  He also didn't ask if we wanted any sides.I ordered the shrimp cocktail and prosciutto.  Was okay but nothing to rave about.  Seemed like cruise ship food.  Main entree was the duck - very small portion but very tasty.  Last was the panna cotta with cookie crumbles.  The cookie crumbles were too dry for my taste but mixing it with the panna cotta made it better.Back to the service - the waiter did not ask how we were doing or if we were enjoying our meal.  Also, no coffee or tea was offered with dessert.  Half way through finishing the dessert, the waiter puts the check down and walks away.  I see him watching me as I take out my credit card and rushes to take it back.  Only when I get my credit card back, do I hear thanks, just thanks - no thank you for coming tonight or hope you enjoy the rest of your evening.  I used to love coming to David Burke Kitchen but the smaller portions and terrible service has me thinking twice from going back.",2,0,0,Nicky C.,"Manhattan, NY",11,23,1

Service was exceptionally fast, I ordered a butternut squash soup, arugula and pork raviolo with spicy sauce and yogurt with wild berries. The food was delectable and sumptuous. The soup was so rich and thick. The raviolo was cooked well and the sauce was rich. The dessert consisted of many fresh berries. And don't get me wrong on the portions. The portions had me filled by the end. The waiters were prompt with their response and seemed to genuinely be attentive. Furthermore, they weren't pushy.The decor is well-lit (perhaps because it was the afternoon), and the room is overhung by a wooded panel that adds a sophistication. Overall, a great experience.

4.0,1/31/2016,"Overall a beautiful restaurant, and offered very complex and layered meals.  Coming here for restaurant week was definitely a good idea with the $38 prix fixee menu.  For my appetizer, I got the blue crab ravioli, and the shrimp w/ prosciutto. The crab was a little firm for my liking, but the shrimp dish had wonderful olive flavors.  For my main course I got the duck and would definitely recommend that, it exploded with the flavor of puréed sweet potatoes on the side and some greens.  I got the vanilla bean Panama cotta for dessert, and it was too sweet for my liking, but still fine.Overall, four out of five stars.  The portion sizes for the appetizers and my duck were smaller than I would prefer, and the service was very slow and often the bus boys would not answer my questions because they didn't know a sufficient amount of English (although I'm assuming this is because of the high volume of restaurant week goers).  I don't think I'll be back here because some of the menu items would not be worth the regular prices, but overall I had a great time!",0,0,0,Yianni K.,"Manhasset, NY",431,21,3

5.0,1/30/2016,"2016 Winter Restaurant Week ReviewDecided to dine here with three friends for restaurant week and this place didn't disappoint. The interior was nicely dim and would be a great place to bring a date. The bread they gave out was decent but unfortunately wasn't warm at all. The butter is presented on a block of Himalayan rock salt, which was pretty cool and unique. For appetizers we started with the shrimp cocktail and prosciutto which was nicely plated on a stone plate and really fresh. Also the blue crab raviolo (+$7 supplement), a single piece much bigger than the average ravioli. This was pretty good, but not worth the extra $7 to me.For mains, we had the creekstone farms short rib (+$5), the maine lobster & rock shrimp spaghetti (+$10) which was really flavorful and totally worth paying extra for, grilled branzino, and also the chicken pot pie. The chicken pot pie was more of a naked pot pie with the amazing buttery and flakey shell on top of the juicy chicken pieces and vegetables. According to the waiter, the short rib and spaghetti were the best sellers.For dessert, we decided to get the monkey bread for two (+$15) which was prepared right in front of us. I would compare it to cinnamon bread but on steroids. It first comes in a metal tin, then maple pecan ice cream, whipped cream, and banana caramel is added on top. This was a tad bit too sweet for my taste and could have probably done without the caramel. It says for two, but it easily serves four. We also tried the panna cotta which was good but not as silky soft as I hoped and not cold, and lastly the peanut butter candy bar which was just like a reeses peanut butter cup in a different shape. Overall for the main courses were definitely the winner of the show, ambiance was great, food was great and plated beautifully, and portions were really generous for restaurant week. Would definitely return and try out what their main menu has to offer.",1,0,0,Victor L.,"JAMAICA, NY",46,13,47
2.0,1/30/2016,"I came here for restaurant week dinner. The space is very nicely decorated and the server was very nice. The only major problem was that I felt the courses were too rushed. I was still eating my appetizer when my main course came out, and I only had my main course in front of me for probably ten minutes before bus boys started asking if they could take it away. Just because my fork is down while I'm speaking to a friend doesn't mean I'm done eating when my plate is still very full. Then they brought the check over while we were still eating dessert, which was fine, but the second we put our cards in, they took the desserts away. A bus boy only asking if it's okay to take something away while it's in his hand is really awkward. I wouldn't have minded taking another bite or two while waiting for our cards to come back, leaving a tip, and finishing our conversation. The food itself was largely very good and served in big portions. I had the burrata ($5 extra) and loved it. The chicken pot pie is deconstructed, so it's thick slices of juicy chicken in a cream sauce with vegetables with a separate puff pastry on the top. It's really good and definitely not pub food. I also had the panna cotta, which was definitely too sweet for me. It's also served in a mason jar with cookie crumbles on top, panna cotta in the middle, and quince paste on the bottom. The mason jar actually made it hard to get an even bite, but it also made it hard to get a bite of just panna cotta when the cookies and quince were way too sweet. Once they all got mixed together, it wasn't as appealing.  I appreciate the affordable restaurant week menu, but too many of the dessert options had to be shared, which is tough to do if you and your friend have different tastes, and quite a few options had additional surcharges.",0,0,0,Victoria D.,"New York, NY",0,31,30

Service beyond that was very good.You only get 1 piece of bread in the beginning and they take your plate away as soon as it's finished. Drinks were very overpriced, even for NYC. I ordered the shrimp and prosciutto appetizer. The prosciutto was delicious but the shrimp was undercooked. For a steak house, you would think steak would be one of the options that wasn't an additional fee, so I was obligated to get the salmon. Undersized & soggy skin made it unpalatable.

I ended up getting the beet salad, which was simple, fresh and flavorful; the spaghetti with shrimp and lobster, which was garlicky and delicious.  The Panna cotta was a bit gummy; the chocolate dessert was very chocolatey, which I liked.

My sibling had the Goffle Road Farm BBQ Chicken Dumplings as the appetizer, the Kitchen Burger as the main. For dessert we had the Cheesecake Lollipop Tree for Two. Hearty Green Salad: Big portion of healthy greens accompanied with pear and nuts. This appetizer was a great starter. it was light, healthy, and really pleasant. Skuna Bay Salmon: I wanted it to be medium rare but I got fully cooked. They were able to fix my dish and the salmon came the way I preferred the second time. The salmon was juicy and soft. However, the salmon smelled heavily fishy. The whole dish was too salty. Upon trying one of my sibling's dishes as well, the Goffle Road Farm BBQ Chicken Dumplings were fun bite size pieces.

The lighting of the restaurant was natural and bright, which complemented the interior perfectly. It's perfect for a casual meal in a really beautiful setting. My favorite part of their restaurant week deal was the variety of options that they gave. You could pick any appetizer, entree, and dessert and there were only a couple entrees with supplements on them. We got to try the BBQ Chicken Dumplings, Baby Beets & Citrus, Roasted Branzino, Arugula & Asiago Raviolo, Peanut Butter Candy Bar, and Market Berries. All of the dishes were plated nicely, but none of them stood out to me as to die for. The dumplings tasted like bbq ravioli dumplings. The beets & citrus was gorgeous, but was difficult to eat. Entrees & dessert were all ordinary to me. Overall, I enjoyed my experience here and I think for the price it is well worth it.

For my entree, I chose the pan seared scallops with crispy potato cake. Scallops were cooked to perfection. They were nice and tender, but just a tad too salty. The potato cake was also very tasty. There were some herbs/spices (possibly chives) mixed in and it gave the potato a nice flavor. The peanut butter candy bar was reminiscent of a sweeter, darker Reece's peanut butter cup. It was too sweet for my liking. My only gripe is that the hostess sat us side by side with other people when the restaurant was super empty. She kept bringing more people to surround us when I could clearly see that 2/3 of the restaurant was empty.

I can not believe that David Burke would be proud of this. The dessert were delicious, but I wasn't able to get over the terrible entree.

5.0,1/23/2016,"DBK does restaurant week right!The last restaurant I did RW at was a real letdown, so although I was hoping for the best, I was expecting the worst. I really did have my fingers crossed though, since I'd planned to take my friend out to celebrate his birthday.Initially, when I was searching for a place to make RW reservations, I was looking for a menu that provided more options than just 3 choices for the appetizer, entree, and dessert. DBK truly delivered on this front, and I appreciated that we could also order a la carte off the RW menu. However, I didn't really like all of the 'supplemental' costs. It's really a 'damned if I do, damned if I don't' scenario. I either suck it up and spend a whole ton extra, or don't and feel like a cheapo. Meh. For drinks, they had restaurant week specials which included a cider(?), cocktail, and a couple of reds and whites. I went with the dirt? dust? runner - which was made exactly how I like it. The sour, citrus-y base completely masked the rum, and if I hadn't started to feel the buzz, I would have thought there was no alcohol in it at all!For my appetizer, I went with the baby beets and citrus. I'm not usually a fan of raw beets, but since the description mentioned that the beets were marinated, I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did! All of the different components in the dish were in perfect juxtaposition. For example, the brightness of the citrus was the perfect complement to the sweetness of the candied pecan. I even ended up eating the goat cheese with the dinner roll I got (star anise and raisins, anyone?!)For my entree, I ordered the (deconstructed) chicken pot pie. It was super filling. The portions were generous beyond anything I've ever had during RW!! I ate my fill, gave my friend a portion of my chicken, and still had leftover puff pastry and chicken that I decided to pack up and take home. It was super flavorful and the chicken was nice and tender.Finally, our monkey bread dessert was delicious!! Yes, it was an additional $15, but it was definitely money well spent for 4 main reasons:a) You get to keep the super cute tin that the monkey bread is baked in. I can't wait to fill it with cookies!!b) There will DEFINITELY be leftovers, and ALOT of it. When we were debating which dessert to order, our waitress made sure to emphasize that we would definitely be taking some home with us!c) The server who brought it out was kind enough to make (very patiently) two individual servings of monkey bread, ice cream, whip cream, and caramel sauce for us. d) The maple pecan ice cream!!I'd mentioned in our reservations and called in the day before that it was my friend's birthday, and I was hoping that they would do a little something extra for him. Alas, they seemed to have forgotten and I didn't want to make it a huge deal. Either way, it was a nice, low-key birthday celebration. :)",8,3,4,Sherry L.,"San Francisco, CA",893,1172,889

We also ordered the House-Made Ricotta off the normal menu to try, and if you like your ricotta on the sweeter side, definitely check this out. Our mains were the star though, with the Short Rib over gnocchi (highly recommend) being so rich and tender, and the Seared Scallops equally buttery. Dessert was the Panna Cotta and Market Berries, which were solid choices as well. By this time we were completely stuffed so I didn't even mind that my berries dessert was just berries with a scoop of frozen yogurt on top.

The pickled pear was a nice touch but the dressing was really plain. I had the branzino for my main. The fish tasted previously frozen as the meat was very mushy even though it had the right cooking temperature and crispy skin. The chard underneath was drenched in oil and capers combined with lemon juice gave the dish too much acidity. Desserts seemed better executed than the savory courses.

I was looking for a place to eat that would be opened on Christmas, and this was one of the few nicer restaurants that were opened for lunch. I always wanted to try this place as i enjoyed David Burke's other establishments. The feel is casual and encourage a farm to table concept. The servers are very friendly.The Christmas day menu was $85 for a 3 course meal. Obviously, i think that it is a bit pricey for a lunch, but this is how restaurants get you. They overcharge on holidays.She ordered a salad for app and lobster for her entree. I had the Bison Tartare for my app and the Christmas Goose for entree. For dessert, we shared the famous DB lollipop tree.Her salad tasted refreshing and clean. The lobster was on point. It was buttery and cooked to perfection. My bison tartare was DELICIOUS (fave dish of the entire meal). The Christmas goose was yummy too. The goose was served 2 ways and one of the ways had a hint of cinnamon or nutmeg to it that made you remind of Christmas.For dessert, we were pretty full, so we only ate 1/2 of lollipop tree.

5.0,12/25/2015,"Today was our second visit to DBK and it continues to be a favorite for special occasions. We made reservations for Christmas morning and expected a brunch menu. To our surprise, it was a prix fixe 3 course menu. Fortunately, there were things my wife (no red meat) could enjoy. She had their chicken and I had poached lobster. Both were served, creatively, with ravioli. Mine was a flavor packed mushroom offering, hers filled with purée of basil. Again, creative and so good, they could easily serve as a main dish. My lobster was fresh tasting and cooked properly - lobster can get rubbery or tough in the wrong hands. Her chicken was moist and delish.My appetizer was the shrimp dish recommend by our waitress. My wife had the beet salad. Both excellent with taste explosions (no kidding) in every bite. Each ingredient earned its keep - rare for many dishes, common place here at DBK. The chef really knows his/her business. Dessert was similarly excellent. I had a 3 mini donut plate with chef made chocolate sauce, my wife had the gingerbread cake with an ever so tiny scoop of egg nog ice cream. Wish the ice cream came in a pail! It was fantastic.The bill with one drink, 1 tea and 2 coffees was $245 with 20% tip.

1.0,12/22/2015,"Pros: They were able to accommodate a party of 6 at 8PM on one of the busiest weekends of the year.  That is literally the only positive.Cons:  That should have been a red flag...the place was absolutely empty, the drinks were watered down and were roughly $18-20 each (I ordered a glass of baileys on the rocks - $18.  Think about that...$18 for 2 ounces of Baileys and 3 ice cubes).  The appetizers were unique and tasty, but don't bother getting them if you are hungry and are thinking about sharing them with others.  Bite sized portions.  The entrees were ok for some, and brutal for the others.  The  scallops were reasonably priced at $8.50 per scallop ($34 entree which contained a whopping 4 scallops).  Another member of our party ordered the $55 ribeye ""medium to medium-rare"".  I laughed out loud when he cut into it - it was like he was eating beef sashimi.  The rest of the group had decent entrees.  And by decent I mean they were edible and it took them longer than 11 seconds to finish their meal.  Oh, I forgot to mention another positive.  They gave us free cheesecake lollipops to make up for absolutely butchering the ribeye.  Nice gesture, but they were terrible too.  The best part which completely summed up our experience there - we asked our waiter to take a photo of our group at the table.  Not sure why we wanted to be reminded of how much money we wasted on that meal, but anyway.  The waiter took a couple pictures, looked at them, and proudly stated ""yeah they didn't come out good.  I think it's dark.""  And then placed the phone down and walked away.  He was great.To summarize, what a joke and waste of money this place is.",0,0,0,Kyle M.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",1,3,0

Although I'm not a big fan of donuts, soft and just enough sugar coated all around, not too sweet like a regular donuts. Marvelous services, everyone, was always smiling and friendly, it gives a nice welcoming feeling. Supposedly, they change the menu all the time because of fresh seasonal goods and what's in the markets, but I'm okay with that because I want to go back and try new things!",1,1,2,Jenn N.,"Brooklyn, NY",241,90,2497
4.0,12/12/2015,"It can be easy to miss the entrance to David Burke Kitchen, as the entrance doesn't stand out, and you actually go downstairs below ground level to the restaurant. Despite being downstairs, though, there are windows to let light in (presumably when it doesn't get dark at 4:30 PM), and the large wooden 'ceiling' hanging over the main dining area gives the feel of the restaurant one of being more rustic, even though everything else has a very modern, cosmopolitan feel to it. The service is very solid, with wine glasses being refilled frequently and food served in a timely fashion.I started out with a couple of cocktails; the drinks here are pretty well-executed. The wines and the beer were also pretty solid, although the beer selection was a bit more limited. For my appetizer, I started out with the gnocchi, which was very good...not as heavy as other gnocchi I have had, with the mushrooms giving it a bit more fungal earthiness, and the rabbit meat adding a touch of meatiness without being overbearing. It blended in with each bite of the gnocchi in a very complementary fashion to the dish. My main was the short rib, which was very succulent and fell apart very easily. The sauce was a tad on the rich side, which I think was done to overcompensate a little for the meat not having much flavor on its own, but I didn't mind at all. Dessert was probably my favorite part of the meal; I had the pumpkin creme brulee, served with ginger shortbread cookies. It was basically like eating pumpkin pie, but with a perfectly-done glaze of sugar on the top...a very original way of reinterpreting an American holiday dessert classic.Overall, the food was rock-solid across the board, with both the beginning (drinks) and the end (dessert) sticking out for me. I'd love to come back again and try out more of the menu items. A 'new' American restaurant that is extremely solid and well-executed overall.",2,0,1,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169
3.0,12/11/2015,"Never been to a David Burke's restaurant so I had to finally check it out. I had high expectations for this place but somehow the food just did not wow me, especially with the price. The only wow moment was the creativity behind the dessert. The appetizers and entrees were not memorable. - Lobster Toast: Twist on lobster roll, it was good- comes with 4 halves of a toast- Roman Style Semolina Gnocchi (rabbit): Forced myself to try this (poor rabbit)-- I'm glad I did because this was the highlight of the night-- rabbit tastes a bit like turkey to me, the mushroom was a nice addition- Blue Crab Raviolo: Too much crab-- not enough flavor (if you like lumps of fresh crab w/ no sauce, get this)- Hearty Green Salad: Yum, grass (good start to meal and to make sure you got your veggie intake for the day)- Creekstone Farms Shortribs: It was okay, not memorable- Seared Scallops and Charred Octopus: Love the scallop; could've done without the octopus- Maine Lobster and Rock Shrimp: yess, craving satisfied-- get this if you like spicy red sauce pasta- Drunken Doughnuts: This is pretty cool-- you get to put in your own choice of filling in the doughnuts (you get to choose from 3 alcoholic type of fillings with your normal doughnut fillings such as raspberry, caramel and chocolate) -- see pictures -- you can definitely taste the alcohol- Lollipop Cheesecake: Comes with bubble gum whip cream (they suggest you eat this at the end). Do not eat the bubble gum whip cream if you do not like bubble gum. Tastes 100% like bubble gum that you can swallow. The lollipop cheesecake's presentation was mediocre. The strawberries were not fresh and were close to rotting. The cheesecake itself was okay but some were just too sweet that 3 people couldn't finish this.David Burke Kitchen was too expensive for an average meal.

The Berkshire ham & cheddar board was tasty as was the lobster toast with celery seed aioli which was mouth watering. The Roman style semolina gnocchi with braised rabbit and trumpet mushrooms was amazing one of the most wonderful flavors I have tasted.For my entree I had the 30 day aged ribeye which was cooked to perfection. Sides of hand cut fries - ok and roasted mushrooms which were divine.the red wine which was the house wine was full bodied and smooth which went down a treat.Dessert was also very impressive which was the cheesecake lollipop tree which was as fabulous in taste as it was in it's presentation.The only downside for me was the over attentive service which I found annoying as I felt they were trying to pour as much wine as quickly as they could to keep more bottles coming. I don't like being hovered over. There is a fine line between attentive and annoying.,1,1,1,Mark J.,"Arlington Heights, IL",77,497,323

4.0,11/19/2015,"I love coming to David Burke for lunch. I never came here for dinner, so I can't provide a review on their dinner service. The restaurant has pretty modern decor, Once you walk in, you can either go up to their rooftop garden or if you don't want to eat outside, they also have an indoor seating area. Each one has its own host. I love eating at their rooftop garden as opposed to inside. I love being seated in one of the cabanas, it's wonderful on a warm, sunny day. The cabanas are also nice for a romantic date. Sitting at one of the tables with an umbrella is nice as well! A few steps down, there is also a lounge area with some couches. The atmosphere is very nice, however, the view is not the best from their rooftop garden. It still is a very pleasant dining experience. Lobster Dumplings - Tasted amazing! I HAVE to get the lobster dumplings for an appetizer whenever I dine here. The skin was not too thick, so it was not too doughy and you could really taste the lobster. I think I would like it better without the broth though. The lobster flavor in the from the dumplings were sufficient enough.Tuna and Salman Tartare - This tasted pretty fresh, lots of flavor, not too fishy. I would have loved if it was only salmon though, I'm not a very big fan of tuna. Fish tacos - It comes with three tacos per order. I loved the presentation of it. They were small, flavorful, and marinated nicely. Kitchen Burger - I have had this a number of times, love it every time! I love the jalapeno fries that come with it even more!Frozen Arnold Palmer - GET THIS. Never leave here without getting one of their desserts! I always order the frozen arnold palmer. It tastes like earl grey tea ice cream with lemon ice. It is BOMB -- sweet, refreshing, and light! Not only is the food great, I always get phenomenal service when I dine here.

The short of it is: Service is great, but the food is mediocre at best. If you want the full deets, read directly below.Drinks = C  They tasted fine but were $3 more than they same drinks just about everywhere else in Manhattan. I could understand it if this were a fancy rooftop bar, but this place doesn't even have a view!Appetizers = D  Skip the ""homemade"" ricotta. It's served cold and is bland. The Seared Hamachi & Pork Belly also disappointed; it was super small, and the fish tasted like it was from a can.Main Courses = B-  Short rib entrée was tasty and was portioned well. The pork special (sliced pork roast) was lackluster and disappointing. I had hoped to see the pork chop that several Yelpers had posted photos of. No luck, however. I guess it is a special they don't always carry.Dessert = C  Skip the monkey bread. It seems like a cool concept in theory, but it's all flair and no real substance. The flavor was fine (and so was the ice cream it was served with); however, the bread itself was dry-ish and not melt-in-your-mouth tender as I was expecting it to be.In my opinion, this place is just a dull, overpriced celebrity chef restaurant undeserving of the praise some give it.

For restaurant week, the deal was that each person received an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert for $35. What. A. Deal. As my appetizer I had the pretzel crusted crab cakes.  I was disappointed in the crab cakes.  They were very hard to cut into bite size pieces.  Crab cakes should easily fall apart with a push of your fork.   That was probably the main reason I give it 3 stars.  As my main course, I had the chicken breast.  The chicken was very cooked to perfection, not dry at all and the sauce it came in was a light herby lemon broth.  For dessert, the classic David Burke cheesecake pops tree for 2.  This includes three different types of cheesecake - shaped into a ball---on a stick.  Genius!

The scallops with pork belly (first time eating pork belly - I've avoided it because the name turns me off), though I only ate the meat was delish and came with creamed corn succatash.

But dessert was our favorite. The doughnuts were warm, fresh off the fryer, and came with chocolate, caramel and raspberry sauces with which we could fill each one.

I enjoyed a honey badger (honey vodka, apples and cinnamon) and it was great. My husband had a bourbon drink made with eagle rare, and it was just what he wanted. For appetizers, we shared the lobster toast, the rabbit gnocchi, salmon tartar and the pretzel crusted crab cake. All were Devine. The salmon just melted in your mouth with nice hints of citrus.

We were late but the restaurant was very slow so we did not have an issue. We sat out on the terrace which was nice. They gave us an option of outdoor or indoor. We ordered a bottle of wine ($125),  a first course for the table, individual seconds courses and individual main courses. The first and second courses were fired and brought out together then the wine was not poured until after our food delivred. I would say it took about 10 minutes until the wine was poured. The apps were good, lobster toast, gnocchi and burrata. The main courses were good except for what I ordered. The dry aged Rib eye. The steak was super tough and the fat on this particular Rib Eye was as hard as plastic. I had to swallow a few pieces that I would of rather spit in my napkin, but, who does that? I returned the steak and they removed it from the bill. They also threw in some desserts which I appreciated. In the end I would not return, the place is comfortable, clean and designed well. I thought the menu looked great at first but not enough focus is put on the food and service here. If you want someone to continually come back and drop $350-$400 for 3 people the service must be good. Our server was great, nice and anything I threw her way she handled greatly but I did get a feeling that the staff here does not understand the meaning of service, coursed meals, wine service, etc. If they add that and a few more items to the seasonal menu - sky is the limit. It is worth a try if you like food created by David Burke. I am sure eating here during the  fall season on the terrace is awesome.

Another 15 minutes later, we were looking around for her, wondering where our wine was and when we could put in our entree orders.

She was actually very nice...for the total two minutes we saw her the entire dinner. We ordered the tuna appetizer, short rib entree, and sea bass entree. The food was fine. Nothing truly spectacular (probably why i don't remember much from the first time I ate there). Problem was, the server disappeared again. We never got dessert menus, so we had to flag another person down for a menu. After deciding what we wanted, our server was still nowhere to be found, so we had to flag down ANOTHER person to take our order. The warm chocolate truffle cake took at least another 15 minutes, and then came without utensils so we had to flag someone else down, yet again. I felt like the most annoying person on earth, constantly waving people down to get stuff. By the time we got our check it was 10PM. A two hour dinner for just two people? Usually for the two of us we're in and out within 1.5 hours (MAX!). It wouldn't even be so bad if it was attentive, but we literally had to PULL TEETH to get any kind of attention. Anyway, nearly $200 later, that was kind of a terrible experience. We won't be back.",1,1,1,Aileen W.,"Manhattan, NY",296,39,22

2.0,8/19/2015,"Came here for restaurant week lunch. I'm  a vegetarian and their options tasted average.Main dish was a pasta that had no special flavor. A few pieces of  thick pasta with a white dressing, a few vegetables, and mushrooms.Kale salad appetizer had oddly thin pieces of kale. You don't skimp on kale in a kale salad! Who cuts kale into thin slices? In addition, the dressing, nuts, and dried fruit did not pair well. Not a problem in itself, but a problem in the overall salad because there wasn't enough kale and it didn't have the light and earthy yet flavorful and hearty taste that a kale salad usually gives. The dessert was described by waiter and menu as yogurt made with goat milk and berries. The yogurt tasted like sorbet with an artificial lemon flavor on top. The berries were macerated in lemony sugar liquid. Did not fit the description given. The yogurt did not have any of the thicker quality of goat milk.Not only were the flavors of the vegetarian dishes average, they were also misguided.

For my entree I ordered the charred broccoli which was paired with a few pieces of falafel, yogurt sauce, some type of grain I can't remember but it was served on a wooden cutting board which was cool! Overall there were so many different flavors on the plate but they all mixed together so well! The yogurt sauce was especially creamy & a little tart but with the broccoli the taste was amazing!

DRINK: I had the White Sangria, which had a healthy kick of ginger, which I loved. EAT: I had the rabbit gnocchi as appetizer, which was actually quite heavy for an appetizer, but very savory and delicious, I don't think I've had rabbit quite as tender! For the entree, I had the short rib on a risotto cake, which was also heavy, but delicious.I definitely recommend the Monkey Bread, which we had for dessert. It was ooey, gooey and amazing as it came piping hot and served alongside ice cream.The one downside is the mess that is the hostess stand. I know that there's an upstairs patio area, which is where I sat last time, but it's fine. The annoying part is that the hostess stand is a bit disorganized and as a result, customers that come into the restaurant get confused and end up cutting each other in line and pissing each other off (happened to me and my boyfriend as someone in front of us set off a chain reaction, leading to receiving some nasty glares from customers, YIKES.)",1,0,0,Christina C.,"Brooklyn, NY",294,77,79

I wasn't a big fan of gazpacho, but I'm not a soup person so my fault for ordering that. The ravioli part wasn't that great but the chicken breast was delicious!

I'll start with the good - pretzel crab cake is a must if you come here. Perfect crunch factor created by the pretzels and the crab was flavored perfectly. Our party got the short rib and the scallops and both were delicious. The short rib was so tender and the sauce that came with it was perfectly paired. Scallops - portion small but tasty.It started off well with our waiter as he fully explained the restaurant week menu in depth. He told us that there were some up-charges but it was noted right underneath. Pretty straightforward or so we thought. It then went from good to ok. Our waiter forgot our order. ""I can't read my own handwriting."" At first we thought this was just him being a nice guy and being honest, which we appreciated. But as the night went on he couldn't care less. When we got our bill he charged us for non-restaurant week prices - a notable difference. When we asked him about he said ""Oh, you wanted to be charged those prices?"". Yeah, dude. We ordered off the restaurant week menu - we want the restaurant week prices. His whole attitude about it just put a bad taste in our mouth. He clearly was trying to rip us off and expected us not to catch it. Oh - and he gave us forks for our dessert - which consisted of ice cream and pudding. Not really fork friendly food.

For my starter I got the salmon tartare and there was way too much going on on that plate to really relish the taste of the salmon. For the main I went with the scallops and the scallops was delicious, plump and very juicy and they had slightly seared it so the texture was just perfect. The bed of corn that it sat on was also yummy, the creamy sauce balanced out the natural taste of the scallops. My other friend went with the short ribs and that meat fell apart in your mouth, just delicious. The disappointing one was the main lobster and shrimp pasta. The portions of shrimp and lobster was tiny despite the $10 supplemental charge that came with that dish. The pasta sauce was disappointing (tasted like the basic marinara sauce out of the glass jars) and the noodles weren't quite al dente yet. The cup o dirt dessert was nothing special but that toffee monkey bread for two....I'm just drooling thinking about that.

It was easy to make reservations and you had the choice to sit downstairs in the restaurant or outside. Of course we chose to sit outside under the sun.I noticed the restaurant week menu only differed slightly than what was actually available- I wanted the branzino as notes online but in person this wasn't an option.Appetizer- wanted the asparagus but they were out, wanted the ricotta but they were out of that too, so got the tomato and watermelon gazpacho. For $5 extra you can get the corn and rock shrimp parfait with it-- I didn't ask for this and was annoyed that they subsequently charged me for this (especially since I didn't ask and they were out of the other 2 apps I asked for) but am happy it came with the gazpacho- these extra flavored were needed and deliciousEntree- went with the Salmon as branzino wasn't a choice.

4.0,8/3/2015,"After months of being on my list of bookmarked restaurants, I finally was able to eat at David Burke Kitchen, with 3 of my friends for restaurant week! The menu was quite extensive for a Restaurant Week menu, and some of the dishes really caught the attention of my friends and I. Walking in, the dining room was large and airy and the tables weren't close to each other, which was great. Interior decor was simple. The bar was HUGE! Unfortunately, I was with a group of younger friends, so I didn't wanna be the only one drinking.. Loll Food was just as impressive. For Apps, 2 of us got the burrata w. basil pesto and the other 2 got the salmon tartare. The burrata was delicious, creamy, and excellent combination of flavors with the pine nuts and pesto. Salmon tartare tasted fresh and vibrant. For entrees, my 3 friends all ordered the Kitchen Burger...medium rare (so much for variety..), and I went bold..with their 22oz. Dry Age, Bone-In Ribeye that had a $35 supplement, cooked medium rare. I didn't try the Kitchen Burger..so I can't comment on it; besides that the burgers looked very appetizing..lol At first glance, my steak looked fabulous. They even gave me a special steak knife to cut into the meat, engraved with David Burke on the blade. But that's where the good comments about the steak ends.As soon as I cut into the steak, I literally cut off a huge chunk of fat.. Like..8oz of fat off the side of it (exaggerating of course, but it was a fairly large piece of fat). Medium rare it was not, more medium, bordering medium well. It was still juicy though, so meat wasn't all that bad. However, I did not send it back. 2 of my buddies had to go to work afterwards and we were on a time constraint. Sending back the steak would've taken time to cook and stuff, and my friends' food would've gone cold waiting on mine. Begrudgingly, I ate the steak, until just the bone and the many pieces of inedible fat were left. For $35 extra, definitely wasn't worth it. Dessert, 2 of us had the Cup O' Dirt, and 2 of us shared the Cheesecake Lollipops. Both desserts were very tasty! Although, our Cheesecake Lollipops were accompanied by this small jar of pink Bubble Gum whipped cream that tasted awful.. At first, I took a small spoonful of it by itself, and my initial thought was it tasted like the numbing gel that the dentist uses to coat your gums with.. O_o There was.. MAYBE.. a hint of bubble gum flavor in there somewhere. Needless to say, we didn't finish that whipped cream..Lmao When the waitress brought over our bill, I saw a comment card on one side and so I filled it out, stating my disappointing experience eating that steak. Waitress took the bill back and like 2 minutes later, a woman (I would assume she's a manager) comes out and asks me about the steak experience. I explained why I had not returned the steak once I cut into it, and she was very understanding and courteous about it. She apologized, and said she comped the additional cost of the steak, which was very nice on her part. Customer service on point! Overall, our experience at David Burke Kitchen is still worthy of 4 stars..because aside from that steak fail, everything else about the restaurant is top-notch quality!

I ordered the buratta with pine nuts which was great. My friends order the salmon ceviche which was just OK. As a main dish we all got the short ribs which I would not say were great- I was definitely expecting more :(  the meat was not very flavorful and was actually quite bland. there were some tomato accents on the side and they just seems like they were balsamic infuse tomatoes.

If I was Mr. Burke, I would insist on removing it.The host staff was very nice in holding our table of 8 for us, as several were stuck in horrendous Friday traffic.The two main issues with this place were -1. Food was fantastically mediocre and small. My main course consisted of 3 small scallops which were fairly uneventful and the salmon tartare was nothing to go crazy about, either. They actually have a main course of just broccoli. Hilarious.2. The waiter was incredibly snarky and condescending. My friend is 4 months pregnant and asked about the cheese being pasteurized and he looked as if she just killed his puppy. She also asked if they could add a side to the broccoli for a vegan main course and he said ""NO."" How hard is it to put some sweet potatoes on a plate?Not to mention, I had to get up and change my drink because -after taking about 15 minutes to come over just to take a drink order, he got it wrong and didn't come back for another 15 minutes.

The pretzel crusted crab cake, the monkey bread, the steak all supplements. Hey that's the downfall of eating nice at a discount. In other news... My meal was good. I ordered app: salmon tartare, this was really good. The taste of cilantro sealed the deal for me, but i thought it would come with some breading, but it didn't. Oh they do have fresh bread, which we received during the entree. They carry around a basket of bread & u can select what you want. Which I feel is tacky but u gotta save those coins, right. The waiter should have been there before our apps. But I digress. Entree: I had the scallops. This was really good, I like the sauces that came with it. BUT, there was a huge slab of fat on my plate.

The wine list was also very geared towards more expensive wines and could do with more in lower range. Cocktails were great. Had cheesecake pops tree for dessert which I expected to just be a gimmick but was delicious. Good quality fine dining over all but didn't blow me away.",0,0,0,Natalie M.,"London, United Kingdom",25,104,47
5.0,7/30/2015,Came for restaurant week dinner and that's really how they get you because you end up spending so much more- nonetheless here's the rendition of what we got. Started with buratta salad and the gnocchi with rabbit. So. Good. The buratta was perfect in a bed of basil pesto and pine nuts and the gnocchi was rich and dense. For dinner we got the short ribs and lobster with rock shrimp. The short ribs were butter and they were on a bed of fried risotto which was basically like a fried mac and cheese bite. The lobster with rock shrimp was so on point and the pasta was homemade and cooked perfectly with a bit of a kick! Dessert was obviously the monkey bread- with a $15 supplement charge but at this point so worth it. It was phenomenal. They cut it in front of you and put a scoop of ice cream with homemade whipped cream and caramel on it and it's heavenly. Prices are pretty expensive on a day to day but this was a definite win for restaurant week!,0,0,0,Steph W.,"Dobbs Ferry, NY",68,32,31
1.0,7/30/2015,"OMG.  Does David Burke have a lot to learn from Mario Batalli.  We ate breakfast in DB's Kitchen on Grand and could not have have a worse experience.  While the food was adequate for breakfast; nothing special like I thought it would have been especially when they charge $7 for a croissant.   hen we sat down the benches were full of crumbs.  The waitstaff too forever to get us water and coffee.  Then after the coffee and water were finished, no one asked us if we wanted a refill.  This $50 breakfast for two on my wife's 60th birthday was a disaster.  Thankfully the dinner the night before at Babbo was perfect.  MB knows how to treat a customer.",0,0,0,Gary B.,"Jefferson, MD",0,3,0

I dropped about $300 on food with my date and nothing was memorable. Perhaps I should have had steak. So I think I need to go back and try the steak so I can have something really positive and really wonderful to say about David Burke kitchen.

We sat in the bar area, ordered drinks and that was it. No one asked if we wanted food, another round or even bothered to fill our water cups. You'd think charging $18 a cocktail, they might be more inclined to sell a few.  Really disappointing, particularly since it was not crowded until we were leaving. Other thoughts: Positive - while the glasses of wine are expensive, they provide massive pours and have a nice selection Negative - the salmon tartare was the size of a quarter",1,1,3,Joe C.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,6,0

The short rib melts literally melts in ur mouth. Absolutely love the crab cake and the lobster spaghetti. Dishes don't just taste like one bland taste but have layers. Hand cut fries have a thin crispy coat. Dessert wasn't too pleasing but it was creative. Cup of dirt is too sweet for me. They use authentic tea instead of tea bags which is a plus.

4.0,6/26/2015,"My friend was visiting from California, so this would be the perfect time to show her what rooftop dining in Manhattan is like. Unfortunately, her sister was not 21 yet, so many affordable options were restricted, so why not David Burke's Kitchen?! It has been a place I have been wanting to go to for a while. With no wait on a Wednesday afternoon, I was a bit hesitant about believing the good things I've heard about this place. But no matter! Manhattan is known for its late schedules. The rooftop bar started to get more crowded towards 1 p.m. I have never seen a waiter with sunglasses until I came here. Regardless of the shades, our waiter was courteous to explain the menu to us and each individual items as my friend was vegetarian. He gave suggestions on the best thing to order for a vegetarian. I opted for their lunch prix fixe meal for $29. My choices were as followed: Tuscan Kale Salad, Kitchen Burger, and the Frozen Margarita Sundae. After my weeklong splurge of noodles, Mexican food, and burgers, I decided to get something healthy. What better way than the hipster kale vegetable right? The salad was kale topped with apples, farro, cashews, and yogurt topped off with pecorino cheese. Seems like a decent balance of carbs, fats, and protein to me! If you like your salad with light dressing with cheese bits and slightly strong vegetable tastes, this is a winner for you!I was a bit split on what I wanted as a main course as I stuffed myself with burgers the week prior to this meal. Unfortunately, nothing really appealed to me at the time of dining except the burger, so I just stuck with that. Lucky for me my pick paid off! Surprisingly, this probably made my top 3 burger list of all time.... The beef tasted fresh and juicy (medium), the bun was flavorful and lightly toasted, and the condiments just tied everything together. It could possibly be the fattiness of the burger that made it so delicious. Despite how good it sounds, it wasn't all that great. I should have read the description as it was a semifreddo dessert, not an actual ice cream sundae dessert. Regardless, I didn't like the semifreddo too much. The flavor was very strong, similar to key lime pie. At least the presentation was pretty good. Overall, I was pleased with the restaurant. The bussers were on point always refilling our water and the ambiance was cool although the view wasn't the greatest. Great place to have a conversation and get a good meal!

1.0,6/16/2015,"This place had me contemplate getting up and leaving after getting a table.The atmosphere is not inviting; it's a big space with a horrible layout that feels cold.  The ""farm to market"" concept is in your face with pictures of people holding animals or their parts.  Um, ok.  When they give you the wine list, make sure to just ask what they have in stock.  I felt like I was hitting fly balls for a moment because every time I selected a wine, I was told no good.  Imagine selecting a wine, being told ""very nice Sir, be right back"", sitting there waiting as the a/c dries out your throat, the waitress coming back a few minutes later and saying, ""I'm sorry, we appear to be out of that"" and then repeating the process 4x.  I went from asking for rose, to white, to red, and then back to white.  By the time we were served I was clearly annoyed but I tried to cheer up because my girlfriend kept insisting on it. As to the food, eh.  The chicken dumplings were covered in an overwhelming sauce.  The ham and cheese plate was ham and cheese.  I ordered the braised rib which was soft enough to break apart with a fork but not good enough to overcome my contempt.  My girlfriend had the milanese which was a huge portion.  The string beans were plain and the basmati rice left me incomplete.  The dessert was good - we had the mint ice cream and chocolate cake. Your meal won't break $200 but that's because they don't really have many options.  I felt the menu lacking.  Very limited options so if you're a picky eater you will be let down.  That ham and cheese I mentioned was a stretch because I wanted an app and there was nothing else for me :(I did have plenty of sparkling water so at least I stayed hydrated.",0,1,0,David S.,"Hoboken, NJ",44,8,3

I had read a review somewhere that said this place was good.  It's a little off the beaten path but the space is pretty large.  We were sat in the main dining area (plenty of room to stretch out - hard to find that in NYC especially at brunch time).  The brought some carrots that had a pickle'ish taste to it and grapes as we perused the menu. I didn't catch the waitresses' name but she was super friendly and very helpful with suggestions.  She mentioned the doughnuts were awesome and that they only had 4 left.  We took a plate of 2 as an appetizer. I should have saved them as a dessert - they were SO good.  Very light and fluffy.  The first was a maple with bacon.  That was decent but the vanilla with sprinkles was incredible.  Probably one of the best doughnuts I have ever had.  For an entrée, I got the eggs benedict.  Presentation was good; I liked the fact that they didn't put too much hollandaise sauce on it, but it just was OK. It wasn't bad but wasn't the best I've ever had. My wife got the grits, eggs, fried chicken & biscuit.  I, of course, took a taste. I actually hate grits but those were some of the best I've ever had (really, I don't throw that phrase around as often as I've used it in this review!).  The fried chicken was decent but Root & Bone has better.  The eggs were perfectly cooked and the biscuit (I'm not a biscuit guy) for me was just OK but my wife loved it.  Overall, not a bad experience.  I'd come back for a birthday brunch for sure due to the size of the space.

For the main course I got short rib which was truly one of the best short ribs I have ever had. For desert we split a piece of chocolate cake and got the lollipop cheesecake tree.Compared to other restaurants , I think this place has some of the best selections for restaurant week as it offers a very robust menu.

4.0,4/1/2015,"The gorgeous dishes vibrant with freshness and color illustrate the farm-to-table concept  but the portraits of farmers with their produce drive the point home.David Burke Kitchen had extended its New York Restaurant Week, allowing for a three-course prix fixe comprised of menu items. We decided to take advantage, despite the supplements.Despite their allure on paper, the fancy drinks fell short. The ice cubes in the ginger beer and bourbon cocktail clinked as they melted, creating just a wet drink. The pisco sour was frothy and proud, tasty but not quite worth it.The food on the other hand, most definitely was.Textures tangled in the appetizers--slippery fish met with crunchy cucumber in the salmon tartar; flaky on the outside, the chicken grilled cheese was chewy and stringy and hot with cheese inside; the dumplings of the soup held tender lobster meat while the vegetables added life, freshness and texture.Classic pairings with refined twists morphed entrees. Succulent scallops, crusted with sear, settled nicely on soft cabbage and salty lentils, while the extra thick pork chop was garnished with an apple sauce and mature tater tots, and the tender short rib danced with a crispy brick of gorgonzola risotto. Dessert brought comfort and exotic notes. The gigantic monkey bread, served with all the toppings was warm and studded with pecans and soft bananas. The delicate tropical tart exuded sunshine, lime, pineapple and coconut filling out a crunchy cookie shell.The appetizers and entrees were aesthetically simple and contemporary, but the profiles were complex and varied. Produce and seasonal items were transformed into a delicious experience.",2,0,2,Randi E.,"Hoboken, NJ",388,155,456
5.0,4/1/2015,"It is similar to reading the Sparknotes version of classic novels. The shortcut simply fails to justify the original piece of work. An innumerable amount of restaurants that willingly participate in restaurant week, make the poor choice of editing their menus immensely, altering the full experience. These restaurants produce diluted and dull menus, missing their chance at captivating new patrons.Restaurant Week in NYC is a bi-annual tradition that occurs in winter and summer. It is the perfect opportunity for restaurants to showcase their best and reel in new fans. David Burke Kitchen is by far one of the best restaurants that participate. The reason is because their menu does not noticeably deviate from its original form. The menu is copiously crammed with an array of dishes. The portions are extremely generous. Not only are their dishes fantastically executed, but also, their customer service is sensational. The space itself is rustic and modern. My cherry-colored wooden table was parallel to a great glass-paned skylight, undoubtedly beautiful under brilliant sunshine. The candles illuminate the space warmly and seductively. David Burke Kitchen's menu is a collection of imaginative and innovative American dishes. The Skuna Bay Salmon Tartare is a perfect appetite stimulator. Tartare is a Parisian-inspired cold dish that is frequently made with steak. DBK utilizes fresh chunks of raw salmon, marbled in fat. The salmon is chopped and mixed with aji Amarillo. The mixture is molded into a sphere, and then topped with julienned radishes and cucumbers. The Tallegio Grilled Cheese is creative and delicious. The dish is updated with the unique substitution of an egg roll wrapper. A heap of chicken is shredded and topped with Taleggio cheese, creating a unique blast of flavor. The pocket is deep fried, served with fresh ribbons of raw cabbage, and completed with a dollop of sweet plum compote. The Mosafund Farms Mangalista Pork consists of a thick slab of seared loin. It is topped with roasted beets and served with a side of tator tots. The tots consist of a creamy potato filling that is finely pureed and deep fried. There are sweet drops of a roasted apple sauce that embellish the plate. The pork was perfectly seared and incredibly juicy. The Braised Short Ribs is made of a Pennsylvania Amish raised beef. It is well-seasoned and tender, falling off the bone with the slightest poke of a fork. It is accompanied by steamed leafy Swiss chard greens.Shortly after the dishes without any trace of food were cleared, the Mocha Mousse Bar arrived at our table. Three layers of whipped chocolate mousse are cut and topped with a dark chocolate skin. The mousse is perfectly light and airy. It is embroidered with a pirouette-like stick of chocolate, balls of praline crunch, and a puddle of melted salted caramel. The vanilla bean ice cream is a perfect complement to the dessert, binding flavors perfectly. The Toasted Coconut Tart is served in a personal-sized pastry shell. It is filled with a coconut and lime flavored custard served cold. The tangy mound of filling is topped with an airy meringue. The coldness of the tart is balanced out harmoniously with the warm apples that are diced and tossed in specks of chestnut-colored cinnamon. The food is phenomenal and DBK has gained a new patron.Some pro tips: Come hungry! The portions are large. DBK is armed with a full liquor license.",5,1,2,Kelly P.,"Manhattan, NY",374,130,473
5.0,3/29/2015,"This restaurant was a pretty decent nyc brunch experience. I rarely go to the city because of how crowded everywhere is and how small most restaurants are as well as the price. But I must say this experience was a treat. A group of six of us went to eat brunch because one person in our group was a former employee. The decor in this place is pretty stunning. Made me feel like I'm getting my money's worth because this place actually provides that ambiance one would expect that comes with the price tag. They obviously put some money into making sure this restaurant put u in a certain mood and I really do appreciate that. Everyone ordered cocktails and coffee. Since I can't drink worth a shit I ordered a ginger ale. And as silly as this sounds, this was the best ginger ale I've ever had. Granted, I've only drank Canada Dry and some generics of CD, this truly was a much richer ginger ale. You can actually taste the ginger, but not in an overwhelming way, it's a very subtle taste that blends well with the sugars and carbonation of the drink as a whole. Aside from that, Tracy, the pastry chef, brought us all out a bacon doughnut which really was an impressive mix. Genius idea as the salt and sugar compliment each other so well especially when warm. The vanilla doughnut with sprinkles was also rich in flavor and was so well balanced. Not too sweet but sweet enough at the same damn time. The next item everybody shared was the bread basket. Amazing. It has these little pieces of toast that I think was coated in brown sugar cinnamon. And comes accompanied with Apple sauce. Who doesn't like that. It had other things as well but I honestly can't remember what they were. The biscuits were awesome as well. Just get it u won't regret it. Fun fact: Tracy has an item on that basket named after her. Definitely try Tracy's Coffecake muffin. Next up me and my girlfriend shared each other's dishes. I had the burger. It had some sort of name in front of it but I forget. I forget a lot of details. Anyways this burger was pretty decent. Meat was very rich. It was an Amish raised organic meat or something. I felt better knowing it was probably raised well and fed more natural foods than the crap u buy from big named corporations. The fries that came with it are also very good. They're real potatoes fried correctly. They were so fresh and so clean. With herb seasoning on top of em flaked up added to the flavoring. My girl ordered the Maine lobster Benedict. Really. I really can't say anymore than that. Who thinks of this shit. U really gotta hand it to them they know what they're doing. Dessert there was some chocolate cake and some sorta pudding looking thing. I liked the pudding looking thing and the chocolate truffle something was decent too. I'm not really a chocolate fan. But I ate pretty much the entire pudding thing while everyone else ate the chocolate thing.One thing I noticed was seeing pictures all over the restaurant of meat processors and farmers posing with animals or meat or vegetation. I asked Tracy what was up with that and she told me that those are actually some of the vendors this restaurant uses. To me that says a lot. This restaurant ties themselves to local independent suppliers. Rather than trying to save money going after quantity and price. I love that about any company. That's truly a company that cares about their consumers and their vendors. I give five stars due to atmosphere, innovation, effort to provide the best service and product, cleanliness, and space. You don't get a cramped up feeling like most brunch spots in nyc especially on a Sunday afternoon. Definitely will be returning and I'm so excited to see how their venue is for an upcoming event I have to attend here.",1,0,0,Min H.,"Lodi, NJ",81,13,5
4.0,3/29/2015,"My friends and I came here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. We had 1pm reservations but was 45 minutes early, so we decided to see if they could seat us. Seating is early wasn't an issue at all which was great so we sat down immediately. The restaurant had a nice ambiance to it with an intimate feel. The tables were separated with good distance so the patrons weren't on top of each other. The overall decor of the place had little significant details that provides a history of the place (information provided by a friend who used to work here) Within a good timeframe of being seated, our drink orders were taken and we were served this amazing bacon doughnut and vanilla sprinkled doughnut by the pastry chef herself, Tracy. Tracy introduced herself as well as the amazing doughnuts she generously brought out. Each doughnut had just the right amount of flavor that was neither overpowering or lacking of flavors. The bacon doughnut had the perfect amount of sweetness from the glaze and the right amount of salt with the bacon pieces. The vanilla doughnut wasn't too sweet and the glaze on it melted in your mouth. Our group decided to order the Bread Basket, which came with a variety of different pastries. I highly recommend this item for a group of people. Since there was six of us in a group, everyone ordered evenly a breakfast item and a lunch item. Breakfast:Cinnamon Raisin French Toast- probably one of the more expensive and fancy French toasts I've ever had. It came with this orange meringue flavoring topped with a moose and maple syrup on the side. While my dish was good, I felt the orange meringue was a bit too sweet with the rest of the French toast, taking away the flavors of the cinnamon raisin toast. Grilled chicken BLT- I had only a bite of this, but the vote was enough to write a good review about this item. The portion for this is big and it comes with vegetable chips which were delicious. The chicken was grilled perfectly and wasn't too dry. The bacon added on was nice and crunch. Add all that to fresh Lettuce and tomatoes and you've got one good BLT. Although the food was good, I'd really have to say it took about an hour or more for our food to come out. We were one of the bigger groups at that time, but other groups of four who came in much later received their food first. Those at our table who ordered alcoholic beverages finished their drinks before our main course came out, and they were drinking slow. I wasn't sure what the hold up was but our waiter didn't seem to notice our food was taking long until probably a good 45 minutes into waiting. He did apologize and went to check on the food and said it was gonna be coming out shortly. Shortly turned into probably another 20 minutes wait until he realized we STILL didn't get our food. After the second time he checked on our food, it finally came out. Since we were seated early (around 12:15pm), we didn't get our entree until probably 1:45pm. Luckily we ordered the bread basket to hold us over for a bit. The manager, Jason, was walking around the restaurant introducing himself and engaging his patrons, ensuring we were getting the experience he'd hope for. He came by and spoke to us a little bit, which was a plus. Although our food took a while, our waiter did acknowledge our wait time and gave those who ordered a second round of cocktails on the house. I did take away one star on this review because of the wait time for the food, but the overall ambiance, staff, and food made up for the inconvenience. I would like to try this place out for dinner one night because this really is a great place for a nice night out. The cleanliness of the restaurant was great and the welcoming of the staff provided me with a good brunch experience.",0,1,0,Tiffany Y.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",145,222,393

3.0,3/21/2015,"I usually like to dine at a restaurant at least twice before I submit a Yelp review, but I doubt I will return to David Burke Kitchen in foreseeable future after my first visit. For starter, this location is a bit out of the way, and both service and food were mediocre.Burke is one of those snobby restaurants which the host would say ""we will not seat you unless the whole party is here"" even though there might be plenty of empty tables. There were also some unpleasant folks among the crowd. I couldn't tell whether they were drunk, straight up rude, or racist. The experience as a whole left quite a bad taste. Our party of 4 was seated in dining room downstairs. The restaurant's interior was lovely - dim and intimate sort. Tables moderately spaced apart, but a waiter still managed to spill water on me. Drinks are obviously overpriced for average quality wine and champagne. Our waitress took our orders and another staff came around to offer us complimentary bread - French rolls, raisin rolls, multi grain all didn't impress. Appetizer - Lobster Dumpling Soup was tasty but came off a bit sloppily presented. The Pork Chop lacked flavor and was unmemorable. Skuna Bay Salmon was tiny portioned and tasted plain. Braised Short Ribs was the only dish that stood out - flavorful and memorable.I don't see myself returning for a very long time, at least not until the bad taste wears off.

2.0,3/14/2015,"A more appropriate name for this establishment would be David Burke's Cheesecake Factory.I went here with my boyfriend for dinner on what happened to be the first night of restaurant week.  We were promptly seated at an excessively wobbly table.  We split the lobster roll, which was ok - kudos for big chunks of fresh lobster, but they skimped on the aioli. Who does that?My guy thought his salmon tartare app was the best part of the meal by far.  My ricotta salad was ok.  What was not ok was the fried, burnt brick of ""risotto"" that was served with my short rib.  First, Gruyere cheese mixed with rice is not risotto.  Second, it was burnt.  Third, the sauce on my short rib probably came out of a PF Chang's bottle.  While I was wondering what store bought sauce I was eating, I watched my boyfriend pull a fish bone out of his mouth.  Yes, bones happen, but that added injury to insult with this meal.Now for the wonderful service.  It sucked.  Our water and cocktail glasses were perpetually empty.  When the monkey bread was being prepared table side, my boyfriend was doused with a poorly aimed shake of powdered sugar.  Just as we started eating dessert, which was ok, our waitress set the check down on our table.  I understand the need to clear tables when things get backed up, but there were several vacant tables and no one was waiting.  Maybe you are thinking my boyfriend and I said something ""snooty"" in regards to the above criticisms, but we didn't offer a negative comment.  My boyfriend even laughed as he brushed powdered sugar off his shoulder.In conclusion, if you want some mediocre food, terrible service, and the Cheesecake Factory experience at a premium price, stop by David Burke's.",1,1,0,Kathryn S.,"New York, NY",1,3,0

4.0,3/10/2015,"I normally hate Restaurant Week, it's just a marlarky way for restaurants to make money by selling inferior products. RW used to be about restaurants offering discounted prices on items to give exposure to the restaurant, now a lot of places make a RW only menu which is of cheaper quality, it's kinda like how outlets have outlet specific clothes. David Burke Kitchen on the other hand is probably one of my favorites for RW. I really enjoyed the meal, it was well flavored, playful and just flat out good food. The restaurant is a lot bigger of a restaurant than I expected, it was packed the day I went but it was also surprisingly roomy and comfortable. The restaurant is located inside The James Hotel.The food:Skuna Bay Salmon Tartar-  Roasted carrot harissa, pomegranate lime yogurt, cucumber, radish, parsley salad, puffed leak. The tatar tasted nice but the texture of the salmon was a little off for me. I like there to be individual chunks of salmon, this tasted like salmon that was congealed together. The harissa I was not a fan of. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Crisp Chicken Confit Grilled Cheese- Tallegio, sour cherry marmalade, celery root, chicory, frisée, tarragon jus. Not exactly what I picture for grilled cheese but it was sooooo gooood. The grilled cheese was so awesome, they didn't skimp on the chicken meat, and the outside layer was kinda like a really nice filo dough. The sour cherry marmalade was nice palette cleaners, it had a nice sour note to counter the richness of the grilled cheese. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Green Circle Chicken- Root vegetables, white mushroom velouté, Parker House crust. I ordered this because a lot of reviews stated that this was a must, the pot pie was awesome! I normally hate white meat chicken but it was rather tender and juicy. The roll itself was really good but on the heavy side. The center had dark meat chicken as well, so basically the whole damn bird was in the pie. The sauce had a very chickeny-y taste to it and the flavors were great. yelp.com/user_local_phot… Black Sea Bass en Papillote- Celery root & pear, black truffle, roasted chestnut, brussels sprouts. I really liked this dish as well, the sea bass was really nicely cooked and the mushrooms were a nice addition. The brussels sprouts added a nice textural crunch. The broth was kinda weird for me though, it kinda felt like broth with fish on top, I would have thought the broth would have been thicker. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Toffee Monkey Bread for two- Banana caramel, maple pecan ice cream. This was an extra and it's served in this metal tin can that you can actually take home. The dessert is brought to the table in the tin and then the waiter serves this table side with the ice cream addition and caramel.

4.0,3/8/2015,Went for restaurant week with my gf and another couple. Had a great meal off the price fixe menu. Started with lobster bisque and kale salad. Kale salad was AMAZING. Lobster bisque was pretty good. Moved on to the scallops and shore rib for dinner. Scallops were good. A tad overcooked but still superb. The bed of lentils and duck lardons under the scallops was sensational. Short rib was awesome. Perfectly cooked and tender. A little salty. But hey i looooove salty so perfect for me though i could see how some could be against it. Finished off with a lolipop tree and the mocha mousse bar and mango sorbet with fruit. Cheesecake lolipop tree was good. Bubblegum whipped cream to dip was interesting. 3 flavors of cheesecake pops.  Mocha mousse was incredible. Like amazing. And so was the mango sorbet. Sensational. Pics of all of the above on Instagram: @NYCmeEATGreat service. Had a fun talk with the sommelier. She gave is some tips. Went with a cocktail and two glasses of syrah.

They are one of the few restaurants that essentially offers their entire menu during RW with a few supplemental charges for some of the items (like sea bass, scallops, monkey bread, etc) That being said, the food was good but nothing extraordinary. I liked the presentation of the lobster dumplings (the dumplings themselves nicely wrapped with two tiny claws sticking out of the top, and when it's served to you, they pour hot broth into the plate), short rib entree was only okay, and I finished every bite of my coconut lemon tart. Also tried the salmon tartare and sea bass (very truffle-y) and everything was good.

There were lots of menu options, the food was delicious (the melt-in-your-mouth short ribs were the winner at the table), each dish was presented beautifully, and the restaurant was full but not too loud. All great things except unfortunately the service left a bad taste in our mouths.One friend and I arrived a few minutes early and let the staff at the host stand know we had arrived. They were not at all friendly and, with a bit of attitude, told us we couldn't be seated until everyone had arrived. Our other friend showed up at 8:46 and they told us, with more attitude, that our table wasn't even ready anyway... A few minutes later we were seated. Our server was brusque and seemed annoyed with us from the start. We noticed another server walking around with a bread basket and offering it to other tables but he never came to us. My friend nicely asked our server if we could have bread and he said ""bread?"" and gave us an astounded look (as if we were requesting something super weird). He came back a few minutes later with bread. Throughout the meal the food came out very quickly, our server kept asking to take our plates away while we were still eating from them (which is always so awkward), and he never checked in on us. It was very obvious we were being rushed. As he gave us the check at the end, he turned on the charm and smiles in a snap while telling us that the restaurant was offering an extra week of Restaurant Week and we should please return.

I can taste the wine it was braised in. Very tasty red sour kraut. Pork chop was dry even tho requested medium. It's a big slab of meat but dry... I didn't care for the tater tots or the grilled apple and apple sauce on the side. Dessert:Mocha chocolate bar. Strong coffee taste. Plain ice cream on the side. Monkey bread, tasty but there's A LOT, like one is enough for 6+ peopleOverall.... Just ok. I left full. Wonderful staff. Very loud restaurant.

5.0,3/4/2015,"A++++++This was my first time at D.B. Kitchen and it definitely will NOT be my last. I cannot wait to return to dine upstairs in the Garden. EVERY aspect of the dining experience was EXCELLENT. Myself and another guest arrived a little early for our reservation. We were surprised when the hostess approached us with complimentary cocktails sent by the manager for us to enjoy while we waited. When is that ever done?!?Our server Sarah was well versed in EVERYTHING from appetizers to the drinks. She NEVER missed the mark. The short ribs were probably the most flavorful I have ever had. The Heritage Pork Loin was succulent. The lobster rolls were light and bursting with flavor(I'm not a fan of lobster, so that says A LOT). The Chocolate Crunch Bar for dessert was a fantasy!! To say that I was impressed and beyond satisfied would be a grave understatement. If this is how they do restaurant week, I can't wait to return on a regular day!!

The Resturant is located on the lower level the decor is nice ( even though there was someone left over cake pop on the floor by my table) and so is the wait staff. The food unfortunately was just ok. Nothing special or exciting. The presentation was nice but for that price range I expect more flavor and sophistication from my meal.

4.0,3/3/2015,"This was a 3.5 stars for me, rounded up because I liked the bread. During restaurant week on a Friday, David Burke Kitchen was busy, but not packed. I had a 6:45pm reservation. Unfortunately, my dining partner came 25 min. late, but we didn't lose our reservation.  To start off, we both chose a bread roll from a basket offered to us by a waiter. You had a choice of white, multi-grain, and raisin walnut. The raisin walnut was delicious. So soft and warm. Food came out really quickly, as if they had plates lined up and ready to go as soon as someone ordered.Appetizer:Lobster Dumpling Soup, roasted celery root, melted celery, carrots & leeks - The broth was delicious with a subtle lobster flavor. The dumplings were reminiscent of wontons, but for some reason were cold. Not sure if that was intended or not. It was very light tasting with vegetables and herbs, but I wasn't a fan of the ground lobster meat. Most of the flavor was in the broth instead of the dumpling. Entree:Sweet Potato ""Pie"", roasted hen of the wood, brandied pear, mushroom & sage emulsion - Best part of this dish was the roasted hen of the wood mushroom. I wish it was just a pie made out of that mushroom. I actually expected it to be a mound of sweet potato, but the ""pie"" was like a cake and a little too sweet for me. It kind of tastes like this orange juice cake that I make with 15 eggs. The risotto was on the firm side, but had good salty flavor, which somewhat balanced the sweetness of the pie. I prefer more savory flavors with my entree.Braised short rib, polenta, cabbage - The meat was tender, but this dish was kind of boring. I liked the salty, cheesy polenta, but the braised cabbage was too sweet. Dessert:Mocha Mousse Bar, chocolate paraline crunch, vanilla beam ice cream -  Super rich and chocolaty. This is a dessert for the chocolate lovers. I don't normally like coffee, but the mocha did not overwhelm. This dessert is really heavy.Winter Fruit and Mango Sorbet - Skip this. Nothing more than sorbet on a pile of fruit, and it's average sorbet.Only thing that a picky person might be annoyed is the servers walk around so fast and the space between tables is so narrow, that they occasionally bump into your table. The first time, a waiter pushing a cart knocked over the menu and silverware on our table. A few times during the meal, my elbow was bumped into and it wasn't even sticking out. Still, service was great as expected. The host at the front remembered my name as we were leaving, which I was really surprised. What a great memory!",5,2,4,Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",479,885,4955
3.0,3/2/2015,"Was just ok.Came here for Winter Restaurant Week 2015 yesterday with my boyfriend and another couple. Said couple was 10mins late for our reservation and they wouldn't seat us until our entire party arrived - hmph......The place:The restaurant is just GORGEOUS, with this contemporary American Brasserie vibe - I really loved it! And it wasn't overly noisy like most NYC restaurants. Definitely a good sign!The drinks:The waiter came by and asked if we wanted to see the list of wines by the bottle (they list of wines by the glass and cocktails was already given to us with our menus). We said yes, but then were shocked! There wasn't a SINGLE bottle of red that was under $80 on the list! I mean COME ONNNN. I've been to Michelin starred restaurants and they had wayyyy more reasonably-priced bottles. Just pathetic. Even the wines by the glass were upwards of $14 (more like $18 on average PER GLASS). Only the beer seemed to be reasonably priced.The girls both got glasses of red ($16 each), and the boys got beer ($8 each)The food:After we ordered our food, our main man AJ stopped by with the bread basket. I have to say this was the highlight of the evening. Get the multigrain bread. It does not disappoint. And AJ did a super job describing all the breads. I got the salmon tartare as my app which was great! But my friend got the lobster soup which I HIGHLY recommend - and you can use it as a vehicle for devouring the bread!!I got the pork shank as my main, which was just ok. Really fatty cut and the HUGE butcher's knife they gave me to cut the pork with was just cumbersome and just overcompensation. We got the classic cheesecake lollipops for dessert which were good.Overall:3 stars. A ok. I'd stick to fishtail if I want my David Burke fix.",0,0,0,Aviva G.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",5,25,11

The salmon tartare was very fresh. It tasted delicate, yet contained a lot of flavor. The chicken pot pie was very rich and delicious. Really interesting and unique take on a pot pie. It was like pot pie in a bread bowl. If you're not very hungry order something else because this is a very filling dish. If you have the space for it, definitely order it. The coconut tart was a great way to finish the meal. The custard was expertly made. I definitely recommend this place and I will certainly return.",1,1,0,Ilona K.,"Brooklyn, NY",130,167,9

It was not a full house so we were able to get seated early for our 1:45 pm reservation.There were a bunch of different options that you could mix and match with. My friend and I went with the salmon tartare, short ribs pappardelle, and a mousse dessert with hazelnut flavor. The food was all good, but it was not exceptional. The salmon was probably the best for me. The pappardelle was not as hot as I would've like it to be but the sauce was quite delicious. There was a poached egg in the dish topped with hollandaise. Personally I felt like the hollandaise sauce conflicted with the sauce of the pasta so it was a bit of a weird combination. The dessert was also good, but a bit too rich.The service was pretty good, probably because it wasn't that busy. The food also came out pretty quickly. Our server did not check up on us once though if our food was good or not. I felt like you should expect more from a fine dining establishment. Maybe it's because we went with the prix fixe. The ambiance of the place was quite pleasant as well. I could see this as a nice spot to have a relaxing lunch or a date.

4.0,2/27/2015,"I'm going to give DB Kitchen 4 stars because they were very nice about what happened.  We had an 8PM reservation during Restaurant Week, so the place was packed!  I'm sure it's packed otherwise, but definitely more packed than usual.  Just so happened that our table we were waiting at was full of  NYU students who couldn't figure out the bill - pretty easy guys just throw some cards down and stop arguing over dollars.  They made our reservation 40 minutes late and I was there for my Mom's birthday.  Learn some manners, kids!  Luckily the staff at DB Kitchen hinted after they had paid to get up by clearing the table quickly.  Thank you for that!  We had a couple of items on the menu because there were 5 of us.  For appetizers:- Kale Salad - it was alright - too much dressing.  I should have gotten something else, but I'm a big kale fan and the reviews I heard were raving about it... it was okay.  - Cauliflower Salad - it had a bit of an indian-y taste to it.  It was definitely a step up from the kale salad- Chicken Confit Grilled Cheese - recommend this as an appetizer - kind of like a chicken / cheese spring rollFor main, most of us got the Spare Rib - highly recommended!  Cooked really well and I really enjoyed the baked rissotto square that was underneath.  If you go for Restaurant week, definitely spare rib all the way.  For dessert, I would definitely say we had TOO much dessert:- Monkey Bread - Someone needs to warn you when you get this that the share between two people is enormous!  It's more like a share between the entire table.  We probably had a few bites of this.  If you like banana, definitely recommend!  I think I was too full to eat this. - Winter Sorbet - This was THE best sorbet ever.  It literally tasted like mango in my mouth.  Love it!  My sister-in-law got this and it was probably the smartest decision.- Mocha Mousse Bar - If you love chocolate, which I do, get this.  The toffee at the bottom is heavenly and the ice cream balances out.I highly recommend DB kitchen.  Great attentive staff!  Thanks for bringing out the birthday cake for us as well!  Will be back for sure!",4,0,0,Farah K.,"Manhattan, NY",118,56,1

2.0,2/25/2015,"David Burke kitchen is the perfect example of what happens when a restaurant has enough business to just stop caring. I came here two years ago and had a wonderful experience. Today I brought some out of towners here and was very disappointed. First of all, restaurants, please stop punishing your patrons for coming in during restaurant week. From the very beginning the service was fine but apathetic bordering on condescending. A member of my party ordered the cod for a ten dollar supplement and we were shocked to see a small shriveled up piece of fish on the plate. The broth poured over it tasted like fish scented sink water. The appetizers we ordered, salmon tartare, crab dumpling soup, and grilled cheese were all bad just bad and flavorless. By the time the entrees came we felt like we were being force fed. The short rib and pork were both edible but I could have made better in my own kitchen. Desserts were good but not as amazing as I remembered with far more limited options. I'm really sad because I used to like this restaurant a lot for the creativity of the food and hospitable service. The whole experience left a bad taste in our mouths. Not worth the money in any way.",0,0,0,Melody H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,1
3.0,2/25/2015,"Went to Kitchen for restaurant week and have to say I was a little disappointed with the quality of the food. UI was able to get a 3 course meal for around $30 during lunch time, and for what they normally charge it was a steal, but can't say that I would venture back.  The food was good, not great, the best way I can define it is lack luster.  It was beautifully presented, but lacked seasoning and I don't think the quality of the food is up to snuff for the price.I had the lobster dumpling soup as an app, the short-rib bolognese and the chocolate praline cake for dessert. The lobster dumplings were ok, not really flavorful and a little too doughy for me, the broth was luke warm, but really did add to the dish in terms of flavor.  I had the short rib bolognese as my main course upon advice from the waiter.  Dish was bland, some of the noodles were stuck together and the sauce was really splashy for a dish that had a hearty element (short rib), I was hoping for a bit of a thicker more substantial sauce.  Dessert was tasty, I personally love chocolate, but this was a little too rich for me.I do have to say the service was outstanding, I also liked that they gave grapes and pickled carrots out for the table instead of bread, it was a nice change.  All in all it was best to go during restaurant week, but don't think I'll be venturing back again as the prices and the quality don't match.",0,0,0,Sara W.,"East Rutherford, NJ",89,222,272

2.0,2/23/2015,"Went here for dinner on a Monday night during restaurant week. First, we arrived a half hour early for our Res and were seated immediately. However, the maitre d' wasn't the warmest. I had to speak up and say hello just to get his attention even tho I was the only person standing in front of him. My GF and I ordered cocktails to start while I looked over the wine list and menu. I should let you know that I am a Sommelier and in the industry. Wine list had lots of great producers, but were priced on the higher end side. From the get go we felt we were being rushed and looked down upon as tho we were just here for restaurant week. Which we were, but that should be the time a restaurant uses to get you in the door in order to ""wow"" you and make you want to come back. The opposite happened. The food was mediocre. Lobster bisque was blah. Salmon tartar was nicely prepared and very tasty. At this point the wine arrived. I had a 2007 red wine that could use some decanting. Not sure if it was because the waiter felt like it was too long of a wait for the wine to arrive, but he opened it himself spinning it vigorously while doing so. Whatever, that just may be the wino in me splitting hairs. Then the entrees arrived. We got the duck special and the short ribs. The duck was decent while it was hot, but upon cooling off, it lost much of its appeal. The short rib was a minuscule portion upon a large pile of braised cabbage. Tasty, but too small for even restaurant week. Desserts: we ""combined"" our pf desserts to get the lollipop cheesecakes. First of all, the only person to ask if we had any allergies was the person who brought us our bread. I informed him I was allergic to walnuts. Either that info was never communicated or was just forgotten, but the server failed to mention that the lollipops were covered in walnuts. So couldn't eat them. They did replace it with sorbet which was decent. But it's just sorbet. All in all, not impressed. Been to many restaurants in this city and worked in many as well. For our $220 bill for two people we could've had a much better meal at many other places.",0,0,0,Brian L.,"New York, NY",12,2,0

The food selection for restaurant week was very pleasing. We started off with the lobster dumpling soup and the salmon tartar. Right off the bat, we were amazed with the appetizers. Onto our main course, we ordered the braised short ribs, pork chop, and scallops. The portions were just good enough to not leaving you feeling hungry or too full. To finish the course, we ended it with the infamous lollipop cheesecake tree and the monkey bread. Please note the two desserts I mentioned is enough to feed four people sufficiently. We could barely finish our desserts and we were beyond stuffed at that point.Overall, it was an excellent experience for Restaurant Week at David Burke Kitchen.

4.0,2/22/2015,"My wife and I visited for Restaurant Week lunch and were overall quite happy with our choice. The decor was clean and modern, the waitstaff courteous and attentive, and the food mostly excellent. For our first course we ordered the Lobster Dumpling Soup and Salmon Tartar. The soup portion was large with a generous serving of lobster. The broth was very savory and tasty. The Salmon Tartar was noticeably fresh but lacking in flavor. Perhaps serving over something more flavorful like guacamole would have helped but still a good appetizer. Would rate both 8.5/10. The main course is where David Burke Kitchen shined. We ordered the Skuna Bay Salmon and Kitchen Burger. Both were incredible. The salmon was cooked perfectly, complemented well by its sides and of a large portion. The Kitchen Burger was a pleasant surprise - one of the best and most underrated burgers in the city. This monster of a burger was cooked to perfection with tender beef that just melted in your mouth when you bit into it, copious aged cheddar that matched the beef perfectly and thick cut bacon that was smoky and salty in all the right ways. Fries were perfectly crispy and golden brown as well. Would come back just for the burger. Both rate 9.5/10. For dessert we ordered the Cheesecake Lollipop Tree. This was certainly a novelty with an interesting presentation - about 12 chocolate dipped cheesecake pops were stacked vertically to resemble a tree - the flavors were varied and all quite good but I wouldn't order it again.

There's also an incredible spiced pear cocktail.  Starters included pretty much everything:--House-Made Ricotta: bedell north fork honey, garlic orange & cranberry marmalade, black pepper, toast--Hudson Valley Duck Toast: deviled egg, magret prosciutto, crispy duck tongue, grilled baguette--Maine Lobster Toast: celery seed aioli, toasted brioche, endive--Chicken Dumplings:jack cheese, schmaltz, cowboy barbeque, green onionThe duck toast was the star of the show based on presentation alone. It comes on a large wooden board with the prosciutto dangling from a clothespin line. You start by spreading the creamy deviled egg filling on toast, then top that with the crispy tongue and a delicate slice of prosciutto. A crunchy, savory treat.For my main I had the black sea bass en pappillote. The dish is rolled out on a cart and served table-side. The waitress carefully cut the fish from a sealed bag in which it was steaming, and placed it atop celery root & pear, black truffle, roasted chestnut, and brussels sprouts, with a ladle of broth and a dollop of cream on top for good measure. The sweet pear with the musky truffle and chestnut was such a satisfying play on flavors. When it was time for dessert we questioned whether it was possible to consume one more bite of food, but bravely ignored those instincts and ordered the toffee monkey bread, plated table-side with banana caramel, maple pecan ice cream and whipped cream on top. We also ordered the drunken donuts, served with individual bottles of bourbon caramel, raspberry limoncello, and chocolate kahlua (which the chef recommends injecting into the fried doughy balls). Both were incredible and but if you must go with one, do the monkey bread.",4,2,2,Christina K.,"Philadelphia, PA",473,128,107

Sweet!!It was a cold winter afternoon and naturally I wanted comfort food so I opted for the chicken thigh pot pie. It was phenomenal! They gave me a personal cast iron pan with freshly made bread. In the middle of it was pot pie deliciousness topped with a chicken thigh. Just great! I also loved how they start the table off with complementary grapes and pickled carrots.

4.0,1/15/2015,"For my appetizer, I chose the lobster soup, which consisted of lobster dumplings, white bean and a brown broth that is poured over the dumplings. The lobster dumplings were delicious little bites with a lot of lobster flavor, but I wasn't a big fan of the soup broth.My friend ordered the pretzel crusted crab cake which he graciously shared with me. This was absolutely wonderful - The pretzel complemented the crab cake part and it was cooked to crispy perfection and full of robust flavor that wasn't seafood-y at all.It was tough to pick the main course, but the waitress sold me on one of the brunch specials: Fried chicken with eggs, sausage polenta, and biscuit. This was a huge portion and I had to take home half of it, so I was quite satisfied. The fried chicken was crispy delicious and I really enjoyed the red sauce that it came with- Slightly sweet and very good. The eggs with the sausage were tasty- Fresh and flavorful. The biscuit was warm, buttery, delightful.For dessert, I had Rocky Mountain Road Sundae. which was delectable. When the waiter brought it to the table, he poured the special chocolate sauce that hardens, over the brown butter ice cream. The sundae also came with whipped cream, bananas, brownie bites and peanut brittle. The brown butter ice cream just by itself was delicious. It had a sweet, light flavor and everything combined together (especially the peanut brittle) was a  concoction of delight.",5,3,4,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",783,438,5876

3.0,12/30/2014,"I went here during restaurant week, and was excited to try it for dinner since I've had brunch here multiple times.  Dinner was amazing--seriously the food is top notch (order the braised short ribs, you wont be disappointed!).  However, I am only giving this 3 stars because the wait staff was extremely rude (I really want to give this 0 stars but the food is so good).  We had early dinner reservations and the staff really rushed us through dinner.  They never came over to ask us how it was or if we wanted refills, they kept trying to churn through the courses.  My husband was still eating when they tried to clear his plate.  We had to literally say that he was still eating and then they acted annoyed (umm, he had a fork in his mouth for crying out loud).  I understand that the restaurant is busy during restaurant week, but I never experienced such rudeness.  My husband couldn't even enjoy his meal since he was so upset by the service and we really don't have high expectations--Just don't try to rush us or take away food we are eating, and we will probably be happy!Though the food speaks for itself, I will never return based on service alone.",0,0,0,Kara L.,"New York, NY",21,17,0

The sommelier was very quick to answer all questions about the wine list, she was excellent in recommending wines that were solid pairings with the meals that were ordered.My cocktails (Manhattan; I know, cheesy given the restaurant location) were well crafted and I never went too long with an empty glass. The actual dinner was just as good. I had the filet, medium rare. It was superbly cooked and it was perfect portions. It was gone so fast I can only assume it was great!The meal was great, the service was attentive but not overbearing, and the atmosphere was awesome for our group.

4.0,12/5/2014,"Went here on a recommendation from a colleague for a business dinner.  While I didn't expect it to be overly crowded since we went on a Tuesday night, I was surprised at how empty the restaurant was at 8 pm.  Good NYC restaurants are busy every night!  In this case it worked for us since the sommelier and wait staff were particularly attentive to our dinner party.  On the former, perhaps it was because we drank 5 bottles of wine and they were progressively more expensive with each bottle.For an appetizer, I got that nights special - Foie Gras terrine.  I enjoy foie gras particularly since it's banned here in LA.  So in better places that serve it, I try to get it when I can.  I thought it was just a bit overly dense.  I don't know whether terrine's should be difficult to cut through with a fork (without aid of a knife), but that was the case here.  I've had foie gras terrine's before and they were always very easy to cut through.  That said, the terrine was still very flavorful.Our table also received a scallop flatbread appetizer complements of the chef.  It was a nice surprise and pretty good!For my entree, I ordered the Creekstone Farms Filet Mignon.  It also had bone marrow bordelaise, bearnaise, and shallot jam.  As a nice bonus, it included a roasted bone marrow - but no toast.  Alone, the roasted bone marrow was a bit too salty for my taste.  Along with the sauces and the jam, the filet mignon was just perfect.  I usually don't like sauces with my steak, but figured I'd give it a try here and wasn't disappointed.  The sides were quite forgettable however - spaghetti squash, roasted mushrooms and brussels sprouts.  Ah, one exception, the Angry Baked Potato (heirloom tomato pico, hudson valley sour cream, bacon, green onions).  Prepared tableside, the baked potato was a hit at the table.For dessert, it was recommended we get the Drunken Donuts and the Toffee Monkey Bread.  With the Drunken Donuts you were provided 3 flavors to infuse the donuts (bourbon caramel, raspberry limoncello, and chocolate kahlua).  They were good - but because we ate them after the Toffee Monkey Bread, they were underwhelming (if you get these, eat them first before any other dessert because I'm sure they're quite good).  But the true winner here was the Monkey Bread - holyfreakingcowitwasawesome!  The Monkey Bread (banana caramel, maple pecan ice cream) says it's for two, but there's no way 2 people can finish it.  We had 6 people and we didn't finish it all.  The Monkey Bread is pure decadence and I loved every single bite.",1,0,0,Thai N.,"West Hills, CA",36,172,14
4.0,12/3/2014,"I was introduced to this spot during NYC Restaurant Week, when my girlfriend decided to book us a table to eat. The special event menu that they provided, though a fraction of the size of their normal menu, still afforded quite the variety. The basement decor was splendid - warm, but not too dark. A good balance of an open, airy floorplan, but not so much to feel disconnected from other guests, and not so crowded as to feel claustrophobic like in many NYC restaurants.Presentation was lovely, as well as service speed. I do suggest going for their cheesecake lollipops, perhaps my favorite lasting impression.I can't speak for their normal prices, but definitely an enjoyable experience during NYRW.",0,0,0,Brandon L.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,4,1
5.0,11/25/2014,"Definitely one of the best brunches in NYC hands down.  Come here for a classic brunch with tasty, farm-to-table goodness in a comfortable atmosphere, in the basement of the James Hotel.We took friends visiting from Austin, TX for Sunday brunch and we all loved our food. The portions were huge and the food was delicious. Everything even looked so beautiful on the plate.  We tried the bread selection (everything was excellent and this could have been our meal alone) as well as pancakes, chorizo and garlicky spinach benedict, lobster benedict, and 'legs and eggs' (fried chicken and eggs). The staff was attentive with tea and coffee refills (at no extra charge). It was very quiet as we were there at 11 am, but it got slowly filled up as time went by. We ate our leftovers the next evening and everything was still so fresh and delectable. This is definitely a notable brunch spot, I highly recommend it!

1.0,11/24/2014,"Where do I start? It was a rather slow monday evening tonight when I decided to take my family out to give David Burke a try given the x amount of positive reviews this establishment claims to be. So a party of 3 came in with no reservation we get seated right away and we were being attended by the head waiter. So we ordered:PLYMOUTH BAY OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL & BISON TARTARE.Originally we wanted to try out the $45 filet mignon but the waiter shook us to go with the $65 per person party of 2 filet with the fear that there wasn't enough food to accommodate the whole table. Points off #1 was the poor recommendation because by the end of the meal all of us felt overly saturated from the big portions. Our server was a complete tool tonight and here are the reasons why. Warning before considering dining at this place. If you enjoy potentially being placed in an establishment where the servers will try to shake you down with poor remarks then this is a place for you. I came here in hopes to enjoy celebrating my mother's birthday but the server has given her such a bad taste in her mouth that this place is so beneath her. Our server was condescending implying that we are cheap by ordering appetizers, a share and 1 main for party of 3. He does not respect the fact that we order based on proper portions and whatever we are in the mood to try out. Out of so many servers and dining out for years, I never encounter one who has been so rude to the point where he didn't even greet us with his name. Points off for respectable customer service. Food quality:The oysters on the half shell were literately oyster shells with little to no oysters... no substance. For $19, you are better off going for $2 per oysters deal elsewhere with better substance and quality.   Food service is poor. There is an hour wait of time gap between the main course and the appetizers so naturally you already felt full from that long period of idling. Basically you are full from the bread they serve.  I would say the food isn't all that bad and distasteful. The filet was good and so was the bison tartare. There were too many reasons that drag down the star ratings and the server was the main reason. The server tends to try to look down on customers who he believes ""could not afford"" to dine on normal basis. This is coming out from someone who isn't even qualified to pass judgements like so and if he works there, I wouldn't say he could afford to eat there.",0,1,1,Alex L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,7,0

Walking into the restaurant first thing that greets u is the piggy at the door cute seems odd big ol pig statue but cute lol. We sat at the bar since we here for drinks & proceeded to chill for the rest of the time. They have a small drink menu some wines , very few beers nothing on tap & a list of strangely named over priced cocktails. Beers go for $7-8 not terrible for beer Cocktails $16-18 way over priced specially since it is a small glass. Since none of the cocktails or wine tickled my fancy I decide to stick w some Peroni beer , can't go wrong great tasting nice & cold. My friend decide to try the The Honey Badger cocktail this was Spring 44 honey vodka, lemon, cinnamon apple agave, black pepper terrible at first since it was super bitter ... But after asking the bartender to fix it a little it was much better a little sweeter & a lot easier to drink. These were our drinks for the night. The place itself is nice , big open space , nice bar area. Bartenders were nice & attentive. Once we were done we decide to take a look at the roof top bar , great area with amazing views.

2.0,11/1/2014,"My husband and I went to David Burke Kitchen to celebrate our anniversary. I think if we had stopped in for a normal date night dinner--and if the prices were cut in half--my review would be very different. We were hoping for an amazing, ""fit for foodies"" special occasion dinner, but what we got was a crowded bar with mediocre service and over-salted (and overpriced) food.The staff was kind enough to let us know that the dining room was closed for a private party the night of our anniversary. They said we would have a ""romantic table upstairs"" where the atmosphere would be intimate and ""anniversary appropriate."" What we actually had was a table up against the glass doors leading out to a terrace, where the door to the outdoors kept blowing open and freezing us with cold air. They also failed to mention that the upstairs area is a bar--not romantic at all. The shares were the best part of the meal. We had the homemade ricotta and the lobster toast, which were both tasty. We shared a squash canneloni appetizer that really wasn't good. The squash was undercooked and didn't taste right with tomato sauce and cheese. Our main dishes were the pork, which was decent, and the sea bass, which was too salty.I think our experience suffered from a restaurant that was distracted by a large party and unable to accommodate other people dining on the late side. I wish they would have just closed the restaurant down if they had to focus on the big party, because my husband and I were really disappointed.",1,0,0,Diana R.,"New York, NY",4,10,0

4.0,10/19/2014,"We had a big group dinner for folks in my industry on a Saturday night. The place provides pretty stellar service and I was impressed by how attentive the waiters were.The reservation was for 7:45 and we were seated promptly. I will note that I made a reservation about 3 weeks earlier and when I called one day out to confirm they thought it was a party of 3. Luckily they were able to rectify their mistake and still welcome our large group.Upon seating, you are quickly presented with bread, grapes and a few carrots. An eclectic assortment, but perfectly suitable for all you health nuts out there (minus the excess carbs from the bread of course). I sampled the pisco sour and a rum and coke, both of which I would characterize as strong enough and tasty enough for their high price tag.Again, I want to re-iterate how impressive the service was. When water glasses are constantly re-filled, I'm a happy person. I decided to go big, and ordered the 22 oz rib-eye which was cooked to perfection. The flavor was certainly there and it was nice and juicy (compliments to the chef). We also split a bunch of appetizers, including the spaghetti squash (decent), brussel sprouts (great) and green beans.We tried inquiring about hopping over to the St. James hotel roof top which was connected, but the manager politely informed me that after checking with them, they couldn't guarantee a party of our size admission to the upstairs bar. She was very courteous about it, so if I was dining here I wouldn't assume that you could just go up there after eating a meal. While I did not order desert I did try some of my friend's choices. The chocolate caramel cake was a little to sweet for me. The apple pie combo (with ice cream and god knows what else, it was huge) tasted great!Overall, I thought the food was good but not amazing. However, the crowd was fairly trendy and the noise level was sufficient enough to be able to converse with at least half of my table.

We got there for a 7:45 reservation and the table was ready, and they were nice enough to let us sit. The downstairs dining area has a descent size to it, and was well spread out. This may be the first place ive been to that gives not only bread, but also grapes and carrots to nibble on. To drink I took a rum based cocktail that had just the right amount of mint leaf in it. The name is eluding me, but it was a sweet drink and I ended up getting two. For my main course I got the green circle chicken which came with tuscan kale ravioli, thumbalinas, carrot & pecorino broth. The chicken was well seasoned and the ravioli really hit the spot. I also split some squash, brussell sprouts and broccoli sides. Perhaps a touch on the salty side but still equally tasty.For desert I had the chocolate hazelnut crunch bar, that came with vanilla bean ice cream and rasberry ganache. The portion wasnt the biggest, but man did that crunch hit the spot. A great desert overall. The service was great, one of our party was almost 45 minutes late and they didnt rush us to order and made great suggestions to the table. Our drinks/waters were always refilled swiftly as well.

4.0,9/1/2014,"We went here during restaurant week.. I have to say they have a very big selection for restaurant week (but sadly a lot of them have supplemental charge), but it's still good... The 6 of us ordered almost everything on the menu, and we enjoy the meal very much.  The only ""problem"" we had was that they messed up our order twice.. first brought out something we didn't order.. then mess up one of our order where we have to wait for it to be cooked again... but they also offer free coffee for one to ""compensate"" the inconvenience.. which was niceService was great!! Food is okay!! Will I come back?? I guess depend if the menu is changed a bit since we tried everything... ;)",0,0,0,Dorothy L.,"Montville, NJ",178,218,107
1.0,9/1/2014,"I went for lunch and it was the worst food and service experience ever. The appetizer was a jar of junk! They have little jars with nasty little sauces for you to spread on toast. The one I had was tomato, ricotta and avocado. This combination would make you think you were having something savory. Well think again! It was citric and sweet, the taste threw me off completely. I nearly gagged it was so horrible! For the main course I had the beef ravioli... What a mistake! It was one big ravioli stuffed with mushrooms and beef on top of some nasty little frozen food isle green peas. Then they had the nerve to top it with runny egg yolk which was not in the description at all. Lastly, the chocolate cake was dry but not as bad as the app and the main course. Oh and the service was quite poor. The server was sloppy and slurred his words. He barely had any knowledge of the menu and no class at all. He never checked on us and had to be asked several tomes for things he forgot. I would never return to this establishment again.",0,1,0,Maritza F.,"Co-op City, Bronx, NY",39,5,1
4.0,8/29/2014,"Loved this place!! One of the best places I have been for restaurant week, really. My general experience with restaurant week menus is that they are terrible, limited, inflexible and charge extra for anything remotely decent in the option list. There - I have said it.. But truly, not this place. They do not have a special menu for restaurant week, instead its the just the FULL regular menu, and supplements for a few options (read very few). As with all restaurant week lunches, they offer a 3-course menu for $25. Ridiculously cheap if you take into account the quality of food, the extensive menu, the number of courses and the ambience. I came here for brunch with a few friends on a Sunday. In the summer, you can sit in the garden upstairs - it is beautiful, sunny and just about perfect.  I am vegan and gluten free and they were more than happy to accommodate for my requests. Not only were they able to accommodate for the entrée - they made something from the dinner menu. And wait for it... all of it was still charged for the restaurant week $25 lunch menu! For the appetizer, they made me the market greens salad - personally I thought it was too much of the bitter greens and too little of the goodies (as I refer to the stuff apart from greens in a salad) but still a good palate cleanser. For the entrée, they made me a cauliflower steak with mushrooms on a bed of puree and with cherry tomatoes (from the dinner menu as previously mentioned). It was by far one of the better vegan entrees I have had at a non-vegan restaurant. The sear on the cauliflower was perfect; it was cooked through and melted in your mouth. It was spicy and tangy, the puree added a richness to it and the cherry tomatoes a tart sweetness. I would highly recommend trying this dish.  For dessert, I got the berry sorbet with meringue and fresh berries. The meringue was light and airy and the sorbet was so berry-licious and a perfect way to end the meal!",7,3,5,Akrati J.,"New York, NY",1373,211,712
3.0,8/28/2014,"This is a restaurant week review... not sure if it matters though.I came here with a girlfriend on the last friday of Restaurant Week. We were somehow able to get a reservation, albeit, it was at 9:30. We were pretty pumped since this restaurant is usually something that would be out of our regular-night-out price range and sounded pretty delicious.We were able to snag a table outside once we got there, which was really nice. I had no idea the place was as large as it is. Once we sat down, we were greeted by our server and we decided to order a bottle of wine since the deal for 3 courses was fairly reasonable. We also ordered our food at the same time. I got the pretzel crusted crab cake and she got the burrata, and we split both. For my entree, I ordered the salmon. And as our dessert, we split the cheesecake pop tree. Well, we waited so long for our wine to come to our table that we got our appetizers before we got our wine. Little disappointing. I don't think it was the server's fault, he did say he went to check on the wine twice (guess they have a sommelier at the restaurant or something?). Also, we saw a lot of tables get a little basket of bread or something when they sat down, yet we didn't get anything. RW discrimination? Or just a mistake?Anyways, the food was just.. ok. For the price that it was (and would have been normally), it was just meh. The crab cake was good, nothing crazy amazing. My salmon was pretty bland. The cheesecake pops were probably the best part. Pretty disappointing all together. I honestly don't think I'd come back here, especially not for the price that the food is. It was cool to have been able to come to a David Burke restaurant, but it just felt overhyped. A big womp womp.",0,0,0,Christine S.,"Manhattan, NY",46,165,2

The cauliflower steak was inventive with great flavor. The service was little pushy: our plates were cleared before one of us had even finished. Then the dessert menu was immediately handed over and we were asked for our order within about 45 seconds. Strangely, there were plenty of open tables around us. Finally, after settling the bill, the waitress came around to collect the receipt and actually looked at the tip amount right in front of us. I thought that was a bit strange. Don't get me wrong, overall it was a very enjoyable evening, but I think this place needs a bit more polish to justify, for example, a $25 cauliflower dish.",1,0,0,Jacob A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,20,0
2.0,8/22/2014,"This is a Restaurant Week Review.Overall: This place is just overrated and overpriced. Even for restaurant week, just so so so pricey.Decor: We sat on the rooftop, and it was really nice. There was no view of anything, just sitting outside in a covered area. But still very nice.Service: Our waiter was attentive, but seemed to be in a big rush because we were there for a late lunch and they had to close out for dinner soon. Kind of annoying--why take reservations that late if you know you're going to have to rush customers? It all came together when the waiter told us we could stay as long as we wanted, but had to pay ASAP because dinner was starting soon.Food: The appetizers were good. I got the fish for my entree, and I had the best entree out of everybody. Want to know why? Because it was like +$10 from the restaurant week menu. They basically make all of the restaurant week stuff crap, other than the stuff you have to pay extra for. Also, I'm not 100% sure, but I don't actually remember the +$10 being on the menu, because I was certainly surprised when the bill came. Also, the restaurant week menu was different from what they had online for some reason, so if you're like me and you like to plan ahead because of dietary restrictions or whatnot, expect to be surprised when you get there. For dessert, we got the lollipop tree, which was actually really good. It was like a cake pop thing and, for two people, was actually a good amount! The quantity of food for the price was decent--the quality was just not there. It wasn't bad, by any means, but you could tell that not a lot of effort was put in and that they were kind of just trying to get us to hurry up. Drinks: Overpriced, overpriced, overpriced. Look, I'm not asking for the drinks to be cheap. But I am asking that, if the drinks are $16 a piece, that they be great! My wine was $24 and the quality was not great. The other drinks were fine, but for $16, just not worth it.",0,0,0,Rachel G.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,35,3
4.0,8/21/2014,"This place is great.  I would give it five stars if the service had been a little better. We came for restaurant week and their entire menu is dedicated to it, so you have quite the options to choose from.  The initial appetizer course I actually had to pause conversation to enjoy was the dates with peanut butter wrapped in bacon. Make sure whatever you do you try this treat. The appetizer was fantastic and the main course melted in your mouth (we had the short rib with pasta). These are some of their traditional items which are definitely worth all the hype. In addition David Burke kitchen had a great bar tending staff. Unfortunately the server was fairly inattentive and it took them forever to get our order or bring us our meals. We actually had to ask for things twice to get them, including the check.  Because the food was so amazing, it did not distract from our experience all that much, but it is noteworthy.  I would certainly go back to this place again.

Even though I did not sit at the bar area, their bar area is nicely set up and very well stocked.I was here for restaurant week summer 2014. The menu was pretty full and they provided many choices. The food was tasty and delicious. The salads were a bit overwhelming with kale. Other than that, they were not bad. The course that I enjoyed the most was the salmon. It was grilled perfectly and the flavor was just right. The food came out pretty quick. The one star missing was due various, but small, problems... 1) Even though we had reservation, we had to wait for ten minutes because they couldn't get a table ready for three people. 2) The seatings against the walls are of couches and I sat at one. It was not clean and I could feel the crumbs of food when I put my hand on it. It could be just at where I was sitting. 3) When they sat us, our wait staff forgot to bring us bread. We had to remind her to bring it. When it finally arrived it was after our appertizers. Also, their women's bathroom has a staff in there attending to their customers.

2.0,8/14/2014,"This would be the second time I've been to a DB restaurant and I would say that it's a bit of a let down. I agree with the other reviews of it being overhyped. I've gotten some much more memorable and delicious meals during restaurant week (without any crazy supplements).The first time I had the pretzel crab cake which was great, the mushroom cavatelli was not really suited to my tastes. I've enjoyed other truffle flavored dishes but there was something about that dish that I didn't like.The Lollipop Tree is great to try if you haven't before. Its fun and memorable, but after that it's okay. The bubblegum whipped cream was not as flavorful as I'd wanted. Kind of like lightly flavored seltzer water. Yes it does taste a little like pink bubblegum but really really watered down.I came a second time this year because I thought maybe I'd just chosen poorly on the entree.This time I tried Tuna and Salmon Tartar which was good but the fish itself was pretty bland. I wish there was a bit more of an acidic hit on the fish. It relied heavily on the dots of sauce on the side to add any flavor.We also ordered a Peanut Butter Maple Bacon Dates which was. Ok. Overall feeling was we wished it was more bacon-y. The PB & dates overpowered the bacon flavor a bit. But the sweet fried grape was a nice flavor burst at the end.The main entree, I went with the waitress's recommendation which was the Heritage Pork and that was very meh. The pork was pretty lean and tough. The cornbread was dry, maybe even a little overdone. The entire table was pretty displeased with it.For dessert the Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Bar was something I enjoyed a lot more. Really rich and the crunch definitely adds a great texture to this silky smooth chocolate hazelnut.. mousse?Overall. Okay, but pretty forgettable.",1,1,1,Ellen S.,"Elmhurst, NY",36,25,25

In order to get any of the more desirable dishes (rib eye etc) you really had to pay for it ($35 more). We started with the Tuna and Salmon TarTare which was great but I have definitely had better, as well as the baby octopus which I thought was pretty dried out and chewy. For the entree we had the Branzino and and Short Ribs, both were tasty but not very memorable. The desserts were great, a simple sorbet with fruits and the Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch Bar. I must say the Crunch Bar was the best item we had all night. It was extremely decadent and I really appreciated the love that was put into it, I couldn't get enough. The service was great and the ambiance was OK, nothing to write home about. Overall, I was not extremely happy with this Restaurant Week location, we did not feel any need to come back.

If you're paying $30 something for a regular dish, might as well do RW. Every single dish was over seasoned with salt. A friend had the salmon which was cooked to the consistency of a rock. I had the Prawn Pappardelle, which tasted like they soaked the prawns in salt water and they added more salt while cooking it. It was relatively empty for a Friday night, no reservations needed past 8:00pm, probably. The drinks are decent and our waitress was very nice, but the guy who brought out our food was a little rude. It was also a friend's birthday and we had brought a cake (cake fee FYI), which they brought to the back but didn't alert our waitress about it.

4.0,8/1/2014,"Like other yelpers, I was ecstatic when I saw David Burke Kitchen was participating in NYC Restaurant Week!! Who would say no to a $25 prix-fixe lunch for a gourmet restaurant that typically charges ~$20 for an entree?? My brothers and I came here today to a practically empty restaurant around noon, so my reservation was not really that useful.  But to be safe, just make it ahead of time ;)Here's what we dined on:Appetizers:-Parfait of Tuna & Salmon Tartare=very fresh to eat and paired nicely with the rye toast & creme fraiche, but I did not think it was that flavorful.  It tasted somewhat plain to me and could have used a bit more seasoning to it to give it that extra boost.  -Pretzel Crusted Crab Cake: beware the $7 supplement. But even with the extra charge, this appetizer was well worth it! They used the Asian crackers, Pretz, as the pretzel crust and pair that with the moist and fresh crab cake, you'll be sure to have some interesting textures & flavors partying in your mouth! Definitely a MUST TRY!! It was quite a unique appetizer.-Lobster Dumplings=comes with 3 dumplings, this was a cute dish.  A bit small in my opinion, but like the tartare, it could have used a bit seasoning to fully enhance the lobster.  The lobster itself was very fresh and moist.Entrees:-Branzino= really fresh & flavorful.  The fish itself comes deboned & is a mediocre size of a filet.  But the vinaigrette it comes with elevates this dish to another level.  It's a light, lemon, tomato, & fennel vinaigrette which sits well with the fish.  Definitely a MUST TRY!-David Burke Kitchen Burger= your usual upscale burger, but with their signature DB steak sauce, crispy bacon, and fresh & moist patty.  It comes with jalapeño & parmesan fries so it's a classic burger & fries.  The steak sauce wasn't all that special in my opinion and the burger tasted like any regular burger you get at a restaurant. -Lobster Roll: beware the $10 supplement, but this roll was DEFINITELY WORTH IT!! It may not look humongous but trust me, they stuff so much lobster meat in the roll and they pair it with some old bay fries! You get so much delicious goodness in this dish that you'll be full halfway down the roll!!Side:-Jalapeño & Parmesan Fries=needed more parmesan flavors, it was quite plain since they just throw some jalapenos on top and sprinkle some parsley as a garnish. It was $8 for a side, but noneless, we felt bad that one brother didn't get fries with his dish, so we got an extra side for him =)Desserts:-Cheesecake Lollipop Tree (for two): THE BEST!! MY FAVORITE!!! This was by far one of the most unique and intricate piece of art I've ever seen & eaten in my food history!! (Pictures to follow).  The dessert is presented to you in a wonderful dessert stand and comes with 10 cake pops (3 flavors) with BUBBLEGUM WHIPPED CREAM!!!  Be warned, this dessert is meant for TWO people as it states on the menu (if you come with a party of 3, you and someone else will be sharing this dessert while the other person gets his/her own).  But, if you're like me or my brothers, we were fighting with our stomachs to finish this dessert. It was too delicious to doggie bag it back home and it was too good to surrender it to the clean up staff.  So we ate them all and I can say we're still floating in DESSERT HEAVEN!!-Arnold Palmer Semifreddo=this was such an AMAZING dessert.  It comes with lemon-flavored shaved ice on top of sweet tea ice cream.  My goodness, the ice cream was so creamy and flavorful!! I've been savoring that flavor since we finished that dessert.  It's delicious & refreshing!!We had a wonderful time here during lunch at DBK and I'd certainly return to try their other dishes & desserts!! It's such an affordable meal for such an expensive restaurant when it's not Restaurant Week.  So, take advantage of the NYC RW deals and make sure you experience those flavors!!

We were seated promptly and our waiter was great, we pretty much all ordered the same thing because his recommendations sounded so good. The crab cake was great, more of a crab bar than a traditional crab cake. The salmon and tuna tartar was small but my friend said it was delicious. We all got the ribs, so good. It reminded me of brisket the way it fell apart. It was served over a pasta and a sort of mushroom chips. For dessert we got the crunch bar, sundae, and sorbet. We all left completely stuffed.

4.0,7/28/2014,"I was told that DBK had the best Restaurant Week menu in NYC, hands down. I think I would have to agree.I usually avoid Restaurant Week, because the majority of restaurants tend to dumb down their menus for the sake of saving money. And with the crazy rents in NYC these days, who can blame them? However, David Burke Kitchen does a good job showing off their menu, and I can feel confident that I've tasted something that they would have on a normal night.My friends and I decided that we would try to get various dishes so we could try everything. We started with the pretzel-crusted crab cake, lobster dumplings, tuna/salmon tartare, and the baby octopus. My favorite was the baby octopus, since it was so tender and the puree on the side was bomb. The pretzel-crusted crab cake was very good too, although I felt it was a little too hyped up. The tuna and salmon tartare was the perfect texture and the accompanying sauces were great.Entrees were very good, with my favorite being the short rib with cavatelli pasta. The beef was just the right amount of saltiness and tenderness. Branzino was tender and had a very light, not-too-fishy flavor that I really appreciated.Dessert really was the most decadent part of the meal. We got the toffee monkey bread, which was outrageously good. The homemade whipped cream on top really made a difference, as the cream had a really good density to it. The chocolate hazelnut crunch bar was probably my favorite though, since I'm a chocolate junkie. The crispiness/crunchiness of the chocolate bar was perfect and definitely rich. The strawberries and cream tart was actually very tart, which was fine, but I probably couldn't have eaten a whole serving of it.Service was so-so. The rotating waiters were very quick about water, but our main waitress pretty much forgot our entire drink order until we reminded her 20 minutes later. She seemed really out of it, and while I understand it was busy, she seemed to avoid our table after we told her she forgot our drink order. Yikes. However, it wasn't enough to ruin the experience and we had a great time.Overall, I would definitely come back for the normal a la carte dining menu. The portions were definitely good for the price, and I've been told I need to try the cake pop tree, and the dry-aged ribeye. I'll also be back for the upstairs garden seating at the Treehouse bar.",17,8,8,Eric J.,"New York, NY",490,923,1792
1.0,7/28/2014,"I was entirely unimpressed with this place for a multitude of reasons. First of all, when you pay 17 dollars for a mixed drink it should literally change your life. Basic drinks such as a gin and tonic can be made by anyone but they even seemed to get that ratio wrong. Furthermore, the kiwi daiquiri that my friend ordered for his birthday was so bad that when I tried it the words ""pubic lice"" came to mind. Our waiter Jody/Jodie was somewhat attentive but not anything to write home about. Now the food...everything was entirely too salty. This is coming from a person who subscribes to the Anne Burrell mindset when it comes to seasoning with salt so I'm not afraid of salting things. The French fries I ordered with my burger (which was cooked to rare perfection) were bone cold and also doused in salt. The jalepeno peppers were a nice touch I must say. My friends filet mignon was cooked perfectly but again the seasoning was just off and way too salty. This was a common theme among everyone's dishes. You would expect for the price that these dishes would be on point but even the appetizers were uninteresting and not very well executed. I am a talented home chef and feel that I could have made all of these dishes better at home. Also, wtf is the point of giving a literal chefs knife to cut the steaks?! It was so awkward and kind of scary to see these on the table. Not to mention my friends who are trained chefs even felt weird cutting their steaks with these.Atmosphere: literally the tits McGee. Beautifully decorated and the ambiance was gorgeous. We were in the garden and my only complaint was that I wish there was a little more lighting (candles etc) on our table bc after sunset it was too dark to really see my friends.Overall I would not recommend this place. I was not impressed with the food at all and even more so unimpressed with the price tag. Service was also lackluster.

The plating was nice as well. Our entrees were short rib and salmon steak. The presentation of the short rib wasn't the best because everything looked dark; but the tasty was good--the chewy meat and lots of mushroom. Salmon steak had a crispy skin with honey, and the plating is very photogenic. For dessert, we had strawberry tart and coconut cake. Really like the cream, a bit sour with a hint of sweet. The coconut cake had four layers, as far as I tell. It maintains the moisture of the cream while serving the coconut cake. I have to say it tasted like panna cotta, my newly favorite dessert.

3.0,7/27/2014,"Sadly, another reason not to visit during Restaurant Week - no substitution (despite DB's service approachability), harried waitstaff service (can't blame them though. Imagine you've to cater to doubled amount of tables, though with the benefit of additional gratuity), and alternation with the ingredients without notice.  Today was a special occasion, to thank my mother for bringing me into this world (good or bad idea?), so I chose a venue with a menu that would offer so much varieties that it would give her a headache trying to decided between an aquatic plate or a red-blooded, rustic piece of steak.  Hance, I picked DBK because menu isn't skimped (no green salad, grilled chicken, and cheesecake), but more from their original selections.  Walking in, half the space was filled with patrons, mostly two-tops brunching and of course, in this day and age, snapping and instagraming the oversaturated dish photos.  Though I am guilty as charge as well.  After settling down with a friendly welcome from the hosts, we were led to the side sittings, ready to name our choices.  To my dismay, the online menu is different from the brunch RW menu.  Not only are my preferred choices not included, but why would not you update your website, especially if someone might have dietary restrictions?  My desired grilled chicken BLT was nowhere found, so I reluctantly settled for the kitchen burger and asked to substitute green salad instead of the fries. To my second dismay, my waiter said no substitution allowed due to the RW volume. Surely, the salad/fries aren't already plated and ready to be fired out to the diners? If I were asking for more particular requests, I would've understand, but greens over fries? Guess the chef didn't want me to keep a friendly figure then.  Luckily, the overworked waiter consulted with the chef and said my request could be granted. I appreciate that note.  Then I asked for an undressed salad, but what arrived was a dressed one.  Perhaps the manager's acute sixth sense caught my negative vibe, he immediately stopped by and amended the issue.  I commended on the managerial professionalism.  As for the edibles, the lobster dumplings were three adorable wonton wrapped dumplings with a craw as the stem to the pouch. A perfect small bite before transitioning to the grilled branzino rested on a grilled green scallions and topped with sautéed olives.  The portion was dainty and definitely fitted for a light eater.  The burger, to my disappointment, was not up to the accolade others have garnered and it's because of the bun.  English muffin should never be used for a cheffy burger.  Brioche bun, which is used in the past is the better vehicle to sandwich the iron-filled protein, not only to soak up the precious juices, but to avoid looking like a dive bar-looking meal.  The meat was larger than the carb, which makes it difficult to handle.  Thankfully, the chocolate hazelnut crunch bar concluded the meal to a good note.  The bottom crust's crunchiness contrasted with the middle layer's creamy smoothness.  The delicate white chocolate straw garnished the bar with a dark/white contrast, though sadly, the vanilla bean ice cream was too icy and exhibited more like a sorbet.  Not the best of the RW experience, but should be expected.  Still glad my mom got a flavor party in her mouth, despite my mediocre dishes.  But if she's happy, then I'm as well.",1,1,1,GarGuPi L.,"Flushing, NY",87,496,1696

2.0,7/26/2014,"Let me begin by telling you that I had a 515 reservation and I got there for dinner at 445. The host/ manager yesterday that was there told me we can sit at the bar where there was no seats for our whole party, so we sat on the side waiting area. He said he would seat us at 5. At five o'clock many other people started coming in who were then brought to there tables right away with us still waiting, did not like that I had to get up and ask again to be seated, it was like we were forgotten. Then we were seated at our table right next to the bread station  and our waiter came to greet us. He asked first if we wanted drinks and we said piña coladas. We were then told that on a Friday night at 515 that they were already out of coconut, could not make them, then we asked if we can have virgin Bahamas mamas or any other fruity drinks, again waiter said bartender said no. So we sat and drank water. The waiter then came with a plate of pickled carrots that just tasted weird, delicious breadsticks, and grapes. We saw other tables getting fresh baked popover bread, and we smelled it right at the table since we were seated there but the waiter never brought us any. Again, I had to ask for the bread. Then we order the appetizers. My daughter and I both got the market salad with goat cheese. It was served to us with Brie cheese instead. I hate Brie cheese, my daughter also, I called the waiter over and he said that the cheese was a goat-Brie cheese, I never heard of that at all and if it was it should have been stated on the menu, he brought my daughter a new appetizer, the entrees came out as we ordered the short ribs, they were just ok, the meat was not very flavorful, I think david Burke should come to my house and I will cook him a slowly braised short rib in a root beer BBQ sauce.just saying mine are so much more flavorful. It was not a very good dinner over all and I was very disappointed with the overall service from the host, manager, bartender, waiter, will not be returning, the townhouse was much better.

I couldn't get pass the thought that it looked like caterpillars as my friend pointed out but the taste was definitely good. Dessert is interesting and I wish I had tried the cheesecake bites rather than the hazelnut crunch. You're wondering why I gave it a 3 star was the service of the waitress. Everyone was amazing, we made reservation and got our seats right away. The waiters was great with the water and handling of our plates etc. It was the waitress that I could not get pass.

Interestingly enough, the ricotta jar was the winner overall. For our entrees, I had the short rib and my wife had the filet ($20 supplement).The short rib was positively out of this world. The truffle sauce was amazing. My wife's filet was well cooked and tasty but considering it was the one with the supplement, the short rib was better. One small complaint was that the filet came with a spinach puree that had no taste at all. My wife ate her steak but left the puree. Service was pleasant overall.

Reservations for 8:45 initially told that we could not be seated for over 45 minutes due to thunderstorms closing the upstairs.  Hostess was able to seat us in the bar area immediately.  We were shocked to discover as multiple other posters have that the on-line menu listed smaller supplement charges than the menu in the restaurant. We all felt that we were the victims of a bait and switch; though in the mains and app section there were still 4 good choices that did not require supplements.

2.0,7/24/2014,"Very disappointing meal. There was literally no point to me noting on my opentable reservation and calling them to confirm that this would be for my parents' anniversary so if they could make it a little special, I would much appreciate it. I was surprised that a restaurant of this caliber could fail to provide me and my family a good quality evening of dining out. The most they could do was try to reserve a cabana in the Treehouse for us, but due to the weather, this did not happen. So to start of the night, reservations were already half hour behind. We got there around 7:45pm for an 8:15pm reservation and had to wait till about 8:30pm to be even seated. An employee actually came around the bar/waiting area to serve us small bites, which was a nice compensation for the wait. I do love the rustic atmosphere and dim lighting. However, it kept getting spoiled when waiters kept repeatedly (not once, not twice, but at least five times) dropping dishes and knocking things onto the floor. At one point we were just like is this for real right now?? Our waiter, Jarred, might have been having an off day but his service was certainly not up to par. He was so hurried most of the time and did not even acknowledge our requests when we asked for more butter, lemon, etc. How was I supposed to know if he even heard?? But seriously though, WHAT WAS THE POINT of me purposely explicitly stating it's a special occasion and then having the staff fail to mention anything about it at all. Not even a ""happy anniversary!"" or anything worth noting. Thanks. The food itself was underwhelming as well...everything had a too strong lemon citrus flavor to it (ie: asparagus and shallot, mushrooms, etc.). And according to the menu, the prawn pappardelle had tomato confit / basil pesto / asparagus butter...no where in the description did it say it would taste VERY gamey. At first I thought it was just me being silly, but halfway through I was so repulsed with the taste and meal I could not even finish it. The dessert was cute, but nothing too impressive aside from the cheesecake lollipop tree for two. Chocolate hazelnut crunch was probably better than half our actual meal. For about $350 for 4 people, I would definitely say the meal was not worth it.

There was a lot of scattershot information about the menu, and only one special...which we did not order.  The second is the server recommended mushrooms that were not to the taste of anyone at the table.  I generally have an affinity for mushrooms, but these tasted like poorly cooked drunken noodles to me(translation wet dog... I don't know the chemical reaction that produces this).  Lastly, I'm in agreement about the overall level of salt in the food-- that is the Green beans were way salty as both a side to the pork and a separate side.  Otherwise I had the salmon, which was charming, though I should have taken the recommendation to go with med-rare over medium.  Also the cocktail was a great pour & the dessert was satisfying!!  I am not sure if I would come back...

The wine is ridiculously expensive.I like to have wine with my meal but everything on the menu is extremely expensive. Please, please, please add at least a few bottles in the $35-$60 range and I will be very happy. The food is not that expensive so it seems wrong that they don't offer at least some affordable wines.

4.0,6/18/2014,Came here for the winter restaurant week. You can actually order almost everything off the regular menu. The food was great. I had the pretzel crab cake ($5 supplement) my date had the angry octopus. For main I had the pork shank. OMG it was huge!!! (Yes I had to add another $10) it was worth it!!! My date had lamb chop. He loved his dish. The desserts were just ok. We had lemon pie and chocolate cake. I just didn't like my salted ice cream. We left  happily with half of the shank. We'll definitely come back again.

4.0,6/9/2014,"I can't believe it took me so long to finally eat here, but I'm glad I waited as I noticed some amazing menu changes (mostly involving peanut butter), and also was lucky enough to come after the beautiful rooftop garden seating area opened up.We entered and went downstairs into the below ground restaurant, where the hostess offered us the opportunity to sit upstairs in the garden, which we immediately agreed to given the nice summer weather.The garden is a really great space and makes the delicious food even more enjoyable. It was a great environment to really zone out and bask in the sun during the massive brunch we had:- ""Bread"" basketRather than starting you off with bread, the basket they bring has a strange combination of pickled carrots, grapes and little breadsticks. The breadsticks were actually quite good, with some type of cheesy dust/seasoning coating them, but the carrots and grapes were a bit of a strange touch.- Peanut Butter Maple Bacon Dates ($9)Speaking of grapes being a weird addition, these little balls of decadence were delicious, minus the fried grape served aside each one. Anything with peanut butter and bacon is a slam dunk, so eat the date filled and wrapped with that good stuff, and skip the crispy grape.- Chicken Dumplings ($12 for 4)These were pretty good. There was some sweetness from a light BBQ glaze on the skin, and the filling was creamy and flavorful from the jack cheese.- Brown Sugar & Cinnamon Bun ($5)- Buttermilk Biscuits ($5 for 2)It took quite a bit of restraint to only order these 2 items from the pastry basket ($18 for all 4 would save you $2), but I realized I wanted to be able to have a fighting chance at feeling hunger again sometime in the following week. Both of these were excellent choices - the biscuits were massive and pretty buttery, and the cinnamon roll was really fluffy and soft with a good amount of sweetness.- PB & J French Toast ($16)Wow. This was intense, and I really started to feel the unnecessary gluttony kicking in with this thick, ridiculously fluffy mass of French toast. It was do moist and smooth it was barely discernible as bread, but it was so delicious. Combined with a smear of the jelly below it and a smattering of the peanut butter frosting on top, it was a truly perfect bite.- Kitchen Burger ($15)This was a great burger. Topped with bacon and cheddar, the large patty had some great flavor and the bun went very well with it. The only problem was the disappointing Jalapeño and Parmesan French Fries. The majority of them were limp and soggy, covered with unmelted white cheese. It might have been an off day, but at least the burger itself was worth it.- DB's Cheesecake Lollipop Tree for 2 ($18)This gimmicky but delicious dessert is one of the signatures here. Meant for 2 people, it consists of 10 individual cake pops arranged like branches on a tree. They are beautifully decorated and come in pairs of a number of different flavors, including a red velvet one and a peanut butter and chocolate one. There is also a tub of bubble gum whipped cream on the side if you want even more sweetness with the very sweet, tasty pops. This dessert is definitely intended for young teenage girls, but I still enjoyed it very much.- Rocky Mountain Road Sundae ($12)This was ok, but nothing particularly memorable. It was a standard sundae, consisting of brown butter ice cream, brownies and their signature peanut brittle. It also had some little meringues, which I found unpleasant and not really a good fit with the rest of the flavors. I would skip this and go for the other desserts instead.The prices are typical of a celebrity chef restaurant, but the quality of the food is much better than you would expect.

Both were incredible dishes with great tastes. They were a little on the warm side and I like my food very hot so that would be my only comment on that.Now dessert is a meal all in itself. Two words.

4.0,5/14/2014,"Splurged here for dinner because my company is paying for it. So I got to try a lot of items on the menu (yay for my corporate Amex card!). To start, we ordered the crispy oysters and lobster salad. I actually thought these appetizers and the dessert were the highlights of my meal. The presentation was spot on. And the lobster was fresh, not overcooked. The oysters just melted in your mouth and they were garnished with sliced pickles & peppers that just gave them the extra oomph of flavor. For my main course, I had the short ribs. I thought the meat itself was cooked perfectly, very tender. However, I HATED the sauce and truffle foam that came with it. It was unbearably sweet (almost a BBQ sauce like flavor?) and just didn't work with the saltiness of the mushrooms and cavatelli pasta that the short ribs sat on. We also ordered 3 sides to accompany our entrees: the green beans, the mushrooms and the truffle fries. These sides were utterly forgettable and very below standard for a restaurant of this calibre. Luckily, I ended the meal on a good note with dessert. We ordered the apple tart and rhubarb pie - great flavor combinations, not too sweet and just left me wanting more. Overall, I wasn't blown away by any means but the food was solid, great cozy environment where it's not too noisy. The service was excellent.

Our waiter was calm, knowledgeable, witty, and to my camel gene's delight, never let our water glasses get more than half way empty.My girlfriend and I started off the meal with, obviously, the Peanut Butter Maple Bacon Dates. I was ready to cancel my short ribs then and there and get five more plates of the decadence that had just graced my palate, but my girlfriend loves to try new things and although I firmly believe in always getting what I know I like, she loves the thrill of branching out. I'm so glad that I held out because the short ribs with cavatelli was out of this world. The sauce was creamy, but not overbearing and the cavatelli was cooked to perfection; that medium firmness I feel only ramen shops can ever perfect. The rib melted in my mouth and paired perfectly with the Peter Michael pinot noir that the sommelier had suggested. My girlfriend got the pork chop with mango chutney, maple bacon, and onion rings. She was blown away by the pork chop, but what really made the thought of unbuttoning my pants to make more room cross my mind, were the onion rings. God have mercy! Not sure if they serve them as a side dish, but they definitely should!Last came the dessert. That point of the meal where I don't think I can fit one more bite, but I know I'll regret not having it when I get home. Well, let's just say: best choice ever.

We decided to order the pretzel crab cake because other reviews that I read were raving about it and we figured we would try it, but I wasn't blown away. It was a really good crab cake, but I was expecting something mind blowing after all the hype. However, the peanut butter maple bacon dates were mind blowingly good, I wish we ordered more. SO GOOD.

The filet was also good, but I would not say it was worth the $42...Of course we had to order dessert for the birthday boy so we decided to go with the monkey bread which our waiter highly recommended.

4.0,3/24/2014,"Came here for dinner during Restaurant Week and was very satisfied by their offerings and portions. Their RW menu is quite extensive, with 7-8 choices per course, and most were similar to their regular menu. Overall, it was a great deal for what we received for RW!! Our favorites:Pretzel crab cakes - this seems to be a yelp favorite, and it is worth getting. I was surprised by the portion sizes -- I was expecting a small round crab cake, and instead, it was a rather large brick-sized crab cake with a layer of long+skinny pretzels on top. The flavor was really memorable. They seem to give a citrusy twist to many of their dishes.Monkey bread dessert - how is it possible for monkey bread to be eaten by only 2 people?? We split it amongst the 6 of us in our party and we were really full by our 1/6 serving. The monkey bread is perfectly sweet with ice cream, creme fraiche, and drizzles of caramel/other toppings. It was really good.Other dishes:Swordfish paella - this was my main. They cooked the swordfish well and I really enjoyed the seafood, but overall the paella fell flat when it came to flavor. It didn't really make an impression on me. The portion was still quite sizable though.Cheesecake lollipop tree -  I heard from friends that this is well-known for David Burke Kitchen (was on tv at some point?) - a little gimmicky, but still enjoyable.The service was knowledgable, friendly, attentive.I would come back for the crab cakes!",1,1,1,Joyce H.,"Cleveland, OH",201,506,206

Her arrived great but mine was so salty it was impossible to eat. I returned it nicely and an other came back almost as salty. I got tired of calling my waitress (called her numerous amount of time for drinks, water and bread before that...) so I ate my salty pork chops and the rest of the plate was not good either.

4.0,3/10/2014,"I went here for NYC for RW with my best friend. The place was lively and pleasant, no overpowering music. The menu was extensive and I had a hard time choosing which to order. Finally I chose the salmon and tuna tartare, roasted lamb shoulder with fried sweetbreads, and swan sorbet. My friend ordered the grilled baby octopus, slow cooked  ribs, and passion fruit creme brûlée. The tartare was on point-nothing I could criticize...except I wanted more :P The lamb was beautifully cooked and melt in your mouth, but I wanted something more than what I expected. The sorbet was too sour for my taste. I thought the passion fruit syrup overpowered everything and I wasn't fond of the meringue cookies. My friend's octopus was grilled to perfection, his rib dish was better than mine and I wanted to eat it all. I wasn't fond of the passion fruit creme brûlée. Again, very sour and it kind of threw me off in terms of balance. The pineapple chunks were fibery and yeah...it didn't work for me.

4.0,3/10/2014,"I went to David Burke Kitchen for NYC Restaurant Week and we had a great time. I found the menu to be extensive for compared to most NYCRW restaurants and most dishes, even the seemingly higher-end dishes, did not require a supplemental charge. For my appetizer, I ordered the Pretzel Crusted Crab Cake which had a small supplemental charge but was worth every additional dollar. It does not at all resemble a typical crab cake, instead it has a crunchy pretzel topping that looks like a lattice over a crab salad. For the second course, I ordered the Short Rib with Handmade Wild Mushroom Cavatelli. The meat was so tender and juicy that no knife was required and the additional toppings were delicious in itself. For dessert, I ordered the Passion Fruit Creme Brulee and though the first couple of bites were delicious, the very tart taste from the passion fruit made it difficult to finish the dish. An added benefit is that each course was extremely generous in proportion. I almost (almost) couldn't finish the short rib because I was so full.The one caution that I would say about David Burke Kitchen is in regards to the drinks. Cocktails and glasses of wine started at $16+ which can make a bill stack up easily, even during RW. Otherwise, I would absolutely recommend the restaurant and will definitely be going back again next NYCRW.",0,0,0,KC G.,"Manhattan, NY",56,19,2

One of my favorite aspects of the restaurant are the wooden panels that traverse the entire ceiling. They give the perception of an elongated room and add a nice modernistic touch to the ambiance.Here is what I ordered:Lobster Minestrone 4/5. This was a small, but hearty appetizer. It came with two lobster dumplings (with their claws protruding out of the wonton wrap and all). The server then poured hot minestrone soup over it. The broth definitely made the dish, since the dumplings themselves were bland. While I unfortunately didn't taste much of the lobster, the combined taste of the dumplings and the minestrone was quite flavorful.Short Rib 4/5. Pretty complex dish, but I loved it because the sauce was infused with rich mushroom flavors - my favorite! The short rib itself was good, but with the mushroom cavatelli AND the truffle mousse... it just hit home for me.Passion Fruit Creme Brulee 2/5. Not what I expected at all. It lacked an overall custard taste and I felt like I was just eating a really sour passion fruit pudding. Didn't even get through half of it before calling it quits.Still, an overall positive experience. I'm interested in trying out the brunch menu in the future!",0,0,0,Celia G.,"Manhattan, NY",33,20,46

3.0,3/3/2014,"Came here for restaurant week with my group of friends, and we had a nice time. However, we're all pretty critical of our food (since we're all avid yelpers) and all of us agreed that DBK was about a 3 star. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, just not anything life changing or that made me have the ""oh god, I NEED to come back here"" feeling.So, personally, I ordered the ratatouille and ricotta jar for the appetizer, the grilled branzzino over a bed of sauteed spinach, and the blood orange sorbet. The appetizer was good, but I was expecting some more ratatouille. Basically, I got a jar filled with ricotta (really good actually, had some nice herbs in it) with a small garnish of ratatouille on top. The bread it came with was very plain--no seasonings, overly crispy in my opinion. As for the branzinno, technically, I didn't even get it because they ""ran out"" of it, so mine was swordfish instead. The fish had a nice garnish on top, however, there was only a small portion of it, so some bites of fish were bland. The spinach had an amazing taste, and was a highlight of the dish. The dessert was good: the sorbet had a fresh taste and came on top of a bed of fresh fruit, which I really enjoyed. However, those with peanut allergies beware!!! I wanted to order the chocolate hazelnut crunch dessert, but found out it had peanuts... Not only that, the next 2 things on the menu that I wanted to order ALSO had peanuts. So, that was a bummer.Basically, try DBK out if you're interested, but there's definitely better food out there. Totally worth it for restaurant week though.After trying my friends' dishes, I'd recommend the short rib for the entree--really homey dish with all the flavors really complimenting each other nicely.",0,0,0,Azinda M.,"Chicago, IL",28,289,8

Since it was a restaurant week dinner they offered a 3 -course for $38.  My starter was this ""Market Salad"", presented very nicely, however I recommend skipping out in the bacon because though delicious as a bacon lover like myself it does make the salad seem excessively salty. For my main I had the short rib, soft and tasty, though salty again!, was nothing special I must say.  The dessert I chose was the passion fruit crème brulee, delicious I must say after having so much salt in my food it helped get rid of that salty taste.  Overall I thought the FOOD was OKAY , presentation was nice though at best the service I thought felt rushed perhaps because it was restaurant week, the woman explained the food and details quicker than I can swallow what she was saying, I felt I would probably come back on a non-restaurant week to get a feel of the place, maybe it will be different.",1,0,0,Christopher B.,"Queens Village, NY",59,37,19

All three elements come atop a tomato puree.  My only complaint about this dish was that it seemed a little more on the warm side than hot when I received it, and that it's definitely on the rich side.  Lots of protein though, so, great post-workout?The staff are all really friendly and I think this is a great restaurant for any occasion  I'd like to be back to try other items. :)",0,0,0,Yifen J.,"Kyoto, Japan",320,363,167

Well...my partner and I settled in for brunch and the food wasn't amazing nor was it badjust ehhhh. We waited almost an hour for our food as well.The food portions are inconsistent; My plate was mixed up with another patron's plate who order the same thing and when it was switched my plate was considerably portioned smaller that the ""wrong"" plate I was givensteak was more than  1/2 a size smaller and eggs weren't cooked to the way I asked and were much smaller too.Being from Texas I am a steak fan and when I had the bison steak here it did not taste very fresh and was tough. Also, upon ordering I requested my steak to be cooked medium rare, but instead it was cooked well done and I couldn't even cut through it with my knife. The staff recooked my order free of charge, but the steak portion the second time around was even smaller and still tasted tough ( I am not sure if the diet of the animal is so different than that of the bison in Texas to make the meat taste so distinctively different). The eggs came out better though. The kale salad was great, but only after a few bites. There was too much lemon juice which became too overpowering and washed out the other flavors.My favorite part of my meal was only the jalapeño cheese biscuits. The rest of the meal was not memorable. Both my partner and I were disappointed as we both knew the restaurant should have been better than what we had experienced.

I didn't know what to get so I followed my server's suggestions. I'm very very satisfied.Will not make any recommendations here, go ahead and pick what you like.

I would order this again in a heartbeat.Matt for the short rib and claimed that if he had to choose a last meal, that would be it. Needless to say he loved it.The dessert that we ordered isn't listed on the normal dessert menu. It was drawn and explained under the drink section on the dessert menu and was called the hazelnut crunch bar. I don't remember exactly how they described it, but I believe it was a coconut cake on the bottom with a chocolate hazelnut mousse on top of that (it had actual hazelnut pieces in it), covered with chocolate ganache and toasted coconut, and then there was some blueberry thing spread on the plate. It came with vanilla gelato, too. It was very, very good.I was extremely pleased with my dining experience at David Burke Kitchen and it might be one of the best restaurants I've been to.",0,0,0,Tricia S.,"Bronx, NY",24,103,119

5.0,1/12/2014,"I've been to DB Kitchen twice now, and had such wonderful service and food both times. Last time we came on a Sunday night and got quite the array, and loved everything. Here's what we got:Bacon and Eggs: gorgeous. the bite is delicious, familiar yet unique. comes in a really fun egg carton -- super coolEscargot Fritters: surprisingly good. Someone else at the table wanted to order them, and, I wasn't looking forward to a deep fried version. I was pleasantly surprised when it had the consistency of a meatball, I couldn't even really tell it was fried. The sauce was so creamy and delicious.Kale salad: love this. I could eat this salad everyday.  such a cool combination of ingredients (pickled cashews?) that all magically work together.Raviolo: delicious. warm, cozy, really tasty. Elk Carpaccio: This was really tasty, similar to other carpaccios I've gotten. Cauliflower steak: I want to eat this all the time. It was the best thing at the table. The farrotto was so great, some of it the texture of iraeli couscous, some of a puffy, nutty al dente risotto.  It was wonderful. The broccoli ""bone marrow"" was so fun and smart. I'm not a vegetarian but am truly obsessed with this dinner.The short rib and lamb, both of which were ordered by other parties at the table were both verrrrrrrry good, the lamb I swear tasted like it had parmesan, and the truffle creme fresh on the short rib made every bite soooooooo rich. I loved that it slowly melted into the rest of the dish. These were awesome. I kept almost wishing I had gotten those, but then I would have another bite of mine and be really happy I got the cauliflower.I would go here again in a heartbeat.

4.0,1/11/2014,"Came with my husband for my birthday dinner on a super rainy saturday.  Maybe because it was raining heavily whole day, when we arrived at the restaurant and the whole night there were maybe only 4 other tables occupied in the restaurant.  I actually liked it being so quiet as no one sat next to us and we received excellent service!For starters, we ordered the pretzel crab cake and the potted foie gras to share.  They separated the crab cake into two seperate servings for us without us asking which is a major plus in my book!! The crab cake was very delicious and the pretzel sticks definitely gave it a nice crunch, however I was hoping for more pretzel flavor which I did not get.  The foie gras was very rich as well and came in a cute jar.  they even gave us extra bread for the foie, again without us asking them to (another major plus!!)For entree I ordered the short rib which was divine! The meat was so soft I did not need the knife at all.  I especially love the pasta and mushroom that came with the dish, it was so good I cleaned the whole plate! My husband ordered the seabass which was cooked perfectly as well but not outstanding.For dessert, everything on the menu including the special (pumpkin icecream pie) sounded so delicious, but I really wanted to try the famous cheesecake lollipop tree.  For $18 you get 10 cheesecake lollipop, all very tasty but i think its more for the presentation and more to say that I have tried it.  I probably will order something else next time.Service was very good, the servers came to check on us many times, they never left our water unfilled and they did not pressure us to order alcohol like so many fine dining places do.  I dont know if the service was so great for us becos of the slow rainy night though since it seems like many yelpers got bad service from their experience....

2.0,1/10/2014,"One star for my waitress, whose name I did not know, but was nice enough anyway and really accommodated me.Came in on a Monday 12:45 lunch with my friend. I explained to the host (who turned out to be a manager or supervisor) that I was going to have an unconventional lunch situation. I was going to have a friend who could only start until 1:45 and then he would leave to catch a bus and I would have another business lunch with somebody arriving at 2 pm. I would pay for the 3 pre fixe lunches. It was like business speed dating with 2 people. I waited at the bar after coming in on time for my reservation. I requested to be seated soy that I can order for myself and my friend. The host/manager said yes. More time passed, and I see him seat 3 sets of people ahead of me. He ignores me, of course. And I look longingly at the handful of tables that were empty. I wanted to munch on something. I went up with my friend and asked, ""may we be seated now?"" I saw your glare there buddy.When my friend and I were finally seated, 10 minutes for water, 10 minutes for someone to come over to give us the menu. The people at table next to us weren't happy either. Their take was empty, no appetizers, and they were there before I even got to the restaurant (I know because I watched everybody who came in before me, and they were already seated).  I saw that he got his appetizer after 10 minutes, and she got hers 5 minutes after that.Meanwhile, my friend and I were waiting another ten minutes for somebody to take our orders. (Note, 10 for water, 10 for menu, 10 for orders: 30 minutes). I asked for my friend's food to be wrapped up. We see the manager/host come over when the table next to us complained. He says that their food will be out soon and runs away. The woman at the table days, ""That's it? Not even an apology?"" Later on he does apologize, saying that a wedding party unexpectedly showed up, clogging their kitchen.It did clear out by the time my second lunch person arrived. But our first server disappeared and someone else took over.The only thing I'm taking away from this place is that our first server was at least nice and accommodating. I understand they were understaffed and I observed her handling things well. Our second server was pleasant and fixed a mistake on the check without a glare.I give those two ladies props.

1.0,12/29/2013,"Where do I begin? It has been about 2 months to let me cool off and rethink about my trip to the East Coast and this Kitchen still is the 'black eye' of the trip! Thus, I need to give this place a review for the customer service blunder that occurred. My friends and I were by the World Trade and decided to yelp around for a nice restaurant none of us have tried and so we called in for a reservation for 5. We were told to be there 8:15pm sharp. So we arrived right at 8:15pm and were told to go upstairs to the David Burke Garden and Treehouse Bar, which actually looks like a cool New York rooftop bar/restaurant. But we were told to wait and or have a drink at the bar while our table becomes available - so much for being there at 8:15 sharp. After sitting for 10 to 20 minutes we began to look over at the host and make the face of 'is our table ready yet?' to which we continued to sit. Then 30 minutes or so passed and we asked what is going on and we were told several tables have paid, but have not left. So we were basically waiting for people to stop talking. At this point, we figured that something has to open up and since we were all really hungry we need to hang in there and see what the 4 stars out of 500ish something reviews is about. 20 more maddening minutes go by and we see them (the staff) begin to assemble a new table from smaller tables that had just been sitting by the bar unused! And we found out that they were making a larger table for a larger incoming group - I was pissed! Should have left sooner, but - FINALLY- a table became available and we were seated and told that one round of drinks is on the house for the near hour long wait.THEN THE NOSE DIVE. We begin to get waited on and what happens? It starts to rain! Rain starts to hit our food and we go for cover. The waiter directs us downstairs, to which there are some open tables (that must have somehow magically freed up) and we were then transitioned to a new set of waiters and from here on out the crash and burn of the David Burke Kitchen Experience continued - I could continue on into much further detail but let me wrap it up. It sucked - the new waiters downstairs would go on to not have our orders exactly correct, our round of free drinks were forgotten from upstairs, our dessert became an issue on the bill to which one of the waiters asked if we even read the menu!

4.0,12/28/2013,"Went here the other day for the first time and was pleased and would go back (had been wanting to try a David Burke nameplate restaurant for awhile).  My real score is somewhere between 3 & 4 stars.  I thought the service was very good (better than similar-type restaurants in the city).  I was there for lunch at 12:30 on a weekday.  The dining room filled up while I was there.  My server, Zach, was nice, efficient, and there at all the right times.I did the prix fixe $25 3-course lunch which I think is a huge value.  It was well-worth the money.  I did notice that portion sizes amongst the various dishes were very different.  Entrees had by those seated next to me seemed huge.  Mine was a more reasonable size.  If portion size is a thing for you, you might be more pleased with certain menu items.I had the wedge salad for a first course which was delicious and a large portion for a salad.  I realized when I began that it was a bad choice considering some dental work that I have in progress, so I couldn't devour it as I wished.  The beet salad at an adjacent table also looked tasty (buyer's remorse).  The lobster dumpling soup also looked good but the person nearby having it commented that it was salty.I had the grilled salmon on quinoa for my entree.  Fish was beautifully cooked.  The quinoa was also nicely cooked, but seemed a little ""greasy"" perhaps from the marinade of the salmon (the salmon was sitting on top of the quinoa).  I asked for lemon as the dish seemed to need a little bit of acid.  Overall, though, I enjoyed it.For dessert I had the molten red velvet cake.  Yum, delish.  I am not a dessert person, but I ate almost every bite.  It came with a scoop of sorbet, as well.As stated, service was very good.  Only negs were that the table had a some crumbs when I sat down, which was cleaned upon my request, and also for some reason I never got the little bucket of breadsticks, grapes, and carrots.  I didn't point it out, though, as I had plenty to eat and was in the midst of my salad already when I noticed other tables had it.Overall, a good experience.  I will return but will shoot for summer to try the roof deck.",0,0,0,Tara S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,33,0
3.0,12/27/2013,"Food was good, but we almost walked out more than once.  Let me explain.  BACKGROUND: We had family visiting over the holidays & we wanted to take them to a nice restaurant.  This isn't something we do often because 1) we can't really afford it and 2) they visit us once a year.  In lieu of exchanging gifts this year for the holidays, we agreed months in advance we would see a Broadway show and treat each other to dinner after.  We had the pick of any restaurant in Manhattan & we chose to go here - in part due to DB's participation on Top Chef Masters.  We wanted to be sure we could nail something in the 'prix fixe' category.  Their menu online listed that a $45 prix fixe was available until 5pm.  We were seeing a matinee in Midtown that ended at 4:15pm, so we made a reservation for 4:45pm.  We called twice to make sure we would qualify for the prix fixe rate as the time was so close to dinner.  They assured us both times that it would not be an issue.  We confirmed the reservation & everything was all set.Before continuing, I feel it is important to note that we are a quiet bunch.  We don't speak up much.  If we order something and it comes to the table wrong, we deal with it, we eat it anyway, or put unwanted items to the side.  We're not picky and we're generally happy with all places we frequent.Fast forward to our reservation.  We bolt downtown after our show to frantically run into the restaurant precisely at our reservation time.We find the restaurant and there are literally 6 people dining.  Ok.  It's a weird time of day... too late for lunch, too early for dinner.  No problem.ERROR #1.  We waited by the door at the host stand where there was no one to greet us.  We had numerous servers walk by us and say nothing.  No one told us someone would be 'right with you'.  We thought maybe they weren't serving at this hour.  The only thing that kept us there was the fact we had a confirmed reservation.  ERROR #2.  After nearly 10 minutes of waiting, a woman came to the stand and said hello.  (No apology, no ""thanks for waiting"", nothing at all.)  I gave her our name and time of reservation.ERROR #3.  They didn't have our reservation.  How do you call once to make a reservation, call again to confirm said reservation, and then not have the reservation when we arrive??  Starting to get a bad feeling about our decision to attend DBK.  ERROR #4.  We are seated by a man that turned out to be our server.  He takes us to the table and seats us.  No pleasantries, no hospitality.  Simply drops off the menus and walks away.  Again, we felt weird about that.ERROR #5. While perusing the menu, there is a prix fixe lunch option for $25 -- not the $45 we researched off their website.  Ok, no big deal.ERROR #6.  Here's where things get dicey.  I asked the server how the prix fixe worked.  He smiled and said ""You have the wrong menus"", took our menus from us and while doing so I inquired, ""We were told there was a prix fixe option"" and simply smirked pejoratively with a chuckle and said ""No.""  Now we're really confused and starting to have a bad time - which says a lot if you know us.  At this point, I feel extremely embarrassed about the discomfort my family and I are feeling as what was supposed to be a nice afternoon/evening out at a ""nice restaurant"" is turning sour.  He comes back with the dinner menu and I politely inquire again that we were told that we could get the prix fixe menu and we had reservations.ERROR #7.  The server starts sending a serious confrontational vibe (while appearing to mentally calculate his tip) and tells me that he will send over the manager to speak with us.  Never in my life have I pondered getting up and leaving a restaurant after being seated, but this was our breaking point.  A customer should never ""feel bad"" for attending your establishment.  This is where the story changes.The manager, Dan, comes by and we explain to him what we were told on the phone and he says he would be happy to accommodate us as long as the kitchen is still prepared to serve us the prix fixe menu.  He returns with the original menu and apologizes.Thankfully, a new server comes in to rescue our awkward situation.  He was truly a delight.  He joked with us, made us laugh, and made us feel good about a situation that could have been awful.  To our server ZACH, you truly saved our day.  Thank you so much for your attentive service and pleasant attitude.Sadly, this review has almost nothing to do with the food, which was good.  (The pudding was amazing.)Thank you Dan and thank you Zach.  No thanks to you, non-introduced boorish antagonizing server guy... thought you should know you missed out on Zach's 40% tip.",0,0,0,Captain O.,"East Brunswick, NJ",0,18,3

From the outset, the service was fantastic. Not only were friendly, attentive folk there to indulge my every whim (and I am a man of many whims), but when we mentioned that we'd be sharing everything, they thoughtfully split all our dishes onto separate plates, thereby eliminating the series of spills I normally cause. This left us with nothing to do but enjoy the food they brought us. For starters, I like a twist on the standard bread basket, and their jar of pickled carrots, breadsticks, and grapes was a novel, less-filling approach. From then on, it was nothing less than a stellar meal. We indulged in the lobster dumpling soup, a ravioli special that was decadently rich, the pretzel crab cake with the red pepper marmalade, and the standout shortrib that was lusciously tender and perfectly hearty. Shockingly enough, my least favorite item was probably the peanut butter maple bacon dates, if only because grapes are evidently the one thing that should not be fried.

2.0,11/21/2013,"First of all, I am not happy with the ambience of the place.  It seemed like there were tables scattered willy nilly, almost like a cafeteria.  Maybe it was just too lively?  I suppose I expected a more intimate experience.I was also so close to the person next to me, that we started a conversation with them!  This was supposed to be a dinner for two, not four!!!!  Anyway, I was with a friend who I imagined had been there before, so I told him to order since I really didn't have a preference for what we started with.  He ordered the Peanut Butter Maple Bacon Dates and the potted fois grais.  Both were mistakes.The PB Dates were wayyyyy too sweet.  Dates are inherently sweet.  PB is sweet.  Maple is sweet.  The sweetness and the similar textures (the bacon wasn't super crispy, so it was creamy peanut butter, creamy dates, and rubbery bacon) was not appetizing taste wise or texture wise to the mouth.  The Fois Grais was also sweet.  It was just too sweet altogether to begin a meal.  Definitely did not set me up for the main.For the main, I ordered the scallops.   The good news is that these scallops were nice and big, and I received a good portion of them.  The bad news is that they were RAW in the middle.  Sushi grade raw.  And both sides were unevenly seared.  Gordan Ramsey would have taken that dish back and thrown it at someone.For the price point, I just expected a better experience.  Everything was so expensive, and yet, the food didn't really prove why it should be that expensive.  I would rather have taken money spent and went somewhere else...or, at least buy more booze.",0,0,0,Ashley A.,"Manhattan, NY",155,10,0

4.0,9/26/2013,"After reading a lot of these reviews, I decided to try out DBK with a friend for dinner. We chose a Wednesday night, figuring we would get an early dinner around 6:30. Seating was easy - I would say even upon leaving the restaurant was 1/3 full, so I don't think getting a table (for a local) is really that difficult. I used OpenTable and making a reservation was simple.We sat inside, which was pleasant enough. Since we had a barely full restaurant, it was easy to chat and enjoy ourselves. Good place for a date.We tried the peanut butter maple bacon dates. You get 4 of these appetizers and worth sharing between two people. Dates covered in peanut butter & wrapped in bacon with maple fused in. Yeah, loved that.Charred Octopus. Stop. Really. Octopus?! Now for the non-adventurous they would be freaked out by this but I want to stop you and say - get it. First, the consistency & mouth-feel is that of sausage, and the seasoning is a bit spicy almost cajun like, with fava beans and lemon drizzle - really tasty. Isn't dining out about trying NEW things? This is something you should try and I was glad I did.I had the ""special"" for Wednesday nights which was the pork shank. Deep fried and served with a super sharp cleaver-style knife, and you really have to fight the shank to get into the meat and past the fat. I wasn't a fan. The meat was tender - but when you are out with someone you don't want to be grappling with your food. It was very awkward and I only ate half of it.Otherwise, I felt the wine lists by the glass were very tasty and even went so far to write down what they served us so I could buy a bottle for my next party. The service was very friendly, very helpful and quick (again, small crowd on a Wednesday night probably helped this). I did read others complaints about service, but our waiter was very good.I kind of wish Yelp had a 1/2 star rating because i'd give it 3.5 stars. I bumped it up to 4 stars because even if I didn't like my entree - that shouldn't take away from a very good restaurant which is worth trying again. Then again, you never have a second chance to make a good first impression - and I was underwhelmed by my main course which will always stick out in my mind if I were to think about going back here. I found the price was ""reasonable"" for New York. Its hard to compare prices anywhere outside of New York City, but for our total cost for food, drinks, apps, entrees, tax - it came out to $100 per person. $100 per person sounds like a lot - and it is - but for New York City...that's about what you expect when coming to higher end restaurants where you can splurge like this every once in a while.",0,0,0,Sean I.,"Hoboken, NJ",156,88,5

2.0,9/22/2013,"Not sure how to review this place.  I thought the food was really good, high quality, well prepared and nice portion sized.  However, the service was pretty poor for this caliber of a restaurant, the waitress we had has no business being a waitress.  She had no understanding of the menu, and when we had a few questions, she either tried to encourage us to order something else or said it's good, I've tried it.  When we started to order the cheese board and asked what the different cheeses were like, she said the portions are really small.  We then realized that she just didn't know what they were like and wasn't able to go ask someone who did.  We ordered it anyway and portions weren't small, and honestly I think they were larger than many similar restaurants.  There are a lot of places to get good food in NYC, but I find the reason that I choose a restaurant like David Burke is because you normally receive a higher caliber of service.  We did not receive that on this trip.  The food and the ambiance of the restaurant are nice.  For our meal, we started with the cheese board, and followed that with the beet salad.  The salad was good, nothing I'd have to order again.  Then as we were finishing our salad, a server came over with two larger plates, he was about to just throw them on our table, when someone saw him and said let's get them some clean plates.  They quickly cleaned our barely finished salad plates and put something in front of us.  I looked to the server, expecting an explanation, I assumed this was a compliment of the chef tasting which is normally explained as it is served.  He just looked at me funny and walked away.  We started to try it and realized it was crab cakes, and they were pretty large.  Then the man came back over with a soup, I stopped him this time and said we didn't order it.  The table next to us then leaned over and said, I think that was what we ordered.  It was slightly embarrassing and the wait staff acted as if the mix up was our fault.  Anyway, we had a free order of the crab cakes, which were good, a lot of crab, not lump crab, but still good.  For entrees, I had the short rib and my boyfriend had the surf and turf.  Both were very good and large portions that we took a lot of the short rib home.  The surf and turf had 2 lobster claws and tail, completely pulled off the shell.  For dessert, we shared the red velvet molten cake.  It was very rich and delicious.I almost forgot about his, when our check came, the waitress had charged us a $2 sharing fee. We did share all of our dishes because that is how we like to eat but we ordered 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and a dessert. It was only $2 but really? As I already mentioned our waitress was pretty bad so I'm not sure if this was her mistake or just their policy. Will I go back?  Probably not, we live close enough that it would be a nice place to enjoy returning to.  We enjoyed our meal.  The service was so bad enough it was almost comical, I just have higher expectations in a place like this, and living in manhattan there are plenty of good choices for quality food.",1,0,0,Jesse R.,"Cincinnati, OH",48,74,0

3.0,9/9/2013,"I came here last Saturday night with some girlfriends for dinner around 7:30. The restaurant was nearly empty, and quiet. We ordered some drinks to start: berry sangria, which was tasty but had a strange minty aftertaste. Maybe from the soda in it? It didn't taste like regular sangria, but was still good. Then we ordered the pretzel crabcake appetizer to share, which was absolutely delicious, and a good portion size. We each ordered another appetizer - I got the market salad, which was very large (could have been a meal) and fresh. Up until this point in the meal, I was very happy with both the food and service. Once our entrees arrived, everything got messed up. Three of us ordered the special pasta - a spinach raviolo in a tomato sauce; one of us ordered the burratta appetizer as an entree. Everything came out at once, and as I cut into my pasta, the spinach was completely frozen, and the raviolo was warm. I asked the waiter and he immediately said something was wrong, and took away our three dishes so they could be made again. He was very nice and apologetic, and the manager also came over to apologize. But then the server and the manager each sent over an appetizer while we waited - one fois gras and one riccota spread. None of us eat fois gras, and had to send it back. When our raviolo was finally cooked (or more likely, defrosted completely), our fourth friend had finished her meal. The solution? The kitchen sent out another whole burratta for her to enjoy while we ate. Thoughtful, but after the initial appetizers and the backup ones, we didn't want it. She ended up taking it to go. Then the check came and nothing was taken off. Mind you, we didn't want anything taken off but we also would have preferred a sincere apology instead of a flood of food we didn't want to eat. All we wanted was our entrees served on time, and cooked correctly.

So, I met a group of friends for a birthday dinner and I sat at the Treetop Bar for a drink while I waited for everyone to arrive. The bartender was super sweet and friendly, great service, etc. Easy enough, it was only me and one other couple watching pre-season Giants at the bar. Once my friends arrived and we were all seated at our table, the waiter stopped over to say hello and ask if we wanted to start with something to drink. There was not a cocktail menu on our table so we asked to see one. He said he would be right back but 10 minutes later we were hoping he was going to come back with the Dead Sea Scrolls of cocktail menus. When he finally arrived he left us with the menus and disappeared for another 10 minutes. We ordered our cocktails and decided to order our entree at the same time figuring our server was busy and to try and give him a break. Welp. Big mistake. We received our entrees before we ever received our drinks. Finally a manager came over and asked if everything was okay. We let him know we still hadn't received the drinks we ordered 20 minutes ago and had now received our entrees. He never apologized, just said ""I'll go get those for you"" and drifted into the sunset never to be seen again. About 5 minutes later the server arrived with our drinks and apologized for the delay. The next time we saw our waiter, he dropped off the check. Yikes. I ordered the Brick Chicken. It arrived served on a bed of broccoli rabe and tomatoes. The broccoli rabe was probably the best I've ever tasted. The chicken was as dry as a 2x4 of beef jerky. My $30 chicken was dry. ::cricket::cricket:::I understand servers get busy, I really do.

3.0,8/27/2013,"Came here for dinner during restaurant week. Had a very high hope for this place given David Burke's celebrity chef fame. The restaurant's location in South Village is not convenient located, it's basically next to the tunnel where everyone's trying to go back to Jersey..so getting here in a cab would be a pain in the ass during rush hour.The decor + ambiance were really cool. The outdoor seating upstairs with a full bar and the dining room down stairs give you two completely different feeling. It's definitely got a soho design to it and very appealing to young folks.Lobster dumpling soup - sounds very tasty right? it's basically 2 small wontons in a soy broth.Pretzel crab cake - this is one of the famous apptizers; not bad, would suggest ordering but I didn't see or taste anything special...why would pretzel pair well with crab cake anyways?Lamb chops - this is a good dish, if you like lamb, order itShort ribs and macaroni - again, sounds interesting, but didn't taste anything specialJalepeno fries - we ordered this side again because of the name...very high hope to it...wasn't bad but after 2-3 fries you probably wish you hadn't order it...What pissed me of the most was their wine by the glass....I think the standard pour is 6 glasses/bottle.....I am so sure that the pour here is more like 8-9 glasses/bottle....and it's just so not right to rip off customers this way....I would not return to this place again...",2,1,1,Osman J.,"Manhattan, NY",171,258,601
2.0,8/25/2013,"I would love to give David Burke Kitchen 5 stars because most of the food was delicious and the service was good. However, I went primarily for the Porterhouse for Two, as that is my signature entree that I fell in love with at Prime 112 in South Beach - a place where the Porterhouse is ALWAYS outstanding, I've had it countless times over the last 10 years (so if you're ever there, get the Porterhouse, and your standards for meat WILL CHANGE FOREVER). I knew my expectations would be high as a result, but I figured if it was on the Burke menu (and it is even highlighted on the menu as a separate entree from the others), I thought it should be at least EDIBLE. I asked for the temperature to be Medium-Rare, and I SPECIFICALLY told our waiter, ""but NOT PURPLE."" This is how I order it at Prime 112, as the Chef understands WHAT THAT MEANS. When the Porterhouse arrived, they had a lovely carving table on which they placed our meat to cut in front of us, so I was hopeful at that, but once I saw HOW the manager was cutting it, I knew my meal was going to be a disaster. He looked like he was trying to carve a TURKEY! He didn't cut along the grain of the meat, the pieces were all different sizes, omg, I was really disappointed. Even HE GAVE UP at cutting the whole thing, and just left one big chunk uncut. The presentation was terrible as well, since the pieces were all different sizes, and then they put the bone sitting UPWARDS on my friend's plate, which neither one of us could figure out WHY they would do that, it was not appealing AT ALL. Long story short, the Porterhouse at Burke's was completely RARE despite ordering it Medium-Rare, it was PURPLE throughout, and even my friend, who likes meat rare, felt it was a far cry from Medium-Rare, almost appearing SEARED. The meat was tough, chewy, and nothing like what one would expect from a $110 dollar piece of meat. Even the waiter looked apologetic and basically forced me to have some of the slices taken back to the kitchen to be ""recooked."" I protested by saying that that NEVER WORKS WITH PORTERHOUSE, because you cannot just slap it into a frying pan with some butter and expect to get the mouth-watering, cut-like-butter results. Needless to say, he took my few pieces to be recooked, and it came back even more DISGUSTING, which I already knew would happen so that made it even worse for me. The waiter then proceeded to ""explain"" that the Porterhouse is a ""thick cut of meat,"" and it can be ""HARD TO COOK."" I almost fell off my chair when he said that, but I kept my mouth shut, including when I tried to eat the meat because it was truly AWFUL. I never write reviews and I should have spoken to the Chef myself, because he/she obviously doesn't know how to cook Porterhouse, and therefore it should NOT BE ON THE MENU. Everything else, from the Pretzel Crab Cakes to the Jalepeno fries to the sautéed mushrooms was delish, but it was disappointing to have to fill myself on SIDE DISHES at a restaurant that is supposed to be 5 star.",0,0,0,Jasmine B.,"New York, NY",2,2,9

The host does try to space diners out according where you are in the meal, for example, if you were having dessert, they would seat the other table next to you and try to pace seating accordingly.

Strike #2 which the steak was overcooked.  We wanted medium rare. Sure their other dishes were good - mom loved her lobster dumping soup.  The roasted mushroom side and the fries were very well done.  But their softshell crab ""quesadilla"" was unremarkable and mom and aunt didn't even bother commenting on their lobster entrees.  Best part of our meal was the Frozen Arnold Palmer.Service was ok though almost non-existent had it not been for our waters being occasionally refilled.  They cut off our bread basket at #2 even when we asked for more.  I hate to be so harsh but this meal really did evoke strong feelings!!",3,3,2,Tammy L.,"Lake Forest, CA",371,1038,1035

It was cooked perfectly with great veggies accompanying it. Definitely would go again. I had a chocolate caramel tart with a raspberry sorbet.

1.0,8/20/2013,"With Restaurant Week 2013 quickly winding down, I thought I'd check out one of David Burke's restaurants downtown.  Based on the rave reviews, I chose David Burke Kitchen - This was a huge mistake.  Upon entering the restaurant we turned to go into the bar area and was immediately told that it was ""reserved for a private party.""  Luckily our table was ready, even though we were a bit early.  Everything about our meal turned out to be a big disappointment.  For a four-guest table, the service was horrendous.  We had to ask 3 different staff members for forks when the entrees came out - only one server found us 4 forks.  The drink refills were always slow and needed tremendous prompting.  At one point in the meal one of my party members slid a plate to the edge of the table, so that the server could reach the plate without putting his arm right in my face.  The server rudely waved away the effort and instead grabbed across the table for plates that he obviously could not reach.  The food here was definitely not worth the prices, even for Restaurant Week:AppetizersSimple Salad - Nothing to write home about.Tuna Tartare - Nice presentation and descent tasteAsparagus & Burrata Salad - Smooth cheese, but mediocre tasteEntreesBrick Chicken - Dry and unappetizing (don't over cook your chicken breast!)Short Rib - Cooked well and melted in your mouth, but lacked flavor/creativityPan-Seared Salmon - Cooked well with more flavor than the other dishesDesserts  (VERY disappointing)Passion Fruit Pie - Soft and creamy, as it should be (this is a safe bet)Frozen Arnold Palmer - Overly sour without much sweetCaramel and Chocolate Tart - Two of us ordered these and they were rock-hard.  I almost had to ask for a steak knife.  The cold, dense taste of the chocolate was also a disappointment.  On a good note, the food presentation was lovely, and the ambiance of this restaurant is wonderful with views of lower Manhattan and comfortable seating.  However, there are SIGNIFICANTLY better places to eat in this neighborhood.",0,0,0,Christina S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,12,0

As it was a warm nite, we elected to eat in the outdoor dining space which resembled a private garden patio with the city landscape up above- a nice setting for a meal...and like many other yelpers, i could not resist ordering the signature appetizer: the crab cake lined with thin pretzel sticks...that combination, should i say, with the outer crispness contrasted with the tender crab meat was divine.

4.0,8/18/2013,"I had a choice: ascend or descend. It was a bit early to be so optimistic, so I took the right hand staircase that lead me down further into the fire. I ignored hostess and walked to the bar. Wicker seats greeted me with indifference as I situated myself opposite a window. A moment later a green-eyed belle came over and asked what I wanted. I asked for two fingers of Bulleit.I glanced at my watch. 1:45. I was early. I like to arrive early. It lets me take in the scene. Never arrive late; that's how you people surprise you, and in my line of work it's never good to be surprised.I looked around. The square dining room was filled with two types: artists and businessmen. It looked to me like the usual crowd for a Tuesday. Pictures of chefs in their proper uniforms doing chef-ly things lined the walls.  One held a string of lobsters ready to be boiled. Another had just set up his mise en place. The patrons chatted about their vapid lives in their trendy clothing amongst their bored waiters.I finished off my second tumbler just as Elizabeth arrived. This dame has got me under her thumb. We've rarely spoken for extended periods of time. I can't remember the last we met for a meal.""How's it going, doll?"" I said as I gave her a kiss and pulled her in close.She pulled away and playfully tapped my cheek with her cool hands. Her hands always were cold. We followed the hostess to our seats and Elizabeth told me how she liked the center column and the bus station. We were seated in the left-hand corner of the restaurant, an ideal spot as we can see everyone. We parsed the menus and settled on a bottle of wine right as the bearded waiter arrived.I ordered a bottle of wine and he whisked himself away, seemingly happy that we're not the type to order wine by the glass.Elizabeth coyly eyed me. I turned from my menu to her. She looked good. Form fitting black dress and a pair of ruby-red heels. Her hair fell like fall foliage and her dark, wire framed glasses made me think of my past infatuation with librarians. Her eyes shined through the rims, and I avoided gazing too deeply for fear of falling for her. We've always worked best on physical terms, not emotional.The waiter returned, bottle in tow. Elizabeth smiled at him warmly. Girl knew how to pour on the charm, that's for sure. As he served, I went through the motions and upheld that sacred tasting ritual that seemed important to some but meaningless to others.""The wine is perfect. Thanks.""He placed the bottle in a bucket and asked if we were ready to order. Elizabeth nodded slowly and nudged my knee. I took the hint. ""I'll go first. Let me have the duo of lobster and beef followed by the prosciutto pizzette.""""I'd like the lobster bisque and a mozzarella pizette,"" Elizabeth said. She touched my knee under the table. After the waiter left, I sipped some wine. ""So, what's been goin' on darlin?"" I asked.""Work is work. Life is life. The days continue on."" She waved her hand demurely while reciting that last part.She scanned the room. I followed her gaze. She was fixated on another couple sitting diagonal to us. Maybe she knew them. Who knows? All I know is that our appetizers arrived. Tiny claws protruded from the dumplings, tempting me to pick them up and drop them into my mouth. I resisted and settled on using the civilized utensils provided.First up, the lobster. Sitting in some kind of reinvented tartare sauce that tinged with spice, the first taste was like kissing a broad after going at it, simultaneously intimate and purposeful. The second bite was familiar and comforting, the third routine but nevertheless exciting. All in all, a damn good choice to start the meal. The tone was set, my expectations met.Elizabeth, meanwhile, carefully transported her soup to her mouth. Each sip, savored. Each tidbit of lobster, tasted. Appreciated. She sat upright and still in a somewhat sensual pose. I could tell she was enjoying it; we barely spoke.The waiter came over and nodded. I gave him a look to communicate the quality of the experience. He smiled back, knowingly. This wasn't a secret to him, he knew how good David Burke was.Our plates were cleared away and we were granted a reprieve; we drank to it. The place was clearing out, leaving Elizabeth and I as the solitary pair amongst the the bare banquette. The entrees arrived and, perhaps unsurprisingly, they were unremarkable. Dessert made up for it. Elizabeth ordered a deconstructed lemonade and I had a traditional chocolate tort. We tasted and traded until the I paid the tab. Elizabeth and I got up and ascended the stairs and I opened the door. Elizabeth stepped out, locked her arm in mine, and we proceeded down the street towards another set of stairs that led us into a tunnel filled with a misty humidity and slender silver bullets - that unwillingly transported us across the borough, under the bridge, and toward my apartment in Brooklyn.Should you go to David Burke Kitchen?Yes, but skip the comfort food",1,2,1,Jack T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0

It's a bit hard to spot with only a tiny overhead sign and an electronic menu against the outer facade to let you know you've arrived. Luckily, it was daylight out.Good stuff:Charismatic host. Seated immediately. Animated waiter with full knowledge of menu and thorough presentation. Full menu available during restaurant week (but lots of ""supplemental"" charges...as in, like, 1/3 of the items have upgrade fees). Innovative crab cake appetizer with pretzel sticks and honey mustard on top, which was perfectly prepared and tasty. Delicious cheesecake lollipop tree dessert for two with milky whipped cream dipping. Fast service and food comes before you know it. Decor is hip and eye pleasing. Food industry prints on walls, artsy decor, comfortable seats. Treehouse garden and bar upstairs in outdoor area.Bad stuff:Music playing during meal was too loud. Soda was $4 with no refill - you kind of expect it to be way overpriced, but they keep offering refills without telling you that you're being charged. First entree I ordered, the mustard crusted tuna, was not a filet but rather a set of 4 small sushi rolls. Requested medium well cooked; fish was totally raw in middle. Shrimp rolls that came with it were 75% vegetable. Sent it back, asked for brick chicken. It was basically no frills baked chicken with overcooked broccoli rabe in a weird teriyaki like sauce not described on menu. Honestly, the best about my entree was the wild mushrooms with shallots that I ordered on the side which were not a part of the meal.Short rib that girlfriend ordered was pleasing, but accompanied by a mediocre mac and cheese lacking flavor and sharpness. So my experience was a mixed bag. For the $120 we spent, we could have done WAY better. I have to judge a place like DB Kitchen harsher than a regular eatery due to the cost and reputation for quality.I don't think I would go back, but might be willing to try a different DB establishment.

5.0,8/16/2013,"I have been meaning review this gem for almost two years now I tell you this is one of the perks of living in NYC. Beyond the usually stunning model laden crowd,  beyond the obviously delicious food,  DB Kitchen is as good as it's going to get!. My love affair with this place  started when I went there for restaurant week.. The delight began when their restaurant week menu was essentially the same as their regular dining menu, in short it was pretty extensive for next to no money comparatively speaking. As you know not all restaurants provide their full menu during this week. Some just kind of pare down the menu to a few items and call it a day, not David Burke's.  I could wax on about ow great the food is; the Pretzel crusted Crab cake app, the Exquisite Skuna bay Salmon, the Dorade, the grilled Branzino (I'm not a steak guy but I've heard its fantastic there) point being the food is fantastic, it's David Burke you should expect nothing less. It's always fantastic tasting stuff, the biggest plus for me has been the service. Let's start with going many places for restaurant week you can be treated like a plebe. Some places have this slight attitude about people who dine with them then, I suppose the theory being that if they're here for restaurant week, they're here because it's restaurant week, they're not coming back anytime soon""  it's fairly counter intuitive to think that way but  there can be a little dismissive attitude sometimes. NEVER at David Burke's kitchen, friendly helpful with suggestions, prompt service . My first time there i sat next to two women who were sharing a bottle of wine, they had barely had any of it but had to rush off to some function. One of the ladies turned to me and my girlfriend and asked if we would like to finish it for them as they had to get going. We at the time were having a nice. conversation with the couple on the other side of us who were there for the first time as well. Before i could barely say ""thank you that's very kind"", our server Joshua appeared holding four glasses for us and the couple we were chatting with. It may sound silly but such things make a big impression on me. That was about two years ago, Joshua has since been promoted to Maitre'D, and deservedly so. Since then we have been back there more times than I could even count. Birthdays.  various other celebrations, and plenty of random Saturday night dinners, I mean countless returns, it's become one of my go to places and it is always, ALWAYS fantastic.

But I don't want to throw up whenever I think about it.I got the charred octopus, which was okay. But my dad got the pretzel crab cake, and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD. It was phenomenal and I loved it it was so great! The lobster dumpling soup was really small, though. For the entree, I got the pork chop. It was sort of dry and tasteless, and I'm glad the mango chutney sauce was there. The bacon and onion ring with it was good though. Once again, my dad's short rib was far superior to my dish. But his was a lot smaller, and wouldn't have filled me up. Dessert was the reason why I didn't go back. Instead of blowing my mind, I got the chocolate tart with a scoop of berry sorbet on top. THE CHOCOLATE TART WAS HORRIBLE! Please don't get it...it's like a large version of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, but WORSE! I couldn't even finish 1/5th of it. It was incredibly difficult to eat! The sorbet on top was nice, though. I finished that. And my parents' frozen yogurt sundae was enjoyable. All in all, you should try it because RW is a steal at this place, but you won't fall in love with the place.

The restaurant is located in the James Hotel, which is very unique and stands out from all the buildings near by.Once inside, you'll walk down the stairs on the right and you walk into a cozy, modern looking restaurant. It's definitely got a chique look to it, with a trendy looking crowd. There's also seating upstairs and outdoors, which is nice for those warm spring, summer nights. For my 3 courses, I ordered the Tuna Tartare, Pork Chop and Frozen Arnold Palmer. The Tuna Tartara came out in a unique oval shape. There was whipped soft avocado on it with a salad around the plate. The Tuna was very soft and almost gelatin like, but very tasty. I definitely liked the avocado touch on top. The Pork Chop was exactly what I expected, BIG! There was 2 strips of bacon and 2 onion rings on top of it. Very interesting combination. The Pork Chop was a bit tough to cut and flavor was not all there, but it sufficed. I would've liked if there was some sauce or more juiciness to it. The bacon was half burnt, but I believe that's how it was supposed to be cooked and the onion rings were what they were. FINALLY, we get to the Arnold Palmer, it was a frozen concoction of sweet tea, lemon and mint that was served in a jar. It was sweet, but not too sweet and had a bit of a berry taste to it.Not sure if I'd come back here again, but it's worth a visit just for Restaurant Week to check out the modern cozy decor, extensive menu and if it's nice to get a chance to hang outside in the warm weather.",1,0,1,Chris E.,"Brooklyn, NY",530,1118,9624
5.0,8/8/2013,I honestly don't remember much before the Cheesecake Lollipops. I remember that everything was delish.  I kind of remember getting some sort of short ribs.  I vaguely remember the Cheesecake Lollipop tree being put in the table and then I woke up seventeen hours later after my binge on these divine creations of beauty.  They say it's for two but I found myself giving my eating partner dirty looks every time they had one; like it was the last crack rock.Eat responsibly.,3,3,3,Justin W.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",130,191,10
4.0,8/8/2013,"This restaurant is located in the James Hotel, which is technically on the border of Chinatown.  We were a little hesitant as we passed by several deserted lots to get there.  With that said, the interior is beautiful.  I felt like I was transported to a very elegant terrace.  There was  plenty of light that shone through the large windows.  It was a beautiful day to take a long lunch break during restaurant week.Our food was also great!  We tried the burrata and the dumpling duo.  The burrata salad was simple, but refreshing.  In the dumpling duo, you get 2 types of dumplings, 2 each.  The crispy short rib was definitely my favorite.  For entrees, we tried the burger and the branzino.  The branzino was extremely light, and doesn't weigh you down if you still have to work to do back in the office.  The burger was made to perfection, and the jalapeno fries were a tasty complement.  Dessert was just an after though.  We tried the chocolate cake and the sundae, and did not think much of either.  Nonetheless, overall, one of the best restaurant meals I've had!",2,1,1,Kathy W.,"New York, NY",36,256,1
4.0,8/6/2013,"came here for restaurant week...and realized i have actually been here before...for restaurant week. don't you just hate when that happens? it's like an awkward 1st date that turns out to actually be ...well, not. i was pleasantly surprised this second time around though! what i remembered as a ""meh"" meal was elevated to another level for me. for apps we got the asparagus burrata salad w/ prosciutto & watermellon, and the tuna tartar. the burrata was so creamy and complemented the salty prosciutto & freshness of the watermelon really well. the tuna tartar had a bit of avocado and a nice tanginess from the  some red onion & tomato. for entrees we got the short rib and fresh catch which was black bass. the bass was so tender & tasty. and the short ribs sat on a bed of mac & cheese with little shallot crunchies- SO good. dessert was probably the least memorable, but still a very nice end. we got the choco caramel tart & yogurt sundae, which actually went well together since the tart was so heavy & the sundae was cold & refreshing. i saw people around me getting the cheesecake tree and i admit i am still intrigued. something about eating dessert off a whole tree at your table....maybe the 3rd date ;)",1,0,1,Lowie T.,"Manhattan, NY",72,264,24
4.0,8/4/2013,"The overall: The waiter was friendly and helpful with suggestions. The staff was very attentive. Quick in terms of serving the food (score!). Thumbs up for great service. David Burke Kitchen is great for groups as well as intimate parties. This modern sleek restaurant is tucked below a hotel so a tad harder to find.Mustard crusted tuna: In a way, you kind of remind me of sushi, lol. The tuna was cut into decent bite-size portions and encrusted with mustard that's fried finely so you get a nice crunchy texture that goes well with the soft flesh of the tuna.Short ribs: Very tender and soft. Breaks apart easily with fork. It's a decently sized portion and compliments well with the accompanying mac & cheese. It actually exceeded my expectations because I've tasted dry short ribs before but David Burke does it right! There's flavor packed in every bite. Bravo!Strawberry red velvet sundae: Tart homemade yogurt sitting on top of moist chocolate cake tinted with red food coloring. What I like is that they don't overplay the food coloring. Instead, they focused on bringing out the chocolate flavor of the red velvet cake. This dessert is great because the cake sits in a small pool of fresh strawberries drowning in homemade syrup. You get a lot of different flavors and textures in this sundae. And it's topped with a dollop of fresh homemade whipped cream (which I usually so but oh heyyyy, did it look good!).Worth the money for RW because you basically order from the same menu with the same portions :) Yes, it's a go!",3,2,2,Olivia S.,"New York, NY",656,607,1036

4.0,8/3/2013,"A friend and I decided to try this place for restaurant week's dinner menu. I would definitely recommend this place because it is close to their normal menu, and many of their popular options are available on their restaurant week menu - LOTS of options to choose from!1) Appetizer: Burrata, asparagus + prosciutto with watermelon - perfect summer dish. It was refreshing and light from the watermelon, and had a sweet, light, savory taste all in one from the combination of flavors.2) Short rib + mac & cheese: AMAZING. the short rib literally melted off my knife when I cut into it, and the mac and cheese were pasta shells with cheese. The mac & cheese was normal, but the combination of the short rib and mac and cheese blended the flavors together perfectly.3) My friend and I decided to pay the $16 supplement and get the monkey bread. We heard good things. It was VERY sweet and rich in flavor in a circle-shaped tin pan, with salted caramel ice cream and whipped cream with caramel drizzled on top. I DIED. LITERALLY. Sugar overload. I had one food baby from the food and a dessert baby from that thing. We couldn't even eat half of it so we took a lot home.Supposedly, since you pay the supplement and it's for two, you can order another dessert as part of the prix-fixe. But we were about to throw up from eating so much so we didn't.Great ambiance, very hip, and if I could eat at the garden that would've given me a full 5 all around.

4.0,8/1/2013,"My friend and I came here for Restaurant Week 2013 (lunch menu).Service: Lovely waitress, she was pleasant and prompt. Our water glasses were always filled and there was never a long wait for any of our dishes. When we split the bill on 2 credit cards, she didn't bat an eyelash and charged both cards. We left her a good tip =)Atmosphere: It was a little loud but I could still have a conversation with my friend with no problems. The tables were a little too close to each other and you can always hear what the next table is talking about, slightly awkward.Food: I loved that even if it was restaurant week, we had the whole menu to choose from. Awesome. Instead of a bread basket, we get a little bucket of grapes, pickled carrots, and pretzel sticks. Healthy~AppetizersPotted Duck & Foie Gras Jar- Mmmmm. I only had a bite of this since it was my friend's dish but it was surprisingly light and soo delicious hehe. I'm sure it got kind of rich and filling after a while though, but my friend finished it with no problem.Pretzel Crab Cake- After reading so many raves about this dish, I decided to get it ($5 supplement). I had registered my Amex card with the restaurant week page to get $5 credit back so I didn't pay extra at all! It was full of crab and very delicious. Light and not oily at all, I didn't feel weighed down by this dish.Main Prosciutto and soft egg pizza- I didn't try any of this. My friend didn't comment on it *shrug*. She had 2 slices and had to wrap up the rest to take home though, it was pretty big.Grilled Salmon with quinoa, roasted carrots, and almonds- oh yummm. I asked for it to be done medium and it came cooked to PERFECTION. Its the best cooked salmon I have had for a while. DessertSmoked Caramel & Chocolate Tart with raspberry sherbet- oooh...this was my friend's dessert. It was not too sweet- caramel lovers would swoon. a lot of caramel. I only had a bite of this and ...argh I wish I took another bite!Frozen yogurt sundae with red velvet cake and strawberry compote- mmm this was good too. I guess all the dishes I ordered today were light and didn't make me feel like a fatty. This sundae was served in a mason jar. The red velvet cake and strawberry compote sat on the bottom while the middle layer had frozen yogurt and it was topped with very airy whipped cream. All the flavors together on my fork was yummy.I had a great meal today. While none of the food was OMG THE BEST I EVER HAD, I would come back again because it was still very delicious. If I ordered with normal menu prices I think I would have given 3 stars but since it was only $31ish with tax and tip, I think 4 stars is warranted for this lunch!",1,1,1,Emily L.,"Queens, NY",138,136,12
4.0,7/31/2013,"DB Kitchen is steps away from the 1 train on Canal street, I chose the place based on its proximity to the office.  Located beneath ground level (think Lure Fishbar) of the James Hotel.  This is standard David Burke establishment, you know that they will always have the lollipop tree as an option for dessert.  Try the cocktails - the little hottie was refreshing and had nice kick.For restaurant week, we were able to choose from their whole menu (extra star).  Some items have a supplement charge but there were plenty of other options on the list.  Most restaurants give you 3 options for each course, at DB Kitchen we are looking at 5 - 10 choices.  I had the potted duck and foie gras jar, the kitchen burger, and we shared the toffee monkey bread (supplement).  I don't usually eat fries but the jalepeno ones that came with the burger looked too good to pass up, the the toffee monkey bread was advertised for 2 people, but realistically it will feed at least 6.  It's served warm and assembled tableside, sweet, rich, sticky deliciousness.  My friends stumbled into the Treehouse when they arrived were kindly told by the hostess that they were closed for a private party that afternoon.  So they went to the bar at the restaurant while they waited for me.  The bartender had told them that they were out of cider for the afternoon (apparently being used by the private party), so my friend ordered a different beer.  During the meal, the hostess from the Treehouse came over to the table and gave my friend the cider on the house and apologized again that the Treehouse was booked at the time.  Our waitress (I think her name was Sara) at the table was friendly and very pleasant.  Overall, great service and customer appreciation.When you go, try not to get the tables next to the beam / pole - I know they're needed to hold up the ceiling but they're eyesores and you'll be staring at it all night.",4,1,1,Jenny L.,"Queens, NY",95,191,288

I made reservations several weeks before, but we were running late so I called and asked to push back our reservation with no problem. Wasn't too crowded when we went. We each got the prix fixe lunch for $29 (includes an appetizer and main entree OR a main entree and dessert). We got the following:Pretzel crab cake: absolutely delicious! It comes with crab wrapped in pretzel sticks resting in some veggies that pair perfectly with the crab cake. Angry mussels: small mussels, but my friend said it was goodKitchen Eggs Benedict: good, but nothing to blow your socks offSteak and eggs: awesome! It's not your typical diner steak and eggs; this is a real steak with some beef chili and eggs on top. Some might think the chili is too much, but I had a taste of my friend's and I definitely wanted more. Also comes with potatoes.Cheesecake lollipop tree: manager brought it out for us and said it was on the house (see, being nice and politie goes a long way)!

4.0,7/26/2013,"I had a great time here with family for restaurant week dinner. We were promptly seated upstairs in the garden and lucky for us the weather has been very moderate lately! We had a great server, Sean, who made sure we were doing okay all evening. Sean sold me on getting the Pretzel Crusted Crab Cake even though there was a slight upcharge on it. But I was very happy with the portion size and the amount of crab in it. I personally felt my mom's spicy Shrimp and Crab Cocktail was the bomb but in the end I was satisfied with my crab cake. I also got to nibble on the Charred Octopus and Watermelon Gazpacho and they were also very good.For entrée, I had the 'From the Ocean'. It was a crispy skin sea bass over summer squash and tomato water. It was very light and refreshing, perfect for summer. My brother had the pork chop which was cooked to perfection. However, my brother didn't love the mango chutney under the pork chop.Lucky for me that I got to try 5 out of the 7 desserts. Here's the low down:  Frozen Arnold Palmer: Think lemon ice tea shaved ice. I didn't particularly love it but it had very novel taste.  Passion Fruit Meringue Pie: Delicious! This was my favorite one. It was tart but so sour that makes your lips pucker.  Summer Fruits & Sorbet: It was okay but the overall it a little too tart for me.  Frozen Yogurt Sundae: This was also okay but it (very) quickly melted in the summer sun. We ended up eating yogurt soup.  Smoked Caramel and Chocolate Tart: If you like caramel this is for you.

We were seated and handed a small menu; understandably so, since it was brunch. My wife decided to get the salmon for entree out of the 4 options mentioned. I was happy getting the french toast.When we placed our order, we were informed that unfortunately they were out of salmon. When we asked what they had in place of the salmon, the server said 'Nothing'. A highly rated high end restaurant ran out of their only fish entree during brunch and did not care to replace it with another dish. Go figure!When we asked how could they not replace it with something similar, the server said that he could get the manager if we wanted to speak to him about it and we we agreed. We waited for the manager to show up but the server was back in about 5 minutes and said that they had salmon now! Not sure where it appeared from, but we were not complaining.Finished our brunch (which was alright) and ordered for the check. When the check arrived, I could not interpret how the charges were distributed (being that we had purchased a groupon). I expected the check to comprise of only the taxes (about $4) and was happy to add a handsome gratuity, inspite of the not so pleasant experience. However, the check was for $12. I know its not a big difference, but I asked the server if a part of the gratuity was included, and he said that they forgot to include another deduction in the check. He promptly took the check back and returned with the updated amount of about $4. Not a big deal paying $12 instead of $4, but its not about the money. Had i not checked (and to be honest I dont in most cases) I would have ended up paying more for a not so pleasant experience (which may have been part of the reason that I did not enjoy my meal).

I had the parfait, which was a delicious blend of greek yogurt, granola, fresh fruit and candied nuts. As an entree, I ordered the shrimp and chicken salad which was loaded with bacon and some brie. Delectable! I wasn't expecting it to be so filling, but it was AMAZINGGGGG! My boyfriend and I are going to try more salads for dinner if any can match up to this one. For dessert, I had a whirl at the seasonal fruit pie - mango! Wait, a mango pie? Yes!!! A scrumptious mango merengue pie! The crust was a little thick at some points, but it was delightful.Servers were very friendly. The cherry on top for the whole experience was definitely having the head chef come to our table and pour melted chocolate all over my boyfriend's chocolate cake. His face lit up with excitement.

3.0,6/10/2013,"Randomly came across this place today and had lunch. Here are my thoughts:Ambiance: Pretty place, great decor. Empty though. Not sure if that was because it was 2 pm and the lunch crowd was gone or because it was a Monday? Service: Our waitress was very friendly and had great suggestions. Our only confusion was at the end of the meal when we ordered a latte and it didn't come for 20 minutes. We finally cancelled it. Not a big deal but just odd that a coffee took longer than crab cakes.Food: Pretzel crab cake. burger and fries, shirmp/chicken salad, chocolate malt dessert were delicious. We were not a fan of the lobster pot stickers though. They were mushy and tasteless. Overall: Not sure I'd come back here. It was just missing personality and was pricey for what it offered.

That's one of the reasons I decided to try Kitchen...the other was the Groupon, but it expired, so I only went to use credit for the amt I paid ($39). The reason why I'm not going back is because the next day, we heated up the leftovers and my brother and I both got sick from eating the food. We ordered the blacked sea bass and the 45-day aged steak. Maybe it was a bad choice for us to say medium rare. For appetizers, we tried the crab cake, the gazpacho, and the ants of the log. All were quite good. I didn't realize that we could only apply the groupon credit for lunch, not dinner, so I ended up not being able to use it.

1.0,5/20/2013,"DO NOT COME HERE!  Worst experience ever!  Never going back, am surprised by the good reviews because I had the worst experience there.  Came here for Easter Brunch.  It was $49 per person for a buffet.  They took my credit card information down when I made the reservations and threatened that they would charge me if we didn't show up.  We were going to be a table for 3, my sister in law was visiting from DC.  We got there, and the place was practically empty.  Nevertheless, they sat us in a 2 seater table and plopped a 3rd chair in the aisle, right where the waiters from the kitchen were passing by.  We asked the hostess to seat us at another table, since there were literally at least 10 other tables free.  She didn't even bother checking with the other hostess up front, and just said no, those are reserved.  Finally, after 10 minutes, before my sister in law was about to complain, they moved us to a table in the back corner with only views of the kitchen.  Keep in mind that the entire 2 hours that we were there, the place never filled up, and there were ALWAYS at least 5 tables empty (suitable for a party of 3-5) and untouched closer to other customers and the actual food.  It was insulting the way we were treated.For $49 per person, the food was whatever.  When I think of brunch buffets, I think of the ones in Las Vegas Casino Hotels, or even the ones in Atlantic City at the Borgata.  So with an Easter Brunch buffet in NYC, you think of fresh pastries, a variety of eggs, meats, etc., but it was very limited and the pans were constantly empty.  Even though there were not many people there!  Where was all the food going?  The french toast sticks were dry and hard.  The danishes were also dry and seemed like they were leftovers from the day before.  IHOP is better!  I was really upset with the service, especially since they were so pretentious with their reservations and taking my credit card info.  The owner should think about replacing their hostesses, it was a man and a woman and they were too busy engrossed into eachother to notice customers waiting to be seated.  Avoid going to this place.  They suck!",1,0,0,Sam V.,"New York, NY",3,100,0
4.0,5/14/2013,"VENUE:As you approach the restaurant, you can feel the full effect of their ""farm-to-table"" concept. A life size pig statue greets you at the entrance. Inside, the decor has all the elements of what I'd like to call a ""little house on the prairie"" theme; checkered table clothes, fruit baskets, and sepia filtered pictures of livestock.FOOD:Pastrami Salmon ($16) - bagel fritters, pickled onions, garlic cream.Bagel with smoked salmon is a pretty typical breakfast choice, but never did I imagine it could be re-engineered into bite-size form. I thought those mini bagel bites were genius. All you have to do is fork the bagel ball, along with some salmon pastrami and cream cheese, and then just pop in your mouth. No more spreading and cutting!Pretzel Crab Cake ($19) - Tartar sauce, green beans, red pepper marmalade.Growing up as a kid, I have fond memories of eating snacks like Pocky sticks and Pretz. So when I made the connection that ""Pretzel"" on this menu description referred to Pretz sticks, I was pretty excited! Not only did it provide a crunchy compliment to an otherwise familiar crab cake, it added just a touch of nostalgia to it.Angry Mussels ($15) - tomato, basil, garlic toast.I'm not entirely sure why this entree was given the name ""Angry Mussels"", but my tummy was anything but angry after tasting it. It does however, have a slightly spicy kick to it.Steak & Eggs ($28) - steak, chilli, home fries.I never could understand how steak could be considered breakfast but I suppose anything served with egg can technically qualify. This was quite a sizable portion of steak, and tack on the egg and beans, it will definitely keep any protein deficiencies at bay!Organic Egg Lobster Scramble ($21) - with chorizo or vegetableI couldn't help but order this Lobster Scramble because let's be honest, lobster is pretty awesome (I sincerely apologize for those who are allergic). It came in a half ostrich egg shell (which I hear requires a drill to break open; fun fact of the day!) and a bed of course salt. The presentation was probably the most appealing aspect, because it ended up tasting pretty regular, even with the chorizo and lobster. A bit underwhelming to my anticipation, but by no means unsatisfying as a breakfast.A thoroughly satisfying and indulgent breakfast!",5,3,3,Mary C.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",69,125,338

I asked the waiter if he could turn the air off and he quickly responded that the air fluctuates. The least he could have done was faked it and said I'll go talk to my manager. The fact that I had to keep my coat on during my dinner definitely detracted from my experience. I saw others in the restaurant with coats on as well. For appetizers we shared the fluke crudo, the pretzel crab cake, and the duck fois gras in a jar. I'm not much of a fois gras person but the boys enjoyed it. I thought the fluke and crab cake were tasty. For entree, I got the scallops and pork belly. This was a pretty small portion - only three scallops and a small piece of pork belly.

1.0,4/28/2013,"Having been to another David Burke restaurant, my best friend and I were eager to try the brunch menu at DB Kitchen. We made reservations for Sunday afternoon at 3pm, we were running a tad bit late so I called to let them know. When we arrived about 10 minutes after our reserved time, we were warmly greeted downstairs in the main dining area. They asked if we were using the Groupon deal (which we knew nothing about), we said no. They asked if we preferred to sit in the main dining room or in the treehouse bar outside. At that time the sun was shining, it was warm, we opted for outside. They told us to go upstairs and ask for Alison. It was a complete 180 from downstairs to upstairs. We walked into chaos and were not greeted for a good 5 minutes. When we were, the mgr asked again if we were using a Groupon, when we said no, he said the wait is about 20 minutes. We told him we had reservations, he asked if we checked in downstairs. Alison came over at that point and said even with the reservation, no tables were available right now, we could wait at the bar inside. We did. Complete disorganization...despite the awkward layout of the bar, the bartender wasn't familiar with the drinks on their menu, asked if we wanted to start a tab (even though he knew we were sitting there waiting for our table). Table was ready in about 10 minutes, the hostess came over and told us and when I said-sure, just let me close the tab, she said-yes, please pay your bill at the bar first. Okkkkkkk, didn't need reminding. My friend went to the table, I paid the bill and they AGAIN handed her the special Groupon menu.  She told them we did not have a Groupon but if you want to give us that special price, FINE. They switched out and gave the prix fixe menu. It just continued to go downhill from there.We were sitting right by the waiter's station and were witness to the complete and utter confusion whenever an order came out from the kitchen. Numerous tables did not have food, our waitress took 20 minutes to bring me a seltzer. We had no silverware and no napkins. When I asked for a napkin, she asked if I wanted paper or cloth. Personally I don't care right now, I just want a napkin and a properly dressed table.It took 20 minutes before we were able to order our food. Angry mussels to start-sorry, we're out of mussels. Ok. So I opted for the yogurt parfait and the legs and eggs. She had the pastrami salmon and the lobster omelet. It took another 30 minutes to get our appetizers and our entrees came out shortly afterwards, with a nice long HAIR on top of my friend's omelet. Thankfully she noticed right as the waitress was setting the plates down, so it was whisked away pretty quickly but really? Omelet came back out quickly. All of the food looked delicious. Taste was a 5 out of 10, very bland and no salt and pepper on the table to help. It had gotten quite windy and chilly over the duration of our meal, so much so a few menus flew away and an umbrella toppled over. Obviously the weather is not their fault but you would think they would stop seating up there but nope, the chaos continued and the staff looked overwhelmed.We ordered 2 coffees to end. Our waitress didn't charge for them due to the hair issue. While she apologized, the mgr walked past our table no less than 15 times and never even smiled. It is what it is. I know I won't be back. Heads up, I marked it as splurge based on yelp's standards but it was pretty average for an NYC restaurant. One drink (mimosa-$15), prix fixe menu ($29/per person) and tip, our bill came out to @ $95. Also marked as loud based on the outdoor eating area (which is to be expected), can't really vouch for inside.",5,0,0,Buttafly B.,"Bayside, NY",2,46,4

David Burke is next to my office so I have been here for lunch and dinner and everything was always outstanding.  Good service, great food, great drinks. love it.  I was so excited to hit this up for breakfast yesterday (Thurs) but it was as if I was at an entirely different restaurant.  Prices are still high, but the food and service was awful.  I ordered an egg white veggie & cheese omelette and got a bacon & cheese omelette.  Okay, fine.  A mistake.  When I got my right order 20 min. later, it was a rubbery circle of egg whites with uncooked veggies inside and the cheese wasn't even melted.  GROSS.  And this is an EIGHTEEN dollar omelette. The table next to us has the exact same experience too - wrong order and when it was righted, it was inedible.  The then took away my dad's food without even asking if he was done (he wasn't).  Wasn't because it was busy either - Maybe 4 tables in the whole place.They did apologize and take my omelette off the bill, but I would NEVER go here for breakfast.  A diner would have been 3x better.  Hopefully this isn't a sign that the place is going down hill....",2,0,0,Julia W.,"Medford, MA",39,134,2

I really liked the parfait--it was the perfect mix of homemade Greek yogurt, berries, nuts and really tasty strawberry jam (which was surprisingly not too sweet). It was like ambrosia.

Maitre'D greeted us as though we'd stumbled, uninvited, into his apartment, thanks pal. Had the BLT and the Burger. Muffin style burger was a failure, overburdened bun, soggy. Ketchup, which came after asking twice, was given in a gimmicky, tiny, squeeze bottle that looked like something from a chemistry lab. BLT was poorly structured, ingredients just falling off a base of bread. No middle slice or top.

Our server was probably the best we had while in town, and that's saying a lot (we had some really good service all week long). We dropped in here for dinner one night - kind of a post-anniversary celebration dinner. I honestly don't know how they make the pretzels that they put in the bread basket, but I wish they packaged that stuff for resale. They were light and buttery and - well, they were like crack to me. I couldn't stop eating them, and my poor husband only got a bite or two of one stick before it disappeared into my piehole. It's a good thing our actual food came out when it did, because we were seated really close to the bread/water/other items station, and I saw just gobs and gobs of those delicious little pretzels hanging out in a jar...waiting for me to consume them...Is the first part of this review really just about pretzels?

Our waiter asked us about our cheese likes and dislikes, and then put the board together based on that, which I truly appreciated. All three cheese options were creamy, and mild or tart when they needed to be. Plus - the crackers that they served with the cheese...!For my appetizer, I chose the lobster dumpling soup, and my husband got the pretzel crab cake. Lucky - it's made with the same pretzels they bring to the table! Both dishes were superb. The lobster dumplings had a hint of citrus in them, which was completely unexpected. The broth was rich and suited the dumplings perfectly. My husband loved the crab cake, and he should - it was divine. The one bite I got of it almost had me flagging down the waiter to order one of my own.I chose the scallops and pork belly for my main dish, and my husband chose the braised short ribs over cavatelli. Again, both dishes were perfectly cooked and delicious. The scallops paired with the bit of pork belly really well, and the pork belly itself was crispy, fatty and amazing. My husband's dish was delicious on its own, but then they went and added a truffle cream to the top of it. Wow, was that rich! He couldn't make himself stop eating it, even when he was nearing capacity.At the end of the night, we walked out of there full up but still talking about what we had eaten for dinner. We still talk about the food, to this day. Like I said - it's good we don't live nearby!",1,0,0,Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",270,1136,2857

SOLD) then ordered the classic eggs benedict.  I was salivating when I received my order.  Canadian bacon, garlicky spinach and hollandaise sauce.. YUM YUM YUM!!!

Needless to say we loved the food - it was cooked perfectly, the portions were in the Goldilocks zone (not too big, not too small, juuuust right).I ordered the DUMPLING DUO for my appetizer which included 2 lobster & 2 short rib dumplings. They came in different yet equally yummy sauces and were definitely my favorite part of the meal. For my entree I ordered the SALMON which came on a bed of assorted roasted veggies and pureed cream kale (which was surprisingly good!). The waitress asked me how I wanted my salmon cooked which I rarely (no pun intended) come across these days so I asked for 'medium' and it was perfect. Lastly, for DESSERT, I got the mixed fruit and seasonal sorbet which was surprisingly large for a dessert...not that I'm complaining!The food came out in a timely manner and was presented well considering it was only lunch time.

The wife had a break from teaching so we decided to go into NYC during the week to avoid crowds... on the road and in the restaurant. That all worked out fairly well. I used an expired Groupon... which allowed me to use their regular menu and get credit for what I paid for it. Apparently there is a Groupon menu that is considerably abbreviated. Service started off a bit slow and with a little attitude maybe? Not sure... that could have been me. So we shared the lobster dumpling sweet and sour which we enjoyed very much. The wife had the bronzini on quinoa, which she enjoyed very much. I tasted the quinoa and had to ask the waiter if the chef would tell me how he made it. Very tasty! I had the Kitchen burger which came out medium rare, just like I asked. The jalapeno fries were as good as Mickey D's... only with jalapeno sprinkled on them. The dark chocolate malt cake was fantastic. I'd go back just for the cake. My only problem isn't with DBK, it's with having to drive into NYC. I just hate it!

4.0,3/30/2013,"3.7, rounded to 4.A friend and I had 2 pm reservations for brunch on Sunday (apparently no ""lunch"" on weekends). Service was lacking. Servers were courteous but just ""too busy"" to offer the service I'm accustomed to at DB restaurants. Jean P (Paul? Pierre?) was our waiter and I know that only bc I asked him. Even after asking his name, I still didn't know he was our waiter until I asked the direct question. He'd come to the table a couple of times but didn't have much presence (probably bc there wasn't enough space for him to stand next to our table; he stood behind it instead). I had a Groupon and felt like everyone else along our row did too. Seating was too close together...I felt like anyone could look over and know what I was saying even if I whispered. Oh, and I was disappointed that the menu was different than expected...not completely, but I'd def picked out carrot cake for my dessert in advance and had to settle for choc cake. (Didn't have room to eat it anyway.)The food we ordered, though? Not a single complaint. We both ordered yogurt parfait which was incredibly good (but, quite sweet). We shared Eggs Benedict and Stuffed French Toast - I wouldn't have had it any other way bc both were excellent but french toast only after the parfait would have been much too sweet. Eggs Benedict w chorizo polenta and potatoes were exceptionally well seasoned and the perfect contrast to the french toast, moist and flavorful on the inside with the perfect amount of crispiness on the outside. All recommended by Jean P, to his credit. Omg. I can taste it now. I literally couldn't take full breaths after eating the popover, yogurt, and shared entrees - I was so stuffed, I could barely move (hadn't eaten all day). They could have kept the choc cake...I tasted it and it was good (not spectacular) but I wouldn't order it a la carte even if I wanted a dessert.Overall, I like the atmosphere; service could have been better; food was awesome.

If you're going to go to a David Burke restaurant you have to go all or nothing for the best experience. Therefore, I opted for the PORTERHOUSE. While, it may seem a little pricey at $110 it really isn't. It serves 2 people and comes with 2 sides. It was extremely filling and the presentation was very professional and beautiful. Dining at it's finest! The establishment is pretty fancy and VERY spacious. There's a rooftop bar that seemed really cool but there was a private event going on that night.

2.0,3/25/2013,"Crap service on a Sunday afternoon. Came to the restaurant  for a birthday celebration with 10 people. Should have known things were not going  to go well when we ordered 2 of their specialty drinks on the menu, one came out in 5 minutes the other took 25 minutes to arrive and 2 inquiries to the wait staff.It took close to 45 minutes for our appetizers to come out and more than an hour for our entrees. We had to constantly ask bus boys and other waiters to get the attention of our waitress who seemed to forget about us for long stretches of time. A server brought out a cappuccino and spilled it while putting it down on the table. He didn't bring a spoon with it or any sugar and didn't ask us if we needed any before he ran off. It took us 5 minutes to get our waitresses to bring those to the table.It wasn't until more than an hour had passed since ordering (just getting our appetizers) that the manager finally took notice and buzzed by to ask us if everything was ok. There was some issue with the kitchen that somehow prevented out table from getting its food yet we sat and watched other tables order, receive and finish full meals in that time.The food was delicious, when it finally arrived, but not good enough to justify an hour wait after ordering.The final insult, after crappy service, ridiculous waiting and no apologies from the staff was they wanted to charge us $7.50 per person (an extra $75) to distribute the 10 cupcakes we brought to celebrate the birthday. I would be hard pressed to recommend the restaurant or return due to the horrible service. Perhaps we got the one bad apple of a waitress but no attempt to remedy the situation were made by the manager and clearly the issue with our food was known. My guess is that due to the hotel they get a lot of european visitors who put up with slow crappy service. Local NYers should aviod.",2,0,0,Chris C.,"New York, NY",99,39,0

Take a deep breath and smell the deconstructed apple pie when you walk into this comfortingly slow-paced restaurant. The décor is ready for its close up, regardless of its basement location in the St James hotel. The Groupon lunch menu, with the exception of the appetizers, was a long yawn on the porch after port and dessert--nothing exciting, only the thought of going to sleep. The salmon pastrami appetizer, a flavor explosion of salt and sea perfection, was delicious in its own right, but even better with the herb and garlic ""cream puffs"" and mustard seeds that accompanied it. The chicken and shrimp salad, lacking the down home tang I expected, was no brandy soaked cigar. My drunk raisin oatmeal sundae lacked any sort of decadence that would've made it a true sundae.

They also have a jalepeno infused vodka drink which is strong, tasty, and not sweet. Food here is well executed and consistent. I recommend the ants on the log (bone marrow), the duck, the pretzel crab cake, and the lobster eggs benedict.

They don't skimp on portions and they basically make their entire regular menu available for the prix fixe, which is almost unheard of. I came here with 3 friends that appreciate a good meal as much as I do, so it was the perfect crowd for this kind of dinner.To start, I had the angry octopus, which was the best decision ever. The octopus was cooked perfectly and was just so delicious and I wanted to basically lick my plate clean. For my main, I had the short rib, which was .. HUGE. I couldn't even finish the portion. When you put short ribs, pasta, and truffle cream together, I'm not sure it can be anything short of a mouthgasm. For dessert, I had chocolate which was also delish, but at that point i was almost at food coma state and could only take a few bites. No need to worry though, my friend finished every last bite of that cake.If you're looking for the best deal during restaurant week, this one is 1000% it.",0,0,0,Jennifer C.,"New York, NY",18,47,12
2.0,3/3/2013,"We came to DBK with high hopes and a lunch Groupon and ordered:APPS:The dumpling duo was served cold.  The lobster dumpling had no flavor. Either that, or the tartar sauce that it sat on completely overpowered the lobster so we didn't actually taste the lobster.  The fried short rib dumpling had better flavor and I liked the thin, fried skin though they tasted like they'd been refried.  It has to be said that we ate here a day after doing a dumpling crawl and eating fresh dumplings in Flushing so our expectations were set quite high. These dumplings sounded good on paper but weren't executed well. 2.5/5MAINS:Both the missus and I got the salmon as none of the other mains sounded great. We ordered them to be cooked medium rare knowing most places tend to overcook the fish. Sure enough mine came medium which was fine. They were also remiss in mentioning that they would be substituting mushrooms for the eggplant that was listed in the menu. The sauce and the mushrooms seemed out of place. I did, however, appreciate how crispy they got my salmon skin.My wife's salmon however was a disaster. It came out medium well and dry. After trying to eat it a couple of times, she decided to send it back (first time I've seen her do this). They apologized for their mistake and told us they would replace it. The replacement did come out cooked medium rare but it was a tail cut piece with a thick layer of dark meat/fat and had bones. In addition, the skin on the replacement piece was as soggy as a wet noodle and extremely unappetizing. 1/5DESSERT:I had the malt chocolate cake which was quite dry. It's only saving grace was the chocolate syrup. 2.5/5The Groupon deal was for $39 for lunch/brunch for 2 people worth up to $96. Frankly this is false advertisement. DBK offers a $25 3 course prix fixe lunch menu so that's actually a $50 value for 2, half of what was advertised.

3.0,2/24/2013,"Came here for the set lunch menu. Nice little hidden establishment....theres a little stairwell that takes you to the restaurant downstairs. The place itself was rather empty which was probably a good thing considering the place as a good 79-81 degrees on the inside. Perhaps they should check the thermostat but this could be caused from lack of ventilation in the kitchen? For the appetizer course I decided on the dumplings which consisted of a braised short rib filling and a lobster one. The short rib filling reminded me of those ready to warm up BBQ beef packs you could buy from Costco...not too appetizing. The lobster one was lackluster...One was fried in what appeared to be old oil. The only reason for pointing out such little details is this place seems to be striving for something better? The salmon entree was very fresh, juicy, and delicious. I had no problem gobbling up this course. There was a splendid green puree around the dish that complemented the salmon nicely.For dessert I needed something refreshing to cleanse my pallet. The passion fruit sorbet was really sweet but refreshing after a rather heavy lunch.

It started with a Duo of Oysters, which sounded amazing but didn't quite hit the spot, unfortunately. Everything else was great though. Next we had the Pretzel Crab Cake (which was the WHOLE reason I have been wanting to come here), and the Beef Carpaccio for appetizers. The Pretzel Crab Cake is amazing and I could have eaten 10 of those for my entire meal. The carpaccio was also tasty, I liked the dressing they used and wished there was a bit more of it. For entrees we ordered the duck and the lobster steak. Freakin' awesome! The duck was tender and delicious. The presentation of the lobster steak was nothing I've ever seen before. It reminded me of a giant crab cake but with chunks of lobster instead. Every bite made me question whether the duck or the lobster was better! For dessert, we went for the monkey bread. Holy crap, that thing is so sweet, it made my taste buds dance and shout with glee! I couldn't even finish the small serving the waiter gave me and there was still half the tin left! I thought maybe they'd let me take the tin home but nay.... I only got a take out box. Overall, extremely pleased with the whole experience and eager to come back again to try the other selections on the menu!

4.0,2/13/2013,"I came here with some friends visiting from Vancouver.  I made reservations about a week in advance for Restaurant Week.  We were seated promptly after we checked in.  The server explained how the RW menu worked.For my first dish, I ordered the pretzel crab cake.  This was absolutely delicious.  I also tried my friends sashimi and that was good too.For my entrée, I had the short ribs.  The ribs were tender and had a lot of flavor.  However, I tried the salmon and I thought that was better than my dish.Dessert consisted of the chocolate malt cake.  Everyone in our party ordered it.  I wish some of us ordered another dessert so that we could sample each other's dessert.  The salted caramel ice cream was good, but some in my group complained it was too salty.  Overall, it was a great dining experience.  The portions were more than plentiful.  The drinks that we ordered were refreshing.  I would happily recommend this place to friends.",0,0,0,Albert L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",529,482,0
3.0,2/10/2013,"Honestly? This was pretty disappointing. It hit the mark on some points but fell horribly short on others. Service: Slow and absent. We never saw our waiter between our orders and our check, and  empty plates sat on our tables for quite some time between courses. Once a busboy came to give us the next course, only to realize the previous one hadn't been cleared.Food: was not anything special. I got a rabbit cocktail, which was probably the best out of the all our courses. The angry octopus was good but notable more for its name than its flavors. The pork chop was hard to eat, and the onion rings were good but nothing to write home about. The passionfruit cheesecake dessert was a standout, 1) because I don't really like passionfruit, and 2) I don't really like desserts. I am a complete savory person, which is why it gets such high accolades. It was fluffy and had the right amount of genuine passionfruit without being overwhelming.Otherwise, we got seated in the treehouse, which is LOUD and also a bar, so for half the meal we just had these people hovering next to our table.",0,0,0,Carol H.,"New York, NY",9,144,5
4.0,2/8/2013,"Fellow Yelper Mee J. & I had a reservation at 7:30PM on a Tuesday night during Restaurant Week. After about a 10 minute wait, we were seated at our table.+ Their RW menu was pretty much their normal menu. AWESOME.+ They have coat check!+ The bread basket was adorable and yum. The butter was softened perfectly on the bar of Himalayan rock salt.- I couldn't tell if the carrots in the bread basket were edible or not because they were so cute & no one around us ate it loll.-  Pretzel Crab Cake with tartar sauce, frisée, red pepper marmalade, & beer foam was disappointing and difficult to eat/cut (Not first date food, ladies!). I paid the $5 supplement bc I heard so much about it but I didn't like it. The flavors felt so muddled and confusing (a real party in the mouth) that I'm not sure I'd order it again.+ Pork chop with cumin bacon, mango chutney & parsley onion rings - Although the pork was tough and a bit overcooked, I overlooked it bc of the deeeelicious mango chutney sauce. It was sweet and had a slight kick in it. I wish I could have spooned some of it home, dang.+ Winter Fruits and Sorbet - OMGOMGOMGOMG it was a passion fruit sorbet. I was so excited I legit almost jumped for joy. It was the perfect finish to cleanse the palate after a good, filling meal. The honeydew, cantaloupe, blueberries, pineapples, and strawberries were fresh and surprisingly ripe. Mee got the Dark Chocolate Malt Cake and I don't think I could've even touched it bc it was so rich.Lastly, the service was extremely interesting. Since the tables on both sides were so close to us, you could hear their conversations. And it was SO obvious to see the spectrum of service. Table 1 had the same server as us, and she was much more talkative and casual with them, lingering to talk and make side comments. With us, she was extremely professional, but still wonderfully attentive, checking back every so often. When our dessert was delayed, she apologized profusely although we hadn't noticed. On the other side of us, Table 2 had to ASK for their bread to be brought to the table. And I'm pretty sure their server completely forgot to bring their dessert until they asked him for it. When the guy got the bill, he asked his lady friend, ""What'd you think of the service?"" And I swear she rolled her eyes! Poor them!Overall, the food didn't satisfy my monstrous expectations for the place, but compared to other RW venues, it's SO worth the money. I'll be back... for Restaurant week haha.",4,2,2,Jess C.,"New York, NY",591,305,582
4.0,2/8/2013,"Went here for Restaurant Week lunch and this place totally rocked it! First of all, the dining room is open and airy, with sunshine slanting through the windows. It's a great atmosphere that would work equally well for a meal with clients, co-workers, family, friends or a date.The bread basket is spectacular and includes delicious little carrots.A large range of dishes are included in the Restaurant Week offerings, so you don't feel like a schlub for ordering off a separate, smaller RW menu.As for the meal...The hot and sour soup with lobster dumplings was delightful. Stunning presentation. My only comment is that the dumplings were a bit on the tough side.For my lunch entree, I had the quiche with chicken and bacon on top. It's a solid dish, but a bit unbalanced because the meat was incredibly salty, and the actual quiche got buried by all the stuff piled on top of it.The desserts were fantastic. Try the chocolate malt cake if you are a chocolate lover - I was afraid it would have a strong malt taste (which I don't like) but, happily, it did not. The lemon meringue pie was tart and delicious as well.To top it off, our server was incredibly sweet and the staff seemed on point and generally happy to be there.Will definitely go back at the earliest opportunity.",1,0,0,Marianne M.,"New York, NY",22,59,31
3.0,2/7/2013,"We came here for RW dinner. The food was very good but the over all experience was slightly disappointing in terms of quality of service. We had to wait a bit before someone handed us menus and a bit more time before they took our order. The menu was also a little confusing in terms of differentiating what items were included in the RW menu and what weren't. Their website was also slightly deceiving since nowhere did it mention that certain items have supplements in price. I was also disappointed with their selection of wines by the glass. That said, the food we had was quite good. For appetizers we had the tuna tartare and the angry octopus. The octopus was excellent! The flavors and freshness of the octopus made it the highlight of the dinner. For the entree the salmon paired with oyster mushrooms were really good and the lamb was also highly recommended. For dessert the chocolate cake and the lemon meringue pie were both good. It was definitely a good thing that we tried this place during RW though since some of these dishes were definitely over priced. I get that it's a hot spot but relative to the general ambience and the quality of service, the food didn't quite take the whole dining experience to a 4 star level.",1,0,1,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",227,1549,2438

5.0,2/5/2013,"DB Kitchen was the third restaurant I booked for Restaurant Week and hands down the best!Came here with a group of girls last Friday and every aspect of our experience was on point. While waiting for our 4th person, we ordered cocktails at the bar. It was difficult to choose one because they all looked delicious. Once we ordered the bartender brought over a little snack of these fabulous mustard-pretzel sticks, way better than bar nuts!Because we wanted to try everything we all ordered different appetizers and entrees. I would say the stars were the pretzel crabcake, angry octopus, pork chop w/mango chutney & cumin bacon (cumin bacon=genius), special sea bass, and oatmeal raisin sundae. Even though there was a ton of mentally stimulating conversation going on at our table (i.e. he totally likes you but is just really busy right now; and yes your highlights definitely look natural), it kept coming back to ""OMG, this food is amazing"". Atmosphere here is great, kind of a subtle picnic theme, and the service was awesome. Literally my only criticism is that I called to make the reso bigger but they said they were booked...and then the 4-top next to us was open our entire meal. Anyways, the food/service/atmosphere at the restaurant totally made up for that and I cannot wait to come back here, probably next time my parents are in town since it's a little pricey for this fresh-out-of-college girl living in NYC.",4,5,3,Ashley H.,"New York, NY",32,47,19
5.0,2/4/2013,"If you're going out for restaurant week (RW), my personal word of advice is to choose a restaurant based on its restaurant week menu offerings and not by its name. I've passed up Michelin starred restaurants for RW because their menu offerings only had items I would've never ordered off their regular menu.Now if you could only go to one place for RW, make it David Burke's Kitchen. Almost everything on their regular menu is available for RW. Just look on the site and anything with a bunny icon next to its name is up for grabs! I've been coming here almost every year.I recommend starting with the pretzel crab cake (this is the first time I've seen it with a $5 supplement). My guest had the smoked pastrami salmon which was decent if you like lox but you can't go wrong with the other available appetizer options. Moving onto the main course, I order the short rib because1) I like short ribs, but more importantly2) A part of me sees that it's the most expensive option on the menu without a supplement and wants to maximize my RW value. Don't deny that you guys base your RW menu options like this too!The short ribs meat was tender and had an unique flavor that I like to find is signature to the restaurant. My guest had the pork chop and found it too fatty so much of it was discarded. Perhaps it was just a bad piece, but they were very busy and didn't feel like bothering the restaurant about this. Besides, somehow we were approaching our full point.For dessert, we decided to just ask if we could substitute both our desserts for a cheesecake lollipop tree for two. The waitress asked for a $10 supplement and against the part of me that's telling me ""No! You're not maximizing your RW value!"" I decided to go for it. If you don't intend on returning to DB Kitchen for a while, I suggest trying out his signature lollipop tree. Especially if you like cheesecake. It even comes with a HIGHLY addictive pomegranate (I think) dipping cream for your pops. When we ran out of pops, we still continued to gorge on the cream.The following week I tried to make my own cake pops and I have to say, David Burke's are still better.",2,0,0,Alex W.,"New York, NY",61,164,133

The short rib wasn't my all time favorite but was good and finally the cheesecake lollipop tree was an actual tree, with limbs! It made me so happy!

2.0,2/4/2013,"Feeling pretty sad I wasn't able to be a part of my semi-annual LA restaurant week tradition, I decided that I should create a new tradition here in NYC and thus the reservation at David Burkes Kitchen.I chose David Burkes based on the selection that they offered that was from their original menu.  Too often restaurants serve up random dishes that have no relevance to the theme or focus of the restaurant.  But David Burkes provided a prix fixe that was built based on their original menu items!  So at this point a full 5 stars!  I also was dealing with several different parties, friends, friends of friends so I must have called in to change the reservation 5 times at the very least.  Each time they were more than accommodating and helped me adjust the number back and forth.  So from here I'd say david burkes is a 6 star. excellent people on the phones.We had arrived about 30 minutes earlier than expected but they were happy to seat us at that time.  They graciously took our coats and sat us at our dinner table.  Our bread basket was served along with a couple of cocktails that we had ordered.  I ordered the $15""Honey Badger"" which is a combination of a honey syrup with vodka and a sprinkling of fresh ground pepper.  I usually do not like vodka, but this drink was delicious.  I was able to try a sip of my friend's ""burning heart"" which was a tequila creation that was also pretty good too.  Unfortunately from this point on things just started going downhill.For my appetizer I knew days in advance, I was going to order their pretzel crabcake.  the prix fixe was $38, and to order the crabcake it was an additional supplement of $5.  At this point I was already set back $58 for this meal, but whatever its NYC... it'll be worth it.  My crabcake comes out looking very unique and very very far from what I usually see when I order crabcakes.  I take a bite and admittingly it was quite delicious with the generous amount of crab, but it also tasted eerily familiar.  And then I noticed the ""pretzel"" shell that was on top of my crabcake.  They use the japanese brand of pretzel ""salad pretz"" for the crabcake.  Sorry David Burke if I revealed your secret, but thats what it is.  I was kind of disappointed because I felt like I had payed $5 extra for a few extra sticks of salad pretz.  My main entree was the pork chop.  My friend next to me also ordered the pork chop and the difference between the two were like night and day.  His had come out fine, moist and tender.. while mine was as dry as that of those of practicing students at the culinary institute cook their pork chops.  Really disappointed in the lack of consistency between dish to dish.  This definitely deserves minus one star.When it comes to dessert, me and a friend had to sacrifice our regular desserts and on top of that pay an additional $10 supplemental charge in order to get the cheesecake tree.  We paid the fee since we really wanted the tree, but honestly.. that is a complete rip-off.  I'm sorry I just don't get it.  Minus another star.  The tree was pretty cute, but the cheesecake didn't even taste very good.  It was a little too soft, and they didn't stay very well on their lollipop sticks after you bite into it.  I ended up eating most of my cheesecake from my hand! lol. By the end of the meal, I had been set back $63.. and plus tax and tip(which they charged our table $90) I was paying $80, for a meal that was advertised as an affordable $38.  I was not happy with this, and not happy with all the supplemental and gratuity charges.  My friend who ordered the ""burning heart"" had her drink replaced when she was done with it without our server asking, so we had assumed that he was just giving her another one on the house.  That extra drink was also on the bill -_-.  Big minus star for all the hidden fees.David Burke's Kitchen has a very interesting concept with a warm feel in the dining room.  The people are nice, but the food is lacking.  It is also a bit of a scam to come here for restaurant week for the prix fixe $38 dinner.",0,0,0,Wendy C.,"Walnut, CA",269,614,34
4.0,2/4/2013,"exhausted from an unusually brutal combination of work and schooling, I thought i'd leave my schooling behind (agribusiness policy) and indulge in a much-needed sexy dinner date. i just couldn't leave it alone.... and David Burke Kitchen didn't help. School thoughts, school ideas, school inspirations were infiltrating the dinner date. The walls are decorated with large blown-up photos of farmers, consumption animals, bakers, brewers and the such. I was deeply touched at the efforts made to to remind patrons where their food really comes from, and how Americans have lost touch with their most basic social builders-- farmers. I spent a lot of the evening telling Fiance all about American farming systems (he's Scandinavian and they do things differently) and the generally deplorable conditions they are confined to..... yeah, not very sexy dinner talk.however, you can rest assured that the meal you're eating at David Burke Kitchen is crafted from the high quality goods, procured from humane farms, and with happy animals. Do yourself a favor, admire the photos, but don't delve too deeply into the atrocious factory farm situation in America. Its a mood-killer. ...really.the food was amazing. the drinks were stellar. the service was equally delightful. However, the bathroom could've used a quick mopping.

For a Saturday at 1PM, we were seated a little too fast, but no complaints, who wants to wait when your stomach has been empty since the night before. They have a prix fix menu for lunch where you can choose one starter and main or a main and dessert. My friend and I each got one of the prix fix and enjoyed a 3 course meal. We had the crab cake which was presented in a way I couldn't have imagined. You have to get it just to see, but it was really good. I could have done with out the pretzels, but they do get points for creativity and originality. I had the steak and eggs and they were good. The chili they put on top of the steak is what sets this apart from your typical steak and eggs. The steak could have been cooked a little more rare (they didn't ask how I wanted my steak to be cooked, so that was my fault). It was still good and the home fries were the perfect way to round out the meal. We finished with the cheesecake lollipop tree and you really do get a lollipop tree. We were so stuffed and couldn't finish all of them. It's really a tree for 3 and not two. No worries, we took them to go! Our server was awesome and while he was busy being a waiter and a bar tender, he was still able to accommodate all our needs. Between the service, atmosphere and of course the food, I'd definitely come back here.

4.0,2/1/2013,"Second winter 2013 restaurant week stop - David Burke Kitchen!By the menu choices offered during RW, we were sold to make this place as one of our stops. The earliest reservation we were able to hold on opentable was 9PM and days prior, I diligently checked back hoping for cancellations. On the morning of, an 8PM reservation opened up and I quickly made my change and immediately texted my fiance.  We arrived around 7:50 and our table was already set. We were seated in what we thought were the best seats of the place: The comfy corner couch by the kitchen where we can see every part of the restaurant. Our server was extremely friendly and took his time in explaining the menu and the specials of the night. Aside from the items listed available for restaurant week online, they added 1 appetizer (salmon tartare (no additional), sea bass (+$5 supplement), rabbit mole (+$5 supplement). The whole dessert menu was also available with monkey bread pudding (+10?) and their famous lollipop tree (+$12?). My fiance and I always study the menu before arriving in a restaurant but since now the menu offered two additional entree choices, my fiance had a really hard time deciding. He ultimately decided on trying the rabbit mole (even though he had his mind set on the short rib cavetelli for weeks). I chose the local dorade (I still can't quite figure out how to pronounce that). Before our first course arrived, we were given a cute little bread basket consisted of a popover, 3 pieces of regular white bread, some pretzel sticks, and 2 carrots. I quickly stuffed my face with the popover and couldn't help but ask for second. For appetizers, I ordered the angry octopus and my fiance ordered the tuna sashimi. The tuna sashimi was not what my fiance and I expected. The soba noodle rolls didn't taste like soba noodle. We actually ate all of it and didn't know (we just thought it tasted healthy lol) until I went back to the menu to write my review. My angry octopus was a huge disappointment. It was wayyyyy too oversalted. I took one bite and offered the rest to my fiance who has a much higher sodium tolerance. It took a while for our entrees to come out. We joked that perhaps they needed to hunt for our rabbit. The server came over to our table and apologize even though we didn't bug him about our delayed service. I was just happy with my popovers hehe. Anyways our dorade and rabbit finally arrived. My dorade was beautifully cooked where the skin was perfectly pan-fried (crispy but not greasy). The green beans however were undercooked (raw and crunchy). My fiance's rabbit mole was very well cooked. The meat literally came right off of the bone (well worth the wait). My fiance was worried initially that the dish would be too heavy when ordering. As it turned out, the mole sauce wasn't over-powerfully sweet and the entree size was perfect. For desserts I ordered the oatmeal drunken raisin sundae with sour cream ice cream. My fiance got the dark chocolate malt cake with caramel white chocolate ice cream. I initially was disappointed that they changed the carrot cake (previously listed on their RW menu) to the sundae. But hey I LOVE oatmeal raisin cookie.. and what's a better way to have a warm oatmeal raisin cake? under a scoop of sour cream ice cream to finish off my meal. My fiance also loved his dessert. He said he couldn't tell the ice cream was white chocolate and thought it tasted more like straight up caramel. He loves caramel anyways so he didn't mind one bit. On our way out, there's a jar full of caramel peanut brittles for customers to  take right by where the hostess stands.  I took 4 giant pieces and quickly covered them with my napkins (I didn't want the hostess to think i'm a greedy fatty hehe).

5.0,1/31/2013,"David Burke Kitchen is aesthetically one of the most beautiful restaurants due to its layout.  There are many outdoor areas perfect to have a bite and have a drink or two.  There is indoor and outdoor seating.  Since it was a gorgeous day, my friend and I opted to eat outside and enjoy the garden menu. I started with the tomato gazpacho with watermelon and rock shrimp.  I'm usually not a fan of fruit in my savory dishes, but this did not disappoint.  The watermelon complemented the tomato really well.  It gave it an added bite of freshness. For my entrée, I had the lobster steak with fingerling potatoes and artichoke sauce.  What is lobster steak you ask?  It's lobster in the shape of steak.  Amazing-both visually and in taste.  Also had a side of smoked beef fat and jalapeno fries.  Great spin on traditional fries.If you go to ANY of David Burke's restaurants, you must get the lollipop cheesecake tree.  It's DEFINITELY enough for two people, possibly three.  There are a few different types of cheesecakes scattered in the ""tree"".  All of them were delicious.I can't wait to go back in the summer.",2,1,2,Michelle B.,"Huntington Station, NY",816,1320,3063
1.0,1/31/2013,"This place was a huge disappointment . My girlfriend and I decided to do a little role playing for my birthday and come here for restaurant week. Because of the variety of the menu it seemed like a good choice.We got there and it looked great. Nice decor and we were seated as we walked in. She had made reservations so .... Anyhow, we got to our table and our first waiter gets to the table. I say first waiter because we had about four of them. He takes our orders for starters and drinks. My girlfriend orders one of their specialty drinks and I ordered a glass of wine. Her drink was nice on the booze so she was happy and you can really go wrong with wine so... so far so good. We ordered starters with the first waiter. She orders a Salad and some bacon wrapped fruit, I cant remember off hand what fruit it was,  and I order the Angry Octopus. The server gets to our table with the starters and knew exactly which belonged to which. Great! they have it together right? No guys, it all goes down hill from hear. However, I'll give credit where credit is due, My Angry Octopus was good. Small portion but good. My girlfriends salad was standard but the fruit had been marinated in some type of juice that gave here a small allergic reaction. Nothing serious but she couldn't finish the salad. All good none the less....Our first waiter comes to check on us and we notice a subtle sarcasm in his voice. ""is everything ok?""  ""sure, so far..."" then he just walked away. I guess you had to be there. Anyway, the server comes back and refills our water, clears our table and on to the entrees. Our entrees get there and guess what, they for got the bacon wrapped fruit we had ordered as a starter. We told the server and he fixed it but then our waiter passes us and said in a mellow sarcastic tone ""sorry about that guys"" and walks away. I ordered the Lamb chops and my girlfriend ordered the Chicken. Both plates were cold within two mins of hitting the table. As if they were microwaved. The eggplant lasagna that came with my lamb tasted as if it were from a box and the sauce as if it were from a can. You can't really mess up chicken so that was good but the whipped potato and root was cold within a min. Microwaved. And here is my biggest pet-peeve, the waiter came by and reached over my plate as I was eating in order to refill my water a second time. If it's one thing you do not do in fine dining is reach across someones plate!!! while they're eating!!!! Another is you put my silverware directly on the table, I don't know when that table was last whipped down and so at least put it on a napkinAnyway, we finish our entree and there we are, sitting there. The restaurant starts get empty and after a while it's just my girlfriend and I and another couple at the bar. Where's our dessert?? Our original water is no where in site. Everyone, including the kitchen, is shutting down . people are just walking pass us and paying us no mind. When we got there we got a visit from our waiter, two bus boys, the server and the Hostess and now no one is paying us any mind. Finally I stop one of the other waiters and tell him it was getting late and we wanted our dessert. I had the chocolate cake and she had a merange pie which she could not finish because it was way to tart and my cake tasted as if it were in a refrigerator for way to long. And we had to remind them to bring it to us!!!! the best thing of the night was the salted caramel ice cream that came with the cake. And the stiff drink. Now the bill is here. 132 dollars and we did what we NEVER done before. We left a 5 dollar tip as to say F-U and promised ourselves never to come back again. I'm sorry but as a New Yorker my standards are highIf this was a place that had, maybe, a 15 - 20 dollar menu then it would be Just OK. But 30 - 40 dollar regular price and it just looks good? Your waiter is mellow sarcastic and you forget parts of the order??  No, If you're going for classy then get classy waiters that know how to take orders and pass a ticket to another waiter when they leave and not just leave your table sitting there looking like they are not important enough to at least get the rest of their order. We go to restaurants a lot and we are born and raised in New York City and we expect the top notch quality that has made our City famous for being a host to some of the worlds best restaurants so GET IT TOGETHER FOR REAL!!!",2,1,0,Eddie U.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,30,3

3.0,1/29/2013,"We were here for Restaurant Week. I was so looking forward to trying it after reading so many good reviews. When I first walked in, I was drawn by the decor. They did a good job. For the appetizers, don't miss the pretzel crab cake. This is the highlight of our whole meal. It is so creative and delicious. We also got angry octopus for appetizer. There were only two pieces of octopus on a bed of white beans. It did not beat the crab cake at all. We got salmon and pork chop for the entree. Our cholesterol must have gone up rapidly after having the pork chop. It contains two big slices of bacon and two pieces of huge onion rings. The pork chop is a little blend. I have to say the salmon is pretty good. The skin is crispy and the flavor is solid. I was so excited to try the dessert because everyone seems to like it very much. The chocolate malt cake is super rich. It goes well with the caramel sauce. The raisin oatmeal sundae is like a breakfast dessert. I feel like I was eating a granola bar with ice cream and whipped cream. It's a very interesting combination. The overall meal tend to be a little greasy for me. I thought the flavor could be more sophisticated. I definitely have a higher expectation when it comes to the dessert.",1,1,1,Tzilla C.,"New York, NY",15,74,19

5.0,1/28/2013,"DBK has hands down the best restaurant week menu/experience in town!I am generally wary of restaurant week deals because most restaurants just offer their lowest-cost highest-margin items and don't offer some of their best dishes. DBK offers their normal menu (with only a few items excluded), which gives you the opportunity to ACTUALLY sample some of their signature dishes.Pretzel Crabcakes: very good with a lot of fresh crabmeat and no fillersShort Rib and Cavatelli: I just had to have this. In fact, my two dinner companions and I all ordered this. The short rib is a big hunk of meat (a little tough but the sauce was very flavorful), and I wish they put a proportional amount of the cavatelli and mushroom in the dish because it was delicious!!The molten chocolate cake I had was decent, very rich and the perfect way to end an unnecessarily lavish meal.The service was attentive but not particularly friendly (nothing spectacular), but no complaints because it didn't detract from the experience.This is one of the only restaurant week meals I've ever had that was actually worth the money.

4.0,1/28/2013,"I ate at David Burke's during Winter 2013 Restaurant Week.  The food and service are excellent.  However, be warned they will punish you for being late for your reservation.My friends were visiting from Boston and after immediately disembarking from the Boston to New York bus, would brave the NY MTA system while I checked in with DB in hopes they wouldn't give our reservation away.  Our reservation was during a non-peak dinner hour and the restaurant was fairly empty at that time.  I informed the host that my friends would be late.  In response, the host said it was policy that after two hours they would need the table. I panicked but my friends eventually arrived and we were seated. Although there were empty tables (large enough to seat the three of us), we were placed at a table meant for two blocked on the 4th side by a giant column.  It was fairly uncomfortable, but good friends and good food can make up for a lot. I ordered the Smoked Pastrami Salmon which was ultimately like lox but still delicious.  My friends ordered the Angry Octopus which I tasted and highly recommend.  The octopus was delicious especially the white beans served underneath.For my entree I ordered the Pork Chop that was served with bacon and onion rings.  This was the best pork chop I have ever eaten.  Ever. It was juicy and of a great portion size! For dessert, I ordered the slice o the day which was lemon meringue.  I thought it was yummy and perfectly tart.Although we had poor seats, the service was still absolutely excellent which is great during Restaurant Week, especially as that is not the norm.Ultimately, like many others, I definitely recommend this restaurant despite the column.",0,0,0,Laurinda U.,"Boston, MA",147,132,6

1.0,1/25/2013,"I knew it was going to be a gorgeous day on Sunday, so my friend and I wanted to make the most of this summer-like fall day and sit outside somewhere. I had been to the ""Treehouse"" for special work events and also know DB's food well, so thought this would be the perfect place. After calling to make sure the table I booked would be outside, and assured it would be, we arrived to be told ""there were no available outside tables."" We spoke to a manager and were eventually given one DIRECTLY in the sun, and told, of course, there were ""no other tables available."" We begrudgingly took it and prepared to bake. Once we sat, we waited at least 15 minutes for a server to approach us and then another 15 for the iced coffees we ordered to arrive. When they finally came to take our order, we asked for more water as well. Another 15 minutes went by before we had to flag someone down about our water, which was even more necessary since we were MELTING in the sun. Finally, when the meals came, they remembered about the water and STILL took another 10 min to bring it to us! Maybe we would've enjoyed the food better had the service and overall experience not sucked so much, but overall, I felt $60 for ice coffees, a salad and a lobster scramble -- no alcoholic drinks! -- was totally not worth it. There were barely any bits of lobster in my scramble and before I could finish the salad, the lettuce wilted from the sun.

It seems like most of the people complaining only went for restaurant week so of course they are not going to get the best service. I had a lovely dinner here several weeks ago. My recommendation is to get several appetizers and splurge on chef Zac Young's desserts. For apps I recommend the market salad, crab cake and charcuterie plate. I love the mustard and soppressata combo in the charcuterie plate. For desserts get the bacon sticky buns, creme brulee, caramel popcorn, donut tree and carrot cake.

4.0,1/23/2013,"My friends and I came to David Burke Kitchen for RW last week. I love how, unlike other restaurants, they basically offered their entire menu for RW sans a few items. More options is always a plus. Also, the service is excellent. Our waitress (I forget her name) was super friendly, attentive and helpful.My friends and I ordered the Pastrami Salmon and the Angry Octopus for our apps; the Pork Chop, Salmon and Short Rib pasta for our entrees; and the Chocolate Malt Cake, Oatmeal Raisin Sundae and Lemon Meringue Pie for our desserts.I tried my friends Pastrami Salmon, and although different in concept, it was nothing special. The Angry Octopus was very good though. It was just spicy enough to give your tongue a little zing, but not so spicy to wipe out your palate for the rest of the meal. The ham hock bean ragout was also an excellent accompaniment to mellow the spice of the octopus.The entrees were all fairly good. The skin on the Salmon, however, was only crisp on the edges, but otherwise flabby in the middle. Pork Chop was well cooked and I liked the Onion Rings it came with. Short rib was also well cooked--tender and moist, though the accompanying pasta a bit heavy and bland.Of the desserts, I would say I preferred the Pie or the Sundae. The malt cake, while moist, was too heavy with the buttercream in between. It likely would have tasted better if frosted with a mousse or jam filling instead.Overall, a 5 on the wait-service and a 3/4 on the food. The only major gripe I have is that they ""punished"" us for being late for our reservation by placing us in the smallest possible table in the place, and right next to a concrete pillar to boot when there were at least 4 more spacious tables around us that were empty our entire meal.",2,1,1,Susan C.,"Malden, MA",25,215,83

It was slightly spicy which I really enjoyed.  I believe there were about 12 - 15 mussels.  They were pretty fresh until the last one that was not opened.  It came with toasted bread on the side.  I love bread and dipping them into broths!

3.0,1/22/2013,"Restaurant Week Review - I like that their regular menu is given to us and most of it was included for restaurant week. Now I understand restaurant week is available so that we can try the different restaurants that we normally will wince a little paying so much for, so by no means am I complaining, but it was a nice change not to have a grumpy server switching out the menus to a little piece of paper with 3 options per course after hearing you're here for RW.The apps we ordered are absolutely delicious, the Market Salad isn't your average dinky appetizer salad, it had plenty of colors other than green to fill the plate. The Angry Octopus was tenderly cooked and had a good about of heat to it, mixed with the beans and ham hock layered on the bottom, quite nice.Main Course... I got the short Rib and Cavatelli with wild mushrooms and truffle cream, the mushrooms and sauce worked very nicely with the strong flavor of beef, but more than half the beef was dry, I wouldn't have been able to eat it without the sauce, and I had to leave some behind :(... I tried a bite of the Pork Chops, pretty tender, but looking at my boyfriend's plate in the end, all the meat near the bone was undercooked, like, ""raw raw"".... and had to be left in the plate as well.For desserts, we got the Chocolate Malt Cake - Super rich flavors to satisfy the sweet tooth, and a nice touch of caramel ice cream on the side to cut the double chocolate taste. The Winter Fruits and Sorbet - light and refreshing after a heavy meal.I'm not sure if it's due to the volume of customers for RW that our main courses were slightly off the ball, but it could have been better...",0,0,0,Gena F.,"Flushing, NY",13,27,0

3.0,1/7/2013,"Came here for brunch and can't really see what all the hype is about. I used a Groupon for brunch/lunch and am glad I didn't actually pay full price. It was a prix fixe menu and some of the things on it I wouldn't necessarily have chosen for myself, like the yogurt parfait and steel cut oatmeal. Blah. Even putting fancy ingredients into it couldn't save these always boring breakfast foods. Mains were eggs benedict on polenta with home fries as well as the miso glazed salmon. The eggs benedict was good but pretty much like one you can get at any brunch spot, and nothing special about the polenta cake or home fries. The miso glazed salmon was probably the highlight of the meal - perfectly cooked and delicately light yet flavorful. Dessert was pretty good - carrot cake and chocolate cake with Himalayan sea salt and popcorn. I think the presentation of the chocolate cake was better than it actually tasted - the guy brings out this big peach rock with no explanation before he artfully pours some chocolate syrup over it as a luge onto the cake. Cool, yes, but at the end of the day its just some chocolate cake with ice cream (and you really can't taste that fancy Himalayan sea salt).

Our waiter said that David himself makes the rock salt.  The best part after dinner is they give you a small package with two cookies inside :) I love getting little goodies like that.We returned as we purchased a Groupon Brunch deal.  The atmosphere was definitely different as it was really crowded & there was a huge Groupon rush crowd.  I'd suggest coming for dinner for a better experience.",1,0,1,Allie L.,"New York, NY",6,66,161

5.0,12/26/2012,"If our brunch was any indication, this was and will remain a worthwhile destination. Keeping in mind this is located in Soho, where the prices are high, the attitudes are elitist and the scenes are more important than anything else, this was a really refreshing change from what I expected.First and foremost, aside from perusing the menu briefly, I wasn't sure what to expect; David Burke is as qualified and attentive to details as any heavy-duty celeb chef out there, and every time we've visited his restaurants we've been impressed and rewarded by the experience. So we had very high hopes but that was, essentially, it.When we arrived -- several minutes late -- we were seated almost immediately and reviewed the brunch menu, which was really solid. We started with two starters -- a yogurt/berry parfait and the burrata. Two tips: first, while the yogury parfait was nice, the burrata was a 20 on a ten-scale -- incredible. And more than enough for two or three or four people to share. If you've never tried burrata, stop reading and go find some -- now (Eli's, Fairway, Murray's, The Internet).The grilled sourdough and olive oil as supporting players to the burrata were really amazing, and frankly I could have had that as my entree and been completely satisfied. In fact, just thinking about it makes me wonder why I'm bothering to write about it when, after a short train ride and donning some appropriate cold-weather clothing (not in that order, of course) I could just go and have some more.Yep, it's that good.Our entrees were the Kitchen Eggs Benedict and the Kitchen Omelet. Both were excellent. The former was a bit strange and not quite what I expected; it was tasty and I enjoyed it, but I was expecting piles of tastiness topped by a hollandaise and instead it seemed more like I was served potato cakes with sausage cooked in. Put another way, the polenta was sort of like a potato cake -- which makes sense -- but texturally and taste-wise it wasn't what I expected when I ordered it. Not a bad thing, of course, but not quite a great thing. Had I known I probably would have gone with the standard Eggs Benny, but no biggie.The omelet was wonderful -- we requested they do it with swiss and a touch of bleu in lieu of the ricotta, but it was cooked perfectly and was better than we expected.Desserts were interesting: we ordered the carrot cake and the Himalayan Caramel Salt Sundae. The former was a sophisticated version of holidays at home on a plate. That is to say that the dessert felt very homey, comforting and tasty, but wasn't rustic as if your Aunt Ethyl had a tough time extracting it from a 9x12 baking dish. Really nice. The Salt Sundae was served with chocolate caramel drizzled over a slab of pink Himalayan salt -- a tad gimmicky but presentation, I 'spose, is important too.Overall, I enjoyed the sundae -- it was incredibly sweet and sticky (though not excessively so in either category) featuring extremely very intense chocolate and caramel flavors. If weight loss (even mere dietary discipline) is a concern than avoid this dessert. However, if you plan on running a marathon within a week of consuming this dessert, knock yourself out ;-)Overall we were very impressed with everything -- the food was wonderful, the service was really outstanding, and the restaurant -- decor, cleanliness, etc. -- was basically beyond criticism. I'd consider doing away with the salt slab but beyond that, I can't see us not returning -- soon -- to visit again. I'm guessing lunch and dinner are just as wonderful as brunch proved to be, and I'm looking forward to confirming that.Definitely worth a visit -- or quite a few.",0,0,0,Boogie N.,"Manhattan, NY",39,151,10

All of us ordered different dishes so we could sample. We do enjoy eating out even though my wife is an excellent cook. We were impressed by the non-food part of the meal as well as the quality of the dishes that we were served. Perhaps some were turned off by the fact that Groupon users were asked to order off a special menu. But come on it's a first rate experience that many could not have been able to take advantage of or that the provider would not have offered otherwise. Contrary to others the service provided by the wait staff was 5 star and the food presentation was as well. I gave it 4 stars because of the lack of being able to order off the complete menu. I find eating Bunch at any Restuarant tricky and often disappointing unless they serve breakfast weekly ie. cookshop. Kudos for the money well spent on the design with photos of what I assume were local providers of the food ingredients. I would definitely return and recommend.

I'm not usually a fan of crab cakes, but thought that these pretzel crab cakes were awesome!

2.0,12/15/2012,"You make a deal with the devil when you purchase a Groupon. Either the food is decent and the service awful, or vice versa. You can't have it all. At DB Kitchen, we were made to feel like riffraff from the second we bared our Groupon at check in. I noticed a staffer offered to take the coats of the couple before us. Despite my having a long, cumbersome coat, no one extended the same offer, even as I struggled to wrap it over my chair, the bottom dragging on the floor. After ordering from the abbreviated Groupon menu, we asked to see the regular menu since we were dying to try the chicken liver appetizer. No one returned to follow up and ask if we wanted anything else, nor did anyone inquire if the meal was ok at any point. The waitstaff left my empty bloody mary on the table for most of the meal. No one asked if I wanted another, or coffee/tea with dessert.On the bright side, the food was above average for the most part. Both the oatmeal and yogurt appetizers were delicious and plentiful. The chicken and shrimp salad was massive and felt like a treasure hunt- under this leaf, goat cheese! Under this one, pecans! Over here, apples! The shrimp were delicious and perfectly cooked. The benedict entree on the other hand, was underseasoned and undercooked and there was no salt or pepper on the table to correct the situation. But the other flavors (spinach, bell pepper, tomato hollandaise) were spot on. For dessert, the himalayan rock salt sundae was super decadent. The ultimate mixture of sweet, salty, crunchy, and creamy. I enjoyed the waiter pouring the caramel over rock salt onto the sundae. Nice touch. That was the only remotely thoughtful gesture of the entire meal. I'd be curious to come back without a deal to see how the other half lives.",1,1,0,Reina G.,"San Francisco, CA",88,155,14
4.0,12/10/2012,"It seemed that I was fated to come here. Where do I begin? How about that it's in the -James- Hotel? Already an auspicious sign! How about the fact that I noticed it for the first time on my way to my birthday celebration, only to have a friend suggest it for dinner mere days later? I am thankful someone mentioned it because I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here. We started with an Angry Octopus and White Bean appetizer that was was well cooked, had just a hint of spice (closer to mildly irritated than angry), and just a bit of aromatic tartness. It paired very well with the salty richness of the ham hock infused white beans.Feeling protein heavy, I went in with one of my dining companions on the porterhouse for two, along with two sides, jalapeno french fries fried in smoked beef fat, and more white beans. The steak was good, it had the livery flavor that you would expect from a 45 day dry age, but some of it was a bit over for medium rare. I expected a more even cook in a restaurant of this caliber. I would have wanted some more impact from the jalapenos on the fries but the smoked beef fat definitely infused a richness that allowed it to stand out from the oceans of other fried potato products out there. A winner!So what made this place special was the feel of the restaurant itself. It lacked the intimidation factor of a restaurant with David Burke's name on it. The service was superb and the environment felt inviting. Sometimes, having an inclusive vibe really does elevate the dining experience simply by making you feel comfortable. David Burke's Kitchen succeeds in spades in that respect.",0,0,0,James L.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",42,9,1

2.0,12/4/2012,"Brought a group of 6 for a late lunch last Friday.  In sum, a mind blowingly hilariously bad service experience, I would say the worst I have had in any restaurant in any city in America.  The 2nd star is for the prix fixe menu food, which was fairly good, although uneven.Arrive around 1:15 with no reservation and get seated, so a plus for that, I suppose.  Our server appears about 15 minutes later.  Not a good start.  We order a variety of drinks, several of us choose bloody mary's.  About 10 minutes later, we note our server go behind the bar (which had no current bartender, but looked quite impressive) and look around anxiously.  He eventually selected 4 white wine glasses, into which he dumped varying amounts of vodka, premade bloody mary mix and liberal amounts of tabasco.  These were served unstirred and tasted like a shot of tabasco, in a wine glass.  Fortunately, they only cost $10 a piece.  The coffee was good and only took about 25 minutes to get to the table.We all ordered from the prix fixe menu, choice of 2 of 3 from app, entree, dessert.  1.5 hours later, we were waiting for the dessert choosers final entrees to come out.  Our server had disappeared for the umpteenth time, and had failed to bring desserts or checks for the last 20 minutes.  Some in the party had left for other obligations.  Asked the manager how someone accomplished paying for a meal when the check would not come.  He printed out the check, handed it to us and left.  Seating until finally being able to pay took 2 hours and 10 minutes for a 2 course meal in a relatively uncrowded restaurant.I will say that the chicken and leek quiche was pretty damn tasty, though.",0,0,0,Jeff L.,"Kansas City, MO",0,4,0

3.0,11/25/2012,"I was hopeful that I would receive an awesome brunch meal at this famous Chef's restaurant, setting in this gorgeous establishment. It is spacious and the wood tables and ceilings make me feel I was in a giant cabin with warm cider in my hand. But I didn't feel that way once I sat down. We had a Groupon deal for 3-course brunch deal for two. We got the Groupon-only brunch menu, which is quite limited for the items we can choose from. Our waiter seemed rather busy that he barely gave us any attention and when he did, it was not with any sort of smile. Their house bread was very buttery and good. We started with a fresh berry yogurt parfait and oats with brown sugar. The parfait is good but it seems rather impossible to go wrong with yogurt and fresh fruit. The oats dish is good too but then again, it is hard to screw up cooked oats especially with brown sugar! For entree, I got the Egg Benedict with Polenta. It is underwhelming. The Hollander sauce was bland and the polenta is supposed to contain sausage but I tastes none of that. So either the sausage is grinded so fine you can barely taste the texture and flavor or they simply forgot to put it in there? My husband had the Salmon and it is better than my dish although the middle of the salmon looks rather rare to me. We ended our brunch with their dessert special. The sundae was pretty good. It comes with their special sea salt on top of Chocolate ice cream. We were both stuffed and had to wait for our check for forever. Oh did I mention that there was a long wait after our appetizer came? The restaurant Manager was walking around looking busy but he failed to notice our hungry eyes staring at him, implying we were waiting impatiently for our entree? He failed to notice of course. Also, the deal said it is up to $96 value but we only got about $70ish worth of menu price. They sneakily failed to put item price on that special menu, probably trying to trick you into tipping the full value that you would never reach based on the menu they provide. I don't think I am coming back for this underwhelming food, lukewarm service and lack of transparency.",6,1,2,Athena C.,"San Francisco, CA",1008,1619,761

Also, the short rib in my short rib and cavatelli dish, was cooked to perfection.  And now for the disappointing parts:  the waiter completely failed to take my husband's order,  the lobster soup lacked flavor, the pork shank lacked flavor,  the jalapeno French fries were cold, and the odd mystery item on my cavatelli was soggy. I'm pretty sure it was supposed to be crunchy for texture. If not, then the dish really didn't need it. It was sort of thrown on top of the dish in the corner of the plate. No biggie but I just didn't understand why it was even there. The brussels sprouts were just OK. I could roast better Brussels sprouts st home. My dinner mates were equally disappointed with their food. David.Burke, you need to do some quality control at this location. This place is over rated.

4.0,11/18/2012,"Disclaimer: Came here with a $39 Groupon for brunch.First off, I love the design of this place.  It's sophisticated but rustic with lots of wood and light and I loved the soft blue and white checkered napkins and farm pictures on the wall.  As soon as we sat down, we had water and popovers flavored like everything bagel with creamy butter on a slab of Himalayan salt placed in front of us.  We placed our orders quickly and I supplemented the Groupon with a $5 bloody mary and, subsequently, a $5 mimosa.  Both made with fresh ingredients and a bargain at $5. For appetizers, we both got the steel cut oats with cinnamon meringue and white raisins.  I LOVED the cinnamon meringue.  I want to buy them in bulk to put on my oatmeal every morning.  For our main courses, I got the Kitchen Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend got the Marscapone Stuffed French Toast.  Tthe other options on the menu were a salmon and a chicken and shrimp salad - the tables next to us got those and they seemed very satisfied.Both of our plates looked incredible - pictures attached (please note that my boyfriend couldn't even wait for me to take the picture before he dug into my side of potatoes).  Keeping in line with my expectations, the Eggs Benedict really were great! Perfectly gooey poached eggs, a crisp cheddar-y bread and some yummy spinach.  I noticed I still had some spinach stuck in my teeth an hour later (awesome), but I suppose I won't hold that against them.  I could have used a bit more hollandaise though, I like my eggs benedict soaking in the stuff.  My bites of the french toast were also tasty, I loved the marscapone but couldn't really taste the advertised strawberry consommee (maybe it was left off the plate?).  Still really good though.  And I loved the fresh raspberries on the side.Though I was already stuffed, when dessert came out, I made room for my molten carrot cake with a liquid cream cheese center.  The only less-than-perfect note was that my ice cream was half melted and the flavor wasn't very strong.  Still very good though.  My boyfriend's  brownie sundae thing with salted caramel poured off a salt luge (picture attached) looked great as well but it was devoured before I could steal a bite.  The verdict from him was ""heaven on earth.""

Yogurt parfaits like this happen to be my favorite for breakfast and Greek yogurt my favorite of all yogurts so I enjoyed this appetizer thoroughly (although I prefer the nonfat kind, this was creamy and richer tasting so I'm suspecting it had fat). Next, I had the Kitchen Eggs Benedict (two poached eggs on top of a crisp Italian sausage polenta, garlicky spinach, and tomato hollandaise). Liked the flavor, good presentation, and pretty filing.I ended the meal with the Himalayan Rock Salt Sundae (milk chocolate malt ice cream, caramel corn, salted caramel luge). They first brought the dessert dish over and then brought the caramel sauce separately, pouring the sauce onto a slate of Himalayan rock salt which would then fall onto the dessert (It's supposed to impart a delicate salt flavor on wet ingredients).

We had the yoghurt, the oatmeal (the only 2 options available!!! yikes), eggs benedict, french toast and the cheesecake lollipop tree. Nothing stands out at all - in fact, we didn't even finish the yoghurt and oatmeal. Yoghurt was room temperature, nothing special. Oatmeal is just.. oatmeal. We paid an extra $10 to get the cheesecake lollipops, not sure what the hype is about.. they are too sweet and no taste of a cheesecake at all! FAIL. The only saving grace is the $5 cocktails they have - should have spent the extra $10 on 2 more drinks and my experience here might be better.",1,1,1,Kaimin N.,"Singapore, Singapore",30,143,17

3.0,9/23/2012,"I just couldn't really get behind this place and recommend it to anyone as a must go. I was looking for a nice 'date night' type spot that had an outdoor area, good food, and was a little fancy. Up popped this place on my Yelp search profile. I'd heard of it before so thought it'd be good for a Saturday night in early September. While I don't have anything bad to say about the experience, I don't have many praises for it either. We arrived for our reservation and were immediately seated upstairs on the 2nd floor patio area. It looked cool in the pictures and might be a good day hangout in nice weather, but it wasn't anything special this evening. It was a bit chilly out and there are bright fluorescent floodlights all around so it doesn't do much for the atmosphere. The bar area in the back was hopping and that was a but if the problem. I was looking for a nice, tranquil respite for a meal but there was a party at the bar. Since the bar was past our table anyone going to/from the bar or the restroom would be walking by our table so there was a constant shuffle. Another table asked to be reseated (that might've been the chilly weather also), but we decided to continue because we were determined to dine outside. The food was decent, but there are no notable items on the menu.  Your standard meat, chicken, or fish dish existed on a pretty short list. I ended up having the fancy burger because it was the only thing I was in the mood for, but it was no better than something you'd get at a place like Bareburger. One of the other things that threw me was that the atmosphere and dress suggested that this was a trendy chic place to go to.  I think this applied to most patrons, but it's definitely not a requirement. Furthermore the waiters all wore basic polo shirts and aprons so it didn't seem very decadent at all. For the higher price point for food, lack of ambiance with the bright lights and noise, and the fair quality of food I can't say this is a place worth dropping a lot of cash for.Perhaps I'd return during the day for a drink, but having the outdoor area only on the 2nd floor didn't make me feel transported to some hidden oasis. The traffic noise was distracting and there is no view. You'd be better off finding a drink at a hotel bar with a real rooftop.",0,0,0,Albert H.,"Chicago, IL",29,85,4
2.0,9/23/2012,"Had high hopes for this place given the name and thought we scored a decent brunch with the Groupon deal ($40 for two prix fixe 3-course brunches). Got there at 11 for 11:30 reservation - got us seated anyway, fantastic. Seating was in the ""tree-top"" terrace. Due to local weather microenvironment, there was a constant, ""cool"" ""breeze"" (for those of us not accustomed to dining in the Ice Palace, I'd call it freezing, unabating gusts) that had one party cancel their reservation upon experience and a healthy dose (2 or 3 parties) of musical tables trying to catch the sun. I understand the establishment doesn't control the weather, but a couple of well-placed heating torches would've prevented all this, but I think the management must've never been up there or use it as a punishment for underperforming servers and Groupon cheapskates. The Groupon menu was restricted, which was fine, but the server made sure we knew it and gave us a full menu in case we wanted to man up and pay more. Or at least that was the impression that I got. We ordered the oatmeal for starters (yogurt parfait, the other option, would've been torture in the cold), a stuffed French toast for me and poached egg and sausage polenta for milady, and a carrot cake for her and Himalayan rock salted caramel ice cream (figured itd be fine since its the end of the meal and we'd be moving around thereafter). And two coffees. First they brought some bread-muffin and olive oil to the table which must've been really expensive since we each got one piece (size of a mini-cupcake) and they never came by to give more during the 25-30 minutes or so we waited between appetizer and entree. But it was quite delicious and certainly whetted my appetite. That or my shivering (mind you I was wearing a thermal zip-hoodie fully zipped and long track pants) burned through those calories very quickly. In any event, the oatmeal came and was definitely not your grandma's oatmeal. The individual kernels were separate and masticatible, as if they were undercooked, but I think they're just distinct. There was also a chewy piece of styrofoam-like substance on top that rounded out the explosion of texture and til now (more than 12h later) still blowsy mind. At some point the coffee came. Kinda blah, slightly bitter,  and we made the mistake of asking for a second fill (to keep warm) - because it took about 10 minutes and the person was definitely not happy and gave us death stares. At least the second cup I was able to enjoy as two beverages - hot coffee and iced coffee, as it had a cold-brewed, refreshing ice coffee taste and temperature after 10-15minutes between the pour and me finishing my stuffed French toast. That was one thing that was actually cooked well and I have no complaints about. The fruits that came with the French toast, however, came with a piece of plastic from the box (I think) from which the berries were picked. Good thing I like to play with my food before eating it. I'm sure they actually wash the fruits and this just didn't get washed off for some reason. So by this time we were already quite a bit behind our set schedule (around 12:30 for muffin-bread, coffee, oat kernels, and stuffed French toast surprise) so we politely asked our server to change my ice cream to carrot cake ad it to go. ""I'm afraid they won't let me switch the dessert"" was his response. I guess I must've been the only person to order this extravagant dessert and they had to send someone to the Himalayas to chip away the salt or something! I was impressed and said ok sure. The table right next to us got theirs so we were able to see it - they pour the caramel sauce over a handheld slab of pink Himalayan rock salt to drizzle onto the ice cream. Cool gimmick, but I don't understand why they couldn't just change the order - it's ice cream, brownie and the sauce isn't even on there before they bring it table side! So another 3 minutes later and the dessert guy came over with the same slab of rock salt - the caramel sauce wasn't even washed off of it! And did the same trick of pouring the sauce onto the already sauced salt slab. I know it's clean and everything but how long does it take to clean it??! The ice cream tastes like delicious Hagen Daz and was worth the hassle and being late. The brownie was similarly forgettable. Or, at least I think there was a brownie. After that the check came and I was pleased at the low cost of $10 for the two coffees since we got 1.5 cups of hot coffee, 0.5 cups of iced coffee and a death stare apiece for the meager price. We left with our bellies full (after a New York hour's wait) and our hearts (but not bodies) warm. Probably not going there again. Oh, and the signage looks rusty.",8,4,1,Jeff L.,"Fremont, CA",24,33,13
2.0,9/23/2012,"I had pretty high hopes for this place and everything on the menu looked great. The food was really inconsistent - inexcusable for a place like this. The bacon wrapped dates were great, but the chicken liver was so so. The octopus was amazing - easily the best thing we had. The pretzel crab cake came out on the soggy side but was still okay. The short rib was basically inedible - way too sweet, almost syrupy. My date couldn't finish hers and I'll never let ribs go to waste, but I couldn't stomach more than a bite. The duck came perfect, but everything with it was awful. The egg was cold, the tart thing was gooey and just gross.Our server was nice and comped us cheescake lollipops for my date's bday.You don't always get what you pay for in this town and you definitely don't at DBK.

5.0,9/16/2012,"Had my first David Burke Kitchen ""experience"" last week and had an amazing meal and wonderful service.  For appetizers, I recommend the dumpling duo -  light and filled with flavors of  lobster  and short rib ones, the angry octopus was spicy and so tender and the pastrami salmon was delectable, with the pastrami melting on my tongue.  The star of the dinner to be sure was the porterhouse steak, aged for 65 days in Himalayan rock salt, grilled to perfection and carved table-side.  While the signature steak knives were great, they weren't needed since the meat was so tender ! Another very notable mention was the shrimp special (who knew shrimp even grew that large?), served with the most wonderfully creamy, light as air, fresh and bright, corn flan I could have ever imagined.  I for one would like to request that Mr. Burke consider adding the corn flan to his menu as a signature side dish (btw -  mushroom side dish should not be missed).  Desserts were not only playful (donuts) but sinfully rich as well (carrot cake).  All in all, we had a great meal, great service and made a family memory!",1,0,0,Judy S.,"Bronx, NY",0,19,1

2.0,9/3/2012,"Let me start out by saying that I'm a big fan of DB and his other restaurants in the city. They do an especially good Restaurant Week, allowing you to choose from most of the menu with a slight supplement for more expensive dishes. The venues are usually pretty cool too. Unfortunately, I had not so great of an experience this past Thursday and I hope that I can be back for a better experience (and a happier review update!). Here's what went wrong after we ordered our food:No drinks after 30 minutesNo appetizers 45 minutes later (we asked and they said it will be out shortly)...1 hour later we finally get our appetizers (something about the printer paper being out)Also see both soft shell crab AND pork/scallops dishes go by which I didn't see on the menu so I ask if they were part of some other menu/dinner event. Nope, they were specials which we were not informed of. Sadness because crab and scallops are two of my favorite things and I most definitely would have ordered themWe pointed this out to the manager and he kindly brought out an order of soft shell crab which I figured at this point would be on the house (spoiler alert: it was not)They forgot our duck fat fries altogether...After all of this, all we received complimentary was a small piece of fluke crudo as an amuse bouche and not even an apology from our server...Anyway...my company was excellent and the food, once we received it, was actually very good.

4.0,8/28/2012,"Brought a group of 6 friends during Restaurant Week but on a weekend so we experienced the standard menu. Got there first and waited for a few moments at the bar, friendly bartender and good people all around me.The presentation here is excellent. There is a discreet door on the street, followed by a short set of stairs down to the restaurant of the James Hotel. The room is oddly shaped, something of a pizza slice; we were seated near the 'point' and therefore quite close to the kitchen. It's nicely lit, not too dark to see your food but calm enough to create a nice environment for good conversation. The waiter was polite, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu -- when I glanced around, all the waiters seemed to be genuinely smiling which is rare enough in itself.Had the salmon, preceded by a hummus plate to get things started. Don't remember what my companions chose, but everyone was satisfied as we left.One negative thing to add, however. We had a group of seven with six arriving within ten minutes of each other. Our seventh ended up being more than half an hour late, and the hostess positively refused to seat us until our entire group was here. There was one other group our size there so I fully understand that she wanted to get a full group seated, but a half hour wait for no reason with a table available borders on absurd. Neither group was seated promptly; the other people waited only five minutes less than we did.

Ordered: Apps:- Tuna tartar taco - it was ok, tuna was nicely marinated.- Jar of Chicken liver and pistacho - Although I love my livers, this was too heavy. - Smoked pastrami Salmon - Another dish that didn't sit quite well, the smoked salmon was good, but they ruined it with a bitter salad and the trout roe was sour.Sides:- Jalapeno Fries - Meh, that is all.- Mac and Cheese - My saving grace of the meal. Boy this was a serious mac and cheese. And by serious I actually mean delicate. The cheese was not overpowering at all, though I didn't particularly like the shells, they had nice big chunks of thick cut bacon. Flavor was rich and savory. Dessert:- Arnold Palmer - Was interesting, rasberries were very sour, contrasting with shaved lemon icee over really frozen tea ice cream. First bite was good, got sick of it towards teh end.- Almond pie - This was delicious, although the crust tasted like thawed, prefrozen pie crust, but the flavor and the texture was very good.What killed out meal -  Main:- Crackling pork shank - I was so excited about this dish, heard so many amazing things about how juicy and tender the meat was while contrasting with the crispy skin. First two bites, the pork cut up my throat. The meat was so dry that even the parts with fat were still inedible. I dug through the whole plate but everything was completely dry. So when I mention it to the waiter, he said that's how pork has to be when we roast it and oven it for that long, it's suppose to be a little dry. Completely unacceptable answer becuase...- Porkchops -  Were completely RAW. We weren't sure in the beginning becuase it was a little dim. They provided my husband with a non-serated knife and he was unable to cut through the meat at all. When I finally offered him mine from the pork shank (mini cleaver) he was still having difficulties cutting becuase when we cut it up, it was dark pink and soft on the inside. Pork should NOT be served pink. Husband took a couple of bites thinking it might be a fluke, but had to stop becuase it just didn't taste good.So two days later...

I am told that that is a signature of the David Burke brand. We had brunch at the David Burke Kitchen in SoHo, dining in the treehouse. At times--sublime, others--disappointing; overall the experience was uneven. The appetizer was the star of the day. The Tuna Tartare Tacos, with whipped avocado and spicy tobiko were every bit as compelling as it sounds. Served in a miniature metal cradle--with limes, the three small tacos belied the awaiting outsized savory delight. Hard shell corn tortillas were stuffed with rare tuna, covered by a creamy avocado that added a richness, refreshment, and level of complexity, and topped with spicy tobiko (a bright orange roe), creating a flavor sensation that sent your taste buds on a joyride! Unfortunately, the chef did not rise to the occasion on the entrée. The Black Sea Bass, fatigued by overcooking (a bit dry) and too much salt, rested on a bed on sautéed spinach, charred plum tomatoes, and sliced olives. Although compelling, this palate pleasing combination was unable to resuscitate the dish.The service was what you would expect--excellent, but it was disappointing that they had sold out of the Sam Adams Summer Ale on draft.

4.0,8/13/2012,"So I love brunch!  Brunch is just one of those great things that New York has to offer.  Yeah, LA tries to do brunch, but fails miserably at it.  I know, I know...it's not LA's fault.  You have to drive everywhere, and we all know that the best part of brunch is the mimosa, and most of us don't want to risk a DUI.  Anyway, back to the review...David Burke Kitchen is a great spot for brunch!  I'm a huge fan of David Burke Townhouse, so I assumed that DB Kitchen would be as good.  I was right.This cool spot is located in SoHo just kissing Tribeca.  Not necessarily a ""happening"" location, but who cares...it probably keeps the crowds away.I LOVE the architecture here.  Very modern and clean, with really cool, interesting wood beams and wood finishing.  The tables are very cool, too, as well as the dishes and silverware.  They already sucked me in with their design.The food was great!  It was delicious, not over the top expensive, and their mimosas were delish.  I had the Stuffed French Toast with mascarpone and strawberry consume.  The toast was sooo light and fluffy, and the mascarpone added that creaminess and the strawberries just took it over the top!  Absolutely loved it.The service was very good.  The staff was attentive, and friendly.  I really loved this place, and plan to come back for dinner.",0,0,0,Jayson O.,"San Francisco, CA",223,157,13
3.0,8/11/2012,"This place was small. but it is a restaurant inside or part of the hotel next door. A little noisy. The complimentary starters was good. the carrot was sour. but the potato mushroom looking thing is great.For summer restaurant week, I had the tomato and crab gazpacho it was gooood. The tuna tartare tacos were good (small though but filling) Entrees I had short rib, it was moist and good but the sides are wierd for me... tiny fried onions with some sort of corn and shrimp salsa thing. My friend had lamb chops with couscous it was good. The brick chicken was worth it was huge. So guys dont get the short ribs if you are hungry. Dessert was okay.

My porkchop was a bit dry when i ask for medium but the waitress was willing take it back after asking me how was my pork chop, but i kept it anyways. The amazing huge onion ring and mango chutney was so great that came with the pork chop. My crab cake was different, not your ordinary crab cake cuz it came with cold broth/soup. The trout was very smokey but a bit dry again. The dessert was to died for. Strawberry shortcake in a tall glass and raspberry pied was surpringsly good, all the food was beautifully plated.

This truly provided the consumer to sample a meal that fit their liking, more so than fell within their limits. The service was great. Our waitress, Bri, was very attentive and helpful, but also gave us our space as well. The ambiance was great for catching up with friends, a date, or even drinks. I had the Pretzel Crab cake appetizer. Interesting take on a crab cake, but pretzel straws on top of a crabcake was rather tastey. The short rib was fantastic, no further explanation needed.

3.0,8/8/2012,"Came here for restaurant week with a few girlfriends. My favorite dish of the meal was the pretzel crab cake, which I ordered after reading all the raving Yelp reviews. The short ribs were alright, I didn't really enjoy the fried crispy ""angry"" onions that were served on the side. The corn succotash that came with the short ribs didn't seem fresh, which is inexcusable given we are in peak corn season. Strawberry shortcake dessert in a glass was pretty good, nothing to write home about.

I was there last Labor Day and was lucky that they extended their restaurant week. I picked this restaurant randomly just to try it out. And I want to say that they are awesome! I actually got there early and found out that I had reserved the outside seating by accident. The hostess was nice and helpful and rearranged our table. Had a few drinks at the bar and everything was good. As for dinner, the server is well educated on the menu and really attentive. He answered all our questions and didn't give us any hard time when we asked to modify our meals. Food was awesome, can't remember what I ordered but everyone at the table were happy with their meal.

4.0,8/8/2012,"A group of friends and I went to David Burke Kitchen as part of the summer Restaurant Week deal. It was the first time I had been there and was very amazed by the decor and atmosphere. For one of the more upscale restaurants in town, it had a very vibrant and relaxed feel. Off the RW menu, I had the tuna tartare tacos for appetizer, the black bass as my entree and the frozen Arnold Palmer for dessert.The quality of the food was excellent and the tuna tacos were definitely my favorite appetizer (my friends got the crab cakes) because of the freshness and the quality of the tuna. Another standout was the frozen Arnold Palmer - one of the best desserts I have had (I'm not a big sweets person). The entree was good but could have been better. It did not really stand out as the other two courses.Overall great experience and great service; as we were 4 guys in the early stages of our careers, the waiter was kind enough and gracious enough to split the bill according to our orders.",0,0,0,Kyle S.,"Richmond, VA",27,2,0
4.0,8/7/2012,"came here for dinner during restaurant week, I ordered the pretzel crab cake, thought it was just okay but my friend loved it. It's a comfort food, creamy and warm with bits of salad mixed in crab cake and a small stack of pretz sticks on the top. My friend got the tuna tartare tacos and they were deliciouss! (3 mini tacos stuffed with tuna)For the main course I got the porkchop(+$5 extra on the RW price) with 2 chunky pieces of bacon, 2 onion rings and some chopped and cooked peach on the side, while my friend had the bricked chicken with string beans and beets. The chicken was really tender, and the flavor wasn't too heavy. As for my dish, my favorite part was actually the onion rings. They were greenish colored and by far the healthiest tasting onion rings I've ever had, not greasy at all. The bacon was pretty flavorful, it reminds me of those chinese style dry meat, chewy and interesting. The porkchop was pretty hard to cut into so you're going to need to put in some work if you plan to eat that, esp since their knifes aren't that sharp. The portions were huge, which was totally unexpected since we're used to seeing smaller sized dishes during restaurant week, so that was a pleasant surprise. Then for desserts, we got the strawberry shortcake (we had to try it since so many people loved it on yelp) and the frozen arnold palmer, I didn't think the desserts were that great. It could be because I was so full by the time we started eating them. Strawberry shortcake had layers of sweetened strawberries (those you would get in the strawberry syrup) and whip cream, cake batter, sprinkles, some more whip cream and strawberry syrup at the bottom. I couldn't tell what was in the frozen arnold palmer, but it was definitely a weird combination of sweetness and sourness. Sort of like a slush, the ice on the top is more tart and the bottom tea just tastes like lipton tea with some mousse in between. I wouldn't recommend it.

5.0,8/7/2012,"I have now been to DBK five times in the past year. Ok, maybe six.. Anyway, every time, it's been a grand slam. And that's really where and why I give them the five stars. CONSISTENCY. The kitchen and staff's performance is on point with creativity and quality over a year's period of time. So let's talk attentiveness: there are people in blue shirts almost everywhere, it seems; refilling water glasses, whisking away finished plates and making themselves available. The manager, whom I know now on a first named basis is gliding around checking in with the servers and tables. Yes, he may have hooked my table up with their new brunch pop-overs twice (even though it was dinner time). But they are SO good! Now most importantly, DBK is inventive! I love their nonconformist menu for RW. The last thing I want to see is another chilled summer salad, roasted chicken breast or chocolate molten cake (disappointed sigh). DBK gives options dressed with creativity and presented with quite imagination. Also, one of the servers was walking around with scissors and fresh sprigs of rosemary, thyme and oregano to snip off onto your dish. My last pearls of wisdom are to TRY THE MONKEY BREAD. It's pretty much life changing. Oh, and brunch is awesome too.",0,0,0,Virginia R.,"New York, NY",138,146,478

These items came out immediately and I think all the dishes are just continually prepared, not prepared to order.Mains: Short ribs were surprisingly dry but I like the peach sauce and the corn side, My aunt had the sea bass which was a tiny portion. Dessert: I got the Drunken brownie island - brownie was also surprisingly dry! And the mint ice cream tastes like menthol. My aunt asked for a non-dairy dessert and they let her swap sorbets for her dessert which was very accommodating.Overall they are pros and don't make you feel like second class citizens for coming for restaurant week, however I think the focus on quantity of diners over quality results in second class versions of their food during RW.",1,0,0,Lila C.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,78,0

3.0,8/6/2012,"Great way to (almost) end restaurant week. Came here with a few friends for dinner, and were seated promptly. Our waiter was efficient but not too pushy, and we happily ordered a wine off their special list (great deal!) and our RW courses. The asparagus and burrata salad was a great way to start--although it's hard to go wrong with a huge hunk of cheese on your plate. I liked the combination of ingredients--especially the unexpected watermelon. I was also able to nab a bite of the tuna tacos, which I found tasty but not particularly unusual. Then on to the suckling pig, which was the Sunday night special and available for restaurant week. I have to agree with others--skip the suckling pig. It was (sadly), rather dry. The sides, however, were great--especially the corn and tomato medley. There was also a small amount of pulled-pork like meat on the plate, which was actually far more tender and interesting than the main portion. My friends really enjoyed their entrees though, so I think I'll just try something else next time. For dessert, I tried the frozen Arnold Palmer. I don't know that it would have been my first pick normally, but some allergy issues left it as the only choice. Luckily, it was really enjoyable. I liked the raspberries and lemon-ice on the top layer, and found the bottom layer of ice-tea...well..I'm not sure. Ice-tea flavored cream? Or something similar. In any case, refreshing and tasty. Overall, a great meal..and I'd certainly head back for a non-restaurant week meal.

3.0,8/6/2012,"I went here for restaurant week. Looking at the regular menu and prices, the prixe fixe menu was totally worth it. Food - The tuna tacos and crab pretzel were amazingggg appetizers. The pork chop entree was a little tough to cut but the ribs were cooked to perfection, the meat seriously can off the bone is so easily and so moist. Dessert was good, the strawberry shortcake parfait was quite interesting with a fried strawberry in top. The tall glass that it came in though made it hard to eat and quite messy.Service - The appetizers came out super quick but we had to wait almost 30mins after we finished our appetizers to get our entrees. At the end of the night though our waiter did give us little complimentary boxes of cookies with our check so that was a nice touch. The table next to us didn't get them. Atmosphere - We had reservations in a Friday night at 10:30. It was pretty busy and the atmosphere was upbeat. As our dinner progressed, we noticed the music was really eclectic, from muse to maroon 5, not what I expected at a restaurant that requires ""dressy"" attire. The tables were also too close for comfort. I felt like I was a part of the conversation at the next table 10 inches away.I'm not sure if I would go back after restaurant week though and pay regular price for dinner.

I've seen the likes of these tacos for years at any variety of restaurants.  The black sea bass was cooked perfectly, and presented on a bed of spinach with shrimp, olives tomato & yellow pepper which was quite stunning.  The brick chicken was a wonderful throwback, I haven't seen it on a menu in years.  And I've never had it cooked so well.  It was seasoned perfectly, moist & juicy, had just the right amount of crunch, and was complimented well with a beet salad and green beans.  The highlight was the milanese egg, which is a breaded and fried egg cooked to the same degree of runniness as a soft boiled egg.  What a treat.  I'd never had one before, nor had a heard of it.  For dessert we had the strawberry parfait, which would have been just another parfait if it hadn't been for the fried strawberry, which are referred to as poppers.  Another unexpected treat.  And the pie was scrumptious.I loved the simple, country cottage feel with the decor.  I really got the whole ""farm to table"" thing.  My son told me about the tomato wall hanging in the mens room.  I understand why it's kept in the mens room :o)I big winner for me.  Cant wait to go back.",0,0,0,Nancy C.,"Northport, NY",185,7,0
1.0,8/2/2012,"Went here last night with another couple. I would say this is definitely the worst restaurant week experience I've had thus far. I usually lower expectations during restaurant week anyways so really, it was pretty horrendous. Reservations at 9:30. Seated at 10:15. On top of that, numerous other parties who arrived after were seated before us. Peanut brittle made it more tolerable but dinner started poorly. I really hope our server was intoxicated because I can't fathom someone being so obnoxious and awkward sober. After we ordered, she made a comment about how we ordered so healthy and how we should order something more indulgent, incredibly judgmental and mocking. The asparagus burrata salad was delicious and very refreshing, slices of watermelon topped with proscuitto with burratta curds spilling all over. The salmon was mediocre, charred, under seasoned, generally unmemorable. The dessert was atrocious. Ordered the frozen Arnold Palmer, came out as shaved ice swirled with whipped cream, topped with blueberries and candied mint leaves. The shaved ice tasted nothing like Arnold Palmer, very sour, the blueberries were glittery, and the candied mint leaves were covered in large granules of sugar, completely overpowering the herb. The bad service and inedible dessert made this an all around bust. A friend said the food was mediocre at best outside of restaurant week.

4.0,8/1/2012,"Came here with friends for restaurant week and thought the food was delicious and a good portion size.For appetizers we got 2 crab cakes and tuna tartare tacos. I didn't try the tacos but my friend said they were good and they served her not just 1, but 3 tacos! The pretzel crab cake was also a decent size and very tasty. For entree they had a special of suckling pig which my friends ordered, but I got the short rib. I wish they had given me more short rib, especially since the suckling pig portion was huge. The ribs were quite tender though, which I liked and the shrimp succotash that came with it was enjoyable. I tried my friend's pig and it was good, although I'm not sure I could have taken eating so much pig. The skin of the pig was also too hard/crispy and was hard for them to eat.For dessert we got 2 strawberry parfaits and 1 brownie. The parfaits were delicious and included a strawberry popper on top and some confetti cake inside. It was my favorite of the 2 desserts. The brownie was ok and went well with the mint chocolate ice cream that came with it, but after the brownie had been sitting there a bit it got extremely hard and we couldn't eat it anymore. The brownie also came with a chocolate covered cherry pop? It tasted a bit like cough medicine inside to me...Overall though I had a nice time.

3.0,8/1/2012,"This review is only based on my summer RW experience last night.The restaurant is one level down from ground level but there's enough natural light that comes in so you don't feel like you are in a basement. There's definitely some modern farmhouse inspiration going on with their signature rabbit weather vane outside and the cute blue and white picnic checker linens. The walls were adorned with images agricultural suppliers. I like how it ties into their farm-to-table concept.  One of the main reasons i wanted to try this restaurant is because I've really wanted to eat at one of David Burke's restaurants and the RW menu options were pretty extensive and the same as the regular menu.  I'm always a little skeptical about RW but figured 'what the hey' and it was a good time to get the girlfriends together for dinner.The complimentary bread basket had some fresh bread, pretzel sticks and pickled carrots. Cute presentation but nothing impressive. They also serve their butter on a slab of pink salt. For apps our table ordered crab cakes, tuna tartare tacos, pastrami lox and I had the crab gazpacho. The apps weren't bad and the portions were full sized.The menu also features blue plate special of the day which happened to be Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Cheese grits. I thought it was pretty cool that you could order it as a part of the RW menu.2 people ordered the fried chicken, 2 of us had short rib, 1 sea bass and 1 pork chop.The fish was definitely the smallest portion of all the entrees. I don't know why they use such a  large plate to accentuate the fact you are already getting a small filet of fish.My short rib was very tender with very little fat but flavors were just okay. I usually love shrimp but the accompanying shrimp succotash was really underwhelming and crispy onions felt like they were just added for good measure b/c there was barbeque sauce on the dish.The fried chicken plate was huge but I don't think my friends found it to be spectacular. I had a taste and thought the meat was moist and batter crisp. Our waitress really wanted us to spend more as she kept asking if we wanted drinks and then suggested we also order the jalapeno fries and mac and cheese and to top it all off at the end of the evening said that our gratuity (20%) was included in the bill but we were welcome to give her more. WTH?!  We did end up ordering sides. The basket of fries were so small and nothing special except the homemade ketchup but who orders fries just for the ketchup?Mac and cheese was actually pretty good as were the mushrooms we got. If you order 3 sides its $18 versus $7 each.Dessert-- most of us got the strawberry parfait. I enjoyed it but wished it wasn't in such a tall glass since it was hard to get everything into one scoop. My friend who ordered the Arnold Palmer really disliked her desert.Overall, I think its a nice restaurant but I don't think I would come back to pay full price for the type of food you get.",2,0,0,Lisa F.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",164,278,289
4.0,8/1/2012,"5 for ambiance in the treehouse bar. 3 for service. Food was 4.Went for restaurant week with party of 5. Made reservation 2 weeks in advance. I have been reading on yelp that all David Burke restaurants seem to be running really behind during restaurant week, and we had that experience at fish tales, so I did expect to wait. We had cocktails in the treehouse bar while waiting and waited for about 45 minutes before they finally sat us in one of the cabanas in the outdoor bar. You normally can't get the restaurant week menu outside but an exception was being made that night due to the long wait. Ambiance in the outdoor area is really nice. It's like a little oasis in the city, very relaxing and cocktails were delicious. Food---reiterating what others have said here already, the pretzel crabcake was delicious. The crab and tomato gazpacho was creamy and flavorful. For the entrées, 2 people in our party got the pork chop two had the shortrib and 1 trout. The pork chop was a generous portion and was succulent and delicious. The short rib was not the best short rib I've had: while the meat was tender and fell apart with just a pull of your fork, it was not that flavorful. The accompanying succotash was more interesting. The trout was probably the best of these entrees. Good sized portion, light and flavorful. Of the deserts, no one was too impressed. The brownie was dry as others have written here before. The strawberry shortcake was a glass full of whipped cream. But that's ok since we were so full from the meal. As for the service, our waiter was very rushed, and was obviously annoyed by questions we had concerning items on the menu.It seems like the general consensus on yelp would be to return after restaurant week.",0,0,0,Liz D.,"Oakland, CA",48,70,159

4.0,7/31/2012,"My friends and I arrived here with an 8:00pm reservation completely famished. Immediately we were seated (I snacked on their free toffee brittle because I barely ate all day!) and then we were given a bread basket of assorted goodies. The bread and butter, although displayed in an aesthetically pleasing manner, turned out to disappoint us. The bread was mediocre, the butter was bland, and carrots came with an offputting seasoning.I did enjoy their amazing Pretz sticks, probably made by Meiji [the same company that makes Pocky, a common Japanese snack], which led us to our appetizers. My friend and I ordered the Pretzel crabcakes and they were absolutely perfect, exuding a refinement and brilliant execution. Cutting through the crisp salty Pretz frames and swallowing the view of moist, sweet crabcakes inside this structure was a grand experience. My friend on the other hand ordered the crab and tomato gazpacho which was too heavy handed on the herbs in the broth. The broth overwhelmed and absolutely ruined the natural flavors of the crab. It was a completely letdown.  I was concerned about her experience at this establishment and asked the waitress to change the appetizer for her. My friend then chose the smoked Pastrami salmon, which  she thought was too salty [she was still unhappy]. Therefore, I finished her appetizer. Frankly, it was to my preferences. I loved the myriad of flavors coming together-salty capers and caviar, intertwined with the tart green beans and asparagus, smoky mild salmon, and the refreshing lemon cream cheese to cut through the flavors made this classic dish work. Then my friend [the one doubly unsatisfied with her apps] ordered the short rib and corn salad. She was finally pleased and so was my friend who ordered the succulent pork chop, mango chutney, and onion rings. I wanted to keep it light [I did not enjoy the flakiness of short rib nor the underriped diced mangos in the pork chop dish] and ordered the black sea bass. It came out perfectly! A well cooked fat piece of fish over a bed of seasoned spinach, some sweet buttery shrimp on top of the bass, and tart artichokes tasted wonderful and well-portioned. I am sure both of my friends enjoyed their dishes but I would have not been satisfied with a medium cooked pork chop. I recommend the sea bass if you want a decent, light meal. Unfortunately, my friend ordered the chop wanted mac and cheese, which she did not even eat because she believed my portion was too small {actually...her chop was too large!} and I ended up finishing it. This side dish was good but not great. It was a tad too oily and greasy. After polishing off the mac and cheese [expensive and not even amazing as a side] we were left with dessert. My dish, the Key Lime pie with mango sorbet looked sleek and decadent. The same pleasing profiles paralleled with my friends' brownie plate and strawberry parfait. It is absolutely mandatory for me [imperative actually] to tell you fellow Yelpers NOT to order the Key Lime Pie. This 'Slice-a-Pie de Jour' was possibly the worst dessert I've ever tasted in my life. The lime curd  inside this slice was overwhelmingly tart that it was positively inedible. Then, the sour cranberry or pomegranate sauce that came with it AND the tart mango sorbet took sour to a whole new level. Even the marshmallowy creme goodness on top of this pie could not save this dish. The balance of flavors were skewered so terribly that I had to confront a waiter, whom served my friend her drunken brownie a toffee sauce, to drown my pie in that sauce. Finally. The flavors began to work-a balance of sweet and tart. It did not last long. I barely got into half of this pie. This pie was a lost cause and almost ruined my dinner. Actually it almost did, since even with the RW deal, I had to pay almost usual price with a rancid taste in my mouth. Fortunately, my friend's soft birthday cake ice cream in her parfait successfully revived my palette. I would honestly give the restaurant a higher rating due to several advantages-quick service, affable waiters, impeccable casual but contemporary decor, and two stellar courses; however, I could not overlook my dessert, that disgusting bourbon lollipop on my friend's dessert plate or even the underriped mangos, and pre-app platter. Perhaps I was too lenient giving my experience four stars but I am willing to give this place a second chance. Maybe I'm a masochist...I still want to try that hyped Lollipop Tree!",6,3,3,Tina C.,"Plainview, NY",518,122,844
5.0,7/30/2012,"We came here on a Sunday night for restaurant week. We had a 6:30pm reservation.We arrived on time and were seated promptly to our table. Our server, Bradley, was phenomenal. When you have pleasant wait staff who actually explain the specials and know the menu and then check on you consistently throughout the night despite a packed house, it makes a HUGE world of difference and is greatly appreciated. We ate off the restaurant week menu with slight alterations due to some interesting menu items.They offered a $45 bottle of wine option with a half dozen or so different choices. We chose a Pinot Gris which was very good. For appetizers: We each ordered a different first course.The market salad with goat cheese, walnuts, escarole and bacon. There was a $5 supplement for the salad. This was a huge portion and the goat cheese was very tasty.The crab & tomato gazpacho with roasted corn, cilantro and lime crème fraiche. Great presentation as the dish was brought out with the lime creme fraiche topped crabmeat at the center and then the gazpacho poured around it at the table. My son enjoyed it and commented on the good amount of crabmeat he received and how tasty it was.I chose the pretzel crabcake due to the number of positive comments it received on here. I was not disappointed. The serving size was big and it was delicious. Loved the mustard glaze. For mains: The short rib with peach bbq, succotash and zucchini crisp. My mother enjoyed it and reported that the meat was very tender. We added 2 sides for the table: Asparagus with shallots and green bean amandine. Both were just OK. We wanted to make sure we had enough food to eat. We probably didn't need it and would've been fine without them.I had the sea bass with baby shrimp, spinach, tomato, olive and yellow pepper. It was an odd combination of flavors that I probably never would have put together if I cooked it at home but I enjoyed it. My son chose the lobster salad which was a $15 supplement to the restaurant week options. Wow..what a presentation. A pound and a half of lobster with quinoa served on sliced beets. He thought it was fantastic. For dessert:My mother and I both had the brownie with mint ice cream. The brownie was a little dry but I liked the caramel sauce that was poured on at the table and the mint ice cream was good. My son ordered the frozen Arnold Palmer. He drinks this and got a kick out of the dessert. He liked it.I would absolutely go back. The space was small but didn't feel crowded despite the restaurant being packed. The service was incredible and the food was presented beautifully and was delicious.",0,0,0,Jennifer V.,"South Brunswick Township, NJ",9,24,16
3.0,7/29/2012,"Came here for restaurant week and I have to say I was disappointed, especially after reading all the great reviews. My dining experience at David Burke Kitchen was just okay; nothing spectacular and nothing to rave about.My friends and I had 8:30 reservations but we had to wait until 9:10 to be seated. We were a bit miffed for the long wait but expected it since it was restaurant week. IMO the food was pretty mediocre. Although it wasn't bad, it wasn't very good either. My friends and I all all got the Prezel Crab Cake, and they all came to our table lukewarm. The pretzel sticks reminded me of Pretz, and although it made me have a moment of childhood nostalgia, it did not impress me. My pork chop was sooooo dry and hard. A vein was threatening to pop as I sawed through the meat. I ate half of it and sent the rest back. My friends say the short rib was fantastic though. If you order the sea bass, you will get a ridiculously small portion, so if you're hungry, don't order it.Fortunately, the key lime pie was really good. What saved the dinner from two stars was honestly the dessert, and the great company I had. I understand that it was restaurant week and DBK might be operating out of their element due to the overwhelming popularity, but still...I expected more.",1,0,0,Shireen L.,"Manhattan, NY",267,64,0
5.0,7/28/2012,"Everything I could have ever hoped for and more.I have had my eye on David Burke Kitchen for months, but I haven't had the funds for it, so when restaurant week came along, I knew I had to seize the opportunity. I made a reservation through open table 2 weeks in advance, and I'm glad I did. I arrived with my sister approximately 35 minutes before my reservation time. The hostesses were very accommodating, showing me to the bar and mentioning that we could possibly be seated earlier and she would alert us when our table was ready.Much to my surprise, since the restaurant was packed and there were other patrons waiting, we were seated 10 minutes before my reservation time. We were greeted quickly by our waitress, who was very pleasant. A few moments later our water glasses were full, and bread, butter, pretzel sticks, and pickled carrots were placed on our table. Everything was delicious, and the butter may have been some of the best I have ever tasted in my life. Our drink orders were the first thing taken care of. I got the honey badger, mostly because the name makes me giggle. It was wonderful; tasted like Christmas in a glass. My sister has the raspberrytini which was good also, but not nearly as delicious as my honey badger.Now, about the food! During restaurant week, David Burke Kitchen has many different choices, a welcomed difference to many other restaurants in the city. My sister and I each ordered different things so we would be able to try a variety of the amazing dishes the restaurant had to offer. I ordered the tuna tartare tacos while she ordered the pretzel crusted crab cake. The tuna was fresh, but I wish they would have mentioned that it would be spicy, because it had a kick I just was not expecting. So, although very delicious, I wish the heat was a little more than I could  bare, so I trade with my sister. The pretzel crusted crab cake was incredible. Take your standard crab cake and multiply it by 1,000. And the mustard that came with it, my goodness. And I don't even eat mustard! The next course I ordered the short rib with grilled peach, peach BBQ sauce, corn succotash with baby shrimp, and frizzled onion rings. The meat was tender and delicious, the peach BBQ had a little kick, which helped cut through the richness of the short rib. It was perfect. My sister ordered the trout, which came with a fennel salad and falafel. The trout was cooked perfectly and the portion was large. The falafel on the other hand were just not great. I expected more. For dessert, my sister ordered the strawberry shortcake parfait and I ordered the drunken brownie sundae. My dessert was awful. I feel bad saying it, but I didn't like much about it. The mint ice cream that came with it was the dishes only saving grace. It tasted like biting into a mint leaf, cool and refreshing. The brownie was dry, the caramel sauce was too thick and sticky, and the marshmallow was tough. Worst dish of the night by far. The strawberry shortcake parfait was incredible, and I don't even like strawberries! Actually, I am afraid of them, they creep me out, but this was so delicious that I even enjoyed it.All together the meal was incredible, I love the ambiance of the restaurant, and the service was impeccable. What really got me, was the changing of the silverware after each course. That was really lovely. I look forward to the next time I am able to enjoy a meal here.",1,0,1,Shira F.,"Massapequa, NY",381,381,1085
4.0,7/28/2012,"Restaurant week menu - well deserved starsWe all shared to so I can comment on a number of dishes:Appetizers:Asparagus and Buratta salad - EXCELLENT : incredibly flavorful, light and refreshingTuna tartare tacos - a little dense and heavy, but was unique enough to recommendCalamari - blah dont get it, no flavorEntrees:Pork chop - OMG so fucking good! So juicy and tender and melted in your mouth. Get this!! The 2 ginormous onion rings on top made the dish Short ribs - Well cooked but lacked a little seasoning. Id give this 3 stars Dessert :Brownie something with ice cream - its all right. Your friend the dessert-maker can pump out a better dessert, but it was good enough. The ice cream was incredibly minty and fresh... maybe even too minty like mouthwash. But it was good Strawberry shortcake parfait - VERY good. It came in a very tall glass - as you stick you spoon down you can taste every layer. Overall Id say get the salad, pork chops, and whatever dessert. We added a 45$ wine bottle for the table - total bill came to be 50 /person Its a great atmosphere, very laid back with good noise level.

5.0,7/28/2012,"After looking at the list of restaurants and comparing the menus, I finally decided to pick David Burke Kitchen during my short visit to NYC during restaurant week.  I decided to visit this place solely based on peer suggestions and the menu offerings - they allow people to pick items based on their actual / regular menus instead of the ""special meals"" that available during the restaurant week.The restaurant itself is somewhat secluded, located on the basement level of James hotel in SoHo/Tribeca cutoff, and it is really hard to find unless you have a smart phone.  I walked by here years ago and did not know it is a restaurant.  Don't let the appearance fool you.  This is one of the better farm to table restaurants that I have been to , coast to coast in this price range. Usually farm to table means more on the expensive side, but to my surprise, their meal isn't that expensive for NYC standard, yet the food I picked (per waiter suggestion) were delicious and perfect presentation.  To start, the poppy seed bread was creamy (with the addtion of farm delivered butter) and nice textured.  Tuna tartar taco used the marinated tuna with avacado, and their taco skin is actually lightly seasoned!  BLT softshell crab was so beautiful, I took quite a few pictures before I can eat it, and let me tell you, the crab was so JUICY.  Way better than the one I had last month at SF Farmer's Market (Hyde Street Grill comes in mind).  You have to try it to know how great soft shell crab can be.To finish the meal, the strawberry parfait is a must try!  I loved the fried strawberry on top of my parfait. So cute and sweet!!  Every item here is sought-after, and the services were very friendly and attentive.   Thanks to the waiter who chatted with me since I was dining by myself and let me know a bit more about this place.  Definitely a must visit for a reasonable price quality seasonal food!",2,0,2,Ken H.,"La Palma, CA",468,737,829

3.0,7/26/2012,"First.. I'd like to say, if high profile restaurants don't want to participate in restaurant week.. then don't.  Instead of exposing new patrons to your restaurant at a slightly lower price, a lot of places seem to try to make up for the lower prices with VOLUME.  From the time we sat down, to the time we got our check was 1 hour, everything about this meal felt rushed.. really, really rushed.  And our waiter made us feel like we  were a burden to wait on, only because we may have asked a question or two about the menu.Now, with that said.. and knowing full well our entire meal was pre-cooked, and plated probably an hour before our meal.. the food was still really good.   I'm sure if I came here on a non-restaurant week night, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars.  I had the pretzel crab cakes and short ribs.. both were excellent.  Dessert was a little on the savory side for me, but still very good.",0,0,0,scott p.,"West Orange, NJ",0,23,0

5.0,7/23/2012,"Fantastic dining experience...even during restaurant week *insert gasp here*Often times I'll dine at restaurants during restaurant week with lowered expectations.  Usually there is a limited menu and too many dining patrons...both of which lead to lesser quality food and compromised service.  However, at David Burke Kitchen, not only was the food fantastic, the service was even better.  And the restaurant week menu was not much different from their normal dinner menu...it was the same menu, except that there were a couple items that weren't offered as a prix fixe options.My friend and I ordered the following:-Pretzel Crab Cake: Even though many Yelpers raved about this dish, I wasn't expecting to like it bc I usually don't like pretzels, but this was excellent.  A unique twist to the traditional crab cake.-Asparagus and Burrata Salad: Anytime there is burrata as an option on the menu, I will usually order it.  And the burrata salad here was everything I usually like about the dish, with some bonus extras.  The juicy watermelon, slightly salty prosciutto, and crunchy asparagus played well with each other while not taking away from the star of the dish.-Short Rib: (slightly different from the online menu description)  The one offered was not served with wild mushrooms and truffle cream (although I probably would have loved that even more).  Instead, it was topped with a peach, and served on a bed of corn with baby shrimp.  The short rib was amazing...perfectly flavored and tender.  -Trout: Portions were huge, but was probably our least favorite dish of the night.  There wasn't anything special about it.-Brownie Island?: Brownie with mint ice cream and a marshmallow fluff with caramel sauce and chocolate bits.  This must have been 8000 calories, but it was worth it.  The mint in the ice cream added a nice refreshing touch to cut through the sweetness of the brownie.-Strawberry Shortcake Parfait: I just had one bite of this...it's served in layers in a big sundae cup, so you've got to cut through a lot of layers to get all the flavors in one bite.  I assume it was good bc my friend scarfed it up before I could get past the shortcake layer.-Mac and Cheese with Peas and Bacon: OMG soooo creamy and delicious.  One of the most memorable mac and cheeses I've had.  The bacon adds the right dose of saltiness to the cheesiness...I could have eaten this all day.-Rasberitini?: Can't remember the name of this cocktail, but it was amazing!  Citrusy, light, and refreshing....perfect before dinner cocktail while we waited to be seated.Two thumbs up for being able to pull off an amazing dining experience even during the most hectic of times.",7,0,2,Jackie K.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",220,138,43

To the food - I am guessing the menu changes frequently but I had amazing gazpacho with crab (highly recommended). The Pork chop was epic in size and taste. Sensibly structured wine list, again not overbaring so you didn't feel cheap ordering from the towards the top of the list. One or two really interesting wines. So, why come here?

It was delicious on all levels!!! It came with corn, tomatoes, and asparagus, some sauteed swiss chard and an awesome corn cake sandwiched with pork face lol. The only negative is they don't serve the popovers at dinner any more! C'mon the same thing at Townhouse also. Get the popovers back your fans love them David.His plating was clever and unique as always. Skin was crispy and pig was fatty and juicy. A side of beef fat fries smothered in parmesan cheese shavings and jalapenos hit the spot too. And then the monkey bread (a giant dessert meant for 2 or 4 made of basicallu a huge cinnamon bun dotted with pecans and banana) plated tableside with do it yourself maple pecan ice cream, a HUGE metal jug of whipped cream with a spatula and caramel sauce may be the best dessert in the city. Is it a cinnamon bun, sticky bun, brad pudding, french toast? I don't really know maybe everything rolled into a ball. I have half a tin waiting for me in the fridge for tomorrow. Right now I feel like I'm in a food coma but it was so worth every bite of it.The service was ultra attentive and super friendly like in all of his restaurants.

The crab cake sliders are okay, shrimps are pretty big, the lobster scramble is light in flavor (not terribly impressive, but a huge portion). The burger looked tasty. The mixed drinks that I had on the menu were not that impressive, but the waitress seemed happy to exchange them for something else.

3.0,5/17/2012,"This was my first time. I went for lunch on a rainy day. It was still pretty busy.We were greeted and sat right away. The table service was good, but nothing outstanding or memorable.The menu is interesting. As my good friend and Yelp Elite, Tracey Mac put it - it seems like he (David) is trying too hard. In other words, adding one last thing to the ingredients list that should not go, but to prove his gastronomique might, he has added it nonetheless. I can't remember what the dish was, but it was something Italian inspired, and the last thing added was WATERMELON! It just wasn't necessary. Also, one of the dishes had a foam accent. Really? Are we not done with the foam already? We shared some apps. Of what we shared, the crab-cake was the best. The dumplings were ok, but nothing special. The charcuterie plate was also uninspiring, but tasted good enough. My main course was the Black Sea Bass, and it was delicious. A small portion, but that is what I wanted for lunch, especially after the appetizers.I would go back if a client requested it, as was the case on this occasion, but I don't think I would add this to my frequent haunts list. Not that there was anything wrong. Everything was fine. But fine is not what I look for if I am going to return somewhere.

Our waiter was extremely friendly, and funny. Overall, the service was excellent, so I'm not sure what some other Yelpers are complaining about....For appetizers we got the cheese board which had an amazing honey comb with it, and a special for the night, Soft-shelled crab. The soft-shelled crab app was really great, definitely try while it is in season.For dinner we got the red snapper and the pork chop. Both were really great. For the pork chop they give you this ridiculous knife to use. While it's awesome looking and awesome to hold, it was kind of odd to use when cutting. I would rather have just had a normal steak knife.We also got a side of the mac and cheese, which was very creamy and cheesy, although it was really salty. Not sure if that was on purpose or the chef had a heavy hand. And had a side of brussel sprouts, which if you like bacon is for you.My only real complaint was that the cocktails were so expensive. My wife was ordering one of their signature cocktails, the Honeybadger, which was delicious, and these were $14 bucks a pop. For a place's signature cocktail, in Soho, I kind of expected this. But I just ordered a Tanqueray and Tonic, and somehow those were $15 each! That's insane.

2.0,4/2/2012,"I came here for dinner with two girlfriends, an early ~630pm reservation on a Saturday. The reception was a tad strange. My friends arrived early but I was ~7minutes late, and they refused to seat my friends because not everyone was there.  I'm pretty sure they'd never refuse to seat an incomplete party at DB's Townhouse, so I was taken aback when I received this info via text from my friends. But whatever, I was late, I take responsibility. Once I got to the restaurant, I was instantly impressed by the space (beautiful architectural details) which was all at once comfortable/casual and refined. However, I wasn't at all impressed by how long it took for the maitre d's (there were 2 at the desk) to acknowledge us, check our coats, and finally bring us to our table. It was just an awkward process that took approximately 10 minutes to sort through. I apologized profusely for my tardiness with a smile on my face, but was never apologized to for having to wait for them to do their jobs. Mind you, more than half the tables in the restaurant were empty due to our early reservation.we were finally seated and approached by the most awkward waiter, EVER, who progressively grew more and more inappropriate and creepy throughout the evening.  I'm going to assume he thought he was just being nice, hip, friendly, doing his job, trying to entertain a group of chics in their mid-twenties. but no, he was just straight up creepy. also, we were seated at a corner table, two sides of which have built-in banquet seating. cozy in theory, but the table was hardly large enough for 2, and it was even more uncomfortable once we had 3 entrees, two sides, and a few glasses of water and wine scattered on the table.  also, the couple to the right of us may as well have dined with us. we could hear everything they were saying, feel every breath they took. moving on to the food which was entirely par, subpar. we shared 2 appetizers, the pretzel crab cake and some other dish. obviously the other dish wasn't even remotely memorable, and the only reason i can recall the pretzel crab cake is because my friend recommended it to me before the dinner. the pretzel lent great and much needed texture to the crab cake. it was good enough that i remained excited for the rest of the meal to come out. unfortunately, disappointment was all that followed. we had the duck special of the day (duck three ways), short rib and cavatelli, and a fish dish, and a side of brussels sprouts and fries. instead of the brussels sprouts we received mushrooms.  the duck was over salted and rubbery, possibly the worst restaurant duck i've had (duck at The Modern and Craft being the best). my short ribs and cavatelli dish was really great for the first two bites, but quickly became overwhelming. And the truffle cream on top..there was just too much of it, and it was so cold that it made the rest of the dish cold. The fish flesh was cooked nicely, but the skin, which i assume was supposed to be crunchy and crisp, was simply rubbery.overall, this was a disappointing meal. we didn't even bother to stay for dessert. i don't mind par/subpar food, i just don't appreciate paying good-food-caliber price for bad food. i will not return and will not recommend.",1,1,0,Sue P.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,111,4

The service was nice, the decor great, had a nice table location and the menu looked great with decent prices (mid teens to low 20s).  The starter bread for each customer looks quite cute and yummy too. I pulled it apart and starting tasting the crust. OOO so yummy! Then my friend said it's quite salty. I was like, ""Really?"" And then I saw it. The inside ""soft"" part of the bread was soaked with buttery something. I tried a piece of the bread, and o yes, it's quite salty. Too much!We ordered an appetizer (Pretzel crab cake) and (2) kitchen benedicts. The crab cake was delicious. Just right. The kitchen benedicts looks divine with some season potatoes on the side, and 2 beautifully cooked poached eggs sitting on top of some garlic spinach on top of a rectangular piece of sausage polenta; and I couldn't wait to dig in. As I cut into the eggs, with the yolk oozing out over the spinach and polenta, I used my fork to cut a bite of all three elements, fork it and took a bite. Yummy with the first bite. Full of flavor. Then as I taste deeper, something not quite ok and took another bite.  Then it hit me overwhelmingly - too much salt! It was crazy salty, especially after you taken a few bites. The potatoes too. Though it's quite pretty and flavorful - too  much salt just kills it. Something can have a lot of flavor, but when all that flavor combine to create a mountain of saltiness - it's no longer a good thing!I'm giving it 3 stars because the only thing I was disappointed in was the taste of the food.  Maybe it was just a fluke.",0,0,0,A T.,"Westchester County, NY",0,18,0

2.0,2/24/2012,"This review is for breakfast.Very disappointed by our experience this morning at the David Burke Kitchen. From start to finish, it was an unfortunately sub-par experience. We were literally one of two tables in the restaurant the entire time we were there and service was sloooooow. Part of this was clearly an issue with our waiter (who, while pleasant, was inattentive and rather disorganized), but the main problem was with the kitchen.  It took 30 minutes for our food to come out, and we were told that this was because the waffles take a great deal of time to prepare. Waffles. If you've ever made a waffle at home, you'll know it takes all of 3 minutes to cook a waffle.  Not 30. Particularly not when there are no other meals to prepare at the restaurant.When the food finally arrived, it was very underwhelming. A soggy, bland, someone sour waffle that was supposed to have fruit was covered in tomatoes (blech). The crab cake benedict was nice, but really, the presentation was more impressive than the overall taste. The smoothies were thin and overly sweet with too much honey.  With so many excellent brunch options out there, we had hoped that David Burke Kitchen would try to compete; unfortunately, it seems they leave their A game at home when it comes to breakfast.",2,0,0,Julie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",98,572,13
4.0,2/24/2012,"Came here for Restaurant Week. I like how they have more varieties to order from on the RW menu as opposed to other participants of RW. The service was excellent and our waiter was very enthusiastic. Usually when the waiter mentions the daily specials, I zone out completely, but this waiter had my full attention. For my appetizer, I ordered the tuna tartare tacos, which was delicious and cutely placed on a rack.  Normally, I would get the salmon tartare (signature item), but I've tried this before at David Burke Townhouse and I wanted to try something new.  For my entree, I ordered the short rib. This was not one of my favorites. The short rib was very tender and prepared well, it just wasn't my cup of tea. For dessert, I ordered the butterscotch panna cotta with chocolate. Initially, I thought it was way too sweet. But, this was only because I only scooped from the top with mostly butterscotch and the butterscotch itself is very overwhelming. If you get a scoop with the butterscotch, panna cotta, and the chocolate on the bottom, you'll be pleasantly surprised.  The slight bitterness of the chocolate balances very well with the butterscotch and panna cotta.",2,1,2,Tina W.,"New York, NY",212,537,4418
5.0,2/22/2012,"Best Restaurant Week place ever. The one gripe I have about RW every time I go is that restaurants oftentimes treat RW as an annoying semiannual chore. The menu is oftentimes separate and resembles the ugly stepsister compared to its regular dishes. David Burke Kitchen knows exactly what RW is all about: allowing first-time patrons to get a taste of what it has to offer so they become repeat customers. The RW menu actually includes regular menu items and the food was clearly prepared with care and precision and the service was so pleasant that one could hardly tell we came for RW at all.Two of the 4 girls at my table arrived late so my friend and I shared a bottle of RW-priced Malbec wine (~$30 - winning!) at the bar - which wasn't even technically allowed under house rules but the bartender generously allowed us to put it on our dining bill. To start, we got the lobster soup (good, but not amazing); tuna tartare tacos (the texture of the cold tuna tartare with the crunchy taco shell and the creamy avocado .. heavenly!!); pretzel crab cake (a MUST-HAVE! What a smart, playful dish!); and the salmon tartare (addition to the menu and another hit). We also ordered a jar of chicken liver for the table - it came after the main course meal so we got it for free. The liver fans at the table loved it, but I not being one of them can't comment. I had the short rib and cavatelli as my entrée and it was absolutely delicious. One of my other friends had salmon which was well cooked and all but having had the Perfect Salmon dish at Aureole a couple weeks earlier, this dish failed to unseat the reigning champ. For dessert, we shared the butterscotch panna cotta - which I really wish had some kind of fruit in it to make it less sweet and more fresh-tasting. The sorbet had great, innovative flavors but the real winner was the red velvet parfait - not at all as heavy as it may seem and  was wonderfully moist. A great spin on the American cuisine, with trendy new cooking techniques (foam, anyone?) + great service + comfortable, chic environment (not at all pretentious) made it a memorable night for me and my friends.

5.0,2/16/2012,"A review for the gluten free, dairy free folks with additional allergies and intolerances:David Burke's Kitchen is very accommodating- but I suggest calling in advance to optimize your experience. The manager, Peter, paired our table with a server, Stacy, who knew the ingredients in each dish, which is highly unusual and a big time saver when deciding what to order. The kitchen staff offered to deconstruct the elements of each dish onto separate plates so that I could share with the rest of the table. For example, we ordered- Pastrami salmon (divine)- and they put the pretzel bread and balsamic caramelized onions on a different plate.Braised octopus (wow.)Chicken (simple, but really flavorful) with Butternut Squash ravioli (again, pasta separated from chicken, no butter on the chicken)Seared Scallops (Perfectly tender). You know a restaurant is good when every component of a dish tastes fabulously...and because each element of our dishes were separated, there was no room for anything to hide.  My fellow diners loved that they could  choose when and how to pair each bite.  Everyone walked out full and happy. So often when I go to a great restaurant, I have a disappointing experience because the kitchen thinks because I have allergies, I don't care about the taste of the food- You Won't Have That Problem Here. Its a great foodie experience for all. But again, I would highly recommend calling in advance.

I started with the tuna tacos which were actually great and my friend got the lobster bisque which was pretty good. For mains we both good the short rib with poached egg. It was a great idea but taste-wise fell a little short of expectations. My dessert was nice though - the red velvet sundae was creamy and not too sweet and definitely worth trying.

They enrolled in restaurant week and instead of skating by with minimal cheap dinners they strived to wow their guests.

The restaurant itself.. is cozy and bright during lunch.. and its not overly decorated.. I enjoyed staring (being a photographer snob) at the large portraits of food and the people who help in the process.we had off the RW lunch menu:tuna tartare tacos: whipped avocado and tobiko caviar - delicious. small three bites but expertly prepared and i dislike avocado. only goes to show if prepared in different ways.. one can overcome even some of the food dislikes.Lobster soup: lobster dumplings, coconut fennel creme, red watercress -again very creative, the dumplings came first (they had tiny claws sticking out of them so you could eat them without any utensils if you wanted to), then came the waiter with the broth.  together it was very well balanced, broth by itself had a kick.BBQ Rib grilled cheese: horse radish and cheddar - this one of the most inventive grilled cheeses I have ever had in my life, no the most inventive, and phenomenally presented, the meat itself, if it was by itself was good enough. There was an egg inside of the breading which was completely baked around the meat and the cheese and the egg, and then spilled out as you cut in.. heaven on earth.hand cut cavateli: wild mushrooms & truffle mousse - I am not a vegeterian and I don't like mushrooms. but I could eat this dish once a week.chocolate cream cheese bar: a bit on the heavy side, but two toned great desert which we decided to take home as we ran out of the time.",1,1,1,Lucie T.,"Yonkers, NY",263,435,2
5.0,2/9/2012,"One of the best meals I've had in the city yet. I went here for restaurant week and it couldn't have been a better experience. The service was amazing and the food was even better. We split a bottle of wine, which we were told by our waiter complimented our entree choices. Among three of us, we tried the lobster soup, tuna tartar tacos, and the pretzel crabcakes. The crabcakes were amaazzinngg and the presentation was beautiful. I am a crabcake snob, coming from Maryland where fresh lump crab meat is readily available. These were not at all the traditional crabcakes I'm used to but the creative spin they put on it was exciting and fun to try and the taste was superb!As for the entree, I ordered the short rib cavatelli. OH. MY. GOD. One of the best things I have ever put in my mouth. I am a sucker for anything with truffles, so clearly this was a winner because it had a truffle foam along with truffle ""chips"". The short rib was fall off the bone perfect. Our server described the shortrib cavatelli as ""euphoric"" and he was right! I think we even called it ""orgasmic"". :)I'm normally not a dessert person, but because we had to choose one with the restaurant week menu, we chose the red velvet sundae and a chocolate torte of some kind. Both were delicious and a great end to a wonderful meal. I will most certainly be coming back to DB's Kitchen!

3.0,2/8/2012,"I came here with a friend for dinner during RW. The space of the restaurant is downstairs and very cozy. I had the pretzel crab cake, then the pork chop, followed by the chocolate cream cheese cake. Everything was solid and the options were plentiful which was excellent for restaurant week. There did seem to be some discrepancy between my meal my friend's however. First, we both had the pretzel crab cake. I noticed I had two things of beer foam where my friend had 1 thing of foam and something like a tartar sauce. I really liked the concept of the pretzel but the cake itself was a bit greasy. Next both my friend and I order medium pork chops but they didn't give her a pork chop, they gave her something like a pork shank and they cooked her pork to a pretty red medium whereas my pork piece was definitely a chop but cooked to well done in fact it was a bit dry. Although my friend's pork shank was a bit red, it did look more juicy and tasty than my own. Lastly she had the cookies and I had the cheese cake. My cheese cake was a perfect portion considering how big the other portions were (I was stuffed) and my friend had something like 8 small cookies...way too many cookies. It looked like a plate to split rather than for one person. All in all, I would say this restaurant is missing some finer points but the value is very good.",0,0,0,Lucy Z.,"Manhattan, NY",9,107,0

3.0,2/8/2012,"Went here last night with two friends for restaurant week. Had reservations for 8.30, showed up around 8pm to grab a drink at the bar before dinner. We let them know we were there and at about 8.45 we went to check in again as to the status of our table. They told us that most parties of three were being delayed and that it would be another 15 minutes. At 9.20 we once again asked what the status of our table was (at this point we were seated directly to the right of the hostess stand). We were told that they had seated another group thinking it was us but they had another table they could seat us at. Needless to say, we were pissed at being delayed almost an hour and then having someone else get to jump ahead of us just because the hostess is an idiot. When my friend told the hostess about our frustration and asked if they might send over a glass a wine, we were told ""everyone's waiting tonight."" When we reminded her that she sat someone else thinking they were us she said ""yeah, well, that was 5 minutes ago."" and then promptly walked away. THEN CAME THE FOOD.Our waiter was a delight, the food was divine (pretzel crab cake and short rib cavatelli, you will both be seeing me again) and the service aside from the snotty hostess was lovely.

So if you are not a fan of super smelly seafood don't even sit at the bar for drinks.- Some entrees came to the table cold :( always a fail.. nothing is as tasty meal like cold short rib ravioli... - Oh, also forgot parts of my salmon were raw and the outside of the fish had weird white fatty markings.- Eating dessert while the table next to you is having lobster bisque poured into there bowl.  Let's just say it makes for a super awful dessert experience.  That isn't even me commenting on their version of  ""panna cotta"" aka pudding in a jar..gross - Service took forever the lunch literary took 1.5 hours about 20-25 minutes of which we were just looking for the waiter to get the check.Pro:- Love the decor wood country feeling was cozy.",1,0,0,Patty T.,"New York, NY",130,284,6

The restaurant was PACKED on a Thursday night with a young, after-work crowd. The great thing about the spot is the very broad menu (and esp. for RW which is hard to come by). My friends and I ordered a variety of things, but I have to say, for even the reduced restaurant week prices, I did not feel the food was worth the price.

4.0,2/4/2012,"This place should get a reward for best restaurant week spot!! Restaurant week dining is always hit or miss. Yes, you get to go to a nice restaurant for $35, but often times the menu is completely different than their regular menu (i.e. chicken and pasta options at a famous seafood restaurant) and the selection is limited, so really, you haven't been to that restaurant at all, sucka. Restaurant Week at David Burke Kitchen, however, is a hit - they allow you to choose one appetizer, main course, and dessert from their regular menu essentially, sans a few of the top priced items, so you get a wide selection of choices and get the true David Burke Kitchen experience, for about 75% the price. DING DING DING!As for the restaurant experience itself, it was great.  Making my way to the restaurant I was a little sketched out, as it is located awkwardly at the very tip of south village, right next to the holland tunnel entrance. Once I got into the place though, I forgot about my entrance, as the ambiance was great - it had both a homey/warm and modern feel to it. I went with a few of my girlfriends, and being the foodlovers that we are, we decided to each get a different dish so we could sample everything. Me, being the most awesome of them all, happened to order the best dish each round. Here is what we voted to be the best: appetizer: lobster soup, main dish: salmon, dessert: butterscotch panna cotta. Though really, all dishes were somewhere between good and great. On the way out - don't forget to grab a few peanut butter brittle candies near the host stand. I actually went back for seconds after I had already left the restaurant. (oh wait, you're telling me I DID already pick up my jacket? oh right, i'm wearing it... well now that i'm here, i'm just going to grab a few brittles....) My one disclaimer about my review of the place is that because I paid restaurant week prices, I don't actually know how much the meal actually costs, but get the sense it is on the higher side of the range.

5.0,1/30/2012,"Holy crap! I went here for restaurant week with some GFs and I have not been that satisfied or pleased with a restaurant week meal in....well, ever.For starters, the whole MENU is part of ""restaurant week""- Not just 3 ho-hum entrees/apps and a scoop of ice cream. ANYthing. Except one item, which I forget what it was anyway and I think it was $45.  And the portions are generous. Basically, its amazing.The bread basket was adorable- a little pail, with  carrots , radishes, bread, and pretzel sticks. I had the lobster soup (no cream and 2 delicious dumplings).  It tasted like sucking lobster juice out of a lobster claw. If you think thats gross, don't order it. As a lovah of lobstah, I enjoyed it.  My friends all had the pretzel crab cake.  Most of them liked it- its not what you would expect.  Pretzel rods on top of fresh crab. Way better than your average crab cake in my opinion but if you are finicky and prefer your crab cake to be a pureed ball of imitation crab meat and mystery items- don't get this. For entree I had the sea bass- very healthy, kind of boring. I liked it. The rest of the table had the short rib (they were way more adventurous and fun than I was). They basically licked their plates clean and wouldn't stop raving about it, so its safe to say this is a good choice.There is an option to ""trade in"" two RW desserts for this insane lollipop tree, which you should DO.  You get 5-6 cake lollipops and a cream dipping sauce. It was heavenly. We also got the cookies and the red velvet sundae- cream cheese ice cream layered with red velvet cake in a little jar. Not the best for sharing, but that's fine bc I really didn't want to anyway :)  The service was fantastic- I will definitely come back!

I had been wanting to try something in the David Burke empire for awhile but times/days were just never coinciding. I finally talked my girlfriends into brunch here. I'll start by saying I'm not a big brunch fan....I'm a Cali girl and we don't ""do brunch"" we get up at 6 and eat eggs and then run the Santa Monica stairs for the next 2 hours...soooo..I walked in and the decor was somewhere between cool hotel breakfast place and ...well...I guess that's it. The only criticism I have of this place is their wine list. More restaurants need to have a wine list with selections under $50. I ended up ordering a great Tablas Creek GSM blend cause it was representing but ya need to have a few selections under $40. So they have a $29 pre-fixe which is a great deal..we are 2 girls that love our wine and food but watch the waistline so splitting 1 pre-fixe was totally doable. The brioche poppy seed roll they give you to start is insane!!! I could live on that and wine..next we ordered the pretzel crusted crab cake...now I'm not a fan of crab cakes but this was ridiculously good...next we split the burger and fries...send me to heaven now?! The fries are insane and I did notice that they offer a side of ""fries in beef fat"" hmmmm...must be why they are like crack...although the burger was hard to eat because it was largely stacked on an english muffin it was one of the best burgers I've had in a while..we sat at the bar so I can't really comment on the service...our bartendress was perfectly accommodating. I give this place a big thumbs up and if I wasn't on a quest to never visit the same place twice this year I would be back every weekend..",1,0,0,Leslie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",82,444,2
3.0,1/29/2012,"Slightly underwhelming for the price: while it's difficult to find fault with the food, I must admit I was expecting something a little more outstanding from this hyped-up restaurant. The best part of our dinner was by far the wine pick - they have a good chianti classico for $50-60 (can't remember the exact price), which is on the cheap side of the wine list, and heaven knows how difficult it is to get decent chianti wines at fair prices in this city. Food-wise, I enjoyed my salmon tartare and bass (I was on a seafood trip) but wasn't blown away. Especially on the bass, I thought they could have gotten a little more innovative - go beyond the old pan-fried refrain. Also, the lobster dumpling soup I thought was quite disappointing - not sure what happened to the lobster in there. While I do appreciate their whole seasonal ingredient spiel/ rotating menu for maximum freshness, that doesn't mean they can't get creative.",1,0,0,Vanni P.,"San Jose, CA",138,574,2
5.0,1/28/2012,"Beautiful space and great food!  Bread basket was a tiny pail, with cute stemmed carrots and country bread, really charming!  Lots of options for each course, which is great. The portions are full-sized and very generous for RW. Had pretzel crab cake (genius and delicious), could have done without the foam, and I pretty much did, but that's just my humble opinion. Salmon had a crisp crust, and the accompanying puree, bacon, and brussel sprouts were delish!  The red velvet sundae was really yummy, but really big!  The cream cheese ice cream was rich and tasted like cream cheese (which is surprisingly rare).  There wasn't enough red velvet cake, and I never really made it to the caramel sauce that was semi-hardened at the bottom due to the coldness of the ice cream.  Had rice krispies petit fours, which tasted like they had brown butter or something caramelized in them, so yummy!  The check came in a bi-fold that had a ""push for service"" button which lit up the front clear panel - probably a gimmick, but it entranced us girlies for a good 5 minutes, haha.  A solid DB fan now for sure!

They offer almost every entree and appetizer so it is an incredibly reasonable deal.  The food was excellent and very unique-- my sister and I split the lobster soup/dumplings and the pretzel encrusted crab cake for appetizers. They were both delicious--I think the crab cake was probably better.  For the entree, I had the giant grilled prawns, which were slightly on the salty side, but other than that-- very flavorful.  My sister had the fish which she liked a great deal as well. The dessert choices were a butterscotch panna cotta or a red velvet sundae with cream cheese ice cream.  The latter was AMAZING. Just thinking about it is making my mouth water. The place is nice, hip, definitely not as pretentious as many of the other restaurants on the RW list.  Our waiter was very helpful and friendly.  Unfortunately, though, we had an awful experience with the hostess there -- A word to the wise: beware of the short blond haired woman with a lot of facial hair and even more attitude.",6,1,1,Lauren K.,"Manhattan, NY",38,216,2

4.0,1/21/2012,"David Burke Kitchen is an example of great food without being pretentious. The vibe of the restaurant was definitely very hip and trendy with a touch of cozyness with their blue and white napkin-ed table setting.  Came here for Restaurant Week and one of the great things about this place is that the RW menu was pretty much almost the same as their normal menu.So the two reasons why I loved this place is for their excellent and friendly service and their delicious food.  Like many other restaurants participating in this week, this place was packed.  However, I never felt like they were trying to rush us off our table and turn people in and out. Everyone, especially our waiter, felt very personable (minus their sommelier who was kinda buzzkill).  The food came out also incredibly quickly, but I assume that to be because they were anticipating the restaurant week dishes to be flying off the kitchen counters..so props for being prepared.Now onto the food!  Appetizers: Smoked Pastrami Salmon and the Pretzel Crab Cake.  both were delicious and incredibly filling in my opinion.  I loved the foam that came with the pastrami salmon and it was the perfect thing to dip your bread into.Entrees:  Sea Bass and the Cavatelli with Short Rip and Truffle.  As a pasta lover, I loved the cavatelli and the short rib melted perfectly into my mouth.  I think the short rib was a hit or miss for others after reading their reviews but mine turned out pretty well.  The only con I could say that it was over salted a little.Dessert: Instead of getting two separate desserts for RW, we opted to combine ours and get the Lollipop Cheesecake Tree for Two.  The tree itself was really cute and interesting for the eyes and the lollipops were also creamy and delicious.  And while I love munching, I thought there were too many Lollipops for two people.  I would have been fine with two for each person (so 4 total).  But the tree came with 10 lollipops!!  After a while it got too creamy for my taste buds so I had to break up my palette with a blackberry or two.All in all it was a great meal with great service and would definitively want to come back again outside of RW.",4,0,1,Eileen J.,"New York, NY",40,185,0

Some places are grimy with their menus during RW and you leave feeling cheated, but definitely not here. Their 3-course RW menu was the normal menu, minus a couple of dishes. The restaurant is cozy and inviting, the service is great, and the food is whimsical and fun. You can tell that David Burke isn't pretentious about food -- he's all about creating quality dishes, and he definitely has lots of fun doing it. We had the jar of chicken liver and pistachio as a ""table share"" -- even though this isn't part of the RW menu, this is a definite must! For the appetizer course, I would recommend the pretzel crab cake or the smoked pastrami salmon. As a main course, the grilled prawns were light and delicious; the short rib with truffle cream was a bit on the salty side, but the meat literally melts in your mouth.

The Pretzel Crab Cake was a bit too dry probably due to the use of small pretzel sticks. As for the Short Rib And Cavatelli wild mushrooms, truffle cream, I must say it was cooked to perfection and was heavenly. Desserts are also masterfully executed subtly mixing flavors and textures.

5.0,1/19/2012,"If you see me waddling, it's because I was impregnated by David Burke Kitchen. I call it immaculate fatception. I'm patting my food baby right now. Oh dear buttermilk fried chicken, I love you even more now than when I first heard you were on the menu.It happens. I was lured by Restaurant Week. Then I heard that the specials of the day were all part of the plan for me to give in. A glass of Chardonnay was placed in front of me. Upon first sip, cold and crisp with a fruity finish, I fell into the downtown beat. David Burke Kitchen has sort of a rustic farm house swagger. I surrendered to the food party.We sat in close quarters in a snug two top corner table. A basket of bread (Pretz sticks included) and miniature carrots were placed upon us. The butter, seasoned, was housed in a jar. Throughout the night, I came to learn that David Burke Kitchen loves jars. Our waitress, rambunctious (did she really just yell out *BAM* when they placed down the pork chop?!), was excellent in the art of making us salivate over food. Really, everything sounded good, and I believe you cannot order wrong at David Burke Kitchen. The dishes are huge, the appetizers alone could make for an entrée. Fear not, all three courses are included in Restaurant Week. It's as if they were giving away the food for free. I'm excited to return. Next time, I can eat for two - me and this food baby!Our meal consisted of:Appetizers-The Angry Octopus (This is a trip to Spain with chorizo, white beans, lemon juice, and the most tender octopus ever.)-Mushroom and Onion Tart (The star of this dish was the bacon wrapped egg. It was slightly runny and provided a nice sauce to the tart. Beautiful and picture worthy!)-Smoked Pastrami Salmon (This was impressive and tasted better than it sounded. Beer foam? Pretzel toast? Get it.)Entrée-Buttermilk Fried Chicken (Juicy chicken in a cast iron pan. Buttermilk biscuits. Cheesy grits. GRAVY!)-Pork Chop with mango chutney and parsley onion rings (We dubbed this the man pork chop. It was large and in charge. I liked the bright green onion rings. Everything complimented each other on this dish. Win.)-Short Rib and Cavatelli (I loved the cavatelli. It had a great texture and a mushroom rich sauce. The short rib? I didn't care for it so much. It was dry.)Dessert-Butterscotch Panna Cotta (This was amaaaaazing!!! Not your ordinary plain Jane panna cotta. This was custardy and modern. I loved that it was served in a Mason jar. I loved the meringue sticks. The butterscotch is at the bottom. This was like a parfait of panna cotta.-Plate of cookies. David Burke Kitchen gives Mrs. Fields and Nutter Butter a run for their money.)-Chocolate Cream Cheese Bar with hazelnut whipped cream (Extremely good. It was beautiful too but gone in a blink of an eye. My friend ate it so fast I swear she inhaled it.)I would gladly do this dinner over in a heartbeat. So this is what I've been missing out on in the last 10 years... I think I made up for lost time at David Burke Kitchen. And for the record, no I am not preggo.

5.0,1/19/2012,"So, we went to David Burke Kitchen last Friday night.  I have to say, it was a great experience from start to finish.   The restaurant seemed to be bustling, and yet our waiter made us feel like we were his only table.  He explained everything from Maple bacon dates, to crab cakes to the 28 day dry age steak  (which we had all three on our table). Didn't really understand dry aging until that night. Even though everyone seemed busy, he had a certain calmness to him that kept us at ease. We asked if he had been there since they opened, and he jokingly said he feels like he's worked there his whole life, even though he admitted he was in his first couple of weeks. His exact words were this is his second home so we treat everyone like they are at dinner at there own dining room.  I dont know if this is the David Burke  motto or not, but we did feel at home. The food was absolutely delicious.  The dates were very different, but I felt like a child as I ate them. Peanut butter, bacon, fried grape, amazing. The Crab cake came out and it blew my mind. I asked for cocktail sauce before it came out, but our server described it as having red pepper marmalade, which he was right was definitely better than cocktail sauce. The beer foam was a little watery, but did not take away from the overall flavor and crunchy-ness of the crab cake. Finished with the Ribeye, which did not need any steak sauce as it was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  by the end of it, we didnt have any room for dessert.Overall, great ambiance, Superb Service, good wine list  And Great food led to a great Friday night Dinner.

5.0,1/11/2012,"SUPERB!! My friend and I walked in to this restaurant having no clue what we were getting in to. Having a groupon, we decided to try it out. This restaurant was genuinely an amazing experience. Our server was so attentive and friendly. He seemed to be enjoying himself as much as we were. My friend and I ordered the wedge salad to start and the dressing was exquisite. It added just the right amount of flavor to the fresh ingredients. I had the Rabbit Steak entree, which was enough for two. For being a higher quality restaurant, the portions were extremely generous. The mushroom pot pie that came alongside the chorizo wrapped rabbit, was a meal on it's own due to size and fulfillment. I was in a state of utter bliss. At the end of our meal, we declined dessert since we were so full, and our server preceded to bring us a small sampler of their smaller after dinner treats including: cheesecake pops, chocolate covered oreos, and mocha dusted fudge squares. The quality of the chocolate matched, if not succeeded the dinner. But wait, there's more!!! The server also brought us little boxes as thank you gifts with MORE CHOCOLATE inside. He then invited us to tour the kitchen!! I only wish David was there himself to be able to rant and rave about his restaurant.The fact that all of this occurred with us having a Groupon, boggles my mind.

4.0,1/5/2012,"I went to David Burke Kitchen last Wednesday and thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience.  The restaurant sits in the basement of The James Hotel, but you don't feel like you're underground.  The bar is situated in the corner of the dining room and is flanked by tall windows that look up and out to the sidewalk letting in some natural light (along with street lights and brake lights).The service was excellent as we were waited on by a team of waiters and servers.  The guys with ties on seemed to be in charge, but the others were equally efficient and attentive.I'm not a cocktail kind of person, but their menu was so interesting that I decided to order the ""Rabbit Hunter""...bourbon, ginger, lime and mint...the perfect drink for a cold night.The bread came with a tasty palette of salted butter and raw vegetables (carrots and radishes) and we devoured this!  Then as an appetizer, we both ordered the Nantucket scallop chowder, which was savory and filling.My entree was the ""Lobster Steak""...a de-shelled boiled lobster (and bacon and a tiny smearing of avocado) molded into the shape of a Filet Mignon.  Of course it was delicious and I can't wait to order it again.  My wife ordered the boneless pork chop, which was cooked to perfection and accompanied by some tasty root vegetables.  For sides we ordered the pepper flaked green beans and jalapeno and duck fat fries.  (they were tasty, but would have been off the hook with a burger.  With the lobster and pork, the fries weren't necessary).The wine list was extensive and ran the gamut of price range, but if you have any idea of what you want, you can find a great wine for under $100.  We settled on a Summerland Pinot from the Central Coast and it paired with our meal quite well.Everything was so great, I can't remember what I had for dessert...sheesh!The chocolates with the bill was a nice final touch.PS.  David Burke himself was manning the coat check when we left.  He looks like a great guy to have a beer and hang out with.",1,0,0,Tom O.,"New York, NY",94,50,13

5.0,12/4/2011,"Thanksgiving dinner at David Burke Kitchen, and it really was his kitchen on the night. Big man himself was in the house and carving up the most-perfectly-cooked-turkey-ever for his diners. ""Dinner and a show!"" exclaimed our sprightly young waitress, Jamie Lynne as she walked by the carving table. Can you tell I'm giddy just thinking back to this? The last time I felt so special, I was seven years old and had just gotten three gold stars for my homework from a teacher I had a huge crush on.We had to wait about 45 minutes from our reservation time before finally getting seated, but the wait was well worth it. This was a near flawless thanksgiving meal- hearty and homey, but with that dash of David Burke's signature whimsy. We started with munching on a delightful popover, and sipping on the sublime new old fashioned. Our appetizers were from the regular menu. We ordered a chicken liver jar with toast to share (a must try spread, creamy and delicious). Followed that with a pretzel crab-cake which was light and beautifully presented in a bar of delicate flavourful layers. A complete contrast to this and perhaps even more impressive, was the bison tartare with egg salad spread on top. It was much bolder, a more challenging combination of almost distracting elements, that I imagine is a hit-or-miss taste, but it blew me away. The smoked tomato adds a great acidic touch, but don't order this unless you're a fan of egg salad in general. From here on, it was down to the Thanksgiving specials. For the main course, the turkey was the best I've ever had (perfect in terms of moisture, tenderness, seasoning), served with a smooth sweet pumpkin puree (maybe yams too?). It combined perfectly with the rather sour cranberry compote. And the meaty stuffing was a great compliment wrapped in thin flaky dough. This plate with all the fixings delivered enormous portions, unlike anything I've seen at a high-end restaurant before. And once through with it, we were stuffed, but still had to go in for the kill. To finish off there was no doubt about choosing the monkey bread. Now, at the table next to us was a couple visiting from Salt Lake City, and the young lady had been glancing over our table all night to examine our selections before making her own decisions. And the moment our server brought out the monkey bread to prepare our plates table-side was when she finally burst out and asked us, ""What is that? It looks amazing"". She was right, it was amazing. A brief discussion about my fictional history of monkey bread followed, and then we dug in for a most delicious and utterly decadent dessert, served warm oozing with caramel sauce mixing perfectly with the hints of cinnamon, and the flavours of the baked banana permeating throughout, all served with a dollop of vanilla ice cream on top. Perhaps a tad bit overwhelming, but isn't that the perfect level of indulgence for Thanksgiving? And that was the nature of the whole meal really.By the end of the night, my dining partner and I were thinking the same sad thing: we don't want a home cooked dinner for thanksgiving ever again, if we can eat here instead.",5,0,6,Zayed K.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",56,76,245

3.0,11/15/2011,"Our meal here was good, but I was expecting fantastic. And to find such a fascination with Pretz (cheap Japanese cracker sticks) at a restaurant of this caliber was a little strange...We started off with the salmon pastrami snack and tomato/eggplant/ricotta jar. The ""snack"" was good, but it kinda reminded me of something one of my bachelor friends would throw together with whatever he had in his kitchen. (Or maybe it's the Pretz thing again....) The flavors in the jar were strangely muddled.For dinner, we shared the pretzel crab cake and short ribs and cavatelli. I was not a fan of the crab cake (Pretz!...and maybe the mustard/marmalade combo), but my sister really liked it. The short ribs and cavatelli, though, were excellent. (I just wish cavatelli looked a little less like grubs.)We had the monkey bread for dessert and oh. my. god.

5.0,11/8/2011,"First time at David Burke and I have to say it was exceptional! This is review is for lunch btw. They typically have a daily 3 course prix fixe special for lunch for $24.07 (appetizer, entree, dessert) which itself is a good deal. I actually used a Groupon Now daily deal for $15 as I was in the neigborhood and bought it a few seconds before I walked in the door. 3 course meal at David Burke Kitchen for $15? Score! The server said they are offering the Groupon deal every day, so until they discontinue it, I say its one of the best lunch deals in the city.Prix Fixe special gets you one of 4 starter options, 6 entree options, and 3 dessert options. Opted for the lobster dumpling soup, Salmon w/ couscous & zuchinni chips and apple tart for dessert. Every was prepared excellently. Lobster soup is a popular option (half the restaurant seemed to have ordered it, and I bet most of the lunch crowd did the prix fixe menu). Salmon was cooked perfectly and of large enough size for my substantial appetite. Apple tart was a meal in itself. Even detail to presentation/plating was great and I found myself looking at what others ordered. Service was attentive as well.Decor is a refreshing, rustic look with a lot of wood paneling. I came in around noon on a weekday and it was virtually empty but towards 12:30 it was about 2/3 full. Will likely come again for lunch. $15 plus tip was a sensational deal.

Bison tartare was nothing special but still deliciosu.  Duck meatball lasagne was a deconstructed lasagne. Best appetizer that night.ENTREES:  Scallops and pork belly. Sublime. Broth was amazing. Steak with frites. My friend from France was surprised at how bad the fries were but I thought they were ok.  Steak was prepared perfectly. I ordered the pressed head-on prawns.  I was asked if I wanted the heads.  Classy.  I said yes.  But then they took all the heads off for me.  Should have specified that I wanted to be able to get all the goodness out of the heads myself. By cutting them off I lost all the gushy deliciousness.  Probably inappropriate for a business dinner but would have been ok with friends.DESSERT: We shared the creme brulee and the monkey bread.  Creme brulee was delicious.  But the monkey bread was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Served tableside with a dairy can of fresh whipped cream and drizzle of caramel sauce. The ""bread"" is little balls of dough cooked together with bananas. I am not a big dessert fan but this was one of the best desserts I have ever had in a restaurant. Never had monkey bread before but I doubt they are ever this good. The presentation, the perfectly whipped cream and the fact that they give you your leftovers in a cute David Burke tin.BOTTOM LINE:  Def going back.  Plus they have a great bar upstairs where you can have drinks on the terrace.  Think I saw David Burke at the bar that night so may have been an especially good night since the boss was in the house.  But I'm going back to find out.",1,0,1,Tess D.,"Hoboken, NJ",2,83,81
2.0,10/16/2011,"My experiences with David Burke over the years have been nothing short of exceptional, so my boyfriend and I thought we'd try brunch at David Burke Kitchen after some light shopping. It's not often that I'm disappointed in a meal - and I do think we may have just gone on an off day, but that being said, I definitely won't be going back to this particular DB establishment.The dining room was relatively empty for a Saturday at 2 PM. When we first arrived there were only another 5 tables with patrons. We were seated promptly and our server greeted us soon thereafter. We started with the bison tartare, which was delicious, and one of the only reasons this is a two star review as opposed to one. I ordered the fried chicken with grits and my boyfriend settled on the pretzel crab cakes, which sounded delicious (they turned out to be just okay). The biggest letdown of the meal was my fried chicken. It seemed like the meal had been sitting out for a WHILE. Forget skin - the gravy on the plate no longer had the properties of a liquid, by the time it had gotten to me, any attempts to ""dip"" the chicken in it resulted in the solid pieces of gravy being moved around the plate. The chicken itself was overcooked and overfried, a deep brown with some burnt areas. Despite being overcooked (at some indeterminable point in the past), it was served to me just barely above room temperature. Service was also a little... strange? Shortly after receiving our entrees, we realized that we had never received, or been asked if we would like, their version of a ""bread"" basket - which actually looked pretty appetizing. All of the other diners seemed to have a basket full of fresh produce and a few breadsticks. Given the number of diners in the establishment at that time, it seemed a little strange that none of the waitstaff had noticed/cared to offer it to us. Most of the staff were very friendly and helpful, but I felt like our server (his name escapes me) was a less amiable and was pretty short with us in general.  After being grossly ignored for most of the meal, we finally flagged someone down to ask for the check. The server asked us if we wanted dessert, which we politely declined. Shortly after he left to get our check, another server came by to again ask us if we would like dessert. We again declined. About two minutes later, yet ANOTHER server stops by to ask us if we would like dessert?? I understand that this is still a relatively new establishment, but it was still surprising how uncoordinated the staff seemed to be.

Honestly, I didn't come to a restaurant to spend $50+ on a meal to be served Asian cracker sticks that I can buy for $4 a box of 12 packets. For what I'm paying, they should seriously really make their own bread sticks.Other than that, food was great. I loved the scallops and short rib ravioli appetizer. It was flavorful, and the ravioli were interesting - they seemed more like loosely cased sausages more than ravioli, but regardless, they tasted great.Coming from Brooklyn, this is more convenient than DBT, but it's a different restaurant.

I had been to the ""Treehouse"" for special work events and also know DB's food well, so thought this would be the perfect place. After calling to make sure the table I booked would be outside, and assured it would be, we arrived to be told ""there were no available outside tables."" We spoke to a manager and were eventually given one DIRECTLY in the sun, and told, of course, there were ""no other tables available."" We begrudgingly took it and prepared to bake. Once we sat, we waited at least 15 minutes for a server to approach us and then another 15 for the iced coffees we ordered to arrive. When they finally came to take our order, we asked for more water as well. Another 15 minutes went by before we had to flag someone down about our water, which was even more necessary since we were MELTING in the sun. Finally, when the meals came, they remembered about the water and STILL took another 10 min to bring it to us! Maybe we would've enjoyed the food better had the service and overall experience not sucked so much, but overall, I felt $60 for ice coffees, a salad and a lobster scramble -- no alcoholic drinks! -- was totally not worth it. There were barely any bits of lobster in my scramble and before I could finish the salad, the lettuce wilted from the sun.

One of my friends was convinced the setting was just the ideal place to bring dates, and he could be right. Genuinely cool vibe, relaxed decor too. Being in SoHo makes it just quiet enough to enjoy as well; it's a nice escape from the crowds.As to the food itself, a bit bland and overpriced. I didn't have the Market Salad, but my friend enjoyed that dish. As for the pancakes, I was disappointed. The pancakes tasted way too refined/processed and there was definitely NOT enough berry to make this feel fresh or light. When cutting the pancakes, the insides sort of collapsed as well, indicating a problem with the actual batter used.Two of us had teas -- the earl grey was well received, as was the hibiscus (which I had). Just the sort of complex earthy, not too bitter, tea I like.The chocolate-peanut butter cake, though, was genuinely fantastic.

But, the entrees and appetizers were not memorable.  The tomato gazpacho had a pleasant flavor with a mist of watermelon and cream.  The burger was intense, not in a fulfilling way.  Yes I ate most of it and took the rest back, but I really expected more from DB.  I was expecting something special from a well-known chef who has his own name as the restaurant name.  It had a typical bun. No sauce. Why would I want to eat my burger with a fork and knife? Not sure if that is supposed to make the experience sophisticated. My gf had the CHK BLT. Same story, but it was worse than the burger.  It was bland and could have been done at home. I know we ordered typical entrees that could be done ourselves, but why would he have it on his menu if it weren't something delicious and unique?Nonetheless, the apple tart with apple cider caramel,vanilla ice cream, and a fennel chip was delicious.  We ate there for lunch on its rooftop.

For an appetizer I had a jar of chicken liver with pistachios, which was very rich and delicious. I would recommend sharing with a few other people, as it is way too heavy and fatty to have by oneself. For my entree I got the short rib with cavatelli. The sauce and mushrooms were great, but a little too salty. The short rib was horrible -- short rib should be something that just melts in your mouth, instead this dish was tough and overcooked. Boyfriend had the lamb chop and said it was just ok. For the price, definitely not worth it. For dessert we got the cheesecake lollipop tree, which is pretty fun and whimsical.

The space is gorgeous, love the decor, the feel, the openness and homey chic-ness. It was a 100 deg feel day so we stayed indoors.Anyways, the service and appetizer started well enough, lobster ravioli for her, chicken liver jar for me. Wasn't blown away by mine, but she enjoyed hers' very much. The liver was very finely pasted. It's already liver, do ya have to add a slimy jelly on top to make it more appealing? It smelled too funky for me as well, but I did appreciate the taste of pistachio with it. Next, entree - short rib ravioli for her, spicy shrimp pasta for me. Hers' was way too salty, and mine needed more of it. My dish was something I could have done at home, so taste wise, again, not impressed. There was alot of pasta on my plate too, and a few shrimp, which I expected but it wasn't tasty so I left prob less than half of it there, oh and it wasn't spicy.Dessert, delicious, but in 2 bites was finished.

On a night on which I was not particularly in the mood to have a long meal, we found the service very prompt and had 2 courses in maybe 45-60 minutes and it didn't feel rushed ... appreciated.But the food is really overthought to the point of being gimmicky. The pretzel crab cake for instance .... what you're tasting there is some gloppy sauce and a lot of pretzel, and not really the crab at all. Tasty in a junk-food/TGI Fridays kind of way. But not what you're expecting at this price point in a city where you can get some pretty fine seafood.I also had some duck dish that was served with Chinese pancakes. It was a ""creative"" presentation. But the duck was a gamey (I know, some people like it that way) and there was some kimchi accompanying the dish that wasn't really accomplishing anything. I'm not sure if it was less than the sum of its parts or if the parts weren't all that good -- and furthermore, I'm not sure if the dish was prepared in such a way that I'd be able to tell the difference.

4.0,9/3/2011,"Restaurant Week 2011..... Friday/Lunch.Bread was ordinary but I preferred the carrots because it was something light to snack on without getting full.APPETIZERSTomato Gazpacho: My first time having gazpacho. Had good flavor especially because of the yummy shrimp and refreshing watermelon. If the appetizer was simply just the shrimp and watermelon... I wouldn't mind.Lobster Soup: My mom ordered this. From what I tasted, broth lacked flavor, lobster dumpling was interesting but wasn't anything special.**Extra: Maple Bacon / Dates / Peanut Butter: So I am a big yelper and I saw many reviews that this was a must have. I totally agree! it was pure HEAVEN. Definitely an amazing creation by David Burke. They came out like skewers. A bacon wrapped maple date stuffed with peanut butter and a deep fried grape. $8 for 4.... I thought it was a steal, as I almost ordered an order to go!ENTREESSpicy Spaghetti: A lot of shrimp, not spicy, not really spaghetti. Disappointed simply because it wasn't what I expected..... I am a big any type of pasta person and i LOVE spicy food.... so I was rather disappointed when the ""spaghetti"" was actually asian soba type of noodles. I love asian noodles but again I was looking forward to spaghetti! I didn't complain though because from my understanding the restaurant concept is american ""fusion."" But I did casually mention it to waitress about the so called spaghetti and she stated that they make all their ""spaghetti"" like soba noodles. Eh, sounds like I am being picky but the type of pasta can really change a dish. Wasn't a fan. Short Rib Ravioli: My mom ordered this. Was pretty good, sauce was a tad bit on the salty side! DESSERTSI agree with most of the reviews that the desserts were not anything out of the ordinary.... (I didn't have any high expectations because I read the previous reviews)Apple Tart:  This was better than I thought it would be. I enjoyed it but it really was not anything special.Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake: I didn't order this because I thought it would be too strong, and I was correct. My mom ate all her yummy cherry ice cream before she finished half of this cake because it was so rich!DRINKSThe Breeze: This was recommended by the waiter. The drink lived up to its name. The cucumber was really refreshing.**Side note: I'm not a bloody mary fan but a lot of people ordered it and I thought it looked good.... might try it next time.SERVICE/ATMOSPHEREService was great. The waitress even suggested we order the RW menu because it was such a great deal. The staff was attentive and welcoming... and engaged in casual conversation. That's all I could ask for.I really enjoyed the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant. The only possibly negative thing I noticed that was that there seemed to be a lot of bread crumbs? on the booth seats that they never seem to clean. :PSo I'll be the first to admit I'm not that good with the whole star rating so I gave it 4 stars because I had a great experience and I would definitely go back to try the more creative snacks/jars.Will post pictures later.",1,0,0,Stephanie C.,"NJ, NJ",9,1,0

The mango chutney was ok, the parsley onion ring (1) was an interesting variation on an old standard, but come on David, can't you give us more than one little onion ring?  The cumin bacon...so tasty it should be illegal.Lobster soup: Tasty but too salty, and I like to put a lot of salt on everything. This is a major mistake that's hard to excuse. In the soup were two little dumplings, fashioned out of lobster meat, dough, and lobster shell sticks. Think: lobster wings. A little bland and too doughy. Nice idea though.Short Rib and Cavatelli: Very tender, nice overtones of fennel. Very good but way too salty, even more so than the soup.

4.0,8/14/2011,"I never know if I go on restaurant week if what we get on the set menu options is as good (or more mass produced) than the other options, so it was good that my friend got something off the set menu while I didn't. Overall. I loved the space. Given it was a Friday, at 7pm it was still early so we're not elbow to elbow with the neighbor's conversation (yes, the seating is sort of tight enough you could reach out and take a bite out of their dessert if you tried, but not so tight you could hear what they think of it.) Fer starters, the wines were nice with a reasonably good selection of by-the-glass wines. We had the lobster soup and tomato gazpacho; thought the latter would be a light dish, but with the creme fraiche or something, it was actually pretty hearty. My soup was good, a hair on the salty side, but again - wondering if it was a large batch that was made for the occasion; hey, just speculating. My main, the tuna, was decent - I love that it's rare on the inside and just a hair crunchy on the outside, and the beets are fresh. her dish - off the regular menu, was the scallops which were tasty, and also quite filling. The surprising thing is given the freshness of ingredients that the food has an oomph/weight to it I wasn't expecting. (vs a french restaurant where I half expect to down a stick of butter buried somewhere in the meal before dessert.) Dessert - the Berry Panna Cotta was ok. good, but I was just at a different restaurant 2 days ago with a panna cotta that was superior; this was more like a berry custard with a layer of panna cotta, so if you like to get your berries on, this is a good pick. Rich enough to be satisfying, light enough so you don't feel sick. Perfect. The meringue fingers on it were a great addition . The service was great; friendly and attentive; they gave us a little chocolate to-go thing, one per table only - but when I asked for a second so not to deprive one of us who'd have to battle for it, he was able to 'make an exception' and give it to us. That was brownie points. (though I'm not sure why he had to mention 'well, it's technically 1 per table...' I wonder if our tab were larger if he'd say the same thing.)

It is a chilled tomato soup with bits of shrimp and crispy watermelon.  It is light, refreshing, and appetizing.  A great lead into dinner.  Who knew watermelon is such a great compliment and a perfect ingredient for soup.  I highly recommend this.(Entree) Pork ChopMost of us are probably not big fans of pork, I myself am one.  My boyfriend ordered the ribs so I thought let's switch it up and ordered this.  My choice is definitely rewarding.  The porkchop comes with 2 crispy onion rings topped with 2 strips of bacon.  The pork chop itself is tender and not dry at all.  It was very scrumptious and really made me have second thoughts about trying out pork at restaurants now.  My boyfriend tried it too and after tasting the pork chop, he said he would rather have that instead of his baby back ribs.(Dessert) Peanut butter jelly cakeYummy! Very rich and flavorful, the ""jelly"" actually comes in the form of the sorbet.  However, the sorbet is sooooo sour, I don't even know if it was balancing the chocolate cake.  I enjoyed the cake nevertheless.Overall, I was content with my selection.  Most of us ordered the same thing, the other set was the lobster dumpling soup, ribs in mushroom truffle sauce, and Panna Cotta.  They were ok, I think I got the winning set though :)ps. this restaurant is surprisingly quite boisterous, we were almost screaming to continue our conversation.  Just don't expect to come here for a romantic dinner.",0,0,0,Kelly C.,"Marlton, NJ",270,418,674

It was such a large portion, shocking.. for restaurant week. The deserts were meh, unfortunately. Maybe we were just too full.

The waitor and the server were excellent and informative. All this culminates to a score of 5 stars.The food: I had the tomato gazpacho and my friend got the lobster soup. Tomato gazpacho was the perfect way to start my meal- so light, so refreshing, and the cheese, shrimp & watermelon completed the dish with elegance. We both got the pork chops and just like the reviewers said, the portion was unbelievably huge. The meat was juicy and tender. Sweet-glazed bacons, mango chutney & onion rings? YES, please. I'm not sure if they all worked cohesively on one dish, but each component separately were prepared very nicely. Dessert brings down my food review. I think that they ones left for RW are the two weakest dishes and so I was a little disappointed by their lack of options. My friend's panna cotta was good, but I felt their proportions were off (aka too small). My apple tart wasn't the right texture. It really failed as a pastry.

4.0,7/25/2011,"Came here for RW.  Food was pretty good (better than DB Townhouse).  We had the tomato gazpacho soup, lobster dumpling soup, pork chops, bbq chicken apple tart and cassis panna cotta.  The tomato gazpacho soup was very refreshing - I liked the fact that they layered in the picked watermelon, the shrimp, and the sweet cheese in the middle.  The lobster dumpling soup was not bad (dumplings could have been tastier).  The pork chops dish was HUGE - it came with two pieces of big fat bacon and two (red) onion rings and a thick-cut bone-in pork chop.  BBQ chicken was very juicy (even the white meat); mac-n-cheese was a bit undercooked.  The apple tart was famazing - crispy and thin (one of the best I've had - my gf who doesn't like apple tart also praised it).  The cassis panna cotta was slightly on the sour side.On top of the pretty good food, service was also quite good (was expecting less since it was RW).  We noticed a guy next to us who kept asking what type of nuts were in each of the dishes and the waiters/waitresses were all very nice and professional about making sure they got the right answers.",1,0,0,Stan P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,182,1

While waiting at the bar, the bartender didn't come over until I literally had to take money out of my wallet and hold it up.3. Then at the table, we were never asked for another drink order even though we were all near empty. 4. Positions were wrong on apps and mains. 5. Had to flag down servers for more water (and still, not asked whether we wanted more drinks - c'mon a table of 5 girls on a Wednesday night always wants to drink!)6. Check on the table before dessert came (really?) - had to ask for our dessert (and felt like a 5-year old doing it)7. Dessert positions were wrong again - which we jokingly accepted, but instead of asking who ordered which, server basically threw them all in the middle of the table as if we were to attack them like pigs to a trough. Said ""I'll go get everyone spoons"" but really meant ""I'll leave you all to snarfing up the desserts you had to ask for."" 8. We tipped 13% in cash, as a reflection of the service.

5.0,7/22/2011,"My friends and I came here for Restaurant Week, and frankly I was a bit iffy considering David Burke Townhouse wasn't too great a couple years ago.  But this restaurant definitely revived my faith in David Burke.  I had the following:Appetizer: Lobster Soup with lobster dumplings/coconut fennel creme/red watercress.The soup was delicious, but the taste of the dumpling part was a bit weird.  I'm so used to the asian dumplings and their thinner wraps, that the thickness of the dumpling definitely surprised me.  Although, I did definitely enjoy the lobster within :)Entree: Scallops & Pork Belly with baby cauliflower and aromatic herb broth.  The scallops were amazing. They literally just melt in your mouth.  The pork belly was also delish, but the skin was a bit tough.Dessert: Apple Tart with apple cider caramel/vanilla ice cream/fennel chip.The dessert was definitely good, but the crust was the best part.  It's also a little less apple-y than other apple tarts I've had, so I liked it for that aspect.AND THE CHERRY ON TOP OF THE SUNDAE???MY FRIENDS AND I MET DAVID BURKEEEE!!! we actually saw him like 4 times and he got us into the rooftop of the James Hotel.  He proceeded to lead us to the bouncer and asked him to take care of us.  So, it was a pretty amazing evening and definitely my favorite RW pick of the season :)",5,2,4,Sarah L.,"Los Angeles, CA",215,176,93

So we not only drank like divas but we also ate like queens.From the treehouse, we moved to the inside bar and then outside on the terrace.

Before I start describing the food, I want to say the layout of the restaurant and the staffs are all top notch. Tables are all well decorated with a simple but modern look.. The staffs are extremely helpful with all of our questions. Erin, Joseph, Kate and Nora all served/waited on us and we enjoyed every minutes interacting with them (Much props to David Burke for hiring great staffs).On to the food: we had 3 starters (Lobster soup, Maple bacon covered dates with peanut butter and Pretzel crab cake)  The lobster soup comes with three lobster dumplings made from fresh lobster meat that sits on a bed of soup.  The Maple bacon dates was an explosion of favors in my mouth; love the peanut butter taste.  Lastly the pretzel crab cake was one of the best thing I ever tasted.  (I posted a photo of it). Fresh crab meat with tiny pretzels lay on top forming a candy bar like crab cake.  For the main dishes, we had the Crispy Tuna and the Spicy Spaghetti.  The tuna was a bit dry to my taste but the crispy outside was good.  I really enjoyed the spicy spaghetti.  The prawns like all other sea food we tried was fresh. The spicy kick of the spaghetti came from the curry spices and the paste was cooked perfectly. Overall, a culinary adventure I suggest everyone should if they are in the SOHO area.

1.0,7/16/2011,"I had a very disappointing three-course lunch at David Burke Kitchen yesterday.  It began with Lobster Soup.  I'd had the lobster dumplings before, and the two included were good, but the soup was watery and flavorless.  For the main course I ordered the Short Rib And Sweet Pea Ravioli.  What I got was a *single* raviolo.  Perhaps someone should let Burke know that ravioli is plural and implies more than one?  Further, the item did not mention mushrooms at all in the menu.  It should have, because this dish was 80% mushrooms. Two dishes down, I had high hopes for Chocolate Caramel Fudge Cake (with salted caramel).  The courses had come at a normal pace up until now, so after a normal wait I expected to be served.  Our service slowed.  Not a waiter in sight.  We waited, and waited some more.  Surely we're waiting on a fresh piece of that delicious warm cake.  Alas, when it finally did arrive it tasted stale and (again) surprisingly flavorless, as if it had been in the freezer for a week and was given time to thaw.  The goat's milk cajeta ice cream tasted like a grocery store brand's French Vanilla.  It's a nice enough looking dining room, and the wait staff was courteous, so if you're going to go (which I cannot recommend) than stay away from the items I ordered.",0,0,0,J.

4.0,7/15/2011,"I love David Burke. I would love to shake his hand.I've eaten at Townhouse many times and absolutely love the menu, decor, and staff. When my mother and I found out Kitchen opened, we knew we had to get there ASAP.Last weekend, we decided to spend the day in the City and knew right away where to have lunch. We were greeted promptly by the hostess and took our seats right away. Within 2 minutes, our server came over to greet us and offer us a beverage.We went with the Prix Fixe lunch menu for $24.07 and a few items on the side because we couldn't resist.We started with the Simple Salad - crisp and crunchy fennel, airy lettuce, tart apples, and a well rounded vinaigarette. After that, we had the Maple Bacon, Date, and Peanut Butter snack. Sounds ... interesting doesn't it? It's DELICIOUS. The salty/sweet bacon that just came out of the pan enveloped the date making it gooey like jam. When you took a bite, it was a flavor explosion. The hint of peanut butter was simply divine, bringing the snack together in one happy morsel! I could've had 10 of these plates.For our meals, I had the Spicy Spaghetti and my Mom had the Crispy Tuna. The spaghetti was spicy alright, but had so much flavor. It was creamy and tangy and the shrimp gave it a slightly sweet finish. Mom's Crispy Tuna was served with fresh fruit on top of a smear of raspberry puree. Oh. MY. GOD. The tuna was sushi grade, wrapped in seawood, with panko breading around it.Complimentary mimosas were served with our meals. They were HUGE. I opted for the iced tea - refreshing and delicious. They served the ice tea with infused simple syrups instead of sugar packets - blueberry, strawberry, mint, basil. Yum. For dessert we decided to share the Cassis Panna Cotta. Creamy, decadent, fresh.

I was a little bummed but Kitchen ended up being WAY better than I ever expected. Sat at the bar before being seated and they brought us yummy seasoned pretzel sticks with mustard oil. We even saw David Burke delivering people's meals and talking to different tables. Lobster soup for appetizer-amazing. Reminded us of a ramen-type broth with big lobster stuffed dumplings in the middle. Not only was it delicious but it was pretty too.BBQ chicken with macaroni and cheese for main meal was great. There was even a cool bacon wrapped soft boiled egg on the side. I ordered the chocolate cake for dessert which was pretty standard. They brought my boyfriend a cherry cobbler because they ran out of what he originally ordered and I ate about 3/4s of his dessert instead of mine. It was amazing. One of the best desserts I've ever tried. The cake was fresh out of the oven, moist on the inside, crunchy on the top, and topped off with vanilla bean ice cream.Everything they brought from the kitchen I was excited to try.

4.0,7/13/2011,"This review is specifically for the Garden portion of DBK, not the downstairs/inside portion.The DBK Garden is essentially a theme restaurant - this is a garden party at David Burke's house.  The patio on which it takes place is delightful (at least in July), with a mix of open air tables, some umbrella-covered ones, and a few cabanas. It's fairly quiet atop the James Hotel, but the atmosphere still feels lively.  There's a pretty even mix of young and old, first dates and married couples, friends and family.  It's lovely, but by no means stuffy.The food and drink sticks to the theme perfectly.  The appetizers are generally light and playful - dressed-up versions of low-brow fare, or casual takes on haute cuisine.  The tuna tartare tacos and the house-cured salmon with pretzels were both wonderful, and surprisingly generous in portion.  The crispy tuna was very good and well-balanced.  I was a little wary of the idea of crispy tuna, but its crispiness in no way weighed down the clean meatiness of seared tuna.  Not to be missed are the fried green tomatoes, which were fantastic - the curry spicing was surprising, but perfectly executed.  While I did not have an opportunity to taste them, the short rib looked delicious, as did the chicken with macaroni and cheese.  For dessert, we decided to forego the lollipop tree, David Burke's signature dessert, and went for the chocolate and caramel layer cake instead.  In a city where chocolate cake is usually a very dull choice, this was definitely the right decision. The salted caramel perfectly offset the richness of the chocolate cake, and the goat's milk ice cream made it an ideal summer treat.For drinks, skip your usual order at the bar, and go for one of DBK Garden's specials.  Each captures the essence of outdoor summer dining in its own way.  Like any good summer drink (think of a Pimm's Cup) should, the Rabbit Hunter (bourbon, ginger beer, fresh mint, lime) sneaks up on you.  Even the beef jerky-containing Border (reposado tequila, mezcal blanco, ginger, agave, beef jerky), which one might expect to kick you in the face, was delightfully refreshing.  The service is friendly and attentive, but getting a seat, even with a reservation, is not easy.  We waited 20 minutes past our reservation time (after showing up a few minutes early), and a group ahead of us waited over 40 minutes.  DBK garden is delightful, but I'm not sure I would go more than once a summer.  The meal was excellent and the atmosphere spot-on, but it may be cheaper to actually befriend David Burke and secure an invitation to an actual garden party.  DBK Garden truly is a treat, though, and one worth sharing.",1,0,0,Evan S.,"Manhattan, NY",4,33,0

I would have to say my favorites were the ants on a log (bone marrow), ravioli (which we were told had won and award for being one of the top ten pasta dishes in New York) and the pork chops. Everything was so rich and flavorful. We'll have to come again for another marathon of food just to try the other stuff we were too stuffed to try. Some people were saying the service was rude. They were really nice to us and quite attentive. I did try to come here a month ago without a reservation and I was promptly told that it was impossible, so I would make sure to reserve a spot where you want to sit.The decor is pretty cool.

EMPTY tables all over. we were then seated by a separate hostess + check in system altogether. can we have the mimosa included in the prix fixe replaced by a smoothie with or without additional cost? NO (and that's understandable)it was just 2 of us and we got this table without an umbrella. the scorching sun starts to creep in over our shoulders and before we knew it we were in full exposure. so we kindly ask if we can have an umbrella? - NO.

I am sure he was a nice enough guy, but I didn't think that he was helpful at all. We asked questions about the appetizers, and they were answered with little knowledge of the menu and how the food was prepared; the food came out very differently to how he had explained. The food was served with no silverware or napkins...We had to wait an extra 10+ minutes after we asked for it. I don't think we were asked if everything was ok.Main entrees took a long time to come out, and so we twiddled our thumbs for a while...As afore mentioned, the space is great for a warm evening, but I wouldn't come back here again.

4.0,6/11/2011,"First time here, and it was a pretty good experience. There are 2 levels of restaurant. The 'Treehouse' is a large rooftop patio. It's stunning, and the city views are pretty amazing, but we weren't able to get a table up here due to it's ""full capacity"" (perhaps we didn't fit the douchebag standard? LOL). We ended up on the lower level, the 'Kitchen'. The host/manager was very funny, warm, and accommodating. Talk about a great first impression upon entering. They get extra points for that alone (I always believe the experience starts once you meet the host/hostess).The food here was fresh, well made, beautifully prepared, unique, and very tasty. We started off with the snacks and jars. For the snacks we had a delicious quad of dates filled with peanut butter, and wrapped with bacon. The sweet and saltiness of this snack was delicious, and very 'melt in your mouth'. Tasty and inventive. Score! We had the chicken liver pate with pistachios jar. This concept isn't new to us, as we've had BLT's delicious liver spread in a jar. The only difference is that BLT's is warm, while David Burke Kitchen's is served sealed and cold. I would prefer the warm one. Great concept though. They get points for trying. For apps, we shared the market salad, which was good, and the house special--the softshell crab quesadilla, which was not really a quesadilla, but I get it. For dinner, I had the short rib cavatelli--fantastic, and my husband had the scallops & pork belly, which he also loved.

3.0,6/6/2011,"We came sometime in May, to celebrate my bf's birthday.  I was so excited to come here after the successful experience we had at Townhouse during last summer's restaurant week.  The fact that Kitchen is only a few months old (opened in Feb 2011), further contributed to the anticipation.  But, for a David Burke establishment, I was expecting shooting stars.  And, although there were some stellar aspects about Kitchen, this celestial body did not shine as brightly as hoped.There are many things that work at Kitchen.  The decor for instance, is exceptional.  Located within the mod, James Hotel, Kitchen is contemporary with large photo prints of local farmers, regular, working-class heroes, and the furniture is light-colored, sleek and unfussy, matching the simple but elegant architecture.  Kitchen does a fantastic job at balancing a casual atmosphere, but still maintaining a very nice sophistication, which marries well with the entire ethos of the James Hotel.  (By the way, the hotel's got a rooftop bar with a nice deck you can escape to post meal).Another element that is more parts winning over failing is the Kitchen menu.  What I've come to expect from David Burke, which, he most always delivers on, is a beautiful, aesthetically appealing restaurant, with a menu that also piques your senses.  His food creations are whimsical, yet grounded, a fact perfectly demonstrated by the dishes we ordered.  In this same vein however, the menu must also take the blame for some of Kitchen's shortcomings.  Some items were just a bit too wacky, and clever as it were, made you sort of feel completely ridiculous trying to eat them.  On the good end, things we enjoyed were the ""bacon date"" appetizer (buttery and savory, the salty maple bacon and sweet date and peanut butter just evaporates in your mouth), ""lettuce wedge"" (though pricey, this is something you should not miss!  the iceberg is fresh and crisp and the toppings of candied pecans, blue cheese, and the tomato vinaigrette are delicious), the ""jalepeno fries"" (served in the cutest, and smallest, deep-fryer, these fries are unbeatable. The jalepeno is presented atop as thin slices, so you are not overwhelmed with its spiciness, and those with low heat tolerance such as myself, will appreciate the option of not having to eat any jalepenos, while still enjoying the jalenpeno-infused fries).  I also enjoyed my main dish, the ""Black Bass"" (a delicate, and perfectly-cooked piece of fish, with a very nice green herb butter, and an assortment of vegetables.  Not mind-blowing, but no complaints nonetheless).Some items we did NOT take to, were the ""White Bean"" jar.  The filling of canelli (?) beans pureed into this tiny, glass jar, made me feel as though, I was spreading baby food onto my slices of crusty bread.  The flavor was tasty, but it just felt very odd and unnecessary to encase this within a jar.  The ""ants on a log"" were pretty bland.  The presentation looked a bit silly, and I was completely over the novelty of the name of this dish once it came to our table and I tried it.   My boyfriend ordered the Tuna entree, and though, it looked very beautiful, I wasn't so keen on how it tasted.  The tuna, somehow did not seem as light and fresh as I am used to when dining at Japanese restaurants.  The dessert of the day, was an utter head-scratcher.  We ordered the ""red velvet cake in a jar"", and I knew I should have learned my lesson with the white bean jar, but I thought I'd give this whole, jar thing another spin around the wheel.  Sadly, this was a failure.  Again, two adults scooping food from a jar is not a good look.  I felt utterly foolish and juvenile.  We were two bibs short of a Gerber advertisement.  It was also slightly messy to dig all the way to the bottom of the jar to get a spoonful of the red velvet cake when all the whipped cream spilled over the jar.  Service was also a bit lacking.  I made a reservation, we came on time, got seated pretty quickly, but did not get our menu for at least 15 minutes.  The waiter was delightful, but because it was a busy night, he wasn't as attentive as expected.  I realize, it's a new restaurant and they are still trying to work out some kinks and develop a rhythm, but as a diner, we still felt slighted.  The complimentary truffles was a nice touch, though.  I was saddened that we could not meet the man himself, David Burke, who was there that night, running the ship.  The best part (as in worst part - hello, sarcasm), were the two geriatric,  prima donnas sitting to our left, who were so unbearably snooty, I almost felt a sadistic joy in whipping out my SLR and snapping photos of each item that came to our table.  I didn't want to be an annoyance to other diners, I was fully prepared to take my photos san flash as a courtesy, but the very nasty glances of disapproval coming from them, really served as a catalyst for me to be voluntarily obnoxious.  Not Kitchen's fault, but, only 3 stars this time!",4,1,4,Jennifer C.,"Elmhurst, NY",559,645,1350
4.0,6/4/2011,"Since it's warm weather I opted to sit in the Treehouse area; the cabanas are nice with billowy curtains and protect from sun as well as rain. Reminds me of Tableau at the Wynn. They seem very strict with what menu you can order from ie the brunch cutoff is exactly 3:30 and there seems to be too many menus made up of the same dishes just omitting various parts ie the bar menu, the garden menu, the dinner menu, the lunch menu, breakfast menu, brunch menu....   Started with  asparagus spears served with burrata and honeydew; fresh and delicious (although it would be hard to mess that up). Bison tartar consisted of chopped bison pieces with egg salad on a bed of smoked tomato and fingerling crisps on the side.  It was pretty good but not something I'd order again.  Onto the pretzel crab cake (waitresses pick); I'm not big on crab cake but this one was nice and light in texture and kudos for the whimsical presentation (layers of crab cake and thin pretzel like a lasagna).   It came with green peppercorn and white beer although I would never have known if it wasn't on the menu.  Pistachio chicken liver mousse came in a jar; succulent texture, fluffy yet creamy.   I would have preferred softer toast points instead of the crisp style toast  it came with.  The cheesecake lollipop tree is always good to share, its the same as at DB Townhouse. Since I'm taking a 'white week' I opted for an iced white/green/floral tea drink- I actually thought it was water- not much taste.  Also tried the iced hibiscus drink; refreshing but not much flavor.  It's a good brunch spot since you can enjoy quality food while sitting outside; may sound simplistic but it's something you often have to wait a long time for at any place worthwhile. Especially if you live around here it's a good alternative to the mediocre food on West Broadway. I'd come back at a different time of day as I am dying to try the Lola duck with maitake mushroom and fois gras corn cake as well as the short rib cavatelli.",2,2,5,Elena V.,"New York, NY",104,191,232
4.0,6/4/2011,Atmosphere: 5 stars. Classy. Ask to sit outside on the 2nd floor in a cabana if the weather is good.Food: 5 stars. Best french toast I've had in NYC. My friend had the eggs benedict and loved them too. Bacon was skippable. 2 course brunch prix fix gets you almost any 2 dishes off the menu and a drink for $30.Service: 3 starts. Perhaps they're understaffed but the waitress was pretty curt with us in a cooler than thou way. Whole meal lagged because she either couldn't keep up with 10 tables or didn't care to.,3,1,1,Jazmin H.,"Oakland, CA",647,184,107
3.0,6/3/2011,"First off, I will say that even though I gave this place three stars, I will still highly recommend this restaurant, especially the Garden, for a lunchtime meal. The food was great, the lunch prix fixe for $24 was a steal, and the outdoor setting was picturesque. I took away two stars for the very spotty service and the fact that it can get very hot up there. The dinner menu has many pricey items, but lunch was a steal at 24 dollars for three courses. Appetizers included salmon pastrami (eh) and lobster soup (a clear broth with 3 lobster wontons). My tuna entree was amazing -- wrapped in seaweed and panko and flash fried so that the outside was crispy and inside was still rare. The beet sauce it came with was delicious as well as the veggies on the side. Mac n cheese was okay... a light green macaroni with a very light covering of sauce (not too heavy). Desserts were the best part of the meal! Berry panna cotta - AMAZING. Usually panna cotta can get too creamy and sweet towards the end, but this one was balanced out by another tart berry panna cotta layer on top. Apple tart was also very flaky and smooth. The Garden is the Kitchen's outdoor terrace with views of 6th Avenue as cars head towards/out of the Holland Tunnel. Not the greatest view but it's a wide open space and at least you are not looking into anybody's apartment. Beware that the two-tops on the right side of the terrace will get a lot of sun exposure and will leave you and your food melting if you're eating up there past noon. By the time we were eating dessert, we were roasting and looking for the quickest way to get out of there. Hopefully they will sort this out by getting umbrellas or a large canopy for the area because the heat will only get worse. Service was very spotty and I chalked it up to the fact that it was Memorial Day and that this place is relatively new. Our servers were overwhelmed with too many tables and didn't have the time to check up on us. We made multiple requests for olive oil, water, utensils, and though we were not ignored, it seemed that everybody was so busy running around that things were not brought very quickly. Each time the runners came up with plates, they had no idea which table they were for. It all seemed like new restaurant kinks that will eventually get worked out, but for such a swank place you think they would have hired better trained staff. I still recommend this place for lunch though and I will definitely visit again for the food and atmosphere (maybe on a cloudier day).",2,0,1,Kathy L.,"New York, NY",37,118,6
2.0,5/31/2011,"I ate at the Kitchen's new ""Garden"" tonight, the Garden part of which was the best part.  The James' hotel terrace being a wonderful place to enjoy a gorgeous NYC spring eve.The Kitchen piece was ultra disappointing with the ultra being added because I KNOW David Burke can do better.  Maybe he's just stretched himself too thin.Let's start with the service: a total disaster.  We had about 4  servers help us during the meal and each was more clueless than the last.  Want to know what are the specials?  Oops, gotta ask.  Want to know what kind of ice creams and sorbets they're serving tonight?  Oops, gotta ask.  Wines by the glass?  Oops, gotta ask.  Can we get an extra 2 plates to share the fried green tomatoes?  Oops, gotta ask - wait before you go ask, why don't you just leave the tomatoes on the table and we can figure it out.The food was barely better - at least the fish dishes.In summary, not worth the trip downtown, let alone the overpriced tab.",6,2,3,David A.,"Paris, France",121,386,31
5.0,5/30/2011,"This was one of the best meals I've had a long time and as a New Yorker and one who could kindly be considered handicapped in the kitchen (to the detriment of my chef parents), I eat out probably 6 days a week.I am a fan of the David Burke empire though they all aren't ranked equally. I have to put David Burke Kitchen at the top of his empire. The food was a delightful surprise in a city of wonderful restaurants. One of the more clever elements of the restaurant is the center bar that acts as a ""kitchen"" where meat dishes are sliced and sauces are prepared near tableside. In a move that celebrates the sense of smell, diners are treated to the scent of rich broths frothing on the center bar.The atmosphere is relaxed, a mix of business and tourist. Cool tones of grey, white and maroon mix with warm natural elements of wood and fresh flowers. Located subterranean in the James Hotel, there is still a sense of natural light in the space. To my fortunate luck, I had three meals scheduled there within a week - a dinner, drinks and appetizers, and a brunch. The first, a dinner, was a delight. The following meal below:Ants on a Log: escargot on bone marrow - rich and decadent.Chicken Liver Prune Pistachio Jar - smooth and creamy; generous portions as you'll finish the bread before the chicken liver!Bacon Peanut Butter Dates - a culinary masterpiece that elevates an ordinary tapas dish into one of genius with the unexpected tempura grape accent.Pretzel Crab Cake - a favorite of the group; crunchy pretzel topping over a soft and fresh crab cake.Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffles - came with a ranch dipping sauce that combined with the maple syrup resulted in an surprisingly good combination. Soy Honey Lola Duck - best duck I've had in the city; rich taste without an overwhelming gaminess; came with a fois gras corn cake.Scallops and Pork Belly - this was the average dish of the entire meal; arguably well-cooked but nothing that made it a stand-out.Smoked Beef Fat & Jalapeno Fries - also would pass next time; good but nothing special. Monkey Bread - absolutely amazing flavors and despite that fact it's listed ""for two,"" it fed a group of four girls with leftovers that you can take home in a beautiful round tin. Sangria - as good as any in the city but not better than most. For drinks and apps, I had the same chicken liver appetizer and I tried their wine selection. Instead of the main dining room, we drank at the Treehouse, located upstairs but still a part of the DB Kitchen, for a different feel. During a Saturday afternoon, the bar was relatively empty but filled up around 6pm. The atmosphere was a negative. The bar is awkwardly situated in an entryway area that opens out to the beautiful deck and a separate balcony. Unfortunately the bar keeps the doors to the balcony open and it seems to be a gathering place for smokers. Additionally, it was amateur hour at Treehouse bar with slow service, glasses haphazardly stacked and wet spots all over the bar. The sole waitress spent the entire time we were there arranging and re-arranging the bar furniture - very distracting. Stick with the downstairs bar. Oddly enough, it also seemed to be a gathering place for children's birthday parties. For brunch, we had the following:Fried Chicken and Cheddar Waffles - not as good as the dinner version but still very tasty.Lobster Soup - average; broth was not as rich as it could have been and tasted thin; the lobster dumplings were fresh but could have used some salt.David Burke Kitchen is ideal for a relaxed dinner with friends or a power lunch with business associates. The downstairs dining area is my preferred space for an adult upscale experience. Although I've been several times this past week, I haven't yet moved David Burke Kitchen to the back of the rotation.

2.0,5/24/2011,"Not sure what exactly went wrong during my visit at David Burke Kitchen. The night was primed for an excellent dining experience, but somewhere between the prosciutto wrapped asparagus and the chocolate injected donut, something did not match up.The first thing I really noticed at David Burke kitchen was that the food came quickly, but not in a good way. It didn't allow you a second to truly enjoy what was in front of you. It seemed like the waiters were on an assembly line, churning food out for the masses from the makeshift-center display or buffet style mechanisms in the middle of the room.That being said, I did feel that some of the dishes were quite imaginative, but lacked the execution necessary to really make them pop! Like a 5mph fender bender, the pretzel crab cake barely made a dent on not only my appetite, but my palate. Lacking flavor and not nearly enough texture as the name implies, I definitely wanted more from this dish. The bacon/dates/peanut butter app had a nice combination of sweet and savory, but lacked that umph necessary to take it to the next level. This dish could've soared high as a hippie if it were goat cheese infused (in my opinion).The highlight of the app round was most definitely the fluke & uni sashimi. Fresh from the ocean is an understatement; this dish had texture and nice round flavors. For an entree I ordered the Short Rib with Cavatelli (how could anyone say no to Cavatelli!? It's unheard of!). What a whimsical dish, in the sense that each element was supposed to ignite the flavor spectrum and yet... each additional element felt more of a detriment to the dish. I am mostly referring to the truffle margarine that was plopped directly on top of my short rib. It was definitely overbearing and took over the entire flavor of the dish, distracting from the perfectly cooked short rib and the delightfully al dente cavatelli. Had it not been for that dang truffle, this dish would've brought my rating of David Burke's up!Finally came dessert. This was definitely a highlight and probably the best indication of David Burke's creativity. My favorite dish was the simplistic donut holes with small bottles of flavored sauces that allowed patrons to inject chocolatey-goodness into each lil ball of fluff, therefore igniting each bite with an infusion of sweet tasty joy!Overall, in my opinion David Burke's benefits more because of its location than it does for its food. There are far better places to spend that much money on a meal, but at least there were some highlights that night.",5,0,1,Jonathan J.,"New York, NY",633,163,4

5.0,5/21/2011,"Simply put, an amazing experience.I went here last night with some ladies for my friend's bachelorette dinner. She doesn't like lots of attention, and a phallus on a tiara is not her speed, so we went the glamourous/elegant route-- drinks on the 18th floor of the Standard, followed by dinner at David Burke.We had the most amazing dinner! The peas tortellini starter made everyone stop talking and close their eyes; the peanut butter/bacon/date/grape situation was out of this world. (The winner of the main courses was the short ribs cavatelli-- it's INSANELY good, a very rich autumn-y dish but still delicious.) While there were a couple of minor mixups (the wrong drink getting brought, that kind of thing) they were SO NICE about it and the mixups really ended up with us getting a whole bunch of excellent drinks on the house! (I liked the sangria a lot, not too too sweet.)The best was that in the beginning of the evening I secretly asked the manager if there was anything special he could do for the bachelorette, and he said, ""I'll see what I can do with the pastry chefs."" They actually created a custom dessert out of selections of the dessert menu, arranged BEAUTIFULLY like a naked lady and man-- hilarious, bachelorette-y, but still totally glamourous and delicious! In short, we ate like royalty, drank like fish and even wrote a drunken limerick for our waiter, Joshua, who was nice enough to pretend to like it.I will send everyone I know to eat here, and I'll come back whenever I can.

1.0,4/28/2011,"I had one of the worst dining experiences of my entire life. I'm truly baffled how anyone could give this place four or five stars. Let me preface this by saying, I eat out a lot, and it takes a real lot for me to ever give such a low rating to an establishment. Let the story begin.My beloved and I went there two days ago for our anniversary dinner.  The drinks: We wanted a Lambrusco, but there weren't any on the menu, so the waiter sent over the sommelier. He was the worst I've ever encountered. He literally just said, ""We don't have that and I don't know what else to suggest to you."" SERIOUSLY??? Well, it's a red, so maybe another red minus the bubbles might be a start? His demeanor was cold and he talked for a whole two seconds about a rosé and then kind of left. It felt like he couldn't be bothered. We decided to drink by the glass. I ordered the sangria (with St. Germain and fresh oj, my fave). It arrived with a bland pickled beet and a carrot resting on the rim through a skewer. All I tasted was the tannins, minimal sweetness, it wasn't fresh or fruity. I then ordered The Breeze (vodka, mint, cucumber) a very strong, sickly sweet concoction with no balance in flavor.On to the appetizers: We ordered the Pretzel-Crusted Crab Cake (greasy, but edible), the very salty Bison Tartar (this was actually pretty good, thanks to the wasabi in the whipped egg salad that decorated the top), and to top it off we ordered the Fluke & Uni Sashimi (cured cucumber, orange tea vinaigrette). It was basically soy sauce splashed on top of unseasoned fish. The worst part was that the fish was bad, like reaaally bad. In the last few bites, I tasted that rotten flavor you get from rancid fish. It was so bad I had to ask the waiter for a napkin to spit it out.Main courses: We ordered the Pressed Head-On Prawns (spicy spaghetti, zucchini) and the special, a lamb chop (medium rare with salad greens), and the Smoked Beef Fat & Jalapeno French Fries for the table. The food arrived and they placed it in front of us, but then took it away to cut it up to place back in front of us (which took about 8 minutes while our bland, vegetable oil-laden fries got cold--they didn't place them on the table while we waited.) We watched one server drop a piece of lamb chop on his station while plating and just put it back on the dish to serve. Now, my prawns were not fresh. They were practically disintegrating in my mouth, yet rubbery and overpoweringly fishy. I literally had an uncontrollable gag reflex after trying to eat my fourth bite. This has NEVER happened to me before. I had to stop and breath out of fear that I would be sick right there on the table. My dinner was pretty much done at that point. My partner's lamb, which was supposed to be medium rare, was pretty raw. There were stringy tendons and way too much blood. (At the end of the meal, they were polite enough not to charge for the two bad seafood dishes).I wanted to leave, but my partner convinced me to at least have something sweet since it might help settle my stomach. I ordered the Oreo Chocolate Mousse Cake with caramel ice cream. This, at last, was the best thing I had all evening. It was truly delicious, slightly crunchy on the bottom, perfectly rich, and that's why they get one star.",2,2,0,Keisha F.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,29,0

4.0,3/21/2011,"The name David Burke calls to mind Top Chef and Angry Lobster and creative cuisine.  Although a few items on the menu at David Burke Kitchen hint at a flicker of genius, the creativity is a tad lacking and for me is why this resto is getting only a four star rating (also because I spent the entire day looking at the menu with mouth watering over the idea of mushroom mac and cheese with duck fat only to find out that its not on the menu anymore...unless you show up on the right day).What I ate: Bison Tartare (delicious and simple)Ants on a Log (hint of genius)Lobster Risotto (special of the night, Lobster night) - this deserves special attention since its lobster deshelled and about a pound worth draped lovingly over creamy risotto.  Its decadent.  Though its missing a little something special, if you ask me.  Monkey Bread - just like when you were a kid but better and served with as much ice cream as people that you have at your table.  Great for sharing!Also we got to meet David which was a real treat, even if he seemed a little distracted.",0,0,0,Karen L.,"New York, NY",40,37,3
3.0,3/20/2011,"I walked in a few minutes late for my reservation and grabbed a drink at the bar while I waited for my girlfriend to arrive- 15 minutes late but  nonetheless, we were seated immediately.  I believe this restaurant opened in January and I must say, they seem to have already ironed out the kinks in two months.  The patrons walked in wearing anything from cocktail dresses to jeans and sneakers- which speaks to the hype around the food- people are literally just here to eat, or should be.  I saw people on dates and thought they must've been going for unromantic/casual.  The food is excellent and it's seasoned with great service.  My beef tartare appetizer was delicious and the baby octopus as well.  I ordered two good sized appetizers because the entrees didn't really jump off the page.  My girlfriend ordered dessert which looked amazing even though I didn't partake.  Three little ice cream sandwiches and  a bowl of dusted donut holes with raspberry, chocolate and caramel sauce- but I wasn't seduced.  Even for a restaurant that's all about the food - the decor is lame.  There are all kinds of cheap looking ceramic animal  statuettes, cookie jars, pitchers, etc on the shelves near the bar and the entire restaurant features huge photos featuring various farmers.  Although it's environmentally conscious to know where your food is sourced from, I don't want to stare at the guy who might've sold the chef a lobster.  I actually looked for the bearded Sam Adams brewery guy who I thought might be hiding amongst his contemporaries on the wall.",0,0,0,Suzie C.,"New York, NY",41,78,0
5.0,3/10/2011,A little worried at first after browsing the menu online seeing it was not like Townhouse or DB Chicago and I am glad it was not!  We walked in and asked David himself for his suggestion for the night and he went on to say the fried chicken and waffles.  The best fried chicken I have ever had on top of a cheddar apple buttermilk waffle.  It came with a tabasco like sauce and a thick ranch dressing on the side.  The dressings themselves were worth the order.  I had an excellent beer to compliment it with and they had a very delicious looking drink menu also.  I will be coming back every day of the week to try the other specials.Service was on top of everything.  Quickly attentive to low water and food was served quicker than the other DB restaurants I have been too.Well done David Burke.,0,0,0,Peter K.,"Manhattan, NY",244,557,33
4.0,2/27/2011,"Ok lets get the weirdness out of the way first.  The farm decor, slash, trendy space doesn't quite blend together.  The gingham napkins amidst the bizzare lifesized photos of produce you're about to devour can make even the most sort out carnivour a little uneasy.  Especially the one of a human clutching a chicken tightly under his armpit.  The only thing missing in that photo was the guy boasting serial killer eyes, frothing at the mouth and holding a knife to the chook's throat.Moving on, and placing the decor aside lets get down to business - the food!  And for a restaurant which just recently opened its doors, it's doing a great job in reeling people in with a tantalizing & innovative menu.The dates wrapped in bacon and dipped in peanut butter were orgasmic.  Yes orgasmic!  I could have had them as my appetizer, main and dessert but I opted in trying some other interesting items in hope of a similar down-there experience.The farm fresh salad, although not necessarily mind blowing, was the freshest I've had in a long time.For my main I chose the rabbit, in hope it was going to knock my socks off the way the ever so famous rabbit claims to do...but unfortunately it was a let down.  If only they had placed some of those bacon wrapped dates on my plate to get me back on track.Now onto dessert - everything on the menu sounded devine, but we opted for the lollipop tree.  It's a cute way of serving mouth watering assorted flavored cheescake, the only downfall is that the steel tree they are strategically placed in is a tad too high and you can't see the person sitting across the table from you.  At that point though, your belly's content, the down there sizzle has returned thanks to dessert, and you couldn't care less about the people at your table when you're trying to stop yourself from flipping your head back and moaning.",2,1,0,Karyna K.,"New York, NY",42,140,0

3.0,2/25/2011,"This restaurant tried very hard to be innovative and different, and I think it came close, but just missed the spot. My boyfriend and I ordered the shaved cheese with honey and olives as a snack to start with. This was nothing interesting. Then we ordered the pretzel crab cake, which was definitely innovative, it was good, but I'm not a crab connoisseur, so i guess i can't really comment too much on it. I ordered the rabbit, which I did not realize was stuffed with sausage. eh, i would have preferred the loin of rabbit, which there was very little of in this dish. My boyfriend ordered the pork dish with cheek, and the pork was really dry! It had a decent flavor, but I really can't stand dry meat. For dessert, we really wanted to get the ice cream sandwiches and donuts, but since I'm allergic to nuts, the ice cream sandwiches were ruled out. So we ordered boring apple tart instead, nothing to write home about. The wine list was quite expensive too! The cheapest bottle on the list was 55 dollars.

4.0,2/23/2011,"Went for dinner with a friend Sunday night.  Very friendly staff, easy going yet super efficient.  We're pretty light eaters so opted to share the Camembert ravioli with lobster sausage to start.  It was excellent, but only ONE little ravioli and two pieces of sausage.  One more ravioli would have made a huge difference here.  Main courses, on the other hand, were huge, but not overwhelmingly so.  I had the short ribs, my friend had the pork chop.  Both were outstanding.  The meat was so tender, no knife required, and it practically melted in your mouth.  We shared both entrees and couldn't decide which we liked more.  We skipped desert, but were given a cute little package of chocolates, which I forgot to take with me!  Nice gesture though.  All in all a great experience--excellent food, cool space, great service.  Would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.",1,0,0,Adrienne K.,"New York, NY",0,59,0
4.0,2/20/2011,"David Burke Kitchen is in the James Hotel downstairs with a separate entrance. The expansive design is impressive for letting a lot of light into a below ground space. I went with a friend to brunch at her suggestion, when I arrived she was already seated looking over the menu (I really hate when a place is empty and they don't let you sit until everyone is there). The menu is interesting with a combo of lunch and brunch food ranging from burger to poached egg & omelettes. They have filled ""jars"" (i.e. eggplant ricotta & tomato) that come with baguette slices that are amazing. They also have a grilled cheese and tomato soup which we were disappointed was not  a sandwich and soup but just soup. But there are many items to choose from. I had the baked eggs with angry cauliflower and bacon and my friend had the lobster eggs. My eggs were fantastic and I am giving them 4 stars alone! There were a lot of other veggies in there too that they didn't mention though, and the cauliflower wasn't angry at all so I added tobasco. It came with plain white toast but sourdough would have been sooo much better. The cappucino was just ok. My friend liked her dish but I thought it was just ok. The food took a pretty long time to come out but I imagine they are trying to iron out the kinks because the place was well staffed and the staff were very nice. It's pricey but since its a hotel I guess that is to be expected. I would like to come back and try dinner!",1,1,1,Chris S.,"Boston, MA",2,71,0
4.0,2/17/2011,"Very cool space, you're below ground and upstairs is the Treehouse Bar also inside the James Hotel. Started off with drinks- Rabbit Hunter- delicious if you like Bourbon- which you should- muddled with ginger beer, mint and lemon. Have to say- could have just had all the starters and apps and skipped the entree. Shared the wedge salad which was delectable and worth alone going back, I had the lobster dumpling soup and friend had split pea- both were delicious but very salty. Onto the pretzel crab cakes- amazing- real pretzel stick, white beer foam, light and flaky- delicious. Was stuffed by this point but could have fit in the salmon pastrami with mustard and pretzel or the jars filled with seafood or tomato ricotta- but had ordered the Hake (fish) it was good- but wasnt blown away- again salty, a bit thick (cauliflower puree), the clams were good- didnt like the slices of red pepper. The desserts looked incredible but was just too stuffed. Overall the food was amazing and would go back in a heart beat. Ironically I wasnt a huge fan of the decor- felt mishmoshed - loved the wood ceiling and the smoked glass kitchen partition- but the tables and chairs felt out of place along with the huge pictures of people holding what is about to be your dinner...Overall a great experience and wasnt absurdly priced",0,0,0,Alexis R.,"New York, NY",36,21,0
4.0,2/16/2011,"I don't suffer from hypertension nor have been diagnosed with hypernatremia...not quite yet, anyhow. But I do love salt.  It's a necessity when it comes to food. Our evening meal at David Burke Kitchen [DBK] reminded me how crucial salt plays a part when it comes to completing the perfect dining experience.As soon as you step through the double glass doors at the James Hotel New York and wind yourself down the steps you will start to embrace the chef's farm-to-table concept at the one-week old, David Burke Kitchen.  A large and open dining room that resembles an indoor picnic is what you get. Gingham blue napkins, wood panel ceilings, and farmers' portraits set the mood.  A bread table sits in the middle of the dining room with David's famous duck-press gleaming away.The menu is very well balanced, in my opinion, with many choices from different sections including: snacks, jars, starters, mains, and the daily dish-of-the-day.  Out of the ""snacks"" we tried the Chipped Cheese with olives and honey.  The cheese was an aged, domestic white cheddar that resembled grana padano to some extent.  The cheese paired well with its Italian olives (forgot the name) and real ""comb"" honey.The Salmon Pastrami with pretzle and mustard was average and nothing out of the ordinary.  Just think of a pretzle stick with one of its ends wrapped with cured salmon with pastrami seasoning.Out of the ""jars"" section, we ordered the Chicken Liver with prunes and pistachios.  The presentation was cool (check the pictures) and it also came with toast points on the side.  The liver was very smooth and had a delicate flavor, but the gelee they used to top the liver off had an unusual regurgitation-type of flavor that didn't sit too well on our palates.From the ""starters"" section, we couldn't pass up chef Burke's signature dish: Ants on a Log. You get split beef marrow bones topped with escargot, porcini mushrooms, parsley, and garlic. Three pieces of thin croutons stand in between the bones, while a bed of fennel fronds decorate the plate. I really liked this dish, but I felt it needed some SALT! Flaky sea salt to be exact.The Scallops & Oxtail that came with a fried, sunny-side quail egg on top and pureed celery root on the bottom had great combination flavors but I believe it still lacked a bit of SALT.The Fluke & Uni Sashimi with cured cucumber and orange tea vinaigrette was refreshing. It had crunch thanks to the burnt rice crisps that laid on top. This dish would have been almost perfect if it wasn't for the excessive sesame oil that masked the fish's freshness.The Camembert Ravioli with lobster sausage and almond milk, on the other hand, was a crowd pleaser. The creamy cheese oozed out of the pasta shell while the bed of poached lobster goodness finished this dish with that gentle meat texture we all come to love.Our ""mains"" was the Oxtail & Hanger Steak that came with smoked barley, creamy spinach, and cipollini onion. We also ordered a side of Smoked Beef Fat & Jalapeno French Fries. The oxtail was meaty, tender, and full of that gelatinous beef flavor. The hanger steak was cooked to a med-rare and was superb. The seasoning on these meats were spot on and did not need SALT! Even though, the creamed spinach was just like any other creamed spinach and the fact that I couldn't taste the smoke on the barley, this dish really had me at first bite. By watching the video, you can see that this dish was well sauced, although, it wasn't as heavy as it looked. I could eat this oxtail and hanger steak combo all throughout any winter season and not get tired! The side of fries we ordered was sub-par. It was thick-cut and plainly presented in a white bowl which what looked like regular pickled jalapeno peppers you find at Subway tossed on top.For dessert we had to order David Burke's famous Cheesecake Lollipops...and we did! The lollipops ranged from dark chocolate to strawberry shortcake flavors. They served fresh raspberries and bubble-gum flavored whipped cream. All three of us believed that the lollipops could have been served without the bubble-gum whipped cream because this addition just made things a bit too sweet.The service throughout our dining experience at David Burke Kitchen exceeded our expectations. For being open only a week, the waitstaff were on their ""A"" game and it showed. Even Mr. Burke showed hospitality by stopping by our table to talk with bust jokes with us (this guy has a sense of humor). I would definitely recommend David Burke Kitchen if you are in the area.

4.0,1/27/2011,"Way to go!  The farm to table concept is alive and well here at David Burke Kitchen.  The wife scored us a table at friends and family tonight.  The space is below sidewalk level and underneath the lux uber sexy James Hotel. The big man himself was there overseeing everything.  The dining room is long and seats an abundance of people.  The walls are still bare, but that will change in the next few days/week.  The ceiling looks like plank wood flooring but keeps a warm feeling for the space.  From pretty much every table you get a view of the back where the kitchen is, which I hope they open up so you get to see all the hustle and bustle.  The staff was super friendly and very on top of the service for ""friends and family"".  The bread choices of nut and grain bread, light and dark sour dough and sesame were all winners.  The big giant table in the center of the dining room is a carving station for the bread and chipped cheese not to mention the lobster bisque.  We had the following dishes:Ants on a log: Bone marrow with snails and some buttery deliciousness along with toasts.  Make sure you get extra bread cause you are gonna want to sop everything on the plate up and maybe even gnaw on the bone.  Aww yeah, for those who like this savory type of dish, enjoy.  The fluke and uni sashimi.  Very light and refreshing, but need more kick with a little more acid or flaked salt.  The chef was kind enough to stop by the table and even serve the lobster soup.  This comes with three delicious lobster dumplings.  This is NOT a bisque, so you traditionalist who like a thick bisque of lobster, don't expect that with this soup.  Flavorful especially with the lobster dumplings, but not a bisque...just to repeat    Then for our main courses we got involved with the savory side of things:Veal skirt and sweet bread ""oscar"".  If you get this dish, make sure to enjoy it with a bite of each...the veal, sweet breads and crab to maximize flavor.  Otherwise, each independent component doesn't hold its own for some reason.  The winner of the night was by far and away the oxtail and hanger steak with cipollini onions and smoked barley.  Wow, this is hearty and delicious through and through.  Dessert was chosen by the kitchen.  We got two fruity type offerings.  The pannacotta (sp?) with a strawberry.  Then we also got a raspberry beet thing.  Obviously, I wasn't a fan of either.  Looking forward to many more returns to try many more offerings on the menu.",4,3,4,Caesar R.,"Somerville, MA",915,946,20
