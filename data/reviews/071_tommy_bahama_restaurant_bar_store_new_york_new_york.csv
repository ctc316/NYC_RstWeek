5.0,4/28/2019,Dipped in for drinks and some apps since we have frequented many times in Maui. Bartender was awesome and all the food and drinks were the same quality we have been used to when visiting in Maui. Just great!,0,0,0,Brad H.,"Washington, CT",3,43,13
4.0,4/26/2019,"So my first time here was through Yelp. It my first Yelp Elite event and I had such a great time, but I wasn't quite sure how their food really was because we got a bunch of finger foods at the event. Yesterday, I had a work lunch here and I was able to get a better idea of the place. I got a seared Ahi dish which was pretty good. The crab cakes and coconut shrimp appetizers were VERY delicious. I wish I got dessert but no one else was getting it so I felt bad.... I keep thinking about the chocolate mousse and the key lime pie I passed up on... (will have to make a trip one of these days). The service was great. The host was really accommodating and even came over to apologize for the food taking too ""long."" It was not even that long, but we appreciated it. I gotta give the service an A+. I have a feeling I will be going there real soon for a cocktail and dessert moment one day.",0,0,0,Alice R.,"Manhattan, NY",10,111,4

4.0,4/21/2019,"The Summary:Atmosphere - 3/5Neighborhood - 4/5Food - 5/5Drinks - 4/5Inclusivity - 4/5Experience - 4/5The Story:Note that this restaurant is above the store, but it shouldn't be difficult to find. It's a bar/restaurant that guarantees a fun time, but the attempted Caribbean infusion is on the cornier side (although this seems to be a fact with the brand at large).That aside, I had a great time here because of the food. I enjoyed the Coconut Crusted Crab Cakes and the Ahi Tuna Tacos (I highly recommend the latter!!). My drinks were great as well, but the tastiness of the food was the most memorable part of my being here.

5.0,4/19/2019,"For what it is, this place is an absolute home run. One of my favorite salads of my life---tied with the Lobster Cobb at the Marina Del Rey Ritz Carlton. Crab meat/avocado salad with capers. It comes shaped like tuna tartare. And it's enormous. 24 bucks but a large portion and I brought some home. Best guacamole I've had in Manhattan (sorry, Rosa Mexicano, I love you but this was even better). The decor is elegant but island-casual. The noise level low, even when every table it occupied on a beautiful Friday at lunch. I'd never heard of this place. I don't like this part of town (the 40s on 5th just weird, congested, and hard to walk because people lollygagg and there's so much scaffolding). But I cannot wait to go back for that salad. I'm still thinking about it.",2,0,3,Victoria O.,"New York, NY",806,863,381
2.0,4/14/2019,"If you like flavorless and run-of-the-mill eats, look no further than Tommy Bahama Restaurant on 5th Ave in the heart of Manhattan. FYI: Restaurant is located above the Tommy Bahama Store. Walked through the store and hustled up a flight of stairs to get there.Was warmly greeted and promptly seated by a hostess. Atmosphere reminded me of an exclusive resort somewhere in the Caribbean...candles everywhere, lots of tropical plants, comfy canvas furniture, and a roomy bar with a flat screen. The live entertainment was the highlight...didn't get any ""American Idol"" vibes from the guy singing and strumming the guitar, but his performance was pretty decent.Food was overpriced and not very good. The highly touted Blackened Fish Tacos were bland. They came with a few overcooked plantains and a small container of sugary tasting dipping sauce. Bungalow Salad was fresh, but the excessive amount of feta cheese made the salad too salty. Lump Crab Bisque was tasty. Server was standoffish and a little inattentive. However, the food arrived rather quickly. Manager stopped by the table and asked how the food was...told her the tacos were bland. She offered to bring out some ""seasonings"" for the tacos. I declined. After being offered seasonings and nothing else, I decided to leave. Didn't even bother ordering dessert. Paid for the dinner and left. Overall, just a ""meh"" dining experience.Side note: Ladies bathroom was a bit messy...two of the bathroom stalls was littered with toilet paper.",8,4,6,Maria M.,"Washington, DC",22,82,404

5.0,4/1/2019,"This restaurant is pleasantly surprising because it's above a clothing store and you don't expect much from it, but the food, drinks and service are exceptional. I would definitely recommend anything with the ahi tuna, the fish tacos and the steak as my top 3 favorites. Do NOT skip dessert, especially the key lime pie. The bar nuts are addicting and are sold in store. Live music here Tuesday-Saturday. Take out of town family here or happy hour with colleagues when you want to feel like you're on vacation.

4.0,2/22/2019,"Tommy Bahama serves good food, has creative drinks, is appropriate for work lunches, and oddly also sells expensive Hawaiian shirts and flip flops. The restaurant is upstairs and is tastefully decorated, on top of the fact that I architecturally have a crush on the French building. Service here is SLOW but if you're willing to be leisurely, the quality of food is definitely worth it. I've thrown two women's lunches here for the office and it's worked out well. Portions tend to be larger than necessary. Appetizers are solid and in general, are more fun than the entrees.

4.0,2/15/2019,"Was there for Valentine's Day, cute little spot!  Waitress was sweet, pleasant and very patient!  Was a bit concerned about bussing service, table next to us was empty and dirty for about ten minutes, no joke!  I had the burger, which was delicious!  It had a bit of sweetness to it, which I wasn't too excited about, but hey, to each his own!  However, I did take it home and warmed it up, somehow that sweetness went away and the burger was a bit more enjoyable!  My girlfriend had the scallops over season risotto, lucky for us, it was mushroom and truffle, yumm!  Granted it was delicious, presentation was not picturesque.  I was expecting white risotto with sliced mushrooms and grated truffle, instead, seemed like the mushroom and truffle was pureed and mixed into the risotto, which made the risotto all brown and looked like... you know!  Overall, great time, maybe some tweaking required.  Enjoy!  =)",0,0,0,Kamal S.,"Flushing, NY",122,12,6
3.0,2/15/2019,"Who would have thought that Tommy Bahama, an upscale beachwear brand, would have a restaurant and bar atop its retail store on 5th Avenue.  Go up a spiral staircase and it appears, in the decor of the store you feel like you could shop and eat- in fact you can-- I met my girlfriends for dinner during a weekday and it was a perfect place to unwind- midtown close to everyone's work- easy to get reach by public transportation.  While the food was excellent-tacos, salads, fish, dessert- The service was spotty but pleasant.  Great place to people watch- beautiful young people trying to impress each other- think of the millennial instagram types who got duped into going to the Fyre Festival.   They had live music- a very talented man playing calypso music-he was largely ignored.   I think I'm the only person who acknowledged him and thanked him- he gave me a great smile on the way out.",1,0,1,Susan L.,"Dix Hills, NY",168,450,576
4.0,2/9/2019,"What a pleasant surprise.You'd think a restaurant by a clothing brand would be sub-par but I was definitely impressed by the atmosphere, food and service. The inner decor is similar to the clothing store but with a NYC twist. It has modern furnishings and a splash of tropical vibes. What I tasted:Pineapple Yuzu Mojito: WOW. It's rare I come across an American restaurant that can blend yuzu with other ingredients to truly bring out the flavors without musking the citrus-y fruit. If you served me this at Raines Law Room, I would have thought it was their drink. Yes, that good. First sip is a true splash of pineapple juice but as the mojito hits the back of your tongue, layers unfold of yuzu, citrus and mint. (Yes, I know it's just yuzu flavoring but c'mon this is solid.)Char-Grilled Filet Mignon Salad: 1) YAS. They nailed it with the medium rare. It's difficult to find a restaurant that can nail a true medium rare but Tommy Bahamas did just that! 2) The combination of various leaves from Arugula to Romaine had me a bit disheveled. Did this restaurant really create a salad with crunchy, flavorful leaves that didn't taste like mush? NAILED IT. 3) The dressing was a bit heavier than a vinaigrette I would have imagined but still, seasoned well.4) How can you go wrong with grilled potatoes? Pineapple Creme Brulee - A VERY sweet blend of vanilla bean and pineapple. This dessert isn't for those who are trying to watch their glucose intake. Still a perfectly fired up sugar glaze and a sweet cream made this Creme Brulee the perfect way to end dinnerSide Note: The person I was with had their burger cooked ""well-done"" and you bet I looked at him as he ordered it well done, like he had six heads. Long story short, it was cooked well done. And yes, he was low key ready to ask for ketchup. Thank God, I was there to save the day. What a solid meal. If you're in the area and have no where to go, this is a solid restaurant.",1,1,1,Emily J.,"New York, NY",443,412,835

5.0,1/18/2019,"We went to NYC for the first time during the holidays.  It was our first night in the city and since Manhattan is known to have some of the best food in the world and tons of options, we had not planned on going to any chain restaurants.  After spending some time exploring we were cold and getting hangry and saw that Tommy Bahama was right there and it had good reviews so decided to give it a try.So glad we did.  It was a delicious way to kick off our vacation. It was a Saturday night and we were seated right away.  The live musician was great and sang a nice variety of Christmas songs as well as mainstream hits.Starting off with the coconut shrimp appetizer and a tasty cocktail, we then ordered the seasonal vegetables with some chicken, and the scallops with risotto.  Finished it all off with a memorable pineapple creme brûlée.  About halfway through the dessert, my spoon brought up a long brown thing.  My fiancé freaked out, thinking it was a rat tail.  Turned out it was a vanilla bean.  The waiter and manager quickly apologized and brought us a new one.We were 100% pleased with everything we ordered and overheard the family at the table next to us raving about their food as well.  I would definitely go back and will try some of their other locations too!",0,0,0,Troy V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,26,2

4.0,12/27/2018,"Talk about a surprise! I don't associate Tommy Bahama with fine dining but this restaurant felt like a find. Access to the dining room is somewhat hidden and you will walk up a small staircase in the back of the store to access the dining room. Once atop the stairs you will enter a large and welcoming room that can accommodate many diners and large parties but we did not feel rushed or cramped as the tables are well-spaced - a rarity in the NYC dining scene.

5.0,12/9/2018,"I stopped by the Marlin Bar for breakfast. It was amazing! I really like their coffee because it is full bodied and not bitter. I had the chorizo bowl which was scrambled eggs, black beans, chorizo, avocado, and some additional goodness. The flavors were delicious! My only suggestion would have been to use ground chorizo so when you mix it up you get chorizo in every bite. All in all, I'd definitely get it again!I also got the Island French Toast.... that is the REAL winner for me. It was light and fluffy, slightly crispy and pretty much heaven in my mouth!  The brûlée'd banana was a killer topping!! The coconut maple syrup was not overly coconut - it added the right amount of tropical taste. You've got to stop by and try their breakfast menu out.

5.0,11/29/2018,"Ate here last night with a friend for my birthday. Tommy Bahama is my go-to restaurant! I dine here every year for my birthday and my retirement party was held here in 2015.Unfortunately, our dining experience last night wasn't the usual five star! The service was perfect though.My friend ordered a martini and I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio, no issues. We also ordered crab cakes for two; they came out within five minutes of ordering. The plate held two small crab cakes, kind of gray looking like they were heated in a microwave, Thai chili sauce and slaw. They didn't have that nice caramelized look when cooked in a pan. They tasted ok though.Our entrees were Fish Tacos ( I was told they were good) which came with a few deep fried plantains and a dipping sauce.The pulled pork sandwich with slaw and fries was good as always.The only issue was the fruit flies buzzing our table. One landed in my wine so I asked for another glass of wine, when it happened again I just gave up on the wine.I should have mentioned it to the manager when he came to our table.The Key Lime pie was delicious!I will give Tommy Bahama's another chance!Update to my previous review:Wish I could give 10 stars!Planned a birthday dinner last night for two friends; we were a party of four.Two of us arrived an hour early but we were warmly greeted and seated at our table to await our friends.We ordered Bahama Mamas which were delicious and perfect for a beautiful summer night.Once our friends arrived we ordered more cocktails and shared an order of Guacamole with chips and Filet Mignon Flat Bread. The Guacamole was creamy and a bit chunky, perfect combo!The Filet Mignon Flatbread was absolutely delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. Our entrees were Blackened Fish Tacos, Caesar Salad with Chicken and an order of fries.The fish tacos were served with tomato relish and slaw accompanied by fried plantains in a creamy toasted coconut sauce.I was told the fries were cooked perfectly and the Caesar salad was really tasty,Even though we were full from all the delicious food, we ordered the delicious Malted Chocolate Pie to share. It came with two candles so we could sing happy birthday to our friends.I would like to thank Travis, the our server and the staff at Tommy Bahama for making this such a fun night for four friends who haven't seen each other in awhile.The singing guitarist is the perfect accompaniment to a fun night!We will be back for our next birthday celebration !!Five stars Tommy Bahama!Another fun birthday celebration with my girls!Service was spectacular, Lauren did a fabulous job!Food, yummy as always!

4.0,11/7/2018,"I will start by saying that I did thoroughly enjoy my experience here. I see that a lot of reviews complain about cost, but when you factor in the freshness of ingredients, the decor and ambiance, live music, this is a dinner so worth having. The idea of visiting this spot came from my wife wanting to go on vacation before vacation, and you will not find this anywhere else.We started with the seafood tacos and coconut shrimp appetizers. Very much like poke which is available everywhere now. Though it was good it did not meet the very same burst of flavor poke has, but still very good. I would recommend this to anyone who loves sushi and wishes for a new take on it. The shrimp, I am told, is one of the items Tommy Bahama is known for and I can see why. This is top to bottom fresh coconut flavor, and very nicely sized shrimp. Unfortunately, I do not like coconut, but it is so coconut-y, it is perfect for anyone who does. My wife was more than happy to enjoy these alone.Entrees, the scallop and rissotto is not something I typically look for, but it was outstanding. My entire life I have disliked scallops until I tried diver scallops in Jamaica, from then it was optional. This was the 1st time since I have been back that I had had scallops that were as good.Now the Kona steak. First I want to tell you that the flavor is amazing. The coffee flavor comes right through with a salty peppery flavor. My ONLY issue this whole dinner, was that my steak was cooked at the wrong temperature, and overall improperly. I requested Medium, I got medium rare, and that's fine, it was still good, cut through the middle and it was fine. However, one side was perfectly cooked, and somehow the other side was more on the rare side, honestly like it kissed the pan and was served. This end wasn't edible. I had eaten most of it and it was fine, but in the future, please be mindful.My wife & I thoroughly enjoyed our time, thank you.",0,0,0,Devon O.,"Brooklyn, NY",117,216,516

There was everyone from casual shoppers to people in suits on business lunches. The food unfortunately was not as solid as the interior design. I ordered the ahi tuna bowl salad and the tuna was served cold even though it was cooked. Pretty weird. I didn't get it. The salad with quinoa was ok but the star of the show (tuna) missed the mark.

We got water with no ice hmmm nothing like Luke warm water with your meal. The portion of coconut shrimp was less than normal and it tasted old. Tacos had cold tortillas. My husband said they can't go wrong with the key lime pie. So I ordered it oh boy it wasn't even eatable. I'm not one to complain but it was not a good experience.

As you may know from my last review, I didn't have the best outcome from my first visit here but it wasn't due to a lack of great customer service or deliciousness of the food. Clearly it was a fluke isolated incident and they definitely made sure to rectify it for me which was much appreciated.My boyfriends birthday was around the corner so I decided to bring him by to celebrate with some food and drinks and once again I was very pleased.I got the same drink I ordered last time, the cucumber gin infusion and it was just as tasty and JUST as strong. lolEverything we ordered was amazing and I'm so glad I decided to give them another try.

4.0,4/11/2018,"Came here for a special dinner and was impressed by the service and food.  I never previously knew that TB had a restaurant and I actually thought it would be cheezy.  It wasn't.The atmosphere is very light, with lots of windows and light colors. Service is very professional.  There was a solo guitarist doing cover songs for the majority of the time we were there.  It was nice (though could have been turned down a notch or two).Guacamole appetizer was very good, could have used a few more chips.  Crab cake appetizer was excellent.  The slaw that went with the crab cakes was tasteless.Pork rib entree was excellent.  Plenty for two to share.  Mashed potato-cauliflower was delicious, you wouldn't even know there was cauliflower in there.  The slaw that went with it was very good.  (Odd that they have 2 different slaws.)For dessert we had the creme brulee.  It was good.  It's served in a pineapple ring which is fun although it unfortunately doesn't have any pineapple flavor in it.  The one thing that I thought was missing was one or two shellfish entrees.  THere were lots of fish choices, but aside from the option of adding shrimp to a veggie dish, there wasn't anything else.  As a shellfish lover but not fish lover, this would have been nice.Prices were a bit steep, but for a special occasion I do recommend it.  We stayed for several hours and were never rushed out.  We didn't have a reservation but they do take them so it wouldn't hurt.",2,0,2,Rusty R.,"Baltimore, MD",353,326,11
2.0,4/8/2018,"So, here's the thing. I went here because the people I was traveling with LOVE these restaurants. They go to them whenever they see them.  To be fair, the food was delicious- I had some poke that really hit the spot & was refreshing & the risotto was also delicious.  Everyone seemed pleased with the food, BUT......the service was horrific.  First, I ordered a cocktail.  They said they didn't have the ingredients for it (a pomegranate martini- not that exotic, particularly for a place with a beachy theme, but it wasn't on the menu so I wasn't put off).  So I tried to order a Dark & Stormy from their drink menu... they didn't have any ginger beer.  I tried to order a third drink also listed on their menu & they didn't have ingredients for that either (on a Saturday night!).  What restaurant can't even make their own signature drinks on a Saturday night?  Seriously, give the bar back $100 & tell him to run down the street to pick up some essentials- that's how my former bar did it.  Holy cow!  So, I did not get a drink.  I thought the waiter might come back & suggest something that they had in stock & could make that was similar to any of the three drinks I suggested, but no. He just kept trying to get me to order something else off the drink menu (no doubt they wouldn't have it either, so I passed. 3 strikes & you're out!).  Worse than the lack of supplies at the bar though (which admittedly did not help my mood) the waiter was just awful.  When he was at the table he was very charming but he would disappear.  We all finished eating & sat there for at least 15 minutes before he came back to ask about dessert (& then it took him another 5 minutes to return with the dessert tray to show us). Some of our party ordered dessert, it arrived, was eaten & then we waited another 15 minutes for him to walk past so we could ask for the check.  Then we had to waive him down again about 5 minutes later to actually run the check & bring us change.  I'm glad my friends love this place so much, but I won't be in a hurry to go to one of these restaurants every again.",0,0,0,L T.,"Pawcatuck, CT",0,216,1

It's a very casual, beachy atmosphere but located right on 5th Ave near shopping adventure and Midtown companies. I was impressed by the portion of the ribs (two solid rows of ribs).

1.0,3/15/2018,"3.15.18To Whom It May Concern,I ate at the Tommy Bahama stores restaurant for the first and last time. I did not care for the atmosphere and more importantly, the food. I thought the food selection within the menu was meek and the pricing of the dishes offered was exorbitant given the size of the portions. The restaurant must be into portion control.I ordered a simple chicken and avocado salad and the amount of lettuce within was minimal. There was minimal chicken pieces within the salad and dark chicken pieces as well. No everyone care for dark pieces of chicken placed in their salad. Placing pieces of dark chicken in a salad probably costs the establishment less money to produce. Also, the wait staff should be trained not to clear away individuals dishes from a table where there are still individuals eating their meal. I realize that this is a New York thing and New York establishments take pride in rushing their patrons through their meal. However, if one has ever taken the time to fully read a Dale Carnegie good, it is not proper etiquette to clear patrons entree dishes while they are dining at an establishment while there are individuals at the table STILL EATING. The food overall was below mediocre at best.Signed,Anonymous",0,0,0,Jessica W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0

Not many places go out of their way to list categories of edited dishes to meet specific diet needs. I happened to be starting Whole30 when I went with the parents to celebrate the dad's birthday and I in no way felt deprived. We had received gift cards and vouchers from a TB clothing store and we ate like kings. My all time favorite item, that's even (mostly) Whole30 compliant was the steak salad. It is honestly one of the best things I have ever eaten; I was close to placing another order to take home. My only qualm with their menu is with the dessert selection -- they bring samples out on a tray and not one looks appetizing.

I found the menu for lunch a little pricy and felt bad because my mom was paying so looked for an inexpensive choice which was hard to find unless I got an appetizer. The fish tacos were decent- nothing to rave about. My bro got a full portion of coconut shrimp which he said was delicious and looked really good The place was filled with what looked to be business people from the area. Just too expensive to order desert and coffee. Don't think I'd return due to the prices,2,0,0,Dona F.,"Staten Island, NY",29,239,730

Definitely somewhere you can go when in the neighborhood for a relaxed meal. I had the shrimp pasta and i liked the pasta sauce. The pasta itself was average. My favorite was the pineapple creme brulee. Coming from someone who doesn't like pineapple, they have outdone themsevles!

5.0,7/21/2017,"Came here for my brother's birthday dinner on a Friday night. We got seated right away even though not everyone in our party was on time, which was nice. We started off with drinks: pineapple yuzu mojitos and pineapple martini - the mojito was on point, and the pineapple martini was a bit on a sweet side, it literally tasted like candy. For appetizer we got the spiked guac, which was good, I just wasn't a big fan of the yucca chips, but that's a personal preference I guess. For my main course I ordered the special of hanger steak with potatoes and peach glaze. It was cooked perfectly and the flavors really worked together for me, I shamelessly finished everything on my plate. Everyone else was happy with their dishes as well - the macadamia nut encrusted snapper, scallops, ribs, and the tenderloin. For dessert we had the malted chocolate cake and a pineapple crème brulee - both were delicious. The chocolate cake melted in my mouth, and was just a perfect mix of sweet and bitter chocolate. Pineapple crème brulee was served in a pineapple, and the acidity of the pineapple went really well with the sweetness of the crème brulee. The ambiance of the place was what made me like this place, the entire time we were there never felt rushed by the server. The atmosphere is very relaxed and with the live music they had going on that night it literally made me want to close my eyes and imagine that I was somewhere in the Caribbean....",1,0,1,Maria M.,"New York, NY",5,26,3

4.0,7/1/2017,"A restaurant of this caliber is not what I had originally envisioned when someone first told me that Tommy Bahama was more of a reference to bar and restaurant, as opposed to the clothing line that I associated the name and brand with. It can be hard to see nowadays, given there is scaffolding right over the entrance, but when you step inside, the space itself is a very casual (for NYC), laid-back two-story spot that has a more formal bar on the bottom, with a more casual bar and more sit-down dining room upstairs. It is always busy after work during the weekday, but managing to get yourself a glass of wine, beer, or a cocktail - whatever strikes your fancy - usually isn't too difficult. I would recommend a reservation for food ahead of time, especially if you have a large party. One time when I was here with a big party (but not large enough for private dining), they gave us the space for private dining anyways. It is a bit removed, so you have much less noise overall, but you do miss a little of the energy and the live music. Service here has always been excellent, whether at the bar or sitting down.The cocktails here are quite solid, with the menu offering a broad selection - from citrus-infused tropical drinks to a special section with barrel-aged liquors (perhaps not the best example, as they were out of those), you can find a broad selection that will fit your palate. The wine and beer selection is solid as well. And the food? Unsurprisingly, it is Hawaiian-themed, but even though I came in with the preconceived notion that it would be very generic, the food I have had here is quite good. The ahi tuna tacos are a great way to start off a meal or have as bites at the bar, with a light, crispy wonton shell and a spiced avocado cream that works well with poke-style chunks of tuna. The flatbread is well-executed, particularly the juiciness of the strips of filet mignon that top it. I was a bit skeptical of the concept of scallops served as sliders, but it worked quite well - the scallops are on the larger side, and being cooked through a little more than you would eat them on their own works when it's the 'patty' in a slider. The guacamole is quite good - you'd be hard-pressed to outdo it. For main courses, the only one I have tried so far is the macadamia nut-encrusted snapper. I won't say they do it as well as Mama's House in Maui - they don't - but the chefs here do an admirable job of replicating it. The snapper portion is quite generous (you will be filled), but the filet is flaky, and I do like the hints of wasabi and the crisp sharpness of Hawaiian sea salt in the preparation.You probably don't usually think that food spots in a clothing store (or in this case, affiliated with a clothing store) would be any good - but Tommy Bahama is (happily) an exception to this rule. There's nothing like taking down some food inspired by paradise in the middle of the concrete jungle...worth a stop for the workers in Midtown or for the tourists doing their shopping on 5th Avenue.",1,0,1,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",371,1653,169

We had the chicken tortilla soup - my soup had NO chicken [item was removed from the tab]; spiked guac, which was actually really good but not unique; the Ribeye, which would have been decent had it not been overcooked by almost 2 temperatures & the scallops which were good, but extremely rich and lacked diversity in color (no veggies, just risotto & scallop). Overall, for a $200 dollar meal, there are about 10 other restaurants in the area that are far better and more unique (and A LOT cheaper!).

Butternut Squash Soup was a little overwhelming, they added other strong ingredients that made it hard to taste the butternut squash. Still satisfying though. As for the Lemon Parmesan Orecchiette, I was really surprised at the huge portion! It was good, but I wouldn't have mind a smaller portion if they added some chicken. The Lobster Roll had a lot of meat in each bite.

3.0,12/26/2016,"So I had been to Tommy Bahamas restaurant in Hawaii and had a pretty great meal and therefore thought I would try the NYC outpost. I was with the family in midtown and needed a place to eat that would give my wife and I something of interest and yet give the kids something to fit their relatively limited palette. Tommy Bahamas seemed to fit the bill. After winding our way through the store from the 5th Ave entrance we eventually found the back staircase up to the restaurant. The interior of the place is nice but not as nice as the online photos would suggest. Our party of four was seated in a comfortable booth. Waiter was pleasant and attentive but somewhat absent during much of the meal. I ordered the ribs which came to the table stone cold and tough. Sent them back with the second serving nicely warm and much more tender although not anything to rave about at their best. Sides were passable. My wife's salad was fine. My daughter's mac and cheese was also cold and somewhat separated. So sent that back for an improved but not terrific second iteration. My son's hamburger was quite nice and if I return is probably what I would order next time. The key lime pie must have been quite good as my son refused to share even a bite. The signature creme brûlée in a pineapple was fine but far from excellent. Very thin burnt sugar coating and custard which was a bit thin. Lots of room for improvement on that one. Of note, after having to send back two of the four main courses, the manger came by and comped the crew brûlée which was appreciated and helped to smooth over a somewhat rocky experience. Overall do not think we will return here.

Had a nice glass of Sancerre at the bar while waiting and then was seated for what we hoped would be a great pre-holiday meal. My friends are regulars and had a password for a free appetizer, which our waitress acknowledged.  We ordered regular appetizers and our meal at the same time along with drinks for my friends.  The free app never showed up. The appetizers (crab cake, tuna tacos and some soup) were all good.  However, we each made the mistake of getting a salmon that was special for the evening for $30.  When it finally showed up, it was a small piece of very overcooked flavorless salmon sitting on top of a few green beans. The shoestring fries that  were listed were not included.  We laughed that they would serve something that looked like that was so tiny, but assumed it was just an error. When questioned, a bus boy said they had run out of the fries and it was just a garnish anyway. After complaining, they agreed to bring some yucca fries.  That took about 20 minutes. Our waitress was nice enough to check twice and told us they should be out soon. When they did arrive, they were pretty decent.  However, our food was long gone having taken about four bites to finish.  The drinks were decent as always. The atmosphere is generally good here. But given that someone okayed creating an entree like the one we were served it will be sometime before I go back. They may be under new management as there was no sign of the gentleman who has managed the venue for a couple of years.  The third star here is because the venue is nice and we had a good waitress who's not responsible for what she's given to serve.",0,0,0,Patrick O.,"New York, NY",1,5,0

Unfortunately, the menu we receved was different from the one on Open Table and different from the one on their own website, which is not a good sign. We were given tap water (unlike the last experience we had where complementary bottled water was offered and unlimited refills were avaiable for $1.00. We ordered our appetizers and entrees. Our appetizers arrived, a fish tarter with guacomole and chips and a Caesar Salad. The Fish Tarter was very good and the Caesar Salad was good as well but a bit of spiciness to it. But... our entrees arrived literally a minute later and we told the server we weren't ready for them. After we finished our appetizers, our entrees arrived. I had ordered the vegeterian pasta and instead received the shrimp pasta. I told person who brought the dish and he took it back to the kitchen. My dining partner's Macademia Crusted fish arrived cold, obviously having been set aside from when they attempted to serve it too soon when we were eating our appetizers. My correct pasta arrived and I honestly have no idea how they could have one pappardella noodle that was freezing cold at one end and hot at the other. We were offered dessert and coffee. My decaf was cold. They didn't offer refills on the coffee (the check arrived shortly after dessert and coffee was served). The check had the incorrect pasta on it. Apparently, the server changed the pasta with the kitchen but never bothered to correct the check. The only thing really nice about this restaurant was the live entertainment, a guitarist who sang. I wont be returning.",0,0,0,Bob G.,"JAMAICA, NY",17,213,400
4.0,11/14/2016,"Tommy Bahama serves such delicious food! I've been here for both lunch and dinner occasions. I always made reservations online so never had to wait upon arrival.For entrees, I'd highly recommend the lobster roll. There's a decent amount of lobster on a perfectly toasted bun and comes with fries on the side. There are many good appetizers as well. My personal favorites are the coconut shrimp, ahi tuna tacos, short rib sliders and duo of dips.When you're ready for dessert, they will bring a tray of sample desserts to explain the ingredients of each one and you can see how they look! I love their malted chocolate pie (must have for chocolate lovers!) and pineapple creme brulée.Service is very good and the waiters are very friendly. It can get a bit hard to get service during busy lunch hours. It's not too loud where you wouldn't be able to hear your party.

We took advantage of their great happy hour offerings and if we hadn't eaten about two hours earlier, I'm sure we would have enjoyed the food as well.

I slightly preferred the tuna salad because the dressing was a bit spiced and I love that sort of thing. All the greens, fruits and veggies in our salads were. Dry fresh and flavorful. My son ordered the pulled pork sandwich. It was huge!!! He loved it. This place is a little on the pricy side, but the service, flavor and food portions don't make you regret shelling out the cash.

We ordered the world famous shrimp which was great. I ordered the cuban sandwich which was delicious but I do prefer Cafe Habana's more. My friend ordered the lobster roll which I think was just OK.

4.0,9/28/2016,"This is a restaurant in the upstairs area of a clothing store, but it works well in it's own right. It has a beachy circa 1950s Americana surf vibe going on, with a liberal dose of refined taste. It works! I really liked the pervasive theme.There was a live guitarist beach-ifying classics and modern songs into strumming relaxing diddys, and he was KILLING IT. Many props to him (it was on Friday 9/16/16, btw). The music really set off the atmosphere.I made an online appointment through OpenTable and it worked like a charm. The waitress seemed a little overwhelmed, and they weren't very busy, but she was otherwise very polite. They seemed to focus on specialty drinks, like the intriguing Kentucky Sangria, and only had 4 beers on tap (though everything was tropical/beach themed, which I really appreciate). The porter I ordered couldn't be served because the keg had kicked and they had no more (?), which is kind of odd that it was the last keg considering it was only Friday. But it's only a small disappointment.The prices and selections were much different than what I had read online, so I presume it was a lunch vs dinner menu. So I've included a pic of the dinner menu. The increased prices and decreased selection weren't a deal breaker, but all things being equal I'd rather pay less than more and have more options. The food was creative and delicious, but the portions were very spare. For example they had single/double portions for the apps, we ordered coconut shrimp and crab cakes, double of each. The crab cakes were ~1.5"" in diameter and ~1"" high, about the size of a flattened ping-pong ball. Yes, they were tasty, not mind blowing or anything, and vaguely artfully presented, but not quite worth the $16.50 price. Ditto with the shrimp, 6 medium size shrimp of good but not amazing taste, quasi-well plated for $18. More or less the same story for dinner, very creative and thematic dishes of decent taste and visual appeal for ~$31. The waitress had to be flagged down more than once, but she seemed a little stressed out. Lastly dessert was excellent: delicious, thematic, generous, beautiful and reasonably priced.All in all I was very happy with my experience, I'd certainly recommend it, and I plan on returning.

Their side pairings and accompaniments are almost always excellent and they always have a variety of great food for all courses and a variety of protein and veggie options (which is hard to find in any NYC restaurant). The only downside to this restaurant is that while they have good desserts, they are not the best and the dessert portion is large! The desserts are the kind you would find at a cheap tiki restaurant.

Loved the ahi tuna tacos as it provided just the right amount of crunch and fresh lightly seasoned chopped tuna. We also ordered the seared scallop sliders that were mediocre. My boyfriend who had the house roasted pork sandwich thought the sauce was not very fitting and the texture of pulled pork in sandwich wasn't really a good match. However the ahi tuna burger is a must have! It was cooked to perfection and had just the right amount of seasoning. The buns were lightly crisp and fresh. Service was fast and attentive.

When I made the reservation, I wrote that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and a birthday. The restaurant made absolutely no mention of it, not even a happy birthday written on the dessert we bought. So clearly Tommy's isn't the place to go if you want to celebrate something.

2.0,8/29/2016,"Had lunch at Tommy Bahama yesterday with my daughter and while it used to be one of our go-to places it's really gone downhill.1. Service is non-existent. This is the case even if it's not busy, which it wasn't yesterday at 2pm. Be prepared to wait to be seated because nobody is ever at the hostess stand. Be prepared to flag down someone to take your order because nobody ever comes by. Be prepared to flag down someone to get your bill because nobody really cares.2. Food is average at best. The crab cakes that I used to LOVE are now small little mushy hockey pucks. And all the food came to us cold. The broccolini was mushy and overcooked. 3. Portion size has shrunk substantially but prices have not shrunk.4. I was overcharged and nobody really apologized when I pointed it out.Overall there are far too many better places in NYC to eat to return to Tommy Bahama.

3.0,8/23/2016,"More like 3.5 stars, even thought we are allowed to give a half star... Another great spot we got to visit during the Restaurant Week Summer 2016. Since we don't shop at Tommy Bahamas (or I should say that we haven't shopped there, yet), I didn't even know this restaurant existed... Which is one of the greatest thing about this Restaurant Week events. We get to discover new restaurant that we didn't even know until these type of opportunity came along.If you want to do some shopping at the same time, or if you arrived a bit too early for your reservation, you can always browse through the store before going up the stairs to the restaurant. They had colorful, chilled out, comfortable styled clothing and mostly beach/nautical theme. They also had pretty accessories such as necklace and purses. And, most of all, they had THE most chilled out and relaxed mannequins I have ever seen...We had a nice lunch here, but didn't really get that whole ""seafood experience"" we thought we were going to have. The portion was reasonable, the burger was huge, but lacked some flavor that would have made them memorable. The shrimp appetizer had the most flavor from the sweet chili sauce. The atmosphere was really nice, we didn't know there was such large, relaxing space in the middle of busy 5th avenue. Our waiter (who was also a bartender) was very polite and helpful. He made sure to check on us often, it was good to know he was always around when (and if) we needed him. There was also a manager on the floor, who also kept walking around the restaurant and make sure each and every customers were well taken care of. Our dishes were picked up as soon as we finished, water was always filled, very good service! This is a nice spot to take a break from the crowds or shopping/walking around.

We arrived at exactly 1:30, the time of our reservation, and was still asked to have a seat in the waiting space. For about 10 minutes, no one paid any mind to us. I asked the guy at the front if we would review the lunch menu so we could order right away when we were to be seated. It was until that moment when we were holding the menus, that one of the hosts asked if we had reservations and apologized for the inconvenience and got us a table right away.Service was quick. I ordered the following:Crispy Rock Shrimp - I imagined jumbo fried shrimp, but what I got was a handful of mini deliciously fried shrimp covered with a sweet chili sauce over a bed of greens. One of the most crispy shrimps I have ever had and very fresh. A bit too saucy, but still good. Recommend this over the cold soup.Black Fish Tacos - Comes in three soft tacos with a side of maduros and a side of coconut and pineapple flavored sauce. The tacos had generous amounts of fish covered with an aioli sauce and sour cream. Ask for this on the side because I found this to be a bit much. The maduros were PERFECT and the coconut pineapple sauce was AMAZING. It is comparable to a pinacolada sauce.Key Lime Pie - Delicious. This is both sweet and tart.

We went on Saturday night and the food was good as always. We started with the coconut shrimp appetizer, and that was really tasty with a mango chutney. For the main course I ordered the diver scallops with cauliflower steak instead of risotto, and he got the softshell crab which was a special that night. Both meals were delicious. I sipped a glass of sauvignon blanc and it was splendid.The bad: The service was not great this time. When we arrived (~9pm)  we were informed that the air conditioning was not working, so they seated us right under a fan. No big deal. It was 90 degrees out that day but was cooling down already outside. However, when another group of 4 people showed up to eat, the host seated them practically on top of us - one of their chairs bumped up against our table - even though the restaurant was empty. I know we were under the fan, but there must have been more than one fan in the restaurant and it was awkward to be seated so close when the place was empty. In addition, when we were leaving I went to use the restroom and it was completely trashed. It should have been closed off in that condition, and it put a real damper on the end of the evening.

3.0,4/10/2016,"Came here on Apr/08 at night. Would have been 5 stars except for one thing... The reason why I won't give a 5 star rating is the host. When we got there and I asked for a table for two, she looked at us twice, gave us a weird smile and said ""Sure. Can't say no, right?"". I don't know where this comment came from: was she implying that she would have denied us a table if she had a chance? Based on what? It beats me. Also, I'm not sensitive towards this kind of thing... but I did notice that she sat us in the back of the restaurant, same as all the POC/minorities (like us) I could find in there. Was she doing this on purpose? My grandma used to say that this was the kind of racism she would have to put up with back in her days living in NYC. Not sure that this was the case, maybe she just hates her job, but either way her comment was completely out of line.That was enough to make us want to leave, but the waitress came and we decided to stay. And to be honest, we are glad we did, because we had an amazing time!The food was delicious: we ordered coconut shrimp, chipotle calamari, ahi tuna tacos, duo dips, and the ceviche. Everything tasted wonderful, fresh and different. Plantain chips with a touch of cinnamon? #LifeChangingMy boyfriend had a nice glass of wine, I had a Lavender drink that was a bit sweet for my taste, but it was good. We also shared a butterscotch pudding dessert that was amazing AF. The waitress was a sweetheart. The environment was great. And the prices are just right. Seems like the only problem was the host. Definitely can & will recommend this place.The highlight of the night was going to the bathroom and catching the same rude host cleaning the bathroom with a giant trash bag in one hand. Nothing wrong with this: I've also had to clean bathroom stalls in the past and did it with enthusiasm and dignity. But after the arrogance she displayed before, I have to say this was a moment that gave me a lot of satisfaction. I smiled at her and she looked away with a bit of embarrassment as she moved over to let me in. Had I said something, I would've ruin it. Hopefully that will teach her some humbleness and respect for other people.",9,1,0,Alex C.,"New York, NY",54,1,0

The ones at Red Lobster are far better.  Crab cake, very tasty, but again very small.  The drinks on the other hand were amazing and packed a punch.  I had a pineapple martini a coconut martini and a Derby,  The coconut martini was the favorite among the table.  It was recommended by our waiter Jared who was extremely helpful and provided awesome service.  I don't know that I would return.",0,0,0,LaToya Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,16,6

I ordered the ribs with yucca fries; the ribs were flavorful but the fries were best. For dessert, we had an Oreo crust chocolate cake/pie, which was pretty good.

Both spaces are nice.We went to sit upstairs, but was too loud, so they sat us downstairs which was nice of them.Servers were friendly, Juan the manager introduced himself.I enjoy ""tiki/tropical"" drinks, and this place makes excellent ones. The Mai Tai, had a nice floater of dark rum on it, and good fresh juices.  The Pina Colada, (which we also asked for with a floater) was the best Pina Colada I have ever had. I usually hate them, but my friend said I had to try it, and I am glad I did. Delicious!I thought the coconut shrimp were good, but not spectacular.  They were well cooked, not overly fried, nice shrimp.The pub cheese in the duo of dips was a standout. The chips were also better than they needed to be.The shortrib sliders were lovely, really nice construction, and all the elements came together, the squishy bun, the crispy slaw, the crunchy fried onions, the yielding beef. Excellent.The Tuna Tacos were a standout. I usually don't like poke, or raw tuna preparations like that, but they got the sauce just right on these, and the quality of the meat was clear. They cut it right too, so it wasn't overly chewy. Really spot on.I work around the corner, and will be back.",2,1,3,Ed S.,"Dallas, TX",153,207,138
3.0,2/28/2016,"Visited Tommy Bahama for dinner on a Tuesday night with a party of three; we had easily made a reservation the day before. The restaurant's interior is fun and resort-themed, with leafy potted plants, comfortable couches and light-colored wooden furniture. The service staff were attentive and friendly, taking the time to make food and drinks recommendations as it was our first time there. Despite the pleasant and relaxed ambience, the food and drinks were rather mediocre. We started off with a round of drinks and I ended up going with our server's recommendation, the Coconut Cloud Martini. Despite having a sweet tooth, I found the martini to be cloyingly sweet and slightly too heavy as a starting cocktail, likely because of the cream of coconut in it. One of my dining companions had the Cucumber Royale, a lighter and more refreshing cocktail, which I personally preferred.For appetizers, we had the World Famous Coconut Shrimp, Peruvian Ceviche and the Crispy Calamari. While none of these were severely flawed or deficient in any way, they simply weren't impressive either. The flavors of the dishes weren't particularly memorable and I don't think I would order them again if I ever returned.For our mains, we ordered the Macadamia Nut Encrusted Snapper and the Hawaiian Style Miso Marinated Black Cod. My dining companion found the snapper to be a disappointment as she had hoped for the macadamia nuts to more obviously incorporated into the dish. Instead, it appeared that the nuts had been crushed into tiny bits and she could hardly taste them. On the other hand, I found the black cod to be tasty and well cooked, and I enjoyed its pairing with more obviously Asian ingredients like bok choy and shiitake mushrooms.On the whole, the food could have been summed up with a 'meh', although the service and atmosphere were great.",0,0,0,Jessica C.,"Manhattan, NY",4,15,0

It was pouring outside and Hawaii inside just a bit strange. The menu was what you would expect. I saw the manager going around to every table and running food and clearing plates so that was impressive. What wasn't was the service. It took forever to get our food. All the tables around us were served before us and they arrived up to 20 minutes after us. Then my salad was wrong.

The chocolate cake and key lime pie are amazing. the smaller sizes are perfect, though I would totally eat the larger size too. The only drop fall to this restaurant is the liquor and beer menu, its lacks a lot of finesse. The food and wine are on point, the odd beer choices (there didnt even have a IPA) and the lack of whiskey and scotch choices really are a downer for me. The service varies depending on the server.

One downfall was the live singer. Didn't think it was needed. See why they have him bc of the beachy feel but it was just a distraction than entertainment. I would definitely come here again. I definitely recommend advertising more. The restaurant is hidden on the second floor and the entrance is through the bar that is named differently if I'm not mistaken.

There was a side of soft plantains in a sweet yogurt sauce with pineapple and toasted coconut flakes. The fish was a little fishy, but the sauces ended up covering it. The chipotle aioli added spiciness to it. The plantains and the yogurt sauce tasted like a dessert, which was really nice because I didn't ordered any dessert.There was a green lacewing on the side of the plate.

When the order arrived, we saw that the fish had no seasoning and asked the server about it. He said it was lightly blackened, but the 3 of us who ordered this dish did not see or taste a single speck of seasoning.

5.0,10/26/2015,"This is my favorite after work restaurant/bar. My office is just around the corner and there are many other choices in the neighborhood. But this is the best place anywhere near 45th St and 5th Ave. There are two bars, one on the street level and one on the second floor, up a flight of winding wood stairs. The downstairs has a lounge area in the back. The upstairs also has a restaurant section. You can eat at either bar or in the upstairs restaurant. A lot of people here like the happy hour which offers special appetizers and lower cost drinks. It ends at 7:00 PM, which is better than some other places. The noise level is not too bad, it is not quiet but it is reasonable enough to carry on a conversation without shouting. The upstairs bar has live music in the evening. The music varies from one evening to the next, usually just a guitar player/singer. The music would not be the main reason to come here, it is usually what you might hear in a small local coffee shop. It is a little bit lost in the hustle and bustle.  But any kind of live music is a plus.  Among the dishes I've enjoyed here are the Swordfish, Macadamia crusted Red Snapper, seared Tuna and the Filet Mignon steak salad. They have all been delicious and well prepared. I've had the Swordfish and the Red Snapper several times. The food here is moderately spicy and flavorful. The chef chooses spices that blend well with the main ingredient and it works beautifully, for me. I don't like bland cooking, neither do I like food the is so highly spiced that the flavor of the actual food does not come through and you are only tasting the spice.The pricing here is about average for a good restaurant in Manhattan. Not a budget place but not the most expensive place either. The cost of the entrees range from about $18 to $40. The service here is friendly and willing. When I come here after work, it is often busy and sometimes it takes a few minutes to get the attention of the bartender. However, I am always greeted with a friendly smile and made to feel welcome. I always get the feeling that the staff are genuinely concerned about the customers and want everyone to have a good experience.",3,0,0,Marc R.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",4,45,0

4.0,10/17/2015,"A very nice haven above Fifth Avenue for a casual, upscale lunch in the city.  The menu evokes island themes, from Hawaii to the Caribbean, and all of the dishes our party of five ordered looked wonderful and were given a hearty thumbs-up.I started off with a Rumhattan, which is exactly what it sounds like - a Manhattan made with rum instead of bourbon.  Surprisingly smooth, definitely a winner.As for me, I had the filet mignon salad, featuring a very nice cut of beef, some roasted potatoes, and a nicely dressed salad - it was right up there amongst the best steak salads I've had.  For dessert, I was seduced by the butterscotch pudding with a chocolate ganache, caramel, and a white chocolate mousse. It was light, it was airy, it was delicious!  In the pics I've posted, you'll also see the chocolate mousse with an Oreo crust, with five of us grabbing spoons to taste a wonderfully smooth, balanced dessert.The setting is quite comfortable, with a nice island décor, and our server Teddy was top-notch, making sure we were well taken care of during our mid-afternoon lunch.  While I generally try to avoid the hustle-bustle of Midtown, Tommy Bahama provides a nice meeting place when you're trying to find something central.I'm not quite sure I've walked-off that butterscotch dessert yet... and that's okay!",1,0,1,Andy B.,"Bethesda, MD",297,448,3081

1.0,10/12/2015,"I was going to be nice and give them two stars... but then I realized wait a minute... the food nor the desserts were good... let alone the service so never mind. Plus the dishes are way over-priced for what you really get in terms of quality.My cousin chose this place for her birthday, and when we had arrived, we were standing by the hostess desk with no sight of the hostess to seat us to our table until I said something out loud and what do you know... she popped up from the table across the host desk. So she was sitting there the whole time but some how didn't notice us standing there for a few minutes? Then the whole night I had to wave down the waitress to ask for the proper amount of plates, cups, and utensils that were not given to half of the party. Also had to ask the waitress myself for the free bread baskets that she was suppose to give us in the beginning before everyone was already half way through their appetizers. After that, our waitress kept passing the wrong dishes to the wrong people. My steak ended up at the other end of the table to my friend who had already cut into my steak and ate it.... Thank god I know the difference between my steaks unlike my friend and luckily I didn't mind and just swapped the plate instead of requesting for a new one. It must of been her first day or something for the ditzy service.COFFEE CRUSTED RIBEYE $39 - After reading numerous good reviews, this sounded the safest where they don't really fuck up on. Unfortunately, the steak was severely under seasoned... and not cooked perfectly like how other reviews stated. My friend had to send her steak back not once, but TWICE. She wanted it medium... and the first time was too well-done... the second time... it was practically RARE... third time was the charm. My steak which I asked for medium rare was cooked a little more on the rare side. So i tried eating it anyways until I gave up half way through because the quality of the steak itself was too chewy.AHI TUNA TACOS - I've had plenty of way better tuna poke tacos. The wonton taco shells from here were stale... and the amount of tuna they give you are really skimpy compared to many other restaurants I've had it in. This was my brother's appetizer that I picked off of him, and him and his girlfriend weren't happy with it.TIGER SHRIMP PASTA $29 - holy moly $29 ?! You can go to more authentic italian cuisines in the city for pasta that taste 3x better and cost no more than $24. Only really high end places would charge this much for a tiger shrimp pasta dish... except it'll taste of quality. My friend took two bites and completely stopped eating and ended up passing it around the table. I took a bite and understood how he felt. Honestly a party of 16 people, and not one single person enjoyed their entree. So if you must and you round up here, I think the only one worth your money to order would be the $16 ahi poke napoleon appetizer; dressed lightly with plenty of tuna chunks, the scallop slider; looked like it had a good amount of scallop in decent size for 3 slider patties, the caribbean rubbed mahi mahi; that my brother ordered and said tasted so much better than our steak which was true... it was cooked very well. Even the calamari's siracha aioli sauce was unappetizing, it tasted pretty much like a thick glob of mayo. As for desserts? NONE of it was good... and I ALWAYS look forward to desserts. The butterscotch pudding was overly sweet, the creme brulee was in a pineapple shell that makes for a really picture worthy presentation but it wasn't custards but more of a incomplete vanilla pudding, and the pina colada cake was everyone's least favorite. Everyone ended up forking $70-80, including myself who did not even order any alcoholic beverages. I have no clue how this place holds 4 stars.",4,2,1,Monica P.,"Brooklyn, NY",432,222,440

Then jerk spiced baby back ribs with chive mashed potato and Asian slaw and a Cobb salad with grilled chicken for entrees. My salad was supposed to come with grilled shrimp as listed in their menu but they ran out, so I was a bit disappointed. Also tried their tropical island punch which was not bad. Their entrees are generous and therefore, ended up with leftovers to take home. For dessert, they had a nice array of tropical desserts which the very friendly and knowledgeable waitress showed us.

Have also tried the chicken sandwhich, but would reccomend the fish over the sandwhich. Insider tip: The fish tacos come with plaintans in a yogurt type dip, that I am not a fan of. You can substitute this for a small salad or their tasty yucca fies. For desert, the creme brulee is light and very good. Service has been very good every time I've visited.

We had the coconut shrimp & the chips & dip duo. The coconut shrimp was great just enough coconut to taste it, but it wasn't overwhelming & the sauce was a great compliment. The chips were fresh & you could taste the freshness. The cheese dip was delicious, but I didn't really like the guacamole. For entrees we ordered the Jerk Pork Tenderloin & Filet Mignon. Everything was cooked just right & the filet Mignon was amazing. It had such great taste & the perfect texture. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.

Ultimately we settled on Ommegang Wittes, and a Jim Beam neat for myself. Beer came out cold and delicious. Started with the ceviche; really good. Nice touch with the cinnamon on the plantain chips. I ordered the BBQ ribs and my girl had the lobster hero. Entrees arrive. Ribs are spot on! I'm from Texas and these are damn good ribs. A perfect amount of crunch on the outside and the sauce was the perfect mix of sweet with tangy and spicy. Also tried my lady's hero and it was fantastic. Roll was buttery. Mmmm...Stuffed ourselves and did dessert anyway. Pineapple creme brûlée and piña colada cake. Decadent. Destroyed all. Loved the vibe and the music, very chill and very clean atmosphere.

They have a downstairs bar which is beautiful and then the spiral stairs lead you up to the restaurant with a gorgeous view of the city.

3.0,6/19/2015,"Came with two of my girlfriends on thursday around 6:15, we had a reservation but they still made us wait for about 10 mins.  The restaurant is located on the second floor and the bar on the first floor.  I was surprise that the restaurant was pretty big but was soo packed with people!The appetizers we ordered were kind of salty especially the calamari, but the entree was bland somehow and we had to ask for salt.  Food is definitely not worth the price they charge with all entree above $30 each.  Their drinks are really good though and they are generous with the alcohol!! Even though the food was so so but we all had a great time here because of their drinks.Service was very attentive, our server was very nice.  Overall 5 stars for service and drinks, 2 stars for food.",0,0,0,Kerri O.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",85,181,1003
4.0,6/15/2015,"A little Hawaiian getaway in the middle of the city is what you get coming to Tommy Bahama. It's no replacement to the real thing but a good alternative when you have a craving for a small piece of the tropical life. I came here with my fiancé on a Saturday evening for dinner and we were both pleasantly surprised by the decor, the service and the food. The main entrance leads to a bar on the first floor but the restaurant dining area is up some spiral stairs to the second floor. The large windows with wooden panels make it feel like looking out a bungalow, facing the ocean of the city.  Large leafed plants surround the tables and candle holders filled with white sand give you little aspects of the tropical island far far away. The service was great from beginning to end. Lots of attention at the start of the meal but it faltered a bit as the restaurant began to fill up with other patrons. Good thing we were wrapping up dinner when this started. The food was very good, lots of different flavors and a variety of sauces. We ordered the Yuzu Shrimp tacos and the crab cakes to start. Then we had their macadamia nut encrusted snapper and their Hawaiian style miso marinate black cod. All had very fresh flavors and each dish played with the contrast of soft and crunchy textures. The shrimp tacos were reminiscent of Cancun style tacos, but larger in proportion. A large grilled soft taco, filled with grilled crunchy shrimp and shredded cabbage and sauce that is described in the menu as Asian Slaw (think regular slaw but with Asian sauces instead). Crab cakes was complied of large lumps of crab meat and sit atop a bed of more Asian Slaw but with a Thai sauce, which is tangy and reminds me of the duck sauce one uses on fried Asian dishes. It was a well prepared crab cake that didn't lose the flavors of the crustacean as it was cooked.  The snapper was fully encrusted in nuts, though I wouldn't have known it was macadamia nuts if it wasn't written on their menu, as the flavors of the nuts were not really present.  The black cod was cooked perfectly, where the fish wasn't dry and the cooked thoroughly, but the sauce was a bit of a let down.  It wasn't bad but I felt that the special Meyer Lemon Beurre Blanc was overpowered by the presence of the soy sauce.  My fiancé liked the shiitake mushrooms served with the black cod.Overall it is a nice little getaway from your typical dinner. A sufficient stand-in to visit when you miss the tropics.",3,0,2,Louis N.,"New York, NY",375,218,459

5.0,6/7/2015,"5-stars. Hands down. Tommy Bahama offers an incredible experience and I am more impressed every time I come.I don't usually talk about service because I tend to care much more about food. But the service here is impeccable. It's more like the service at a much fancier restaurant, even though it isn't that kind of place. For instance, last time I came in with a reservation and we needed to wait 15 minutes for our table.. which is nothing for a Thursday night... but they offered a free round of drinks. Thank you very much Mr. Bahama. The service isn't just about serving though. The waiters & waitresses actually have opinions and suggestions on drinks. Which is fantasticChairs and booths are extremely comfortable. Atmosphere is relaxing. Lots of comfy pillows that you can lean on. There is a bar upstairs and another downstairs.. both have a young, attractive crowd that makes you feel happy to be there.The food is actually one notch below the overall experience. In terms of appetizers, I've had the ""duo"" guacamole-spicy cheese dip... very tasty, although portion size on the smaller end. For the meal I usually get a salad and some kind of a fish taco. The salad is fantastic. Good combination of sweet, crunchy, tangy. Fish tacos are only aight. Not exceptional. Not particularly inventive, but solid.The ""painkiller"" drink that I usually go with tastes like vacation. In fact the whole restaurant smells like vacation. How can you not give 5-stars to that?",4,0,4,Dani L.,"Boston, MA",289,164,201
3.0,5/29/2015,"Great place for happy hour! Just imagine sipping on tropical cocktails with a live band...such a relaxing island ambience. Did I mention they have good potent drinks also?! All of this situated right in the middle of midtown Manhattan. We started off with: AHI TUNA TACOS -- Poké sashimi with slaw held up by fried wonton shells and topped off with wasabi aioli. Delightful & scrumptious!AHI POKE NAPOLEAN --A guacamole and ahi poke dip accompanied with crispy flatbreads. Every scoop had chunks of fresh tuna and guacamole, a flavorsome mixture when combined. We devoured it all within seconds. CRAB BISQUE -- This crab bisque stole the show. It was brothy, creamy AND loaded with crabmeat. The bisque had a great depth of flavor. This appetizer alone would be worth 5 stars!  CRAB CAKES -- Crab cakes were never really my thing even though I love crabs. It tasted like pasteurized crab meat coated with a gigantic layer of bread crumbs. Meh. KONA COFFEE CRUSTED STEAK -- It was missing the crunchy crust factor and I wasn't able to taste the slightest hint of coffee in there. Overall, a decently flavored steak cooked to my liking. BBQ RIBS -- The ribs weren't dried out but not as tender as I would have liked.  Also, it was not smoked long enough and the sauce seemed to be missing. PINEAPPLE CRÈME BRULEE -- Had a great presentation but I was disappointed with this dessert. The crème brulee just tasted like plain egg custard that was placed in a carved pineapple. Overall, we had a pleasant dining experience here and our waiter was courteous from beginning to end. I felt the prices are a bit high for the quality of the food. The entrees ranged from $30+. I would come back only for their cocktails and appetizers next time. Take advantage of their happy hour from 4-7pm!",6,2,3,Annie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",368,131,551

Nice menu options, something for everyone! I had the special Angus beef tacos & my friend had the blackened cod. Both were good. We had the coconut shrimp as the app. Again, good but nothing to write home about. We shared the lava cake and took half of it home. It was very rich and a huge serving even for two! But delicious.

4.0,5/22/2015,"Okay, preface: here we were--out-of-towners--walking the cold streets of Manhattan, hungry as heck.  And at around 10:00PM, this Tony Bahama branch was the closest classy restaurant we could get to.  And all I can say is that they took care of us really well.  We ordered the Ahi Tuna Tacos and the Steak.  It took them a while to get that ready for us, but when they did, they had inadvertently served the Fish Tacos instead.  We didn't mind since the Fish Tacos looked REEEAALLY good too at this point, so we just dug in.  The steak was good, but I enjoyed the tacos better.  And--to top it off-- the owner came by and gave us an order of Ahi Tacos for free.  We tried to wave it off because we didn't want some poor guy from the kitchen to pick up that tab, but the owner insisted and said he didn't want us to leave the restaurant without trying what he said was one of their best sellers.  So yeah, the ahi was really great.  We ended up spending a little more than we probably should have here, but it was worth itIn all we had a good meal and a great time.  And sometimes, that's all that matters.",1,0,2,Maven P.,"San Antonio, TX",39,5,0

1.0,4/18/2015,"If zero stars was an option that would be my rating. I'm currently sitting in the restaurant waiting for them to pick up my empty plates that have been sitting here for ten minutes, but let's start from the beginning. First, we received bread that was partially frozen in the middle. Nothing like cold bread to warm up some cold butter. Then we ordered a quinoa salad with vinaigrette dressing. Unfortunately they forgot to put the dressing on the salad so we had to ask for a side of dressing. Next, my wife ordered Parmesan crusted chicken breast, but the chicken was undercooked. So she had them bring her some brown sugar crusted ahi. The tuna was high quality, but the brown sugar was not a good pairing. She asked for soy sauce and that took about 10 minutes to arrive. And to top it off they brought us the wrong check. The only saving grace for this meal were the short rib sliders and the wait staff. Everyone was very polite including the manager, but that did not stop the errors. They ended up comping my wife's meal, but I don't think I'll be back.To top it all off there were no paper towels in the bathroom. Had to go to the bar after I washed my hands.

It was us and one other table on a Sunday around 11:30 am. It's totally trying for the tommy Bahamas feel so it smells like coconut to an almost sickly degree and is going for that kind of beachy but also formal atmosphere? Like you're supposed to be in a really nice country club maybe, but you're not? We went to the top of the spiral staircase to the full restaurant. Service was very good.

The drinks were amazing. My family all drank wine which they liked and I had the coconut cloud martini which was one of the best drinks I've ever had. We started out the meal with three appetizers, all of which were awesome. We ordered the coconut shrimp, the calamari, and the dip duo. The calamari was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. The coconut shrimp was called ""world famous"" and I know why. It was crisply and covered in real coconut. The dip duo was a pub cheese and a spiked guacamole, both of which were good. I was more impressed with the calamari and shrimp, but the dips were good too. For our main meals I ordered the ribs, which fell off the bone. They were so tender and flavorful. The sauce was sweet and tangy. I got yucca fries on the side which were very good also. They were blooming with flavor. My family got the short rib sliders and a chicken dish. They both said they loved their dishes too. To top off the huge and delicious meal, we had a chocolate molten cake which was very good but a little rich for my taste.

2.0,2/22/2015,"Came here today for dinner. It was ok. I might consider returning, but not for a while at least. To start, we came in earlier than our reservation time. We asked the hostess if it were possible to be seated early since the restaurant was literally empty. She made a face like we had asked her to loan us $10,000. After a few seconds of pondering, she finally told us we could be seated. I'll go ahead and tell you that the place was never mire than half full, so this really wasn't a tough request to grant. With that said, we sit down, and our waiter comes by and gives us water. He gives us the menu and says he'll give us a few minutes to look it over. After about 15 minutes, he returns and takes our drink orders, and our food as well. 5 more minutes goes by before we have our drinks, and then he asks, ""Oh, did you want bread?"". So 5 minutes after that, he brings us bread. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and the Bungalow Salad with the dressing in the side. My fiance had the cod. After about a half an hour, reminder the restaurant is half full, our food comes out. The soup is hardly lukewarm, and the dressing is on the salad. My fiance liked her cod. The soup was pretty good but cold, the salad was a good size. Waiter asks my fiance if she would like another drink, which she declines, so he takes her glass and leaves. Problem is, her glass wasn't empty. We then ordered dessert. They forgot to bring it out. After 20 minutes of waiting, we tell them to cancel it because we had a train to catch. We get the check, and since the dessert was already prepared, they boxed it up and let us have it for free, which was fair. It's pricey, but you expect that in the city. For the price however, the service was poor. The decent salad might bring me back for lunch, but I absolutely wouldn't return for dinner.

I also ordered scallop burger sliders which was heavenly. As an entree I ordered filet mignon medium rare with mashed potatoes and arugula salad my mother ordered ribs full back and my sister ordered tiger shrimp with pasta. The filet mignon and tiger shrimp was cooked to perfection. As a dessert my mother ordered some pie and she didn't like it so much. I ordered butterscotch pudding which was amazing and my sister ordered pineapple creme brule not a fan but my mother and sister loved it. Overall the bills came up to about $278 almost $300 we also had a couple drinks as well. Highly recommend place",0,0,0,Jerome S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,4

We've also tried the Zombie, Coconut Dream Martini (this will make you float away), and the margaritas. All drinks are definitely crafted by experienced bartenders and they're not just thrown together. If it's busy downstairs we sometimes sit upstairs and order a few appetizers (I believe you can only sit at the tables upstairs if you order food).

5.0,12/27/2014,"Most people think Tommy Bahama is just a clothing store for men of a certain pedigree. They don't realize there's also a bar and restaurant that actually serves creative, delicious Hawaiian influenced dishes. I didn't when I first came here.The restaurant vibe is definitely South Pacific Trade Winds, but not in a tacky Tiki Room way. Think upscale casual, usually with live mood-evoking music.The downstairs Marlin Bar and upstairs bar serve original, albeit expensive, cocktails. I've been through more Grey Goose Grapefruit Basil Martinis than I should admit.Last weekend I reserved the private Hamptons Room for my birthday dinner party. Sixteen of us had a fantastic time. Service led by Anthony was personal and top notch. We couldn't ask for more.From the Prosecco for a toast, to the 2012 Cakebread Sonoma Chardonnay (my personal favorite of the moment) to the Napa Valley Cabernet, all wines were awesome. We ran through 14 bottles!I selected two guaranteed crowd-pleasing appetizers: Macadamia Encrusted Goat Cheese and the Ahi Tuna Tacos. The fish tacos are basically poké sashimi in wonton skins with a wasabi créme. Heavenly!The entrees included Parmesan Crusted Sanibel Chicken, Caribbean Rubbed Mahi Mahi and Kona Coffee Crusted Ribeye Steak. Everything tasted great. Most of us had the ribeye and all came cooked as requested.You probably can't go wrong with anything on the full menu; this shows the surprising strength of the chef and kitchen. The entire restaurant is surprising because expectations probably aren't too high for a retail clothing chain to operate successful restaurants. Last Saturday they succeeded on all levels: bartending, food, service and ambience.Discover Tommy Bahama!",13,7,10,Jerry C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",515,538,1321

We really didn't have to - it was pretty empty. Downstairs has a cool bar that has a different name but I think they might be owned by tommy bahama. We went up these spiral staircases to get to the restaurant, and the hostess immediately seated us by the window. We watched some steer dancers across the street - it was entertaining. The decor is tropical-like, with bright flowery print cushions and ceiling fans. The beers were ICED COLD, which was a huge plus after a hot day of walking around 5th avenue all day. They serve them in chilled glasses. I really loved this one beer we tried - I think it was called kona big wave?? It was really nice and smooth. I got the crab bisque and my fiancé got the Caesar salad as appetizers. They were both delicious. We both got some kind of chicken dish (I can't remember, we ate so much on that trip) but I do remember that they were both great and we pretty much cleaned our plates. The one complaint I have would be that they didn't serve any bread... Not that we needed it cause the entrees were huge, but it would have been nice, I always like a little carb to go with my protein. Perhaps that's how New Yorkers stay fit!

But then again, you have to be drunk if you're buying an overpriced Hawaiian shirt :PAnyway, I came here one night with coworkers for a happy hour. The bar is upstairs and is decorated really nicely. We were a bit early, there weren't any people there yet. That was good because we had like 20 people from our group. There were seats available, but we all decided to hang out near the bar. Quickest way to get drinks! I'm not sure what drink I got, we were all passing back drinks and this one ended up in my hand. I just know it was really sweet and really strong. I could taste the vodka. It's one of their martinis just not sure which one. We ordered a ton of appetizers, I'm going to go through the ones I actually remember:Coconut shrimp: O-M-G. They were fantastic. Seriously amazing. And the shrimp were huge too. One of my friends was so mesmerized by the size she went around telling everyone how huge they were. Can someone say, drunk?Calamari: Fried goodness. You seriously can't go wrong with these. The dipping sauce was pretty tasty as well.Crab cakes: I am so picky about my crab cakes and these were so tasty. They tasted fresh and it left me wanting more. Everyone ended up cutting the crab cakes into small pieces so all 20 of us could try some. I wanted one, heck three for myself after I tasted them.Ahi Tuna Tacos: This I vaugely remember. I'm going to say they're good though, judging by all the reviews, but don't quote me on this one...Overall, great experience here and will be back again! It's great for huge groups too, so don't be afraid to bring a huge party like we did. I'll need to dine in here before I give it a full fledged 5 stars, which I think it deserves.

The place is Seafood menu theme heavy,but non seafood menu is plentiful.Don Ho would be proud, Not to crowded had  options were to sit , spacious comfy booth my fave. Like the music playing in the background. Now to the food ,menu has many choices had the crapcakes for app and also had beef rib sliders both were yummy in my tummy(dear lord two appetizers, I got issues) My pal enjoyed whatever he was having. This joint has a nice breezy casual feel to it very stress free .For entree I ordered  grill chicken with rice and veggies which was the opposite of what everyone was ordering, I notice a lot of fish tacos type  dishes all over the place. I really like how they serve all food on square long plates. I would think you can call this place Hawaiian style seafood fushion cuisine. A lot of tropical drinks being served I had a virgin pina colada with a couple of diet coke(very common combo) Now dessert they had a nice selection I went with our servers awesome suggestion, the creme brulee in a pineapple shell which was very delicious,I ordered a second one which was just as yummy(my sweet Jesus two desserts, my days are numbered)  To tell you the truth I assumed this was a gimmick type place, I was wrong this place is legit.

It's called Tommy Bahama, a place I rather accidentally discovered. The atmosphere truly inspires, as does the food, and the service, and above all, the management (I met Marcello, he made quite an impression....). Anyways, there I was, ponderous about stopping in at the retail shop, when I found an equally welcoming doorman greeting me at the Marlin bar just next door. Truth is, we were hungry, and so we were delighted by the invitation. These guys are a class act. Distinguished, handsome, not too forward or aggressive, just the sort of greeting any gal (and perhaps some guys) might welcome! There's something sophisticated about this place. At first glance -- despite the handsome doorman -- it lends itself to being very ""un-New York"" - I suppose that's attributed to its effortlessness. It's elegant, and as I said, beautifully appointed from start to finish, but in a manner that is unequivocally relaxed (imagine life being one long weekend).

5.0,8/26/2014,"This turned into one of those perfect  unplanned evenings, where everything turns out beautifully and by the time the night is over, you just love the world in general.My parents were in town this past weekend, and what with my dad's love of Tommy Bahama shirts and both my parents' love for anything tropical (especially cocktails), I suggested the bar here to soak up the ambiance.  We arrived towards the end of happy hour, and I ordered the Coconut Cloud while both parents ordered the Pineapple Paradisio.  I love all things coconut, and this martini was no exception.  Even though it was happy hour, it was still a pretty strong drink.  My mom stuck with the Paradisio throughout the evening, and my dad switched a mai tai and he really enjoyed it (including the fact that it was made with orgeat; none of that grenadine nonsense).After our first round, we looked over the menu and decided to stay for dinner as well, which turned out to be a great choice.  We shared an order of the coconut shrimp appetizer, and they were delicious.  Mom had the sliders appetizer as her entrée (which she loved, but at that point I think the Paradisio helped), Dad had the kona-rubbed steak and loved it, and I had the tiger shrimp pasta which was really amazing.  The sauce had a bit of a spicy kick, and was so good.By this time we were feeling pretty good, and decided to go nuts and get dessert too.  Because they both sounded so good, we decided to try the pineapple crème brulee and the pina colada cake...and oh, sweet jesus.  Breaking the burnt-sugar topping of the brulee, my dad and I each tried a bite, then just looked at each other and realized we'd somehow found heaven on 5th Avenue.  The pina colada cake was also SO good; as Dad put it: ""If I hadn't tried this crème brulee, I'd say the cake was the best.  But...but this crème brulee.  AND IT'S IN A PINEAPPLE.""To top everything off, our server was possibly the friendliest I've ever met, and I've lived here seven years!  Tiphany was the bartender but encouraged us to stay in the lower bar level for dinner, so she made our drinks and brought out most of our plates as well, hanging by for a few minutes each time to chat.  She was very nice and always had a smile, and really helped make the whole evening a great one.I'll admit it: I suggested this place expecting it to be all kitsch and not much substance, a more tourist-y spot for while the parents were in town.  But everything came together for it to be a wonderful evening, and I would certainly go again.",4,1,1,Laura R.,"New York, NY",7,186,15

4.0,8/4/2014,"Boy do I resent the dismissive, know-it-all in me that overlooked this place for months.  I had a vague awareness that there was some sort of restaurant in this oddly located beach-wear store (was this place plucked from Woodbury, or an outlet in Orange County?), but dismissed any notion that the food here could be a viable option for a casual lunch, let alone anything business related or for a special occasion.What an idiot I've been.  This place is enormously fun with, believe it or not, pretty darn good food!   This must be what Olive Garden is like in the suburbs -a self-aware establishment that takes pride in exactly what it offers.  In other words, nothing resembling the sad waste of Manhattan real estate that is the OG in Times Square.  Seafood is a good bet here.  My group oogled the table next to us, where a lady was valiantly making her way through a heaping pile of crab in the lump crab and avocado salad.  That thing was generously loaded with enough crab to satisfy your craving for weeks.   Needless to say, that is what I ordered, and did not regret my decision.  Our group loved the short rib sliders, scallop sliders, and the ahi tuna tacos.Drinks run the gamut and are creatively named, deliciously described, and generous on the alcohol content. The shortfalls related to how long the whole thing took - from taking the order, to having the food delivered.  A few folks ordered the tuna burger special of the day (impossible to resist as it came with some sort of insane sounding wasabi mayo), which was totally underwhelming, delivering none of the bold flavors it so strongly suggested, and came out cold.  So yes, a few duds.   To be perfectly honest, the insanely crispy, fresh sweet potato fries is a large part of why I now adore this place.   We may have consumed a second order.  Don't judge.Oh, and the dessert.  The pineapple creme brulee  is literally served in a pineapple, which may literally be the most worthwhile incorrect use of the word ""literal"" ever.  If you opt for a slice of their fluffy pina colada cake, which is completely covered with toasted coconut, try to be prepared for the most massive slice of cake per order. I believe it was one-fourth of an entire cake.   Order wisely.",8,7,4,Lu H.,"New York, NY",1218,411,1977

5.0,7/30/2014,"No need to make reservations.... At 9pm on Saturday there were plenty of open tables.I was treating my mom on a short girls weekend in the city and seared tuna is one of her fave meals, so we decided to try this out.The menu we found online is NOT the same as the one in the restaurant, so don't get your heart set on having something (for me it was the beet salad) because it may not be there when you get there!This restaurant is above the Tommy store on 5th Ave. It's not as tricky to find as some people said, but you should keep an eye out for the entrance. The bottom-level bar was totally empty and I can see why it wouldn't grab people off the street as a fun place to be. We went up to the 2nd level where the dining room is and was greeted with very welcoming decor... reminded me of Hawaii and almost forget that the crazy city is just outside. The large throw pillows at the booths were a little awkward, they were too big to use behind your back, but without it you couldn't sit comfortably. Obviously they went more for design than comfort.We each ordered a cocktail, sangria for her, grapefruit/basil martini for me. Both were really good but the basil leaf in my drink was shriveled and had brown spots... not so appetizing, but it was still good.We ordered crabcakes, crab bisque and the seared tuna entree. The bisque was our fave with big chunks of crab throughout. All of it was really delicious.As we were finishing up the manager came over to ask how our dinner was... at first I thought he was just another customer because he was dressed in Tommy B attire and was just pretty casual. We had a quick laugh and then when I told him about the basil in my drink, he quickly offered a replacement. It was a nice touch especially in a big city where you can get lost in the crowds and don't typically get much personal service any more.I would highly recommend and I would visit another TB restaurant in the other locations as well.

3.0,7/25/2014,"Concept beats the food. If only waiters wore Hawaiian shirts!Hit Tommy Bahama with a private group and ordered off of the Tortola menu. Appetizers were okay; tuna taco actually succeeded in keeping a light enough touch to taste the rather fresh fish.  However, the vaunted coconut shrimp could have come from anywhere.  Crab bisque was generously flavored, a significant improvement over the more proletarian tortilla soup.As for entrees, stick with turf.  Mahi mahi was overcooked and overall uninteresting, but the Kona-crusted rib-eye was actually cooked rare to specification, and made for a satisfying dinner.  Props to the kitchen for not overcooking a group order.  Unfortunately, it's hard to tell how good the steak actually was due to the seasoning; it's not one of those steaks that improves the longer it's chewed. House malbec was surprisingly good.  But who's not ordering mai tais at Tommy's?  Restaurant stays open later than the retail store.  Shirt first, then food.",0,0,0,Steve L.,"Providence, RI",552,610,154

The waiter was young and attentive- always smiling. Our food arrived fast. The tacos were delicious.  My favorite were the yuca fries that came with Cuban sandwich- I think these fries should be an option as a side. I could of eaten a few more. My ahi poke was ok, the crackers that came with it were super stale. Our waiter was nice enough to bring us plantain chips, as an alternative  but unfortunately they had sugar and cinnamon sprinkled on top.  I could not eat them with my tuna , just not a right combination. He brought out fresh crackers that came with the original order- much better with the poke. It's a pretty loud environment so if you're going to have a conversation with friends, hard to hear and we were away from the bar we had an actual table.

4.0,7/9/2014,"I came here for lunch with some colleagues and clients.   I did not know that a Tommy Bahama restaurant existed.  It is a smart cross-marketing idea.  They have extended their whole ""island theme"" concept / branding into a restaurant and I was impressed with the set up.  Atmosphere (5/5): We were greeted by a guy dressed in Tommy Bahama clothing who opened the door for us.  The downstairs is a bar area which is separate from the second floor restaurant.  Both areas have a tropical island flavor with palm trees and island decor surroundings.  Service (3/5): The server was very nice, but quiet.  He poured our waters for us, which was nice.  However, he did not check up on us often and our food took a while to arrive.  At the end everyone's plate was picked up other than mine. Food (4/5): The food was pretty good.  I ordered the ahi tuna burger, served with large taro chips.  The sandwich was decent, but a little dry.  The desserts look phenomenal, but did not order dessert.Overall, I enjoyed the experience.  It was a nice restaurant to come for lunch with clients.  I would recommend it to others, as well.",3,0,0,KT Tershowski I.,"Tampa, FL",478,134,147
4.0,7/9/2014,"My go to after-work spot, unless its an absolute beautiful day, then hit up them rooftop bars with shitty food ;)my great regret is the happy hour ends at 6pm, which is the worst kind of tease.the friendliest bartenders in Manhattan. They remember your name and greet you with a smile and a handshake. Some New Yorkers might hate that, but I'm a midwestern boy and still have some love in my heart. These are things I appreciate. The service here is top-notch, and on one occassion (out of many) it was so busy that they took longer than usual to serve our food, and we received one of items on the house. It's like a great hotel, you don't even have to complain, they just know. And to me, that creates mutual respect, and loyalty.Decent beer selection on tap (but i'm a snob), I usually go with kona big wave - it's a golden ale that goes down smooth and easy - and reminds me of better times, like summer school at the university of hawaii and my best friend's wedding.okay, enough of that nonsense. The food here is great, but it is definitely on the pricey side.Appetizers - the goat cheese is flavorful, with a great medium texture, perfect for dipping, yet remaining rich. The mango salsa gives it a pleasant garnish. They only give like 5-8 breadsticks, which is never enough, so I always ask for extra breadsticks and you are good. (KEY TIP PEOPLE ;) The coconut shrimp is also fantastic, but you get about 6 jumbo pieces for almost $15. shrug. I also strongly recommend the ahi tacos. hard shell (i prefer soft), but just great. also bite sized, i can finish in about 3 bites tops.Main dish - sanibel chicken is great. stuffed chicken, creamy mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies. Just a great go-to. The Mahi Mahi is awesome too.Honestly, I usually come here for apps, drinks, and desserts.so Desserts - Pina Colada Cake - massive, sweet, and rich. Creme Brulee, nice and rich as well - and they put it in a carved out pineapple, who cool are we? the malted chocolate pie makes me want to punch my mother in the ovaries (please forgive me God). I would never do this, but I felt the need to make a provocative statement to stress how awesome this is. Total chocolate decadence. And then a strong desire to throw up afterwards. And you can't have a great tropical themed restaraunt without key lime pie. Go to town. They are all wonderful.The bars are a lot more packed during the summer, low-key during winter, which I guess makes sense. Live music with happy hippy looking people playing folk music playing often. One day, after a particularly shitty day at work I was sitting with a fruity drink at the bar, and the happy hippy looking musician started playing ""time of your life"" by greenday, which just made my day.It was perfect.

I was looking for something in the area and having had Tommy Bahama pop up on my radar so many times I was like okay fine I'll try it today. We ended up going in the wrong way because we didn't realize there was a ""front"" door to the restaurant so we walked all the way through the retail store and ended up in the back. Kinda weird but once we got upstairs we were like oh this is very cute. It definitely reminds me of Bahama Breeze (which I love) so I was happy with the décor. We were seated towards the back of the restaurant and our waiter's name was Dan (the man!) who was awesome. He recommended some drinks and was generally supremely helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and what would suit particular tastes. I had the Dark-N-Stormy which was very good and my friend got the original Mojito which was great. It was Taco Tuesday so I got the ribs... JUST KIDDING! I got one each of the tacos. My friend got the fish tacos with chive whipped potatoes instead of whatever the original side was. The whipped potatoes were great! I absolutely LOVED the fish tacos. They were super fresh and a nice mouthful of tender flaky fish. Definitely my fave. The other tacos were o-kay. The pork was tasty but a bit dry. Chicken was again tasty but there was barely any on the taco. The steak, I'm not even sure if there was any on the taco. I wasn't unsatisfied because they put plenty of toppings on there (mainly the slaw and their sour cream) but where was the meat? OHHH I almost forgot to mention the bread. It came out hot with a nice mound of regular butter and HONEY BUTTER. Say word? I love honey butter and this was delicious. We ended up eating another serving of bread and honey butter for dessert. It was that good. Now I do have to say I had a bit of sticker shock when I looked at the menu when I sat down because I wasn't really in the mood for $25-35 dollar entrees and $15 appetizers but the $5 tacos were a decent deal.

The place was pretty tricky to find because the address took me to their clothing store and to get into the restaurant you have to walk around the store and enter in the front where the bar is locates which is on the same block as Barnes and Noble.When you first walk in you end up in the bar which is pretty spacious. For table seating you would head up the stairs. It's bright and has a tropical feel to it so feels relaxing. Their seats are like lounge chairs and comfy so makes it more enjoyable.We ordered a few drinks. Their drinks are strong but good. Its on the pricey side.For appetizers we ordered the Ahi Poke Napolean, Ahi Tuna Tacos, Coconut crusted crab cakes and the World famous coconut shrimp. They were all so good. Along with the appetizer they serve bread with their own butter. The bread was warm so the butter melts right in it. My favorite is Ahi poke Napolean and the Tacks. They didn't skimp out on the portion because there was enough for 5 ppl. The Tacos only comes with 4 but we requested for an extra one. For the crab cakes it only comes with 2 so if you have a big group this might not be good to order since it's on the pricey side just for 2.For the main dish we to try the Tiger shrimp pasts, Parmesan crusted sanibel chicken, seared ahi tuna and the Kona crusted ribeye.  My friend requested medium rare for the ribeye and it came out perfect. The seared ahi tuna wasn't so special so will pass on that next time but will definately try the ribeye. The fun part. Dessert!!! I like that the waiter would bring over a tray with all the desserts so you can see how they look like. It beats having to google it to check the portion size and how it would be presented.  We all had a great time; the food was great and so was the service.

I had a Drouhin Chablis, it was great, but would have been great anywhere. My wife ordered  a sangria and questioned whether it was just a big glass of some cocktail mixer with no alcohol.

I just had to remember that I was in NYC and not Texas. As a TX transplant I now know what to expect with Bbq and pulled pork. In hindsight I should have gone with the Cuban sandwich to keep with the theme. The highlight was the key lime pie.

Its a comfortable place with nice cushiony benches.  The food is good.  And over the course of our 5 hour meal we only spent about $80 per person with tip.  All in all, i will be back.

4.0,5/3/2014,"I'm fully aware of the Tommy Bahama clothing line, as I'm owner of some of their high-quality beach wear. Though, the restaurant chain was unbeknownst to me until having been invited to join a luncheon at this establishment. I was quite impressed by the food. Decor and environment was also very nice, classy, and indicative of a higher-end restaurant. Regarding lunch, I can see this being a great restaurant for business meetups, or for more special occasions as the pricing is on a higher tip of the scale.I'd say this is a rather tricky place to find mainly because the signage for this place is not readily apparent. Located right next a Barnes & Noble, walk in and you'll enter the main bar and a flight of stairs leading to the second floor. We sat at the bar as seating was readily available and service would be generally faster. The space evokes mostly tropical, reminiscent of that distinctive Tommy Bahama brand, but without being tasteless or overdone. Their lunch menu consists a variety, though not limited to just seafood, as one would expect. I decided on one of their entree salads, the Seared Ahi Tuna and Arugula Salad, a well-dressed mix of Edamame, corn, mushrooms, hearts of palm, pine nuts in Tahini Miso dressing. This salad was packed with flavor and fresh, delicious ingredients that complemented the side of seared Ahi Tuna very well. The tuna was perfectly seared and mighty tasty. I was very pleased by this entree salad, and I'd recommend to anyone who wants a simple, salad dish. We also managed to try some dessert at the end, the Butterscotch Pudding. Rather sweet, but this was a really nice, delightful treat, even perhaps very addictive with each bite. I can say their desserts are worth trying if you have the room to spare.Tommy Bahama Restaurant has proven to be quite excellent. I don't say it very often, especially for any chains, but I was satisfied by the food. Delicious, well prepared, and nice presentation amount to a great experience overall. Service was average and perhaps even a bit slow at times, but nothing to be really offended by. I'd definitely hit this spot up for lunch again.",7,1,4,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",721,552,3545
5.0,5/3/2014,"Very cool restaurant on the second floor of the Tommy Bahamas clothing store. The ambience is very relaxing and spacious for a restaurant on Fifth avenue. There is happy hour every day from 4-6 with very delicious drinks. They're quite strong so be careful, it's easy to drink too much unknowingly. All the dishes I've tried have been very good. The price is normal for a regular Manhattan restaurant, but at least you can be sure the food won't disappoint. There is live music almost every night but my favorite night is Saturday.

4.0,4/26/2014,"Let me start by making it known that I am no culinary expert; nor am I a food critic.  I merely attempt to describe what my palate feels. I had no idea there was such a thing as a Tommy Bahama Restaurant (let alone being aware that it was located so close to my office) until some friends suggested getting together for lunch here.  I have since had lunch here a few times, and have always enjoyed it.  I always dine at the bar because apparently, table seating is only available to those who have reservations.  The bartenders are friendly and personable, especially once you have dined here a few times, and they start to recognize you. Here are some of my favorite food items: - Short rib sliders: two sliders with a generous amount of tender and juicy braised beef.  This comes with thin, crispy fried onions.  I still get an additional side of the Russet potato fries, which makes this my lunch (appetizer + side)   - Ahi tuna tacos: the taco shell is made with wonton paper, which makes it crispy without making it so brittle that it would fall apart on first bite.  The wasabi creme aioli gives it a nice mild kick.   - Fried calamari: the sriracha aioli is a perfect accompaniment for this perfectly done calamari.  - Fish tacos: the blackened fish is tasty, and the chipotle aioli and the lime sour cream combine to give it a great added flavor.  It comes with a side of sweet plantains and a sweet yogurt dip.    - Butterscotch pudding: ooey gooey goodness with white chocolate mousse!   - Pineapple creme brulee: my absolute favorite!  It has chunks of pineapple in it and is served in a pineapple shell.  The caramel layer on top is crunchy without being too hard, and did not stick to my teeth! Mmmmm... I think I'm going to have dreams of the short rib sliders and the pineapple creme brulee tonight, and there will inevitably be some secretion of certain body fluids.  Of course, I meant drool!  What were you thinking?",40,38,36,Kashif K.,"Manhattan, NY",1485,381,8670

Good looking place and comfy seating with big, plushy pillows to rest my weary back against. It was warm inside too...like roaring fireplace warm, which was welcome in the midst of this unseasonably cool spring weather. Waiters were courteous and attentive without being annoying.Our appetizers: Coconut crab cakes and fried calamari.Our Mains: Coffee crusted ribeye with asparagus, jerk pork tenderloin with what looked and tasted like grits N greens and filet mignon.It was all very tasty and the restaurant's manager was kind enough to come to our table personally and apologize when my cousin's filet mignon arrived, not properly seared. He even gave her a complimentary bowl of lobster bisque to enjoy while awaiting her filet mignon's return. Being the bday girl, my crème brulee filled pineapple half, was on the house. Such a gorgeous presentation this dessert was and the whipped pineapple mousse topping was a joy to indulge in.There was a guy playing a guitar for the patrons and belting out pop/pop&b tunes to keep us entertained though our meals.

5.0,4/7/2014,"When I first stumbled unto Tommy Bahama, I was a bit skeptical since it's considered a chain restaurant - a higher end chain restaurant, but still a chain restaurant nonetheless. But it's been a year since being in Hawaii or somewhere tropical, so I was really craving something with an island feel. So when my mother asked me where I wanted to eat for my birthday, I quickly made reservations for the Tommy Bahama in Midtown Manhattan.Our waiter greeted us right away and offered to get us started with drinks. We ordered two drinks and decided to see which one we liked more after it arrived. We had the Bahama Mama and Manhattan's Best Mai Tai. The Mai Tai was very strong but still good nonetheless.We opted to split three appetizers instead of each ordering one individually. First up was the Ahi Tuna Tacos, which is served with a fried wonton shell, Asian slaw and wasabi creme on top. These were so good! The wonton shell was hard enough to withstand biting but not as hard as regular taco shells. The wasabi creme was very flavorful without being spicy.Next up was the Ahi Poke Napolean, which features chunks of Ahi Tuna tossed with capers, guacamole and served with flatbread. I've been missing poke since we left Hawaii so this was definitely my favorite appetizer of the night. They did not skimp on the tuna at all - there was definitely enough tuna and guac to go round. Just like the tacos, the tuna was super fresh and I quickly gobbled up more than my share.For my entree, I went with the Kona Coffee Crusted Ribeye, which is served with a warm potato salad and a light salad. The salad and potatoes definitely helped balance out the savory steak.  It was tender and flavorful. The portion size is also insanely large!At Tommy Bahama, your waiter brings over a tray with all the desserts on it to show you which ones they have. I really like that they do this because I'm a visual eater and I loved being able to pick based on what each dessert looked like. I decided on the Pineapple Creme Brulee, which features a Tahitian Vanilla Bean and white chocolate mousse that's served inside an actual pineapple. It was smooth, just the right amount of sweet and oh so good.I really enjoyed my dinner at Tommy Bahama. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was and how well done all the dishes were. I don't think I had one thing that I didn't like! The service was attentive and our waiter was able to answer all of our questions about the dishes.

5.0,3/4/2014,"One of my go-to spots for grabbing an after-work cocktail and happy hour in Midtown east! Located in the iconic Fred French Building, across from the Tommy Bahama clothing store, the Tommy Bahama restaurant and The Marlin bar are two-in-one. For proper restaurant dining, there are a few tables downstairs, but there are many more tables upstairs in the main dining room.The Marlin Bar is legit. Awesome drink specials from 4-7pm Mon-Fri at the bars upstairs and downstairs. House red and white wines range from $6-$8 / glass; mixed cocktails and martinis are $7-$8 as well. My usual cocktail of choice: the Coconut Cloud. If you're a coconut addict like me, you'll love this cocktail! They also have some tasty small dishes on the HH menu, ranging from sliders to ahi tuna. The bartenders are always friendly, the bar & restaurant are decorated beautifully & with good taste. Easy to feel like you're en route to a Hawaiian vacation after being here for a few hours. There is usually live music playing upstairs towards 6:30/7pm. A good crowd / more of an upscale scene minus the pretentiousness and the douchy midtown crowd that some local bars will attract on a weeknight after work.Highly recommend dining and / or drinks at The Marlin Bar and Tommy Bahama Restaurant!

And we weren't disappointed. :-)Walking in, I was surprised to find that the restaurant was actually next to the Tommy Bahama store itself..pretty cool. There was a busy bar downstairs and the restaurant upstairs. I made reservations a few days ago..and when we arrived, we were seated right away. Interior was nicely lit, had a warm, inviting feeling. Decor was nice, seats were quite comfortable. Our waitress Felia, was very attentive and helpful. We looked over the menu the night before, so we knew what to get. Apps: We shared the crab cakes and the Ahi Tuna Tacos. Both were delicious, especially the tacos. They didn't skimp out on the Tuna either, and the balance of flavors..amazing! Crab cakes came with a slightly sweet and spicy sauce, which accented the crab cakes well. Entrees: Mom had the Miso Black Cod, which was flaky, melt-in-your-mouth goodness! I ordered the Mahi Mahi, which came with Quinoa Succotash. It was my first time having Succotash.. and I enjoyed it immensely. I actually finished the succotash before I dove into my fish! Loll :-D Dessert: We just ordered a Key Lime pie.. as we were already kinda full. It was okay..I've had better. But I'm not deducting any stars, cuz the Seafood, which this restaurant is known for, was that damn good! Anyways, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone, looking for an affordable Seafood restaurant in the city. The bar..and the Drinks menu looked pretty interesting too, I'm gonna come back to try that next time, perhaps during Happy Hour. :-)",2,0,2,Yu Z.,"Norfolk, VA",256,457,1321
4.0,2/1/2014,I went here during the holidays during happy hour 5 thru 7. Quite surprising that the bar menu had awesome appetizers like the coconut shrimp and their gourmet sliders. You can get interesting cocktails made for you by the bar tenders and they even modified my margarita with amaretto instead of triple sec as per request. The happy hour prices are half your 5th ave midtown average. Awesome bar staff and waiter service... I'll be a regular patron here in 2014:),0,0,0,Ian L.,"Wyckoff, NJ",38,2,1
4.0,1/30/2014,"Visited before 5pm so it was quiet, plenty of tables available along with a courteous wait staff.Large comfy booths with pillows to sit in upstairs.We ordered two appetizers, the calamari and coconut shrimp.  I loved the coconut shrimp, it was served with a slaw that was very tasty and yet crunchy from what seemed to be a few scattered fried won ton pieces -  not certain but it was excellent.  The Calamari was good but I've had better.  A lot of tentacles were served vs. rings with two dipping sauces.We ordered fish tacos and split them.  They were good, a nice combination.Drinks are on the pricy side, mojito fourteen bucksA nice offering of desserts.. I chose the key lime pie and my guest had the creme brûlée served in a pineapple which was quite attractive looking but served ice cold and the top was not crispy as it should be probably due to being pre-made and refrigerated.My key lime pie was delicious also served on an icy cold platemy guest ordered coffee which was fine, when i ordered mine from a new pot it was so strong I couldn't drink it.  I must say that they removed the coffee from the bill along with a drink that I sent back because I didn't care for it.  They were very accommodating and we had a lovely evening.When we left at 6pm there was quite a crowd at the bar, along with someone playing the guitar and singing",2,0,1,Carrie H.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",259,306,497
4.0,1/30/2014,Amazing appetizers! Amazing dessert! We had the tuna tacos which were amazing and the scallop sliders were evennnn better. The pineapple creme brûlée tasted better than it looked and it looks beyond perfect. The coco mojito was weak and the macadamia crusted snapper was lacking flavor. My friend got the veggie medley with grilled shrimp which was amazing. Would definately go again to try a different entree. The ambiance was very nice and fun.

The lunch is very good- I ordered the blackened fish tacos and they were the perfect portion and delicious. My friends ordered a few other things that they enjoy just as much.

4.0,1/12/2014,"I recently returned to Tommy Bahama restaurant and, again, enjoyed myself. A friend of mine and I ordered the same dish--the pork loin. It was super delicious and tender (probably the most tender pork loin I've ever eaten)... and the dish was man-sized (kudos for that). My bf, Tony, ordered the ribs, which we all tried a bit of. They were super tender (practically falling off the bone), and they were quite tasty. To me, the BBQ sauce on the ribs was too sweet, but both Tony and my other friend just couldn't stop talking about how much they loved the flavor (they have more of a sweet tooth than I do).As for drinks, Tommy's features a large number of fruity tropical drinks, but these are mostly too sweet for me... nevertheless, if you like these types of drinks, then you'll be right at home at Tommy's. My dining companions noted that all the tropical drinks they tried were more sweet than strong, so if you like 'em strong, maybe stay away from their sweet concoctions. I ordered a grapefruit martini thinking it would be more vodka tasting and less sweet tasting, but, I was wrong. It was too sweet for me. I ordered wine after that, and, of course, you can't go wrong with a good Malbec. On this visit, the service was a bit slow, which was strange because the restaurant was far from full. However, both our waitress and the manager (who stopped by frequently) were super nice and accommodating.",4,1,5,Scott B.,"Brooklyn Heights, NY",1165,650,2564

At first we were kinda skeptical but we were seated almost immediately, and it was too late to turn back at that point. The service was excellent. Dan, our waiter, was very nice, and treated us very well. We ordered parmesan sanibel chicken and the marinated black cod which were delicious. We were kinda stuffed after that and the fries as appetizer, and thats when we decided to get the dessert to go. We ended up getting the malted chocolate pie which turned out to be a chocolately piece of heaven. I know it kinda sounds too good to be true, and I'm not sure if they were just on their game that night, but we ended up having a great time and enjoying fresh food.

I immediately dove into my food upstairs, and to my great disappointment, it was cold. Like, freezing cold. I know that seared tuna isn't going to be scalding hot, but the outside should be hot, and the inside should at least be room temperature. This tasted like they cooked it and then put it in the fridge for 20 minutes.Two of my co-workers got the burger. Their burger and their fries were both very cold as well. This food had clearly been sitting out for quite some time. Why did it take them 40 minutes after the time we requested for them to give it to us?The taste of the tuna was good, but I certainly missed any subtleties in the flavor due to how cold it was.

I am not picky but I DESPISE cold red wine.  It was a chilly night so I was looking forward to a nice warm glass of red wine, or at least at room temp as red wine should be served.  The wine selection was really good so I feel that the restaurant is doing a disservice by serving the wine the wrong way.When I got to my table I ordered another glass and kindly asked the server for any glass of red wine that was kept at room temperature or at least not chilled....and she brought me over a glass that was chilled and said that unfortunately all of the wine was taken out of the freezer and all was cold.  Ugh, the wine did not taste good cold so I had to switch to champagne.  I hope the GM reads this and starts serving the red wine at room temperature.",1,0,0,Kassandra C.,"New York, NY",1,62,0

2.0,9/10/2013,"2.5 stars. On a random Tuesday night, my fiance invited me to a dinner date in celebration of passing my mock board exam. He always let me choose restaurants since he knows I yelp my heart out on places to eat. Quickly glancing through my bookmarked restaurant, we decided to try Tommy Bahama - some Hawaiian yummies!We initially walked by the restaurant without noticing it. I knew the place is also a clothing store so I kept my eyes out. Still missed it but finally found the place after I noticed the menu that I previously studied outside of Marlin Bar. Restaurant is located on the second floor above the spiral staircase. We arrived around 7:15PM and the place was about half full.We were seated in one of the tables with really comfy couch. Our server Daniel was really sweet and helped move the plant out of the way so my fiance and I could have more space. He also gave us the option of complimentary sparkling water. He came back multiple times checking on us before we placed our order. We debated about whether to order multiple appetizers to share or individual entrees. After hearing that most appetizers only come in 2 pieces, my fiance and I ended up going for 2 entrees and 1 appetizer - nut encrusted snapper with almond rice, tiger prawn and grit (special of the month), and scallop sliders. Here comes the bad part - the food took forever. The sliders didn't come out until 30 mins after we ordered. Thank god for the complimentary bread given in between the appetizer and entrees because I was literally shaking in hunger. We didn't get our entrees until a good full hour and 15 mins after ordering. Daniel came by to apologize but between the apology and the promise the food would arrive in a couple of mins.. another 10 mins passed. I couldn't even take in a word my fiance was saying to me because I couldn't stop watching where my server was going. Is that finally my food? no? how about now? no? When they finally arrived (given by the manager I'm assuming) - no explanation was given. Did they have to go out to the ocean to get my fish and shrimp O.o? Onto the food review - Sliders were good but the scallops were underseasoned. The shoestring onions were drenched in oil so we only ate a piece just to get a taste. My fiance thought the wasabi sauce over the snapper was overly sweet. He barely ate much of his entree before asking it to be boxed home.  My shrimp and grit was beyond salty - but i was soooooooooooo hungry I couldn't bother sending it back.. especially if i have to wait another hr and a half. The amount of salt - i can feel my blood pressure rising along with the wait to get our check.  I'm upset to have recommended this place for ""celebration"" date night dinner.  Although the dessert selection looked wonderful, we couldn't stand waiting anymore for anything from this place. 2 entrees and an appetizer + tax + tip close to 90 dollars. Should have returned to Vitae which is only a block away.",2,1,0,Wing C.,"Pasadena, CA",213,1497,10231

4.0,8/17/2013,"The entrance of this restaurant can be confusing. First, you see Tommy Bahama clothing store. Next to store is a Marlin Bar. Go into Marlin bar, take spiral staircase to left- it takes you to Tommy Bahama Restaurant!Decor to food, cocktails are all Hawaiian themed, tropical trees, light-brown wood tables, canvas pillows on comfy booths. Cute, tasteful place for a date. I came w a group of friends, which was cool too. Ahi Tuna Taco - Recommend! lettuce, tomatoes, scallion, raw tuna, wasabi mayo, sesame oil. Flavorful. Crispy Calamari- Too soft, small for my preference. Average. BLACK COD- Exquisite, tasty. But small portion.SALMON- Average. SNAPPER- Big portion but no good, skip it. Bland. Even looks unappetizing. Tasted no wasabi nor soy sauce like described on menu. Cocktails are $12 & up. Pricey. They have a  list of tropical, specialty cocktails you won't find at other bars. Go during their happy hour to pay less for drinks.Restaurant was half full at 8:00 PM, and only a few tables left at 9:30 PM. I thought this restaurant would be more busy on a Friday evening.

The vibe was relaxed and great for an end-of-a-long-work-day drink. Our bartender was nice for NYC and incredibly attentive.I'd really like to head back to this spot sometime.

Perfectly portioned into 4 tacos for the price of 12.50, you get fresh, tasty raw tuna mixed with tomatoes, asian slaw and wasabi creme. I enjoyed this dish; it was light on the stomach with a bold citrus pang near the end. RED, WHITE & BLUE SALAD- (Vine-Ripe Tomatoes, Sweet Onion, Romaine Hearts, Candied Spiced Nuts, Maytag Blue Dressing) The salad was definitely really refreshing and I could taste the maytag blue dressing and some sort of cheese flavor. Only complaint is that this salad didn't incorporate more candied spiced nuts. I finished dinner with a nice serving of their famous PIÑA COLADA CAKE. I thought this cake had too much white chocolate mousse in the cake and not enough pineapples or coconut shredding. It was good but I expected something more.

As someone who isn't usually a fan of pulled pork, this was amazing! So much flavor, and the straw onions and slaw were an excellent addition. Served on a HUGE brioche roll. Fries were good too.Got the Singapore Sling cocktail--also delicious and unique. Good portion too.For dessert my table tried key lime pie and the pineapple creme brulee.The creme brulee was definitely my favorite; it was served cold (still had a crunchy top), inside of a pineapple so you could scoop out the fruit at the bottom!

2.0,5/1/2013,"Judging by the rest of the reviews, i may have just had an off experience. Just went in with a friend to sit at the bar for a drink or two and some apps. The bartender came over in a timely fashion and asked if we wanted anything to drink. I told him I was still looking at the wine list, and my friend ordered a beer. When he came back with the beer, I hadn't even taken my eyes of the menu and he asked ""have you decided?"" I said I needed more time. No less than 1 minute later he came back and said again ""so have you decided?"" in a rush, I just ordered the sauvignon blanc (they have quite a large wine by the glass list). He came back with my wine, and asked if we were ready to order. We told him we were still looking, since it was out first time there, and we might get an appetizer. Again, probably one minute later, he came over and said ""have you landed on a decision yet?"" we said we'd like to order some tuna tacos, since we had heard such great things about them. He put the order in, and came back to us twice more in no less than five minutes asking if we'd ""landed"" on our entree choices. At this point, I just said to him ""we're not sure if we're going to get entrees or just a few other apps, do you mind if we just let you know when we're ready?"" For a place who's decor screams relaxation, we felt awfully rushed the whole time. Tuna tacos were great - could have used more tuna and less ""filling"" (capers, cabbage, raw onions). when we were almost through with those, we ordered the large crabcrake appetizer. It was delicious, although a little mushy. I prefer my crabcakes to have a little crispy texture on the outside, and it came with what looked like the same cabbage filler that was on the tacos (but no capers, add yummy crunchy won ton strips). Before my friend and I had finished our food and our drinks, the bartender put the check in front of us. I think he greatly missed an opportunity to ask if we wanted another round, or anything else to eat for that matter. We were there around 12:30 as well, I don't think they were trying to rush people out at that time. There was another female bartender who arrived halfway through our meal who seemed very friendly.

4.0,4/28/2013,"When I was a kid, one of my fondest memories was going to a nearby department store in Queens (I *think* it was A&S) where we would have lunch at a diner/counter restaurant within the store.  Something about going to eat while not ten feet away people were shopping for clothing was intriguing as a child.Fast forward to the present and that interesting juxtaposition of an eatery and a clothing store popped up again inside Tommy Bahamas in midtown Manhattan.  This time however, it wasn't a counter with mac and cheese I was eating at, it was a gorgeous restaurant upstairs from the Tommy Bahama clothing store.  Opened less than a year, I was intrigued to try a relatively new restaurant that had clearly had a lot of attention given to the decor.  Somehow the designers managed to make the place look elegant despite the large plants distributed throughout the restaurant (one so big our waitress had to actually push it aside to get it out of her way).  Other than big plants the rest of the decor is very clean and smooth, with off-white serving as a soft backdrop for the other colors in the restaurant.There is a lounge area/bar on the first floor (which we did not realize until after we were leaving) while a smaller bar is located upstairs.  My girlfriend and I were seated quickly and we got there just in time (around 5:30pm on a weekday) for by the time our waitress came over, the restaurant was getting packed!Our waitress was incredible.  She was nice, funny, enthusiastic and checked on us a couple times during the meal (you'd be surprised how this is becoming more and more uncommon).  She was awesome about explaining anything we weren't sure of on the menu and had a smile on the whole time.  Kudos to the training of the staff here, they run a professional shop!As if to punctuate that this wasn't just ""any"" eatery, a live band was playing as our dinner and Happy Hour began.  A really nice touch.So let's get to the food I had!BREADI know, who cares?  Dinner rolls?  Why would I review that?!  Because it was incredible.  A freshly baked loaf that could be broken up into four big chunks.  Included was a honey butter that was sweet and savory all at the same time.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!lAHI TUNA TACOSWonton, Asian Slaw, Wasabi Crème and Ahi Tuna come together to make an absolutely delicious and scrumptious dish.  The wonton wrapper is fried and shaped into a ""taco"" shell and the other ingredients are worked inside.  The preesntation is great, with each taco in a slot on a wire frame with curves in it.  The wasabi was a bit spicy but had a sweetness to it thanks to the slaw.  This would be every bit as satisfying with a beer or wine.JERK PORK TENDERLOINSweet Potato Purée, Pineapple Rum Sauce, Pineapple-Papaya Chutney and *perfectly* cooked pork made this a wonderful dish.  The pork was tender and juicy and full of spicy flavor.  The sweet potato puree had more of a ginger spice taste than the traditional cinnamon/nutmeg combination and it was wonderful.  Combining the pork with the puree resulted in a sublime bite.CHARRED BRUSSEL SPROUTS (Side Dish)This was ordered as a side to get some more veggies into the meal and it was awesome.  Cooked with bits of bacon, the menu isn't lying when it says ""Charred"".  There was a definite smokey flavor to it that was wonderful.I'll honestly say that my meal at Tommy Bahama was a wonderful surprise.  From beginning to end I can't say I had any issues.  A must try!",0,0,1,Benson Y.,"New York, NY",393,1300,917

Upstairs you will find a spacious restaurant-much bigger than most NYC places.  The atmosphere is Yuppie/Tropical.  The service was top notch during my visit.  Had the sword fish and they were able to change what the fish was served on due to a food allergy.  I ended up with a delicious cauliflower puree.  I was very happy with my entree and the bread that was served with a yummy addictive cinnamon butter.  Along with this I tried the Bahama Mama cocktail which was delicious.  To cap off the meal, I tried their signature dessert of pineapple creme brulee served in pineapple!  Delicious meal, top service, nice and roomy atmosphere...and nice restrooms.  A great addition to the NYC dining scene.",1,0,1,Kelly K.,"Reston, VA",277,1704,1315
4.0,4/7/2013,"So, I was definitely one of the skeptics about this place especially since I'm still unsure of what Tommy Bahama (the clothing brand) is. However, my friend and I decided to have dinner last minute, so I was frantically searching for a place to grab a quick dinner that was close to both of our offices.Based on the few reviews that were on Yelp, I decided to try out Tommy Bahama. To my extremely pleasant surprise, this place was great! The food was delicious (we shared the Short Rib Sliders, Bungalow Salad & one of the specials that night - I believe it was a cod dish if memory serves me right) and the waitstaff was very friendly and attentive. Prices were moderate and the decor is fitting for the restaurant.I'm sure this place will start to gather more attention once people realize what a little gem it is!Bon appetit!",1,1,1,Jennifer C.,"Great Neck, NY",170,188,276
4.0,4/4/2013,"Was pleasantly surprised by how delicious the food was here (given its associated with a retail store)! We came for a friend's birthday on a Friday night with a group of about 20 and were seated upstairs in the back amongst other big groups. Our meal included a drink, appetizer, and entree of choice. My friend and I ordered two different appetizers so we could try some of each which was a good call as the portions were quite large and definitely shareable. The tuna tacos were perfect - fresh, crispy and just the right flavor combo. Coconut shrimp were also good but a little too sweet for my liking. For my entree I chose the short ribs with brussels sprouts - yum - perfectly tender and falling apart. Everyone else really seemed to like their entrees as well.We could have used more than one waiter given the size of our group to speed up the ordering a bit, but all in all a great spot for dinner, especially for a larger group if you're looking for a fun atmosphere. Bar downstairs is a nice place to grab a drink before or after dinner too.",1,0,0,Nicole D.,"New York, NY",75,201,47
3.0,3/30/2013,"Wow.  I actually decided to give this place a chance since it is across the street from my office and was stunned that it didn't taste like mass produced food.  Granted, the prices are what you would expect for Manhattan but it's a place where I would recommend people take their  clients for lunch.  The drink menu looked creative and I look forward to returning for happy hour.  Try the coconut shrimp and the burger, both of which were good.",1,1,0,Peter S.,"Suffern, NY",53,181,5
3.0,3/30/2013,"Ive been to the location in Myrtle Beach and would've given it five stars had I been on yelp at that time.  I'm giving this New York City location three stars because compared to the other location the lights inside of the restaurant could have been dimmer for ambiance, the service could have been quicker (especially considering this place was dead on a Sat night) and I ordered a wine by the glass that was $11 on the menu but when the check came it was $14 and when I brought it to the server's attention he agreed that the menu was a typo but did not offer to adjust the check.  I don't care about $3 but I've worked in restaurants and I do think that top notch customer service would have adjusted the bill.  Food was delicious as I remember it in MB.  Coconust shrimp, miso cod, and swordfish.  Brussel sprouts could have been more ""charred.""",0,0,0,Whitney B.,"Charlotte, NC",22,88,23

5.0,3/19/2013,"One of my dining buddies got a gift card for Tommy's at Xmas and said I must go with her as a thank-you for schlepping her to all these great restaurants. Between our loony schedules, we didn't get there till 3/16, this year observed as St. Pat's Day.It's six pm, it's raining pretty hard,  and midtown is reeling with smashed leprechauns--all the more reason to duck in for island yum. It's up a bunch of circular stairs, and you gotta go through the store (and all those impossibly tall manniquins in resort wear) to get there, but not to worry--this place is seriously edible. The decor is streamlined with giant fronds to the ceiling and nothing touristy. No foolin around here, folks.The coconut shrimp were nice and big, with the most perfect texture and citrus/mango dippy sauce. (And oniony slaw for those who like oniony.) My short ribs were the tallest short ribs ever seen (took half home) and melt-in-the-mouth glorious, with cauliflower mash that could have fooled the staunchest potato head, and a generous load of grilled brussells sprouts. Dessert: pineapple creme brulee, topped with cream and a strawb, in a pineapple shell! My partner-in-crime went with the crab bisque (she says they should offer an extra large portion, not just cup- or bowl-size), grilled chicken over farro (?) salad with a couscous-with-edamame side, and a huge slab of chocolate cake. All fresh and fab.And our adorable expert waiter Efraim kept us in stitches with lines like, ""I can see you're having a miserable time!""One of my most memorable experiences of this baby year. The next night the feeling tempered the trauma of the March Madness Selection Show. Why do they keep dissing UCLA? Why is Michigan only a 4?

4.0,3/13/2013,"I am a big fan of Tommy's in Naples, Florida. When I heard it was coming to NYC I was torn because I didn't want to disrupt my vacation mindset when it comes to one of my favorite places. Well, I visited recently with a friend and we had a wonderful experience. Quite the contrary to my assumption -- now I have a quick escape right in my own city when I need a dose of Tommy's!

Rule of thumb is just not a chain in NYC; only outside the 5 boros.Well Tommy Bahama's warmed up my dinner party on cold Friday night.Once you climb the huge round staircase thru the Merlin bar, you enter a Disneyfied Tropical eatery.$192 bought us 6 alcoholic drinks, 1 virgin, 5 appetizers, and 2 deserts!We love the drinks, can't miss and strong! You won't have to buy 3-4 drinks to get buzzed, 2 will do. The Ahi Tuna Tacos, Crab Bisque, Calamari were great ! The sliders were ok/mediocre.  The cream brulee w pineapple and PinaColada cake were pretty good and enough to share with at least 2 people.Can't wait to go back again in a few months, but I know it will be full of tourist!Right now the set is very midtown, corporate, and safe.Oh and they have live music, if you care.",2,1,1,T C.,"Manhattan, NY",4,23,23

1.0,2/13/2013,"We had high hopes based on previous reviews, however, some of our meals were a complete disappointment. We all ordered the crab bisque which was great. After that it took almost 45 more minutes for our food to come out. At one point the manager came by to ask if we'd been waiting a while, but it still took another 15 minutes. Finally, our food comes out. My burger is not only barely luke warm, but basically raw in the middle (I ordered it medium). I immediately sent it back and another one came out in 2 minutes flat. Suspicious? As suspected, this burger was almost more undercooked/raw than the first one. I decided  not to even bother getting something else and resigned myself to eating $1 pizza slices (which were far better) on my way back to work. Another person at the table ordered a salmon salad. The salmon was COMPLETELY raw in the middle, I'm talking dark dark pink and cold. She sent it back but decided not to get anything else. A couple other people got fish tacos which they liked, but that was it. The waitress apologized and took the burger and salmon off the bill as expected and said the manager would be out to talk to us (keep in mind I sent my first burger back through him). We paid the bill, manager was no where to be found so we left. Definitely will NOT be going back there, nor recommending to anyone.

4.0,2/7/2013,"what i ate: coconut shrimp, cheeseburgerwell isnt this a solid addition to my midtown lunch scene. it is a nice in between option which is pretty rare around here  - not a divey quick pick up spot and not a fancy steakhouse or hotel lobby restaurant. i loved the relaxed beachy vibe which was a great lunch break away from the office. have to say downtown this spot would be a solid 3 but for what it provides neaby my office in midtown it gets a 4. the food was just ok. i loved the coconut shrimp and would probably just get those for my main next go around. my burger was good and large, but nothing special and i wouldnt order it again. also the fries were awfully boring for my side when i saw sweet potato fries and fried plantains on the entrees around me. my bf's grouper sandwich was also tasty so maybe seafood is the way to go here. we didnt get drinks but i wanted to. i saw a sign for happy hour so i'll definitely be hitting that up sometime soon (though note it was from 4-6 pm, so it will have to be on a very happy day indeed if i am out of the office by 4 pm!)I'll be back for sure",1,1,1,Christina H.,"Manhattan, NY",54,533,110
4.0,1/31/2013,"My first encounter with Tommy Bahama's food was with their food truck parked on 5th giving away free blackened fish tacos. Even though the peice was only a biteful, it was amazing. Packed a lot of flavor with the salsa, fish was nicely seasoned and crispy. My coworker loved it as well and we finally went to the restaurant after talking about it for months. The restaurant itself is on the second floor of the store, decorated like an island getaway, which was definitely nice to go to for a change from the office. Service is very attentive, staff is friendly and accomodating. We, of course, ordered the fish tacos. The restaurant ones were much bigger and came with a side of plantains inside a taco shell filled with pinneapple yogurt(?) sauce. It was good and filling, however because the fish were in bigger chunks, not as crispy as I liked or experienced before from the food truck. Nevertheless, I would definitely go back to try other dishes and perhaps for drinks sometime.",2,0,0,Katrina L.,"Manhattan, NY",175,378,98

2.0,1/18/2013,"We came here after work to have drinks for a friends birthday. I arrived and went upstairs, through the spiral staircase, to the restaurant.  At the bar, the bartender gave me a happy hour menu with drinks listed but the drinks did not have details.  Meaning, they had nice fancy names but did not tell you what was actually IN each drink.  So I felt stupid having to ask what type of alcohol was in each drink special.  So I thought I would make it simple and it went like this:""Which drink has whiskey in it?""She looked at menu, looked again, and said ""Uhhh I think this one does. But if you want, I could give you the ""house"" whiskey mixed with whatever you want for the happy hour price""I said ""OK, but what is your house whiskey?""She starts looking around at the bottles at the bar. Goes to the other end, continues to look around. After a few minutes she goes... ""Jim Bean?""Are you asking me or telling me? ""Since your not sure, can I get Jack Daniels?""She says "" No, sorry not for happy hour""""OK just give me Jim Bean with Coke"" and she pours the drink which is more coke than JB. Very disappointed. My friends arrive from their smoking break and we decide to get a table. Since the place is empty we are seated right away. At 5:45 we ask for more drinks from HH menu. The waiter tells us that he cannot honor the happy hour prices since we have a table. they are only good at the bar.  What?!?  So what would stop me from getting up and getting a drink at the bar and then going back to my table?  That makes no sense, happy hour should be happy hour everywhere in the place!  So the girls decide not to argue and they order different drinks and I switch to Gentleman Jack on the rocks.. cant water that down. So after our first round order, he brings the drinks and got one order wrong. So my friend asked him to get her the correct drink which he left to go do, or so we thought. We waited and waited and then a different person, female, came to our table and said she was our new waitress.  We told her about the drink and she said she knew, but it took so long to arrive. When it finally did arrive, the rest of us were ready for round 2.We ordered more drinks with no other issues but were very disappointed in the appetizer options.  I guess we like things simple, like Nachos and Mozz sticks.  Instead there was fish tacos (I think that's what they were) and tuna tar tar, etc... We were not impressed and did not order anything. We wanted finger food, not fancy meals.On a different note, the place was very clean and the decor was very summer/beach. Which was very nice and fancy.If it wasn't for the experiences listed above I would say it's a nice place but this visit left a bad taste for me.",2,2,0,Erik H.,"Brooklyn, NY",56,252,6
5.0,1/12/2013,"Stopped in for lunch after strolling on lower Fifth and running errands at Michael C Fina next door.  Much better service than Michael C Fina but that is not a fair comparison...Ronald was a great waiter regardless.  Not crowded at lunch as they have only been open a few weeks.  Opening was delayed by Sandy.  They have the same excellent menu as the location in Florida.  We started with the ahi tuna poke, basically a tartare with guacamole and lavash which was excellent.  Good serving size and high quality tuna.  Great sandwhiches and reasonable prices ($13-$15, in line or cheaper than nearby pubs).  Some of the entrees get closer to $30.  I enjoyed the cuban sandwich and my wife had the chicken sandwhich.  We both swapped out the yuca fries for regular or sweet potatoe fries.  Yuca fries are fun to try once though.I want to go back and try to burger which looks like another LaFrieda burger (probably solid, but the novelty has worn off now).  The desserts looked incredible but not quite ready for that in early January!  The French Building is also quite beautiful.",2,1,2,Scott M.,"Houston, TX",8,29,0
