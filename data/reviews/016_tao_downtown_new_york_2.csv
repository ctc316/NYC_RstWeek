5.0,4/30/2019,Omg I can't say enough about this restaurant. The food is out of this world. You must try the Chilean sea bass. The restaurant is gorgeous. The layout of this place is spectacular. It's probably about 3-4 stories high but yet it's still cozy. Make sure to Dress up. It's very trendy. You're going to love it. Top 5 restaurants ever.

4.0,4/26/2019,"Great ambiance! It's one of the famous pan asian restaurants in New York. You walk through a dark cave into an open room with high ceilings and a giant Buddha as their centerpiece. The room was nicely decorated with candles and lanterns. It was a busy night and my waiter was running around to get all the tables serviced. You definitely should make reservations. The food had a nice presentation. We had a large party so we ordered a few appetizers, entrees and dessert to share. Our table had the lazy Susan so it was easy to move the food around. My favorite appetizer was the crispy bao buns. It was filled with pork and water chestnut for a hint of sweetness. The glazed Thai bbq was packed with so much flavor of green curry. I would definitely eat it again. Their dessert selection had a giant fortune cookie with interesting messages. Mine was "" You will have an overnight relationship"". I wonder what yours will be...",1,0,0,Sue L.,"Brooklyn, NY",83,78,23

We split a few apps to start: edamame, chicken gyoza, and vegetable dumplings. All were very tasty  and came out promptly.For dinner, we decided to split two vegetable lo meins, two orange chicken and one sweet and sour pork among the table. It was enough for all of us and we even wrapped some up. Definitely good for family style sharing.

5.0,4/23/2019,I love the ambiance! I came here Saturday for my birthday and had the time of my life. My husband and I grabbed a drink by the bar waiting for our table. My favorite drink there is the ruby red dragon. The seating was so nice. We got to sit side by side which felt more intimate. The food was great. I ordered the $52 beef and broccoli...OMG amazing.

I am saving you a sh** load of money by warning you of the terrible food we had  at this restaurant. I am amazed that this restaurant is still in business. They may be a good night club but they should not be in the business of serving food. Bodega quality food, at best, at astronomical prices. The eggplant dish we ordered was raw. The rsushi rolls were bland and they have the kahunas to charge $20 for a vegetable roll. Run, don't walk, from this restaurant.",0,0,0,Babu M.,"New York, NY",0,4,0

1.0,4/19/2019,We were excited to check this spot out all the way from Vancouver- Canada.. heard many good things! After waiting in a line up for well over 45 minutes we were told by a bouncer with a gap in between his front teeth that we wouldn't get in today.. when we asked how come he simply ignored us and let other people in who were wearing sweat pants!! And some haggard looking women. He was extremely rude! I'm appalled at the type of treatment we got at such an establishment.. I'd say if you don't have some kind of reservation or guest list skip this joint! We had a much better time at Lavo!! If I could give a 0 star I would!!!!

1.0,4/17/2019,Unfortunately I had very bad service here My waitress was rude and didn't even act like she wanted to be there When I was ordering I had some questions and she just seemed so annoyed with me ... then about 25 minutes went by and a new waitress came up and checked on us which I thought was strange but figured maybe the other left...  finally I just asked for a manager and all she could say was I don't know who was helping you but this server is great ... Don't get me wrong The food was great but work on your customer service I'm paying a lot of money to eat here at least make me feel like I belong !Updating I still have not even been contacted or reached out to apologize for the bad service .... very disappointed,1,0,0,Ashley T.,"Irvine, CA",250,41,3
4.0,4/16/2019,"My family and I celebrated my daughters 21st birthday here. We had a reservation and was seated as soon as all of our guest arrived. They have plenty of seating all around, lil nooks in the corners , the ambiance i is very Sexy! The menu prices are a lil on the expensive side, i felt that it wasn't worth the price because none of the entrees come with a side of anything. For example, I ordered the salmon , and it doesn't come with anything. If you want rice, noodles or anything , you have to order it separately. However the food was very tasty. They charge a $25 cake cutting fee.  Our waiter was very attentive. Drinks were good. The overall experience was delightful, which is what you are paying for.  The manager allowed my daughter and her friend to go inside of the night club section and take pictures because it was not open. I thought that was very nice of him. The bill was a little more than I expected but i then realized they add the gratuity on to your bill.

5.0,4/14/2019,"Recently revisited Tao Downtown for my birthday. I've been to Tao Las Vegas as well as this location before, and I love me some Tao. *Fun Fact* I named my precious dog 'Tao' after the establishment because it brings back so many great memories. Let me say first, do not wait until the last minute to book a group reservation. I tried to book a table for 13 people about 2-3 weeks prior and was unable to. As per the manager, they recommend booking groups months in advance. I was however, able to book a group of 8 people for a Saturday night dinner. We arrived about an hour late for the reservation so, my group and I sat in the common areas taking pictures (check out the photo booth, if possible) and chatting. Tao Downtown isn't just about the food, its also about the experience. The decor is amazingly beautiful - the space is large with walls that are adorned with asian art work and sculptures. The dimmed lighting creates an intimate and cozy experience, and there is a large statue at the front of the room which instantly grabs your eyes when you walk in. We were seated within 45 minutes on the lower floor. For anyone visiting this establishment, please keep in mind that the menu is pricey. This is not P.F. Changs, this is fine dining and you will get your money's worth. I did not have any drinks this time around so I cannot comment on that.      Now, lets talk food. The menu features a fusion of asian-inspired dishes. So a little Chinese, some Thai, a touch of Singapore etc. For starters, my best friend had the pork potstickers which were pretty good. For entrees - I ordered the spicy chili chicken with white rice - its a saucy dish consisting of crispy chicken tossed in what I think is a sweet chili and soy sauce along with chunks of pineapple and onions. So darn delicious and the portion size was enough for 2 meals. My friends also enjoyed their meals thoroughly, including - shanghai fried rice and singapore mei fun. To end off my meal, I ordered a birthday dessert of bread pudding donuts. Let me tell you, I've never had a dessert this unique and tasty before. The dessert features about 2 bread pudding donuts lightly dusted in sugar, a scoop of brandy infused ice cream, bananas foster, and fresh strawberries. The donuts themselves were golden brown, crisp outside but oh so soft inside. Please, please order this if your wondering about dessert. If you want  a more extravagant dessert however, order the fortune cookie.Finally, service was alright. Our server was kind but appeared very busy. It took what seemed like a long time to find her once she left our table, and she took a very long time to bring our check at the end of service. I had the same experience on my last visit, so I'm not surprised. I also want to mention about the club - Unfortunately, we did not go to the club at Tao Downtown. Admission is not included with the purchase of a meal. As per the manager, admission to the club starts at $40. Bottle service is also a minimum of $1500. The music is also mostly Hip-Hop. I think I would return to try the club out, only because I'm really curious but I wouldn't do bottle service. Overall, I would recommend any of the Tao restaurants to anyone. It's an ideal place for a celebration or fancy dinner to impress someone. i'll definitely be returning! Thanks for an awesome birthday.",0,0,0,Monique M.,"Queens, NY",238,243,1005
2.0,4/12/2019,"My two sisters and I visited TAO Friday night April 12th and were served by Klaudia. We had a reservation for 3 at 6pm. The hostess was very accommodating with assisting us with seat selection as I requested a specific table. Everything was great expect for the service by our server. Our waiter did not smile once, spoke to us very bluntly with an unwelcoming attitude. Extremely rude and made us feel very uncomfortable and rushed, continuously asked what else we were going to order before asking how the actual food we were consuming was. We travel a lot and visit many top restaurants through out the world, and I should tell you this one of our worst customer service experiences. After finishing our platter, our plates were immediately cleared before everyone could finish the dinner their plate. She of course asked us if we wanted desert but after kindly declining she brought us the bill without us asking for it. We were going to order another round of drinks but didn't even have the chance, it was clear we were not liked by this server for whatever reason. Such a shame because it definitely ruined our experience at TAO, and won't be coming back.

It's a little bit on the pricey end, so if youre looking to order drinks and dessert on top of your entree, you're easily looking at $150 for two people. The food is worth the price, though I think at a place like this you're mostly paying for the atmosphere. Great music and large open space, yet its still feels intimate. The service is great too.

We firstly had to wait 45 min to be seated and finally sat at our cramped table at 9 pm.  We were bitterly disappointed with the experience. The service was abysmal. The server made very biased recommendations and was making condescending comments and faces when we ordered certain food items. The food itself was a mixed bag. The appetizers which were the Chilean sea bass and the tuna tartare on rice weee great. The barbecue chicken with green curry entree was horrible as the chicken was dry and chewy. Also when one of the party members went to the restroom, one of the servers took away the chair even before we could react and so our friend had to stand for a long time before he could get another chair and resume dinner.",0,0,0,Sandeep M.,"Middletown, NY",0,16,1

2.0,3/13/2019,"Came to New York for the day with a friend, decided to splurge for dinner at Tao that was recommended by a friend. We got there a little late because of traffic (that's New York), but called ahead of time to make sure they knew we will be there shortly. Once we arrived, we got many options of places to sit because ""they needed the table back at 830"" and it was 650. So my friend and I decided to sit down because that's enough time to eat and we can always move to the bar for drinks after. As soon as we sat down, our server ""reminded"" us that she needed the table back at 830. Of course, at this point we were a little annoyed and proceeding the night she kept reminding us to rush, including when she stated that we needed to put our orders in now. We both work at a high class restaurant and would be caught dead saying that to a table so we were very disappointed in how they treated us, especially when we wanted to have a very nice dinner on the only day we were in New York. I loved the sushi and loved the food, and the horrible service pushed us out from getting another round of drinks at the bar and another round of sushi as well.

1.0,3/4/2019,"I don't usually write complaints like this but this was just such horrible service that it's important that it gets the right attention. Thursday night 2/28 was my birthday.  I'll I wanted to do was go dance. Stephen suggested Tao. At the door my entry was free, but they made him pay $100 to get in. Which he didn't care about because he has spent way more then that at Tao before    He ordered  two shots of 1942 and two beers from  an female Asian bartender.  She gives him one beer, and then I was asking him something about the coat check. After a while our shots weren't there so he reminds the bartender that he ordered shots. She proceeds to tell him that she poured him the two shots. We never took any shots! So he obviously says that we didn't have them and that he has no idea what she's talking about.  She proceeds to lecture him about how it's not her fault that he didn't see the shots and then points to the camera saying the camera will prove she poured them.  He responds very calmly (NOTE that we are very sober as we only had two glasses of wine at dinner) by saying that He didn't really care about the camera, but that we didn't have the shots and never saw them.  I can only assume that someone next to us either took them or a barback cleaned them off?  NOTE: THIS IS CRAZY! A BARTENDER IS SUPPOSED TO SERVE YOU NOT RANDOMLY PLACE YOUR DRINKS WHERE EVER SHE FEELS LIKE IT! Regardless, she tells him that she doesn't care and that he has to pay for them if he wants his credit card and ID back.  So this goes back and forth for a couple minutes and I am getting really upset. He asks to speak to a manager obviously.  A manager named Billy comes to the bar and he explains what happens.  He seemed to be nice and says that he'll take care of it.  We get poured another round of shots after this entire exchange.  We are not in the best mood over this, so we take the shots and close the tab.  She brings him the receipt and it's FOUR shots of 1942!!!??  So he tells the waitress that there is no way that He's paying for the first two shots and she says that he must pay it if he wants his credit card and ID back.  He is FURIOUS at this point. He asks for the manager again and the waitress says that he's no longer going to talk to him and that she will not ask for him.  So now he's even more furious.  He has to spend time texting Dustin Terry to see if he knows someone he can text at the club to sort this all out.  He has to make calls and texts to someone who finally talks to the bartender to have her take off two of the shots.  Note that we have literally been at this bar now for over 40 minutes dealing with this. I literally wanted to cry. All I wanted to do was have a fun bday. And Tao made sure I had an awful night. The bartender and manager were so rude. The proper thing to do would've been to just comp it all at this point but he paid for the two shots and we left the club entirely.  This incident  ruined the mood of my entire birthday night.There is so many clubs in the city we regretted choosing this one. Stephen has never experienced service like this at a Tao Group property.  He's always been a good customer and He's never once hesitated to buy bottles and bottles of 1942.  For him to receive this kind of treatment over two shots of 1942 that he was never given is disgusting.  The bartender was extremely rude and made zero efforts to understand the situation. She made it worse with her accusations that he was trying to scam them, that it was his fault that we didn't have the shots, etc.  This is compounded by a manager who didn't care at all about trying to resolve a customer service situation.  If he didn't have Dustin call in, his credit card and ID would probably still be there as ransom over these shots. I hope this will reach the right person and they will take appropriate measures to educate the two individuals on good customer service. Note they never responded to his Email so they literally don't care at all about how they treat customers that spend 1000s or more dollars there. He doesn't have to pick Tao when there are tons of other options! Remember they don't care about loyalty so you should pick some other cooler club to go too!",5,1,0,Lynn A.,"New York, NY",0,17,0

1.0,1/30/2019,"Came here with my family (party of 9) for restaurant week (it was my sister's suggestion for her birthday). Very cool-looking atmosphere/venue. You won't get much privacy unless you have a balcony table. Between the music and all of the chatter going on throughout the place you somewhat feel like you're at a bar or club, as you can easily find yourself shouting to your table mates to get your thoughts across. First, my sister asked the server for the restaurant week menu and he didn't appear for 15 minutes. I got the spicy tuna on crispy rice as the starter/appetizer. It took 30 minutes for our appetizers to arrive (6 orders of the spicy tuna with crispy rice and 3 orders of the spring roll). I was wondering if it took a while to freshly fry the crispy rice under the spicy tuna but it was between cold and room temperature so I had no idea why it took so long. It honestly tasted quite decent besides that. The Mongolian beef was selected as the entree. It took another 25 minutes for the entrees to make their way to our table. At first glance I thought they messed up my order because what showed up was large chunks of beef (almost swimming) in a very thick gravy. It reminded me of canned dog food in gravy, just in a larger portion. Upon tasting it, so many thoughts flew through my mind. The beef was actually quite tender but everything else fell within expectations for this creative take on Mongolian beef. The gravy was very thick, heavy and they went crazy with the pepper. This all meant you were chewing a mushy, super peppered mess with each bite. I'd like to say I was disappointed but then again I knew the place only has about 3.5 stars before going in.I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you absolutely need to check the venue out.",0,0,0,Jonathan E.,"Westbury, NY",0,4,3

Next my girlfriend got the mango margarita which was very different than what we expected. (Disclaimer, are from Texas so.. we're used to the real deal) it wasn't great.. in fact I'd give it a 2/5.

I had to physically move the table over and then shove my way through the couple next to me. The music was also so loud I had to scream to talk to the person across from me.Now for the food: amazing! We ordered the fried rice. And then I had the crab roll and my friend had a different sushi roll as well. Both were great quality and portion size, no complaints there.Service: was very disappointing. I'm in the restaurant business as well and I understand the frustration of dealing with young customers because they don't tip well. Me and my friend are in our early twenties so I understand the judgement, although completely untrue in this situation because I always leave great tips. That being said, our server judged us from the beginning was rude to us all night and I knew it wasn't just his personality because he turned on his charm for the tables surrounding us which I could literally see/ hear right next to me. He was very nonchalant with us and used very colloquial language while to people who appeared older, he was very patient and formal. I even asked what was recommended and he breezed past everything not even explaining the dishes or making sure we were on the right page of the menu to even see what he was suggesting. And then when asked to explain the difference between the two crab rolls, he didn't know or didn't care enough to explain. I'm extremely disappointed because with a restaurant of this caliber, you wouldn't expect to be in such a situation.I'm very happy to pay for overpriced food at an upscale restaurant if it means the service will be up to standard or beyond.

Frankly, I was skeptical going into the dinner, expecting average-at-best food served at premium prices, this skepticism most likely resulting from past experiences at similarly-trendy spots nearby. However, I left feeling pleasantly surprised and satisfied.My girlfriend and I did what we typically do - ordered a few smaller items, one entree, and shared them all.  Tao did not skimp on the portion size. The eggplant side was my favorite small plate, oozing with flavor and juices. We ordered the Filet Mignon (Medium) as our entree, which was delicious and cooked exactly how we would expect a medium steak to be. Note that reservations come difficult at Tao. Booking ours about a week in advance, we could only secure a 5:15 PM slot. Fortunately we were seated in a lovely spacious booth overlooking the entire dining area, and the atmosphere was far less chaotic when we arrived than when we left.The damage was just over $100 for the two of us - not bad at all considering we each had a drink.

It's a beautiful place, super swanky and perfect for you to slay your instagram. We went on Christmas Eve which is by far the best night to go to dinner.  We had a 515pm reservation so pretty much we opened the place.  The hostess sat us in-between two other tables when the whole restaurant was empty.  That was annoying but the manager kindly moved us.  After sitting at a second table we were never spoke to again for 15 minutes,.  Honestly had we not flagged down the manager we would probably still be sitting there.  The manager rushed to find our server. (Quick disclaimer: this section should not have been sat because our server had not arrived yet, so all is forgiven.  Being a server I understand this can happen however, geesh! LOL)Anyway our server comes over and immediately gets us taken care of.  I order the Lychee martini which was more refreshing than sweet.  I followed with the Geisha which was refreshing and sweet.  I loved that martini!!  We started with their pork potstickers (TO DIE FOR), pork bao buns (NOT MY FAVE BUT MY FRIEND LOVED THEM) and veggie spring rolls (these were a miss because of seasoning and the 2 sauces were blah).  We ended up not ordering main entrees and just getting the duck bbq fried rice (it didn't look like traditional fried rice but still tasty) and the cauliflower which was bomb to toss into the rice!  We also re ordered the pork pot stickers because they were perfect.  Let me not forget the manager continued to check on us! It was so sweet of Jericho.  He wanted to make sure we were well taken care of and it definitely made up for the wait.  I truly love when a manager goes over and beyond to make sure we are having a great night.  We ended the night with their donuts (CRACK!!!!) and the chocolate cake (My friend said this was one of the best chocolate desserts she's had!)We finished up and made it over to the bar to see the bartender ""Captain America!""

He was sweet and drinks were just as good.  I would recommend this place if you've never went and if I went again it would be because Jericho was amazing and to try some other food to see if they can wow me.",0,0,0,Tiffani T.,"South Orange, NJ",8,47,35

3.0,11/5/2018,"My husband I finally decided to cave and tried out this ultra-posh restaurant for our weekly date night.  Walking in to the establishment you're lead to a waiting area/ bar. Despite having reservations, we waited approximately 45 min to be seated.  This is a surely a high-end snooty crowd. We fit right in besides the bad attitudes. Basically, it's like the Saks Fifth Avenue of the restaurant world. Ladies are dressed in designer heels and expensive handbags. Gents are also dressed to impress in fitted pants and collared shirts. The restaurant itself is awe dropping beautiful. Sexy and romantic. Cocktails are expensive but delicious and recommended.  For dinner, we were led down a set of stairs and into an open dining room with beautiful wooden tables and an impressive staff. Our waitress lit our dinner candle and we began to wonder if this can truly be our fall back hot spot. My husband ordered a bottle of wine, dim sum for appetizer and an order of BBQ spare ribs. Both were delicious and well marinated. Entrées on the other hand was a total let down. My husband ordered the Mongolian beef which was just OK. While I was determined to enjoy my crispy snapper in ""sand"" I sadly did not.  We didn't bother sending it back and decided not to take home the doggy bag of our uneaten meal.Final thoughts: The Clarke's will not return to this restaurant for dinner. Potentially we may return for drinks or appetizers however the meal is not deserving of another try. Also, the long wait even with reservations is just sad.

Next I ordered the lobster fried rice with the filet mignon ""Tokyo Style"".....the lobster fried rice was okay, the filet mignon had a weird taste to it.....maybe it was the thin layer of some sort of crust on top of the filet and the sauce that was in the dish, beneath the filet mignon.....I don't know.....the taste was confusing for me at best. After three bites I pushed the plate away.  Next I tried the spicy eggplant, and after two bites, once again I pushed the plate away.  For desert I ordered the bread pudding donut after having read rave reviews on it .... needless to say I was underwhelmed.....Personally, I can say I had a nice time minus the food that I ate.

Recently celebrated my birthday here and the staff/service was great. Food came out surprisingly quick considering how full the restaurant was. Have only ever sat either at a round table or 2 person table on the staircase and it is the perfect ambiance (away from the loud main floor). Food- highly recommend the satay of Chilean sea bass and lobster wontons as starters. For main dishes, the lo menu is good but the Hong Kong fried noodles are insanely good, highly recommend (ended up ordering a second dish we like them so much)!  The miso roasted black cod was beyond delicious with amazing flavor/texture. The beef Mongolian was really good as well (a bit spicy/peppery). Only thing is I would not recommend the sushi- it was good but not worth the price.

We were seated on one of the balconies, we expressed a desire to sit on the floor as it's more festive in our opinion. That was met with no response. So we sat on the balcony. Our waiter took no less than ten minutes before he showed up to take out drink order at which time he seemed upset that we wanted tap water despite the fact that everyone ordered drinks. As we ordered our drinks another large party sat on the balcony. They immediately ordered bottles of champagne. That seemed to please the waiter who proceeded to take their food order before ours. The food was excellent. Although I ordered two small plates and my entree arrived before I was done. It was difficult to even get our water glasses refilled. Skip to dessert. We ordered the Fortune cookie for the birthday guy. When they brought it, his girlfriend, who organized the party had stepped downstairs to the rest room. I asked the waiter to bring it back when she returns. HE REFUSED THREE TIMES. I had to get up and remove it from the table and ask for a manager. Christian , a manager, showed up and we spoke and they brought a new one. Not a positive experience. I frequently attend this groups restaurants and am severely disappointed.

They sat us next to some celebrities which was cool. The food was great and we got to sit in the stadium seating overlooking the restaurant so the experience overall was 5 stars. I was a little reluctant to go back because I know how quickly places in NYC go downhill, but I figured I would check it out again anyways.A friend wanted to take me out for my Birthday, so I made a 10:30pm reservation for dinner for 2. Again this was a Friday night so I automatically mentally prepared for a sh*t show. Well it was worse than I expected. There was a line as if you were at six flags, just to check in. Once checked in I was informed by the Hostess that they were running behind and I would receive a text when ready, but in the meantime I could hang out in the lounge if I wanted. We went over to the lounge and it was packed. I did not feel like stepping over people for drinks so we went next door to dream to have a drink. After having a drink we just decided to go to a less crowded place since it was already late. We went to STK and had dinner and drinks there.  At midnight, after mediocre steak and drinks at stk. I drunkenly picked up my phone and saw the text from Tao at 11:58pm telling me that my table is ready. 1.5 Hours later than my reservation. I really don't care as I have been to many places and am always in the area, but id feel terrible if it were tourists celebrating a Birthday who were really looking forward to the restaurant. (Because it really is a nice place)This happened to me at Cipriani in SoHo once. They lost the reservation. They write the reservations on an old school notebook. They couldn't find it so the Manager let us drink for free at the bar while we waited.

1.0,10/7/2018,"What a nightmare. Humiliating and upsetting. If there could be a minus 1000, Tao would get it. Handicap access is demeaning. Rude staff, they didn't guide us inside while hordes of twenty somethings folded in through the stairs. Instead, they kept me waiting alone outside on the street for 10 minutes. They sent me through a baggage area alone, where no one cleared the way, then after another 10 minute wait alone in a hotel lobby, they sent me down an elevator through the rear entrance of the kitchen that was dark, dingy and cluttered with garbage and boxes. Barriers everywhere. Staff woman begrudgingly moved a case of cans only when I stated I couldn't possibly pass through. I said that this is this black people were treated in the 1930s, forced to go through back alleys and garbage, and treated in a demeaning way. The woman then screamed at me that I was ""despicable"" presumably for making that analogy, even though I'd been treated like unwanted garbage. She became so abusive I finally lost my temper. Next the manager jumped into the act. Instead of being sympathetic to my plight, he told me I was "" disrespectful"" to his staff( presumably for the 1930s analogy which I was living at that moment -so diminishing and degrading for me) and he insisted I had to leave. I explained that I was the one who'd been subjected to this awful scene. My husband tried to reason with them that as a person in a wheelchair, their restaurant was not at all accessible, and that it was very upsetting for me to be so mistreated. We were thrown out anyway. And it was my birthday dinner. We went elsewhere, where the staff was gracious and welcoming.  I will never go near this place. If Tao answers this review by trying to justify their essentially racist treatment of me (disabled person being treated like trash), by claiming I was mean, they are lying. I wish I'd recorded the scene on my iPhone. I expect them to lie if they read their yelp reviews. Please understand that Tao and its staff have no sensitivity or appreciation for how to treat people with disabilities with courtesy and kindness, and all they know is to behave as if the lessons of our dark racist past were nothing they've even heard of. They assume wrongly that the lessons of the past that they only apply to people of color and that prejudice and bias don't exist today. Prejudice and bias exist with respect to all minority races, religions -- and disabled people. You can't treat us like persona non grata, relegating us to back alleys and garbage strewn alleyways, and then be abusive to us.",2,1,0,Terri W.,"New York, NY",22,45,2

The food was decent but overpriced and the place itself was too loud and they ended up turning the music up even louder. Crispy Rice Tuna ($22)-4/5 This dish was pretty delicious. I love anything with crispy rice- it adds a perfect texture in sushi and really complement a lot of fish like tuna. The rice kinda gets stuck in your teeth so (be careful if you're on a date). Lobster Wontons ($24)-4.5/5 I think this was my favorite dish. Wonderful lobster wontons with shiitake ginger broth and also some really juicy and tasty mushrooms. The broth was delicious and paired really nicely with the lobster wontons. Tuna carpaccio ($21)- 4/5 This had 5 thinly sliced tuna with a side of nori vinaigrette, which was tasty when combined. But kinda too small of a dish and overpriced. Toro roll ($34)- 3/5 This had jalapeño-soy and cabbage but it wasn't too spicy. Cabbage added a crunch to it. The tuna was a little overwhelming since it was piled so high and slightly fishy so I did have to discard half of the tuna to the side. Banana tart ($14)-3.5/5 This came with a tiny side of passion fruit (I wish there was more because it tasted really good) and white chocolate snow.  The tart was a little mushy and not that flavorful, but I did like the banana that had the crème brûlée feel to it. Coconut Sorbet ($12)- 4/5 I really need to know what kinda ""cracker"" they paired with this because it was insanely good.

It's loud and bustling, so good for a large group party. For our table of two and for a Tuesday, this was not the type of scene we were in for. Service was ok too. They food was brought out very close together, so we could barely let one course settle. The servers also kept forgetting things we asked for (like silverware), so we have to ask multiple times. To make it a bit worse, our server accidentally charged my card double when we were checking out. Thankfully my friend and I noticed it before I signed and left. Overall, I didn't have a great experience here. For a large celebration, it would probably be a fun spot. However, if you're looking for good food, service, and a chiller scene, go elsewhere.",3,0,0,Marelle C.,"Manhattan, NY",192,154,0

We already knew TAO LA and it was not a good experience even though I specified that it was an anniversary dinner so we were hesitant to visit TAO NY. But TAO New York, despite the fast pace of the city and the New Yorkers, made our experience very good. They treated us as if they really wanted to earn our money in good faith. The attention from the hoster to the waiters was excellent. Even the security people. All very generous in kindness. We went very early and we were able to get a table on the stairs so from there everything flowed. The food, drink and dessert are delicious.

I had the worst waiter though he was so rude, disgusting and very pushy. He kept giving looks to the people that did not want to order drinks simply because they don't drink. When giving out the check he said ""good luck trying to figure it out"" I gave him back the check with 5 credit cards and said good luck to you trying to figure it out. He said of course I will with a wink. When it was time to tip he stood there watching us. We gave him the check book and instead of looking at his tip at the back or something, he stood there reading every card. And he stopped to one of our guys who only tipped him 10% and asked him why?

4.0,8/23/2018,"Soo, we went here for my boyfriend's birthday on August 16th which was also the final day of NYC's Restaurant Week. I made a reservation earlier that day and made sure to mention that it was my boyfriend's birthday in the online reservation. When we walked in the decor was AMAZING. We walk to the desk and check in and were told that it would just be a couple of minutes to wait and that they would text us when our table was ready. Fine and dandy. We waited about 10 minutes, maybe 15. I lean in and remind the hostess that it's my boyfriend's birthday. She understands, smiles and types something into the computer. During the waiting time, we walked into the main dining room and the atmosphere was literally just out of this world. Anyways, shortly after, we get our text and we sit down at a tight, but still nice table on the left side. It was SUPER dark in there. Like, my boyfriend and I both worked at the same restaurant which is also pretty dark but like, I took pictures of my food and you can't even make out what it is.  I got the hot and sour soup, while my boyfriend got some sort of spring rolls. I got the mongolian beef which was delish, he got the salmon which he said was amazing. And he got some sort of chocolate cake or something and I got the sorbet. 2 martinis. When the dessert came out I expected like a candle and at least a happy birthday. Nope, nothing. They just placed his cake in front of him and walked away. I was a little disappointed but then we heard the server mention that he was new or something along those lines. He was training, or SOMETHING. So we were just kinda bummed. Me especially since I had mentioned TWICE that it was my boyfriend's birthday ya know. Regardless. We had a delicious dinner. I don't know if I'll come back unless it's Restaurant Week again though because the prices without the prix-fixe are outrageous. And while I have no problem paying for good food and atmosphere, the meticulousness of service is also important to me. Glad I tried it, but kinda bummed that I didn't get what I had asked for.

I love how well balanced and fun the cocktails were. For appetizers we had the spicy tuna on crispy rice because that's personally my favorite item on the menu. The tuna melts in your mouth and the crispy rice provides a crunchy texture to contrast the smooth tuna. For entrees we ordered the Mongolian beef and Thai Barbecue chicken. The Mongolian beef was sweet, a little spicy, and cooked perfectly. The Thai Barbecue chicken was a very generous size and quite flavorful. For dessert we had the chocolate molten cake. The molten part of the dessert was very rich and satisfying after a full meal. Service may be slow at times but it's a huge restaurant that's always packed so I understand.

Lets be clear about one thing, this is not a fine dining restaurant, sir no sir. There is nothing fine about dining here. Neither the food, nor the ambience nor the service. The l reason I still gave it double stars is because of the decor and the sheer size of this place. Such gigantic restaurants are scarce in New York, and yet somehow they manage to cramp it up with too many tables. They have a low light set up , and the guests keep flashing cameras every minute to take pictures,  makes it feel more like times square than an upscale restaurant. Even the music was too loud to hold a  conversation over dinner. The food was mediocre at best, I had the hot and sour soup for appetizer which was all right. My husband got vegetables spring rolls, which were also ok, we have had much better.  For entree we both ordered pad thai, which I know is supposed to be slightly sweet, but this was so sweet we really didn't want any deserts afterward.

I then asked her about cover charge and she tells me that it's ""at the doorman's discretion"". WTF does that mean??? The doorman can charge you whatever he feels???? We had a $300 tab and you're telling me we don't get entry into the club? This was my birthday dinner and my experience at Tao (or lack thereof) completely ruined my birthday. Thanks. They quite literally turned away everyone on the line. People were literally pouring off the sidewalk into the street. Pictured below. Even worse, they made everyone wait on line only to tell them ONCE THEY GOT TO THE FRONT, that they weren't allowing anyone in unless you had a table. You couldn't have one of your useless security guards going through the line to inform people of this? Instead you make everyone wait on that long line to tell them? BS. You would think a ""bougie"" restaurant like Tao would actually give an F about their guests and give them entry into the club.

I understand when food takes a while bc maybe the kitchen was backed up but we see the tables around us get turned so fast while it took like 45 mins for each courses. Our bottles of wine took an hour. Server poured the wine and forgot to pour my friend a glass then walked away for another 20 mins. Our cocktails took really long especially since there were 3 tables left. And on top of that, as we're waiting for our check, they turned off the lights then fully on and honestly the fastest service they did was clearing our table.

The miso glazed sea bass was pricey but absolutely heavenly and surprisingly well portioned, and we really enjoyed the rock shrimp lettuce cups as well, would've loved them a little more spicy too. Shanghai veggie dumplings were arguably the best fried dumplings I've ever had, so don't brush them off as a second thought like we almost did.Our waitress recommended that we each get an entree but managed to comfortably split 2 of them between the 5 of us. The coconut shrimp came with seven MASSIVE (like, nearly 6'4"" man palm-sized) shrimp and a great peanut sauce and plenty of coconut flakes, highly recommend. The salmon entree was great as well and we were glad it came with vegetables as a special, though seems to not be the case usually.The chocolate lava cake dessert was unreal and came with the best, most complex salted caramel gelato I've ever had. My recommendation is to order a few apps, a few entrees, and one, maybe 2 desserts if you're a party of 4+ and you'll be totally set. Will definitely be back for my next special meal",0,0,1,Ben S.,"Cambridge, MA",660,90,128

We ordered cocktails Tao tini and thai basil smash which were great. For starters we ordered chicken lollipops and hot and sour soup with shrimp toasts. The soup was ok but the shrimp toast was absolutely lip-smacking. We were not really happy with our entrees. We ordered thai bbq chicken which was not as flavorful as we have had in other restaurants. The chicken was not tender. Halibut was okay. I would say it was the best I have had.

Best part of the joint. Now on to the Negatives. The food is tasteless and over priced, I'll get better Chinese food for cheaper! The DJ was pretty cool but the music was super loud, couldn't even hear my wife who was sitting directly next to me. I said before that the statue was great but the down side to that is if your table is in that area you have all these random people standing near and over you taking pictures and disturbing your meal. I literally had one lady standing directly behind me posing and her cameraman on the adjacent blind me with her flash, constant problem.

We made reservations in advance and when we were seated it was on a weird table located on the landing of the staircase where we had to sit next to each other. Shitty start to our date night. We asked the hostess to seat us in the dining room at an actual table so we could sit across from each other, she didn't seem to like this and proceeded to just rush to the next table, not even waiting for us to catch up with her. Ok fine. Everything else seemed fine until when we were done with dessert the waiter just brought us the check right away without us asking! We had been there less than an hour.  I didn't realize there was a time limit on dinner. He didn't even ask if we wanted to order more drinks or anything. Just here's your check. As my gf scuffed down her wine while we paid the check we left annoyed at the whole experience. Honestly the best part of my time there was the friendly Hispanic man that brought our food. If the service was better I would've returned because the food was really good. I don't want to judge an establishment on the basis of a few employees because the tao in Vegas was great.

2.0,3/23/2018,"Speaking objectively, I can't see why many people have recommended this place to me. We booked a reservation for dinner and when we got there, the hostess had us wait in the bar for over 20 minutes until our tables were ready. The food is pan-asian and is family style, meaning the dishes are to be shared with the table. I've had many restaurants that are family-styled, but I feel like TAO's dishes are portioned awkwardly in a way where it is hard to share. We ordered the lobster 3-way (ironically not really good to share with 3 people), miso roasted cod, filet mignon, and duck fried rice. I wouldn't say its bad, but there really is nothing special that they did with these dishes that makes you go, ""Wow, TAO has good ____ and I'd totally come here for that."" A meal like that will cost you around $90 per person. The food is okay at most, but again I wouldn't come here for the dishes, especially at that price. Overall, I do like the ambiance and set-up of the restaurant. I'd describe it as retro and modern. The music is pretty loud there, and it almost feels like I'm dining in a club. If you were to come here, I'd say just come here for some drinks, and sit in the upper level seats where you can have a nice view looking down.

While it was a little difficult to talk over the music, it didn't interfere with our conversation--and frankly, the DJ was incredible. We never had to wonder where our server was. The cocktails were deliciously unique and we found ourselves enjoying a variety of them. The food--how can I best describe it?--we were simply delighted by the intriguing and imaginative dishes that were served to us. How good are they? 11/10. I'd happily go another ten years single if it meant I could eat here whenever I felt like it; given the prices, that's just fantasy at my current income level but I'm nevertheless happy to splurge on special occasions, and I will say this: every single item on that menu is worth every darn penny.

1.0,2/25/2018,"We decided to go to TAO Downtown for my wife's birthday dinner. What a disappointment!!!! I made our reservation more then two weeks in advance for 7:45pm on a Saturday. Upon arrival at 7:35, our table wasn't ready, not a problem , we chose to hang out at the bar for a bit. We check in with the hostess at 7:55 who said it would be just a few minutes as the table was paying its bill. Three follow up discussions with the hostess stand later and its now 8:45 - more than an hour after our reservation and still no table. Finally by 9 pm we have our table.Dinner was as expected, decent Asian fusion despite it taking five attempts to get a simple round of waters. As it was my wife's birthday - I asked the waitress if we could have a candle in a dessert while my wife was away from the table. When my wife came back to the table the waitress asked again in front of her if we would like a candle dessert. Which we all found very odd.I like the vibe of TAO but the complete lack of organization in the reservation system ruined a birthday evening.

Finally there was another waitress come to us, then the one in black dress suddenly came to tell us we can't put the flash light on, the flash light is only for the security!

If she doesn't allow me to turn on the flash light, she should just come tell me immediately rather than blaming me after I finished the ordering and the flash light was already off at that time. I think she is very rude to me, so I went to find her, I told her that she is so impolite, so I just canceled the food and asked for the check.

4.0,2/24/2018,"I had dinner here tonight with a group of my girlfriends. The decor and size of this restaurant is AMAZING. The hostess who I checked in with was very sweet and accommodating. Our waiter was decent. My friend wasn't happy with her drink and he swapped it out for a different one upon my request. At first he made it seem like nothing could be done but I know the restaurant business well so something could always be done. Another thing I disliked was he basically forced us to order appetizers and entrees at the same time. Our reservation was at 9 so the kitchen was not closing anytime soon. I didn't feel pressured by him, he gave us our time but we over ordered because of this. The food was amazing! Like so good honestly... the pork lo mein to die for! The lobster egg roll so good! This spicy chicken dish we ordered was so tasty as well. However the pecking duck was such a disappointment. Such a small portion and it tasted so bland except for one piece I had which tasted like pure salt. Just awful! And lastly when it came to the bill the waiter inquired about his tip when we explained and handed him a part cash part card payment. That was just uncalled for since we took care of him and already put his 20% on the side in cash. At the end there was still a difference in cash that needed to be paid and he just stood over our table while 5 separate individuals signed their statement as if we were going to run away and not pay him the difference while the other girls got their cash together.

There's a koi pond with a massive Buddha at the very center and warm radiant lighting engulfs the entire space.But I think that's what people pay for when the come here... the ambiance! The food was really just okay -- at least what we ordered.The Good: The veggie udon was tasty and had a garlic kick, the tuna tartare was fresh and had just the right amount of lime. And the chocolate box-like dessert was sooo smooth and chocolatey with an epically rich caramel filling. The banana doughnuts were super soft and had just the right amount of caramelized bananas. Cauliflower side was pretty good but also kinda tooooo saucy. Lobster egg rolls and wontons were also super flavorful and tasty. And of course presentation for everything was The Mehhh: But the Pad Thai was really just average (a lot of peanuts, but not enough sauce), the shanghai veggie dumplings were kind of bland, the shrimp lettuce cups were over-fried and the salmon was not bad but just too 'fishy.'

I recommend the giant fortune cookie however, all desserts are all delicious.The staff was friendly and polite which is rare in NYC. Everything we tried was extremely good.

4.0,2/14/2018,"TAO was surprisingly much better than I had expected. I thought that it would be a restaurant that doles out expensive cocktails and mediocre food and everyone went there because it is trendy. However, the food and our server were great. The $20 cocktails are a bit much still and I did not think that they were inspired enough to warrant that price tag.For food we ordered family style and let our server choose the most popular dishes. She really delivered on her decisions. The highlights were the sea bass, short ribs, lettuce wraps, and lobster fried rice. The sea bass was glazed with a delicious dressing. The lettuce wraps had great texture and were a light contrast to the overall heavy and rich dishes. My critique is that there were three noodle dishes that came out and they tasted very similarly. Additionally, the fried fish fillets were extremely salty. We also had an assortment of sushi, which was good.The ambience of the restaurant is a bit uppity and not a place that one strolls in wearing sweatpants or athleisure clothes. Everyone in the restaurant was dressed up in at least dark jeans. Typical Meatpacking.The cocktails definitely add up and can increase the bill exponentially.

I ordered drunken pad Thai. It is decent but overly sweet and very small bits of lobster. Too sweet to finish, that was $34. Also got the halibut with shrimp. The halibut was bland and the shrimp were very very small. Like baby shrimp. Expected a bit more for $40. I wish we knew, we would have ordered some jasmine rice as a side which would have been $8.

Tuna Poke was delicious. Mizuna chopped salad with tofu was really good. Agedeshi tofu was flavorful, Maybe a little too wet, I felt the same way about the egg plant, very tasty but overly wet. Cauliflower side was terrific. The broccoli was under cooked and bland.  The Dim Sum dumplings were a highlight.  Vegatable sushi roll also good. Pad Thai was also very good, original flavor.  Vegetarian udon was great, generous portion.  Bread putting donuts with bananas Foster was fantastic, the ice cream on the side was perfect complement. Chocolate cake was A beautiful presentation, could've been a little more to it but it was also delicious.",0,0,0,Howard B.,"Dresher, PA",0,56,0
3.0,12/27/2017,"Let me start out by saying that you are paying for the ambiance and the TAO name!! It is unbelievably beautiful inside. Other than that, you are paying for overpriced food. The fortune cookie dessert was the best part. Drinks are astronomically priced up along with the food. The portions are very small and I would not recommend sharing one dish with more than one person. The fried rice wasn't the best and I would expect an Asian Fusion restaurant to have kick ass fried rice. Our server was ok. The food was rushed out immediately. Very quickly seated, served, and received our check. They must have a very quick table turnover rate. Honestly the best part was the giant fortune cookie dessert. That was the best! I don't mind spending money on good food if it is worth it, and that was the only thing worth it food wise!! The broccoli we ordered did not have any florets it was more so the stem of the broccoli. No florets. I requested no shrimp in fried rice due to an allergy, they told me it would be an up-charge! It was an expensive night out just to enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant. Everything else was subpar at best. The food and service was nothing to rave about. I highly suggest reservations in advance.",0,0,0,Anjelica R.,"New Hyde Park, NY",11,57,34

3.0,12/7/2017,"If I had one word for this place it would be overpriced. The decor of this place is amazing though, I have not been to a restaurant with such focus for the decor as TAO. The place itself is pretty dark, which I am not a huge fan of because I like to see what I am eating but that's the vibe of this place. Since, we had a reservation we were seated immediately and our waitress was extremely friendly and nice. The menu was pretty extensive but it was also pretty price-y as well. I got a chicken pad thai and it was pretty mediocre for its price. The flavors were way too strong and the dish itself was extremely salty, after a few bites I got sick of the taste since it was so overwhelming. One of my friends got a glazed thai bbq chicken and her dish was also extremely salty as well. Our other friends got a Mandrian Sizzled Fried Rice with roasted pork and their dish was just alright, similar to our dishes it also had very strong flavors that you get a bit sick of after a while. Since we came for my friend's birthday, we decided to get the big fortune cookie, which was pretty much the highlight of our meal, the moose flavors went together nicely with the softness of the ""cookie."" Overall, our bill came out to be around $30-$35 per person including tips and tax which is pretty pricey considering the taste of the food.

It is quite the dining experience and the spectacle. There are slope of stairs which lead to dining tables. I recall a group of rather young good looking women walking down the stairs and it felt like everyone just gazed that way. The food was fresh - we ordered a plethora of sushi sashimi boats and the chicken lollipops. With all that food, we still managed to eat the sea bass which is delectable.

With our reservation we were seated right away. The decor of the restaurant is really cool. The place is decorated from floor to ceiling. All the food we ordered was good.  Got the spring rolls to start. I got the coconut shrimp as my entree. It was a pretty big serving. It doesn't come with a side so I had to order rice separately. My bf got the crispy Thai pork it comes with mango sticky rice. He didn't care for the sticky rice much but enjoyed the rest. We got the bread pudding donuts for dessert. It was delicious. By the end we were stuffed. We also got cocktails which were really good. There was a dj somewhere playing music. The music was great, I was dancing in my seat. The atmosphere is very live.

I asked my server to make the second drink less sweet and he did, plus adding a fresh orchid. Nice. touch. Apps of Edamame (big portion, ultra fresh) and Hamachi Kosho, both soo good. We opted for the Steak for Two special, tender steak on the bone with truffle fries and greens. Excellent choice and not too rich/buttery as in traditional steak places. For dessert we shared the giant wonton, light yet decadent. I have a bad knee but stairs were well lit so managed to make my way downstairs with no mishap.

She saw my boyfriend search his pockets and only pull out the blank customer copy which proves we left the merchant copy (at this point an apology should've been in order and perhaps a discussion with your busser). My boyfriend and I attended a broadway show on 54th street tonight and decided to take an Uber downtown specifically to Tao. We could've gone to any other place on 54th and now I wish we would've rather done that and saved time and uber money. I watched as my boyfriend filled in the tip amount and signed the merchant copy and put it back in the check presenter along with their pen. This only added the icing to the cake after my boyfriend asked the runner for a set of silverware for his salmon (because his original set was taken when our appetizers were cleared from the table) and all he did was point at mine and ran away towards the big tables on the main floor. This was such an awkward experience and has definitely left a sour memory in my mind of this location. Luckily for her, he gave his copy of the receipt and filled it out again with the same gratuity.

3.0,11/21/2017,"Love the interior decor, was ok with the food (esp. for the price).  Came with a friend for dinner on a weekday.Venue: dark wood accents with Asian-esque decorations (think Buddhas) and intricately carved wooden walls.  Quite dark inside, so you'll need to use your phone flashlight to see anything.  Tables are a bit on the crowded side.  It can also get a bit loud, especially when (like we did) you have an incredibly drunk, rowdy group sitting next to you.  Somewhat understandable since it's next to the Tao nightclub, but I do prefer being able to hear my friend when we are chatting instead of listening to the next table over shouting for more shots.  Service: I put this on the slower side; felt like we were waiting for certain dishes and had to ask the waiter for a status.  Hard to flag them down too.Food: in general, portions were decently-sized; we just ordered way too much.  Also not a fan of somewhat higher prices for what you got.-- Chilean sea bass satay (miso glaze)($23) - best dish of the evening.  Think of your typical miso-glazed bass dish you might order in an Asian restaurant except on a stick.  Not sure why two sticks cost $23 dollars (is Chilean sea bass THAT expensive?)-- Dim sum dumpling platter (seafood, pork, chicken, veggie)($34) - 8 dumplings included, two of each so great for sharing in groups of 2.  Dumplings are pretty sizeable; I felt quite full after eating these 4 dumplings.  In order, my favorites were the seafood, chicken, pork and veggie, but all were good.-- Largest Omakaze ($99) - think twice before ordering this for 2 people; it's quite massive.  You'd think something this huge would be great for sharing, except they only gave one piece of everything, so you kinda have to figure out who gets what on the plate (beware if you both like something).  Biggest disappointment of the night.-- Drunken pad thai ($34) - noodles slightly overcooked and were sticking together, making it hard to grab.  Not sure if the portion justifies the price (it's not a massive bowl) but maybe it's b/c of the lobster chunks that are in the dish.  Slightly on the spicy side fyi.-- Steamed bok choy with garlic ($14) - hard to go wrong with steamed galic bok choy, and this one didn't disappoint.  I ended up stuffing myself with this dish; loved how they added crispy garlic bits on top to give the dish even more texture-- Mochi tasting ($14) - we got vanilla, chocolate, and pumpkin.  All had a decent amount of flavor and wasn't too hard so that you could still bite into it without feeling like you will break your teeth.In summary, decor is pretty cool to look at (if you can block out the drunk crowd that might be there), though I'm not sure I would necessarily come back here for the food.",3,0,1,Audrey H.,"San Francisco, CA",367,194,612

The décor was great which added to this positive dining experience.

I brought my girlfriends here because this was one friend's first visit to NYC. I wanted her to have a unique NY dining experience to start the trip off right. We had an early reservation since we had a little show called Hamilton to catch after. So Tao wasn't bustling at full tilt just yet.A big part of dining here is the ambiance. From the moment you walk through the heavy red doors, to taking that turn from the entry hall into the main dining room, it's like stepping into another world. And that world looks pretty impressive atop the stairs. The first time I ate here, my husband and I got a seat at the low two tops along the stairs. In my opinion, it's the best place to eat with a date since you sit side by side while taking in the rest of the restaurant in front of you. This time we sat on the main floor, right by the goddess statue. And of course, we ordered drinks. All delicious. Lychee martini is highly recommended. Now the food! Most important, right? Again, all delicious. We got the ""snapper in sand"" which is particularly impressive in presentation but also really tasty. Crispy, salty, and cooked perfectly. We ordered a variety of dumplings (skins weren't too thick, nice chewy texture), tomato and bacon yakitori (skewers), Hong Kong fried noodles, and Chinese broccoli. Everyone loved the food. Being that we did family style, we all had a little bit of everything. To top off the whole experience, our wait staff was wonderful.

Last Sunday I went to TAO with a couple of friends after my birthday brunch at Dos Caminos Meatpacking. Being one of my favorites in the city (or used to be), I wanted to share a bottle of wine and two appetizers with two of my friends. We sat at the food bar in the main dinning room. The total of the check was $160 and decided to split it into two ($60 and $100). Later that week while checking my charges on my American Express App I realized there was a charge for $100 (even when my friend also got charged $100), it is important to mention that we left a 20% gratuity (on the card and cash, respectively)I called TAO earlier this week, a lady (which is guess was a manager) promised me to fix the issue and to call me back (I never received that call), then called back later this week and another lady, identified as ""Alexa Ottobri"" suggested me to call ""corporate office"", an office that never answered any phone calls on its accounting department. Now I'm upset with this uncomfortable situation. I'm also a restaurant owner in NY and I would not toley something like this to happen at any of my businesses if I received this type of complaint from a costumer. So we technically tipped 80% on a bottle of wine and two apps that we had at a food bar. Is that fair?

We were even slightly rushed out toward the end of our meal in order to free up the table for more customers!The waitress sat us and took our orders promptly, and recommended she order for us as we were a larger group which was pretty neat. We were brought several appetizers I believe they bring them by headcount. They ranged from short ribs to sushi to dumplings. Everything was fresh and really good. For dinner, we were brought the wagyu beef, lobster fried rice, pork, and a few others. I can't say that there was anything on the table I did not enjoy.

After checking in we were asked to wait in the lounge or bar area so we grabbed a drink and waited for 35 minutes and still the buzzer wouldn't ring so I went and checked with the hostess and she came up with a lame excuse about the delay and got us a table right away. After getting seated we waited another 20/25 minutes until our waitress by the name of Christina felt like showing up and taking our order, but since she really didn't feel like working that day, therefor she came up with a story about TAO's Kitchen. She told us that we have to give all of our orders(appetizer, main course, drinks &...) to her all at once cause the kitchen can not accommodate orders piece by piece and she can not check back with us to take further orders. Even Denny's doesn't have such policy, this creative Christina said that so she would serve each table just 3 times: get the orders, drop the bill on the table and collect $$$.Her attitude and the awful service just killed our night.

My friend had a raspberry cosmopolitan and she really enjoyed it because it wasn't too sweet and a little tart. I very much enjoyed my riesling wine. The wine was imo the best wine I've ever had. I say that because I usually get a headache after drinking alcohol. But with this riesling wine I didn't feel a headache at all. I highly recommend their wines and mixed drinks. I had their spicy eggplant dish and it was super filling. I would opt out of the mayo that came on top of the eggplant for the future. My friend really enjoyed her foods. This place is great for drinks. Even their bar area while I waited for my friend to arrive is intimate and the seating there are comfy.,4,2,4,Cate L.,"New York, NY",89,143,828

We are at Tao with a Group of 10 the service from the bar to the table was impeccable!  We were seated right on time for our reservation.  We shared all the dishes so I am not going to list them all, there were to many but all were great! We had the Edamame, chicken satay, temple salad, salmon tartare, the Chilean sea bass was outrageous! Also the tuna poke was fresh and delicious.  The giant fortune cookie and ice cream was fantastic.  We also had a bottle of Sake and drinks.

1.0,10/16/2017,"To be honest I have been going and suggesting this place for at least 3 years to friends and family that come to NYC but our experience we received last Friday night was horrific and I was so embarrassed.So let me prepare you! If you intend to drink at the bar expect sour faced and obviously bar staff not enjoying what they do and a smile would be pushing it. Then open a bar tab but be careful you don't sit 2 feet away from the bar (yes same area) because you will have to close the tab to sit down at the bar to be served and order drinks (crazy shit going on here).Next be sure to close off the tab before going to sit and eat at the restaurant which of course is pre-booked because not only will your card go missing from the bar, its seconded to the other part of the restaurant, charged of course and a nightmare to retrieve (not to mention the nasty manager who made us feel like crooks (he was revolting and had no idea). He is a thug pretending to be managing the coolest place in town with no idea how to speak nor treat guests (mafia appeared to be running this place).The attitude in the establishment is that it's licensed to print money and OH MY LORD prepare to pay through the nose for Asian cuisine (great food but so over priced).

5.0,10/12/2017,"Even though I give this place five stars I do have a few issues I'd like to address. it's insane to me how this club atmosphere changes when there's a famous person or somebody high ranking there e. The doorman literally pretend like they don't know you even if you're a regular. And it makes me mad that they won't just simply  decline you... they will make you feel like shit. I don't believe that's necessary and plus in 2017 when People are so sensitive and they could literally catch  problems if they  upset the wrong person. Like for example the night that Travis Scott perform there, the doorman were being very weird about the height of the girls, if you weren't at least 5'9, they made an excuse to not let you in. I was with friends who happened to be shorter and I wasn't going to just leave them so we had to wait around for the manager. But the bouncer was so unnecessarily rude to my friend, saying Word for Word ""there's a reason why you're not getting in"" with A nasty look and attitude. one last thing, the bartenders really should not be as rude as they are and I noticed this a couple of times. But again that happens only on select night that they have somebody important there. But besides everything it's a really great place!

2.0,10/9/2017,"Came for a special dinner with my son for his birthday. Great vibe. Food was a bit hit or miss. Some choices like the crispy rice tuna were great. Others purely mediocre- rock shrimp lettuce cups. We ordered a ton of food for the two of us- $275 dollars worth. What I can't believe is that despite informing the restaurant in advance that it was my sons birthday they couldn't even send a candle to the table. We were both too full after all that food- yes, $275 for two people- to order dessert but since the waitress said ""I know it is your sons birthday"" I assumed she would send out even the tiniest of things with a candle. Even a wafer with a candle stuck in it. I made sure her tip reflected this offensive disrespectful approach to customer service. I don't think I have ever left less than 20% tip but I did tonight.

3.0,9/25/2017,"I always pass by Tao to and from work and have always known of it as a posh, nice restaurant. My friends and I decided to go here for a friend's birthday. First and foremost, the space is beautiful. No doubt about it- it honestly felt like I was in a Rush Hour movie in those grand casino scenes (obviously a fan of Rush Hour movies haha) and who isn't a fan of high ceilings? There are parts of the venue that were just a tad too dark, but the ambiance overall was great.The staff are all very nice and were attentive to us, even when it's super busy on Saturdays. Be sure to make reservations, especially for the weekend nights! The food itself- I would recommend getting their sushi- the large option for their omakase. The fish is fresh and there's a lot that come with it. The cooked food was ok- we got the Mongolian Beef and Drunken Pad Thai- for the prices (I think $43 for the first, and possibly $38 for the latter?) I really did expect more. The beef didn't come in a large portion nor with rice, and the taste itself... I think the sauce was a bit too thick and ended up being a thick layer of sauce.Tao for me is one of those go there once to try kind of place.

1.0,9/24/2017,"First of all, I love Tao (the midtown one). I had very high hopes for this place after the AMAZING service we had at the Midtown Tao.This place was a DISASTER. A TOTAL DISASTER. We were seated yesterday on a Saturday night right by the Buddha and the wait table. I had my friends visiting me from Dubai, so I was very excited about taking them to Tao for a birthday celebration. My excitement was short lived.The front concierge table ladies were really nice and seated us on time, besides the fact that we were 15 mins late for our reservation, which I explained was due to the birthday cake delivery. Ok no worries, and they informed me about a $25 cake cutting fee, no problem.We had chicken lollipops and sizzling chicken for starters. The food was good, chilli chicken was sweet though. The fried rice was excellent.We had a particular gentleman who decided that it would be a good idea to ask us if he could clear the table after EVERY BITE WE ATE. He asked us at least 5-6 times while WE HAD FOOD ON OUR PLATES. Plate guy: ""Can I please take your plate now?"" Me: ""No thanks, still eating""5 mins later... Plate guy: ""Now can I take your plate?""Me: ""still eating""Another 5 mins later...Plate guy: ""May I take your plate?""Me: ""Actually Sir, I am not done eating, and I have to tell you, it is rather rude that you keep asking us again and again while there is still food on my plate""For the prices of food that I am paying, I would like to actually finish it off without being HARASSED. There were several empty tables around us, so WHY were we being pushed out? I wanted to order another cocktail, but sorry Tao, I will spend my $18 for a cocktail somewhere else.We paid $25 for a cake cutting fee, since we had a celebration. While the cake was brought out and candles were blown, i asked for a butter knife from a waiter. And he refused because he told us that they would cut the cake for us. So i informed him that we just want the butter knife for pictures, and guess what. He refused again. And promptly told me that my server will be over right away. When our nice server came back, she promptly gave us a butter knife and apologized for her colleagues behavior.

We ordered the tuna appetizer, the spring roll appetizer, the Mongolian beef an salmon entree, and the match creme brûlée and sorbet for desserts.First everything was AMAZING. The tuna app, the Mongolian beef, and the match creme brûlée were standouts. The tuna on crispy rice was just enough for an appetizer portion and very fresh. The Mongolian beer had a little bit of heat to it and was cooked to perfection. The waitress said the meat would be cooked well/and completely through but to my happiness it wasn't and came out a perfect medium rare. Lastly, the match creme brûlée was unique and delicious.

They don't open until 5 which I failed to pay attention to. It's huge inside, the decor makes you feel like your in another world. I have the spicy tuna, vegetable spring roll, and the Mongolian beef. Everything was delicious. The Mongolian beef was flavorful, it brought out a different sensation. The meat was tender and soft. I had the chocolate cake for dessert which paired perfectly with the ice cream. I would love to see what the club is like here.  Definitely will return.

2.0,8/16/2017,"I wanted to take my friend out for his belated birthday dinner and made a 7:30pm reservation in advance for this place.  I have eaten at their other locations in the past (Midtown and Meat Packing) and have had a pleasant experience and figured upscale Asian is perfect to choose this place.  I used Open Table to make my reservation and Tao requires you to make a reservation using your credit card, it would charge you if you cancel prior to 24 hours notice. I knew I was sticking to it so I did it.My friend arrived 5 minutes earlier than I and they told him to go to the bar to wait for me so that when I arrived we would be seated.  I arrived at 7:32 pm and they told me to go to the bar to wait and they will text me when my table was ready.  I asked how long and they said like a few minutes.  We sat at the bar and for 20 minutes we waited.  It was time they basically gave us to order one of the $19 cocktails on the drink menu.Which we did since we knew we were planning to drink anyway. Tactic - I know because I actually manage 3 restaurants on the back end.We were summoned by the hostess and some girl walked us (slowly) to the table where it is the type you have to pull out for someone to sit on the inside - the girl who walked us to the table threw the menus down and walked away so I pulled my own table out to get in.We ordered 5 glasses of wine / 2 appetizers / 2 entrees for our meal.Why did I give it a low rating? Because I ordered a sushi roll and I reviewed the ingredients on the rolls because i have an avocado allergy so it's easy to read the ingredients as they state if there is avocado on it.  I picked  Chef Yoshi roll which is $21.  What I got was salmon / tuna and avocado in a roll so small - it is equal to a $5 sushi roll you find at those Chinese people owned sushi restaurants all over NY.  I informed the waiter that I am unable to eat it and told him I had a food allergy - he said ""Well you didn't tell me you had an avocado allergy and salmon rolls always come with avocado"" - I told him no they don't and the ingredients are not listed. He asked ""what do you want me to do""? I told him to just give me a menu and I ordered another dish.Overall - our bill came out to $190 for Chicken Pad Thai / chicken gyoza / Black Fried Rice and Wagyu Beef yakitori. There were 5 glasses of wine.I waited not to write a review because I felt like it was not that bad - but to be fair - I work in hospitality and these are the points that Tao's staff need work on:1. My reservation was for 7:30 - if we show up on time and there is clearly available tables don't make me wait at a bar for time to buy a drink because I have to get home to family and that's why I set a time for a reservation2. If you have wannabe models / actresses as people walking you to the table - at least someone who knows how to walk in heels, walks with a bit of step and pulls the table out for me.3. My food allergy is my issue and I don't have to announce it to the world because it's not something I have to steer clear of lots of foods for.  But seriously Sushi handrolls do not automatically come with avocado - Japan can attest to that so the waiter was a jack ass for blaming for me not being able to eat an over hyped food item - saves me on spending  on avocado toast anyway.4. If you're going to be presenting mediocre asian food with over marked up prices - at least give the diner an experience they can enjoy with better staff.  I would be happy to spend $500 as long as the people were pleasant.",3,0,0,Jaime D.,"New York, NY",14,91,28

The restaurant had amazing decor and atmosphere but I wouldn't go to a place for the decor. As for the crowd most of the people and staff come into Tao with a stick in a certain orifice. I guess there's no check for that just coats. The one thing I did have that was really good was the dragon ribs they were quite good and a large portion for the price itself. The sake bombs also a cool drink to have with a group. Our waitress wasn't very knowledgeable of the menu and couldn't give recommendations because of her lack of knowledge.

3.0,8/1/2017,"Came here for restaurant week with a few friends. I was immediately blown away by the ambiance. The dim lighting and hip music made it feel like I was entering a night club rather than a restaurant. The restaurant week menu offered a 3 course meal for around $42. I selected the spicy tuna rice appetizer, Thai BBQ chicken entree, and matcha creme brulee dessert. In addition, we ordered the duck fried rice to share and I also ordered the 5 spice manhattan cocktail.The cocktail was good, served chilled without ice and I could really taste the alcohol. The tuna appetizer was alright, it had small bits of raw spicy tuna on top of rice that has been deep fried. The entree was great, the chicken was moist and flavorful. I didn't really enjoy the fried rice, I thought it was a little bland and I could hardly taste the duck. The matcha creme brulee dessert was amazing. Crispy on top with black berries and raspberries, and not too sweet. Overall, despite being an expensive meal, I enjoyed my experience here. The waiters were attentive, coming around to refill my glass with water and collect our plates when we were finished. The food was great, but not something I would go out of my way to come back for.

4.0,7/30/2017,"Visited Tao Downtown on a Sunday evening at around 5p.m. We were seated right away, and were given menus. After our waitress took our order, and took away our menus, another waitress approached her and wanted to hand us some small pieces of papers. However, our waitress whispered to the other waitress that this was unnecessary since we had already order. As the other waitress walked away, I quickly asked what those papers were, and our waitress told us that it was Restaurant week. I asked to see the restaurant week menu instead ( which we ended up ordering from because for only $41 per person we were able to get an appetizer, main course, and dessert each- definitely worth it) I just can't believe it that the waitress was avoiding giving us these menus, and clearly did not want the other waitress to give them to us either. What a shame. Additionally, our waitress was consistent with asking us about how our night was going, however; after clearing the table and seeing that our water glasses were empty, she did not think about refilling them. Instead, she cleared the table and never returned again, and we had to ask another waiter for some water. From what I know, water should constantly be refilled, and a customer's water glass should never be empty. But this wasn't the case at Tao. Once the food arrived it was all amazing, especially the dessert (green tea match creme brûlée and moist chocolate cake) Minus the few cons, I would definitely return here.

We were a group of six and we sat ourselves right away. We ordered the chocolate cake and the grasshopper cake. Both were delicious. The warm chocolate cake was covered with a square chocolate shell. It had caramel ice cream which I'm not a huge fan of but I loved the chocolate lava cake itself. The grasshopper cake was basically like mint mousse around layers of chocolate cookie. The mousse was a little minty for me and I wish the cake was more chocolatey. It also came with vanilla ice cream and some marshmallow with little chocolate balls which were all delicious accompaniments to the cake. The desserts were $14 each.

I've wanted to try this restaurant for a long time and unlike a lot of times when you hype something up in your head, it was better than I could have even hoped! Okay, where do I even start because between the beautiful ambience, the service, the DJ that was killing it on the turn tables (but not so loud that you couldn't have a decent table conversation. More like-hey, that's my Jam! Let me shimmy in my seat while I inhale these pork dumplings!), and the ridiculous food....okay, let me go ahead and talk about the food...we ordered so much that I'm sure I'm going to forget something but after my self induced food coma, here's what I recall:The pork dumplings and chicken pops were perfectly crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The vegetable springs rolls were both beautiful on the inside and very good!The sushi was amazing as well. The crispy sashimi tuna roll was one of my favorites. You literally could order anything and you won't be disappointed. As for entrees, gaaaaahhhhh, they were all scrumptious! The dish with the whole fried red snapper on the plate with the meat in the inside of it was so tasty! The spicy chicken was also very good. The sirloin was so tender and juicy-we could have ordered that over and over. Loved the chicken and shrimp fried rice, as well as the lo mein.I have to say the most impressive part of the experience visually are the desserts! It's hard to find that balance of being beautiful and tasting good at the same time but Tao achieved it! Some favorites were the giant fortune cookie with chocolate and vanilla cream on the inside, the creme brûlée, the orange and vanilla ice cream in a cone that tasted like a creamcicle, and the cheesecake.I didn't catch our severs name but the receipt says 'Bin W' so if anyone from the restaurant looks at Yelp reviews, he was awesome! Very patient with a large group and did a great job of explaining the dishes. I ordered the Lychee martini and after one sip did not like it and brought me something else out with no hesitation!

After a long first day of travel and sightseeing in NYC, my friend and I made reservations for Tao Downtown for dinner on a Wednesday night near the end of June, and it was the most amazing Asian restaurant I've ever been to, without exaggeration. The two of us ordered the following small plates to share over the course of a two-hour dinner:* Chicken Gyoza ($17)* Pork Potstickers ($18)* Satay Of Chilean Sea Bass ($23)* Barbecue Duck Fried Rice ($22)* Giant Fortune Cookie ($13)Of everything we had, the Sea Bass was the absolute best! We ended up ordering it twice before the dinner was over. As far as bang for your buck, (which is probably not what you're coming here for, but I'll include it anyway) the fried rice portion was the most economical menu option, and likely the other rice dishes are as well. We didn't even come close to finishing it since we got it close to the end of our time there, though it was absolutely delicious. The giant fortune cookie was ordered solely out of food envy. The couple next to us had it and though we were stuffed, we ordered it anyway because it looked so cool! Again, we didn't finish this either though both the cookie itself and the fruit surrounding it was very good. Both of us enjoyed reading the provocative fortunes... though neither panned out for us :)This is definitely a place I'd put on the must-visit list for anyone visiting in the nearby area. Seemed like a great place to see and be seen.

Instead of asking me how it was, he would come by and enthusiastically say ""oh my god, isn't it amazing?!""... not giving me a choice to be honest. Biggest waste of $50.

3.0,5/1/2017,"Three years later, I've come back and this place is undoubtedly as breathtaking and stunning as the first time I set foot into this place but much has changed, perhaps because I brought a larger party (of 12) or because I wasn't coming with someone who was related to someone working here. Nonetheless, my experience last night at TAO could not be compared to the first time I was here.I came to celebrate my birthday and had a reservation at 7:30pm for a party of 12. I will admit that I was late (8:00pm) and the entire party could not be seated until everyone was here. They were also not able to hold my reservation past 7:45 but luckily by 8pm, no body had taken my table yet. They also have high ceilings and do not allow balloons to be taken in.. which is understandable.They sat us at a round table near the giant buddha which I thought was very nice. Our waitress was very pleasant throughout the night but it was difficult to call for her when I needed her attention. The drinks here, for $19 a margarita, were disappointingly light. The food was spectacular, just as I remembered it to be years ago. However, the reason that I MUST update my review is because:I came here to host my birthday and another table had also come to host their birthday. My table had brought a cake while the other table had not, even though they had sparklers and a dessert platter (apparently you have to call in advance to reserve this.) After seeing that, I asked if I could have the same (willing to pay the price for this) and was told that I would have to call in advance for it, which I understood. However, 15 minutes later they told us that they had mistakenly given our cake to another table and would compensate us with a round of shots which I found to be very weak and a dessert platter that was mediocre. I know that people make mistakes, so I definitely would come back to TAO again.. though I doubt I will ever host an event here again. The food is honestly delicious, although $23 for a pad thai might be overpriced to some people. It was just unfortunate what happened and I felt how they handled the situation was disappointing as well.",10,3,5,Maggie Z.,"Middle Village, NY",878,301,731

Most of the food was too salty for me - I'm so grateful to our hosts since we were able to sample the spring rolls, Chilean sea bass, tuna over crispy rice, vegetable steamed dumplings, chicken wings, and sushi.  The sushi had a variety of different maki rolls & the yellowtail roll wasn't as fresh as the sashimi cuts I had in Tokyo.  Near the end of the night, they served us matcha-white chocolate covered strawberries, miniature assorted truffles, passion fruit mousse, mini fruit tarts, and mini brownies.  The passion fruit mousse was tart, sweet, and delicious! Drinks were very pricey, ranging from $14-$32.  The cocktails were a nice balance to the saltiness of the food because they were very sweet.  I enjoyed them the most!  There was a glass of rose champagne which I ordered and it was a lot drier than I thought.  It had a good amount of bubbles, but since I wasn't expecting it to be that dry - I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. I would love to join Tao another night to experience the music and dancing - perhaps another night, another day.

The very standoff hostess said that we would have to wait for our guests to arrive. Little did we know they had already checked in with the hostess but we weren't informed. Took us 15mins to realize that. Then the table was ready 45mins late. The hostess didn't care. She just said we'll get a text. No apology. When I raised the fact that they didn't inform us of the check-in issue they didn't apologize. Just told us that our table was ready. The place is practically a club. Not my thing but that's not my complaint. I knew that going there. The food is good but nothing special and it's expensive. The server was very nice though.

It is probably enough for 2-3 people and it's pretty pricey.   The waiter was very uninterested and only provided the value of taking our order. He didn't bother explaining the menu. Overall, I thought the food was really good and I would try it again.",0,0,0,Michelle C.,"Richmond, VA",107,19,8
3.0,4/9/2017,"I celebrated a birthday here last night and for the most part I was happy but there were some minor things I just cannot get over. First issue, when I called to make the reservation, one week in advance I made the reservation for 7 pm.  After confirming the reservation was at 7 I told all of the guests 7 PM. The day of the party (yesterday) the reservationist at Tao called to confirm that my reservation was at 6 pm. I kindly told her that I was certain my reservation was at 7 and wanted to know why it was changed.  In so many words she said to me, oh well this is the time you have to be here as we are fully committed for the night. I was very angry as I had a plan and other plans during the day that now had to be shuffled around to accomodate this restaurant. Since it was a birthday I let it go and decided to just rearrange my plans. Second issue, being that the reservation was moved by the restaurant not me, my party was running a little late.  Again, I called and said we are running a few minutes late and I was told ""we will only be holding your table for 15 minutes""  You would think that since they already put me out of my way, the least they could do was hold the table until we got there, but that was not the case. Aside from the above issues my experience was okay.  My server was very pleasant and informative she really did try to explain the menu to us and tell us the most popular dishes so that we would enjoy our meal- I like that she did that. The food was good, I enjoyed the lobster wontons and would have loved to just eat that as my entree.  The spicy chili chicken was AMAZING, we also tried the drunken noodles and lobster fried rice.  The noodles were great but the fried rice was too fishy for my taste, if you ate it with the cilantro it tasted better. Our food came out fairly quick as the restaurant was very busy, so service was not an issue. The drinks, yuck. I am sorry but every drink we tried was bad.  I don't think they add alcohol it tasted like straight juice.  We tried the berries and bubbly which for one I did not like the presentation, it should have been in a wine glass. Instead, it was in a regular drinking glass.  It tasted like club soda and a strawberry was added to the bottom- I was definitely NOT a fan. We also tried the ruby red dragon which tasted like perfume.  I had such a bad headache when I left from the bad drinks. I would recommend just having water and soda then heading elsewhere for an adult drink. Finally, when it was time to pay the check we just couldn't find anyone to bring it to us.  We waited 18 minutes for it to come then waited 14 minutes before they brought it back for us to sign.  It is really annoying sitting around waiting when all you want to do is leave. All in all,  the food was Okay, the ambience was beautiful, the service was good and the drinks weren't.  Would I go back? Yes, but I would definitely try the uptown location instead.",1,1,1,Evonna A.,"Queens Village, NY",36,253,44

3.0,4/2/2017,"I think I'd like to give this 3.5 stars, but i can't bring myself to give it 4 stars.We had reservations for a bachelorette party for 12 girls on a Saturday night. I know that's a lot of people, but they seemed to be able to handle it. We show up at 9 and they have to set out ""table up"" ...which literally meant put the top of the table on and assemble our table, then set it. Whatever, we're not in a rush.Okay, a couple gripes first off: they sat our large party pretty much in the middle of the aisle, right at the entrance, near the stairs; so ALL night, the bar crowd and people leaving were knocking into my chair, bumping into us, and (okay, one time) hitting me in the back of the head with her purse. The waitstaff did nothing to keep the aisle clear, or away from our table. We actually were yelled at by a waiter when trying to get up from the table to leave (I believe the patronizing words ""sweetie, I'm working here you need to move right now"" were sprinkled in there). We also had to ask numerous times for water refills, when EVERY single person was out of water. I understand this place is busy, and it's NYC, but when you pay $900+ for dinner, I assume these basic things are included in standard service.  The service was INCREDIBLY slow, we ended up leaving the restaurant at midnight (started at 9), and we didn't linger too long.  Personal gripe as well that it was WAY too dark, and WAY too loud, but that's more about the atmosphere that they represent- so I can't take issue with that as a 'problem'.The food itself was really good! We had a variety of things, ranging from pad Thai, salmon, sushi, and dumplings around the table. Everyone loved their food, including me! The drinks were fun and creative- and strong! It looks like a cool place to grab a drink on the steps and whisper intimately over the very loud music, but I definitely wouldn't recommend this place to a group (or anyone looking to interact with others).",1,1,0,Robin G.,"Princeton, NJ",1226,381,2328

Both the red & white wines were not great, which helps since I'm reducing my alcohol consumption. I left he party after a couple of hours.

Like 45 dollars with tip for two drinks expensive. But they were tasty! I tried two, I think one was made with mezcal and the other vodka based. Both unique and enjoyable, not out of this world. For dinner we totally over ordered which was strange because we both like to eat and the waiter assured us it wasn't too much food. We tried a specialty sushi roll, pork dumplings, veggie spring rolls, BBQ chicken, and lobster fried rice. I think our favorites were the pork dumplings and lobster fried rice. The portions are larger than you would imagine them to be, so we could have probably done without the giant veggie spring rolls. That being said it was fun to try a bunch of options and we somehow had room to try the DELICIOUS fortune cookie which you should NOT leave without trying. I'll never forget that cookie.

Just a hint of spice and ice cold(LADIES AND GENTLEMAN there is a bar in the restroom)Service: 4/5-although I asked twice for hot sauce and it never came... our waitress was always available throughout the night checking up on us. My opinion? Worth the one time try.. probably just for a drink or two ... not worth the prices.",3,0,0,Shadya N.,"New York, NY",25,132,208
4.0,1/31/2017,"Nice atmosphere, I love the decor. Really gorgeous. Pretty noisy though. Ordered off the restaraunt week 2017 menu. Which it looks like restauraunt week 2017 went up to 42 from the 38 dollars last year. Still worth it though. I got the Mongolian beef which is normally 43, so with restauraunt week I got that plus an app and dessert. The warm chocolate cake is gooey, chewy and melty. Everything you want it to be and not overally sweet. The caramel gelato is a good compliment to it. Mongolian beef is high quality, not chewy and sauce had a nice zing to it. Spring roll app was decent, stuffed with vegetables and tasted very fresh.Overall good experince. Our waiter was nice but I could tell was unhappy we didn't order any drinks or anything off the regular menu.",3,1,1,Marisa M.,"Suffern, NY",230,111,259
2.0,1/30/2017,"Tao Downtown is a ""chic"" and slickly decorated Asian fusion restaurant in Chelsea with a bar/lounge/restaurant/nightclub rolled into one. There's sensational mood lighting, and lots of people who look like their entire wardrobes are influenced by Conde Naste magazines. Yes, your humble correspondent was here. Look, stranger things have happened. (See my review of Everest in Chicago.) Moving on...The food at Tao was pretty phenomenal: we had the salmon tartare, radically overpriced sashimi plate, pork ribs, seaweed salad, and tuna. You also have to get the grasshopper dessert, which easily fed the 3 of us and is probably one of the best mint-chocolate chip things I've ever tasted.So why only 2 stars and not the vaunted #MerlinFive? The logistics of the place are sort of a nightmare on several counts. First, they mash tables way too closely together. Get ready to overhear that awkward OKCupid/Tinder date or look over your shoulder while eating sushi and wondering how a 4th person entered your party -- oh wait, that's not a 4th person, that's just somebody's chair from a mashed table. Second, service is unresponsive and appalling and sends an implicit message that reads something like: ""We're so awesomely decorated and trendy that experiencing our indifference is really a privilege."" We waited 20 minutes for someone to take our order, after being told a server was ""on the way"" like 3 times. This was at 5:45 PM.Third, the delivery system is bungled. One appetizer didn't come out, and nobody could figure out what we had ordered and what we hadn't. The people next to us were there way before and didn't get their food until much later.Fourth, you get told explicitly that it's time to go so they can pack more people into their pipeline. I guess on some level I admire the brazen explicitness of it. Other places that do this tend to do so in a passive-aggressive way. In the end, though, it's just off-puttingFifth, there is a giant buddha statue in the back. Cultural appropriation anyone?!? I kind of get it.As always, I urge readers to view this in sociological, structural terms and not to blame the staff itself. You can be as attentive as you want on an individual-level, but a bonkers structure can greatly impede your efficacy.In short, the actual experience of eating at this place can be summed up with the following equation: Quality of Experience = 1 / Quality of Decor   Yeah. It's that bad.",6,7,1,Merlin C.,"Manhattan, NY",274,608,74
4.0,1/29/2017,Let me start off by saying this place is great the ambiance is great !!!! The reasoning I took off one star is because we called to reserve a table and was placed on hold about a good 5 times but when we walked in we had the opportunity to sit at the lounge or the sushi bar . We opted for the lounge. Another reason for the one star removal was because when we first came in we were literally sitting for a good 15 minutes and no one acknowledged our presence. But our server was such a delight although she was waiting all the other tables she still made sure to check on us . The food is great and reasonably priced will def be back !!!

4.0,1/24/2017,"Came here for the 1st time for restaurant week. I took away one star because the restaurant week menu wasn't worth the price. It was a 3 course meal for $42 which came out to about $45 after tax. The appetizer was small and it didn't taste good. I forgot what it was but I didn't eat it.  I had salmon as my main course and it was just salmon with no sides. It had some sorta salad & pepper mix with it. It was edible and I just ate the salmon. For dessert I got the sherbet and berries that was really good but considering I only ate a piece of salmon, sherbet, and a few pieces of berries I would definitely say it wasn't worth paying $45 plus a $10 tip. If I could do it again I would have just ordered one main course from the regular menu.I didn't get any drinks because they were pricy. On average about $20 but I would try them next time.The look and Atmosphere of this place was amazing and for that reason I would definitely go again. The place is huge and is very intimate at the same time. I enjoyed the music that they played & the waitstaff is extremely friendly and efficient which is what I always look for.

They told us our table will be ready in a moment and to wait in the waiting area near the huge Buddha laying on his side or at the bar. We noticed it was pretty packed so we all automatically assumed it was going to take longer than a ""moment""..... 10 min pass, 20 min pass, 30 min pass, 40 min pass and we were not seated until and HOUR later. Keep in mind non of us ate anything and we were starving!! Ok finally seated and we already knew what we wanted. I get NYC is going to be pricy but damn some of the dishes werena little too over priced! I was expecting cold to be covered on my food!

The sashimi came with a hot pepper slice that added a nice spice. Mostly fish dishes, had a mouth-watering beef dish as well. Wait staff is professional and always seemed to be available when needed. This is a very large restaurant, and one keeps thinking that it will turn into a nightclub as the evening progresses. The music increases in volume as the night wears on, so if you want to talk, come early. The desserts are a must - but the fortunes in the cookie can be unnerving.

So we went to the bar - the cocktails are around $20 each. We had the margarita one, the strawberry one, and two others I forget. They are NOT strong and they are served in martini glasses or rocks glasses with way too much ice. We got the dumplings with were very good. The sushi/nigri was awesome, but very pricey for the amount ($7 for one salmon), the spicy chicken was pretty good. The pad thai was terrible and the service is not good. You're constantly having to flag down your waiter, and he has to scream over the table to get your order. I had a water and a beer at the table. They pour the beer and water into the same type of glass, so I had about a 1/3 of beer left and the water just just filled it up with water - come on dude pay attention! The ambiance and decor in this place is pretty cool if you're looking for a lively night downtown. Once you've been once, you've been enough.

We were a party of 7 reserved for 6 pm. 2 people were running late and the reception staff told rest 5 of us (who reached on time) to wait until every one shows up, which is ridiculous. After waiting for 20 minutes when the other 2 guests arrived we were told that since we are late we have to vacate the table by 8:30 and that too very rudely.  Further our wait staff was good although she literally was again trying to rush us to place orders. The whole table experience can be summarized as simply rushed into dining. I mean i understand that the place is good and everyone wants to come to your restaurant and you are incentivized on more diner turnover but for god sake train your employees to not make it obvious to the diners. The willingness of diners to come to your restaurant and pay the exuberant prices are centered around their experiences.

I sat at a table that felt like I was going to speed date. There were about 5 small tables lined up and very close to each other, like a bell was going to ring then you switch seats. Now there were other seats that were much better and also plenty of tables that were for parties of 5+. Now the food was excellent. You are given chop sticks unless you request otherwise. I had the shrimp temp, a fried fish dish I believe was bass, lobster ravioli, two beers and two cocktails. Again the food was excellent and the service was also very good. The waitress did a very good job recommending dishes. I was not looking at the menu as she recommended just went with her suggestions. The bill was $355 including tip, so be prepared to spend a little bit. As far as eye candy there was plenty but all hooked up so it is okay to take some sand to the beach in this case.

Don't forget that there is no cover charge in the restaurant, but the drink charges certainly make up for that...The food was quite good, nothing I would go to a hole in the wall place for, but in this environment everything seemed to taste even better!We began with the Lobster Dumplings, satay of Chilean Sea Bass with miso glaze (one of my favorites of the eve) and crispy rice tuna. All of which were spot on delicious. We also ordered some edamame which I usually order at most Japanese restaurants but half of my group said they don't eat edamame, but once it arrived EVERYONE was devouring them, not sure if it was the pure sea salt or just venue to get them to veer from their preconceived opinions of edamame, but we finished the dish in minutes...We also began with sake and cocktails, I loved my nigori sake, my wife loved her warmed sake, and a couple in our party fell in love with (seriously) their specialty margarita.Dinner was miso black cod (my other favorite of the meal) coconut shrimp, Tokyo style filet mignon coupled with BBQ duck fried rice and Shanghai fried rice.  The four of us finished everything we were served.For desserts wife and I chose a small selection of sushi and sashimi and our guests opted for to much famed (deservedly so) Bread Pudding doughnuts which were raved about.Our server was very attentive and friendly, an item I have seen several reviews complain about but our service was A+.Our table was in the ""waterfall"" section of the dining room, so maybe be got more dedicated service or just had a more professional server.  FWIW, out first visit a couple years ago also seated in the same wonderful section and we loved the view/show of the main dining section.Cost: I confess to selecting high cost sake, over 2/3 the cost of the 700 pre tax bill (4ppl), I was actually pleasantly surprised by the low cost of the meal (keep in mind each of the 5 margaritas were almost $20 each and worth every penny according to our guests).

Music is at the right volume (loud, but not screaming), tables are close to each other but it's not cramped, the Buddha is beautiful, and just the layout as you walk into the dining area is great. Now, that's about it for the good. Food - honestly I've had better at a Panda Express or my neighborhood average Asian place. Not exaggerating. There's just nothing that got us to say ""wow, this is great."" Or even ""good"" for that matter. All food was simply average at best, and that's being generous. As an example, the spicy chili chicken was virtually bland, the chicken was dry, and the taste didn't even cook through. Multiple bites were just plain, cooked chicken. The warm chocolate cake was the only bright spot, but it might have been just because we were so underwhelmed by the food. Service was below par. Servers were rushing around, talking loud to each other and showing stress, often disturbing our conversations. Our server was not helpful with menu questions. Didn't refill water unless we asked. Someone else delivered our food by just plonking it on our table and rushed off. Our server never even once asked how our meal was. And disappeared for long stretches at a time. He was also servicing the table next to us and made a big mistake (dietary request), and didn't seem to care too much (blamed it immediately on the kitchen).I get why this place is so expensive, it's wonderfully designed and provides an upscale, trendy dining experience right in the Meatpacking District. So I have no problem paying for it. However, the quality of the food and the service doesn't even near justify the price, not even close. Also, one item was charged $6 more than it was on the menu. I realized this after I came home and looked at the receipt. Oh well, add that to the poor experience.Probably will not return, nor will I recommend to anyone.

I'll never recommend this place or waste my money there . Employers need to be aware of what and who they hire. This is what gives them a bad name.

5.0,12/5/2016,"Really cool place! It is decorated so beautifully. I wanted to stop and look at every wall and piece of furniture just to take it all in. It's a big restaurant, very grand with high ceilings, fancy statues and art and a fountain... you get the point. The food was great! We over-ordered as usual after having a few drinks at the bar waiting for our table. For apps we had the fried dumplings, steamed dumplings, ribs, and sea bass skewers. All great. Sea bass skewers tiny portion but tasty. Entrees were even better. The crispy snapper was deep fried goodness. The chili chicken was amazing as well. Seafood pad Thai I couldn't stop eating and I'm not one to order noodles. There was nothing that I didn't enjoy. Just when I thought I would leave perfectly satisfied with a full belly it became very clear that I might have to unbutton my jeans at the table...yes...my BF ordered dessert. Did I say dessert. I meant 3 desserts. The mint cookie cake was a last minute add and it was so incredible I'm still thinking about it.

I felt like our waitress was hard to find and only came to the table to take the order (must order everything at once).

4.0,10/26/2016,"My wife and I came here to celebrate our one year anniversary and we both absolutely loved it. The atmosphere is what sets this place apart. The dimly-lit, giant hall with the giant Buddha projected with transformative shapes, colors, and patterns made you feel like you were in a trance the entire time. We got seated in a prime spot on the stairs overlooking the hall. From the moment we sat down to the moment we left, the service was impeccable. Honestly, I low key didn't really want to like the food because TAO seemed pretty hyped-up with the decor and part-nightclub vibe, making it feel slightly inauthentic but then I had the food and WOW. We got about 6 small dishes to share so I'll cut straight to my favourites:- Crispy Rice Tuna. I never wanted this dish to end. The textures--the crispiness of the rice and the delicate softness of the tuna--along with the mix of the spicy mayonnaise and kabayaki sauce balancing out each bite every time. SO good.- Dim Sum Dumpling Platter. Great for sharing, served in a variety of flavors including vegetable, chicken, and pork. The chicken dumpling was a tad bit bland but nothing that some soy sauce couldn't fix. All in all, this was probably my favorite dish due to the variety and although I'm no dumpling expert, this tasted like the dumplings I had when living in China.- Chinese Five Short Ribs. Not really a dish one would think to order here but I was craving it so why not. The portion was actually quite generous and I loved the hint of sweetness in the sauce. Probably one of the most underrated items on the menu. Overall, a great meal, but I'm not sure this is a place I would keep coming back to again and again.

Im guessing because it was a friday night but, the only thing that I was impressed by was the decor. That was beautiful. It was contemporary with an asian fusion. Anyhow, the food was mediocre, not quiet worth the money. Personally if I had to spend money on a nice place to eat, I would prefer somewhere else. I guess it is because of the fusion of food - Thai, Japanese, Chinese..etc that made it not specialized. As a foodie and an asian cuisine enthusiast, I thought Tao did a poor job at trying to balance the palette of asian food and american taste. I thought their menu was similar to Nobu's but nothing spectacular. Maybe it is because I am an expert at asian food. Overall, thanks for the experience Tao!",0,0,0,Megan D.,"New York, NY",199,24,61

They said they have sparklers for the dessert. It would been very nice. When my dessert came. Guess what????? No candle at all what so ever. (My friend even had her camera on record to see my excitement but it was just a disappointment. We called the waitress over.

4.0,9/15/2016,"First let me start by saying what an amazing atmosphere this place has. I mean really. The places decor, lighting, etc. is all just so great. You come into what seems like a long hallway and you're greeted by some hostess and then they escort you to the dining area and let's just say you're in for a treat the moment you lay your eyes on the set up. It almost reminded me of club Truth in Power( LOL). The decor and layout of the place alone was 5 stars for me! Now, to the food and the service and everything in between. I came here with a party of 7. Our bill ended up being about $330( NOT BAD AT ALL). Personally, I ordered the pad Thai chicken and it was great. Not the best I've ever had but it didn't disappoint at all. Some of the other people in my party had the sushi, duck, hot edamame,soup,fried rice, and honestly just a whole bunch of other stuff. I heard no complaints around the table except about the barbeque duck fried rice but with a little extra seasoning it was better. Drinks were ordered as well and you're looking at about $20 for a cocktail which is basically standard for New York City.Again, when I speak for the food I want to speak for the pad Thai that I ordered. Chicken pad Thai to be exact. I liked it a lot. It was very flavorful. The chicken wasn't dry and actually had just enough seasoning the way I like it. One thing about pad Thai is some people put way too much cashews but I didn't get that here. It was just enough for a good topping to make my food still enjoyable.The service? Now, the service was okay. Nothing so special where I felt like it was superb. The food actually took a long time to get to the table and we were starving so that might have been the only bad thing that I can think of about this place. Our waitress, Natasha was not only super pretty but she was extremely nice, patient and helpful with our table. She made sure that all of our needs were meet and she did keep coming over to ask how the food was.All in all, I would most certainly come back to this place.

4.0,8/25/2016,"Have... you ever wanted to marry the decor of a place? If I could I would marry this place in a heartbeat and make it the most succulent of dinners daily.Words cannot DESCRIBE just how gorgeous this restaurant is. From the outside, to the dimly lit hallway, to the large Buddha in the main dining area, to the intimate lounge area, to the bar with its fantastic illustrations of geisha women, to even the BATHROOM! Seriously, the bathroom is gorgeous. Atmosphere alone warrants five stars and beyond.I've known about Tao for some time now and I decided to go the day their Fortune Cookie dessert was plopped on my desk. Not even sure how that thing came into my possession that day, but after trying one bite I gave no care to my diet and melted into a lovely abyss of white and dark chocolate mousse. I will say that the dessert does not travel well and will melt, but its a little better when its a little softer!That aside, I've actually gone twice this week and the place is love. I can gush about the atmosphere all day, but food isn't bad at all. I treated myself to the Chicken Satay which was atop a small, but crispy and stringy salad of contrasting flavors. Fantastic combination of salty and sweet! Next, I had an order of pot stickers which weren't bad, but not nearly as tasty as the chicken. I would chalk it up to the sauce they're topped with which overpowers the pork. It seemed unnecessary. Also when it comes to dumplings, I have an eternal soft spot for Tasty Dumpling in Chinatown that will never be beat by anything lol. I got both the TAO-tini and Lychee Martini, I did ask the bartender for her recommendations and they were spot on. I wasn't big on either (the TAO-tini has odd flavor profiles and the Lychee Martini had a little too much lychee), but they were well made. Did I mention that the bartender on duty was a SWEETHEART??? Lindsey was fantastic and just made my experience even better! Easy to talk to, efficient with making drinks, and knows what's on the menu. People like her are why I sit at the bar. I topped my night with, unsurprisingly, the giant fortune cookie and, also unsurprisingly, it was so worth it. I don't particularly care for fortune cookies, but that dessert is simply the upper echelon of fortune cookies. During my second experience I took some friends and got the Ruby Red Dragon which is the most tasty grapefruit drink ever conceived (and my new go to!) and my friend got the Shanghai Fried Rice which not only tasted pretty good but had the nicest presentation I've ever seen for a rice dish! If you're a rice lover, get it! We sat in the lounge area and had a server who was patient with our indecisiveness and very on top of our orders.Now, as it has been said, Tao is pricey. But the experience here is something memorable and worthwhile. I've had such an amazing time that I simply feel like I need to take EVERYONE I KNOW HERE. So trendy, so sexy, and so unique!

The music was great and the overall vibe was awesome. Only thing I absolutely hate is that they are EXTREMELY strict when it comes to timing and large parties. My reservation was at 7:30 and most of my friends slowly trickled in around 7:45ish. The hostess told me that I needed to be up and done with my meal by 9:45 because they needed my table... I hated feeling rushed like that, but I guess it was because I was in a big party.Ive been here twice, and will continue to come back for any occasion!

The atmosphere is amazing but if your looking to go out for a nice intimate conversation, I wouldn't come here .. It is definitely something you have to try one ..The sushi is AMAZING but again overpriced .. One smoked salmon roll was $13, but again you are paying for the atmosphere and location..

4.0,8/16/2016,"To preface, we came in EARLY on a Sunday to have drinks and appetizers. We escaped for a couple of hours without the kids and I am glad we did. I felt bad because I was dressed in basketball shorts and a graphic tee. At the time we arrived there was no fuss.I immediately made a BEE-LINE for the restroom as soon as we entered this establishment. It was SWELTERING outside and I needed to freshen up. As I walked down the stairs the décor and ambiance had me in awe. Seriously, I almost felt like my bald head grew a long man-bun and my attire morphed to that of a Samurai Warrior. This place is a sight to see.....no doubt. The wood, the columns, the artwork and the mood lighting provide an inviting atmosphere. When I found our party in the lounge they were seated at a long sofa/loveseat facing the bar. Man, could it get ANY better? I guess if the drinks and food were free right? They were not. (Frown)My brother-in-law is a local and he frequents Tao from time to time. He ordered our apps and they were all DELISH!! HOT Edamame, Chicken Satay, Crispy Rice Tuna & the Pork Potstickers. Combined with the Cuba Libre' drinks I was ingesting? YUM!! My brother by marriage SWEARS by the Rock Shrimp Lettuce Cups but they had been out for two days. Bummer!!The service was adequate but the allure here is the vibe. I can't wait to return for a special meal here. There are some bitchin' circular tables tucked in against the walls. Then again if you have a large group there are exclusive choices on a loft overlooking the restaurant.   It is a bit pricey but nothing different from many of the eateries we have dropped into. AT LEAST come in for drinks and a walk around the interior. It is so cool.

However, this Downtown Tao location felt like a nightmare. We made reservations days in advanced and when we arrived for dinner they stated ""they couldn't find our reservation."" Now we all know things happen, but on top of losing our reservation, they were extremely rude and unaccommodating. The rudeness and lack of suitable service was evident in the hosts, waiters, and even the manager (Will). For the mistake to be their fault and then top with rudeness is not acceptable.

4.0,8/10/2016,"Alright TAO I SEE YOU, this review is for dinner. This ambiance, is sick, as in so unusually cool. I had severely low expectations for this place, because come on celebrities come here, it must be overly hyped. But walking down the stairs after checking in with the hostess, there are tables along the stairs that cascade down to lead you to this enormous dining space. Then you have the soundtrack to this epic entrance, the DJ was playing some really good, chill, mixes, mostly John Legend, but I dug the 90's inspired hip hop that was co-mingling with our John Legend. So we sit down order every single cocktail imaginable, and let the alcohol flow! Each cocktail is roughly $16 dollars, and let me tell you they packed a punch...if you're a lightweight beware! So I'm having a hard time regarding what I ordered but these were the things that I genuinely liked: Roasted Shishito Peppers with Yuzu 11Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice 21Rock Shrimp Lettuce Cups 22Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables 42Some kind of sushi (that I can't recall, but remember ordering 2 orders of it) But onto the real madness: The Dessert...TOWER...I don't know what kind of sorcery was used to create this magical dessert tower, but this is any girl's dream. Literally, I didn't know that I needed this in my life, and that it needed to be topped with a giant fortune cookie. Btw, thanks for ruining the crappy fortune cookies I get at normal Chinese restaurants..nothing will ever be the same. THANKS TAO. So imagine a dessert tower that is delivered to you on fire, or maybe I just remember in my mind they lit the top, and imagine like several layers of desserts all through this playhouse, it literally reminded me of a barbie treehouse if and someone places random desserts on each level. It was MAGICAL, and it all tasted so good........I do remember it costing like $60 dollars, I might be wrong, but it did cost a lot, but if you have a large party this is a showstopper, and you have to get it. TAO, you got me, you got me good, I gotta give you 4 stars just for the chilean sea bass and this tower of happiness, rainbows, and love.

3.0,8/8/2016,"I made reservations for this restaurant as they participated in restaurant week for 6PM. Initially it was a bit difficult finding the entrance on the main avenue as it was downstairs and behind big black doors. Once we entered the establishment the décor and ambiance is absolutely breathtaking. They will only sit you one your entire party has arrived which allowed us to take in the atmosphere. Since my party and I were having an early dinner I expected a more attentive staff, we found it disappointing to keep flagging down or waiter for a refill on our water, cocktails and to place our order. I found my food to be delicious; spring rolls, Mongolian beef and a chocolate cake. The dessert was by far the star of all four courses! The restaurant is very pricy but this was expected, our $300 bill even during restaurant week was no surprise - the drinks add up.

3.0,8/3/2016,"Visited Tao Downtown last evening for restaurant week with a friend. At first I was struck with the quirky beauty of the place. The hostesses ware lovely and allowed us to have a drink on one of the lounges in spite of the fact that we were there on time for our reservation. Very pleasant. The first course was wonderful--I had the spring rolls and they had lots of flavor. For the second course my friend's dish came out twenty minutes before mine did, with no explanation on the part of the waiter (Marcus, I think.) When I finally was able to grab him he simply said the two dishes came from separate kitchens and mine wasn't ready yet. No apology or anything. If he had offered us another round of drinks on the house--or anything--I would have felt better. The sushi was just okay--nothing that merited such a long wait. By the time my dinner came out, my friend had already finished hers.When the check came everything was itemized and it seemed like it came to more than the restaurant week price. We had drinks so it was hard to tell. Our waiter was nowhere to be found, although we kept asking for him. Finally we just paid the check and went. Food was okay, service poor.

Barely knew anything about menu. I had to ask for another Coke. Then we ordered a beef dish, we asked if it came with rice she said, ""no"" and that's fine I asked can we get an order please. My husband had to ask twice for water. We had our food which may I say was exceptional. We had left overs and asked if we can take them to go. The guy that was helping our waitress clean up ask if we wanted all of it to go. I said yes there were 2 rice bowls for some reason I told him can u take both and you can put it in one container it's fine. He gave me a dirty look saying, ""you want this too?!"" I said yes! We then ordered dessert. It was great. My husband said he had to run to the bathroom I said ok. Fine. After our dessert was done my husband came back confused but I didn't know why. 2 minutes after a large fur tone cookie dessert came. I'm like oh wow! Yes it was my birthday. I said but we just had dessert.... Then some manager came up to us to my surprise and apologized and said the second dessert was on him. I was already beyond full. So we took it to go. Our bill came thereafter, we got charger for 2 rices he told the waitress we only wanted one she said oh I'll just take it off....  After having only 1 glass of wine our bill should have not been that much we didn't order any seafood.

If you make a reservation in advance, I absolutely recommend requesting staircase seating because it is wonderful, especially for a date night.The Pan-Asian menu is excellent. My friend and I ordered a few different small dishes as well as sushi and everything was great. They brought everything out at once, which was kind of annoying. I wish I would of asked them to pace the dishes out because some dishes got cold before we finished eating the others. During dinner the service was great. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly up until like 12:15am when we asked for the bill. Our total ""checkout time"" took 30 minutes, which is way to long in my opinion.

The decor  and the layout is lovely. The giant Quan Yin Buddha in the main dining room , the painted geishas in the entrance hallway and the laying lounge statue are the most memorable decorI was quite pleased with my experience this evening. It was a Sunday night and it was less crowded than I have ever experienced it ( maybe because it was summer and it was pride that day) . In the past- it would be way too crowded and way too loud for my taste- to the point you could hardly hear what your company is saying. We were seated  promptly and greeted with our waitress who was friendly and efficient.The prices are OVERPRICED but it's NYC and meatpacking district . $15 cocktails, $20 appetizers, $30-50 entrees, $10-15 desserts. Know this this ahead of time. The bill for the two of us came to $300 easily with tip. Cocktail- I love the Lychee martini. So delish - I had three. My friend had the Tao-Tini which was a sweet drink but good as well.Apps- EVERYONE knows that you should try the CHILEAN SEA BASS here. It is DELISH. I remember it being a main course but it was not offered on the menu this evening . We also tried the Lobster Egg Rolls which were ok/good My friend had the Seafood Fried Rice which she loved and it was enough to doggy bag it. I had the Lobster Three Way which was good but not that good for $50. Lol. It came with lobster teriyaki, lobster ""dynamite"" which tasted like a spicy Mayo and lobster bake , and lobster  and avocado tempura . Dessert - I surprised my friend with the jumbo fortune cookie that they put happy bday on it. It's $15 and it's not necessarily the most delish dessert but it has a great presentation and fun for the table to share. It comes with jumbo fortunes for everyone. One side comes with a vanilla side cannoli/mouse and the other with the chocolate version.

After letting the hostess know, she did nothing about it - which is fine but she could have tried.After eating appetizers, they cleared our plates, but didn't give us clean cutlery. For a relatively expensive meal, the least you can expect is a fresh fork and spoon. The managers all huddle in a corner, even though their only job is to hover around tables making sure everything is okay. My husband actually had to get up to speak with one of them.Just poor poor service. Not worth it, specially after giving it a second try. All a facade!

2.0,6/22/2016,This is my third time going to Tao (first time going to this location) and I have to say every time I go the food gets more disappointing. How can a restaurant like this not have the most common basic dish (Phad Thai) done right it is beyond me!The decor is amazing but that is where it all goes down hill. I understand the atmosphere is meant to be more of a club type setting but the music was deafening to the point that it is not easy to have a conversation.

My boyfriend worked an event there and you'd never even guess it. The rudeness from the promoters/managers/whoever they are- was absolutely infuriating. He's played all over NYC and we have never seen a staff so god awful before. They wouldn't let us in the lounge early so we sat at the bar and ordered HUNDREDS of dollars worth of food and drinks. The waitress brushed us off after we gave our drink order even though we were ready to place our food order as well. I've worked in restaurants for years and I'm pretty sure if a customer is ready to place their order- you write it down and take it. She gave us an attitude as if we were stupid for trying to place our food and drink order at the same time and I was absolutely baffled. Another waitress heard me saying how rude it was and wound up coming over to take our order considering my boyfriends DJ set was coming up shortly. When it was time for their set, the security staff gave us a problem going from the dining room into the club room, even when they told them time and time again that they were working the event. The manager had the audacity to come up and threaten to kick me out when he heard me complaining about the shit job they were doing and how awfully we were being treated.

2.0,4/5/2016,"The food here is hands down AMAZING -- I probably would deal with the rest of the BS just because I enjoyed it so much -- and that is the only reason I am giving two stars. I took a group of clients here for dinner. As soon as we checked in the person at the front desk told us there was a two hour limit on the table -- immediately this turned me off (knowing we were going to order every course, and lots of alcohol) I did not want us to feel rushed, though we were. The waiter was not very good-- didn't seem to really know the menu and wasn't fond of making suggestions to us. He also seemed to want to rush every single course. Once we were kicked out of our table (still finishing our drinks and dessert) they advised that we had to go stand at the bar (????????) when I complained and asked for a table in the bar area so we could finish they advised we should have asked for a reservation in the bar when checking in. WHY wouldn't you tell us this when we checked in??? It was just confusing -- seemed like they could care less about us. The people working there were super rude. One of the bouncers actually got in to a verbal altercation with my client over sitting at a table (that was empty for 10+ minutes). Anyways, just terrible vibe, bad customer service. Only go here if you are just interested in spending a lot of money (for good food --so worth it on that end) and getting treated like shit. Booooo --- sad about this because if the experience was better I would continue to bring clients here.",7,3,0,Heather M.,"New York, NY",9,16,4

I had 2 rounds of the Pama Sutra...amazing drink and 1 round of the Ruby Red Dragon. For appetizers, we ordered the Chef Yoshi and lobster rolls. I'm not fond of the Yoshi roll...not a fan of salmon and tuna. The lobster roll was good. Needed more lobster though. The main courses consisted of my plate, Seafood Black rice. 5+ stars is not enough to describe of how awesome this entree was. He had the Shanghai fried rice. The look on his face when it came to the table was priceless (won't spoil it for anyone if you haven't tried it). But he was pleasantly surprised. Overrall, this is a great place to go for dinner.

3.0,3/27/2016,"Visited the restaurant yesterday with frieds.  To be quite honest it was a culinary disappointment.  I mean for the expectations i had after visiting Tao on 58th some time ago I was expecting better.  But let's start from the beginning.  We've arrived late(our fault) but we were still seated though advised that we may not be able to enjoy ourselves as long, but that's OK.  We were expecting that.We've ordered appetizers, short and spare ribs and lamb chops.  Of that lamb chops were exquisite, spare ribs were good, and short ribs were really disappointingly bad.  OK. The Ruby red dragon had made up for the appetizers.  Now came the main courses.  The 16 ounce sirloin, the Halibut with Shrimp and branzino,  I don't know about the branzino, but in the halibut dish the best parts were shrimp and coconut-pineapple sauce.  Sirloin was good juice and done to perfection.Overall I would say that as a restaurant it is a disappointment and a disgrace to the New York restaurant fraternity.  I think they should convert it to a straight up lounge or a night club.",2,1,0,Mikhail V.,"East Stroudsburg, PA",39,373,270

I love the fact that the place feels spacious, airy, not too dark and not too noisy (was a weekday night). Our waiter was friendly and attentive but the food was pretty bad. Almost all the dishes had too much soy sauce and sugar. Hence, the food tasted salty and sweet but bland. For appetizer, we got spicy Szechuan Dumplings (not spicy, too much soy sauce; frozen dumplings from store taste better), Satay of Chilean Sea Bass (decent but a bit too sweet), crispy crab sushi roll (decent but not enough crab). For entrée, we shared Chinese Five Spice Short Ribs (terrible!! tasteless meat swimming in soy sauce), Beef Mongolian (another sub-average dish; PF Chang's Mongolian beef is much better), Shanghai Fried Rice (let's just say I can easily make a much much better fried rice with just some leftover meat and veggies so paying $21 for this dish is definitely not worth it) and a special sole fish dish (fish balls were covered in too much gooey brown sauce and the dish cost $60; any $20 fish dish from a Chinese restaurant taste better than this). The best dish was probably the dessert, giant fortune cookie! Presentation was impressive and thank god it wasn't swimming in soy sauce!

No wine yet. 10 minutes passed before I was able to get anyone's attention regarding the wine. Wine finally arrived and it's not cold. Finished eating appetizers cold bottle of wine arrives. Our entrees arrived and I must say I was not very impressed. I love the food at Tao on 58 street and I was very disappointed that the they didn't serve the same dishes or some of the same dishes.

You have to go in with the expectations that this is a HUGE restaurant that will make you wait 45 minutes for your table even with a reservation, will be super loud at all times, will be busy as all hell even on a Monday at 5pm (or 11pm for that matter), the service will not be great, and the food won't be that great either. But who goes to Tao for the food or great service? If you want great food and great service, go to a different type of venue (like 11 Madison Park).Come to Tao if you want to P-a-r-t-y (with a capital p). You will not find another venue in NYC that can be busy at every waking moment of open hours and have a constant scene. Yes, maybe there can be a weird crowd here and there, but who cares? It's a restaurant known for it's chic decor and scene.Food:+ Lobster wontons (best thing on the menu)+ Crispy rice tuna+ Filet mignon Tokyo style- Lo mien (bland and tasteless)I've tried several things on the menu and those items are definitely worth mentioning (good and bad).The bar is always busy and while the drinks are overly sugary, they are very tasty. My favorite is the Taotini or the lychee martini.This place is great for Birthday's, out-of-towners, large group dinners, a fun night on the town, client dinners, you name it!I definitely opened my mind to this place as I set my expectations where they should be and then I really started enjoying myself.

I find that the small plates and appetizers taste better than the entrees. Definitely try the chicken lollipops and the sea bass skewers. Both appetizers are delicious. The sushi is very good also. I tried the smoked salmon and the crunchy lobster, and both were very tasty. Stay away from the crunchy crab (don't remember the name), it wasn't that good. The red dragon drink is delicious. Another must try. If you like grapefruit, you will love that drink.The service is okay. If you sit at a table the service will be good.

4.0,2/7/2016,"I have been to Tao Downtown a few times for drinks, appetizers and private events. My co worker wanted to dine here for restaurant week and so we did on the last day of restaurant week which was this past Friday night. We had a 6:15 reservation which we ended up being late for due to issues with Uber (we called for two cars neither which showed up- that's another story in itself). I knew we were past the late ""grace"" period and was worried we would lose our reservation all together especially being a Friday night. However, the host was very accommodating and told us we could sit in the lounge immediately and have a full dinner or wait about 45 min to an hour for a regular table. We decided to wait for a table. I have had appetizers in the lounge before but I didn't want to have to lean over a cocktail table to eat my meal. We were not in a rush. Exactly 1 hour later our table was ready. I have to say the restaurant week menu is a great value. I ordered the Chilean Seabass appetizer which was delicious! I'm surprised to see other reviews that the portion was small! This is an appetizer, not a main course. You get two skewers of fish. Both are very generous portions. I had the Mongolian beef for the main course which was very good. If you like spicy then order this! However it was not overly spicy in my opinion. To finish off I chose the warm chocolate cake with salted caramel gelato. Chocolate cake=Heaven!!! Delicious! The salted caramel gelato was good, I just felt it was a bit too salty for my taste. I do love a little sea salt in my deserts, I just wish this was a bit more subtle. However, it was not a deal breaker. Did I mention how good the warm chocolate cake was? We also ordered sautéed Bok Choy and Lo Mein for the table. The Bok Choy was delicious and our server forgot about our Lo Mein. Not a deal breaker because the food was plentiful and I don't think we would have had room for the Lo Mein. All in all our dinner was very good. Drinks are quite expensive here so we switched up to white wine at dinner which is a bit more affordable ($12 a drink vs. $17).

3.0,2/2/2016,"Okay. I have a love hate relationship with Tao. I love the food. The staff is mediocre. And I absolutely hate the way they cram everybody together. My husband and I are always stuck at a two top in which we have to literally move our table out of the way to sit down so our asses aren't in other people's faces as we try to get into our table. Literally there is 5-6 inches between your table and the next persons table. Forget about using the restroom because once you're in you're in for life. You are constantly getting bumped by the staff, by passerbys, by the people next to you. I can't understand for the life of me why a restaurant would do this to the customers. It is so hard to have a conversation not only because of the loud music but also because you're touching elbows with the table next to you. It's super uncomfortable. I understand they are always busy but come on. Be a little generous to your customers with the space already.",0,0,0,Allison B.,"Union Square, San Francisco, CA",5,38,26

3.0,2/1/2016,Decided to try the downtown location to catch up with a girlfriend for dinner. The ambiance is beautiful. I actually like this location setup better than the uptown location. We ordered from the restaurant week menu. The satay Chilean Seabass was delicious! The previous reviews were right about that. My friend had the shrimp pad Thai for her entree which she enjoyed. I had the bbq chicken which I didn't really care for. Wish I also ordered the pad Thai. For dessert I had the grasshopper cake which was also delicious. The reasons for me only giving it three stars is because I didn't like my entree as well as I didn't like that I had to order a side separately. My patron pomegranate margarita had no patron in it. But more importantly when I got home I had a horrible stomach ache. I'll be throwing out my leftovers.,0,0,0,M W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,12,32

4.0,1/30/2016,I'll start from the beginning.  Upon entering there's a coat check which is nice. Once seated we were greeted promptly and the service was consistent throughout the meal. The seating was tight and I could hear my neighbors conversation which I hate. I would expect a bit more room and privacy as this place isn't cheap. At the advice of someone here I ordered the mango chili martini which was terrible! Seriously! $17 for a 2oz drink that tasted peppery as hell! Skip it! The Chilean sea bass appetizer while small is tasty. For  my entree I had the Mongolian beef with comes on a small bed of string beans. I ordered a side of white rice. I don't eat a lot at once so about half way through I was full. The to go bags are pretty nice and I had lunch the next day. For dessert I had the chocolate cake With salted caramel ice cream. It was fantastic!!! I was stuffed but it was so good I finished it. My friend had the Shanghai fried rice which I found a bit dry/undercooked and chewy but he loved it. Overall I think it's a bit overpriced but the ambiance is very nice and I did enjoy my meal. I would return again.,1,0,0,Sherene M.,"Queens, NY",187,132,388

The pad Thai was so good and they didn't cheap you out on the shrimp! I started off with the vegetable spring rolls which were delicious, the vegetables were seasoned perfectly.

5.0,1/28/2016,"A few friends and I decided to heck it out for restaurant week. Coordinating an evening that works for everyone- check! Online reservations through open table- check! Trudged through the leftover remnants of one of the largest snow storms in NYC history- check! Ok, Tao downtown is huge and hip. Definitely the place you want to go to with a big group, ladies night out or maybe even a sexy date (though it can get pretty loud). It's a place to see or be seen. Dark lights, loud music with dj, sexy couches, great waitstaff and a random 2 level statue in the front and pricey cocktails! Note- If you'd like to drink MGD on a 2 for 1 happy hour special while wearing your flip flops, this is not the place for you. I have no idea what the dj's name is, but I love him! He really went in on the 90s hits. I was snapping my fingers continuously at the table- for real! And this was a Wednesday night. Onto the food. The menu is just as you'd expect- Asian fusion with a large selection of sushi. We were there for the prix fix meal which unlike  that of many other restaurant week participants, actually offered several options. Appetizer- satay of Chilean sea bass on a bed of seaweed(?). Wow! I wanted to lick the plate. It was so full of flavor. I would go back right now, just for that. Onto my entree. I got the Mongolian beef. It was decent, but honestly after exposing my mouth to the Chilean sea bass, it was impossible to top it. Perhaps if I had this on its own it would have been impressive, but it kinda stopped at just ok for me. Dessert- chocolate cake that came with ice cream. This was really rich. If you love chocolate, you will love it. I typically don't have much of a sweet tooth but I could make an exception for this from time to time if I needed to. The only aspect I wasn't much a fan of was the darkness of the bathrooms. I guess it's for the sexy factor, but I'm not a fan of trying to figure out which stalls are occupied while walking through a dark hall.

The fish was nice and tender and didn't have a fishy aftertaste. It comes with this sweet sauce on it, almost like a teriyaki glaze. Main-Thai BBQ ChickenThough the chicken was nice and moist and tender, I felt as though their sides and the seasoning on the chicken was too much.Dessert-Warm Chocolate CakeThe cake itself was good but the ice cream that compliments it was a salted caramel ice cream. And I honestly was not feeling it. I could barely taste the caramel in it. I would have much preferred a simple vanilla ice cream to go along with it.

The atmosphere was great - really buzzing and full despite being reasonably early. We were seated right away at one of the tables on the steps facing the main dining area. It was a great view and would have been perfect for drinks and appetizers but not super comfortable for eating a full meal. I had the Chilean seabass appetizer - get it! It was delicious and a generous portion, I wouldn't mind paying full price for that. Also really enjoyed the Mongolian beef main, and the chocolate cake (with hot center) and salted caramel ice-cream also went down very well. We had lychee martinis which were over-sweet (too sugary and juice-like) which was a shame. Other than that everything was tasty. The service was good and drinks came out very quickly. One down side was that the main came out immediately after the appetizers were cleared away, we would have liked a bit more breathing room. We asked for a bigger gap before dessert and they obliged.

4.0,1/20/2016,"Came here this past Monday for dinner during restaurant week. The decor and layout of the restaurant is beautiful. For appetizers we had the hot and sour soup and the Chilean sea bass satay. The soup is spicy, not as sour as you'd think, with pieces of tofu, I enjoyed it. The Chilean sea bass was delicious, soft and very flavorful. For the main course I had the Mongolian beef and the boyfriend had the chicken pad thai. The Mongolian beef definitely has a kick to it, not overwhelming but still a kick. The meat was very tender and soft, and yummy. Thankfully I had a delicious Tao-tini to put out the fire in my mouth afterwards. The pad thai was good too. For dessert we had the warm chocolate cake and the grasshopper layer cake. I loved both. The chocolate cake was baked to perfection, hard on the outside but inside was a delicious lava of melted chocolate, yum! The grasshopper cake is almost like a smore really, and it was soo good!

3.0,1/19/2016,"If there's one thing Tao does well, it's create a grandiose, breathtaking setting, so well that you almost forget you're paying $17 dollars for a cocktail and $30 for mediocre Asian fusion. The main dining hall is huge, recessed down a grand flight of stairs and under a giant statue lit up with projection lights. There are intimate smaller tables for two or three people lining the staircase down that look like they would be a great place for a date. The dark ambiance and huge ceiling is pretty stunning after the usual cramped Manhattan everything. Even the entrance is pretty grand - you walk down steps through a dark decorated tunnel before opening to a huge atrium. Food is Asian fusion and pretty meh - they have some weird stuff (tuna sashimi and parmesan??) as well as inexplicably overpriced Asian fare ($22 for a plate of greasy chow mein??). The crowd is also a little perplexing - for a place that looks so upscale and ritzy, there was a crowd of kids having a 10 year old birthday celebration next to us right next to what looked and sounded like a very inebriated bachelorette party. Service is great. Standout was the drinks, which were delicious and well mixed - but quite overpriced at $17 a pop. I think Tao is a fun place to check out, especially for the ambiance and the stunning architecture, but I really wouldn't recommend forking out for an actual full dinner here.",3,2,1,Pam C.,"Chicago, IL",870,741,1088

Food was very good for being a club principally (as I understand it?) and the music was top 40 remixes. I loved the balcony that hangs over the lower room. The bars mix decent drinks and the staff was courteous. Only hiccup was coat check which lost my scarf. The person who had taken my scarf was still there. Initially the staff was convinced I didn't bring one, but the person who helped me stepped up and took responsibility. I was so pleased. I know coat check at a big place like this must be difficult so I felt happy I wasn't brushed off. This place can be intimate and it can be big party fun.

I looked on yelp for reviews of different foods (since everything looks so good).Very chic and beautiful looking restaurant. When you walk it, you're led down a hall that eventually will lead you to a) the reservation area, b) the bar. I was reccomended the Tao-tini. I'm not a fan of martinis, so if you arent a fan either, go with this. Why go with your basic vodka cran when you have a slew of trendy one of a kind drinks to choose from?The bathrooms are dark and trendy. With a bar in the middle of both the men and womens bathroom. My reservation was for 7pm for 10 people. They wont seat you until everyone is there, but 1 person was running 30 mins late. They sat us anyway. We had a huge round table up a few steps in the back, or front of the restaurant, how ever you want to see this as. Right next to the huge buddha in the little pond. We felt special, overlooking the entire packed out place. In the middle of the table they had a spinning round board so you are able to share plates and just spin it around to the other person instead of reaching over the table.We all ordered several drinks each, appitizers either to share or individually, and an entree each. Like i mentioned, I looked on their website and yelp for reviews of the dishes as well as what looked appealing to me the most. I saw a lot of reviews on the Seabass Skewers and Seafood Black Rice. UM .... AMAZEBALLS. seriously. The skewers very rich in taste with a smooth buttery(?) taste, when you go to bite it, no need to. Its so soft, just melts in your mouth. Seriously wish there was more than 2.The Seafood Black Rice, even though I have no idea why I didnt finish it, SO GOOD! it had a little, slight, spice to it. We were able to get a hook up for free shots and my desert platter. Which I knew by all the reviews I HAD to get the Fortune Cookie. Well we got a sample plate of ALL deserts including the fortune cookie .. so I was very pleased to say the least. And theres a fortune for each person at your table. All the fortunes have a cute/dark/passionate/love type of fortune to go with it. Pretty cute. All in all, LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Yes, its on the expensive side. Yes, food is great. Yes, good date night. Fortuantely I didnt have to pay. For NYC holiday season, on a Saturday night, for 10 people, $846 is actually not bad. Would definitely come back.",3,0,0,Jessica L.,"Brooklyn, NY",14,60,133

Just walking into this place is a excursion of its own....I can not explain the decor,  it is a multi level seating to say the least.....so many nooks and crannies and cool places to eat.....not a bad seat in the house the music was bumping that at first I thought I was not going to like....but it quickly grew on me.....and we were not even in the club section of the place. Ordered several apps, like the dimsum sampler type of thing that came with 3 different dipping sauces totally awesome,  and the Chilean Sea Bass was to die for...and something else,  but I forget what it was....but that was also gone in 2 Seconds. For the mains....we did the roast pork Lomein.....it was pretty good, the bbq chicken....was very good, bock choy was j us ok.....but what can you really do with it......but I ate it, (chief of staff said I had to have greens) just sitting there watching the amazing dishes fly buy for other tables.....was awsome in its self. Next time I need to go with a crowd.....so I can sample other dishes,  being that we were only 2 we limited ourselves. For desert we got the warm chocolate cake....beautiful presentation,  but was average. About the only thing I could say about the place I was not thrilled with, was 2 martinis @ $17 ea??? But I guess something has to pay for the expensive fancy doggie (Bag) they send you home with of the leftovers.

I could not believe how packed it was at 9pm on a Sunday- this was a rare outing for me on a Sunday night ;) I know I may come off as lame, but I have a job that I just cannot function well at if I am out until 10:30PM, and still do what makes me feel good the next day: i.e. eat right & workout.  The dining room was packed and people were still just casually filtering into the lounge areas.  The patrons did look young, so it could be that, because I def went out more/later in my 20's......That said- do other people work?  I couldn't believe how many people were here! Either it is a testament to the food, which I did not get to try, or the fabulous interior, or the area...... I was sorry we did not eat here and I will definitely be back- the room(s) are gorgeous, fantastically laid out, and like I said, full of beautiful/interesting people.I just cannot give it 5 stars until I try the food, because it IS a restaurant, but the drinks and service were great, as was the atmosphere and people watching, so think 4.5 out of 5 for now ;)",4,3,9,Rebecca W.,"Palm Beach Shores, FL",754,139,422

Everything is about 2-3x the price of an average asian/chinese/japanese restaurant. Don't get me wrong I've paid for expensive food but it was good and worth it. Tao is one of those restaurants where you come for the experience and once is more than enough. Food was mediocre. I ordered the cod which doesn't come with any sides. A side of rice is $7. No thanks. That's 1/3 of a bag in my local chinese grocery which will also last me a good couple of months. My friends ordered sushi rolls and again for 12 bucks a roll, at least make it look pretty.

Our friend who lives in the city chose this place because it could accommodate our fairly large party of 7.  Although we couldn't get in until 10:15 it was worth the wait. The atmosphere is a cross between a nice upscale restaurant and a lounge right before the party starts. The theme is Asian inspired and some sections are reminiscent of a nightclub.  If you are looking for a quiet place to eat this is not it but as long as you love good music you can get over how loud it is. We liked the food but we loved the music more. The dj played a mix of old school R&B and Hip-hop. There wasn't a song that we didn't song along to. Likewise there wasn't a dish that we didn't like either. As a larger group it's best to order several dishes to share. The portion sizes are pretty good although the dishes can be a little pricey. The drinks are even less readonable. My favorite dish was the Black fried rice, the flavor was awesome.

We were seated in one of the booths on the first floor, and we were actually seated next to celebrity Randy Jackson (cool)! The dining area is beautiful. We saw a family seated at a table filled with roses (so breath taking) right next to the huge statue. Our meal was well executed, and surprisingly filling. I ordered the chicken satay for an app, and he ordered crispy veggie rolls, both were delish. I ordered chicken moo shu for the main course, and he ordered the glazed salmon (with udon noodles). We were stuffed and didn't have enough room for desert, so we decided to take it home, and I'm glad we did.

Places like Buddakan and Spice Market might make better food but they can't compete with Taos sweeping views. We were a pretty big group, 7 of us but mostly vegetarian so I just tried the pork buns and the bass in banana leaf. I really liked the banana leaf fish. The table had a ton of veggie appetizers, the veggie dim sum sampler was fantastic and they also had the Szechuan dumplings which was very different from any dim sum I have ever had. The tempura wasn't great, too greasy. The spring rolls were just regular spring rolls. The standout veggie main course for me was the Shanghai fried noodles, it was really amazing, I wanna go back and try it with pork. The olive fried rice was also great. I wasn't too crazy about the veggie sides they were all too sweet for me except maybe the cauliflower. The good thing about this place is that there is something for everyone and the service was very good. They make amazing drinks.

1.0,10/9/2015,"Soooooo, I am a big fan of the establishments that Noah and Jason have put together.  I've been to Tao, Tao Downtown, Tao Las Vegas, Tao's club in Las Vegas, Tao beach in Las Vegas, Lavo in Las Vegas, Lavo in NYC, Lavo in NYC for dinner, Lavo in NYC for Lavo brunch, PH-D, PH-D, PH-D, etc. etc.  you get the gist.  I'm not a huge spender, but I have spent my fare share over the years at Tao groups establishments probably not cracking $100,000, but def well well into the $10,000's....and I've never been treated as despicably as I was last night at Tao's lounge underneath Tao downtown.  Long story short, good night, nice set up, packed, good talent all around, then I received my bill.  At the end of my bill there were multiple charges that I did not make including $20 Amstel lights, now correct me if i'm wrong, but is that the most expensive average beer anyone has ever seen.  It's regularly $8 beer night in Manhattan, but $20 for an amstel, I mean this wasn't a Delirium Tremens at a nice restaurant, and it was for a) multiple beers b) that I did not order.  I respectfully told them that I hadn't ordered the drinks that I was charged for and then told to pay my bill and get out.  Fast forward a little debating once I finally got the bartenders attention and they wouldn't budge and I took out my phone to snap a picture of the ridiculous bill and it was then STOLEN by a neanderthal jabroni (one of the ""security""....the jamoch literally took the cell phone from my hands and took off.)  I believe after realizing that they were completely in the wrong, the bartender then went and ""modified the bill"" to take off the charges that I did not charge (fast forward to today, I was still charged for the full amount on my AMEX)  Then before I could even put the pen down from signing the correct bill, one of the same baffoons from before double under-hooked my arms and forcefully dragged me up the stairs and out of the bar.......a client, someone that came to your establishment to spend money, someone that just had a question why there were erroneous charges on a bill and also why they even have a button on the POS system for a $20 amstel light (I guess it's the ""scam button"" or ""FU button"")Long story short, I don't hold it against the company (because every company makes mistakes) but the way it was handled was totally inappropriate, and they should do something about the clowns that work there.  I will def never go back to this place, and will think twice before ever going to one of their establishments.  Good luck treating customers like that when the economy turns Tao.P.S.

It has a delicious miso glaze and sits atop mushroom and onion in a mild sauce.   I ended my meal with a delightful dessert of bread pudding donuts and ice cream.

5.0,10/7/2015,"I love Tao. I have been here numerous times and have never been disappointed. Usually a restaurant of this scale and party atmosphere tend to fall short in the food category, but that is certainly not the case for them. First, as a NYC interior designer, I need to comment on the decor. They did not cut any corners and completely hit it out of the park. Being here is like being in an entirely different world. They did an amazing job with the build out. Now on to the amazing food. Some things I have tried: crispy rice tuna, GET IT! Satay of Chilean sea bass, I don't know what they do to this fish, but it is out of this world! I could live on this and be a very happy girl. Lobster wontons, another win. Pad Thai noodles, drunken pad Thai, barbecue dick fried rice, lobster fried rice, beef magnolian, grilled Bronzino and an assortment of their sushi. I honestly could not say a single bad thing about any of these dishes. Lastly, onto the dessert. Bread pudding doughnuts served with banana foster and brandy ice cream. You heard me correctly, and yes it tastes as good as it sounds. I have also tried their signature giant fortune cookie, which is another amazing option. It is rare for me to say, but the hype about this place is actually rightfully deserved. Home run.",2,1,1,Molly S.,"Long Island City, NY",96,89,144

My journey began when we were greeted by the snob feast at the check in hostess table. Girls you are not paying me to be here, it's quiet the opposite actually....Anyway they checked us in and told my party and I to wait to be seated, we made our way to the crowded bar, although drinks were great the place itself felt a bit overwhelmingly busy. We came up to the bar 30 mins laterI recieved a text message on my cell phone stating that our table was ready. We were lead down the stairs and seated smack in the middle of everything.  The place itself is beautifully made. The decor is stunning, but I m not a fan of the pretentious crowd. The food was just average and nothing to write home about. Service was very pleasant though. Will I be back here? Probably not...

5.0,9/21/2015,"I'm usually VERY hard to please, but I had a great experience here! Came here 930 on a Sunday night for my birthday dinner with 10 people (made a reservation a week in advance-had no problem) only had to wait for my table because a few of my friends were late, but as soon as they arrived they sat us right away. Had a large table with lots of room to fit us. The waiter Chris was super helpful, and extremely  knowledgable about the menu! Told us we could either order individually or do family style because some of the food choices were enough for two people, and if we chose family style he would guide us as to how many plates to get each etc. We ended up ordering individually and the food was great! Came out so fast and was still hot. Everyone was very pleased with their food! The Food wasn't too overpriced most things in the 17-25 dollar range, others a little over priced, but nothing ridiculous, it is NYC. For dessert there was also a choice to choose individually or get a dessert platter for $38. For 10 people and dessert on average $15 each the platter was the smart choice. The desserts consisted of a little of everything on the dessert menu so it was definitely a great choice! Without a doubt I am coming back here either with a large party or small!!

After getting seated with friends we had a blast. I have to admit I wasn't impressed with the food much. It was not too fulfilling to me but the  presentation was nice.

4.0,9/19/2015,"So based on these reviews.. I guess it's safe to say that everyone's experience is individualized! Just like it is everywhere else.... Needless to say, my party and I loved it here! Came for my birthday dinner, reservations at 1115pm... Didn't sit until 1145pm.. Fine.. We know they want us to spend money at the bar before we sit which we had no problem doing but it's like can you make that anymore obvious... They shot us a text when our table was available which was nice... Drinks were strong and I mean I can't speak on the price but I'm sure they were like $15-20/drink.. It's NYC ..it's Tao...and they can do that.. If you come to an upscale place in the city and expect to pay less well then you're sadly mistaken.. Go elsewhere lol..  The place itself if pretty phenomenal looking.. Huge space, high ceilings, just the right amount of Buddhas decorating this place .. It's pretty perfect and the atmosphere def optimizes your experience.. The food was amazing.. Ordered the shrimp fried rice.. seared tuna... Chilean sea bass skewers... Some roll... And these little chicken lollipops... Oh my god .. We have not one complaint about the food... The winner for me was definitely the satay of Chilean sea bass.. You must order them, it's like the best cut of fish cooked perfectly .. It tasted amazingly buttery and melted in your mouth with a sweet splash of whatever that glaze was on it.. They were so tasteful and we really loved them.. Everything else was so delicious as well and we were full! Your best bet is to go with a few people and order a bunch of shit... It's perfect .. Def splurge and get the fortune cookie.. Everyone at the table gets a fortune and I mean they were pretty appropriate for each person at our table hahaha... It has this fluffy ,deliciously airy mousse inside.. I favor vanilla more than chocolate but it comes with both... I wish they had one full of vanilla mousse! They also serve it with fresh fruit ... Our experience was really great .. Food came out quick.. Waiter attentive.... I can see how it gets crazy in here or people have a crappy experience with it.. It's the city ..people are in here mainlining drinks trying to remember fun and it can get hectic Bc it's attached to a friggin club lol... Also, the promoters on here are really annoying lol promote on your own pages I'm sure you guys have like 20 IGs and other public forums where you beg people to come in there...",4,0,2,Laura G.,"Long Island, NY",302,305,2668

2.0,9/15/2015,"The Tao Downtown OMG ReviewSo here is the trajectory for gigantic scene and theme restaurants in NYC.  Hot hot hot....the fabulons descend and your reservation is at 5:15 or 10:15.  The reviews for food are rarely good...but food is not the point.  The scene continues but eventually changes.  The fabulons move on...the super models were never really there no matter what you heard...and it becomes a pickup club with food or an outing for business groups that want a trip on the wild side.   Eventually it's exclusively for tourists for a few months or years before it will be closed for re-theming and the process starts again.  And there will be a point on this trajectory when it will be easy for you to make a reservation. And you will do it because you have been curious even though you didn't have the energy or connections to squeeze in during the hot hot hot weeks.And that is where we are with Tao.  Gave it a try with a last minute mid-week reservation.  The space has every Asian themed restaurant cliché you can think of.  The crowd now apparently does not see much need to adhere to the dress code referenced on the web site, at least during the week.  Shorts and sneakers seem fine.  But if you are not going for a scene (which you should not), then the focus is the food.  The thing about many Asian themed restaurants is that when you step back and think about the food, the two directions are really fried and sweet. Eating healthy can be a challenge, unless you aim for sushi.  Eating great food is impossible.  Fried rock shrimp in lettuce cups was passable. Spicy dumplings were more sweet than spicy.   Peking duck was a mushy mess of bland breast meat and blander crispy skin with a cloying sauce that did not help.  Miso black cod was the one standout - nicely flavored and well done.The servers are good, but clearly they are shifting their shtick for tourists who are likely there for the first time.   Though friendly, the tone almost implies that this is your first outing in a restaurant at all.  But service was efficient.  And if you just want a place for a big group of friends, the fun drinks can make the food less important.  But if you think you see Naomi Campbell there you are probably drinking too much.",0,0,0,Bill B.,"New York, NY",0,21,0

The adult drink menu was unique and refreshing...an added bonus of having a mixologist.  We sampled many dishes and found all to be dynamic in flavor while portioned  perfectly.  Service and staff were all attentive and checked in as appropriate to insure we were happy with our dining experience.The only negative is due to its size and open design it can be noisy and a bit fast passed for some.  For myself and my other half it was a great way to warm up to New York City pace.,0,0,0,Jeff P.,"Land O Lakes, FL",1,4,0

1.0,9/9/2015,"One word: RUN!!! I never write reviews but my experience here was so awful that it urged me to do so. Most of the 5-star Reviews are from people who indirectly work here or are paid to promote it. I am in the health care industry and my review is unbiased. The nightclub is not that impressive and definitely overpriced. I went here with my girlfriends to have a good time and this place turned out to be a nightmare.After we came in and consumed highly overpriced drinks, we went to the dance floor. As ladies often wear high heels for a club, I did and suddenly felt uncomfortable and needed a break so I sat down on the nearest bench.  Before I realized it, some bouncers and rude waitress started yelling at me and flashing lights directly on my eyes.  Of course the music is way too loud and you can barely hear what they say.  Next, they are grabbing me and my 4 girlfriends and escorting us OUT of the club.  They wold not give me or my friends any explanation and were very rude/unprofessional the whole time.  The guy not only forcefully grabbed my arm but threw our drinks away after they had charged us over $15 for each one.  Are you kidding me?! I have been a promoter and run events in the past and never seen or allowed this type of unprofessional behavior.  The fact that it is Tao and is in NYC does NOT entitle their personnel to disrespect their clients. I was not drunk, creating a scene or involved on a fight.  Me and my friends are ALL professionals and were treated with the utmost disrespect. I am also in the military which from the very beginning teaches you to respect others. The personnel at this nightclub sadly needs more training on this...

The service was great, the atmosphere was nice, and the food was amazing! Everything came out hot, was cooked perfectly and was prepared beautifully. We had been to the Tao in Las Vegas and this one is just as good if not better. With no exaggeration, some dishes were the best food I've ever tasted. My favorites were the ahi tuna pizza appetizer, the Chilean sea bass, the chow mein, the sushi (all of it!) and the dessert (all of it). We are a crazy family and had what seemed like everything good on the menu family style (sharing all of the plates). We probably had one of every dessert there was as well. Everything we tasted was just so delicious, that we forced down too much food and practically had to roll each other out of the door and back to our hotel. We couldn't eat another bite, which was sad because we wanted to. Luckily we were able to get multiple to-go boxes and had our cousins who live in Manhattan take the food home. TLDR?

The Mongolian beef also melted in your mouth, it was prepared very well. The lobster fried rice was delicious. I personally did not like the shishito peppers but others said they liked them. The rock shrimp lettuce cups were too lime-y for my taste palate. The sushi we got was the crunchy yellowtail roll, a spicy tuna roll, and I believe it was a Chef Yoshi roll with salmon on top. The sushi was good and I especially liked the yellowtail roll. The drinks were also good but a little sweet. This is a perfect place for a birthday. Overall, I am so happy we went there.

The venue is gorgeous from the narrow long hallway you first walk through to the spacious multi level dining area falling under a giant buddha statue. Make sure you reserve ahead because the place fills up pretty quick after 8pm on weekdays. I had a good first experience at this restaurant. The venue itself is something definitely worth checking out if you haven't yet. My only negative thing about this place is that the menu has too much going on. Fortunately i picked some great choices that I've listed and described below:Kumamoto Oysters (special) - these Japanese oysters came with caviar topped off on them. The oysters itself were great but I wasn't a fan of the caviar (first time having it)Pork Potstickers - The sauce it came with was tangy and delicious. It also had some heat to it.  This was my favorite appetizer from the meal. Spicy Szechuan Dumplings - there were three kinds of dumplings - pork, shrimp and peanut. The pork and shrimp were great. I was disappointed that this wasn't as spicy as the waiter made it seem. Wagyu Rib-Eye Teppanyaki - this comes as a good sharing portion. the steak came out exactly how I asked for it. The entree comes with 8 different ""sophisticated"" sauces. It took me the longest time to realize the steak seasoning came on the side of the plate so make sure you look for it!Steamed Bok Choy - cant go wrong with this! Giant Fortune Cookie - white and dark chocolate mousse on each side of the cookie. This comes with fresh fruit on the side which I thought balanced out the dish well from being too sweet from all the decadent chocolate. I thought the dark chocolate mousse was fantastic but wasn't a fan of the white chocolate. The portion is huge btw!",0,1,0,Sunny G.,"Hoboken, NJ",178,53,97

Therefore I decided to try this new hot spot.  Maybe that is why I critiqued the food so harshly since I had such high expectations.  The ambiance was very cool and trendy.  The service was slow.  I ordered the crispy barbeque chicken and jasmine white rice.  I felt like the food was mediocre for the price I paid. The chicken wasn't very flavorful and rather bland. The rice was typical white rice.  It was an okay experience overall,0,0,0,Fareeha M.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,21,3

1.0,8/15/2015,"I don't normally do reviews but I'm so upset at the experience my coworkers and I went threw yesterday at Tao downtown. My coworkers and I had been planning to come here for quite a while. So we planned yesterday and were really excited. My coworker and I had arrived before our 3rd friend so we went inside to see if we could get a table being that we didn't have reservations. The hostesses weren't too friendly but one of them said I can try and get you guys a table before 8, when is  your third guest arriving and we said about 5-10 min so she asked for us to sit and wait at the lounge area. So we did, when our 3rd guest arrived we walked back up to the hostess and the hostess that originally said she would get us a table didn't even look up to acknowledge us not a second of eye contact and just said tables are booked for the night,  in  lounge there's space or at sushi bar, and another hostess says yeah there's plenty of room no one is there, and my coworkers and I were disgusted, we just said thank u and walked down to the sushi bar to just see what it was like, To notice there were more then enough tables empty, we were highly upset and felt disrespected, the service was unacceptable for such a well known beautiful place. The customer service ALL of the hostesses provided were simply SHITTY ! They all need to be replaced, I will not be coming back.

The ambiance alone will capture you as soon as you walk in. The Geishas kindly greet you as you walk down the path to their exquisite bar and dinning area. Definitely sets the mood for any special occasion. My favorites on their menu would be the Tuna Tartar and the Sea bass (appetizer or meal). You just can't go wrong with either one.

5.0,8/1/2015,"I've been here a few times for dinner with my boyfriend. We came on Saturday (in August, so it wasn't as crowded) at 9:30pm.This place is one of our favorites in the city - the restaurant is so cool, like no other and very extravagant. It's very impressive. I'd recommend this place in a heart beat if you're looking for a fun, cool spot that is trendy, chic, and spacious. BTW I'm not even a real ""clubby"" person. I feel like I have to point that out because sometimes this place gets a rep for having a clubby vibe. It's just a really really neat spot.RESTAURANT OVERVIEW:-Super luxurious - dim mood lighting.-There's a man outside to welcome you in, you pass through a large, heavy, double door and enter the coat room. Then you have to go through another large double door to enter a wooden corridor that has an arched ceiling. At the end of that hallway you'll find the front desk area to check in for your reservation (DEFINITELY make a res. This is not the place to walk in - you should make a reservation at least 2 weeks in advance. The earlier you make it, the more likely you will be able to reserve a time that you want - like 7, 8 or 9). -They usually send you to the bar - I've waited between 15 - 30 mins for the table to be ready. -First you walk into the main, grand room. You can see stadium style seats leading down to the main dining area. The decor is awesome / the ambience is very very cool.-The bar is in a separate room off to the side after you pass the main room. There are also tables EVERYWHERE.-If you have 2 people you will want to sit on the stadium seats and as high up as possible. When you sit there, you seriously feel like emperors overlooking peasants - it's the best. You also get to sit next to each other instead of across from each other, which is cool. Also the seats are very comfy!-There are two really big dining tables on the top floor looking down over the main dining area. Kind of like box seating. I think these tables would be sweet for a group of friends for a birthday or special occasion.-The bathroom even has a bar in it!APPS:-Hot Edamame: This is such a staple. If you like edamame, I'd suggest this. It comes with thick  pieces of salt on top and is delivered to you in a steaming hot bowl. -Pork Potstickers: AMAZING. These are DEEElish. We ended up getting a 2nd order of these after we finished the 1st. They are cooked to perfection. Perfectly crispy on the outside. The sauce that comes on it is just the right amount of sweet and spicy. We were obsessed.-Lobster Wontons: This comes in a bowl of broth and has 5 wontons that look like little dumplings. This was good. I'd probably try something else though next time. I'm not sure if this is worth another try. -Vegetable Spring Rolls: Another dish we had to reorder because these are THAT good. AMAZING. Perfectly crunchy and filled with deliciously cooked veggies. It comes with two types of sauce. One that is kind of like mustard and another that is sweet and comparable to a thick eel sauce. SOOOO GOOOD. Get this. And get the pot stickers. Done.-Inside Out Soup Dumpling: This was suggested to us to get by the waitress. I do like the unique way you have to eat soup dumplings. These were definitely really good. I'm not sure if I would get them again though. I'd probably try something else first. BUT if you love soup dumplings, I would get these. I'm just not that big of a soup dumpling girl in general.ENTREE:-Chicken Pad Thai Noodles: To be honest, we were both quite full when we got our entrees. My suggestion is to first order apps (if you are getting apps/small plates, which I highly suggest you do), eat them, and then see if you want to order entrees. This place has so many good little bites and it would be a shame to miss out on those and fill up on 1 large entree. Don't get me wrong, the noodles were still on point and very tasty. I'm personally more of an app/small plates fan when it comes to this restaurant because they do those SOOO well. If you have extra room, then get an entree, but maybe just save more room for more apps!! They're great and there are SO many to choose from.DRINKS:-Old Fashioned: Love!!SERVICE:-All waitresses I've had have been great!-Sometimes there is a long wait after you check in for your res (15 - 30 mins)-You can only be 15 mins late for your res. Get here on time!-During all months except for the summer when everyone is away, expect Saturdays to have a different crowd than any other day AND be more crowded. This night brings in very clubby types of people who usually go out to the club part after or to the Dream Hotel. Not like you're going to be hanging out with people there, but I just to note this night brings in a different crowd in comparison to week nights or even on a Friday night. TIPS:-Make a res in advance!!",4,0,1,Samantha L.,"Manhattan, NY",148,74,203

We had to ask for water 7 different times in a 15 minute time period before we actually got a glass and the check took 25 minutes to arrive.That irritating part of dinner was offset by the really awesome atmosphere and food.

From walking down the long hallway to get to the seating area and the multiple bars, this is definitely the ""it"" spot. Because we went to the other location first to eat dinner, our only plans for coming here was to go to their club/lounge...We were directed to the lounge which was around the corner from the restaurant. We went on a Friday night around midnight and it was such a long line. We thought we weren't going to get in, and probably wouldn't have gotten in until we told the doormen that we were from California and had no idea that we had to either buy bottle service or get on a guest list to enter the club. He asked to see our ID's, saw that we were out of towners, and graciously let us in. Low key felt like a celebrity, as we by passed all the other folks that were anxious to get it yet mad because they couldn't get in.I'm really not a club person, but I just wanted to see what NYC nightlife was like, since in L.A. the nightlife scene is over around 1:45a.

To start, we had the Rock Shrimp Lettuce Cups and Lobster Wontons. These are a must - SO GOOD. For our main dish, we shared the Glazed Thai BBQ Chicken and Shanghai Fried Rice. We also had wine with our meal. Before dinner, we weren't starving or anything so this was more than enough to have us filled.A bit overpriced, but like most people wrote in their reviews, you're not paying for the food.

I'm pretty sure you can find better Thai food from your neighborhood restaurant. People mainly come here for the experience. The bar, the lounge setting, the stadium seating, which i finally got once after requesting it like 5 times. Even if you make a reservation you're going to have to wait at least an hour, which pisses me off every single time. Expensive places like this should be able to acomadate their customers especially with prompt reservations.

This restaurant is beyond beautiful and decorated to perfection. If you are looking for a place to bring someone from out of town, birthday celebration, date night, or whatever come to TAO. Now, let me start with the ambience. Great music, dark lights and beautiful Asian inspired statues everywhere. They have a huge Buddha with a pond and koi fish swimming in it! As far as food, I've definitely had better food and it's not cheap. This restaurant is expensive from the drinks to the apps nothing is under $16.00. The edemame is even $10.00. However, you aren't paying for the food but More So presentation and ambiance. My fav dishes are: lobster wontons, Hong Kong noodles, fried rice, and spicy tuna rice cake. Don't pay for the lobster three ways. The terayki lobster is amazing, but the other two ways are below subpar. For deserts get the passion fruit sorbet and the huge wonton cookie!

It was a finely chopped salad with tofu mushrooms and mizuna in a soy vinegar dressing with hints of citrus. I also tried the olive rice which was surprisingly tasty.

The food was expensive and the quality to dollar ratio was sub par.  This to me is the kind of spot i would eat dinner somewhere else, dress nice, THEN go out and meet friends there for a drink or two while nibbling on one of their appies (which are the price of most entrees at regular restaurants) I am not whining and i'm not cheap, im just saying for the price you pay u can get exact same food at other spots. I think its more of a vibe and place to hang out, because the atmosphere and the decor is fantastic! A lot of good looking girls and cute guys, good music, nice and big so you can get a table although i would recommend you reserve in advance. Our bill came to around 140$ for two, had one bottle of sake and like 3 different appetizers (which tasted WHAT EVER) again, you're paying for where you are not the quality of food. would i go again? yea... to meet a friend after work or something thats about it....",0,0,0,Iliana D.,"Manhattan, NY",98,343,163
4.0,6/29/2015,"The ambiance of Tao is what makes this place one of my favorite restaurants. From the moment you walk in through the huge Asian inspired doors you instantly forget that you are in NYC. The decor and set up of the restaurant is unreal. The lounge seats (for dinner service) on the stairs are perfect for a date. My boyfriend and i always request to sit there (which they always fulfill) The lounge area up top is good to as you can drink and eat with waitress service. The food is good. I eat at a lot of Asian influenced restaurant so i have high standards. It is very pricey which keeps me at it being just good. Some items are delicious, like the sea bass, crispy rice and the lobster dumsum. I have had a few entrees which were very good as well. The sushi, is just sushi. More rice then fish and nothing really too special. for $20.00 your better of trying a yummy appetizer. The dessert is the best part. The huge won-ton is always a must at least once. The creamy coconut is my favorite tho. Its a dish with multiple components- creamy coconut custard, raspberry sorbet, diced strawberry, white choc.. etc so it keep it interesting. The cocktails are very good as well. I have had mix experience on the service. it is always very busy, but for what you pay it could be a littttle more attentive. Sam was my most recent waitress and she was great. I think they just need a few more bodies and the floor and they'll be good. The maitre d could have been a lot friendlier. I get your very busy and under a lot of stress. ( i am a restaurant manager so i understand) but you ALWAYS have to remain happy, no matter what- its our job. The gentlemen who was possibly the floor manager or maitre d and she was the head hostess was very kind though.  I try to go mostly on Sundays were it is not as packed even though make a reservation.

I knew this was someplace special and fun. The main dining room offers up the WOW factor. Standing at the top of a cavernous space you look down and back to a massive statue of the Buddhist goddess Quan Yin. Depending on where your table is, you'll be led onto a set of steps. There are some really unique tables right on the steps, giving an amazing view of the restaurant.

1.0,6/21/2015,"The food was great but the service needs much improvement. The restaurant business is not an easy business to manage but when you are paying almost $500 a couple for a meal, you'd expect having an impeccable experience, unfortunately that wasn't the case for us. We had a party of about 14 people and when we only questioned a part of the bill to ensure there were no mistakes, we were given a nasty attitude. One of the workers there, and I believe he may even be a manager called my wife a bitch straight to her face. How can a husband let that go? He doesn't. So when I ask, what did you call her again?, his response was ""a bitch, your wife is a bitch"". Long story short, we were both escorted out. On the way out, AND I HAVE IT ALL ON VIDEO, one of the other tao employees put his hands on my wife, called her a whore and a bitch, repeatedly.

2.0,5/25/2015,"Tao downtown is like your ultra slutty ""showey off"" hot friend with poorly done restylane lip injections and annoying personality that tries so hard to score a good guy and fails on every level. She's fun but there is only so many bimbo-ey one night stands you can have before a guy dumps her and moves on!I came here for a friend's birthday once and it was fun but it was certainly no amazing culinary experience, especially for the price. I like Jose Andres restaurants in Miami and Hollywood much more for the similar sexy crowd, astonishing decor and hip vibe but with much more edible food. I figured oh, well, I'll never be back, see you later gator. But then my boss at the time, decided he wanted to impress important business clients with the showey thing and take them out for dinner here. From a business perspective, no amount of charms, prior practice and preparation can make up for crappy table service ruining the mood. The basic concept - ""bringing out all the entrees for individual guests"" at the same time so that they can enjoy their food together is as foreign as alien spaceship in this restaurant. I've never felt more awkward staring at my food for 15 minutes waiting for them to bring out the clients' food while my food gets cold. In short, each time, it sucked badly and my boss spent enough money where it was completely unjustified.

First let me start off by saying our reservation was for 8:30PM and we didn't get seated until 9:45PM. That alone was a turn off & the starting point of how our night & experience would be. We ordered appetizers and we were given the wrong one. Then we ordered our entree & even though it came out not everyone's food (party of 7 people) arrived. The food was delicious  but only 5 people got their entree and our other friends had to pick off of our plates until there food arrived which was when everyone else was finished with their entree. We notified the manager about the delay & our long wait prior to be seated. He acknowledge our concerns by asking if we ordered at the same time - DUH yes we did...During our main dinning experience the waitress never checked on us. To sum it up we got a complimentary dessert for the table because the food was late. While we appreciate the gesture the overall experience left a bad taste in all of our mouths.

5.0,5/7/2015,"One of my favorite restaurants in NYC and the one place I recommend to everyone, no matter their budget, cuisine of choice, or ambiance preferences. This place is hands down the best, especially to impress. Aesthetically, I love it even more than the original Tao (uptown). Stadium seating gets me hot & bothered. Long, dark entrance-way painted in gorgeous Japanese geishas is sick and worth taking a selfie in front of. Hostesses and waitresses are hot. Food is obviously a little expensive but worth it. I loved the mapo tofu noodles, which was authentic yet original. Bok Choy was even better than 5-star Asian-prepared. Of course, amazing sushi and instagrammable fortune cookie cake. I wouldn't recommend the steak though, as you can get better elsewhere, but can anything taste bad under the grand statue of the multi-armed Buddha (I actually don't know what that is)? Great drinks, especially the Tao-tini. The atmosphere is unbeatable--upscale, romantic, intimate yet rowdy, classy. You see a lot of promoters here with tables of models though which is testament to how amazing this place really is. Glamorous private rooms over looking the whole ordeal in the mezzanine, caged by intricate wooden designs but observable from anywhere in the massive place. Definitely make reservations in advance. The place is huge. The bar is in the back and much more secluded that the one uptown, which makes waiting much more endurable if you're dumb enough not to make a reservation to one of the hottest restaurants in Meatpacking.

3.0,5/2/2015,"I was very excited to dine at Tao as I've heard so many wonderful things. The ambiance is truly NYC and full of energy and beauty.  Other reviewers were not kidding - this place is full of beautiful people (and not so nice people).  We made reservations for 10pm and arrived early.  Despite the late in the evening dining time, it took 30 minutes after our reservation time before we were called. I find that ridiculous especially when you are starving.  I did notify the hostess that it was unacceptable to wait that long WITH reservations at that hour.  I asked for a round of drinks for the inconvenience; it was not offered but it was honored which I do appreciate.  The menu is very exciting and be prepared to want to order everything.  The portion sizes vary.  Small plates are in fact small, but the entrees are admittedly a good size. Be prepared to spend $$$ - it's upscale Asian fusion but really just overpriced. The food will be good - not amazing but you will enjoy it, as well as the music, and general feel of the night. We came on a Friday night and it was busy and, despite the hour, service was still slow.  Despite our ordering entrees at the same time, the food came at different times which really takes make it awkward for your guests when they have food and you don't.  I had to remove a star as a result of these flaws. I enjoyed the chirashi salad, shrimp tempura, shanghai fried rice, and sirloin with tempura broccoli.  I really wanted to go to the club but there was a line and it looked like more beautiful and superficial people.  I think that if you throw down $$ at dinner, you should have privileges at the club.",0,1,0,Reesie R.,"Manhattan, NY",45,329,56
2.0,4/30/2015,"Here's a future assignment for a freshman composition class at some liberal arts university: Write a two page essay on the symbolism of the Quan Yin Buddha that sits in the main dining room at Tao Downtown.There are so many angles to approach the assignment. Perhaps it is a symbol of forgiveness, allowing for the mindless indulgence required to justify paying Tao's food and drink prices. Or the many hands represent the prompt service from the army of waiters, constantly present to offer another cocktail. Or maybe her deep blue color represents the sadness that comes with being stuck with a large restaurant space long after the hipsters and true scene has moved elsewhere. I could go on, but after mulling it over for a couple of weeks, the Buddha should probably be left alone. People have spent lifetimes pondering its infinite wisdom. Tao's not worth the deliberation.Eating at Tao is just as you imagined. The space is opulent and contains more bankers, traders and very attractive significant others, paramours and side pieces than any other single building in the city. There are also a great number of tourists, who might as well come and claim, falsely, that they've been ""somewhere cool."" But here than someplace actually cool.The cocktails are too sweet and the food a retrograde mish-mash of Pan-Asian greatest hits. Tao pushes set menus hard. For a just over a C-note, this means piles and piles of egg rolls, sea bass skewers, shrimp tempura and other tired bites. Eventually entrees arrive - sub-takeout orange chicken, salty snapper, chewy beef. I was able to duck out before the dessert arrived, but who has the stamina to make this far on a Tuesday.Let me end on some clichés, which seem appropriate given the entire Tao operation: Tao is a place to be seen, not eat. You can eat far better food and spend far less money elsewhere. This place is not actually cool. Pan-Asian food is a circa season one of ""Sex in the City"" phenomenon that no one should be eating in the year 2015. The Buddha is tacky - no matter what it represents.",5,9,5,Jon S.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,647,1

So we made reservations, got there 15 minutes early and waited for 1 hour for our table. We got our table and when the waiter finally came it was an ordering nightmare. The music was so loud we could barely hear the waiter.  Then he insisted that he knew what we wanted to order and he would make it all special and easy for us. We explained what we wanted.  What we got was a $1200 bill for sushi that we never wanted or ordered. When the manager came, he acted like it was our fault and was very condescending like we did this on purpose.  When we tried to explain how the waiter handled the order, he didn't want to hear it. We don't eat sushi, all we wanted was some maki rolls and place our order of the dishes we wanted.  We really didn't want to make a scene, so we paid the bill and told them to keep the sushi.  After all, we didn't order it and we don't eat it.Very poor customer service.  I would never eat there again.

We came here to celebrate a friend's birthday and even though we had a reservation at 8:30 we still didn't get our table till 9:20! Now I would be furious but given we were about to cancel our reservation and leave, the staff immediately gave us the next table and took care of us and made me reconsider my position at this establishment!Yes it's a very pricey restaurant but you know what what?

I didn't even have to ask for someone to come over, amidst all of the people there she saw me looking at the wine menu and came right over to help! She is so knowledgeable and suggested some great wines! I always love meeting a fellow wine lover! The food is amazing! I would highly suggest the Chicken Wing Lollipops, and the BBQ Duck Fried Rice! So so yummy. Actually everything on the menu is good. The cocktails are a bit expensive, but they are good.

2.0,4/13/2015,"Summary - over hyped tourist place.The decor is highly generic (a huge buddha is the focal point - really? How imaginative and original for an Asian place!), and the food is below average. Our main-course dishes were actually cold when they were brought to our table, and we had to send them back. Also service is bad, we had to try really hard to flag down our server every time we wanted something. Also, the cocktails are very mediocre - we tried three different ones, and all of them were overly sweet to mask the lack of flair.",1,0,0,Sargam M.,"Manhattan, NY",81,163,0

1.0,4/10/2015,"Stay away unless just want a funky but pricey place for adequate drinks.I must say it's been a while since I had such a horrible dining experience.First off no question this place has superb atmosphere. It's like being swept away to another country with a luxury resort. Service was also very attentive.We got here super early 5:30 and the place was empty and by the time we left at 8:30 almost packed and super loud. If the music and general ambient noise could be managed better given the decor could be ultra romantic space. As is you are shouting to your dinner companion. I had the bar make me a cucumber saketini. Tasty but a bit weak for 15$. On to the beyond over priced very sad food. If this was spectacular Asian or Asian fusion one could stomach the price. But when food is barely edible that's another story.We started with a salad and $16 pork fried dumplings.Dumplings initially served covered with a overly candy sweet sauce. We returned the dumplings for a non sauced version and they were fairly tasty though uninspired dumplings you can find at any cheap Chinese restaurant for 6 bucks. For mains we chose the $30 something lobster fried rice and lobster pad Thai per our waiter's suggestion. The fried rice was a fairly small portion and overly salted with not the freshest lobster chunks. The pad Thai tasted like a dessert like a cup of sugar was added. Very small amounts of lobster. We returned in favor of Singapore noodles which were incredibly salty. At this point we just decided to call it quits. When a restaurant can't even balance basics like sweet or salt on any dish , beware.I am frankly dumb founded at any prior positive reviews and can only assume this restaurant is an example of using false reviewers. As we left my thought was confirmed looking at other plates full of five dollar take out level cuisine. It's a shame because if the owners had put as much thought and dedication in creating a quality kitchen as they clearly put on designing the physical space  in this restaurant this place would be amazing.",1,0,0,anabela D.,"Queens, NY",17,194,0

They served the same food that you could buy off the menu. Tuna tartare, pan fried dumplings, lobster pad thai and salmon dishes were really good. The desserts were amazing too (fortune cookie with white cream and chocolate mouse).The scene was a little touristy but the lounge, private rooms and club afterwards didn't seem so bad (bumped into several friends from NYC party scene) so felt like similar crowd to that of Lavo, Beautique and similar venues.Anyway, definitely recommend for a group event where you have pre-ordered dinner.

4.0,4/6/2015,"I don't know whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars.... so let me explain. I love a great venue with a theme and Tao is just that - it's also in a killer location in a uber trendy part of NYC. You really feel when you walk in that you have escaped NYC and teleported yourself over the seas to an upmarket venue in Thailand. The decor, music and lighting are on point. The menu is great (asian fusion) with an extensive mix for almost every taste and I've always enjoyed it. The cocktails are fun and easy to drink and if you're nice (and fussy like me) they'll create you something special off the menu that's based on your taste. The thing that really lets this place down so often is the douchey, and ""new-money"" crowd. This is the place you are going to get hit on by guys that have no real potential. Sounds harsh... maybe... but if ""wow! you are so much smarter than you look"" makes your heart flutter, then make this place your regular hangout. Also if you are injecting more than 1cc of any filler in your face, and love swarovski crystals on jeans with leopard print blouses then you will fit right in here.Best to go on a weekday and avoid the flashy crowd & door control on the weekend.Either way, it's worth a visit at least once.",0,1,0,Elana G.,"Manhattan, NY",48,27,9

4.0,3/31/2015,"I made a reservation for my friend and I at Tao Downtown on Saturday night. It is beneficial to make a reservation in advance because this place is full on weekends. When you enter the restaurant, there is a coat check to the right of the door and a long hallway to the left. After walking through the beautifully decorated hallway, my friend and I were given a buzzer device and told to wait by the bar. The wait was quite long, around 25 minutes, even though we already made a reservation and arrived in time. The restaurant itself is located on the basement floor of some building and it is huge! There is a large Buddha in the middle of the room and a DJ playing ambient tunes. The atmosphere is noisy and the lighting is very dim, which wasn't for me. I would say it is a better setting for large parties of people rather than couples. We ordered the ""Angry Dragon"" roll and the ""King Salmon"" roll for our appetizer. I could tell that the sushi were prepared with fresh fish and vegetables, so the taste was excellent! For my second course, I ordered the ""Pan Roasted Halibut"" which was prepared with red curry shrimp and pineapple sambal. My friend ordered the ""Banana Leaf Black Bass."" Finally, our delicious dinner was finished with the ""Giant Fortune Cookie,"" which was filled with dark and white chocolate mouse on the inside and fresh fruits on the side. Our waiter was attentive and friendly toward us. Although the service is quick, we ended up dining here for 3 hours total. No wonder it takes so long to receive a free table here.

2.0,3/14/2015,"A friend was visiting from out of town and wanted to go somewhere fun and a bit more of a scene than usual so she made a reservation at Tao.  Right, we had a reservation. For 9:30.  We didn't get seated until 11:00.  Pray tell, what on earth is the point of a reservation if you still have to wait an hour and a half?!  Their excuse was ""oh they are just paying"". They said that at 10:00. And then again at 10:30.  Now I am all for restaurants letting people linger a bit and not rushing them out the door but a) have better reservation management skills-- no one should wait an hour and a half, and b) if a table is lingering for over a half hour, offer them a round of drinks if they relocate to the bar.  Simple as that.  We did end up with 2 rounds of free drinks and a free dessert (the giant fortune cookie-- best part of the meal) but we had to prompt them for that first round of free drinks, otherwise we probably wouldn't have gotten them.When we finally got seated, our server was friendly and the food was fine (good but nothing stand out).  My recommendation is either just go to the bar for a cocktail and call it a day, or don't actually expect to eat anywhere close to your reservation time.",0,0,0,M N.,"New York, NY",67,156,1

4.0,2/24/2015,"Yet another place that tempts haters to wanna hate. Welcome to Tao! The most ridiculously over-the-top Chinese restaurant on Planet Earth! I mean, seriously, where else can you spy celebrities and supermodels while shoveling your piehole full of dumplings, sushi, and fried rice? Where else can you be treated to the luxury of a bathroom attendant eager to wipe the remnants of Pad Thai from the corners of your mouth for a wrinkled dollar?This is Tao - the most profitable restaurant in America! Their Las Vegas outpost alone brought in 60 MILLION DOLLARS in revenue in 2011 during, arguably, one of the worst financial recessions since the Great Depression. You don't invest in a place like Tao unless you are serious about making money. And restaurants don't make money if they don't deliver great food and great service, all at great value. (Relatively speaking, of course.)Having been to Tao Uptown many, many moons ago, I could recall how dazzled I was when I first entered the building. Sexy, cavernous hallways giving way to a giant, sexy, cavernous dining room inside... and that crazy Buddha statue! What the hell is THAT all about?!? (No, really... it was a real big deal to a young and poor 20something year-old guy back in the day.)Today, however, it takes a LOT more than a multi-story Buddha statue to impress me. I've seen all the gimmicks, experienced all the BS, and wasted a lot of hard-earned money in places that didn't deserve it. You can still fool me once, but only once.Needless to say I went into Tao Downtown severely skeptical. I couldn't care less about bumping into celebrities and supermodels, or any of that crap. I just want good food and drink at a price that makes me feel good about the money I'm about to fork over.Now, don't hit me for saying this... but Tao nailed it pretty freaking hard last week.Our party of 4 ended up having 3 people show up 45 minutes early, and of course they initially refused to seat us because we weren't all present. After twisting a few arms about how much we were about to eat and drink, we were immediately sat. And while waiting for our friend, we plied through a Dim Sum sampler and a giant selection of chef-selected sushi. All... AMAZING.With our fourth colleague running late, we continued the pile-on, this time adding the Chilean Sea Bass & Asparagus Satay, the Spicy Tuna Tartare on Crispy Rice, and another plate of sushi. I was so full after this I thought I might explode, but this being a business dinner, you must go with the flow of your company.And my company wanted to eat more. Much more. Enter our 4th colleague...This guy is a Tao Specialist. He is Mr. New York City. He knows everything about everything, especially when it comes to food and drink. And he quickly assumes the position of Mayor, taking over all ordering duties immediately upon seating.And then it starts.A tempura vegetable platter -- completely unmemorable and under-seasoned.Peking Duck - Never had this, but always heard about it. Basically, a pulled, roasted duck with the crispy skin pulled back over the pile of meat. Served Moo Shu style with pancakes, plum sauce, and julienned veggies. (Basically, Chinese fajitas.) I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't run back for it.Filet Mignon - Cooked in a ginger-scallion broth with wasabi dipping sauce. What could go wrong with this? Perfectly cooked. Perfectly seasoned. Loved it.Crispy Spicy Chicken - Some kind of special on the menu. You know the drill here. Crispy, wok-fried chicken chunks with onions, veggies and hot peppers in a tangy, but not-too-glurpy brown sauce. Better than your average Chinese joint, for sure.Sorry folks, but I'm going to hurl if I try to remember the rest. There was at least one more entree and an absolutely excellent veggie fried rice in the mix that followed. Way too much food.Dessert was fantastic, too. (Yep, I just said that.) Not sure why we ordered dessert unless perhaps we were trying to see if we could kill ourselves by food intake. I wouldn't know. I was well in the bag by this point thanks to some Chinese take on Manhattans and several glasses of red and white wine. Did I mention Uber is my best friend?All joking aside, the decor at Tao is absolutely gorgeous. The amount of money they must have invested into this place would suggest that our bill should have been much higher. And while it was ridiculously high, when I think of how long we dined here, and all the good food and drink we took in, I must say it was decent value for the money. (Especially considering I get here only once every ten or so years.) No joke, people, the food was really good. The service was very good. The drinks were very good. 4 stars. I'm a fan.",14,13,11,Christopher K.,"East Brunswick, NJ",907,697,955

2.0,2/23/2015,"I really hate to say that this place disappointed me as it did, but I can never deny myself the pleasure of saying true things. The restaurant looks nice, but the meal and service were subpar. I made a reservation through open table, per NYCgo's recommendation of this place for restaurant week. Only to discover, they actually weren't participating. I ignored all the obvious signs that this dining experience wouldn't be memorable and decided to stay anyway. Ordered the shrimp rolls and two other appetizers that I can't remember for obvious reasons. For an entree, my boyfriend decided on spicy chicken with chicken lo mein and fried rice. Sorry excuses because I have never tasted such BLAND Asian food in my life. The only thing that saved this place was the dessert. The mint mousse cake was delicious and I would gladly come back only for that treasured treat. Other than that, this place isn't great, awesome, good or cheap so don't bother.

5.0,2/20/2015,"An absolutely perfect dining experience. Be prepared to drop upwards of 150+ for drinks and dinner but it's absolutely worth every penny. My girlfriend and I celebrated our three year anniversary there last night and couldn't have had a better experience. If you've seen the photos you know that the room is gorgeous so I won't waste much time on that - but the restaurant is gorgeous from top to bottom. Many levels, buddhist sculptures, black marble and dark wood... it's stunning.The food - I mean... Wow. Here's what we ate and we recommend everything. Each serving comes with about 5-6 pieces and are perfect for sharing.Lobster Wontons - A triumph. The highlight of the night right out of the gate.Crispy Rice Tuna - Delicious. Light, crunchy, perfect flavour.Dim Sum Platter - Two pieces each of chicken, pork, shrimp and vegetable. My girlfriend is a vegetarian so this was a perfect compromise. Absolutely delicious. Shrimp Tempura - Very tasty, but we wouldn't order it again. It's no better or worse than anywhere else I've had. I'd skip the tempura and stick with the dim sum.Pork Bao Buns - Again, very tasty, but not as good as the dim sum which absolutely shines.Veggie Dumplings - My girlfriend really liked these (I did not have any)Shrimp and Scallop Spring Roll - Great flavour, nice crunch. Mega Fortune Cookie - An awesome dessert. A big fortune cookie filled with white and dark chocolate mousse and served with fresh fruit. A very good ending to a delicious meal.A few negatives... (but only if I'm being nitpicky)Our table was towards the entrance of the restaurant, right near the bar. It got pretty loud pretty quickly and the crowd was that obnoxious after hours frat boy turn wall st. broker type... Let's just say the language was rather colorful! In future we'd choose to sit closer to the centre of the room. The dipping sauce were uninspired. The food was absolutely delicious but each side sauce I found didn't contribute anything to the dish. Again, this is nitpicky.This restaurant has bathroom attendants. I've never been a fan of bathroom attendants. Especially the guy working last night who kind of just sat there. Seemed a little pointless.But again, these are all minor points. The place is spectacular. I have no trouble giving this restaurant a full five stars. Absolutely delicious.

I made a reservation and unfortunately my friend was an hour LATE, therefore we lost our reservation and had to sit in the lounge area. its asian fusion theme, we had good service but the food was not great, we order Lobster egg roll, vegetable dumpling and vegetable egg roll as apps and they were average nothing different from your average place like Spice or China Fun or Room Service which you would pay less money for the same type of food. I guess your actually paying high price for the décor? Any ways, my Lychee Martini was excellent! for entrees we order dragon rolls, seafood black rice and sweet glazed salmon and pad thai, since was winter outside, it was also winter inside of Tao, therefore in minutes our food got cold, not good!

2.0,1/31/2015,"This place is pretentious, overpriced and uncomfortable.First, they called us a few hours before our 7pm reservation to remind us that all six of us had to be there at 7 and if we were not there by 7:15 we would lose our reservation.  OK... I get it, they're busy.  However, we were all there on time and we had to wait over 1/2 hour to be seated.  If the restaurant wants to hold us to a standard of being on time, they should comply with the same standard.Finally we were seated.  The dining room was crowded and so noisy that we could not hear each other speak from across the table -- and it was not that big a table.  The waiter was nice though.Food -- the appetizers were good.  The hot and sour soup was very good.  The entrees were so-so.  The black rice with seafood was really bland and the texture was not really pleasant.  The sushi was good.Everything was overpriced.  Mixed drinks are $ 16!!!I guess if you have a desire to be a trendy person and don't care about cost, comfort or great food this is a good place.  The decor is very nice.",0,1,0,Steven G.,"Pound Ridge, NY",43,8,0

4.0,1/26/2015,"I've been to Tao Downtown twice - once for a smaller birthday and the other time for dinner with my boyfriend. The first time I visited Tao we congregated towards the bar area and ordered some of their small plates + dim sum (Hot Edamame and Dim Sum Dumpling Platter) to share. I didn't try any of their specialty drinks but everyone in my party said that they were amazing. The experience, atmosphere & entertainment factor (ahem, people watching) made us want to return to Tao again.On my second visit, my boyfriend and I sat in the main dining area. Our server was incredibly nice, walking us through the menu since we hadn't been there to eat before. I started with a Ruby Red Dragon cocktail (finlandia grapefruit vodka, yuzu citrus hint of pomegranate) which was fantastic. It was a sweeter drink that I wouldn't typically order but I really enjoyed all of the fruity flavors. We split the Dim Sum Dumpling Platter (seafood, pork, chicken, vegetable) which was plenty for us to share, 4 dumplings each. For dinner I had the Jumbo Shimp ""Mr. Wong"" and my boyfriend had the Filet Mignon ""Tokyo"" Style. We also got the Shanghai Friend Rice to share and the Warm Chocolate Cake with Salted Caramel Gelato for dessert. My only criticism was that our server was very attentive throughout the meal but after our dessert he just seemed to disappear. It took about 10-15 minutes for us to get our check and then another 10-15 minutes for him to return the credit card + bill to us.Overall I think the appetizers and drinks on both occasions were the real standouts. I think that next time I would stick to just drinks and a few appetizers at a table and then work my way to the bar area for additional drinks.",0,0,0,Holly L.,"New York, NY",0,67,5
1.0,1/26/2015,"My boss took our rather large party here for Christmas and spent an obscene amount of money. Dinner, bottle service in a VIP area, drinks at the bathroom bar (because that's a thing). The food was delicious, the place itself is a spectacle, but I had an absolutely awful night here. Apparently a large party of women started a fight in the dining area and had to be forcibly ejected by security. This was after my own party had finished eating and had split up into various portions of the building. A series of events seem to have transpired that no one can quite explain, but a single member of our own party seemed to have gotten carried out by security in the scuffle. They wouldn't allow her to get back inside and get her coat, so me and some other people tried to go out and see what was doing on, all of us coming from different parts of the building (it's a bit of a maze, especially after you've had a few).I stepped outside to try and see where everyone was, and once people started telling me the issue had been resolved, I attempted to get back inside to get my own coat. They told me I couldn't go back inside.It was raining. It was December. It was freezing. I had been outside for more than 20 minutes on the phone and my hands were frozen solid. They told me to give them the ticket and they would bring me my coat. I asked to just stand inside to look for the ticket because it was warm in there and the bouncer just kept refusing. Someone outside watching it all go down gave me gloves to keep warm but it wasn't enough, I was in a little dress! I pleaded with him, explaining I did not want to go back in, and that I would leave as soon as I had my coat. I literally could not dig through my bag to find this damn ticket because I was shivering so much. I actually had to hail and a cab and leave without my coat. I'm not kidding.When I called up the next day to speak to a manager and make sure they had my coat in safe keeping (because I found my ticket quite easily in the comfort of my own home), the woman who answered the phone told me they were ""too busy to look for it"" and no manager was available, and I'd have to call back tomorrow. I was LIVID. You're certainly not too busy, not after what you did to me, but they are just are not capable of caring less.The next day I finally get on the phone with the manager, who accuses me of being a part of this group that got kicked out. It didn't even make sense, our party was double in size than the party he was referring to. We ordered bottle service after leaving the dining room, for christs sake. But he really thinks I'm part of this group, so he tells me that's why I wasn't allowed back in.I DIDN'T WANT TO GET BACK IN, I WANTED THE COAT I HAD ARRIVED WITH. IT KEEPS ME WARM IN THE WINTER YOU JERKS.And not for nothing, I don't care if someone is getting arrested or being carried out Hannibal Lecter style, you don't get to steal their stuff. You still have to return their items to them. What kind of logic is this? I had to go back later in the week to get my coat. So now I have my coat.

2.0,1/24/2015,"How could such an exclusive, beautiful place, get such a low rating? Easy. Poor floor management and overbooking. Everything about Tao is beautiful. The entrance. The art. The tables. It's perfect for a special occasion. It really stands out from the cramped New York gourmet hideaways. Lush, lavish, and grand. The food and the cocktails are amazing. Came for a bachelorette party. The ladies really dug the lychee martini. But prepare for a Manhattan price :) I lived in Japan for 5 years and the sashimi, pan fried gyoza, and udon were made with amazingly fresh ingredients. The speed from the kitchen was also noteworthy. From order to eating it was less than 10 minutes. So I'm taking two stars off for the reservation process. They only take reservations over the phone, despite having an online website with event coordinator page (wrote on 3 separate occasions - with no reply). They only accept reservations a month out. 30 days to be exact. So if reserving on 01 Dec you must call at 01 Nov at 10am to get a decent seating. Especially if seating anywhere other than the main floor, and if seat more than 4 people. I've traveled to 35+ countries in 7 years and TAO downtown stands out as the worst reservations process in the world. To include Las Vegas on New Years, Hong Kong on Chinese New Year, and Rio during carnival. Yeah, it's that bad!I wouldn't be so miffed about reservations but... A table for 8, at 9:15, on a regular Saturday night, in the dead of winter... for a bachelorette party was not seated until almost 10:30. WITH a reservation!!!We had bottle service set up at a club for 11:30 so we, as the diners, had to rush through our dinner to make it on time. The host was trying her best, but the real fault is on the cougar something manager who cared more about flirting than keeping her floor moving. The third star removed is because of her and her wait staff. I tipped our bus boy 50% of the waiters tip because he was more attentive to our tables needs than our waiter was... Whom was busy talking to other wait staff. The manager was no where to be seen managing the floor because she was too busy dealing with male clientele at the hostess station. I mention this twice, because she only deigned to address me after we were over an hour waiting. And at this point, a good manager would have offered a free round of drinks or an appetizer or head of the line seating on a separate occasion. She was like, ""this is what Saturday is like."" Yes, this is what Saturday is like when you do a shitty job. I've seriously had better service in McDonalds than this place. If the owner ever reads these reviews here's a tip: Fire your reservationist and floor manager and most of your wait staff... Minus your host, cooks, bartenders, and buss boys. Start OVER. The restaurant is gorgeous. The food is excellent. There is no reason why TAO can not be a real five star experience; your management/on site leadership is why you have such mediocre reviews. I would give it zero stars - but the drinks were good. The food was excellent. The ambiance was beautiful. And the ground floor workers knew how to replace shitty treatment with good taste. Plus, several other couples and parties were in the same boat. I actually laughed when this guy at the bar was mad for a 20 minute delay. I told him I'd been there for 50 minutes and he just left.

5.0,1/12/2015,"Quite possibly the best restaurant I have ever eaten at. I came here for my birthday on 1/10 with a group of 12 people. Friends are still texting me telling me that they are still blown away by our experience and cannot wait to go back. Everything was absolutely perfect! The ambiance is absolutely beautiful. I constantly found myself in awe of everything around us. For some reason, we could not get over the fact that, even the bathrooms were ""popping,""  the bathrooms have a bar inside, where we all took birthday shots and shared some laughs with a very friendly bartender! Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous. The food was something dreams are made of. Since we had a fairly large party,and everyone was indecisive about the menu, our waiter recommended a ""family style option"" which was incredible. We told him which meats and sides we typically enjoy, and the chefs actually created a menu for us. Half of the food was from the menu, and the other half was original. The best part about our table, was that is had a ""lazy Susan"" where the food was placed, so that we could spin the food around/across the table, and everyone gets to take what they want. Although all of the food was incredible, I believe the Peking duck was the best and most popular. Despite being completely hurting from being so full, no one could stop eating, because we knew a meal this good might never happen again! The drinks, both at the bar and at the table were SO good and had a decent amount of liquor in them, a perfect combination. Even more impressive than the food, was the exceptional service that EVERY staff member displayed towards our party. Many places of Tao's reputation and capacity are very pretentious and rude, I find. However, every waiter, bus person, bartender and hostess we encountered was friendly, courteous, personable, kind, and funny. I usually never go to the same restaurant twice in NYC...I will definitely be coming back here. Definitely a good place to go for a special occasion, book in advance!

5.0,1/11/2015,"Though I had eaten at the original Tao in Midtown, and drank at the at Downtown and Vegas locations, I had yet to sample the food in the main dining room here.  My brother and I happened to be seeing a show at the Highland Ballroom and had walked back onto 9th Avenue when we were confronted by Tao gleaming at us from across the street like the mirage of a river in a desert.  My brother had never even stepped foot in any of the Tao locations, so he was especially drawn to it.  Though we were not starving, we decided to venture in for a cocktail and some appetizers...Or at least, that had been the plan...The multi-level space was awe-inspiring with its Asian decor, red walls, and dim lighting.  Though the bar was in a separate room, part of the lounge looked out over the dining area, which was spread across several lower floors.  We grabbed a table with one of the best views and were greeted by our server, Sam.  I specifically mention her name, because she was phenomenal!  Her bright demeanor and helpful suggestions made her feel like a friend we had known for years.  My brother and I each started with a glass of wine.  The reasonable prices were in the $10-$15 range (cheaper than the $16 specialty cocktails), though the pours were massive!  In terms of the cuisine, there were several categories of dishes to choose from, but we finally settled on the Pad Thai and Duck Fried Rice.  We added chicken to our noodle dish, which was moist and tender.  The sauce was sweeter than others that I have tried, but I actually enjoyed that aspect of it.  In fact, it acted as a great compliment to the earthy rice, which included shredded duck meat, roasted broccoli, sundried tomatoes, kaffir lime, and real mint leaves.  The mint really put this dish over-the-top for me, as I loved the freshness that it added to the rice.  After two delicious plates, we determined that we had to forge on and decided to get dessert.  The Warm Chocolate Cake was served molten style.  Despite the oozing dark chocolate from its center, the cake itself was rather dry.  Its dollop of salted caramel sauce was forgettable, but the salted caramel gelato was sheer heaven!  The texture of the ice cream was more on the fluffy/whipped side, but was burst with flavor.We might have gone into Tao without elaborate plans, but we finished every morsel that was placed in front of us.  Though my brother did not have the same frame of reference, I would say that Tao Downtown was much better than its Midtown predecessor or even its neighboring Buddakan.  The food prices were definitely high, but the large portions helped to justify them.  I would gladly recommend it to anyone looking for a classy night out on the town.",4,2,2,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

I feel as though we would take the last bite of something and someone would come sweep away our plates. When dessert time came and neither of us wanted anything the menu was quickly replaced as a check.

Yes, it began to fill up this early afternoon on a weekend and by the time we left there was a line waiting for tables.The food was first class dining. We enjoyed the light show and music. I won't spoil it for you, but we kept expecting even more. Not that you would want to add a thing to this amazing experience, but if they added some live show you might just have people fighting to get a table at this new hot spot in NYC.I can't wait to go back and my friend Loretta was amazed.

1.0,12/13/2014,"Horrible. If you are not a celebrity or anyone of high status don't bothering wasting your time because that's exactly what TAO is; a waste of time. They will treat you like peasants. First off, regardless of your reservation time, you will still have to wait an hour & a half to be seated. What's the point of reservations? When we are finally seated, our waiter MARCUS U. couldn't be more rude to us! We could tell he was annoyed with us which is a feeling he needs to leave at home, especially when your service sucks! A guest at our table arrived late & when she had put in her order I asked for a refill on my water. About 15-20 minutes pass until her order came out & I still had no water so I couldn't enjoy my food considering I was parched. The bus boy who placed the rice on the table had his thumb planted IN the rice bowl (ew) she refused to eat it & they brought her another rice on a platter & made a ceremony... but it was probably the same rice if you asked me... Still no water... I see Marcus & reminded him that I had asked for a water his response was literally, ""Oh.. well, I don't DO waters, so I'll just tell the bus boy""... Well I didn't ask what you do & don't do & as my waiter I'm going to ask you, not the bus boy! That was a comment that should not have been made! He could've simply apologized for the delay & went & told the bus boy. Another guests arrives at our table & after she places her order.. Instead of passing to ask how's everything, Marcus says, ""While I'm here, is there ANYTHING else you guys need?"".... Again, very rude at that point we could tell he was annoyed for whatever reason but that was no excuse to show it, especially when you know gratuity is not included. That being said, on our $300 bill, not one person in our party left him a tip for his rude & horrible attitude & service. We did however leave a note for him telling him ""We don't do tips"" since he ""doesn't do water"".To top off the visit, the food I had asked to pack up (shrimp lettuce cups) was literally tossed into the Togo box upside down!

The manager was a poor excuse of a man who looked like he wasn't fit to manage. He then started to explain to us that she is his best bartender and would give my friend water.

4.0,12/11/2014,"TAO has always been my go-to restaurant for nights on the town. My husband and I had a reservation for 6.15pm and not a was soul lingering- just the way I like it (I hate crowds). If you don't have a reservation prior, dont bother attempting to get in past 7pm. It'll be a three hour wait- period. The ambiance is gorgeous. I adore the slide show on the quan yin buddha, especially when they have the rose petal projection. Its lightly dimmed atmosphere with candles spread everywhere, makes a wonderful romantic setting for birthdays, anniversaries, etc. Its truly a sight to see. Every table is spaced just enough to have complete privacy- which is a plus. Their bathrooms are monitored by an attendant, who assists you in washing your hands (hands you towels, offers any type of refreshments, etc). However, I felt like both of the attendants were a tad unprofessional. I could hear their conversation while using the restroom, as they discussed job related matters in a negative way. This should be reserved for after hours, or at least when customers aren't in the surrounding area. Each attendant has a bowl for optional tipping, which not most people do- being you leave your personal affects ( coat/wallet/ purse) at coat check or at the table. The female attendant had a sort of an attitude, when I didn't tip her immediately, as she handed me a towel. Based on that alone, I wouldn't have tipped anyways. So for that, I deducted one star. I ordered the Lychee Martini and my husband got the  Royal Rickshaw. I was slightly disappointed with the drinks, in general, even with their exotic drink menu. My martini was way too strong, and undrinkable. However, the Rickshaw was just okay. When we told the waiter, he did offer us to get an alternative drink from the menu- which was a nice gesture. We ordered: vegetarian dumplings for starters, Chinese broccoli, thai lime chicken and fried rice all for the main course. Everything was completely amazing, melt in your mouth, wonderful food. No complaints at all. Beautiful presentation as well as fast timing from the kitchen. Kudos to the chef (s).All in all, it costed us $116 or there about, prior to tipping.

Ok great but I don't want popular per se, I would really like to know what was fresh and good today? I ordered the toro and it was awful. Honestly, it was so chewy and disappointing.

It is quite the experience when you walk into this place. From the entrance alone, you will be blown away. When you finally get around the corner, you will continue to be blown away. This place is gorgeous and you'll feel like you're being transported to another place. We had a preselected menu that had all of the main things from the menu - chicken, halibut, steak, shrimp, you name it, we had it. All of it was alright, but nothing stood out as amazing to me. The sushi was good, but of course you're not getting the 5 Star sushi experience here. Everything about this was place was just mediocre. When it comes to Tao, you're paying for the name and the environment. The food is just a bonus that happens to be here.

4.0,11/1/2014,"Hm....I'm surprise to found this place on here rated only 3.5 stars. First of all, I like people to know, you don't come here just for the food, you come here for the experience.I think many people on here written this place for the food, and not the experience. Yes, of course, this is an Asian fusion restaurant, some of the food here, you can easily find it anywhere in Chinatown or some of the Asian fusion restaurants here in NYC, and it will cost you probably $10-$15 less, but you don't come here for that, you come here with an experience, you come here to impress someone, because the decor are different, and the food is not bad at all.First off, I think they are too many securities standing in front of the restaurant, which I'm not sure why, maybe people got drunk and get out of control? I jus don't see why are so many securities needed, is a restaurant.When you walk-in, to the right, is where you can have your coat check, and to the left is where the restaurant at, I really like the design of this place, you walk-in, is a long walk way to the host, which they have 4 computers, and will bring up your reservation, very professional. When you walk in where the tables at, I have to tell you, is really awesome place, because the restaurant is built down like into basement, so you are actually looking down the entire place from above, and the end downstairs is where the big budda sat. My friend and I ordered lots of food just two of us, because we are there to try out the food and see we can bring clients there. We ordered. Lobster Wonton - Which I'm not too sure it is lobster, I tasted more of shrimp instead, it was just okay. Chicken Satay - Chicken was well marinated, very tasty. Rock Shrimp lettuce cup - very good, but definitely for two, is a big plate Singapore Mei Fun - Very good.Banana Leaf Black Bass - Very good. Wagyu Rib-Eye Teppanyaki - I'm not a big fan of this, but my friend really like it, so you order it and you be your own judge. lol (But I think is a little over priced) Good for dinner date to impress her or him, whichever way you swing, not for business because this place can be very loud and is hard to hear, but is good if you want to take client out and impress them.

Let's just start with the negative since I only have one thing that upset me. I had reservations for 9:30 and was told they only hold the table for 15 mins. I arrived at 9:45 and as I started to speak to the hostess the time changed. (One minute)  I'm not sure if that delayed the time it would normally take for them to seat a party with reservations but we ended up waiting 30 mins before being seated. I was a lil annoyed because I was told it would only be 10-15 mins before we were seated. But anyway we decided to take pictures while we waited.So now onto the positives. 1.The restaurant is absolutely beautiful! The decor is one of the best I've seen! 2. The people! Everyone is so chic and trendy! I love it. 3. The food is good. 4. Wait staff is very attentive but not over barring. We didn't wait to long to be served and the food came out in a timely manner. 4.

Sorry for any inconvenience.""Ok...I get it - the world revolves around money but it was more the cavalier way she announced this change.

The décor is amazing with lanterns, urns and statues once you pass thru the doors reminiscent of the Ming Dynasty.  The main focus of the dining room is a two-story goddess that changes throughout the night with various high-tech projections.I've dined here on several occasions and received excellent service from the wait staff and consistently delicious and inspired cuisine.I recommend sharing 3-4 plates with one guest.  Start with the Lobster Wontons with Shiitake Ginger Broth.  This appetizer offers plenty of lobster and the ginger adds an extra kick. Delicious.  Try the Bamboo Steamed Vegetable Dumplings with Crunchy Cucumbers. The textures are a perfect blend. The Kobe Beef Cooked in a Ginger Scallion Broth with Wasabi Dipping Sauce is mouthwatering and the portion is plentiful for sharing.  I've also tried the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables which is very tasty with a sweet hint from the glaze.

In terms of food, I highly suggest the salmon tartare and the satay of Chilean Sea Bass. OMG the Sea Bass just melts in your mouth, it's out of this world. For dinner I highly suggested the miso glazed black cod, light and flaky white fish in an amazing sauce that pairs perfectly with the fish. The Cantonese cauliflower was also really tasty.

We waited maybe 3 min to be seated. Not bad at all.We had a nice table on the side. Good for me to people watch because I sat in the booth. Bad for my other 2 friends who had a view of the wall.The Service at first was quick! Drink orders fast. My fav was TAO martini. Then when we wanted to order food I swear we sat there for 20 min..finally he came over.. then it was quick again. later on for check he was no where to be found. Kind of annoying.The food:We ordered The Duck for 2. Now it was ok.. the price was crazy. 38 per person. I mean Ok I get it. Meatpacking... but still. I was hungry after we ate!I wouldn't get that again. It tasted good so if you like Duck and have cash to burn try it.Had the Chicken gyozza for starters.. it was good. Friends had the chicken Satay. It was good. A little greasy and not what I expected. It was cooked to the point it was chewy and crunchy. I can't explain it. had flavor though! The salad was good. And their Entree was the spicy chicken? I didn't like it. They did. It tasted too much like curry to me and I hate curry.Desert they had the grasshopper cake. I liked it a lot.We had the donuts with ice cream. I hated that. I should have gotten the chocolate cake. The scene was great,. This was fashion week so not sure if that helped but people looked good. Bar was packed. Everyone was tall! loldef people watching, guys in suits, and girls looking to slay them. Pretty entertaining!

We headed toward the lounge area to order some drinks and sit down and chat. The bar was pretty crowded and the drinks were expensive. An ordinary gin & tonic which was pretty weak was around $16.

First, the venue itself is absolutely beautiful and totally sets the mood for an intimate date or a fun night out in the city. The decor and lighting is equally sexy and amazing. And there's this giant 8 armed Krishna statue that lights up and changes color. It's pretty great. And the size of the place was what really stood out! In NYC we're all used to being crammed shoulder to shoulder with strangers...I hate it. But this place was massive(for NYC) and open.Our table was incredible! Right on the steps of the venue overlooking the entire restaurant. And the main point: the food. Absolutely Fing amazing! Look this place is expensive but this is NYC every damn thing is expensive. But when food is this good, I don't mind paying for it. I had the spring rolls and my girlfriend had the angry dragon sushi roll. We were both rolling our eyes in ecstasy. Oh and for desert we had the banana bread donuts and brandy ice cream...holy shit people..when I say we were moaning...I do not lie.My advice is to go on a week night. We went on Tuesday night and the place was totally packed! I don't even want to imagine what it looks like on a Friday.1 star was taken off only because our waitress was sketchy.

We usually hang out at the bar, which is alright most of the time... until it gets later in the evening.  After a certain time, the place starts to fill up with sleezy guys looking for...well, let's just say.. it's a turn off.  The bartenders are ok... a little plastic, but they get the job done.  Overall, this place is just pretty.. that's about all it has to offer.  It is worthy of 3 stars, but i cannot give it more.",0,0,0,Nikki P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,15,1
2.0,8/20/2014,"Tao was everything that I ever imagined it to be. I've seen Tao in midtown from the outside and it astounds me that it still exists. I guess it's an institution in New York but it seems so outdated. I can only imagine tourists and business people going there.No offense to everybody who has given a great review for Tao downtown but no person who knows good food would ever give this place more than three stars.Service was proper (though there were times we were kept waiting) but everything about this place made me shake my head. As a New Yorker it offends me that a place like this is packed on a Wednesday night, while restaurants in the LES or somewhere else downtown with much better food, is struggling during the summer season.Food was overpriced and oversalted. The quality of the sushi was amazingly poor. Scallop tasted fishy. I would choose Morimoto a block away any day. At least Morimoto uses high quality seafood. At Tao you are paying $40 for something you can get at a Chinese takeout shop for $8. The two good dishes were the seafood black rice and the sardine with salad (special of the night). The dim sum platter was ok, the crispy shrimp and scallop roll was too salty, the crispy rice tuna was actually good, the striploin special was way too salty, and the desserts were pretty horrible.Something else that offended me was the decor. The statues of the squatting guy were cool but otherwise, the whole buddhist theme was just down right offensive. Imagine going to a restaurant in Asia that has Jesus Christ statues and posters, Virgin Mary statue as the centerpiece... it:s pretty unbelievable that a place like Tao exists. The tableware is pretty tasteless and cheap looking.I try not to write negative reviews on Yelp but I know a poor review on Yelp is not going to affect Tao's business at all.If you're looking for a corporate business venue, this place is suitable I guess. If you're looking for a place with hot employees and guests, then sure, go to Tao downtown.

We gave up at 11:45. Tao downtown isn't really a restaurant. It's a nightclub - complete with thug bouncers demanding that its patrons stand behind a rope...ironic, considering that its patrons arrived on time, so there shouldn't be a need for bouncers had Tao kept to its promised reservations schedule.We saw the meals being served.

On one occasion, they only had a late night reservation at 11pm(Friday), which I took - arrived ON TIME, wasn't greeted as I stood in front of the Reservations Table trying to say hello to the girls there.. they wouldn't acknowledge me - they are SO RUDE!  they weren't working, just talking to each other & finally they looked up at me and I gave them my reservation name.  She tells me we will be seated momentarily, since our table is being cleaned up, and hands me a buzzer thing to hold onto.  I waited beside her for 20 mins and she doesn't inform me anything about my table, so AGAIN.. I approached her asking if she knows anything about my table?  This time she said they were settting up my table and to give her 2-3 mins.  I say thank you, politely and go back over to wait.  I ended up waiting another 25 mins and came up to her this time I said ""excuse me miss, you had said to me twice that I would be seated in just 2-3 mins and Ive been standing here in front of you for 45mins when  my reservation time for dinner was 11pm.""  She answers ""hold on let me check on that for you..."" & she came back to tell me the most ridiculous nonsense ever..""your table will be available in 25 mins...""!!!!!!Is this unprofessional, rude, woman not know how to communicate?!  Seriously if this was the case I wouldn't have waited and just left..

It was by far the worst experience I ever had and I have dinned in NY all my life,  I just couldn't bare it, I called the waiter over and told him to bring up out food that was prepared fresh and not sitting on the counter for god knows how long..because mine is C-O-L-D! this is unacceptable!! where are my drinks on top of tht??? ugh chaos!!Your charging me for the service & food Tao is providing but its not giving me any service or quality of food.. they didn't take the food back and my entrees' now came out room temperature... I didn't bother.. these people have no shame, I communicated to them as much as I possibly could and that was it for me.. I got up and left - no thank you TAO & all the pretentious, rude girls who think they are too good to do their jobs and to answer a guest with a nasty tone -  they need etiquette classes fast! TAO, get a better class of staff, educate on hospitality & service please.  Honestly the caliber of people walking in through your door will quickly turn into low class clientele if you continue to treat people this way.  Organize reservations, have employment meetings and structure your abilities to receive parties for dinner reservations.. etc.7 Out of the 8 times I've been dinning here was a NEGATIVE experience and I wont be coming back ! Not until I hear a positive review in the far future.. I'm appalled how quickly you want to make money of clients but not providing service with some class!

Luckily our table of 6 did not feel rushed like other Yelpers complained about.  Our servers all had smiles and were super attentive.  Everything that my friend ordered was absolutely delicious, but I will admit that the taste or portions were completely off balance in value.  And I would suggest to only dine here if you're on a date. The date should be well aware and willing to spend several Benjamin-bills for overpriced Chinese food.  My boyfriend did admit that the food was amazing and enjoyed the fun energy... we sat in front of the DJ:)  If it was a girls night, I think I would be happy just hanging out at the upstairs bar:)",1,0,0,Myra M.,"San Francisco, CA",15,374,73

You should definitely dress up (heels and dress or suit for men) if you plan on visiting. They even offered matches at the front counter upon entrance. We had made a reservation through the opentable system online before arriving. However, despite making a reservation - we ended up waiting around 1-1.5hours to be seated. A bit absurd. I can see why this place is busy though. I came with a group of four, and honestly we found ourselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. At dinner hour, TAO is expecting the guests to be purchasing their normal menu items at high prices. We ended up ordering the small side plates for dinner and waitress was definitely not pleased that we were wasting table real estate while other parties were dropping $1000's + for light up Vodka bottles and meals. We ordered:1) Crispy Shrimp and Scallop Rolls2) Hot Edamame 3) Lo MeinHaha, you can see that we definitely were not considered 'valuable' guests to TAO. Don't get me wrong, the food was impeccable and exquisite - we were just unable to afford such high prices at that moment. If you have the money, be sure to come here, I'm positive the $40-50+ main courses are delectable. Just the waitresses' dismay in our selections and verbally accusing us of not ordering enough to their standards would cause me to give a lower rating.

It maintains a very high energy vibe, while not being too loud. You are still able to have a conversation and easily hear the people that you are with.",0,0,0,Jnyc W.,"New York, NY",1,131,1

1.0,3/11/2014,One star is being to nice here but unfortunately I cannot give none.  As some of the reviews have stated the place is beautiful and that may be its only good quality.  I had gone there for drinks and was looking forward to a night out with friends for dinner.  After dinner was finished almost instantly one of my friends starting getting dizzy and almost passing out (mind you she had only one drink at dinner).  She had to have a bouncer take her to a private bathroom as she had turned violently ill.  Shortly after leaving me and two of my other friends got sick as well.  The Manager (Colleen Knight) was contacted the very next day at first she was sympathetic offering to either give us gift certificates or a refund.  Of course we opted for a refund as who would want to go to the place that made you ill. My friend had to keep calling and calling as now it was a different story and Colleen had to work on finding a solution.  After giving us the run around for almost a week she stated she would call us that weekend to get our card numbers for a refund and give us a Gift Certificate to a different restaurant.  When she didn't call the next weekend my friend called her direct line to find out that she had been moved over to Lavo.  I then proceeded to email her the following Monday where she feigned being sick and promised she would call that evening to which she hadn't.  That Tuesday we all received and email/phone call that our cards would be refunded and sorry for the inconvenience.  The following weekend my friend gets a call from the current manager Brendan McManus who was the complete opposite of Colleen the nicest most professional guy he said that Colleen had just left to Lavo and didn't process a thing and he needed our credit card numbers to process the refund (mind you Colleen stated she didn't need them as she had the original receipts).  He had the whole situation handled within 2 days where as it took Colleen over 2 weeks.  I would not recommend Tao for dinner but now with a new manager maybe things will be better.  However with someone like Colleen at Lavo I definitely would not be visiting there anytime soon.,0,0,0,Odie O.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,6,0

Anyhow, after having a drink at the bar overlooking the restaurant, we were brought to our table in the middle of the room - I didn't find any bad table in the place - and ordered right away. The service at the restaurant didn't seem as slow as some have described, however, the bar service was terribly slow.But back to the food, as starters we had the Tuna and Yellowtail Tataki and the Chicken gyoza, good but not memorable (in fact, I don't even remember having the gyoza).We shared 2 main courses, the Shrimp with spicy sauce (I can't seem to find it in the menu anymore), and the heavenly Glazed Thai BBQ Chicken, which I can undoubtedly say it's the best chicken I have ever eaten: juicy, spicy, flavourful, just perfect. Portions are the right size, not model-sized tiny portions, not hearty homecooked dishes either. We drank some wine in the bar and then I had the Mango Chili Martini, pretty spicy but fresh.The total was over $120 including drinks, which for a ""pretentious"" NYC restaurant is not that bad.

3.0,2/20/2014,"Nice place - it's a huge restaurant/lounge. Very pretty. HOWEVER, I would recommend the lounge more than the restaurant. It's a bit overpriced and the food is...meh. Like the rest of reviews say the food comes out way too fast. Faster than fast food. Not even joking. Almost scary fast. Another issue I have is the fact they OVERCHARGE for food that makes you believe you will get a healthy portion. Basically, anything on the left of the rice and noodles part of the dinner menu is enough to feed a baby. I ordered the $19 wagyu beef and was told it was two skewers. I'm thinking okay skewers are good.  I got my plate and it was more like toothpicks. The beef portion on each ""skewer"" was about 2 inches long. So for 4 inches of cold to warm beef (it was tasty) you get to pay $19. Riiiiiiiight. I had to order another plate of the pad Thai noodles and chicken in order to feel like I ate something for dinner and not a snack. Otherwise the food is good, overpriced, comes out too fast, and the ambience is beautiful. It gets a little too crowded and fast and they only take reservations with a credit card. Yup.

3.0,2/18/2014,"I selected Tao Downtown for dinner to celebrate a special occasion with my husband. Upon arrival, the first thing we noticed was the decor.  The entrance is beautiful !   Then when the maitre d (hostess) greeted us,  I was not impressed by their approach.  The young ladies are not warm and welcoming. I'm a firm believer of ""the first impression is the best impression"" and this really needs improvement.     After this disappointment, the waiter was very helpful with explaining the main courses we selected.  With our dinner, we enjoyed Tao-Tinis which is a pleasantly smooth cocktail but be careful as it can surprise you if you have 2 too many :)   For dessert, we both enjoyed the Coconut Cream Rice Pudding.  This was very good. The presentation was creative as the pudding was served inside a fresh coconut. I truly enjoyed it while my husband enjoyed his cappuccino.  The presentation of the meals are very creative and the food was amazing!   I would recommend Tao Downtown for a romantic dinner, a birthday or any special occasion.  I don't think I would bring my young daughters here and in my opinion, I don't believe this venue is kid friendly and not suited for family style dining. But overall, Tao Restaurant is exquisite -- from the decor, to the menu, the DJ was playing a nice selection of music to accompany the ambiance.  I would not choose Tao Restaurant as my favorite place as I will not be dining there on a regular basis.   I think of it as an once in a lifetime experience.",0,0,0,Pamela R.,"New York, NY",0,17,11

2.0,2/8/2014,"My hopes were high for this restaurant, but they were ruined through out the evening. I went there with a few friends on Friday night expecting a trendy restaurant with good food. Considering how new the place is you would think the staff would make more of an effort. We walked in at 10 and the restaurant is beautiful! All that can be expected for a Tao in the meatpacking district. The hostess gave us a buzzer and said it would be about 15 minutes. We went to the bar and had a drink. After waiting 40 minutes I went and asked how much longer it would be. I expect to wait at restaurants like this, but 40 minutes is pushing it. The hostess responded with we had 2 tables in front of us. When I asked her about how much longer she thought that  it would be she shrugged her shoulders and walker away. Our buzzer went off about 15 minutes later. It was a few minutes before 11 when we sat at our table. Waters were brought very quickly and our waiter came over for our drink order. We orderedThai Basil Smash - tasty, but a little too thick for my taste. It was very creamy. Ruby Red Dragon - DELICIOUS! Ketel One and soda - made just rightWhen our waited was taking our drink order we asked if we could order a few appetizers to start. He said that he could not take our food order until he brought us our drinks. All we wanted to order was edamame and dumplings, but he could not be bothered. After our drinks came in about 15 minutes by another server our waiter appeared 5 minutes after that for our order. We were pretty frustrated that we had been sitting for 20 minutes and we still had not put in the appetizer order.  We orderedAppetizerstuna with sticky rice - Looked delicious, but the tuna left a fishy taste in your mouthpork pot stickers - averageedamame - not sure how you could screw up edamame with saltThe edamame came out very quickly, and the dumplings and tuna were not far behind. The dinner was the most disappointing part of the evening. I don't expect the best food I have tasted at Tao, but with the price you pay it should be better than the average restaurant. We ordered the following for dinnerI had the Miso Roasted Black Cod . For $41 I expected a nice piece of fish. It was the smallest piece of fish I have ever been served. The worst part about it was 1/4 of it was dark meat. The skin was not on it so there should not have been any dark meat. It came with 2 long sticks on top of it. I think they were a vegetable, but everyone at the table tasted the stick and wanted to spit it back out. The side of cantonese cauliflower was averageMy friends hadCrispy Thai Pork - He said that it wasn't bad, but he could get better at his neighborhood thai restaurant for half of the price.Crispy Lobster Roll - She said that it was ok, but would never order it again.  Glazed Thai BBQ Chicken - Nothing special and very blandI plan on going back one more time to give this place another shot because it is a fun place to go with friends on the weekend for dinner.

Based on my experience during that situation I swore off Tao for a while until I felt I could welcome them with open arms again.The opportunity came when I saw the new location taking shape in my hood. Over the weeks leading up to the Grand Opening I saw the outside of the Maritime Hotel where Matsuri use to be slowly transition in the quintessential Tao decor outside: Bright red over-sized vessels, metal engraved doors and a whole host of Asian influenced images throughout the structure.After all the exclusive invites and parties were hosted in the first week, the regular folks like myself got a chance to make reservations. I made sure to keep it simple this time. A party of four for 11:30pm on a Saturday night. We got there at 11:15 and were not seated till around 12:15, yup about an hour later. I wanted to leave again, but I saw how crowded it was and that we were not alone, plus the major de trying to work with us so I kept my cool.Not to mention I got entertained while seeing a the random Halloween costumes that were coming to and fro.Once we got  pass all the Glamor of the restaurant and the bleacher style seating arrangement that I have not seen before we were ready to see what Tao was working with. Our eyes went all over the menu and the little Asian ramikin dolls that held our chopsticks were too cute not to miss. Now on to the food: Appetizer:Juju chicken  ( Now called Sweet Soy chicken) - A reasonable portion of some tasty cripsy honey glazed chicken. Definitely my favorite meat dish for the night.(check out the picks- it tastes as good as it looks)-California Roll- Authentic and fresh. We were seated right next to the Sushi station so I could see the guys  in action and they are very good at what they do.Entrees:-Spicy Red Snapper- A ok , I am not a fish lover so since it did not make me hurl I am ok-Shanghai fried rice- This presentation  was interesting because the rice was enveloped in a sheet of egg. Never saw that before.-Vegetable Fried Rice- Really good- Glazed Thai BBQ Chicken- This BBQ chicken was ok it did not hit the spot for me but with the fried rice and soy sauce it was ok -Chinese Broccoli & Cantonese Cauliflower- Done just right. Whatever sauce they put on the cauliflower is delicious!- Lamb chops which was TINNNNNNNY and not my favorite because I did not like the flavorDessert:-Chocolate Cake & Ginger Ice cream was a nice end.

BBQ Thai chicken- was very yummy had a slight tangy sweet taste and the chicken was all white meat(if that matters to you) tasted pretty goodAmbiance- it's a huge restaurant, we had slightly early reservations on a Saturday for 6:30 so it was just starting to get full with ppl. The restaurant is great for dates, birthdays, groups. They play a mix of music no one was dancing (guess it was too early) but the music wasn't overbearingly loud.Dessert- eh didn't love it at all. I  was debating on the warm chocolate cake, the shaved ice or the fortune cookie. I chose the chocolate cake ( I really regretted it, because it was so small) the chocolate cake was HARD only thing good about the dessert was the hot fudge in the middle, the ice cream made me thirsty(but it was tasty just felt very sticky in my mouth) blahhhh I'm a DESSERT LOVER and they failed on that.But overall I enjoyed my dinner there,I would go back again just to try a better dessert. And other entrees they had a lot of good choices I was interested in. But I don't eat a lot so I avoided wasting food.",1,0,0,Shanti H.,"Queens, NY",158,33,38
4.0,1/4/2014,"I'm a huge fan of this new space. The new TAO is huge, and gorgeous! I like the feel of the place being sexy, trendy, and the decor is amazing. It's located in the corner of the Maritime Hotel in Meatpacking. Perfect spot for dinner before going out the clubs. There is also the TAO lounge right outside sort of next to the dream hotel too. It's a bit small and somewhat low key. The food here is great. Sashimi platter, snapper, sea bass was one of my favorites. Alsways can't go wrong with sushi and tuni crispy rice. The black rice is also really good, definitely recommend this rice dish! All around the whole experience is great. Can't forget the dessert either, the fruit platter is full of refreshing fruits, sorbet is good, molten chocolate cake is really good and moist and melts in your mouth, but my favorite is the cherry orange blossom!! It's amazing, also topped with cotton candy. This dessert is fairly big so definitely share.",0,0,0,Christine T.,"San Francisco, CA",902,803,1042

2.0,12/28/2013,"Don't get me wrong...food was actually pretty good and the service was good too.  However, I did walk in with a party of about 12.  So I think we got more attention than normal.This place gets two stars from me personally because while the ambiance was definitely impressive....my reaction was...wow, they managed to make this place into an upscale cafeteria....seriously how many people can you fit into one restaurant was the goal in building this place.  The tables are on top of each other....pretty sceney, loud, and a bit pretentious for my taste....but if you are into that kinda stuff....this place is for you!Gets two stars for good food and service for party of 12+.",2,1,1,Yesenia E.,"Manhattan, NY",62,31,6
5.0,12/20/2013,"Came here for our office Holiday Party and i must say I was impressed with the decor, it was absolutely Gorgeous! I couldn't stop taking pictures! Even in the bathroom, very nicely decorated! I was in awe of everything being that this is one of the places that's supposedly hard to get into. On to the food, being that we had our own menu chosen by our bosses, everything was delicious! My ultimate favorite hands down was the Lobster Wonton!!! Where has this been all my life? It was really good! And the drinks were really good too! Even though i only had red wine, my coworkers said their mixed drinks were strong and good, just how they like it lol.And the staff was definitely very attentive and so nice, they were always on top of their game! I would definitely come back to this place again with my boyfriend and my girls ! Everything and everyone just has great vibes in here...right down to the music as well !",3,2,4,Renvie C.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",261,256,158
1.0,12/19/2013,"I came here with friends on a Saturday night for a birthday dinner. We arrived on time for our 11:30pm reservation, but we weren't seated until after midnight. We wanted to have a drink in the bar while we waited, but it was too crowded. Service was horrific. It took well over 10 minutes for anyone to come to our table to take drink orders, and longer for our drinks to actually arrive. We had to order our drinks and food at the same time. When our food came, the food runner brought it out and put the tray on a stand next to our table. He had to go back to get plates since we didn't have any on the table. By the time he found plates and returned, the food was cold. We were rushed constantly to finish eating. Someone took my (not empty) plate from under me while I had my chopsticks in my mouth. I had to go after him to get it back. It was like they couldn't get us out of the table fast enough. We only saw our server to take the drink/food order. No one came to ask how our food was.  Despite being cold, the food was good. It's nothing special - the typical Asian-fusion type of food you can get all over NY. We had salmon, beef, and chicken dishes, and a couple vegetable sides. Not super memorable, but tasty. The decor is lovely - they obviously put a lot of money and thought into it. The noise was deafening, between the loud music and the other 400 people yelling across their tables. It ended up being about $100 a person, which I don't think it was worth. We likely won't be back.",3,1,1,Taylor B.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",229,204,21
4.0,12/19/2013,"Went here a few weeks ago for a friend's birthday dinner. Aside from the club-like debacle at the front door with having to be on ""the list"" to even get in the door, the food was good and the service was impressive. Our waiters were attentive, accommodating and didn't rush us out given it was a very busy Saturday night. The atmosphere was super trendy and the music was my absolute favorite--old school hip-hop and Top 40. We danced in our seats!",1,0,0,Kristina K.,"Manhattan, NY",43,64,13
4.0,12/16/2013,"We had our holiday party here last week.  Amazing (and my goodness attractive!) service, amazing design, great sound system, and stellar food (with exception of the lo mein...which I found to be good, but standard)!  My ONLY qualm about the experience was how small the dance floor is.  My company is ginormous (in terms of employees), and I can't recall the last time I was so cramped in a dance space.  This is largely due to the biggest bar being in the middle of the dance floor.  I'd still highly recommend TAO Downtown for events and dining!",1,0,0,Christopher M.,"New York, NY",1591,1629,394
