4.0,4/30/2019,"Great sushi place and very fresh. The service was great and the menu has a lot of different options! Perfect for a date night or get together with friends, the place was crowded and worth it. Delicious sushi, definitely recommend it!",0,0,0,Gabrielle L.,"CHAMPIONS GT, FL",3,10,74
4.0,4/28/2019,Good atmosphere. Good service. Solid food. Reasonable prices. A good place to go if you're looking for these things in japanese food. Not necessarily a foodie's type japanese experience. I took my family here and my kids (ages 9 & 12) loved it.,0,0,0,Jera M.,"Lakewood, CA",0,7,4
2.0,4/27/2019,"I was super conflicted writing this review but My experience here was filled with mixed emotions. A friend and I got the Pulsd deal coming here and was super excited. I called ahead to make sure that we had a reservation and that we could sit in the restaurant with the ticket. When we checked in to sit I mentioned again to the host, who we later found out was the manager, that I had the Pulsd ticket. After we were seated I mentioned to the waitress that we hah this deal if it was a different menu. She then sent over the same manager that sat us and told us we had to get up and move to the bar/lounge. It was so embarrassing everyone around us was staring at us while this happened. I tried to explain that I called ahead and someone from their team assured me that we could sit in the restaurant with this and that we would have gone somewhere else if we had to sit in the bar area. It was rough.After we got seated in the bar area, the rest of the time was amazing. The food was great, phenomenal even. We had a few different tapas, a bottle of wine and dessert. The sushi was super fresh, and the cooked apps we had were hot crispy. The best thing we had the whole night was the fried cheesecake, it was insanely good. Our waitress was even super friendly and helpful by suggesting some good options. So over all. Service from management sucked but food was great.",0,0,0,Amanda D.,"New York, NY",103,56,91

4.0,3/27/2019,"Natsumi was next to our hotel so we liked the convenience, Looked up the reviews, and went there. We made a 5 o'clock reservation and were seated immediately by the window which was really nice. Martinis were good. We had the dumplings for a starter and they were delicious, also sushi which was yummy. Our entrées were the chicken teriyaki and steak teriyaki. The steak teriyaki was OK, the chicken teriyaki was better. We also ordered dessert - the fried cheesecake and chocolate cake, which of course we loved. How can you go wrong with that? The only complaint is that the staff seemed to hover near us and I believe it was because there was a cash register near us or supplies or something and being so small it seemed like maybe they were a little quick to get us on our way. Otherwise, great place.",0,0,0,L G.,"Land O Lakes, FL",0,1,0

1.0,3/16/2019,"So far, not good. Came to meet a friend for dinner, we had a reservation. I tell the woman at the tiny cramped space at the front that I have a reservation and she just waves her hand and mumbles something. Then 5-10 minutes later she tells me I have to wait in the right space for my friend at the door. I ask if I can be seated and she says no, it's our policy. What if I were one person coming for dinner - they wouldn't let me sit down and eat? Really? Anyway - she then says I can sit by the bar, in the area next door. That was an adventure! I sit down at the bar and the bartender gets me a glass of Mu. I asked him ""how long does sake last in the fridge"" he proceeds to tell me he opened it yesterday. I ask again, BC I'm curious to know how long an opened bottle of sake lasts in the fridge. I then say ""If I open a bottle of sake and put it in the fridge, how long would it last?"" He tells me ""now you're being facetious and condescending"". INSANE !!!",1,1,0,Karen M.,"New York, NY",38,177,185
3.0,3/11/2019,The online ordering service was great - easy and ready when i got there. My only issue was that the dumplings seemed to have soapy dishwater in the container. So that was a bummer. Rolls were great and fresh. Seaweed salad was a little weird but still tasty. So other than the soapy dumplings - pretty good. I'd probably give it another try.,0,0,0,Pam T.,"Plymouth, MA",0,1,0

4.0,2/28/2019,"Well , I was craving for sushi on thursday night so my boyfriend took me to natsumi which is near times square. My first impression as soon as I entered was the cute designs (small cute and cozy). So coming to the food we ordered chef's creation for two (Matsu) which cost us 95$ and got 2 appetizers ( salmon carpaccio and natsumi tempura roll) , a big platter of seasonal's best selection of sushi,sashimi and rolls and was also served with 2 glasses of cold sake which I think was a perfect combination for sushi.

3.0,2/22/2019,"Sushi was quite good, chicken and shrimp dumplings were amazing but that's about where it ends. We were sat at the ""kiddie section"" with 8:30pm reservations - kids kicking our booth for an hour. I get that it was a bit early for NYC but it wasn't early bird special early. We thought it would get better but around 10:00pm it became obvious that our section was the staging area for the next day's prep. Folding napkins, talking shop, employees taking advantage of employee discount meals...The restaurant is attached to a Hilton Garden Inn-like hotel and the bathrooms are located down a set of stairs adjacent to a continental breakfast cafeteria space. If you're looking for quality sushi at a reasonable price in NYC, this is your place. If you're looking to be seen or to show off, this is definitely not your place.",1,0,0,Mur A.,"Phoenix, AZ",35,16,5
2.0,2/22/2019,I'd say this place is 1.5 stars. We were trying to burn time until our next event. There weren't many food choices so we decided on Natsumi... but wish I had went to a ... CHAIN RESTAURANT... those are always my last resort when I can't find anything but... I spent the rest of the day trying to get the taste of Natsumi out of my mouth.

5.0,2/15/2019,"I am so glad I came here for valentine's day for a quality sushi dinner without tearing up my bank account.I had low expectations for this joint due to its price range. I, self-acclaimed amateur sushi connoisseur, felt the sashimi wasn't far apart from the Omakse grade sushi that I've had. My valentine and I ordered the Matsu meal for two. The waiter did inform us that the Matsu uses higher grade of sushi. The meal comes with a tempura roll, oyster appetizer, and a sushi/sashimi platter and two sake glasses. The Otoro and scallop was simply amazing!!!! Loved every bit of it.The rolls are average, but that's to be expected for that price. The restaurant is pretty good size for a sushi restaurant. It has mostly 2-person and 4-person tables, ideal spot for a date or double date.",2,0,0,Ling Q.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",378,85,87
3.0,2/13/2019,Good quality sushi. We sat by the bar and had a good time. We did the sushi for two and it was a lot of food. I think the overall quality of the fish was good but the taste is just ok for nigiris. I would stick with ordering rolls here. It's a more fusion restaurant so I think their actual sushi pieces are just ok.,0,0,1,Callie S.,"New York, NY",133,123,502
5.0,2/10/2019,"I love Natsumi! I decided to come here for my 23rd birthday and it was perfect. The atmosphere is trendy, sophisticated and modern. The food is delicious. I had rock shrimp for an appetizer, for dinner I had a spicy oyster roll and a seafood tempura roll. My friend had a gluten allergy and they provided gluten free soy sauce. The regular soy sauce is very salty so a little soy sauce goes a long way. Natsumi also has a separate bar, after dinner we went to the bar section and had drinks. I had a peach surrender and it was very good. Natsumi is on the expensive side so for an appetizer and 2 hand rolls and 1 drink it would be 45 dollars. The food is worth it and if youre going to celebrate an occasion it is well worth the price. I will be back.",1,0,0,Briana W.,"Ramsey, NJ",1,35,2

2.0,2/7/2019,Quality of sashimi is good. We have been at this place several times because it is close to some of the theaters we subscribe. This time we had an Open Table reservation as usual at 6:00 PM. We arrived ten minutes before 6:00 PM . The hostess did not recognized my reservation name and kept us waiting a long time complaining and shouting that I had no reservation and stated that she had no table for the two of us when there were plenty of tables available. I insisted that I was a regular customer and finally in her ineptitude found my name on the Open Table list. But still she told me that she had no tables available. The one of the chefs at the counter recognized me and invited me to seat at the counter. We did and had a nice sashimi dinner. During our dinner the manager arrived and asked how was everything. I told him the story and told him he meds to train his personnel. He mentioned that the hostess was new. But still she rejected us when we had a reservation. I don't feel like going back there. The chefs at the counter were nice and serviceable. I restricted my 20 percent tip to the chefs at the counter.,0,0,0,Juan C.,"Yonkers, NY",0,4,0

3.0,1/30/2019,"This is the best option for sushi delivery near Rockefeller Center. The Natsumi Nigiri set is great; the Chirashi not so, but decent. I wouldn't go here if I had the option to go anywhere, but within the universe of corporate Seamless, this is the only sushi I will order.

2.0,1/22/2019,"Terrible service. Plates were dirty, all of them standing around and bring us anything and seemed to be tending to other tables. In addition the couple next to us arrived 15 min after we ordered and got their food before us... it was just ridiculous. My water wasn't refilled until I put the last bite of sushi in my mouth. In addition we were near the sushi bar so all the people working there can easily see our table from where they were hanging out. Kind of felt like we were discriminated in an odd way. Also, We made reservations on open table and the old man working (not sure if he was the owner) didn't seem to find it or know how to look for it. Thankfully there was space open so we didn't have to wait. Sushi wasn't terrible and that's why I gave them 2 stars.

4.0,1/3/2019,"So, pre-theatre and lots of positive and negative reviews, so was cautiously optimistic.  Was not disappointed!  Starting with real loose leaf green tea in cast iron teapots, a good sign!We were tempted by the Toro Lounge entree -- I have not seen this combo many places, and it was outstanding!  We then split a bunch of regular rolls (we aren;t as big on the wild and crazy rolls, but prefer classic sushi.  Everything was fresh and well prepared -- most rolls had ample cuts of fish (yellowtail rolls were a bit skimpy, but fish was good).  Spicy crunchy salmon roll was superb.  Prices were very fair, given what we got.If you are going to the theatre, check their website for specials (we had complimentary desserts... a nice bonus!)Would definitely return!",0,0,0,David T.,"Stamford, CT",0,33,6

4.0,12/9/2018,"Brought my NY team here for a holiday dinner. We didn't have a reservation but they managed to find us a table on a Friday night and we were seated right away. Located across the street from The Gershwin and several hotels so it gets crowded fast. The cocktail menu features classics mixed with an Asian twist. Green tea Margarita, Lycheetini were two we tried. The food is described and Asian fusion with an Italian flare. Very interesting combinations. We ordered up a bunch of appetizers, hot & cold and A TON of sashimi. Rock Shrimp tempura, hamachi carpaccio, Miso black Cod, Natsumi tempura roll, some other rolls, hand rolls and the Chef's selection. So much food! Everything was delicious. Large cuts of sashimi (1 piece per order) and fantastic flavor in everything we had.Getting to the restrooms down the steep staircase can be quite treacherous after a martini if you are wearing heels but we all survived. :) I think everyone enjoyed their food and a good time was had by all. Dinner ran over $300 so on the pricey side for things you could get for less elsewhere, however it's about standard for NYC. if you're looking for a nice night out with good portions it's worth it.

4.0,11/4/2018,"Food: 8/10Service: 4/10Atmosphere: 8/10Natsumi drew me in with a more inventive sushi menu than most, without seeming too gimmicky (use of mango, apple, and basil is fun and inventive... gold leaf is fun but obviously pure gimmick).  In addition to some interesting drinks that sounded refreshing on a hot day, my wife and I also tried two ""simple"" rolls (Eel Cucumber and King Crab Avocado)  and two more highfalutin rolls (Natsumi Roll, Gold Leaf Roll).  The food and drinks were really nice, and we enjoyed our time in a private booth amidst the traditional Japanese meets midtown chic environment.  That said, we may have caught a shift change, because the service was awfully disjointed, and I'm fairly certain we were completely forgotten about for about 45 minutes.  Overall though, the menu is really cool and the execution is pretty solid - I'll take a service experience as a one-off and recommend Natsumi for a craving squash if you need sushi in Time Square or Midtown.",0,0,0,Ryan S.,"Peachtree City, GA",0,49,206
3.0,11/2/2018,"My family and I visited for a late lunch/early dinner. The majority of us ordered sushi. The sushi rolls were good. Inside is small and has a very modern decor. The restaurant is adjacent to a hotel bar. First thing I noticed after sitting down was my water glass was dirty. The sushi menu has a ton of different rolls and combinations to choose from. The sushi is very filling. The fish was fresh, for the most part. I ordered a la carte o-toro and the fish came out very cold and icy. Because of this, the toro had very little flavor. This was a huge disappointment considering it's a premium cut. This was by far the worst toro I've ever had. It wasn't fresh.Quality, but affordable sushi is hard to come by in the city. If you want satisfying sushi rolls then Natsumi isn't a bad choice. But, if you want quality cuts of fish you're better off planning an omakase experience.

3.0,9/10/2018,"Read the reviews and came in wanting to love this place. It's cute but small - ate in the bar. Good service from the friendly bartender. Sadly the food was just ok - the calamari appetizer was ok but not tempura coating - more like what you get at an Italian restaurant- and a little over cooked. The grilled beef short rib appetizer was very tasty and tender. The Red Sea sushi roll ( shrimp tempura and  other ingredients I can't remember because I only ate one bite ) this roll was so disappointing bc it tasted like the shrimp tempura had been prepared way too early. It was cold and not crunchy. Not much flavor or good texture. We left it mostly uneaten and the server and I think, the owner came by but never asked if something wasn't right with the roll. Definitely won't be back. Very mediocre meal.",0,0,0,Cynthia A.,"Malibu, CA",9,173,163

The spicy tuna tempura roll was beyond SUBPAR...lacked flavor and was low-quality fish. Only had two bites before deciding it wasn't worth the calories. The manager or owner came over and asked if everything was ok, we said yes, but she didn't inquire why we only ate two bites (a clear sign of an unhappy customer). She was more interested in her regulars who were at the bar than unhappy customers.

The sauces were delicious!  The green tea gnocchi, the only thing on the menu that seemed to have any Italian influence, wasn't my favorite - there was something about the creamy green tea sauce that was kind of cloying.  I also loved that we had a choice of 6 different bottles of wine.  Without a deal, this restaurant was kind of pricey, but completely comparable to anything else in this neighborhood.",0,0,0,Karen A.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,14,7

There was definitely toro in there as the fish really had a great, smooth, melt-in-your-mouth texture.The edamame was warm, but not hot. It was cooked well enough so that the beans pop out, but not with the innards of the pod. The ikura was firm, but not hard.  They popped in your mouth very easily and were not overwhelmed by too much sushi rice - just enough for a single, big bite.  The uni was room temperature and also had a melt-in-your-mouth texture. The only problem I had was that they didn't have quail eggs. If you're gonna play with the big sushi boys, you gotta have quail eggs.The sake is super-expensive - beware. One can drink oneself into a high-interest debt problem.Service was friendly, professional, attentive, and prompt.

But hey, the sushi is fresh and good, and given the location, it's one of the better options out there.My friend and I came at 6pm (show was at 8pm), and it was already packed with the theater crowd which was all tourists. The restaurant is definitely trying a little too hard, for example, they have a bottle of wine on each table. Guaranteed NO ONE buys it, stop trying to be fancy. Anyway, my friend and I shared the tuna pizza which was good, and I had a maki combo with a spicy tuna roll, spicy crunchy salmon roll, and an eel avocado roll, all paired with a glass of wine. Price-wise it was definitely more than I usually pay (maki combos usually range from $14-$19 and include a soup or salad, this one was almost $20 with no soup or salad).

2.0,2/1/2018,"Been doing restaurant all week and every place I've been to has been outstanding. Unfortunately ended this week on a lower note with Natsumi. I came because their restaurant week menu sounded excellent but honestly it was underwhelming to say the least. Came right before a show and had a reservation. Service was professional and I was seated right away, decor was nice, close to subway.For my meal I ordered the restaurant week items and an order of uni nigiri and sawara. It was nice that you could just order 1 piece of nigiri at once.1) Trio carpaccio: 3 pieces of each fish (tuna, hamachi, salmon) with some sauce on top. Most of the sauces were too salty and didn't compliment the fish at all. They tasted like sauces I've had at all you can eat places that they just dump on rolls to cover up the taste. Not actively bad, just not good. Out of the three the hamachi one was the most edible. (2.5/5)2) Sushi combo: 5 pieces of nigiri including tuna, salmon, albacore, flue, and one unknown and a 5 piece tuna roll w/ salmon, avocado, and spicy mayo on top. The roll was fine but tasted like something you could pick from any run-of-the-mill Americanized sushi shop. The nigiri didn't have much done to it (just some scallions or sriracha), no wasabi either. They were cut well but otherwise pretty meh. Rice had good flavor but was overcooked. Fish was extremely flavorless. (2/5)3) Uni nigiri: For about $6 a piece, it's just an all around standard piece of nigiri. Not too bitter though not particularly sweet either. Just fine. (3.5/5)4) Sawara nigiri: This may have been the worst piece of nigiri I've had in my life. It tastes like fish that has been left out to dry for half a day. I literally could not chew half of it and had to spit it out. (0/5)5) Cheesecake Tempura: Well fried but cheesecake is already kind of dry so the tempura didn't really work with it. I would have gone for tempura ice cream instead.Overall, I just can't understand how this place has 4 stars.

4.0,12/28/2017,"Overall, this place was a pleasant experience. They also are currently having a Groupon promotion to receive 15% cash back on your first purchase there. Just swiped my card last night so we'll see how the deal applies. Pros: The aesthetic of this place is very charming, especially during the holiday season with all the lights strung up. It's a Japanese sushi lounge feel and it's lively, yet allows for conversation. It's also in a busy area of the city and is connected to a hotel. Cons: The service is quite strange... I was only there that night so it could have just been my experience with one particular server, but he was all up in my friend's face when we were ordering. When I say that, I mean inches away from her face. She was a bit taken aback. He also kept interrupting our meal to try and take away our appetizer before noticing there was still food in there. He was lowkey pushy, and slightly darty eyed. I was just a bit uncomfortable, I felt like they wanted us to eat and leave ASAP. After they brought us the check I will say they did let us sit there for a solid extra 40 mins to just catch up since I felt like they took our plates away extremely fast.  The food is slightly above average. The crispy calamari tasted and felt more like calamari nuggets than calamari. The shrimp and scallop shumai were pretty decent. The California and shrimp tempura roll were good, but not as flavorful as they should be on their own. They did have good sauces though that paired well. Price was slightly above average, but was expected.",2,0,0,Sarah C.,"New York, NY",396,144,193

2.0,12/7/2017,"I'm not sure how this place has such high ratings, 4 stars? This was literally the most sub par sushi ever, the type you get at a 2 dollar sign restaurant but with 3 dollar sign prices. Everyone remember Mays Place on 2nd Ave that burned down? It was basically that in a fancier setting, pricier location, and higher prices (and TBH I think Mays Place was better than this). The service was EH, nothing outstanding. There was no hostess working when I walked in so I waited a few minutes before a waiter came and seated me. I sat at the bar and the bar seats were of terrible quality. They seat caved in and was not comfortable at all, how you have such seats at your ""fancy"" 3 dollar sign restaurant blows my mind.I ordered the Tekka Don, it came with 5 slices of Toro atop a bowl of rice which again was EH. Everything about this restaurant was EH, save yourself the trouble and go elsewhere.

I would come back just for the gnocchi. The dumplings and shrimp tempura were well made, but average in taste. The tuna tataki had nice balance of acidic and sweet flavor and subtle crunch from the fish roe topping. The seating is really cozy in both the restaurant and the bar.

The only good item was the Shrimp Spring Roll. That was good as an appetizer, but everything else was pretty bland. Even the wasabi was sweet tasting. It was funky. The staff was pretty rude to the guy next to us. Told him to get his last call of food in before 10:30, even though they were closing at 11. He said he didn't like being rushed since it was only 10:25. So a manager came out and said they had all been there since 11am and it wasn't uncommon to close the kitchen. Said, ""most people don't have a problem with it.""  This pissed the guy off. The bathroom was cleaned at 10:20 and then LOCKED.

My girlfriend ordered the beef teriyaki. The beef was very tender. We also ordered an order of king crab dumplings and rock shrimp tempura. Both appetizers delish.

If you just want a nice dinner without eating 3000 calories or spending $300, this is a great option. They can be busy so be warned.

4.0,7/31/2017,"I came here with my boyfriend on Saturday night around 7:00pm after spending the whole day in the city. As it was my first time to the city, and his second, we were unsure where we wanted to go for dinner and were overwhelmed by all our options. Upon seeing that Natsumi was close in proximity to us, we debated for a few minutes and decided to go, only hesitating because of the $$$ marking. We did not realize that there was a separate entrance to the restaurant and the bar/lounge. We went into the bar/lounge entrance and after we were asked if we had a reservation and we responded no, we were told we could take a seat in the lounge. We were a little thrown off; however, there was only one other table sitting in the lounge, so we sat down on a couch with two small tables in front. Though we were not expecting this initially and were hesitant at first, my boyfriend and I were both happy to take a load off and relax on the small, comfortable couch while having some sushi. I couldn't see how busy the restaurant side was on a Saturday night or if they could have taken us, but we enjoyed  that the lounge was quiet and not filled with lots of loud people after our long day. We ordered the chicken and shrimp dumplings, which were to die for! They were simply the best dumplings my boyfriend or I had ever had. Perfectly cooked without being gummy and with the nicest little crunch. Delicious! We also ordered a spicy tuna roll, a spicy crunchy salmon roll, and a California roll. None of these blew our minds, they were all good enough but we both felt that the seaweed was a little too chewy; I would still recommend the spicy crunchy salmon roll. Though they have a $$$ marking, we did not find it to be terribly expensive and had a very filling dinner for two for less than $50.

2.0,7/20/2017,"I made a reservation since it was in close proximity to the Broadway show we were going to see that night. We were running late for our reservation. I called ahead to inform them and there was no issue. As we walked in, I noticed a nice bar and what appeared to be a lounge. I said out loud, ""Where are the tables?"" Turns out, Natsumi has a separate lounge section. The restaurant was across the hall. As we walked in, we noticed it was small and wasn't quite as vibrant as the pictures on the website suggested.Once we were seated, we pondered over what rolls and entrees to order. We started with the dragon roll, which contains smoked eel, avocado, kani and kaiware. I ordered chicken teriyaki and my wife went with the Chilean sea bass. The dragon roll took forever to come out. At one point, we noticed a couple, who came in roughly 15-20 minutes after us, receive their roll before us. I started looking around with a confused look on my face. One of the servers must of noticed because he approached us and apologized for the wait. Apparently, the dragon roll takes a little bit longer because of the way it is prepared. If we were told that when ordering, we would have expected the wait time. I will say that when it finally came out, we definitely enjoyed it.As for the entrees, they were lackluster. The Chilean sea bass was good, but it didn't have much flavor. The chicken teriyaki was a little dry. It wasn't horrible, but I've certainly experienced better.  The highlight of our dining experience were our drinks and the dragon roll. I ordered the Dragonberry Crush, which is bacardi dragonberry, lime, strawberry puree and a splash of prosecco and my wife ordered the Sapphire Crush, which is malibu rum, hypnotiq and pineapple juice. Both were really good drinks.Overall, the service could have been better. The only attentive person in the restaurant was the individual who ensured our glasses were filled with water. Other than that, we were serviced by a total of three different people and only one seemed to be helpful. The next time we're going to see a show, we'll go elsewhere for dinner.

I came in at 8 pm on a Thursday and it was quite busy but I believe there were tables available for walk-in. I sat at the bar and ordered nigiri a la carte. I had seven pieces, ranging from salmon to sea urchin. Selection for sushi is typical and prices are average.I watched the chefs at the bar-- these dudes have to hustle, which was fun and stressful to watch. It took about 15 minutes for my sushi to come out.Of my pieces, flavor- and freshness wise, a couple were very good, two were unacceptable, and the rest were fine. The pieces are cut very long compared to their squished-up rice ball perch. The sushi rice is not gross but not great.Service was good. My order ran $30 before tax and tip, though you could do their various suhi combinations to get out of here for cheap.

3.0,6/7/2017,"We went in for a quick dinner before a show on Wednesday evening without a reservation.  The restaurant seemed crowded, but we got sat right away.  We spent some time on the menu, then decided to consult with our server on deciding which 2 people sushi chef's creation.  We were told that ""Take"" comes with one cold appetizer, sashimi, and sushi versus ""Matsu"" which comes with one cold appetizer, one hot appetizer, sashimi, sushi, and better quality of fish.  Both options come with chilled sake, which we asked to exchange with warm sake without any issue.  We ended up ordering ""Matsu"" option.  The cold appetizer is 4 pieces of salmon ceviche covered in strong vinegar dressing, which I did not like due to the strong taste of vinegar which I thought was used to cover the bad quality of the fish and its smell.  Hot appetizer was a fried sushi roll with fish, crab sticks, asparagus, and other veg covered in teriyaki sauce and wasabi mayo sauce on other side of the plate.  Entree comes with 6 pieces of sashimi, 6 pieces of sushi, and a spicy mayo roll in the middle.The size was decent that we both felt full at the end of meal.  Overall, the service was attentive.  The servers took our orders quickly and the food came out quickly.  There were staff that kept refilling the water and the servers were nearby but not disruptive so you can have private conversations.  They also let you sit for as long as you want until you are ready to close your tab and leave.  We discovered that because after the server cleaned up our table and we said no to desserts, he left until we had to ask for check again.  However, the food was okay.  Nothing to get excited about and nothing to be upset about either.  Nothing was memorable about the food taste and quality.",0,0,1,Stanley K.,"Manhattan, NY",6,82,82

We ordered the tuna tartare which was really good, however they had a white gelatin like thing on top that's suppose to make it look like ice, I was not a big fan of that.  We also ordered the natsumi sushi set and a shrimp tempura roll.  The appetizer and the sushi set should be enough for two but that night I was really hungry.  The Natsumi sushi set comes with 2 tuna, 2 salmon, 2 yellowtail, 2 eel, 2 super white tuna, 2 tobiko, california roll, yellowtail jalapeno roll, spicy titanic special roll.  The sushi set not only looks appealing but it also tasted delicious.  Everything was fresh and they were not cheap with their fish.  As for dessert, we had the chocolate saucy cake. This cake was really rich, moist and creamy.  It reminds me of a chocolate lava cake and a thicker version of a chocolate mousse, because they had a warm dark chocolate ganache in the middle.  All I was missing was some ice cream. It does come with some whipped cream though.  We also ordered 2 cocktails; the natsumi sling and the rising sun-gria, recommendations by our server.  I am indifferent about the drinks because they were nothing special to me.  The natsumi sling tasted like soap to me but my boyfriend said it was okay.  The service was great and our server was able to answer all my questions and gave me recommendations.  He didn't rush us and he was really nice.",1,0,0,Eileen Z.,"New York, NY",232,123,326

I always have a good time when coming here because service is great and sushi is fresh. Wait-time: always crowded after work hours so there may be a wait, but you usually get a seat within max 15 min or so, if you make a reservation then there is generally no wait.Ambiance: dim lighting but environment feels lively and decor is modern, sleek and clean.Food: I ordered the Rainbow roll, and a miso soup, as did my friend and both came very timely and we waited about 10 mins after we ordered. We also ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio which came in an ice bucket and was refilled in our glasses promptly by the waiter. Most of the recent reviews have said that their service is slow but I can't complain at all with the timely service I received, so I think it varies and shouldn't be a factor in deciding to come here.Overall: I would absolutely recommend Natsumi to any of my friends who are looking for a great sushi restaurant in the midtown area.",2,0,1,Sandra C.,"Queens, New York, NY",281,24,36

So we waited for 7-8 minutes feeling so unsure, and then he seated us !Mind you  no reservations! The table setting had a nice wine bottle and a candle which was so romantic! Then we were served by a man named tony! He had all the knowledge about the foods and i gave him a hint saying it was my girlfriend's birthday, the food was delicious with a reasonable price.

If you usually eat all you can eat sushi this place will seem very pricey and the sushi will taste amazing. If you are used to really great sushi (i.e. Japan or good vancouver/Seattle sushi like Miku) you will probably find this average  and a touch on the pricey side for the quality.So why 4 stars? If you are looking for good sushi in the theater district this was good sushi.  I love good sushi and actively avoid all you can eat sushi joints. The smoked salmon and seared tuna were our favorites. They had a better than average selection of not only sushi but also other dishes as well (soft shell crab, yellowtail carpaccio). I love hamachi (yellowtail) .The wasabi and pickled ginger is mild (they clearly expect crowds who may not be ready for the really awesome sinus clearing wasabi).Service was friendly but average.

There was a fairly appropriate amount of fish for the cost, but it's still a little too pricey.

The roll was delicious and had 3 different toppings on different pieces, so it was a nice variety. The fish was very fresh. The sorbet was delicious.

Last week, after getting seated and waiting for 10 mins, I had to draw someone's attention to get a menu. The food came at different tones for everyone.

We were also seated at a bar style table which is most likely not normally used for groups. Oh well, let's move on and enjoy this. I have been here a few times and always enjoy the food. Rock shrimp is always a great option. Edamame dumplings are not my thing although some people do like them. For sushi, I got the special roll with gold leaf, tuna and mango. Very good! Also got a few simple rolls to share. All in all I am happy with this place.

5.0,12/13/2016,"Stopped by for a quick dinner here before a comedy show and I have to say, it was definitely worth the stop. We had actually tried a few restaurants next door but were refused because we didn't have reservations. Now, I understand this was our fault and had no right to judge because it was 6 pm on a Saturday and it's always busy around then, especially around the holidays and around theater district. Anyway, we walked in and were seated right away. We ordered food and drinks, all which were delicious and reasonably priced for nyc. I still crave the yellowtail jalapeño roll and would love to go back just to have it again. At the end of our visit, we were very kindly asked to switch tables so a larger group can have ours and waitress offered 3 drinks on the house which we obviously could not pass up. Although moving was inconvenient, it was done in a very classy manner and I appreciated that. Overall, this place was amazing and the vibe was just right. Cute, cozy, trendy!

Score!  We had couple of glasses of the red on happy hour, then had some delightful snackings from the happy hour menu, and since those were so good we decide to grab to rolls before the kitchen closed.  Everything was very tasty and the bartender was friendly and nice.  Would definitely come again if I lived there.",2,0,0,Heather R.,"Austin, TX",30,38,88

1.0,12/5/2016,"So, this past Sunday, a friend from out of town and I, from Jersey came into NYC to do some shopping. When we got hungry I immediately suggested NATSUMI. I work in the area and NATSUMI is always my go to when asked. I recommend it always. The chef and bartenders are great. When we arrived I noticed all the bar seats at the back wall had reserved seating signs and all the low cushy seats at the side we also reserved, so my friend and I squeezed passed some ladies sitting at the bar to seat ourselves at the smallest table in the world. We did plan on eating so I wasnt sure how this was going to work, but we'd try to make the best of it. We had shopping bags, everyone had big coats over the backs of their seats so it was a tight squeeze in that corner.  The bartender took our drink orders, I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. The drinks came and then it was a problem to keep myself seated without toppling over our drinks and causing havoc in that corner. Listen I am a big person, 5'8"" 235 lbs. I was not really built for that table, so after about 15 mins of being ridiculously uncomfortable, my pocket book fell, my friend had to pick it up for me because if I moved I couldn't get back up on the stool without a problem. I asked the waitress if we could be moved to another seat, maybe at two of the 10 empty seats at the back bar, she said she would ask the manager. I saw her speak to him. She came back to say, those seats are reserved after a certain time, so she could not or would not accommodate us as per management. Oh, did I mention this was one of my favorite restaurants in the city???Now, If I'm already there, already a patron. Ordered drinks and waiting for food and the other tables are empty, Wouldn't the right thing to do be to accommodate me by looking to see which reserved table or bar seat had a later reservation? Why does the bar area even have reservations? That should be for people walking in off the street. Anyway, the other patrons at the bar scooched down to make space for us to sit together at the bar where it was more comfortable. So I want to thank those guys for having the right Holiday spirit and being sweet enough to help make us comfortable. The management at NATSUMI not so much. I'm sure I can find another Sushi Bar in Manhattan just as good and accommodating to its customers when they say the seating is not comfortable. Oh, and I have to add, the reserved tables were still empty when we left at 6:00pm. We got there around 4:30pm hungry and tired. All we wanted was a comfortable seat to relax, eat and have a drink. I didn't think that was alot to ask from a restaurant. Unless, they only prefer patrons of a certain size. I would have left earlier if I didn't want my friend to try the Sushi so badly. But sadly that was my last time at NATSUMI and I will let my other NY friends know how disgusting we were treated there.  Did I mention this WAS my favorite Sushi restaurant in NY.",0,0,0,Denita R.,"Plainfield, NJ",0,3,0

This place is cute and trendy with tables, high tops, a long full bar and couches. It was fairly empty, which leads me to believe that this place is a bit of a hidden gem. We were seated promptly and were told about the happy hour specials. Our waitress was attentive enough, but I have to give it to the busboy(?) who was running around filling all the water glasses and taking drink orders. Wine was $6, so of course we guzzled down a few. For food we ordered the sampler with 2 hot appetizer & 1 roll. We went with ribs, chicken and spicy crunchy salmon. AMAZING. Seriously, so nice we did it twice lol Yes, we shamelessly reordered like the fatties we are deep down. Our waitress apparently forgot to put in our initial order of shrimp so we waited hungrily without a word from her about it. Eventually it came out with the second sampler (we ordered it with the first) and all was right with the world because we were in Natsumi bliss. Amazing pricing if you come during happy hour, and it's a super cute date night spot for a drink and bite after a show.

It was packed, but still so intimate and private while enjoying our dinner - even in close quarters typical in NY restaurants. When we came in there was a bit of a wait - but again without a reservation this was expected - but we did not wait long at all, in fact a couple that did reserve came in right after us, and we were seated before them (hehehe xD) The sushi was served fresh and very presentable - the sake we ordered came in such a pretty dispenser that kept it cool - and I swear, the soy sauce was the most delicious soy sauce I had ever tasted - it might have been because I was starving and in awe, but I still get flash backs of tasting it with my chopstick before the sushi arrived :) ... Very classy place as well judging off the other present customers - and attire. Prices are pretty high comparable to other sushi bars - but it's more than likely the location you're paying for of course, the quality is definitely there as well though.

While it's not cheap (my piece of fatty tuna/toro sashimi was $10), the quality of the fish is undeniably high. I wasn't blown away by the appetizers and dessert. My $3 apiece green tea lobster ravioli were skinny and underwhelming--neither the green tea nor lobster flavor was very present. The tiramisu was subpar as well; it's basically just a lot of cream piled onto a soft crust with a tiny bit of green tea flavor mixed in.While the servers were very kind, the service was incredibly slow.

4.0,5/22/2016,"We came here for dinner before our broadway show. They were very accommodating when we had to add an extra person to our reservation last minute. For slightly above average quality sushi this is a good place to go to. Though, of course, this doesn't compare to second tier sushi like that in Hatsuhana and definitely not for third tier sushi like in the choice omakase's.  I had the sushi regular which was not bad. The tuna sushi color was a bit on the lighter pink side which I disliked (always should be suspicious if it is too pink) but my tuna roll came out a dark red. I also ordered additional pieces such as the sea urchin, which tasted fine. It wasn't fishy and was creamy. The ikura sushi was below average in construction...the rice to ikura ratio was off so it ended up being way salty. Also their scallop sushi...the scallop wasn't as sweet or melt in your mouth as that in the chelsea market's. Overall, it was tasty but definitely doesn't touch some of the high quality sushi meals i've had. For this price point, I would rather go to the chelsea market if I had the choice if by food alone but you also pay for ambience and service here.",0,0,0,Janet K.,"Quincy, MA",0,68,3

Service, food, and cocktails were all very good here. Had the Ginger cosmo - just the perfect amount of ginger. We had the king crab dumplings, miso cod, spicy oyster roll, spicy rock shrimp roll, a variety of sashimi including the omelette, snow crab and spicy tuna. All were very good. For dessert we had the Godiva chocolate martinis and the banana roll. Everything was excellent. Note - when you order the miso cod, there are bonita flakes on it. They move around a little, which can look a bit creepy at first, it's only because of the heat from the cod.

Alcohol and water.. Plus in my book! We ordered the rock shrimp tempura, the king crab dumplings, and the sushi sashimi dinner set..Loved everything! The rock shrimp tempura was perfect! The shrimp were huge! I can see someone ordering this as their entree which isn't a bad idea.. The lightly fried tempura had just the right crunch.. Only thing was there wasn't as much spicy mayo as we would have liked but they did bring us extra per request so that made up for it.. I loved the king crab dumplings.. The way they look, they almost reminded me of soup dumplings I really enjoyed them.. Very tasty and so light.. I can see myself eating about 35 of them in one sitting hahahaThe sushi and sashimi was so fresh.. As others have indicated in previous reviews they were very happy with the quality of the fish and so was I.. They were nice cuts and it also came with two rolls ..

After enduring dinner here, I played angry songs on my phone the whole way home.  Once I got home, I immediately made a grilled cheese sandwich hoping that it would help me forget. I tried to have sushi and sake at the bar. The bartender was nice, it's not her fault.  I ordered some nigiri and a roll.  The fish felt and tasted like it had been through a several freeze-thaw cycles. It was practically a mercy that the slices of fish were so miserly. The rice was very cold, and compressed into dense little bricks. The nori was very chewy.  When it came to the scallop nigiri, I couldn't make myself swallow it. I left it in a little napkin purse next to the ginger. The dinner including a half carafe of sake cost almost $80. For this amount of cash, I could have gone to Tanoshi, and had rice fit to eat.

Everything tasted fresh and it was more than enough for the two of us. The menu also had plenty of other interesting items worth trying. Of note, things are a tad bit overpriced. The sake menu especially; we chose one of the cheapest options, a 300mL bottle of junmai ginjo, and it was almost $30.The waitstaff was friendly and helpful. At the end of the meal, I only asked them to place a candle on a slice of cake to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday, but they went above and beyond - they sang happy birthday and gave us the dessert on the house!

Large pieces of fish and a good portion to split among two. Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, spicy tuna roll, all standard sushi fare, but still fresh and good portion size for the price ($25). For a sushi bar, the menu is extensive and very good! SERVICE: Standard, nothing lacking, but nothing outstanding.

1.0,3/17/2016,"I work very close to Natsumi but had never been.  After reading the many favorable Yelp reviews, I decided to give it a try for dinner.  The space is decent (although cramped) and the prices are ok; the food came out fairly quickly after we ordered.  That's about all I can say on the positive side.  We started out with the shrimp and scallop shumai.  They were dried out and pretty tasteless.  Some of the worst shumai I've had.  We then had the Natsumi Sushi Set for two.  At least, that's what we ordered.  Instead, they brought us the Natsumi Sushi Sashimi Set for two.  That was fine, mistakes happen.  I told them that it was the wrong entree and explained that we had ordered the Sushi Set.  They said no problem, they'd fix it but it would be a few minutes.  No problem on our end, we had time.  A different woman then came over to our table and said something like ""it's ok if we give you a spicy tuna roll and eel roll instead of a yellowtail and california roll"" (which is what our entree was supposed to come with).  I told her that we wanted the rolls that we had ordered, which they accepted, but did not seem to be happy about it.  I was pretty shocked that after they messed up our order they were asking us to take something different (she wasn't really asking).  In most places, if they messed it up, they would probably give you a roll or two from the platter they had made to eat while waiting for the corrected order.  In any event, our correct order came out about 10 minutes later.  The reason for the 1 star is not the bad service.  Rather, the sushi is just very low quality.  The sushi rice was dried out, not moist.  The fish also seemed dry and not flavorful.  The sushi at Iroha on 49th b/n 6th and 7th Ave's is way, way better.  Also, I had read that Natsumi was owned by the owner of Haru.  While I do not love Haru, the sushi there is way, way better than at Natsumi.

2.0,12/22/2015,"Was excited to eat here based on the reviews, however was disappointed with the food.  Service was very friendly and accommodating.  Coming from the west coast, my standards for sushi and Japanese cuisine is on the high side.  We ordered a very simple meal, typically easy to produce high quality as we were being cautious.  The hamachi and spicy tuna was average at best.  The steak teriyaki and salmon were over cooked and very dry (even though we asked for a medium preparation).  Overall, I would recommend others to go elsewhere and if you are from California don't expect the same quality sushi in New York.",0,0,0,Mike F.,"San Diego, CA",2,112,8

I'd pass on the spring rolls, they were pretty ordinary.I got the toro sushi platter - 4 stars (instead of 5) because the sushi pieces were really delicious and tender but the tuna roll that came with the dish was sub par.

They texted me to confirm,I requested to change reservations to 6pm. When we got closer, we realized it was the night of the tree lighting & security was extra tight last night. Road blocks everywhere. Ended up parking and we ran in heels for a few blocks. Got to the restaurant close to 7pm and the host was so kind to still provide a table for us at a really cool spot close to the window corner which could seat 3-4ppl. We were so excited. 2 girls ordering like we haven't eaten in days. Ordered 3 appetizers tuna martini tartare - forgot the nameSteamed king crab shrimp dumplings and seafood ceviche. We would've ordered the ravioli but they ran out!! All of the above was Delish... Girlfriend ordered the green tea margarita and I went for the lychee infused sake  I loved it so we had another round!! Ordered the sushi sashimi combination (had a nice variety of sushi, sashimi and rolls) and also ordered the hamachi jalapeño roll.  We stuffed our faces within 40 mins and ended w shots of silver patron!! As I told my friend...I felt like we just anti-bacterialized our esophagus all the way down to our stomach!! we were rushing to get to our Broadway show at 8. Not the restaurants fault.. As we were extremely late for our dinner reservation. The waiter kindly asked us to sit for a moment... And they brought out a complimentary chocolate mousse cake for my girl's bday!!!!

4.0,11/3/2015,"Lapin and I came here for dinner on a Tuesday night. We had made reservations according to the LivingSocial voucher. We made reservations for 6:30pm but we still had to wait even though there was seats in the back. When we were finally seated, they gave us these two tiny side seats but that could barely fit one of my butt cheek (sorry..for the image).The waitress came over and filled our water within 5 minutes of us sitting down. When I pulled out the voucher, she yelled ""LivingSocial"" three times loudly while pointing to us, like we were the plague.  According to the voucher, the deal was only good in the bar and lounge area, however, we were not told that when we made the reservation and assumed they knew when they seated us. We were moved into the bar and sat awkwardly in this white table with sleek adult high chairs. We were given the menu but no water or acknowledgment.  Finally, the manager came over and moved us to the couch near the window. It was a bit squashed because this loud and rowdy group who were talking over Rodan + Fields (yes, I am calling you out for being inconsiderate) products took over most of space.  They use most of  our small chair as a coat rack and leaving us to put our stuff on the floor. They were throwing their elbows  around almost crashing into our tapas plate and wine.Our voucher included 4 tapas to share and 1 bottle of wine.  The lounge was packed but died down around 8pm. They did have a live jazz band playing but it was quite loud but died down after the crowd from R+F left and the music stopped. We ordered a bottle of Riesling, which was tasty but a bit sweeter than Lapin wanted. The bottle wasn't the standard bottle size but almost a half bottle. This could be because we used a voucher.  I ordered the rock shrimp tempura, it was delicious and came with a good size portion. I also ordered two maki rolls - the california roll and rock shrimp roll (6pc each). They were okay; the seaweed was a bit chewy. The rock shrimp roll was a bit bland and had no sauce with it. They also forgot to serve us soy sauce even though I tried asking several times for it. Lapin ordered the fried Japanese chicken and was unimpressed by it. He thought it was going to be tastier and it was a bit plain -- he said he could make better. He also ordered the chicken and shrimp dumplings. The dumplings did have a whole shrimp in it but he thought it was on par with the Trader Joe's ones.The service was a hit and miss in the beginning, but when the manager came to check in on us he saw that we weren't have a great time. After we finished our meal, the server came over to surprise us with four pieces of tempura cheesecake on the house. This was a good job on behalf of the management, I went from hating being there to actually wanting to go back (but ordered something else). Never have I seen a manager who actively took steps to make an unhappy diner happy and for that, they deserve a 4 star review instead of the original 2 star review I was going to post.",1,0,0,Andie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",100,652,118

3.0,10/16/2015,"Natsumi is one of those places I've heard of and always walked past on my way to the downtown 1 train.  Every time I passed, the volume was so loud and the plates full of food that had been nicely positioned for an elegant presentation.  I knew someone who once worked here and one of the chefs had given him food to try and take home.  It was at that moment I knew I had to come here, one day.That day finally came not too long ago when a friend and I had just finished an aqua workout class and wanted a light dinner without straying too far into Times Square.  I suggested a neighboring restaurant but when their wait time was too long, I seized the opportunity to go to Natsumi.There were no tables available, so we sat in the middle of the sushi bar.  It wasn't crowded there and there was room for us to place our bags on the floor without us feeling awkward or bulky.  The ambience was very tame in comparision to other reviews but I suspect that's because we came on a Tuesday night and not too many people were there.  Servers were rushing back and forth and as we talked we watched the sushi chefs create beautiful sushi dishes that looks so good, I had to suppress the urge to snatch it off of the plate or more realistically, order it for myself.Our waitress came by with the menu and in good time, came back to take our drink orders.  My friend ordered a Stella Artois and I got a Dragonberry Crush (Bacardi dragonberry, lime, strawberry puree and some prosecco) and later a Brazilian favorite, a caipirinha.  Since we wanted a light dinner - hello, lifestyle change! - we opted for smaller portions via the appetizer section of the menu.  This was a hard decision, given that there was a variety of seemingly fabulous sushi and entrée options.  I suppose that was the case as the menu gave a very good, short description of the meal.  The words themselves seemed to be cherry picked and made my taste buds want to experience the meal in question.  As we sipped on drinks, we choose the Miso Black Cod (marinated with sake miso) and Spicy Seafood Lemon Grass Soup. Some time had passed and our waitress was concerned when our food did not arrive.  She was very apologetic and alerted the kitchen straight away.  Shortly after, our food appeared.  My Miso Cod was not as hot as it should have been so it was not clear if that is how it's served or if it was sitting there and someone had neglected to bring it out on time.  That aside, the cod was marvelous and the sake miso was almost peanut butter-y and the asparagus that came with it was a welcomed crunchy texture to the otherwise melt-in-your-mouth cod.  My friend enjoyed her soup but said it was ""a bit too sweet"".  She did not manage to finish it but she slurped on the noodles because they were so yummy.  I of course demolished my entire plate and was very satisfied as the amount given was a very appropriate portion for a hot appetizer dish.",1,0,0,Anna F.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",262,241,2187

Sadly Disappointed and better hopes for a 4 star rating.  My fault however for eating so close to Times Square.  Soba was straight sodium and chicken was rubber.  Tuna tar tar was nothing more than I could get at the Chinese place next to my apartment and even went above and beyond and ordered miso cod hoping that would save the day.  The miso sauce was terrible and tasted as if from a bottle and there was accompinants not listed on the menu (this type of surprise is never appreciated e.g. Allergies/dislikes)Server felt bad and pored me more sake(even he had little faith in the food when asked for recommendations- shame on me for ordering beyond the soba).

The styling of the dining room is very clean and modern looking, with dark wooden tables and cushion booths for some tables. The food here is definitely a 5/5, everything we had was wonderful. We had the kind crab dumplings, the seafood spring rolls, a sashimi platter, and the doppio toro. I'm a big fan of the doppio toro roll, you can't really go wrong though with salmon/yellow tail toro.

Service was generally cordial and excellent; aside from one snafu of delayed receipt of appetizers due to an order error. It was graciously amended with a complimentary appetizer. A nice touch.The food was decent to excellent. We started with field greens with ginger dressing. The salad contained no actual field greens but was a good version of this common menu item. Ginger dressing was above average and cold plate. The king crab dumplings were scrumptious. Perfect dumpling texture with delicious sweet king crab filling that was like eating seafood candy. One of highlights of meal. For entrees my dining partner had chicken teriyaki which was only decent. The chicken was flavorful but a bit overcooked and some dryness. The sauce was flavorful, but too thin and didn't adhere to chicken. .The side veggies were excellent. I had the gold leaf roll which was very good. The sushi tasted fresh and good quality, but wasn't memorable. The Ikura and white bass  sushi was very good.Surprisingly, (especially for an Asian restaurant) the highlight of meal was the tempura cheesecake. This clever dessert creation is simply to die for. It tasted like a funnel cake and cheesecake wrapped up in one. It's a must have if  you dine here.Tatsumi is a good choice for a good meal, but not the place if you're expecting top shelf sushi.

3.0,8/7/2015,"**Restaurant Week Summer 2015 Review - DINNER**I would give Natsumi an actual rating of 3.5 stars rounded down.  3 because I liked it, but probably can't justify coming back at its price point as there are better places that serve similar food for cheap, and 4 stars because the food was relatively enjoyable.  Rounded down because everyone else's entrees I tasted were really meh.A group of 10 of us came to Natsumi to enjoy their $38 restaurant week dinner special.  There are actually a lot of items to choose from on their RW menu, unlike other places.  Portions here are also quite large for restaurant week, which is surprising.For my appetizer, I had the trio carpaccio - this was 9 thin-sliced marinated fish in 3 different sauces.  This was a good start to the meal, as I wanted something fishy since I didn't plan on getting the ""omakase"" for the entree.  I also tasted the seafood ceviche, which was pretty much seafood with avocado sauce (there was a lot of avocado).For my entree, I got the grilled filet mignon with shiitake peppercorn sauce.  There were options of what turned out to be overcooked salmon and swordfish, a tiny Wolf Hall Roll, and a small ""omakase"" - """" because it was like 6 pieces of nigiri and a measly roll (chefs choice).  Seemed like the only people that were full at the table were the ones that got steak.  Anyhow, my rating is based solely on my own food.  The meat was tender and very, very slightly overdone, but still soft and had a nice char on the outside.  The sauce was pretty standard and there wasnt a lot of mushroom in it.  It came with a couple florets of broccoli and some tempura vegetables and rice.Dessert was the best part - tempura cheesecake!  I love fried ice cream, and you can think of this as fried ice cream but with hot cheesecake in it.  It melted in your mouth and the crispy tempura on the outside was delicious.  This was probably everyone's favorite dish at the table.  A regular order I think comes with 4, but for RW you get 2 pieces, ranging in size.  I wonder if they actually make their cheesecake in-house... doubt it.Was Natsumi good? Yeah, it was decent, at least for me. Would I return?  Doubtful - price point and level of satisfaction wouldn't drive me to come back, but I don't regret coming here for a meal since it's been on my bookmarks.",4,2,2,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2170,1311,3573

3.0,7/29/2015,"Solid Theatre District fusion sushi.Not as creative in their ""fusion"" as they could be. But still some tasty rolls that are very good for introducing young people to sushi. If you are a ""big eater"" the sushi/sashimi combination is actually the perfect meal size. Targeted on the menu for two people, I find it's my perfect meal size, despite the waitress trying to dissuade me from ordering it.Fish is fresh, jalapeños are not (which is a serious ""ding"" on the ""fusion rating"" in my book). They tend to be busy and reservations are probably required for dinner. Place is clean. Service is decent, not great. Bathroom is officially BIZARRE. Appears to be shared with definitely sketchy hotel in same building which appears to have breakfast/lunch/something set up half a flight of stairs below the bathroom. Using the restroom is an adventure...They do make the ""perfect"" gin and tonic however.

3.0,7/7/2015,"Came here with my husband for an early dinner before we watched a show. The Restuarant's setting is dark and romantic. Now, The layout is very weird. The hotel splits the place into two section. Anyway it can be confusing. Our waitress wasn't friendly, she looked like she didn't want to work or was feeling blue. For  appetizer we order a seafood ceviche which was very refreshing and had a nice fruity aroma. Second and last appetizer was the rock shrimp tempera. The shrimp is fried in a crispy batter and drizzled with some type of spicy mayo. (NOT SPICY AT ALL) My husband and I was shocked because the portions was pretty big! We were full off the appetizers. For entrees my husband and I ordered beef filet mignon instead of sushi. Yes I know, wrong choice!! We waited 30-40 min! The steak came out and the aroma of the mushroom was very intense. The meat was very dry even with the sauce (sauce was very bitter)! My husband ordered medium rare and I order a medium well. My steak was over cooked and so was my husband. Would I come back?

2.0,6/26/2015,"The king crab dumplings had the mushy texture of shumai.  I guess I should have expected that since it's a steamed dumpling, but I was hoping for a fancier king crab flavor.  The rock shrimp tempura was not much better.  Way too much batter, like the way regular shrimp tempura is made.  Rock shrimp tempura should have a fried 'shell' so you're just eating crunchy shrimp.  The spicy sauce was just drizzled on top, instead of being mixed thoroughly in mayo and spicy sauce.  The Doppo Toro special roll was disappointing.  Very thin slice of fish on a roll that was mostly filled with a big chunk of avocado.  Not worth the price.  Chilean sea bass was very good though!  Very long wait for food.",0,0,0,Jonathan W.,"Brooklyn, NY",66,10,0
4.0,6/23/2015,"Came here with some friends for a birthday dinner on a Friday night. At first, they tried to seat us in a very narrow part of the restaurant that was dark and depressing, so we asked to be seated closer to the front by the windows. They accommodated our request. The restaurant is small-ish; there's a bar area but it's cut off by a hotel in between the two sections. It's cozy though, and I noticed another birthday happening a table over, so it seems like a desirable spot for that.Our appetizers were edamame, tuna pizza, and chicken & shrimp dumplings. The edamame was eh (needed more salt), the tuna pizza was VERY good, and the dumplings were undoubtedly the best I've EVER had. They were absolutely delicious. My rolls were tuna avocado and spicy rock shrimp. I really enjoyed both of them. Sushi was nice and fresh. Everyone at the table was enjoying what they had. The only thing that was outright disliked was the seaweed salad, but the waitress was good about taking that off the bill for us.Overall, a nice quiet place to come and have a relaxing dinner.

I ordered a green tea butterfly ravioli and a sashimi plater. The butterfly spaghetti tastes normal and the sashimi is surprisingly served with their self invented spicy roll (wrapped with chili pepper). I don't understand why the combination while the spicy flavor numbed my palate before I tried the sashimi. I have to wait for a while and eat the ginger slice to balance the stimuli. The waitress there seems preoccupied and has slight of idea about Japanese cuisine. I think the place is good for get-together instead of having serious Japanese food.

4.0,5/30/2015,This is a great place to host a gathering as they can accomodate parties in the 8-12 ppl range which happen to be the party sizes that I booked the two times that I've eaten here.  There menu is diverse enough for most with your standard raw sushi fare as well as cooked options like teryiaki and bento boxes.The place is split up into two sections: a bar/lounge area and a full on dine-in restaurant.  These two rooms are separated by a hotel lobby in between.  Just make sure if you have a reservation to go to the left side to check in with the host/hostess.If you're a sushi snob and dining with less mouths then there's plenty of other options in the city but this place is a good choice if you want a mid-range priced outing with a larger group.,0,0,0,David Y.,"New York, NY",311,121,13

My dad got the Seafood Toban Yaki and at $32 the entree was generously sized with chunks of salmon, sea bass, shrimp and a lobster tail. I liked it but he thought the sauce was too sour to eat.

Nothing special but good.  To top it off, I had tiramisu just because I find that hard to resist although I admit an odd choice for a sushi place.

He recommended a great malbec and explained that even though it is the cheaper of the ones they had he felt that one was better and I totally agreed. After a drink we moved over to the restaurant and here we had:edamame, which is the same everywhere, shrimp and scallop shumai, which was ok, grilled beef short ribs which was delicious, 4 pieces of salmon sashimi, which honestly was the smallest portion I have ever received at any restaurant.and we ordered the shrimp and veggies tempura.The waitress spilled a bit of my drink when we asked to be moved from one table to the next but she gave me extra wine on my next order. I wonder if she would have done anything about it had I not ordered a refill. She then gave us Veggie tempura at first which looked great but was missing the shrimp, and then when we got the right platter I sort of wished we had as many veggies as we did in the first platter. I really wanted to give this place 4 stars but quite frankly this time around I just can't give it that.

Ordered four tapas including  the fried chicken, rock shrimp and a few sushi rolls. Everything was good my only qualm is we put in the orders at the same time and everything came out separately. There was a noticeably long wait between when we got out fried chicken and our sushi rolls. Not a huge deal but it was a bit strange considering none were entrees.   The restaurant & bar are in two completely separated spaces. They are located in the lobby of a hotel but they are not affiliated. Overall a good space. They had a huge tv which allowed me to watch the national championship game. I can't speak on the restaurant because I did not even have an opportunity to check out the space. Overall I was happy and will be returning.

4.0,3/29/2015,"I bought a voucher and waited for too long to use it. So, hubby and I found ourselves venturing out to the city in order to use the voucher before it expired. I made last minute reservations, not realizing that the business has two separate operations. Upon entering the building, there is a lounge on the right and to the left, is their more formal restaurant. Because of the direction from which we came, we went to the right and I told the host/server/bartender (this man does it all) that we had a reservation and he directed us to the restaurant operation. We entered, announced our reservation and were seated rather quickly. We waited for quite some time before a server actually came to us and asked what we wanted to drink. When I told her we had a voucher, she directed us back to the lounge side, so we gathered our things and went back across the hall. Again, we were seated quickly and rather preferred the lounge side. We were able to sit next to each other in a mini love seat and it was definitely more intimate and casual. There were a lot of couples having dinner together in the dimly lit space, snuggling and giggling and we kinda dug it. The voucher offered four tapas and a bottle of wine. My husband doesn't drink wine so I was concerned and requested to cork the bottle after I was done drinking and they thankfully accommodated. We had to get a few extras, as we always do. We were starved so we each ordered three items. I had to get some Kumamotos, one of my favorite oysters. Four the regular tapas, we ordered the Salmon Sashimi Jalapeño, Fried Chicken, Shrimp Tempura, Chicken Teriyaki and Beef Asparagus Maki. Despite the minor hiccup in the beginning of the evening, we actually considered it a blessing to have had our dinner on the lounge side because the restaurant side seemed a little stuffy; that might have been due in part to the people we were seated in between. They were a little weird and we didn't feel comfortable from the moment we sat down. All of the food we ordered was great. The ambiance was great. It was a weeknight, so there were a lot less people than I'm sure there are on a weekend evening. I guess it would depend what kind of energy you want to feed off of. We were quite content with the sexy time feel that was vibing If you want to try them out, LivingSocial has another voucher for them right now, same four tapas deal with a bottle of wine.",4,0,2,Amanda G.,"Yonkers, NY",1010,912,5110

It was probably the star of the night. The rock shrimp was good as well crunchy and tasty. For the entrée I had the chirashi which was good fish taste fresh and  good size pieces and rice was good too. Girlfriend had the chicken teriyaki which was good but wasn't very interesting so I only had a bite but she said it was good. The hostess came back and asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu but we were too full. All in all it was a good place and would definitely come back to try something else. Its a little more pricey compared to your corner store sushi place but I would say it's worth it.,1,0,0,Wilson W.,"Rego Park, NY",6,2,1

Same goes for Natsumi. The service was excellent and attentive. We sat at a table that is half bar, half table. but there were many quiet private places to sit if you were looking for a more romantic setting.Me and a friend split a warm sake to drink-- normal price for a large hot sake (I think $12.00).I got  miso soup for an appetizer and the choose 3 hand rolls for my main . The miso was good (hard to go wrong) and the sushi rolls were all good too (Tuna roll, Salmon avocado, Spicy tuna). They charged extra for spicy mayo ($1.00)  which is annoying, but normal in the city. My friend had the tuna tartar and edemame for their apps-- didn't try the tartar, but it looked good and the edemame was well cooked.

I also ordered the dragonberry crush drink  (which was absolutely delicious btw)! The only reason why I'm not giving a full 5 stars is because the dessert fell a little short of my expectations. We ordered the tiramisu, and it was just okay. Nothing fantastic. Service-wise, everyone was extremely kind! I'd give a full 5 stars for the staff. We had multiple different people (including the host and hostess) come by just to check on us. The hostess even offered to take a picture for us since she seemed to notice that we were there to celebrate a special event!

I picked the bar seats so I can watch the three chefs prep. Greentea gnocchi was my appetizer, I am not a big fan of gnocchi , but I give props to the creativity of the dish- although the cheese took away the subtlety of the green tea taste. Then I chose the Omakase chef's selection. The chef handed the plate to me himself cause I was in front of him. He watched me as I ate six pieces of nigri and a roll of spicy salmon roll. Very fresh and melts in your mouth. Surprising (and not surprisingly), the best dish was the dessert, tempura cheesecake. The tempura was crunchy but the cheesecake was moist and sweet.

2.0,8/14/2014,"Meh. Restaurant Week.Atmosphere: Trendy and hip. Food: Green Tea Gnocchi was unappealing to look at, and also just tasted like regular gnocchi. I opted for the filet mignon with shiitake peppercorn. The portion was good, but overall it tasted just okay. Some parts of the meat were too chewy, and some were soft and easy to bite into. For dessert I got the lychee sorbet, which was the best thing I had there. The sorbet was filled with actual lychee bits and was tangy and sweet all at once. My roommate got the ceviche (pretty good), omakase (not fresh, wouldn't recommend), and the tempura cheesecake, which is good but extremely heavy for my taste.On the plus side, they give you complimentary sake.The lychee and the plum were both tasty and strong.Service: Okay, let me just gripe about something. Usually, when you are asked if you would like water or tea, you assume either is complimentary, right? Well, we were asked if we would like either or, and we opted for some green tea. Additionally, we were not told it costs extra. When it got to us, they were in individual pots. Immediately, we thought ""oh, they're charging us for this."" And lo and behold, they did. We obviously didn't make a fuss about it, but each tea cost us $3.50. Now I will be forever going to any restaurant scared that they'll charge me for tea. The waitress also took a really long time getting us our food and I had noticed that the table in front of us (who came in 10 minutes later) got their appetizers before us.Meh, there are plenty of other yummy Japanese restaurants in the area.

Friend of mine ordered the salmon sashimi appetizer, which came out warm. It has a nice kick to it with the jalapenos, but the warmth detracted from the potential flavors it had to actually offer. The ""ponzu"" sauce wasn't actual ponzu, more like soy with sesame oil with the sesame oil was extremely overpowering. After the initial order, I ordered additional a la carte to get the feel of the freshness and origin of their fish. Didn't have ama ebi but had boton ebi which was nice. Prior to my order, the server hastily cleaned my entire setting as if it rush us out, despite seeing that my other diners had not finished yet, just assuming that I'm finished, and just came back a minute later with just my dessert while my other diners were still on their entree.

3.0,8/2/2014,"We decided to try the dinner menu from restaurant week at Natsumi (the gnocchi being the main draw). Upon arrival (10 minutes early), we were seated promptly, and without wait (very appreciated). Menus came rather quickly, with the restaurant week menu being a green flyer in the middle. A nice surprise was that they offered their house infused sake as an add on to the meal. Unfortunately, they had only lychee, plum, and blueberry as the options with the menu, so we decided to try the pear flavor (I assumed it would be less sweet, with a slight sour flavor), before purchasing a glass (much like you would with a nice wine). Our waitress was not very obliging in this and it took us 5 minutes to explain to her that we would like to order off the RW menu, but try a small amount before buying. Considering we were rather hungry, this tipped our mood to the negative side. The drinks themselves were nothing special. We ordered the lychee from menu, and received the tasting of the pear, both of which tasted rather heavily of the syrup you find in cans of processed pears and lychees, and not at all of sake. My boyfriend, much like me, doesn't like too sweet drinks and so we purchased a regular (unflavored) sake glass (quite good option offered by the waitress) and I--a green tea (had to ask for this twice). The green tea was good in that it didn't taste like the powdered versions you always find in lower scale Japanese restaurants, and that boosted my spirits (I believe you can tell the quality of sushi in a restaurant, by the quality of green tea). The food came next. I ordered the green tea gnochi and the Chef's signature sushi/roll platter, with green tea ice cream as dessert. The gnocchi were rather good, but too salty, therefore covering most any other flavors in the dish aside from capers and mushrooms (I wanted to taste the green tea aspect of this dish). The platter of fish was nothing special, with the usual suspects appearing in sushi form (i.e shrimp, tuna, salmon...) and a tiny roll that had asparagus and crab meat inside and spicy salmon on the outside. The green tea ice cream--like any green tea ice cream. All in all, a standard flavor palette, rather than the promised choice selection. My boyfriend had the steak (which was supposed to be offered with either teriyaki or pepper sauce, but was instead given with teriyaki without stating the option), with the ceviche as an appetizer, and the chocolate mousse cake for dessert. The ceviche was rather good, with the lime being the prominent flavor, but we didn't get to experience the kiwi notes mentioned in the menu. The steak was cooked as we requested (medium-rare) and the beef was fresh as stated (don't expect kobe or grass-fed here). We had difficulty with that it was not well cut and enjoyed the meal with a knife and chopsticks (comical to say the least). The sauce was delicious, but the overall dish was reminiscent of a beef teriyaki plate in a different restaurant, with slightly higher quality beef. The chocolate mousse cake was nothing special, tasting like standard times square bakery fare. All in all, nothing special.To sum up, for those who don't wish to read the long review above, I took away stars for the following reasons:1) Our waitress made a few blunders that were not appreciated (no overall rudeness); - .5 stars.2) The infused sakes (a supposed specialty) did not live up to the idea (small subtraction, as I didn't expect this on the menu to begin with):- .5 stars. 3) The food was nothing special, as promised by the idea of restaurant week (although portions were filling), rather lacking creativity and full use of the stated flavor palette: - 1 star.",0,0,0,Asvy S.,"New York, NY",51,56,8

I'm not quite sure why that would be something to remark about.  The seaweed salad was not good. There was a pretty poor selection of house special rolls and almost all of them had asparagus in them. What's up with that? Asparagus is out of season. The worst part of the experience was the waiter's ""last call for food and alcohol.""

Our server was very knowlegable about sake, which may seem silly, but it was helpful because we keep wanting to like it, but couldn't find anything we liked. She recommended one called Wakitaki and it was WONDERFUL. The guys making the sushi were talking and laughing the whole time and they seemed just as facinated by us watching them as we were. We were in cocktail attire; I didn't notice if others were similarly dressed or if it was more casual. They made us a ""special"" appetizer of cucumber, salmon, avocado, jalapeno, and roe... which was WONDERFUL! I don't like spicy food so I had my husband try it first; the avocado must have balanced out the jalapeno because I was able to eat it and it was phenomenal. It was a rice-less sushi that the guy made ""for fun"", he said. I ordered the Maki (?) special, where you can pick 3 types of sushi/rolls for $18. My husband had the Chef's Specialty, which was $25 (I think). Mine had 18 pieces of sushi total (3 types, 6 pieces of each), I can't remember how many my husband had. Even though we eat sushi frequently, my husband has never mastered chopsticks. They ribbed him about it but made him ""kid's chopsticks"", which he used while laughing the whole time. I'm sure they would have given him a fork but he wanted to learn and the server spent a few minutes showing him how to use chopsticks.They were also kind enough to point us in the direction of a good bakery when we asked where we could get cupcakes for our friend, who had a birthday during our trip. I will definitely be going back the next time we are in NY!",0,0,0,Kelly B.,"Orange, VA",0,8,0
4.0,4/2/2014,"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I was not expecting much given it is located in the heart of times square and in such a touristy area, but I was wrong. The atmosphere is trendy and very nice. It is tastefully upscale and not super bright and flashy like most places in this area tend to be. The fish was surprisingly fresh! Very good sushi. The edamame dumplings were also very good. Great spot in an area that I otherwise try to avoid.

3.0,1/26/2014,"My friend had a Groupon for the 4 tapas and a bottle of wine for $40 deal, so we went on a Friday night. The entrance is a bit odd, as the place comprises two areas, and you actually walk into a hotel lobby first (though the lack of people makes it seem more like an apartment building lobby). So we're standing on this landing in the bar+lounge space (the maitre-d in the restaurant area told us to go across the hall), and probably 5 different staff walk by us completely oblivious to our presence, and there is no one present at the door to greet people who've just arrived. Finally we flag someone down and tell them about our reservation. While on the landing, I surveyed the room and it was crowded and dense and I saw a small table with one seat on a wall bench and another that looked like a hassock with a sign that said 'reserved.' So we were seated there, and it was pretty much in the lane for waiters and bussers. We showed the deal to our waitress, and she gave us the deal menu. The only thing that keeps my rating at 3 instead of 2 stars is that for tapas or appetizers, the food was actually good and of sizable portions as well. For the wine we got the no-name Pinot Grigio which was very sweet and light; and between the 2 of us, we ordered the spinach gnocchi w/ asparagus & capers in a green tea mushroom cream sauce, the rock shrimp tempura, and 2 chicken teriyakis. The spinach gnocchi was unique and great, especially the sauce. I wouldn't go as far to call the service brusque, but it was clear that we were handled differently because we were there for a deal. The most glaring in my opinion was their failure to provide an ice bucket for our bottle of white wine to stay chilled while other surrounding tables had them. They simply placed the bottle on the table and walked away after filling our glasses. And while we did not see anyone come in after us at the door, there was a constant feeling of a rush to get us out (it was already after showtimes, so it was clear we weren't part of the pre-theater dinner crowd). In the end, the food was good, the service was mediocre, and it's not a place I'd have sought out if not for the deal we had.",1,1,0,Matthew K.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",14,39,5

The rainbow roll could use a bit more artistic creativity re: presentation (ie. create a sexy, modern, hip romanticized version à la red sea roll). (Or 'Andy Warhol' it with a bit of flair and unique NYC personality?)Anyways, be sure to remember to give the soft-shell crab roll sauce next time.

One of the pieces i had was so bad I did bring it up with the wait staff - to suggest that they probably shouldn't serve that fish to any other customers. The waiter kept trying to explain to me that their fish is served fresh daily, which I found kind of annoying. Just because it was served fresh doesn't change the fact that it didn't taste good.

How can you enjoy a mouth full of raw fish?  Some pieces of fish I had to spit out, while others were pretty fantastic.  The worst part was a huge intestine square in the middle of a butterflies shrimp.  That's just lazy, especially for a place that requires attention to detail.While I sat at the bar, I saw some beautiful rolls made, so I am guessing that's what has earned them their positive ratings on yelp.  However, if you are in the mood for a more traditional sushi experience, I would not recommend this place.",0,0,0,Yan K.,"Minneapolis, MN",22,31,2

2.0,11/11/2013,"Staying in New York City, and I was craving for sushi.  I saw the many raves of this restaurant and decided why not.  It had so many reviews, and the star rating was good.  I first stepped into the restaurant, actually, we didn't even go towards the restaurant, we had gone towards the bar/dining area rather than the actual restaurant itself, and I felt the vibes.  I absolutely love the water illusion on the wall in the very back where the bar was.  It definitely had a lounge feel to it.  The seating were on couches and little stools, gave a very comfortable hang out area.  We sat in the left corner towards the window.  The ambiance was great, definitely a comfortable seating area, for just me and my boyfriend of course. The customer service was good.  Our waitress was nice, not too talkative, but had a smile on her face.  Sometimes I felt like she would give us that look, but I'm probably just over exaggerating, nothing to take offense of.  She gave us pretty good recommendations to the menu.Food... ok... Where do I start?  The pricing of this restaurant was fairly overpriced to me.  My boyfriend however disagrees with that.  To me, 6 tiny pieces of sushi for approximately $6-8 dollars is quite expensive, not only that but the specialty item, eh, I wasn't too satisfied neither.Couple things we ordered on the menu that I remembered...1. Crunchy Spicy Salmon:  per everyone's recommendation, I agree that was one of the best that I've tried at this restaurant.  What I did for extra pinch was put ginger/soy sauce/wasabi in a bowl mixed it and took a piece of ginger and placed it on top of the roll and ate it together.  It was amazing. Definitely recommend.2. Salmon Avocado:  Had no flavor.  I didn't like it whatsoever.  I basically forced myself to eat it because it cost me like... $6.25.  I mean it wasn't bad?  I'm usually a fan of raw salmon, so even if it was just like a Nigiri, I could still enjoy, but this was ridiculous.  I understand, the fish is fresh, but common... I don't recommend.3. Spicy Rock Shrimp Avocado:  No... I did not enjoy this one either.  The shrimp was so tough, I just couldn't enjoy it.  I expected it to be as soft as tempura shrimp, but it was just so rough.  I don't recommend this neither.4. Crunchy Spicy Oyster:  This had such a powdery texture of the oyster...  I refused to eat it.  I made my boyfriend eat this, so that should explain how bad it was to me.  5.  King Crab Avocado:  The crab was like deep fried soft shell crab with rice.  Absolutely no flavor to it.  I don't recommend because I imagined it to be much more flavorful, but all they did was add soy sauce on top.  To me, not worth the money.6. Doppio Toro:  This here was the specialty roll that was recommended.  The waitress insisted this was her favorite, given her word, we ordered it.  I'd say it was mediocre, I mean... I'm a big sushi lover, and this would not be something on the menu I would recommend because quite frankly, I'd prefer a plate of sashimi instead.  7.  Deep Fried Tempura Cheesecake:  This is the reason why I gave this restaurant any type of rating to be honest.  The cheesecake was amazing.  I'm not sure if it's made in the store, but it tasted so soft and creamy.  I highly recommend this just like everyone else.Overall, quite frankly, I don't feel that this restaurant was worth it because the portions are small.  And I understand, most Japanese restaurant that serve fresh fish may get a bit pricy.  But I personally feel that they're very stingy with their portions.  And that's what I don't like.  Not only that but the menu looked like it was trying to aim for a 5 star restaurant feel, and it didn't quite deliver.  I couldn't determine what was in the sushi roll, and if I had known, I probably wouldn't have ordered as much as I did and end up so unsatisfied.  I'm big on sushi, from authentic to Americanized, I can determine what is worth my money and what isn't.  And unfortunately, this restaurant in my opinion does not tickle my fancy.  And I felt like these reviews only seem to mention the tempura cheesecake that made it such a high rating.  But other than that I don't see anyone recommending any sushi dishes other than that Crunchy Spicy Salmon roll, which by the way was only 6 pieces 1x1 inch!  I don't know about you, but if I'm paying that much, I'd rather pay $12-13 and get a full size roll instead of it being a ""specialty roll"" and charging almost $18 per 10 pieces.  I'm just saying.Would I recommend this to someone who is traveling in NYC? Probably not. I don't feel that you would get your monies worth.  I wish I could give a better rating, because the staff and the feel of this restaurant was great, but based per food wise, I cannot.",0,0,0,Nhu-Quynh N.,"Oakland, CA",560,379,119

Holy crap, what a great deal.  TONS of fresh sashimi, nigiri, and tasty rolls. It was the most sashimi I've eaten in one sitting (esp. because my date didn't want to eat the sashimi/nigiri...mwahahaha). Super fresh and generous. The miso black cod was amazing as well.

2.0,9/6/2013,"I had dined here a few years back and had a great experience, so I decided to come back here for dinner before a show last night.  I made an opentable reservation and when I got there, I told them I had a reservation and the woman quickly said ""no"" in a very dismissive way.  I told her I made it on opentable and said I could show it to her, and she just said ""ok well I can show you my screen and show you that its not here,"" which was very rude and she easily could've just said sorry.  Then she said that they have problems with opentable and a lot of times the reservations don't show up in their system, which I think they should probably work on or just not use opentable.  Luckily they were able to seat us anyway.  After a few minutes, one of the waiters came over to take our drink orders and I have never had so much trouble explaining a drink order before.  My dad wanted a martini straight up with olives, no vermouth, and when I explained it to the waiter he had a blank stare and asked, ""ok so does he want it dry or dirty.""  I simply repeated the exact order and he was still confused and he tried to explain that if I wanted it dirty, it would have olive juice in it.  Again, I repeated that I did not want it dirty, all we wanted was a martini straight up with olives as a garnish, and no vermouth.  He walked always looking very confused, but my dad said the drink was ok.Most of the food that we ordered was good, but there was nothing too special about it.  I got the edamame dumplings to start and they were extremely sticky, and part of the wrapper got stuck on the leaves in the bowl and it broke apart. They tasted fine, but I've had much better.  I also got the chicken teriyaki which was good, but again nothing special.  Overall, the food was ok but the service seemed very disorganized and confused.  After we placed our order and edamame came to the table, a waiter showed up with my chicken teriyaki and another hot dish, but our appetizers hadn't even come out yet.  He then came back and told us it was the wrong table, but he continued to wander around looking for the right table.  Then, after our main courses came, the same guy came back with an order of edamame and we again had to tell him it was the wrong table.  It seemed like they needed to get their act together, and there are much better options in the theatre district.  Needless to say, next time I am going to a show I will choose a different restaurant to go to.",0,0,0,Allie S.,"Manhattan, NY",3,70,166

It's very cute, but when we arrived the intimate table layout and dim overhead lighting with supplemental twinkle lights made it uncomfortably ""romantic"" for a work lunch. Would recommend for date night, not day time. I had the Doppio Toro (loved the crunch of the asparagus!) and my coworker had the salmon and rainbow sashimi cucumber rolls. Our food came quickly and was delicious, you could taste how fresh the ingredients were. I think the only thing I would have changed was going a little lighter on the tempura flakes but that is definitely just my biased opinion (I'm not the biggest fried food fan). They were a little stingy with the ginger garnish for my sushi at first, but when I asked for more they quickly brought me a whole little bowl of it.Servers were polite but not overly attentive. They cleared dishes promptly and didn't pressure us to leave when we finished, even during a busy lunch hour.

I had:--Green tea spinach gnocchi. It was really different -- a ""healthy"" spin on gnocchi. They had perfect texture -- slightly chewy yet soft, with the right amount of green tea cream sauce and small pieces of asparagus--I got the omakase for the main course, and got about 6 pieces of sushi and 1 roll that has strawberries, asparagus and some kind of fish. The fish was all extremely fresh: tuna, yellowtail, salmon, eel and others. --Chocolate saucy cake is your standard rich dessert and a great way to end the night--I got one of the $12 cocktails, the Peach Surrender. It wasn't too strong and very sweet--They also gave us complimentary sake in a double shot. I had pear, which was also sweet.The decor and service were exceptional for our group, despite being packed and in a busy area.

2.0,7/27/2013,"I really don't understand how this place can get four stars.  I've read diligently through the reviews of Natsumi, and since everyone says the food here is delicious, I decided to give it a try. I came here for dinner, and it was absolutely packed.  I figured that was a good thing, since I had a reservation, and I felt it spoke a lot about the place.  According to the reviews almost everything on the restaurant week menu was delicious, so I went with the rock shrimp, omakase, and fried cheesecake.  My friend got the dumplings, the filet mignon, and the ice cream. Everything was subpar.  It all tasted like cheap Chinese food with a Japanese twist.  My rock shrimp was fried well, but I thought the sauce didn't taste very well.  My friend's dumplings were okay, but she said she did like the crab dumpling.  My omakase (as expected) were just a couple of normal pieces of sushi with a roll.  It was restaurant week so I didn't really expect them to dress up the pieces that much as they do with omakase at good sushi places.  Fish was okay: long thin slices on top of a small bed of rice.  Had to take two bites to finish each.  The roll was disgusting though.  It was some sort of white fish with asian pickles.  Never had asian pickles in my sushi, and I really don't ever want to again.  Poor pairing.  My friend took a bite of her filet mignon and that was it.  She didn't like it at all.  As for dessert, ice cream is ice cream, but the fried cheesecake was far too heavy.  It should have had more of a fruit flavor in the cheesecake or more strawberry sauce to cut through the heaviness. The reason why this place gets two stars is because the staff here is great.  They saw my friend didn't even touch her filet mignon, and they asked her what was wrong with it, took it away, and offered to get her a new plate.  She instead decided to take it off our tab, and they graciously did that and gave us a $20 dollar gift certificate as we left.  Not that we were going to come back, but it was a really great gesture.",2,0,0,Mary P.,"Manhattan, NY",149,38,0
1.0,7/25/2013,"***Preface: I didn't go to Natsumi upset or with the intention to write a bad review. I went to Natsumi expecting great things, in fact my gf and I were both really looking forward to it. Japanese food in NYC is generally very well prepared. New restaurants that I tend to try are at least 4 stars with a minimum 100+ reviews. No doubt I place a lot of trust in Yelp reviews and it's dominated my way of choosing restaurants, so much so that it's become instinctive to check the star rating and review highlights before each foray into a new dining experience. So when Natsumi came in at 4/5 stars on Yelp I thought it'd be a great place to try during restaurant week. The experience has put into question my unwavering confidence in Yelp and its reviewers. I left feeling misguided and outright fooled. Maybe reviewers of this restaurant have never eaten fresh fish? Or maybe their version of a good meal is a microwaved TV dinner with a beer for dessert? How else can I explain a 4/5 for this sad disappointment?The atmosphere is surely nice enough - the decor is posh, swanky, and trendy. I thought nothing could go wrong. I really liked the high ceilings, the expert interior design, and the fact that the place was packed with bustling waiter/waitresses frantically running around would only add to my confidence in this restaurant. I came to realize later that I had been fooled.We were seated rather slowly. After our initial check-in at the front desk there was a bit of a wait before the hostess was able to tame a passing waiter to clear a table for two. Finally, we were seated. Little did I know this would become a trend for the entire dinner service.Onto the food and drink (keep in mind, apart from the drinks and first food item we had the restaurant week menu). Ume. Not a fan, for me nor my gf. Kimono Dragon. Way too sour, to the point where your face can't help but contort during dinner. I also wish there was more alcohol now that I think about it; maybe that would have saved some of the pain. Tuna Tataki. Good but not great - balanced, saucy, but salad was lifeless and depressing. Overall a decent dish. Little did I know, this would be by far the best dish of the night. Green Tea Spinach Gnocchi. Bland, flavorless, and can't taste the green tea. Dumpling Sampler. Awful. I've had better shumai frozen. The edamame dumpling was bland and the filling had a texture not unlike someone who'd chewed peanuts and spit them out. Dumpling wrap was tough, chewy, and not steamed properly. The king crab dumpling, something they are known for apparently, tasted like mushy imitation crab with some sort of creamy filling. Omakase Chef's Choice, no salmon. Did I mention no salmon? No salmon please. More on this later. The fish was disappointing. This is a Japanese sushi place for heaven's sake... get your shit together. I've had better sushi from the grocery store in my hometown. Fish was note fresh, sushi rise was inedible, even the seaweed wrap in the roll we had was distinctly disgraceful. How do you mess up sushi when you're a Japanese sushi bar? Grilled Filet Mignon. Don't go there. Meat is almost inedible because it's so mushy and poor quality. I wrapped it up for lunch because it passes as food when you eat lunch in front of a computer just or sustenance. Tempura Cheesevake (2). Tastes like a cheap crab ragoon that I'm sure had I had the opportunity to eat at the restaurant would have been dressed up to warrant the glorified reviews of it, taking it to the top as a review highlight. Let's try again.  Service was just miserable. We had a total of 4 different people serving us... or not serving us. Watching them work made us feel anxious, antsy, and distressed for them. The first just took our order and was quite dejected at that. He clearly wasn't paying attention or had communication issues because the fiasco with our entrees was memorable in the most undesirable way. As for our entree, we received two Omakases both with salmon which we returned, noting that we had ordered only one Omakase and one filet mignon with no salmon. 10 minutes later a waiter came around with one Omakase with salmon. The first waitress who brought the Omakases came over to explain the situation. He then intrusively shouts at us while trying to get out orders correct and abruptly straightens up to tells us that we needed to wait a while. He was not kidding. At one point he even comes back to ask me how I liked my steak cooked. Throughout the night we had to wait, and wait, and wait... we didn't even eat the dessert at the restaurant because we were so tired of waiting. Between courses was a good 15-20 minutes with our totaling over 1.5 hours for two people. Drinks took a long time as well.  This experience cost us $133 - the worst part at the end when the manager comes to generically ask us how our dinner was and to invite us back, handing us, as well as all of the tables we've seen, a $20 off $50 card to come back. Me thinks not.",4,2,1,Andrew J.,"Manhattan, NY",209,144,401

5.0,3/22/2013,"The secret is out... Natsumi is my Broadway postshow hot spot. Okay, it wasn't a huge secret... and actually, I everyone to know how much I love Natsumi! Located on 50th, just across the street from the famous Wicked, Natsumi has an excellent selection of modern fusion Japanese food and a banging drink menu. This is a great place to come for food, drinks, or just to wind down after a theater experience!I first came here on Halloween a few years back to celebrate my good friend Jack's birthday. Although I prefer coming to Natsumi with a smaller group, they were able to accomodate our ten person party with ease. Fast foward to present day, Natsumi has never disappointed. There's great, fast service, delicious fusion food (I love their green tea gnocci... just to throw that out there), and awesome drinks. I can't remember all the ones I've tried... but my recent favorite is the sake sangria.If you find youself in the area and are only in the mood for drinks, there is a lounge section of Natsumi, just next door. They really know how to cater to your thirst or hunger needs. Natsumi has the three g's I look for when going out to a restaurant, good service, good food, and good drinks. I am so glad that I have a place to incorporate into my Broadway ritual. It doesn't seem like the complete Broadway experience without stopping by after a show for some drinks and food!",6,1,2,Erin M.,"Manhattan, NY",1318,563,412

4.0,3/2/2013,"WINTER RW REVIEW:Who knew Japanese and Italian would work? Who knew?!?! I'm a little late on my reviews but what a joy to have dined here even when their rw menu wasn't posted online. We sat in the little corner in a snug little booth. What drives me nuts is the fact that their restaurant is divided by the hotel entrance with the bar on one side and the restaurant in the other. I arrived early and went to the bar to grab a drink before the rest of my friends arrived. I had their peach surrender. It was a mix between peach juice and vodka. The ice was crushed into the tiniest pieces which made each sip all that more delectable. It wasn't too strong but enough to hold me over on an empty stomach. It was also refreshing and didn't have the burn vodka normally has. Once the party arrived we set to order the ceviche and green tea gnocchi for appetizers; the filet mignon, salmon teriyaki, the chilean sea bass and the omakase set. The ceviche was so light and refreshing. The portion size was larger than most which was so surprising. It had king crab, shrimp, some fish sashimi, mango and lime mixed in with some greenery. The mango was absolutely perfect in the ceviche. It counteracted the acidity with its sweetness. The green tea gnocchi was melt worthy and a perfect contradiction to our cold ceviche. Who knew combining the flavors of green tea with gnocchi would be such a tasty marriage. It was basically green tea flavored potatoes. I absolutely loved it - so much so that I had ordered another to bring home and eat the next day.Our entrees did not disappoint either. The filet mignon was cooked medium and for me a bit overcooked but the shitake peppercorn sauce compensated well. The salmon teriyaki was definitely the winner of the entrees. It was the combination of the thick teriyaki sauce, the grilled salmon and the avocado that elevated the dish. The sea bass was cooked perfectly and had all the right amounts of fat. It had some green tea spaghetti and some steamed vegetables on the side. The green tea spaghetti was a valiant effort in combining east coast tastes with the western country innovations but it fell slightly short. The omakase (or is it omakasu) selection is what it is - just a couple of sashimi slices on a tray (not worth it in my opinion). For dessert we had the tempura cheesecake, the chocolate cake option, the banana spring roll and the green tea ice cream. All of the dessert options were so rich and heavy we couldn't finish any of it. We were so full from our appetizers and entrees we took our time. The tempura cheesecake is basically cheesecake fried in batter with strawberry drizzle and strawberry pieces. Each bite you would have to top it with the drizzle and strawberry. The banana spring roll was the same - it was crispy from the crepe but very similar to Kittichai's banana spring roll dessert. The chocolate cake was extremely rich - almost too rich and tough to swallow (definitely needed a glass of milk). It's always great when restaurants add a little bit on the top for us and offers us something free. For example Natsumi gave us sample glasses of sake. We had four different types - plum, lychee, blueberry and peach. Each one was definitely tough to drink - especially at the end of our meal. If we had it during our entrees it would've been better but hey who are we to complain? We got free sake! I would definitely come back to try their other options. Oh and as a fyi - if you need to go to the bathroom it is located in the bar. DO NOT GO TO THE BATHROOM DOWNSTAIRS from the hotel hallway.

We had the Ceviche and Sushi starters as appetizers. They were both fantastic, one bite into his sushi and the hubs was staring at me- he was so happy. We both got the Omakase Chef's Choice entree. It was fantastic the roll they had was a jalapeño and tuna. Amazing! All the sushi was fantastic and very fresh. Perfect buttery cuts. We can tell the quality of the sushi by if the hubs is hungry by the end of the meal- he wasn't! That's what happens when you have quality cuts of fish and a developed rice recipe.

2.0,1/29/2013,"I am going to start with the positive - the decor is great.  We were seated right away.  The food however was subpar.  The sushi quality looked nice but was actually chewy and fishy.  The crab dumpling and salmon appetizers were also not as fresh tasting were fishy as they should have been.  The calamari actually was nice and made differently but could use better and more sauce with it.  The service was weirdly spotty .   From the beginning we said we were going to an 8pm show, considering their location and the early dinner that should have been a given but just in case we told our waitress.  We waited 20mins before we could even place our order and it came out a bit on the slow side.  She did check-in in the middle but getting our check was almost impossible - we lost her completely.  We had to ask the Host b/c we basically had about 15mins to make it to the theater by the time we wrapped it all up.  I realize the place is new and attached to a hotel but they have lots of kinks to work out.",0,0,0,Melissa C.,"Manhattan, NY",14,117,50

4.0,1/27/2013,"Natsumi has become one of my go-to restaurants for grabbing a drink after work or getting a casual dinner (either in the restaurant or delivery). Natsumi has a sit-down restaurant and an adjacent lounge. I've actually only sat in the sit-down restaurant once or twice and much prefer the lounge. The lounge has nice, comfortable seats, a good ambiance, and it's never too crowded. I've tried a lot of the food at the restaurant and I've liked most everything that I've had, but my current favorites are:Maki Combination: For under $20, you get your choice of three rolls. I usually pick the salmon avocado, spicy tuna, and crunchy spicy salmon. That's 18 pieces in all (6 of each type), which is a great deal! Also, if you're ordering for delivery, the combination comes with a small salad. Edamame Dumpling Soup: I love this soup, especially in the cold weather. One order is actually a lot though, so if you're a party of two, you may want to consider ordering just one soup and asking the restaurant to split it into two bowls (they did it for us).   Dumplings: I've tried all the dumplings (king crab, edamame, chicken & shrimp) and I don't think you can go wrong with any of them.  Other good dishes: I've also had the calamari, pizza nuova, miso black cod appetizer, and rock shrimp tempura, all of which I thought were pretty good. Aside from the food, Natsumi also has a pretty extensive drink selection, with their own cocktail concoctions, sake, beer, and wine. They have happy hour specials most every day so if you're around Midtown West / Hells Kitchen, it's a great place to grab a drink after work or get together for a casual dinner.

There's plenty of cooked items to choose from like our BBQ short ribs, tofu ravioli with a Parmesan cream sauce or even the edamame dumpling soup.

4.0,6/9/2012,"Natsumi is a great place for lunch, dinner and drinks amongst the mid-town touristy area. Most around mid-town theater district, you've got the chained restaurants, fast food, costly expense account places. It's hard to find a local, reasonably priced good food, quiet, space with nice atmosphere and not over crowded place. The lunch box is a great deal with two big bento boxes full of varieties of sushi, tempura, teriyaki, gyoza...etc. The cocktails and little bites are great as well.

2.0,2/4/2012,"I made a reservation for a party of 3 on a Fri night. Natsumi is separated into two sides with separate entrances- the lounge and the restaurant. I guess what divides the establishment is a hotel in the middle. Once the hostess realized I booked under a deal voucher, (noted for lounge only) she asked if we would wait until one of the tables were available. Why were reservations even necessary for the lounge area in the first place? The manager then asked if we would like to sit in the executive suite. Of course, I thought this meant upgraded to the restaurant area. To our dismay, their  executive suite was the manager's private room complete with flat screen TV's and seating lounge area. The room was isolated from the lounge/restaurant where it leads into the back of a room (part of the hotel). This was a bit creepy although I appreciated the courtesy of not making us wait. The room was high temperature and incredibly uncomfortable. My friends requested to wait until we had seats available. The hostess then informed us seats were available by the bar after letting us know we would have to ""wait a looong time"" before anything is open. Of course, we jumped at the offer. It was better than sitting in a creepy room far from the lounge/restaurant. We never saw her again once seated.A server came and apologized and asked if we would like to order drinks to start. We all had the mojitos- peach/mango/pineapple. I enjoyed the twist on the mojito with the flavors. We ordered appetizers and a main entree to share- king crab dumpling (pretty good for a replica of a dish at a chinese dim-sum), tempura veggies (it was decent but nothing spectacular) and  pom-glazed tilapia with rock shrimp, shiitake, and asparagus. The tilapia was served with a sweet soy sauce over rice. The sauce didn't do much to enhance the dish. I'll note however, the tilapia was cooked really well and retain the juices. The portions of the dishes were decent. However, the food was mediocre at its best. The only positive recommendation I'll give for a touristy spot is to grab drinks with friends/coworkers. I'm sure the ambiance for the restaurant is wonderful compared to the lounge according to the the reviews. Overall, I'm certain you'll find better representation and quality of food elsewhere for the overpriced tab. Needless to say I was quite disappointed!",3,0,2,Linda W.,"New York, NY",112,494,138

Natsumi comfortably sits in the middle as a nice date location that doesn't break the bank. I came here with a Gilt City deal and found the restaurant packed on a Thursday night. The appetizer and sushi were very good, but I remember my friend's bulgogi entree being average and very saucy.

Both were delish but the Beef asparagus maki I must say was to die for.  I ordered the Spicy Rock Shrimp Avocado as well as the Shrimp Tempura (I always order something I'm familiar with just in case I don't like whatever new I'm trying out).  Both were really really good and they are definitely NOT stingy with the shrimp.    For dessert I ordered the Cheesecake Tempura ... and before I continue I just want to say that whenever my bf and I go out for dinner he NEVER gets dessert - he's just not into sweets as much so Im always left alone eating dessert by myself lol.  Well he certainly did not hesitate last night.  He absolutely LOVED this dessert.  I highly recommend trying this.  This was my first but most certainly not the last visit I'll have at Natsumi.,1,0,1,Jacqueline D.,"Bronxville, NY",36,18,0

We thought it would be small five pieces of raw-ish pork, but when it came out, it was five large breaded and deep fried pieces. It resembled five small pieces of donkatsu. Small compared to regular sized donkatsu. Small five pieces = at least 1 donkatus.We also got the shrimp and vegetable tempura. Delish. Lighly breaded, perfectly fried. Also good portions. I think there were three pieces of shrimp and good amount of vegetables.We both got the sushi entree. The roll (tempura roll that came with this one) was huge too. It was not 4-6 pieces that other places give you - more like 8-10. We definitely doggy-bagged the roll and ate the sushi. Sushi = delish. By this point, we were so full that we just picked off the fish part and it was good. It was not fishy, it somewhat melted in your mouth.We then proceeded with dessert. Big mistake. We were already full. We got the famed tempura cheesecake. I did not know what to expect. It is two smalls quares of cream cheese or that has been fried on the outside. It's quite delicious.

Apparently, it was for the lounge area and we did not realize that. The host/manager sat us at a table in the nice restaurant area. Then, the waiter realized we had a coupon and they moved us to the lounge area. I was a little annoyed, but since the deal said it was for the lounge area, I guess that was our mistake. So fine. They sit us down on low seated areas with a really low tiny table for two of us to share, while we were obviously going to order normal food and plates. The seating was uncomfortable considering we didn't come for drinks. Then, the waitress comes over and we give her the coupon and she tells us it's only for one person. OMG! How is that a deal when the coupon covered the normal price of the food? And there was a ""special"" menu for the deal, meaning that the portions were smaller and the options were very limited. Nothing really caught our eye. So whatever, we ordered something from that menu and something from the regular menu. They were just as expensive. The experience was terrible. Besides that, there was a band playing extremely loud music that I was not a fan of. Why can't you just have the DJ spin some normal music that is not such a ruckus? We asked if we could be moved to a quieter area because the music was really annoying us. They said they had somewhere in the back and we were hesitant because were they planning to sit us in the bathroom or kitchen or something? I was like forget it. You don't know how much I wanted to get up and walk out if it wasn't for the stupid deal we already bought online!Anyways, because I was already so damn annoyed, I don't even remember what the food taste like.

We had the GroupOn deal for a prix fix for 2 with 2 cocktails each. I'm also leery of this also since the 'choices' are usually terrible. I was pleasantly surprised. We were seated promptly, the wait staff was very attentive and friendly. The choices from the limited menu was the usual miso soup, house salad so we tried the less typical. As for the meal itself i would say the dishes tended to be on the lesser seasoned side of things. I think asparagus gnocchi was quite good. It was light and the sauce creamy.  The king crab dumpling was decent. The butterfly green tea dumplings was memorable. The chicken Teriyaki was that and the Pom-glazed tilapia was cooked well but again a bit under seasoned.Overall, the service was excellent but the food other than the usual array of sushi, sashimi, tempura platter the food was okay. It is good for the area if you want before seeing a show and the tourist but in a city of food choices there are plenty of other Asian fusion(Italian) that I consider much better like Basta Pasta in Chelsea where the service is also excellent but the big difference is the food was memorable.",1,0,0,David N.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,631,903

1.0,1/25/2011,"I think this place caters to people who don't normally eat sushi. I realized this when my plate of sushi came with NO wasabi and NO ginger. What sushi restaurant does not serve these condiments with sushi (unless it is omakase, at the bar, and they pre-dress the sushi for you)? I ordered the following:1/2 dozen blue point oysters: the oysters were actually pretty good. The precious oyster juice was in tact, the oysters were fresh, and they were dressed with some ponzu sauce. King Crab Dumplings: The dumplings were overstuffed with a lot of crab meat, I am not sure if it was fresh or packaged. The dumpling skin was fair, but I have learned that dumplings are always better the cheap way (in chinatown from Prosperity or the sorts). Chef's Creation (Matsu - $80 for 2 people): The selection included 2 rolls, 4 pieces of sashimi, 6 pieces of nigiri, gazpachio. (Divide everything by 2 for ""per person count.') Also includes 1 glass of sake. The tuna (sashimi) was not fatty tuna - definitely something I expected if the chef's selection was $40 per person. The yellowtail (sashimi) was a large yet unsatisfying piece. One roll was filled with asparagus, shrimp, eel, and salmon and then fried with a tempura coating. It sat in a sea of eel sauce. This roll was fair, but not notable. The other roll had not-so-fresh tuna with ""gold flakes"" and red tobiko. The filling consisted of crunchy spicy tuna and apple. It was devoid of any fresh fish flavor. The nigiri consisted of salmon, red snapper, and seared tuna with avocado on top. The rice was of acceptable sweetness, however, it was hard and fell apart instantly. The pieces were large and clumsy - hard to dip in soy sauce/wasabi. The fish itself was bland. All in all, this restaurant is selling fast-food sushi in a fancy restaurant setting. I was very very disappointed. You are paying a lot of money for the convenience of the location and the atmosphere of the restaurant. However, the wait staff was great - they were very courteous and always refilled our waters.

The portions were ample and the slices cut in long strips to really bring out the flavor. Just on the sashimi alone I would have given at least 3 1/2 stars, but I also enjoyed 3 of the nicest oysters I've ever tasted and an incredible edemame dumpling soup, made with onions and shitake mushrooms that was out of this world. I'd make the trip again just to have that soup.

4.0,9/10/2010,"This is a take-out review...I can't comment on the service for eat in since I haven't actually eaten there yet. We passed this place last week and saw that it was started by Haru (the chef behind...well, Haru). Liking that place quite a bit we figured we'd try this. On tap: Edemame, Rock Shrimp Tempura, Yellowtail scallion roll, Veggie tempura roll, Shrimp tempura roll., Super white tuna roll.  All the food was excellent. No complaints at all. Thought the Rock Shrimp and white tuna in particular were great. Here's the reason why I went with 4 over maybe 3 1/2 stars (well, if you could rate it with 1/2 stars) - the service for take-out. They were very nice while I waited, as I ordered it when I got there. They gave me a seat and water. Not necessarily amazing, but a lot of places just make you stand by the door waiting for 20 minutes. Not here. Very friendly. Most of the staff was as well. Watched a waitress drop a balled up napkin or something else on the floor and she proceeded to pick it up with a clean napkin AND wash her hands. Small thing, but a big bonus in my eyes.So, I get home. went to the supermarket on the way, walked the dog. Then opened the package...I was missing two rolls! I called them up and they apologized and already had them waiting. The delivery guy was there in literally five minutes. While it wasn't a far distance, they clearly sent it out right away AND he hustled. AND they gave us $10 in gift certificates. They run that place the right way and the food is good. What more can you ask for? We'll definitely be eating there soon.** I've since eaten at the restaurant and the service was great. No complaints and still haven't had a bad experience here, dine-in or take-out **The drinks at the bar are hideously overpriced, though. And who adds tax on top of the price? I think that's a first for me sitting at a bar. Why not just make it a round number with the tax already in there. You lost a little bit of a tip there on that one.",0,0,0,David B.,"New York, NY",8,26,0

Regular, sleek & modern...which suits me fine.Started with steamed chicken & shrimp dumplings. Very good - standard I should say. Our main course consisted of a good variety of Sushi rolls - Salmon Pepperocini was yummy & so fresh. Yellow tail jalapeno was spicy but so flavorful. The tuna avocado was good as well. We also had the yellow tail sashimi - so fresh...the fish really melted in my mouth. So, all in all, it was a good Sushi dinner experience right here in the neighborhood & that too not very pricey (by good-decent Sushi standards) at all.I've def. had better & of course paid more...but this was standard & good too.

We had a drink at the bar, which unless you can get seats at the bar, the tables are very awkward and the stools are higher than the tables, making it very weird to sit and eat, so we went across the lobby to eat. Dinner consisted of king crab dumplings, very good, edamame and several rolls. We tried the salmon avocado (excellent), california for my safe-eating dinner companion, shrimp tempora (disappointing, there was way too much mayo and the roll fell apart when you ate it) and spicy tuna (good but not great). For being midtown, the place was cute, staff was attentive and prices were reasonable.

4.0,6/27/2010,"""Yay im a fan"" Indeed i am!Stumbled into here on one of my ""hey whats this place we're passing?"" exploration moments, after leaving craptastic blockheads up the block. They say its japanese/italian fusion food, but i dont think theres much italian in the mix. still YUMMY none the less. We begun to look at the menu just for kicks (on the barside, i dont know if the menu is different or bigger on the restaraunt side). Small selection of food and drinks but good stuff. I actually preffer that cause i tend to get overwhelmed and confused with too many menu options, i appreciate places that just specialize and stick to it. So then a lady that was sitting next to us started to volunteer recommendations and schooled us on how chilled sake is of a higher quality than the hot ones (turns out she was to start working there the following week, but her pitch was still personal and passionate and informative and genuine, she wasn't b.s.ing us just to sell stuff) So we were originally just looking at the menu and leaving, but her sake info made us want to try it, as i had only had hot sake before. So we tried their finest cold sake and it was indeed nice and smooth and refreshing and light w/ no aftertaste. And the chick was just really nice and carrying a great convo even tho she wasnt working there yet. She invited us to something again on friday, and i had written down all her recommendations and promised to come back and try them all since she made everything sound so good! I came friday after work since i work in the area, to support her and try some more stuff. We had their finest mu cold sake again but a whole bottle this time and tried the seafood tabaniaki, or something like that, which was greaaat. It was a big heap of seafood (lobster, salmon, scallops, shrimp, you name it) in this generous brown sauce with a side of white rice and i think brocoli? i dont remember. it was YUMMY. and fed 3 people! I came back again afterwork and tried their king crab dumplins and some summer special blueberry lemonade cocktail. another hit!I was originally just going there to support that nice chick (whos name i cant remember) but i cant wait to go back and try some more stuff, im always craving their menu, and its a nice refreshing spot to stop in all this blazing fire sun. They dont leave the door open if its too hot, they have a good judgement going with the AC system (i hate places that are too cold or hot). Everythings so yummy and in good portions and come in these nice bamboo basket things and they give you a nicely folded napkin with utensils and chopsticks,  and the layout is nice and clean and still intimately lit. Never too crowded, but then again i always go to the bar side, not the restauraunt side, and id say the prices are moderate, appetizers average 10 bux, entrees 20-30, bottle of sake about 70 bux, by the glass its about 6-12, and i think i had a glass of pinot grigio for like 9 bux so thats not bad. Im so craving their refreshing seafood and sake menu right now, mmmmmm. It may deserve 5 stars but i just dont give out 5 stars that easily, something amazing and different really has to happen for that 5th star, but this one comes close.",2,1,1,eLLe D.,"New York, NY",15,110,42

The place was orig a Jap/Italian fusion but the Italian flavor didn't really go well so only a few things remain with that inspiration....The Pizza Nuova is one such inspiration and it's basically like a sushi pizza..  Pretty good but not for a sushi purist (which I'm not anywayz)....  Any of the carpaccio is good as well... I had the tuna last time and very well prepared... My fav app at natsumi is the Nasu Dengaku which is eggplant in sauce with melted mozzarella... so so so goooood...The starters are really the highlights at this place.  Again, I'm not a sushi lover but I do get cravings sometimes.  The sushi and sashimi are fresh enough. Lots of different specialty rolls Cooked entrees include steak or chicken teriyaki.  Nothing really special.  I've had the chilean sea bass done japanese style there before.  Dessert is excellent.  Tempura cheesecake.. wow, and love love love the tartufoes... which is green tea and red bean ice cream dark chocolate shell...  I would really just go here.. start with a few drinks at the lounge and enjoy a bevy of apps and rolls...  and def def save room for some dessert........

4.0,1/28/2010,"Let me tell you a little story so you know how much I freaking love sushi. Once upon a time, long ago, when I was first getting used to the idea of eating raw fish, I fell in love with sake (salmon) sashimi. Well.. being the uncultured, ignorant little kid that I was, I went and bought regular salmon from the grocery store thinking it would be the same. I look back and still can't believe I actually ate that stuff. Mind you - it was a one time thing and I didn't eat it all! Since then, my love of sushi has only grown, so you can imagine how much I love it by now.I usually order delivery from Natsumi (via Seamless Web), so I wont comment on the ambiance of the restaurant. The salmon shiso avocado tartar with orange & wasabi tobiko is to die for! Clearly though, I love salmon. But this one appetizer is the whole reason I order all the way from Natsumi rather than any of the other sushi places.The chirashi comes with a LOT of rice - perhaps a little too much for my taste - and I love carbs. The fish is fresh, but thinly cut. I'd rather suggest getting the rolls. They're a much better deal and more flavorful overall. The vegetable tempura is a heavily battered, so if you're not keen on that, I would suggest ordering something else.I could go for a salmon + avocado roll right about now....",3,2,2,Jenn L.,"New York, NY",221,317,547

2.0,6/12/2009,Pseudo Trendy decor? Check. Chinese sushi chefs pretending to be Japanese? Check. Long-ass wait for takeout? Check. Looking for a solid takeout place by work brought me here. $15 for three rolls I wasn't expecting anything mind-blowing but something at least would satiate my desire for miso and tuna. Rolls were small and the rice was dry. The nori was soggy. This place should really be called Natshiti.,2,4,0,Jeff F.,"Forest Hills, NY",11,50,0

I think sometimes other restaurants have too much of the fried stuff and not enough of the actual calamari. Natsumi roll: what a great way to start my first meal in New York, it just had a really fresh taste to it.Natsumi Sling: Very fruity but not overly sweet like some sweet drinks can be.Blueberry Mojito: I've actually never seen a mojito made with fruit as well which was a big surprise for me.

The Gold Leaf roll was a great combination of fresh fish and the sweet flavor of mango. The added touch of gold leaf and sauces made for an excellent presentation. The Doppio Toro roll was good, though I'm not sure what made the salmon and yellowtail ""Toro"". I've had regular Toro, and the difference between that and Maguro is quite noticeable.

4.0,3/4/2009,"A great sushi place in a small Time Square hotel?  Eh, I had my doubts...but I was pleasantly surprised!  The restaurant's stylish interior was packed on a Friday evening.  The patrons were definitely more New Yorkers than tourists.  The drink menu offered unusual and potent cocktails, such as the fantastic Mango Mojito was packed with fresh mint leaves and mango puree.  The sweet fruitiness went down a bit too easily, seeing as how I ordered two large glasses full of the tasty beverage.  The $24 Sushi Deluxe entree came with a decent miso soup, 9 pieces of sushi (2 tuna, 2 salmon, 2 yellowtail, 1 whitefish, 1 tobiko, and 1 shrimp), plus a spicy tuna roll.  All of the fish was very fresh and delicious.  I devoured the entire platter, though, knowing me that is not a huge shock :)Natsumi is a welcome and recommended addition to the cheesy Time Square area.",0,0,0,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

4.0,11/29/2008,In  NYC on vacation and 4 of us ate here for dinner on 11/26. 3 of us had sushi combinations without any complaints. For my good fortune the other two combinations had flying fish roe which is my favorite and not theirs. The other dinner had teriayki steak which was to her delight. As expected in a Japanses restuarant the presentaion was flawlessFor desert there is a fried cheese cake that must be eaten to believe how wonderful it is. The wine list includes a number of house labeled wines from Italy. We had a white from Friuli that was consistant with its price.The decor is sparce Japanese but pleasing.

We had checked out the menu before we went and i was ecstatic to try the edamame dumplings. I'm a huge fan of dumplings and edamame so the combination was just thrilling. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I asked for extra dressings and things to dip the tasteless dumplings in and it still did nothing. I was thoroughly disappointed. The sweet potato tempura roll was good. The other sushi my friends had was very average. Apparently their parents duck and noodle dishes were good, but not outstanding. The desserts on the other hand were INCREDIBLE. We weren't even still hungry, and we got them and they were amazing.This is the place to go for drinks or dessert, not for a great meal.

2.0,11/24/2008,"I was a teeny bit disappointed that the restaurant was so small and the bar area looked nothing like the pictures on the website.  It would have been a lot nicer, if half the bar area wasn't being used for storage of boxes and other items in plain view.   The $11 bellini was nothing special, and I should have switched to beer immediately after but instead opted for a martini that didn't do much for me either.  Luckily, the food was better than the drinks.  We ordered the rock shrimp and ceviche appetizers-- the rock shrimp app was great, and it was nicely sized for three people which worked well because the ceviche never made it to our table.  The server did not seem to notice, and when we said something there wasn't really much of a response.  Next thing we knew, the rolls we ordered were dropped at our table and the case of the missing ceviche went unsolved.  I enjoyed my special roll with spicy tuna, shrimp tempura and tobiko but my friend was not very impressed with hers.  We passed on dessert for the fear of being underwhelmed again.  Natsumi... notsomuchi!",2,4,1,Michelle C.,"Philadelphia, PA",4305,2009,2889

She love love and might I add...""LOVE"" sushi .She searched high and low for a romantic and fabulous sushi place to dine on that special day with her significant other and friends. Months and weeks passed, she can't eat, she can't sleep. Yes, she's in love. She's found ""the one"".     Natsumi, Natsumi, oh wherefore art thou Natsumi? Thou sushi rolls and romantic atmosphere have captured a maiden's pure heart. The radiance of the night, the romance of the day, Natsumi's the one, who took my heart away...Oh how can I dare say no...to your savory sushi rolls? Ok..ok...back to the 21st century (lol) :     Upon arriving at Natsumi, the hostess warmly greeted us and escorted us to our table. The place setting was absolutely romantic! Candles were lit everywhere and the waiter came over with a complimentary bottle of Blue Bird martini. We ordered shortly after I finished unwrapping the presents. What more could a girl ask for? A great venue to celebrate her birthday, a terrific boyfriend, great friends, and awesome birthday gifts!        Amongst the seven of us, we decided to get appetizers and individual entrees. We started off with shrimp tempuras $10, crispy calamari $10, and king crab dumplings $8.50. The crispy calamari is heavenly divine! I would highly recommend it!  The shrimp tempura and crab dumplings were ok, not bad. For entrees, we ordered two grilled chicken teriyaki $16 ea. , two maki combination choice of 3rolls of spicy tuna roll, crunchy spicy salmon, and a California roll $18 ea. , one dragon roll $17, and a red sea roll which consist of spicy tuna, red tobiko, and shrimp tempura for $16. We also ordered the crab caviar roll but to my dismay, they didn't have it that night. All of the dishes were very well prepared and they're designs are exclusive! Everything we ordered were fresh and delightful. We ate, we drank, and we chatted away. At the end of the meal, the waiter came over with desserts and to my surprise, it was a birthday gift on the house. We had tempura cheesecake drizzled with berry sauce that melted divinely as we ate it. The total came out roughly around $250 including 18% gratuity for parties of 6 or more and drinks.

3.0,5/10/2008,"3.5 Stars:Despite a mediocre experience with the tuna tartare I had for delivery from here, I chose the lounge at Natsumi for a first date--mostly because of it's proximity to my apartment (in case I needed to make a quick getaway).  The food here is ""Japanese - Italian fusion"" which sounded a little strange, but the place looked so nice I figured it was worth a shot.  I arrived to find my date already seated at the bar and was promptly greeted by the friendly bartender.  I was surprised by how much I enjoyed sitting at the bar--the bartender was chatty enough to help entertain my date and I without being too invasive.  I was also pleased to find that the Yankees game was on the tv at the bar as well as a larger screen on the side of the lounge.  As for the drinks, I had the Lychee Martini and the Ginger Cosmo--both of which I found to be perfectly strong and delicious.  Once my ""meeting for drinks"" turned into ""dinner for two"" we ordered the green tea raviolis to start followed by two sushi rolls (seared salmon and spider).  The appetizer was kinda ""eh""...didn't taste as good as it sounded.  The sushi rolls were better--the pesto sauce on the side of the seared salmon roll and the basil in the spider roll were right on the mark in terms of making the fusion of two very different types of cuisines work.  I didn't find the food overall to leave a tremendous impression, but I enjoyed the new spin on sushi.On the whole I found Natsumi to be a fairly pleasant experience (the tab was a little high, but not completely out of the ordinary).  I would definitely recommend the lounge for a first date as the ambiance had the sex appeal of a swanky lounge without any of the pretentiousness.  I'll certainly be back...even if only for a drink.",0,1,0,Adrienne R.,"Brooklyn, NY",101,49,0

I made reservations just to be safe and we got in smoothly. When you walk into the doors the bar is located on the right and the restaurant on the left. The bar has a cool waterfall on one wall which put off great ambiance and made the setting quite intimate.Our table in the restaurant was located next to the front windows which over look a pleasantly busy 50th street. As mean as it sounds, our entertainment for the night was watching innocent pedestrians walking on the sidewalk slip and fall. The ice storm that hit NYC that night really didn't make walking on the sidewalks easy at all. We decided to order a shrimp tempura roll for our appetizer and the roll along with the mustard sauce that accompanied it were truly special. The wine menu had bottles ranging anywhere from $30 to $125 and we opted for a tasty Merlot. The main courses were next and I ordered the Mixed grill (shrimp and chicken) while the missus ordered the teriyaki chicken. The shrimp were big and tasty and the sauce glazed over the chicken was perfectly sweet. We ordered the Banana Spring Rolls to finish and really couldn't have made a better decision. I never knew that frying a banana and dipping it into chocolate would open Heaven's gates.The waiters and staff were all very friendly and let us enjoy our meal in peace but were always there when we needed them.I don't go to NYC often but when I do go back and am craving some Japanese, I'll definitely go back to Natsumi.",2,3,3,Danny K.,"London, United Kingdom",17,117,0
