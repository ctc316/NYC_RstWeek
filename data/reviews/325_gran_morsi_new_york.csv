4.0,4/22/2019,"I got married here about a month ago, and it truly is a great venue! It is a little hidden, but what's on the inside is gorgeous. The staff were so helpful and friendly from the very start, well before the actual day-of my wedding! They worked with us on our budget and were extremely accommodating. Though a lot of things seemed to go wrong on my special day, this venue was not one of them. The room was gorgeous and the food was great as well! The dim & romantic lighting, with the greenery and brick walls was so perfect and made for some great photos. Loved being here!",0,0,0,Gabby G.,"Seattle, WA",205,12,16
5.0,4/20/2019,"First of all, the food here is amazing. This is definitely not traditional Italian food, but it has a unique flavorful twist on every single dish. The restaurant itself is very simple/elegant. It was a great pick for date night. This place is definitely on my favorites list now.",0,0,0,Anastasiya M.,"Jersey City, NJ",252,15,1
5.0,4/15/2019,I absolutely loved Gran Morsi. There's some delicious Italian in NYC so for a place to be a true standout it needs to be damn good. Well Gran Morsi is fantastic. The octopus was cooked perfectly and comes with a great sauce. Then came the eggplant parm and side pasta and they were both spot on. My favorite of the night was the English pea and ricotta Ravioli that comes in a preserved lemon sauce with mint and pearl onions. It tastes like a sunny spring day on the Mediterranean coast. Finished the meal with a chocolate tart which was also just perfectly executed. Wish I had known about this place earlier.,0,0,1,Valbona S.,"New York, NY",156,92,71

2.0,3/16/2019,"Very disappointing experience. The service was haphazard and the food did not justify the high prices. we waited 10 minutes for a table after we had made a reservation. Fine it's busy. No problem. But then the bartender could only recommend the two most expensive cocktails. We waited 15 mins after we finished our main courses for a side dish to come. The portions were small and the food was good but not $35 per entree, $25 per appetizer and $16 per cocktail good. I'd say go somewhere else.",0,0,0,Benjamin Lorish R.,"New York, NY",0,4,0
5.0,3/14/2019,"I was initially struck by how much I liked the super clean and minimal decor. It has that kind of white-washed industrial vibe with high ceilings. The gender-ambivalent bathrooms were a nice touch. Their menu Negroni is wonderful. It featured good ice and the bartendress prepared the drink expertly. I also tried the Smoky Paloma, which was well-made too.In terms of food, I think my favorite item was the house made focaccia, rubbed with chili oil. It was super delicious and paired well with the burrata appetizer dressed with poached pear. Salty, sweet, spicy, mmm!I'd definitely go back and was quite happy with the experience.",2,0,0,Evan J.,"Austin, TX",100,193,26

While the service was slow - Every single item was spectacular. The artichokes were amazinggg. They had the perfect hint of lemon. The buratta is not something I would have thought to order, but it was so good. It was smooth, creamy and very fresh. I had the pappradelle bolognese and it was fill, but so good I had to finish it.

5.0,2/20/2019,"Chris and I came here for dinner after utilizing the Yelp app for suggestions near our hotel.It's just five minutes from the Four Seasons Hotel.  The dining room is stunning with an amazing vertical living wall of plants.  The bar and dining area our small but provide patrons with plenty of space separate from other people.After reviewing the menu we chose to dine at the bar and order from the happy hour menu. The prices were a great value for a high end restaurant.We ordered an assortment of the specialty cocktails as well as the salad, the burratta pizza plus the meatballs.The friendly bartender took care of us the entire evening and informed us that the meatballs were featured with their chef on the Food Network show ""Beat Bobby Flay"" and they were the winning dish. I don't eat meat but my brother who is a chef proclaimed the meatballs as amazing!The salad was fresh and the pizza had a thin crispy crust and was delicious!!The chocolate dessert with the pear and ice cream was decadent.The happy hour menu is value priced by New York standards.

5.0,2/19/2019,"Love love love love love. Visited on Valentines Day for their special prix fixe menu and boyyyyy am I in love. The interior is so cute and classic, modern, simple and bijou.To start, we ordered the Scallops and Baby Arugula Salad. The scallops were perfectly seared on the outside and soft and tender in the inside. It was perfectly put together with black truffle, blood oranges and other creative ingredients to bring out and compliment each flavor. The arugula salad was very fresh and was perfectly complimented with clementines, almonds and piave.For the main, we ordered Filet Mignon and Duck Breast. Both the meats were cooked to perfection and boasted a juicy, tender texture. The chef did an amazing job putting together these dishes for Valentine's Day. The ingredients as you can see in my pictures were unique, creative and were very well thought out. Each bite was a new adventure of its own.We finished with alcohol-infused desserts which were also very unique and creative. This spot is quite pricey but in my opinion worth. every. penny. Their portions are quite small but the creativity and thought put into each plate will leave your tongue in awe.

5.0,1/23/2019,"Wow!!!!! One of the best Italian meals I have ever had in NYC! Not to mention by far the best Bolognese I have ever had- even better than Italy. This restaurant knows what they are doing. The vibe, succulent plant wall, and menu is top notch. Stand outs were the burrata, Bolognese, and garganelli with truffles. This will be my loyal go to!

4.0,10/30/2018,"My wife and I used the Gran Morsi (all the cool kids call it ""The Morsi"") for our 10 year wedding anniversary. I don't want to gush about them but they were great! From day one they were accommodating and they kept the process fun. While I feel that I spoke with a lot of different people in the beginning our party was eventually handled by Freddy and Gina. Gina is a dreamboat when it comes to answering questions. As we had not planned anything this extensive (DJ, Food, Venue, signature cocktails) in a while we had over a hundred separate questions and Gina was always available by email to answer them. In addition we looked at the place a few times to make sure our vision for this event wasn't too ambitious and even in person she was funny and knowledgeable and she cared about the process. I am sure it never stopped being work for her but it seemed like she was passionate about making our party what we wanted it to be. Even when hiccups in our custom made items threaten to derail order Gina and Freddy put the train back on the tracks easily. The space is really nice and pretty sound proof. If there are events on both floors I am sure they wouldn't disturb each other. Also the food is AMAZING! It strikes me as a very simple rustic Italian menu and I everything that I have had was better than great. They sell the BEST fettucine Alfredo I have EVER had in life. It is to die for. Their chicken parm is perfect and the homemade pasta hit all the check boxes for us! Their bar staff and drinks are also delicious. We added two signature cocktails (normally not included) to our menu because we had them in the restaurant and fell in love. Every one of my guest loved them as well as the traditional favorites. The Pros are everything above. I could not recommend this place enough and we will be using it in the future for other parties. One Con is that, though EVERYTHING that we ordered was DELICIOUS,  some of it was not served in the main restaurant. Similarly, Gran Morsi DOES NOT offer tastings. This forced us to have a couple of meals there on our own dime and then order items from the event menu sight unseen or taste untasted. Even though everything was good we would have liked to either have a sponsored tasting or at least had the ability to buy all of the items we were purchasing for the Party in the main restaurant. Also Gran Morsi charges full price if you have vendors that you would like to feed. Other venues might charge a discounted rate but Gran Morsi does not.   Over all they made our party amazing. Food was delicious and the staff was great!",0,0,0,D C.,"Manhattan, BOWLING GREEN, NY",0,1,0
5.0,10/30/2018,"The restaurant was a bit difficult to find as the signage was not well lit. However, once I was able to find it, it met all my expectations.  I had Eggplant parmigiana on the recommendation of the waiter as I have food restrictions.  The eggplant was just awesome. It was served in a small skillet and while the serving looked small, it was just phenomenal.  I had a glass of Barolo to go with my wine.  I requested the wine be chilled a bit, which the staff gladly accommodated.

Now food, just pure satisfaction! Maddie was very charming and definitely knew her menu really well.

4.0,10/21/2018,"Tucked away into sidewalks of TriBeCa, Gran Morsi is a quaint gem you will miss if you don't stare intently at all the stores lined up. The interior decor is gorgeous--with the small space, the architect and owner have utilized every square foot to the max in a beautiful fashion. For one, diners can actually breathe and sit at the tables without feeling suffocated. Drinks are not bad although I'd need to return to try some of the other cocktails on the menu. The cocktails all have safe flavors and concoctions that cannot go wrong unless the wine is sour (aka the Sangria seemed to have expired alcohol). Food wise, I only tried the appetizers--is it anything mindblowing? No, not necessarily, but I enjoyed my artichokes! Would I return, again, for either business or casual dinners? Yes. The ambiance and varied menu items allow guests to enjoy their meal and drinks without the rush.",1,0,0,Christine K.,"New York, NY",41,334,1

4.0,9/22/2018,"This is more of a New American restaurant though one could view it as an Italian.Really pretty food. The squid, the salad, the fried seafood, the meat balls are just insanely good. Pizza is huge. The pastas are all house made and very substantial. I would absolutely recommend this place if you are looking for something classy and with really good variety. For me, I try to stay with carb light items, so the fish was the one I would get. The most beautiful dish of all is the watermelon radish squid. Very pretty.You should try to order the sides and the main to share as the portion is huge. Very reasonably priced dishes to boot. The ambience is very good, could be a date or a group restaurant. Another Michelin guide restaurant. Put this on your TriBeCa list.",6,2,5,Victoria E.,"San Francisco, CA",673,819,16212
5.0,9/22/2018,"This place is really delicious and beautiful! I visited on a Friday night (8pm reservations)bee were seated right away and were super impressed with the simple yet lovely aesthetic of the restaurant. We ordered bread for the table, mushroom pizza, the bolognese pasta and the truffle white pasta and everything was above expectations! I cannot praise Gran Morsi enough for the quality of their food. I have been to plenty of Italian restaurants and they have all lacked flavor, but not here. The only con I guess, is that it's a bit pricey but it's expected for the area and quality.",0,0,0,Yari G.,"Manhattan, NY",118,48,81
5.0,9/10/2018,"We had our rehearsal dinner for our wedding in the private dining room downstairs at Gran Morsi and it was great.  The food was served family style and it was very good and reasonably priced compared to other places we considered.  The room was pretty and they have live plants in one of the walls, which was great for the ambiance.  It also has its own dedicated bar.    After dinner, which was reserved for just the wedding party and immediate family, we had a cocktail party in the same room for all of the wedding guests.  The staff was very attentive and helpful in making sure everything went smoothly for the evening, including the transition from diner to cocktail party.   I was extremely happy with our experience.I would also add that we also went there for a normal dinner upstairs when we were searching for places for the rehearsal dinner and, obviously, we were impressed with the food and chose to select it over several other restaurants that we were considering.",3,0,0,Nick B.,"New Orleans, LA",69,3,0

3.0,9/3/2018,"Came here for a birthday dinner on a Saturday evening. The restaurant, although it isn't large, was relatively empty for most of our time there. The servers are extremely polite and the food is tasty, however the main reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because it took almost an hour for our food to come out. I understand we were a large group, and therefore it is understandable for there to be some sort of delay, but we were all seated around 8, ordered wine first, ordered our food around 8:30 (8:45 latest), and we received our entrees around 9:35 (only a few of us ordered appetizers, and there was still a huge gap in between appetizers and entrees). We were starving and finished all the wine (multiple glasses) before food even got to the table. It even took a while for the complimentary bread to be served. That aside, I tried the linguine nero (squid ink seafood pasta) and the diablo carne pizza. The pasta was great, and the texture of the pasta was definitely a homemade one. The pizza was also good taste-wise, but because it was rather thin, it was overly salty. I had to rip off the crust and take bites of it in between to even out the saltiness. Perhaps it would be better if I came in a smaller group. I also think it's quite pricy considering other great Italian joints just a few stops away, but I'd like to check out the happy hour (4-7pm weekdays, 5-7pm weekends - at the bar only though). They have some food specials as well.",0,0,0,Jen P.,"New York, NY",131,183,157

The culinary team did an amazing job. The event started the day at a count of 35 guests and grew to over 50 within hours of the event starting.

2.0,8/25/2018,"Attended a group function at the Gran Morsi. The wait staff was pleasant and attentive. Why am I mentioning the wait staff at the beginning of this review? Because it was the best and possibly the only good thing mentionable. I'm giving this establishment two stars rather than one because it was a group function and I didn't dine here as an independent diner. Maybe it was poor food selection for a group but that's just an excuse. The starter, yes not plural was a blah bruschetta. It was followed by a nice arugula salad. Next came the pasta which was mushy. Rather than give a blow by blow of the remaining courses, let's just say it went downhill from there.",0,1,0,Rick M.,"Chesterfield, Saint Louis, MO",15,126,0

3.0,8/6/2018,"I've had a gift certificate for this place for a year or two now so I've been meaning to try the restaurant out. It was very easy to get a last minute reservation same day and the dining room is extremely spacious and airy and had dim lighting. It can get a bit loud with families though. Service was very slow and there seemed to be a confusion with who was our server, but overall, there were basically only two servers running around plus the busboys. It got so busy that the manager in charge (I think) had to help bring out the dishes. We had to remind our server multiple times that we asked for lemons and he just completely forgot. We felt bad because they were just being pulled in fifty different directions. Drinks were okay - my gin and tonic had a good amount of alcohol. As for the food, as another reviewer mentioned...bread isn't included, which is disappointing because the only other option is to pay $10 for it. The focaccia (has provolone stuffing) was very good, but is it worth $10? Not sure. My linguine nero was lacking. The seafood that accompanied it was fine, but the rest of it was just disappointing. The tagliatelle bolognese was the winner and I wish I had gotten that as my dish instead. Totally skip the tiramisu as it was not worth getting in the slightest bit. Tasted below average and we didn't even end up finishing it. The coffee dessert cocktail was refreshing, but again, nothing to swoon over. Overall a decent restaurant in Tribeca for a cozy atmosphere, but for $200 after the gift certificate was applied, I was certainly expecting something a little bit more.",0,0,0,Samantha W.,"New York, NY",270,259,145
5.0,8/5/2018,"TO DIE FOR. I came here with a friend during NYC Restaurant Week so my review is solely based on that 3-course prix fix menu as I have never eaten off of their regular dinner menu. But if their Restaurant Week menu was telling of how the rest of their food is, it was incredible. I generally love any and all pasta - because well, it's pasta. It can be hard to really WOW me with a pasta dish but their fusilli was out of this world. So flavorful and everything was cooked to perfection. The entire meal was incredible - not one course outshined another. I got a sparkling rose to drink and I could have had the entire bottle it was so good. Our server was great at her job - seemed genuinely interested in how we liked the food and our overall experience. The only downfall of the entire experience was the food took quite a long time to come out in my opinion so I do not recommend coming here if you are in any sort of rush. I appreciate a small break in between each course but it was a decently sizable break. Regardless, the food itself and the server more than made up for that small drawback. The atmosphere and vibe is also to die for - elegant but not at all stuffy. If I was trying to impress a date, in-laws, etc., I would easily take them here and would be confident that we would have a great experience.

5.0,7/27/2018,"Wow. I absolutely love Gran Morsi. It's hard to find a super solid mid-range restaurant in NYC, but DAMN. The service, the food, the space - utter perfection. I came here with my fiancée and we shared a few things. We had the octopus, garganelli, diablo pizza, and chocolate flan. What an absolutely delicious meal! The octopus was PERFECTLY seasoned and cooked. It was very tender and quite spicy; probably the best octopus I've ever had. Next, the pasta was absolutely scrumptious. The Parmesan cream wasn't too heavy and the truffles made it everything. The Diablo pizza was really something. This is a pretty meat-heavy pizza and it is bursting with flavors. The sausage has so much going on with itself seasoning wise. We were stuffed but saved room for dessert because I had seen pics of the Piedmontese Chocolate Flan. It did not disappoint and was a lovely finishing touch.The decor and ambiance make it a cozy yet spacious environment. It's perfect for a date or group lunch/dinner.

3.0,7/1/2018,"Just returned from dinner at this place and one question is still botherring me. HOW, just HOOW this restaurant ""deserved"" almost 5** rating??!!Awfully tasting food (had octopus, burrata, mushrom pizza and watermelon/tomato salad). All of the dishes were worse tasting then chain restaurants cook (and to be honest even I could do much better job with all of them). The ""bread service"" was an embarrassment to the word ""bread"" (particularelly for Italian restaurant). And we didn't even want to spend another $15 for dessert thinking it would be even more money wasted).The service was""trying to be"" nice but VERY unprofessional.The ambiance is cute but not very cozy or comfotable, with annoying loud music on the background. And the value is HIGHLY OVERPRISED. No wonder the room was almost empty when we arrived at 7:30pm on Sunday and not much fulfilled (3 more tables occupied) when we left. So, we obviously not coming back, but the question still remains:Where all these misleading raving reviews come from?????P.S. Today is Friday July 6th, and I received a surprizing phone call from the manager (I believe) of the restaurant who was very much interested in finding out what went wrong with our experience and how they can improve their operation to better satisfaction of patrons. I have to say that I was very impressed with sincerity and a positive vibe of our conversation that showed me that on the management level they do care about these things. I also was very touched by the followed Gift Certificate from the restaurant that was sent to my email. I do appreciate this generouse gesture very much. And though not living in NY I can't be sure if I'll have an opportunity to use it, but if this opportunity appears I will be glad to try this place again. Who knows, our dinner could be a one bad slip of the night  and we are willing at least in our minds kind of think of it this way. That's why I will improve my rating to 3** for now with the hope of totally changing it to higher one after hopefully wonderful experience if that opportunity presents itself.",0,0,0,Tatyana M.,"Baltimore, MD",6,547,0

I has the eggplant parm and was worried because most eggplant parms I get are too mushy for me and not that enjoyable. This was the ABSOLUTE BEST eggplant parm I have EVER had. It was not mushy. It was firm, and for a second I thought I accidently ordered the chicken parm because it tasted so good and was firm. The restaurant is on the expensive side but I would definitely pay again to have that eggplant parm. And the pasta on the side was great as well. The person I was with had the salmon and they enjoyed that as well. The only thing I wished was that they served bread in the beginning.

The chicken schnitzel was served with spaghetti in a tomato sauce. It was a huge meal! We both had a glass of wine and the bill came to $90 before tip which I thought was fairly good value.

Our waiter was a very enthusiastic and sweet young man. We ordered a round of drinks and several pasta entrees.The food came out fairly quickly. We ordered the eggplant parmigiana, which car with a side of spaghetti. I ordered the garganelli without prosciutto, which was served with a white sauce and very savory and soothing. We also ordered tagliatelle. One thing that was a little irritating is that we had barely been served our food and just taken our first bite of our pasta when the waiter already came around to ask how everything was, because we had actually been able to try everything. I wish they would wait a while before checking in with us because we actually need to taste everything before we decide how everything is.Everyone raved about everything.Our drinks took a much longer than the food, coming after our plates were taken away, so that I ended up leaving mine largely untouched because we had to leave soon thereafter.There was also a mix up with the bill, which took a while to sort out, prolonging the affair.",2,0,0,Mythili M.,"Manhattan, NY",50,198,1179

4.0,1/6/2018,"Happy New Year Everyone! What better way to start my reviews in 2018 then to write about Gran Morsi since one of the times we were there was for New Year's Eve! Let me start from the beginning....Several weeks ago, we were trying to decide where we wanted to go for dinner. If you know me you know somethings about me already...two definite things are that I love Italian Food and that   I tend to take forever to go to places that I have bookmarked on Yelp!-lol. So, of course I have had Gran Morsi bookmarked for quite sometime. The Italian Food looks great in people's Yelp pictures, so we headed to the place which is in lower Manhattan.Gran Morsi (according to the website) is Italian for the word ""bites"" since they specialize in Italian  and in serving small plates/servings as well as shared dishes. We shared their spectacular Polpette Meatballs- Black Angus Beef, Berkshire Pork w/ San Marzano Tomatoes and each had their pasta entree Garganelli- Winter Truffles, Prosciutto Di Parma, Butternaut Squash , Chives and Parmesan Cheese. We both requested that Sausage be added to our Garganelli dish and it was fantastic! The bartender made me a sweet flavored mocktail and it was great.Fast forward to New Year's Eve....we enjoyed going to Gran Morsi so much the first time that we went that Sunday evening. Gran Morsi has beautiful lighting and quaint/cozy table + seating arrangements. It was decorated for the holiday and when we arrived we were seated quickly. Gran Morsi had 2 options which consisted of the Pre-Fixe Menu ($75 per person) and you sit in the inner dining area or the A La Carte option and you can sit near the bar area or at tables near the front entrance/bar area. We did the A La Carte option and ordered the same meal we had the last time which was delicious. If you are searching for a elegant, yet simple and intimate place to have a nice dining experience whether you are with family, friends or on a romantic date etc. then Gran Morsi is a good choice.",19,11,18,Alexis M.,"Brooklyn, NY",31,304,11066
4.0,1/5/2018,"My sister made lunch reservations in advance at Gran Morsi after her City Hall wedding for our group of 12.  For starters, we ordered a few plates each of the Polpette ""meatballs"", bruschetta, and octopus. If I had to pick my favorite appetizers out of the three, I'd vote for the octopus. It was tender and lightly seasoned, really letting the natural flavors of the octopus come through.I had the oxtail gnocchi for my main and boy, do I wish I've had this combo sooner. That being said, the gnocchi was decent, though a little tough, like a semi-firm pillow. A pillow, nevertheless. I snuck a few bites of my sister's Tagliatelle alla Bolognese - The sauce was wonderfully rich and flavorful, pasta was cooked al dente - What more can I ask for?Other people in the group had the Branzino, Chicken Alla Matone, Chicken Parm, and some other dishes I can't remember but it seemed like everyone enjoyed their meal.By the end of our mains, we were quite full so a few of us shared the tiramisu and the apple crostata. Personally, the real winner of the meal was the tiramisu - Every bite was like floating down a chocolate rum river. Unfortunately, the downer was the apple crostata. The apples were crunchier than I expected and the cinnamon gelato was like doing the cinnamon challenge in ice cream form.Despite the cinnamon overload at the end of our meal, Gran Morsi is a solid place for an intimate event or a quiet date night.Oh, aside from the really neat green walls, the other detail that I loved about the restaurant was the wine ""cellar"" by the entrance.

The brussel sprouts were tasty and light, and the arugula salad was flavorful and a good amount of tang with the sweetness of grapes. I am a Celiac, so I asked for the pasta carbonara with their GF pasta. I was really impressed with their ability to cook the GF pasta, as it is more often than not sticky and chewy - however, they made it soft and tasty. I really enjoyed their take on the carbonara.

WTF!  We split the poplette which is their signature meatball dish and we each had an entree, My Husband had a pasta dish and I had the eggplant parm both were delicious.  After two drinks each and our dinner the check was $130.00 for the two of us, the bar bill was way more then the food bill.  Now I understand that drinks always add to the bill, but we have gone to fancy steak restaurants where the drinks are double the size and less expensive.  The feeling of being ripped off outweighed the goodness of the meal.  Not running back so quick but will probably order a pizza for delivery.  Sat night date night, I can think of way better in NYC",0,1,0,Moe M.,"Manhattan, NY",5,72,3

I recommend the Montepulciano if you like red. We started with the fritto misto (perfectly fried with a delicious arrabiata sauce) and their amazing focaccia (highly recommend!!). For an entree, the eggplant parm came out in a sizzling pan. The eggplant itself was so tasty and tender. The cheese mixture was perfect and there were plenty of crispy bites stuck to the pan which is a personal favorite of mine. The chicken parm was a nice portion of whole chicken breast and the added provolone cheese gave a unique flavor.  Both entrees came with a side of pasta, which was cooked perfectly al dente.  Did not have room for dessert, but the options looked very enticing, including traditional Italian ricotta cheesecake.

The overall appearance of the restaurant is quite inviting with a modern contemporary charm. The hostess was very pleasant and brought us to our table; we chose the small round table in the corner for more intimate conversations.The menu was simple with a nice selection of appetizers, pastas, and a few entrees with a good selection of cocktails, beer and wine on the back. For cocktails I chose the fig infused vodka one and another with a froth. Both were unique and good. For appetizers, we selected the grilled octopus, focaccia, fried mixto and meatballs. Portion size was adequate and I almost felt full before my main course. The octopus was über tender and tasty. The meatballs were tender - a combo of tender beef and Berkshire pork, not too much breadcrumbs and served with a tasty tomato sauce. Two of us ordered the entrees: fusilli and osso buco. The pasta was cooked perfectly. The osso buco was tender and doesn't need a knife. They even provide a small form for the luscious marrow. The only fail for this was the polenta cake below, which was a bit firm and dry, and the greens wasn't cleaned well - gritty from sand. We finished with a tiramisu to share. Not traditional with lady finger, but still delicious with biscotti crumbs and cocoa nibs.Service was good especially our waitress was patient and pleasant except for one of the bussers who spilled water while refilling glasses and didn't come back to wipe it away.

5.0,10/10/2017,"My wife and I spent nearly two months searching for a perfect place to have a small intimate wedding when we stumbled upon this beautiful restaurant. We ate there a few times to see how the food was and each time we went back it was better than the last. When eating at the actual restaurant the staff is always welcoming, the service is impeccable and most importantly the food is on point. There are literally 10,000 Italian restaurants in NYC but I can honestly say Gran Morsi is one of the few that serves perfect Al dente pasta every time. From their regular menu I would highly recommend the eggplant parmigiana and the spaghetti pomodoro, while both simple dishes they are executed perfectly.     Now back to the actual wedding, the venue point person Sam was wonderful and really help put this day together, she coordinated all of our vendors, made sure everything was setup correctly and was in contact whenever needed. We held our ceremony in the actual restaurant which was entirely cleared and decorated with flowers. The after party was held downstairs in a beautiful room with a private bar, dance floor and just as much charm as the upstairs. This was the perfect venue for a 50-60 person wedding or event (it might be a little too small if you have many more than that).     I really feel the staff and the kitchen outdid themselves for the wedding as we felt the food (which we decided to have served family style) was on par with what was served upstairs in the restaurant. It is one of the few times I've had family style food come out the same as a single person dish (pasta still cooked to perfection).

Our daughter lives around the corner and found the venue for me, but once it was chosen it was up to me to deal with this awesome staff and venue.  The exposed brick and living wall was the perfect backdrop for our embellishments.  We held our event on a Sunday for brunch and just came away with nothing but praise for all involved.  Although out payment included the tip,  the experience was just so seamless that we added a ""Thank God for your personal service tip""  Rush here for your next event.",0,0,0,Debra C.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

Listen fellas if you want to take your lady out to eat with a little romantic cool vibe this is a good spot to add to your list lol The dim setting they have also fits this place. Our waiter was the definition of efficient he dotted all the i's and crossed all the t's. He also respected our space as we talked business. I ordered the ""Free Range Chicken with Lemon potatoes, and California spinach"" and this dish was perfect WOW. I mean the chicken was Sooooooooo tender while being seasoned to perfection. Overall This place is extremely sexy from the customer service to the ambiance, to the quality of food. One observation was literally all waiters or bartenders etc.. telling you to have a good evening when you were leaving the establishment. I don't know if it the employees were trained to do that or whatever but it is a great touch to make you feel like a valued customer and feeling like I need to come back here spend more of my money lol. Definitely make reservations folks because even during the weekday it was packed in here. No five stars for a couple of reasons. For cost of entrees the portions could be slightly more just my opinion. Also no complimentary bread while you wait for your entree or appetizer is a no no lol That is pretty much standard not only for Italian restaurants but all restaurants these days. So yeah the cost to quantity ratio is lacking a little bit but the taste however is on point.

The meatballs are supposedly bigger but that's definitely not the case. See pic on how tiny the meatballs are, about 2/3 diameter of a take out fork.

It was garnished nicely so not a total miss. the dish was also removed from the table before we finished, just a service note.

5.0,5/2/2017,"Before I start my review - I would like to thank the gran morsi staff for allowing us to host our baby shower on April 30th, at this amazing restaurant. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH for the spectacular service you all provided from the beginning planning process to the day of the event. Everything was seamless and perfectly executed. Staff was immediately on hand, ready to help with anything I needed! Even out of their duties. I cannot thank you enough for such a humbling experience. I also want to especially thank manager, Samantha. She made this entire planning so easy, non stressful and so accommodating. I cannot stress how helpful she was from the get go, which made my decision to choose gran morsi, a walk in the park. After coming to the restaurant to check out the venue, meeting her in person, and seeing that their priority was all about the clients accommodation, I knew right away I wanted to host our baby shower there. Even my husband was pleased with her attention and flexibility, that even he knew, that this is the spot. Now onto the day of the event, we were allowed to come 2 hours early to set up. While setting up, staff constantly asked if they could help with anything at all! Even filling up baby bottles with apple cider for our baby games! I felt so incredibly humbled that there is such kindness and service. The staff seriously blew my mind away. In addition, I brought in 2 cakes to serve for the party. Initially, I had planned to cut both cakes. The staff had brought to my attention that they cut one cake and it seemed there was no need to cut the second cake as everyone already had enough to eat, and not to waste cutting the second cake. They said they would keep an eye out to see if the second cake should be cut and in the end, we didn't cut it. Everyone was so stuffed and happy. I think if we were at any restaurant, they would've cut the cake without any attention or regard. But not here. They didn't want us to waste a cake if they cut it. My husband and I took the one cake home and so happy we did as we shared the rest the next day with our family.Onto gran morsi's menu - we opted to do buffet style. We wanted our guests to casually eat whenever and not wait on others to sit down altogether to eat. After all, we had a party of 50 adults. Coordinating a 50 sit down is not easy. Anyway, the food was also so amazing!!! Everyone raved about it the next day! Our menu consisted of rigatoni in meat sauce, chicken parm, and orecchiette. We did passed appetizers, meatball sliders and margarita pizza. And a side of arugula salad. So it's been 2 days since our event, and our guests are still raving about the restaurant, the service, the staff, the ambience, the vibe, the decor, how much fun they had, how everything came perfectly together, EVERYTHING!!!! I am beyond amazed with gran morsi. They completely exceeded my expectations and I will forever remember this moment as everyone who came is very important to me and I truly wanted them to have a good time. And they got just that. It wouldn't have been successful if it wasn't for Sam and the staff! I highly recommend gran morsi for any private event as I know you will be in good hands.Also, I've dined here on a regular night as well and tried a variety of items on their menu, including the mushroom truffle pizza, squid appetizer and numerous pasta dishes. Everything was great. If you're looking to just dine out or hold an event there, you will not be disappointed. I promise.",2,0,1,Linda T.,"Manhattan, NY",26,210,157

Seated at a cozy corner table the four of us were ready for a fine dining experience.Upon reading about Gran Morsi ""Polpette Meatballs"" (which beat Bobby Fay's) we ordered two offerings for the table. The meatballs were soft and moist as they should be but we were expecting something tastefully unique here. Granted our expectations were high but shouldn't they be under the circumstances. We actually found the Fritto Misto ""Mixed Fry"" with calamari, shrimp and cherry peppers to be the better starter choice. Perfectly prepared with a spicy sauce this item was thoroughly enjoyed. Also ordered - the fresh Greenmarket Salad which did not disappoint.Two orders of the Spaghetti Pomodoro with tomatoes, garlic and olive oil as well as the Mezze Rigatoni were good but not outstanding. Gran Morsi isn't cheap and a high level of fine dining is expected here. The Scottish Salmon while fresh fell a bit short on flavor. The accompanying beet risotto torte was a true disappointment. Muddied and mush it was left on the side.After initially being rushed our service improved throughout our stay. Suggested wine selections - however pricey - worked.

We were seated in the booth all the way in the back on the right.Drinks: We arrived right when HH was ending but were able to sneak in two drinks each. The drinks really are treated like an art here and for $8, worth every sip. Must mention, not every drink on their menu is HH priced, be sure to ask. The margarita was and it was amazing. Bartender was very sweet!Food: As I mentioned, I did the Restaurant Week menu. For an appetizer, I had the buffalo mozzarella - it was okay. For my entree, I went with the lobster parm. That was amazing. I wish I didn't go out after or else I would have brought my leftovers home. For the price - for RW, get the lobster parm! It's $40 on the regular menu but you get the entree, an appetizer, and dessert for $50. For dessert, I got the raspberry sorbet, nothing to write home about.Giving three stars because of the service. My whole group arrived when the restaurant was empty, made reservations well in advance, and we were seated promptly. Arrived at 6:45. However, we did not check out until 10:30. There were massive delays in bringing out our entrees, when folks who arrived after us were served before us.. And it took them 35 minutes to bring us the check. We had to remind our waiter and his response was, ""sorry! you all are just so beautiful in the corner."" Right.All in all..Location is prime, close to the subway. Decor is beautiful (my friends and I had said that this would be a great place for a baby shower or a bridesmaids lunch). Food was good and the Restaurant Week Menu gives you a solid bang for your buck. But the service was not timely. I would love to give this place a second chance.. Lunch looks nice here.. Idk we'll see.",1,0,2,Aysha S.,"New York, NY",475,69,16
5.0,2/6/2017,"Came here last night for dinner during restaurant week!First , it was super bowl Sunday and we were the only people in the restaurant the entire time we were dining, and it was amazing. We had the best seat in the house and it was so romantic in there. I wish I could dine like that every time honestly. What a treat.The food was divine. From the apps to the dessert every dish had lots of flavor and was absolutely delicious.We chose :: Meatballs (holysh*t! These are amazing!!! I could eat these as a whole meal 3 times a day for a week)Bufala mozzarella- OMG. The pesto & tomato sauce mix was so good I made  a huge sloppy mess of deliciousness)BF had lobster parm - he cleaned is plate and said he had high expectations & they delivered.Pappaedelle bolognese - pasta was cooked perfectly & the meat sauce had a sweetness which worked perfectly to balance Panna cotta - I honestly have never had panna cotta and I feel like I've been missing out!!!! Salted caramel gelato - there was a grainy texture which I couldn't figure out but it was fun! Tasted alright - I wasn't a huge huge fan of it but it was good.Service was impeccable!

3.0,1/29/2017,"Went for restaurant week, got to taste the meatballs for appetizer (amazing and hearty for a starter, my favorite of the entire meal) along with shrimp and chorizo (also great flavor and no too heavy or overwhelming since chorizo can be big on grease) definitely give a 5 of 5 on apps. Lunch was orecchiette and sausage which was my favorite. Again, not too heavy with great flavor and subtly spicy. Also tried the lobster parm. Was very good for exactly what it was, but I was mentally imagining something different. Wishful thinking I would have wanted more lobster and less breading and wish it wouldn't have felt so heavy on the fried aspect of the dish. Still good, but not worth the $14 up-charge for  restaurant week. Overall, it is still a good stop for something different from the expected Italian place in the area. Drinks are mediocre and overpriced. Wouldn't be a place to come for cocktails. Garden grove tasted heavy and too much honey and I don't believe there was even honey in the drink? Not sure what would have made it so heavy. Also the cedar smokes old fashioned, for a whiskey aficionado the cedar smokeyness was too heavy and become more and more overpowering with each drink (my date had 3). I wish I would have done a glass of wine instead personally. Ambiance was cool, music was great. For the area and the prices I give a 3.5 out 5 based on restaurant week lunch experience.",0,0,0,Samantha C.,"Jersey City, NJ",109,125,74
4.0,1/26/2017,"The first time I came here we showed up at 2:59. I called to check if they would be open since the yelp hours and the restaurants website were contradictory. No one answered and when entering the restaurant they said they were closed. Please update yelp hours. When we returned the second time, we had a pleasurable experience. The entire staff was extremely welcoming and checked on us many times throughout the meal to see how we were enjoying everything. The meatball appetizer was delicious, moist, and flavorful. Somewhat small portion, $12 for 2 meatballs but they are worth it. The bucatini amatriciana was very good, the chilis in the dish added a nice spice to the dish. The carbonara with the black pepper had a nice kick to the dish although I think the dish would benefit from some more sauce. I also really liked the cocktail list, try the Bella Pera, frothy with a bit of pear and not overly sweet. The server who took our drink order was not familiar with the cocktail ingredients and had to call someone else over to answer my questions but perhaps she was training.

5.0,1/15/2017,"The food is really carefully made and beautifully presented here.  I love the eggplant parm in particular.  It is possibly the best eggplant parm anywhere.  It is baked with goat cheese and layered.  The dishes here aren't just quick put together Italian dishes but ones in which a lot of care has gone into creating and with many nuanced ingredients.  The presentation of the dishes is also beautiful.  It is reflected in the price for Italian for the area, but the rest don't do as good a job and if you are going to indulge in something as carb and cheese heavy as Italian, it might as well be really good.  Make it count.",3,1,1,Christine N.,"Manhattan, NY",138,374,294

If money is no object to you, by all means, dine here. Pasta is cheap as hell. I'm not sure why they don't give more per order. My colleague spent over $40 for lunch as he also got a coke $4 and tiramisu $10. $10 would be what I would normally spend for my entire lunch. They do offer lunch options. Mainly paninis for $15.

Because they offer a buffet, no one was left hungry or moaning because they were served last.

The atmosphere is great. Awesome vibe, great decor, and the staff is phenomenal. The waiters and waitresses, host, and manager Emeka are a serious dream team. They go above and beyond to make your experience perfect. They never miss a beat and are so friendly, warm and welcoming. Ok, and now the food. It's beyond. In a city filled with amazing Italian spots this provides memorable cuisine worth traveling to TriBeCa for and dishes that will leave you salivating for days and dreaming about coming back. My top recos and must orders are the meatballs (they are award winning and the chef beat Bobby Flay on his show Throw Down), eggplant parm (baked in a skillet and as close to culinary perfection as I've ever tasted...also comes with a side of spaghetti, which is magic), parpadelle bolognese, mushroom pizza, lemon chicken. And the truth is you really can't go wrong. But let me repeat again ... the meatballs and eggplant parm ... if you do anything make sure you get down and dirty with those. They will not disappoint.

We were fortunate that they weren't packed during weekday lunch time. The restaurant itself is very chic, with a modern garden flair. The dining area is pretty cozy (but not cramped!) so I'd say it's best for smaller groups of ~4 people or fewer. I got the swordfish, which is a very dense and meaty fish. The seasoning was flavorful yet balanced, and the dish was delicious.The steak tartare that I had here was probably the best that I've had -- it's very finely sliced rather than ground, slathered in some sort of aioli and served with crisp bread slices. Texture, taste, and freshness, all winners. I'm usually not a big bread person, but the foccacia was excellent. It was light and crispy with a delicious crispy Parmesan cheese layer. It was tasty without being dense, and delightfully addictive.Gran Morsi should be much more crowded than it is.

1.0,6/13/2016,"Pretentious olive garden, for the most bougie of the Tribeca-sphere. While the service was good, and a low lighting, quality atmosphere was provided, I found myself disappointed with the meal.  -Hanger steak- was soaked in marinade that over powered rather than complimented.  The arugula salad had an interesting touch, as it contained a single strawberry slice, but coupled with the potato wedges this plate left a lot to be desired.   -Chicken parmigiana- in two words, nothing special. This is most likely the reason for it being one of the few choices on the menu with an actual adult sized portion.  It and the spaghetti it comes with have no flare, or extraordinary flavor. -The lemon goat cheese cake-  Was a small disc, with a lesser circumference than a cupcake.  Any taste resemblance to cheese cake was masked by lemon.  There are so many places in New York that sell cheese cake for half the price and twice the size,  not to mention places that keep the rich taste of cheese cake intact while adding new explorative flavors to the mix.   As seen in the fashion world, clothes of the same material and design can market at different prices based solely off of social perception.  So while I do expect to pay higher prices in this part of the city, I wont act like this restaurant brings a new element to Italian cuisine.",6,1,0,Jacob P.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,45,7
5.0,6/12/2016,"I ate here for the first time early yesterday evening with my children. These two dining companions are both varied and vocal in their preferences. Knowing that we can usually meet in the middle over some red sauce, I chose what I anticipated would be an adequate, if unadventurous meal. Our experience FAR exceeded this expectation and I am absolutely compelled to comment.The first indication that we had found a new favorite was the warm greeting that we received. NOW: I know that it is a practiced skill in hospitality to avoid judgement, but I feel that I need to set the the scene here. We were three surly travelers  (a tired mom, a hungry growing tween and a five year old with the attention span of a goldfish) - groggy from a long road trip and certainly not dressed for public consumption. Inarguably, we were NOT the target clientele for any establishment that doesn't price plastic toys into their food cost. However, the professional, smiling host did not skip a beat as she led us to a fantastically comfortable banquette in a cozy corner of the (surprisingly spacious) dining room.We settled in and were quickly greeted, hydrated and attended to by no fewer than three members of the very attentive staff. As my road-weary eyes began to uncross over the promisingly accessible menu, our beverages arrived. For me, a refreshing sparkling rose' (I highly recommend this as an aperitif, but it also paired beautifully with the watermelon, tomato and feta salad ... more on that later...) and for my children, adorable fruit mock-tails with raspberry and mint garnish! (My sincere appreciation to the bartender on that one. I think you ended up making five of these before all was said and done.) Per our sever's recommendation, we started with the zucchini crisps and focaccia to share. This was an excellent suggestion as they arrived incredibly quickly. My daughter shared about four pieces of the zucchini with me - and none with her brother. She ignored the sauce (stating that is was unnecessary) however, I really liked it - very light - with fresh tomato acidity. The focaccia was also very good (thin, pizza slice sized points with flavorful grated cheese, delicious olive oil and red sauce). Note: the portion is very generous. Our salads and meatballs were next and I can only report second-hand that the award-winning meatballs are ""AWESOME"". My son ate most of that dish and my daughter requested that the one remaining meatball be sliced and served in a sandwich for her lunch today. I immediately laid claim to the watermelon and tomato salad with feta and chiffonade - style mint leaves. Luckily my five year old's palate was too sensitive for the feta and my son prefers 'fresh' things to exit his mouth (exclusively). It was outstanding and as I mentioned, went wonderfully with the last few sips of sparkling Rose'.I have to pause here (as I did during our meal) to note that there is a VERY respectable, VERY reasonably priced Barolo on the glass pour list. Nebbiolo is one of my favorite grape varietals - but since I am generally limited to the glass list, (rarely graced by Barolo) I could not resist indulging. To my delight, it was excellent!My daughter and I both loved the Kale Salad. The creative ingredients caught my eye, though I sometimes find that chefs can over-smoke fish (for my taste) to the detriment of other flavors - not so in this case! The components of this salad had wonderful texture and the smoke on the trout gave it just enough woodiness to integrate with the kale and pomegranate without being overwhelmed. I think that my glass of Barolo went perfectly with this salad, but as someone who would enthusiastically enjoy the same wine with breakfast cereal if offered, I should probably note my bias. By the time our main course of Carne Pizza was presented, it basically was left to my son as I was in smoked-trout-Barolo heaven and my daughter was in a juice-fuled dance party (thank God and the hostess we were in a corner!). He seemed very happy to have it to himself and it looked crisp and creative (with several styles of salumi). The remainder is marked to encore as dinner tomorrow.As our meal came to a close, the question of dessert was introduced. We were all full and happy, but as good Americans, that can never be the end - so we settled on sharing the Vanilla Gelato. It was a perfect way to end an exceptional meal and presented a much needed opportunity for my children to indulge in their obligatory daily fight over fairness. A perfect end to a perfect meal!Thank you to the wonderful staff of Gran Morsi for being welcoming, accommodating and gracious.

I came here on a Friday night with my girlfriend, choosing this place thanks to good Yelp reviews. Our experience started off great from when you walk in and the entire staff seems to stop what they're doing simply to warmly greet you. The ambience and decor were top notch, my girlfriend especially loved the wall plants. We sat at a quiet little table. I started off with their polpette meatballs (the chef was on Beat Bobby Flay and took him down with these meatballs and now I know why!) which were delicious, I could eat those all day. My girlfriend got the watermelon and feta salad which she loved and described as sweet and refreshing. For our main courses I could not resist going for those meatballs again so I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti and the sauce were delicious and the meatballs...well they are the best meatballs I have ever had. My girlfriend decided to go with two more apps for her main course choosing the artichokes and the frito misto. The artichokes were great, the bread crumbs giving it just the right amount of crunch to it and the frito misto was on point. I find it really hard to find good quality calamari in this city but this place came through with calamari cooked perfectly. We then shared the tiramisu parfait (forgot to take a picture) which was so delicious we finished it in about 5 seconds! Our waiter was amazing (sorry we forgot his name) and so is the entire staff. Everyone was so attentive to us, even the manager came over at one point to quickly chat. Bottom line is this place gave me the experience I am always searching for when dining out. They have got themselves a brand new regular and I highly recommend Gran Morsi to everyone.",1,0,0,Frederick B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,6
5.0,5/19/2016,"To describe my experience at Gran Morsi in one word it would be.... sublime.  Honestly, that doesn't even do it justice.  GM has turned into one of my favorite spots in Manhattan.  One of the things I love about GM is that it has such a welcoming feel to it.  You walk up to the restaurant and the display outside looks as if the angel Gabriel himself came and designed it, so it is truly heavenly.  The manager, Emeka, knows more about food and wine then any other restaurant I've been to combined, and he makes a personal effort to makes sure everyone feels comfortable and truly has an EXPERIENCE.  He will help you choose your drink of choice and your food if you are a newbie like me, or he'll talk and advise to the most comprehensive pallets if you are a connoisseur.  Now.... for the food!To start, the cheesy bread that they put on the table is to die for!!  Throw a little marinara sauce on it and you might just spoil your whole dinner.  My girlfriend and I were taking another couple out to dinner and Emeka helped us decide on the polpette meatballs as our appetizer and it did not disappoint.  The meatballs were cooked perfectly, and combined with the san marzo tomatoes, started our night on the perfect tone.  For the entree, I went with the pappardelle bolognese, which was, and is, and forever will be, the most amazing bolognese to grace my tastebuds.  The meat sauce comes so rich in flavor with healthy chunks of meat, but not overwhelming, and combined with the natural, homemade pappardelle, makes for a perfect couple.  We also tried the eggplant parm, which made our guests feel like we had taken them to a michelin star restaurant (pictured above).  Needless to say our experience at Gran Morsi was amazing and we will continue dining here for years to come.",1,0,0,Luke R.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",408,2,1

I ordered the spaghetti pomodoro and he ordered the chicken parm.  The portions were reasonable but not big.  The spaghetti ($14) was cooked perfectly and the sauce was excellent (San Marzano tomatoes - fresh and rustic).  The chicken parm ($23) looked good but I did not try it.  For dessert, we split the blood orange chocolate olive oil cake which was EXCELLENT.  It's a small chocolate cake, warm and soft in the middle, topped with gelato and chocolate shavings.  On the side is an orange wedge with a crispy caramel coating and a sweet drizzle.  Much heavier than L'Artusi's, but also totally different in concept.  Recommend.  Whole bill came to just over $50 (no drinks) and was well worth it.  For the combination of food quality, service, and atmosphere, you can not do better.Other notes:-Service was attentive without being intrusive.  Everyone was nice.  On the way out, my friend said ""I don't think I've ever had so many people tell me to have a good night before.  This is the friendliest restaurant I've ever been to"".-I would consider adding a fifth star if they started you with bread or if the portions were a tad bigger.  -If you go here expecting some sort of creative culinary wonder, like squid ink infused panna cotta with a chocolate waterfall coming out the side - you're going to be disappointed.  It's straightforward, authentic Italian food.  And it's delicious.  It doesn't need extra bells and whistles and gimmicks.Conclusion: If I check on OpenTable in a few months and there are still open reservations an hour - or even a day - in advance, I'm going to wonder where your tastebuds are.  GO.",7,4,5,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",285,134,933

We walked in a few minutes after 3 and Josh, our waiter, greeted us at the door and informed us that they closed at 3 but would ask the chef if it was okay if he could seat and serve us.  To our great delight, we were seated. My daughter and I had the whole restaurant to ourselves. Josh informed us that we were lucky to miss the lunch and dinner crowd because it usually gets pretty packed. Josh proceeds to take our order. My daughter had a soda and a glass of water. I had a nice Italian red wine and a glass of water. We started with the arugula salad. It was fresh, simple, and tasty. We also ordered a meatball sandwich with fries and the spaghetti with marinara sauce.  Josh informed us that chef had beat Bobby Fley on a meatball throw down. I believe it. The meatball sandwich was amazing. The fries were hot and crunchy. The spaghetti was cooked simply with tomato, thinly sliced garlic, and just the right amount of basil.   1) Food= 5 stars/ amazing   2) Service = 5 stars/ friendly and attentive.

3.0,3/19/2016,"Maybe I caught Gran Morsi on a bad night? So many people seem to love this place! Aside from the decor, I wasn't too impressed with anything about Gran Morsi. I'd definitely give it a solid 3.5 stars and really hope that I have a better experience the next time I return.First of all, the chef BEAT BOBBY FLAY in a meatball challenge!! Of course, I had to get them. I found it so odd that they only offer the meatballs as an app. My server recommended that I order spaghetti and meatball as an entree even though it wasn't officially on the menu. I totally regret it! My own mom makes meatballs that are wayyyy better than Gran Morsi. There's no way that they serve the same recipe that beat Bobby. Or maybe the meatballs tasted slightly different because they were served on top of spaghetti? Doubt it, but I just don't get why others are raving over them.I usually stay away from ordering spaghetti because it's typically mediocre no matter where you go. Should've have trusted my own instinct instead of listening to my sever. But on a positive note, the sauce was tasty so it was fine. I just wouldn't order it again. We started with the mushroom pizza and the sheeps milk ravioli entree to share. The pizza was light and crunchy, but I wish the topping was a bit more flavorful. The ravioli was definitely the highlight of the night! If I could rewind, I would have ordered that as my entree instead. On to the service- I still don't understand why the food took sooooo long. Four of us were dining in on a Wednesday night and it wasn't even crowded. We felt like we were waiting a lifetime for the appetizers and entrees to arrive. And they don't give you bread for the table which made the wait even worse. Even though the server was sweet, he didn't check on us much at all. I'm genuinely confused why my experience at Gran Morsi was so different than other people's. And why does everyone love those meatballs so much!? I'm gonna give Gran Morsi the benefit of the doubt and just assume I caught them on a bad night.

The interior space and decoration at Gran Morsi is fresh, clean, simple, and classy. Perfect for a casual date without being too heavily overdone and or dim.

Appetizer:So we heard that their meat balls won the challenge against Bobby Flay so naturally we all picked it for our appetizer. So glad we did! The portion was huge - 3 fat meat balls with plenty of sauce and a piece of toast (the toast tasted funky however) We expected something tiny, like all the other restaurant week participants, similar to a tasting menu, but I was half stuffed from just the appetizer. Main:My colleagues ordered the lamb shank, which they loved and couldn't be happier. It looked very meaty and fresh still on the bone. I wasn't a fan of lamb so I ended up with a sandwich / flatbread kind of dish with plenty of french fries on the side. It was okay to be honest, both the fries and bread. Dessert:But O my ...

I enjoyed the food, nice sized portions and they even switched out my arugula salad for fries because I can't stand arugula, though he didn't look pleased when he did so. Regardless, I waited 15 minutes for my dessert, which was mango sorbet. The waiter came over TWICE to tell me to be rest assured, my dessert was coming! I asked for the check ahead of time because I only get an hour for my work lunch and I was already there an hour. The check came, I tipped MORE than 20% (perhaps foolishly) and still no dessert. Obviously, I didn't want to get in trouble for missing work so I left without my dessert. I don't know what could possibly take so long as to get me a scoop of mango sorbet but I will never know as I was cheated out of it. They should have charged me less even though it was a fixed restaurant week menu, but if you're going to forget about one of your first customers that day, just because she is sitting alone and you aren't going to make a lot of money off of her, you still need to treat her with RESPECT.

I would say the polpette was delicious, and certainly amongst the best meatballs I have had. I think everything about it was great - just the right amount of cheese and sauce, and great flavors to the meatballs. I would give the meatballs 4.75 stars.I made the mistake of ordering eggplant parmesan as the entree, but probably would have been better served ordering a lighter fish-type entree with this as my appetizer. Regardless - on its own - without thinking about the polpette - the eggplant parm was great. It was cheesy and delicious and rich and satisfying. However, it ultimately had similar flavors as the polpette meatballs, and thus, the distinct flavors were a bit lost. For my experience eating the eggplant parm, I would give this 4 stars. Anyone not eating the eggplant parm following the polpette would probably get an experience of 4.5 stars. I have had better eggplant parm, but this was a very good eggplant parm.The dessert was a showstopper. The panna cotta was exceptional and for sure the best panna cotta I ever had. It was creamy and delicately flavored. I might go back to this establishment just to re-order the panna cotta. The basil and strawberries were perfectly balanced in this dish and it was a harmony that was just perfect. I am still thinking about this panna cotta the next day.

And I was impressed watching chef Kenneth Johnson cook against his first opponent before throwing down against Bobby Flay. When he remarkably beat his opponent, then versed against Bobby Flay, I was very amused at how calm he was while Bobby Flay was busting a sweat! Kenneth Johnson chose the signature dish to cook against Bobby Flay to be MEATBALLS.... The man said he could make it with his eyes closed since he makes hundreds of these in a day. Anyways, he beat Bobby Flay and when I checked on Yelp I noticed these were the same exact meatballs judging by the plating style! Fast forward through time a little and I noticed his restaurant Gran Morsi was participating for restaurant week.APPETIZERS -- the polpette meatballs are truly AWESOME... the crispy cheesy crostini you get, the tomato sauce, and the meatballs itself held up so well yet kind of just melts in your mouth. The calamari salad was light but also tasty as well.ENTREES -- we all got either the New Zealand lamb shank or porchetta panini. Both which were mediocre. My date & I was quite happy to see porchetta sandwich on the RW menu since we love porchetta so much. But this one was sooo poorly done. The porchetta was sliced too thinly like ham instead of traditional nice chunk of pork shreds or cubes. There was no crispy skin from this ""porchetta"". Let alone there was barely much of the porchetta meat in the focaccia bread.. The breading was way too much, and focaccia bread is our favorite too.. But this one wasn't warm or even soft enough. I was expecting the calabrian chili aioli to be spreaded on the bread itself, but instead it was just mixed and rubbed all over the porchetta meat which masked what a beautifully ""juicy seasoned"" porchetta is suppose to be. The lamb shank was falling off the bone tender, and the dish in general was nice overall except for the extra gamy taste from the lamb itself.DESSERTS -- I wish I was able to try the other gelato flavors instead of getting the panna cotta because the pistachio gelato and mango sorbet was really fresh and yummy! The consistency of them was a little thick and creamy.. Some sorbets tends to be too icy, but not this one!The dining room is a very cute, clean and spacious.

It's hard to fit a three course meal (esp with such hefty options) in under an hour. We ended up being late for work and had to take our dessert to go.",0,0,0,Meg T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,4
5.0,1/18/2016,"There are several reasons I keep going back to Gran Morsi again and again. First of all, the food is consistently fantastic. I have never had a meal here that did not end in 100% clean plates. I almost always have the meatballs and artichokes to start. For mains, there is something for everyone. Pastas are appropriately portioned, the pizzas are thin crust with mouth watering topping combinations. And you really cannot go wrong with the meat and fish entrees here - cooked just right, with vegetable sides that you actually like. Save room for dessert - there's always something interesting on the menu to finish off your meal.Beyond the food, the service here is warm and welcoming. I think I felt like a regular on my 2nd visit. You will find friendly people, who are well-versed in their menu offerings and wine.And last but not least, the ambiance is lovely. Exposed brick wall on one side, a plant-focused back wall, and a lot of interesting old photos on another. It can get loud if there's a big group present (the main dining space is one room) but you will not be shouting across the table. It's a solid choice for a date, a small group of friends, or your visiting parents.",5,0,0,Kathleen H.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",44,377,12
3.0,1/13/2016,"We came here during the holiday season when they have free dessert with 2 lunch plates. Food was amazingly good, I ordered black pasta with seafood and tomato sauce - it was the best pasta that I had had in a while !!! Noodles were cooked to perfection, sauce and seafood complimented each other very well. The place is very nicely decorated with indoor wall of green plants, I personally think that it is very cool. My only complaint is that the place smelled horrible when we came in, dont get me wrong, it was not a nasty smell, it smell like clorox detergent. I first thought that I was paranoid/ too sensitive but eventually both my friend and I feel like something stick to back of our throat - I think that's what happens when you breathe in too much cleaning chemical.",1,0,1,April B.,"Jersey City, NJ",131,135,311

Two of the things ordered on the menu were ""sold out"" but that wasn't even the worst of it. The service was so unbelievably slow. It took us a good hour from when we ordered to receive our entrees. Half the staff was nice, but the other half we're fairly rude. One thing that was fairly small, but irritated me on this place was the bread. They charge you for the bread.

Ours were still actually wet so the hostess kindly moved the restaurant decorations and let ours rest against the wall. I think they added to the decor quite nicely.The service here was super friendly (see above regarding our paintings). We ordered the brussel sprouts, spaghetti with polpette meatballs, kale salad and the mushroom truffle pizza. The brussel sprouts and kale were good. Nothing to complain about. The spaghetti was also good. It came with a thick marinara sauce and when you order it with the meatballs you get 2, which isn't that many for $8 extra dollars I feel, but they were decently sized and were tasty. The pizza was just OK. I think it was the crust. It was a bit tough and there wasn't much sauce on it so there was nothing to really soften it. The pizza was the only dish left unfinished for the night. All in all, a pretty decent place and a nice atmosphere.",1,0,0,Siri C.,"Frisco, TX",53,225,0

The mushroom pizza was heavenly, I would recommend 2 people per pizza so order with caution if ordering for severalPeople.The food was great not the cheapest but for me what justifies a good meal aside the taste is service that comes with it and because they did try to go above and beyond I was left with a great impression of the establishment.

I was really looking forward to the homemade rigatoni with boar ragu but they were out of stock which was a disappointment. I had the Berkshire pork chop with cabbage, apples, and seasonal vegetables - sweet and savory - very tender.  I typically order homemade pasta if it is available or fish but I was not disappointed with the pork.  The service was good.

Came with my wife and another couple for dinner made with reservations for a Saturday.  We had an early dinner, around 6 and it wasn't busy,  but around 7 pm onward restaurant filled up.  So if coming in for a meal at that time, reservations is a must. Here's the savory dishes we all sampled family style: Broccoli rabe,  polpetti meatballs,  black linguine, burrata app, and Forrest mushroom pizza.  I know his calling card is the polpetti meatballs, which by the way is one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten,  but everything else was just as wonderfull! I'm salivating just writing this review! For dessert we ordered the tiramisu parfait(hazelnut praline, marscapone, rum,  cocoa nibs),  goat cheese cheesecake,  and cappuccino martini. Everything for the most part was good.  My lesson learned is that goat cheese should not be made into a dessert.  The gaminess of the milk gives it a weird taste.  It wasn't bad,  just not the flavor i want in my dessert.  I can't wait to come back to try more dishes!

We had beers and my mom had wine to drink - they let her try a few different beers and wines before settling on what she wanted. To eat, we had zucchini chips and the meatballs to start - both were really good and well priced, a good sized starter for the four of us. To eat, I had the sheepsmilk ricotta ravioli, which was really good - there were enough ravioli for me to have a few left over. My mom had the ricotta, her boyfriend had a special which was seafood and squid ink pasta, and my friend had the eggplant parmagiano. Everyone really liked what they ordered. The eggplant dish came with a side of pasta as well - my friend didn't want it so my mom's boyfriend added it to his pasta dish - which worked out perfectly since he thought his dish was a bit small at first. The decor and atmosphere of the place was cool - they played good music, and once more people arrived the place had a cool vibe. We took our time with the meal and it lasted about two hours - the service was attentive but did not rush us.Overall I was really satisfied with the meal - there were a lot of great tasting Italian options.",2,2,0,Aeron H.,"New York, NY",384,53,41
4.0,10/10/2015,"We were in the neighborhood for a comedy show and I noticed this cosy trattoria in Tribeca on an unassuming street near city hall.  It's a small plate place with a charming romantic interior, lots of industrial styling and the greenery on the walls is a nice touch.  This is a great place to have a date, in short. The only gripe I have is that the seats are a little uncomfortable (if you're a guy, you're obliged to sit in the hard chair while the girl sits on the couchy seats but these hard metal chairs provide little back support).The polpette meatballs, as others have mentioned, is a must--they're soft and almost melt in your mouth while drenched in this zesty san marzano tomato sauce.  We also got the lamb sausage gnocchi for pasta (again, delicious and the gnocchi had a perfectly gummy texture) and the spanish octopus, which I must say was a disappointment. Octopus is one of my favorite indulgences, and this was bland beyond belief and definitely not worth the 17 bucks for 3 measly tentacles.  We capped off the meal with the lemon cheesecake, which redeemed the meal with its creamy texture.  They have a varied, though somewhat expensive, wine list and I highly recommend the limoncello margarita--it's so refreshing and perfectly accompanies the meal. Lastly, the service is very attentive and friendly. They make you feel very welcome.  In sum, this is a romantic trattoria that can be easy to overlook if you're not looking for it, but is certainly a gem--I would love to even just catch drinks at the bar if I'm in the area...",2,1,1,Ron S.,"Manhattan, NY",21,55,0

4.0,9/28/2015,"I am upgrading my review to a 4-star after having the opportunity to taste a wider selection of dishes this time:- The zucchini chips, accompanied by a sweet and fresh san marzano dip, was a great way to start the meal. I never expected zucchini chips to be that flavorful. It combined beautifully with cheese and had a nice, slightly crisp texture.- The eggplant parmigiana was the winner of the night. Composed of fresh mozzarella, provolone, san marzano tomatoes, basil and spaghetti pomodoro, it was balanced, compact and not mushy like the way most places make parmigianas like this. I would highly recommend trying this even if you do not like eggplant! I promise you will like this!- I usually do not order chicken as i see it as a less exciting meat compared to lamb, beef and pork. But the free range lemon chicken, which had artichokes, calabarian chiles, rosemary, garlic confit was a pleasant surprise. I especially loved that it was juicy without being fatty, and the unique, slightly sweet taste of the chili oil brought out the dish even more.- The sheepsmilk ricotta ravioli with asparagus, fava beans, artichokes, fennel and orange butter will win over even the non-vegetarians, though i wish it had some truffle shavings over it!  Yes, i am sooooo had to please.",0,0,0,Shulin T.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",22,238,402

That was plenty for the two of us. Staff are nice too. No attitude. They have good product knowledge and understand what they're serving - I hope they get to eat there often!Regarding the pizza: it's such a personal thing.  I prefer the more american style oily/doughy/pan fried type.

In terms ofinitial service (primarily provided by a server named Z), it wassolicitous; our party was immediately seated, drinks came promptly,and the appetizers came out in short order. In terms of initial foodand drink, the offerings ranged from good to very good; starters thatstood out included the polpette and the artichokes alla Romana.Things abruptly took a turn for the worse. As a note, our table had aplay to attend to at 9:00. We were seated at 6:30 and had placed ourorder (4 Restaurant Week Prix Fixes, as well as drinks and anadditional appetizer) by 6:55. While the starters arrived promptly, wehad yet to receive our entrees by 8:35. We asked various servers thatwe could flag down about our orders from about 8:10 onwards; repliesranged from ""any minute now"" to avoiding our table. At several times,I saw tables that had been seated after us receiving their food beforeus. At this point, I flagged down our main server, explained thesituation to him, cancelled our desserts, and just had him bring usthe bill to save what time we could to make it to the show on time; ofcourse, the bill reflected no courtesy for the issues of the dinnerservice and we ended up paying the full amount.As our table wolfed down the food that finally arrived at 8:40, wewere all left unsatisfied with our entrees. Beyond the feelings ofdissatisfaction from the service, the main plates ranged from bad toinadequate.  The dish I had (the Linguine Al Frutti Di Mare) had adecent amount of seafood on it, but the pasta was just a massive lumphidden underneath the sea of tomato sauce.

The zucchini wasn't breaded so it didn't feel heavy at all. I then had the Forest Mushroom Pizza which had the exact crust I was looking for: not cracker-thin and burnt, but not huge and doughy. It was that perfect Goldilocks in-between. Thick enough to have a chew, but not overwhelming.

Eggplant parm - don't judge with this one, the waiter recommended it and it was beyond any eggplant parm I've ever had. SOOO cheesy and delicious and came with a side of pasta (tasted home made). Lemon Chicken (I forget the full name on the menu, but it's the only chicken) - it was seasoned and cooked to perfection. Not dry at all and basically fell off the bone. It came with some cooked veggies which were a great addition. If we still had room in our bellies to eat more, we would have gone for dessert, but we are saving that for a second visit there.Bathrooms: Spotless!!Overall this was a GREAT experience and very very reasonable prices. I will definitely come back here and recommend this place to friends and family.Keep up the good work!",3,1,0,Dana M.,"New York, NY",114,312,130

4.0,6/16/2015,"We were taking a wine class at New York Vintners across the street (highly recommended, by the way!) and were trying to figure out what to do for dinner. We did a quick search on Yelp, and what do you know - Gran Morsi was right across the street, and I had a $25 gift certificate to use (thanks for the gift, even though I couldn't make it out to the Elite event!). How convenient!The wine made us really hungry. To start, we had the baby arugula salad and the polpette meatballs (because how could you resist meatballs?). The salad was simple, lightly dressed, and so fresh and tasty. The meatballs were pretty damn good. Perfectly sized for appetizers, and very flavorful.We each ordered a pasta dish for our mains. I think we all just wanted the carbs to soak up all the wine! We ordered the linguini vongole, gnocchi, and pappardelle bolognese. I had the linguini vongole, and there were more than enough clams to go around. The sauce was full of flavor without being overpowering (some pasta vongole can taste too clammy, and not in a good way), and the tableside grated cheese brought it all together. Was it the best linguini vongole I've ever had? No, but it was still pretty tasty!I had a bite of the bolognese (yum) and the gnocchi (not the hugest fan of gnocchi, but these were pretty good). Overall, solid pasta dishes.The service was excellent - our server was very attentive without being overbearing. A+ on the service.I would return to try the pizza or the other non-pasta dishes. Would I come out of my way to eat at Gran Morsi? I'm not sure... but it's not because the food wasn't good, it's because Italian food in NYC is just so hard for me to compare for some reason.",0,0,0,Amanda L.,"Denver, CO",127,296,0

We got a margherita pizza as an appetizer which was great! Good crust and cheesy. They did not have the shrimp for the black linguini dish, so I asked if I could have the black linguini itself with the clam sauce, and they said no problem. Delicious! Lots of clams and yummy sauce. Boyfriend got the sanddab dish (a fish) which we'd never tried before, I tasted it and loved the way they prepared it. Pricy but portions were decent, especially the pizza.

(Note: you can have private events or even weddings here!)The space is calming and even though its' not huge, they don't cram the tables in. The service is friendly and attentive. But the big winner is the food quality: DELICIOUS! We started with the polpette meatballs, which were super hearty and filling, and the black kale salad - SO GOOD. There's fish in the salad, so it's not for everyone, but we thought it was an amazing balance of flavors. Hubby loves squid ink pasta, which we were able to sub in with his favorite sauce: bolognese.

We really like Linguine Vongole but at the same time we wanted to try their popular Black Linguini. I really wanted Bucatini pasta, which they don't have on their menu anymore. Instead of Spaghetti Pomodoro, I asked if we can get Bucatini, and instead of their standard meatballs if I can substitute that with the Polpette Meatballs. The waiter went back to the kitchen and then came back and said no problem, we will make it happen.The Black Linguini Vongole was really good, I never knew this combo would work, but it did! The clams were fresh and the sauce was perfect. The Bucatini was a little overcooked, but still satisfied my cravings. The meatballs were good. We also got a side order of Focaccia Bread, it was thin and not your traditional thick texture bread. It tasted almost like a pizza when dipped in the marinara because of the cheese that was baked in. The olive oil was yummy! The portions were decent for the value.The host came over and helped us with the lighting when I tried to take pictures, pretty funny.

Try the limongello margarita. Or select from a punchy wine list (loaded with favorites from Piemonte). Do not miss the ""bread service,"" perfect doughy wedges that would be pizza slices if annointed with sauce and mozzarella. Perfect scorch on the bottom, peppery and dusted with parmesan. Drip on some heavenly olive oil. Had to have the perfectly seared Spanish octopus again. Thank god someone ordered the Polpette meatballs. And the crab croquette. And the broccoli rabe. Entrees also rated adjectives. Linguine Vongole (clams) was sensational, as was black linguine with shrimp. Several branzinos thrilled the table.

The hostess, server and manager greeted us with warmth and friendliness at each of their respective points in the welcoming process. Stuart, our server, was right on the case offering water and drinks promptly and describing the specials and menu highlights in depth and with obvious first hand knowledge. We were also checked on multiple times by the manager, Emeka, who was clearly well experienced in the hospitality field.Now...the food. My only complaint is that there were too many intriguing items on the menu and everything that came out of the kitchen looked amazing! We finally decided on the meatballs as an app, linguini vongole, lemon chicken and special Chicago steak sandwich.

4.0,4/21/2015,"I have to start by giving props to Gran Morsi's wonderful manager, who definitely goes the extra mile to make everyone's dining experience a great one with his cordial and warm demeanor. With selections like rabbit sweet potato gnocchi and lobster parmigiana, their menu is certainly quite inventive. I decided to go for the lobster parmigiana. Served with generous chunks of lobster, it was delightful, though a bit on the spicy side, so be warned for those expecting a something on the lighter side. For starters, I strongly recommend you get an order (or two, they're that good!) of the Polpette meatballs. Everyone at the table unanimously agreed that they were the highlight of the night's meal.The portions here are generous, and my usually formidable dessert stomach was pleading with me not to order dessert, to which I relented. My only caveat was that our server was kept highly occupied by the large group across from us, which meant we had to wait a little longer than the norm in between ordering, getting our food, and receiving the check. To his credit, he was very friendly, courteous, and apologetic for this. If the restaurant had just an extra pair of hands to share the workload, I'm quite sure this would've been a 5 star review.With its delectable food options, impeccable service, and quiet atmosphere, Gran Morsi is undoubtedly a hidden gem among the multitude of Italian restaurants serving NYC.",2,1,1,Jason W.,"Seattle, WA",371,104,2282
2.0,4/4/2015,Our dinner was good but the service was frustrating. We were there on a Friday night and the place was practically empty. Yet it took 30 minutes for the first bite of food to arrive. And we had to ask for it. No one noticed as they swirled around a restaurant with only four tables of customers. This is a good example of how inattentive service can ruin a meal.

4.0,4/3/2015,"I missed out on a YE event here but Gran Morsi made it up to us by giving us $25 gift certificates. We took that to an advantage and made two trips here. I'm going to sum up both experiences in one review. Both times I came for a special occasion, Valentine's Day and a birthday celebration. First off, I'd like to say the service here is exceptional. Each time I came, the restaurant manager was always around. The servers are super friendly and they're always checking up on us and making sure everything is great. Second, I absolutely love the interior here, the raw wood, the large plant wall in the back, the low lighting, it makes the atmosphere super cozy, intimate and romantic. Third, the food is delicious!!!!The first time I was here I had the lobster parmigiana and rabbit sweet potato gnocchi.Both dishes were great but I preferred the lobster parmigiana more due to the squid ink pasta. The dish had a better sauce than the rabbit sweet potato gnocchi. There wasn't much meat in the rabbit sweet potato gnocchi. It was mostly gnocchi than it was rabbit. The lobster parmigiana came with big chunks of lobster and it was served with a breaded chicken cutlet on the side. The second time I came I had the polpette meatballs and spaghetti carbonara. The meatballs were delicious! It was served on a cast iron pan so it was hot the whole time I ate it. I really liked the sauce that was on it. The meatballs were pretty big too and succulent. The spaghetti carbonara was quite tasty as well. We had it served with squid ink linguine instead of the regular fettucine/linguine that they use. They swapped it for us at no extra cost. My favorite part was probably the bacon and the sauce. It's always the sauce that really makes a dish yay or nay and they nailed it here at Gran Morsi. I highly recommend getting squid ink pasta from here and the polpette meatballs. For my birthday dinner they surprised me with a house made digestif which tasted like a dessert wine. In addition to the drinks, they gave me a lemon cheesecake on the house. The manager even brought it out to me personally and he wished me happy birthday which was really sweet! I highly recommend checking out Gran Morsi, you will not be disappointed.

I still crave this pizza to this day! I am one to not favor olives as much but, this pizza was definitely an exception when it came to them. The chicken parmesan was according to her, very good and very pleasing!Service:The service at Gran Morsi was splendid!

Service was very very attentive, and they were great about recommendations and water refills.  Disclaimer: I missed the Yelp Elite event here, which was a bummer because I am a sucker for Italian but they kindly gave a $25 gift certificate to try it out.  So for their hospitality and beautiful space- 5 stars.  Service- 5 stars ( a little too attentive, maybe but it wasn't busy so what do you expect). But the food itself..3.5 star.  Everything came out at a great space but here's the run down:- We started with a shared appetizer of the Spanish octopus- 5 stars all the way for this. Perfectly charred, in a deliciously sweet and somewhat thick balsamic glaze. Loved the microgreens, olives and potato on the side. - I had the bucatini (p.s. super excited for pasta so rejoice if you love pasta.. and pizza too, those looked big and filling) which was a little bit overcooked (well not al dente).  The sauce was light- perfect, san marzano tomatoes, with a hint of spice (loved it) and guanciale which I didn't love because I didn't find it salty enough/cured enough and more like prosciutto (not a fan)-Bf had the branzino which to their credit was the more flavorful branzino I ever had.. it was pan fried and had tons of flavor from its cripsy skin.. came on a bed of risotto which unfortunately was too laced with butter (trust me, I love butter!)- We shared the gelato/sorbet dessert which was refreshing and I'm pretty sure they make it inhouse which was cool.  The sorbet I picked which was raspberry which we loved with the seeds and all in it, and the vanilla bean was ok- it was more like ice cream and a bit too too sweet.  Bf had a real-deal cappuccino which was also nice. - After our gift cert, the total came to around $60 total.

5.0,1/25/2015,"My Twin and I had a themed birthday celebration at Gran Morsi in their lounge area downstairs. Phenomenal experience. The General Manager Emeka was very accommodating, he worked with every request from allowing us to have a masquerade, a DJ and the decor set up to our preference. Downstairs was set up beautifully and had more than enough room to house our 60+ guests ( I was told the capacity is 120). I was pleasantly surprised because I always have issues with other locations in NYC when I throw a party and did not expect this to be an exception. My expectations were exceeded, I had no worries, everything was taken care of. I was having such a great time I forgot about the birthday cake, the staff brought out the cake with the candles lit right on time. The event was everything I dreamed of and more. Before we partied we made reservations for dinner upstairs. The food is excellent. I was worried about setting up downstairs, the staff understood, they were fast and courteous without compromising the food or service. (I had a Margarita pizza with a cocktail.) I really appreciated that. After all I had nothing to worry about, everything was in place the way we wanted. I had the opportunity to have the full dinning experience while I was scouting locations for the party in December and the food was excellent that night as well. I started with the Spanish Octopus as a Morsi and had the Black Linguini Vongole as the Grandi Morsi, it was absolutely delicious. I was able to photograph the Octopus but digged right into the Vongole before I could take a decent picture, it looked so good I could not wait to taste. BTW, The general manager Emeka is a wine connoisseur and he recommended a fine selection of wine for our dinner.

4.0,1/14/2015,"Note : we came here through a yelp event so not everything we tasted was from their standard menu. The service was fantastic. I think highly of a place that treats people well even though they aren't earning a tip from everyone they serve. The cocktail prepared by the bartender took a little bit of time, but that's what you want. I like how he used water to wash off the side of the beer glass because he had to pour off foam, then speed it dry.  The waiters explained what each dish was, carefully balancing everything and feeding a room full of hungry people, all while keeping a smile on their faces.  Like I mentioned, we didn't get everything from their standard menu, and not everything was mind blowing, but there were some hits. I'm guessing they can use it as part of a party/catering package. What I enjoyed :The forest mushroom pizza with truffle oil. You get a nice waft of  truffle, the meaty earthiness of the mushrooms on a nice thin crust. It's not cracker thin but not too doughy; it's about the same thickness of a flatbread.The Diablo pizza was also great because of the salty meat and the bit of heat it carries. The olives were a bit odd to me but not bad.  I found the other pizzas to be ok. But these two were the best.The angus beef slider with cheese was juicy and perfect medium rare (even during an event!). Braised shredded shortrib in a hollowed potato was excellent. The shortrib was tender and a blast of flavor. the potato was a nice and cute vehicle for the meat . Arancini with parmesan was crispy and hot. Fyi i'm picky about rice balls having grown up in an Italian neighborhood with  an Italian mom for a baby sitter. This rice ball had the beautiful texture of extra crispy rice bits that went with the creamy risotto inside. It wasn't overly cheesy, more like a hint of it. thought this was amazing.Crispy shrimp: evenly crispy and perfectly cooked shrimp.  So many places fail and executing shrimp well, but this place doesn't.

4.0,1/11/2015,"I'd really like to give this a 3.5 stars but I guess I'll have to round up.  The dining room is nice and the tables are spacious, which is a change for the neighborhood where tables are generally packed tightly.  Service is OK, the server seemed a little nervous, but was nice enough.  We started with drinks, I was disappointed in how light a pour a $14 glass of wine gives you.  Beers are also a light pour.  The food was good.  We started with the mushroom pizza, with was good but also very light to non-existent on the truffle oil.  We then shared the spinach tagliatelle, which was very good.  I'm not a huge pasta person, but for some reason I always enjoy a tagliatelle, usually it's fresh, I don't think this was but it was still quite good  and I'd recommend trying it.",1,0,0,Jesse R.,"Cincinnati, OH",48,74,0
5.0,1/10/2015,i work across the street. stopped in tonight for a quick drink before i went out.  the place recently underwent a renovation - live plants in the dining room are a definite plus. decent whiskey selection and a lot of good wines by the glass. the bar staff was courteous and friendly. looking forward to trying the food!,1,0,0,Ryan S.,"Brooklyn, NY",34,15,15
5.0,12/31/2014,"First time at the restaurant and was impressed from the minute we walked in. amazing dinner location, with excellent service! The food was impeccable, and the host ( I think his name was Meka? ) was extremely charming, very friendly and well  knowledgable about all aspects of the menu. We were also able to meet the owner too, great guy and charming personality as well!The three course dinner is plenty of food and there were a few small bites send out from the chef as well so bring an appetite. Everything was well prepared and to our liking.  Its a dining experience meant to enjoy.  Prepare to spend the evening and do not rush this dinner.For appetizers, I highly recommend the Polpette Meatballs and Artichokes with CheeseFor entres we had the traditional Linguine Bolognese, Lobster Parmagiana, Duck Parmagiana,  and Chestnut Gnocchi with Rabbit. In closing, I definitely recommend stopping by here with friends or for a romantic evening with a date.

5.0,12/30/2014,"This place is the REAL deal. Amazing dinner location, with excellent service. The food was SO outstanding, I came back twice in two weeks! You will also not get better service than at Gran Morsi. Their staff is absolutely wonderful, they attend to you hand + foot and always make sure you are comfortable. Not to mention, they are all extremely knowledgeable when it comes to the food! Do yourself a favor and order the bread to start... it is divine. It only gets better from there! The roasted russel sprouts are to DIE for + their pumpkin kale pasta is my absolute favorite. Gran Morsi is one I will be recommending for years, this place is truly a gem!",1,0,0,Kait W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0
5.0,12/29/2014,"Absolutely love the food! Preferably the bolognese is impeccable. They have just the right proportions and it is definitely worth every single cent. In addition, their appetizers were delicious to start off the whole dinner. They have great bread that is always warm and especially fresh! My favorite dessert is the mango gelato. It has got to be the best gelato I have ever tasted since moving to NY. Their staff does always such a great job at making sure that you're comfortable and have everything that you need. It's a great atmosphere to be with friends and family. I definitely recommend stopping by here with some friends and trying it out. You won't be disappointed!",1,0,0,Kara D.,"Garland, TX",0,1,0
5.0,12/15/2014,My company recently hosted our annual holiday party at Gran Morsi and it was truly a wonderful experience. We had our event in the downstairs private party space and it  exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting it to be so beautifully decorated for the holidays (typically you would have the option to decorate yourself anywhere else). It was a beautifully decorated and very spacious. The lighting was perfect and they had a beautiful brick candle lit accent wall that really set the mood. Don't even get me started on the food because it was phenomenal. Everything we ordered for passed hors d'oeuvres was delicious (shrimp/chicken/beef skewers). The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating not to mention the bartender was a doll. My only criticism would be more listed vegetarian / gluten free options on the menu but that's an easy fix. I would go back in a heart beat. Thank you Gran Morsi for making our holiday party memorable!,1,0,0,Julie H.,"Brooklyn, NY",211,18,8
5.0,12/11/2014,"Was in for dinner recently and had a tremendous experience. I was really in the mood for some sort of wintery Italian fare and this place really scratched that itch for me. My date and I started with the Sheeps milk Ricotta that had a really nice zip to it. Not something I've had before, but I will definitely get it next time. After that I had the Rabbit sweet potato gnocchi which had the perfect balance of subtly sweet and savory. the gnocchi were just right texture-wise. Then to end the gorge fest, we had the Forest Mushroom pizza with a nice Dolcetto. The manager Emeka  took awesome care of us since we had a few special requests that easily could have been played off as a nuisance. Not so, we were well taken care of. All in all, a tremendous experience.",2,0,1,Baron V.,"Manhattan, NY",90,12,0
3.0,11/19/2014,"All-in-all, not bad...not great.  The service was impeccable.  Some of the food was excellent, some not so much.  Loved the meatballs and black kale salad.  The branzino was good but the rabbit sweet potato gnocchi was really quite ordinary.   We'll probably go back but just be a bit more selective of what we order.",1,0,0,Bob H.,"New York, NY",1,28,0
5.0,11/1/2014,"My friends and I had an amazing dining experience at Morsi! Every dish we tried was better than the last, and the service was outstanding...friendly and professional. Each item on the menu should be shared, so order a number of appetizers and at least one pasta, one parmigiana and one pizza for the full treatment. For appetizers, I highly recommend the Bufalo Burrata - so fresh and delicious Polpette Meatballs - my fave of the night! Artichokes with Cheese - it's always good to have something green on the tableWe actually got to try two of the pastas, a more traditional Linguine Bolognese and also a spicy Black Linguine served with the Lobster Parm. Be warned, the sauce for the Lobster Parm and accompanying pasta is hot, hot, hot! To end the meal, we tried the Mushroom Pizza, which was so amazing and tasty...lots of cheese and mushrooms on a fresh thin crust. With so many great dishes, we didn't actually have room for dessert...there will just have to be a next time!",8,2,5,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",749,1181,35
5.0,10/23/2014,"Thank the Heavens I have finally found my new go-to Italian restaurant! It's about time TriBeCa opened up a place like this- perfect cocktails for after work drinks or dinner with friends when you're craving the oh-so-delectable carne pizza. First off, the décor is so beautiful and so charming- soft lights, bright white interior with the perfect touch of rustic. Secondly, the service is unparalleled-which I cannot say about most restaurants in NYC, especially in TriBeCa. Zachary was our server, and from the moment we were seated, he anticipated all our needs from water being refilled, to being so gracious as to meticulously walk me through the menu, personally going above and beyond to attentively accommodate my dairy allergy. As any dairy allergy victim knows, it is nearly impossible to have a fuss-free Italian restaurant experience, and Zachary made it his mission to ensure I was well taken care of. THE FOOD- or should I say rather, BITES FROM HEAVEN?! Appetizer: Roasted Brussell Sprouts with pancetta and duck fat- This rocked my world. I am a very picky and avid brussell sprout connoisseur and must say this dish was roasted and seasoned to absolute perfection. Main Course: Carne Pizza with coppa, meatballs, and sausage- My new addiction and a MUST HAVE on the menu. This baby was gone in ten minutes. It's very rare to be impressed by pizza in this city and I must say, this flavorful dish brought up the level.Desert: The Decadent chocolate cake was exactly that. Just thinking about this slice of heaven makes my mouth water...impeccably moist and completely satisfying to the groans of even the worst work day. Perfect with a glass of Pecorino.Lastly, the manager who was clearly busy as the restaurant was filling up as it got later, took time out to visit with our table and ensure that we had a more-than-satisfactory dining experience. And the thing is, he genuinely CARED. My experience at Morsi was tutto bene! From beginning to end, my friends and I were pleasantly surprised and thrilled to have discovered the best new restaurant in the neighborhood and will most certainly be returning soon. Cannot wait to try the rigatoni with pumpkin and kale pesto, the lobster parm, the braised short ribs, and the spinach pappardelle. Until next time...",2,1,1,Nika D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0

5.0,10/14/2014,"I actually came here the very first week they opened! It was nothing short of amazing. Being that the place was new I decided to go all out and order a full meal. For my entreé I ordered their version of Chicken Parm, which came with a very generous amount of breaded chicken! The chicken was great. The spaghetti on the side was good as well but I didn't get to finish it because I was stuffed from the chicken (protein over carbs!). Afterwards I ordered a second glass of white wine (I swear I was Italian in another life). For dessert I had their molten chocolate cake. I was surprised at first that the cake itself wasn't hot but I completely understand why. The cake is extremely soft and fudge-y so would probably fall apart when warmed up. I wanted seconds of the cake but I had to show some self-discipline! It doesn't hurt that the restaurant decor is really nice either, I'm a big foodie so that's the last thing I pay attention to but the place wasn't busy, decor wise and it gives off a spacious, relaxing vibe. Definitely a great place for a date!",3,0,1,Suhey E.,"Bronx, NY",14,17,13

4.0,10/9/2014,"After our last less-than-satisfactory initial dining experience at Morsi, management graciously reached out to us and asked that we give the restaurant another chance. Since we live in the neighborhood and had liked the ambiance so much, we decided to take a gamble. I'm glad we did because it seems like a lot of the issues we encountered the first time around may have been new restaurant kinks that have since been worked out. The menu had been tweaked and overall, seemed improved. Our food was a lot tastier and the service was much smoother. I would especially recommend the black kale salad with smoked trout, it was delectable.Ultimately, we're glad Morsi has come to the neighborhood and we'll be going back!",6,1,1,Mili G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,0
1.0,10/8/2014,"It takes a lot for me to write an unfavorable review, but this had to be one of the worst meals out that I have had in a long while.  Mostly, it was because of horrible service, but the food was nothing to write home about either.Started off by sitting in the very nice looking space and our waitress asking the typical tap or bottled.  We said tap.  She asked if we wanted some lemon or limes with it.  Impressed at that nice little extra, we said great - let's have lemon with the water.  I get a glass of wine and we also order 4 appetizers and 3 entrees because we are hungry.About 10 minutes goes by and they finally bring the water.  No lemons.  We let it go because it was not important to us...just strange that they offered it and then dropped it.  It was just the start of a perfect night. The wine comes next and they present a nice glass and then proceed to fill it up less than 20% of the way.  I am not a lush and not expecting this giant glass to fill, but it was small enough that my wife even laughed and took a picture of it.  I get wines by the glass often at restaurants and never have had cause to look at this and wonder what they were trying to pull, until tonight.Another 20 minutes goes by...no appetizers.  One of the appetizers was ricotta and bread, so i know that can't take any time to prepare.  I start to try to flag the waitress (i'm here with 2 young kids and can't be out late).  After 5 minutes of flailing about madly, i get tired of it and stand up to walk over to the waitress.  She is standing at the computer terminal facing away from the room, as she has been for quite a while.  I ask if she can hurry our appetizers because we are hungry and in a bit of a rush.  She tells me that she put it in, but the kitchen must be backed up (there are about 15 people in the restaurant besides us).  It seemed important to her that i know that she put it in and it was not her fault.  I just want our food, so I ask if she can just see if they can get it quickly. She says ok.I sit down and watch as she precedes to NOT go into the kitchen, but simply walk around the room once, not helping anyone that i can see then go back to the computer station.  I am getting irritable when the manager asks me if everything is ok and tell him that, no, it is not because we have been waiting for 45 minutes at this point for appetizers.  He goes into the kitchen and tells me it will be shortly.  About 15 minutes later (almost an hour after ordering), our appetizers arrive. Brussel sprouts - very tastyRicotta Cheese & bread - good, but only 3 small pieces of bread for a giant lump of ricotta - we had to flag the manager down again (our waitress was again MIA) to get another set of bread to eat it with.Meatballs - not bad, but nothing too goodFried Shrimp & Calamari - pretty bad - I have had better at a pizza joint.Still not sure what took an hour to make in the above list.  As soon as it arrives, i ask to have the entrees come out as soon as possible because my kids still need to do homework.Entrees arrive 20 minutes later.  We were sharing as they recommended was good for their entrees.  They come and leave the food on the table and walk away.  But, we had no individual plates, so we could not eat the food until we again flagged the manager down to ask if we could please have some plates.  Strange.Margarita Pizza - good.  Light and tastySweet potato gnocchi in rabbit sauce - not good.  so much sauce that i did not even taste the gnocchi.  was more like a lamb stew with gnocchi in it.  And, the rabbit bone that was in there that wedged into my gums didn't help.Duck breast parmesan - bad.  very bad.  didn't finish it, despite being hungry.  Gorgonzola cheese just completely dominated the duck breast (I can still taste it) and it was all way too chewy and not pleasant.  Literally left a bad taste in my mouth.We ask for the check and to have the 2 slices of pizza that were left over wrapped.  The waitress takes pizza and brings the check but the pizza has disappeared (at this point, we did not even bother asking what happened to the pizza slices).  And, to top everything else off, not only did she forget the lemons that she offered to start the meal, she charged us for a bottle of pellegrino on top of it.  We asked to get it removed and she disappears again.  I have to ask the manager to actually remove it.Some pluses (not enough to make up for the rest): once it was clear that we were very upset, the manager was fairly attentive to us and tried to make things better.  However, bringing 4 non-alcoholic cocktails to a table with a mother, father and 2 pre-teen kids was a strange choice.  Even if we enjoyed them, which we didn't, I don't really want my 11 year old daughter getting drinks from the bar just yet... I appreciate his trying - i really do - but the overall meal took over 2 hours to complete.  My kids didn't have time to finish homework and my wife's birthday was basically ruined",13,6,1,Chris S.,"New York, NY",0,7,0
4.0,10/1/2014,"Morsi is a new italian place that has just opened on Warren Street in lower Manhattan. While they are still working out some kinks in service I thought the food was excellent. The plates are on the smaller side. Morsi means bites in Italian and commonly would be referred to as little bites, a take on an Italian version of Tapas.We went a bit crazy and ordered Lobster Parmagiana, Duck Parmagiana, Chestnut Gnocchi with Rabbit. The Lobster was done Fra Diavolo with a nice spicey sauce. The Duck had a type of sweeter sauce that had dates and port. The Chestnut Gnocchi was awesome, Rabbit done perfectly. They also had pizza and calzones though we did not try them.They also have some interesting drinks. My friend had the Limoncello Margarita and I had a Manhattan. Both drinks were well crafted with a good pour. I don't usually like ""mixed"" cocktails but the Margarita was good.The decor is great with many plants giving it a soft room presentation. Decor was very good. I think that once they get their rythm in a couple weeks I would like to return to see if they capture the extra star in the review.",8,3,6,Tim C.,"New York, NY",266,150,0
