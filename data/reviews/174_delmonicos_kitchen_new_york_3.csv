5.0,4/26/2019,Amazing food and service. Not rushed at all and very attentive. Great place for clients a date or the family. A little high priced but worth it. Highly recommend.,0,0,0,Neil P.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,4,1
5.0,3/11/2019,Business dinner with colleagues.  Friendly service and perhaps being a quiet night super eager to please.  Ordered kitchen salad and brick chicken.  Colleagues ordered burger and shortribs.  Food was fresh and tasty.  Chicken was juicy and perfectly cooked.  Burger was delish as was ribs.Would definitely recommend this place!,0,0,0,Lee M.,"Oakville, Canada",18,433,579
3.0,2/15/2019,It wasn't a great steak. It just wasn't. Now I'm sad.                                                sad. I didn't finish it.  I gave it to a homeless man.  He asked me for something to drink with it.  I thought that was a little presumptuous but I'm not in his position and if I was I would probably ask for water to go with my leftover steak and spinach.  Oh well.  Life continues on and then we die.,7,7,4,t.j. m.,"New York, NY",2082,74,137

We even complained about one of our steaks and were told that what we had was medium rare and that's what we ordered. No offer to make it right, cook it a little more. Even if we were incorrect on the level of doneness, I would expect them to offer to cook it a little more. The cheesecake was not worth the calories.

2.0,12/17/2018,"The restaurant seemed to be very cramped and loud.  We were able to sit straight down, but it took our server quite a while just to get some water for us.  When he arrived to take our drink order, he also asked for our food order.  We told him that we still needed a minute to decide and that made him a little upset, it seemed.  Once we finally got our drinks, the server still had yet to tell us about any specials before asking again if we were ready to order.  The food was average at best (not worth the money in my opinion).  Final opinion is that the tables are WAY to close to each other.  We may as well have been sitting with the couple beside us because we could hear every conversation that they were having.",0,0,0,Chris R.,"Athens, GA",0,3,0
1.0,12/8/2018,Manager was extremely rude. I would not take kids here bc clearly he doesn't like them. We got there at 4:55 right before they opened- bar was full but he made it a point to tell us over and over they weren't open until 5. He sat us at a bar table and then asked us to move bc he needed our table! I have never been treated so rude at a restaurant! Steak was awful. Service was good. I feel sorry for the waitstaff that have to answer to this jerk!!  Final straw was when he threw our child's jacket at us bc it had fallen on the floor. Avoid this place!

1.0,11/29/2018,"I went here last night  and I was really disappointed. I was looking for a good steakhouse in NYC and I came across this. I ordered a Tomahawk Ribeye for 100$. Biggest waste of money. I ordered it medium and the mean was so red, perhaps it was even raw. Very disappointed. I tried to call down a waiter and it just took too long to get the service. This place is super pricey but for no reason at all a. The drinks weren't even that good and they don't have a large selection of beers. I asked the bar tender if she had any Belgium beers and they didn't have any. I highly recommend not going here.

1.0,11/14/2018,"Would you be disappointed to have to send a $51 filet mignon back to the kitchen TWICE because it was under-cooked? I certainly was. My medium steak arrived rare and came back a second time rare. The waiter insisted on having another steak cooked for me. My family finished their dinners well before it arrived and I got to eat alone - after waiting an hour for my dinner.

Whoops they forgot the appetizer and the burgers came out in 5 minutes- maybe less. Not exaggerating. They both tasted like they had been made the night before . My husband has the Benedict burger- dry , egg over cooked, sauce was chintzy. I had the double burger , it was paper thin, cold, crumbly, served on dry bread soaked in some kind of thousand island ice cold sauce from a nightmare. Fries were good though!

3.0,7/1/2018,"We had a group of 12 colleagues who dined at Delmonico's after a long day of meetings. We arrived around 6 pm and were sat within minutes. We were in the back of the restaurant in a room that had several large tables. We were dining on a night when U2 was in town, so there were a lot of groups dining before the concert. We started by ordering wine. Many of the bottles we requested were out of stock, but after 5 or 6 selections, we finally found one they had. The only ole, was there was only one bottle, so we had to go back to the menu to find something that had at least 3 bottles. We settled on one and moved on to appetizers. For the table we ordered grilled octopus, pork belly, pizza and oysters. All of the appetizers were fantastic. I really enjoyed the oysters, which were like an oysters Rockefeller. Our entrees varied, but I ordered a filet and we ordered a bunch of sides to share. My steak was more medium to medium well, but it took so long to get our meals that I didn't want to send it back. I'm sure the waiter either misunderstood me or they were just busy and got the temperature wrong. The taste was nice. The sides were good too. I tried the whipped potatoes and asparagus. The potatoes tasted like the instant kind, so I only had a few bites. My mom wasn't the best cook when I was a kid and she would use the boxed mashed potatoes, so the Delmonico's whipped potatoes brought back a not-so-good food memory. Overall, we enjoyed our meal, but it wasn't the best steak I've had. The nice thing is it was close to,our hotel, so an easy walk back after stuffing ourselves.",1,0,0,Pam W.,"Richmond, VA",48,404,2184

Now the food...Steaks were made to perfection and my cousins loved theirs too (rare). One cousin couldn't stop talking about the Delmonico potatoes. They were cheesy gooey deliciousness! I liked them as well as the fried. Wine by the glass was good too. Atmosphere is very relaxing.

2.0,4/25/2018,"For short, I'll call this DK instead of spelling it out. I've been there twice to justify my first visit to DK. For the amount of money spent there, I would have expected better service and quality of food.Let's start off with their interior, which is nice and simple. Can't really go wrong with the lay out of the restaurant. But what get's me the most of their service during lunch. The waiter took forever to come to my table and took a long time to get the bill. It seemed like he was avoiding my table while serving others . If it was busy, I wouldn't have minded his behavior, but it wasn't a full house and a table that recently sat down not to far from me had better service then my peers and I.For appetizers we had chilled seafood tower, colossal crab-meat and cured bacon. The seafood tower was decent but the oysters for some reason was inconsistent (not sure how or why). crab meat was pretty good and the bacon was not too bad. For my entree, I had the steak salad, I asked for medium rare but they gave me well done.

5.0,4/13/2018,"Delmonico's Kitchen achieved the goal! It kept me and my friends full!  As a steakhouse, the prices are expected to be expensive. If you are looking for a cheap steakhouse, look elsewhere because there isn't a quality steakhouse for cheap. The waiter filled our wines whenever he saw we were near empty, which is a testament to the service. Let's talk steak! Wow! The portions were more than enough. My friends and I had a journey trying to finish the excellent seared filet mignon. I was impressed and concerned that I couldn't fulfill my commitment to finishing a filet mignon.

2.0,3/6/2018,"I was really disappointed by this place. Two starts is actually a generous review considering how much our dinner cost. I ordered the delmonico steak and my boyfriend got the filet mignon. I asked for mine to be medium rare and it was very overcooked, and had a lot of fat. It was much closer to medium well, and my boyfriend's was closer to well done rather than the medium he requested. The sides were not much better. The ""crispy"" brussel sprouts were an overcooked, soggy pile of mush. The crab mac and cheese had zero crab in it. The delmonico potatoes were okay, and the creamed spinach was the only side that was actually delicious.

For a steak, a glass of wine and spinach I paid $90.00 - one person! Sounds crazy but true. And more: the service is not so good: after one minute I sit, the waiter came to ask if I was ready without giving me the menu.

I had ordered the crabcake sandwich with fries.  The fries were cool to room temp, not right out of the fryer but liked they were just sitting around and the crabcake was repulsive.  It was cool and uncooked, very little crab in an uncooked pasty floury substance.  The bun had been toasted with butter at some point, maybe when they opened that morning, but was now tepid as well.....there was nothing warm on my plate, it was as if it had been sitting in the window, not even under a heat lamp, for a half an hour.  I tried to choke it down as my friend was treating but it was frankly inedible.  Seems you would have to try to fail this greatly :(",0,0,0,Sera C.,"Weehawken, NJ",53,15,0

Even with all that, our server Eloy was incredibly welcoming. Our reservation was at 7pm and we didn't even leave till close to 10pm. If you eat here, ask for Eloy. He is knowledgeable and incredibly sincere. Eloy asked, ""Do we have time? Or are we in a rush?"". Oh we have time!"" I said, and with that a leisurely four course meal ensued.We tipped way beyond %20 percent, and if you have Eloy, you should too. Why? The ENTIRE staff was amazing. Everyone was accommodating and kept our table clean and set for every course. So you have to remind yourself that that Server has to tip EVERYONE out. And Eloy deserves his full %20. No less.

2.0,1/2/2018,"I had been to the original Delmonico's in the past and had not been overly impressed, but I was recently invited to accompany a friend to a holiday party at their slightly more casual, Delmonico's Kitchen.  We arrived at the rustic steakhouse, which looked like most others, and headed to the rear party room.  A fully-stocked bar had been set up for the event, but the bartender was still willing to get custom cocktails from the main bar for anyone crazy enough to be unhappy with the plethora of party options.  We stood around for a bit, socializing and enjoying our beverages, but then it was finally time to take our seats.  Delicious, warm rolls kept us satisfied, while we made our selections from our custom prix-fixe menu.  I started with the Kitchen Salad, a sad and scattered pile of greens, topped with crispy shallots and a sherry vinaigrette.  I was not impressed...Then, my entrée of Faroe Island Salmon arrived.  Well, its ""simply grilled"" presentation was non-existent, as the exterior had no grill marks.  In fact, it seemed more like it had been baked and was completely flavorless.  The mushy, orange filet was completely unappealing, though the accompanying sautéed baby spinach was fine.  Thankfully, my friend let me sample his Filet Mignon, which was tender and slightly salty - way better than my fish.  Dessert was a creamy cheesecake, topped with fresh berries.  Though I typically do not like this type of pastry, their version was actually deliciously creamy and light.In the end, I am not sure what package the party planner had utilized, but the mediocre (at best) meal and high-end liquors, cost us over $200 each!  There are too many excellent steakhouses in Manhattan to venture back to Delmonico's Kitchen.",3,0,3,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

2.0,8/23/2017,"If you eat there, only order steak. All other choices are below average. My mom, wife and I went there for dinner last Friday. We ordered from the restaurant week menu. My wife got the 20 oz rib eye, my mom had the 8oz filet mignon. I had the overnight bbq short rib. Starters are 2 crab cakes and 1 risotto. Food quality and taste were mixed. The rib eye was acceptable but it's the best in what we ordered. Cut was thin. Less but close to 1 inch. Filet mignon was nothing special. But no complain. My short rib is horrible. Taste was bland, The whole meat was more like boil, chewy like pulled pork. Side dishes grit and spinach were bad choices. They didn't offer refreshing taste compliment to the chewy short rib. Crab cakes are bad too. Only tasted pepper. They lack the taste of crab or any seafood. Risotto with shrimp was good.",0,0,0,Jimmy Z.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,40,3
2.0,8/18/2017,"This inside of the restaurant is very elegant and romantic, but the service was terrible. We were seated by who I assume was our server who almost immediately asked if we would be using a coupon that night...I was surprised that a restaurant that portrays itself to be this upscale even offered coupons. We were ready to order for quite a while, but he just kept standing by the register chatting it up with another waiter. Luckily, the food runner brought us waters and complimentary bread. Honestly, the food runner was more our server than the one we were assigned. We started with an order of the bacon, which may as well have been an entree because wowww these slices are cut very very thick. Definitely the highlight of the entire meal and made for a great snack later that night. For our meals, I opted to choose from the Restaurant Week menu the risotto, short rib, and the baked alaska. Looking at the official restaurant week menu online for Delmonico's, I see neither the risotto nor the short rib. The risotto was undercooked with some pieces of the rice slightly crunchy - the flavor was fine though the dish overall could have been warmer. The short rib was cooked very well and would have fallen right off the bone if there was one. My boyfriend ordered the Delmonico steak, which he liked a lot although he had to cut off a lot of fatty pieces leaving not a ton of actual steak. The side of house cut french fries he added on for $9 left me wondering what the heck they even added onto these potatoes to justify the price. Ordering the baked alaska even with a $6 upcharge was a must since it's iconic to Delmonico's, but it was so small and I have definitely had better versions of this dessert elsewhere. When it came time for the check, we struggled to find or even identify our waiter. I ended up having to ask a random waiter if he could bring us our check and box up our leftovers. If I were the one paying, I would have entirely forgone a tip for our waiter and left the food runner cash for his service that night because he was the only one at our table that night.",3,1,1,Cynthia C.,"Houston, TX",121,840,1373

3.0,6/28/2017,"Today, I decided to try their special market fish rather than the classic steak options. To the point, dry and flavorless. There's two fish options on the menu: salmon and their market fish. There's also a shrimp risotto option, lobster, and others. The halibut came with soba noodles which I preferred over the fish itself. I believe there were bits of maybe scallop or some other chewier seafood under the fish. I definitely would've expected a buttery bite to come out of the fish. I can't rate the steak unfortunately. But my friends who ordered it got Brussels sprouts, asparagus, and French fries with it. The French fries were delicious, perfect amount of crunch on the outside and they're thicker than your standard French fry. Most wines will run you $15 a glass. The bread that comes complimentary is stale. There's French baguette slices and a garlic roll, neither are very good. Oysters were fine, however thousand island as a sauce for these?? What? That's so gross!!?The octopus appetizer comes with cut up potatoes. This fish was good, the octopus meat had the perfect amount of chew to it. Quality over quantity in this case, it's a smaller dish. Service is great, our waiter was very attentive and very hospitable. He made us feel very welcome and he was well versed in the menu. I like the interior itself the bar area is separated from the dining. There is a burger on the menu... I'm always on the lookout for a good burger so I may try this next time.

I do not expect to spend $30 on cab fare and $250 on dinner in order to listen several small children and toddlers out of control. We arrived at approximately 6:30 pm. As usual, the waiter was terrific and we got a nice table in the corner. We heard more than one child making a bit of a noise but figured this was short lived and an anomaly. We ordered the seafood platter as a starter. It was terrific. But the noise of the children did not diminish. It got worse. By the time I received my salad, the noise was unbearable. I felt like we were eating at Chuck E Cheese. I called the waiter over to ask what was going on? He apologized and told us there were several families in the bar with small children. We asked to speak with the manager. it took her over 15 minutes to appear (we asked twice). When she finally appeared she said ""What do you expect me to do? There are three families here. I can't ask them to leave"" As she was preaching to us, a toddler came running by our table. I said, I have no problem with families, but I won't pay $250 for a dinner to listen to screaming children. She stood her ground. I asked for the check. I was charged $100 ( just for the small seafood platter and a salad) for listening to screaming kids! If you want to run a ""family"" style restaurant I have no problem with it. Just don't pretend to be something you are not. We should not have been given a bill at all. We gave our waiter a nice tip for his attentive service, but our evening was ruined!

When we made the reservations, we also called if an appointment around 7:30 would be okay but was told by the manager we must be seated at 8pm or after to use it.

Came with crab meat lumps, small lobster tail, tuna tartare, a few oysters, 2 shrimps and 2 lemons. The portions were very small and not worth it for $60 at all. Also came with sauce on the side; cocktail sauce, horseradish mustard cucumber yuzu mignonette. The chilled seafood (crab meat lumps and lobster) was slightly overcooked and very chewy.We ordered the delmonico steak and filet mignon 12oz. Both were overcooked. The steak was ordered medium well but it was more well done. Slightly burnt on the outside and chewy. The filet mignon was medium rare but was more of a medium well. Both lacked flavoring and there was no steak sauce provided so it was quite dry. The creamed spinach was a little disappointing. For $12, it came in a tiny skillet that served one. Definitely not enough to share.On the side note, the drinks were good and strong. The Indiana summer was really strong and tasted more like straight up Hennessy than a mixed drink. The pomegranate margarita slightly tasted like a mix of gummy bears and cough syrup, but it was still good.The food was only 3 stars, but the ambiance and service made up for it.

Ambiance was great, a lot bus boys (guys in black shirts) setting the table, filling up water and take plates away, but not enough waiters( guys in white shirt).

I think it's all about the expectations. If you charge $50 for a piece steak with no sides, people will build up expectations. The restaurant does not live up to the industry standard if they want to charge the same high price. It just doesn't work that way.

Firstly, they presented the check directly to my male companion. They didnt even place it on the table waiting for one of us to grab it. I made it a point to lean across and take it from the waiters hands. This is 2016, women pay for dinner all the time. Additionally it was my friends birthday and i didnt necessarily want him to know the cost of the bill. And then, presumably because we are younger looking and perhaps not their usual clientele. The waiter said "" i assume you will be paying with groupon?"" I have no issue with Groupon, if one can save money why not do it.

The steaks were cooked well, and the presentation was exactly what you'd expect from a restaurant of this kind. No faults there.Where they lost a star, though, was on the service and atmosphere. Our waiter was British (don't remember his name) and he seemed really aloof the whole time, as if our table wasn't worth paying full attention to. There were a couple of times that we asked a question, or said something, that he didn't seem to hear, or didn't respond appropriately to. Overall, he was a lot less friendly and helpful than the waitstaff we had the last time. (Although the other servers, busboys, etc. were fine.) Also, they were out of one of the two wines we asked about, but they hadn't made a note on the menu. In a higher-end place such as this one, the wine list needs to be up to date, at the very least. Plus, when the waiter poured our wine he did so very aggressively, rather than the smoother way I've seen other servers use. It was indicative of his overall lack of finesse with the entire meal.Finally, this might be a silly thing to note, but it was really weird that they were playing pop music in the restaurant when we arrived, and kept playing it at an audible (though not high) volume through about half of the meal, when they abruptly switched over to classical. I don't think you need to be playing Mozart all day every day to be considered a fancy restaurant, but when you're playing ""The Locomotion"" on a Sunday evening in a restaurant serving $50+ steaks, something is amiss.",0,1,0,Zachary M.,"Worcester, MA",1,58,0
2.0,9/4/2016,"tl;dr: Sub-par steak for price, would not return.I had heard about Delmonico's storied reputation as the oldest restaurant in New York, and I love steak. So I was excited when Delmonico's sister establishment popped up on Groupon. The wine list is pretty decent. They didn't have the half-bottle that I initially wanted, so we went with wines by the glass. Champagnes and barolo by the glass for under $20 and fairly generous pours, too - can't complain there. We started with the kale salad, which was okay. We also had Delmonico's potatoes as sides, which was basically potatoes au gratin.I thought our highlight of the evening would be the porterhouse for two. Boy, what a disappointment. It was lukewarm when it arrived (to give it a generous evaluation), and turned frigid quickly on the cold plate it came on. If you're charging $60 per person for steak and do not know how to serve it at the right temperature, it's a major problem. The crust felt soggy, the tenderloin side was a sad, fibrous mass of dry flesh, and the meat was generally not as flavorful as the dry-aged steaks that I've had elsewhere, probably unaided by the temperature it was served at. I ended up not finishing the steak which, believe me, never happens. NEVER. I did enjoy the baked alaska, but it wasn't amazing enough to redeem that blunder of a steak. My wife thought it a bit bland. I don't know how DK's other dishes measure up, but if you're in the mood for steak go to Peter Luger's, Keen's, or Wolfgang's instead.

My company had a Grey goose martini, good as well. They start u off with a good bread basket, good bread nice & soft butter. Appetizers we started with Shrimp cocktail & the Blue Crab Cake. Shrimp cocktail was good, good size shrimp with 3 sauces a mustard base, cocktail sauce & one that looked like it was soy sauce? Mustard & cocktail sauces both good the Soy like sauce to me doesn't go well. Crab cake was delicious, great tasting crab cake on a cucumber salad very good only complaint it's kind of small. Main dish I tried the NY strip steak, thick juicy piece of meat perfectly cooked medium rare steak had a nice flavor, I had it with the King crab mac & cheese side.The king crab Mac & cheese was delicious very good taste nice amount of cheese good flavor combination. My company had the Steak frites , smaller piece of meat also cooked well. Fries were very good. With a small amount of room left we decide to try the Mango sorbet, wow very good delicious taste.

We arrived at Delmonico's Kitchen right on time and were sat at a nice table in the dining room to the right of the bar. Our server was a charming gentleman who was very kind, but not overly-attentive. Our water glasses were never empty and plates were cleared at just the right time. We didn't feel rushed and when we asked for recommendations or had questions about the menu, the server was informed and made great suggestions.We opted for the house rose by the glass, which was lovely. Just a hint of sweetness with a dry finish. For an appetizer, we went with the roasted beet, feta and cucumber salad. It was generous and between the two of us, we polished it off quickly. Very, very good. It was a good starter - light enough to keep us from getting too full. For the meal, my sister went with the hand rolled cavatelli and I decided to go with the Delmonico steak (when in Rome...) with a side of brussel sprouts.Everything was amazing. Is the steak worth $51? I can't really say...it was by far the best steak I've ever had. Simple, elegant, cooked perfectly, beautiful cut, moist and buttery. It lives up to the hype but it's a very expensive steak! The crispy brussel sprouts side also tops my list as the best brussel sprouts I have ever had. They were made with bacon,onion, honey and sriracha...I think I ate more of those than I did the steak. Of course, we wrapped everything to go...nothing was going to waste!

We both had a great time. The bar attendants were very friendly and nice. The food came out good too. The only complaint here is that I observed that many of the tables were not filled in the hour and half almost 2 that I was there for which at first I assumed are being held for reservations. From a business point of view, the restaurant manager/maitre'd failed to maximize the earning possibility for not seating us in the dining room for which we could have ordered more dishes and possibly some dessert to end our night.

The steak doesn't need their famous steak sauce, but is very good with the steak sauce as well depending on your preference.

There are other menu items for people who don't want steak, but it's not worth the price unless you're going there for the meat.The menu at Delmonico's Kitchen in midtown is more limited than the downtown location and some of the items aren't the same.

I was going to spend a stupid $30 on a salad with crab but was interested in a swordfish sandwich that was one of their specials. It actually ended up being pretty solid--a good chunk, well cooked.

A restaurant doing well should not be selling groupons, at least that's my opinion... We ordered a Porterhouse for Two - medium rare,  but what we got was half the steak as rare and the other half as medium well. Surely we did not finish our meal, and of course when we told our waiter, he mumbled something and did nothing about it. The asparagus and garlic whipped potatoes were great though.

When we got there, the place was packed and they were behind. We had to wait at the bar for a table to open up. Yes our reservation was set, but they were just so far behind on everything. The host was even communicating to the patrons that they were so overbooked the last 2 days because everyone wanted to use the Groupon.There was only 1 bartender (female). She looked like she was worked to death. She was always busy. We wanted to order drinks from her but she took forever to give us the cocktail menu and then she never came back to take our order. As we waited, our table finally opened up.....near the front door where you always feel the draft when ppl walk in.The waiter took forever to show up. At this point, i was very annoyed where you can read my face. We agreed to ""let's just get this over with as quickly as possible"".The waiter finally came. Gave us water and I asked for the wine list. He disappeared for a good 5-10 minutes before finally bringing me the wine book. I picked out a 1/2 bottle of pinot noir. He took the order (reciting the bin# out loud so everyone can hear) only to have another waiter come back 5 minutes later to say the bottle is not available and tried to up-sell me on a full bottle. I said no we'll just take 2 glasses of the pinot noir. I wasn't in the mood to drink much, so we wanted to take it easy.For apps we ordered the small seafood tower. The tuna tartare and the west coast oysters were good. The east coast were beau soleil but I had better beau soleils at Wild Edible in Murray Hill. I'm usually a big fan of Beau Soleil but the ones here weren't that good. The lobster was only a 1/2 of a small one. The crab meat was okay.For entrees, I ordered the strip. Medium rare. I think they gave us crappy knives because the crust was seasoned well, but it was hard as a rock. The strip was cooked well. The filet mignon was definitely better though. For sides we got the crab mac and cheese and brussels sprouts. The brussels sprouts seemed to be overcooked, mushy and a bit burnt for my taste. The crab mac and cheese was just mac and cheese.

The woman at the next table had the same problem and drew it to the waiter's attention.  He tried to convince her it would be medium rare in the center, but when she cut through the steak and revealed otherwise, the kitchen did replace it to her satisfaction.  My wife's salmon was rather underdone.  Appetizers and side dishes were good, but not dazzling.  Wine is overpriced to make up for the ""discounted"" food, I suppose.  Won't be going back.",1,0,0,Robert F.,"Allentown, PA",0,7,0
2.0,1/14/2015,"Service: Excellent. Our waiter was quick when expediting food, fast to refill our drinks, and witty throughout.Food: Steaks were cooked too quickly, leaving the outside charred a bit too extremely compared to the (medium-rare) interior. Dry-rub was tasty; however, no steak sauce was available which was a bummer. Brussel sprouts were fantastic. Crab mac-n-cheese had one small piece of crab in it and was not even close to worth the extravagant $18 price tag. Appetizer of clams was terrible. Clams were not stored properly, resulting in an overly fishy flavor that clams don't normally have...definitely avoid the seafood here.Wine: Wine list is extensive and sexy; however, it is extremely marked up. Very few, if any, red wine bottles under $50. Great selection at outrageously high prices.My girlfriend and I went there on a Groupon, which was definitely worth it. Don't come here for a full-priced meal. Your money is better off elsewhere.

Everything from the drinks to our steaks were just okay, not worth sending back but not very enjoyable either.   We had inquired with the waiter to know exactly what the signature steak was before ordering, he told us it was rib eye and dry aged - very flavorful.   Concerned about how fatty it may be, we asked and he told us it was not.  The steaks came out fairly quick and were the rite temperature but had little flavor and were extremely fatty.    My boyfriend decided to stop eating it after a few bites because he felt it was so disgusting, he usually cleans his plate ( especially at a steak house)    I was shocked that this was the dish they put their name on.The service was fair but I have seen much better throughout the city.    Overall this place was a disappointment and not worth all the hype of the Delmonicos restaurant group   It was a lot for a mediocre meal, so I dont anticipate on returning any time soon but perhaps I would give it another chance on a night when it's not so busy.",0,0,0,Nicole R.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",411,37,8

They do lose one star (maybe they should lose more) for their official Delmonico's Steak, it was prepared at a temperature that was MUCH too high, burnt to a crisp on the outside and barely cooked on the inside.

My scallops and extra side of bernaise sauce was Way too sweet. They said they placed butternut squash with my scallop dish but they must've added sugar or something but it was still too sweet.

4.0,1/4/2015,"I bought the Groupon for this place in hopes to treat my boyfriend out to a nice dinner without breaking my bank. For the most part, the food was good and the experience was enjoyable. However, I do have a few annoyances that prevent me from giving a full 5-stars:1. We ordered the porterhouse for 2. While tasty, the portions were a bit smaller than expected for the price. I've paid less and received way more at other steakhouses. I was OK with the amount of steak we got, but I wish the price was a little lower. Maybe the Delmonico steak would've been a better choice. 2. The Billy's House Bacon was disappointing. One piece I ate was entirely fat - not a speck of meat in it. Some of you may be into that, but I felt like I was going to go into cardiac arrest after 2 bites. My boyfriend and I foolishly ordered the larger plate of bacon (for $26) which includes 6 large slices. This dish size would be great for a larger group, but not for a party of 2 (unless you plan on eating light for the rest of the meal). I'm surprised I didn't die later that night.  3. The wine is ridiculously expensive. Even the watered down house Merlot was $13/glass. The cheapest bottle I saw was around $45 for a red - and that was for a half bottle! Sorry, but whomever decided they could charge the same price for a little glass as they could for a full bottle you could buy in a store... needs to get pushed down a flight of stairs. 4. Our waiter was attentive until we got our steak, then didn't come by for about 30 minutes. I'm a fairly patient person, and thankfully bus boys were there to refill our water and take away our plates, but we were sitting at our table with nothing in front of us except for our glass of waters for a good 10 minutes. Alright, alright... maybe I'm being too nitpicky on this. But the waiter left us hanging again for another 10 minutes after we politely turned down the dessert menu. We thought he was getting us the check, but apparently he was just standing around with the other servers. I had to make conversation with my boyfriend this entire time - horrible!! ;)However, I did enjoy how quiet the restaurant was, and we were sat in an area where we didn't feel cramped next to the diners next to us. It is a good date spot, but be aware, as another reviewer mentioned on here, you do not get much value for the money. Even after my $80 for $150 Groupon, I still spent close to $180 (including tip). The wine was a big contributor of this, but that's my fault for not checking the price before buying.",3,0,0,Lauren T.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,23,27

1.0,12/16/2014,"So my fiance and I go to Delmonico's Kitchen for his birthday dinner with a reservation. There's a raucous holiday party going on in their main dining room, so we're seated by the front door in the bar area. They were showing sports on the TV, and people were cheering and groaning. Plus, we kept getting blasted with cold air when the front door opened. We asked to be moved and were told there wasn't a single table left in the house.  Ok, fine, not the romantic dinner we were hoping for, but we were hungry. A woman comes out of the holiday party and vomits spectacularly right by the host stand and our table. She walks through her own sick out the front door. She shouldn't have been overserved, but it's not the restaurant's fault she puked. I don't blame them for that. But the staff stood around looking at the vomit for 10 minutes. They stationed a waiter there, presumably to help people avoid walking through it since it was near the front door, but he really just ended up pointing out to people when they'd already stepped in it. I truly don't understand how hard it is to grab a mop out of the kitchen and take care of it. The staff was just looking at it with horrified expressions on their faces. I was becoming nauseous myself with the smell and was about to retreat to the restroom when the vomiter returned. She was absolutely wasted, with puke all over her legs and feet, holding a tissue to her mouth, looking like she wasn't done getting it all out. On her way to the restroom, she continued vomiting. I didn't end up following her to the restroom. At this exact moment, our food arrived. The runner seemed surprised that we didn't want to eat next to a pile of vomit showing no signs of being cleaned up anytime soon. My fiance had to demand that we be moved, which they accommodated. We were re-seated in the dining room upstairs, which smelled fine. I get that it's confusing to transfer tables between sections and servers; I used to be a server myself. But this restaurant could not get it together the rest of the meal. There was massive confusion, with our new server trying to take our order again, us sitting there for ten minutes waiting for our food, several different servers taking over our table, bringing us the wrong check, etc. The food was decent, but not fantastic. It's hard to say if I would have enjoyed it more without the smell of vomit lingering in my nose. They had put our food under heat lamps or something, and by the time they brought our food to the new table, my fiance's medium-rare steak was well done. Portion sizes were pretty good. We ordered 3 sides but really only ate the equivalent of one side between the two of us. The restaurant brought us a complimentary baked Alaska dessert as an apology, which we appreciated. It wasn't very good, but I also don't like dessert. I don't think I'll be back, even though it's in my neighborhood. For a couple hundred bucks after tip, we could have had a much better meal at many other restaurants in the city, even if you factor out the puke and the amount of time it took to clean it up.

They have a great wine and scotch selection and Dennis (manager?) is typically up there hanging out; he's a good chat. The decor is a little tacky but clean and contemporary. It doesn't feel like it has the same history (read: it isn't a museum to itself) as Keens and Peter Luger, but it has been around nearly as long. Apart from being the birthplace to the delmonico steak (arguably the best cut) they claim to have served the first commercially available hamburger in the country.

3.0,11/26/2014,"As an ardent steakhouse fan, I was excited to dine at Delmonico's Kitchen for the first time. We arrived on a Saturday evening at 6:00 pm (we had reservations). We were immediately sat  in the main dining room. The decor is what I would describe as 'contemporary American-Italian grandmother's dining room'. Dark, warm colors. Minimal lighting. The table spacing was a bit cramped in my opinion. My date and I felt as if we were sitting a little too close to other patrons. Service began immediately upon our being sat. Our server was warm, humorous and attentive. Water and bread with butter was followed with wine. The wine list is decent, and there are many types and sizes for your pallette. We started with an appetizer - the thick-cut bacon. My piece was thick, meaty and tender; however, my date's was predominantly fatty. I tried the the filet mignon (medium) while she ordered the steak frites (medium temperature, which is essentially a smaller cut of the Delmonico's steak. The filet mignon was tender, juicy and cooked well for the temperature I requested. The steak frites was, in our opinion, simply terrible. It had the consistency of liver, and was well done. We brought this fact to the server's attention, who said that the steak likely kept cooking after it was removed from the flame. Our question was - why wouldn't the chef know to adjust for this by removing the steak sooner? It's a steakhouse, and the one thing they should know how to do is steak. For sides we had the roasted brussel sprouts, roasted cauliflower and the clssic delmonco's potatoes. The potatoes were delicious, and we both highly recommend them though be warned they are cheesy and filling. The cauliflower was greasy and would likely not order again.  I will echo what another patron said about the dessert. Mediocre at best. I think what made our experience less enjoyable was not the food, service or decor, but the other patrons. As this restaurant is in Midtown near larger venues like Madison Square Garden, shopping, etc., it receives a different clientle - perhaps less sophisticated. For example we watched the table next to us dip their steak fries INTO the small Heinz ketchup bottle on their table. There was a boxing match at the Garden that night, so perhaps the restaurant drew that kind of crowd, but it made our dinner a little less enjoyable. Bottom Line: you could easily do worse than Delmonico's Kitchen. For a decent steak in a causual setting I recommend it. If you want to do the classic steakhouse experience with a different crowd than I suggest other venues in and around the City.",2,0,0,N. O.,"Jersey City, NJ",7,38,3

The high point of the meal was the excellent french fries.  Do not miss them.  Medium thick.  A bit crunchy on the outside but tender inside.Only major downside was the bread.  The baguette bread was fine, but the roll was awful.  If they had warmed both it might have helped, but I advise them to get new rolls. Of course in a steak house, that is what matters.  Although they feature the Delmonico's Steak, I like a New York Strip.  It came perfectly medium rare and was nicely charred on the outside.  Still it was not as juicy as it could have been. Desserts were good but not exceptional.  The Valhrona Chocolate Salted Caramel Tart tasted more of crust than of chocolate.  Needs serious reworking and might be okay.  They make a decent sundae with fruit inside.  The Baked Alaska, which is apparently a specialty, was good but not exceptional.  The meringue was properly soft, but not soft enough for my taste.  Could have used some more ice cream too. Although there are better steakhouses in New York, definitely a place for a nice meal.  I would be especially interested in going back if they fixed some of he small problems.",1,0,0,Randall S.,"Manhattan, NY",837,109,13

Porterhouse for 2 (strip+filet), the butchers cut (dry aged, bone-in ribeye), and the Delminco (boneless ribeye). Started off with the bread, sadly bread was not warm and butter also a little on the hard side.. Forgive me, as I usually judge the higher end restaurants on these details.. Billy's Bacon was pretty delicious. Nice crusty semisweet sear on the outside, lots of fatty goodness in between. It wasn't as thick as I expected but good nonetheless. Steaks were all well cooked. We ordered medium rare for all. Brother had the Butchers cut which was my favorite for the night.. This bad boy had an amazing sear on the outside, tender on the inside. Was so flavorful and with the perfect texture. Steak was super thick tho, and a little too rare as we got near the bone. (We'd prolly go with a medium cook next time)Second fav was the filet part in the porterhouse.  Not as good of a sear but meat was incredibly tender and delicious. The Delmonico was also good as well, the ribeye had so much flavor, and a great fat to meat ratio. We had the Crab Mac and cheese, creamed spinach, and Delmonico potatoes as the sides. They were all pretty good but the Delmonico potatoes stood out the most. For dessert we ordered the Baked Alaska. I kinda hoped for $12 they would flambé the dish in front of you but no, they don't :( Was yummy but nothing to die for. Overall a great experience tho.

The portion was pretty small and the steak was a little burnt. Overall service was good, servers were very attentive. Although one of them mistaken the drink as water and actually poured tap water into the drink.

But they didn't. For the food, my husband shared the porterhouse and it is the WORSE porterhouse I have ever.  Tasteless and it is barely warm.  We all agree the porterhouse here is precooked.  What's the worst is the the cut on the porterhouse is so thin and feel like something is wrong in the kitchen. If you charge the market price for porterhouse similar to other steak houses, you should provide quality of meat for customer so they are satisfied and come back and bring in more business.  Their signature steak is a better choice.  Dessert time, similar to what I wrote above, very rushed.  When we left at around 8:30pm, the restaurant is more than half empty.  Why they are so rushed?  Need training for the people serve in this restaurant.",0,1,0,Lisa L.,"Queens, NY",5,21,1
1.0,8/31/2014,"i'm not really sure where to begin...only that i've been to other ny steakhouses (sparks, del frisco's, etc.) and, after reading the description of this restaurant, had higher hopes. MUCH higher.to begin...we were seated immediately and immediately offered drinks. yes to drinks, but can i see a menu first? cocktail and food? maybe put my napkin on my lap? we asked for water and the guy scooted off.the water was poured and we waited. and waited some more. and STILL we didn't have menus. finally another server brought over menus and asked if we were ready to order. NO. can i look first? after a few minutes we placed drink orders and needed a few minutes before we decided on food. drinks were good!so, FINALLY we're ready to order and have some questions. we went through a number of things: soup/catch of the day, details on side dishes and preparations on a few mains. we asked about the butcher's cut and how it differed from the delmonico steak. we couldn't get a coherent answer. after a bit more prompting, butcher's cut was a bone in rib eye (24 oz); DM was boneless and was 20 oz. oh....and the preparations are significantly different.i opted for the caesar and lobster cocktail; he chose the butcher's cut and we had the brussel sprouts and crispy hashbrowns. let's address the sides first. brussel sprouts were great. ""crispy hashbrowns"" were more like a potato quesadilla. oozing with cheese (not a good thing in this case -- and i LOVE cheese) and it just wasn't that appetizing. and now for the mains. i loved my caesar and cocktail, so no complaints from me. but the butcher's cut...despite decent preparation, there was no way that thing was worth $68. $19 more than the DM. i mean...let's get real. if it was dusted in gold, maybe, but there was nothing SO SPECIAL about this steak that it was worth $68.and the baked alaska sucked. my fingers are tired at this point, but it wasn't worth the time i spent eating it.AND...the service wasn't subpar, it was poor. we waited forever during courses and our servers were always distracted. the restaurant wasn't even half-full, which made it EXTRA frustrating. it really detracted from the experience.i wanted to give two stars because the food and drink were good, but overall, the experience was a disappointment. in closing, there was nothing special, period.",7,1,0,Heidi T.,"Manhattan, NY",3,24,7

Mine came with string beans and roasted potato. Her's came with fried onions.   Wait... wha?  Fried onions....  that's all folks, no veg, and that's more of a garnish than anything else.  And considering we added $15 to the restaurant week price for her to get the bigger steak, I'd expect more.Service was not good.  The waiter came by twice within 4 minutes to see if we were ready, right after we sat; it was 6pm and they want the table.  I get that, but taking care of current customers is important to repeat business.  Also, they could have made more money off us had they come around and asked about refills (even once). I would have gotten a second glass of wine, and the dessert was thrown at us as we took the last bite of dinner, without even asking about coffee.

2.0,7/29/2014,"Tried this place for restaurant week and will not be returning. While the service was quite nice and a pretty decor, the quality of the food was very lacking. For $38pp, I felt cheated out of a quality meal. Appetizer was a risotto with tiny shrimp, ruined by what was called a ""lemon zest"" but they consider large chunks of peels to be zest. The first bite ruined the dish...tasted like chewing on lemon peels. We both made a collection of the peels....was more than would be needed for a table of 10 people. Needed a ton of seasoning. Main entree was a tiny filet. Again, a lack of seasoning. Nothing on the plate to wow me with the dish. Potatoes were tasty but the spinach just tasted boiled. The bread was nice when you added a hint of salt. Dessert was poor. The molten chocolate cake wasn't cooked. The ""molten"" was hot in some points and refrigerator cold in other parts. Other annoying tidbit - for some reason they sat everyone in the same area, leaving an entire side of the main dining area empty, so I got the enjoyment of listening to an overtly loud, boisterous guy try to impress his company....he failed miserably.

Go for the risotto, you can get a salad anywhere else, the risotto is amazing! I can eat a whole 3 servings of it for dinner instead. That's how good the risotto is!We ordered Delmonico's Classic steak with Fried onions and the filet mignon with spinach and potato fingers. You don't even need steak sauce or any sauce, everything is perfectly seasoned. There are two steak sauces though if you really need it: Delmonico's steak sauce and Delmonico's chipotle steak sauce. STICK WITH NO SAUCE its amazing. Usually Potatoes are bland but these potatoes are fascinating and very herb-y. The steak was cooked to med rare with perfection. Crispy outside extra tender inside and seasoned just right (not even too salty)!We finished off with cheesecake and chocolate cake... BOTH EXCELLENT CHOICES... For an additional $10 you get a glass of red bordeux that pairs well with the steak, but if i were you splurge that $30 for the bottle because usually that bottle should run you upwards of $75 at Delmonico's or most steak houses. YAY for restaurant week..Service was exemplary, despite being very full, everyone kept checking on us... BUT maybe they could get a little more organized.. after being asked, I tell one guy some fresh pepper please and when he goes to get it, the next guy asks again.

The scallops were terribly under-seasoned and covered in a way too sweet sauce that negatively enhanced the scallops own natural sweetness. Not a good dish to start off. Her lobster bisque fared worse. Imagine drinking the water from a cooked pot of lobsters - watery, unseasoned, 0 actual lobster in the soup.  Ugh. For mains I had the Delmonico steak and she had the Short Ribs. Steak WAY too salty (and I LOVE salt), slightly undercooked (for a medium rare) and nothing like what a 40 day dry aged steak should taste like.  The short ribs again fared no better - while this dish was cooked well the dish was very bland and again covered in a way too sweet sauce. What's with the palate of the chef at this place??!  SERVICE:  This is one area that needs *major* improvement.

3.0,5/3/2014,"My first time at Delmonicos Kitchen. Initial impression is it is a smaller (downtown original location) Delmonicos. For an appetizer we had a shrimp cocktail and the asparagus with egg and mushrooms.  Both were very good. The shrimp cocktail came with 4 extra large shrimp that tested fresh and were properly prepared.  The asparagus dish was something I have not had before and was quite tasty. Entrees were a filet mignon and NY strip. Brussel sprouts for a side. Both steaks were high quality, but a little too salty for our taste.  One pet peeve of mine is having to wait (in this case too long) for steak sauce. If you're a 100+ year old steak house, you should be prepared that some will request steak sauce.  I know the purists out there will tell me a good steak should not require a steak sauce, but I have always enjoyed a good quality molasses based steak sauce. Overall the restaurant was good not great.  If you are expecting the price to be proportionate to the smaller sized restaurant, don't.

It was restaurant week with Sunday dinners included at $38. My husband and I ordered the scallops which were jumbo sized and perfectly tender. My daughter ordered the iceberg salad which was generously topped with bacon and blue cheese. We also ordered supplemental appetizers because we weren't sure how big or small the portions were especially since we were so hungry. The tuna tartar was an average portion, which was so deliciously fresh. The charcuterie and cheese plate came with 3 meats, 3 cheeses, nuts, fruit jelly spread, and a uniquely different, but yet delicious truffle honey (Oh how we love truffle anything!). For our entrees, my husband and I opted for the upgrade of $15 with the Delmonico Classic Steak and my daughter got the Petit Filet Mignon. The Classic was the size of a T-bone without the bone served with thin fried onion rings. Both steaks were cooked perfectly at medium rare. The Petit wasn't so petite, and served with potatoes and string beans. I also ordered an extra side of brussels sprouts, which were a bit too salty probably due to the bacon. We were so full from the appetizers that we had to wrap our entrees to go, so we'd be able to eat our desserts. Oh boy, I'm glad we did!!! We ordered the baked Alaska ($5 supplemental), chocolate mouse, and cheesecake. Everything was good, but the Baked Alaska was everything I wanted in a dessert... marshmallow outer core with burnt tips, ice cream and cake in the middle. It was a perfect portion of heaven, and I enjoyed every bite. The chocolate mouse wasn't too sweet or rich... just right. Lucian was our server and he was very friendly, courteous, extremely knowledgable of menu and specials, and provided recommendations without steering away from restaurant week menu. There was a little mishap with the apps being brought out all at once, instead of,splitting into 2 courses. We didn't mind since we were so hungry. Lucian apologized for the miscommunication after the runner dropped off the apps, which was great of him to follow up with such concern.

4.0,1/12/2014,"Based solely on the food, I'd give Delmonico's Kitchen 4.5 stars. My wife and I really enjoyed our meal. We shared the filet (one of the top 10 we've ever had, we agreed) and the salmon (also one of the tastiest ever).  I was less impressed with the asparagus and the famous Delmonico's hash browns (which are supposed to be crispy but seemed closer to burnt), but the  Burrata was delicious.On the slightly disappointing side:- The menu online and many reviews mention the Carpaccio, which we were looking forward to sampling, but it is no longer on the menu.  (First, update your web site. Second, why remove something that many people obviously loved?)- The decor is nice, but the presence of the big screen TVs and the music detracted from the ambiance. The TVs are in the bar and can be seen in most of the dining room through the windows between the two rooms, and they were simply distracting. Okay, if you're a restaurant in midtown, have the TVs on during lunch time when people want to catch the news and market updates, but turn the damn things off in the evening when people are trying to have a nice meal! If Delmonico's Kitchen wants to be a sports bar, it should serve nachos and chicken fingers, otherwise the TVs have no place!  I also thought the music choice was weird--it was your average contemporary hits mix, of the sort you'd hear in your local Applebee's. On the whole, I thought someone went to great trouble to give the place a certain look, which Delmonico's Kitchen then diminishes by not thinking a bit more about the presence of the TVs and the selection of music. - Our server seemed a little rushed and distracted (even though we visited on an evening when the restaurant was half empty). He got part of our order wrong, although he made up for it by offering us sorbet for dessert. I'd give the experience 3.5 to 4 stars and the food 4.5 stars, so Delmonico's Kitchen gets four stars from me.  With a little more care and polish in the experience, this could be a five-star restaurant, I believe. Definitely worth a visit if your in the 36th Street area, which is is not exactly known for its selection of fine dining.",1,0,1,Augie R.,"Chicago, IL",167,835,147

The hostess and servers were really nice and accommodating. My husband and I love the Ribeye cut so we both ordered the Steak Delmonico. We had the Delmonico Potatoes which was pretty much potato fingerlings with sausage, truffle and drowning in cheese, and grilled Asparagus which did not disappoint. We had the Baked Alaska Ice Cream Cone which is probably one of the coolest desserts I've tried in NYC. Oh, I can just hear the New Yorkers sigh and get upset with this comment but it's true for me.

I was lucky enough to be here for a holiday party, which meant I could dine without the headache of footing the tab (and it WILL be a hefty one).DK looks to be modeled after the original, Downtown location, which boasts the title of oldest standing restaurant in New York. We were ushered to a private room on the second floor that had classy touches of the 19th and early 20th centuries. It's worth visiting just to check out the decor.The kitchen here is excellent. Several of us, including yours truly, went for the Signature Steak, which was tremendous in size, depth, and succulence: done to perfection with medium rare specs. I actually cleaned off the whole plate. The tuna tartare starter was very good, as were all of the classic sides (sauteed spinach, potatoes, etc.). We had a mixed dessert tray, but by that time I was in no shape to discern one from another, thanks to the excellent wine list (Pouilly Puisse, St. Emillion...).

3.0,12/7/2013,"I would really give this place 2.5 stars if I could, but since I can't I will round up.  The ambiance is very different than the downtown location.  It's a lot more laid back and has more of a cafeteria feel. I actually prefer this for a regular dinner over the more formal business like setting.  We never really knew who our waiter was because no one ever introduced themselves to us. And, the person who took our order was not the same person who brought us our drinks or the food. Then the person who brought us our bill was neither the first nor the second person. So I guess collectively, utilizing the team approach, the service was decent to good.The food was really unimpressive. My wife ordered the Cesar salad and it was a bit amusing that what came out was a half of an uncut wedge of romain lettuce with a little dressing sprinkled on top. For $12 we felt like they could've done something to it to make us feel justified in eating a Cesar salad there as opposed to just going to the super market, buying a romain lettuce wedge, cutting it in half and dumping it on a plate.  I had the cold lobster as an appetizer and it was just ok. For the entree we shared the porterhouse for 2 and we were really unimpressed.  We ordered the steak medium rare and the steak came out medium to medium well. The filet mignon side was pretty much cooked throughout and the strip side only had 3 slices that were actually medium rare. The steak was pretty much flavorless.

Each bite was so tender, so juicy and no additional steak sauce was needed! i ordered a side dish of their crab mac and cheese which i thought was okay, but my boyfriend absolutely loved it. He said it tasted great even as leftovers! Our last dish was the baked alaska ice cream dish. I was expecting the ice cream cones, but what we got was probably better. This looked like it was bigger and more ice cream for us to share. Overall, i loved this place!!

DK is a great place but it doesn't belong in that group. The ambiance is nice but not to compare with the greats; the sides are ok not great; and the meat is darn good but it takes a bit more to qualify at those prices. My filet mignon was delicious, a half notch below the Strip House - some of it was med rare, as requested, but about 1/3 of it was medium. The ribeye was extremely flavorful - but there was too much gristle at the ends and it was medium rare, not rare. We had a groupon, and weren't too fazed by these lapses. Had we been paying full price, I would expect the flawless grilling that goes with a top steakhouse.The restaurant has a heavy hand with cheese. The Delmonico potatoes sounded divine but were mushy, flavorless and blanketed in melted cheese that didn't meld with the dish. We got the roasted oysters with spinach and cheese. The spinach was creamed spinach (which was delish) which was once again blanketed with same  cheese. We could barely find the oyster, forget about tasting it.

Although the baked alaska was good, it was not as good as the original.

On the second night the welcome was warm and friendly.At the bar I looked over the wine selection in a huge book--very steakhouse.  There were a decent number of moderately-priced bottles included.  Most of the bottles were just listed, not described--I assume the ones that actually have a blurb are the curated selection.  I had the sole rose, which was a Sancerre; very different from the Provencale roses one more usually sees, but delicious. The pour was quite generous and the price reasonable--$12 or $13.  The bar was pretty big but not that full on a Thursday--I think Fashion Week pulled all the locals uptown.  The bartender said that it's pretty busy right after work.For dinner, we elected to skip appetizers and go for dessert after.  We ordered one Chateaubriand (for two), and the steak-frites.  Both were delicious.  The steak-frites was a ten-ounce ribeye and a big portion of thick square-cut fries standing up in a little basket.  I would definitely go back just to order it again.  We also had creamed spinach and hash browns to round out the steakhouse experience.  The spinach was buttery-licious.  The hash browns were cut kind of big, which looked a little different but was very tasty.  Both portions were more than enough for three to share--we couldn't finish.  For dessert, have the beignets! Take some home for breakfast! Yum!  The trio of baked-Alaska ice cream cones were also tasty, as was the green-apple sorbet.Also, there seemed to be ample well-trained staff--I never had any difficulty in catching someone's eye to bring the waiter, and the responses were both cheerful and speedy.  I can't wait to go back.",0,0,0,Leslie M.,"New York, NY",0,16,0

They sit on an amazing spinach sauce that complimented the crispy texture and flavor of the oyster.We shared the Delmonico steak, since it's 20oz and we're more excited about about trying the sides. Sides are the main reason I go to steak house, and unfortunately the ones we ordered were lacking. The crispy hashbrowns were lacking flavor and crisp. They were more like soggy latkes. The roasted corn and wild mushroom side was boring. I was hoping for more seasoning and more wild mushrooms, looks like mostly store bought crimini's in the blend.Unfortunately we didn't save room for dessert.

I decided to choose selections from the Restaurant Week menu.  I was a little disappointed overall. I had the Lobster Newberg appetizer and the sauce was rich and amazing, but the lobster itself had been overcooked and was tough and rubbery.  I ordered the Delmonico steak , the boneless rib eye, and had it prepared medium rare. The steak was well seasoned and cooked to my specifications, but the meat was somewhat tough and fatty; it was not tender. The char was good ,but trying to chew the steak was a chore due to the texture. The steak came with onions and string beans and they were fine and complimented the steak. I chose the Baked Alaska Ice Cream Cones for dessert and they were delightful; they were sweet, cold and flavorful. I wish that the dessert was larger because it was so good. If I return , I would make different choices, maybe try a different cut of meat , because the elements of the meal just did not meet expectations and did not come together .

The steak was also cooked well, although my friend got medium which looked more like my medium rare so order a temp up. Our deserts were a little too sweet for our liking.

I thought the scallop appetizer and bread (when we finally got it) was amazing! But my filet mignon was just okay. I needed to add salt (which I never do) and it wasn't hot and fresh.

For entree, I went for the obvious choice, Filet Mignon. The waiter recommended Medium and it came out perfectly with a small side of spinach and meshed potato. I really love the steak; it was very tender and not too rare. The meshed potato is rich and smooth. I ended the dinner with their fancy doughnut.

Delmonico's Kitchen has a slightly lower price range than Delmonico's Restaurant and has a cozier feel. (Read my review for Delmonico's Restaurant here: yelp.com/biz/delmonicos-…) I went there about two months ago with a couple of friends for dinner. Between the three of us, we ordered the shrimp cocktail for the appetizer, two Delmonico's Steaks for the main course, and the creamed spinach, mushrooms, and classic Delmonico's potatoes for sides. We didn't order dessert because we were so full by the end of the meal that we really couldn't have eaten any more. The shrimp cocktail was delicious. The shrimp was fresh and the cocktail sauce was pleasantly tangy. The creamed spinach was creamy and flavorful and the the potatoes were well-seasoned. The only disappointment was the mushrooms, which were a little overcooked and dry. As usual, the Delmonico's steak was superb, cooked to a perfect juicy medium rare and full of flavor. There's was no need to add extra salt or pepper to the steak. The steaks came with special Delmonico's fries, which are sliced extra thin and fried to a crisp. What I liked most about the fries was the crisp and the fact that it left virtually no oil on the plate. They know their stuff in the kitchen. The service was very helpful and attentive. The waiters always made sure we had what we wanted. Because we were sharing two steaks between the three of us, the waiters also had the steaks pre-cut on the plate and served it to us at the table on separate plates. And they always made sure our glasses were filled. I would recommend this restaurant for a romantic dinner, for special occasions, or even for a casual get-together--they do have a bar.

2.0,1/16/2013,"Delmonico's Kitchen is Delmonico's expansion into midtown, and while some of the aesthetics remain similar, the tone of the restaurant is very different, and definitely has a ""midtown"" feel to it. the service is less smooth and classic as the downtown location.the biggest difference between the 2 is the noise level and the spacing between tables. this place likes to pack it in so that you can't enter or exit your table without inconveniencing your neighbors. in addition, the noise level  was way too loud. as soon as we sat down i realized i would have to shout in order to converse with my friend across the table. it was so loud that at times it was hard to hear what our waiter was saying.surprisingly, we weren't offered any bread service. i don't know if that was because we ordered off the RW menu or just the service was so harried. as we left i noticed the table of ""ladies-who-lunch"" that sat next to us received an entire tray of assorted rolls and breads.  ordered RW menu: appetizers:  Scallop Risotto and pasta of the day which ended up being Parpadelle with Bolognese Sauce.  the risotto was cooked perfectly al dente in that it wasn't too mushy or crunchy. it was slightly sweet and creamy and topped with 1 large scallop, which was well cooked and retained it's original seafood flavor.  the parpadelle was handmade and paired with a flavorful bolognese that cut the salty, meaty aspect of the sauce with the lightness of tomato.  entrees:  Slow Braised Short Rib with Whipped Potato and Garlicky Spinach and Filet Mignon with Chef's Seasonal Vegetables (which ended up being carrots and green beans).  the Short Ribs are definitely a filling entree,  just short of melt in my mouth but still sufficiently tender. they provide an ample serving of the potato with the the short ribs.  the Filet was cooked exactly how i'd ordered it: medium rare. they maintained the nice char on the outside but kept the inside warm but still rare. if it had been served with a side of potatoes i would have been in heaven.desserts: New York Cheesecake which was served with blueberries in syrup and Beignets. the beignets were served with a chocolate dipping sauce and a creamy, subtley-lemon white dipping sauce that i can't identify. the beignets were served warm, dusted with powder sugar and were amazing, especially when dipped in the unidentified white sauce. a decent meal but nothing exceptional.",0,0,0,Tina M.,"Queens, NY",162,97,1052
4.0,1/15/2013,"Restaurant Week 2012 Review. Went to Delmonico's Kitchen for a promising restaurant week menu on a Monday night. Restaurant was only at 60% capacity and dimly lit. I noticed that most people must have been regulars or corporate diners and were not eating from the RW menu. But our whole table was there for RW. Overall the food was good! Its worth your $38 and the portions were decent. The service, was subpar though. I felt the waiters judged you for eating off the RW menu and let us know this. They also offered a $30 bottle of chardonnay or pinot grigio as part of RW week. When we ordered it, the waiter winked at us, saying, yes its only $30. As if saying we were cheap and didnt want to spend more then that for wine. How rude. The scallop risotto appetizer was delicious. Only complaint was that there wasnt enough on my plate! The risotto was creamy and it had chunks of butternutsquash in it with a perfectly seared scallop on top. The butternut squash wasnt cooked thru so you did feel chunks in the risotto. The pasta of the day offered as another app was papparadelle with bolognese. It was also good as well. It was a decent portion for an appetizer. The filet mignon was an 8oz and it was seared and seasoned well. It came with a few carrots and stringbeans. But the meat itself was tasty. The shortribs were tender and came with a nice sauce, tasty mashed potatoes and some spinach. The meat portion itself was tiny though. Choose the filet if you want more protein!There is an $15 supplemental upgrade to a Delmonico Steak. It's well worth it if you can finish a 16oz steak. This was super tasty and seared so well and melted in your mouth (even though our med RARE steak did come out med WELL), we did not send it back. It was still delicious. Though, its upsetting they can mess up their 'so called' signature dish.  For dessert, the beignets turned out to be the star. It tasted like powdered freshly fried zeppoles. Minus the grease. The chocolate mouse was also decadent and served nice and cold with a great creamy texture. The fail was the cheesecake. Overly salty and too dense and nothing to remember at all. Because the restaurant wasnt at capacity on a Monday evening, the service was attentive and the food arrived all the the same time and glasses were promptly filled. But when the bill came, and our group of 7 was dividing our check, the server came by to me and noted, ""Oh gratutity isnt included"". I wanted to say, ""No shit sherlock, I can read!""  but just nodded. We handed the check back with a CC and when the slip came back to sign, I noticed they added an automatic 18% gratuity on the final bill, which we were going to pay anyways...but why didnt you just put it on the first bill?

4.0,12/7/2012,"Awesome! This place took over for Murano's which had great Italian food,albeit expensive for what it was, and impeccable service but a very tired and dated atmosphere. Enter Delmonico's. First off, having another NYC staple restaurant come into the neighborhood is fantastic!  I've been twice for lunch since they opened. The first time I was pressed for time so I wasn't able to have a steak but it was fortuitous because I was able to sample the sandwiches. We had the Kitchen Club and the Cheese Steak. Both were really good and at about $15 each for a restaurant of this caliber is really a bargain. Service was great and the atmosphere is really nice. Upscale, modern, but not over the top or stuffy. The menu is more limited than the namesake in the financial district but still gives you a variety of options. We had steaks and traditional sides on our second visit and they certainly met our high expectations. The filet was tender and cooked perfectly and the Delmonico...what can I say but ""wow"". Keen's is the benchmark in the area(now that is a five star steakhouse) but I would definitely put this place well above Uncle Jack's, Shula's and Staghorn. Highly recommended!",0,0,1,Tom D.,"New York, NY",17,34,0
5.0,12/5/2012,"For those of you in the neighborhood, Delmonico's Kitchen used to be called Murano Ristorante.  Before the change to Delmonico's Kitchen I would only ever go there for lunch which I have done many times.  Now that they have undergone their transformation I will and have been in for dinner.  They do a great job.  The food is good and well prepared, the steaks are great, the seafood delicious and the appetizers are very good.  The service here is fantastic, they are just the right amount of attentive.  Denis and Joseph do a great job making everyone feel welcome.  The bar is well done and has a good vibe for both before and after dinner.  They are starting to get busy, a reservation is a good idea, even for lunch.  Give this spot a try you won't be sorry.",0,0,0,Garen A.,"Manhattan, NY",3,48,14
5.0,12/4/2012,"Went Monday evening.  We were very excited to see another upscale dining option in our neighborhood open up as the choices in this segment are slim: there's just mostly bad pub food and quick eats 'round these parts.The decor is lovely.  Very tasteful and not too over-the-top, faux fa-schmancy like a lot of new restaurants.  It's a well-done modern take on an old-school steakhouse atmosphere.  Good low-light venue for either business meetings or dates.For a starter, we shared the scallops dish.  The two scallops were huge and could have been a meal on their own.  Very tasty although the accompanying risotto was a tad tough.We had the rib eye and mignon and both were cooked very well: medium well with just the right about of charring.  Steaks were flavored deliciously, I would say in the realm of (but not quite as good) as OG Delmonico's.  Asparagus side with fried egg and wild mushrooms, as well as the potatoes were delicious..Service was highly attentive and ever single member of staff very friendly, from our waiter down to the coat checker.  The manager was doing an exceptional job moving around talking to customers and actually helping and directing his staff rather than just greeting or yelling at waiters as is often the case.  Only minor ding was I'd finished a cocktail and multiple waiters asked me five times if I wanted another while my girlfriend's water glass was nearly empty -- no big deal (more comical than anything), the servers just seemed over-eager and a little out-of-sync.We didn't have dessert (we were in a bit of a rush) or wine, so can't comment on this.The food was excellent and, for a new restaurant, most everything seemed to click right.  A bit pricey for what we ordered, but expected I suppose with a legacy establishment like Delmonico's. There are a couple very minor service hiccups: obvious opening jitters that will be ironed out (from other 1st-week restaurants I've seen, this one gets an A++). We'll definitely be back.",0,0,0,Jim P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,13,0
5.0,11/30/2012,"FIRST!!! YES!A new Delmonico's opened recently in midtown. The original is one of my top joints, so I had to give this place a try.Flavor: 10I had the rib eye (Delmonico steak), and it was pretty much perfect in every way. Much like the original location, the cuts are top-notch, cooked properly, juicy, well rested, crusted nicely and extremely flavorful. It was served with a nice stack of fried onion strings, similar to what they do at George Martin. It was a great way to add a little saltiness with each bite if you wanted.Choice of Cuts & Quality Available: 9The selection here is very similar to the original, with the addition of a ""butcher's pick"" - I wonder though if that is just the butcher choosing one of their standard cuts, since the item was simply a Delmonico with a dollop of Maytag and served as a composed plate with asparagus. No matter, though, because the quality is fu&king ridiculous anyway.Portion Size & Plating: 8The sizes are great - slightly on the smallish side, but you can eat every bite. Same as the original location. Plating is basic; neat and clean.Price: 9Delmonico's is always a great buy for your money. The prices are average but the quality and flavor are top-notch - that makes for a really good deal. A single cut of steak tops out at $45, which is great compared to other places that go as high as $55 for a steak.Bar: 9The bar here is fun. There's some booth seating across from it in the main entryway, so you can sit and eat in the bar area if you want as well. Lots of foot traffic near Penn Station brings in all manner of people coming in for a drink. The martini was done well too; with three big olives to top it off. And speaking of big... if you're a breast man, you can sit at the bar and check out the juggy bartender with tittays the size of melons bobbling out of her top.Specials and Other Meats: 9There were several specials: one from each section of the menu. Duck ragu pappardelle for the pasta item, a grilled salmon for the fish item, the ""butcher's pick"" (Delmonico with blue cheese and asparagus) for beef, and a baked apple tart for dessert. As for other meats, they offered chicken - that's it! And not their classic ala king either - it was another preparation. Now, I am a purist, but they could benefit from a manly pork chop or even a lamb item to round this section out.Apps, Sides & Desserts: 9This portion of the menu selection is similar to the original restaurant. We tried the oysters, the creamed spinach, and the classic Delmonico potato item, which was a ramiken of cut up potatoes, skin on, baked with cheese, bacon and spices. it was fantastic. The spinach was just like the other joint: not quite where I like it to be, lacking just a little something. Oysters were absolutely incredible: creamy, briny, and delicious. Only down side is that they did need a bit more shucking to get the meat fully detached from the shell. Also, we dug into the hamachi crudo (bright with blood orange flavor, fresh and light) and ""wagyu"" carpaccio (deep, rich, and peppery) appetizer items - both were thoroughly enjoyed and we wished we had more. The dessert menu was completely different here than the other restaurant, as far as I can remember. We tried the Boston creme biegnets (which were like little zeppoles with a Boston creme flavored pudding and chocolate syrup sauce) and the chocolate hazelnut mousse (which came with a small scoop of coconut ice cream). They were both really fu&king decadent and delicious. If it was socially acceptable, I would've rubbed the sh!t all over my balls and sat there for a while in pure bliss.Seafood Selection: 9You're pretty much limited to lobster, day boat cod cassoulet, and the catch of the day for entrees (which was a grilled salmon). But there is a great variety of seafood for starters (both hot and cold) to ""tide"" this section over. Yeah that's right. I put the word ""tide"" in ""quotes"" in the ""seafood"" section of my review. Pulitzer. My wife tried the Lobster Newberg this time around, and it was pretty good!  She ordered a smaller sized portion, but it still came with a lot of lobster meat. It was flavored with leeks and fennel, and served in a light broth, almost soup style. Service: 10As to be expected at a Delmonico's establishment, the service here is impeccable. Our server, Aaron, was fabulous, and the manager Dennis came over to the table and hung out with us for a bit and told us all about the new establishment and how things were happening with hurricane Sandy and their grand opening. Great guys, the both of them. The table breads were warm and varied from raisin bread, to ""everything bagel"" flavor logs, to olive bread. And the butter is whipped, smooth, creamy, soft, and sprinkled with a natural salt. Really nice way to start the meal.Ambiance: 9 ... review cut off for length",8,5,4,JohnnyPrimeC.
