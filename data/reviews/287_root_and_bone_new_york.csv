5.0,4/27/2019,"Root and Bone's the only place I'll recommend Chicken and Waffles to. Red Rooster? Fukouttahere. Ruth's? Schmooths. Root and Bone? Game of Thrones. You already know.I came during brunch hours and for $28, the chicken and waffle sandwich wasn't so much a ""sandwich"" (because there was only one waffle), and more like a dick slap to the face. But damn... if that wasn't the tastiest dickslap to the face. Also: you had to keep eye contact. The size was an even bigger insult to injury. I've given birth to premature babies bigger than this chicken and waffles. But damn... if this wasn't the tastiest premature baby I've ever tasted. I really can't stress how tasty these chickens and waffles were. Plus whiskey syrup.The mac and cheese was surprisingly bland. To this day I still resent my friend for suggesting that. But the biscuits. Some real Southern love there.It's a cute place but I left hungry from portion size, so I'd only really treat Root and Bone as a treat. Or if you're trying to impress a girl or something by spending money. What a world we live in.",2,0,0,Quoc L.,"Manhattan, NY",223,283,475
4.0,4/19/2019,"This place has been in my bookmarks for months and finally got around to trying it on a weeknight. The restaurant takes reservations, but it was also relatively empty around 6:30. It started picking up after 7:30/8.Cocktails are in the $12-15 range; I can't remember what we ordered, but both of them tasted good! My friend and I decided to go a little crazy/overboard and get the family supper, which is $35 per person. It comes with deviled eggs, biscuits, fried chicken, cheese waffles, seasonal vegetables (for us, it was collard greens), mac and cheese, and desserts (for us, it was cheesecake and pecan pie). I somewhat regretting eating that much food, but it was SO amazing. The deviled eggs are a little weird because they're infused with beets and it gives it an interesting twist. The fried chicken is AMAZING - it has a slightly lemon taste from the iced tea and it's cooked perfectly.Highly recommend this place for dinner and maybe come super hungry if you want the good deal of a TON of delicious food for $35.",1,0,0,Joanna G.,"Manhattan, NY",55,158,0

The restaurant wasn't busy when I got there, several empty tables but as the night went one more people came. We shared the waffles. I ordered the shrimp and grits and it was definitely an acquired taste. My friend did not like it. I don't remember what she order but it was like a salad. I definitely want to try the chicken when I come back. Great service. Relaxed but chic ambiance. I'd recommend it.",0,0,0,Tamira G.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,114,182
4.0,4/12/2019,"So I gave this place a 4 out of 5! First off the waiter was really sweet and welcoming, the venue itself is small but super cute and has that southern comfort vibe! We ordered the family supper which was deviled eggs, biscuits, mac and cheese, greens and of course fried chicken. The food was great with the exception of the chicken. It was a bit salty and the lemon garnish made it a bit bitter. I would come back here again and try something different.",0,0,0,Tinisha C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,2
4.0,4/9/2019,"Fried Chicken galore! We ordered the full chicken and shared between two people. We had plenty to bring home for leftovers.the fried chicken was tender. I do wish some of the pieces were a little crispier. I felt like the wing was lacking any sort of crunch. Needless to say, it was one of the best pieces of fried chicken I have had in NYC. The tobacco honey sauce here is everything! It compliments the chicken very well. I absolutely loved the Macaroni and cheese! It was baked to perfection and I give this 5 stars. Asking for hot sauce is a must! Sweet tea (half and half) $5 - was very refreshing. I have been to the south and boy does Georgia make their tea sweet. So happy to have the right amount here! The mismatched plates here are such a cute touch and give a nice home style feel The biscuits here were so dense and delicious. They were very moist and not as flaky and dry as most are in the south. I loved that they were served with salt, rosemary. The found that I did not love the dipping sauce for the biscuits. However, the presentation had a nice touch. Service was very attentive and accommodating - and this was nice. I am looking to trying dessert next time!",3,0,3,Alexia G.,"Brooklyn, NY",127,493,141

1.0,3/31/2019,"Picture it, my friends made a reservation here to take me out for my bday. When we sat down, we had a table against a wall, I'm talking to my friend and over her shoulder I see the biggest roach crawling on the wall. We react just as anyone in their right mind would, and the waitress just causually kills the roach on the wall leaving a streak of it's guts smeared on the wall. We then get causually asked if we want to move tables, granted we were told no other tables are available and we have to give this current table up in the next 55minutes. That's it. No apologies, nothing. But a table next to us whom were white get the sympathy and check in we should have gotten. We are people of color, maybe thats why. Needless to say, we left. Didn't feel right staying and giving this place our business. Given what just happened, the least they could have done was to let us stay at the table or not have us wait. Then basic customer service could have quelled this, but that didn't occur. If an employee is not equipped for damage control situations, get a manager looped in, that simple. I wouldn't recommend this place at all, I understand things happen and we are in NYC, but still basic customer services and hospitality ethics should be present. There are endless choices in NYC, go elsewhere..",3,0,0,Luciano R.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,4,0
1.0,3/31/2019,"NEVER EVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!! I made reservations for brunch (2:30PM) to celebrate a friend's birthday yesterday, March 30, 2019. The place was crowded, and I had heard good things about the food. When my friend arrived, we were seated in the corner, near the kitchen. After placing our drink order, I noticed my friend's eyes begin to widen. He said ""OMG there is a huge COCKROACH behind your head!"" I immediately gasped and sprang from my seat. At this point everyone at the restaurant noticed the cockroach. The waitress went to get a napkin and preceded to smash this HUGE (about 2 inches long)cockroach. The swat left cockroach's guts on the wall next to our table!!! To add insult to injury, the waitress preceded to ask a table full of white patrons nearby (I'm Black) if they were okay and apologized to them without so much as even acknowledging what I had experienced. She merely asked ""what do you want to do? Move tables?"" No, I want to know why huge cockroaches are crawling around during brunch.I felt so bad for my friend because we weren't likely to get brunch at that hour anywhere else. We left, without eating, and no one asked if we were okay or anything. The customer service is SHIT, and I advise you to go elsewhere.P.S. i am a native NYer, and I am certainly no stranger to cockroaches and rats in the city.

Took them around 7 minutes to seat us after arrival and we were pushing up against their afternoon x evening break (they're closed 4-5!). After ordering the food came out in like 10 minutes.We opted to order a bunch and family style. Some serious southern comfort! We ordered... tea brined chicken basket, brisket meatloaf, biscuits n gravy, ribs, waffles.Everything was delicious while tasting fresh and cooked with love.

4.0,3/20/2019,"Edit: David reached out to me and resolved the issue. I highly recommend this place for the fantastic food and drinks. It is surprising that there are so few good southern restaurants in Manhattan, but Root and Bone is one of those. Just hoping for better host service going forward. Original Review: To get a response, I have to post this online since I didn't get an acknowledgement via an email I had previously sent. We had a dinner reservation a few days back. We arrived on time and were informed that it would be a 15-20 minute delay. I understand that delays happen but the planning should have been better since that's what reservations are for. The host on the night was borderline rude and unapologetic for the delay. After 20 minutes of waiting, we were informed it would be another 10 minutes. We were finally seated 40 minutes after our reservation. This is unacceptable since it shows a clear lack of planning. Anyway, these things occur and it would have been fine if the host has initially apologized and made up for it. However, we were twice informed(passive aggression) that we can ""order"" drinks (i.e. we would have to pay for our drinks standing up while waiting for a delay caused by the restaurant, which we ended up doing). Respectable restaurants typically provide complementary drinks and appetizers for such a long delay, at least in my experience. The service from the host severely let us down.The food was excellent though and so was the wait staff. It just left a sour taste in our mouths which such poor, broody and arrogant customer service up front.",0,0,0,Rathore V.,"Hoboken, NJ",2,209,0
3.0,3/19/2019,"I came here quite a long time ago (probably 2016), so I'm struggling to remember exactly what my experience was like. The first thing I would say about this place is that it's too dimly lit. I can understand ambiance lighting, but this place is taking it a little bit too far. Secondly, the food: I ordered the shrimp and grits, which I believe must be pretty popular here? Portion size was fine, and the shrimp and grits themselves tasted okay- however, there were quite a few onions in the dish, and they were pickled for some strange reason. I have no idea why the chef thought this would pair well with the dish (I've never had this in my shrimp and grits before, though I will admit I've only had shrimp and grits several times in my life- though always in different states). I felt that the onions were way too sour, and kind of had an overpowering taste, which clashed way too much with everything else going on in the dish. As a result, I kind of just picked these out and ate around them, essentially. In short, the lone dish that I had here was great except for one ingredient. Hopefully, they already removed this from the dish.",2,1,1,Matt L.,"New York, NY",108,694,604

5.0,3/13/2019,"If you go to Root & Bone, you should 100% buy the fried chicken. Their fried chicken is crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside and not dry at all. Another specialty is the grits. I tend to not like grits, but the way the restaurant makes it with shrimp (""shrimp & grits"") is very savory. The biscuits and gravy was also pretty solid. The only dish that did not stand out to me was the collard greens. It was a bit bland compared to the rest of the food. The drinks are a bit creative and if you want to order some fruity drinks, the Merit Badge and Promise Ring are a great choice! The scenery is dimly lit and a really great date night spot.

Ahh the romance in the air...or perhaps it was the smell of Mac n cheese. Hard to say. Anyway I digress. We were seated right away in a cute corner tucked away from the main area. The waiter came up and immediately were brought water and our drinks came out fast. We got the family style supper with the biscuits, chicken and waffles, deviled eggs, sides and delicious dessert. Absolutely worth it. Everything was amazing. Best presentation were the deviled eggs. Gorgeous. I also liked how the plates were mismatched in a hipster home cooking vibe sort of way. My fav food was actually the dessert. It was key lime pie and I am such a sucker for citrus. It was just the right amount of tart with that rich buttery base. Mmmm. The food was incredible but I must say the service was BOMB! I've never had my glass of water filled so frequently in a way that was not intrusive.

3.0,3/7/2019,"I came here during Restaurant Week. 3 stars because we weren't impressed with the food, but they had a great restaurant deal and everyone who worked there are incredibly welcoming and friendly. For the restaurant week deal you got biscuits for the table (these were the best part of the meal...so good!) and then you got to choose an app, entree, and dessert. In addition you also got mac and cheese and a cucumber salad for the table. They also had a special discounted drinks menu to go along with the restaurant week deal. The food was fine, but being from the south, I thought it was nothing special. For entrees we got the chicken and waffles and meatloaf. The meatloaf wasn't your classic meatloaf...it was an ""elevated"" version of meatloaf and was kind of dry. The waffles were actually pretty good, but overall it was nothing special.",0,0,0,Sarah A.,"New York, NY",1,13,3

5.0,3/3/2019,"Two friends and I ordered dinner from here, which amounted to about $20 per person. This is kind of expensive, but it is supposedly the best fried chicken in the EV, so we had to give it a try. First of all, the food is amazing. The waffles are super soft I would, even though the cheese had already cooled off and I would have liked them to be a bit bigger and fluffier, the chicken was very tender, and the Mac & cheese was the right blend of cheeses. I will say that the portions are a bit small for the price, which is something to keep in mind. But the food is worth it!! If it's one of those days where you come home from work and just need some savory comfort food, then this is it. I have heard that the wait is crazy, and I don't think it's worth waiting in line for 2 hours, but if you can get it delivered or make early reservations, it's a must-try! I do think they should readjust their prices and/ or rethink their portions, because it is very good and people would order more often!",0,0,0,Ava F.,"Manhattan, NY",3,49,44

3.0,2/9/2019,"I've been wanting to try Root & Bone for a while now, so I figured why not try it during restaurant week! My friend and I had the deviled eggs and biscuit for starters and the chicken and waffles for our entrees. I like the fact that they are creative and thinking outside of the box, but I really did not enjoy the deviled eggs. The texture of the filling was really off-putting, and as much I wanted to move past it I couldn't. The biscuit was warm and soft. It was slightly sweet with a hint of salt. I would have preferred it to be a bit sweeter but it was good nonetheless. Now onto the chicken and waffles... I tend to order this dish at many restaurants because the combo of sweet and savory is perfect. While I really enjoyed the taste and texture of the buckwheat waffle, I really could have done without the cheddar that was on top. For me it seemed really random to have a piece of cheddar melted on top, and I ended up scrapping it off.  I would definitely order the waffle without the cheese because the waffle and the maple syrup combo is really good. The fried chicken was nicely fried and crispy. I honestly didn't not pick up the flavors of it being brined in sweet tea. The only negative for me is that the chicken is served with a sliced lemon on top. Even after removing the lemon, the citrusy flavor remained. Personally, I do not enjoy the taste of lemon in food but I'm sure this is not a deal breaker for most! All in all, I would return because I was digging the vibe, and would love to try some of their drinks. I'd also try something else off the menu!",0,0,0,Ashley M.,"Bronx, NY",56,44,18

So when booking the reservations here I mentioned that in the reservation notes. However, plans that day went differently and I forgot about that note until I was walking up to the restaurant. I was very nervous that the secret would be blown when I approached the hostess. However, professional that she was she made a subtle gesture towards the couple and I quickly shook my head ""no"". She took the hint and was able to let our server know subtly as well. I could not have been more grateful! An added issue was that we had a member of the group that is dairy free. The server chatted easily with her about how the items on the menu were made and the substitutions that could be made. I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie, which was made with flaky drop biscuits, both crispy on top and soaked in the creamy sauce. There was an abundance of chicken and veggies and I was very comforted by the whole meal!  To the staff- thank you for all of your help and for understanding!

3.0,2/6/2019,Food was GREAT but very disappointed in the service. The host accidentally sat another party who arrived 30 minutes early under our reservation and after accusing us of making a reservation for the Florida location he realized it was in fact their mistake. At that point the only open seating was at the bar and he told us a regular table wouldn't be available for another 45 minutes even though there were several open tables. He said he would talk to the manager to see if there was anything they could do for us but nothing. We really enjoyed the Restaurant Week food but the staff repeatedly came over to ask if we were finished while we were still enjoying our meal. We felt very rushed. When they brought out the dessert they also brought out the check. If felt as though they were trying to get rid of us the whole time.

This one was the best out of four and one of the best southern restaurants in general.Biscuits:Pros:- right amount of sweetness.- made fresh- the fresh thyme to top off worked perfectly well.Cons:- the jus tasted Chinese medicinal. Wasn't a big fan. Would have prefer extra honey butter.Deviled eggs:Pros:- very pretty- tastyCons:- small and left me wanting moreBeet salad:Pros:- love beets - good portion Cons:- needed salt to really pop in your mouth. Borrowed some from the biscuit plate.Fried Chicken with cheese wafflesPros:- chicken was flavorful and juicy- waffles were just the right amount of sweetness and the cheese complemented so well with its saltinessCons:- could of been more crunchy. But flavorful trumps crunch for me when it comes to fried chicken.Mac n cheese:Pros:- I love Mac n cheese and nothing was wrong with this dishCons:- noneCucumber saladPros:- crunchy and coolCons:- lacked flavor. Could of use more vinegar or saltShrimp n grits:Pros:- creamy goodness with pork bits, corn and tomatoes- rich and flavorful Cons:- the shrimp didn't taste fresh cooked.

1.0,2/3/2019,"Bad service, terrible food, and hairs in our food (I see I'm not the only reviewer to have this experience).We went here with another couple and we got deviled eggs, fried chicken, chicken pot pie with biscuits on top, roasted squash, short rib meat loaf, shrimp and grits, and collard greens. The fried chicken wasn't good, it was super dry and hard. The short rib meat loaf is literally that, it's just short ribs stuffed into a loaf pan and popped out. It's sort of like a brick of carnitas. The chicken pot pie was truly disgusting, with almost completely uncooked biscuits on top. The tops of the biscuits looked done but 3/4 of the biscuit was literally dough, gooey dough disintegrating into the rest of the dish. The ""filling"" was basically just cream, and it was more cream soup than chunks of chicken or veggies. The roasted squash wasn't fully cooked and was crispy inside, and two of us found a hair in it. The collard greens were acceptable. The shrimp and grits was the only really good thing we had that night. Even the eggs weren't very tasty. The service was awful the night we went. There was plenty of space but we got seated in a little corner next to the restroom and it was so crowded in that section that we could barely get in or out. Same for our server, so he didn't come by to refill our tiny water cups. I was so thirsty throughout the whole meal. It took forever to get someone's attention to get the check.Also, this place isn't cheap! In the end, it worked out to about $80 per person for the meal plus 1.5 drinks average per person. I don't mind paying that for good food but this place was truly disappointing and even offensive. I mean serving uncooked raw dough floating in a bowl of cream is pretty bold, and charging that much for it too.

My friend and I both ordered the waffles Benedict, biscuits to share, and deviled eggs. The deviled eggs were fine (I'm not a huge deviled egg person, but my friend is and she enjoyed them) and the biscuits were SO good. And there's a vegetarian option because the original recipe has bacon in it (I believe?), so it was great, as a vegetarian, to be able to have that option. The Benedict was great even without the ham on top, I could eat a million of those waffles every day. The side salad was a little unnecessary and I felt bad wasting so much of it, but it was still very good. We also got lavender lemonade which was super refreshing but a little weak on the lavender.

I guess the hype with the place went away over time.Maybe I waited too long to finally try this place, but I thought that all of the food was underwhelming. I tried the drunken deviled eggs, sweet tea brined fried chicken, cheddar waffles and the lavender lemonade. The presentation, plating and quickness was on point. However the food fell short of my expectations. The hint of lavender in the lemonade was very subtle. You can barely taste it in the drink. For the sweet brined fried chicken, I was able to request all dark meat with my order. It came with two thighs and two drumsticks. The drumsticks were not crispy at all. I peered into the kitchen and it looks like the fried chicken is pre-made and kept warm instead of being made to order. Also, the cheddar on the waffles didn't seem to go well with the meal. I ended up peeling off all the cheese. I am glad I was finally able to try this place but I probably won't return.",4,0,1,Connie T.,"New York, NY",281,129,308

Go for the drinks and biscuits, but probably best to contain yourself to that.  The drinks were wonderful concoctions with a good amount of alcohol that was still subtle to the taste. and the biscuits might be some of the best in the city! However, the chicken pot pie was really just more biscuits and gravy very lacking on the chicken and vegetables. It was a disappointingly unhearty meal. The short rib meatloaf was a bit better. I understand that short rib is supposed to have a crisp charred exterior with a tender inside, but are potatoes supposed to?

3.0,12/29/2018,"I had such high hopes but unfortunately Root and Bone didn't live up to them. First Sweet Chick and now Root and Bone- which place truly has the best fried chicken in the East Village? Anyways, the place itself is super cute and cozy plus the servers are hospitable. But for the price I don't think it's worth it at all- namely for the fried chicken. As a party of three, we decided to order the whole fried chicken which consisted of 8 pieces of meat (2 white and 6 dark), the buckwheat cheddar waffles, and the mac n cheese. Whole fried chicken- 2/5. I'm sorry, no, just no. I get that it's ""sweet tea brined fried chicken"" so that it wouldn't necessarily be super crunchy. However, I did expect the meat at the very least to be cooked. Long story short, the legs' meat were pink which was super off putting. If I'm paying $4/1 piece of fried chicken can it at least be cooked ""all the way""? This isn't a burger. Buckwheat Cheddar Waffles- 3/5. Slowly redeeming the awful chicken but didn't stand out in any way. No, it was not bad, but I cannot say it was great either. They also came out a little cold/cheese wasn't fully melted.Mac n cheese- 5/5. Mac n cheese to save the day! This side was reasonably priced considering it's portion size and was pretty damn good. Yes it's just mac n cheese but trust me, if you do go, get this. The biscuit herb crust was the ""cherry on top"" for me. All in all I wouldn't visit again but I can't say I strongly recommend against it.

The chicken was crispy and a huge portion. The waffle was soft and I could tell it was really fresh. The service is good and as soon as they brought out the food, they brought maple syrup and honey Tabasco (which had a great blend of sweet and savory). The Mac & cheese was great too.

I like how they give you the option of white or dark meat, but I thought the chicken breast could've been more tender and flavorful. Maybe their dark meat is better...

We made a reservation as it gets rather crowded and the space is small, although it was annoying that we had to wait ~30 mins to sit even with a reservation. We were then taken to the dining area, a very beautiful and rustic space. It's decorated with bottles, plants, and bones all over the walls and it made us feel like we were somewhere out in South Carolina. When we sat, the friendly waiter gave us options to choose from and explained what was included in the restaurant week menu. To sum it up, it was delicious deviled eggs that were perfectly seasoned with Cajun, heavenly Mac n cheese that overflowed with cheese, fried chicken with waffle for the entree (it was too oily for my taste), and my favorite - a savory rendition to the watermelon that had drizzle and jalapeños. I'm still in disbelief that a chef can create such a unique dish from watermelon! All of the dishes can be shared, so I'd say this is a great place to try family-style meals.

Made brunch reservations for a few Sundays ago (make sure you book early, as the place is pretty small and gets booked up pretty quick). As soon as you walk through the door, the smell of delicious herbs and spices guides you all the way to your seats. Service was attentive and we received our menus, waters, drinks, etc. right away. Most of the food can be shared so we ordered biscuits, whole chicken (don't worry, it comes in pieces so everyone can have a drumstick), grits, Mac and cheese, and the biscuits and gravy. Let me tell you, the food here is amazing. The biscuits are pretty flaky and come with some sort of maple butter sauce that you can drizzle or dip into. The chicken is very well seasoned with a great crunch exterior and wasn't too greasy either (though I don't think I'd complain if it was!). It was brined in ice tea and you get the perfect faintest taste when you take a bite. The Mac and cheese was perfectly cheesy with a nice firm crust - they use cavatappi which I think is the best way to make 'macaroni' and cheese. The gravy biscuits were to die for - so rich and creamy and soft! I think the grits were probably the least favorite of the table. There was lots of corn and not as much cheese; really not what you'd expect for traditional southern style grits.

3.0,11/2/2018,"Maybe I had too much expectation about the place.. I have heard that this place is popular with extremely long waits on weekends. I love chicken and waffles so I was excited to try this top chef related restaurant. The place is definitely cute and the staffs are friendly. Well decorated bar which is tiny but really pretty. The place was a bit smaller than I thought. Maybe that's why there is a long wait on weekends. However, the location is out of nowhere. It was sOOoooo far from the train stations. Anyway, the food.. hmmm.. the chickens were kind of hard to chew.. wasn't moist at all. And the chicken portion was extremely small for the price. Waffles, nothing out of ordinary. They were small and round so it's cute. Also, the watermelons that come out with chicken and waffles, were not marinated at all. I have had moist chicken and waffles with well marinated cubed watermelons at other restaurants before. Not sure if I'm coming back since it's so far.",0,0,0,Su C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,150,347
1.0,10/27/2018,"Went here tonight and was very disappointed. The chicken was undercooked and not fully breaded. I bit into the thigh piece and there was blood along the bone. It took us some time to get a server's attention to show someone this undercooked meat. The server's response was ""this is common to have some excess blood along the blood line"". His explanation doesn't make sense, since there should be no blood if you thoroughly cook chicken. His dismissive response was also concerning since someone could get very sick from eating undercooked meat.

3.0,10/24/2018,"Root & Bone had been on my list for quite some time and finally, with family visiting we decided to try it. As we were a large group we did family supper. I started with a lemonade which was great, highly recommend if you are not ordering a cocktail. We then got the biscuits, which were probably the best part of the meal. Unfortunately mine was a bit under-cooked and doughy at some parts. We also got the deviled eggs which were quite bland, they really did not taste like much. We then moved on to a seasonal salad which was fine, again, nothing spectacular and not much flavor. For dinner we got mac & cheese which was probably the second best dish of the meal, topped with breadcrumbs for some crunch, highly recommend this. We also got collard greens, which again, seemed to have an attempt at seasoning but didn't quite reach a flavor level anything more than under whelming. Finally we got the fried chicken and waffles. After visiting Sweet Chick the week before, I can say this fried chicken is nothing exciting. The seasoning is quite bland and my chicken tasted under cooked and slimy. The waffle was decent, but I wasn't sure why they added cheese to it as it tasted good without it. The best thing I had here was definitely their maple bourbon syrup, it was delicious. For dessert we had the key lime pie which I did not try, and the chocolate cake which was good, just very dense and chewy. You definitely need a glass of milk with that.

5.0,10/21/2018,"Was looking for a brunch spot in the East Village and Root & Bone* looked like the most appetizing place saved in my bookmarks. Apparently you can make a brunch reservation here, which is so rare that I didn't even check to see if that was a possibility. Upon our arrival at around 1:30 pm, we were told we could eat outside (it was freezing) or wait it out for about 30 minutes. The staff will take your phone number and text you when the table is ready, which is really the only proper way to handle waits at restaurants. As it turns out, the wait was only 17 minutes, and we spent that time watching the Eagles game** at a bar nearby. Back at R&B: We were seated on two barstools overlooking both the street and also the few patrons who opted to eat outside, which was awkward because we were staring at their food a lot. The food is very 'grammable here, as is most food nowadays, I guess.So the place was super cute and we enjoyed people watching and whatever, but the food was the obvious highlight of the experience. I ordered the fried chicken biscuits, which was served with pepper jelly, a few chips (in the biscuit--weird) and pickled veggies (pretty; served on the side). Yeah, this was so good it was kinda nuts. The biscuits were about as fluffy as biscuits could be, and also salt-crusted and crunchy on top. The white-meat chicken was so tender, which is so hard to do. [Nobody wants to eat dry chicken, but it happens sometimes.] The pepper jelly was sweet, tangy, and savory. And the pickled veggies added an eye-popping jolt of flavor. There was obviously a lot going on in this dish, but it was all done with so much care that nothing got lost in the shuffle.We also tried the shrimp n grits (melted tomato pickled onion, corn, and bacon beer jus), which is seemingly the thing people get here when they don't get the fried chicken. Unsurprisingly, this is a heavy, buttery dish, that is not too complex but nevertheless delicious. The pickled onions add an exciting, unexpected element, and who doesn't love corn? I could only taste a hint of smoke from the bacon jus.The one unfortunate aspect of the meal was that they were out of basically every coffee drink on the menu except drip coffee. I ordered that, and it was on the weaker side, though served in an attractive green mug. Also, no Splenda. I love Splenda and am going to start a one-women Yelp crusade to get restaurants to serve Splenda everywhere.*Actual name of this restaurant. My boyfriend kept calling it ""Rag and Muffin"". What?

I felt pretty ""eh"" through the whole thing.*** FOOD ***We had the mac and cheese to start, and then pork chops and short ribs as our mains. For a restaurant labeled as a cuisine associated with shameless mountains of butter put into its meals, it produced a mac and cheese that was hurtfully average. The pork chops and short ribs were also pretty average for this price point. Definitely was disappointed with the mediocrity and lack of innovation around these dishes.

My craving for this cuisine is always high up there, and so when I try out a new (to me at least) restaurant, maybe I set my expectations in a weird spot.Anyway, I was left underwhelmed by Root & Bone. There was apparently all sorts of hype surrounding this place that I was unaware of, and after having gone without that in mind, I still left (and the group with me) feeling a bit let down.Service was fine, everyone was friendly and attentive, at least until we had to wait for a while to ask for the check with empty plates.Beyond that, the food was the main problem. Things just didn't taste good, portions were odd, and items didn't seem to match their sides in terms of flavor or texture.I had the pulled pork and it was just not good. Bun was dry, pork was chewy, and really nothing about the dish was enjoyable. It seems that most meals we tried resulted in the same feeling of ""what did I just eat?"" From the grits to the desserts. Dessert was particularly mediocre.Ultimately, it appears that the fried chicken sandwich is the thing people go for, and we all intentionally skipped it.

Came for lunch on a weekday around 1:30 and it was pretty much empty - conversely if you come for dinner on a Friday or Saturday without a reservation you'll end up waiting all night. Started with the deviled eggs and Macaroni & cheese. Deviled eggs were good, but not super special. Didn't taste like there was much added to the egg yolk mix other than mayo. The Mac and cheese was a better starter but the noodles were a little overcooked. For mains we got the fried chicken biscuits (a little overbattered, not that crispy) and short rib meatloaf. The mealoaf was more like shredded beef pressed into squares vs a real meatloaf. Was a little dry for my liking and didn't carry any real oomph. Ended with the key lime pie which was not good - sickly sweet and hard to finish. Overall not a terrible place but not worth the $, hype or wait if you come at a busy time.

I looked around and just shrugged it off and we sat at the bar. There also wasn't anyone else waiting to be seated..just us.We immediately got water, and some menus to look at as well. The bar looks directly into the kitchen, and it just wasn't really comfortable to sit there.We got some drinks..bf got a beer and I got:Julia Sugarbaker $13-bourbon, preserved peach, fresh lemon, and lavender amaro-It was good and refreshing.Shortly after we received our drinks, we saw a table leave and there was actually another table available. Bf waved down a waiter and asked if we could sit at a table and it was no problem at all.

However, our entrees were terrific. My partner had the chicken and 3, and had mac and cheese, watermelon, and the waffles with the bourbon maple syrup (I almost fought him over that side). He said the chicken had a great batter but that the meat was a touch dry. He also ordered a side of grits, and I almost fought with him over those as well -- the pimento cheese topping was a surprise and a huge hit. I had the toasted tomato sandwich with applewood bacon; even though I'm not a big tomato fan, the sandwich sounded delicious, and it was -- big slices of heirloom tomatoes on grilled sourdough bread with aioli.

3.0,9/4/2018,"I decided to come here during RW to see what all the fuss and hype was about. I'll just say that Root & Bone has a phenomenal lunch/brunch deal that was too amazing to pass up. They truly supply you with more food than you can possibly eat in one sitting. The waitress I had was great, her service being appropriate and pretty much timely.In regards to southern cuisine? I felt as though I was having extremely healthy, gentrified, vegan-esque southern eats. Let me explain. Having gone to school in the South, southern cooking is a blessing and a curse from the gods. This is a type of cuisine that you treat yourself to seldom. Southern cuisine shouldn't be consumed on a daily, nor weekly basis. Else you won't be able to fit yourself through a standard doorway and you'll have extensively clogged arteries. That being said, southern cooking and its ingredients should never be skimped on. I want my food to taste amazing with all the pickings and adornments. I want some grease, some lard (unfortunately it comes with the territory) along with all the meat, cheese, and sugar that I personally can bear.Root and bone is alright, but I feel they skimped on the 'soul food' component of their cuisine.  The waffles and chicken were the best thing I had out of everything present. The mac and cheese was 'meh', it was more loose and crumby than cheesy and flavorful. The key lime pie was way too sweet.

Their key lime pie was the sweetest thing I've ever had in my life. Had one bite. Their buttercream cupcake looked mediocre and then tasted exactly how it appeared. Also had one bite.Fried chicken was not crispy whatsoever. Chicken skin was thin and soggy.The braised beef was actually not too bad because the browned outer portion was slightly crispy. My friend thought it was a bit dry. Fried oysters: Was crispy unlike their fried chicken.Mac & cheese and biscuits were alright. I've had better. Deviled eggs were actually the best thing I had all night.I feel bad for writing this review, but my wallet also feels bad because their food was not cheap. Not worth it. Not coming back.

4.0,8/6/2018,"Solid Southern comfort food with friendly service and YES - BRUNCH RESERVATIONS.  I always get either the chicken & three with seasoned fried chicken, waffle, and mac & cheese or the meatloaf with fried eggs and potatoes.  The chicken is crispy and juicy and pairs well with the syrup and buckwheat waffle - without the syrup it can be slightly on the salty side.  I would also add some butter to the waffle as it is made from buckwheat so offers less of the traditional butter waffle taste.  It also comes with a side of watermelon which adds a splash of freshness to an otherwise relatively heavy dish.  The meatloaf is also nicely seasoned and juicy - and a very welcome change from the standard steak frites.  Be sure to get a basket of the buttery biscuits with honeyed gravy to start - because it's not Southern fare without biscuits - and these are pretty good.  Definitely worth a visit for brunch if you are craving comfort food.  I also noticed that many of the items can be prepared gluten-free which is definitely a plus, especially for brunch.",2,1,3,Danan R.,"New York, NY",924,1915,85

The drunken deviled eggs were nothing to rave about as it lacked flavor. The only thing that saved it was the taro chip. Mac and cheese was a bit on the bland side and only a few bites were taken. We were not a fan of the cheese on the waffles and why didn't our server tell us our order of the bird came with waffles? If we knew, we wouldn't have ordered waffles!

3.0,7/30/2018,"Root & Bone is good Southern food, but nothing there is standout. I came here for a Thursday night dinner, and left disappointed. While it's a very cute, cozy place, the service was terrible. It took the waitress 30 minutes to come take our order, and she was very brusque during the entirety of our meal. My friend and I split the side order of macaroni, she ordered the risotto, and I ordered the shrimp and grits. I want to preface by saying the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. While Root & Bone is one that prides itself on making simple ingredients taste great, I thought everything was underwhelming. The macaroni was fine, but it wasn't anything special. While it was pretty to look at and photograph, it was under-seasoned and was nothing out of the ordinary. The shrimp and grits were better. The grits were super creamy and full of flavor. However, several of my shrimp hadn't been deveined, which was definitely an unpleasant surprise.If there were half stars allowed, I would give Root & Bone 3.5 stars.

I guess we came here during restaurant week bc they had a deal for a few courses in their menu for $42/pp. It came with biscuits and Mac and cheese for us to share, a choice of a small dish, choice of main, and choice of dessert.

It was just so tasty and crisp, filling yet light)- braised short rib 'meatloaf' (not this was interesting. It was my least favorite dish but that doesn't mean it wasn't good! The sauce was ok, I like how crunchy the carrots were and overall it was nice to try)- sweet tea brined fried chicken & cheddar waffles, which came with some chilled watermelon - so sweet and watery. Oh and the honey tobacco sauce with the chicken and the special syrup with the waffles elevated the dish from an A to an A+ - Mac & cheese (need I say more? Perfect amount of cheesiness and I liked how they cooked the pasta, kind of el dente - not mushy at all)- shrimp & grits (oh. my. gosh. The grits were so creamy and the gravy had awesome flavor. The shrimp were cooked for perfection and my only regret is that I was too full to eat more of it)- Banana pudding and a banana pecan pineapple cupcake (I'm not the hugest dessert fan but these were good.

I highly recommend coming on a nice day / evening!Fried chicken. Waffles. Mac n cheese. The whole fried chicken ($36) comes with plenty of crisply fried and tender chicken wings that'll put you in a food coma after... I split this with one other person and thought it was a bit too much on top of the sides. We finished it, but I highly recommend ~coming hungry~. Order the wings with the waffles (+$7) which come with cheese on top and make sure to drench them in their syrup. It's like make your own chicken and waffles. The meal isn't complete without the side of mac n cheese in a hot skillet. Seriously delicious. I tried the raspberry sour beer, perfect for a summer evening.

I mean the sweet tea that makes you question whether you will wake up Overdosing from the southern sweetness. Overall, I cannot get over how the food is true southern. The southern style that will put me on Coney Island on a snowy day playing a Darius Rucker and Luke Bryan on my guitar.

5.0,6/29/2018,"I've long been skeptical about both brunch and Southern food in NYC, so it was a surprising turn of events for me to both seek out Root & Bone a few Sundays ago and absolutely love it. It's exactly the bougie, boozy fried chicken place I feared it would be, but it does it so well.Our party of two showed up around noon without reservations and were told there would be about a ten minute wait for bar seats. We took a walk around the block and it was ready soon after we came back. Our bar seats ended up being cozily tucked up against a photogenic bar well stocked with whiskey and mason jars and anchored by antler-topped beer taps.You're here for the fried chicken, which comes in plenty of combinations or can be added on to other offerings, but there was a reasonably varied list of Southern-tinged alternatives, like cheddar buckwheat waffles, shrimp and grits, and rhubarb-strawberry salad. There are smaller plates and sides under $10; larger dishes will run you $15 and up. They have gluten-free options available, vegetarians can eat decently here, and everything looks pretty nut-allergen friendly as well.Between the two of us, we had heirloom tomato toast ($14) and half sweet tea brined fried chicken ($19). The former was tasty, with juicy, flavorful tomatoes stuck to crispy toast with a nice homemade aioli. The pickled ramps were a pleasant surprise.The fried chicken deserves its own paragraph. It's served piping hot, with a crackly but not too assertive skin and super-tender insides, and not too heavy at all. The lemon dusting is positively addictive. Just a good bird all around. Would happily get it again even at this inflated price.Service was excellent, and the meal relatively quick at 45 minutes. Decor and atmosphere make even a casual lunch feel celebratory. No booze for us, though they have a nice selection of classic cocktails and brunch drinks, as well as beer, cider, and kombucha. My boyfriend's cappuccino ($5ish) was stellar.Assuming you're comfortable spending $25ish a person for brunch after tax and tip, without drinks, you'll be happy here.

When it hit 5pm, all she did was make eye contact with my boyfriend and did not come out to seat us until another party came and asked to be seated. The server who took our order was kind. We got the half fried chicken with cheddar waffles and mac n cheese. The fried chicken is definitely better than any I have tasted, but the waffles and Mac n cheese were mediocre, nothing special, especially the waffles. For a place that is known for their chicken and waffles, I would expect at least some taste to it, but nope, not in this case. The cheddar waffles were bland and tasteless. The server who I asked for the check and takeout box was nasty. She rolled her eyes and walked away. I said thank you when she handed me the boxes, when she came back with the check, when I handed her my card with the check, and after she gave me my card and check back. She did not bother to acknowledge me during any of those four rounds where came back to by table in under a 5 minute span, but simply said ""ok"" while taking our cups away after she handed me back my card and bill.I do not care how good your fried chicken taste, if you can not provide at least a half decent service.

2.0,5/20/2018,"In one word- underwhelming.Came here for brunch on Sunday and ordered:-Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits (MUST HAVE, these were amazing!!!)-Sweet Tea Brined Fried Chicken (half)-Buckwheat waffles with cheese-Mac and cheese-Cheesy gritsThe biscuits were hands down the best part of the meal- highly recommend these!!! These set the bar very high, and unfortunately the rest of the meal fell far, far below. The chicken was crispy on the outside, but very dry on the inside- there was nothing special about the flavor of this ""Sweet Tea Brined"" fried chicken, as the tabasco and whisky syrup came on the side anyways. The waffles were dense and very heavy, and didn't complement the chicken very well. Mac and cheese looked mouthwatering, but didn't deliver much flavor. The melted cheese used to top this and the waffles was literally like plastic- I peeled it off in one piece. The grits were well made, just lacked flavor.

We were seated within 10 minutes when I arrived. As i was waiting I was tempted by the dessert counter where they had cookies, pies, and banana pudding in a jar.Once we were seated, we scanned the menu and saw the quintessential Southern favorites like fried chicken and biscuits. They have a variety of these dishes with different combos of sides. We both ordered the fried chicken platter with waffles, mac and cheese, and collard greens. It is a lot of food for an average sized Asian girl but I liked how I got to sample a bunch of different items through that dish. The mac and cheese was good but think it would have been better with some Sharp cheddar. The waffles were multigrain, but still fluffy and yummy. The chicken was the highlight of the dish. The skin was seasoned with lemon and some other spices that made it irresistible. The one thing I didn't like were the collard greens.

When we called to check on the wait she so rudely informed us that there was a differentiation between the wait list and a reservation list. When we finally showed up for our ""wait list"" reservation we were greeted with less than welcoming behavior. The wait staff acted as if they were doing us a favor to have us eat at a mediocre fried chicken joint. When we got seated they seated us at the bar next to the door on a colder Saturday in New York City so I asked our waiter, who in fact never checked on us during our meal, if we could move to a table.

Firstly I love the vibe here- so quaint and southern and homey but still city chic. Very into the decor... the mix matched plates and the variety of glass bottles and mason jars for beverages really give me all the feels. The food also gives me the feel- great spot for COMFORT food- this is not the place to go while on a diet (unless you're looking to break your diet of course). Every time I've come her I try something new. Last time I had the shrimp and grits (it was to die for- seriously so perfect). The biscuit starter or the waffles and cheese starter- A*. I love their no alcohol beverages... very refreshing I usually go for whatever funky lemonade they have it's not too sweet. This time I was in a breakfasty mood so I got one of the classics... fried chicken with waffles, Mac and cheese, collard greens, and a side of over easy eggs. My friend and I rolled out of there as you can imagine... I also had a cold brew. My friend got the Mr. Q with fried chicken. If you can't tell the fried chicken is certainly a must... they also have these infused side sauces that are everything- whiskey infused honey and Tabasco infused honey... it's amazing on the chicken... actually amazing on everything there.

We started off with some ciders while tying to figure out what we wanted, which was everything!  Everything sounded so good and by chance you can order what they call Family Supper.  It comes family style and it's essentially a taste of all the staples on the menu.  Soon the seasonal salad came out alone with some deviled eggs and the amazing biscuits and gravy.  We quickly devoured that and were in heaven. Everything was perfect. Then came the fried chicken, buttermilk cheese waffles, collard AND Mac and cheese.  We definitely ate with our eyes and not our stomachs as this turned out to be quite the meal!  We almost finished it all though!  Normally I'm not a Mac and cheese guy but this was nice and gooey and crispy on top.  The waffles went perfect with the absolutely stunning fried chicken. I've been thinking about it since. The collards, well, we aren't huge fans of collards but the little I had did taste good.  All in all it was a great experience, a little tight on the restaurant but hey, it's New York City.  For the price and quantity of food and quality of service.  This will be repeated.",0,0,0,Phillip T.,"New Bedford, MA",48,85,87

The food was okay.  Nothing to write home about if you've had actual comfort food and fried chicken in the south/ southwest.My experience was ruined completely though by a female chef/manager with brown hair.  She was seemingly the head chef.   It was extremely uncomfortable seeing the way she treated her staff and rushed around the small kitchen yelling at co-workers.  You can see directly into the kitchen upon walking into the restaurant basically and hear everything that is going on.  You could tell the kitchen staff seemed used to this kind of abusive treatment as they avoided eye contact with her and tried to keep it together. Its always disgusting to see someone be so disrespectful to others.    I worked in restaurants as a teen and a young adult so I know what its like to work for a nightmare chef on a huge power trip. Overall experience was fine when the head chef/manager wasn't around.  All other employees were great and very nice.  My advice to this establishment would be to get rid of the tyrant or explain to her that she's running a farm to table fried chicken restaurant in the east village.  An overdone + overpriced thematic restaurant trend that, while serving okay food, does not warrant the gross attitude of an egotistical manager/chef.  Calm down.",2,1,0,Darl D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0

I like the pickle the best--sweet and sour.  The onion and red pepper strips are sweet and tasty as well. The biscuit has a honey glaze on top.  It is good.The chicken to me is so so.  Light coating and not oily, but lacked taste.  I think we are supposed to use the sauce they provide.  A mustard sauce and a sweet and sour sauce.  The chicken is the frozen variety that most Americans only have access to.  Well, I can tell you as a fact...the chickens that are processed the same day and never frozen are the best.  They are juicier and softer to bite into.  We have that in LA Chinese area.  There are shops with chickens that are just processed before minutes of the sale.  The local Chinese restaurants serve these chickens, and this makes a huge difference.  You have to taste it for yourself.  No word can reproduce the experience.The service was very good, and there is a bonus star for this place.  Their sugar cookies have sprinkles and grind almonds.  I can not taste the almond, but this is one of the best sugar cookie that I have in my life, so that is a plus for the establishment.All in all, not a bad place, but it is simply over hype and over price for what they offer.",5,3,3,Ray L.,"Irvine, CA",248,513,961

The wait staff are extremely friendly and attentive, and the menu has all the southern classics from Fried Chicken (i'll get to this later), Meat Loaf, Shrimp & Grits to your classic sides of Mac & Cheese, Collard Greens and Stone Ground Grits. As I say, coming here after my brunch experience I was fully expecting a 'meh' kind of dinner; however, walking in with a friend for a long overdue catch up, the food and the setting was the perfect place.We got the Whole Fried Chicken between the two of us, with Mac & Cheese and Collard Greens (and also a Grits on the house, due to them originally bringing us the wrong side - can't complain there!). First off, I need to dedicate a whole paragraph to this delicious bird we got...The Fried Chicken is legit some of the best fried chicken I have ever had. Fried chicken usually leaves me in a grease fulled coma and sitting on the toilet shortly after...This fried chicken made me feel rich, it made me feel authentic, it made me feel gooood. It's lemon dusted and Sweet Tea Brined, and is served with an incredible honey tobasco sauce. It's plump, it's juicy, and it's crisp to the bite, accompanied with some serious blend of flavors with the sweetness of the tea, and the sour of the lemon, to the salt of the bird.The Mac & Cheese was creamy, with a crispy topping, and came in a huge cast iron skillet - this guy was a serious side. The grits & collard greens were also tasty, with chunks of ham hock and a slight bitterness.For two people, in all honesty, this was too much food. I'm a big eater and I was struggling by the end of it. My advice to you would be to prioritize the chicken, and definitely split a whole bird between 2. You can then more than easily split a single side.Boycott Brunch, Treat Yo'Self to Dinner!",2,1,1,Peter C.,"Brooklyn, NY",44,111,110
2.0,3/29/2018,"I have came here several times over the years. But my recent trip here has been disappointing. We ordered a half chicken. The batter was off and it just wasn't as crunchy as I remembered it. Also, the bird was huge (so it felt like it was a drugged up GM chicken), and the meat was bland. I won't come here again for a while, as there are just better alternatives for fried chicken in the city.",1,0,0,Patrick N.,"New York, NY",321,252,846

Table seating in the back is a bit tight, so you can't have a private conversation and eating space is limited. MUST order the friend chicken. Wish it could've been more crispy, same goes for the waffles.. but they were delicious in taste. Also ordered the Mac and cheese, which were nice and cheesy. Not dry at all. If you have room, order the biscuits.. they serve it with some honey that makes it all just melt in your mouth! Wasn't too impressed with the drinks, But they were heavy on the pour which is always a great thing. PS* make reservations.

5.0,3/21/2018,"This is my favorite fried chicken joint in all of NYC. I've been to sweet chick and pies n thighs but nothing compared to Root & Bone. I stumbled upon this place since I was in charge of planning the company lunch. If you're picky about price points and portion sizes, this isn't the place for you. The flavors and experience I got from the food far outweigh the costs. I always start off with the Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits and Drunken Deviled Eggs. I'm usually not a fan of Deviled Eggs but I always make an exception when I'm eating here. We usually get the Crispy Fried Bucket of Whole Bird. I wished they gave more pieces but my god, its mouth watering good. It's just out of this world. We also usually top off the meal with obviously the Macaroni & Cheese and since my friend Joe loves bacon, the Pork Belly Bacon. All of the items I usually get are the heavy-hitters.

4.0,3/17/2018,"Decent food, a little overpriced for what you can find elsewhere for lesser. We had the prix fixe menu for roughly $80/pp. It came with four courses. Their biscuits are the best I've ever had. They're warm, dense, and fluffy. They come with a jus that you dip the biscuits in, and herbs on the side. I'd come back here just for their biscuits! My second course was a salad - it was forgettable. It was garnished with pickled onions and bleu cheese. Flavors were intricate - but not cohesive. We shared a baked mac and cheese. This and the biscuits were the best aspects of the meal. The mac and cheese was gooey, flavorful, and hot. It was garnished with breadcrumbs. Added the perfect amount of crunch for variation in texture. My third course was chicken and waffles. The chicken desperately needed seasoning. The waffles were dry - they came with cheddar cheese on them and were garnished with scallions. Great concept, but not executed to its fullest potential. The waffles needed a sweet(er) element. If you've had chicken and waffles before, no need to order them here. They're nothing special. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp and grits. The grits were accompanied by corn (traditional); they were flavorful but undercooked, so a little gritty. It came with large shrimp, which was nice. But, again, the shrimp were under and needed seasoning. When I come to a ""Southern"" restaurant, I expect the flavors to be more developed. The last course - dessert - was a blueberry cobbler that was served in a small cast iron with vanilla ice cream. Perfect ending to a dinner. Very delectable, but not too sweet. Our server was also not the most personable. It seemed as if she wanted to take our orders, but not give suggestions about their food.

5.0,3/12/2018,"Root and Bone has been on my list for a couple of years now, pretty much from when it opened. When Gilt City offered a deal a couple of months ago, I had to pull the trigger. The scene here is pretty cool. It's some kind of mix of modern industrial look with white painted brick walls and rich wood shelves and bars all over. The space is a little tight with bar seating all over and adjacent to all of the tables, and on a Monday night, there wasn't an open seat in the house and a pack of people waiting at the entrance for a seat to open. You'll want / need a reservation here. The Gilt City deal was an insanely good value for an obscenely large amount of food. The Gilt City deal left me with a lot of food guilt, with the amount we got. Drunken Deviled Eggs - loved these. There was something a little pickley, a little dilly, and a lot eggy. Just a really well executed dish here. Gem Salad - I'll say something I don't often say. This is an awesome salad. There. I said it. The combination of the sweet corn and the pickled onions and the creamy ricotta and the garlic vinaigrette really just all combine for one awesome salad. Angel Biscuits - fantastically executed biscuits. Moist, flaky, sweet, salty, and buttery. They are great on their own, but the chicken honey jus added an extra dimension that's both sweet and savory, much like the biscuit itself. Fried Chicken and Cheddar Waffles - a half order of chicken here is a lot of clucking chicken. The birds are pressure fried and come out perfectly crispy and juicy and tender. The waffles were a solid pairing with the chicken, but not quite as memorable as the chicken itself, and just as filling. Mac and Cheese - creamy and cheesy macaroni. It's another well executed version of the American classic. Collared Greens - well balanced dish with tender bites of savory ham cut with the apple cider vinegar. Nice dish. Short Rib ""Meatloaf"" - this was the one miss of the night for me. I love the creativity of this dish, taking short ribs, shredding them and forming them into a loaf. In the literal sense, it is certainly a loaf of meat, but I feel like they would have been better off just serving short ribs. Shrimp and Grits - creamy, lightly cheesy grits, speckled with corn kernels, pickled onions, and plump shrimp. This dish is exactly what you want it to be. Chocolate Pudding and Key Lime Pie - if chocolate pudding snack packs and a chocolate mouse had a baby, this chocolate pudding would be that baby. The key lime pie in a mini mason jar is tangy and delicious with a crunchy graham cracker crust at the bottom. So overall, I was really surprised with how much I enjoyed nearly every aspect of this meal. My suggestions? Go with the deviled eggs, gem salad, fried chicken (sans waffles), biscuits, maybe shrimp and grits if you have a larger appetite, and maybe just one side. All of this food is excellent, but god damn is this some stick to your ribs cooking. Resist the urge to overindulge. You'll enjoy the meal more if you aren't stuffed silly.",2,0,1,Dave F.,"Hoboken, NJ",429,633,1392

They did take and honor our reservation even though I was late coming from work. I was a little disappointed the hostess wanted no part of me charging my phone in the restaurant. I cant blame someone for my own dis-organization. On to the important stuff, the food was phenomenal all around.  Starting with the ""Kilt"" salad, which seemed to be loaded with antioxidants and other ingredients that were used instead of iodized (table) salt to provide flavor. The Little Gem salad on the table next to me looked amazing. After a deal to share the Brisket Meatloff and Shrimp & Grits fell through, I was forced and fortunate enough to try the Fried Chicken. It wouldn't be fair to write a review of this spot without doing so. The chicken is perfectly breaded, cooked and seasoned. My Dad confirmed that it was the way Southern Fried Chicken is supposed to be. The shrimp & grits was loaded with seafood, bacon and taste. The Cauliflower Risotto was right on, I enjoyed the peas and carrots in there. This dish is Gluten Free and Vegan approved. The drink menu is interesting (dandelion root and chamomile flower) and appearance of the cocktails looks proper. Most of the glowing reviews are of the brunch, and I could see why.

The fried chicken was perfectly seasoned, with a smattering of Cajun flavors seeped into the crispy skin. My only complaint was that it was a tad dry. The waffles were a good complement, but not mind blowing on their own. I really enjoyed the syrup though - there was a hint of bourbon that added a delicious twist.

I saw a deal on Gilt for a 5-course meal for 2 and figured now was as good as a time as any. The place is so cute. I love the ambiance. It is small, so I do recommend a reservation if you're planning to go. We had reservations for 8:30pm and arrived early. They were very accommodating and seated us almost immediately. There was no need to order from the menu for this 5-course meal. All of the meals were predetermined. We were pretty excited. I must say, 5-courses sounded like a lot but it's way more than I even expected! I feel like we got to sample a majority of the menu. We shared drunken deviled eggs, little gem salad, and angel biscuits. Those were courses 1 & 2. We were then brought a basket of fried chicken and waffles along with Mac n cheese and collard greens. THE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES WERE OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!! The chicken was so tasty and juicy. It was amongst the best I've ever had. Even the tobacco sauce was good. I don't usually apply hot sauce but it was so tasty to dab. I put a bit of syrup on the cheddar waffles. It was delicious! I had my reservations about cheddar waffles, I didn't think I'd like the addition of cheese...ummm...WRONG. Perfection. That was course 3. Course 4 - I must start off by saying after the chicken, we were full and thought we were done. I guess I miscounted. Shrimp and grits. My husband is allergic to shrimp and they were kind enough to serve the shrimp separately (so I could eat it!! Yum) I've had grits twice before and never this delicious, especially with the shrimp. We were also given small pieces of the meatloaf and what looked like a loaded baked potato. I was full and still had to nibble because it was so tasty. We got some of this to go. I'm still looking forward to the leftovers!!For desert we got the key lime pie and maple creme brûlée. Both are served in small jars. They were great of course! Key lime pie was really sweet, but key lime pie is always sweet. I really liked my creme brûlée. The maple crumble was such a great addition. I love this place!

They were still offering the restaurant week deal and it was a great deal. For $29 we received moist biscuits that were more like a corn bread consistency. The deviled eggs were good with these (a lil salty for me). Then we got 2 pieces of fried chicken and waffles and Mac and cheese to share. The food was sooo delicious.Chicken was perfect (have option of dark or light meat). PerfectMatch with miniature waffles with cheese.I had the peach vodka iced tea was sooooo good.We had the chocolate pudding which I think was supposed to be warm but eh it was fine. Nice and thick.

3.0,2/9/2018,Visited Root & Bone for the last day of restaurant week for Lunch. The best item on the menu were the biscuits. Was not a fan of the Mac n Cheese or the chicken and waffles.

5.0,2/9/2018,"In continuing my search for NYC's best biscuit, I checked out Root & Bone for brunch:Root & Bone is located in Alphabet City and is the flagship restaurant of Top Chef alums, Jeff McInnis (season 5) and Janine Booth (Season 11). Drawing on the style of cuisine that garnered McInnis multiple James Beard nominations while at the helm of Yardbird Southern Table in Miami, Root & Bone showcases classic, elevated Southern food in a relaxed environment.The biscuits were stellar -- light, flaky and delicious. Root & Bone serves their version with roasted chicken jus, sea salt and benne (a relative of the sesame seed, brought to the US from Africa in the 18th century) seeds. I tend to enjoy sweet spreads on my biscuit like jam or honey, but there was something simply mouthwatering about dunking it in meat gravy and sprinkling a whisper of sea salt on top.I also tried the chicken and waffle sandwich with pickles, pickled green tomatoes and melted cheddar. The waffle was crisp with a fluffy interior and the pickled elements gave the sandwich a tanginess that you don't usually get with the standard chicken and waffle that comes with syrup.For the final act, I ordered the lattice apple pie, which was served with vanilla ice cream. It was a good rendition -- flaky crust, tart apples and the vanilla ice cream was particular smooth. It was a great end to a pretty fantastic meal.",0,0,0,Tiffany L.,"New York, NY",63,88,32
2.0,2/8/2018,"Heard such magnificent reviews of Root & Bone, had to try it. I love fried chicken, but haven't had ANY as good as Popeye's, ever. Before I talk about the food, I want to say that the people that work there are very very wonderful, warm, helpful, humane. We came in with a starving friend who just got out of the hospital, and he needed to lay down, right after appetizers, and they let him relax on the banquette. (Of course, it was off hours, and the place was not full, but still....) We did the ($29) brunch, enjoyed the complimentary biscuits, which were tasty, though served with a liquid that we couldn't identify. Maybe it was gravy? Nah, too thin, and cold? Appetizer time: consisted of several choices, mostly we had the deviled eggs, which were very good, and very tiny. I don't think they were quail eggs, but clearly close. Main Course: the chicken and waffles. Dark or white? I took the dark, worrying that if I had chosen the breast, it would be overcooked. Bingo! My husband had the white meat, and it was overcooked, dry, and this was the first time I have ever had over fried dark meat. In fact, since the chicken was so overcooked, the outside breading didn't have any flavor. Still, it was nice that they gave us a choice. Waffles were tasty, didn't need the cheese on them. The only plate that came out nice and hot was the macaroni and cheese. It might have been really good, except the ""crumbs"" on top were extremely salty, and really put a damper on it all. By this time, our convalescing friend, was dying to leave. We asked if we could have the dessert ""to go"" and they sweetly put 3 key lime pies in a bag, and my husband went to get the car. We barely made it back to our place, where our friend, took a 3 hour nap in our bedroom.I may try Root & Bone again someday. The place is small, and most of the time I use a walker. There isn't much room for a walker, and though I didn't use the bathroom, I wonder whether it is accessible for someone like me. BTW the key lime pies, eaten much much later were pleasingly tart, but a little over the top sweet.",1,0,0,Laurie S.,"New York, NY",0,14,0

2.0,2/3/2018,"I spend a lot of time down South & my friend was raised by a Southern mom so we were excited to try this place.Finally went last night for ""Restaurant Week."" It is upscale shaggy chic with tables that are very close to each other - no private conversations here! They have a huge selection of whiskey & bourbon including small batch & high end brands that are not found every day. I enjoyed a Hibiki although at $18, the pour was a bit meager. The service was warm & efficient. Now, the food. The two, very small biscuits brought to the table were delicious. My friend had the drunken deviled eggs which were very pretty & she enjoyed. I had the gem salad which I didn't care for. There is no ricotta to speak of, no real dressing, lettuce was too big - just didn't work for me and I didn't eat it. We both had the shrimp & grits which was overwhelmed by large rings of red onion. They just threw the aroma of the dish off in an unpleasant way. There were four small shrimp which were enough for us but those with a larger appetite may not agree. Usually, this dish is made with Tasso or bacon. If either were on the plate, their flavors didn't come through. The entire dish was bland & in need of seasoning. It was also served lukewarm which turned me off. The table is also brought Mac & Cheese - one of my favorite foods of all time! Unfortunately, this was dry and lacked the punch of cheesy deliciousness I expected. The biscuit crumb on top added nothing. Finally, the dessert - usually my favorite part! We had the key lime ""pie"" & chocolate pudding. Both are served in small glass jars and neither were special. In fact, the key lime pudding was way too sweet & went uneaten & the chocolate pudding tasted like it came from a box. There was a small, tasteless marshmallow on top and two oddly tasting animal crackers. A definite miss especially when compared to the chocolate budino I enjoyed at Leuca last week. Overall, lovely atmosphere, excellent server, great alcohol selections but very disappointing, pricey food.",0,0,0,Maria G.,"Manhattan, NY",1,83,35

For the table were the best biscuits, delicious. The green salad was strange, with a bit green sauce that was a bit spicy (!!?). Deviled eggs were fine but very tiny , guess there's perfectly fine for an appetizer. Desserts were too sweet for us but ok if you like sweets. Also table were too small to fit all the food plates.

4.0,1/28/2018,"Root + Bone has been on my list for awhile, so I was excited when my boyfriend and happened to be in the area and had the opportunity to eat dinner here. Root + Bone is a tiny restaurant so if you're planning on going on the weekend, I would make a reservation. It's also probably not a great place to bring a large party. But since we were there on a Thursday night, we were seated right away. The decor and ambiance is adorable, and certainly where the place shines. The tables were all set with cute mismatched plates and candles, and there were bird cages hanging from the ceiling. There was a pretty loud crowd seated next to us, so it was hard for me to tell if the place would have been loud if they weren't there. As for the food we ate, I had the Bucket of Bird and he had the Carolina Spare Ribs. The fried chicken was easily the best fried chicken I've ever had. The meat itself was was super juicy, but what made the chicken truly outstanding was the lemon dusted, spiked tabasco honey coating. I think a lot of times, a menu item will say that that something is marinated or coated in something, and when it comes, those flavors have been cooked off or don't come through at all. This was not the case with this chicken! The coating was really something special and definitely my favorite part of my experience at Root + Bone. (It was also crispy which I was excited about. Sometimes, I think fried chicken comes out and the batter isn't crispy anymore. That's always disappointing.) Next time, I would probably split the Bucket of Bird with whoever I was with and get a few sides. I got the half bird and it was a lot of meat for one person, with nothing else on the side. My boyfriend, knowing I would be writing this review, said to say that his ribs were ""mediocre, maybe three stars."" He also thought they should have provided more napkins or wet naps with the ribs since they got messy and are impossible to eat without using your hands. All in all, I am very happy I ate here, but I originally didn't anticipate coming back soon since I had just tried their famous fried chicken. Root + Bone has been on me and my friend's Restaurant Week radar for a while. After eating here a few weeks ago, I was confused by what kinds of options they would offer since their regular menu is a little limited. However, I just took a look at their current restaurant week menu, and I think it's probably a great deal! Looks like you get to try a bunch of different things that are all included in one price (instead of getting a half of a Bucket of Bird and then some sides, since those could add up).",0,0,0,Victoria A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,37,42

But I realize not all southern food is prepared the same. The fried chicken was too sweet, collard greens had too much vinegar and were cut in too large of pieces and waffles were over cooked.

We got the chicken biscuits (sticky but so good), deviled eggs (truly an amuse bouche, bit expensive for 3 egg halves), the mac n cheese, and the key lime pie with two cocktails. Deviled eggs were decadent so I don't regret getting them, the true star of this meal was the mac n cheese. It came with buttery biscuit crumbs and scallions on top, gooey but also SO creamy. A heavenly texture experience, found myself closing my eyes while I chewed, heh. I loved that they brought hot sauce (maybe a honey hot sauce?) to the table, I covered most of the food with it! Key lime was cute because it was a mini and only $5, but a bit too sweet. Cocktails were great in that they were not very sugary, something I am really sick of in my recent bar outings. I'd say overall a little pricey, but to be expected. Quality made it worth it. I would probably avoid getting alcohol here again, $13 cocktail wasn't worth it for me but it looked like they have a pretty extensive whiskey collection, if you are into that.",0,0,0,Samantha R.,"New York, NY",36,72,2

You haven't lived until you have tried their mac & cheese waffle, it's perfectly cooked on the outside and warm and cheesy on the inside.  Their biscuits are magnificent as well. We also order the little blueberry cheesecake and key lime pie, both very rich in taste. They were both so sweet they could give you a cavity on their own, but well worth it.

3.0,1/16/2018,"Always like the food but I do find the service a bit off. Called today @ 8 pm for a 9 pm pickup. The person who answered the call told me to call back. Am I the only person to find that strange? Couldn't she take my order and specify to chef that the pick up is 9 pm? Yet she chose to tell me to call back. Mind you she did not even ask me if this is a big order. I get it that this place has won James Beard award but I don't recall service industry is to create inconvenience to patrons. I almost felt like I was lucky she would take my order only if I call back 15 min to 9. I would think a hole in the wall type restaurant would have taken my order and waited to prepare my food. Is this a restaurant with inexperienced staff or a restaurant whose service model is to serve the staff not the patrons?30 min later......As instructed I called back and put in my order. The same person picked up the call and said the food will be ready in 20 min (I almost wanted to say I thought you said it would take 15 min.) Since my husband went to pick up, I did not want her to give him attitude. He arrived around 15 min after I called and the food was ready. Mind you we are 3 blocks away from the restaurant. When we sat down to eat the food 5 min later, we found the food was room temperature. I highly doubt that's how the food should be served. If this was an ubereat pickup, the food would have arrived cold!  Generally pick up means the food is ready to eat and does not require to be reheated. Not sure the chef forgot to heat up my order or the person who took my order pulled a prank. If the food is not meant for pick up, then the restaurant should not allow it. The cold food definitely is not worth $50 I paid for half fried chicken and ribs! It's a shame that the food quality has slipped. If I could update my star ratings, I would have changed it to a 2.

4.0,1/15/2018,Southern food. NYC style. Forget how much this costs down where you're from. It's still good. Tasty in my mouth and filling my belly. If I had biscuits and gravy like this when I was in college I'd be in trouble. The biscuit itself is actually semi-sweet despite being covered in sausage-y gravy. The fried chicken is light and airy. I'm still not a chicken fan but I'll eat it fried. The breast is not as good as the leg.

The chicken is very flavorful, and the waffles compliment it very well. My friend ordered the shrimp and grits and that was equally delicious. I'm originally from the south and I would say its a good northern take on Southern food (restaurants can never get it 100% correct up here, they always try to keep it a little too healthy, but this is a pretty valiant try).The restaurant itself is very cute. Think small southern restaurant but in a hip and trendy way. Its a pretty small space but they use it well. I was seated near a window and got to people watch throughout the meal. They had an outdoor seating area too which I'm sure would be nice when the weather is good. All in all a very solid brunch option in NYC. I'm taking 1 star off of the review because they had some fried biscuit doughnuts, basically a biscuit covered in cinnamon and sugar that was AMAZING.

The decor was also really rustic and went well with all the food offerings. For the food: I ordered the Mac and cheese and the honey biscuits. Both were absolutely amazing. The mac and cheese was definitely made with sharp cheddar so you actually tasted the cheese well and it wasn't bland like most places!

We ordered the drunken deviled eggs, the half bird to share, buckwheat waffles and a side of Mac and cheese and collars greens. The drunken deviled eggs were pretty too look at and pretty good but I'm not really sure if it's worth it cause of its portion size. The eggs were a bit on the saltier side though. The buckwheat waffles were my favorite! I liked how fluffy and thick the waffles were! The Mac and cheese was delicious. It was crusted with biscuit and thyme on the top and complemented the Mac and cheese very well!  The chicken was moist and very flavorful.

If you want to have dinner I definitely advise you to make reservations but they always seem to be crowded.To start for drinks we had the spiked peach ice tea which was very good but not apart of their usual menu from what I observed. Not too strong or weak. For appetizers we ordered the drunken deviled eggs which looked almost too pretty to eat and grandma daisy's angel biscuits. The eggs were pretty but we definitely eat every last one. The eggs were delicious but I definitely expected more of the biscuits. With a name like that I expected the biscuits to be the lightest and flakiest biscuits I had ever eaten but they weren't. The biscuits were good but I wouldn't order them again. My friends ordered the fried chicken while I had the meatloaf big mistake. In my opinion the meatloaf was a bit dry and I wouldn't order it again. Or maybe I felt that way because I did get to try the fried chicken. The fried chicken is definitely their specialty and a must try if you ever visit this restaurant. The chicken was very flavorful and fried to perfection. I loved the chicken so much that I neglected the food I ordered and placed an order for the fried chicken to go.

The lady there asked if he could wait for our waitress to come to our table but we had already been waiting for a while. The food was also a tad disappointing.

4.0,12/28/2017,"Came here, partly because really wanted chicken and waffles and partly due to all the good reviews.My review is based mainly on the food.  The place itself is cozy, not much else to really say.We ordered, the pickled deviled eggs...These were to die for.  Soooo very good.  Then of course we had to have the chicken and the waffles.We got the basket of the whole chicken.  Overall the chicken was very crisp and moist.  Perfectly seasoned.The waffles on the other hand, were not good at all.  I think they flash burned them.  When I took a bite into one of them, they completely crumbled.  For a chicken and waffle place this is what some would call an egg on the face.Now for the not so good part.  I might be picky but I like attention to detail.  In so many restaurants when they first open up, everything is looked over several times.  When they get popular, the little things start to go.Basically, when we got the chicken, the first thing I reached for, was a wing.  This particular wing was not quite fried and I ended up chewing on breaded skin.  The rest of the chicken was perfectly cooked.Another small thing to some, but I felt was lacking was the fact, that they didn't bring an empty bowl or something to put the bones in.  Imagine sitting a small table with a bucket of chicken and just one plate.  Not very fun.  This is what I call attention to detail.Overall, I would be back and the food was good.  I would however skip the waffles, and the drinks while good, a bit pricey.",0,0,0,Dmitry R.,"Forest Hills, NY",22,139,54
4.0,12/28/2017,"I'd rate Root & Bone 4.5 stars. Root & Bone has been on my brunch bucket list for awhile. I finally got to cross it off!We ordered sticky buns and ""Fried Chicken &Three."" The sticky buns were gooey and topped with nuts. They were a bit too sweet for me (and I have a major sweet tooth) but enjoyable. Next up was the entree. The mac and cheese had a nice consistency--creamy on the bottom and breadcrumbs on the top. It was extra cheesy in the best way possible. The waffles were fresh but I wish they had a softer texture. The collard greens had a small kick of spice which livened up the flavor. The fried chicken was incredible--super juicy and the meat fell right off the bone.The server was friendly and checked in with us sufficiently.

Wait for big groups over 4, single or couples will luck out with a counter spot near the kitchen or facing the street.Food:Fried Chicken(3.5/5): Option to get White or Dark meat. Chicken had a nice crispy coating and was juicy inside. The coating could have used a little more flavor.Mac and cheese(3/5): Side portion comes in a small cast iron skillet. Had a nice crispy top, the sauce inside was too salty for me. Buckwheat waffles(3.5/5): Soft and fluffy - more pancake like. Personally prefer waffles that are crispy on the outside.Collard greens(2.5/5) - Cooked well but was too acidic in taste.Arnold Palmer(2/5): Extra tart so not my favorite.

1.0,12/22/2017,"The point of going to a restaurant is to enjoy really great food and have a new unique experience. Tonight my wife and family went to experience these things at Root and Bone. When we first walked in, the ambiance and decor was lovely and we decided to go with the tasting menu. Something easy and a little taste of everything. The food was so DELICIOUS and drinks were on point ! We were having a great time with lots of good food and laughter. At the end of the meal , our bill came up to 267.00 after taxes. We split the bill and added gratuity and started to wind down. All of a sudden one of the waiters came back to our table. Gave us all our money back and said that at 7% tip was unacceptable and that it was a mandatory tip of 20% and gave us back our payment and tip. I was outraged. This is unacceptable. This was EXTREMELY embarrassing. This is the reason for the 1 star review. First off, we DID NOT give a 7% percent tip. We know how to tip, my wife is in the industry we understand.  The first time we returned the check we gave them $310. That is 15% tip. That is a standard tip in NYC. We tipped on the taxed rate as well if you want to get technical. You are supposed to tip on the pre-taxed total.  How dare you come back to our table and demand a 20% tip??!!!!  I was absolutely flabbergasted , this has never happened to me in any dining experience. The waitstaff wasn't over the moon. It was appropriate. The busboy filled up our water when it was down. Its not like our waiter came to our table and asked how the food was, or did anyone want another drink . Nothing. Nothing special , nothing memorable. But you come back with our whole bill , place it on the table and demand we pay 20%. It was so embarrassing.

The chicken itself is brined in sweet tea, perfectly tender, simply but well seasoned and not overly battered. And the house made hot sauce is this wicked blend of crystal hot sauce and tupelo honey.

I ordered the chicken and three, which comes with two pieces of fried chicken and collard greens, waffles, and Mac n cheese. Firstly the fried chicken was flavorless and not crispy at all. The waffles did not stand out either. They tasted like those waffles you get at a continental breakfast buffet in a hotel. The collard greens were okay. It had very korean cuisine flavors to it which was unexpected. To be honest, the Mac and cheese was probably the best thing that I ordered. It was creamy, cheesy, and delicious, although a tad bit salty. The honey tobacco sauce and maple syrup were okay as well.

5.0,12/4/2017,"If you are ever in search of a good place for fried chicken, this is the place. This is hands down, my favorite fried chicken joint. The skin may not be as crispy as other places, but the flavor of the chicken in the brine that they do is amazing and pairs well with their delicious hot sauce. I know this is a sin, but I don't typically enjoy the skin of fried chicken. Most of the time, I find it extremely greasy and not so easy to digest. Most people will ask, then why do you even bother eating fried chicken? Because the chicken is usually moist and full of juices after it's fried. This chicken...I find the skin more delicate, not heavily battered. With the ever so faint taste of lemon which really compliments and ties the taste together. Don't forget to dip it in the hot sauce before eating to get the full experience. The spicy and sour taste with a touch of sweetness from the honey pairs so incredible well, it leaves you wanting more at the end.

1.0,12/1/2017,"My stomach is legit telling me no because their ribs were under-cooked. They should not market themselves as a Southern restaurant because my body rejected their ribs over the last few hours. Just God no. Do not go here if you are from the South because it just will be a huge disappointment. If you have never had the luxury of eating BBQ in the great state of Texas (I'm kinda lying, but the BBQ makes up for a lot ... it's that good), then this would be so amazing. If you have zero taste buds, you would think their food is amazing. If you think Kentucky BBQ (it's like off-brand vanilla wafers ... you want the Nilla wafers that is Texas BBQ) is so good, you will love the tastelessness yet under-cookedness that is their ribs. It seems like their boiled their ribs, put sauce on it, and put it in the oven for maybe 20 minutes. Good ribs include brown sugar, the oven if you have no grill, and broiling for a sticky rib. Their ribs reminded me of depression. It wouldn't even be something I would eat if I was drunk and I'm not that picky when I'm drunk. I gave my leftovers to my date and depending on if I want to see him again I have to tell him that he may die if he eats the ribs. He at least needs to continue to cook them in the oven.  Let's talk about the other things on their menu that was just wrong:-The baked beans ... it was a lima bean, which is the wrong bean,but that's not my actual issue. The issue is that the bean was under-cooked and still hard. Lima bean is commonly called butter beans because when cooked it's like so smooth and buttery. These beans should have either quickly soaked by putting them in boiling water for 10-20 minutes then letting them sit in water for about a hour OR soaked in water overnight. They legit did neither. So I almost broke my tooth on their hard ass lima bean. Lima beans are easy and they couldn't even do that. Stick to baked beans in a can and you can make them even better on a grill or in a cast iron because HELL NO!-The sweet tea. Even McDonalds has better sweet tea. I love sweet tea and your was just tea that has been brewed. You are supposed to do more than that. Actually, put lemons and sugar in it like a lot of lemons and sugar. Also, the server didn't need to tell me it was brewed in house because it's legit the easiest thing to make. It was still terrible. -The chicken. They are not chickfila. There are few places that can pull off a sweet-ish chicken and it's chickfila (barely ... their sauces saves them & great customer service). Their chicken was sweet and salty. It was really weird. Don't bring your chicken in sweet tea. They should brine it in something that makes sense because it was still rather forgettable. I had a small piece and the best part was the skin because it was crunchy. It was cooked well and juicy, but the taste wasn't there. It's like they used no seasoning, but thought I wouldn't noticed because it's sweet. I do prefer a cajun chicken,but I'm open to other types chicken that has seasoning on it. I don't think I'm asking for too much, but maybe I am. This chicken was under-seasoned when it came to spices, but over-brined when it came to sweet tea. They can do a herb brine ... that would make more sense. They can put some Tony's (if you from the South, you know what I'm talking about) on this, paprika, thyme, 21 seasoning salute from Trader Joes, etc I cannot comment on the roasted beets or coleslaw because I do not like yogurt (roasted beets) and I don't like coleslaw. My date enjoyed both,but he also enjoyed the chicken so his taste buds are off. Being quirky is not the tea when it comes to Southern food if you have not masters the basic dishes. Nothing that I ate on their menu made me think that they mastered basic Southern or BBQ dishes. Also, if you have shrimp and grits ... why don't you have biscuits and gravy? I actually am a New Yorker born and raised, but I think that nobody should be allowed to own a Southern BBQ restaurant in NYC unless 3 BBQ restaurants in the sponsor them in Houston. BBQ is so serious for me and all this made me do was miss Houston. I should have known because I would have known if there was good Southern BBQ in NYC. I should have stuck with Italian ... my stomach and butt would have been happier after.",0,0,0,Kema G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,13,0

The food was amazing... and I can say amazing because Picky Pete was raving over it.. and he raves over nothing.

J got the fried chicken,  with collards and Mac and cheese. The fried chicken was tender,  well fried,  but not as hot as he woulda liked.  The Mac and cheese is extremely well done- creamy,  complex,  and precious in its little cast iron.   The collards were good,  but not the best I've had.  They were still a bit al dente for my liking.   But again,  very decent.  Oh, and fresh lemonade!

Crispy crunchy goodness. I was skeptical when I looked at the menu and saw there was going to be lemon on it. I loved it. We all did! One of the best brunch spots in the city. Great ambiance. Bright and airy and warm. On a Sunday it's very relaxing. We got the booth. You are going to wait (we waited an hour) but it's worth it and I love that they text you. It was freezing outside and the place is small so having the ability to get coffee or go shopping and then be alerted that your table is ready is much better than waiting outside or ver close by as some establishments do. The bacon is stubby pieces of fat back. It's thick and rally good. I loved the drinks and they have a great bar. Lilith was AMAZING! Such a sweetheart and really great! We never had to search for her and a couple of time she came by refilled our water glasses/brought lemons etc to the table without us noticing. It's great when you don't have to track down your food.

She lives in the area and has been dozens of times, and now I understand why.We started with cocktails; they're pricey, which sucks, but no different than most Manhattan restaurants. We both tried the winter seasonal ""Long Winter's Nap"" and oh...my god. It's made with apple brandy and maple syrup, and it was perfect. I'm usually not a brandy fan, but I may be now. I wanted maybe 12 of them, but I went with one because it set me back $15.For food, we went with the family style for the two of us. It's $40 pp which you may balk at but listen: it's three courses, multiple options in each course, and seasonal desserts. You can look up everything you get but trust, if no one in your party has dietary restrictions (this isn't for vegan folk), you. must. do it. If you want three courses anyway, your meal will probably come out to more $ per person and you won't have all the amazing options you do. You get so much food, I didn't even finish my main course (which never happens...ever). The seasonal desserts were pumpkin cheesecake and a chocolate mousse. I don't want to be extra and say they were life changing, but...they were. They sell the individual jars of dessert out front; I may need to go back just to pick some up.

It's just the right amount of crispy and incredibly juicy, and the breading had a certain flavor (can't put my finger on what exactly it is) that takes it to another level.  I also love how it's served over lemon wedges, I haven't seen that much but it gives the chicken a perfect hint of citrus.  2 of us shared half a bird and we got sides of macaroni and cheese and crispy carrots. The macaroni was incredible, not overly cheesy like you tend to find at so many southern restaurants, and the crispy carrots, while not what we expected (we thought they'd be pan sautéed, but they were breaded and deep fried), were also delicious.  For dessert we had the yummy banana chocolate chip cake, which came warm with ice cream. Service was very friendly and attentive, and the restaurant itself has a warm, relaxed, Southern vibe. We loved this place and can't wait to go back.",0,0,0,Sarah D.,"New York, NY",4,182,13
3.0,11/10/2017,"My husband and I had a reservation for Root and Bone last night. The place is super small but we were seated at a two top right way. The tables were quite close to each other- close enough that I kept bumping elbows with the girl sitting next to me and my husband and I could overhear her and her friends' entire conversation. The servers were very nice. We ordered a spiked arnold palmer and spiked lemonade to start, which were good. We ordered biscuits, a whole chicken (with intentions of taking some to go for leftovers), mac and cheese, and succotash. The food came out right away. The biscuits were soft and came with a chicken ju for dipping. The chicken tasted good but was soggy instead of crunchy. The mac and cheese was so delicious, the best part of our meal. The succotash had an overwhelming taste of driedherbs that attacked our palettes. Halfway through our meal, a server came and moved our table over to give us some more space. We passed on desserts. I would give Root and Bone three and a half stars if I could for the mac and cheese alone but that's about all.",0,0,0,Karen F.,"Staten Island, NY",61,6,1
4.0,11/6/2017,"Came here with a group of 7 and had to do the family style option. Don't eat lunch it you do that because you get so so much food. We had tons leftover. That included the drunken deviled egg, biscuits and sweet potato salad in the first course. The group picked the biscuits as the winner of that round. Second course is the fried chicken, Mac and cheese, collared greens and waffles. Waffles were a little dry even with the syrup. That would be my only complaint though because all else was very yummy. Mac and Cheese was the winner of that round. Finally for dessert we got these little cakes that my friend said tasted like ""Christmas"" and a play on a apple pie or crumble in a mason jar. The apple dessert was the winner of the final round. Overall super fun with a group (unless you can't a lot of grease in your stomach) and the waitstaff was extremely attentive and friendly.",2,1,1,Gina S.,"Milwaukee, WI",148,58,88
5.0,11/5/2017,"Went here for dinner on a Saturday night about a month ago, and I am still thinking about the flavor of their fried chicken! The breading had such a unique amazing (love the incorporation of sweet tea) flavor and the chicken was super juicy. The sides were also very well-made. We ordered the carrots which had a sweet flavor and the collard greens, which were very good to me (I've only had collard greens twice). We (party of two) made reservations and got there 5 or 10 minutes after our reservation and still had to wait a few minutes. If you are coming here on a weekend night make reservations! We ended up having to sit at a bar-like table, which was my least favorite part of the experience, but actually wasn't too bad.I am definitely going to go here again. The one thing I would change is that I wouldn't order the cheesy waffles. I was not a huge fan and it was my least favorite thing I ate here. We also ordered the biscuits and I liked those much better. We ended up going overboard and ordering too much food so if we would've left the waffles out, the meal would have been perfect.So in conclusion, I loved this place! If you are thinking about going here, stop thinking and head over! You need to try their chicken!",1,1,1,Britney M.,"New York, NY",124,5,2

The full chicken is more than enough for two people, and the hot-sauce served with it is next level. I would recommend the biscuits to start with the mac and cheese and grits(my GF is from the south) as sides. Getting a table here can be tough, but putting your name down and grabbing a pretzel/beer across the street is a good way to pass time.

5.0,10/29/2017,"Came in on a Sunday night at around 7 PM. My reservation was at 6:30 PM but I called ahead of time to say I was running late and they were fine with it. Service was a lil off for that because we were seated at the chef's counter/bar even though tables opened up once we sat down and we weren't offered to move to another table. The waitress/bus boys also rushed us a little because they kept picking stuff up off the table when we weren't ready. OTHER THAN THAT, i am completely in LOVE with their food. Sitting in front of the chef was kind of amazing watching him doing his thing and cook such delicious food. We ordered biscuits and deviled eggs for our appetizers. BOTH were delicious (the biscuits had a little honey glaze in them) and eggs were pickled. The entrees were shrimp and grits (shared between 2), mac and cheese, and butternut squash. EVERYTHING WAS SCRUMPTIOUS. I bet if I ordered any other entree or side it would be just as good. I usually would've opted for chicken at Root & Bone, but my friend wanted shrimp and grits. I don't love grits at all, but this hit the spot (So flavorful and rich). Every bite had me feening for more! After gettin' hit with a huge food coma, the dessert we chose was spiced cherry layer cake. This was probably the most disappointing thing we ate. Wasn't amazing and I wouldn't get it again or suggest it.",4,3,2,Natalie Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,75,20

The best, unsurprisingly, was the fried chicken which was perfectly crisp and juicy. The other dishes were enjoyable, but would probably pass on if it weren't for the menu special.

The entrance / waiting area wasn't large so we were standing in the way of people entering and leaving. Very uncomfortable. The hostess knew we wanted to be seated but just didn't care. When our friend finally arrived, it took them another 10 minutes to get organized and to seat us. The ventilation in the restaurant is also pretty bad - we walked out smelling like fried food.  It's a shame because the food was actually quite decent but we collectively agreed that the service was very uncalled for and will not be returning!",0,0,0,JS H.,"New York, NY",0,22,11

The Amarillo plantains and bacon was loaded with flavor (at 3 dollars per!) and the Grandma's Biscuit with chicken jus melted in your mouth. We split a half bird and the mac n cheese.

3.0,10/22/2017,"As 2 Southerners living in NYC, sometimes, you just really want some Fried Chicken. My husband and I ventured here after a lot of research that I did about Southern food here in the city. I was really hankering for some fried chicken (this happens a lot), and the place looked cute for a date night! I just loved the ambiance there. Gorgeous restaurant and outdoor seating, complete with mason jars and the cutest plates. For 2 people, we ordered half a bird for the fried chicken, Grandma's biscuits and the mac and cheese. (This is enough food!) Our waiter told us most people over order...and that's probably because the prices are really reasonable so maybe people don't think they get as much food as they do? The sweet tea was ok, nothing spectacular here. Biscuits - Mmm they were so good! My favorite thing about our meal. Not too buttery, nice crisp on the top.Fried Chicken - So, if you like sweet meat, you will like this fried chicken. I'm used to more of a cajun type, so this was a little jarring for me. This is because they use a sweet tea marinade, so I think it was good, just not for me because the sweetness really came through. It came out hot, but not piping and could have been crispier in my opinion.Mac and Cheese- ok. VERY cheesy with cavatappi pasta. In summary, I think the place really shines in it's decor and the feel that you get as it's super romantic. The food for me didn't shine as much as the restaurant, so we were a bit disappointed.

5.0,10/9/2017,"TL;DR (and a mandate) - I had one of the most delicious meals of 2017 at Root & Bone this past weekend. You MUST go and order the biscuits, the fried chicken, the squash and the collard greens.Your belly will thank you and your taste buds will have a party.- Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits: These were soft and buttery on the inside with that crumbly and golden texture on the outside. I am a biscuit fiend, and I could order 3 more dishes of this and go to town. - Squash Salad: Ummm, pickled garlic vinaigrette, lemon AND guajillo pepper? YES PLEASE. This combination is BOMB. Not only do you get that satisfaction you can't get from anything else but garlic, but you also get the spice from the pepper and the acid from the lemon. The squash is such a perfect vehicle to soak up all those juices. I mean, I am salivating over squash here. It is THAT good. - Root & Bone fried chicken: We ordered the half-chicken. It came with one leg, one thigh, one breast and one wing. Absolutely juicy - the long hours of care by that sweet tea brine definitely shows. I was blown away by how all that juicy chicken could be encased in the most perfectly crispy breading. It's more oven-baked than fried, but just as satisfying. I loved the spices in it (lemon and spiked tobasco honey) to give it a tangy, sweet and spicy balance. Korean fried chicken is my favorite type of chicken, but this one actually nudges it out! - Collard Greens with bacon, chipotle & cider vinegar. Yes, you guessed it - best collard greens I have ever had. I usually find collard greens to be one-note and uneventful, but this was a bright dish that complemented every other dish.I plan on returning many times over and bringing my out-of-town guests here for such a delicious meal!FYI - my fiance and I are big foodies and have big appetites, but the above 4 dishes definitely put me in a food coma not long after!",29,14,23,Jenny P.,"Arlington, VA",231,723,753

The wait to sit inside was about an hour so after some deliberation (it was a sub 60 evening) we agreed to sit outside rather than try to find somewhere else. In all honesty we probably didn't take full advantage of what was on offer (notably the chicken). But what we did have was really rather good and worth braving the mild outdoor temperatures. I opted for the shrimp and grits, which was really good but ultimately just shrimp and grits. My wife's pork dish was excellent, covered in some sort of green crumb and the meat fell apart easily. The outdoor seating is rather exposed but luckily it was a quiet side street. The seating in general is quite close together. I also found the service quite slow, which may or may not be to your liking. I would have preferred more options on the menu as well - due to allergies I only really had a choice between the shrimp and the chicken.

The food was excellent from the start to the end. They really went above and beyond their restaurant week obligations, and the abundance of food was only exceeded by its quality. What we had:Biscuits (for the table) - Buttery, flaky and delicious, and topped with coarse salt that gave it a pop of flavor. They came with some gravy for dipping that paired really well with them.Deviled eggs: Really good, pink from beetroot juice and quite flavorful.Fried chicken and Waffle sandwiches; More of an open faced sandwich, with a slice of fried green tomato to add an interesting texture and flavor. The chicken was delicious, crispy and moist.Biscuits and Gravy: Delicious! Really well seasoned and tasty with none of that annoying lard/flour flavor you sometimes get with this dish. They used a lot of their signature biscuits in it, that made it super tasty. Also comes topped off with eggs.Mac and Cheese (for the table): If anything fell a bit short in the meal, this was it. While quite good and nicely crusted with breadcrumbs, I felt that this was not as great as the other dishes.Watermelon (for the table): A simple dish of watermelon slices with mint, onion and a lime vinaigrette. A nice light counterbalance to all the super rich food.Banana pudding -  Light, creamy and fluffy with a nice biscuit base. Not too strong of a banana flavor.Lime tart - A little too limey (and tart!) for my liking but quite decent otherwise.The place is quite small and the food is amazing so naturally it's a bit hard to get reservations here.

They were splendid! We received 2 biscuits with a small cup of a salty sauce.  The biscuits themselves were to die for! They were warm... Crunchy and sweet on the outside... soft and toasty on the inside. Absolutely perfect!! In my opinion, the sauce didn't go with it, the biscuits were great as is.  Next we dove into the chicken... It was on point!! The outside was nice and crispy, not greasy at all.  And it went well with the cheddar waffles (I had my own order since they weren't GF... I can't have fried chicken without waffles!).  On the side were 2 containers of Tabasco and Maple Syrup - I tried one and then the other... But the perfect balance is when you mix them together.

1.0,9/5/2017,"I read a few of the recent 3-star reviews and each was trying to be as kind as possible.  While the meal did not actually make me ill, (the staff properly handled the food by certification standards) the food was completely bland and in some cases gross.  Our daughter ordered the biscuits and gravy and the swamp of white gravy which was slowly separating drowned the biscuits which made an unappealing looking dish upon arrival. The taste was bland but should have been full of a rich, smoky, fatty taste. The fried half-chicken was also shockingly bland, and lacked a seasoned flavor which should have come from a properly seasoned breading mixture. Worse of all were the waffles, if you can believe it. These were sickeningly sweet, super doughy rounds topped with flavorless orange processed slices of what should have been cheddar cheese squares. Yuk, to put it succinctly. Even the two attempts of homemade sauces which were meant to help punch-up the flavors of the foods turned out to be sadly nothing more than watered-down sugar syrups with a dash of either maple or hot sauce to make them appear to have some color but were again just bland. Annoyingly, everything was given generous sprinkles of kosher sea salt, which made all the bland food taste nothing but salty. Ok, so someone needs to tell the kitchen staff that giant chunks of salt everywhere doesn't compensate for bland food.The side order of grits were overpowered by a bland congealed fatty substance (maybe the same stuff put on top of the waffles) and the side of smoked pork shoulder lacked smokiness and was doused with the house-made sugar-maple-syrup before it arrived at our table which made it hopelessly sweet yet bland.I needed to provide my credit card when making the reservation and would be charged if I cancelled the reservation after 5pm the evening before. This was a tip-off that I might be disappointed in the meal. The owners bios are very respectable but unfortunately I see they had a successful restaurant in Florida, and we all know there are no good (only bland to cater to population of senior citizens and tourists) restaurants in Florida so that also should have been a tip-off.The bathroom had an extremely greasy, slick floor, like one would only expect within the kitchen work area, so in my opinion it's a lawsuit just waiting to happen since I had to carefully slide my feet to move around inside the bathroom to keep from falling.The service was excellent and the dishware and decor was eclectic and attractive and pop-80s music was playing which was ok, however I had to sit on a metal chair which had a freezing cold metal-seat (since the air in the restaurant was also cold). Thankfully I brought an extra scarf with me which I was able to sit on to provide a shield between me from the seat.I was really looking forward to eating here based on the fantastic bios of the two owners but unfortunately I cannot recommend this restaurant; sorry.",0,0,0,Brenda D.,"West Chester, PA",0,11,0

5.0,9/2/2017,"I came here and got the half chicken,with a side of waffles, two cocktails, two desserts, and a smile that lasted for hours. The chicken was unlike any other I've ever tasted. The fried skin truly carried the flavor of sweet tea and lemon, which is a flavor unlike any other fried chicken I've ever had. The insides were so juicy, before I'd noticed i'd  skinned the poor chicken by eating it out of its skin, essentially defeating the purpose of fried chicken, although the lemon skin was in a league of its own. There were two side sauces, a delicious whiskey maple and a kind of homemade Frank's hot sauce. Both were fantastic. The whiskey one actually tasted like whiskey. The waffles were soft and fluffy. The name of my cocktails elude me at the moment, but one was green, with mint and kale, and was uber refreshing and perfect. The blueberry cocktail went great with my banana pudding dessert,and the peach cobbler type dessert was accompanied by incredible chocolate chip coffee ice cream as the vanilla had ran out. All in all this was a successful visit to a very different kind of southern place.

2.0,9/1/2017,A nice looking place with decent chicken and little else. The service was overbearing at the beginning and completely lacking at the end.

5.0,8/31/2017,"Came here to celebrate our engagement.  Service was great, food was very good.  We got the half chicken with waffles, grits, biscuits, and peaces and burrata.  Everything was delicious.  Grits were amazing.  Waffles probably a little over-hyped, but they went well with the chicken.  Chicken was also very good, tasty skin, lots of meat, not too overcooked.Only issue is I called in ahead to see if they could prepare something special, like a cake, to surprise my fiance.  To be honest, I thought the cake would be on the house.  It wasn't, but I didn't really mind at all.  The thing I did mind was they didn't let us choose the cake, and they gave us some dry coconut cake when there were so many other ones available.  I mean, cmon, coconut is the least popular flavor available, why give us cocount?  GIVE US CHOCOLATE.  You're charging us, after all.  We ate half of it and thought ""that was nice of them to give us this complementary cake, although neither of us is a coconut fan.""  Had we known they were going to charge us (which was fine), we would've at least picked something better, LIKE CHOCOLATE, or not have ordered cake at all.  But that shouldn't take away from the rest of the experience.Overall great food with great service.  but if you ever want cake, don't just ask for cake, they might give you coconut.",0,0,0,Nury Y.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,1

My daughter and I stopped in for an early evening meal. We sat outside on a cool summer evening and started with a glass of Rosé and lemonade. For appetizers we ordered the warm cornbread with bacon maple butter (it was as yummy as it sounds) and the drunken deviled eggs(beautiful presentation). Dinner dishes were Local Tomato Salad and Peaches 'n Burrata. The tomatoes were seasonally ripe and fresh along with cucumbers and red onions. We enjoyed the peaches too, although we prefer the cooked peaches to be a little softer. Dessert was my favorite-but isn't is always? We shared a ""mini"" banana pudding and I'm very lucky it was a mini because I could have easily eaten a large one! Attentive service and charming decor.

4.0,8/24/2017,"Came here for restaurant week lunch and it was a great experience! We reserved for a later lunch time (around 3pm) so it was a nice and laid back atmosphere. The place is small but has outdoor seating and the rustic vibe definitely makes you feel like you're in the countryside. My bf ordered up the restaurant week menu, while I ordered a bucket of bird (because fried chicken is all I really want).  While we were waiting for our food, we ordered a Gentlemen Farmer because I like whiskey and it was the perfect combo of rye and whatever the other ingredients were (some kind of herbs).  It was also a recommendation from the bartender so no arguments there!First came the biscuits, which were probably the best biscuits I have ever had (and being from the South that is a big statement). They were buttery, soft, warm, and perfectly flaky. It was heavenly. Then, we got these tiny little deviled eggs. As a huge fan of deviled eggs, these only measured up somewhat. The ingredients were great and inventive, but I took one bite and they were gone.  After that, we got our main courses -- the Waffle Benedict and fried chicken. The waffles were really great, but the poached egg on top of it wasn't the best combo imo. This plate was paired with a nice, simple salad and some really bomb pork belly bacon. I would ask for a whole side plate of the bacon had I known earlier how delicious it was.  The Waffle Benedict also came with a side of mac n' cheese (which was good but not outstanding in any way) and a slice of some of the coolest tasting watermelon I have ever had.  Seriously, eat the watermelon even if you think you won't like it. Onto the big kahuna -- the fried chicken. The spices they put on the chicken are superb and the little lemon zest just picks it all up wonderfully.  The only complaint I have is that while the wings and drumsticks were amazingly juicy, the chicken breast was just a teensy bit dry.  It might have just been the piece because everything else seemed to be cooked very well.  Otherwise, it was a goood basket of fried chicken and I would for sure eat it again.  Also, I LOVE the fact that it comes in a basket. Definitely get the Bucket of Bird if you come here! I only got a half bird and it was a good amount of chicken. But, if you're feeling hungry, get the whole bird! It comes with an interestingly spiked, honey tabasco sauce too. Though, I ate most of the chicken on it's own and was very content. Lastly, we (and by that I mean I - my bf was already full to the brim) had a realllllyyyy delicious banana pudding dessert.  We had a choice of key lime pie or banana pudding and I debated which one to pick (I love both!) but the extremely helpful, down to earth, friendly waiter said he likes the banana pudding more so I went with that. It comes in the cutest little mason jar and I could have eaten an entire full-size jar of it. I'm sure the key lime pie would have been fine too but GET THE BANANA PUDDING!! It's the perfect end to calm your stomach after having devoured a basket of fried chicken. Love this little place that makes you feel out of the big city for a meal. Again, the decor really makes you feel like you're in the south, which I appreciate a whole lot because I grew up in the south. And, in the city, the ambience of a fried chicken spot for me certainly plays a large role for the experience.  Definitely will be back for a whole bucket of bird and another glass of the Gentleman Farmer.",1,0,1,Amy C.,"Brooklyn, NY",182,15,4
3.0,8/22/2017,"I think I might have higher expectation on Root & Bone so was a bit disappointed when I finally tried it out over the weekend. Initially came across Root & Bone from NYC 2017 Restaurant Week, wanted to make a reservation but everything was booked so settle in for a regular night since the reviews here looked so promising. Came here for dinner and ordered the half bird, deviled eggs along with the mac & cheese. I must say the deviled eggs were very unexpected, it was so good I even thought about ordering seconds but had to stop myself since I tend to ALWAYS over order (I'm sure I'm not the only one). The mac & cheese arrived shortly after the half bird did, it was okay. Felt like something very normal, like you can make at home and not worth paying $9 for but hey I'm a sucker for mac and cheese so I sure got sucker punched for ordering it. And last for the bird... I have to admit the bird was juicy on the thigh part but the breast part, it was awfully dry. I had to keep slathering their honey tabasco sauce (which is so damn addicting that I will now need to make my own) in order to finish it. I was also hoping the bird to be a little more crispy on the outside so I get that crunch when I bite into it, but sadly no... I think I still like Pies-n-Thighs more, it's got that true crisp from the outside and juicy and tender from the inside, it was perfect. Root & Bone is definitely a lot more IG worthy when you want to take some cute pictures but not so much for me when it comes to their infamous fried bird.",0,0,0,Stacey T.,"New York, NY",157,93,168
3.0,8/21/2017,"Visited Root & Bone with my sister last weekend and must say I have really mixed feelings! The service and ambiance were great and the Restaurant Week menu was a STEAL (between the two of us we shared over 8 dishes!). But unfortunately, some of the dishes were real disappointments and overshadowed the dishes that we really enjoyed.We started off with complementary biscuits that came with a chicken jus and chunks of sea salt. This was by far the best thing we ate and probably one of the best things I ate all weekend. The biscuits were SO warm and flaky. If you can only get one thing, get the biscuits. I also had the deviled eggs that I really enjoyed!Unfortunately, the remaining dishes were subpar. The tomato salad really left something to be desired. The cucumbers and tomatoes were cut too large and chunky, so it was difficult to eat, and it was lacking real flavor, even with the mustard vinaigrette. We also got the waffle benedict and the fried chicken n waffle sandwich. The yolk in one of my poached eggs was solid, but the lemon hollandaise was superb! The waffles were OK but a little chewy and the fried chicken had melted cheese that had hardened and was difficult to eat. Both dishes came with salads, mine was delicious but my sisters was inedible. They had put WAY too much vinegar in the dressing.We also ate mac n cheese and banana pudding (I know... an absurd amount of food!), both of which were delicious.

4.0,8/20/2017,"I have had Root & Bone on my list for YEARS and was thrilled to finally be able to come try it during Restaurant Week this year. Reservations are hard to come by so definitely plan far in advance, especially for larger groups. The space itself is TINY and can definitely get a little loud, but once you look past that, the food is definitely worth the visit. The ambiance is rustic and homey, which is very cute. Service here is very attentive though the hostesses can be a little distracted during prime busy hours. For Restaurant Week, we started with Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits - holy cow these were the best biscuits I think I've ever had. They were warm and flaky, fresh from the oven, and the honey roasted chicken jus was out of this world. I could have made a meal out of just these biscuits. None of us were particularly fond of our appetizers - the drunken deviled eggs, but I was never really a deviled eggs fan anyways. The star, obviously, was the chicken and waffles. You get your choice of dark or white meat, but it all comes out freshly fried and DELICIOUS. I thought the portion was really generous and I was stuffed at the end of the meal. The honey tabasco and whiskey/bourbon? syrup are amazing to add but the seasoning was perfect on its own. My fiance was the only one who didn't order the chicken and waffles, opting for the short rib meatloaf instead, which he loved. The meat was really juicy, cooked perfectly, and tasted like the epitome of comfort food. The mac and cheese and platter of watermelon (with key lime jalapeño vinaigrette and red onion) were amazing sides. We will be raving about the mac and cheese for a long time to come, and the watermelon was super refreshing. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it with the onions. For dessert, we all got the key lime pie which was served in a cute little jar. It was good, but not particularly amazing. For drinks, we were all fans of the Beekeeper and Blueblood.

The interior was beautiful and the ambiance was cute. We came for restaurant week brunch ($29) and also got the tomato toast ($13).

The inside and the flatware was rustic and cute though. They were also very busy and kept forgetting to bring stuff out that we had ordered. For example, I had ordered a glass of prosecco. The server forgot to put in the order, then when I reminded him, he asked if I still wanted it since it had been so long. I said yes. He kept it on my bill. I think he should have waived that. They obviously need to be more organized or have more help. The food was decent. And the portions were good for Restaurant Week. They give you additional items for the table, which is nice.

First thing first this place is located quite far from the subway so it would be a bit of a walk (especially when you're hangry). The restaurant week menu is $29 for brunch. Grandma Biscuit was served first with sesame seed and salted honey (?) sauce. The texture was very moist, a good start. Drunked Deviled Eggs came afterward. I think the stuffing was delicious and the beet colored egg white was nice to try. For entree, I obviously went for Fried Chicken Waffle Sandwich since it's one of my favorite dishes. Honestly, I'd prefer the fried chicken at Sweet Chick (another Southern spot), which is more savory and crunchy. Their buckwheat waffle was perfect tho, so soft and airy inside. My bf didn't order the restaurant week menu because he wanted Shrimp & Grits. Good choice! The sauce is amazing with lots of shrimp, sauteed onions, and corn. Even tho it might be a bit overwhelming to eat the whole dish since the grits are very buttery. This next dish seriously had me at ftw: chilled watermelon with jalapeno, onion, basil and lime vinegarette. You know when you have a watermelon bowl, you put it in the fridge without a lid or a cover when you also have onion or other food in there and the smell transfers to the watermelon? There, that's exactly how it tastes like.

(As he eats the same thing and gestures back, yeah I'm eating it too?¿?¿ He doesn't understand.)The Restaurant Week brunch is $29 per person. You get biscuits for the table, an appetizer, mac n cheese and watermelon for the table, a main dish and a dessert. So. much. food. The deviled eggs for the appetizer might be the actual best thing I had. Who knew? Highly recommend. The dill and potato skin crisp thing on top really round them out. And the biscuits... oh my goodness, they transport me right back to the south but add a twist that I've never in my 22 years of living in Alabama had. If you don't go for restaurant week, you still MUST get these.Our main dishes were the chicken and waffles and the biscuits and gravy because, duh, more biscuits and more carbs. The chicken was cooked perfectly - not too overly crispy, not at all greasy, and a thick piece of chicken, exactly how I like it. The banana pudding wasn't my favorite (Alabama still wins there) but it was still solidly good. The key lime pie dessert was really tart but actually really good.The presentation for every single dish was beautiful. I love a place that truly cares about putting out great dishes that look just as good before eating them.Root & Bone was basically completely booked on Open Table, but my psychotic stalking of the open times led me to finding an opening randomly one Sunday. But, upon arrival on Sunday at 10:30, half the parties in line didn't have reservations and there were plenty of open tables so, if you're in the area give it a try even if you don't have a reservation!Lastly... I would have probably given this place 5 stars if the hostesses hadn't been so rude to us when we said we didn't want to sit outside at the table by the dumpster with the 20 flies all over it.

They give you biscuits for the table to start off with and then let you chose a main course that is accompanied by mac and cheese and watermelon for the table as well. They then let you chose between banana pudding or key lime for dessert. The biscuits were yummy but nothing insane. The watermelon I found to be extremely refreshing and delicious, topped with onions and jalapenos that complemented the freshness just perfectly. The mac and cheese was also absolutely delicious (heavy but so good). They gave us honey sriracha on the side which mixed extremely well with it. For my main course I went with the chicken and waffle sandwich which was also really delicious and came with these pickled tomatoes that cut the heaviness just right. I opted for the key lime for dessert and it was the cherry on top of a perfect meal. Be warned - the food is extremely heavy and I struggled very hard to finish (couldn't finish the chicken and waffles). But the food coma you will inevitably find yourself in after eating here is very much worth it!",3,1,0,Devki P.,"New York, NY",329,79,34
2.0,8/10/2017,"Really had high hope for this place based off all the great reviews but everything fell pretty short.  Came on Sunday for the restaurant week brunch.  We got biscuits to share, tomato salad for starters, chicken waffle sandwich, and banana pudding.  The bad experience all started since I have an allergy to mustard and both app items contained mustard.  The waiter suggested that I get the tomato salad and they can give me a different dressing on the side.  They first brought out the wrong app, then the tomato app but with the mustard dressing, and then finally after the third time they got it right. Then we were waiting quite a while for our drinks and were then later told that our ticket was lost.  Now onto the entrees, when it came it, they again brought out the wrong dish for me (we all ordered the chicken sandwhich).  Now the entree too was a bit disappointing.  The chicken was not crispy at all.  I thought it may have been the cheese that was melted on top, but even the pieces on the end were soggy :( The waffle was definitely more dense than I was expecting and not my favorite.  I will say the biscuits and the mac and cheese was pretty good, but not enough to make me come back.  In the end, the server was very very nice, but the service and the food just was not up to par.",1,1,1,Ariana K.,"New York, NY",451,101,165

4.0,8/8/2017,"I came in for restaurant week, full disclosure. They were fully booked for reservations but they have seating for walk-ins. The meal started off amazingly. The biscuits are incredible. One bite and you will see what I mean. I don't know what's in there but they are amazing. The complimentary tomato salad was also really good. For my main meal, I ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich. Overall I enjoyed it, the chicken was done well, the waffles were also good. My fiance ordered the eggs Benedict. Something about it just really threw me off. I think there was vanilla in the hollandaise, it just ruined it for me. It was like eating dessert. The complimentary Mac and cheese was decent, better than average. For dessert, I ordered the banana pudding, which I was happy with. I wasn't a fan of the key lime pie but if you are, order it.The menu overall if very soul food focused. I would warn you to Pace yourself because it will be very heavy and filling. To be honest, at least for the restaurant week menu, there were not a lot of vegetarian options. One thing I'll say about the food, do not take it to go. It will not hold up very well. It was pretty much inedible after a few hours. As you would expect, the service is superb. Our server was very attentive to our needs and welcoming.",2,2,2,Bushra H.,"East Brunswick, NJ",225,314,562

4.0,8/6/2017,"Came here for Restaurant Week and everything we got was delicious but there are some service quirks to be worked out.First available today meant we were sat at a ""chef's table."" Typically this means there's some interaction between the chef and the guests but in this case it meant we were seated in front of line cooks who were too busy to think let alone interact with guests or hand out samples.This kitchen is also not the chef's table type--one that anyone would want to see while eating.We were seated at this chef's table and then forgotten so we had to ask how we could order to be served.We ignored all that and focused on our dishes.The for the table biscuits were great but could use honey butter or something instead of the side of sauce. Maybe Tabasco honey drizzle might be good? Not sure what the sweet/savory sauce the biscuits were served with but that was just OK.The Mac and cheese and watermelon for the table were also fabulous and the deviled eggs appetizer was just enough to make me want more without being too filling. I got the biscuits and gravy which were not as good as I can get at home but decent. My only complaint is that my over easy egg was thrown on top and the fish was served in a bowl so I couldn't save any of the biscuits for later because they were all drenched.The key lime pie was exactly what key lime pie is supposed to be. Tangy with merengue, not overly creamy covered with whipped cream. I was scared I'd be disappointed but I give credit to the Floridian owner/chef that this was made the right way.",1,1,1,Margarita C.,"Baltimore, MD",253,47,25

Our only good experience was the waiter serving us. We ordered waffle, whole chicken, spare rib and meatloaf.  Cheese and waffle is a bad combination. Now you should wonder why successfully pancake houses don't have that on their menus. The fried chicken is nothing more than the ones you can get from the supermarket. White meat piece is very dry and has bland taste. If you like KFC and Popeye styles, don't bother with this. Spare ribs, one word, salty. That's all you can taste. Meatloaf, again, salty.

My entree was the Waffle Benedict which came with a side of macaroni (heaven in a bowl) and a medium portioned arugula salad.

5.0,7/27/2017,"Wow. Absolutely one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had (and I've had a lot). Top 5 of all time. My boyfriend and I went here for Restaurant Week and did the $42 dinner. The deviled eggs and tomato salad were lovely (tomato salad was so fresh and simple and the deviled eggs were dyed an adorable pink color). The biscuits however.. are the best biscuits I've ever eaten in my life. They are indescribably amazing, and I took 10 minutes to savor one. They are the perfect texture and taste and the jus they come with... my god. I could eat 10 of them for dinner and not want anything else. The main courses: the shrimp and grits is OUT OF THIS WORLD. The fried chicken is absolutely perfect and the honey tabasco is top 5 hot sauces I've tried. The waffle that comes with the chicken is pretty blah but covered in maple syrup, anything is good :) The mac and cheese that came for the table was decadent and perfect, and the watermelon salad was a perfect lovely palate cleanser. And the desserts... I loved that they came in tiny pots and were very small because the amount of food you get for the pre fixe menu is SIGNIFICANT so by the time we got to dessert, we were so full (in a good way). The key lime pie was AMAZING as was the banana pudding. So fresh and so wonderful. And our SERVER! Johnny! He was SO NICE! Made the experience that much better. The decor and music are PERFECT.

I went for ""supper"" and lucked out on the best weather for July so was able to sit outside.  I started with a beekeeper cocktail which was delicious.2 of us went with the restaurant menu since it gave us a sampling of their offerings. 1 started with drunken deviled eggs, the other with the local tomato salad. Both were delicious! Next were Grandma Daisy's biscuits. I've lived in the South and these are definitely something to write home about. On to the entrees...I got the shrimp and grits. It included 4 shrimp and the grits were ""melt in your mouth"" delicious. My friend got the braised short rib meatloaf and said it was so flavorful and tender. With the entrees they served us the watermelon slices, which were a nice refresher and the mac and cheese. It was as good as your favorite homemade version. At this point, we needed a box and still had dessert coming. For the sweets, we tried one of each: key lime pie and banana pudding. The key lime pie was both of our favorites! The banana pudding was a little sweet for our taste but to each his own. Needless to say, this will not be the last time I come. It is clear that heart and soul went into this restaurant.

It had everything that I look for in a mac and cheese. As for the main entrée, I got the fried chicken and waffle sandwich. Had two nice pieces of fried chicken, each on top of a soft waffle.

The outermost layer of the thigh was so fried that the meat was chewy and dry. The inner layers  of the thigh were moister. The chicken was very flavorful, and the honey Tabasco sauce enhanced the flavor. We also got Grandma Daisy's angel biscuits and the peaches & burrata--both dishes were delicious.

The salad was very small, therefore we left a little hungry.The dishes were great, quality and service very good, but the price simply doesn't match - especially for the neighborhood.

Believe it's the same fried chicken used in all the other dishes- Shrimp & Grits: A great addition to your brunch or dinner meal. Very flavorful.

I was stuffed even though I ordered and shared 3 small plates and/or sides. The pickled deviled eggs are a must try! I also loved the pickled onion and okra that came with the fried chicken biscuits. However, the biscuits were a tad dry and the chicken a bit over cooked. The macaroni and cheese was pretty good, but it would have been better if it had been piping hot. It was served kind of lukewarm despite being in a small cast iron skillet. The two things I wasn't crazy about were the lack of an AC and the coldness of the food. Although I asked the waitress to bring everything out together, I had a good reason. One of my friends ordered a salad, and the rest of us ordered small plates and/or sides. The deviled eggs, salad, and watermelon side salad were obviously cold dishes. That's fine. However, the mac and cheese and the fried chicken biscuits (our table ordered two portions) should obviously have been hotter than room temperature. It seemed like the kitchen had prepared the hot dishes first and just let them sit there while the cold dishes were prepared. While I will admit that I took numerous photos of my food, a minute (two at most) on our table in the heat humidity would not have cooled the dishes down to the temperature they were served.

A couple hours before we were scheduled for dinner, my girlfriend got hit with an urgent work assignment and was clearly not going to be able to join us. I immediately called the restaurant to inform them that I needed to MODIFY my reservation because of this. I was informed I was taken care of and then the restaurant employee immediately hung up. When we arrived at the restaurant​ 2 hours later, hoping to enjoy a pleasant meal together, the restaurant informed us that they had cancelled our reservation. They were completely unapologetic about their error and attempted to blame us, an absurd contention considering why would we come to a restaurant if we had cancelled our reservation mere hours prior. This whole situation could have been avoided if their staff was sufficiently well trained to confirm what they were doing before hanging up the phone. This review could've been avoided if they had the courtesy to admit their mistake and apologize rather than blaming us for their incompetence. As it is, they will never see a penny of my money and they should not see yours either.

3.0,6/12/2017,"I went earlier this year I believe and I could honestly say that the food here is decent. The fact that they took a simple dish like the shrimp and grits and it was more soup than the ""creamy"" texture, I ASSUME, they were going for just made it seem like the dish was doing too much. The shrimp were good though. The grits itself nah. Me and my friend sat at the bar and we didn't get much attention from the girl other than to let us know when are food was ready and if we wanted water, but I can't really penalize her for that bc shes working service and the bar (? She was making everyone's drinks that night)...but overall I didn't really enjoy my meal i just enjoyed the experience of going out and trying something new in NY. Also it may be beside the point but there was a little lack of diversity in the place for a soul food/comfort food spot but I guess that's bc of the location. I'm all about representation ya dig. (But for those who may read into those last two lines, take that sentence with a grain of salt, put in on your plate and digest it or just toss it aside, it's not that deep. Just an observation. :) ) Overall, I encourage you to try root & bone out. And they also have a bar around the corner (like literally right there next to them on the corner) bartender there was a little bored and we could tell bc he was a bit there but the drinks were made well.

The cheese tasted like it was not baked into the noodles but rather sitting on top. Good mac n cheese is creamy/thick and when bitten into has the cheese in every crevice.

Our main was the half basket of fried chicken (4 big pieces), the cheddar waffles and Mac and cheese. Yay for some leftovers!

5.0,6/8/2017,"I am not a bread person, but I tore Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits all the way up and down. It's served as two biscuits, decent sized, on one paddle board. They were so flavorful, soft, buttery inside, and perfectly crusted. The next small plate that hit the table was the Drunken Deviled Eggs. It is indeed a small plate as the eggs were very small, from Brook Farm in Catskills NY. I read somewhere that small eggs often taste better than the more commonly purchased larger eggs, so maybe that has something to do with their decision. Maybe it was for presentation. All I know is they were deliciously pickled and made for a perfect appetizer.I also ordered the buckwheat cheddar waffles, served with bourbon maple syrup. I've read in other reviews that the waffles were small. They were. There were four on the plate, which was more than enough for me, and tasted very different from any waffle I've ever had in the past. I loved every bite but couldn't finish the last one. I took it home, along with a few other items, and it tasted almost as good as when I ordered them. Nothing beats eating food fresh from the kitchen. I don't generally like syrup, but I couldn't resist the bourbon maple syrup. What is this place? Some sort of sorcery, I'm sure.The fried chicken and macaroni n' cheese completed my main meal. I thought the chicken was pretty good. I would have liked the skin to be a bit crispier, but it was cooked well, juicy, and served hot. The mac n ' cheese wasn't bad, but I would've like if they seasoned it more within the dish rather than seemingly just on the top. It was a big serving for a side and I thought more of a shareable item. Now at this point, I am freaking stuffed and expressing out loud how it isn't possible for me to eat any more. The server, who was very attentive throughout our dinner, came back to the table to ask if we were interested in looking at the dessert menu. Um, yes please : )Ok, here's the last of my review: The key lime pie is served in the tiniest glass jar but was well layered and just what I needed before leaving. I love key lime pie, so I'm glad I wasn't disappointed. So so so tasty, perfectly sweetened. And they have ginger beer as a beverage option which bumps them all the way up in my book!I would absolutely come back, with seats reserved. I would probably stay away from visiting on a Saturday or early Sunday. It's a tiny restaurant, as a lot of NY restaurants are. Our table was small, but our server and the kitchen did an excellent job pacing the food so that our table was never overwhelmed with plates.

The fried chicken is a solid four stars I'd say. I prefer crispier skin and this fried chicken lacked enough crisp for me personally, especially on the breast pieces. The legs were far better. The waffles were super average so I'd give it three stars. Relatively soft and tasty waffles but the cheese on top was weird. It was like they simply meted packaged cheese slices on top of the waffle. Didn't improve upon the waffle. The star of my meal was actually the bonuts appetizer. The texture of the biscuit donut fusion was so soft and fluffy. And tasted great with the sugary dipping sauce. Definitely a unique dish that I'd recommend trying! Service was pretty disappointing. Our waiter was really nice, but he did forget my cold brew until I had to ask again halfway through my meal. To be fair, he basically had to wait on all the outside tables on his own.

The food was served miraculously fast and the waitress was able to split our check 4 ways. Would definitely recommend.Cons: the only real issue we had was an ant problem.

The fried chicken was pretty good but the seasoning they put on afterwards makes the chicken kind of salty. We sat by the bar, where a pipe leaked or something and we had to move our table.

I could just sit here and eat them.We were a party of three but didn't order the family style as we felt it was a bit too much food. We had the deviled eggs, hush puppies, fried chicken (whole), grandma's biscuit, Mac and cheese. Perfect portion. Everything was made well. Flavorful and not overly sweet or salty. A good balance.

5.0,5/19/2017,"To the creators of this restaurant: (handshake) you win. Job well done. This restaurant killed it. It's sitting comfortably one floor above and looking down at every other restaurant in Manhattan because this is the best restaurant in Manhattan, bar none. I went to this restaurant with someone who is visiting from another country. He is typically hard to please, not because he's picky. but because the food in the United States is just a giant deviation from what he's used to. He said Root & Bone was the best restaurant he's been to here and in his home country. To sit here and describe each dish would be redundant. Everything we ordered was amazing. This included the fried chicken, the shrimp and grits, the mac and cheese, the deviled eggs, the buckwheat waffles, the key lime pie, the hummingbird cake, and the blueblood drink. I do have to single out those buckwheat waffles, though. This dish might as well have slapped me in the face with the hot waffle iron it was made in because I did not see coming just how good it would be. I knew it would be good, but this was one of the best side dishes I've ever had. Also, kudos to this restaurant for using free range organic chicken. That already gave it an advantage in my book even before I tasted how good it was. My first reservation was for three. I just made another reservation for six.

Pretty much no seating choice as the other option we were given was a 30 minute window to order, eat, pay & go if we chose a table. Sadly, there was an abundant fly population within the restaurant. The 3 small deviled eggs ($7) were tasty. The mac & cheese ($9) was cheesy but unseasoned & served moderately warm. The fried 1/2 chicken ($19) had a tasty coating but must have been fried prior to our arrival and was pretty dry. Only the breast was warm...inside only. The lemonade ($5/ea) was excellent.

5.0,5/14/2017,"This is going to be a smidge different beloveds. What you're about to read is a review of an amazing brunch that I had the pleasure of participating in. Everything was great from the service to the ambiance to the food. What makes this brunch so different from 99% of my brunches is that.............IT WASN'T BOTTOMLESS! Yes, yes I know you're probably thinking ""how could you do a non-bottomless brunch? What does that even mean?"" Honestly nobody knows what it means, but it's provocative. It simply keeps the people going.   Root & Bone sports a minimalist décor. The white walls and rustic furniture really presents a homey vibe when you walk into the restaurant and prepares you for the type of dining experience you're about to have. The staff is extremely pleasant and have a smile on every time they approach you. The odd thing about it is, the smiles actually seemed genuine and truly caring.We were treated like the true world class foodies we think we are and were blessed with seating at the kitchen counter. To give you an idea of how good the food is, prior to eating we were a chatty bunch, catching up on each other's lives and marveling at the chefs preparing each meal. However, once the food was placed in front of us, we became completely mute. There are plenty of farm to table options available at this establishment that prides themselves in using the freshest of ingredients. While there is plenty of variety, I double dog dare you to turn your head away from the golden and angelic fried chicken that is served here (one of my eating mates actually did it and it worked out well for her, but still). My bird plate of choice was the Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich (two crispy pieces of fried chicken, waffles, pickled green tomato, melted cheddar & pickles). The most important part of the dish is obviously the chicken and it definitely does not disappoint. The perfect crisp and crunch comes alive when the steel of your fork and knife makes contact with the bird (hope you see the irony in that bar). The green tomato adds the perfect amount of tang as well to the dish. Dash this dish with a few liberal drops of the hot sauce and perfection is attained. A wise man by the name of Fabolous once said ""you know the entrée ain't as good without something on the side"". While normally living by such a statement could put you at risk for countless almost life threatening issues, at Root & Bone it's possibly the best decision you could make. The big leaf smoked chipotle collard greens sprinkled with crispy garlic and the mac & cheese with biscuit thyme crust are the perfect down home compliments for whatever dish you pick. To finish off our trip down south we decided to each find the smallest crevice in our stomachs to have room for the delicious Bonuts. These it was as if the chefs fried up the clouds from the heavens and then sprinkled it with shaved gold from a cinnamon mountain. The brunch gawds move in such mysterious ways. Never did I think that I would sit at the table and enjoy meal that didn't come accompanied with the bottomless nectar. Thank you brunch gawds for showing me this new trail. Let's see what else lies down it.Read this review and more others from me at mobettereats.com",0,3,2,Denzyl A.,"Plainfield, NJ",509,119,131
5.0,5/14/2017,"Just had a wonderful Mother's Day Lunch.  First off, I made a reservation using a new app called VocoLife.  When we arrived, the restaurant did not have us in their system even though I could see the reservation on my phone.  The host and manager were very apologetic and accommodated us anyway.Our party was my two teenaged sons and me.  My son's can eat, so we ordered a lot of food and shared everything.  I had a sparkling rose and the boys had iced tea. Started with grandma's biscuits and an order of Bonuts.  There are only two biscuits but they are very large.  The bonuts are more of a dessert to me but the boys loved them.  We also had a spring salad which was very light and tasty with strawberries, radishes and sunflower seeds.Then we shared 1/2 bucket of chicken with waffles, Mac n cheese, and shrimp n grits.  The chicken was absolutely delicious, not greasy at all with a hint of lemon.  The waffles had melted cheddar, I wasn't sure if the boys would like them but they loved them.  The mac n cheese was, to quote my 17 year old, ""absurd.""  We had so much food we couldn't fully enjoy the grits but after eating the shrimp we took the rest home.  The dish is full of tomatoes, corn and pork belly so I am sure it will be great when we reheat later.We skipped dessert, but everything we saw looked great!  My sons declared Root N Bone ""our new spot"" and I agree!",0,0,0,Liz H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,1

5.0,5/13/2017,"MORE than finger lickin good. Everything is well crafted and amazing here at root & bone. I came once for brunch and I only remember their omelette to be nothing special, but their specialty ain't really omelettes anyway, it's their FRIED BIRD and southern comfort foods!!Just came back for dinner today and everything we got was amazing. Between the two of us, we shared the prettiest deviled eggs there ever was, sugar snap pea salad with asparagus, ricotta salata, crispy ham dressed with lemon oil, a half bucket of bird and buckwheat waffle with cheddar. The deviled eggs were DECADENT! So creamy. A great appetizer. The snap peas/asparagus was amazing too, came chopped up and not at all like how we imagined it to be like but it was everything we didn't know we wanted. Super refreshing and crunchy with that lemony dressing and the salty crunchy ham was perfect. The fried chicken was, of course, out of this world delicious. I love the mixture of herbs (dill+parsley) and you can really taste the lemon dust - it's what make root n bones birds so special! The spiked Tabasco honey was also PERFECT. Please get the waffles along with the fried chicken there has and never will be a better marriage than those two plus the hot sauce + whiskey maple syrup. Please just do yourself a favor and order this. It's what you came for. At this point we were already very full but we went ahead and ordered the Apple pie with bourbon ice cream for dessert. SO GOOD! Just like a tarte aux pommes you'd get in Paris. Generous amount of perfectly cooked and cinnamony thinly sliced apples arranged beautifully in a beautiful pie pastry that was crunchy around the edges and soft on the insides. Went well with the ice cream but man we were inhaling this as fast as we could because the ice cream was melting so fast! The dessert was also not too sweet and just the right size for two to share. Amazing. We were super full by the end of this meal so we were glad we didn't do the family style dinner at $35pp because that might have been way too much food. But it's a great option if you're super hungry and want to try everything!Staff is always friendly and the decor is just beautiful - very bright, rustic, and the plates are just ... beautiful!",2,2,1,Karen C.,"New York, NY",226,66,321

2.0,5/11/2017,"Prior to last night, this spot was where I would take friends and family to impress them. I'm sad to say I may not be returning anytime soon. I'd made a reservation and ran a half hour late due to traffic on the NJ turnpike. The hostess was most accommodating and still honored my reservation when we arrived. The food was ok. After looking around at other patrons, we felt that ordering the shrimp n grits and short rib meatloaf was a tragic mistake. Get the chicken or the ribs. My shrimp were slimy like they weren't quite done and the meatloaf was ehh, whatever. My waiter didn't really pay us much attention after we ordered and we kept having to flag him down to get anything. The worst part of the experience was that I'd purchased a Gilt City deal for this meal. You get $100 worth of food and drink for $65. While perusing the dessert menu, a woman came to us from the bar with a bill that she'd created adding up our order and including extra stuff on it to make it 100 so that she could tell me that I was still responsible for the tax. Umm ok. We weren't done and this was a gift for my mother. She came to my mother with this fake bill, so it was tacky and awkward. My mom got really upset that this woman would do that considering we were still eating and she wasn't paying. It felt like they were trying to rush us out. We ended up leaving immediately since what we ordered didn't amount to what my deal came up to anyway. I figure with all that rudeness, they could figure out the tax and tip that remained.

Where to begin with this appealing, mouth watering menu? Adult beverages yes, all hailing from the USA. I sampled a red and rose, both excellent. It's hard enough to find good wine at a wine bar, let alone a fried chicken place. Speaking of fried chicken... get the half bird and add on sides from there. Went with collards and the grits with pimento cheese. Probably the least healthy meal I've had in my adult life. But man, it WAS GOOD!!  Slightly salty, moist bird with a flavorful crunch coating. Save room for dessert, several of them served in individual jars. Saw the donuts on an adjoining table. That's not my thing but if they are, they were fluffy and coated in sugar! Leon went with key lime pie in a jar, he raved about it.  The decor is something to talk about as well.  Homey, comfy, white washed brick and patina, mixed match plates and water served in mason jars.

Arrive and am told rudely by the host that OpenTable was not set right on their end and they actually didn't have a table/had left me a non-existent voicemail (didn't even have s missed call). Rather than try to resolve or even apologize, the staff ganged up on me, starting verbally attacking me, and then said they would try to fit me in in ~60-90 mins.

5.0,5/5/2017,"Well, this is a really tough review for me. Tough because I cannot decide between a 4 and a 5. I just kept energizer bunny'ing this place (eating and eating and eating). If someone doesn't get that reference feel free to stop reading anything I write you might be too young.I would do my normal breakdown by each individual item, but this place has produced the best single bite of any place in new york and here is a replay on how that all went down:Quarter piece of the cheddar waffle, fried chicken, spicy sauce, bourbon syrup, mac n cheese and a little bit of ribs. O to the M to the G this place took my taste buds on a journey any tongue would be jealous of. Waffle isn't too dense with delicious cheddar on top for sweet and savory delight. Chicken is so juicy and has all the essential spices (and essential oils I guess). Mac N cheese is well baked, with just enough ooey gooey cheese the make you feel at home. The ribs added a little back country flare. And last but not least the spicy sauce gave it an awesome kick and the syrup cooled your mouth down right after. Each part alone was delicious each part together, unstoppable.Also, had some cole slaw which had a great amount of ginger to take you far east, and some desserts; key lime pie, which was the right color and the right tartness. Donuts and coffee... which is a misnomer... donuts and coffee ice cream. Tasted like a churro with a little more fluff. The perfect end to a perfect first day.THE VERDICT:I still don't know what to give it!! I haven't given a five star in a while because they are so sacred and feel like people have higher expectations of places I give five stars. (That's my ego talking). However, I can get around the ""as good as it gets"" because it might just be as good as it gets for a combination bite. Best bite I may have ever had in my vida. Alright... I am pulling this trigger on this one... going 5. Although you already know that because it says it up above.. Spoiler alert. Trust me writing this end was way more exciting than reading it.

It's good for groups  and intimate enough for couples. Servers are polite and attentive. I would definitely recommend this place and will be coming back anytime I want fried chicken.,0,0,1,Deepa S.,"Corona, NY",1,2,2
3.0,4/2/2017,"I don't often venture into the East Village, though the neighborhood is so familiar from my college days. If I was still local and near Alphabet City, Root & Bone would be a staple in my restaurant routine. Nice service, good comfort food, decent prices. For brunch today I enjoyed the Biscuits with honey, and also the Apple Cobbler dessert. The Popcorn Shrimp special was OK, but the reason popcorn shrimp works so well is that the shrimp is usually baby or small, and the batter gets nice and firm. These shrimp were just too big and not fried quite long enough. Overall, I enjoyed the experience, and would go back.",4,0,1,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",749,1181,35

The chicken was previously fried and sort-of reheated, making it both dry and lukewarm.The nice waitperson promptly offered to replace the orders. And did.Not much better. We took some tastes and left the rest with a complaint. They clearly saw the disappointment and decided not to charge us at all.

I was already disappointed in my last visit because the ""whole bird"" that we got was cold, how can you serve COLD fried chicken!? This time the whole bird was warmer than the previous visit but still bad. It seems like they precook the chicken and didn't reheat it well when they serve it, not only that but the skin was also saggy, had a grayish color and it was DRY.

They also have a hot sauce that's the perfect mix of honey and tabasco-sooo good sprinkled on top of the chicken. Also, I recommend the deviled eggs, the waffles, the mac and cheese, and the chicken and dumpling soup (not sure if this is still on the menu). My only regret is that I haven't been able to try their dessert, which looks scrumptious. I'm usually too full from dinner to even think about having dessert.

Tonight I went with the braised short rib meatloaf and the mac n cheese. Both dishes were well presented. Starting with the meatloaf; it had a nice char on the outside but personally it  was a bit dry for my taste. Everything else from the char carrots and potatoes were fine. As far as the mac n cheese goes, nothing wrong with sauce. But personally the pasta was just a little bit undercooked.Overall I had an alright experience.

4.0,2/14/2017,"My first trip to Root & Bone was about a year ago for a custom roasted chicken feast that was phenomenal!  The chicken had been slathered in herbs and extremely juicy.  There was also an included buffet of sides that were just as heavenly.  So, I was really looking forward to my second visit.  On both occasions, we were able to book tables, though patrons can also dine at the small bar or chef's counter.  All of the seating options are extremely cramped, though, but with food that inspired, it was worth it.  The service was also stellar both times - attentive, friendly, knowledgeable.Now on to the best part - the cuisine!  We had decided to share a bunch of their rich menu items in an effort to spread the calorie wealth.  The Cornbread Soufflé was served in a small cast-iron skillet and possessed the texture of a fluffy, whipped custard more than a bread-like consistency.  The dish was best eaten with a spoon and really needed the accompanying maple butter for flavor.  Cornbread is one of my favorite things, so I was really hoping for that skilled balance of dry corn and sweet cake; this soufflé just did not measure up.  However, the chopped chunks of Butternut Squash in our other starter were served with grilled apples,  aged goat cheese, bourbon maple, pumpkin seeds, and country ham chips.  The seasonal and smoky flavors were truly Southern, and the crisp pieces of ham were a wise selection for adding a salty, crunchy kick.  The Braised Short Rib Meatloaf was also outstanding!   The short rib had been baked into squares and topped with a savory tomato jam.  The meat was served over buerre blanc potatoes and sweet peas, while charred carrots were draped over the meat.  Lastly, we accompanied the short rib with a side of fried Brussels Sprouts.  The crispy leaves had first been marinated with a bourbon sorghum sauce, which had added a sweetness to them.  Just when you would think the sprouts were perfectly crunchy, they were plated with pickled serrano ham and bacon croutons for added munchability and spice.The country-style décor and comforting eats made Root & Bone a complete Southern immersion everyone should experience.",11,3,7,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1125,1410,640

Still delicious, but the biscuits were very different and the chicken here was a little crispier and fattier which I'm sure most people really like/prefer but it wasn't my favorite.

4.0,2/7/2017,"My husband and I went here for lunch on Saturday at 1:15 pm because I had a craving for chicken and waffles and this place is well known for that. It was in NoHo so we decided to park our car in Chinatown and ride the train to the restaurant. We had to walk about half a mile because of some late train schedules but it was worth the extra cardio. I was smart enough to make reservations the day before because when we finished, the wait for a table was at least an hour and knowing my husband, he would not wait. Upon arrival, we were greeted and seated right away. This place was tight with cafe style tables and chairs and everyone sitting closely together. It gave off a very quaint vibe with country like decorations all over the restaurant, which was also reflected in the cups.  After all that walking, my husband and I decided to order a whole fried bucket of bird (chicken, same thing) with a side of buckwheat cheddar waffles. The food came out fairly quick along with Tabasco hot sauce for the chicken and maple whiskey syrup for the waffles. The chicken tasted amazing, crispy, full of flavor and very moist in your mouth even without any sauces. My only complaint is the 2 large pieces of breasts (that I dislike but had to eat it anyway), if only you were able to choose the type of meat you wanted (dark meat please). As you all know, white meat chicken is bland and often dry. The waffles were equally as amazing with some melted cheddar cheese and chopped scallion on top.

1.0,2/5/2017,"A mediocre experience, at best. This highly reviewed fried chicken joint is all hype, and no delivery. We found the chicken (fried, half chicken) to be lacking crispness, and horribly dry on the inside. I suspect the lack of crispness is due to an over brined meat and too low a cooking temperature. The tough dry, dry meat likely attributable to just old chicken, overcome to compensate for the low temperature.Nothing else was particularly commendable - the biscuits felt like cement, the salad mediocre, and the mac and cheese, well, who can screw up a mac and cheese!?Finally, the waitress was surly and abrupt.

4.0,1/30/2017,"Root and Bone, like it's Miami based sister-restaurant, Yardbird, is an excellent modern take on standard southern fare and it excels on many many levels. We stopped in here on Sunday afternoon for a late brunch and drinks. First thing to note is, if you can, make a reservation on OpenTable. When they get busy, without a reservation, you will be waiting for a while. The dining room is fun with a rustic, old-school southern feel to it, and some nice bar seating looking out the window. We did the brunch special designed for restaurant week, which is a nice mix of a lot of food for $29/person. You really can't go long. I had the Chicken and Waffle sandwich while my GF had the sausage and biscuits. For apps, we split the salad and deviled eggs. The entrees come with a side of Mac and Cheese and Collared Greens and finally we had both desserts, the Key Lime and Mississippi Mud pies. Wow, is all I can say. Everything was excellent. If anything, there was almost too much food. One warning, for folks who don't like savory and sweet mixed, you may not love the Chicken and Waffle sandwich, as the waffle as a hint of sweetness in it. The Mac and Cheese was also excellent, and if you've read any of my recent reviews, you'll know my love of restaurant Mac and Cheese has seriously waned to the point that i will no longer order it. Root and Bone has saved me there. The deviled eggs were also surprisingly tasty and since they are small, I recommend trying to finish them in one bit as all the flavors mix better that way. Trying to cut it in half meant losing some of the flavor synergy.One last item of the note, and probably the only reason I am not giving Root and Bone five stars, at one point during our meal, our waitress vanished and it took us a while and two more staff to flag down help for dessert and the bill. We were finally helped and finished our meal, and while I doubt this is indicative of their normal service, it was a small issue with an otherwise excellent meal.

They serve a large waffle with perfectly cooked large pieces of fried chicken.Son, this is the lower east side hipster hive!The brunch size Fried Chicken & Waffle sandwich, even thought the waffles at first glance looks small, this is a right size food portion. I'm trying to compare this dish to a deconstructed candy bar. When the dish was served to me, I separated the items and started:The Chicken: Lightly breaded, juicy and flavorful. I cut pieces of the chicken topped with melted cheddar along with the pickled green tomatoes made this dish a nice entree.The sides: Mac & Cheese and Collard GreensThe Mac & Cheese is heavenly! I hate when M&C is brought to you and it gets all gloppy. Or its all watery and fake tasting. Not here at Root & Bone. The M&C was a nice cheesy blend and the macaroni was cooked just right. Taking a bite of chicken, then some M&C, then a piece of collard greens, made this a very tasty meal.The deviled eggs:Everyone makes them, its simple. But to have a talented chef put their spin on the dish? I was given two, I could have eaten 10.I now have left the two small Belgium sandwich waffles. I'm like a kid when I eat pancakes or waffles, I like to drown them in syrup. The waiter brought to the table a maple-bourbon syrup. Cool! To get the syrup out, it poured like a small hot sauce bottle. I had to keep shaking it and drops would come out! I shook that bottle until I had the right amount of syrup to enjoy my waffles.I also had a bourbon cocktail but I forget the name, it tied it all together and made everything enjoyable.Finally dessert.

4.0,1/23/2017,"A bit of a walk from any major subways, but its not too far from the bus stop.Weekend brunch times can be busy.  I was able to snag a table by the kitchen at 12:45p Sunday. Not the most comfortable seating by the bar/kitchen since I had my big winter coat and the coat hook under the table was broken.Ordered the Fried Chicken Waffle Sandwich and the Shrimp with Grits, with a side of Mac and Cheese.  Sitting by the kitchen and watching the cooks making magic, I was able to witness how clean and efficient they are.  The heat from the stove was warming, especially on a cold winter day.Fried Chicken Waffles tasted pretty good, however one of the waffles wasn't as crispy as the other one.  Flavor-wise, the fried chicken was pretty well seasoned, however it can be dry at times.Shrimp and grits came with about 6 - 8 good medium sized shrimps.  The grits were made al dente/well done and saltiness level was acceptable.Mac and cheese is probably a must order since its so good.  This was the highlight of the meal.Overall, it was enough food for leftovers during my afternoon cravings.Service was attentive and major credit cards are all accepted.    When it's crowded, this restaurant can be tight and cramped.  You will most likely talk over the customers sitting over behind and next to you.  So, keep your secrets and personal conversations on the down low.If you have a big coat, I would recommend you request a coffee table with regular chairs.

2.0,1/22/2017,"Nowhere near as good as the Miami original - Yardbird. I came here in the summer and was able to sit outside and had a much better experience overall than the brunch I had this past Monday (MLK). We ordered the chicken & waffle sandwich, the deviled eggs and shrimp and grits. Unfortunately, the deviled eggs were the best part of the meal. We were sitting at the chefs table bar and had a full view of the kitchen. The staff did not seem to be professional chefs and were wearing filthy clothes. I'm not typically one to nit pick on something like this, but it was hard to go unnoticed when they're standing right in front of you. The majority of their menu (outside of egg dishes) is pre-prepared and on a warmer waiting for your order. We saw about a dozen waffles sitting there. And the chicken for the waffle sandwich is just reheated. Definitely not fresh out of the fryer. The combination of the soggy old waffle and the soggy chicken was barely edible. The shrimp and grits were ok, but no where near as good as I've had elsewhere.",1,0,0,Sasha B.,"Manhattan, NY",192,899,45

4.0,1/17/2017,"As a southern transplant, I'm on a perpetual hunt for shrimp & grits, which will forever be my favorite food. My friend found this place, and when she told me we were going to consume some southern, chicken-and-waffles fare, I was excited, but thought that it'd probably be no different than all the other incredible, gastropub-y chicken and waffles I've had in Philly.I was definitely correct in that it was incredible and gastropub-y, but I was very wrong in thinking it'd be no different because it was actually quite different in style. All their food was adorned with cheddar and spring onions, which gave it a bit of a different taste. Not traditionally southern, but really good. I would say, though, that that is also my reason to knock a star off: EVERYTHING had cheddar and spring onions on it. It was a bit much. My $25 plate of shrimp and grits was huge and extremely filling and full of juicy shrimp. They definitely did not skimp on portion size, which is always a gamble with shrimp and grits. We got the mac and cheese and also a side of waffles (which was four soft waffles with melted cheddar on top), both of which were mouthwatering.The place is small, and the ambiance is cozy, minimalist, and non-assuming.

Hint of sweet, with herbs and awesome juiciness!)The not so awesome: the space-uber small, sort of cramped for me. The staff- not bad by any means, bit just blah. Like ""I'm here and that's all you're gonna get outta me today"" vibe. The apple crisp with ?bourbon ice cream- forgettable, ice cream tasted regular and the apple crust wasn't the buttery, crispy goodness I'd expected.

As someone who actually owns and runs a Southern-influenced restaurant, I'm happy to say that R&B were totally on the money.Decor and ambience are great - pared-down rustic chic, homely and inviting. A very apposite setting for elevated Southern cuisine.Staff were consistently friendly, capable and switched on. Surprised at the 1 star reviews suggesting poor service - either we lucked out and got the good servers, or perhaps people receive the service they invite ...Wine list is excellent - progressive and interesting offerings with a strong emphasis on USA wine - Schramsberg sparkling rosé was awesome. Strong whiskey list too, including some rare pours. Weller Antique 107 was a welcome find.As to the food - consistently some of the best Southern cooking I've had, and that's from someone who's spent a lot of time in the South. Both Grits and Mac & Cheese were triumphant, buckwheat waffles inspired and perfectly executed (a welcome savoury twist). Biscuits were exemplary, as was the 'cornbread soufflé' which also came with an impeccable cornbread for contrast. Maple pork chop was perfectly cooked, and the mashed potato and gravy sublime. Short rib meatloaf was a very welcome twist on a classic. Fried chicken was excellent.Absolutely zero hesitation in strongly recommending this place, a real highlight.

I purposely left 10% because of the awful service my friends and I received. My friends and I all had an additional 10% added. Aside from the clear dishonest staff who also are slow and uninviting, the food here is also mediocre. My fried chicken was luke-warm at best and the waffles were soggy. I think the food had been sitting out for a while, which probably explains why it took so long to actually get the food. When we wanted our checks, we sat there for about 15 minutes awkwardly staring at the waitor who did not notice us. I for up and asked for the check.

The chicken was awesome and fried to order. The grits deserve a special shoutout, as they were the best grits I've ever had. That shouldn't be taken lightly since I'm a southern gal and have had the opportunity to taste some authentic grits. Both the mac and cheese and waffles were cooked to perfection and flavorful. The food is EXCELLENT. However, the design of the restaurant is very uncomfortable. It is not handicapped accessible, nor is it suitable for families. My boyfriend and I managed, but I kept thinking,- wow, I wonder how difficult it must be for some people to move around in this place. The tables are so close to each other you can hear everyone's conversation which is awkward. The table next to me kept dropping their plates and silverware because of lack of space, which was annoying but understandable. I wish this restaurant had more space and was executed differently.

We went on a weekday and made a reservation the night before for 1pm. The place was pretty full but there was no wait (it was also gross weather out though) and we were seated immediately. The inside has a very cute charming quality to it. There's an open kitchen where you can see the chef preparing the meal if you care to. My friend and I ordered the Fried Chicken Biscuit Sandwich and the Benedict Waffle to share. The Benedict waffle was sooooo good. Something about the sweetness of the waffle mixed into the savory goodness of the poached egg. The chicken biscuit sandwich was also amazing- a little hard to eat but we ended up just breaking down the sandwich into little pieces with a knife and fork. We didn't get any drinks or dessert because we were just too full (the meal is pretty heavy). The service was decent- nothing exceptional.

Now, the chicken was very juicy while crispy on the outside. However, the chicken was a little too salty. The seasoning is too overwhelming for me where there is too much going on. You can taste the oregano and herb but there's something about it that makes it confusing. It's just too much. We also ordered the biscuits app. $7 for 2 pieces?! Come on. It reminded me of a KFC biscuit that's very dense. It was good but not the best. We also ordered the mac and cheese. It was legit! Very cheesy, bread crumbs were a nice touch and just damn good.

It was practically empty inside, which I didn't mind. I actually liked that it wasn't packed. The two guys that were tending to us that day were super sweet and kind, not super talkative or bothersome like many other waiters I've encountered. They come by once in a while to ask how everything is, which is greatly appreciated, as they fill our empty cups of water. My sister ordered a ginger ale and I just stuck to plain old water. When my sister tried the ginger ale, it was a bit too strong for her liking. The very attentive waiter, who made the drink, came over and asked how it was. When she told him it was a bit strong, he gladly offered to take it back and water it down just a bit to make it less powerful. That was so sweet of him and probably not possible if the place was packed with people. We ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich (duh) and the half bird. We had a lot of fried chicken as a result of our menu choices but... you can't control us! We love fried chicken! The chicken and waffle sandwich, oh my Lord, there is a good reason why it's so dang popular. IT IS SIMPLY DIVINE.

The fried chicken bites on the biscuits were crispy and juicy, the biscuits themselves were light, the short rib was falling apart, the collard greens were smoky and delicious and the mac n' cheese was equally good.  If it sounds like a lot, it was... but we took some home, so we could fit in dessert and we were glad we did because both the apple pie and sweet potato cheesecake were amazing, we almost licked the plates clean.  To top it off, the service was great, super attentive, but not in your face and just genuinely friendly.  We will definitely be back to try the fried chicken and waffles....",0,0,0,Rob C.,"Enmore, Australia",0,10,0

Upon walking in, you see all the yummy desserts on display. The dining section is divided into two rooms. I've been meaning to try this place for a while now and since everything looked so good, I wanted to try them all! Hate menus like this! But love it all at the same time :) we ordered the bucket of half fried chicken with waffles added, angel biscuits, bonuts (only offered in Saturdays and Sundays), farmer's omelette, Mac & cheese. This was for 2 people :D of course there were leftovers we packed to go. The Mac and cheese looked better than it tasted. To be honest, it didn't really do it for me the way it did for others. I found the macaroni to be too hard. I'm used to really soft Mac and cheese. The angel biscuits were also decent. They didn't have much flavor, the texture was also very doughy, but I did like how they had sea salt and sesame to garnish the biscuit for taste. The fried chicken was really good. The skin was so crispy and the dark meat was so juicy and tender. It also had some sea salt + zesty lemon taste to them. This is a must get. The waffles was good in that I really enjoyed the texture. The was crispy on the outside and super fluffy on the inside...really really fluffy. Last but not least, the bonuts! The bonuts were oh em gee! That is also a must get! It was so fresh and hot, probably one of the better or best donuts I've had. It was pretty awesome. Probably best eaten fresh since it comes out hot, won't be good packed to go. Outside had cinnamon. I would come back to try some other things.",2,1,2,Priscilla C.,"Davis, CA",202,370,1876

4.0,11/20/2016,I met some friends for dinner here during Restaurant week and had a great time. The restaurant was a lot smaller than I imagined after reading the reviews. I felt a bit cramped sitting so close to other patrons. Our server was real cool and attentive.For starters I had the Grandma Daisy Angel biscuit that had honey roast chicken jus and they were delicious. I had a dipping sauce that reminded me of molasses. For an entree I ordered the fried chicken and waffles and they were very tasty and delicious. One of my greedy friends had ordered the short ribs and after tasting my chicken had ordered some chicken to go. :-) For dessert I ordered the ice cream sandwich that was butter pecan ice-cream with two caramel sweet waffles as the sandwich. I was disappointed in dessert and wished the sandwich portion was a cookie and not another waffle.  My friends enjoyed their meals and drinks. We all had the spiked peach iced tea which was good with not too much alcohol since I am not a big drinker.I would definitely check this spot out again to try some other menu items.,3,1,1,Teresa S.,"Forest Hills, NY",322,1160,2912
5.0,11/19/2016,"Finally made it down to Root and Bone after months of mooning over their menu. Originally we had a blackboard eats deal but everything on the regular menu looked so good we decided to order off that instead. They have a great wine list, and small cocktail and beer list. The first cocktail my husband ordered was delicious but when I ordered the same drink it came our tasting much different - I'm not certain why but maybe it's best to stick to the wine and beer. The food: we had the biscuits, a whole fried bird, Brussels sprouts, deviled eggs, and grits. It was plenty for 4 people. Everyone got 2 pieces of bird which was fried to perfection and served piping hot. They break it down nicely so it's easy to get your favorite parts. It's nice and juicy and not overly greasy. It's exactly what fried chicken dreams are made of. And biscuits. Sweet god in heaven I want to use them for delicious edible pillows. Light and fluffy with a perfect crust. They're so delicate I don't know how they got them on the plate without having them fall apart. They're soaked in a delicious honey and served with toasted sesame and sea salt and what I think was a chicken au jus. Holy hell I could have made a meal out those and been happy as a clam. Please don't skip the biscuits.The grits is not your standard porridge slop. It's served in a piping hot cast iron with pimento cheese and bread crumbs broiled to crispy perfection. It's delicious and cheesy and crunchy and I will definitely order that again.The sprouts and deviled eggs are delicious as well, they just couldn't stand up to the biscuits and chicken as a flavor bomb but they were excellent additions to round out our meal. The portion sizes and prices here are just right. You don't feel like a glutton when you leave but you feel satisfied. And your wallet isn't all that much lighter assuming you don't go hog wild with the drinks. It's a small space and it's certainly cozy.

I mean c'mon.. pork belly with poached eggs?!  I was slightly disappointed when I saw the pork belly was on the side... it would've been nicer if it was right below the poached eggs but nonetheless it was a good dish!  The waffle was super fluffy and thick and surprisingly a really good combo with the poached eggs!Mac & Cheese ($9.00): big pasta, crunchy cheese and biscuit herb crust.  I love their mac and cheese!  It does not taste heavy AT ALL and the herb crust really gave a nice crunch to the macaroni.  The only thing I have to complain about this dish is the portion... it was a bit small for 9 bucks!Overall, a very positive experience and would recommend!",5,2,5,Racheal D.,"Brooklyn, NY",664,230,516

It was the most delicious fried chicken I have ever had and it felt kinda healthy (for what it's worth) so I definitely could see myself getting carried away with it...dangerously delicious fried chicken that could potentially multiple my waist size. One of my friends found the lemon taste to be slightly overwhelming but the rest of us had no problem with it. For sides, we ordered this butternut squash and peaches thing that I can't remember the name of but it was so freakin good omg thinking about it makes me sad that I won't be having it any time soon.

One thing thou, I found the dish on - very salty end.Fried chickens were nice and juicy - again a tad on the salty end but not too much.I like how they did the white meat as even the breasts were juicy.The two sauces (bourbon maple, Tabasco) went very well with the chickens and waffles.I was sooo impressed by their bourbon maple syrup - it was sweet, bourbon smokey, light and smells like heaven...

This Southern spot brings all the delicious must haves comfort food all into one menu.We ordered the Crispy Fried Bucket of Bird perfect for sharing. It was crispy and juicy with a nice flavor of lemon- def recommend you try this. Another must have is the Macaroni & Cheese! They use large-sized elbow pasta with crunchy cheese and biscuit & thyme crust. The top is crunchy and you break through this layer of baked cheese to meet the googey mac & cheese on the bottom- this dish puts all the other regular mac & cheese to shame. And the Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits are amazing! If you ever see the word ""Grandma"" in the name of a dish - don't kid yourself and GET THE DISH. It was buttery, fluffy and so savory. The Waffle Benedict didn't really stand out to me and neither did the Cheddar Waffles. They were both bland and not memorable dishes.

I was quite curious to try it out since I'm not very familiar with Southern fare.Pros:- The ambience and decor feel rustic.- Buckwheat waffles were really nice and fluffy. They were topped with cheese, although I think a sweeter flavor would have been nicer go with the chicken.- Bucket of chicken: quite tender, juicy and well seasoned. I appreciate the fact that it wasn't overly breaded (very light batter). The wings and drumsticks were much better than the breasts. The skins of the breast pieces have some crusted seasoning that were really salty. Cons:- Shrimp and grits are decent but really pricy at $25.- Brussel sprouts are drenched in syrup, it was like eating burnt sugar.- Baked broccoli was swimming in cheddar. The broccoli was overcooked and tasted like it was boiled before baking (yikes). I was imagining some crunchy greens with crusted cheese on top.Overall, I think the food is pretty mediocre for the price.

Once we arrived at 6:30 to insure a table, we informed the ""walk ins"" are only aloud to eat at the bar. Now that's fun for 5 people at a Bon Voyage party, NOT!

It was 2 blocks away and already had great reviews. My friend called ahead and asked if we could put our names down because we were literally two minutes away. The person who answered said you had to reserve in person but that it wasn't a long wait. It took us less than a minute to walk there, and when we got there, the person taking the names said that we had to wait 45 minutes because someone just reserved a table.. (Quite annoyed at hearing that) We waited for a little over an hr, but it was to be expected because we were in a prime area for brunch and it was Saturday afternoon.   While we were waiting, I saw a girl get up and move from her seat. She was running around a little bit and I thought she was drunk. I asked what the problem was, and she said she's allergic to bee stings,and that there were a lot of bees in the outdoor seating. We had hoped to be seated inside(since I don't do bees either)but the next available seats were outside. We took it l,but I was not happy.  I know it's summer, and flying things are inevitable, but geez.. The bees!!    We started to look over the menu and a certain item caught my eye. It was the waffle benedict. It was poached eggs on 2 mini waffles with pork belly bacon on the side. It was DELICIOUS! I wish it came with a bigger portions! My friends ordered the fried chicken and waffles sandwiches and the braised short rib and eggs. Everything tasted so good. The downside was the mac and cheese. It was too much melted cheese that was a little watery in my opinion. The actual dish tasted like Velveeta's finest which is not awesome in my book.

Seated high enough that we don't seem on top of the outside tables but can see their meals and pick what looks good. It ALL looks good. The fried chicken waffles sandwichs look heavenly decadent but too heavy for us. I opt for the tomato sandwich with Dukes mayo on sourdough toast. Sept tomatoes are sooo yummy, it was great. Companions both ordered the shrimp and grits. I'm a southern girl and the grits pass my discerning taste test. The guys are big eaters though and the potions were small. Or both :)Extended our visit with cups of coffee and a berry tart. Blueberries were plump & sweet. We Åland a bite.

4.0,9/13/2016,"My fiancé and I went to Root & Bone last night for our 8yr anniversary after hearing rave reviews from varied sources. We started off with the Angel Biscuits, which comes with a side of some type of syrup and seeds and sea salt that you can add on. These biscuits were just heavenly!My fiancé ordered the fresh lemonade, and I ordered the hibiscus pomegranate tea. Both were much too sweet. However, we squeezed the lemon wedge that sits on the glass into each of our drinks, and that helped to cut the sweetness, and wound up ordering another round, it was so good.For our main course, we ordered the half fried chicken with buckwheat cheddar waffles, and the spare ribs with a side of mac n cheese. My fiancé said the chicken was the best flavored chicken he had ever had, BUT it was a little dry. Hopefully the fried chicken was just dry last night and that is not usually how it is.  He's also had buckwheat cheddar waffles elsewhere and said he's never actually liked them, but he really liked these.My spare ribs had a tasty sauce on them but the meat itself lacked some flavor. The mac n cheese was probably one of the best I've ever had at a restaurant. And I try mac n cheese everywhere I go! It wasn't too creamy or watery, the noodles weren't too soft or hard, but just right. The biscuit topping worked really well with the dish. All in all, we would definitely come back again.

3.0,9/12/2016,"Had been wanting to go to Root & Bone for a while.  Definitely picked the wrong night to eat fried chicken with it being 90+ degrees and humid outside while the restaurant had a weak A/C system!  The tables are super cramped, making it uncomfortable to sit next to someone.  Service was good but food was just okay.  -angel biscuits - the top was delicious, but the bottom was too dense/heavy for me-watermelon salad - such a waste.  literally served chopped up watermelon in a small bowl.  -mac&cheese - pretty good-grits - not a fan, but others loved it-fried chicken - needed to be MUCH crispier Do no not waste your time ordering the other entrees - the BF & his friend ordered the spare ribs and meatloaf and didn't love either.  All in all, I'm glad I can say I crossed it off the list but definitely won't be back and don't recommend it either.  Hope to try Bobwhite Counter and see if it's any better!",4,1,0,Danielle M.,"New York, NY",396,512,41

The biscuit was fluffy and buttery and the chicken to biscuit ratio was perfect. The fried chicken bucket itself was totally worth it. We got Mac and cheese and grits as sides, both very good. We tried the ribs entree and was really disappointed. The ribs were not cooked well and tasted like they just covered it in sauce and served. What was most disappointing was the service, our server took our order and never came back! We had to track her down to get the check; if it was a busier night I would've been more forgiving but it was pretty late Friday night and half the tables were empty.

He explained the process of how they make their  coating for the chicken.  I'm just going to say - WOW - super time consuming, but I applaud the effort.  Everything from placing the chicken in brine, to dehydrating lemons -grinning them into powder.  We also tried the deviled eggs and to-die-for biscuits.  Go - you'll like it!  Trust me.",1,0,1,Steven M.,"Miamisburg, OH",16,13,11
4.0,9/4/2016,"My first visit was during Restaurant Week. The menu during Restaurant Week impressed me; the shrimp and grits made me really want to come back. My second visit was this weekend for brunch. I almost got the shrimp and grits but decided to try the chicken and waffles, Mac and cheese and scrambled eggs to share. The chicken waffle sandwich was delicious, Mac and cheese was as good as the first time I had it and the scrambled eggs were fluffy. Two things I wish they would fix: 1) the kitchen needs to work on making sure the food is hot when it arrives at the table. We were warned the Mac and cheese dish was hot because it is served in a cast iron dish but it was only lukewarm. On my first visit my entree was also only lukewarm. 2) the waitstaff needs to make sure guests have the proper silverware. On my first visit I was served dessert without silverware and the second visit received coffee without sugar and a spoon when I had requested milk and sugar with my coffee.

5.0,9/2/2016,This genre of food is usually not my thing but they prepare it with such a craft that it is anything but ordinary. Almost everything i tasted had something unique and special about it. I Was trying to figure out what i was tasting throughout the meal. With the deviled eggs i think it was dill that made them taste special. The mac and cheese was cooked al dente and the perfect blend of creamy and crunchy. The chicken waffles- wow. Again the chicken had some delicious seasonings on it taking it above and beyond any other fried chicken and the waffles? Oh my goodness the perfect blend of savory with cheese and then their special maple bourbon syrup on top was just fantastic. Flavors were exploding in my mouth. I really wish i could buy their maple syrup. Even the watermelon salad was something special.  My only critiques are that for the ice cream sandwich the ice cream tasted a little freezer burned. I don't recommend bringing kids they have no high chairs and the space is pretty cramped. The decor is beautiful as well.,1,0,0,E R.,"Manhattan, NY",41,137,32

We had the Chicken and Waffle Sandwiches, we think it's a silly dish, but appears to be popular at many places so we tried and enjoyed but it's a fork and knife sandwich.

The crispy coated outside was fine but tasted a little burnt or like old grease. Also, I don't think they fry with the skin on? I could be wrong but I don't recall skin on the breast portion. The mac & cheese was great, but the smashed potatoes ...yuck. That gravy was a heavy chocolate looking mess, I couldn't describe the flavor if I had to but the pickled red onions on top were nice. The honey Tabasco sauce for the chicken... now that was good. I want several bottles of this in my life. The refreshing drinks like ice tea, lemonade or the Arnold Palmer with your choice of peach vodka or bourbon felt like home. And all the drinks are beautifully balanced. For dessert we had the key lime pie and the seasonal cobbler (which was blackberries) with pistachio ice cream...not sure why pistachio over vanilla but it was still good inspite of it not because of it.

5.0,8/26/2016,"Been here before, and last night was just as amazing!! The restaurant is small but very cutely decorated. We were able to sit at a countertop without a reservation, but I think you'd need one if you want to sit at an actual table. We ordered their signature half basket of fried chicken, side of Mac and cheese to share, and biscuits as an appetizer. We also got Rosalie cocktails. Portion sizes are great! The half chicken has 4 pieces, and the whole has 8. My friend and I shared the half basket with the side and appetizer and had leftovers to take home. Biscuits come with two, which was perfect for us. They are so fluffy and delicious! Mac and cheese has breadcrumbs on top and super creamy sauce. The chicken is fantastic, of course. The Rosalie cocktail is deliciously refreshing with watermelon and tequila. Our food came out super quickly, and the prices are very reasonable. $33 each for us sharing all the food and each getting a cocktail.

Can be heavy so its hard to try multiple dishes. Their mac and cheese was very creamy and their fried chicken biscuit sandwich was awesome. Gives jacobs pickles a run for its money. Also important to note, the wait can be insane. My advice if you dont have a reservation, wait in it. As long as it takes.

4.0,8/20/2016,"I've been wanting to come here for ages but whenever I plan a dinner outing, it's rarely with weeks notice. You cannot get in here without a reservation! Especially with a group larger than 2 unless you want to eat at an odd hour-- which totally makes sense now that I've seen how small the place is. I finally made a reservation (3 weeks in advance) for 8pm on a Friday. We weren't seated until about 15-20 mins after we arrived. It was the last day of restaurant week though, so we were patient. When a table finally opened, we were given the choice of sitting along a counter or sitting outside. It wasn't terribly hot out, so that worked well for us. However, everyone was bite like crazy by mosquitos! Let's get to the important stuff! THE FOOD! Southern comfort in NYC it definitely was. We originally came for restaurant week, but when we saw that the regular menu really isn't that expensive, we decided not to go with the RW menu. They're most known for their fried chicken, and a bucket of whole chicken is 8 pieces for 40 something dollars (a good deal for dinner in NYC). Our group ate to our hearts content: biscuits, chicken, waffles, smashed potatoes, cocktails and Mac and cheese. We were so full we couldn't finish all the chicken! We got the leftovers packed up and gave it to a homeless guy before going out for cocktails (nice treat for anyone if you ask me!)Our Mac and cheese came out rather late so the waitress comped that from our bill. She was very friendly and we hadn't even complained other than asking once kindly if it was still coming out, so that was really cool of her. The whole bill came out to $43 a person with tip included. I will definitely go back next time I'm craving good southern food!

The fried chicken was moist (as we chose the dark meat) but the batter wasn't as crispy and some parts of the coating on the thigh wasn't cooked all the way through. The sides were delicious as the watermelon salad was refreshing with a hint of savory flavors.Overall, I am glad I was able to cross Root & Bone off of my ""to go"" places but wouldn't be my first choice for fried chicken.",0,0,1,Lisa L.,"New York, NY",7,129,5

We got there when they supposed to open, but one staff was cleaning the door, and we had to wait to go in for a few minutes. It was kind of odd, as most of the staffs saw us standing outside, but no one came for a rescue...Dining room was separated into two rooms, one larger than the other. The larger room in the middle had the open kitchen where you can see the food being prepared, with the counter seats. They had some table seating in the middle of the room, and more counter seats by the window. The way it was decorated with kitchen cabinets and counters, it created this very warm, cozy atmosphere as if you were just invited into someone's home.From the Restaurant Week brunch menu, we ordered Drunken Deviled Eggs and Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits. They were nothing like I imagined. They were interesting, classy, pretty, and yes, tasty. For the main course, we ordered Waffle Benedict and Chicken N Waffles.

3.0,8/16/2016,"I really wanted to love this place, it was great just a little weird. Upon entering we were greeted immediately by a friendly hostess and seated. The restaurant was small, a tad on the cramped side, but doable, just a little tight. After being seated, our waitress seemed to have an attitude but seemed to perk up once she knew I was writing Yelp reviews. Thanks Yelp. Yet, she still seem to have a chip on her shoulder not to sure what that was about but, hey everyone is entitled to have a bad day, right? She just made it a little weird to be honest. My food roadie (my sister) and I ordered the half bucket of bird, which came with 4 pieces of chicken. We also ordered a side of Mac and cheese and the cheddar waffles. The chicken was the best part of meal, it was moist chewy and had that fried chicken crunch. The taste of the chicken could be describe to have a lemon burst on impact with a subtle sweetness that finished off with a savory juicy well seasoned ending. The Mac and cheese, I love Mac and cheese and I really had some high hopes for this one. However, the large elbow noodles were semi hard, they could've been softer.  While eating the Mac and cheese it felt as thought I was chewing on hard gum. The taste was okay, it was not salty, it was very cheesy and was served warm. The waffles tasted good but a tad on the cold side, like it was pre made and sitting out for while.

4.0,8/16/2016,"I came to Root & Bone for restaurant week though I have also been before. This was one of the few occasions in which I actually opted to take advantage of the restaurant week offer. This consisted of a first/appetizer course, a main course with two accompanying sides (mac & cheese and the picked watermelon) along with a drink and dessert.For the first course we choice the Angel Biscuits. They were pretty good especially with the chicken a jus but portion wise this was really lackluster. At my table of three that ordered it we each got a single biscuit perhaps an inch and a half cubed. Considering they were biscuits and most restaurants in the city give out free bread, I felt they could have been a bit more generous here. It set a poor tone as we wondered if the whole restaurant week menu would be undersized.For our mains we all chose the Chicken and Waffles. It's basically what we came for so no one shied away from it. The Sweet Tea Brined Fried Chicken was delicious particularly as I love the contrast of sweet and salty so this definitely hit the spot for me. The buckweat waffles with cheddar were also very good. The syrup was not too sweet nor were the waffles which paired well with the chicken. The mac and cheese that accompanied our mains was great. I was less enthusiastic about the watermelon, though that isn't to say there was anything wrong with it.Drink wise I chose the peach ice tea vodka. It was all right, but I think I would have enjoyed this as just peach ice tea. I probably could have asked for my drink without the vodka without any issue, though I did not think of it at the time. I'm not sure why they didn't provided any non-alcoholic options?Lastly for dessert we had the waffle ice cream sandwich. They split the buckwheat waffle in half, placed a scoop of butter pecan ice cream in between then dust it with powder sugar then dress it with a maple bourbon caramel sauce. This was a great dessert. The waffle provided a nice crunch while it soaked up some of the melted ice cream. Would definitely get this again.My more nitpicky criticisms would be their weak air conditioner and the single bathroom. The latter nothing can be done about, but for a place with a stocked bar this seems like a terrible idea. On the air conditioning front, the place is just too damn warm in the summer.

3.0,8/12/2016,"Can I just say I hate this new trend in fried chicken places shunning the beauty that is a pile of mashed potatoes?Anyway, I heard Root & Bone was good, and fried chicken sounded great, so I went. The menu was kind of strange, you could get a half fried chicken, but no potatoes, the sides were a little strange (though they do have mac and cheese). They had a small plate of peaches, burrata and pecans that sounded awesome, but I wanted to try the chicken and didn't have enough room. I''ll steal the idea for home. I ordered chicken biscuit sandwiches, but the biscuits weren't ready, so I got chicken and waffle sandwiches. It was presented in this elaborate hipster display (see photo). It was not quite the  down home fried chicken dish I went in hoping to find. I thought the chicken was actually quite underwhelming, and strangely found the best part of the dish to be the waffles, which I originally didn't even really want anyway. I had considered the heirloom tomato sandwich, but it was $16.00, and I can't justify that no matter how much I love tomato sandwiches,  because I could pick up a tomato (heirloom even!) at the farmers market and make the best sandwich you've ever had in under a minute for less than Three dollars. I also discovered after ordering it that my iced tea cost $5.00 (if I had paid attention I would have stuck with water). I'm sure the tea leaves were hand picked on an organic farm by an well paid hippy, but still. I know these guys have rent to pay and I'm sure the ingredients are great, etc. but for the price it was all very underwhelming. Service was also really slow - I probably spent more time waiting for the check than eating the meal. though it was at a weird time in between lunch and dinner rushes, so I guess they were focused on getting ready for dinner. The desserts looked great. I'm not much of a dessert person, but given how good the waffles were, I'd be into checking out their cobbler or whatever. Or maybe not, it's probably like $20.00 or something. Overall, if you want good fried chicken go to Bob White or Commodore.

First Course: - Drunken Deviled Eggs - GET THIS.  Especially if you like pickled anything, such a great combo of flavors that left me wanting more. - Angel biscuits - also very good, but not as memorable as the deviled eggsSecond Course: - Chicken and Waffles - Fried chicken here is no joke, and when you combine them with cheddar waffles... its just a whole other level.  GET THIS if you've never had their fried chicken before. - Waffle Benedict - I absolutely loved this dish. As much as their known for their fried chicken, they should be equally as known for their waffles. The pork belly bacon combo is just out of this world. Third course: - S'mores - this came in a little cup of yummy chocolatey goodness.  It really is smores in a cup, with the chocolate pudding, topped with vanilla marshmallow and graham cracker.  I ate this by myself, but probably could have (read: should have) shared. - Waffle ice cream sandwich - GET THIS. Can't get enough of the waffles here.  Topped with powder sugarBonus Items for the table: - Mac and Cheese - cheesy goodness.  perfect complement to the meal- Watermelon with lime - another great complement. perfect for summer time. What I loved about this meal was that the combinations and complements went perfectly together. If you're in the mood for some great southern food, this is the place to come.  The place is pretty small though so make a reservation!",2,0,0,Anu K.,"Manhattan, NY",341,227,407
1.0,8/5/2016,"#WTFHOW DOES THIS PLACE HAVE SO MANY GOOD REVIEWS.I'm sorry but that experience was too bad to hold back.Upon walking in, my boyfriend and I noticed that there was a ton of fried chicken sitting under a heating lamp. I tried to convince myself that they were just orders waiting to be taken out... But boy was I wrong.To start we order biscuits. The biscuits came within 3 minutes of ordering which honestly was way too fast. They were fluffy and delicious, but they could have really benefited from some butter or jam.Our entrees, which was half a bucket of fried chicken, mac & cheese & the gem salad came within the next 10 minutes. I felt like I was at a fast food restaurant, it was super obvious that everything was pre made. The fried chicken was soggy and had absolutely no crisp. The skin was SO salty it was almost inedible and I love salt. The chicken was on the pricier side so I would have expected it to be made to order. It was a huge disappointment. The mac & cheese would have been the stand out of the meal had it been hot. The gem salad was super bland and meh.On top of it, our waiter was terrible and even accused me of trying to break the bathroom door when I tried to open it. Like WTF. We were in and out of the restaurant within 40.",10,7,1,Olivia R.,"New York, NY",337,147,182

3.0,8/4/2016,"Smh. I don't know why this on so many lists for the best fried chicken in NYC. This chicken was a miss. Not terrible, but definitely not a contender for one of the best fried chicken spots in NYC, in my opinion. Where do I start...first the brine definitely comes through and there's a sweet tea taste to the chicken. I don't want my chicken to taste like sweet tea! Next, it wasn't fried well enough. The meat was chewy and hard to pull away from the bone, as if it needed 10 more minutes in the fryer. Lastly, it needed a bit more seasoning. More pepper, garlic powder, poultry seasoning...something. It was definitely missing something to give it that good fried chicken skin and taste.  The waffles were yummy. I removed the cheese from mine. The mac and cheese was also really good. I didn't care for the watermelon salad and the vinaigrette that was on it.

The deviled eggs are v good but beware that everything else on the menu is v heavy, I know you're probably saying 'like duh you're eating fried chicken it's going to be heavy' but it's unbearably heavy - fried chicken on top of a honey soaked thick biscuit sounds heavenly in theory but it kind of fails in actuality.

The chicken had a wonderful citrusy flavor and it had crispy skin with a juicy center. My friend got the short rib meat loaf and it had lots of yummy flavorful short rib.

I've eaten fried chicken all over this country and spend a fair amount of time in Harlem each year partaking in some of New York's best offerings, but after having eaten here a few times now, I can honestly say that Root & Bone takes the crown.Every single aspect of the fried chicken here is gold medal. The texture, the flavors, the EVERYTHING.Never met a side item at this place that I didn't love either.

5.0,7/30/2016,"This place has one of the best chicken wings I've ever eaten! The seasoning is very tasty. The ambiance was very chill and the decor is like rustic, I enjoyed it. So we walk in and we're greeted by the hostess and she quickly sits us down and hands us the menu. Another worker comes and gives us water but it was truly undrinkable. Not that it was nasty but it was some hot ass water being that they keep it outside. I think the people want some nice cold ice water especially on a 90 degree day. So we put that to the side lol. The menu is very small which is cool because sometimes a long menu can seem overwhelming. I order the deviled eggs to start and it was delicious!! I highly recommend for anyone to try their deviled eggs. All the different flavoring pairs so well woth eachother. So next for the main course, we get the half bird which is 4 peices of chicken, your choice of dark or white meat (we got white meat, i dont remember exactly what he said but i think if you want all white meatbits 4$ extra so it comes out to $23), 2 mac and cheeses and 4 lemonades. The chicken is amazing, could of been just a litttle but warmer but amazing nonetheless. The mac and cheese is what you see in dreams, it was super cheesy and tasted so good, would deff just go there to satisfy my mac and cheese cravings! And the lemonades were just how i like them, tangy but still a bit sweet. The wait time for the food was not long, maybe like 20 minutes. Next comes the bill, I was caught a bit off gaurd because the lemonades were 5$ each! 20$ on just lemonade, 7$ for the deviled eggs and 2 mac and cheese for 9$ each and the half bird at 23$..the bill total was 74$, the service was great, one of the best service ive had in a restaurant and the food was amazing so i guess 74$ is not that bad. Will for sure come back to have more chicken and try their waffles and buscuits!",0,0,0,Stephanie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,24,20
5.0,7/29/2016,"This place is really so great. The ambiance is very cute, I love their mismatched plates and funky light fixtures.  I've only ever been for restaurant week, once last July and then again last night. It was just as delicious as I remember.  Their restaurant week deal is one of the best by the way - in addition to getting the app, main course and dessert, you ALSO get a free cocktail and not one, but two sides for the table. I got the deviled eggs as the app which are amazing, I wish there were more! I got the peach tea with vodka cocktail which was good, but I wish it was a tad sweeter.  My boyfriend and I decided to also order the chicken and biscuits off the main menu and they were SO good. The chicken is fried to perfection and the biscuits are fluffy and delicious. For my main, I got the chicken and waffles and they're just so so so delicious/ I love the herbs that are on the chicken, and the hot sauce they give you on the side with it. The waffles are covered in cheese and topped with a sprinkle of scallions - what a great combo. For dessert I got the maple ice cream sandwich, which might not have been the best option considering how hot yesterday was and how quickly it melted, but did I eat it all? Yes. Great flavor.  Highly recommend this place.",1,0,0,Alaina R.,"Manhattan, NY",4,49,92

The five stars is mainly for the fried chicken and waffles because they were heavenly! Normally, fried chicken is so oily that you can't eat afterwards but the ones served here don't even taste fried! Usually, my husband can eat (I thought he'd still be hungry after the above); however, we had leftovers! We were so full after dinner and went for a walk but didn't feel lethargic, as we usually would after having such a meal. Anyways, this spot is a must try!!

3.0,7/17/2016,"2.88888888888 starsPros:- Chicken sandwich starter - chicken is pretty tender & juicy. Biscuit that comes with it is fluffy; though the honey tabasco sauce is slightly too sweet for my liking. I'm looking for more of a savory / umami experience in a Southern food but I can still appreciate the twist they tried to put on this sandwich - they put chips as a part of the biscuit- Fast and prompt service- albeit it feels like I'm constantly watched by the waitress. She came to check in with me a little too many timesCons:- Mac and Cheese - overly salty (especially the breadcrumb), pasta texture is too hard. Also it is pretty heavy. I only ate 1/2 of the mac and cheese but I felt full already. Not recommending this dish.- Overpriced -- $21 for a small chicken sandwich plus a mac and cheese excluding tip and tax. Also many of the main entrees are in the range of $25 or above. I understand it is NYC, but still...have mercy on our wallets!Verdict: Overpriced and overrated. Okay food but not quite my cup of tea.

3.0,7/7/2016,"I'm from Alabama. I freely admit it - I ain't ashamed. Growing up in the south makes me something of a fried chicken expert.It's one of the few cuisines that NYC misses the mark on more often than not. (Calm down, I know this city likes to be the best at everything, and it's got some world class fried chicken - It's just probably not at the places you think it is, but that's a discussion for another time.)Since this is billed as southern style fried chicken I was really excited. I can't really say where he goes wrong. The chicken is fried hard, but his attempt to fuse other flavors with southern cuisine insists upon itself (Much like the hipsters that frequent this place).The citrus flavor of the lemon dusting overpowers the subtlety that southern style sweet tea brined chicken needs to shine.The thyme crust of the mac and cheese distracts from the overall taste of the dish - It's like they added it simply because they could, not because it added to the dish.The cornbread is crumbled in the grits when ordered. The coarse and crumbly texture of the cornbread is ruined because it comes already in the grits - you lose the contrast of the two textures this way...I don't really see a reason to come back here with Bob White's Counter being so close to this place...I totally blame the Australian Chef that partnered with the southerner for ruining this place.

5.0,7/5/2016,"Finding a fried chicken and waffle place that tops Root and Bone will be tough. For the three of us, we split the deviled eggs,   1/2 chicken bucket, side of waffles, mac and cheese and collard greens. Deviled eggs were phenomenal. The only problem is resisting the urge to order more. Fried chicken, perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Great balance of seasoning too. Really loved the cheesy waffles that they serve up. Mac and cheese is SPOT ON. I hate it when you get that mac and cheese that turns into a thick paste within minutes of coming to the table. Root and Bone's mac and cheese offers up a crispy bread crumb topping and cheesy goodness below.

The fried chicken, the star, was good but again not really award-winning stuff. The seasoning was tasty but the skin wasn't really crispy and hearty the way it should be; it was good but not great. The most disappointing part was the mac and cheese, however, and the cheese tasted so processed and wasn't really creamy. Such sadness.

What got my goat today was their misleading menu practices. I identified a food item that was priced differently on the bill relative to my memory of the menu, and asked the waitress - she asserted that my memory of the bill was incorrect.  Upon asking for another copy of the menu, it turned out that my memory was in fact correct, and the bill had the item priced at a different level. The waitress then proceeded to claim that there were multiple menus with different prices and that only some were correct. Suspicious? A little - given that two different randomly selected menus had the same (low) price. More likely sneaky restaurant practices trying to squeeze a dime (in this case a dollar) here and there out of unsuspecting customers. I don't blame the waitress - she even offered to pay the difference out of her tip (an offer which we obviously didn't take her up on), but watch yourself if you visit this place. This time the theft-from-customers was implicit through menu fraud ; next time it might be lifting twenties out of your wallet.",3,0,1,Ashwin T.,"New York, NY",166,217,108
1.0,6/30/2016,"There was a long wait but that isn't an issue, that usually means the food is good anyways. And the food was good, really enjoyed the fried chicken. Mac and cheese was ok...sort of dense.The reason why I'm giving a one star review is because of their shady actions. I went with my friends and at our table there were 2 checks. A few days after our dinner, both of us realized that our server over tipped themselves. We paid with credit and wrote the tip amount on the receipt, but after checking our bank statements we realized that whoever put the tip number into the system, charged more than what we wrote down. I also read another review where this happened to someone else. The funny thing is the both of us rounded up when tipping a percentage, and regardless, they have no right to take whatever amount they want.I called the restaurant and asked to speak with the manager. She seemed way too calm about the situation and simply asked for my credit card information and said I should see the money go back into my account soon. It felt like she either knew what was going on and didn't care, or it happens so often she's use to it.A couple dollars isn't a huge deal but it's the dishonesty and down right shady-ness that bugs me. If they do this with tables regularly, that's a lot of extra money they don't deserve. Overall, will never go again and won't recommend to anyone.Edit: By the way, our waitress was Anna.

I'm originally from Texas, and I approve of this Southern brunch spot!I came with two friends on a Saturday afternoon (around 1pm) and was able to get seated outdoors right away.The best way to brunch here is to order the Crispy Fried Bucket of Bird and share it along with a small plate and sides. We ordered the half bird with buckwheat cheddar waffles (+$7), waffle benedict, grandma daisy's angel biscuits, and macaroni & cheese.My first suggestion would be to skip out on the cheddar waffles. They are not crispy and definitely not worth the $7. However, you should definitely load up on the angel biscuits. Get a lot of the angel biscuits. They are so freaking good. We wanted to order more of it, but we were way too full to enjoy them. The fried chicken has the perfect amount of crunch and juiciness. They are lemon dusted, which adds a different but nice flavor to the chicken. The mac & cheese is a must. It is really creamy and cheese, just how mac & cheese should be. The waffle benedict is pretty standard, just like any other eggs benedict at a brunch place. It is worth trying since the pork belly bacon was really good.Service was good. No complaints here.

Despite not being able to find my reservation, the host Samuel was very accommodating which I appreciated considering it is Friday night.  We had the deviled eggs (small but mighty), the 1/2 chicken bucket (so darn good, and interestingly prepared), asparagus (you know, pretty standard), and the cheddar waffles (nom nom nom). For my entree I had the shrimp and grits, good but not the best I've had (the actual south wins on this one).  My sister in law brought a small cake for us at the end and there was a $5 per person plating fee, a bit silly if you ask me (but it's not my restaurant so....), but we dealt with it and had our cake too ;)",1,0,0,Carly B.,"Pompano Beach, FL",111,25,24

We came pretty early, 10:30 AM on a Saturday and the place was nearly empty! We were served relatively quickly, though our server was a bit abrupt with us. Our biggest complaint was how heavy-handed the chefs were with the salt! Everything tasted way too salty, and overall we were underwhelmed by the flavors. I ordered the waffle eggs benedict and was wishing for more robust flavors than just plain unseasoned waffles as the base for the poached eggs. Even a dash of maple syrup or something to give that sweet balance to the savory flavors of the eggs would have made a world of difference. Even the side salad was too salty! My cousins felt similarly about their dishes being overly salted but otherwise under-seasoned. Disappointing dishes: waffle benedict, Grandma Daisy's angel biscuits (the biscuits themselves were...you guessed it...overly salted! It came with sea salt and thyme on the side AND was topped with excess sea salt. The honey roasted chicken jus sounded incredible in theory, but in reality had no taste whatsoever and contributed nothing to the biscuits) So-so dishes: Catfish po'boy Excellent choices: the starters and desserts! we got the drunken deviled eggs which were beautifully plated though too salty, as well as the pecan french toast bites with the bourbon creme anglaise which were just perfection. They had an incredible crisp with a soft fluffy center, and the creme anglaise was outstanding, smooth and sweet without being overly so. The highlight of the meal was definitely the dessert--the panna cotta! It was smooth and rich, served with a raspberry sorbet, perfectly light and crisp lavender meringues, and topped with diced poached pear. We also got the raspberry tart with pistachio ice cream which was wonderfully warm and crispy.

There's some seating outside, if it's a nice day. I love brunch. I also love chicken and waffles. So, I was really looking forward to Root & Bone. We ordered the full fried chicken and the buckwheat waffles with cheddar cheese... While the fried chicken was cooked very well (the white meat pieces were very tender), I found the spiked Tabasco honey to be just okay. I like spicy, so maybe the sauce needed to be spicier. As for the waffles, they were fluffy, but I didn't think they were special in any way. The cheddar cheese didn't really add to them (except for additional calories). And again, the whiskey maple syrup were lackluster. I personally prefer Clinton Street Bakery's Chicken and Waffles. Overall I thought the restaurant was nice and the service was great.

Consistency-test?Definitely a down-to-earth spot and a great place for Friday casual gather-together. We opted to share the whole bird, with a whisky syrup waffle as side. The single best chicken I have ever had in my life - how can the meat be that tender while the skin so crispy?? Amazing! Both the deviled egg and grilled asparagus were delicious and served as perfect appetizers. Definitely leave some room for dessert and you would not be regretted.

1.0,5/5/2016,"I went to an event where the owners demonstrated the cooking process of a few of their signature dishes. This included their chicken biscuit and drunken deviled eggs. These were delicious and I was very excited when my boyfriend brought me here for my birthday. I couldn't wait to try the other dishes on their menu. The visit was very disappointing. The place was packed (which is understandable since it was dinner time) but that's okay. There was another party waiting for a table. Including my boyfriend and myself, there was probably 6 people waiting? But the place is already overcrowded with 6 people as there is very little to no space for the waiting area (which I can still accept because Manhattan rent is expensive). Okay... The waiting area has a very poignant fried smell but if the dining experience was great, or even good, I can overlook all this. I came here for the food and that's what matters most to me.We ordered the bucket of bird, grilled romaine wedge salad and braised short rib meat loaf. (At least those are the dishes I remember). The meat loaf was too dry for me; the salad was too salty. The bucket of bird was good and I enjoyed it, but my favorite was definitely the buckwheat waffles. It was delicious. Despite not everything being to my taste, I considered it my personal palate issues and would've still given this place 3 stars since while it might not been a place I like but it still has its merits. What happened afterwards is what set me to write such a long 1-star review.Since I got overambitious and ordered too much food, I asked to have half my order of bucket of bird and the waffles packed. I specifically asked her to pack them (as in ""can you pack this and this? *handing over the two dishes*). She assented and when she came back, I also specifically asked her if they were packed, but it wasn't until I was home that I realized that she didn't pack the waffles. Yes, I am very seriously stressing how half the order of waffles, my favorite dish, was left out after being very specific and receiving assurances from my waitress that it was packed. And THAT is why I give this place 1-star.There are great food here that I would recommend like the chicken biscuit, the buckwheat waffles and the bucket of bird.

My friends and I had a 9:30 pm reservation and we ended up waiting at least 30 minutes to be seated. After 30 minutes, I expected to be seated on a table vs window side bar seating with wobbly stools. Once seated, we did not waste time and ordered biscuits, Brussels sprouts salad and half chicken. Few minutes later our chicken and Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts salad was absolutely amazing. After about 10 more minutes, we tried to get our servers attention which was extremely hard.

The space is pretty small (but cute/cozy!) and can fill up quickly - we were lucky to be seated at the table along the window without waiting. It's not too loud so it's nice for catching up and having a conversation. We visited to try the Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwich and were disappointed to find that it was only available for brunch; so, we only ended up getting 3 appetizers. (My sister was recovering from the flu and had the appetite of a toddler as a result). We ordered the biscuits, deviled eggs and mac & cheese. The biscuits were GLORIOUS. I loved every bite and wish that I didn't have to share. The mac & cheese was pretty good and the deviled eggs were alright.Service was relatively slow. The waitress never came by to check on us or refill our waters unless we flagged her down after waiting a while. She literally only came by the table to take our order, give us our food/drinks and to handle payment. Bare minimum if you ask me.

4.0,3/30/2016,"Delicious and witty take on Southern comfort food. It's a bit over the top and for optimum pleasure (and to be able to save room for the excellent deserts) I'd recommend sharing both the salads and the entrees. I had the grilled romaine salad, with deep fried pozole, ripe cherry tomatoes, the best lardons I've ever tasted and crumbles of good quality blue cheese. The salad was the highlight of the meal. I tried the half fried chicken next and only made it through two of the four pieces. The leg was a bit too saturated in fat for me. But the thigh was perfect and the skin tasted like the forgotten barbecue potato chips of my lost youth. Yum! Finally, half of a serving of Key Lime pie and a proper Key Lime pie it was. Delicate, cookie-like crust, a creamy lime filling that was on the sweet rather than the tart side but the tartness was supplied by zests of lime sprinkled on top of the baked marshmallow crests. Sublime! Negatives: Uncomfortable and cramped seating arrangements. One bathroom for the entire restaurant. Greasy chicken means greasy fingers but no moist towelette is offered which pressures one to either wait for the bathroom or to rush out into the East Village like a villain spreading fried chicken grease on whatever one touches.

Authentic, delicious, comforting, southern cooking - more than met my expectations. We ordered a few things from the menu, everything was a perfect sharing size for 2 people.Half bird - crispy, well seasoned skin, perfectly juicy tender inside 4 LARGE pieces (drumstick, wing, breast & thigh) they were all perfectly cooked.  Buckwheat waffles - had never had cheese on a waffle & i didn't think that I would be a fan. They were delicious, the waffle was just sweet enough for it to be a perfect flavor balance, & the cheese was not too salty. The scallion somehow perfectly bought the sweet & savoriness together.Macaroni & Cheese - AMAZING. Creamy cheesy sauce, toasted crisp top layer. Again not overly salty. Biscuits - Just get them, they melt in your mouth.Promise Ring - A hipstery take on a whiskey sour, was delicious however weak for 13$Preacher Man - Sooo yummy the dill really sets the flavors in the drink off perfectly, however again weak for 13$Small place, seats maybe 15-25 people (had an outdoor seating area that seats about 6 as well), area when you first walk in is for pick up orders so I imagine it can get a little congested in there at times. However I made a reservation over the phone because waiting is for suckers (open table asks for your card info), and was seated immediately.

Plus a huge portion of the menu is gluten free or can be prepared gluten free! It's not on the menu - but they can even do gluten free fried chicken and biscuits. My favorite meals are small plates that you can share to have a taste of everything - I was lucky enough to indulge at root & bone with a friend who was willing to approach this menu shared style even though the plates were anything but small. The server was very knowledgeable about gluten free options, and went as far as to highlight how each dish was modified to be GF when she brought them out and clarifying what each crunch ingredient was to assuage any potential nerves. Plus they clean out the fryer before making any of the GF fried options to avoid cross contamination. Everything was delicious (overview of what we got below) but the spaghetti squash was definitely the surprise hit - I am still dreaming of the cream sauce. The food (all gluten-free):- drunken deviled eggs: pink and adorable, the chip on top was the perfect added crunch - cheese grits (no bread crumb): sooooo rich and cheesy but perfect, the added liken to cheese was an additional sharp kick - spaghetti squash (no toast): this was one of the best things I have ever eaten, mind blowing combo of creamy and rich with some nutty crunch - so so good - fried chicken and biscuits: best gf fried chicken and biscuits I've maybe ever had Drinks: - we both got the burning bush cocktail (orange infused cocktail, egg white, pepper, cinnamon) - AMAZING, strong but a balanced flavor and not overly sweet...

For an appetizer, we ordered their Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits. Let me tell you, everything tasted great! Biscuits were not quite the flaky light biscuits you'd expect, but the levels of flavor with the salt, thyme, sesame seeds and chicken jus made everything come together. The chicken was fried perfectly and I really enjoyed the lemon dusting and dipping the pieces into their tabasco honey.

3.0,3/13/2016,"So this was an interesting meal. After reading about Root & Bone on social media, my husband and I decided to give it a try. As an avid lover of mac and cheese, we obviously ordered that. It was UNBELIEVABLE. I could have probably eaten 6 more bowls of it. Rich and thick and creamy and cheesy with a crispy crust. Just amazing. My husband ordered the fried chicken and I ordered the spaghetti squash with ricotta. We each took our first bite and said oh wow oh man! We each thought our food was great. My husband said his chicken had great flavor and was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. My spaghetti squash was creamy with ricotta and had a little crunch on top from the shavings of toast on top. As we continued eating, an interesting thing started happening. We each started becoming more and more disappointed with our meals. The flavor became less enjoyable for my husband and my entree was almost too creamy and almost nauseating by the end. I have never experienced this while eating a meal. It was odd that we both did. I don't think it was because we were becoming more full; we were not satisfied, we were no longer enjoying our meal. I just think the flavor combinations were ok for a bite or two but not an entire meal.

We went knowing we didn't have a reservation and expected long wait times, but we were able to be seated at the counter. The restaurant itself is small and cozy and reminds you of grandmas kitchen. The Windows can be opened on warm days, but unfortunately today wasn't one of those days. And the minute you walk in you're hit with an overpowering greasy smell & I hate places that are like that. After being seated, our waitress came by with water and menus. We started out with grandmas biscuits which were the highlight of the entire meal. They are melt in your mouth delicious. They come with a side of sea salt and sesame and chicken jus for dipping. All the extras were really extras and just unnecessary.We also ordered the mac n cheese and whole bird. The Mac n cheese came in a small bowl. Great for sharing. Creamy. Big macaroni! They were good. Nothing remarkable.We were hoping the bird would be the highlight of the night but were 100% disappointed. The skin was soggy and oily. We were given a mixture of a hot sauce and some maple but on sauce and no ketchup. Very upsetting on my behalf. The exterior had some flavor. The inside was bland and tasteless.

Finally got a chance to try it out a couple nights ago and in all honestly, it was just A-ok...My girls and I didn't make a reservation but was able to get a table around dinner time. Staff members were friendly and suggested food that were good and enjoyed by many other people. We ended up ordering the meat loaf, fried chicken, deviled eggs, Mac'n' cheese and a couple alcoholic drinks. While we waited, I studied the atmosphere. The decorations were great. Very homely and perfect for a southern, comfort food restaurant. The deviled eggs arrived first. Absolutely delicious! Loved the creaminess of the egg yolks. Perfectly flavored. The chicken came and it was great as well. The meat was juicy and the skin was crispy. Salted perfectly. Also, it came with a sweet tabasco sauce that also went great with other things we ordered. However, that was pretty much what's good. The meat loaf was extremely dry. The sauces that came with it didn't help at all. We unanimously thought it was over cooked and could have done better. The Mac'N'Cheese was overly salty. It tasted like a pot of straight up cheese...yuck! It was not good. Unfortunately, we weren't satisfied when we saw the bill. It was extremely expensive for southern food. Yes the Chicken and deviled eggs were great but no, it was not worth that much. I mean it was a good experience but I don't think I'll revisit again...

4.0,2/19/2016,"My friend and I ate at Root & Bone during their Restaurant Week on a weekday afternoon for a late 3:30pm lunch. The restaurant was not crowded but fairly filled. The decorations and atmosphere has a wooden rustic country feel. It's a really cute restaurant and I loved it.I was really happy with my Restaurant Week experience at Root & Bone. I was so full at the end I even packed my food to go. The restaurant week menu let's you pick 1 appetizer, entree, dessert and side dish to share for the table. For appetizers we got the devil eggs and biscuits. Both were delicious, especially the biscuits! Definitely my favorite of the meal. For the entree we both got the chicken and waffle and the Mac n cheese side for the table. The wing of the chicken was juicy and tender. It meshed really well with the waffle and different syrups and sauces. The thigh of the chicken was a lot drier. At that point I was so full I couldn't even finish the chicken. The Mac n cheese was the perfect amount of cheesy and crunchiness. Probably one of the better ones I've had. We topped off the meal with different flavored gelato, but honestly as good as it was, we were stuffed to the max. Overall, great restaurant but chicken could be made juicier.

The food was good but it did feel a bit heavy (brunch place, I get it).Nothing crazy, but I would like to try this place again during normal hours/schedule. I wouldn't pick this place over Clinton Street Bakery which blew me away. A solid place though and worth another shot.",0,0,0,Timmy L.,"Jamaica, NY",103,60,138
4.0,2/15/2016,"I have been wanting to try Root & Bone for some time and finally got a chance to visit during Restaurant Week. We couldn't make a reservation online and on arrival were told it would be a 2 hour wait. Luckily it wasn't that long and we had a table on the high chairs in the window. The restaurant was smaller than I had expected, but there were hooks under the counter, so plenty of space to store your belongings during the meal. My friend and I shared the biscuits and deviled eggs to start. I really enjoyed the biscuits and the sauce they came with. The eggs were so small it is hard to judge. They were fine. As I was at Root & Bone, I of course had to have the fried chicken and waffle! It arrived in a wire basket, wrapped in paper. I really enjoyed it and was impressed with how tasty the waffle was, it was thick and chewy, different texture to a typical waffle. My only complaint would be the mess left behind on the table as I ate. As it comes in a wire basket, bits of chicken and skin just fall through the gaps in the basket and left food all over the table in front of me! (Which our server did not wipe away when he collected our plates!). Another issue was that our main courses arrived while we were still eating our appetizers, so we had 4 dishes on the go at once! We chose Mac & Cheese as a side to share, it was really delicious. Quite creamy and cheesy, I really liked it. We both had the sticky toffee dessert and it was really good!! I feel like you cannot normally fit in a dessert when eating this sort of food, but it was a great size and tasted really good. A great end to a great meal. Service was good, but maybe a bit over friendly to a point it became too informal. He was nice but a bit too cheeky in his jokes I felt. If I knew there wouldn't be such a huge wait, I would go back. What is great is that you can leave your number & they text you when the table is ready, so you don't have to wait around.",4,1,3,Lynsey H.,"London, United Kingdom",223,458,2823

It's obviously a very popular spot because it was packed and lively. We made a reservation. I can't imagine how long one would have to wait to be seated without a reservation. Our host and servers were very lovely. We had the ginger beer and whiskey cocktails and they were so so sooo delicious. We split the Mac and cheese for the appetizer. It was life changing.

We had the shrimp and grits, half bird, deviled eggs and mac & cheese. The shrimp was way over cooked and the grits were not seasoned. Bacon completely overpowered the dish. The chicken was dry and lacked seasoning. The eggs were beautiful but the Mac and cheese was just weird. I honestly can't figure it out. It was soupy and it tasted more like cream than cheese.

2.0,2/12/2016,"To be clear: the food is delicious. However, our experience was terrible. Three friends and I went last night to celebrate a birthday and, though our reservation was at 7:30, we weren't seated until 8:15. During our wait, we were offered drinks, which we assumed was a complimentary gesture given our wait, but we were charged. Also, the drink the birthday girl ordered, which was on the menu, was unavailable. At the end of our meal, dessert was delivered without a candle, EVEN THOUGH we made a note on Open Table when we made the reservation, alerted the host to the special occasion when we arrived, and reminded the waitress before dessert was served. We were eventually given a candle, but the moment had passed. Womp womp.Lastly, when our bill arrived, we realized we'd been charged for the drink the birthday girl had initially ordered, which we had never received because it was sold out.We alerted the staff for each of these mishaps and the only apology they offered was to comp four biscuits (that's worth a whopping $14).

2.0,2/11/2016,"I wish I could give this place a good review, but they really messed up a special occasion.I came here tonight to celebrate a friend's birthday. We had a reservation at 7:30 for a party of 4, and I called ahead to see if the restaurant had a birthday candle for the dessert. The host assured me that they did and made a note on our reservation to add the candle. When we arrived (early), I confirmed with the host that this would happen.Even though our reservation was for 7:30, we weren't seated until ALMOST AN HOUR LATER. The host kept explaining that the people at our table weren't leaving, and there was nothing they could do about it. (Apparently there is only one table in the entire restaurant that can seat a party of 4?) Could they not have politely asked them to wrap up?While we waited (again, for almost an hour) for them to honor our reservation, the host asked if we would like to order drinks. I assumed this was a complimentary gesture to compensate for the ridiculous wait. We each ordered one drink, but the birthday girl's drink of choice was sold out.We were finally seated and given one complimentary roll each. All of our food was delicious, but when our waitress brought out our dessert, they had FORGOTTEN THE CANDLE. I got one from the manager, but at that point, the surprise was ruined and the moment was awkward. When our bill came, we discovered that NOT ONLY were we charged for the drinks we were offered while we waited, we were OVERCHARGED to include the drink that was sold out! Our server gave us a revised bill when I pointed this out, but the only things that we received to compensate for their numerous errors were the 4 free rolls. If you aren't in any kind of rush or celebrating something special, then this place is worth trying for the great food. However, just know that they don't honor reservation times and don't seem to care if they mess up a special occasion. If that's important to you, go elsewhere.",0,1,0,Beth S.,"Astoria, NY",114,4,1

4.0,2/7/2016,I was a walk in for the last day of Restaurant Week. There was no problem finding a seat for 2 at the counter. The food was absolutely amazing. The fried chicken was seasoned to perfection. I wished that my chicken was just a little crispier (personal preference). The grits were very tasty and unique with the pimiento cheese and corn. This was my absolute favorite side item of the night. The Mac and cheese was very good. The waffles were perfect with the scallion and cheese garnish for flavor.  The toffee dessert was overly sweet so I would skip that next time. I dropped a star just because the chefs in the open kitchen did not wear gloves while cooking and preparing the food. The sous chefs preparing appetizers and the fried chicken wore gloves. I didn't see a reason for the difference but may be a good practice especially since I saw a chef eating in between prep.,0,0,0,Sassy P.,"Bayonne, NJ",1,49,2

Tried the biscuits- very rich, decadent, and buttery. Main meal was the fried chicken (light meat) and waffles. Everything was so delicious. The fried chicken was super crispy and flaky and the waffles had melted cheddar cheese on them. It also came with this honey syrup and some kind of smoked tobasco sauce. For dessert, I had a citrus sorbet with custard, graham cracker crumble, and meringue on top. The decor and music was perfect for the vibe on a weekday afternoon.

3.0,2/3/2016,"Made a reservation for restaurant week for 10pm on a Wednesday. Pretty stoked as I love comfort food. Walk inside & was greeted by a very friendly hostess, she showed us to our very tiny table. Place is mad small & I felt so enormous sitting on the bench side of the booth as my gf sat at least 6 inches lower in a chair. Kind of Willy Wonka'ish. Very tight inside but that's not really anyone's fault as they're making the best out the small space. So the alcohol, decided to get the Burning Bush as it came recommended by the waiter. Not for me. I love tequila & I love spicy but this went left. It had cinnamon, egg white, orange tequila & ancho pepper. It just didn't sit well with me...to be entirely too descriptive...the drink was frothy & felt fuzzy in my mouth. Almost similar to the feeling in your mouth you get when you're going to vomit. Anyways, not going to be re-ordering this one. For $13, two thumbs down. Next the food, ahhhh we got the biscuits & the deviled eggs. The deviled eggs were pickled & the saltiness really overpowered everything else for me. Looked beautiful though, A1 presentation. Biscuits were great, could've eaten 5...at once. Then we got the pimento cheese grits & holllllllly shit were these perfect. I could've stopped here & been satisfied. The little pops of corn in there too, magnificent. Ahhhh my mouth is watering just thinking about that texture & the creamy cheesy goodness. Next the Mac n cheese. I LIVE for Mac n cheese & I like creamy Mac all day. This Mac is a winner, superb compilation. The creamy, smooth blend of everything mixed so well together I would bring my big booty from Queens just to get that Mac n cheese. Mmmmm. Loved it! We both got the chicken & waffles & it was good. Chicken falls off the bone & is well seasoned but not overpowering. Perfectly seasoned is a better description. Liked the buckwheat waffles. Really enjoyed the chicken & waffle combo. Next we split the sticky toffee pudding, not for me again. Took one bite, wasn't impressed. My gf enjoyed it though. Cute decor, love the exposed brick, very homey feel.Will I be back? Quite possibly.",6,2,2,Natalie T.,"Long Island City, NY",311,236,255
4.0,2/3/2016,"Root & Bone is great for brunch, but it does get packed, so be warned. We walked in and requested a table. They said it would be a 2 hour wait, so we walked around for a couple hours. When we returned, the hostess seated us at the bar. We told her we wanted a table and she said all the tables were reserved for the next hour and a half. We had no choice, but to sit at the bar (even though we could have done so earlier; we only waited the two hours for a table). Anyway, the food was good, so I guess we could forgive the miscommunication. The chicken & waffles were delicious. The waffles were probably the best savory waffles I've ever had. They were simultaneously crispy and fluffy. The chicken had a unique and tasty seasoning, which brought a lot of flavor to the chicken. I asked for white meat, but they gave me one white and one dark. Strike two. The waffle Benedict looked good, but was not my favorite. I think the lemon sauce threw me. For dessert, I had a custard with grapefruit sorbet, which I did not like. The tartness of the grapefruit made the custard really sour and impossible to eat. The sweet toffee pudding, on the other hand, was way too sweet. I could actually feel the cavity forming!On my previous visit, I had the meatloaf which was pretty good. I also had the waffle fries, which were amazing (& addicting!), but they're no longer on the menu!

4.0,2/2/2016,"After hearing incredible things about their fried chicken, I've been meaning to check out Root & Bone for a while. Luckily they were participating in NYC's Restaurant Week 2016, and I was able to sample a variety of their southern comfort food offerings for brunch.First things first: make a reservation if you don't want to wait hours for a table. We ended up waiting about an hour and fifteen minutes for 2 people on a late Sunday afternoon. The food, however, is definitely worth the wait. After perusing the Restaurant Week brunch menu, we ended up ordering:+ Daisy's Angel Biscuits: super flaky and rich, with honey soaked into the top layers of the biscuit. I actually liked it better plain than with the savory jus on the side.+ Kale Salad: light and refreshing. The candied pecans added the perfect amount of sweet and crunch.+ Mac N Cheese: big noodles covered with a thick layer of rich, oozy cheesy goodness. I really liked the crunchy topping on this.+ Waffle Eggs Benedict: really delicious. The eggs were poached perfectly, and the buckwheat waffles had a great chewy bite to them. I wasn't a fan of the thick bacon on the side; it was tasty but a bit dried out.+ Shrimp & Grits: classic southern food. Very cheesy and rich, while the tomatoes and shrimp added a pop of freshness.+ Sticky Toffee Pudding with Butter Pecan Ice Cream: incredibly, almost overpoweringly sweet (even for someone with a huge sweet tooth!). It was delicious, but I could physically feel my blood sugar rising after eating it, and I was in a woozy sugar coma for the rest of the night. If you order this off their usual menu, consider splitting a portion with a friend.We sat at a counter by the windows, which was great for the natural lighting. Our service was also fine, but you could tell that that the servers/hosts were 100% done with Restaurant Week and brunch service.Overall, a really enjoyable meal.

4.0,2/1/2016,"RW - Brunch 1/31/16My second time here and my second restaurant for RW this year.PROS:- Kale Salad (roasted pumpkin, candied pecans, shaved pecorino & molasses vinagrette) - the salad was bursting with flavor. It's sweet and sour at the same time. Sweet from the peacans and yellow raisins. Sour from the molasses vinagrette. Loved it 4.5 STARS- Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits (honey roasted chicken jus, fresh thyme & tosated benne seed-sea salt). The biscuits were heaven. It was super moist and glazed with a little bit of honey. I definitely recommend you get this. 5 STARS- Benedict Waffles - Sunny Side Up Egg served on top of a waffle with thick cut bacon on the side. This also comes with a side of salad. The sunny side up egg was perfection. Loved it. Bacon was not bad but I prefer my bacon to be thin sliced and crispier. Side Salad was not bad. 4 STARS- Fried Chicken & Waffles (Dark meat) - Chicken was yummy but just a bit on the salty side. Buckwheat cheese waffles were great but at this point we were too full to finish the whole thing. 5 STARSTHE OKAY:- Creamy Grits (pimento cheese & corn) I'm not really a cheese person but this was alright. the grits tasted mostly like pimento cheese with a small kick of jalapeno or something. 2 STARSCONS:- Wait Time.

Both very delicious. The biscuits had a little glaze on it and came with a honey roasted chicken gravy which was light and perfect. We both got the infamous chicken and waffle. And it was all worth it. The chicken was delicious. The skin was crispy enough and cooked perfectly. It came with 2 tiny waffles with cheese. They served it with a whiskey maple syrup which didn't taste too sweet and sugary which was good. It was light and still very tasteful.For dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding. Delicious!Try their cocktails as well! I has the pistol punsch. It was sugar moonshine, rum cardamom, and pineapple. Could barely taste the liquor!

It wont be the best fried chicken you ever had, unless you were born in sugar factory.The shrimp & grits was really flavorful with bacon bits and onion. Not traditional, but I liked it. Starter of kale salad was a monster of a salad, with cheese, candied pecan, squash and kale on one plate, and was way too sweet. Mac & cheese on the side was delicious and nicely crusted although the noodles could have been more al dente. Dessert of citrus custard was a refreshing end, but the meringue chips were once again unnecessary.OK food, with too many components in everything.

Everyone gets a different plate because it's all vintage!! Super cute and hipster!!We ordered half a bucket of bird (fried chicken), a sweet tea, Mac n cheese, chicken and waffles, biscuits and this citrus custard dessert. Everything except for the sweet tea and bucket of bird was part of the brunch menu for restaurant week. The biscuits were good but with the dipping sauce (I'm not sure what it was) that came with it, it tasted even better!!! The fried chicken from the bucket of bird and fried chicken and waffles were delicious! It was juicy and the skin was crispy! They come with two sauces. The honey Tabasco and the whiskey syrup. Both are tasty!! The waffles had cheese melted on top and green onions. It was a good balance of sweet and salty!! Delicious as well!! Mac and cheese was good but I was too focused on the chicken!! If you like Mac and cheese deff get it!! :) The dessert that was part of the restaurant week menu wasn't all that. It was apparently too sour.

So when we went in around 8, we were asked if we had a rsvp, I said I told the curly haired girl about my prior phone conversation.  She didn't like my answer said that we have to wait about 15 minutes,  which ended up taking 30 minutes.  We were given seats on chef's table EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A TABLE FOR 2 WAS AVAILABLE.  So server was good until she brought the check to us and slammed it on the table.  Anyhow like I said FOOD was very good,  just didn't feel welcomed!!",0,0,0,Jan V.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",1,27,1

4.0,1/28/2016,"Outstanding! My friend and I came for dinner during restaurant week and ordered from their menu, which consists of three courses and costs $38, which is reasonable for the quality (and quantity) of the food. First, we tried the deviled eggs and the honey biscuit appetizers. The honey biscuits were moist and delicious and the crust had a nice crunch to it. The chicken jus that accompanies it gives it just the right amount of saltiness. The deviled eggs are the only reason I am giving this review 4 stars instead of five. The texture was a little too firm perhaps from over-pickling and the salt content of the filling was almost intolerable. Lastly, it didn't have much taste - it really could have used some heat and some crunch. The main course was their fried chicken and waffles and the short rib meatloaf. I am not sure why they call it a ""meatloaf"" since it is just braised short rib atop a root vegetable puree. It was tender and had a lot of umami, but it wasn't the best short rib I have had in New York (that prize would go to its neighbor, Beauty & Essex). The chicken and waffles, now that is something to write home about. You have a choice of white or dark meat and we ordered the white meat, which is usually harder to get right and to keep juicy. Well, this was about as good as chicken gets. The crust was flavorful and crunchy, the chicken was perfectly juicy and tender. The two sauces accompanying it, a whiskey sauce and a tabasco sauce, were both delicious. The waffle could have been crispier, but it was covered in melted cheese and scallions, so I won't complain. The desserts were both good, but the toffee bread pudding was incredible - as good as Gordon Ramsay's in Las Vegas. The service was very friendly and prompt. The vibe was intimate and cozy. It feels like you're sitting in a small, rustic farmhouse. This was an excellent meal and a great choice for restaurant week! What to Order: Honey biscuits; fried chicken and waffles; toffee bread pudding.Avoid: Deviled eggsPros:  Friendly service, amazing chickenCons: Hard to get a reservation (at least during restaurant week); those stupid deviled eggs. Would definitely recommend this place!",0,0,0,John S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,5,0

Condiments were great as well.  Tabasco honey which gave the chicken a wing flavor, and some type of syrup flavored with whiskey or something of that sort.

3.0,1/27/2016,"First of all, I'm from the south and had this place on my list after living in NYC for a couple years. I finally made it here for restaurant week. The menu (prix fixe and regular) had a good combination of classic southern foods. Since I'm an ovo-lacto vegetarian, I had the Drunken Deviled eggs, Waffle Benedict (bacon on the side for my boyfriend), and Citrus Custard. My boyfriend had the  Angel biscuits and chicken jus, chicken and waffles, and sticky toffee pudding. We both shared the Mac and cheese for the table. The appetizers were both on point! But the salad with the Waffle Benedict had dressing that had an unsettling taste. So did the custard. Not sure if the eggs used were expired or something. My bf tried both and agreed. He said his chicken and waffles was incredible, describing it as juicy (which is difficult when getting fried chicken I guess). His pudding was sensational as well. The Mac and cheese was absolutely delicious. Service was prompt and non-intrusive. I would give 4 or five stars if the egg dishes didn't put off a suspicious taste and our table wouldn't have been awkwardly placed and wobbly.",1,0,0,Cara T.,"New York, NY",69,12,4

For entree I had the famous chicken and waffles....it was just okay for me. Chicken was tender and crispy but my waffles were hard and tasted like it was made a couple of hours before serving. My cousin had some short rib entree and was not impressed...she said it was dry.

4.0,1/25/2016,"I visited Root & Bone during NYC Restaurant Week for lunch and was surprised by the delicious quality of the food. To be fair, I had heard the name pop up several times and had it bookmarked for a while, but the restaurant being a part of Rest-Week made it inexcusable to put it off any longer.  I went with the GF and split different appetizers and desserts but decided to go with the same main course. For the appetizer we had the biscuit with honey-chicken jus and the deviled eggs. The biscuits had a nice crunchy top layer and moist inside that fell apart when dipped in the jus. While that made eating it a bit more difficult, the flavors were all there so it made that irrelevant. The sweetness of the honey and savory tastes of the chicken blended perfectly. I was surprised by that harmony. With the deviled eggs, I know a ton of people go crazy for them, but I wasn't a fan of how the eggs were pickled. Don't get me wrong, they were still tasty, but the weird aftertaste from the egg was too odd for me to consider ordering it again. Especially when the biscuits were so delish. We both ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffles were coated in cheese and scallions (WOOT!) as a savory twist on the normally sweet breakfast food. It came with whiskey syrup (pretty good, but nothing I'd go crazy for). The chicken was fried well but wasn't the most juicy fried chicken I have tried. The coating was good and I enjoyed my two pieces of dark meat. They served it with a spicy sauce (forgot what was mixed with the tabasco), but it went well with the chicken (and the waffles!). Dessert was the bread pudding and the sticky toffee. The sherbet with the bread pudding is yummy but very tart, while the sticky toffee is overly sweet. I still enjoyed both desserts. Root & Bone is a fabulous choice for restaurant week.",4,3,2,Justin Y.,"Washington, DC",801,355,90

We ventured around the area for about 45 minutes since they text you when a table is available. The host told us that there were two seats at the bar, so of course, we took those two seats. I already knew what I wanted to get and my friend that's been here before knew as well. We both ordered the fried chicken and waffle, along with a side of Mac and cheese to share.The fried chicken was pretty unique.. It definitely had a flavor that I've never tasted before because the place probably makes their own blend of seasoning. I really liked the chicken. The waffle was pretty standard for a waffle. There was also a small side of salad that came with the fried chicken and waffle, which was alright. The Mac and cheese was surprisingly really, really good. I've had Mac and cheese at other places and those were alright but I highly enjoyed it here. It had a thyme crust and it was cheesy and delicious. My friend also enjoyed her chicken and waffle. Our waiter (I forgot his name) was really attentive even though he was continuously making drinks for the other customers. He kept refilling our water glass and made sure that it was always full.

2.0,1/24/2016,"I was really looking forward to trying Root & Bone. Sadly, it isn't my favorite fried chicken or waffles.  We came on a Friday night at about 5:45pm and were seated at the counter overlooking the kitchen.  It was fun to watch the cook prepare the foods. We ordered Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits, the deviled eggs, half a chicken and waffles, brussel sprouts and the mac 'n' cheese.  Everything was well prepared, but the prevailing taste in all of these things was overly sweet.  It was edible but felt like there was extra sugar in everything.  They also ruined the waffles for me by melting a piece of cheese on top of it.  The waffle lacked the crisp exterior that I normally like, so I guess the cheese didn't make it much worse. Overall, a disappointing experience.  Glad we'd had Bobwhite Counter earlier that day-good classic chicken and a great biscuit as well.",0,0,0,Tam V.,"San Francisco, CA",1,29,8

The fried chicken itself is quite moist and really not bad, but the waffles feel sort of like they came from IHOP, and there is too much cheddar atop them.  The 'whiskey' syrup also feels a bit gimmicky....pure maple syrup is just fine, thanks. If you want fried chicken and waffles I suggest pies and thighs or sweet chick....both much better.The biscuits here also fell short, a little too wet, I think, and not enough honey.  Again, it was presented quite well but the lesser fancy-looking joints just do this better.  We also had the beet salad....not bad for a beet salad, but nothing out of the ordinary either.If you want a nicely presented soul-food dinner with some solid bourbon, by all means come here, but if you're looking for delicious biscuits, fried chicken and waffles, you're better off heading elsewhere.",1,0,0,Stephen K.,"Manhattan, NY",98,78,7

5.0,1/16/2016,"Root and bone doesn't come short when you're looking for southern food in NY! The place is a little small and dainty for the amount of customers they have. If you're planning to go there during the weekend, making reservations would be a smart idea. Some of the highlights of the menu includes their delicious shrimp and grits. The grits is creamy with a gentle touch of cheese. Then there's the shrimp which has been chopped with the flavorful Virginia ham that now taste like bacon. Then the grits and shrimp are lightly flooded by this rich broth that elevates the rest of the dish with umami. Typically I don't like macaroni and cheese because it lacks flavor and finesse but when I came to root and bone, I knew it was something that I needed to try. I had no regrets after I ordered it. They used huge elbow pasta that allowed for the cheese sauce to flow inside which enabled every bite to be cheesy. Then there's the fried chicken that is very crispy. I appreciate the fact that the chicken isn't breaded and still very crispy. The meat was tender and moist. It is also a must get when you go to root and bone.

So glad we did too because I loved everything about this place from the atmosphere, to the service, and of course, the food. Luckily for us, there was no wait and the restaurant was surprisingly empty, although there were many people coming in and out to place/pick-up their takeout orders. We ordered the bucket of bird, and the fried chicken waffle sandwich. After taking our order, the waiter came back soon after and offered us their macaroni and cheese on the house! Never one to turn down food, we graciously accepted and joked that they must have known we were celebrating our anniversary. The bucket of bird is something my mouth still waters at when thinking about it! We loved how the chicken was crispy and juicy, and how we didn't feel super guilty after having eaten so much fried stuff. The fried chicken waffle sandwich was also delicious, but it's definitely something you have to eat right away. We had asked the waiter to pack them for us, but by the time we came around to eating it, the waffle and chicken had lost their crisp.

The hollandaise was lemony which worked surprisingly well with the pork. The pork itself was really thick cut yet super tender. It literally melted INTO my mouth :P My friends and I shared sides of the the deviled eggs and mac & cheese - both of which were amazing. I love this mac & cheese! They both got the fried chicken & waffle sandwich which I tried and really liked.I will 100% come back. The staff was attentive with everything: drinks, speed, smiles, etc. & the food was epic.

Immediately, its southern profile menu had us salivating and gearing to commute all the way to the city to try it out. Once C* found out the restaurant was headed by 2 Top Chef alumni's (which C* used to watch religiously...), she wanted to go even more. Upon entering the tiny and quaint restaurant, we were greeted by a nice hostess who led us to our table. After looking at the menu, C* and I decided to get the deviled eggs, the brisket biscuit appetizer, shrimp n grits, mac&cheese as our side, and the chicken & waffles. For dessert, I chose the peach cobbler, while C* chose the strawberry shortcake. We were pretty disappointed by the size of the appetizers (see our photos...) but somehow it filled us up. While the deviled eggs were delightful to me, C* didn't really appreciate it as much (she said it was too pickled for her taste). For the shrimp n grits which I ordered, the plate was too big for me to finish and it was slightly one-note for me. (I would give it a 3/5). For C* however, the chicken along with the mac&cheese was probably the highlight of the meal. I'm not a huge fried chicken fan, but I had to admit the chicken was cooked to perfection. We both agreed that the waffles were too soggy for us but still had good flavor. The mac&cheese however... THAT was probably one of the best mac & cheese's we ever had, and we've tried a lot of mac & cheese's - thanks to C*. Not only was it perfectly cheesy, but the crumbs on top just made the dish. Now, I will admit, i'm a huge dessert lover. I've had my share of amazing desserts. But no joke, this Peach Cobbler with panna cotta & graham cracker crumble was MIND BLOWING- the BEST dessert I ever had. It was so good, even C* (who hates desserts) thought it was pretty amazing. It had THE ripest, most sweetest peaches ever along with the graham cracker crumbles on top and the light yet creamy panna cotta. It was just so good, I can't even describe it to its full potential. *wipes tears of joy*All in all, not a bad meal. : ) Will definitely come back, mostly for the Peach Cobbler and the Mac&Cheese. bit.ly/1LeYNsqbit.ly/1lo0G1kbit.ly/1QnoGhFbit.ly/1PsAZJgbit.ly/1RUXJj4",4,2,6,Tina C.,"Plainview, NY",518,122,844

The Mac & Cheese was surprisingly impressive - I appreciated the cheesiness of it and how much of it there was (since it was a side order, and if we're being honest, most food establishments can be quite skimpy with their sides). My friend unfortunately didn't think much of her Farmers Omelet - she said it was lacking in flavor, and while I didn't try it myself, to be honest it didn't look too enticing to me. She ended up not even finishing it. For dessert we decided to share the Cream Cheese Pound Cake (which we saw upon walking in at the register display), which was unfortunately dry and disappointing - definitely not the best way to finish off an otherwise satisfying meal.

We ran down there (I live a block and a half away), walked in and said we just called.

I peek around the corner and the bar WAS open? but ok :) I had to give her my phone number so she could text me? really? I'm right here ... we go and sit out front (thank gosh it wasn't to cold) We only wait maybe 5 minutes Yea! time to eat, when we came back in the hostess was just flat and rude~ WHY? what the hek? makes you feel weird ~ you knowAfter sitting for like 10 minutes someone brought us water and menus...thanks? ok so we knew what we wanted to order, I looked at the waitress who handed us the menus thinking she was our server~my smile and eye contact (to kinda let her know we are ready to order now being there 20 minutes there and haven't even put in an order) was ignored. I hailed down another waitress and asked if we could put our order in~ she put it in. Great! We order the deviled eggs for an appetizer... but it came with our food which defeats the purpose~ and yuck! the were so gross... they die the eggs to be pink which is cool but they were cold and rubbery, not soft and fresh and the yoke cream had way too much dill, it gave me and my man a sour face at the same time.. that was a cool funny experience. Ok so I ordered half chicken, the one breast white meat was GREAT but the dark was funny tasting~mac n cheese absolutely no flavor~it came with bread crumbs but again no flavor.My man ordered the short rib meatloaf~which sounds so good. I'll start by saying they brought the smallest serving on a huge plate and it was pushed to one side like something was missing off the plate (we just looked at pictures on yelp and noticed his plate didn't get the carrots?)... bad presentation ~ he said he wouldn't even give the taste of his order one star,  he also ordered grits, which he normally loves, he was so upset at the lack of flavor in all of his food. He said he was hoping the food would make up for the service, but it didn't.   We shared the biscuits with honey, they were alright, nice and soft doughy inside~and the honey was good. I'd like to add, while we were waiting before we got seated the hostess rolled her eyes at us directly, no mistake about it. Whats with her? Over all the food was bad and the service was worse (I would like to mention the place was pretty slow). My man got funny and asked the original waitress ""are you guys really busy today"" she looks surprised ""um yeah~it's pretty steady""...... you look around and tables empty the bar was fully empty...i'd hate to be here on a busy Sunday. We sat there waiting for someone to clear our table offer dessert not that we would take a chance, nothing had flavor, didn't think it would start with the dessert. no one came? we had to wave anyone down to get our check.

4.0,1/9/2016,"Root and Bone has often been named the best Southern cooking in the city. The menu doesn't go far beyond fried chicken, but whenever fried chicken comes in a basket, you know you don't need anything else. The spoonbread side was the best dish, gooey and creamy and super filling. The wedge salad was nice as well, and a good way to break up the heavy dishes. You have to get waffles any time they are offered with fried chicken. It's an unwritten rule. Here, the waffles are sort of Eggo like with a crisp texture that would be boring if not for the excessive cheese and ample syrup provided. The texture is actually perfect for soaking up the excellent bourbon maple syrup. I doused mine in the hot sauce as well for a little kick and to cut through the heaviness of it. The chicken was super well fried, locking in the moisture in the inner meat, and providing a tasty, crunchy skin with lots of flavor, while not becoming oily. Due to the cramped space inside, small plate, and huge chicken pieces, I found eating the chicken separate from the waffle a better idea. Plus, while I think chicken goes with waffles well, it doesn't need to be eaten directly together. I mostly used the chicken to douse in syrup and hot sauce, then the waffles to soak it up. While the food was excellent and warm, the service was oddly cold and nearly hostile. Our waiter seemed to be way off and hardly spoke a word, including when he stepped on my foot without saying anything. It was most notable because the front desk staff was so friendly and warm. The cocktail menu looked interesting, but with a run a few hours away, I decided to try one of their craft beer pilsners which was pretty nice and held up well to the strong chicken and heavy dishes.",1,0,2,Tyler L.,"Wanaque, NJ",195,1631,1308
1.0,1/9/2016,"This restaurant was an absolute waste of our time and money. When we got there we were seated under a heater and I asked to be moved the hostess looked at me and said I'll see what I can do, when she came back she said I could seat you at another table but you have to eat and be out in an hour I told her I couldn't guarantee that she rolled her eyes and sat us at the table. When our server right to take order I questioned her about the waffle chicken sandwiches that I've seen posted, she told me that was only available on the lunch menu, when I said to her there is no lunch menu and I pulled up the Yelp reviews and their website it only lists brunch and supper, she then told me brunch is lunch, I then told her brunch is not lunch and we had come along way to this restaurant and I was disappointed that the sandwiches are not available. Her response was, our IT guy is here and I'll tell him to fix it on the website, she then suggested I get a half a chicken, order the waffles and make my own sandwich. My husband ordered the chicken soup and that is why you got one star he said it would really good, he also ordered the fish with the risotto which he said tasted very fishy there were two girls sitting next to us who also ordered the fish and comment that it was really fishy and they didn't eat it. I had the macaroni and cheese which frankly tasted like Velveeta cheese, it was just average nothing special.Obviously the server knew we were upset over our dinner when I ask her where the manager was she told me the manager was very busy and pointed her out. Yes the manager was busy sitting at the bar having a drink and chatting away with someone who was having dinner. The sever then came and told us there was a complimentary dessert for us, it was something sent by the kitchen it was small I think fried apple pies and ice cream. My husband said the ice cream was good the fried pies not so much, they were greasy and undercooked.We enjoy going out to eat and I pretty much research the restaurant when we go there. I was so surprised how poorly we were treated there and how terrible the food really was and just to let you know we did stay at that table over an hour because the service was so slow and there were empty tables the whole time we were there.",0,0,0,Loida O.,"Morristown, NJ",0,20,5

4.0,1/6/2016,"Ordered half chicken with waffles, the mac & cheese, the romaine salad and an Arnold Palmer.Mac & Cheese was pretty good. Right amount of cheesy gooeyness without being too overly salty.The romaine wedge salad was pretty good. Since they used a buttermilk blue cheese, you don't get that huge blue cheese punch you'd normally get (which I normally don't like). The dressing was pretty good with that subtle blue cheese taste.The chicken was decent. Normally when you get that size of a chicken, certain parts tend to get really dry. For the most part, it was pretty tender. Since it's brined in sweet tea, it does make it a bit sweeter than most savory fried chickens you come across.The buckwheat waffles were just okay. A bit too much on the salty side for me, especially with the cheddar on top of it.Trekking to Alphabet City always ends up being a long trek, but I had to try this place once.Note: I hear the biscuits and gravy are really good, but they didn't have them available the day I was there.

Love the semi rustic feel of the decor :)We got a few items to share:Bucket of Bird (we added the buckwheat waffles with whiskey maple syrup)The main attraction - I thought this was made very well, came out very fresh and crispy. Fried to a pretty deep golden brown. The buckwheat waffles that come with it are divine...I feel like it's chewier than a regular waffle, and I like that! Also comes with a delicious whiskey maple syrup :DChicken n Dumplings SoupI thought this was just OK, but a very hearty dish for a cold day! Very similar to gnocci in a chicken soup. It had bits of vegetables in there too (the regular carrots, celery).Cheese GritsI have never been a fan of cheese grits, but these grits...AHHH I would come back here just for that! It was SO good (most grits I've had are pretty one-tone and bland), super flavorful with texture. I don't know if their menu has changed recently, but when I had this a while ago, I feel like it had diced bell peppers in it to give it some crunch.

I had the waffle benedict and got to taste chicken and waffles as well as the spicy chicken sandwich. Everything was well cooked, a bit on the dry side but not terribly so. I really enjoyed the cute little waffles. Their house bacon was horrible, though. It came in a lovely chunk and was crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, but the pork smell was terrible. They did not cure it well. It was solid in terms of food, service, and decor, although it did not have a ""wow"" factor.

As you enter you feel the wood squeaking. I got seated right away as I went on a weekday afternoon at 12 and it was empty but by the time I got up it was packed and there was a line outside. This is a place to expect a line and a wait but it is worth it.We went with the M-F brunch menu which was $25 for an appetizer, entree, dessert, and Mac&cheese for the table. What more can a guy ask for? I never had deviled eggs before so I got that and my friend got the brisket biscuit. The deviled eggs were good just not my thing I prob won't get them again but the brisket biscuit was so delicious I could have eaten a million of them. For the entree we both went with the chicken & waffles which were awesome! The chicken was so moist, sweet, and fell apart in you mouth it was so good and when you put the bourbon syrup on top it's like a flavor explosion. The waffles with the cheese and salt on top dipped in the bourbon syrup was fantastic. This all came out at the same time with the Mac&Cheese which is a must get this is one of the best Mac&Cheese I have ever had. It is made with large elbows, bread crumb top, and gooey goodness in the middle.For desert I got the good ole favorite of chocolate pecan pie with vanilla ice cream on top.

But beware - it's a lot of food, so come hungry!We shared the 2 appetizers - deviled eggs and brisket biscuit sandwich. The eggs were just alright, but the brisket was delicious and perfectly balanced with the biscuit and pickles. We had to stick with the classic chicken and waffles for the entree. The prix fix menu option lets you choose white or dark meat, so we got one of each and shared. All of the pieces of chicken were so juicy and crispy, except for the breast which was slightly dry but still yummy! The waffles were very thick but sweet and had melted cheddar cheese on top. It also came with a bourbon maple syrup which I doused on everything. So good! For a side we got the mac and cheese with biscuit topping - enough said For dessert we both got chocolate pecan pie and yum!!! The chocolate crust was the best part. It was sticky and chocolately and came with vanilla ice cream which balanced it perfectly. All in all, it's a good brunch special, but if you don't do the special it can get pricey.

I came for brunch on a Sunday around 11am with a friend and we got a seat by the window bar.Chicken & Waffle Sandwich ($15) : A beloved dish from the patrons of the restaurant. It seems like everyone was ordering it and so did my friend. The waffles were incredibly soft and the chicken was very light. I don't even know how they were able to fry it without feeling heavy in your mouth when you eat it. Is ""high quality"" fried chicken even a thing? Apparently so. Beet Salad ($14?): At first, I was a little shocked about the price of the dish and what I got. ""No way this is worth $14"" I thought to myself...by the end of the meal and looking back, this was easily one of the best salads I have EVER had in my life. The beets were soft, the farmers cheese was creamy and fresh, and the mixed greens were tossed in a light vinaigrette. If there was anything I could change about the dish, it would be double the amount of lettuce mix on the plate. Mac & Cheese ($8): You think this mac & cheese won't fill one person, but it is so rich and creamy that it will.

We ordered the Grandma Daisy biscuits and the Half Bird Chicken basket with the cheddar waffles and split everything. The honey biscuits are divine, just slightly sweet with an awesome texture. The au jus that comes with it is spot on, too. I found myself alternating between dipping in the au jus and having it plain. It comes with a side of salt and herbs, which I recommend skipping. Way too much salt for me, but if that's your thing, go for it. Half bird basket was bomb dot com. Came out quickly and is definitely some of the better fried chicken I have ever had. Chicken was crispy and juicy. Server set down honey tobasco and whiskey maple syrups to go with the chicken. I loved both, but preferred the honey tobasco.

I will definitely be going back!*Side note: The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because we had a reservation but had to wait about 45 minutes to be seated.

4.0,11/23/2015,"This place is so close to perfect - I wish I could give it 5 stars. I'll certainly be back at another day/time to see if it makes the cut! Admittedly, I came in at an odd time for any restaurant - approximately 3:00 pm on a Friday afternoon. I'd been wanting to try Root & Bone for SO long, as it's in a neighborhood that I only come by about every other month. I walked in, a slight party of one - hoping to enjoy the brunch that a few other parties were in the midst of eating in the main dining rooms - and was promptly ignored by the host for a good 7 minutes (yeah, I timed it). From what I could tell, he was on the phone with a friend, and therefore couldn't be bothered to seat me. Finally, a female server noticed what was going on, tapped the host on the shoulder, gestured to me, and he waved her off in annoyance. A couple minutes later, she came over to me and asked if I'd like to be seated. I said yes, thank you, and she set me up with a table. The host never came over or acknowledged me in any way. One more [small] gripe: the entire restaurant was absolutely freezing, to the point that I, and all the other patrons that were in my line of sight were wearing their bulky winter coats at their tables. I understand heating is expensive in NYC, but eating with a parka on really makes for an awkward dining experience. I ordered the Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwich (incredible), and an absolutely lovely apple-based cocktail - not published on the online menu yet and the name is escaping me (sorry!) - that I'd recommend to absolutely anyone. The food here is A++. I honestly am really looking forward to come back at a more 'typical' time to see if there's a better front-of-house taking care of patrons who'd just like to...sit down.

4.0,11/22/2015,"Being a bit of a fried chicken lover, the sweet tea brined fried chicken lured me in. I mean, how much more southern can you get - Fried chicken + sweet tea?! Oh yum! Anyways, we came in on a Friday night and it was pretty crowded. But, we made reservations and were seated immediately (kudos point!). The open kitchen was a nice touch and hopefully next time we are able to reserve the booth seats. Now, onward to the food. I cannot deny that it was pretty sweet lickin' delicious. The fried chicken had a thick crispy skin with a strong lemon/citrus taste. While it may not work for others but I love citrusly food so it was extra points from me. We also got the waffle fries and the Mac and cheese. The waffles fries, oh man, they were pretty delicious. Their ""come back sauce"" really got us asking for more. It was very similar to a spicy horseradish mayo but it was pretty good. Now, this was were it fell. Yes, the Mac and cheese was good but it wasn't hot enough. The best part of a Mac and cheese is when you dig your fork in and it's oozing out cheese and you pull it off. Sadly, the Mac and cheese at root and bone did not have that.You can't finish your meal without dessert! Me and my partner chose the pecan pie with vanilla bourbon ice cream. The chocolate crust was pretty good but again the pie wasn't warm. You can't have a pie a la mode unless it's warm. However, the pie was okay but next time I come, we'll probably skip dessert here and look somewhere else.Pros: - sweet tea brined lemon dusted fried chicken. Don't forget to ask for the home made Tabasco honey sauce! Cons:- the temperature for both the Mac and cheese and pecan pie was not warm enough. If only they turned up the heat a bit more!

Case studies, that is. One case study, actually, involving me and companion. It's fine.Other findings included multiple ways in which Root & Bone gets it right where other places get it wrong--The venue is open: sunny, but not overexposed. The setting is crowded: cozy, but not cramped. The service is quick: casual, but not brusque. The food is comforting: creative, but not heavy.

1.0,11/21/2015,"I am very disappointed in my experience at Root & Bone. We went for my friend's birthday and they seated us 50 minutes after our reservation and the manager gave us a half assed apology and a free plate of $7 biscuits. The menu is confusing and the food was sub par. Background/Reservation DetailsI had been wanting to try this restaurant for a long time, and booked a reservation for Friday night at 9 pm for 3 for my friend's birthday. We checked in at 9, and were told that the table was having dessert. Fine, that's understandable, waiting a few minutes for our table.Then we kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting... I kept checking in with the host who kept assuring us the table was ""given the check"" or ""getting prepared"". After waiting 45+ minutes, we were pretty pissed. It was my friend's birthday and we had a reservation. It seemed like there was no point in making a reservation at all if they are going to seat you 50 minutes late and act like its not a big deal. To make matters worse, I asked to speak to the manager. Before that, she sent a waitress over with some free biscuits. Why wouldn't she bring the biscuits herself and deliver the apology? Then she came and talked to us. What I heard was a lot of excuses about how they had an 8 person party which took a long time, and they were very busy. She didn't want to acknowledge that they had poorly managed their tables and put us in a very sour mood for my friend's birthday celebration. FoodOn to the food, the menu is misleading and does not accurately describe a lot of the dishes. The chicken & dumplings small plate is actually a soup. Nowhere is it mentioned that it is actually a soup - why would a soup be under a small ""plate"" section?The brussel sprout side... Where to begin? It is called ""charred brussel sprouts"" but in actuality, there were 2 or 3 mushy and certainly not charred brussel sprouts in a bowl that contained apples, ham, and other greens. I just didn't understand the dish... fall mixed salad including apple, brussels, and ham may have been a more appropriate name.The fried chicken was passable.OverallAt least our waiter was sweet, other than that I can't say that I would come back here.

Too bad there was so much ice in the glass, I longed for more tea.The gooey corn spoon bread was really good when hot. It was presented in a cute, small cast iron pan, the texture of the spoon read was reminiscent of grit, soft, easily dissolved topped with gooey cheese and buttermilk sauce, with sprinklings of green onion on top.The fried chicken was the least exciting item ordered. It was pretty good but nothing special. The outside coating was crispy and nicely flavored, the inside moist and had some flavor from brining. This place is small but fits a good amount of guests and there's also outdoor seating for warmer days. There's a rustic feeling to the wooden tables and metal chairs, almost like being in someone's country kitchen.A minus of this place is the nonexistent service.

These were quite good and I would certainly order again, even if they are a little pricy for the quantity. The Bucket of Bird was my attempt to dig into the crux of the restaurant's mantra: ""casual yet elevated."" Well, it certainly was casual. Casual as in ""there is literally no way to eat these oversized nuggets of fried chicken with utensils"". However, on the elevated side it showed up a little short. It was delicious, as it was fried chicken, but it failed my Popeyes metric: if I would rather just go to Popeyes than order an establishment's fried chicken again, it probably wasn't worth going back to.That being said, I would probably come back to try their small plates and imbibe on more of their inspired cocktails.

5.0,10/5/2015,"Root & Bone is exactly what you would hope for from a southern comfort restaurant - homey, warm, small, friendly, and delicious.  Our waitress Raquel was a sweetheart and the service was incredibly fast with our meal hitting the table within 10 minutes.  The four of us shared Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits which were sweet and savory - you dip the biscuit in this delicious jus and then in some sea salt and sesame seeds.  So simple but so delicious.  Our baskets of fried chicken were exceptional - perfectly crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside, with a lemony hint to them.  The whiskey maple syrup and honey tabasco sauces were the perfect compliment.  For sides we had the buckwheat waffles, cheese grits, and mac and cheese. While all were good, the mac and cheese was the star to me - creamy and delicious - with the waffles a very close second.  We finished with the bourbon chocolate pecan pie which was the perfect ending to a fantastic meal.  Oh, and the leftover chicken heated up beautifully in the toasted oven the next night for dinner.  This place is an absolute gem and we cannot wait to go back again!!!",0,0,0,Allie M.,"New York, NY",0,36,7
4.0,10/4/2015,"My brother had been trying to get me to check this place out for a while now because he knows I love me some fried chicken! Haha. After finally giving it a taste, I can now say that Root & Bone's fried chicken definitely lives up to all it's hype! My boyfriend and I came in for brunch today and had an awesome meal. We started out with this delicious rainbow salad that I actually wanted to eat for once (I usually hate salads). Then we shared a spicy chicken sandwich with a side of waffle fries and signature bacon. The sandwich was HUGE, not because of an overpowering bun, like there normally is with burgers, but because there was this giant, perfectly seasoned, sweet and crispy fried chicken lodged in between a perfect balance of lettuce, bacon, and pickles. The waffles fries were fresh, crispy and hot with a surprisingly pleasant kick of dill. Finally, the bacon was everything! It was thick cut, sweet and crispy but soft at the same time. It was so delicious especially when cut into smaller pieces and eaten with waffle fries, sandwich style. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the space inside was a bit too tight for me. Other then that, the food was great! I'm definitely coming back but probably going to order pick up next time. Also, make sure to reserve a table in advance to avoid long waits!!",3,2,3,Sandy T.,"New York, NY",131,55,9

The fried chicken was perfectly fried and seasoned. It was served on a buckwheat waffle paired with a whiskey maple syrup. On the plate are some sweet radish and arugula that you can use to top on the chicken. The combination of all these ingredients made for such a good dish. The Mac n cheese was delicious.

To the contrary, it was kinda soft on half of the bird, and it was even missing on several pieces. I found that they seemed to care much less about the overall quality of the full bucket, as compared to the half, which was surprisingly disappointing.

The only disappointment was that its portion was way too small. Really just bite size. While we were eating, a group of people came in to put their names in the waiting list.

We came on Labor Day, so the restaurant was relatively empty and we got to sit outside to enjoy the last bits of summer. We were a group of 5 but somehow ended up ordering one of everything on the menu. Here's what you should get and what you could skip-Get; the fried chicken basket. Juicy, crispy, goodness! Even the white meat was juicy! The large basket comes as a whole chicken, the small basket comes half a chicken. A large basket fed a group a five. We also ordered the tots which are homemade and super delicious - however, they come like 3-4 in an order.You could probably skip; the mac and cheese. While it was good, the portion was small. The bacon was also skippable, it was just your run of the mill pork belly cut into bits. Lastly, we ordered the cheddar waffles which were a tad disappointing.

The biscuits were two tiny tiny squares of fluffy pastry. One bite and they are gone. The waitress did not think to tip us off on a table of three that one order would be a joke. Usually a good establishment will suggest 3, or just add one more as it is awkward to split two bites among three people. Besides the whole bird, everything is unusually small making this a poor choice if you want to share plates with others. Overall the atmosphere was nice, but our waitress last night was a total flake. She gave me a drink recommendation then brought something else, and completely forgot our green beans.

Not to my surprise it was cold.  I asked to have some fresh chicken and was given the same pieces a minute later, probably after they stuck them in the oven.   While waiting, we tried the biscuits ( 2 small pieces to an order) and once again we found them to be undercooked.  The watermelon was ok, spiced well with lemon and pepper.  Upon re-receiving the chicken, I sent it back because it was DRY!!  I could have given the restaurant another shot, but not after serving me dry fried chicken.  That was the deal breaker.",0,0,0,Angelica B.,"Kew Gardens, NY",125,6,0

The fried chicken was nothing special, it felt like it's been sitting out for a while before being served at the table. Buckwheat waffle is a nice idea, but lacks the crunch and crispiness of buttermilk waffles, flavors were not memorable. But the rubbery melted cheese on top was what really killed it. The melted cheese peeled right off the waffle and was just sad. I could've also do without the grilled romaine salad and tater tots. If you're ordering their tater tots don't expect to share with a group, a serving comes with 4 tater tots. Do yourself a favor and pass.

A great spot for locals and definitely worth the wait if you are in the area:) If you like comfort/soul food, this restaurant is the LES version (i.e. salad side dishes and root vegetables) a healthier alternative. Cons: Chicken is OK - tender yes. Flavor is OK (yes you can taste the marinades..etc) but it kind of needed more spices. Waffles were fantastic - light, soft, flavorful, perfecto! Poached eggs with hollandaise was perfecto! BUT note to chefs -- please please please try to fully dry the poached eggs before placing them on top of the mini waffles.

3.0,9/6/2015,"Root and Bone is certainly worth a trip but maybe not a return trip. The staff and service is great. It's so inviting and welcoming that you really want to love the place but the problem is that the menu reads better than it plates. The grilled peach caprese with pimento cheese has all the ingredients to be stellar but unfortunately the peaches were not at all ripe and even grilling them did not bring out any sweetness. Instead they were pleasingly crunchy but bland. The green tomatoes were missing the tang to really make them pop. It's a good thing that the fried pimento cheese is salty and delicious. Makes me wonder why is pimento cheese is not used in Mac and Cheese more often? Really though who am I kidding no one is coming to Root and Bone for heirloom salads - we're here for the chicken and it saddens to me to say that the chicken overall misses the mark. I love the idea of using a dried lemon dusting. I appreciate that the chicken is brined for 24 hours. It's a great back story, however, reality dictates it doesn't matter what you do in practice if the effort doesn't translate to game time. It's by no means bad but certain miscues prevent this yardbird from being crave worthy. The wing and drumstick are juicy and flavorful but seriously lack crunch. The wing especially was downright soggy. If you are going to leave the wing tip on, it should be a guilty pleasure to gnaw on - not the case here. Fortunately the breast and thigh bring the crunchiness and the meat remains tender and not too dry. Where things go awry is that there is no spice nor heat factor to balance the infused sweetness from the sweet tea brine and dried lemon dusting. I love lemon but in the execution I taste more sweetness in the citrus than acid. Even the Tabasco honey is far too sweet to liven things up.  Again hot honey is a great idea but there's just not enough heat to match the sweet here.So while the first few bites are tasty by the end it's like a plate of overly syrupy pancakes where it just becomes cloying, and almost a chore to finish - well at least for fried chicken.  Add to boot that a basket comes to over 20 dollars after tax it becomes hard to justify packing on the calories and cost without that rewarding decadence you should feel tearing into quality fried chicken. Maybe should I  come back, I'll run the risk of annoying the kitchen and nicely ask them to add more cayenne and black pepper before frying to see if that takes things to the next level.",0,0,0,Yoni Z.,"New York, NY",1,86,0
5.0,8/31/2015,"I finally got a reservation here after trying to snag one for my birthday back in June. It was well worth the wait - the food was great, from start to finish. The chicken and waffle appetizer was a perfect introduction - moist, juicy, not greasy. The honey tabasco concoction was a nice way to add a little something special, if you so desired. My entree consisted of two appetizers  - the Drunken Deviled Eggs (one of my fave things but this had a twist - the eggs were tinted a beautiful magenta pink and there were little pieces of beet on top as a garnish). The other appetizer was the Crispy Chicken Biscuits (i.e. mini sliders). I then indulged in a little dessert - the Apricot and Blackberry Cobbler with peach ice cream was so good, every bite was heaven. I have to go back soon to have it all again. And my cocktail, the Pistol Punsch, was just perfect - not too strong, but potent, fruity but not too sweet. Two big thumbs up!",2,0,1,Vonetta D.,"Brooklyn, NY",61,22,5
5.0,8/31/2015,"Super cute restaurant with slammin' food. This was probably one of the best meals I've ever had in my life. I know that sounds crazy to say that about brunch, but really. Drunken Deviled Eggs ($6): Handsome Brook Farm Catskills NY eggs, pickled roots, and topped with root chips. First, the eggs are pretty with a beautiful shade of pink and they were phenomenal. Maybe the best deviled eggs?Chicken Biscuits ($12): This combines two of their stellar dishes; Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits (NY honey roasted chicken jus, fresh thyme, and toasted benne seed sea salt) and Crispy Free-Range Chicken (Sweet tea brined, lemon dusted, Tabasco spiked honey). Topped with Tabasco pepper jam, pickles, and root chips. Everything was really, really good. Fluffy, crusted biscuits with flavorful chicken.Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwiches ($15): Whiskey maple syrup, pickled green tomato, watercress, and cheddar. Same great chicken with wonderful accompaniments and tasty waffles. Everything about this sandwich was amazing. Except that I wanted MORE.Root & Bone Signature Bacon ($7): Bourbon cured and smoked pork belly with spicy maple. This is one of the best housemade bacons ever. Delicious.

It remind me of a country inn. But the restaurant  is SMALL! they do have seating outside but it's small!.. so if you are having a large party call ahead! Our table were so close to the other table my friend  and I whispered  to each other LoL! Staff is super friendly and nice. I ordered  the half basket chicken with  the cheddar waffles and she ordered  the cod and Mac and cheese.  The chicken 5 stars!!! Fried to perfection, very juicy and seasoned well! The maple hot sauce yummmm. The waffle were good but I could have skip on it. Her cod was very tasty but if you are super hungry DON'T order the cod you will still be hungry after LoL. Mac and cheese supper yummy,  the right amount cheese and a crispy top! dessert  was not the BEST! Being it was like a ""southern restaurant"" we thought the dessert were to die for but it wasn't   We ordered the key lime ""ice cream"" cone and it was basically a cone with key lime filling and meringue on top very tart and not the best!

4.0,8/20/2015,"Summer RW Dinner - 7:30pm SaturdayWhat a cute place to dine! Rustic decor, very small and intimate - I love dining in the city like this. Very cool use of light fixtures with burbon glass jars, small floral arrangements scattered around the walls of the dining room, and bookshelves stacked with little chachkis makes you feel like you're in someone's home (more or less).What we ordered:     APPETIZER:          Drunken Deviled Eggs - Very very small portion, did they hard boil a quail egg or something? Taste was good, had a nice bite with the pickled roots, would be a perfect hors d'oeuvre if I were at a cocktail party.. but I wasn't so that was the only downfall.          Grilled Peach Salad - SO good. Grilled peaches are the absolute best & to have it in a salad with a FRIED pimento cheese croquette is just amazing. The heirloom tomatoes are extremely fresh and are crisp and refreshing.     ENTREE:          Spring Pea & Artichoke Rissotto - Perfectly cooked risotto, they used Farro instead of Arborio rice which I thought was a good twist. Within & a top the dish were asparagus, peas, tomato, basil, crispy sunchoke chips, and a dollop of masarpone cheese. A great mix of flavors and textures.          Braised Short Rib Meatloaf - Looks like your typical meatloaf but not your typical meatloaf. The meat itself was more on the pulled pork texture but still had the taste of meatloaf. Nice side of mashed (or what looks to be pureed) roots, and broccoli floretes.      SIDE:          Mac & Cheese - meh. Nothing special. More on the bland side, could have used a sharper cheese     DESSERT:          Peaches & Cream Dessert - Unfortunately, the peaches tasted like they were canned.          Ice cream sunday - Your average sunday with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. They added a little touch with the cookie crumbles. Service was good, didn't have a problem with our waiter. Tables are in close quarters so be careful when you're trying to tell a really juicy story... you might get some eavesdropping.Also for you Top Chef enthusiasts, not one, but two past season contenders are partnered in the restaurant.

1.0,8/20/2015,"I came here on a Wednesday night. It wasn't very crowded so we were seated right away. The decor of the place is cute, but here comes my review about the food & service..... I got the Half Bird, Macaroni & Cheese, and an Arnold Palmer.Half Bird - My picture is not filtered and it's not just the lighting..... the chicken really was that dark. Clearly, it was deep fried in really, really old oil. The ""half bird"" basket came with 4 pieces. A wing, drumstick, thigh, and I don't remember. But anyway, it didn't taste good at all. Just looking at it - it looked like it was deep fried a few times in really old oil. It just didn't taste fresh. And the meat was REALLY dry inside the thigh piece. I took a few bites of it and stopped eating. Too dry.Macaroni & Cheese - One word - salty. If you love really salty mac & cheese, I guess this is for you. Not me though.Arnold Palmer - lemonade + iced tea. This was only decent part of my meal. It's refreshingly sweet & sour. I recommend it, if you still choose to come here after my review.Service - Terrible. Horrible service. The restaurant was only half-full. Yet, all the servers were just standing around talking to each other near the open kitchen area. My friend and I kept looking around, raising our hands, trying to get someone to give us our check....... and we were ignored. They looked at us and continued talking to each other.I am extremely disappointed by this place.

I'd come here just for the biscuits if that's all they sold.I've been here multiple times; all the food is least good, and a few things are legitimately great. The specialty cocktails are pretty good, although a bit overpriced- even for the neighborhood- and not great. The more basic, southern-style drinks were some of the best; ie: Sweet Tea Arnold Palmer spiked with Peach Vodka.The atmosphere is intimate, casual, and not too over-the-top with the organic/forager/hipster/whatever vibe that's become all too common with establishments like this.

My friend had the peaches and cream, which I actually preferred.The only thing is I wish their place was bigger because it's pretty damn small and the tables are practically on top of one another.

2.0,8/12/2015,"I went here with my boyfriend for dinner on a Thursday around 9pm. We showed up without a reservation and it was an hour wait. So if you want to go, you should make a reservation.I'm first going to start off by saying that I was a bit skeptical of the popular ""chicken and waffles"", but heard it was great, so we went and tried it anyway.I ultimately wouldn't come back here. We both felt like we were punched in the stomach after our meal. I'm usually a bit sensitive to eats heavy foods, but my boyfriend can eat anything and feel great. So that's definitely saying something about the food here that even he felt sick.RESTAURANT OVERVIEW:-Small amount of seating outside on the sidewalk when it's warm (where we sat)-Small, quaint restaurant with a rustic feel-Casual/trendy/hipster vibeAPPS:-1 Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits: These are good, very buttery; However they only give you two little squares! A bit pricey for what they give you.-1 Macaroni & Cheese: This came in a small dish with thick pieces of cheesy macaroni baked with crumbled bread on top. This was good - not the best mac and cheese I've had, but it was good (it's hard for me NOT to like mac and cheese, like c'mon). It was a bit heavy though. For the amount of food we ate at this point, we were definitely filling up more than usual, so the ingredients must be VERY heavy (probably aided to my stomachache). DINNER:-We each got a Chicken & Waffles: Not a fan. I had heard so much hype about this, and it was definitely a let down. Maybe it's just personal preference on taste. But I realize that I prefer my waffles with some maple syrup. The sandwich comes in two halves. Waffle on the bottom (apparently it is cooked with maple syrup, but I didn't taste any syrup - just a plain very doughy waffle), layered with a pickled green tomato, the fried chicken, melted cheddar cheese on top of that, and then pickles. This was really hard to eat and the combo just did not taste right to me. The waffle itself - I've had much better. It was much too doughy for me. The fried chicken was VERY fried. It was many layers deep of fried bread before the chicken. Right after we were done I had the WORST stomachache I've had in years. I never get stomachaches! It felt like I was just punched in the gut. It was horrible. I could hardly walk home! Michael felt the same way.DRINKS:-Lady J Ivory: this was suggested to me after I told the waitress what my preferences are (I really like whiskey, old fashioneds, citrus tasting drinks, fresh ingredients). I didn't love it. It had a strange creamy taste.SERVICE:-Our waitress had a thick Russian accent, so she was a bit hard to understand.PRICE:-It was definitely pricey for the amount of food you get, but also for the actual food you get. I don't mind going somewhere pricey with small plates if the food is great, but when it isn't that great AND makes you feel like you just got punched, it is not worth it!Overall, I would not recommend this place.",2,0,1,Samantha L.,"Manhattan, NY",148,74,203

3.0,8/7/2015,"When did we put fried chicken on such a pedestal?Restaurant Week means booking tables at otherwise jam-packed restaurants. Luckily I was booking for a party of eight and Root & Bone took reservations. Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype.First off, we weren't seated until 7:55 for a 7:30 reservation. I know there are unpredictable things that happen during service, but that was just a little too long to be acceptable.Ordering was a little chaotic because our server took them in a bizarre order (she basically separated the table into units of four and took orders clockwise within that unit instead of just taking it as one table...). I went for the deviled eggs, fried chicken and waffles, mac and cheese and chilled watermelon for the table, and the peaches and cream.The food: the deviled eggs were good, perfectly creamy yolks with a strong dill presence. I liked the crunch of the chip on top, but aside from that, they were pretty normal. The eggs were also some of the smallest eggs I've seen, equivalent to no bigger than a single medium egg. I split my eggs with a biscuit order, and I was even less impressed. The biscuit was decent (buttery, fluffy, etc), but nothing was mind blowing and I had no idea what to do with the random sauces and toppings on the board. Appetizers just weren't that impressive and portions were tiny. The chicken was actually really good. The chicken was very moist and juicy, while the breading on the thicker parts of the meat were perfect. And that hot sauce: I doused every bite with the sweet spicy bottle! The only downsides were that the breading was a little heavy on the ends of each piece and that the waffles were a little soggy when served. I guess that comes with the territory of parties of eight. The mac and cheese was aight. The presentation and breading on top were pluses, but the macaroni itself was about average. The watermelon was the best thing to cut through the greasy chicken, although some pieces were just way too salty to eat. The real winner was the one guy that ordered the shrimp and grits. I only had a bite of the grits, but they were absolutely amazing. Definitely order that if you ever go.Dessert was also a bit disappointing. My panna cotta was very sweet and for lack of better words, flat. Each bite, I got a rush of sugar with hints of vanilla, but a second later it was gone and I didn't feel as if there was anything more to it. The crunchy oatmeal on top added necessary texture. The strawberry shortcake disappointed a few others because the cake wasn't really shortbread but a biscuit instead (which was pretty salty).So the meal had its highs and low, but service did no favors for the experience either. I couldn't tell if our server was having a bad day or had a bad case of RBF, but she made absolutely no effort to make us feel welcome. She didn't smile once and completely ignored me whenever I said thank you. There was a mixup in the entrees (and we admitted it was technically our bad), but our server kept repeating herself and wanted to make sure we understood she did nothing wrong and that it was all on us (""It's fine, I can get you another order, but I just want to let you know this is what you ordered and this is what I wrote down"").Overall the experience was soured by the service and I don't think the food was amazing enough to bring me back. If you've got a comfort food craving, are in the area, and they have tables open, by all means stop in. Otherwise though, it's not worth the trip for me.",2,0,0,Ben W.,"New York, NY",514,772,435
5.0,8/6/2015,"If you only go here for the strawberry shortcake, it was well worth the trip! I did brunch here. I started with the grilled peach salad that had a pimento cheese croquette. Anything with pimento cheese is immediately a win for me and this was an interesting combo. I also had a crab cake omelette that was moist and tasty. But the strawberry shortcake was... a game changer! I hail from below the Mason Dixon line and coming from a Southerner, this was the best dang strawberry shortcake I've EVER had y'all! I think it's worth mentioning that this was during restaurant week and while many many restaurants in nyc really fail at providing these multi courses at a reasonable price while maintaining the integrity of the food and the high service level, R&B did it with class. Well done.The atmosphere and attention to detail on the decor is worth pointing out...

4.0,8/6/2015,"Brunch seems to be big here and lasted well into the middle of the day. I'm glad I made reservations since it was also restaurant week which added on to their customer volume. Their RW '15 brunch menu ($25 pp) is offered Monday through Friday now so be sure to take advantage!! We started off with: DEVILED EGGS -- Root & Bone definitely earns the trophy for its lovely presentation on their deviled eggs. However, the consistency for these egg whites was so firm that it tasted a bit odd. The fillings didn't seem to offer much in terms of taste either. BBQ BRISKET BISCUIT -- This was so good! The shredded brisket was standard but the sauce they used was so good along with the flaky and buttery biscuit. It had just the right amount of sweetness and tanginess. Not to be skipped. CHICKEN & WAFFLES -- Being categorized as ""Southern comfort food"", I was expecting more of a southern-style fried chicken. Instead, it's brined in sweet tea for over 24 hours prior to lemon dusting it to soak up the grease from the crust. This method has won them the title of ""Best Fried Chicken of 2014"" in NYC. They do a fantastic job with retaining the chickens' crispy exterior while maintaining the tenderness of the meat. The honey tabasco sauce is the perfect accompaniment so be sure to drizzle some on. As for the buckwheat waffles, this tasted wonderful with the whiskey maple syrup. One word...DELICIOUS!   WAFFLE BENEDICT -- There's nothing like a soft, warm waffle to begin your day. This entrée was so satisfying. Root & Bone poaches their eggs flawlessly along with a perfect accompanying hollandaise sauce. It's so good it's definitely worth blowing up any diet. DON'T PASS ON THIS!MAC & CHEESE -- We chose this as our complimentary side instead of the chilled watermelon. It was a tough decision since I love both equally but I just can't say no to mac & cheese! It had a nice subtle cheese flavor to it and a crunchy textural component that came from the biscuit & thyme crust that was layered atop. STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE -- My boyfriend had first dibs on this and he dropped the whole biscuit into the strawberry consommé. Sadly, the biscuit became all soggy, underwhelming, and a bit difficult to eat thus I didn't get a chance to enjoy this. PEACHES 'N'CREAM -- Pretty much a vanilla panna cotta coated with poached peaches and an oatmeal crust. This was delightful and fresh. Yummy! My only criticism for this place is that the service was very low key. Also, the seating is somewhat cramped and I disliked the uncomfortable chairs. Do overlook this though because the food definitely speaks for itself. Overall, a solid choice for brunch that will provide you with all the comfort that you need.",7,2,2,Annie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",368,131,551

The seats are reminiscent of elementary school desks with the cubby on the side bottom. Oh wait, that's exactly what they were. Clever idea in theory, I suppose...I was able to store my purse in the cubby area, but the chairs were uncomfortable, and hard, and little. Felt like I was in 3rd grade all over again.On to the food...-Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits: WHOA. AMAZING. Appropriately titled. Heavenly, indeed. Must order. Thank me later.-Drunken Deviled Eggs: Very tasty. -Skrimp & Grits: Helloooo Flavor! I wish the texture of the grits was smoother, it was very thick and semi lumpy. Kind of gave me polenta vibes. But the dish was packed with flavor and I'd order it again, and again.-Fried Chicken & Waffle: The chicken is really delicious. Juicy, flavorful. YUM. Didn't try the waffle but my friend was underwhelmed with the cheese on it and the presentation overall. (It came in a basket and seemed fast food-ish). -Macaroni & Cheese: DISAPPOINTING. I assumed because everything else was so great, that would be also. Boy was I wrong. What kind of cheese is that? Velvetta? Nacho cheese from the movie theatre? I need answers.

Root & Bone designed like a rustic rural kitchen.  Our meals were served on cutesy floral mixed-match china. .

When I first entered, I had asked is this where you enter to be seated, I mean clearly there is one door but still, there was another couple in front wondering do they wait outside to be seated or go inside, anyway I had asked the question and a man behind the counter had responded yes and had a look of annonnce on his face after rolling his eyes; I mean I get it, it's the lower east side on a Sunday but the attitude was not needed, I then grabbed a menu and waited to be seated, first we were put to eat at the small bar in the back  with out even being asked  would we mind eating at the bar, then we was put outside bc apparently the tables were all reserved, the table outside was put on an angle and the cups and plate kept sliding down to my lap.

4.0,7/27/2015,"Good grub I must say.  The sweet tea brined chicken has a very distinct flavor.  You can taste the sweetness, juicyness and all around flavor the brine added.  It was seasoned but not salty. I felt it could've been a tad crispier but I'm not complaining.  They put their Tabasco & honey house sauce on the table for the chicken and whatever else.  I find that to be a really creative and cool mix.  I found that most of the sweet items were balanced by something salty and vice versa. The mac and cheese was how I like it creamy and made with al dente pasta.  The noodles were the large elbow shaped (can't remember the name of it).  Not the best I've ever had (I'm a mac & cheese snob) but definitely yummy. The crispy pork belly was my favorite but anything bacon related usually is.  The cheddar waffle with scallions were honestly better than I thought they'd be.  They could use a slightly better sauce than the maple syrup they serve it with but if it ain't broke..... The drinks were really yummy, old school/prohibition type of drinks.  Anytime you can use lavender in mixed drinks without an overwhelming aftertaste is ok by me.The ambience:  as with anything else in Manhattan it's very ""cozy"".  They chose to use old school themed school decor.  So many adorable little details except those chairs.  They're cute in theory but aren't the most comfy things nor is the fact that the chair legs get stuck around the table legs. Oh and the table for 2, even more than cozy, it's tiny. We had to remove our waters to make room for the 4 dishes, 2 drinks and 2 sauces.  Overall it's a really cute, nostalgic and homey place.  There's some creative decorations like the pendant lights, stools, mismatched dishes etc.  We went for brunch but I can see this being a romantic date night destination.  They really honor their reservations over walk-ins which I appreciated.  We were walk-ins but that's something I would appreciate if I had a reservation.  They said 45 min wait and that's about all it took.  We were in the first room near the ovens and my oh my were we sweating.  So maybe try and sit in the second room by the bar if you're not keen on sweat pouring out while you eat and drink liquor which makes it worse.  We didn't get dessert but there were some up by the cashier that looked good.  The staff is super friendly and accommodating.  Overall there's love and lots of thought put into everything.  I'd eat here again for sure!  Tip: You're surrounded by bars in the area including right on the corner near the restaurant.  Most with drink specials, just keep that in mind because $13 drinks can add up quickly.",3,0,1,Chevon B.,"Yonkers, NY",263,79,285

My sandwiches appeared at the same time as his deviled eggs. Perhaps it was my fault for not discussing this with the server when ordering, but I assumed since I had only ordered one item it would be brought out with my boyfriend's main course. My chicken was lukewarm and I thought the dish was too sweet overall, especially the waffles.At the end of our meal, my companion was told the ice cream sandwich he ordered at the beginning of our meal was now sold out.

The waffle itself is fluffy  and decadent, the chicken fried perfectly, and maybe the best part is the pickled green tomato. The deviled eggs appetizer was also mind bogglingly good and had yet another element of pickle, this time pickled beets.

My wife and I arrived on time (6:30pm) and were told that since we are not all here, they can't sit us (sure it happens). Now, mind you, my wife is 8 months pregnant, it is humid and hot, and the ""wait area"" is in the ""pickup"" area of the restaurant were there are a dozen of deep friers. Also, half the restaurant was empty (sat night, for a place that requires a credit card for a reservation). So the rest of our party arrived and they sat us down right next to the open kitchen, my wife asked politely if there is anything that can be done temperature wise. The not so nice waitress kinda shrugged and said, ""the air is on and we have fans working ,but because of out outdoor sitting area it is what it is "" (the door opens every second and more hot air flows in). Now, for starters for a restaurant that charges real prices on food, i would expect some real a/c especially if there are tons of friers right next to dining customers. Also, she did not offer us to move to a different table (where it would not be close to the door/kitchen) and she had an attitude.Also, it is always annoying to me that after i finish my course and lay my fork and knife on my plate in order to be taken away(meaning, I WANT YOU TO TAKE MY FLATWARE AWAY), that the waitress (Racquel) gave me a new napkin, took the flatware from my plate and put them on the fresh napkin (basically staining it and now it is dirty). Last time i checked i'm in a real restaurant, what are you being cheap on flatware with me? and it's really stupid to make the fresh napkin you just gave dirty. So I asked for a couple more napkins , and she kinda gave me an attitude about that as well. All this as we are happily sweating our way to dehydration.Food, some courses are good, some are just ok:1. the watermelon is nice2. the grilled corn is good3. the deviled eggs are far from good (first of all the egg white itself is really stiff and cold ,and while presentation is nice, the flavor is far from the creative deviled eggs that many places started offering lately)4. The shortrib ""meatloaf"" is bad. (funny because i just had a wonderful elevated meatloaf just last week at narcissa, so it's definitely doable)5.The pork chop meat is actually delicious. the best thing i had here. the onion rings that come with it are meh. If you know what they taste like at del-frisco's, it doesn't even come close.6. The FRIED CHICKEN, OH THE FRIED CHICKEN. First of all, i'm from Israel, and while we adore schnitzles, the obsession about fried chicken in the states keeps fascinating me. The batter/cover was soggy, couldn't detect any seasoning, any spices/herbs and doesn't add much to the bird. the portions are big though. all and all - MEH.7. The beer selection really lacks, not as crafty/with options as it should be in a place like that.8. the borbon list is impressive though.9. We didn't stick around for dessert, we were too hot and i didn't really feel giving this place any more of my money.10. the water isn't cold11. Nespresso coffee. SERIOUSLY?so it's a meh food, with some cranky/snobby attitude, and no southern hospitality/comfort. p.s it's the first time in a long long time that i cut down on the tip. having an attitude, cheaping out on the flatware, and being insensitive to a pregnant woman's requests. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.",4,3,2,Ron P.,"Manhattan, NY",43,51,2
4.0,7/16/2015,"It's been a year since I was first at this place, and one thing is for sure - the heat has cooled off some. Seated almost immediately vs waiting 2 hours when it first opened. The cooking has cooled off too, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.The cocktails are fairly inventive, but are generally on the sweet side, so, be forewarned.The biscuits are a must-get to start the meal. The jus that the biscuits are meant to be dipped in has lost a little intensity over the year, but it's still a fine fine thing, the biscuits warm and sweet, with salt and sesame seeds in the corner to be scattered upon.The deviled eggs? So East Village/Brooklyn 2015. It's totally unnecessary to charge something like 10 dollars for three halves of a deviled egg (again, what is the point of serving three pieces of an appetizer when your most common table combinations are 2 and 4, other than a cash grab to try to get two orders? Either charge an extra buck or two for the OTHER HALF of the egg, or just give two pieces and cut the price).  The flavor is a little more interesting than your typical deviled egg, but the egg is smaller, and....curiously lavender-colored. I suspect my old mortal enemy...beets.Between the cheesy grits and the shrimp and grits, go for the shrimp and grits. The shrimp is still moist and mildly chewy, the ham and onions add flavor, and the overall flavor and texture are more interesting than the cheesy grits, which are both a bit gummy due to the cheese, and as with most cheese grits in restaurants, lacking in actual cheese flavor.Similarly, the mac and cheese is lacking in cheese flavor, and needs some salt. Is it a passable mac and cheese? Sure, because it's very difficult for a restaurant made mac and cheese to really get that cheesiness down without it congealing quickly.The fried chicken is a little more interesting than run of the mill fried chicken, due to the sweet tea brine, the added lemons, and the powdered sugar, but this is not Commodore/Redhead level fried chicken. This is Sweet Chick or Birds and Bubbles level fried chicken - better than average, but not superlative.If you're in the area, have a small group of 4 or less that is too classy for the Blue Ribbon takeout spot a few blocks away, but NOT too classy to fight over that half of a deviled egg, then root and bone is a good spot for a friend dinner or not-too-expensive but still impress-a-date dinner that you'll be too full afterwards for a makeout sesh.",2,0,0,Brady B.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",18,62,48
5.0,7/12/2015,"Been dying to try this place for months. I have heard great things about the fried chicken from various friends, but never had the time to check it out. The few times I passed by it was noticeably packed, luckily when I went over the weekend, my friends and I were able to get seated right away (it was during lunch time too!!).First impressions right when we sat down? The restaurant had a lovely atmosphere, I loved the decor and the rustic vibe of the restaurant. Our table was near the bar and we noticed that the tap handles were animal bones (not sure if real, but cool nonetheless). We ordered the Crispy Free-Range Bucket of Bird, Macaroni & Cheese, Crispy House Made Tater Tots and the Root & Bone Signature Bacon. To our surprise, the Mac & Cheese and Tater Tots were surprisingly light. My favorite sides out of the three we ordered was the signature bacon. It's not the traditional bacon that most people think of when they hear 'bacon', it was something even better, pork belly! I believe it was glazed with maple or brown sugar, that gave it a delicious sweet kick. The fried chicken definitely matched up to my expectations. It was probably the BEST fried chicken I ever had; the skin was crunchy and the meat was juicy. Usually I would just lie down and try not to cry while eating fried chicken with dry meat. This time however, the only tears I had were tears of joy; how can someone make such delicious fried chicken? There was a special hot sauce the waitress brought out that paired well with the chicken. It was spicy and sweet, perhaps hot sauce mixed with honey.After our delicious meal, I thought nothing else would make our experience at Root & Bone better than the decor and the food. Boy, was I wrong. Our check came rolled up and tucked inside a piece of bone! How awesome is that?! 10/10 would recommend this place. Next time, I'm coming back to try the Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwich.",0,0,0,Kenneth C.,"Brooklyn, NY",376,3,2
5.0,7/12/2015,"There is something about a good brine that's harder to find than you would think. Root and bone adds a pickled layer to their dishes that brings a beautiful sweetness, bringing your fork immediately back for another bite. My friend and i shared a Grilled Peach Caprese, which came with the R&B pickled green tomatoes and a fried croquette of pimento cheese. This resulted in a bite of creamy cheese, sweet tomato, and mellow peach. Absolutely lovely. The chicken and waffles (sandwich) were similarly brought to life by a slice of the green tomato, but i don't think i could crown them as true chicken and waffles. In their current sandwich form, they didn't bring the crunch and indulgent breakfast attitude. Delicious, but I'll be checking out other menu items next time.BTW: I love a place that can pull off mismatched dainty china. +100 points!",0,0,0,Jessica H.,"New York, NY",557,117,97

4.0,7/10/2015,"We got the prix fixe menu for a group of 6. The waitress was great and we all loved the ambiance. It was a hearty amount of food though not cheap for $65pp before drinks. I will say one thing off the bat that annoyed me and to warn others to be clear about if you get the prix fixe. They decided not to give us one of the desserts (of course the one I most looked forward to - the cobbler) and when I mentioned we hadn't received it yet the server went to check and came back telling us ""the chef said we had enough dessert for 6 people"". We paid for a menu that consisted of 3 desserts. Yes we were full at that point so we weren't going to make a fuss, but it is not up to the chef to cut us off and decide he doesn't want to give it to us. I would recommend confirming that you get everything on the menu if you go this route too bc we did receive all other items listed so clearly should have gotten this as well.  Some of the food was phenomenal like the biscuits and deviled eggs. Mac and cheese and short rib meatloaf were also big winners. The lemon custard dessert was light and fresh and I agree with other reviews that the ice cream sandwich was underwhelming and difficult to actually eat. The fried chicken tasted great although not as crunchy as I expected and the shrimp and grits, while being in this delicious jus were really salty from the ham. I did really enjoy the honey got sauce that came with the chicken. I also really enjoyed the grilled romaine salad.

I just didn't find it very flavorful and the texture wasn't great.Tried a couple apps/sides - tater tots were decent but I've definitely had better; biscuits and deviled eggs were pretty good but also didn't stand out.The blueberry & lemon dessert was pretty good and served in a cute mason jar. The ice cream sandwich dessert was kind of disappointing and was very unfortunately served. See photo. Was served on a cutting board and melted all over the place. It came with 2 ice cream sandwiches (second not pictured).The Colonel's daughter drink was just OK. We were told all their beers were warm except for the stout and the large bottle of farmhouse ale.

This insulting effort reminds me of Bob White's, also in the area, who start out charging you a lot of money, but give you large pieces.

The chicken was cooked well but didn't melt in my mouth like I had hoped. Fried chicken should contain 2 things: a crunchy skin and a moist flesh. Unfortunately for my taste, it didn't quite deliver. The biscuit appetizer, however, was delicious. Even though they're tiny and expensive (like $7 for 2 small biscuits), it was damn good.",1,1,0,Sam C.,"Manhattan, NY",545,62,31
3.0,7/1/2015,"5+ stars for the food, but the service and atmosphere took this restaurant down a few notches for me.On the food: The chicken & waffles is indeed delicious, although the waffles were a bit dry (IMO). I also don't drench my waffles in syrup (I actually didn't use any at all), so take that as you will. The chicken is some of the best fried chicken I have ever eaten. It's crispy yet still very juicy, and inherently meaty (this is no lame piece of chicken). I was pleased.The deviled eggs are outstanding. Strangely though, we were served three halves, meaning one and a half eggs for two people. Meh.I ordered the short rib meatloaf, which was actually exquisite and unexpected. I was very glad to see the portions were not as homely as I thought they might be. This is good, especially considering the price. The meat could have been seasoned better, but that's the only criticism I have of the dish.On the service: Our waitress was polite, and that was about it. She wasn't very attentive; I think she came to our table exactly two times - to initially pour some water and later to take our order (she did bring us one round of drinks after that). I had to find her and request our check. A very nice man served us all our food. For what dinner for two cost (it was about $100, only one drink each and no dessert), we expected our server to at least ask us if we were enjoying our meal.On the atmosphere:It might have been our timing, but the crowd wasn't exactly neighborhood authentic when we had dinner (on a Wednesday night), which was unexpected. I can see why this restaurant would do well with people from other neighborhoods and out of town. The decor is lovely, although I found myself feeling as if I were at a potluck rather than a nice restaurant. The unique, mismatched plates add warm charm, and the decorative details have not been overlooked here. There's a boxcar layout to the restaurant, so when you walk in, you're at the take-out counter, which was packed. Through a small entrance on your right is the main dining room and kitchen/kitchen counter, and through another door is the back dining room and the bar. It's not ideal, but R&B makes the most of its layout and acquired spaces.If in the mood, I would definitely order food from R&B again, perhaps even hop in line at the take-out counter (some of the desserts and treats looked amazing).

The cocktails on the menu were also fabulous. They're crafted and mixed so well that you don't even feel like you're having a cocktail but some delicious juice.

The watery Tabasco whiskey syrup really wasn't much more help. Mac and cheese- Delish prob our favorite dish of the night. But not saying much since there's plenty of good Mac and cheese all over nyc. Short rib meatloaf with grits- this was mediocre, a bit on the dry side.

WonderfulDeviled eggs- very good a great presentation Mac and cheese- one word BLAHChicken- for a place to be know for their chicken and boasting about it I was like uh wtf. The flavor was good and it was moist, like too moist to the point where it was soggy. Like they fried the chicken and put it in a steamer after. Ew Waffles- also soggy and just blah with a slice of cheese on them, clearly been sitting for a while, tasted stale. pork chop- undercooked and burnt(i guess the word is charred) at the same time, AMAZING!! (please note this is sarcasm). The onion rings served with this are on point though.   Sticky toffee pudding- really good. Shaped into balls served with amazing ice cream and some soupy sauce. Star of the meal glad we had it last. Dranks. I think that every restaurant should have at least one drink on their menu containing one of every spirit. I went with 5 people all vodka drinkers, drink menu was all whiskey and gin. We all had one drink because although they were good drinks they weren't for us.

Our server was really friendly and our water glasses were refilled promptly (I tend to chug my water, so this is something that I really notice and appreciate, and I have to say that many restaurants don't do a great job with it). Side note - I made a last-minute reservation and we ended up having to go on the early side (10:30 on a weekend) for brunch. I noticed that it was fairly full when we got there, got very busy from about 11:00 to 12:00, and was only about half full by 12:00.

4.0,6/1/2015,"Y'all wanna know right away that the chicken was yummy and flavorful. This is no average bird and clearly raised for such frying activities. However, my personal taste leans towards crispier, crunchier coating, which this wasnt. I also prefer a bit more juicy bird, dripping down my finger utensils.  What was consistently dripping is the Tobasco honey syrup and the slightly sweeter maple syrup that are drench worthy on pretty much everything from hot butter biscuits to chicken and waffles. PS I didnt get the waffles coz its filler.  Carbs, who needs them, right? Can I get an amen? Ok Ok i did have the chicken sandwich on a biscuit as a starter, coz i sure lovez me some chicken.  Washed down with an refreshing muddled gin cocktail. Forgot the name but it was green and tasty.  The pickled okra and other pickled fixins were addictive if you like anything pickled period.

3.0,5/27/2015,First and foremost - the food here is very good. I enjoyed every dish I had and wished I had more! The chicken is definitely what sells this place as every other yelp review has stated. My gripe is with the prices and the portions. I live in NYC so I know there is a certain price expectation but this restaurant is priced quite high for a comfort-food spot. Portions are (although tasty) SMALL so you will want to order multiple dishes. Top that with $15 bourbon and you can have a lunch bill on par with more well-known establishments. I am happy I tried lunch here but I am just not jumping to go back. My average meal size very well could be larger than what this restaurant is going for so I can't completely knock them.

5.0,5/26/2015,"Actually my favorite brunch in New York. It's hard for me to claim a favorite but this has all the other ones beat, to be honest. If you just listen to the waiters describe the fried chicken your mouth will just start watering and drool will just cover your your shirt. They dehydrate lemon slices, pulverize them, and use that for the batter for the fried chicken. That hint of citrus is just so perfect for this fried chicken. I feel in love, seriously. Order the Grandma Daisy's biscuits as well. It's a delicious biscuit that come with au jus, salt, and some other things to sprinkle on top. Honestly dipping the biscuits in the au jus and sprinkling a little sea salt made these biscuits superbly delectable. Warning: Bacon is super thick cut, but is crispy given the thickness. I probably wouldn't order it unless there's a huge group because you WILL NOT be able to eat all of it. It's quite a lot of grease for one stomach to handle on top of everything else. Waiters are super friendly and try to explain the food and how it's made. Listen or don't but it's kind of cool. Oh, do make reservations or else go early like right when they open.

I can rant and rave about this, I love my fried chicken and this place just takes it to another level. You haven't had top notch southern fried chicken until you've tried root and bone. Just make sure you are ready for a wait, especially on Fridays and weekends. A small hint though - I could do without the buckwheat waffles! The chicken is amazing on it's own and is a standout (of course!). They do restaurant week, but I actually think just ordering from the menu is much more worthwhile (it's cheaper and you get more bang for your buck!). It's a small space, and it's really not good for groups of more than 6 (in actuality I think 2-4 is ideal).

The chicken is moist and tender, perhaps the best version of the this I've had outside of Harlem. I hope David Chang is bringing his A game to Fugu, a fried chicken restaurant that is soon to open in the same area. There are just a couple of beers on tap, with nothing particularly innovative to wash down the chicken. Sides are also a mixed bag: the chicken sandwiches (technically an appetizer, but they arrived at the same time as our main course) were very well done, but I thought the mac and cheese was under flavored.Service was handled by four waiters and waitresses, each delivering a portion of the meal.

4.0,5/11/2015,"Unreal Southern food & drink experience at Root & Bone. I made a reservation about a month in advance for 5 pm, which was a little earlier than I would have wanted to eat, but they ended up calling me and switching it to 8, which was perfect! They take walk-ins, but it's usually a wait, so I opted for the far in advance reservation. When we got there there was a rehearsal dinner just letting out, so the place was empty, and they sat us right away. The only negative thing I could say about the whole experience was that it felt a little rushed - they asked us for food orders as soon as we sat down, and we hadn't even looked at the menu yet. The waitstaff was very friendly, though and told us how they fry the chicken and what their most popular items were. We both ordered Pistol Punschs from the drink menu that came out in little teacups and were amazing. You could taste the sugar moonshine but it went down very easy. For main course we ordered the half chicken, green beans, and mac and cheese to split. It was A LOT of food, but we were starving so it worked out. The sides are very generous portions just to warn you, but I would definitely opt for the mac and cheese if you can. The chicken was done so perfectly well, unlike any other fried chicken I've ever had before, and the half order was perfect for two with all the sides. I would have liked to try the biscuits, so will definitely be coming back for that.The ambiance is definitely chic with dim lights, mason jar fixtures, and a wooden/industrial feel. Tables are pretty small, so don't expect to go with a large group. Everything seemed very rehearsed and quick, which was great on one hand, but I did feel rushed throughout the meal and would have liked to have spent less than 45 minutes at the table.

Not an intimate seating arrangement for a couple who's celebrating their one year anniversary? I am not a drinker and do not like to be around liquor so I was kind of annoyed that the host didn't even care to ask if I would have minded sitting at the bar. When I got seated I asked is there anything else available that's not here? And she replied oh those seats are reserved which I completely understand but she didn't even care to ask in the beginning? Even a Chilis does that. For an hour wait I thought I would actually have a table. Wouldn't that have the been appropriate thing to do? Anyways the food was okay. The chicken was really amazing.

But then...Seriously disappointed by the experience!I was so excited to eat this fried chicken that I had read about in the most recent Time Out NY. I even prepared that day by eating a small breakfast and a salad for lunch to prepare for the high calorie goodness. All just to be disappointed :(We started with the daisy biscuits. It was loud in the restaurant and the waitress was on the other side of the table so I couldn't hear well. I thought the biscuits she was bring were something complementary. You know, a small tasting that the house offers you. Some restaurants do that. I thought that because the biscuits were TINY. I mean the size you'd probably offer to a toddler. And there were only two. I've pictures others have posted on yelp where there are three biscuits and where the biscuits themselves were much bigger. So inconsistent! Our biscuits were so small that we had trouble cutting them in half so that the 4 of us would each get a half. I mean c'mon! And here's the kicker - the 2 biscuits (and some chicken jus) was SEVEN BUCKS! What the?? I wish I would have taken pictures so I could show how small....Anyway - on to the main event - the fried chicken! We ordered the whole bird for the 4 of us. How does anyone served fried chicken where the skin isn't super super crispy? Non crispy skin on fried chicken should be illegal to serve. Period. This was only partially crispy in certain spots and flaccid (yes, flaccid) in others. And it needed a little more flavor.The sides of mac and cheese and the girts were also nothing to get excited about.

For a Wednesday night for 3 people, we ended up waiting an hour for a table. There is a lot of bar seating but a table is nice if you want to share and are more than 2 people. The chicken! They marinate it in sweet tea, fry it and dust it with lemon powder. The lemon powder is such a nice addition to fried chicken. I don't think I've ever had fried chicken with lemon of any sort in it. It adds a brightness to the fried chicken. We also had the angel biscuits. At first I thought they skimped on the size of the biscuits since the are the smallest biscuits I've ever seen! But man are they delicious. If they are any bigger, I wouldn't have had enough room for the rest of the food!We also got the Mac and cheese. I was disappointed in this. It was the only thing that didn't wow me. It tasted a little like velveeta shells and cheese, which is delicious, just not what I want to have at a restaurant. The charred green beans with a tomato based sauce were delicious. The short rib meatloaf was more short rib than meatloaf (which I love). For dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding.

The excellent wait staff who know the menu intimately and provide the perfect blend of service and witty repartee? The fun cocktail names? ( I recommend the Kill Devil Hills - dusted with ground pepper and served in a teacup) The menu? Ok - we'll talk about the menu. American and in particular Southern and Soul Food classics are given an update for the 21st century palate. The must order were Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits with a chicken jus flavoured with thyme. They were light and buttery and though to an Australian, a scone dipped in gravy is an unusual starter, they lived up to their reputation.The baskets of fried chicken coming out to the tables looked unbelievably good but we didn't order any for ourselves as we were visiting Soul Food Mecca Sylvia's, the next day. We enjoyed a little taste of chicken on a pair of sliders topped with slices of picked green tomato and okra. The grits were an absolute revelation, loaded with fresh corn and cream, topped with cornbread crumbs and gratineed. The bowl could have been double the size and we would have kept eating. I bet the grits aren't as good in South Carolina. Fantastic value too at $8. A plate of roasted root vegetables served with pickled grapes and carrot top pesto rounded out the meal. The only dessert we ordered during our 12 days in NYC was the tangy apple pie with lattice cheese pastry. The apples were sweet and tart and perfectly aldente. The pie was delicately spiced, applied with a restrained hand. It was accompanied with a cheddar cheese ice cream which probably sounded a little more exciting that it tasted but certainly a creamy foil to the sharp apple pie perfection.The chef de cuisine is indeed from Australia and to me at least, it was obvious. The treatment and promotion of vegetables and salads, a mix of fresh and cooked ingredients in dishes, interesting accompaniments such as pickled grapes and a general lightness in prep and presentation of the dishes.

Waited for a table as I didn't feel like sitting at the counter. I was a huge fan of Yardbird in Miami where they were both chefs and go almost every time I'm in Miami so I was looking forward to the experience at Root and Bone. Apparently they left with some drama - but whatever - welcome to New York! We ended up getting a table amongst many an east village or out of town youngin. We ordered the bisquits, one chicken waffle sandwich, a side of scrambled eggs, shrimp and grits half portion and two drinks: a Bloody Mary and the Colonels daughter. The bisquits with thyme/honey dipping sauce and seeds and salt on the side were fantastic. The bisquits were warm and buttery and the sauce delicious. The shrimp and grits were also amazing and we scooped up every bit of the grits and lager goodness with the plump shrimp. The chicken waffle was good - a fluffy buckewheat waffle and juicy chicken - but not as great as the bisquits or shrimp. I loved the chicken and waffles at Yardbird so I will try the cheddar waffles and the chicken another time. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and light - just the way I like them. The drinks were meh. We had the sticky toffee pudding with stout ice cream for desert - yuuuuuuum. Another dish we were scrapping the bottom of the plate with. Great brunch spot - go get some.

I literally debated asking for an order of pork belly bacon to go, lol. We also appreciated the service.

1.0,4/18/2015,"This place typifies what's going on in the restaurant world in and around the East Village and LES. Namely: overpraised, overpriced, over-hyped mundane fare served with copious amounts of attitude.  My wife and i recently showed at this Alphabet City  joint about 5:30PM on a Tuesday (!) nite sans lunch, w/o a reservation (Yelp says they take none) and ready for this supposedly glorious experience.  The place was empty but for one table and a couple of folks at the bar surfing the net (whatever-who does that??).  This hostess (you know the brand:  NYU dropout ""trying"" modeling) with a imperious flair wondered about a reservation.  I told her i was under the impression the place didn't take reservations .  She replied with a sniff and a mumble and led us to two stools by the window and said we could have these ""seats"" if we'd be gone in an hour.  Did you hear me?  the place was EMPTY. Not a good start.The food was good albeit unmemorable.  The chicken's really tasty, the deviled eggs OK, and a couple salads which were really nice.   But too much $$$ for not enough food. Said fare nowhere near the top ten on any list, tho. And, continuing in the earlier vein (a pattern here) these insufferable people ( owners, operators, servers and the staff preparing) clearly are under the impression they are in line for the Nobel or had ironed out the ISIS problem.  For Chrissake, they're slinging fried chicken in a ""modest"" storefront in, despite the rents and beautiful folks about, what remains a sketchy, unpleasant, filthy nabe. I purposely lingered until about 6:45 just to witness the cascading crowds necessitating my earlier vacate order.  Those crowds did not materialize.  The place was nowhere near half full  as i left muttering.Decent food, indecent aggravation.  never again.",3,1,0,Sean M.,"Westfield, NJ",0,7,0

It was a 45 minute wait on Friday night, but that was to be expected. We grabbed drinks at a bar nearby until we were called. They seated us at the counter, which I absolutely loved because we got to watch the chefs in action and they were awesomely cool and happy to answer any questions we had. They also gave us a little background about the restaurant and how they made the chicken.Three of us ordered a whole Bucket of Bird and added waffles, Angel biscuits, and charred green beans (to make the meal healthy). It was a ton of food and we barely finished it all.  The biscuits were very cute fluffy squares, and very buttery inside. The accompanying gravy and seasoning added a nice flavor. The chicken had a wonderfully seasoned, crispy skin and was perfectly cooked inside, very juicy. The seasoning has a lemony flavor which gives it a unique taste. It came with a honey tabasco sauce, but it was delicious even plain. Waffles were absolutely adorable, perfect little miniatures topped with cheese and a side of whisky maple syrup. The green beans were nice, but seeing the cooks pushing out little bowls of grits and mac n' cheese made me wish we'd chosen differently.Dessert was completely out of the question after all that food, otherwise I would have jumped on getting the banana cream pie.

3.0,4/6/2015,"Came specifically for Restaurant Week dinner on a weeknight. We were late to our reservation by 15 minutes and unfortunately lost our table. Nonetheless, they had seating available at the bar, this being around 7PM. Small, Southern comfort food restaurant, with tables, bar seating, and window seating at the front. Reservations seem mandatory, unless you are okay waiting a bit. I might plan to come back for regular dinner, maybe, though Restaurant Week provided a pretty decent sampling.Root & Bone's appearance is rustic, cool, low key and casual. Has a bit of a Brooklyn feel to it. Since we sat at the bar, we had limited exposure to that full dining room experience. It was still a decent, cozy area of seating. The anticipation for some good fried chicken in the city was a main reason for trying Root & Bone. That search may still have to continue. The chicken is good, but not what I can describe as memorable. The waffles, perhaps more forgettable. The favorite of dinner was the starter of Drunken Deviled Eggs. The presentation is great though overall. From the Restaurant Week menu, we ordered small plates of Drunken Deviled Eggs, Grilled Butternut Squash, a main of the Fried Chicken and Waffles (Waffles with Cheddar on top), and some dessert. The squash sounded more exciting than it actually tasted. The chicken was average. I was hoping the skin would be more flavorful and more crispy. Seasoning was nothing special. The waffles are on the sweeter side, and the cheddar was surprisingly flavorless. Maybe RW dinner is a notch or two behind in taste/refinement than regular dinner, but I would hate to speculate that.Overall, RW at Root & Bone was good but not great. I might return to give it another chance, but there is not enough reason at the moment to make the trek.

The first thing I wanted to point out was the poor and slow service which was so disappointing. Noone checked up on our table the entire hour and half we dined there; I didn't even know who our server was. I had to wave someone down for everything- when our water glass was sitting empty, when we had a question, when we were ready to put our order in, when we wanted the check (didn't even care to look at desserts because of the service). One of the server/busser brought out our bigger plates, but no one cleaned up our previous (smaller) plates so he had to drop the new plates and pick up the other ones simultaneously because we barely had space. Noone asked how the food was...I dont expect over the top service but at least acknowledge us! Anyways lets get to the food...we started with Grandma's Biscuits and the Chicken and Waffle Sandwich which were both really good. I had the Porkchops which was good as well, I loved the huge onion rings on top. My friend had the Meatloaf which she enjoyed. I would say the food was better than average, but unfortunately the main highlights were our smaller plates.

It's gotten its fair share of superlatives since it opened, and I can say with 100% certainty that it deserves all of the praise it gets.It was busy for a Friday night, but not too much so. We were told it would be a 45 minute to an hour wait for three people, and that we'd probably be seated at the ""bar"", which we were okay with. Walked around and had some cocktails, and received a text from them confirming our table was ready a little bit ahead of schedule.They have an open kitchen, and they sat us at the counter there. It was actually amazing to watch everything going on, and speaking with the chefs when they had a spare two seconds (which wasn't a lot due to how busy it was). They were super cool guys and gave us recommendations. One of them was on Top Chef New York, which was super cool. At some point, Chef Janine Booth came out to say hi to us. She was also on Top Chef, for the New Orleans season. So lots of talent in the room!We ordered the whole chicken with waffles ($42). It was a good amount of food for three people, but of course, we indulged ourselves by order sides on top of that to push us over the edge.We started with an order of biscuits. You dip it int gravy and then into a sesame/salt combo. Pillowy, buttery and very delicious, though watch out for the salt.The bucket of chicken arrived, and I was floored by how amazing it smelled. One bite into it, and you could tell they were onto something here. The chefs told us that their secret is to grill lemon chips and then add the zest into the chicken. You can definitely taste a nice tang along with the amazingly crispy skin. The meat was also incredibly juicy so it didn't really need any accompaniments. That said, the table Tabasco honey somehow made things even better. My mouth is watering just thinking about the flavor combinations.We opted for the chicken and waffle option, so the whole bird came with four mini buckwheat waffles, which were adorable and adorably tasty. They had cheddar melted on top, and there was a bottle of whiskey maple syrup on the table to pour over it. Very good, but pretty heavy.We also ordered green beans with pine nuts as a side, because after all, gotta stay healthy, right? Very respectable portions.We also watched the kitchen make a ton of other sides that made us regret not ordering them. The grits looked amazing, as did the mac and cheese.They also have a great dessert menu and small samples for sale in front.

When I called to see how long the wait was, they said 10-15 minutes. I get there shortly after and they tell me its 45-hour wait. I was so confused how within a couple of minutes the wait time changed so drastically. As I was waiting, other people came in and said they were told the same thing. Then I heard one of the staff ask the owner how long she should tell a customer on the phone how long the wait was, and he said tell them 10 minutes. AKA, they really over exaggerate.

Some awesome chicken.  This place blew away our expectations.If you are looking for a foofy place where they charge you double because the plates they serve you on are symmetrical... Look elsewhere.  If you want the best chicken in the tri state area (I went to CT once)... There is no need to look anywhere else.Before I get into our dining selection... I'll have to admit I was extremely impressed with what was probably a 'one off' CX.  To save most of you from opening another tab to Google ""CX""... That is the Customer Experience.  Flat out... Ours was a 10+.  Unless you've had the head chef come out and explain each course as it was delivered... Then you cannot give any rating a 10+.  Maybe it was because I made the reservation under my work email address and they thought I was a big deal (I'm not... I'm only big)I hope that the beautiful blonde from down under isn't harassed because of my review... But me and my colleagues were floored by her exquisite explanation of every dish delivered (and I can't lie... But her accent actually made it taste better!).Anyway... We got chicken and waffles... 2X (trust me... Order double of those).  They were my 2nd fave of the evening.  We added the mac and cheese as well as the chicken dumplings... Also tied for 2nd fave.  I remember having some other side... Can't remember exactly what it was... But it was equally my 2nd fave.And then... There was the Wholly Bird of Awesomeness.  Wow.  Holy Pluck! I can't really say much more as I would be doing a disservice by diminishing something that makes me want to drop what I'm doing and go right now.  So it would behoove you to Chick'n to the Root and Bone down on 3rd st..

The hostess offered to order us drinks but we still waited about 15-20 minutes for them. She made up for that with a free round of deviled eggs. Holy moly. I don't even like deviled eggs but I would have arm wrestled someone for another one. Delicious. When we finally sat down, I was really pleased with the ambiance. It's super cozy and you can see into the kitchen and hear the food being prepped. Our server, Lilith, was super sweet and attentive. We decided to order basically everything. Mac n Cheese-it was delicious. No idea what they crumble on top but it was perfection. Short Rib Meatloaf-I hate meatloaf but could have eaten this entire portion myself. The mashed potatoes were a great compliment to the dish. Biscuits-You can't come to a place like this and not get the biscuits. Typically two per serving so make sure you order 1 biscuit per person! Waffles-Chicken and waffles...this is how it's done. Order the waffles AND the biscuits. You know you want to. Half a bird-This serving included four pieces of chicken.

4.0,3/22/2015,I've been meaning to come here awhile ago as I bookmarked this place after watching Janine at top chef. Boo Boo surprised me with reservation here after her makeup appointment. We shared the grandma biscuit and ordered the steak and I got the fried chicken and waffles with mac and cheese. The app was small for my appetite but ti was very rich and tasty. The mac and cheese was also very rich which met our expectations. My fried chicken was very moist but not piping hot like I'm used to. I think that was a good thing so you can really taste the chicken without burning your mouth. The service was very prompt and friendly or waitress checked up on us often.The gourmet twists like the honey hot sauce and the whiskey syrup was nice touch for me. And the decor is nice. We didn't sit near the kitchen I'm glad we didn't because I think your clothes will come out smelling like fried chicken after being inside for awhile.  Don't compare this place with KFC and another soul food place.,0,0,0,Chris L.,"Paterson, NJ",129,1146,1095

The skin was nice and crispy. The mac and cheese and deviled egg was mediocre. I was disappointed with the romaine salad. While the presentation was really pretty the portion of the salad was extremely small and I didn't enjoy how it tasted.

3.0,3/21/2015,"3.5 stars: I'm no expert at fried chicken and Southern cuisine spots around the city, but this place is doing something right with its sweet tea-brined fried chicken. Drool, enough said. Ordered a Half Bird which came with 4 pieces and split it with the Wifey. Get every piece of meat off those bones because this chicken sure is tasty (and pricey). Pro Tip: Shower the fried chicken in the Tabasco honey!--Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuit - I could probably eat this at every meal. All day, everyday. BUT why such a small biscuit though?? It tastes great with the seasonings, but the price isn't exactly proportional.-- Crispy Loaded Potato - It's like a giant bowl of a potato twist with cheese, sour cream and chunky bacon loaded all over it. Simple concept really. Probably passable unless you're craving simplicity.- Mac and Cheese - That thyme crust though. I've only wish it had the crunchy texture throughout the entire dish, otherwise at the bottom are just mushy cheese and pasta.Overall I'd come back for the chicken. The other side dishes that night were elevated versions of your classics. Worth the prices? Debatable, but the menu options sure make you want to try all their items.

5.0,3/20/2015,"This is a gem in Alphabet City, and a spot I would keep on coming back to. It's a very charming place.Great decor and great service. This time we tried the 2 chicken and waffle appetizers. They were great.Fried chicken with cheddar melted on top. They were served on a mini waffle and with maple whiskey syrup. They came with a green tomato and pickles. They came served with a delicious salad of watercress, pickled onions, pickled red peppers, and okra. Unfortunately, our order was not served piping hot which would have made a huge difference; they were just served at a warm temperature, not hot. We also got a side of Mac and cheese, which was served piping hot. It was gooey, but not too gooey. Cheesy, but not too cheesy. Basically it felt like a perfect Mac n cheese, the kind you grew up eating. I hate Mac and cheese dishes that are too cheesy or fancy. We ordered the carrot cake for desert, which was perfect. One of the best carrot cakes I have ever had! Cake was super moist, and the cream cheese frosting was perfect. They came served with these delicious carrot chips. I would go back here just to grab that carrot cake. As for drinks, I got the green acre and Ri got something with tequila, habanero bitters, and ginger. They both were solid! Also of note, last time I was here I got the crispy loaded potato. It too was delicious, and something I would definitely order again. A must go!

4.0,3/15/2015,"The one serious complaint I have is that their biscuits are over-priced and undersized.   I wanted to give you a 3.5 stars but you can't do halves and the food was really good hence the 4 stars. I actually felt a little offended because they call themselves a southern restaurant but the size of each biscuit was approximately 1.25"" square, you get two on a plate with some chicken jus for $7.00. No southerner would serve a biscuit that small and not call it a ""biscuit bite"" which is what yours should be called. If I ordered chicken and biscuits and those showed up I'd be furious. For their size they should cost $2.50 and be named accordingly. It was otherwise a great meal.The food was well prepared and very tasty. We had the chicken basket (1/2) with savory waffles and spiked syrup. The cocktail was refreshing and imaginative, and with a name like Smash & Grab it held up.

3.0,3/13/2015,"Root & Bone had been on my Yelp bookmarked list for a few months now, and I finally mustered the time to try it out. It's a very small location within the fringes of Alphabet City, so expect it to be packed for dinnertime (45 min. - 1 hour waits for 2 people aren't unusual). After entering, you immediately stare into the open kitchen and get to see all the stages of preparation for the fried chicken you're about to eat (don't tell me you came to R&B for the salads...). The hostess was friendly and efficient, which is indispensable at a restaurant as busy as this. My cousin and I were seated by the window counter, offering a good view of the street scene and a front row seat of all the jealous spectators and people waiting in line. R&B runs an efficient operation, and our bucket of a half fried chicken arrived promptly after ordering; our crispy potato skins followed shortly after.The reason I give R&B just 3 stars boils down to the wait/hype to food quality ratio. You can tell R&B brines their chicken, as it's very juicy. However, it didn't have the flavor profile or the crispiness I expect from fried chicken. Granted, fried chicken comes in different forms for different folk, but to me, it's not the type of chicken I'm willing to wait for and sit in a small place for. I prefer chicken flavored with salt and pepper, or that has a spicy kick. R&B's fried chicken is much more plain, and the skin isn't as breaded as I like. The crispy potato skins come fully loaded with buttermilk sauce, crispy bacon (more like pork belly, with different layers of flavor and texture), and kept the main dish in good company. When judging a restaurant, meal quality doesn't exist in a vacuum and I always consider other factors, such as price, waiting times, and overall restaurant environment. Based on my experience, would I come back to Root & Bone as is? Most likely not. I simply don't have the time or patience to wait that long for just fried chicken. But if this restaurant existed in a market with less competition, I'd be more willing.",1,1,1,Alejandro B.,"Arlington, VA",345,387,18

And if the restaurant has over brewed the tea,  or not used boiling water, well, bless her heart.Thankfully, R&B has excellent Sweet Iced Tea. That alone would entice me to return!In terms of food, the R&B kitchen is turning out delicious Southern favorites. My friend and I went for RW - Winter 2015, and really enjoyed the meal!I ordered the grilled salad, which is my new favorite way to eat lettuce! Very rustic plating. The roasted tomatoes and fried hominy were a nice touch.The chicken and waffles are divine. They melt cheddar cheese on the airy mini waffles and then toss on scallions and sea salt. And the fried chicken is an enormous portion! I tried to get the recipe (no chance), but according to the website, it's brined in sweet tea and dusted with lemon zest. Mmm, mmm. For dessert, I ordered the Banana Pudding. It was the only dish about which I felt ""so-so"". But, then again, I'm picky when it comes to Southern food. I like Banana Pudding to be electric yellow and really pudding-y with slices of banana and airy whipped cream folded in. Like what you get at a church picnic or family reunion.

The atmosphere is perfect for meeting old friends, or bringing someone special for a modern tweak on homey ""soul-food.""Even at odd hours though, you need a reservation or you'll be waiting anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours. The food was on point-Simply put, just get the fried chicken, waffles, and Mac and cheese and I guarantee you'll love it. The potatoes weren't anything special; it was hanging on the verge of undercooked, and the biscuits weren't amazing either; just different, but not worth it. So why am I hesitating to give it five stars? The service. The staff and service really make up a huge part of a dining experience but there was definitely racial micro-aggression. I went with three other old high school (Asian) friends, and the staff, and majority of the customers are white, some of them dressed very well. Arranging our seating took much longer than it should have and her attitude was condescending. She moved us to the bar, so I was putting my stuff down at the bar while my friends where picking up theirs and walking over when another waitress stares at me for 10 seconds before she tilts her head and says, ""Can I help you?"" again in a demeaning tone, as if I were a child caught doing something wrong. Not once throughout the hour we were there did a waiter/waitress check up on us.The food and atmosphere is definitely a reason to come back but the staff needs a lecture on micro-aggression and how to be more professional.

Veers from a traditional southern chicken biscuit with the addition of a pepper jelly and a pickle, but thats what I'm here for! If I wanted traditional southern food, I sure as hell wouldn't be paying these prices for it. Shrimp and grits were fantastic, with a tasty au jus and bacon. I could eat grits ALL day (southern girl here) and these were no different. The shrimp on it was just okay but the flavors of the au jus and grits were perfect. The portion was nice too. What I really loved about this place is the atmosphere. The natural light in the place is unreal, and they've decorated it to be rustic and humble, but still modern. Mismatched grandma plates add to that southern feel. I'll be back, for sure. You can get these big baskets of fried chicken, which definitely seems like a good deal too.

Although the Farro had nicely textured mushrooms and a good mouth feel overall, the dish lacked that rich ""porcini"" flavor that I was looking for.Dessert:Banana Cream Pie - good, as expectedSticky Toffee Pudding with Whiskey Foam and Stout Ice Cream - the pudding and its toffee sauce was addicting, but I felt the Stout Ice Cream was mismatched, but creative because of its somewhat bitter nature.Although our server was friendly and helpful, he was inattentive and we ended up with another server by the end of dinner and weren't told. Who do we ask for more water? Who do we tell that we are ready for dessert?

3.0,3/5/2015,"Went here to clear the mixed reviews I have heard from people. My verdict was yes, it rings true that their chicken really wasn't great at all.At first, we were thinking about doing RW or ordering off the regular menu. We ended up just ordering to share and it turned out well that way. We got a bucket of chicken, side of waffles, chicken and waffle sandwiches, deviled eggs, chicken and dumplings, shrimp and grits and drinks. Do not order the chicken and waffle sandwiches. I felt bad that I even decided to split this with my friend. It was the most disappointing dish out of the ones we ordered. Very dry and no way was it dark meat as the waitress said. The odd thing I liked the most about that dish was the pickled okra. Slightly sweet and crunchy! If you really want chicken and waffles, it's best ordered separately. When I tried some of the thigh, it was particularly good, but when I tried some of the chicken breast, it just cancelled everything out. It didn't taste special at all. Waffles were fine and weren't dense. There are so many better places for this!!! Deviled eggs were slightly tart and fine to me. Hit and miss with some at our table. The chicken and dumplings came out and I wasn't fond of them. They were pretty soggy and mushy. Friend liked it more than I did. The dish that made me wonder about giving this place a 3 or 4 was the shrimp and grits. I would have given this place a 4 for that dish alone. Usually, I don't like grits because of its grainy texture, but the flavors and texture of these grits were honestly, the best I have had. Buttery and flavorful grits along with the shrimp...it's just...perfect.All I can probably hear now is some of my friends telling me, ""I told you so!""

Can't imagine this being actual size for any regular day. Entree: fried chicken and waffles. This was hyped up due to a recent top 10 fried chicken list and let's just say I was SUPER disappointed. Fried chicken is one of my favorite dishes and this was a let down. The breading was almost burned and had a bitter after taste. The breast was half moist but half dry. The waffles were so so. The chicken was lacking in salt. Overall wasn't well made and I couldn't finish it. In fact, I thought about going to another chicken restaurant for better chicken. Dessert: sticky toffee bread and banana pudding were both very tasty. Toffee a little sweet but the stout ice cream mellowed it so the dessert was nicely balanced. Overall I don't think the restaurant was worth the price. There were highs and lows making this a 3-star restaurant in my opinion.",0,0,0,April T.,"Bayonne, NJ",101,74,49
5.0,3/5/2015,this is fried chicken deliciousness at its best. i have been angling to come here for sometime now and finally made it for an early lunch before the crowds got going. it is tough to snag a reservation here but they do save some seats for walk ins so you've got a shot. however as i was leaving i heard them tell a couple that it would be a 1.5 hour wait for a table which is pretty painful. to the food. the biscuits are amazing. the pork that comes in them was darn tasty too. and then the fried chicken - some of the best i've had. i went white meat for my 2 pieces and was stuffed by the end. it has this great lemon / herb flavor to it and i also liked added some of the hot sauce here and there. have to say the cheddar waffles didnt wow me - they look good and the idea of whiskey syrup is up my alley but i would trade those in for another biscuit in a heartbeat. also coffee and dessert werent all that stellar. the coffee was a bit weak and had a burnt taste to it and my sticky toffee pudding was luke warm at best. but i guess what i am saying is that none of this matters - get the fried chicken and some biscuits and you will be a happy camper!,1,1,1,Christina H.,"Manhattan, NY",54,533,110
5.0,3/5/2015,"Root & Bone takes comfort food and cooks it using the best possible techniques and ingredients.  The fried chicken and waffles are a true standout - especially with the addition of the Honey Tabasco sauce.  I also highly recommend the chicken biscuit, as well as the artfully made deviled eggs.  I also love how so much of the food here has a boozy component (drunken deviled eggs, whisky foam, stout ice cream).",0,0,0,Benjamin P.,"Manhattan, NY",160,37,62
2.0,3/4/2015,"This review is based on a take-out perspective. It was a snowy day and I made my way out here to get their chicken and waffles and mac and cheese. The food was good, not amazing. I think Amy's Ruth in Harlem has better chicken and waffles. What baffled me about this place is the price paid for the amount of food. It was $15 for two small pieces of chicken and waffles. Clearly, not fulfilling. The service provided at the check-out was not good either. I was forced to sign my credit card bill with a highlighter and was given a look when I asked for a plastic bag.

3.0,3/3/2015,"Good food, but prices and portions leave something to be desired.Have been 2x now. Most recently, went for brunch and despite having a 1030am reservation (aka, immediately when they open), it took a good 20 minutes to get seated. I also found it strange that walk-ins were seated at the same time as people with reservations. What's the point of making a reservation and showing up right when the restaurant opens if I have to wait to be seated? It's not like there's room to walk to the front of the line to announce yourself anyway. Anyway, the place is cute, but WAY too crowded. There's barely any elbow room which makes private conversations difficult and just gives off the vibe of being a ""scene"" more than just a place to eat good food. The fried chicken is definitely good, and I genuinely recommend it...but as someone who's spent a half decade in the south, it's not worth the hype it has gotten. It's very good by NY standards (definitely top 10 in the city, maybe even top 5), but a 1/2 bird w/waffles is $25. That's a little steep for brunch (esp. four 4 pieces of chicken and 4 small waffles) when you need to give at least an additional app (we got the brisket sandwiches) and side (mac n cheese) to be full. That pushes the cost of brunch close to $50 even before drinks/tip. Speaking of which, drinks were, I think, $13 or so and frankly, were pretty mediocre. At that price I could get great cocktails at some of the best spots in the city -- not so-so drinks that feel like they're an afterthought rather than a complement to the meal.

3.0,3/2/2015,"Knowing the popularity of this place, decided to come here as soon as it opened in the morning to guarantee myself a spot (if you can manage getting a reservation, kudos to you).Brunch: $15 waffle chicken sandwich, $8 Mac 'n cheese.  The chicken and waffles comes out as two small waffles with a chicken filet, melted cheese, and pickle on top. Some of the other pictures showed them as completed sandwiches, but now it's open faced (skimping?). The chicken was moist and the waffles are made fresh, very tasty, but the ""salad"" it comes with is simply a garnish. Luckily I ordered the mac and cheese, which was breaded nicely on top and flavorful on the inside (could use some hot sauce).The food here is good, but price-wise on the expensive side ($10 for a beer?!).

4.0,3/1/2015,"I took a couple of friends here because of a recommendation. Being that it was also Restaurant Week I figured hey, perfect time to try it! We didn't have a reservation so the wait was about an hour which was fine with us because it allowed us time to grab a drink or two. I did enjoy their wait system as they took down out name and phone number and gave us a text to let us know to start heading towards the restaurant, then they called when our table was ready. Once seated, the ambience was wonderful, great soul music, and the smell of southern cooking just permeated the air. I loved the fact that you can see directly into the kitchen and I saw both owners working their magic! Before ordering the good, we saw that there was a special wine pairing offered! A white to start and a red to finish it he meal. The first course I had was the angel biscuits which were divine! Then I moved on to the award winning chicken and waffles. I can definitely see why it's award winning! It came with a maple syrup and a honey Tabasco sauce, so yummy! I ended the meal with the banana pudding. Now I will say, that dish was a little disappointing but I'm also biased because I'm a die hard fan of the banana pudding at Magnolia Bakery.The restaurant was really crowded and the hostess didn't allow us time to sit and relax after our meal to enjoy conversation. It seemed like a ""eat and keep it moving"" environment. This place is also extremely tiny. I would love to see them expand. There's only one bathroom and the line can get pretty cumbersome.Overall, the meal was delightful! Absolutely delicious and I'm just dreaming about that chicken and waffles.

4.0,2/28/2015,"Their award winning fried chicken dish is on the Restaurant Week's brunch/lunch menu! I REPEAT, THEIR AWARD WINNING FRIED CHICKEN DISH IS ON RW'S MENU!! This place has always been on my bookmarks for quite some time now, and what better time to try it out than during restaurant week? I was so excited to see that Root & Bone was on the listing, let alone that some of their specialty dishes are on there.Let's jump straight to our great meal! :BBQ Brisket Biscuit appetizer - the brisket itself was just A-OK. It was shredded and tasted a tad too vinegary for me... Not how I prefer my brisket at all, but the biscuit itself was great. Delicate with a sweet glazed outside to it. Since the biscuit is great, the chicken biscuit should be the better choice since their fried chicken is awesome.Deviled Eggs - Yummyy! Do get these! Pink little eggs with fantastic yolk mixture and some salty chips to add the crunchy texture. Hah kinda reminded me of those addicting salt&vinegar chips in taste wise with the dish overall. Fried Chicken & Waffles - LOVE!! I kept picking off my boyfriend's plate no matter how full I was and stuffing my face with no shame to this dish like a true fat girl's moment. This is definitely one of the better chicken&waffle dishes that I've had. Better than Sweet Chicks and Pies&Thighs. Perhaps I might even like it more than SoCo's, but Carrie and my bf likes them both equally. The two pieces of dark meat chicken were really fat, plump, and insanely juicy. A nice crispy skin with a balance of salty and zest from either the brining process with sweet tea or the lemon dust. The waffles were fluffy and the whiskey syrup is heaven ! Everything on this dish worked out such various delicious flavors of together.Waffle Benedict - ugh perfectly poached eggs on those beautiful sweet waffles again with a delicious hollandaise sauce and their housemade thick-cut bacon. The bacon wasn't too crispy or dry at all, it was actually fantastic. Another great dish I really enjoyed.Mac&cheese - al dente shells with a baby kick to their cheese sauce. Good, but not the best.RW Wine Pairing - $15 for two glasses of wine, a red and white. Very worth it and I usually don't like wine but these were enjoyable. I also dig their cocktail menu, the kill devil hill and applejack smash was both interesting and good. I'm usually very picky and hard to please with cocktails.The fixtures are bright, beautiful and vintage-ish on white brick walls (I always have a thing for decor so you know I gotta point out a beautiful one when I see one) Much different from all the other southern comfort cuisines in New York, It's a more homey feel here. IF YOU HAVEN'T TRIED ROOT & BONE YET I HIGHLY SUGGEST TO HURRY AND GO DO SO TO TAKE ADVANTAGE DURING RESTAURANT WEEK! Brunch is Fri-Sun only for $25, dinner is Mon-Fri $38 for restaurant week.

4.0,2/27/2015,"I really enjoyed my experience here, but if you like a quiet peaceful dinner this place isn't for you. It's relatively cramped so the servers might bump into you, and there is no real room in the front waiting area. It's pretty chaotic until your can focus on your delicious food. it does have an authentic southern feel to it (for me at least), it's made to look a little like you childhood lunchroom/classroom. The tables are simple and wooden and the chairs are reminiscent of elementary school desks. The plates are also a mishmashed collection that look like they might have come from a yard sale or a grandparents house. Some people might think the restaurant is trying to hard, but I found it quaint. I really enjoyed the food. A lot of places claim to have the best friend chicken and I'm usually let down, but this really was good and I enjoyed it. It's not the best I've ever had, but it's definitely one of better ones in the city. The waffles are great too, soft and tasty, and the syrup with the hot sauce makes their chicken and waffles a winning combo. The steak I had was tasty, but standard. The risotto, on the other hand, with fricking delicious. I loved and I want more and I'm sad it's not in front of me.

5.0,2/26/2015,"Proud to say that I have lived in the South (yes, below the Mason Dixon line, North Carolina) for 4 years of my life. So, I mean it when I say this is some good fried chicken. I ordered off the regular menu and the Restaurant Week Winter 2015 menu.Regular menu - half a fried chicken in a basket: The chicken, somehow, is ridiculously moist and tender underneath a crispy thin skin. The chicken definitely has a unique taste as well, some sharp notes of salt calmed by sweet tanginess. Definitely not your run of the mill fried chicken joint. Restaurant Week items: First course - BBQ brisket - large spoonfuls of bbq brisket on puffy pastry-like bread. It was a great twist on a classic. I liked both the bread and brisket, but I think the bread was more memorable than the brisket. Second Course - Shrimp & Grits - nice large pieces of shrimp with hunks of bacon. It was yummy for the first part of the meal, but there was a little too much sauce for my liking. I would rather have less salt and sauce on my grits. NC wins this round. Dessert - Sticky Toffee Pudding - definitely a unique dessert and this sugar rush will keep you going for the day and then some. The whiskey foam was very unique and was true to its name. I would recommend this if you have never tried it before. Overall, I would definitely come back for the fried chicken, and it is a great find for Restaurant Week.",1,1,1,Stacy T.,"New York, NY",200,324,213

But if we are talking just the taste of the food. It's mediocre at best and overpriced. The biscuits here were something like $7 for essentially 2 tiny balls that apparently were biscuits but they put all this other unnecessary flair on the plate to make it seem worth it. Don't bother getting them. I got the chicken and waffle sandwiches. The portion was ok but the combination fell flat on its face. The chicken was ok, the pickled tomato didn't compliment what the sandwich was going for and the layer of cheese was a sad excuse to add another layer of taste.

I'm sure this place set the bar pretty high for my first time.We shared a full bucket of bird, and 2 orders of mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was on point, and it went fast.Now, I'm a real fried chicken enthusiast, and everything I've read about this place is that it has the best fried chicken in the city. With reviews like that my expectations were pretty high. Needless to say, it was above and beyond. The flavor was delicious, I loved the touch of lemon and honey. the skin was crispy with perfect flavor and the inside was juicy. I ate 3 pieces, and took whatever leftovers I had home, they were even good the next day.The decor and ambience were really cool. I loved the bones all over the spot, and the fact that it had a real down south feeling inside.I can not wait to come back. Definitely make reservations if you can. It's a tiny spot, and if you can't make a reservation, stick around and wait it out. It was worth it!",1,1,1,Cory C.,"Los Angeles, CA",223,112,46
1.0,2/11/2015,Ate here on Saturday 2/7/15 and was sick within an hour after leaving.

But I wasn't watching closely enough to see how/if he covered the sneeze. Evidently he did not cover it well.,2,0,0,Deidre P.,"KEW GARDENS, NY",14,16,0

2.0,2/8/2015,"Ate: Fried Chicken, mac and cheeseDrank: Smash and Grab, waterLiked: The mac and cheese was probably the highlight, but not worth coming back just for that.Disliked: The 2 hour wait.  Hostess told us table would be ready soon after an hour, so we actually stood around for the second hour.  Not happy campers after that.Chicken: Yes, people seem to love the fried chicken, but mine came with soggy skin and wasn't super flavorful.  Maybe that's some new trend that I'm not aware of?Would mom like it?: Mom is a patient person but she wouldn't have put up with the ridiculous wait.Would I go back: Never.  The hostess told us it would be about an hour wait, but ended up being over 2 hours.  We were a party of 4 and what was disappointing was seeing multiple tables of 2 get seated before us even though we got there first.  They really should have held two tables of 2 for us.Recommend: We went to Sigmund's across the street for the first hour of waiting and even though they didn't have as big a menu there, it was a much better experience, ambiance, food and service.  We should have just stayed there instead of standing in the cramped doorway for an hour.",1,0,0,Michael L.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,161,7
3.0,2/8/2015,"The first time I try to go to Root & Bone we did not have a reservation. The wait at 6:30 PM was said to be two and a half hours. Put our names down and wandered around for a while deciding to have dinner at a Thai restaurant close by. After dinner we went home and watched a movie and at about 11 PM I got a call saying that a table was ready if we wanted it!!!The second time we had a reservation which went a lot more smoothly. We were seated immediately and the serious business began. We had the devilled eggs, fried chicken, shrimp and grits and the root and ricotta sandwich and to be honest it was all good but not great. Perhaps I'd heard too much hype and so had much higher expectations.The fried chicken was crisp not oily and the chilli maple syrup accompanying it was delicious. But the breast portion was quite dry and it lacked depth of flavour.  My benchmark is still Charles Panfried Chicken in Harlem. The desserts, a passionfruit tart and chocolate bar well perhaps the highlight of the meal.Bottom line - good food but not worth the wait.",2,3,0,Dan T.,"PECK SLIP, NY",13,63,130

We thought maybe it was because we were so close to the kitchen, but my friend at work is a chef and actually went there and told me the same exact thing about their coats smelling. He said he noticed that they didn't have an extractor fan over where they fry the chicken and that's probably why.

3.0,2/5/2015,"Stopped in for Sunday brunch (Super bowl weekend 2015) This place is cute, kinda of in a kitchen set up ambiance. Definitely make reservations if you intend to dine on a Sunday for Brunch. As my girlfriends and I waited they gave free samples of their apple cider, which was delish! too bad its only a sample and you cant order it with your meal, but any who, I ordered the shrimp and grits. It was so-so, the grits was kinda too grainy (if that makes sense) and the sauce they used for the Shrimp was more of just browning sauce versing an actually creole sauce or something taste. I also order mac and chesse and again it was eh, meh, so-so. Seems like they used velveeta cheese and kraft singles cheese on top, again it was so-so nothing to be excited about and eager to return. My friend enjoyed her chicken and waffle but again Im not sure how you can mess that up but then again shrimp grits is easy also. The Biscuit on the other hand were very tasty and I would just go back to order take out for the buscuits. They were small but moist with a little sweet glazed on the top.

For dessert, I had the banana cream pie, which was super-good. I don't recall the name of my girlfriend's dessert - some sort of chocolate mousse cake - which she enjoyed very much. The service is excellent at this place; really attentive. The only drawback to this place are the seats. These are ass-killers! I feel they got these seats from a fire sale at a Catholic school, and the reason behind them is that you'll be enjoying the food and ambiance so much that after 90 minutes your ass is in so much pain that you've got to get the hell out (can't have people hanging out there all night, because there are people waiting in 10 below zero weather for an hour outside just to get in!)

You can always just go to a bar on avenue B or stop by waffle and dinges for a cup of hot cocoa in this weather. Once we got seated I already knew what I wanted. Of course I wanted to try everything and I proceeded to order way too much food for two girls. We had the biscuits, the chicken and waffle sandwiches, the fried chicken, the waffle fries and another side of waffles. The biscuit was delicious, each order comes with four pieces and a side of dipping jus...MAKE SURE TO USE IT! The biscuit was already flavorful and fluffy but with the jus it was even better. The waffle sandwich was a bit messy to eat, honestly if you're ordering the basket of chicken with waffles you don't have to get the sandwich cause it's the same thing. The chicken was nice and crispy, since I always had a sweet tooth I loved it because the flavor was on the sweet side. But my friend said the flavor was a tad too sweet for her (hence why it's 4 stars). But everything we ordered was a bit on the sweeter side.

There's no bar in the restaurant to sit at, so my friend and I went to a bar across the street and received a text when our table was ready, so a super easy wait.This is the kind of place that you definitely want to get a few different items and share, at least that's what you want to do if you go there for dinner. We ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich appetizer, mac and cheese, the carrot salad and banana cream pie (which was much more like a banana pudding than a pie).The chicken was GREAT!  I mean it's pretty clear why they're known for their fried chicken. Paired with the waffles, a green tomato and this KILLER whisky syrup, it was a great combination.So I've been craving mac and cheese for several days so I was super excited to have it at a Southern restaurant. This was, by far, the most disappointing dish we had. It was good, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't really that cheesy in the sense that there wasn't a real ""cheese sauce,"" and the noodles were almost TOO al dente. The best part of this was the biscuit breadcrumbs, now those I could've eaten with a spoon.For a place that isn't known for their ""health"" food the carrot salad was awesome! It had wheatberries, a ricotta with lemon, and grilled carrots. It was great and refreshing, especially when you're eating all that heavier food.The banana ""cream pie,"" I use that term loosely, was really good, I especially like the hazelnut crunch/crust. Honestly the most disappointing part of our meal was the service, our waiter was attentive, don't get me wrong, but just kind of rude to us. He was judging what we ordered, saying that we didn't order enough food even though we were totally full, and was also just not helpful with the menu.

It's a small place but surprisingly not a suffocating space despite being seated at the tiny bar (that seats 4).  It's best for dinner for two, and four people max.For two people, we ordered half chicken (four pieces for $18), the angel biscuits (one per person $7), and roots ($10). We each had our own cocktail ($13). It was the perfect amount for us.I enjoyed everything very much, although the chicken was slightly underseasoned on the inside. However, to make up for it, the chicken (even the breast) was moist throughout, and the skin was thin, crispy, and well battered. I wasn't crazy about the honey-tabasco sauce but I did feel that each bite would be better with a supplemental sauce of some sort. Maybe just not that one.The roots were an okay complement to the chicken, but I did wish it had more of a zing to it, otherwise it would have been amazing. Just by itself, it was just decent, but I still liked the simplicity of it.The biscuits were really good. Especially the inside. And dipping it in that sauce is delish. Two things about the biscuits:1. I think for $7, maybe we could get an extra biscuit! So over-priced2. I hate to bring up another restaurant in a review...but I've had one biscuit better than this one (at Bob White). That said, I still find this to be quite a handsome biscuitI liked my cocktail.

The cocktail list seemed pretty interesting, so I'd give those a shot while you're spending so much already on food anyway.It sounds like I didn't have that pleasant of an experience but I actually enjoyed it very much.

My boyfriend had chicken & waffles a long time ago somewhere else and he didn't enjoy it but he wanted to try it again here. First of all, I really liked the decorative floral plates. It somehow adds to the homely vibe of the restaurant and it was a nice change from the regular white plates that most restaurants use. My boyfriend really enjoyed his fried chicken & waffles, which I was pleasantly surprised with because it's not something he would normally order/like. I tried some of his chicken & waffles and I have to agree, it's really good. The waffle has a little bit of sweetness to it which is perfect because it's not too sweet that it overwhelms the savoryness of the fried chicken. It was a perfect combination. My waffles benedict was also really good. The salad on the side was dressed in what I assume is freshly squeezed orange. I've never tried anything like that before (dressing wise) and it was really good. I felt that the mac & cheese could be better.

Let me start my review by saying that this place is definitely worth checking out if you love fried chicken and waffles. The décor in this place gave me a rustic heartwarming feeling like I just came home and it was just in time for lunch.I had the Angel Biscuit which is a must as they come with a side of chicken au jus, sea salt, and sesame seeds. The biscuit was flaky and it felt like I actually went to heaven for a few seconds. The plate was delivered by the chef, whom explained that it was his grandma's recipe. I like that he personally brought it out and explain a small story behind it.Half bird with 4 buckwheat waffles was a experience I would definitely go back for. The crispy skin along with the moist chicken had me at UMAMI for awhile. Every single ingredient came through with a little house made tabasco jam and I could eat 20 pieces of fried chicken. The waffles were delicious and complements the chicken fairly well. They were light and fluffy with a little bit of maple honey syrup drizzle over the chicken and waffles.Mac-n-Cheese, Where do I start with this creamy concoction...um order it and devour slowly because I don't remember where it went after I started eating it. The mac-n-cheese is creamy and with a little bit of the breadcrumb that became crispy on top is like icing on a cake. This did not take long for me to devour as I was shoveling like a monster lmao.Root & Bone has left me with a everlasting impression so I plan to go back as soon as I can.

5.0,1/11/2015,"Root and BoneNY Manhattan East Village7pm or 8pm Friday 10th January 20155 StarsI arrived at 7pm and there was a 45 minute wait. We sat on a bench outside until it became too cold. We warned ourselves with coffee. They were running behind. However after an hour and change we were seated at the street facing window bar. The place is sexy. The Einstein filament lights, steel, white walls, and different plates. My lovely date ordered the Marquee cocktail which contained gin, watermelon, lemon, and served in absinthe rinsed flute with a lemon peel. The drink was tasty but there wasn't too much watermelon flavor. I had the Cabernet. We started with the Chicken and Waffle Sandwiches ($15). It was open face so it seemed more like a normal chicken n waffles. Both components could have been crunchier. It had a balance of sweet and savory. There was a nice acid with pickled green tomato. The mixed greens with pickled red onion were okay. It was a good dish to share with another. The Root vegetables ($10) sounded good but it was fairly boring. There were plenty of carrots, some Pickled grapes which tasted like raisins, and a few potato chips. The carrot top pesto was weird-ish but not bad. The daily special Pork Chop ($28) was excellent. The pork was brined and grilled. The meat was almost rare but tender and juicy. There were two bones to split and enjoy. The Polenta was creamy with plenty of cracked pepper. The spinach was fine. The fried egg was cooked a perfect medium. The apple jam added a traditional sweet note to the pork. The service was slow but not inattentive. The pricing wasn't bad.

Flaky, soft, piping hot goodness. The texture is unreal. It comes with thyme and this seed/sea salt that goes perfectly with the gravy. Whole bird with 4 buckwheat waffles: The 24hour sweet tea brine really shines through in this dish. The perfectly crispy fried exterior with the extremely juicy and flavorful chicken was just so comforting. The buckwheat waffles were amazing as well. So soft and a little bit cheesy with that amazing buckwheat flavor.... goes so well with the chicken. Loved drizzling everything with the tabasco honey to give it that one last kickSides: also all really good, the collard greens being my favorite.

The amount of love they put into every single morsel of a chicken is unreal. The chicken is tender and good all the way up to the bone. They pressure fry the chicken, which explains the above average price. However, when chicken is that good you know where those extra few dollars went. The chicken was served with honey tabasco.I also ordered the half portion of meatloaf because I had no choice after the waitress said it was in the oven for over 12hrs on 250 degrees. They wait for the braised meat to fall apart and then they just put it back into square form as best as possible.

They're soft, come topped with a crispy sugar layer and ready for dipping into a chicken jous (sweeter rather than saltier) and salt. The fried chicken was very good -- won't blow your mind, but the lemon powder they dash on the crispy skin was a stroke of genius.

I had gone there with my friend on Monday night around 6:30pm and it was crowded but there were a few seats open by the window and near the kitchen. We opted for seats in front of the kitchen and the chef. Immediately when we sat down, there were two chefs who were both so sweet and nice and they made us feel very welcomed as if we were eating dinner at a friend's house.We ordered the whole fried chicken with waffles (it comes with cheese on top) and the collard greens with pumpkin purée and it was delicious. The best part was watching it being cooked in front of us and it made the experience so great. As a complimentary appetizer, the chef gave us deviled eggs to try which were amazing! And later as we were almost finished eating, the chef later gave us mac and cheese as well!! It goes to show just how sweet and kind the staff at this cute restaurant really is and how homey and comfortable they make you feel.I would definitely come back again and try more of the menu because everything they were cooking looked so yummy and beautifully plated.

In my infinite wisdom I didn't see what time that place opened...which was 5pm...not 1pm when we were there. womp womp...Well Yelp to the rescue. This came up at the top with 4 stars. And well, we were standing right next to it.Anyway, it's a southern joint in the East Village so it's not really ""southern"" inside, it's more East Village inside. The waitress was excellent, and asked if we'd been there and explained the menu. It's small almost tapas style but with the option for a full plate on many of the menu items. We opted to split and try multiple things. We got the chicken and waffles, brisket meatloaf and just regular biscuits. All were absolutely excellent! The biscuits, while not amazing were very good and the sauce that comes with them was great. I think these could be lowered in price a buck or 2 though. The brisket meatloaf was not like we expected (which is good), it isn't a heavy ""loaf"" it is pulled brisket and it was great, could have been a bit warmer but still great! The chicken inside the chicken and waffles...wow. just wow. I will go back to get just the fried chicken, it was outstanding!!!! And they give you maple syrup.The drinks were good, we only got one each because we weren't in the drinking mood or spending lots of money mood. But, they were very good and had a punch.

A must have for the appetizer.For the entree we orderd the 8 piece fried chicken bucket with a side of waffles. By far the best fried chicken I have had so far in NYC. The chicken is marinated in a homemade brine for a day and then sprinkled with lemon powder and It had the right amount of crispyness.It goes well with their homemade bourbon and spicy honey sauce. Sprinkle it over your chicken and dig into it.

Everything was delicious, only thing I would comment on is the salt content in the food. I drank through 4.5 big glasses of water, I'm 100% the food would taste just as good - if not better - if they cut back on the salt.

1.0,1/2/2015,"So, like everyone else who comes here, I was suckered in by ny.eater's review of the purportedly amazing fried chicken at root and bone. Nicholas, our server, told us that they were voted to have the best fried chicken in New York (by whom was not mentioned). When we sat down I checked to see if my fav Pete Wells reviewed Bone in NYT. Apparently he hadn't (Wells don't got time for this Alphabet City ""best fried chicken in town"" nonsense) so I was left with a review in Bloomberg. It turned out that all of this reviewer's favorite items were off the menu. Three other menu items were off the menu too because they ""ran out"" by 10pm when we sat down (when normal people sit down for dinner in NYC). I suggested they reverse run out of items by keeping some items off the menu until reasonable time (like 8). Nicholas wasn't amused. Fried chicken was underwhelming. Grits and deviled eggs were good, and root vegetables had nice acid.Bur let's be real this place is genuinely terrible; terrible like how your San Francisco friends tell you they could never live in NYC because it's too busy, of course, only after having visited midtown just under Central Park; after walking through Greenwich village to get to brunch they report its starting to grow on them. I asked Nicholas about his experience working at Bone, saying the place reminded me of Georges' ABC kitchen (not in a good way - the place feels like it's trying to be Alphabet City low key chic but it is trying SO HARD). Customers are hustling hard too -- everyone is having their ""special nite (no not night) out in amazing nyc"" at this cool place far from the subway that the read about in a food blog - ""don't worry, Avenue B these days is totally safe."" Because really, let's be real -- $35 chicken is obviously NOT low key. The place feels disingenuous -- trying hard to be chill low key but making probably $30 margins on its most frequently pushed (but so highly rated!) menu item. I couldn't take it seriously.

5.0,12/28/2014,"I must have been pining to try this place for at least two months now--countless Saturdays have passed by where I would wake up, head to this restaurant in the early afternoon and find myself stuck with a 45min-1hr30min wait. Since I'm not keen on waiting that long (usually), I found myself skipping over this place until I finally had the opportunity to try it recently for brunch.So, to start-- Root & Bone is well decorated on the outside and stands out amongst the other venues on the block. Strolling inside, you'll find the environment feels like you're inside a very small cottage home which helps add to that Southern / countryside feeling. The seating is very close together and it's tight inside. Like many other restaurants in the city, expect to be rubbing elbows with dining parties nearby.Excited to make the most of my trip here, me and my friend decided to try the following options on the menu:Iced Tea -- So good! I'm a sucker for sweet tea... this does NOT miss the mark at all! I had to have three glasses of it because I was so addicted. Grandma's Daisy Angel Biscuits - If you come here and do not get these, you pretty much ruined the experience. This is one of *the* mandatory items here, in my opinion... their biscuits are PHENOMENAL. Bucket of Bird -- well presented fried chicken with lemon tucked into the flavor. When the server brought it out, he gave us full detail on how the chicken is prepared, cooked and seasoned. The level of energy and passion the server had while describing the chicken made it that much more exciting when trying it! I loved the fried chicken, the flavoring is *just* right, the meat was deliciously juicy and the skin was nice and crispy. Waffle Benedict -- So much flavor in this option. The bits of bacon are super thick and will fill you up in an instant, and the preparation of the benedict was just unbelievably tasty. By the time this dish got to us, the bucket of bird had already been completely demolished so getting through the waffle benedict was pretty tough. The lemon yolk sauce is to die for, seriously.With the amount of traffic in the restaurant, the service was very attentive and can you say remarkably friendly a million times over? They're way too kind and beaming at all times -- it's fantastic. Definitely coming back here a few more times in the near future. Only when I feel like eating the world is necessary, though.

3.0,12/27/2014,"Avid followers of Top Chef will recall Jeff McInnis (of Season 5) and Janine Booth (of Season 11); while the two competed in different seasons, only some were surprised to learn that the two chefs had plans underway to open Root & Bone in the East Village. The two met at Yardbird in 2010, a restaurant in Miami that McInnis was behind, and the rest, as they say, is history.I waited a fair amount of time before visiting Root & Bone, partially because Southern cuisine isn't my forte, and partially to let the inevitable opening hype die down. When reviews and feedback remained mostly positive, however, I finally came one summer evening with three others who were also curious to try what would come out the kitchens. As the restaurant had transitioned away from doing reservations, we arrived on the earlier end of dinner and were seated quickly. We went through the menu with ease, choosing the signature Fried Chicken, as well as a handful of starters and sides to help round out the meal.First and foremost, Root & Bone does an excellent biscuit. They're typically served three to an order, but the number can be adjusted for quartets (or whatever size group you come in). They have that crisp sheen on the exterior, which gives way to a perfectly soft and slightly crumbly interior; it's best when dipped into the sweet-savory honey chicken jus on the side and sprinkled with the accompanying toasted benne seed sea salt. The Macaroni & Cheese, which uses large elbow pasta and is baked with a crisp biscuit-thyme crust topping, is also satisfying, as it similarly exemplifies how a dish with various forms of texture can be executed to a tee. And the Waffle Cut Fries are also worth an order; they're fried to just the right crunch and the dill pickle salt and chunky remoulade on the side only make them even tastier.Unfortunately, not all the dishes were as successful. The side of Roots, which had various roasted and fried vegetables, was far too soggy, a feature that dulled the flavor of the purple carrots, turnips, and potatoes that had been utilized. And the Crispy Free Range Bucket of Bird wound up being a disappointment as well; the skin wasn't as crispy or well-seasoned as it could have been, and the interior white meat was much drier than I had expected. The sweet tea brine and lemon dusting was very faint, but the spiked Tabasco honey on the side was a smart, if slightly jarring, contrast to the protein.I've since learned that Root & Bone made a number of changes after opening; the various chicken sandwiches, which received a great deal of acclaim, have been taken off the menu and the fried chicken is no longer made to order. The latter is a change I can understand, given the build up of orders that must accrue during service, but it's a sacrifice that leaves the diner wanting. It unfortunately made the dining experience average at best, and should I return to Root & Bone, it will not be for the fried chicken.",21,9,13,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2244,608,6827

It was late Saturday night so we were seated without delay. On first sight, the ambience is nice and cozy with mismatched china and a mix of high and low tables.We wanted to keep it simple for our first time so decided to go with the fried chicken although the chef was offering a truffle ""special"" where you could have shaved truffles on your steak for 28 dollars or a 32 dollar truffled Mac and cheese.We ordered: half a bucket of chicken, grandma daisy's biscuits, butternut squash with black pepper marshmallows and root beer.The biscuits came out first and they were good but the chicken jus was what blew this out of the ballpark! As we were devouring the biscuits, the server told us there was no more root beer. So I asked for sprite. They served me fizzy water instead! Apparently something was ""not working"". So my only non-alcohol drink option was water. When we were halfway done with the biscuits they bought the chicken. This is some of the best fried chicken I've had. The sweet tea brine...seriously!!!We were still waiting for our side of butternut squash but couldn't wait to eat that chicken, so we started. We were almost done with our food and still no side. We asked the server and he said it would be another five minutes. At this point we were almost done with our meal, so we asked to cancel it. The server said ok to our faces but I saw him walk back to the bar and make huffy gestures to the other staff. Not cool, hipster. If you don't want people to cancel orders then pace your food. No one eats a side after they've finished their main course!In the end, we were still a bit hungry ( I guess that makes us a bit piggy) so we ordered dessert. Best. Decision. Ever.The sticky toffee cake with stout ice-cream and whiskey foam was just beyond delicious and totally redeemed all missteps.I'll be back and I'll know better than to order butternut squash!

4.0,12/20/2014,"There has been a lot of anticipation about this place ...so bf and I came to try on an early Saturday around 630-7. We had to wait about 45 then were able to sit at the bar.. The bar is pretty cramped, as is the entire restaurant. I'd say if you're with a large group, come at 5 to avoid an insane wait to do takeout next door at Little Root (their minuscule market next door). Their e my is relatively small and everyone comes for the fried chicken.  We did the half bucket of bird which is two breasts, a drumstick and wing.  It's as good as they say- crispy and juicy but not at all greasy, I guess the brining in sweet tea helped with that. The lemon salt flavor is subtle but there. For sides, we had the Mac and cheese which was really a must try- it was the combo of cheesy, salty and crunchy and had lot of texture. It was a toss p between that or the grits - they don't have the cornbread anymore so that's the only way you can taste it - in the Grits!  We also shared the roots which was quality locally sourced ingredients- turnips, carrots.. But they were a bit under seasoned and under cooked.  We also shared Grandma Daisey's biscuits,  which was the biggest letdown for $7. It was a nice biscuit, maybe on a tad dry side and the chicken jus gravy was light (maybe lacking in flavor?). Came with a pile of salt and sesame seed to sprinkle on which was very flavorful. We also had excellently crafted cocktails, and our bartender/server was very attentive, and detailed oriented.  I had the Smash and Grab which was nice and refreshing and BF had the Rye one ..

5.0,12/15/2014,"The East Village is becoming a fried chicken death trap.  Last I heard there was so much fryer grease circulating in this neighborhood that oil companies were going to start fracking Tompkins Square Park.  But I digress...When the ""Bucket of Bird"" was brought out, present parties declared that it was ""the most beautifully presented fried chicken"" they had ever seen.  But as we all know, looks alone ain't enough.  #amirightladies?It was indeed, a good serving of fried bird.  It had great lemony tang, and was juicy.  The special hot sauce they brought out added a good kick and a hint of sweet.For the sides, we ordered the mac and cheese and the spoonbread.Tip: don't ever order the mac & cheese AND the spoonbread... they'll run out of cheese... because it will all be in a smoky molten pile in front of you.But, cheese coma aside, the spoonbread was the standout hands down.Lovely drinks, lovely desserts, lovely staff (though, I have to say I expected more southern belle and less British accent), and a great setting.I'd be back in a flash, but now I have a tough decision to make... this or Bobwhite... oh the agony.",11,10,7,Ajay R.,"Brooklyn, NY",630,631,399
5.0,12/15/2014,"I think by the time we got seated, it was give or take an hour BUT, every sip of Bloody Mary and every bite of food was absolutely worth every minute we waited! This was my first time dining and my only complaint is I wish I had more room in my stomach. To start, the hostess staff was fantastic. With over 10 years of FOH/BOH experience, these girls definitely handled the chaos superbly well. Our waitress was super friendly and had a genuine smile the entire time. Not something you come across in NYC...EVER.The food was out of this world. No brunch is complete without a Bloody Mary, although their cocktail list looked delicious. I'm always on the hunt for a delicious Bloody Mary & they do theirs well. The perfect amount of spice. We started with the Drunken Deviled Eggs. DRUNKEN. Enough said. I went with the Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwich. I can't even put into words how delicious this was. And the whiskey maple syrup....GODLY. My friend went with the Waffle Benedict. If you like hollandaise sauce, theirs will put EVERYONE ELSES to shame. Pretty much if you have taste buds, you're not going to be disappointed with anything you order.I would also like to give recognition to Chef Jeff. (Very handsome btw.....) He appeared to be running a lot of the food and did a great job of taking a moment to explain the dishes, not just to us, but other guests as well. We even got a little 411 on some of their lighting and decor.Overall, this restaurant is definitely one of the best I have been to living in the city.

4.0,12/11/2014,"A world of amazing fried chicken and wildly caloric Southern staples greets anyone lucky enough to eat at this East Village hype machine. All in all, Root & Bone is well worth a visit, although in my opinion it is not the end all be all of fried chicken in NYC.So first of all, I came here for brunch and the fried chicken and waffles were the obvious choice. They were great and, as sad as it sounds, I think I might have loved the waffles as much if not more than the chicken. The waffles are covered in this thin slice of cheese and then dusted with sea salt and chives. There are also some chives in the batter I believe. They are amazing.My fried chicken, sadly, had soggy skin. This is usually where a yelper starts complaining and drops the 2/3 star but the soggy skin didn't ruin the meal for me. The chicken was still really tasty and the dehydrated lemon sprinkled on top was pretty awesome. The service here is also excellent and both the waitresses and chefs are really nice and happy to help you through the menu. One chef actually came out from behind the kitchen and seated me himself when I was standing at the entrance all confused. Awesome.The shrimp and grits here were kind of so-so. I liked them but I was kicking myself for not getting the biscuits instead. I think the problem was that the dish contained a little too much ham jus.Anyway, this place is great. I know it is very, very not cool in 2014/2015 to hype Blue Ribbon but they, along with Wilma Jean, Redhead, and Pies n' Thighs all have comparable fried chicken. They just don't have the bright lemony taste of R&B. So definitely try this place by for the hipster ambiance, the awesome waffles, and truly unique fried chicken.",2,0,0,Paul A.,"New York, NY",270,403,462
3.0,12/8/2014,"I'm far from a contrarian, so I hope no one takes this review as some sort of retribution against popular opinion. With that caveat, I'll note that Root & Bone is an attractive, well-executed restaurant. The shabby chic (if that's still what the kids call it) decor and the environment are appealing, down to the old-timey artwork about Grandma's pies in the restroom. The brunch menu has a great array of Southern-style favorites. The fried chicken waffle sandwich - doused with maple - was spot-on, and everything I expected from such a hot joint. The grits weren't the pride of the Carolinas or anything, but they were satisfying (in a calorically vicious sort of way). The cocktail list was also pretty solid, but in a City of financial excess, I thought they were a little low on the cost-to-enjoyment ratio. If I'm going to have bourbon, I prefer it not be in a 1.5-ounce tea cup.Anyway, I can see why Root & Bone is popular, but I think the lines are an indication that people might want to branch out to other spots in the neighborhood.

The service was great - our waitress was very helpful and made good recommendations. Also, the price point is really good. We each paid $34 + tip and we ate a LOT. Switchblade cocktail - I love cocktails with mezcal, and this was no exception. It was tart and exactly what I wanted. Spoonbread - my friends and I still do not know what spoonbread is, but it is delicious. It comes in a skillet and is essentially the consistency of very creamy polenta. It has a cream on top. This is an absolute must if you eat here. Mac and cheese - really good as well, a perfect ratio of the pasta and the cheese. It was creamy and really well seasoned.Deviled eggs - I am a big fan of deviled eggs, and had heard that they were delicious here. I thought they were good, but nothing epic. They're not a must. Bucket of chicken - this was amazing. We did the full bucket and had food left over. The chicken is perfectly fried and not greasy and is very juicy.

The handle of the beer tap are different kind of bones.Finally, back to food. I am glad the waiter suggested the Gooey Corn Spoonbread. With the buttermilk whip on top, it was delicious. The drunken deviled eggs are not average at all. I am glad the waiter explained to us why the egg white is pinkish. They were soaked in beet juice before it was served. There was only 3 halves of eggs but it was pefect given the many things we ordered. The Mac & Cheese is made with big pasta. And the softness of the pasta was perfect. This is one of my fav M&C in the city. We also have the half-bird. It was very crispy and I really like the flour they use to fry the chicken. Half bird is more than enough for a party of 2.

A favorite of mine. The waffle fried chicken sandwich was good but there were several drawbacks from all the pickled stuff included. Pickled green tomato, ocra, pickles and shallot was a bit much. Of course you can remove them but the couple of bites sorta turned me off. Also, the fried chicken felt a bit salty. It's all a matter of preference but you should still try it.

While everyone raves about the chicken waffles and Mac and cheese, my favorite dish had to be the short rib meatloaf. It was a perfectly tender, falling apart and flavorful roast. The chicken waffle was good in theory but the execution was poor as it wasn't piping hot and the cheese had congealed a little bit. The Mac and cheese was ok, I like a more cheesy sauce than saucy cheese, if that makes any sense. Most of the cocktails and beers are bitter which is great with the fried food.

3.0,11/16/2014,"Coming here, I had high expectations for their fried chicken and their take on Southern comfort food. I would say their take is classier, as befits New York. I am not an expert on Southern food, but I did not get the satisfying feeling you get after you eat comfort food.Thurs. night at 6pm, the wait was not too bad for 4 people. If you come at 6pm, right on the dot, there is only a 10 min. wait. They will only seat you with your whole party there.Crispy Free Range Bucket of Bird - This consists of two wings, two breasts, legs, a thigh. It was good fried chicken, but I wouldn't say it was the best I have eaten. It is free range so less greasy and on the leaner side. With the description of tea-brined with lemon, I expected some unique zest to it, but I did not taste anything out of the ordinary. The chicken wing was nice and moist, but the breast was really dry, as expected of white meat.Tabasco Whiskey Honey Sauce - Perfect sauce on the chicken. The chicken is not as great without it.Grandma Daisy's Buttermilk Angel Biscuits - Delicious. We thought it came with 3, so added an extra one for added cost, but instead we got 5? On the side, they give you honey roasted chicken jus, fresh thyme, and toasted benne seed sea salt. Dipped in the sauce, the biscuits take on a sweet taste. Though small, the biscuits were incredibly fluffy.Macaroni and Cheese - This dish was bland to me. There was not much taste to it, despite looking so cheesy.Root Vegetables - Full of interesting colored rainbow vegetables, including purple carrots, potatoes, turnips, etc. I loved the crunch from the root chips, and the juicy, pickled grapes added some sweetness. Great side dish to go along with the chicken.Waffle Cut French Fries - Delicious and Crispy, my favorite kind of fry. Made better with the dill pickle salt scattered on top.Very friendly staff. Nicest staff ever. There was a wait outside, but we sat at the table for a while and they did not ask us to leave. I feel bad about that but did not see the people waiting outside.

My favorite is the chocolate bourbon pecan pie.  The thick apple pie is served with cheese gelato. Watching sugar? You can share the dessert.

The design inside is eclectic but not busy. Beyond the neat beer taps, above the bar the lights were actually crystal decanters hung at different heights with their bottoms cut out. Smart. Interesting. Unique. My friend and I sat at the small 4-seat bar in the second room (where they do serve the full menu). Originally we were just going to have drinks and maybe an appetizer. Well that turned into 2 appetizers and an entree and 2 cocktails. The bartender was pleasant and didn't make us feel rushed (a nice positive in a city full of quick table turns). We shared the charred romaine salad to which we added the ""house-made"" bacon. The bacon was the bomb! Get that! Also, we had the deviled eggs which were pickled so the eggs themselves were kind of purple in color. Very rich, but well worth it. Lastly, my friend ordered the fish of the day, which looked lovely, but I honestly didn't try any so I can't speak to how it tasted. All in all, I liked this spot.

3.0,11/6/2014,Supposedly the best fried chicken in NYC it's good but not the best. Really a nicely appointment small place the staff was courteous & fairly accommodating. The chicken was good  but could have been definitely better too much lemon that it tool away from the sweet tea brine and the wings were not  fried quite enough to get that perfect crispy Skin.  The roots were interesting but nothing to write home about. All in all its tasty but could be executed much better & for the price not a great value. The desserts looked great but I didn't try any of them. It's worth trying for yourself but don't go in expecting the best fried chicken around because it's not quite there.,0,0,0,Mr. D.,"Santa Ana, CA",16,105,323

I love their chicken.  Very flavorful.  What gives it its flavor is their awesome sauce, in which it includes a citrusy, spicey, sweet taste. Their waffle fries with Bacon was a hit also, along with their mac and cheese.  Expect to be put on a wait list, because the restaurant gets packed, especially for brunch!  Definitely worth the wait.",2,0,0,Jen B.,"Las Vegas, NV",415,149,158

Everything we ordered was delicious and definitely worth getting again:Chicken and waffle sandwich: They got rid of the top waffle ""bun"" so now it's just a stack of waffle, chicken, tomato and what looked to be an okra. Delicious despite the waffle being a little too soft, borderline soggy, but I guess that's inevitable when you top it with just cooked chicken.Basket of chicken: Seasoning good. Crispy. Delicious. No other words necessary.Mac and Cheese: Was probably the best out of the three. So good.And the sauces that came out with our food? Maple and balsamic was it? Hot sauce and honey?

Had the biscuits, pumpkin soup, deviled eggs, wedge salad and half a chicken. The chicken, as everyone seems to agree on, is incredible - but I don't like how they didn't offer a side or two with half a chicken.

The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. And the honey tobasco is pretty amazing. Dip it!Don't get the crab omelet, it was complete shit.The meatloaf was great! When I think meatloaf, I picture a disgusting slab of ground meat, but their meatloaf is actually short rib! They should rename this dish.The biscuits were average.

They said they'd call, we went to a bar next door. 2 hours later, turns out they wrote our number wrong and crossed us off the list after no answer. Well here is where it picks up: the manager comes over full of apologies (and biscuits and deviled eggs on the house too). Needless to say, we weren't too upset. We sat down in a cute, tight packed room. We ordered a whole fried chicken, Mac and cheese, and meatloaf (as per the managers suggestion). For a party of four, it was a perfect amount of food. They have honey hot sauce and whiskey syrup. Delicious. Everything was yummy, home cooked (but way better than anyone can actually home cook) style food. They also had some live music come in that gave it an adorable, southern throw back feel. All in all, after a two hour wait resulting in us eating at 11:30, we still left really happy.

4.0,10/29/2014,"Dined here for dinner on a Monday night with 3 girlfriends. Overall the food was AMAZING but the atmosphere is just meh. We had a bit of a wait, since they won't seat you until your entire party arrives. The food was some of the best southern cuisine I've had in NYC, although the portions are tiny.  The fried chicken was unbelievable as was the mac & cheese and roasted squash. The corn spoon bread was a stellar bowl of cheesy corn goodness and the short rib meat loaf was very tasty but not quite as good as the chicken. Cocktails were pretty standard and the service was friendly and on point. Didn't have the biscuits, but will definitely be going back to try these as they looked awesome.The space is cute, very shabby chic,farmhouse style decor, but it is very small and very cramped. Hopefully you like your neighbors because you will be basically sitting on top of them. (Our neighbors were kind of my heroes though for ordering both the cornbread and the biscuit appetizer, well done sir, well done.) The chairs at the tables are old school house style so you can store your bags, etc. in the cubby underneath them to keep things out of your way.Definitely a great spot to hit up on off peak dining hours, unless you have time to kill and can enjoy a pre-meal cocktail in one of the bars on the block.

3.0,10/27/2014,"Root & Bone is a quaint little restaurant. It may seem a little small at first, but there's actually more room further inside. The bozo and I got here by 11:45am on a Saturday and we were quoted a 30 min wait. Mind you, it opened at 11:30am. 15 mins makes a difference! Either get here early, or get here late. Don't be a hooligan and come at prime time just to wait longer than you should. The 30 mins wait wasn't too bad. I've enjoyed the experience, but I must say, I was really disappointed in the chicken and waffle sandwich. Our sole purpose of coming here, was just for that dish to satisfy my fatty cravings. I've had Roscoe's, Amy Ruth, and etc and unfortunately, this did not make the cut. Not even close. The chicken was crispy and light which I appreciated bc it wasn't oily. But it lacked flavor even on the skin. If you're like me, thinking about trooping all the way here just for the chicken, then be forewarned, and set your expectations low.Now, what saved our meal from ending in a disappointing note, was surprisingly the deviled eggs which were phenomenal and had such a beautiful presentation. The colors were so pretty. Pink egg base, yellow swirls of yokie mixture topped with a tiny colorful taro chip. The creaminess of the egg filling was slightly rich but bold. The worst part was that it only came with three and guess who ate two?:: looking guilty, then pointing at the bozo :: Overall, this little southern gem was cool but needs to focus more on making the bird more flavorful.

Was told there would be a 1 1/2 hour wait, which turned out to be a pleasantly surprising 30 min wait.We ordered the 1/2 bird fried chicken and the whiskey cheddar waffles. Also had the okra cola and a cherry cola.The fried chicken. Couldn't read a review without the chicken being mentioned. The Holy Grail of chicken. Worlds best fried chicken. Push your mom in front if a bus to get to this amazing fried chicken. What a let down.The chicken was moist and the skin was nice and crispy, but there was no real flavor. Im not sure if I overhyped myself into thinking this would be the best fried chicken ever or what. There was a bottle of a hot sauce (tobasco?) and honey concoction, which gave the flesh some actual taste.On to the waffles. Another disappointment. Didnt taste the whiskey, tasted like regular waffles with some cheese. The one saving grace were the scallions, it truly gave the waffles a needed kick in the flavor department. This came with a bottle of syrup, which didnt do much, at least not for me.The okra cola was just house cola with a quirky name.On a positive note the waitstaff were very friendly and the food came out very fast.Overall a very disappointing meal, especially when you expect so much, flavorwise.

4.0,10/24/2014,"A solid meal.  My boyfriend and I went there last Wednesday prepared to wait and have cocktails at another restaurant.  We were told the wait would approximately be an hour, we put our names on a list (specifying we wanted a table), and received a call that our table was ready 45 minutes later.The restaurant feels like a quaint shabby chic farmhouse and boasts an open kitchen. It was refreshing.  However, this is a farmhouse that is willing to accommodate as many villagers as possible, including the occasional idiots, so you will likely be in close proximity to your neighbors, who may or may not be extremely loud and ignorant. Our table was located in the middle of the main room, which was quite loud in part due to the music, and I was unable to hear my boyfriend.  If you're going on an early in the game date, you may want to sit in a place that doesn't mandate shouting.  The place was packed the evening we visited so the service was extremely slow, the syrup canister we were given was a  sticky mess, and the only bathroom appeared to be a war zone, littered with paper towels with the toilet covered in urine.  At least people are washing their hands, so that's a positive.We ordered a decent amount of food- fried chicken, deviled eggs, waffles, mac and cheese, and gooey corn spoonbread.  Everything was hot and flavorful.  As others have pointed out, the waffles are not as crisp as they can be, but the chicken was crispy and moist and the mac and cheese was perfectly cooked. The gooey corn spoonbread tasted a bit like baby food to me, but I have never had that dish so I'm not in a position to judge.   Is it the best fried chicken in the city?  I think that's clearly subjective, taking into account the fact that people genetically vary in their experience of taste.  Most people seem to like it. The bottom line is that chicken is good.  The food is good. If you don't mind the prices and are reasonable about the time you may have to wait, there's a moderate to high probability you'll enjoy it.",1,1,0,Courtney D.,"New York, NY",20,7,0
4.0,10/23/2014,"Yum!  This place is good.  My friend and I trekked all the way to Ave B in the rain last night, but it was worth it!  We didn't have much of a wait.  I wanted to hold out for a table, so we actually could have been seated a little sooner.  The table was nice, although I'm sure sitting at the bar/counter would have been fine too.  This place was actually a little bit bigger than I had imagined.  When you walk in it's a tiny area where the hostess' are there to greet you/do take out, and are super nice/friendly, and then there are two (smallish) rooms with tables and counter space, and one counter facing the open kitchen so you can watch them prepare the food. We decided to go with small plates, and just share everything.  Everything came out really quick.  First up was the gooey corn spoonbread, and it was so good.  I didn't even know what spoonbread was, and it didn't matter cause it was great.  Then they accidentally brought up biscuits meant for the table next to us, and after giving it to them they felt bad and brought some biscuits for us to have.  Again, amazing!  They suggest splitting it apart and dipping it in the jus they give you and then sprinkling it with sesame seeds and salt.  The fried chicken and waffle sandwiches did not disappoint!  I'm not even a huge friend chicken person, but that was the main draw for going and I definitely enjoyed it. We were starting to get full, but we still had more food on the way.  Next up the grilled butternut squash.. had to get a vegetable in there, right? It was grilled and had salt and pepper marshmallows on top, so it was a vegetable, but prob not the healthiest.  Last up were the grits. It was pretty similar to the spoonbread, esp with the pieces of corn in it, but I didn't mind cause it tasted so good.  Even though we were stuffed (we got some of the butternut squash and grits packed up) we couldn't leave without dessert.  So we were between the red velvet cake and the apple tart, and per recommendation we got the apple tart. Again, it didn't disappoint!  It was nice and warm, and had ice cream and an apple chip on top.  Needless to say, I would definitely come back.  I think the chances of going and having a wait are pretty high, but I think it might be worth it.  It was definitely a nice, warm, and comforting meal on a  cold, rainy night.",0,0,1,Rachel W.,"Manhattan, NY",284,202,541
1.0,10/22/2014,"I think the idea of this place is great.  The fried chicken, the grits, the okra, etc.  It all makes sense, I get it. The thing is, there are so many places like this place. I know what separates this place from others like it, and they arent good things.  The scene:Arrived on a decently warm Sunday afternoon looking to get some viddles from a place which we thought was highly-rated.  We encountered a woman that informed us we would be able to sit in 30 mins, no problem, so we hovered. The nice young woman then offers to take our number and call us.  We go across the street and wait, the phone rings about 15 minutes later. Jackpot!! Nope! We get hung up on but quickly call back. The woman says she never called us and we have to come to the restaurant to put our name in. We return to explain the situation, about how we came, left a name and number and were called. She informed us, ""she knew who we were"" and walked away.  15 minutes go by and we walk up to the nice young woman and she informs us that the tables she seated were  people who were waiting that had been called...just as we thought we had been. We walked away hungry. Two weeks later:Following the bad first experience we decided to try it again, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice...you know how it goes.  So, we approach the restaurant, which now has a different set up, you approach a small door that is also the ""takeaway door"" and we gave our name to different nice young woman.  She told us that it would be about 30 minutes for 2 people and that was fine with us, but alas, she mentioned we could also order food at the window and sit outside. We figured that would work, so we ordered. After we had ordered and as we were filling our drinks at the soda machine, about to try and sit, we realized there were no tables outside, but a bench to sit and wait.  What seemed like 4 minutes later the same woman who took our names walked out of the takeaway door with a couple items of food that appeared to be ours.  After flagging her down we tried to tell her we did not have a table yet. She proceeded to have an extended conversation with a random passerby while she held our once warm food in her hand.  She followed that niceness by saying, ""I told you it would come out fast"".  As we stood there trying to figure out what to do.  The bar next door took us in.  Thankfully.  So, we got our lukewarm takeaway and sat in a bar next door which was not our plan or ideal for a brunch.  Mostly not cool. The food:Sorry to say, the best part of this meal were the waffle fries, by a long shot.  We also ordered the $6 deviled eggs and swore they were quail eggs (3 halves - thats $2 per ""quail egg"" half!!!!!) they were that small and also tasteless.  The cheese-covered grits were tasty, thanks to the cheese!!  I hoped redemption would come  in the form of fried chicken and waffle sandwiches.  I was wrong.  The sandwiches showed up sans tops, a la open-faced, which made for a tough maneuver if its meant to be a sandwich.  We were hungry and sitting in a bar unrelated to Root and Bone so there was nothing we could do.  We ate half of a half before encountering three rubbery, chewy and in our estimation in-eatable bites and gave up.  The cornbread was just ok.",3,3,2,Josh M.,"Brooklyn, NY",379,459,52

The fried skin should be the best part and I usually rip it off the breast before my dining companion has any time to protest but when I lunged and ate my first piece this time it tasted like crunchy, flavorless, fat. Because the texture of the breading was nice, I just doused everything in the tabasco honey to make up for the lack of flavor in the chicken itself.           Cheese Grits- Were too similar to the Spoonbread, the grits' texture was very close to the cornmeal with the cheese and the corn kernels. So we decided to take it home and ordered the mac and cheese to see what they would be like.            Mac and Cheese- My favorite of the evening.           Service: The server was super friendly and informative.

Very well balanced and a huge portion of TWO sandwiches per order, which makes it great to share.

Great friendly service with a well designed cozy interior, I really enjoyed the thoughtful root and bone graphics and atmosphere. For a place that's only been open for 4 days it seemed like they really have it down. If I had to make one complaint, I think the pickled green tomatoes on the sandwich could have been sliced thinner. They were delicious and my girlfriend swears they tasted like lemon meringue pie but maybe they overwhelmed the chicken being cut so thick.edit: I recently went back for their shrimp and grits and they were extremely good.

They were really buttery and on the heavier side though, so we ended up with one left untouched. Waffle fries are just your normal fried, nothing to write home about. Then the chicken arrived: the chicken skin was thin and crispy just the way I like it, and seasoned really well. The sweet tea brine worked its magic and even the chicken breast was juicy and tender.

I know it's the LES and it is becoming the ""chic"" thing to do--that is not taking reservations. But come on! It is NYC and 2014. My boss and I agreed to meet at 6:30 and luckily that is considered an early dinner for NYC so our wait wasn't too long.

Setting: It is a really cute spot with a very farm-ish decor.Drinks: My boss and I started with their speciality cocktails. I can't remember what I had so that should tell you the impression it left. As with every other place in NYC the drinks are way too overpriced for my southern heart but hey when in Rome...Food: We began our meal with the fried green tomatoes...which I just realized are no longer on the menu! BLASPHEMY. The fried green tomatoes were amazing. I hate tomatoes and I loved this dish. Bring it back! We also ordered the half chicken which was good--not the NYC best but it was decent for NY standards. My boss and I both agreed that there was some inconsistency with the pieces of chicken. In some pieces we could taste all the quoted flavors (sweet tea and lemon) whereas in others we couldn't. However, the tabasco honey really saved the day. As much as I hate tomatoes, I also hate spicy food so if I am saying TABASCO saved the day just know that it was really good!

But their breadcrumbs were very noticeable unlike many others.Chicken... chicken....you can tell that it had uneven coating. Not too crunch exterior, however, an extremely juicy meat. You get a hint of the sweet tea brine that they're known for, but eh. I could positively say that this is not the best fried chicken you'll find in nyc.Cheddar waffles.

4.0,10/14/2014,I'd say this place is a solid 4. Love the chicken & waffle sandwich...though the syrup was hard to extract out of the containers. The fried chicken was also good either on its own or with the sweet and spicy sauce (also hard to extract). The root (roasted roots) was somewhat bland. For dessert we tried the buttermilk panna cotta. Really delish. If you come early (maybe around 5:30 or 6) there isn't much of a wait.,0,0,0,Musetta S.,"Emeryville, CA",176,139,193

I ordered the Sweet Tea, which wasn't too sweet, but instead just right! We ordered a few other things in addition to the list above (corn on the cob, waffle fries, waffles, macaroni and cheese), but the fried chicken and deviled eggs are so so good. The skin on the fried chicken is perfectly crispy, and the meat delicious and moist. I scarfed down my first piece because I was so hungry, but if you take your time (and chew between bites) you'll pick up on the lemon flavor of the chicken. It's not overpowering at all, but instead adds a refreshing little zing. JUST TRY THE CHICKEN ALREADY.The cornbread is also awesome. I love when cornbread has little bits of corn in it.

They use it to describe having an occasional meal that doesn't fall on some boring list of tasteless food that -- while providing sustenance -- doesn't provide the blissful happiness that comes from a truly marvelous meal. Let's be clear here. The real ""cheat day"" is if you go to a place like Root & Bone and you don't get the crispy, free-range Bucket of Bird. That's cheating YOURSELF.Now, we probably didn't have to get deviled eggs (gorgeous), corn bread (not bad), salad (salad), and multiple orders of mac & cheese (excellent) too...but I had eaten some healthy fried cheese curds earlier that evening, so I felt like I was due for a little extra indulgence.Root & Bone also makes everything easier by having the sweetest of people working the most efficient of take-out counters, so you don't even need to go into the actual restaurant and bother the diners if you'd rather shamefully stuff your face in the comfort of your friend's apartment.",22,22,12,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4675,3021,10459

Also the drinks took a while to come out. We order drinks before our food, and we were served our drinks after our entree came out.

As if they used a roux but didn't cook it enough.  Idk.  It was fine, but not a must.I'm tempted to give Root & Bone another try, because I was soo excited for it, and I really do hope the lack of crispiness on our chicken was a one-off.  I don't want to try it and be disappointed yet again though.  I will say that I was impressed with the friendly, attentive serve, and for a shop that had just opened up, it seemed to be running pretty smoothly, so those were definitely pluses!",0,0,0,Yoko M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,150,12

The signature dish at this restaurant is a fried chicken and waffle sandwich.While seated, I looked around to see what people were eating and most of the tables had someone eating this sandwich. However, I ended up ordering the half fried chicken in a basket instead (without the waffle). I also ordered the waffle benedict. I really didn't expect both dishes to be this gooooooooooooooooood! The chicken was so crispy and tasty. Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had in my life! This is only a guess, but I think they may have used potato starch flour instead of regular flour. I thought this because my mom makes great Japanese fried chicken (karaage) back home in Japan and the crusty outside is very similar (^_^) Potato starch flour makes it much more light with a very soft yet crispy outside.I am not a fan of southern food or waffles, but this waffle benedict is the exception. It was fluffy like pound cake. They could definitely change my mind about waffles forever ~(~_~)~ The poached eggs with lemon yolk sauce and side salad were also great. My only complaint is the two pieces of tiny cut bacon that came with this dish. You can order extra bacon as a side, but I wish they were a more generous size. :(Over all I give this place 4 hearts.

We loved every dish we ordered - the fried chicken and waffles sandwich, the succotash, and of course THE CHICKEN! The chicken was moist, juicy, tender and flavorful. Apparently, they brine the chicken first and it totally makes a difference. I've never been so passionate about fried chicken and when I took the first bite, I heard angels singing. Seriously its that good. They provide sauce but I didn't even use it because it was just that delicious.At first sight, $18 for half a bird is an eye sore but after my meal, I can say that the price is completely justified. There are 4 or 5 pieces but they're huge and very filling. I'd also recommend trying the fried chicken and waffles sandwich. I originally scoffed at my friend for the idea of getting chicken and more chicken but really, what do I know? The waffles were amazing and the fried chicken was actually a different kind (more similar to the traditional style).One downside is the size of the restaurant.

4.0,8/28/2014,"Went there with a friend, a few nights ago, for dinner.Food - Good. Very good.The fried chicken is one of the best I've tried in the city. The hint of lemon with herbs combined with the crispy, crispy skin. YUM!Service - Very attentive. We accidentally dropped our waffle fries (because the table was a tad small) and without us asking the waitress replaced it with a new batch. The hostess at the door was very bubbly and quite funny. I walked in with a smile and out with some laughs. Ambiance - It is a fairly small restaurant so it felt like a squeeze (but luckily the food and service made up for it). The only complaint I have is that it was quite loud in the restaurant, so maybe not the best choice for a quiet date (definitely not when they are busy which unfortunately is pretty much every night). Overall - Highly recommended. Go, be prepared to wait, but it will be worth it.",1,1,2,Vivian Y.,"New York, NY",16,74,168
3.0,8/28/2014,"I've been here twice and I will say that this place gets way more hype than it deserves.   Like Clinton Bakery across Houston Street, it's not worth the wait. So make reservations.My Yankee taste buds tell me the fried chicken is variable - from fair to good depending on the day.  It's really no better than Bobwhite over on Avenue C which is a much better value for comfort food in the neighborhood.  But that place offers a very different experience.The short rib meat loaf was alright.  My friend had the Shrimp and grits.  It was smothered in an orange sauce that reminded me of General Tso's Chicken. The smoked pork chop was excellent - as good as Mustard's Grill in Napa Valley.",1,0,0,Mark M.,"Manhattan, NY",3,31,5
5.0,8/27/2014,"I had the most AMAZING time here tonight. My friend and I, after reading Tasting Table's list of best fried chicken spots in NYC, decided to embark on our own after-work mini fried chicken crawl. This was the first spot we hit up. We love, love, LOVED the layout and decor of Root & Bone--it's rustic enough to feel homey, and the details feel kind of like a Pinterest board threw up all over everything...in a good way. It's utterly charming. It's like stepping outside of New York for a minute, even smack dab in the middle of the Lower East Side. We got there a little after 6 PM and it was relatively empty so we were seated at the counter in front of the open kitchen. The staff and chefs were super-friendly! My friend and I ordered the fried chicken. We ordered the half size since we figured we'd save some room for the other fried chicken we'd eat during our crawl.We never made it to the other fried chicken spots.One bite in, we looked at each other and communicated with our eyes that a) this was the best damn fried chicken we had ever had in our entire lives and b) we were going to stay right there and eat fried chicken until we physically could not eat any more. And that is exactly what we did. The chefs told us that the chicken was brined in sweet tea, so we ordered two glasses of that, too. It was the best sweet tea in the world. I actually thought I was going to start crying. Like, I'm not even joking. Tears sprang to my eyes. I know the crowd there is kinda hip or whatever but my friend and I ditched our manners and tore into that chicken, and our subsequent order of it, like we were animals. ANIMALS. My face, hands, and hair were covered in fried chicken. I didn't even care. I started humming Beyoncé and I didn't even notice until I was halfway through ""1+1"". I placed an additional order to go and cabbed it to my mom's apartment on the Upper East Side because she had to, had to, HAD to try it. She started singing and dancing after her first bite. I can't make this up. It really happened.I'm writing this now because I feel a sense of happiness and peace I never thought I could achieve through eating food. I feel like my soul got a hug, like a real bear hug--none of that side-hug business. My friend and I are planning to go back next week. Our lives will never be the same. GO HERE.

4.0,8/27/2014,"I'd say 3.5 stars but I would consider going back there (and I didn't have a negative experience) so I give it 4. Went there for brunch on a Saturday. Wait was not bad (at around 12pm).Everyone has different taste in fried chicken right... Lots of people like Korean style fried chicken but I really don't like it- I'm more of an Amy Ruth's fried chicken kinda person. Part of the reason why I didn't love this fried chicken may have been because I ordered the half chicken for myself and it was too much (the server seemed to be new so I will be forgiving, but they should have told me that we ordered too much food). By the time I ate the thigh and the breast I was really full (we also ordered the pickled quail eggs and mac and cheese) and the bottom two pieces had become a bit soggy. I think it's cute to have ""chicken in a basket"", but as someone who loves fried chicken, I'd rather not have them stacked up on top of each other.The flavors were pretty awesome though. Apparently they brine them in tea. It's dusted with a lemon salt and it kind of tasted a bit like dill as well. I liked the mac and cheese a lot- very creamy! But again, I was pretty full so appreciation for everything was going downhill...Between two people, I'd say a half chicken, mac and cheese and maybe a small appetizer would be plenty for brunch. I really like the fact that they use free range chicken (though I'm not so sure what the definition of free range means these days...).",0,0,0,K K.,"New York, NY",6,72,77

I had the fried chicken and waffle sandwiches -- which were delicious and plenty of food as a meal. The chicken is wonderfully crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside.

We are coming back to try the remaining items on the menu for the shrimp and grits, the waffle fries, the pears and the succotash as it looked amazing on other peoples tables!  Get there early in the week and when they open at 5:30pm or you will be waiting.

5.0,8/25/2014,"KenScale: 9.0/10Root & Bone is a new restaurant from Top Chef alums Jeff McInnis and Janine Booth who previously worked at the acclaimed Yardbird in Miami featuring traditional Southern food. I haven't quite appreciated how great the Southern cooking can be, as I have always been more interested in New American style cuisine with global influences instead of fried chickens, mac and cheese, etc. Root & Bone proved me quite wrong. I had an awesome dinner on a recent weekend, absolutely in love with the hearty dishes coming out of this kitchen (also approved by two friends in my dining table who were huge fans of Yardbird while they were in Miami). As I had a dining party of four, I had an opportunity to sample a variety of dishes. You have to start with biscuits here, absolutely tasty bites with silky smooth texture that you can dip in honey roasted chicken jus and sea salt. I also liked the cornbread and deviled eggs (which came in pink) as well. Obviously, the highlight of the dinner was fried chicken. I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken in general, but the bucket of bird here was perfectly crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside. Given that we ordered a bunch of dishes, we settled with half bird, but I think we could've gone with the whole bird. Side dishes of macaroni and cheese and waffle cut French fries were not just average dishes you see at cheap chain restaurants either, each rich in flavor. I was also very impressed with the braised short rib meat loaf (it was closer to a very moist and juicy short rib dish than what you would normally expect from a mushy meat loaf) and shrimp and grits (very rustic with very crisp shrimp pieces). For dessert, try at least one or two Southern-inspired dishes such as the decadent dark chocolate Mississippi mud or the peach and blackberry tart that comes with sweet corn and thyme ice cream. Although it takes reservations, Root & Bone is primarily a walk-in restaurant. I showed up around 7 on Sunday and had to wait for about 30 minutes, which wasn't that bad considering the buzz coming out of this restaurant. I liked the hip neighborhood joint vibe coming from the restaurant. Definitely try some draft beer or cocktails like filthy Manhattan to go along with the dishes. I truly believe Root & Bone is a winner that I am glad opened this year, with so many outstanding dishes that made me appreciate how great the Southern cuisine can be.

2.0,8/22/2014,"Wanted to LOVE this place...but such a huge disappointment. After loving their Miami establishment we were thrilled to have them in NYC. Came in on a Sat night at 5:30. Figured we would have best of the best as the restaurant just reopened after a break from the brunch rush. We ordered the 1/2 chicken with waffles. The chicken was very good, tender and juicy inside and crispy, crunchy, not greasy coating. But the size of the chicken was much smaller than I anticipated (more the size of a cornish hen). The waffles were tasteless and barely warm. A side of their ""famous"" Grandma Daisy's biscuits were dry, no flavor of thyme and cold as well. The jus was watery broth.The best thing that we had was the grilled sweet  corn...husk  n all, done 3 ways, homemade corn nuts, popped corn with cornbread butter and an ear of corn grilled in the husk cut into portions. It was heavenly.We should have sent the waffles and biscuits back but we were starving. We had originally come for brunch but there was a two hour wait which brought us very close to their afternoon closing so we opted to wait for dinner opening. 2 stars for the corn and the very attentive staff who constantly had our water glasses full.

4.0,8/13/2014,"I'd give five stars for the chicken alone.  Because, let me just get it out of the way - Root & Bone is some of the best fried chicken I've ever had.  It's a bold statement.  I want to doubt myself for saying it - I feel your incredulity already, but it's true !Root & Bone is flexible with how you order the chicken - you can do half baskets (4 pieces), full baskets or any kind of baskets, which is what I did, cause it's all about the thighs, baby.I dream about that lusty, lusty crust, lightly sprinkled with soft sugar flakes, because chicken skin makes the best kind of dessert you can ever have.The chicken itself is incredibly succulent, brined overnight in sweet tea (which you should also order here because it's the right amount of tasty) and oh so flavorful.  Coupled with that crisp skin, each bite is absolute perfection, though most of us liked to peel the skin off to eat at the end, savoring the very best for last.But aside from the chicken, I've yet to find a side I like - we tried the waffles (too thick and bready), the biscuits (too dense, hard and flat), and the macaroni and cheese (very cheesy and rich).  I know - I just have to return to try the waffle fries, the cornbread and some of those duhlicious sounding pies.",4,5,4,Han C.,"New York, NY",147,397,80
4.0,8/13/2014,"I was aware of the hype surrounding this place and had been dying to go since they opened. After some confusing phone calls regarding reservations (only available for parties of 6 or more), our party of 5 came on a Tuesday evening around 6 or 6:30 pm. I was expecting a long wait, especially after seeing just how small the place was. After taking counter seats first, a table opened up after maybe a 20 minute total wait, so not too bad at all. Had some drinks and lemonade - there was also some delay in a whiskey my friend ordered that ended up not being available after they told him it was coming out in a minute - miscommunication!!! Now on to the food - Cornbread with clotted cream and jam - cornbread was good but nothing super special. It was a little dry. I was mainly interested in trying the clotted cream, which tastes similar to cream cheese. Drunken deviled eggs were very prettily presented - pink!! Tasted good. FRIED CHICkEN - delicious!! perfectly crispy and moist. The lemon/tea flavors didn't obviously come thru but you could tell there was something extra about the chicken. Didn't disappoint.For sides we had the mac n cheese and the cheese grits. The mac and cheese was delicious - the pasta had some bite to it and there was a crispy breadcrumb topping so the entire dish had some texture instead of being mushy as M&C can often be. The cheese grits were good also, little bland tho. We had the chocolate cake with the beet sorbet for dessert - the sorbet was definitely all beet but I just don't care for beet in general.

Make sure you go with a big group to maximize your chance of sharing and trying as many plates as possible. Each dish is a fun and creative spin on southern classics (ex: chicken n waffle sandwiches; shortrib meatloaf with tomato jam). Other highlights included the shrimp n grits, the mac n cheese, and you can't go wrong with the fried chicken. Also, like Yardbird, they have an impressive list of must-try cocktails (I personally love the Lady J Ivory). We had such a good meal that we snagged a reservation for 6 weeks later on our way out.The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that the seating is a bit cramped.

It was great for people watching & getting a cool breeze while eating. Our server ""D"" was excellent. Always refilling water and being there whenever we needed. Now for the food, between the two of us we ordered the fried chicken (1/2 & full bird) fries, Mac n cheese, & watermelon/celery salad and as our order arrived, to our surprise, Chef McGinnis came to our table and gave us some of the awesome cheddar waffles to go along with our meal. He also explained to us the different sauces (tabasco/honey & bourbon/maple) and how they prepare the chicken. So cool. Everything was delicious and the chicken was to die for & crispy the way I like. I definitely noticed the difference that brining makes & could taste the added lemon flavor.

3.0,8/11/2014,"My friend Joanna and I wanted to try this place out after hearing some great reviews do we headed over here right before the dinner shift was open. There were a couple of people waiting just like us so the hype of this places still intrigued me. The decor and styling of the place made me feel like I was eating inside an Anthropologie with that rustic home goods kind of feel. Definitely cosy and in close quarters with your fellow carnivores. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share starting off with Grandma Daisys Angel Biscuits, Mac and cheese, waffle fries, and half a basket of chicken with waffles on the side.The biscuits and gravy were light and fluffy. You can peel off every layer and dip them in the savory gravy. They also include a sea salt and sesame seeds mix on the cutting board to dip your biscuit in addition to the gravy.The waffle fries were definitely a good choice. Crispy and fresh out of the fryer. They came with a nice remoulade that was a mix of peppercorns, mustard, and spice. It was a nice addition to the fries that made the dish.The Mac and cheese was tasty and had a generous amount of garlic bread crumbs on top. I enjoyed this a little more than my friend but the cheese was rich enough without over powering your palette. It was a nice strong cheddar with another light cheese mixed in. I would order this as alternative for anyone not eating the fried chicken.The fried chicken was excellent! I let my fried take the drum stick and wing while I took both thighs. The skin was super crispy and had a lovely crunch to it. It also helped that it came with a Tabasco honey for the dry parts of the thighs. The waffles were decent but didn't really do me any justice. They were topped with cheddar cheese and spring onions. They were a bit dry and just a filler for us.For dessert we had a peach and black berry tart and a banana cream pie in a mason jar. I preferred the banana cream pie in a jar. It had light pieces of mint leaves inside the mix that definitely gave a cool refreshing twist to the dessert. The tart was served with a thyme  ice cream as well but it wasn't my favorite. The fruit within the tart was fresh and the peaches were sweet without being sour at all.Overall the meal was decent and filling but it's not something I would crave from week to week.

4.0,8/10/2014,"When is the right time to visit a new restaurant? Given the expected strain on any kitchen should they be faced with hordes of marauding diners, personally I find it pointless to visit a restaurant in its initial few weeks. Same has been my experience at Root and Bone, where I've only seen an improvement in consistency in my subsequent visits. The servers are relaxed, the kitchen is not cracking under pressure, and the reception staff is positively welcoming and warm in comparison to the first few weeks - when their response led me to waste little time in walking over to the nearby lunch and supper counter also reputable for its fried chicken.I haven't followed the hoopla around Top Chef alums Jeff McInnis and Janine Booth, but wish them much success. I did have the opportunity to watch them in action as I sat on the counter stool across the open kitchen (the stool being a few inches short of the right height). Without reading into the manic energy in the kitchen, both the pedigree of cooking and the design of the dishes are unquestioned.""Please enjoy the biscuits hot off the oven. The best way to do so is to dip them in the chicken gravy and then sprinkle them with sea salt and sesame seeds before eating."" The server's instructions were suitably detailed in line with the dish's conceptualization and flawless execution. The soft and fluffy (not crumbly) cornbread by itself is competent, but paired with clotted cream, and the preserve (in particular), becomes memorable. The famed fried chicken is brined in sweet tea and dusted with pickled lemon (I missed the suggested hint of pepper), and served with Tabasco Honey - it's lightly fried, while providing the right contrast of a crisp exterior and juicy inside.  The Mac and Cheese is amongst the best I've eaten: big elbow pasta with crunchy cheese toast and fresh thyme crust. The Carrot and Parsnip Cake with Maple Ginger ice cream would be a fitting way to end a great meal at the restaurant.However, for a restaurant with tremendous potential, unfortunately luck, or rather timing, will play a major role in whether you have a 4 star experience or a 5 star one. The lucky number being the number of minutes it's been since the dish was cooked for I'm convinced that the fried chicken is not cooked to order (mine wasn't on any of my 3 visits) and the same is likely the case with the biscuits. The only dish that I found piping hot on each occasion was the Mac and Cheese.Beyond this operational trade-off between efficiency and customization, there are a few misses on the menu as well. The biggest disappointment I've had is with the visually arresting Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich that is the subject of much food blog chatter and yelp pix likes. To me, this has got to be the worst item on their menu for the (congealed) cheddar cheese waffle is doughy, lacks any crispness in texture while the whisky maple syrup reduces the fried chicken to a soggy mess glued together like a rubbery industrial good to the limp waffle. It's pretty to look at and a conversation starter, but terribly disappointing. Similarly, the Beet Sorbet in the Mississippi mud is intense, but the texture of the crust and chocolate torte will make you worry whether you just bit into an eggshell (hmm...). Not to mention, I've yet to drink a cocktail that I've liked despite trying the Bumble and Bone, Lady Ivory, and Blackberry Saddle (all visually appealing).I don't understand why at the end of the meal everyone is handed a bone (listing the damages to the wallet), but I don't find it as creepy as some other reviewers have. On the whole, Root and Bone may not be the most wallet friendly fried chicken place in Alphabet City, but it is likely the better one.",18,8,15,Atif I.,"New York, NY",177,642,1772
3.0,8/9/2014,"Finally had a chance to try Root and Bone today. I had read about the long waits so Kevin L. and I decided to show up right as they opened for dinner and snag some seats. We arrived around 5:20 and there were already a few parties waiting around outside, with more accumulating by the minute. There ended up being room for everyone though. In fact, up until 7ish when we left, the restaurant still had a few tables open, surprisingly.Root and Bone maintains a very rustic decor -- homey and welcoming. A quick look around revealed cabinets full of beautiful dinnerware and a nice, small open kitchen. We were famished and ordered a bunch of plates to share -- Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits, Half Bird w/ cheddar cheese waffles, mac+ cheese and waffle cut french fries. The biscuits were flaky and buttery. I peeled the layers apart to dip in the honey roasted chicken jus and benne seed that the dish came with -- delicious. My only gripe was that these came out barely warm.The chicken was delicious! A thin, crispy and flavorful skin encompassing some juicy meat. I expected more of a zing since I read that it is pickled lemon dusted but I didn't taste anything of the sort. Still solid fried chicken and definitely a must do. We added the cheddar cheese waffle for $7, and it came with 4 mini waffles. I was not a fan of these -- I found them to be too dry and bland. I was also expecting the cheddar cheese to be more incorporated into the waffle rather than melted on top. The cheese also started to solidify after a few minutes and looked very unappetizing. This definitely fell short for me. The waffle fries were insanely crispy and good. It came with this intense but tasty chunky remoulade that I happily double-dipped into with each fry. The mac and cheese was decent although not memorable. There was too much of the crunchy crust on top, about an inch worth! It would have been ok but I didn't like the texture or taste of it. For dessert, we had the Banana Cream and the Peach+Blackberry Tart. I enjoyed both. The banana cream came in a mason jar. It was a good consistency -- thick and creamy, with huge chunks of banana and honey graham throughout. There was also a sprinkle of mint that was very refreshing. The Peach+Blackberry Tart was a great summer dessert. The fruits were so fresh and the tart was nice and crumbly. I expected it to be sweeter since it was coated in brown sugar but that was not the case -- the sugar gave it a nice crunchy texture. This tart also came with thyme ice cream -- a first for me. So refreshing and it definitely worked with the tart but I don't think I could eat it alone.Overall, a decent meal. I'm not sure if it was memorable enough to warrant a return visit though.",14,0,4,Joanna N.,"New York, NY",848,415,2023
3.0,8/9/2014,"A few weeks after eating here, I forgot the details (whoops) but I do remember the excellent service, cocktails, and coma-inducing dishes. We started with delicious biscuits with drizzles of savory jus (to be blamed later for filling us up too early). I had the lamb and must say that it was the fattiest lamb I've ever had -- their star dish, but maybe needed a zing of acidity on the side to cut through all the fat and texture of the sweet potato leek gratin. My husband had the obligatory fried waffle and chicken sandwich. The cheese was already hardened (by its looks, it should've been melted?) and it seemed to be served kind of cold. Our waiter took our cues well enough to know we were ready for a doggy bag. The Twisted Mustache cocktail was robust with ginger, bourbon, and squeeze of citrus. Overall, we wish we could've saved more of our appetite for the main dishes because they really were delicious lunches the following day.",0,0,0,Ramona P.,"San Francisco, CA",42,93,92

The deviled eggs were tasty but a little on the soggy side (I couldn't pick up my half). The chicken jus served with the biscuits was a little too rich for my taste.

Nothing to complain about. But I did feel thirsty the rest of the night. The waffle fries were definitely too salty though - so much so that we asked them to take them back. Our waiter was super cool about it though so it wasn't a big deal. We got new (less salty) fries but by then we were already deep into fried chicken and fries were forgotten. Worth checking out.

5.0,8/5/2014,"This is my first Yelp review as I felt inspired to suggest this restaurant to others! This place is fantastic! A few friends and I were walking around the neighborhood on a Monday night looking for a quick bite and we were pleasantly surprised to find this gem. Bustling and busy, we were nervous there would be a long wait. The hostess was very kind and assured our party of four that if we ""stayed with her"" she would seat us right away. She followed through on her word and we were seated in minutes at the kitchen bar. We spoke to the chef about his preparation and the menu. He made excellent suggestions. The four of us split the half chicken, waffles, mac and cheese, and the shrimp and grits. ALL fantastic and plenty of food for four people. I was impressed by the intricate care performed to prepare and cook the food. Priced very reasonably, we left incredibly full and happy for around $30/person -  and each had a cocktail! We had a lovely waiter who brought us biscuits on the house - this may have been my favorite dish of the evening, especially dipped in the roast chicken sauce.

5.0,8/5/2014,"I've been eagerly anticipating the opening of this charming little restaurant for several reasons. First, I loved Yardbird in Miami so I was excited that Jeff McInnis is opening his own restaurant in NYC. Second, this place is only a couple blocks from my job. And then of course, there's been a lot of hype before they even opened.On their first week of opening I walked over to get some lunch. While I waited for my food I took a peek at the dining area. Its charms come from the adorable little details. I've yet to dine in but I'll be sure to do that for dinner in the future. In the meantime, I'm in love with the chicken and waffle sandwiches for lunch. The fried chicken is perfection! It comes sandwiched between 2 pillowy waffles along with pickled green tomatoes. Oh and of course, the maple syrup us spiked with bourbon. How can I resist? Originally they had more sandwiches for lunch but it seems like after the first couple weeks they decided to work with a smaller menu. In any case I'm definitely coming for dinner in the very near future.",1,0,0,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",227,1549,2438
4.0,8/2/2014,"My bf and I arrived at 5:35pm on a Sunday, and there was a line out the door (maybe 10 people or so). Luckily, as soon as we got in line, they started seating and we were able to grab a couple of seats with a view of Jeffrey McInnis in action. Sweet!We had the cornbread, southern peach caprese, shrimp & grits, half bucket of bird, and the Mississippi mud pie with cherry-beet sorbet. All of the dishes were solid. I think what sets the food here apart is the care in the layering of different flavors and textures. The caprese, for instance, has several different but cohesive levels of sweetness--from the fruity grilled peaches to the deep molasses in the vinegrette to the herbally basil. There was also a nice sharpness that cut through the sweetness in multiple ways with the green tomatoes, the molasses vinegar and the pimento cheese. Every ingredient seemed very considered and nothing overpowered another. The dish was really subtly balanced. The chicken btw was the juiciest fried chicken I have ever had, and it was--despite being fried--surprisingly light. My bf was not a big fan of the lemon powder but I think it worked well when combined with the Tabasco honey sauce.The mud pie was really good. Wished it was a tad bigger but maybe that's just my gluttony speaking--the two of us were nice and full at the end of the meal. But I wish the sorbet tasted of cherries a bit more. I tasted more beet than cherry.We definitely plan to come back--both to try more dishes in-house and maybe even some bucket of bird to-go!",0,0,0,Gen T.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,30,0
2.0,8/2/2014,"This place had big shoes to fill-- the wonderful Mama's owned by Jeremiah Clancy. Mama's was a homey, super friendly, chill neighborhood place to go get a great meal or take-out for not a lot of money. Best fried chicken in the city, hands down. Amazing staff of kids delivering take-out and serving up plates of home-style food. SORELY MISSED. So THIS place rolls up, and takes forever to open, building the anticipation. When my friend got there, they informed her she needed a reservation (ugh-- we don't need another one of THOSE in this hood) so she sat in the window seat and was entertained by the nearly empty restaurant's pin dropping symphony. When I arrived, we were hustled to this minuscule ""bar"" as our ""table."" Usually, if you're the kind of joint that NEEDS to take a reservation, you usually have the kind of customer service standards that would inspire ASKING if it's ok to be seated at the bar. Example-- we know you don't have a reservation, and as we are full, would you mind being seated at the bar? There was barely enough room on the surface of the bar to put a glass of water, let alone a meal, and quite frankly, I didn't want to sit on a barstool after working all day, and be knocked by waitstaff running in and out of the bar service area picking up drinks. Hate to break it to you, R&B-- the bar is not diner friendly. The bartender was busy making extremely complicated drinks (another UGH from me) but was super-duper personable and friendly. Of course when he took our order he tried a bit to upsell, but all I wanted to know is if their chicken was good. The mistake he made, and what the management should know is SUCH the wrong selling point-- he introduced the meatloaf as ""the dish the co-owners fell in love over."" Dude-- everyone knows this chef left his wife and one-year old baby for the other owner, who was on Top Chef-- it's all over the NY papers/blogs. DON'T use their ""romance"" as a way to sell food!!! It's gross! Our waffle sandwiches with fried chicken, bourbon syrup, greens and cheddar cheese (??) came. The chicken was dry, and the waffles were just simple ok-- mostly too soft, and too much, considering the tiny piece of chicken that was hiding inside. The cheddar cheese was gratuitous and really kind of gross with the syrup. With the exception of the super friendly bar-tender, I'm giving it a thumbs down and not going back. The East Village is not in need of another high-priced chicken joint. I miss Mama's.",0,0,0,Hazel Y.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0
5.0,7/30/2014,"Long review...MAKE SURE TO ORDER THE FRIED CHICKEN!Root & Bone is from two Top Chef alum (Jeff McInnis and Janine Booth) and has been blowing up my Instagram feed from fellow foodies posting drool-worthy pics of chicken and waffles!This spot doesn't take reservations, so we arrived right when it opened (11:30am-ish). When our server told us about the special Bourbon Bloody Mary I was ALL over it. When it arrived and I saw all the yummy garnishes (BACON! PICKLES! OLIVES!), I was even more stoked!The executive chef is known for fried chicken, so I knew I had to order it. There was simply nothing to think about. I got a half order of the Crispy Free-Range Chicken. It is sweet tea brined and served with pickled lemon dust and spiked Tabasco honey. I'm really not sure where to start. The chicken was delicious. Each bite was awesome. The skin was perfectly crisp, the meat was moist and the sweet tea brine was a wonderful complement to the salty skin. I love the taste combination of salty & sweet, so I was in HEAVEN!There is an option to add a cheddar cheese waffle and whiskey maple syrup. CLEARLY I did that. I was surprised when 4 mini waffles appeared instead of one large waffle. They were super cute! The cheese ended up hardening up and cooling down. I'm undecided on this presentation style - it was just congealed, not that sexy. I'd suggest that the cheese be shredded and integrated into the batter or turned more into a cheese sauce. I also read that the mac & cheese was super delicious, so we ordered a side. Naturally, it was huge. The mac is made with big elbow pasta, crunchy cheese toast and a fresh thyme crust. We loved it but hardly made a dent in it - eek!Lauren ordered the Southern Peach Caprese made with fried pimento cheese, grilled peaches, pickled green tomatoes, heirloom tomatoes, sticky molasses vinegar and basil. She loved it! I wanted no part of any sort of salad as I was elbow deep in CHICKEN N WAFFLES YO!When we got the check, it was rolled up in a bone.

5.0,7/29/2014,"A friend of mine from Florida recommended this place as they knew Chef Jeff personally.  It's a little off the beaten path from subways (we're in Chelsea) for us but the minute we walked in and read the menu, we knew we were in the right place.  Rarely do I find a place where I want to try every dish but this was definitely the case here.  We went on a Sunday for brunch around 12:30PM.  This was their 3rd week in business according to the hostess.  It was packed!  That said, we waited about 10 minutes and were sat in the back room. Talk about great waiting time.  That's a miracle in NYC.   In true NYC fashion, the seating was a bit tight but not uncomfortable.  I saw the guy next to me had a bloody mary with bacon in it.  Bacon?!?!  Had to get it and I'm not even a bloody mary kind of guy.  The service was excellent.  They came and checked in with us frequently.  Let's get to the food.We were having a dilemma with the fried chicken.  We didn't want a half or a full (as we wanted to try other dishes) but definitely had to try it as that is what they're known for.  We asked if we could just order 1 or 2 pieces.  No problem they said.  I got a drumstick and my wife got a thigh.  It comes served with a syrupy tabasco tasting syrupy sauce.  The chicken was off the hook!!!  It was so moist and falling off the bone.  I wish I would've gotten more of it.We then tried the caprese salad.  I don't know if was seasonal or not but the peaches were unbelievably good.  We were 2 for 2 so far and we hadn't even gotten to the main courses.I got the eggs benedict which was on top of a waffle instead of a muffin.  It had a little side salad and bacon as well.  The eggs benedict was up there as far as quality but not the best I've ever had.  The waffle was a good touch, however and kept it interesting. But being a bacon guy, that was total quality!  Thick and Juicy. Wish I would've ordered another side of it.The wife shared that with me because she wanted to try the ""Grits Made With Love"" as it's referred to on the menu.  It comes with bread crumbs, chives on top with pimento cheese.  It was a good dish.  I'm not a grits person but my wife loved it, though we both agreed we wouldn't mind trying a different dish next time.We tried the waffles for dessert.  It came with strawberries, granola, whip cream and syrup. This was the only real letdown of the whole meal. It was just OK. I probably wouldn't order them again.  The size of the waffles (they're minis) were fine for a dessert but not for a main course.  The taste was just OK.  Then came the price...$70 for both of us.  We thought this was so WORTH it!  In NYC, that's a bargain for that quality.  I've had a LOT worse for way MORE.  All in all, highly recommend this place.  One of the best brunch spots we've been to.  We look forward to coming back and trying some other dishes.",3,0,1,Brian B.,"Manhattan, NY",64,22,34

I arrived at around 10pm on a Saturday night and the wait was still an hour and a half. Good thing I wasn't hungry or I would've definitely left to go somewhere else real quick. All I really wanted to do was try the fried chicken so I decided to just order half the bird and have a taste while my bf can eat the rest. And that's what we did, it was ready in like 5 minutes. We took it outside right on their little bench and dug in. Honestly, I was pretty disappointed. Now, I'm not saying it was gross and disgusting or anything but the price is a little steep and it was nothing mind blowing. The batter was uneven and the flavors in the batter were just okay. And some of the pieces of chicken were pretty dry, which led us to go ask for some sauce and discovered the tobasco honey which saved the chicken even though it shouldn't need it.

Tuesday rolled around and I had not received a confirmation so I called them to confirm. No one picked up so I left a message. By that afternoon, I still hadn't received a call back, so I called again. I spoke with someone and told her my name time of the reservation and the # of people in the party. I said I was just calling to confirm and she said ""Yep"". Shame on me for taking this ""Yep"" as a ""yes, your reservation is confirmed"" Upon arrival I was told they did not have my reservation. At the same time a gentleman came out from the dining area with a raised voice about the confusion with seating for his party. He demanded that they move the people that they just put in his seats. Lastly, a person who came in right after me and allegedly had a reservation received the same response, that there was nothing on file for them either. I spoke with the manager and she was able to seat me and my guest at the bar in front of the kitchen within 20 minutes. Though I my chair was practically blocking the bathroom door. Luckily this did not become a disgusting situation but it certainly could have. Needless to say, they really need to work on their organization skills and their seating and reservation process.Okay, on to the good stuff! Both the food, and the speed at which is came out was fantastic and impressive given their other issues. We ordered the fried chicken (the whole bird), the cornbread, the waffles, and the mac and cheese. I have not a complaint about any of these foods, they were all excellent.The fried chicken was exactly as it is being described in other reviews, crispy and light but so juicy and delicious. I'm not a particular fan of dark meat so I would say that the legs were a little ""bleh"" but the chicken breasts were out of this world. The fried outside has a lemony thyme seasoning on it that is so refreshing. The cornbread which comes with a creamy spread and a rhubarb jam of some sort was also great. This came out first for us to nosh on. No complaints here.The waffles were 4 smaller but thick waffles covered in a slice of cheese (not sure what kind). They were accompanied by some kind of whiskey syrup that was really interesting and good. I didn't get too into the waffles because I had the corn bread.The mac and cheese was not warm enough when it came out, but they just sent it back for us and gave us a new one that was very hot. It was creamy but not too flavorful, I think this is okay given how the chicken really steals the show. It was topped with breadcrumbs which gave a nice crunch. Very thick and creamy.My friend ordered a Arnold Palmer but the waiter forgot about it. After she reminded him again he was more attentive and asked her if she wanted a refill.Overall I would say the food was delicious, the service worked out okay, and I would go back when they get their stuff together a bit more. I would like to try the dessert next time but we were too full! Please definitely go check them out if you love fried chicken, but you may want to wait a few more weeks until they settle.",0,0,0,Samantha M.,"Brooklyn, NY",119,32,9
5.0,7/18/2014,"Went for brunch.  Every bite of food was delicious.  Was hard to decide between the cornbread or the biscuits, went with the biscuits with chicken jus and did not regret it.  The fried chicken (thigh & leg) was the best I have had. I loved the Waffle Benedict. Shrimp & Grits were just as good as expected, since that is what I remember Jeffrey for most on Top Chef. I will definitely be going back for dinner.

4.0,7/18/2014,"I am a huge fan of Yardbird in Miami so I was really excited to try Root & Bone. Overall, I was very pleased with my experience. My friends and I shared the following: biscuits, 1/2 bucket of fried chicken, deviled eggs, mac and cheese, meat loaf, peach caprese salad and Mississippi mud for dessert. I also had the blackberry saddle cocktail.Favorites: the biscuits were sooo good, especially with the chicken jus, thyme and sea salt. I also loved the deviled eggs. So pretty to look at and even more delicious. Last but certainly not least, the fried chicken with spiked Tabasco honey is a must. Without the honey, the chicken is moist and flavorful but with the honey, it's on another level.The mac and cheese was good, especially the crust, but I wasn't blown away. Same for the peach caprese salad, though the pickled green tomato in the salad was phenomenal. The meat loaf, while tasty, was my least favorite but then again, I'm not a meat loaf person. I thought the dessert was a very interesting combination of flavors. My friends didn't like the beet sorbet but I really enjoyed it. And lastly, my cocktail was very well balanced and great for slow sipping. The restaurant itself is so cute and the service was great.

Anyway around 5:25 chef jeff let met in and was super kind and friendly, as was everyone else from the staff. First let me say that I don't love fried chicken. Not that I don't like it, it's just not something I usually order. However the chicken and waffle sandwich was amazing. So many different flavor combos going on. I can't wait to go back and try the bucket of fried chicken. The Mac and cheese was not my style. I felt the top was a little salty and the inside a little soupy. However the cornbread, which was delicious, paired with the Mac and cheese worked perfectly. The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the waffle fries. They were under done and the bacon on them didn't have much flavor. I was seriously stuffed after all this (yes, I shared a little) so I got a coconut cake to go. Of course as soon add I got home I needed to try it and it's lemony and coconuty and heavenly. Can't wait to go back and try the brunch!",5,1,1,Jessica H.,"Manhattan, NY",348,331,55

However, they were able to seat us nevertheless!HALF BIRD (4pcs)--BEST FRIED CHICKEN I'VE HAD IN THE CITY. Definitely the STAR of our meal. It's hard to describe the taste but on their website it says ""SWEET TEA BRINED and PICKLED LEMON DUSTED"". Don't be scared by the light dusting of pickled lemon! It's different but adds a UNIQUE TWIST. The taste of the chicken is just SO UNIQUE and NOT LIKE ANY OTHER FRIED CHICKEN JOINT I've tried. The meat was so GODDAMN TENDER and JUICY and the skin didn't just flop off the meat. The SKIN was so DELICIOUS!! MUST GET MUST GET MUST GET and DIP IN THE TABASCO HONEY SAUCE OMG MAC 'N CHEESE--SOLID staple. They use CORKSCREW pasta and upon first bite, it's CREAMY, dry, and CRUNCHY (from the thyme crust). Cheesy but NOT BEYOND CHEESY. WAFFLE CUT FRENCH FRIES--Nice touch with the dill pickle salt. Could use a heavier hand on the seasoning though. ROOT--We probably could've DONE WITHOUT this side. The MEDLEY of VEGETABLES were soft and tasty but the pesto was just alright. The rice was undercooked and gave the already dry pesto a weird consistency. Decor was so adorable. Plant terrariums, dusty white woodwork, and white/light grey/earth colors gave the dining room a very rustic yet modern feel. Our server was an absolute darling.

2.0,7/16/2014,"My wife and I are huge fans of the owners having been to the Yardbird Miami restaurant they came from. Sadly the food was a great disappointment. We had been following the opening of Root and Bone for months because we loved the food at Yardbird, so I guess our expectations are a little high.   It's not that the food was bad. It was good. Not great or even very good. Just good. I got the fried chicken which had a breading that had no flavor and the chicken itself had no seasoning to it. The waffle fries were way over salted. As a matter of fact, since we were seated at the bar by the kitchen, we could see all the cooks who were constantly flinging salt on everything.  My wife ordered the Chicken & waffle sliders which is big enough and dense enough for a meal for one person. The waffles were tasty enough and the chicken was okay. No complaints but no fireworks.  We had started with the biscuits.. ""Everyone has to try the biscuits!"" our cook told us. Sadly, they were very dense and dry. Twice as much gravy would have helped. We also had the peach salad. that was just dull.  Finally, there was the Meatloaf. I had ordered it to go when we ordered the rest because there were so many things I wanted to try. It looked great coming out of the kitchen but it was very dense when we ate it. just a half teaspoon of gravy on top that couldn't spread over the entire thing. Not enough vegetables on the side to justify the price. $21.00.   There were other things we wanted to come back and try, until after we had the food and paid. Walking away, my wife turned to me and said ""We don't have to come back here. I kind of thought it would be like the other place. The food wasn't what I had hoped."" I agreed, especially since we ordered so many things and ran up a hefty bill. I'd say it was worth what we spent if it had been close to what we had expected. But it wasn't close. Not nearly.I have nothing scathing to say about the place. It's not a bad place.I wouldn't eat there again, but it's not bad. the service was fine, I guess, but the food was unspectacular. Fried chicken should have flavor. Not just salt. Food shouldn't be so dense.So far, the best fried chicken is Sidecar in Brooklyn. If it's chicken and Waffles you want, try Sweet Chick in Williamsburg. The only Meatloaf I know that is good is the Meatloaf Sliders at Backyard in Brooklyn.If you get a chance to go to Yardbird in Miami, you are in for a treat.

4.0,7/15/2014,"I had been waiting for a while for Root & Bone to open, and I finally went with some friends. Twice in one weekend, actually. That might be a bit excessive, but who cares? I'm a big Top Chef fan, and I was eager to try a meal created and assembled by 2 Top Chef contestants, Jeff McInnis and Janine Booth. The decor reminds you of an old school Southern dining room, with little pockets of flowers strewn across the walls. The service was very attentive and friendly. We even got to chat it up a little bit with Jeff when we were there for brunch. Also, fact: Janine is a stone cold fox. I had the opportunity to try the biscuit basket with gravy, blue crab waldorf, bucket of bird, waffle and chicken sandwich, and the mac & cheese. The biscuits and gravy were very dense and had a great chew/texture to them, and the gravy was very great. The blue crab waldorf salad was very well done, and had the right amount of acidity from the apples and grapes. The bucket of bird was outrageously good. The fried, lemony skin was just unreal, and the meat was moist, tender and juicy. The mac and cheese was creamy and delicious, and the large buttered bread crumbs added a great crunch to the dish. The only dish that was a little disappointing was the chicken and waffle sandwich. The waffle was very soft, cold and had no crispiness to it, which is something I prefer. There was also no cheese on it which was really disappointing. We told Jeff and he was very apologetic, and he offered to make another batch, but we were already full. However, the green tomato was a great touch, and the fried chicken, as usual, was outstanding.In the first few months, Root & Bone has run out of reservations and won't be taking anymore for a while, so you probably shouldn't even try for now. Instead, you'll have to get there early and try to snag one of the seats at the counter, usually 11:15 for brunch on weekends, or at 5:15 for dinner. I think given the demand, they should just get rid of reservations altogether, but that's just my opinion. They also have a small shop, called Little Roort, adjacent to the restaurant that sells treats and fried chicken, if you aren't lucky enough to snag a reservation or a walk-in seat. I'll be back for that chicken. I highly recommend you sit at the counter if you get a chance, so you can see everything going on in the kitchen, and get a chance to talk to the chefs.",6,1,2,Eric J.,"New York, NY",490,923,1792
4.0,7/14/2014,"2 hour wait for 2 ppl 6:30pm on a Friday night. Was seated within 45 minutes. Since it's a new restaurant, it has horrible reservation/table management. I came at 630 and I saw that the whole dining room was empty. was seated around 7 and still the whole dining ro was empty. Left around 8 and half the dining room was empty. I could see why some people who were waiting to be seated were frustrated. Now for the food - Not worth the hype, but good regardless. 4/5 for the Fried Chicken. I honestly came here purely for the chicken. Skin wasn't crispy for some reason (it was soggy), which was awful, but the meat was flavorful and the skin was delicious. But I wouldn't come back for it. Clinton st bakery has better fried chicken. 4.5/5 for waffles. A little salty but man was it good. Melted cheese and delicious waffle. Small hut jam packed with flavor. Other dishes are not worth ordering. I don't remember the name of the salad but it wasn't good. Blue crab appetizer was whatever.

We got a basket of fried chicken (a whole bird is WAY too much for two people), the cheddar waffles (tasty but which they were crispier on the outside), salad, and the deviled eggs (delish). My one constructive point is that the hot sauce and maple syrup shouldn't be premixed together. Not everyone likes that much sugar on their chicken!

5.0,7/11/2014,"Aside from all of the hype on the food blogs and such, I knew I had to come here once I heard it was from the same chef that runs the amazing Yardbird in Miami, where I had an unforgettable meal a few years ago.Even with these high expectations, I was not disappointed at all, and ended up having yet another incredible meal from Jeff McInnis. I knew we were in for a good time when we got the warning from our friendly waitress that we ordered way too much food, which we went ahead with anyway:- Southern Style Cornbread ($6)This was great, and the beginning of the deliciously salty foods that dominated the meal. The 4 squares of soft, fluffy cornbread were topped with coarse salt, and served alongside clotted cream and beet jam. Much moister and less crumbly than typical cornbread, this was a great choice to start and was delicious along with the very different beet flavor from the jam.- Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwich ($14 for 2)This is the thing everybody seems to be talking about and Instagramming here, but it actually wasn't as good as the rest of the stuff. It is a beautiful little sandwich, impressively tall and very nicely presented, and is quite delicious, but if you are going to eat fried chicken, you should stick to the regular entree one instead. This one has a juicy piece of dark meat, a thick cut green tomato, and really soft, fluffy waffles as the bread. It's definitely still worth trying, but there's so much other great stuff that may be better.- Mac & Cheese ($7)This was a really excellent, cheesy bowl of piping hot Mac & Cheese. The crumbled cheese toast and thyme crust on top added a very nice crunch to the gooey, large noodles. This is a definite must as a side dish.- Waffle Cut French Fries ($5) with Gooey Cheese Sauce & Bacon ($1)Yet another must from this can't miss menu, these were incredible. As if waffle fries weren't awesome enough, you just have to pay a measly dollar bone to get some delicious ""gooey cheese sauce"" and bacon to top it all off. I sometimes balk at this option, as a sloppy drizzling of cheese can render the whole batch of fries soggy and unrecognizable, but it was done very sparingly and perfectly here. They actually went with even more bacon than I expected, which was a welcome addition, making this possibly an even better side than the Mac & Cheese.- Braised Short Rib Meat Loaf ($21)This was awesome. Not really a meat loaf so much as it was two giant slabs of ridiculously soft short rib, it was actually not even expensive given how much quality meat you get. This is one of their popular entrees and it's really easy to see why.- Crispy Free Range Bucket of Bird ($16 for half a bird)I know I said a lot of stuff here is a must, but this is what you truly must order here, otherwise you will have failed miserably and you should go right back for another meal. Our waitress actually used to work at Yardbird in Miami, and told us the fried chicken here was even better than the good stuff at his first restaurant, and she was completely right. This was truly some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. The skin was impossibly moist and crispy at the same time, and was so incredibly packed with flavor from the lemon seasoning and brine. You get 4 pieces: a breast, a thigh, a wing and a drumstick. I usually only really like white the most, but all of these pieces were addictive. Too good.- Mississippi Mud Pie with Beet Gelato ($9)We went with 2 of the 3 available desserts, and both were just as good as all of the food we just stuffed ourselves with. This little slice of mud pie packed so much flavor and richness. It was incredibly chocolatey and dense and went very well with the refreshing beet gelato.- Parsnip Carrot Cake ($9)This one may have been even better than the mud pie. The delicious Maple Ice Cream and the cake were a perfect combo. The cake was really sweet, with dense cake and a delicious creamy frosting layer in between and on top. It's hard to choose as both desserts were excellent.Be warned - they pretty much aren't accepting any walk-ins, other than for the few counter seats against the windows and a few seats by the bar in the small back room. I called and they said they were booked solid for dinner for the entire month of July, and even when we got there a few minutes after opening at 5:30 PM, we were just barely able to snag the last two seats at the bar.They also have a little spot to the left of the entrance called Little Root, which offers some of their menu for takeout, as well as drinks and some sweets, including cakes and Chocolate Chip Cookies and Rice Krispie Treats ($2 each). The cookie and treat weren't great, so stick to the cakes for a good dessert if you want something to go.Make reservations now or get there early to grab a counter seat - you will not be disappointed and will be lucky to try some of the best fried chicken ever and one of the best new restaurants of the yea",42,12,18,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1694,69834
5.0,7/11/2014,"I've never had better fried chicken. It's cooked to perfect, but how it's seasoned, through-and-through, is what really wins me over most. The sweet tea brine gives it a particular herbaceousness that accentuates but never interferes with the meat, and the lemon dusting on the skin is really what puts it over the top in awesomeness. Zesty, sumptuous, mouth-wateringly addictive. It's not cheap, but it's worth the cost. It's not close to my apartment, but it's worth the trek.

Rest of staff constantly smiling and offering recommendations. As for the food, one of the rare occasions where everything ordered off the menu is SO on point. We started with shrimp and grits: amazing with a healthy portion of shrimp. Must try for those that haven't had shrimp & grits (or those that have and love them). The fried pimento cheese/basil/green tomato/grilled peach salad was creative and refreshing. And then... THE FRIED CHICKEN. Brined in sweet tea with dehydrated lemons infused into the skin. What. Do not come here and skip on this. Simply...mind blowing. Chef Jeff informs us this is Chef Janine's genius creation. Never had anything like it and woke up this morning wanting more.

I found the waffles a little too spongy. I can see how one yelper said they were soggy when he got take-out. They arrive very steamy and puffy at the table; I don't imagine they travel well. Next time, I'm gonna try the mac&cheese, which looked amazing.   They had 2 salads on the menu, and we got one of each. Delicious, but not big enough to share. The sweet tea-brined chicken was indeed very good, but it won't change your life.

The fried chicken, which I was concerned about being too heavy for consumption on a warm summer day, is beyond-words-insane--not at all heavy, served with a super tasty hot sauce. The waffles are cooked to perfection, and the whiskey maple syrup is the perfect accompaniment. The service from our waiters was somewhat spotty, but was ultimately redeemed when a friend of the proprietors' brought out the food and explained what each dish was. They clearly take a lot of pride in their dishes and food, and offer a nice familial ambience...we were there on the weekend during the early dinner rush, and the place had families coming in and out. The feeling of family was felt even moreso when I watched a really nice exchange between one of the proprietors, who was in the kitchen, come out and embrace a friend who had come to offer her congratulations.

5.0,7/7/2014,"I took my family to Root and Bone yesterday and truly enjoyed every aspect of our experience. We sat at the bar and watched Jeff and Janine put beautiful creations together. It's so important to have great chemistry and flow in an operation and these two have it. I ordered just about everything on the menu and was really impressed with the flavors, presentation and execution of everything. We ordered the fried chicken which was beautifully brined, crispy and bright. The lemon flavors throughout every crispy bite was very refreshing and kept you wanting more. The Peach Caprese was very thoughtful and delicious. I love the play on a Classic Italian salad that was turned southern by the pickled green tomato slice complimented by the beautifully dressed greens and Pimento Cheese Fritter.  Next the watermelon cheese and ham. #Ridiculous. Mac n Cheese #money. Deviled Eggs were gorgeous. 3 perfect little bites with a little purple color from beet juice made this not only eye appealing but the flavors were stunning.  The crispy waffles with Cheddar and Maple Hot Sauce were awesome. What can I saw about the Meatloaf other than this is perfect for the Gluten Allergic folks due to the method that it's made. Perfectly cooked short ribs, shredded, seasoned then seared until crispy paired with parsnip purée, roasted heirloom carrots, grilled onions and tomato ketchup jam. #omg #amazing. Shrimp and grits were heavenly. Coarse ground local grits perfectly cooked the only way a southerner would know how to cook them. #lotsoflove. The shrimp were perfectly cooked by Janine personally and seasoned to perfection. I enjoyed seeing her kill it on last chance kitchen of Top Chef New Orleans. Every bit of care, love and passion was tasted in every bite. Now on to desserts. Carrot Parsnip Cake was perfectly moist with a slight twang from the cream cheese icing. The banana cream pie served in the little mason jar was just awesome. Then the Everything but the kitchen sink Sundae was just stupid good. Little bites of yum was carefully crafted. This was simple an amazing start for Root & Bone. I loved the decor of the entire space. Old with the new. Old fashioned plates reminded me of my Grandmothers house in St Augustine with flavors to match from the old south.

4.0,7/3/2014,"Root and Bone - the name of the restaurant alludes to fresh produce and meat and that's exactly what is offered in their dishes. Add in a dash of creativity, lovely Southern charm, and the work of two former Top Chef contestants, and you have yourself quite a winning restaurant.The interior looks a bit like an open cottage with muted grays and browns; splashes of color can be found in the hanging terrariums, tiny flowers on the wall, mismatched plates at each table, and in the food itself. The larger room even has a large china cabinet and it's exactly that cozy, open feel that really brings out the restaurant's farm-to-table quality.The fried chicken n' waffle sandwich (named ""Avenue A"" on the lunch menu) was really quite divine. Two small round sandwiches came per order, and the buns were replaced with soft cheddar waffles. I was expecting a bit of a crisp edge to the waffles, but they were instead soft; they surprisingly held the large chunks of fried chicken well. The chicken pieces were prepared in a maple whiskey brine and were SO juicy. The bright pickled green tomato slices and bits of watercress were nice accents and balanced out the sandwiches, preventing them from becoming overbearingly sweet and heavy.The jazzed (tarred??...the menu's font was hard to read) feathered fried chicken sandwich (named ""Avenue B"" on the lunch menu) had the same juicy fried chicken, but it was spiked with Tabasco for a real kick. The sandwich also came with bacon, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and potato rolls, but the greatest part was the buttermilk ranch sauce. Or so I'm told. J liked this sandwich so much that he devoured it before I could steal a bite. We also ordered a side of Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits (gosh, look at that name!) which were served with honey butter and peach preserves. Three squarish biscuits came per order. The spreads were good, but the biscuits themselves were a bit dry. This was the only negative note from the meal.  Root and Bone also offers twelve different cocktails and a wine list that leans toward American and Australian wines. If all of the cocktails sound great, it's most likely because they are. If you have difficulty picking, try the Filthy Manahttan! The ratio of whiskey, port, and bitters was fantastic. The amarena cherries left at the bottom of the glass were so boozily decadent. Likelihood of another visit:There are so many other menu items I'd love to try: peach caprese, the ""BLT that will tickle you pickle"", the short rib meatloaf, and the waffle benedict to name a few. There is an adjacent market, the Little Root Market, that sells its buckets of fried chicken and sandwiches to go and I think it's a convenient stop for a quick lunch if you're in Alphabet City.",26,12,21,Maki Y.,"New York, NY",288,244,358
4.0,7/2/2014,"Will update this review once I get a chance to eat at the restaurant. Had some carryout today and it was delicious. Fried chicken waffle sandwiches were quite good, with flavorful chicken and just enough sweetness from the maple syrup. Mac & Cheese was also great, super cheesy and had a nice crunch from the breadcrumbs.Only reason I am not giving 5 stars is the fact that I arrived right when they said my food would be ready, but the waffles were already a tad soggy.",0,0,0,Andrew G.,"New York, NY",320,125,9
5.0,7/1/2014,EXCELLENT southern food in alphabet city! Had an exceptional lunch today with fried chicken and biscuits. The honey was my favorite part of dish with an added kick of spice - but just the right amount to garnish the biscuit. Well priced and served the correct portion. Literally finger licking good,1,0,0,Julie K.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",3,6,1
