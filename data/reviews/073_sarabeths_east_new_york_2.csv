1.0,4/27/2019,"I was surprised how bad the food was considering how popular Sarabeth's is, not much different than diner food but twice the price for everything.  For example, I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and they just tasted like regular pancakes.  They were thick and doughy and not very good.  Go to Serafina and have their lemon ricotta pancakes and compare it to Sarabeth's and you will see how bad the Sarabeth version is.  Serafina's lemon ricotta pancakes are super light and fluffy and they melt in your mouth with a distinct lemon and ricotta flavor.  There is a world of difference, and it made me realize how mediocre Sarabeth's is.  The brand is popular but the food doesn't live up to it.",0,0,0,K C.,"New York, NY",14,182,1

4.0,4/14/2019,Can't speak for the food as I've only ever been here for dessert. Highly recommend as a upscale place to come for dessert. Both the raspberry bread pudding and the chocolate souffle were very good. Would avoid the cookies. A little too hard and crunch for my taste.

3.0,4/12/2019,"Came on a Thursday morning (11am-ish) and was seated immediately (party of 3). Larger groups were waiting but if you're a party of 2, 3 or 4 there's not much of a wait (on a Thursday). There's also a little counter up front so solo dining too! Cute ambiance and I can tell there were mix of tourists and locals. We were seated in the back part of the restaurant. The tables are fairly close in proximity from each other but I didn't feel uncomfortable or anything. We were greeted immediately by our server. And got coffees (free refills) and water on tap (still and sparkling available as well). I think our server was tired that day. Didn't smile much and heard him sigh a big sigh in passing.lol. I ordered the short rib hash. Which was good and flavorful but not falling off of my seat amazing. My favorite honestly was the toast that came with it (it had poppy seed in it! Mmmmmmm) and the orange marmalade. Oh my goodness. So so good!!! I may go back just to have that (or buy it). That's how much I enjoyed it! They also have strawberry jam which is good too but the marmalade got my heart. One sucky part was that our server never asked what we wanted for our carb (that comes with each entree). On the menu it states you get a choice of toast, croissant or muffin. Our server took or order and left without asking so we thought maybe it changed? Toast came out as default. Which was fine because it was delicious but we heard him asking and giving options to every other table he was serving surrounding us. I was just bummed that we weren't given that option. Heads up, your server may ask if you want fries, sausage or bacon on the side. It doesn't come with the dish! It's an extra $11+ you'll pay. On a happy note: our coffees were never empty! Wish it was served nice a hot every time though. Cute place to take a visitor before or after a Central Park stroll. Like I said, I personally will prob come back mainly for the marmalade and bread.lol.",0,0,0,Risa S.,"New York, NY",4,211,420

Came back for breakfast.  The lemon ricotta pancakes sound dreamy - but really were just pancakes. The lemon was soooooo subtle it could easily be missed.  Side of bacon was huge - who needs 7 slices of bacon?  Such a waste. Short rib hash was way under seasoned.  Croissant was delicious.

Stop in for an upscale brunch!Food (5/5): I had the popeye eggs, that came scrambled (silky and well-seasoned) atop some ham, spinach, and english muffins, with a side of tomato salad. Very fresh and delicious! I would recommend this dish, though it was expensive (~$16-17).Atmosphere (5/5): Beautiful, adorned and with soft lighting. We were seated right by the window and looked onto the street (a personal favorite of mine during the morning hours). Service is great, with polite and prompt re-filling of water and recommendations.Uniqueness (3/5): Lobster eggs benedict and other unique pairings make this a fun place to eat. Seemed like quite a few 'regulars' frequent this locale.Value (2/5): Pricey. Luckily, I ordered the dish with the most amount of food, but every other dish seemed to skimp out on quantity.

In the answer I was told that there were no substitutions. I am not a fan of the word, ""No."" I have to admit that the root vegetables were good. The Octopus was also tasty. When it came time to pay, I used cash. After waiting too long, I finally asked for the change. I would never have received my change if I had never asked.

You had to beg for someone to bring you a drink or a check. Once you begged, you waited 10 minutes for anything to show up. Also, the dining room was so loud I could not hear my fiancé across the table. We were also seated in the middle of the room about 1 foot from 2 women practically shouting at each other.

Unfortunately, I found it extremely underwhelming. I had the Lemon Ricotta pancakes. They were lovely, but not worth $21. The portion was large - five pancakes in total, and yet the condiments they provided didn't seem enough for five. The pancakes were slightly thick and heavy, and I struggled to get past three. The servers were all nice and friendly, but the tables were all set so close to each other that i just felt uncomfortable and rushed to eat.With coffee, I ended up spending $30 on breakfast.

4.0,9/17/2018,"4/5! This place had a really great interior / vibe. It's a very classic breakfast joint. Food: 4/5.I had an amazing eggs Benedict but was a bit disappointed with the short rib scramble that needed to have more flavor. The Benny, though, was phenomenal. The English muffin was spongy, and absorbed all of the yolk / sauce well and made for a super well balanced bite. Atmosphere / service: 4/5. Good service, however we had a meal that was forgotten about, but that happens. Over all good, though, even for a large group (9 without notice early in the morning). Price to experience ratio: 3.5/5. I thought the place was pretty pricey for what you were getting (especially the short rib) and the coffee was overpriced at $5 a cup, but I guess this is NYC.

The watermelon salad was a real highlight, where the fish was not a stand out and the coconut ice cream used in the brownie sundae was a bit odd. However, I want to congratulate the staff on how well they handled some difficult patrons seated on both sides of me--classic UES ""ladies who lunch"" types who were extraordinarily demanding and kept the staff on their toes.

3.0,6/8/2018,"Three things establish whether a restaurant is good or not good. The quality of the food, obviously, is number one. Here, Sarabeth's did well. My Caesar salad was crisp and the dressing was savory and well portioned - the lettuce and croutons did not drown. Our guests had an omelet, club sandwich and yogurt with granola. Well, actually, it was granola with a dollop of yogurt, but the cheerful staff was happy to remedy that with additional yogurt brought to the table. All of these were very good, according to the guests. The second element is the staff and, as noted, Sarabeth's crew was polite and responsive. No issues here. We were well-served on a busy day. The third element is ambiance. Now, granted, this is mostly a lunch establishment so no one should expect candles and soft music, but the noise level was really very high. I invite the owner to sit in the loft section on a busy afternoon and just listen to the noise. Please hang some wall coverings or do something to tamp down the volume. The noise really did hamper what was otherwise a tasty lunch, well-served.

I was literally the first person in the restaurant, yet somehow even though we ordered about 10 minutes after sitting down, our food came significantly behind several people who had more complicated orders,  and who ordered after us. The server was overly chatty with other employees even after she told us she was going to check on our food.

1.0,5/23/2018,"My family and I were visiting NYC from Toronto. Our hotel was in Brooklyn, and we drove an hour and a half to Sarabeth's for brunch on a Saturday. Once my turn came in line, the hostess asked for my name and said to come back in 30 minutes. No problem - we obviously knew there would be a wait. We came back inside after 25 minutes and the hostess told me she gave our table to someone else after calling my name in the extremely packed waiting area, even though I told her we would leave and come back, AND she didn't take down my phone number! She said it would be another 10 minute wait, so we opted to stay INSIDE the restaurant. After 10 minutes I went back up to her, and she looked panicked, admitting our table was given away again (still didn't take my number nor call my name) and it would be an additional TWENTY minute wait. I requested the manager (I've done this many times to compliment service, but this was a first for negative comments) to politely explain how terrible of a system this was, and that a restaurant with MULTIPLE locations should know how to deal with a Saturday brunch crowd. I was patient and understanding in my comment. The manager's response was, ""Well it's pouring rain outside and there's nothing else to eat in this area. We have a table of 4 ready for you, so you might as well take it and eat here."" Are you kidding me? What kind of condescending response is that? I told her there was no way we were spending our money here, and left. Highly unprofessional team and terrible experience - wouldn't recommend this spot to anyone. I've never written a bad review, but this was infuriating considering the complete lack of attention or care.

4.0,5/16/2018,"I came here with a party of 5 for dinner after visiting a museum nearby. We called before coming and were told that the wait would be around 30 mins. We got there within 10 mins and waited another 10 mins and they were able to get us seated pretty quickly. I was happy that we did not have to wait the full 30. I am a little confused with Sarabeth's vibe. The dining area and menus looked to be a little bit upscale, but the waiting area and front display of desserts looked pretty causal. I did liked the decors in the dining area and found the ambiance to be very relaxing. Our waiter was super professional and nice. He answered all our questions and made our experience here super pleasant. For appetizer, we all shared the chips with crab guacamole. I have never seen crab meat in guacamole before and was quite intrigued. The dish turned out to be delicious and they gave us a lot of crab meat. For my main course, I went with the crab spaghetti and it tasted delicious. Again, they gave a lot of crab meat in this dish. I was a little disappointed because they did not have red pepper flakes, but I got over it. One thing that I'm not sure of is that some of the crab pieces in the spaghetti actually tasted like fish. They had a more dense texture versus the more fluffy and light texture of crab meat. Despite this, the dish still tasted great. The other people in my party tried the filet mignon and they had great things to say about it. Someone also tried the cheesecake for desserts and she said it was too sweet. I did not have any desserts asI could not even finish the spaghetti. Overall, I think Sarabeth's is a close to solid restaurant.

4.0,2/18/2018,"This restaurant is a little upscale.  We came in here for a late brunch on Sunday and the waitress came by the table and then as we were ordering - disappeared.  No not like a magician, she didn't David copperfield us, she walked off.  It's ok though because - like I told my wife, if you love them let them go, I knew she would be back....Anyhow- the interior of this place is really warm and cozy- no seriously, warm isn't a metaphor, it is actually pretty hot compared to the frigid slushy arctic weather outside.   Definitely good atmosphere in here.The food came out and was well played and definitely photographed well, however great photos don't always indicate great flavor do they???The spinach and goat cheese omelette was a little bland and could have used salt and definitely a little pepper.  The spinach itself was not properly drained making it a bit soggy too.   Friends, it might sound like I am being an over critical douche buuuut at almost 20$ for 3 eggs and some goat cheese, why the hell not.The food came and we didn't hear from our server until it was check time.  Another sign this place is riding off its reputation earned in years when there was a more stringent adherence to good customer service.   Pretty lame for this price point .   We also had French toast and avocado toast- both of which were very very good, perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing???  For the omelette and the super sorry service I am giving this place 4 stars which is really a little more than they deserve, but guys- the potential is there.   With the right staff this place could be a 10.  (Err 5 because this is yelp)I can't wait to give this place 5 stars, I want to in my soul, they just fell short this time.  I will be back Sarabeth's!!!",2,0,2,Markos K.,"Jacksonville, FL",182,201,1913

Upon arriving and I was seated immediately by the window. This was my second time at this location. The waiter came immediately and took my order and told him I want coffee. I waited almost 15 minutes for my coffee, I was a little bit wet from running under the rain and was expecting a hot coffee immediately. A family came in a few minutes later after I was seated and sat at the right table next to me. Finally my coffee came and the family next to me already ordered. I thought it was because they starting to get busy and I forgot about the wait. My ordered came the same time as the family next to me. My coffee was empty and saw the waiter refilling the family coffee next to me and thought his gonna filled my cup too. No! He didn't even asked or looked my way to see if my cup is empty. I began eating my breakfast and try not to think about it. I saw how immediately they provide service to the table next to me but seems to forget me sitting there. The other table on my left, were being served immediately. They kept checking up on them and I felt invisible sat there by myself. As soon as I finished eating, the waiter came around and asked if I want another coffee, I said yes politely and thanking him all the time. He came back and I told him to bring the check, he brought the check and I gave him my card. When he left with my card, I stood up and went to the bathroom. As soon as I came back, I saw my coat being removed and my table was moved too. I wasn't ready to live and it seems like they want me out of there immediately. The waiters moving the tables because a big group was came in and they put my check on the table behind. I signed my receipt and still gave them 20% tips. I was shocked how they made me feel like I don't belong in there. It is not the feeling I want to experience in my lifetime and it was the first time I experience from this so called top notch.

1.0,1/28/2018,"I have always thought of this establishment as a top notch place for brunch.  The result of this assumption was to take my girlfriend here for her birthday brunch.  It was intended to be a special day where her and I went out for a nice brunch, then later attend an equally nice dinner.  Upon arriving we were told there was a 20 minute wait, which was expected.  After twenty five minutes of perusing Madison Avenue we ventured back to the restaurant.  Not only did they seat people that came in after we did, upon returning after twenty minutes, but had us wait even longer as several double tables were not only set, but vacant.  After waiting even longer we finally were seated at one of the several available tables (mind you we were only two people).   After finally being seated, it took longer to get a glass of water than the people who were seated more expeditiously than the prior half hour we had waited, not to mention the fact that one of the duo present was celebrating her birthday.  I wanted to bring my girlfriend to Sarabeth's because she had never been there, and in my past experience, the service and food was always exquisite.  I was extremely disappointed with the service.  The food was delicious, however it was a major effort to get tap water poured, ordering the food, even getting the check.  The dining experience was extremely disappointing, considering upon giving the hostess the name and specifying that it was a birthday brunch.  I have always held this restaurant in the highest regards for a brunch, but I will never overpay for food when the service is atrocious.  If you charge over twenty dollars for pancakes, maybe come see if we even like the food? Maybe if it's a birthday give someone a free coffee or pastry? However, don't make that party wait longer than a walk in, then not even acknowledge the fact that it was a brunch for someone's birthday.  Truly disappointing.  Especially after going out for dinner (on the same day) at a restaurant less expensive, with a much more attentive staff, and even better food.          I never write reviews for any place I go, however I felt it imperative that I write this because that is how unsatisfactory the experience was.  The fact that I took the  time to write this review, when I never write reviews, that this Sarabeth's has made a wrong that cannot be made right, since one cannot relive a day.",2,0,0,Cameron H.,"East Quogue, NY",10,6,0

The carpets and upholsteries clearly have not been dusted in several decades. This, however, is not the restaurant's main problem.That brings us to the food. I visited here with my mother and boyfriend. While both my mother and I were deciding between several dishes, the waiter directed us to fettuccine and meatballs, saying it was the best pasta on the menu. We both ordered it at his recommendation. What we were given was by far the worst pasta dish I have eaten in several years. The pasta was soggy and flavorless. The sauce was more like squashed tomatoes than a proper sauce. When I requested more sauce they said that was not possible. When I requested crushed red pepper flakes, I was told there was nothing of the sort. The meatballs were puny and pathetic--hardly the panko-crusted fare promised on the menu.Third, the service. All of this may not have been so bad had our waiter been attentive. He hardly checked in at our table. To be fair, it was a Sunday night and the room was full, but not full enough to merit the mere 5 times he came to our table.  When we complained about our food, he offered a complementary dessert. At that point, no one was interested in eating anything more from their kitchen. When we declined, he apologized and walked away. He left his poor busboy to handle us. My mother and I nearly gave the busboy what tip we were going to leave. Poor man.

I was a little shocked with the answer ""I think it is..."" when one has a gluten allergy that simply is unacceptable. He ended up having to go check with the chef and came back about 30 minutes later with an answer. It was frustrating. She ended up ordering the Apple Chicken Sausage and the Oatmeal (both gluten free). The other lady ordered the Kale Salad with Egg. She enjoyed it, but I wouldn't say she was thrilled!

Tomatoes were chopped up in so many random shapes and pieces, many of which are too big for one bite. Lobster roll - bread is not well buttered and dry as chalk. Lobster is more of a mayonnaise covered sour chunk of flavorless meat than real fresh lobster. I have never had worse lobster roll actually. For $27 it needs to be much, much better, especially in NYC. Mamosa - $14 for what most places would offer for $1 or even 1 cent mamosasOld fashioned - no apple taste at all. No bitters taste.

I thought the chicken was a bit bland and the dressing wasn't enough to add the flavor to the chicken. Salmon: I asked for the salmon to be cooked medium but it came out more medium well but still the dish was pretty good. I think the combination of potato, string beans and salmon went together very well with the sauce. I would probably come back to try their brunch menus.",0,0,0,Johnny K.,"New York, NY",600,18,21
4.0,5/18/2017,"I've been here multiple times for breakfast, it reminds me of a classy old fashioned breakfast establishment.  They do not take breakfast/brunch reservations on Saturday and Sunday so fair warning it does get busy quickly because it is not that big.  Most of the time I have come here no later than 10am because by 10:30-11 there always seems to be a wait. This place is extremely expensive in terms of breakfast/brunch. All the sides are a la carte.  WIth the omelettes you do get a muffin, croissant, scone or toast but if you'd like to add home fries, bacon, sausage, everything will cost extra.  In terms of the food:Sides: 1. Home Fries- Did not have a ton of flavor, was not very impressed by these. 2. Bacon- Very good, if you want to get this as a side there is enough bacon to feed at least two to three people so I recommend splitting the side 3. Chicken & Apple Sausage - This is delicious and extremely flavorful highly recommend4. Basket of Muffins - Wide variety and good to split amongst the group Meals: 1. Cheese Omelet with pumpkin muffin- Their omelets are amazing and they are huge.  You get a lot of eggs and fillings. Normally I get a pumpkin muffin with the omelet and it is delicious. Highly recommend. 2.Fat & Fluffy French Toast - French toast is good however it does not come with any sides so you will need to pay more to get the sides3. Morning Crunch - Perfect for the healthy eater that wants a lot of fruit to start their day 4. Crisp Potato Waffle - Popular choice at our table and ordered a lot.  Great taste and comes with a side of the chicken & apple sausageI've had mixed experience with service when I have been here.  A few times I feel like i'm extremely rushed and they really want to get your table to turn it over. One time after we paid I asked for another coffee refill (Coffee is almost $4.00 I like to get my money's worth) and they refilled it but literally cleared everything off our table and glared waiting for us to leave. Another time I sat upstairs where I had the complete opposite experience.  The service was not as attentive, it took a long time to get water, and I had very few coffee refills (they did take it off the bill).

3.0,3/12/2017,"Sarabeth's reminds me of this girl's house that I used to go to for sleepovers. Even the decor is the same: yellow linen curtains, a slight hint of lemon verbena in the bathrooms, and always, always, the rich, yeasty smell of freshly baked bread. Every Sunday morning, her dad would make us a ridiculous spread of breakfast, right down to homemade jam. The food I ate as a kid reminds me so much of everything at Sarabeth's and that's a big compliment. You can't go wrong with any of the baked goods. My personal favorite is the pumpkin muffin, stuffed with pumpkin seeds, fluffy with only a tint of sweetness. I've tried the Goldie Lox and the morning crunch granola. My boyfriend swears by the Goldie Lox - it's a hearty, creamy dish with both cream cheese and chunks of lox - but the portion sizes have been getting smaller and smaller. The most recent time, the omelette barely covered half of the plate. The granola was perfect for a morning after a massive Shake Shack meal (although granola isn't all that healthy but anyway) with fresh strawberries and banana. I wish they were a bit more generous with the yogurt, as I ended up eating the granola just by itself and it got pretty dry. My only complaint is that it's a bit pricey for brunch, especially when you add in drinks. I didn't really enjoy my Aperol Fizz because it was too dry and not sweet enough but my boyfriend's spicy margarita was absolutely delicious. Not chokingly spicy and with just the perfect amount of ginger. Weekend brunch lines are long.

Exactly what you'd expect on the UES at a long-standing, traditionally popular brunch spot.Food was acceptable. Tables are small, with very little room to fit all of the individual tea pots, coffee cups, and brunch plates. My dad's plate tipped into his lap as he tried to cut into his meal because there was not enough room on the table for it to fully fit, and the staff came over to clean it quickly, but didn't even attempt to offer to replenish the veggies that fell all over. That was surprising to me. Not anything substantial, just these tomatoes that came with his meal that he was really disappointed to have lost.And for the price.........c'mon.We laughed about the fact that the staff was all over the spill but literally only came back to deliver initial coffee, food or the check. We couldn't get a water or coffee refill for the life of us. Which we really could have used.I personally ordered their goat cheese omelette with egg whites. The goat cheese was pocketed in one small part of the omelette which bummed me out...who wants to eat just eggs in 80% of their bites? Their english muffin was not what I was expecting. Kind of resembled a popover.I don't know, I would probably visit another location, or go if I have visitors in town that want to be touristy and go.

We proceeded to examine their brunch/lunch menu, which has a lot of variety to choose from. Savory, eggs, etc. I wound up getting the short rib hash. It comes with poblano sauce but it doesn't really need it because the flavor is very good. Two eggs over easy on top made this an excellent plate. It also comes with a choice of a muffin, croissant or toast. Naturally, I opted for a toasted pumpkin muffin. Real good! They also give you their house made marmalade too - gooey good!Service was super attentive and friendly. Coffees were refilled when we were low, and it was a hot, fresh roast with every pour. The only knock on this place is the draft from the door. On cold days, the air can really rush in through the foyer and into the main dining space.

I prefer the brunch over the dinner, but the dinner is pretty good too (the menu isn't super exciting, which may be part of why it's mostly older folks at night). I particularly like the mushroom risotto which now comes with delicious burrata on top, which is super creamy mozzarella for those who don't know. I also like the bread pudding dessert. I would not recommend the mac and cheese because it has more of a plain cream sauce (béchamel with nutmeg, to be exact) than cheese sauce.Tip: if you want the weekend brunch experience, make a reservation if you do not want to wait.

I sat by the bakery in order to catch a brunch meal before they wrapped at 4pm. I ordered the crisp potato waffle with a side of eggs and a latte. I did not have a waiter so the hostess was serving me (begrudgingly bc it's beyond her scope, which I can understand) while handling seating for incoming guests so service was slow and careless. When my food came, they basically plopped it down and left me there without checking if I had eating utensils (I did not) or if I was OK. Now, in terms of the actual food: it was not good. I couldn't finish it. The eggs were extremely runny and mushy. The little containers for the sauces the crisp potato waffle came with appeared to be not thoroughly cleaned (as well as the plate). The potato waffle and chicken sausages were decent but after awhile I began feeling sick of eating it due to the taste and presentation of everything. I couldn't bare to continue and was ready to go. Of course, the check took forever to come and I think I was altogether forgotten. I very well could've walked out without anyone noticing. That's how negligent they were lol.

She ordered the eggs Benedict with crabcakes and I got the burger medium rare. I was not disappointed.  IMO, they serve a fantastic, large hamburger for a decent price.  The bun tastes home made, the fries are just like in Paris, and there's delicious sides of guacamole, coleslaw and a nice tomato katsup.  Vicky loved the eggs and crab cake!

These were delicious ! You didn't even need syrup they had so much flavor without it! I think there was a hint of ginger in them that gave it a distinct taste..try them!I also had a scone which was good only because they let us try a couple of different jams. I don't like marmalade which it comes with in general so I asked to try other flavors. They brought strawberry peach and mixed berry. The mixed berry was the best! You can even buy little jars to take home. The service was great and once you are seated you forget that you even had to wait to get in.

1.0,5/16/2016,"I used to go to brunch at the Upper West Side location around 12 years ago. I happened to be on Madison Ave. and I stopped in for lunch at 2:30 pm in the afternoon. It's always crowded when I walk by at breakfast, so I assumed it would still be great after all these years. Place was about 1/3 full, but oh, uh, I couldn't believe how bad it was for the price. I ordered a veggie frittata (which menu stated would come with choice of delicious sounding muffins or scone or toast, etc. I asked for a muffin and the guy said, ""no muffins"", so I asked for a scone, and the waiter said, ""only toast or English muffin"". I figured they ran out of the tasty baked goods I remember as it WAS late in the afternoon.  My frittata was a very unremarkable veggie omlete with a side of boring toast and a some butter and a tiny ramekin of orange marmalade (which I happen to dislike) for $15.50. My coffee was a smaller than average cup and it was served lukewarm (4.25) and I was never offered a refill. I looked around and thought the place looked tired, old and except for the beautiful architectural details near the ceiling, in need of a facelift. My lunch mate had a very large pot pie with oversized, puffed pastry crust. (22.00) The child with me loved their pot pie! Thank goodness for that. Their Coke was 3.75 and the kid said, ""This doesn't taste like Coke!"" Lol. So I tasted it. We had a little fun trying to guess as it definitely wasn't Coke or Pepsi-but I once worked in a movie theater, and they used one tank for syrup drink and another tank for carbonation, so okay, maybe the mix was off. Service was fine. With the 20% gratuity the total was $59.04! This place is tired with a capital T in my opinion. I was disappointed. Sooo many places make great food. I mean, my TOAST wasn't even good bread. I think of all the great places in Manhattan to have brunch for two for $60 without alcohol and I could kick myself.",0,0,0,Lisa O.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,42,3

5.0,10/18/2015,"A Sunday morning strolling Central Park followed by brunch at Sarabeth's, what could be a more classic New York Upper East Side experience? Yes there will be at least a 40-minute wait here, but this is New York. If you don't see a wait for brunch, then you're likely at the wrong restaurant.I had the lemon and ricotta pancakes with fresh strawberries, and my goodness, they were DELICIOUS. Last week, I had the famous blueberry pancakes at Clinton St. Baking Company, and while those were already super delicious, I thought these were just mind blowing. I love the super buttery texture combined with the lemony flavoring. The fresh strawberries also added a nice touch of sweetness. The extra maple syrup and butter just made the meal all the more amazing. For $18, you get 5 pancakes, pretty standard for New York. I was so, so full and so happy by the end. I've heard so much about Sarabeth's and given its 3.5 rating, I really wasn't expecting THAT much, but those lemon and ricotta pancakes have easily made Sarabeth's one of my new favorite brunch spots in the city.The service here is also spectacular! Our waiter was super friendly. We gobbled down our food in less than 20 minutes, but he did not rush us to leave despite the long line waiting for brunch. Instead, he refilled our water many times. It was only when we asked for the check that he brought it.Also, if you're interested in people-watching and experiencing life in the Upper East Side, Sarabeth's is a good place to do it.

The food here is good, the servers are always courteous and polite, and the bloody mary here is pleasant. That being said, there's a few elements to Sarabeth's that make the whole experience mediocre for me.I think first and foremost, Sarabeth's is expensive. You can certainly get food and cocktails of equal quality for cheaper in the neighborhood. I'm also not sure how I feel about the crowd that Sarabeth's attracts. This is great for a calm family outing, but the people that come here are the cliche Upper East Side residents.  You have sweet, wealthy old grannies coming here to catch up alongside bratty 15 year olds pulling out credit cards for their 'casual' Sunday brunch.

The child we had with us was very quiet, didn't make a peep, we did not have a stroller, and he did not cause any trouble at all -- however, the woman she seated next to us received this warning, ""I'm sorry I had to seat you next to the baby."" Really?

3.0,6/27/2015,"This is the second time I have been to Sarabeths. The first time I wasn't to impressed, the restaurant definitely could use a face lift because it can be very noisy at times and the tables are on top of each other. If you are thinking romantic this isn't the place to go. When you first enter it seems like a take out pasty or high end coffee shop turn to your right and there are lots of tables. It obviously is a neighborhood staple. Not from that area I was pretty surprised to find it so crowded you would think that the prices might be somewhat less due to the décor but not really. maybe because its on Madison not sure. Lets get down to the food. The first time I was there I had lunch and  some salad, ok not great ok but I was distracted because I wanted to speak to the person I was with and couldn't hear a word. Ok so we walked around outside.Now after a celebration a group of us gals it must have been 12 or so took a long table. The waitress was able to accommodate, did a very good job with service. One thing that's odd they do not (so I heard better double check) split food. Like if you want to split a salad before dinner, I guess bring your own plate they will not provide a plate for that. I didn't experience this myself the women I was with told me this is their policy, if it is, its a bit odd but whatever. Last night I had the chicken broiled with some sauce, gravy..? not sure. The chicken was cooked perfect I tend to like my food well done this didn't get sent back and was juicy so no complaints there. The women I was with go there regularly and love the burgers so they are busy for a reason. My experience is, hmm  the food was ok a little above average, my salad was average but I am a picky eater so I would go back. its just the room, the place is old not sure what it needs I think its the outside the entrance something. Now that I have been ""broken in"" so to say and my new friends eat there regularly I am building trust. Its American fare not a huge menu probably better for brunch or light bite.

3.0,6/17/2015,"Sarabeth's was the most expensive breakfast I have ever had in my life. Yes, the food was wonderful, but still not worth the price on most items. We ordered:1- crab cake Eggs Benedict@ $241- lemon ricotta pancakes@ $18.502- mimosas@$14.00/ea.2- Coffees@ $4.00/ea.By the time you add tax and tip to the bill, it was a few cents shy of $100.00.I was not mad about the cost because the food was really good, but if I go back I would order differently. The service was so-so. I could not even tell if we had a waiter or a waitress. One person took our order and another brought the bill. Had to request refills on coffee and water. In this price range, I expect attentive service, yes even in NYC.So my advice to future diners is: skip the lemon ricotta pancakes that everyone raves about (not that special).

The muffin was toasted to my liking however, it was too thick for an eggs benedict. There were two little pieces of smoked salmon on each side of the muffin. My friend ordered the same thing. Both our eggs were well-done, which was not what we were use to because we like our egg yolks oozing out when you cut it. My friends were able to cut the eggs without the yolk getting everywhere (that's how cooked they were :x). The eggs could have used some salt. It was very bland. The eggs benedict also came with salad on the side. Our plates were so hot that our salad became slightly cooked and became a darker green color and soggy.Overall, my experience wasn't so pleasant.

The menu offered enough options but not overwhelming. There's a category for breakfast and one for lunch. Underneath the breakfast category, food was broken down by taste (sweet, savory, etc). I tried the potato waffle with apple and chicken sausage, and some of the almond crusted French toast with strawberry sauce drizzle, with a side of bacon. Not only did the food look good, but tasted amazing. Everything looked so good, I had to order something to drink -mimosa. The Orange juice was fresh squeezed and the champagne was very good.

2.0,3/1/2015,"We stopped in for dinner and were completely underwhelmed by how bland and tasteless the food was. We should have known something was up when we saw the ""B"" rating in the window as we walked in. We started with the Guacamole and Crab appetizer ($18) and even after adding lemon and salt to it on our own, it had no taste to it whatsoever and was a complete waste of money.My husband ordered Steak Frites and it came with a watery, cold bernaise sauce and were told that is the way it was supposed to be but they would send out a ""gravy-type"" of sauce instead. When it came out, it was a watery tomato-ketchup mixture which had no resemblance to gravy. We ordered the cheddar mashed potatoes which tasted like instant potatoes from a box with some cheese shredded on top. No cheese in it at all, just shredded on top...lazy. The Roasted chicken I ordered was okay, but the cornbread stuffing was a solid, dense square and tough, as well as the chicken. The only decent thing we had was the side of Mac and Cheese and our son's entree of Adult Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup, but for $18, the sandwich was tiny.Even the Flight of Ice Cream Sandwiches were lackluster with the Salted Caramel being the only standout that wasn't flavorless. I was really surprised how bad our meal was considering the good things we'd always heard about Sarabeth's. Perhaps their breakfast and brunches are better, but I've had better food at The Cheesecake Factory. $150 bucks for two adults and a 5 year-old, incredibly and offensively overpriced for food you would find on a third-rate cruise ship.

We sat at two top and ordered coffee with heavy whipping cream. They actually had it and the waitress was nice enough to make special trip somewhere to get it. We split a pickled Bloody Mary and their famous cream of tomato soup. The drink was sour and horseradish dominant and topped with plenty of pickled carrots, bell peppers, etc. The soup was perfect for this slightly rainy day. It had chunks of tomatoes, cream, plenty of cheese and served with side of bread & butter. The combination felt like Campbell Tomato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich. Chloe had the omelette with cream cheese and chives. The simplicity of three ingredients blends was extraordinary. I had the short ribs with onion/potato hash topped with two sunny side up eggs and a side tomatillo salsa. The hash was very onion forward and green tomato salsa was thin.

4.0,10/26/2014,"Every time we visit NYC, we go at least once to Sarabeth's just for the eggs benedict.  For years it was the UWS location that we visited.  However, we began to notice that service there was spotty.  Sometimes it was on point while other times the servers were slow to come to our table and even slower to bring the check.  In fact, the last time we were there, we waited so long to pay the check so we just left money on the table to cover the cost and the tip, then hoped for the best.This time, we decided to try the UES location and were glad that we did so.  The ambiance and the vibe were so much nicer plus while seating was tight (as is often the case in NYC) it didn't feel as cramped.  In fact, it left such a good impression on us that we returned for a second visit!The first visit we had our daughter with us.  She and I ordered the salmon eggs benedict while my husband got the traditional version.  Sarabeth's uses its own English muffins that are thicker than the ones made by Thomas's.  The hollandaise sauce is perfectly prepared.  It's not too heavy or oily and the flavoring is done correctly.  The salmon, which is lox, is given in a portion size that is just right.  My husband is impressed with the Canadian bacon that is used in the traditional version.  It is thickly cut and lightly grilled.The eggs benedict comes with a side of mixed greens that are lightly dressed with a vinaigrette.  Surprisingly, it works well with the eggs benedict.The only criticism I have is that the poached eggs are not consistent.  Sometimes they come out on the hard cooked side while other times they are perfectly done.I love Sarabeth's iced tea and the lemonade.  Both come in a small pitcher which amounts to two servings.  The iced tea is unsweetened but brewed just right.  The lemonade is great with just the right amount of sweetness and tartness.  I especially like the sprig of fresh mint that is added to it.  My husband tasted the lemonade and said that Sarabeth should bottle and sell it.All that said, breakfast here isn't cheap.  For two people, it can come to almost $50 before the tip (depending on what you have to drink).  My husband has orange juice and coffee and says that both are quite good.So...if you want a splurge of a breakfast when in town, do give Sarabeth's a try!",10,4,6,Susan H.,"Reston, VA",457,688,1316

2.0,7/4/2014,"I had really high expectations of this place, seeing as that there is almost always a 30+min wait during lunch time, but instead found myself extremely disappointed. While from the exterior, the restaurant looked promising and reminiscent of a southern mansion, the interior seemed to be lacking. Maybe it was the unsightly, dingy green carpet that reminded me of a tech office in the 80s. The food is also unreasonably pricey and was of mediocre quality at best. I ordered the eggs Benedict, which was okay but certainly not worth the $17.50 price tag. The eggs appeared to be prepped in a poaching pod, which while maintaining consistently shaped eggs, screams of subpar cooking execution and technique. In my opinion, here are much better brunch spots in the area which lovingly poach their eggs using the traditional shallow pan or vortex method. My companions ordered the lobster ravioli, which was also subpar and was stuffed with lobster that was ground so fine that you could barely recognize what you were eating.More importantly, the service was horrendous. It took us (a table of 3) over 45mins to receive our food from the time we ordered, which only included my eggs benedict and the 2 plates of lobster ravioli. The servers we so busy that we literally had to wave down one of them down before they realized that we were still waiting. Even worse, there was no apology made by either serving staff or manager and nothing was even comped off the bill.To say the least, I would never recommend this restaurant or dine there ever again. While it appears to cater to a clientele of older, wealthy UESiders, I can't seem to understand why such clientele seem to be so content with the poor service and unremarkable food offered by this establishment.

It was culture shock for this poor, ghetto kid from the Excelsior! Yes, I was admiring your Goyard purses, Yiddish princesses to my right & swooning over the adorable, elderly couple to my left with more bling on than my car is worth! But I was *really* ogling the gorgeous family whose father AND grandfather handed a waiter a nice, big tip (that wa'nt no $20) after he performed gymnast moves to fish the little boy's homework from behind their corner booth. (My parents would've given him an embarrassed ""thank you"" for his efforts & me a smack upside the head for dropping my stuff in the first place.) To the fabulous, rich upper east siders I offended with my ear hustlin' & frequent admiring looks, my apologies. I apparently don't know how to act around people with money.Okay, the food: -- lemon ricotta pancakes were light & fluffy, but not as flavorful as plow's in sf (they set the standard.) -- they showcase their bakery items by offering scones, muffins, croissants, or toast with breakfast...i chose yummy toast with my scallion ""green & white eggs,"" but instead of cream cheese, I requested white cheddar...awesome meal! -- we shared a side of fries: not too crispy, nothing special, would not order again.Restaurant is two levels of elegant decor, definitely the type of spot for ""ladies who lunch.""We had a late breakfast on a weekday, which probably explains being seated within 10 minutes.

3.0,5/8/2014,Good location for brunch or breakfast especially if you are in the area to see the Guggenheim (close walk to the museum). They serve breakfast till about 3 pm daily. Mostly a local neighbourhood crowd in a charming two level restaurant. Most breakfast items are $13-$20. Frittata was not your typical frittata. Tasted somewhere between that and an omelette. They are known for their home made marmalade which was good and not overly sweet. Their English muffin was a bit different than the ones I am used to trying. This one was more fluffy - still good. The four seasons real fruit juice is a mix of four fruits and is very good ($7). Not too sweet so it was a perfect breakfast drink.

On their brunch menu it says that they ""politely decline any substitutions during brunch"" but that's not all true.I also had a peach Bellini, perfect. Oh and the best part of my meal was my dessert. I ordered their bread pudding with raspberry deliciousness! Heaven in my mouth! It's more of a custard but definitely worth a try.

It should have been called ""Scrambled eggs with a side of black beans and salsa verde, with strips of tortilla chips on top."" I wish I took a picture but that's exactly what was delivered to me. This is by far the worst plate of so-called huevos rancheros I have ever encountered. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DISH and save your money! I was so disappointed but I'm not the type to send back a dish so my husband graciously offered to switch his salmon benedict with me (which was decent).  Our friends ordered an omelette and the adult grilled cheese that comes with tomato soup, both of which looked good. I have to admit that their coffee is pretty good, and the bloody mary was not as spicy as I normally like my bloody's to be but it was ok, and it was presented very well!

3.0,11/14/2013,"With my less than stellar opinion of Sarabeth's West, I was silly to brave Sarabeth's East and expect it to be better.  The food is good.  But it's most definitely not worth the price when you can get the same menu items prepared better elsewhere for less money.  So everything in NYC is expensive, I get it.  And what they charge is not outrageous, but I shouldn't be left unsatisfied.  The bf and I had a lovely brunch here, with an attentive waitstaff and fairly quick service, but I was underwhelmed by the taste and texture of my food.  I ordered the salmon Benedict.  Some places, like Sarabeth's, struggle with this dish because the heat from the egg, muffin, and sauce can often cook the cold smoked salmon, thus completely changing the texture and taste of the dish.  Some places I've been to have been successful in serving a smoked salmon benedict where this does not happen, but sadly Sarabeth's salmon is noticeably cooked through.  But maybe that's their intention, so I won't fault them, I just wish it wasn't that way.  There was, however, disproportionately more English muffin present on the plate than any other part of the dish.  It was toasted in such a way that at times it felt stale, and while attempting to cut it with a knife and fork it shot off my plate and into my lap.  But maybe we can chalk that up to user error.  Luckily the egg yolks were still runny, but they clearly cook these puppies in an egg mold because the entire dish is so perfectly spherical.  Overall, it was a mediocre benedict that was difficult to consume due to the force I had to exert to cut the muffin.  Also, my greens that came with it had no detectable salad dressing on them, so I added a few leaves to bites with my eggs, but other than that, it was inedible because I'm not a fan of bare lettuce.  Now the bf got an omelet, which was good and tasty, but he remarked that I make him better omelets at home (aw, he sure knows the right things to say).  So our brunch wasn't awful.  The food was fine, but when with tax and tip the total was over $40 for the two of us (entrees only, no sides, no drinks) we weren't thrilled.  Sorry Sarabeth's, I just can't jump on board your popularity train.",1,0,0,Anne Marie B.,"Manhattan, NY",134,425,3

We waited about 15 minutes for a table for five on a Saturday morning. I had the ""Red Omelet"" (chunky red pepper and tomato sauce, cheddar cheese, sour cream, chives), which was not red in color, but which achieved a lightness I have never matched in my own cooking and have only rarely tasted in restaurant omelets. I also had the Pork Apricot Sausage, served in orange-apricot marmalade. The sausage was as heavenly as a ground-up meat product can be.My partner wasn't as lucky. He ordered the crab omelet, but had trouble finding any crab in it. In fact, after no one at our table was able to find any crab in it, he sent it back. A waitress brought it back to the table and said it DID contain crab, but that the pieces were quite small. She offered a small dish of crab meat, which he accepted. Unfortunately, the crab in the dish was cold, so it didn't blend well with the hot omelet. Another of our party had the same omelet made with egg whites and there was no problem finding the crab in that.Sarabeth's is known for its baked goods, and the table had toast (which had to be sent back because it wasn't toasted) and a pumpkin muffin, among other things. All were delicious.Three of our party had Bloody Marys, which looked like miniature jungles.The staff is perfectly efficient, but the lack of friendliness borders on hostility. We would say something to our waitress, and though she heard and acted on what we said, she didn't acknowledge it. I'd chalk it up to her having a bad day, but other staff members behaved similarly.

My wait on Sunday morning was 10 minutes without reservation, and the waitress seated us by the large window, where we had requested. The food came surprisingly fast (this place is a brunch machine!), and the food was set neat and clean on the plate for a lovely presentation. My ""Mixed Vegetable, Gruyere & Bacon Frittata"" ($15) was thick, plump and fluffy. The top was lightly browned, with a soft cheesy inside. The vegetable and bacon were evenly distributed with light-moderate amount of cheese to hold all the ingredients together - my clean plate was a proof of that! With this warm, chewy texture, the taste was splendid. The brunch dishes come with a ""side"" of muffin or toast - definitely go for the muffins. My friend had corn muffin, while I ordered bran muffin. The bran muffin was sweeter and crunchier than I expected, but the corn muffin was firm and moist. I recommend the sangria, too. The wine could have been stronger, but I enjoyed the fruitiness nonetheless. One pitcher fills 5-6 glasses, and I DEFINITELY had way more than I needed (let's just say we had a very fun time at the museum afterwards...). Compared to most brunch places, you will pay more for what you get. The brunch dishes don't come with potatoes or salad. But the meal is still very filling, and for the quality of food, I give Sarabeth's a thumbs up.",1,0,0,Kathy Y.,"Manhattan, NY",27,122,86

3.0,7/1/2013,"The original outpost of a culinary empire, the East Side Sarabeth's is just phoning it in.The breakfast menu hasn't changed in forever, and that's not a criticism. If you want sweet, try the light and tender lemon-ricotta pancakes. The hearty red omelette is a sure bet for those with a savory bent. Grab a side of chicken-apple sausage, a glass of four-flower juice, and some of their fine coffee.But the above breakfast cost us almost $60--and that's before tip. Crazily overpriced, even for this neighborhood. If the staff were stellar, I could live with it. Even on a weekday, when the place is half-empty, the service is indifferent at best. The patrons are mostly tourists staying at the adjoining Hotel Wales, and therefore primed to think outrageous prices and so-so service are normal.If you want the best of Sarabeth, stick with buying a jar of her fabulous jam at your local grocery instead.",2,0,2,Samantha S.,"New York, NY",202,913,0

They make it with challah bread and it is the perfect amount of sweet but not too sweet. I would suggest getting a side dish of bacon or links to share as they are generous. It's not the cheapest breakfast I've ever had but I felt like I got what I paid for, and on the Upper East Side the prices were normal. My only complaint as a Seattlite is the coffee, it tasted so weak! But that' probably because I'm used to snobby coffee.

So anyway come here for a SUPER late brunch one weekend. Really happy that they were still serving at like 3:20pm. So we get there and are told to order the brunch in the bakery area so that we can get our order in before they close the kitchen. They tell us when a table opens up in the dining room (probs before our food gets in), we can go sit there.Except that it never happens. We order the food and like 30 mins later they deliver it and we try to see if we can move to the dining room and apparently no, we aren't allowed. Ugh. Anyway so we had to sit in the bakery and eat on a tiny table. So that was annoying.But anyway, the food! Got the salmon eggs benedict and a bloody mary. Bloody Mary was good, but def not the best I've ever had. Also it was kinda pricey. Benedict was yummmm but SO pricey, gosh. Salmon was fresh and the eggs were delish, but lord, $18, my ass.So yeah, IDK.

I would have to stay the portions were perfect, but I was starved and ate all of mine and half of her meal. But honestly, if you are a bit on the hungry side, I would recommend ordering some extras. Overall a nice experience, but kind of pricey when ordering adult beverages. I basically just got off a boat, so I forgot how expensive NYC can be. I dropped about $80 US for the both of us and we didn't even have coffee. A++ on the waitstaff, but I kind of felt cramped since all the patrons were basically on top of each other.

5.0,3/2/2013,"In a word: GLORIOUS. This is of course a very famous place, with a touristy branch on Central Park South and another on the UWS I've never been. I didn't know about the Tribeca one as I never go down there. I haven't even been to SoHo for Balthazar in 3 years. One does get stuck in a cluster of neighborhoods and Tribeca isn't one of mine when in the city. This would be the fantasy house: cozy, elegant and quintessentially Upper East Side (well, 80s and 90s between 5th and Lex). I walked 30 blocks, in the mood for a day outside, and when I arrived before 2PM, the wait was just 10 minutes. They told me 20 minutes but it was more like 10 and I got one of the booth tables for two, with no one on one side (middle obstruction). I had been here once, not to eat, just for coffee and muffins and I loved everything about it. It's pricey, yes, but when most (slender to average) women consume a huge lunch like this, they don't eat dinner so whatever. I found quite a nice Malbec for 11/glass which is far from out of line with wines by the glass in the city, which tend to be a good 20% above comparable restaurants in West LA or SB, particularly at nice hotel bars--the Pen, Gramercy Hotel--which are truly outrageous. I was tempted by lemon ricotta pancakes which my server said were the absolute best among the pancake/waffle offerings--but I had a very rare half a pastry for breakfast (prune hamantashen for Purim from the Bread Factory), so I just didn't want a sweet lunch. (On the online menu I saw a pasta with crab meat I intended to have but it wasn't on the menu for whatever reason. The specials included a curry, carrot and saffron soup with crab meat I sampled and liked but didn't think was over-the-top great) and the signature decadent ""velvet cream of tomato."" The BLT frittata was bacon, lobster and something else but I just am not much of a bacon person except on a cobb so I passed.)Sarabeth's has made a national brand out of their jam--I bought a friend a FB birthday gift of three small jams last month--and I had that on sourdough. Unlike almost every breakfast place I've been--and breakfast is one of my things--you have to order potatoes on the side (7 or 8 I think), so even if you have the very cheapest omelets (cheese for 13 or spinach and goat cheese for 15), you're looking at low 20s for an omelet. It is , however, huge and perfect so if that offends you, this is not the place to go for brunch. The pancakes/waffles are 17--""sweet breakfast""--and the couple next to me ordered the salmon benedict and blintzes to split. I have only tried blintzes once or twice--not a big LA thing and I don't even know if Fromin's, our family Jewish deli, serves them--but these looked orgasmic as I posted on FB from my phone during a long, lingering lunch. The hot Toddy was tepid but it was close enough for government work: Makers, honey, lemon (12). One quibble: the mimosa is 10 (fine) but they serve J ROGET?! The dive-y now defunct Peabody's in Montecito and Steve's, my local diner in SB walking distance from my apartment, served what my Michigan wine business friend calls J ROTGUTOn the upside, they have fresh squeezed blood orange to go with this bargain basement champagne. But I did get a laugh with the girls next to me ordered Mimosas and that's what they brought to the table. The Bloody Mary looked too adventurous and sophisticated for me--""pickled"" with jicama and other spices--so I played it safe. My spinach and goat cheese omelet was simple but truly outstanding. I have to try to lemon ricotta pancakes before I leave next Saturday. From 59th to 86th St is no big deal and then just 7 blocks walking and I forgot just HOW much I love the 70s and the 80s. Great architecture, people watching and window shopping. The service is great. I took much longer than usual to decide what I wanted and the server did not pressure me. Of course I did spend 35 bucks JUST on booze (three drinks) so it's not like I was drinking tap water the whole time. Love, love, love.",3,1,1,Victoria O.,"New York, NY",806,863,381

They are ALWAYS packed, and you can only make reservations before 9am or after 2pm on weekends, so plan to wait, unless you can come early.

4.0,1/3/2013,"Once upon a time, brunch was an elegant meal that was served in nice places with upscale versions of classic breakfast and lunch staples.  Sometimes you would get some fresh squeezed juice or a cocktail to accompany your meal.  Then along the way brunch devolved into one of two categories: the all-you-can-eat and drink variety with heaping portions of flapjacks and J Roget Mimosas, or those earthy hipstery brunch places with organic quinoa-infused frittatas and Lancaster County Bacon for $17.95.Sarabeths is neither of those places, and probably one of the few brunch spots left that brings a certain class and dignity to the weekend staple.  This is not the place to get bombed after a night on the town, but where to take your parents when they are visiting for the weekend and they want omelets and Bloody Marys.  The last time I was here, I had scrambled eggs, bacon, a muffin with butter and jam, and a Bloody Mary so over the top, I couldn't tell if it was a salad or a cocktail (but those pickled veggies worked wonders on my mild hangover).    There were also Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, which were light, fluffy, and just filling enough.  Plus, the restaurant is a great space that's warm and intimate without feeling tiny or cramped.  And, the service is fantastic to boot.While pricier than the normal brunch spot, I feel that you get exactly what you pay for: an upscale, classic brunch that delivers on food, drink, and service.  This is not the place to go if you are looking for something to eat, but rather if you are looking to enjoy a meal with good food and good company.One last tip: they don't take reservations on weekends for brunch, so be prepared to wait in line if you can't get here early.",2,1,1,Barrett L.,"Washington, DC",822,287,0

A recommend if you love pouchy, runny eggs!  2. Sarabeth's famous tomato soup- rich, thick, mixed in with actual chunks of tomatoes.  I enjoyed it during my taste.. better yet, eat it with the bread that they give you!3. Fruit Bowl- standard but nicely plattered.  Cute place with 2 levels.  The bakery is at the front, where they also sell her jams.  I shall try them next time I am back!",3,0,1,Kathy D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",2136,1124,541

3.0,9/22/2012,"Iconic yet forever touristy, Sarabeth's is the quintessential brunch experience where visitors love to join and locals love to hate. There is a stuffiness for all fo the simple, comfort food they offer and adds to the popular theory that NYC is far too expensive for everyone to live.Brunch seems to be the most popular time for most visitors. There is a wait on the weekend, even with reservations sometimes and its best to scope out the menu ahead of time to ease the ordering. Most entrees are between $14-19, which sides at around $7 each. Theoretically with everything combined, it'd be roughly a $35 meal, but that's only if you decide put together a typical breakfast (eggs, potatoes, whatever else).If I'm going to order anything, I'm likely to get the Goldie Lox Scramble ($16), a rich scramble of lox and cream cheese, which comes with a muffin, scone, croissant, or toast. I'm always tempted to get their benedict combos or even huevos rancheros, but the $18-19 price tag is a little bit of a buzzkill. In the end, what's an additional $3 anyway? To save you the trouble of ordering it, they're hardly worth the price tag.Brunch not so appealing? Dinner is going to be a similar page, with most entrees hovering around the $23-30 mark. I've had decent results with the Grilled Long Island Duck Breast ($25) and the Pan Roasted Filet of Sole ($24) isn't half bad either.

I have to say, though, the most enjoyable part of the brunch was the scones and jam. This restaurant creates their own jams, and it  was quite simply one of the best I've ever had.

We loved the place.The Bad....Halfway through my 7 year olds waflle, she spits out a 1 inch metal staple with sharp edges. Luckily, she was not cut and no harm. I then flag down a waitress and let her know what happened. She apologizes quickly takes the plate, and disappears. After 15 minutes she reappears with the check and says the manager would like to offer to pay for the waffles. End of story, have a nice day.I then asked to see the manager. She shows up another 5 minutes later, says sorry she didnt come out to speak to us, but was in the kitchen showing the chef. Clearly she was hiding and had  zero interst in speaking to us, as 15 minutes elapsed.I would have thought the manger would take responsiblity, check on my daughter etc??  The lack of interest really hit home. This could have become a big deal. I understand that things happen, but the complete lack of urgency suggests this doesnt rate as a big deal.  Conclusion... never raised my voice or spoke harshly.  I am not looking for anything. I just thought out of courtesy that someone other than the waitress ( who was very professional) would actaully come to the table.  Why go to a restaurant that treats this as a everyday occurance?.It was a complete lack of respect and common courtesy.

Melt in your mouth, smooth, almost frothy eggs mixed in with scallions and cream cheese, with a side of perfectly toasted sourdough bread (you could chose between bread, scone, muffin, English muffin or croissant), and a generous portion of fresh strawberry jam, and ball of butter. What a dish!!!!My friend ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and we decided we'd split everything so we could both get a taste of the goodness!Her pancakes were fluffy and sweet with a light tangy aftertaste from the lemon that was harmoniously in balance with the ricotta.

There's a tea, coffee, and pastry bar right at the entrance, then a large (for Manhattan) dining area plus another dining area upstairs. The decor was great. Very classy. Makes you want to have tea and crumpets here.We arrived at about 5:00, which was just a bit too early for their usual dinner menu. Instead, we were given their high tea menu. That was a bummer -- since this menu is limited to about a half-dozen entrees, and only one was vegetarian. But it turned out alright.We ordered (and split) the tomato soup and a penne pasta. The soup was probably the best we'd ever had of that variety. They topped it generously with shredded cheese and it was very good. The pasta did not disappoint either. It was loaded with yummy pine nuts and a breadcrumb topping that gave it a mild crunch. I was thrilled that when the food came out (rather quickly, I might add) that they pre-split it for us -- and at no charge. The portions were perfect for us to split. If you were super-hungry, then don't split. But it was just right for us.The soup and entree together came to about $30. We didn't order drinks. I felt the price was fair, perhaps a little on the high side, but the decor and deliciousness made it a good value.Our only disappointment was the waitress.

4.0,1/1/2012,"Lazy Sunday, my boyfriend was visiting for new year's and post party-night we were looking to get some late lunch/dinner on the UES. I know Sarabeth is known for brunch and we were too late but I was very interested in a place with a low-key quiet quaint atmosphere. Sarabeth's was perfect. The decor is very classy but casual. I had the tuna fish my boyfriend had the chickhen pot pie. Both were good. Nothing exceptional but good-sized portions and tasted delicious. We were also very hungry. So take that into interpretation.  I'm a big fan of iced tea and the pot of iced tea was enough for both of us for have 1 glass each. it was very light and prefect with a meal. The place was pretty empty so we had no problem with service. Although we didn't get afternoon tea, looking at the menu and the bakery items I would definitely return here for afternoon tea.

3.0,10/9/2011,"Sarabeth's can be a hit or miss. We've experienced both on multiple occasions.We usually come here for brunch but have enjoyed dinner too. Food is OK, although it usually sounds better than tastes. Service can be decent and can be... well... very, very poor. Our waitress today was tragically slow, the kind that never checks on you and she had to be asked several times for the check. After 15 mins there was still no check so I had to settle it with the hostess. How embarrassing! Our food was served cold - not even a half-hearted apology has left her lips. On the other hand, our waiter last week was pleasant and did a decent job.Why do we keep coming back here regardless of their shortcomings? Because the location is incredibly convenient for us, they serve brunch until 3:30pm and they have awesome Bloody Marys. But I would never, ever go out of my way for Sarabeth's.

Just in time, apparently, after that is started to fill up and a line was clearly in formation. The first thing I like about this spot was the decor. Very Victorian, elegant, classy, yet simple. I honestly would come back just for the decor; it's that lovely. However, the food was not that impressive. Maybe I should have got the waffles(my all-time favorite brunch food), but I decided to go with the eggs benedict. It was a little cold, but decent. Nothing to write home about.

3.0,9/25/2011,"Service was great. Food was pretty good. Huge portions (I don't rate for portions). They have a Grade B restaurant sanitary inspection grade -- which I didn't notice until after we left. Would like to know why they didn't get an A.  Was told that once a restaurant is given less than an A rating, there is at least a week-long break and then another inspection occurs ... if it doesn't meet the A rating requirements, then the B (or lower) rating is issued. There is then an appeal process. Decaf latte was just okay; my husband's cappuccino was not -- it came with cinnamon on top (which he didn't ask for and didn't like) and was watered down. Moved on to a spicy bloody mary (light on the pickled veggies) and a ""four flowers juice (fresh orange, pineapple, banana and pomegranate juices) mimosa. Both were very good. My husband ordered the Farmer's Omelette (leeks, diced ham, dice potatoes, and Gruyere cheese) and I had the ""green and white"" eggs (scrambled eggs with scallions and cream cheese (I had the cream cheese on the side)). My husband liked his omelette. My eggs were overcooked. I also ordered the chicken apple sausages -- they were very good; flavorful and moist. And, they come on a bed of homemade apple sauce (which is very good). These egg meals came with a pastry of our choice ... my husband had sourdough toast -- it was fine ... I ordered the black currant scone -- it's in the shape of a biscuit and, to me, is more biscuit-like than scone-like ... it was fine nothing special. The preserves with both, however, an orangish marmalade, were good. It's a loud restaurant with no character or decorative style ... and, it has lots of noisy children. We went at 9 am on Sunday for brunch and they were very busy (30-45 minute wait list) by the time we left (we had made 9 am reservations).

First of all, I love the location of Sarabeth's - upper east side in afternoon summer sunshine somehow sets the tone perfectly for brunch. Sunlight was pouring through the windows. Service was fantastic too. I came with one other friend and there was a 20-25minute wait which I didn't really mind because the staff were incredibly friendly. They were very pleasant people who were easy to talk to. I almost enjoyed the wait...Food-wise, MMMMM. I got the Farmer's Omelette. You know how omelettes are usually sort of flat? Well this one was large and FAT but also delicately made - jam-packed with cheese, potato chunks, ham and onions (I think). You get a choice of a side and I got a scone which was yummy, and the jam and butter combination was very delightful. Coffee was good too. So yeah, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! I love it. It's 1am and I'm salivating thinking about it. Anyways, I've eaten my fair share of brunches, and this is definitely topping my list.

The service is friendly and courteous.  The prices are a bit on the high side as far as brunch fare goes. But to be fair, their portions are more than generous.

We had to ask three times before this was actually acknowledged.Food: The food was sub par. We ordered the club sandwiches and the grilled portobello mushroom sandwich. Both were fine, but not great considering the price. The turkey club didn't have any mayo in it, so it was in other words dry. It also had mozzarella cheese and ham, which I found to be odd. The portobello sandwich had tapenade on both sides of the roll, but you could hardly taste it. The fries that come on the side were under seasoned. I do love their muffins though. My mother adores their scones, which I have yet to try. Skip the restaurant and buy the muffins or scones. Atmosphere:Very noisy, but charming interior. Nice wooden tables, and painted bright yellow give it a homey cheery atmosphere. However this does not make up for how lack luster the food was. Do yourself a favor and skip this place. It's not worth it. Instead buy a muffin or something at the counter. Much better and you don't even have to wait at least 15 minutes  for your food.Maybe I just came the wrong day.

They sell their cookbook, and their jellies and jams right at the front when you walk in.They WILL NOT seat you until your entire party is present. This was fine, as the wait was somewhere in the realm of 30-40 minutes when we arrived. A Bloody Mary helped pass the time quite well. We sat in the back of the restaurant, in a little terrace-type room. I had scrambled eggwhites over an English muffin and sauteed spinach and Canadian bacon (I subbed in regular bacon for the Canadian). It was delicious! The English muffin was more of a corn cake and really hit the spot, even for carbophobic me! My friends ordered the Eggs Benedict and an Omelette. Their dishes looked really good, and were nicely presented. One of my girlfriends subbed in a small mixed salad for her potatoes, and they happily obliged. We also shared a side of grilled asparagus and hash browns. The entire meal totally hit the spot, and quelled our imminent hangovers.

When we were finally seated, the service was fairly quick although our waitress seemed overwhelmed with her four tables.Overall, the atmosphere was very cute and I was hoping for a great experience. Everyone's dishes were over-salted, however, and at the end of the meal, I was quite disappointed. My husband's crab cake sandwich should have been dubbed a mini crab cake sandwich. How could anyone fill up on that portion? I ordered the huevos rancheros, and I was not blown away. The eggs were cold and the beans salty. The ""tortillas"" were soggy underneath the eggs and tasted too oily on top of the egg (fried strips for decoration, maybe?). My other friend ordered the cheese omelette, and they gave tons of cheese, but by the time he got towards the end of the meal it looked like a block of cheese rather than yummy oozy goodness. I do have to compliment them on their mixed muffin basket. It gives you five of their muffins which taste amazing with preserves/butter...Overall, I have definitely had better brunch at many other cities.

Within a few minutes of our arrival, we were seated in the little alcove  above the main dining area.A friend and I ordered the goat cheese and spinach omelet (she got an accompanying scone and I got the 7 grain toast), another the waffles and sausage and fourth, the farmer's omelet (with a scone). Our food arrived quickly but my anticipation melted away when I saw my swelling bright yellow omelet accompanied by four withered triangles of toast. Across the table, my friend's sausage and waffles appeared to have been thrown on the plate on their way out of the kitchen. The other omelets looked similar to mine, but with a scone on the side.As I bit into it, I was met with more disappointment, the omelet was spongy, wasn't seasoned and lacked any real flavor. What I expected was a softness and for the flavors of the spinach and goat cheese to come together. What I got was a mass of egg mixed with spinach and a glob of goat cheese in the middle. The flavors didn't dance.There was similar feedback on the other meals and a reminiscing for a much better brunch we'd had at Jane in the LES a few weeks back.My frustration with a place like Sarabeth's is that there is so much hype about their amazing brunch but the quality of the food, the presentation and general thought that goes into preparing dishes is very much in lacking. I really did feel like I was eating at a diner with a homey ambiance. However, I don't think it's worthy of the accolades.There are some of these old established restaurants that seem to hit a tipping point and while they draw crowds on their past success, they long ago stopped innovating or really investing in the food experience.I won't be back to this or the other two Sarabeth's locations in the city, because I've tried them all and they've all failed to live up to the hype.",3,0,2,Vee V.,"Philadelphia, PA",26,114,0

Something hearty to kick start my mid afternoon and accompany it with a mimosa and we are in business.After searching the upper east side for a spot, this was the place my coworker and I landed. It is perfect! As the afternoon sun filled the room I could feel my hunger building. We ordered the garden omelet and lemon ricotta pancakes. It was great! Fresh and delicious are the words I would use to describe this meal. The added touch of lemon in the pancakes were just the right amount on the fluffy stack.Only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because I almost tossed my cookies when I went into the bathroom. It was filthy! It left me amazed and wondering how is it humanly possible to defecate on the back of the toilet bowl with the seat up.

All around bad.I feel terrible for making him come all the way up to Sarabeth's for a very expensive bad lunch...  Granted, it is the UES and Madison Ave, but for $50 for two, it was very very disappointing.  It was busy there, everyone seemed happy, but then again a lot of people seem really happy in a lot of places that serve bad food.  The $3.50 coffee was bad, the place was a bit dirty, it was just bad...  I don't understand how this place is still in business.  Just because it is on the UES does not mean it is good.  Perhaps it is only still in business because the area is the Bermuda Triangle for a decent sit down lunch?  (If anyone knows of a better place to go in the immediate area, for lunch, send me a message - I beg of you!)Never again.",2,1,1,Pamela S.,"Brooklyn, NY",53,178,0

I don't know about you, but that's not the way I want my Eggs Benedict to taste. The result was pretty bland, and overpowered the egg. It wasn't horrible, but I wouldn't order it again.This place seems very popular, so I will likely give it another shot.

The decor and setting with the upstairs over looking downstairs, made you forget you were in the busy city and almost had a cottage feel to it. Plus one. Plus two, the chicken apple smoked sausage.  Plus three, the French toast. The pumpkin muffin alone is another plus and the bacon and eggs were great. Plus and plus. The staff was friendly and service was quick but not rushed. Add two more. Minus 4 for the prices. I understand NYC brunch, UES, blah blah blah but really, $6.50 for a side of 4 pieces of bacon?  $5.50 for a juice?  It's not the Plaza people.   I'd go back despite that and order less and split with friends next time.

And it is not large inside, so you can imagine how I felt about it.I don't like when places are crowded. This place would have a cute, nice atmosphere if it wasn't for all the people. If you've ever been here, you can tell why I was offended by some lady who wanted to PARK her stoller to the left side of the place right when you walk in. AND THEY LET HER! Anyway, Scott B. and his BF were late, so I got to wait in the line with all the charming people. This place? Also not designed for a big waiting line. From all the people chatter, I discovered that it's a popular location for people to celebrate engagments. Or at least at 1:00 PM on a Saturday.When I finally sat down, 40 minutes later, it was pretty quick with ordering and with food coming out. They hype on the food in this place is well deserved; it was yummy. I had apple cinnamon french toast. And scrambled eggs. The eggs were super good. Also, good coffee. Which is often hard to find at a place like that. I was impressed. It got a little dodgy at the end because after waiting so long, the managing lady (who I like to think of as being the titular Sarabeth) started to shoo us out.

Both times I've opted for the famous lemon ricotta pancakes (even though I'm usually an eggs gal) They really are wonderful - not too sweet, and just a hint of lemon. They serve up 1/2 a dozen sprinkled with berries and real maple syrup for just under $14. Overall, it's a good meal, though the atmosphere is a tad hectic for my liking. Also, you have to order your sides separately and while a side of delicious bacon is $5 for about 12 slices, that means fatty over here will eat the whole thing.

5.0,10/19/2009,"The summer of my 17th year, I took my first trip to New York on my own.  I was from Florida, but my roommate from boarding school lived with her parents on 92nd and Lexington.  When they offered to have me visit for a week, I accepted without hesitation.  As I boarded the plane in Florida, I noticed an elderly lady, who must have been nearing 80, getting on the plane ahead of me with three adult children and some younger tykes whom I could only assume were grandchildren.  The tiny elderly lady was wearing a vintage Chanel suite with a rhinestone necklace and earrings, perfectly polished 1940s pumps with a thick stacked heal and silver buckles, black stockings with the seam up the back and her hair was a perfect steel-gray, styled in bun atop her little head.  As we filed into our seats, it became apparent that my curiosity about this peculiar woman would be satiated.  For the next 3 hours, we sat side by side, and this lovely little lady became the best story teller I had ever met. They call me ""Boom Boom"" she said.  ""Sarah"" I replied.  ""And your middle name?"" Boom Boom asked.  ""Elizabeth"".  She nodded, ""is that so? Well...""Boom Boom had five children, her husband was a clothier, furs, I believe.  They were Jews and they came to New York from Russia (?) just after they were married.  She was in the middle of this fascinating story about how they came to the states when her daughter, from two rows back, interrupted and apologized on behalf of her mother for disturbing me, and asked if I'd like to trade seats.  Absolutely not, I thought, this woman is fascinating!  After assuring her daughter that we were doing just fine - Boom Boom and I continued in our conversation.  It was in this conversation that I learned the story of Sarabeth's Kitchen, founded by her daughter Suzanne Beth Shapiro, who's nickname was Sarabeth.  Boom Boom said she knew I'd like the story, because I shared the same name.  She was so proud of her daughter, and after my first experience dining at ""Boom Boom's"" restaurant on 92nd and Madison, I knew why. Boom Boom told me about the ""marmalade queen"", her sister's mother-in-law, and how she made the most incredible preserves in Paris.  The family thought the recipes died with her - until Boom Boom's sister taught Sarabeth how to make them, and how over time Sarabeth perfected the recipes and that her preserves had become a nationally recognized brand.  Boom Boom beamed with pride.  As we were landing, my new friend invited me to come to brunch at the restaurant on 92nd and Madison; the restaurant where she worked.  This was the restaurant that had become the centerpiece of her story, the rock of her family, the pride of her life, and the linchpin of their history.  I was only 2 blocks away on 92nd and Lexington - I had no choice, I had to go!  I will never forget my first meal at Sarabeth's Kitchen on 92nd and Madison.  The marmalade, the eggs, the English muffins, the fruit, the coffee, the butter, the orange juice - everything was perfect.  I remembered thinking that if I ever lived in New York, that this would be my favorite place to go for brunch.  Today, a hundred years later :-),  now that I do live on the Upper East Side, Sarabeth's Kitchen is my favorite place to go on a Saturday morning. I don't know if Boom Boom was the reason why I fell in love with New York.  I don't believe that Sarabeth's was the reason I fell in love with Brunch.  Though when friends ask me where to go on a Saturday morning for the best preserves and biscuits in the city, I always send them to Boom Boom's.  I tell them not to worry about the 30 to 40 minute wait for a table, or the hike uptown for those not from the neighborhood, ""It's worth it"" I say, ""you'll see"".  Even though there are other locations in the city which may be closer, I tell them to forget about the time or their obligations for the rest of the day, or their hunger as they wait in line, I tell them to ""trust me"", and those who do, have never been disappointed.  Sarabeth's Kitchen on the Upper East Side is perfect.  And when I go, I silently take a trip down memory lane, back to my youth, my trip into independence, and my flight with Boom Boom.  Though I never saw her again after my first brunch, I go back to pay homage every now and then, and to satiate my desire for the smoked salmon and cream cheese (egg white only) omelet, an ""adult"" orange juice now, a hot cup of coffee with cream, and a delicious English muffin with creamy butter and Sarabeth's marmalade.   And though today's wait staff and bus boys and hostesses have never acknowledged that they knew Boom Boom, I can say that I knew her and I can take a moment to thank her silently for not only introducing me to this wonderful New York City gem, but for convincing me that I too belonged in this great big scary city she called home.Thank you for the memories Boom Boom!

3.0,10/19/2009,"The epitotme of disappointment.Horribly hungover and on a mission to locate a satisfying, nausea silencing brunch, I dangerously utilized my mobile Yelp app while driving. Don't you dare judge me.Sarabeth's popped up as an option and I had remembered hearing something about their highly regarded lemon ricotta pancakes which just happened to be the subject of my most wonderful dreams, recently. Needless to say, I was absolutely delighted when we walked into Sarabeth's and learned that the wait was a mere thirty minutes. Not only that, but I totally snagged a parking spot right in front. Double score!We were seated towards the very front of the restaurant, near the windows, which I'm sure is the desired dining area in the summer months, but on a cold day, you are better off eating without a view. I was absolutely frozen throughout my meal.ADD Side Note: Across from me, a sickeningly affectionate couple sat, enjoying a bowl of cold cereal together. Have you ever seen two people, in the throws of passion, sharing a bowl of cereal? Cold milk dripping off the woman's spoon, in what seemed like slow motion, back into the communal cereal bowl where the man would then quickly dip his respective eating implement into the then-soggy slurry and slurp in the same fashion as his lover. Not barfing was a chore. But I digress...I, of course, ordered the famed lemon ricotta pancakes with a pricey side of sausage (a whopping $2 + change per link) and my mother ordered a spinach and goat cheese omelet. A thirteen dollar spinach and goat cheese omelet. Breakfast meat candy was not included, but do not fret!: for an additional 7 dollars, you can land yourself 5 tasty pieces of bacon. Mmmm, overpriced meat. My pancakes were absolutely perfect; fluffy, moist and tender, nearly melting in my mouth. The perfect amount of fresh lemon brightened the flavor of the pancakes and the warm, real maple syrup completed them. Not overpowering like the sugary, sticky stuff (though I do love my Auntie J.) and not too sweet. I also enjoyed my sausage, but really, how could you not appreciate delicious links of porky goodness sitting in a puddle of warm, homemade apricot preserves? As for my mother, she hated her omelet. ""Don't make me Yelp this."", she threatened. However, she very much enjoyed the homemade pumpkin muffin that came with it, and a few of my pancakes that I rationed to her in the beginning of the meal (I figured she wouldn't like what she ordered. Never does...) so it wasn't a complete brunch failure. She also loved her bacon, claiming it had the perfect crunch to chew ratio.All in all, I would say to all those wondering if waiting two hours to eat at Sarabeth's is worth it, that: No. No, it's not. But it's a fine brunch option if you want to semi-satisfy a parent or semi-satiate your post-boozescapade belly..",6,7,7,Liana L.,"Brooklyn, NY",283,320,26

4.0,10/16/2009,"Walking into Sarabeth's after being attacked by an unexpected torrential downpour had such a dramatic affect on me. Just picture this, me half rained on while suffering hunger and chill, walking into a warm cozy brunch place and was greeted by a display case of fresh baked pastry... It pretty much gave itself a star right there.I find the menu quite interesting, at least more so than many other brunch places I have been to-- i.e. The bear family porridge and Goldie Lox....etc. I had the country breakfast, because I was quite curious about the cheddar grit custard, and I really needed some good-old crispy bacon. I liked how one can choose from such a wide range of bread/pastry to go with your breakfast--I went with the scone, and it was really really good. The roasted pepper tomato sauce that came with the country breakfast was perfect for the eggs and everything on the dish, but the grit custard didn't impress. Now that I thought of it, I shoulda gotten eggs benedict or goldie lox... why didn't I???Well despite the small disappointment, the slightly high price and the average service, I did have a good brunch here. And I think most people that go there already knows this, but they seem to have some amazing soups. So I'd say, try the soup, eat the scone and listen to your tummy say thank you.",0,0,0,Tracy C.,"Boston, MA",20,130,3

Came here on a cold rainy day after a friend recommended this place for being absolutely amazing and wonderful. Must say, after strolling a couple of blocks in the rain, with water running down your back and into my shirt, Sarabeth's warm and cozy atmosphere definitely lifted my spirits. As with most brunch places, there is a wait, but at 2pm, it was only around 20 minutes - so nothing too ridiculous. I love their display case as you walk in, everything looks delicate and delicious, the pastries and the cakes are very tempting. For my meal, I got an omelette with potatoes in them (ok, and other stuff..) but the potatoes were such an interesting addition. The omelette...well...was an omelette. It was good, but not amazingly memorable. Our service was average, the waitress didn't really come back to check on us after taking our orders.........not giving me enough attention! But my attention issues/needs aside, I would probably return at least one more time, the porridge intrigues me...too bad they only serve it before noon!",0,0,0,Cindy C.,"New York, NY",78,287,0
4.0,9/20/2009,"OMG FREAKING SOOOOOO GOOD. My friend and I have a scale to rate brunch places before we begin dining. It's quite simple. How many old people do you see? I'm not talking middle aged, I'm talking grandmas and grandpas. The amount of these wonderful old people you see directly correlates to how good the meal will be. When we walked into Sarabeths, we saw a large amount of old people and were very excited. The group ahead of us were these grandmas in matching Sunday hats and colorful outfits - they were so adorable, I almost took a photo of them. The hostess asked the women if they would like their usual table. Another good sign.Okay, on to the food. The wait for a table was a little long, but it was well worth it. Maybe we should've made a reservation, but we picked this place on the fly in the morning. There's a glass pastry display case up in the front which just makes you hungrier as you are waited to be seated. I had french toast with a side of bacon and my friend had the classic eggs benedict (her usual breakfast choice). My friend raved about the eggs benedict, and I consider her to be a connoisseur as she always gets it and is a foodie. My french toast was delicious -- fluffy, hot, perfectly sweet. Overall, we were really happy with the food. It is a little pricey, but what brunch place in Manhattan isn't? The service was good despite the busy Sunday morning crowd.

It kind of reminded me of a presidential suite. Food was super delicious! Two of us had the eggs benedict and the salmon benedict and they were amazing! We also got a side of apple sausage and the home fried potatoes which were pretty decent. (The portion of the sausage is a bit small)My french toast with apples were AMAZING! So delicious!!

5.0,8/18/2009,"If it wasn't for the DELISH lemon ricotta pancakes, I would have given this place 4 stars because of the long wait. I guess it was expected since we strolled in on a Sunday during peak brunch hour. Love the mellow yellow walls in this place, very upper east side, great cup of Early Grey.Me and my friend shared the Morning Crunch Granola with yogurt and loved it, I normally like my granola to stick together but not going to cry about it.Like said, I got the lemon ricotta pancakes, perfection! Very citrus-y and refreshing, sort of like eating a lemon cookie. Needless to say I cleaned my plate within minutes. My friend got the almond french toast with cranberry jam/preserves (don't think it's on the online menu), I had a bite and found that it was a perfect mixture of soft and crunchy if you could believe, there was a huge layer of sliced almonds baked on top of the french toast. Needless to say, we left with full and happy stomachs.Overall a great brunch experience, would surely come back for a salmon eggs benedict, or an omelette (they were the fluffiest I have ever seen). A few tips: try to avoid peak brunch hour if you can hold out, by the time we were midway through our meals the restaurants had cleared out quite a bit. If you are waiting on line to put your name down for a table, be a little persistent with the hostess as they are always running around and a bit hard to catch, if they tell you to hold on a second get someone else in your party to go back and ask.",1,0,0,Sophia Y.,"Princeton, NJ",33,10,0

These delicious treats were too filling to finish - I was lucky enough to enjoy some fresh strawberries on the side. I could barely taste the ricotta but the lemon flavor was spot-on. Maybe I was having a bad day with my tastebuds given I was getting over a cold. Hopefully, the ricotta was there, and I was just unable to taste it.Sarabeth's East is charming, a bit small, and has polite service. Our waitress was constantly refilling tea and water, and offered suggestions for our meals. The Goldie Lox is also great - both of my brunch partners ordered it. Although it is salty, I'm never one to turn down a great lox.I love the bakery area - you can get the most adorable chocolate dipped  cookies or the sweetest-looking scones, and also some mini-sized jams. Their jams taste VERY fresh; tarte and sweet, not like something that has been sitting on the shelf at Ralph's for three months.Overall, I loved brunching here and people watching on Madison.

1.0,5/5/2009,"We came for tea and were completely underwhelmed. Perhaps brunch is a different experience but I do not recommend their afternoon tea at all. Our tea sandwiches were not only tiny but also dry and far from delicate. Scones did not come with clotted cream and fresh preserves but instead with butter and mediocre jam. Nothing tasted fresh and the cookies were no better (if not worse) than what can be purchased at a corner bodega/supermarket bakery. Luckily, at $20, it wasn't too much of a drain on the wallet. Perhaps when every table is filled, Sarabeth's might manage to actually have a little ambiance but, as one of the three tables there and without the distraction of good food, all we could see was the outdated (as opposed to classy) decor and the flies buzzing absentmindedly around the room as the waitstaff pointedly ignored us. I understand that most of the interim between brunch/lunch and dinner is used to set-up and clean the restaurant but if a restaurant is going to offer a midday service, patrons should not be able to smell the bleach in the air and should receive a little more service than getting food plopped on their table.

The Poached Salmon Cobb salad is really fresh and light with interesting ingredients such as wheatberries and marinated tomatoes, which make this a unique and special salad.

5.0,3/2/2009,"After my first Yelp recommendation paid off, my husband and I decided to try Sarabeth's East with a friend for Sunday brunch. Everyone mentioned the long wait and we certainly had a good thirty minutes to stand in a cramped and tempting space (we got to stare longingly at a big case of amazing looking cookies). However, I'm not taking a star off for it, good things come to those who wait!When it was time, we were seated in the window at a very small, but cute table. Everything is very tight, so avoid bringing big bags or private conversations to the table. With that said, our server was over in seconds and had our drinks to us quickly. I had a loose leaf tea, but wish I'd tried the mimosas everyone else raved about though the tea was very good.The menu looked so good it took us two visits from the server before we'd finally decided on our dishes. I ordered the farmer's omelette with leeks, ham, potato and gruyère and a croissant. I also ordered a side of the chicken apple breakfast sausage. My husband had the french toast and our friend ordered the potato waffles with sausage, sour cream and apple sauce. Everything was amazing! The omelette was hearty, stuffed with toppings and perfectly cooked. The croissant was crisp, buttery and the jam they brought with it was heavenly. I don't know what it was, but I'm going to buy some to take home next time. As for the sausages, I typically don't like sausage, but it sounded good on the menu and when it arrived, the texture, taste and apple topping was light and delicious, I cleaned the plate. The french toast was excellent from what my husband said and our friend couldn't stop raving about the potato waffles and what tasted like homemade apple sauce.They let us sit for awhile despite the long lines and chat over our drinks. While we were talking Katie Couric showed up and sat down two tables from us! We aren't from NYC, so seeing someone famous that close to us was quite a treat. So, Sarabeth's gets a five from me.

I've brought so many friends and family members to this place over the years and had so many great brunches with the roommate that it is forever ingrained as one of my favorite places in New York City.If you're looking for a breakfast burrito, sloppy eggs for your hangover, or a cheap cup of coffee, Sarabeth's is not your spot. Here the fresh squeezed orange juice is $5.50 a glass and its sweet breakfasts are downright extraordinary.My longtime favorite is the Salmon Eggs Benedict ($15.50), which is the most perfectly poached eggs, some of the most delicious hollandaise sauce I've had yet, topped with peppers and chives- all stacked on a nice salty but tender piece of lox. I always appreciate the nice, light green salad that comes next to it. Another long-time favorite is the Lemon and Ricotta Pancakes ($13.40). The subtlety of the lemon flavor makes this is a much lighter breakfast than the eggs benedict, but the pancakes are superbly fluffy and come with fresh, sweet berries.I also have to sing praises for the Green and White Eggs ($11.75). Scrambled with scallions and cream cheese, these are probably the best scrambled eggs I've ever had. And although it doesn't make my top list, everyone I know has loved the Pumpkin Waffle Topped with Sour Cream, Raisins, Pumpkin Seeds and Honey ($13.40).I've only been here for dinner once, and the creamy tomato soup did not disappoint.

Perhaps not the smartest thing we've ever done.  The two of us waited for at least 45 minutes for a table, and the food took forever to come out.  We asked for the muffin to come first.  Banana muffin with soft butter and jam--what a great way to start off the meal. Between the two of us, we shared two brunch items: the Goldie Lox, a delicious combination of scrambled eggs, salty lox, and cream cheese, and the blintzes.  The Goldie Lox was a much better deal, since for the same price it came with a muffin.  Both dishes were excellent. We were very grumpy from the wait and lack of food, but we immediately brightened up when we took bites of our food. All told, for two dishes, a pot of tea, a coffee, and an extra croissant because we thought it was included and accidentally ordered it, plus tip, we spent around $50.  Rather pricey for brunch, but it was pretty good.

4.0,10/26/2008,"Sarabeth's is tricky - it's another restaurant that overprices its food because it has a big name, and by 11AM it's got an hour wait.  However, I have to give it credit, because it both times I've been there I've ordered the buttermilk pancakes with strawberries, and they're easily the best pancakes I've ever had.  Every time I get pancakes at another restaurant, I set the bar against Sarabeth's, and no brunch in the city that I've had yet has met that standard.  So despite that it's a wait and more expensive than it should be, any place that makes something something you want better than anyone else is worth 4 stars.  In terms of everything else, the pumpkin muffin with jam I had this morning was delicious, which makes me think that breads are Sarabeths specialty.  The grits and 3-pepper potatoes were pretty good, the sausage wasn't very good at all.  Bottom line, if I'm up in time for an early brunch and I want pancakes, I'll definitely go back - otherwise, there are better deals.",1,0,2,Kevin S.,"Manhattan, NY",20,19,0

I had a pistachio with brownie chunks ice cream. Mmm yummmy!! Maybe next time we go, I will order something else.

2.0,8/30/2008,"I came here with my cousin for brunch.  I ordered the Vegetable and Gruyere Frittata and it was extraordinarily bland and unsavory.  To add insult to injury, our waiter seemed nonplussed to be serving us for some reason, even though we were extremely kind and courteous, and we tipped 20% at the end (although I don't know why we tipped so much, looking back).Luckily I was in good company and had a great time catching up with my relative, but other than that I probably won't be back here.",2,0,1,R O.,"New York, NY",93,224,4
5.0,8/30/2008,"Sarabeth's sits on a lovely stretch of Central Park South, designed for people-watching and park-gazing. Had it not been for a recommendation, I might have passed this place up as yet another overpriced UES eatery designed to lure tourists and ""ladies who lunch"" who don't actually eat. But boy, would I have been wrong.I enjoyed some of the best french toast I've ever had, aptly named ""fat french toast,"" or something like that. My side of pork sausage with apricots was very tasty and unique - a nice departure from the usual chicken apple sausage. And the juice blend I enjoyed was very fresh and delicious.Granted, the prices are sky high, and I imagine the wait can get crazy (at 2:30 on a Saturday, I was lucky to score the last outdoor table). But it's certainly a special treat to enjoy when you can.",1,0,1,Kiesha R.,"San Francisco, CA",165,502,0
4.0,8/5/2008,"I love this place. My girlfriend took me here for my birthday last year, and it was amazing. They serve fresh scones and jam when you order eggs. That way, you don't have to choose beteween sweet and savory. The atmosphere is great, the waitstaff is very attentive and you feel like you're on vacation. I went back for my birthday this year, it's become somewhat of a tradtion. The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because of the long lines and the fact that  it's expensive. $5.00 for four flowers juice? Come on Sarabeths.However, it is well worth the wait. I love the pumpkin waffle and still need to try the lemon ricotta pancakes.",4,3,3,Marissa Q.,"Brooklyn, NY",137,42,6
4.0,5/5/2008,I will have to say I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here. A downtown boy who rarely ever goes above the 20's. and i mean very rarely. pretty much never.  But an outing to the Guug required it. so slap on some pastels and your boat shoes. and go here for brunch. a nice relaxed and refined atmosphere. the omlets are good and the pancakes are delectable. the bloody mary is pricey but comes in a mini pitcher. with lots of pickled vegi's and its nice to walk around those foreign lands of madison and park.  oh and Oprah likes their jams.,2,2,1,Andrew W.,"New York, NY",26,56,0

We decided to give it a try.After a wait of over an hour, I walked in to a warm, cozy room. My omelette was good but the best part of my meal was the butter. Who knew butter could taste so good? I ate half of my omelette and basically all 4 pieces of toast. I had to ask for more butter because I couldn't get enough. The thing is...I'm  not a butter person. I don't know what it is about Sarabeth's butter but thank god I can't get it everyday.Since my initial trip, I've been back about 10 times. It's my go-to brunch spot on weekends.

5.0,3/3/2008,"People probably didn't understand why I gave them a perplexed look as a child when they asked what I wanted to be when I grew up. Going to an Upper Eastside all girls private school, I just assumed that I'd do what all my friends' mothers did, which was meet the girls for lunch and juggle shopping, the salon, spa and maybe a game of tennis. Lunching at Sarabeth's on Madison Avenue, I felt like I had finally grown up. A client visiting from Korea wanted to go there to feel like the girly girls she had seen eating there in a Sex in the City episode, and left NY feeling like a JAP.lol. (bad joke, but true). We had a wonderful brunch (you can get breakfast or lunch until 3:30). She loved her smoked salmon eggs benedict on English muffins with hollandaise sauce and a small side salad of baby greens. My chubby homemade cheese blintzes with sour cream and apple butter were the best I ever had. They surpassed my own homemade blintzes with their smooth whipped filling that tasted like a favorite, Patsy's fresh off the griddle cannoli. Yum. We sipped our 4 flower fruit juice, a pink concoction of pomagranate, passion flower, fresh squeezed OJ and banana, instead of lemonade, since they only have the pitchers of fresh squeezed lemonade in the summer. It still felt like summer in  the bright, airy room with the cathedral height ceilings. The service was quick, which was a relief since we'd slipped out of the office, almost 50 blocks away. I can't wait to go back for tea or just to pamper one of my girlfriends. I think I could go to this place many times without getting tired of it. I'm already dreaming of being people watched as I sit by the open french doors in warmer weather sipping a pink champagne cocktail.

4.0,12/19/2007,"The place itself is really really warm - both the decor, the temperature and the demeanor of the staff. The food is very good - they have some pretty creative twists to some simple favorite (pancakes, waffles etc) on the menu. The price though, is consistent with the Upper East Side, which if you're not from NYC means you'll be paying $6 for a glass of OJ.I got the salmon/eggs benedict which was delicious and around $14. My cappuccino tasted amazing at $4.75 and my friend got the lemon ricotta pancakes - the serving size was plenty! but she was adament that she could taste absolutely no ricotta (lemon flavor was great though).Forget about bringing a stroller/wheelchair into this place. It's too crowded and the split level design makes it impossible on the upper level. Oh, this place get's rather packed - we went on a Tuesday around 1pm - and there was a 20 min wait.

The wait was long, our server was in a horrible mood and never smiled, and both the food and the ambience of the place were average. But what really shocked me was that we were charged 18% gratuity when we received the bill. When I asked her about it, she said that that's their policy. I can understand that for big groups, but it was just the two of us. As we were tourists in NYC, we thought maybe this was the norm so we didn't say anything more.
